Chapter 3293 Crazy Devil Dragons

The altar was badly damaged and there was only one small square of it remaining. The High Firmament Academy’s main cultivation paths could be split between god and immortal cultivations, but they didn’t have a singular deity that they worshiped. Hence, the academy’s altars were built to worship heaven and earth.

The meaning was that no matter how far a person went on their cultivation path, they still needed to have gratitude and respect for heaven and earth that had given birth to them.Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

Every century, the High Firmament Academy would hold an offering ceremony for heaven and earth. And each time, it would be a huge affair. However, they didn’t offer any tributes. This was different from the altars of other sects. For the High Firmament Academy, this ceremony involved everyone within the academy, from the dean to the most ordinary disciples, to bow toward heaven and earth in thanks.

Hence, this altar made Long Chen feel emotional. He knew that not far beneath it was the foundation of the seventh branch academy. That was the first stone in the construction of the seventh branch, and it was the most important part. His mission was to set up the divine tower on that foundation.

Just as Long Chen spotted it and felt various emotions, a ray of sword-light pierced his shoulder and penetrated his dragon scale armor instantly. As a result, his blood splashed, and the sharp pain woke him up.

“The attack actually contains spatial laws. It can ignore all defenses.” Upon sensing this sharp pain, Long Chen’s heart shook.

The Devil Eye Water Lily was worthy of being a legendary existence. If Bai Shishi hadn’t cut off its seed pod, then no one here would have been able to endure a single ripple from it.

The Devil Eye Water Lily had two important parts to it. One was the actual flower, while the other was its seed pod. The flower was its weapon, but the seed pod was the source of its power.

It had been in a sleeping state, and Long Chen had woken it up. Sensing a sudden threat, it merged its energy into the flower, which resulted in the seed pod losing most of its defensive powers. That was the reason why Bai Shishi had managed to cut it off in one slash.

Without the seed pod, it was like a person who had lost the power of their Dantian. Without that source of power, it was now relying on its leaves to absorb the energy of heaven and earth for it to attack. Even then, it still possessed such terrifying power.

Since his shoulder was injured, Long Chen paid more attention to the torrent of attacks. Just then, endless roars started ringing out, and countless black dragons charged toward Long Chen.

They seemed to have gone insane, ignoring the attacks of the Devil Eye Water Lotus just to charge at him. Moreover, their eyes were as red as blood, like the eyes of hungry wolves that had spotted meat. 

“You want to devour me?”

Long Chen snorted. Ignoring those dragons, he continued searching for the foundation stone. However, the torrent of attacks followed him wherever he went, and the ground was exploding.

Suddenly, he heard some strange sounds when the sword-light struck something underground. It was as if they had struck something hard.

“Found it!” Long Chen was delighted. Looking down at one of the holes that appeared because of the attacks, he saw a flat stone that was covered in ancient marks. Even these sharp attacks were unable to harm it.

“This is the foundation stone. Its karmic luck is connected to the headquarters of the High Firmament Academy. It naturally cannot be destroyed.”

Long Chen then took out a jade talisman and tossed it into the hole. As a result, the talisman instantly transformed into dust when it touched the foundation stone, and the dust merged into the stone.

Just as Long Chen was preparing to throw another jade talisman inside, astral winds blew behind him. A giant mouth then swallowed him along with the earth.

BOOM!

Long Chen had no other choice but to take out his saber. The next moment, saber-light exploded, cutting through that mouth. That dragon fell with a huge hole in its head. 

Long Chen came flying out of it. But at this moment, another devil dragon reached him. Its heaven-shrouding wings smashed toward Long Chen, and the whistling astral winds tore at the void.

In the Dragon Blood Battle Armor state, Long Chen’s dragon blood was activated. Hence, these devil dragons were driven crazy by it. If they devoured Long Chen, they would undergo a complete transformation. His blood posed a fatal attraction to them.

When Long Chen looked up, he could see that the sky was filled with devil dragons. Also, the rain of sword-light continued, and even these black dragons were pierced. But they continued to charge at him crazily, ignoring the damage to themselves.

At this moment, lightning wings appeared on his back. He was like a bolt of lightning dodging left and right, avoiding the torrent of sword-light and the black dragons at the same time.

He wanted to reach the foundation stone as there were many steps that he had yet to complete. But the whistling astral winds and the terrifying rays of sword-light gradually forced him further and further back from his target.

Long Chen was enraged. If this continued, he would fail at the final juncture. But there was nothing he could do. These devil dragons were crazy. Quite a few of them were riddled with countless holes by the Devil Eye Water Lily, but they were still charging at him.

The Devil Eye Water Lily wanted to kill him, and these devil dragons wanted to consume him. So, neither side bothered with the other as they weren’t cooperating. As a result, a large number of devil dragons were slain by the Devil Eye Water Lily.

In the chaos, Long Chen also managed to reach out and toss a few devil dragon corpses into the primal chaos space.

“Kill, kill, kill them all! This is a good chance.” Even though Long Chen was caught in great danger as he was facing attacks from the Devil Eye Water Lily and the devil dragons, he didn’t forget to profit. The torrent of attacks had also caused him to be struck by the sword-lights several times.

Fortunately, the devil dragons were so huge that most of those attacks had to pierce through their bodies first before striking him, so most of their energy was used up before they reached him. At least, the wounds weren’t so bad.

However, Long Chen’s body was still left bloody from all the attacks. The Devil Eye Water Lily’s terrifying power had surpassed his expectations.

Luckily, the Wood Foundation Divine Trees were providing him with almost limitless life energy. His wounds were quickly healing, and it didn’t even seem to affect the Wood Foundation Divine Trees.

Even his consecutive injuries only resulted in the tiniest fraction of their life energy being used up. So Long Chen wasn’t panicking. As long as he wasn’t struck by a major attack from the black dragons, he should be fine.

The black dragons had gone insane, crazily attacking and biting. In fact, some of them even killed each other in the chaos. As a result, Long Chen could weave through their midst. For now, he was safe.

Long Chen quickly gathered over a hundred corpses in just an incense stick’s worth of time. The majority of them were killed by the Devil Eye Water Lily, with only a few killed by each other.

As for the black dragon controlled by Bai Xiaole, it was hiding in the distance, pretending to be dead. As they watched this crazy scene in front of them, their faces were pale with terror.

All of them had joined forces just to handle one black dragon, and it had still cost them some lives. But Long Chen was being chased by over a thousand black dragons, with that terrifying lily also attacking. This was surely the end for him.

“Let’s go now. Long Chen can’t be saved. If we don’t leave now, we’ll all die,” said the leader of the Blood Drinking Alliance, his voice quivering.

“Shut up. You don’t know how strong boss is. Since boss dares to come here, he naturally has the ability to return,” barked Qin Feng.

“You-!” The Blood Drinking Alliance’s leader was shocked and infuriated. He clenched his weapon.

“If you don’t want to die, then shut your mouth. Even if Long Chen isn’t here, we still have the power to kill the four of you. Do you want to try it?” Bai Shishi pressed her hand against her sword and stared at him coldly. She could see that now that Long Chen was in danger, these people wanted to rebel.

“Everyone, we can still discuss things nicely. Fighting amongst ourselves right now is foolish,” urged Jiang Yuhe. The Blood Drinking Alliance’s leader was truly a fool. He wanted to seize power at this time? How could that be possible?

Ignoring whether or not they could beat Bai Shishi and the others, even if they did manage to kill these youngsters, there would be no one to control the black dragon. How would they leave this place alive then?

Just then, threads of divine light fell from the sky, locking this space down. It was like a cage, trapping Long Chen and the black dragons. When the cage appeared, Long Chen’s expression completely changed. He couldn’t bother with the foundation stone any longer, and he rushed out.
