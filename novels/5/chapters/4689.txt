Chapter 4678 A Helping Hand

This powerful nine-star Heavenly Doyen knew that this arrogant man was anything but ordinary, so he didn’t hold back at all when he attacked.

His halberd was like a dragon roaring at its target, aiming at the man’s chest. However, just as it got near him, it suddenly twisted in a strange arc and swung toward the man’s head.

The fact that this expert could unleash such a fierce attack and suddenly change its trajectory showed that his control over his power had reached a certain standard.

This attack was quite tricky to block. If someone tried to parry it directly, their head would be gone in a bit.

This move stunned many experts in the distance. It was definitely a difficult move to block.

Just as the people on his side thought that their young master’s exquisite attack had struck perfectly, a shocking sight cut their cheers short.

To their surprise, the halberd stopped three inches from this man’s head, its blade pinched by two starry fingers.

“What?!”

The master of the halberd and the others present were shocked by this. How could this person block a full-power attack of a nine-star Heavenly Doyen with two fingers?

Seeing this scene, Yu Zihao and Fallen Daynight’s disciple were quivering with fear.

“It seems that there’s no way for us to fight as we please. It’s a bit regrettable that we’ll never make up for it,” sighed the Sovereign clan expert as he shook his head.

Long Chen calmly observed the formidable nine-star heir. The latter’s aura had grown exponentially since the trial, emanating intense power far beyond its previous limits. It seemed that the Heavenly Daos were harnessing all of Long Chen’s accumulated karma to crush him.

Suddenly, the Sovereign clan expert appeared behind Long Chen and slammed his back with his hand. Long Chen didn’t dodge, allowing this palm to strike him.

The next moment, a torrent of wild lightning poured into Long Chen, who greedily absorbed it like a dried-up lake absorbing rainwater.

“Since we can’t have a fair fight, let’s just give up on it. Instead, I’ll help you out. Remember to kill that traitor for me,” implored the Sovereign clan expert.

As the Sovereign clan expert was only one part of Long Chen’s heavenly tribulation, he knew there was no way they could fight to their fullest. If he were to injure Long Chen so badly that he couldn’t face the rest of the tribulation, the Sovereign clan expert would be unable to rest easy in his afterlife.

Furthermore, he had exhausted quite a bit of energy to face Luo Changsheng, Yu Zihao, and the others. After all, this energy was not his own but that of the heavenly tribulation. He couldn’t control it perfectly.

In the Sovereign clan expert’s mind, there was no meaning in beating Long Chen now, and losing meant even less, so he gave up on it. He directly channeled all of his energy into Long Chen to help him.

“Many thanks, Senior. Don’t worry, as long as I still have some breath left in me, not a single one of them will leave this place alive,” promised Long Chen.

Long Chen had first thought that there might be some of his friends amongst these people. However, after waiting so long, he had given up as he didn’t sense any familiar auras.

In their last clash, he had clearly sensed every single person’s killing intent here. That was when he decided to kill all of them.

“Good.” The Sovereign clan expert nodded.

Just then, they heard an explosive sound in the distance. The nine star heir had caught the halberd with two fingers, and his footsteps didn’t stop.

With a firm grip, the nine star heir effortlessly dragged along the halberd master. Despite the latter’s all-out resistance, he was powerless against the overwhelming strength of the nine-star heir. The void beneath their feet continued to fracture under the strain of their struggle. As all eyes remained fixated on their confrontation, no one noticed the events unfolding on Long Chen's side.

The master of the halberd was shocked and enraged, as this damaged his pride. He was doing his best to pull his halberd away, but he was unable to free it from the nine star heir’s grip.

If he calmed down, he would immediately abandon his weapon and run as far as he could. After all, the difference in power between the two of them was immense. He wasn’t even close to a match for the nine star heir.

However, his ego refused to permit him to abandon his weapon as that would be the greatest humiliation to him. The next moment, he roared, and strange flames ignited around him.

“He’s...!” shouted some experts in shock.

This fellow’s temper was a bit too explosive. How could he use a self-destructive technique that would damage his very foundation out of the blue?

As countless Saint runes lit up on his Saint weapon, its true power raged as it thrust forward.

With this burst of power, the halberd escaped the grip of the two fingers, stabbing into the nine star heir’s chest.

“You damn bastard, just die!”

Seeing success lie right before him, he channeled all his power into his halberd, wanting to blast the nine star heir apart.

Regrettably, he failed to realize the absence of blood from the wound. Even now, this idiot remained oblivious to the fact that the person before him was not someone with a body of flesh and blood.

Indeed, the replication of the nine star heir made by the tribulation was incredible. Its spiritual fluctuations and aura were no different from a living person. So only a few select people in this tribulation knew who he was.

When the halberd stabbed his chest, the nine star heir’s apathetic eyes finally switched from Long Chen to this expert.

The moment his hand wrapped around the halberd, all the power inside the halberd suddenly vanished like smoke, disappearing without a trace. This idiot’s connection to his Saint weapon was gone as well. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

One by one, stars illuminated on the Saint weapon, each one igniting with radiant brilliance. With every star that appeared, the Saint weapon’s aura grew explosively.

BANG!

Suddenly, the arms of the halberd’s owner exploded, crushed by the halberd’s own power.

The nine star heir then pulled the halberd away from him, swinging it above him. With a downward swing, the halberd claimed the life of its former master.

With the halberd in his hand, the nine star heir continued onward, forcing the other experts in the tribulation to retreat with his aura. They were afraid of disturbing this terrifying existence who killed nine-star Heavenly Doyens as easily as squashing ants.

As for Yu Zihao and Fallen Daynight’s disciple, they summoned the Brahma Divine Diagram and Daynight Cauldron out, ready to fight at any moment. They were terrified to see the nine star heir going their way.
