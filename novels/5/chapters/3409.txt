Chapter 3398 Establishing Might Before the City

“Human race brat, you need to pay a toll-” A small group of experts surrounded Long Chen, their leader being an exceptionally thick person.

“Scram!”

Long Chen was very direct and replied with a single word.

From Ying Bokong, Long Chen learned that the Integral Heaven Star-Field’s human race was not united at all. There were often cases of humans conning humans, using their status as part of the human race to trick their fellow humans.

As for these fellows, they were clearly part of that group. They were actually keeping an eye on this entrance, which was for people outside this star-field. Those outsiders had come to this place due to its reputation, but they might be unaware of the rules inside, so some people set their sights on them.

Long Chen eyed these people. It seemed that they thought he needed to pay to go through their customs.

Perhaps if they found a big sheep, they might be able to trick it into coming with them before killing it in a place no one else was watching.

Naturally, this was a major reason why many demonic beasts looked down on the human race in the Integral Heaven Star-Field. It was due to seeing this trash.

Long Chen could instantly tell what kind of crap they were, so he directly told them to scram.

“Brat, you’re courting death!” their leader shouted angrily. Seeing that Long Chen didn’t seem to be so powerful, he reached out to grab Long Chen’s neck and teach him a lesson.

However, Long Chen slapped him, sending him tumbling back and startling the others. They were about to make a move when Long Chen slapped them as well.

With a few simple stamps of his foot, he broke their arms and legs. They then screamed.

Most terrifying of all, Long Chen left a trace of flame energy in their broken bones, making them unable to heal and torturing them.

“Rather than being proper humans, you decide to be dogs, harming your own race to make some black money. How many people have fallen into your trap?” Long Chen looked at them with disgust. As for the two elders that had handled his tablet, they looked back in astonishment.

“What are you looking at? If you want to die now, I’ll help you out. You still want to dredge up better coffin materials right before your death?!” shouted Long Chen at them.

It was unknown if they were afraid of Long Chen or if they simply knew how to mind their own businesses, but those elders really did turn away and act like they hadn’t seen anything.

Clearly, without the tacit agreement from the two old fellows, these scums wouldn’t dare to so openly block people here.

Their cultivation bases were only average. If they didn’t have the support of others, they wouldn’t dare to mess around.

To put it frankly, while these scums did the work, the majority of the money would enter the pockets of those two old ghosts. This was a profitable relationship. Long Chen had seen such a thing many times before.

What Long Chen hated the most was that these idiots were actually willing to betray their own race just for such little profit. The main profit was taken by others.

At this moment, quite a few gazes turned toward Long Chen due to the disturbance. Most of them were demonic beasts, and they began to point as if there was a good show. Their expressions were all disdainful.

“Scram. Next time I see you harm your own race, I’ll make you regret being born.” Long Chen kicked them, pulling back his flame energy. He didn’t wish to be a show for others to laugh at.

As if they had obtained a pardon from a death sentence, those people hastily got up and slipped away without a trace.

“The show’s over so quickly? How boring.” One group had just walked through another entrance when Long Chen shooed these humans away.

“A dog biting other dogs, leaving it with a mouthful of hair. It’s not that boring. The human race is quite interesting,” laughed one demonic beast.

“Is it so interesting?” Long Chen also laughed. He walked toward that group, and his smile was a bit different from these people’s. It was a bit dangerous. But these people were unfamiliar with Long Chen and didn’t know what lay behind his smile.

“Of course, it’s interesting. Now there’s no one else for you to bite. Why don’t you bark like a good dog?” sneered that demonic beast.

“I haven’t heard a dog bark before. Why don’t you demonstrate first?” said Long Chen with a smile. He was already quite close to them.

That person laughed and really did start to demonstrate. He was then shoved by someone beside him. Only then did he realize that he had been tricked by Long Chen. His expression was twisted. “Inferior human race, you dare to toy with the great demonic beast race?! Kneel!”

A terrifying will suddenly crashed down, causing everyone’s heart to shake.

BOOM!

Someone really did kneel, but it wasn’t Long Chen. It was that demonic beast.

He knelt so hard that his bones broke and his knees deformed. His entire body was practically crawling toward Long Chen. It was truly like he was entirely devout to Long Chen.

The other demonic beasts were all shocked and retreated. Their souls were in pain in front of that will, and their bodies quivered.

Long Chen’s will was targeted at this one person. The rest were barely affected, but just sensing that will terrified them. It was like they were facing the ruler of the world. A single thought could wipe them out of existence.

That demonic beast guy prostrated himself toward Long Chen, his entire body shaking. He then pressed down on the ground with his hands, trying to stand, but he couldn’t.

“The human race inferior? If we really are inferior, why do you all take human form? If we are inferior, I suppose you would all rather die than submit. If not, raise your head,” said Long Chen, clasping his hands behind him and looking down on that person.

That person suddenly coughed up blood. In front of Long Chen’s will, he was powerless. His soul was quivering, on the verge of collapse.

“I… I submit.”Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

Ultimately, he chose to submit. If he displayed any further resistance, he really would be crushed to death by Long Chen’s will. The difference was too great. Long Chen was even more terrifying than his master who was a half-step World King, so this person could only submit to save his life.

After that, that terrifying will vanished and the invisible pressure was gone. The world returned to its normal appearance as if nothing had happened. However, now when people looked at Long Chen, there were no longer any looks of mocking.

“Master!”

At this time, Ying Bokong walked over. He had just entered the city, in time to see Long Chen’s will crushing that person. As for the person Long Chen had just crushed, he was actually an expert whom Ying Bokong greatly respected. Seeing this scene, now when Ying Bokong called Long Chen master, it felt like an honor.

In front of countless dumbfounded gazes, Long Chen and Ying Bokong went deeper into the city. At this moment, these haughty demonic beasts finally formed a trace of respect for the human race.
