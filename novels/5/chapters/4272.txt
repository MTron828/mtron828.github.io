Chapter 4261: Life as Grass

All the experts of the various races had charged over. There were countless Triple Supremes and also the peak experts like Zhao Xingtian, Ye Wuchen, the Ghost Dao lifeform, the Shadow princess, and others.

Just peak experts on their level numbered in the dozens. However, the Dragonblood Legion’s side had forcibly received their assault head-on. How could people not be shocked?

Countless qi waves crashed throughout the martial stage, and the barrier was constantly shaking as if it would explode at any moment.

The entire Sage King Prefecture was shaking as well, like a boat in the sea that would capsize at any moment. This was a truly heaven-shaking battle. All the heavenly geniuses on the martial stage were fighting.

On the other hand, the seniors’ hearts clenched just by watching, especially on the side of the High Firmament Academy. The hands of Bai Shishi and Bai Xiaole’s mother were shaking, as this battle was on an entirely different level of intensity.

The battle had just started, but the only members of the Dragonblood Legion who weren’t busy dealing with enemies were Bai Shishi and Chu Yao. But just a few breaths’ later, Bai Shishi was also forced to join.

Gaps were appearing in their defenses, and a group of the Netherworld’s experts forced their way through.

Upon seeing this, golden lotuses bloomed beneath Bai Shishi’s feet as she stepped forward. With a slash of sharp Sword Qi, she directly wiped out a Triple Supreme.

However, there were just too many enemies. Even as Bai Shishi locked down this region, more danger sprang up all around. After all, their enemies were everywhere, and they trickled through any openings they could find.

They seemed crazy. Seeing everyone on Long Chen’s side having divine radiance flowing around them, it was a clear sign that the karmic luck runes had yet to be fully absorbed.

In other words, as long as they were killed before they could fully absorb the runes, those karmic luck runes would be masterless items that anyone could take.

Gradually, more and more experts managed to break through the front lines. Over two thousand Dragonblood warriors comprised the first line of defense, slaughtering the strongest experts that they could find, their rays of Sword Qi obliterated countless experts.

Many people personally saw Triple Supremes being wiped out by the Dragonblood warriors as soon as they clashed.

These Dragonblood warriors were incredibly powerful. As for the other three thousand Dragonblood warriors that had been in the mirror world, they were spread throughout the rear, assisting the others.

Behind the two thousand Dragonblood warriors were the elites of the Starry River Sect, the academy, and the Battle God Palace. The experts that the Dragonblood warriors didn’t have time to kill became their prey.

After going through the Dragonblood warriors, there weren’t that many fish left to kill. Furthermore, they were mostly the weaker ones, so the weaker Dragonblood warriors and the brave experts who had come to assist them slaughtered those leftovers.

This was a chaotic and bloody battle, and the Dragonblood Legion’s side was under immense pressure. There were simply too many enemies, and they were all crazy.

To obtain karmic luck runes, these people were willing to throw their lives away. As soon as one batch was killed, another three batches came. As a result, the defensive line was constantly pulling back and shrinking. But at a certain point, there would be nowhere else to fall back to. Without that slight buffer, it would be a direct clash, and their casualties would soar.

Everyone was forced to go all-out, with the Dragonblood Legion doing their best to slow down the shrinking of their defensive line.

Meng Qi, Chu Yao, Gu Yang, and the others were killing the enemies as fast as they could to reduce the pressure on all the others and buy more time.

Time was what they were fighting for. At this moment, the martial stage was shaking, and strange runes had appeared on the barrier.

Since the karmic luck bead had been destroyed by Yue Zifeng, it signified that this Sage King Convention was ending. Thus, the martial stage was on the verge of vanishing.

Once the martial stage vanished, nothing could stop them from running. Thus, both sides were fighting for time. After all, once the martial stage vanished, the karmic luck runes would be impossible to take. Even if they killed these people, it would just be venting, and they wouldn’t get anything out of it.

Time was what pressed everyone to go into a craze, causing countless powerful attacks to be unleashed. On the martial stage, lives held as much value as blades of grass, and blood drenched the ground, creating a ghastly and horrific sight.

On the border of the martial stage, a few experts were still watching. A few million human experts were in a corner, and the Jiang clan’s disciples were amongst them.

“Big Sister Feng Fei, shouldn’t we join in? The tentative balance of the battlefield will be instantly broken by us,” said the long-haired man beside Feng Fei.

This person was one of the Jiang clan’s three great heavenly geniuses. His power was actually above Feng Fei’s, but Feng Fei’s position in the Jiang clan was particularly special. Despite Feng Fei’s power ranking at the bottom of the three, she was the leader.

Currently, it appeared as if both sides were evenly matched. But everyone could see that the Dragonblood Legion’s side was being pressed back and would quickly collapse.

If the Jiang clan were to join in, they would instantly break through their defenses. Just the three of them could reach the center and seize countless karmic luck runes.

Feng Fei indifferently said, “First, the Jiang clan must always keep their word. We cannot become petty people without integrity. After all, our Jiang clan is not the Zhao clan. Second, what you see is only the surface. The greatest variable on the battlefield is not the Dragonblood Legion but Long Chen himself. Long Aotian even said it himself, saying that this fellow specializes in pretending to be the pig to eat the tiger. Long Aotian has suffered at his hands many times, so do you still want to eat the pig after hearing that? Third, Long Aotian might look to be using his full power, but this fellow is extremely sinister. He is only waiting for an opportunity.”

“Waiting for an opportunity?”

“He is waiting for Long Chen to unleash his full power. In other words, he doesn’t dare to fight Long Chen in his peak state and is waiting for Long Chen to weaken before revealing his true fangs,” said Feng Fei.

The Jiang clan’s disciples were shaken. This terrifying battle still wasn’t the climax?

“Other than that, how do you know that none of these spectators are Long Chen’s friends?” Feng Fei eyed the other spectators from the other races. “And this is the most important one, even if we were to join in and kill those people, we wouldn’t be able to kill Long Chen. Once Long Chen flees, I guarantee that the Jiang clan will be doomed.”

“That can’t be. How could our Jiang clan be afraid of an Immortal King?” demanded that long-haired man.

“Long Chen’s power isn’t something that you can imagine. Although you might not believe me, as disciples of the Jiang clan, I have no choice but to risk offending you with the truth.” Jiang Fei looked at that man and sighed.

“I refuse to believe it.”

That heavenly genius snorted coldly. But at this moment, the expressions of the Jiang clan’s experts underwent a drastic change.

Just as he was about to charge into the battlefield, a ruckus came from the demonic beast race’s side. Following that, hundreds of thousands of demonic beast experts charged into the battlefield.

“Heavenly River Blood Crocodile!”

“Gold Tusk Wild Mammoth!”

“Six Horn Barbarian Bull!”

In an instant, this heavenly genius recognized these famous demonic beasts. So others had decided to make their move before him.
