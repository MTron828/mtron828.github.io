Chapter 2488 Feng Fei Lowers Her Head?

Feng Fei and the Pill Fairy charged toward the divine bone. Feng Fei slashed her sword at the Pill Fairy, wanting to stop her while she grabbed it.

However, the Pill Fairy snorted and suddenly sent the Daynight Furnace hurtling toward Feng Fei, completely ignoring her attack.

If either was struck by the other’s attack, a fairy would die.

“How vicious.”

The other experts quivered. Zhao Ritian and Long Chen’s battle had been extremely intense, but this battle between Feng Fei and the Pill Fairy seemed to be reaching its conclusion in just a few moves. Both sides were facing death in an instant.

Feng Fei was shocked and infuriated that the Pill Fairy would use such a shameless move. How could she be willing to die here? But if she switched to blocking the Daynight Furnace, she would lose her initiative, and the Pill Fairy might instantly take the divine bone.

The Pill Fairy’s expression was icy. It seemed that she didn’t even care about her life yet was also confident that Feng Fei wouldn’t dare to die with her. She reached out for the divine bone.

“Since you want to die so badly, I’ll make sure you die.” Feng Fei slashed her sword at the Daynight Furnace. The flying beast within her manifestation also reached out, slashing a claw at the Pill Fairy. Both her attacks were incredibly sharp, especially the claw.

“When a shadow is over the inner heart, it is impossible to be bright. A leaf over the eye blocks the mountain from sight. There are countless possibilities with the soul. As some wish to save all life, why do some have eyes but not see, ears but not hear, a heart but not feel, a soul that is untouched. There is no choice but for them to face redemption, or they will fall into oblivion…” As the Pill Fairy chanted, a figure appeared within her manifestation. Divine light erupted out of this figure, pouring out like a sea.

“Lord Brahma!” Long Chens’ gaze turned icy. For some reason, he had an urge to tear this figure apart. He felt a deep hatred deep within his soul.

The Lord Brahma within the Pill Fairy’s manifestation reached out toward the claw of Feng Fei’s manifestation.

BOOM!

Feng Fei’s manifestation exploded. The power of her manifestation was actually inferior.

With that, the Pill Fairy beckoned, and the divine bone actually flew straight toward her, shocking everyone. Those divine bones had their own wills. For it to fly over of its own accord, could it be that the Pill Fairy had obtained its approval?

“Earth, water, fire, wind. Could it be?!” Someone suddenly let out a startled cry. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

If the Pill Fairy had obtained one of the divine bones’ approval, then it had to be the fire attribute divine bone.

The divine bone illuminated the Pill Fairy, giving her already sacred appearance an extra layer of beauty.

“Hand over the divine bone!” shouted Feng Fei, killing intent raging in her eyes. The divine bones were very important to her. However, there was something even more important than the divine bones, which was that she had actually lost in that exchange.

The Pill Fairy waved her hand, and the Daynight Furnace appeared in front of her. She stepped onto it gracefully. Looking at Feng Fei, she indifferently said, “In the Star Field Divine World, your manifestations are unable to release their full power. But my divine might is unaffected. You aren’t a match for me in this world. If you want to keep embarrassing yourself, I won’t stop you. But if you anger me, I might not care about the ancient immortal treaty and kill you.”

Feng Fei’s pupils shrank. It seemed that this ancient immortal treaty made her think of something. She looked at the Pill Fairy in shock. “Could it be… have you already…?”

“That has nothing to do with you. As the daughter of the god, I naturally have to spread their splendor. Anyone who dares to stop me must be killed,” said the Pill Fairy coldly.

The Pill Fairy’s icy arrogance actually managed to suppress Feng Fei. She was even more domineering than Feng Fei.

People’s hearts shook. There was clearly some kind of secret hidden within their words.

The Pill Fairy said that Feng Fei was unable to use her full power in the Star Field Divine World. Did that mean that the same was true of Zhao Ritian? They were already so powerful even without using their full power. Would there be anyone capable of stopping them once they unleashed their full power?

BOOM!

Just as everyone was stunned, the earth exploded. A figure charged out.

“Zhao Ritian?”

Startled cries rang out. It was the Zhao Ritian that Feng Fei had just ‘killed’. He was alive again.

“Long Chen, hand over your life!” Zhao Ritian immediately charged at Long Chen.

When Feng Fei had crushed Zhao Ritian with a kick, she had helped sprinkle him across the ground. By absorbing the energy of the ground, he had quickly recovered.

Although his core energy was metal energy, it was the earth that birthed it. Within the ground, Zhao Ritian was able to absorb energy much more efficiently.

He had just recovered a bit of his power and charged out to kill Long Chen.

He was unable to accept this reality. Long Chen had beaten him, and if it wasn’t for Feng Fei, he would already be dead.

“Die!”

Zhao Ritian smashed the Heaven Suppressing Dragon Coiling Rod at Long Chen. He hadn’t fully recovered, but he knew that Long Chen had to be in a worse state than him as Long Chen had exchanged blows with Feng Fei in his injured state. Now was the best moment to kill him.

“If someone didn’t save you, you would have been turned to ash, but you still dare to talk so arrogantly?” Long Chen sneered and swung Evilmoon.

BOOM!

Zhao Ritian had flown at Long Chen quickly, and now he flew back even faster. Cracks covered his entire body. He was almost shattered.

“How… how did you recover so quickly?!” Zhao Ritian alternated between shock and rage.

“Long Chen, hand over the three divine bones and I won’t make things hard on you.” Before Long Chen could even reply, the Pill Fairy had opened her mouth, directly demanding all three divine bones.

Long Chen looked at the Pill Fairy, sighing, “You are no longer the old Pill Fairy. What is hard about it? It’s difficult to make me spit out things that have landed in my hands, but if you want to try it, then come.”

Long Chen knew that right now, he wasn’t facing the Pill Fairy but a puppet made from a god’s divine energy. If he still had the slightest emotions toward the Pill Fairy, there would be no saving him from his foolishness.

“To follow me is to be blessed in my divine light, reach the pinnacle of joy, and escape the sea of bitterness. To defy me is to fall into hell. The lack of faith in me, the foolishness of those who refuse my guidance, results in a world full of sin. Those sinners must be executed for the greater good.” The Pill Fairy began to chant once more, her face expressionless. Her manifestation grew brighter, and divine energy continued to pour into this world. It was like a god had descended upon this world. In front of her, people felt incredibly miniscule.

“What terrifying divine energy. Yu Qingxuan has already finished receiving the god’s guidance and become a manifestation of the god. Through chanting the god’s scripture, she is obtaining unending divine energy. The more devout she is, the more divine energy she obtains.” Nangong Zuiyue’s expression changed. The current Pill Fairy could be considered to be possessed by a god.

This divine energy was bestowed upon her based on her faith energy. The more devout her faith energy was, the more divine energy she would be blessed with. Let alone the current Long Chen, even Long Chen at his peak might not be a match for her.

Even Feng Fei was only able to draw with the Pill Fairy, and that was before she unleashed her divine energy. After her divine energy was unleashed, Feng Fei had given up. Within the Star Field Divine World, she was unable to beat the Pill Fairy.

“Hahaha!” Long Chen suddenly laughed, his laugh full of contempt. “Who does Lord Brahma think he is? What a joke. Listening to him can allow someone to escape the sea of bitterness, while not listening to him will result in someone falling to hell? Is that really a god? Doesn’t that sound more like a monstrous devil? Lord Brahma and Fallen Daynight say some big words. When I first entered Pill Valley, I already pissed on their heads. If they really were gods, then I wouldn’t be alive right now.”

As Long Chen laughed, everyone stared in dumbfounded silence. Lord Brahma and Fallen Daynight were publicly acknowledged as true gods. Did Long Chen really piss on their divine statues? That… was too crazy. Those familiar with him knew that he wouldn’t lie about such a thing. With his fearless character, it seemed that he really was capable of doing such a thing.

“Blasphemers of the gods cannot be forgiven for their sins. Only your blood can atone for your sins.” The Pill Fairy formed hand seals, and a giant palm crashed down upon Long Chen.

“Retreat. You haven’t even recovered half of your power. If you face this divine energy directly, you’ll die,” warned Evilmoon.

“No. I could retreat in front of anyone else but not her.”

Icy killing intent filled Long Chen’s eyes. Rather than retreating, he directly charged at the palm crashing toward him.

“You idiot!” raged Evilmoon, unable to understand why Long Chen would become so stupid. He had used up the energy of his dragon blood and barely recovered a bit of his spiritual yuan, yet he still was fighting against the Pill Fairy. Was this not courting death?

Evilmoon’s two dragon marks lit up. Black runes appeared and a sinister aura erupted. Evilmoon had no choice but to unleash all of its power, or Long Chen would die.

BOOM!

The giant hand shattered, but Long Chen coughed up three mouthfuls of blood. Lines of blood covered his body as if he was about to break apart. In his current state, it was too much for him to receive the Pill Fairy’s attacks.

“Idiot, if I didn’t go all-out helping you, you would have died!” cursed Evilmoon.

The Pill Fairy didn’t give Long Chen a chance to rest. Clapping her hands together, another hand reached out of her manifestation, this time grabbing the Daynight Furnace and sending it smashing toward Long Chen.

“Dodge! Without your own energy, I can’t unleash my power!” roared Evilmoon.

BOOM!

Just at this moment, the dragon altar exploded and the dragon king’s corpse was blasted apart. After that, the earth collapsed, and a black torrent suddenly shot out. The Daynight Furnace along with the Pill Fairy were sent flying by the black torrent.

“What is going on?!” Everyone stared in shock at the black flood, a bad feeling rising in their hearts.
