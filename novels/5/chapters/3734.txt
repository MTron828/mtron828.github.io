Chapter 3723 Put Away Your Weapons

A battle was on the verge of erupting. The Netherworld’s army was glaring at Long Chen. It seemed that as long as the one-eyed elder gave the word, they would immediately charge forward and tear Long Chen apart.

There were millions and millions of experts, with dozens of Divine Venerates, tens of thousands of half-step Divine Venerates, and even hundreds of Supreme heavenly geniuses. The rest were also elites amongst the Netherworld’s experts. However, all of them were now staring at a single person. That alone was enough to make people’s hearts quake.

But Long Chen still had an indifferent expression. He coldly said, “Do you want to kill me? Even if all your Divine Lord disciples attacked, they wouldn’t be able to do anything to me. Your only option is to use Divine Venerates, but if Divine Venerates attack, so will my big brother. A battle of Divine Venerates will destroy the laws of heaven and earth. After that, the entrance to the three thousand worlds will be destroyed, and no one will be able to enter. If you dare to attack, I guarantee that your Netherworld will become everyone’s target. Thus, I’ll bet my arm that you won’t even dare to touch me. Put away your weapons. Don’t act like you’re going to do anything. I am big brother Wu Tian’s brother, so the enmity between your Underworld and Nether races will affect me, but that’s fine. In the three thousand worlds, come and try to kill me as you please.”

The moment Long Chen became brothers with Wu Tian, it was set that he would be standing on Wu Tian’s side. Thus, he would also have to endure the hatred of the Underworld race, but he was indifferent to it.

A cold, sinister light flashed in the one-eyed elder’s eye. He truly did want to attack Long Chen and send his head to Wu Tian.

The half of his head that was gone was precisely destroyed by Wu Tian’s spear, and it would never recover. That was his life’s greatest humiliation.

He wasn’t a match for Wu Tian. But seeing Long Chen, he immediately thought of a way to get his revenge.

However, just like Long Chen said, there was no way for Divine Venerates to fight here. Disciples could be mobilized, but in a one-against-one, they might not be a match for Long Chen.

If they all went up at once, Long Chen could simply run. The world was so big, so how were they supposed to find him? Just like Long Chen said, they could only wait until the three thousand worlds opened.

Whether it was the human race, the devil race, or the demonic beast race, they all stared at Long Chen in bewilderment. They were unable to figure out how Long Chen’s name had spread so far. Who was Wu Tian?

Furthermore, outside of the Netherworld, only a few people knew of the enmity between the Underworld and Nether races. But seeing these experts of the Netherworld looking at Long Chen like he was their mortal enemy, their estimation of Long Chen’s fame instantly rose to an unprecedented level. At the same time as they were shocked, countless heavenly geniuses felt a burning competitiveness, wanting to decide just who was stronger between them and Long Chen.

It had to be known that fame was not differentiated by good or bad. Even if you were an incomparably vile person, as long as you were famous, that was also a kind of glory.

“Don’t worry, I will definitely take Long Chen’s head in the three thousand worlds,” said one of the Netherworld’s Supreme heavenly geniuses.

“Just you? Don’t blame me for not warning you, but if you want to cause trouble, you should bring a few more people. At least that way, you’ll have company on the path to the Yellow Springs,” responded Long Chen in the face of provocation. In any case, there would be no fight, so he naturally wouldn’t let them stoke their own ego.

“Big words! If you have guts, let’s have a one-on-one fight right now! We’ll decide life and death!” challenged the Supreme expert.

Long Chen was moved by this. This person was no longer a person in Long Chen’s eyes. No, he was simply a living Supreme Heavenly Dao Fruit. Every one that Long Chen killed was another Supreme expert in the Dragonblood Legion.

When the Dragonblood Legion once more gathered, if it was entirely composed of Supreme geniuses, just how domineering would that be?

However, there were too many experts here. Although Long Chen was confident, he still didn’t dare to be careless. Quite a few people gave him a strong sense of danger, so to expose his trump cards in front of all of them was definitely not worth it.

“Long Chen, you wouldn’t really just be an empty name, right? You sat down in front of Kun Tu’s challenge, and now you’re going to hide like a tortoise in front of the Netherworld’s people’s challenge?” sneered someone amongst the human race.

This person’s words were quite malicious. It was an attempt to force Long Chen out.

As a result, he had just spoken when a flash of divine light appeared. That Supreme expert was then struck by a talisman and hacked up blood, a crack appearing on his forehead. His body almost exploded.

Seeing this scene, everyone around him jumped in shock and hastily fled for fear of being affected.𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

The person struck by the talisman quivered. His body then transformed into a ray of light that shot away without a trace.

The talisman had appeared silently, striking him just as he mocked Long Chen. He couldn’t even sense it before it struck him, but when it did, he almost died. He had barely escaped and fled to heal his wounds.

“A frog at the bottom of a well cannot speak of the ocean. The summer insects cannot speak of the ice of winter. Do you think that you are qualified to speak about my boss? How laughable. Come, you’ve all seen the effect of my Silent Thunder Talisman. Everyone refused to believe its power before, so now do you believe it?” Xia Chen waved a handful of talismans at everyone.

Xia Chen and Guo Ran’s business had been interrupted by the arrival of the devil race, demonic beasts, and Underworld experts. 

Originally, Xia Chen had found that this business was doing too well, and he wasn’t able to keep up. As a result, he started to inscribe stronger talismans that he could sell for greater profit. But others did not know just how effective these talismans of his were. Hence, they were unwilling to pay that immense price.

It just so happened that the person mocking Long Chen wasn’t too far from him. Without hesitation, Xia Chen used him as an example. Luckily, that person’s spiritual perception was too trash to even sense the talisman before it activated. It almost killed him.

This was the best proof of Xia Chen’s talismans’ effect. Seeing that a single talisman was able to severely injure a Supreme expert, everyone wanted to buy it.

“A hundred thousand? Wasn’t it eighty thousand just before?!” cried out the buyers.

“The past is the past, the present is the present. Even a Supreme expert almost lost his life due to this talisman. Don’t you think you should pay a bit extra after getting to see that?” chortled Guo Ran.

“Even if there’s a ticket price for that show, it should be paid to that person, not you!” raged someone.

“That person was our prop. This is the best. A hundred thousand immortal king crystals for the ability to almost kill a Supreme genius! That’s an excellent price! Do you not see how hard it is for our inscriber to make such talismans?” asked Guo Ran.

A prop? People refused to believe it. To have a Supreme heavenly genius use his life as a demonstration was definitely nonsense.

“How hard is it?! He’s just waving his hand across some paper and the talisman is done! How is that hard?!” Even more experts shouted furiously.

Holding his brush, Xia Chen would simply leave a few scribbles on a sheet of paper, finishing it in a few blinks of an eye. It appeared incredibly easy.

“A hundred thousand immortal king crystals?! Why don’t you just go rob people!?”

“Robbing people isn’t as efficient. This is the price, buy it if you want. If you don’t want to, please leave so that others can buy it,” announced Guo Ran shamelessly.

Those people continued to grumble, but they still paid up. Furthermore, they all bought multiple talismans, sometimes dozens.

As a result, the money flowed in easily. This speed was truly no different than directly robbing people.

This fuss from Xia Chen’s side distracted people, and the Netherworld’s experts stopped glaring at Long Chen. They then occupied their own territory and fell silent.

“Look, there are so many beautiful women!”

Guo Ran was in the midst of collecting more money when a disturbance in the distance caused him to jump up!
