Chapter 3240 The Long Clan

Luo Changwen had noticed Long Chen grabbing Chu Yingxiong’s head, as well as sensed his powerful Spiritual Strength surge. He knew that Long Chen had conducted a soulsearch.

However, he didn’t have much hope for this soulsearch. A half-step Immortal King had powerful enough Spiritual Strength that it would be very difficult for Long Chen to obtain any valuable information from it.

Long Chen nodded. “I did get some useful information. The operation this time was the result of the Chu family volunteering for it. Having faced multiple setbacks, they were both angry and afraid. They haven’t had any outstanding displays in the last few days. After losing out several times, they were afraid that Lord Brahma would stop caring about them. Without his support, the Chu family would not have the power to fight our Luo family. Enpuda is Lord Brahma’s number one dog. Chu Yingxiong wished to suck up to the Bloodkill Hall, so they came up with this plan. Most likely, Enpuda felt that this plan should work and agreed to it. He provided both the manpower and resources for this operation. Ah, it truly has to be said that the Chu family’s heads weren’t all full of crap. This Chu Yingxiong was quite crafty. His first target was the Luo family. If I didn’t come, he would have used this power to eliminate the Luo family. Even if the plan failed, Enpuda wouldn’t blame him. After all, he had done everything he could. But after I came, he was even more assured, and he ignited a secret incense, which the higher-ups had given him, in the Ying Prefecture. It is odorless to us, but the sea demons are quite sensitive to it. They were drawn to it, resulting in their attacks. Then, they simply needed to get into an attacking posture, making us split our attention. They had plenty of time to prepare their trick this time. But we came before they could finish.”

When Long Chen explained all this, the Luo family’s experts sighed. When it came to scheming, the Luo family truly couldn’t compare to the Chu family.

“It’s thanks to you. Otherwise, with our characters, we would still be defending. I even opposed your original plan. I’m ashamed.” Luo Changwu bitterly smiled.

When Long Chen had first proposed attacking the Chu family, Luo Changwu had felt it to be too dangerous and had disagreed. Helpless to change his mind, Long Chen had changed the plan to a probing attack.

In reality, when Long Chen gave every Primal Divine Lord in the Luo family an Explosive Blood Pill, it was a subtle indication for Luo Changwu to bring all of them. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

However, Luo Changwu acted like he didn’t understand Long Chen’s intentions and had only brought these few people. Thinking about it, he felt a burst of fear. Just a little bit more and the Luo family would have been destroyed under their passivity.

“It’s fine. Even if we hadn’t come, the Chu family would have been crushed by that three-eyed lifeform,” laughed Long Chen.

Luo Changwen shook his head. “That’s impossible. Without you, we wouldn’t have sneak attacked the Chu family. Without that sneak attack, he wouldn’t have sacrificed the Chu family’s blood to draw over those lifeforms. If my guess is correct, it is precisely because Chu Yingxiong was forced to take drastic measures that the disturbance drew over that three-eyed lifeform. Thus, if we hadn’t gone over, the Chu family would have slowly and steadily summoned those eight Immortal King lifeforms and attacked the Luo family. Afterward… the positions of who would be destroyed would be swapped.”

The other experts nodded. This sneak attack had truly saved the Luo family.

Even the Grand Elder was grateful toward Long Chen, especially with the way Long Chen mentioned ‘our’ Luo family. It truly made them feel like he was one of them.

“Hehe, don’t overpraise me. It was a complete coincidence. I’ve done countless foolish things in this lifetime, but I like to have the tempo under my control. If others want to play chess with me, I’ll flip the board. Furthermore, we are one family. The Luo family’s matters are my matters. What’s the point of so much courtesy?” Their praise made Long Chen embarrassed.

“Hahaha, that’s right, we’re one family. There’s no need to talk like outsiders.” Luo Changwen laughed. He was liking Long Chen more and more. He felt close to him.

However, he didn’t know that this person he had such a high opinion of was also his nephew. Half the blood within him belonged to the Luo family.

“Uncle… cough, no matter how you put it, this matter is now done once and for all.” Long Chen almost called him his maternal uncle and hastily coughed to cover it up.

“That’s right. The Chu family is definitely done for this time. But just to be safe, we’ll need to keep an eye on the Chu family’s movements in the Sheng Prefecture. We won’t make the same mistake twice,” said Luo Changwen seriously. This time, they had to erase the Chu family from this world. They would not allow this scourge to rise once more.

“Uncle Wen, can I ask where the Long clan is within the Sheng Prefecture?” asked Long Chen casually.

Long Chen had used the most domineering method to shatter Chu Yingxiong’s soul, breaking the restrictions within it and preventing him from erasing any memories. However, such a method left him with only fragments to look through that couldn’t be pieced together.

In these fragments, Long Chen had seen a bit regarding Long Aotian and also a bit about the Long clan within the Sheng Prefecture.

However, he didn’t gain much from those fragments, so he asked Luo Changwu.

The Luo family’s seniors twitched when they heard that name. Their expressions grew a bit ugly.

Luo Changwu and Luo Changwen exchanged a glance. Luo Changwen was the one to say, “The Long clan had some grievances with the Luo family over twenty years ago. Later on, they moved, and no further news came from them. But just over a year ago, they resurfaced in the Sheng Prefecture. According to our eyes here, those people entered the Chu family, and then not long after, they were sent away. It is said that the Long clan has an outstanding youngster who summoned a dragon manifestation from the heavens when he entered the immortal world. That caused quite a ruckus in the Sheng Prefecture. But the Chu family completely covered up this matter, so we don’t know many details. As for where the Long clan went, we don’t know. Long Chen, why would you suddenly ask this?”

“Oh, it’s nothing. When I did my soulsearch, I found that the Long clan seemed very important to Chu Yingxiong, so I was curious,” said Long Chen.

Long Chen knew that this Long clan was the Long family from the Martial Heaven Continent’s divine families. However, in the academy, he had never read anything regarding the Long family.

As for Luo Changwu and the others, they clearly didn’t wish to talk about this matter. Hence, although Long Chen had thousands of questions, he endured.

If the Long clan had left, then wouldn’t his father have been brought away by them as well? It had to be known that back then, his father was the strongest expert of the Long family. If it wasn’t for his soft heart, he might have destroyed all the divine families.

In the immortal world, everything was based on power. No matter what kind of sin his father had committed, in front of his immense talent, it didn’t matter. Hence, his father should be alright.

However, the matter of the Long clan seemed to be salt on an open wound of the Luo family. So, Long Chen naturally wouldn’t force these two uncles of his to talk about it.

If the Long clan had left this area, then he had no idea where to find them. He would have to wait until he also left this domain.

“Long Aotian, I didn’t expect that you would be getting along so well thanks to my innate talent. You actually have a dragon manifestation in the immortal world? Make sure to take care of my things for now. I will personally come and take them back later.” Long Chen smiled darkly.
