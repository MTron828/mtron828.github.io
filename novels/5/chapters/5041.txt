Chapter 5030 Blocking Barehanded

As Ye Lingxiao’s aura transformed, the air around him changed along with his spiritual fluctuations. He seemed to have become a different person.

His gaze became piercing and potent, reminiscent of lightning. In his pupils, countless runes layered on top of each other until they looked like the pupils of a fiend. The onlookers didn’t dare to look at them directly.

Startled cries erupted from the spectators, particularly those from the Ye clan. They felt their blood boiling with excitement.

“Heavens, Ye Lingxiao is capable of using the Lingfeng Possession!? Long Chen’s definitely a dead man!”

“The Lingfeng Possession is one of the Ye clan’s strongest unique skills! From ancient times to now, countless people have tried to cultivate it, but those capable of using it can be counted on the fingers of one hand! Ye Lingxiao really is terrifying!”

“The moment he used this move, this battle was as good as decided. Zhao Qingtian has no chance to fight now.”𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

The Ye clan’s experts shouted loudly. They had all forgotten about how Long Chen had consecutively slapped Ye Lingxiao’s face. That was because all of them knew just how monstrous and terrifying this technique was.

Within the Ye clan, any disciple who reached a certain level would undergo a test to determine their compatibility with the Lingfeng Possession. This so-called Lingfeng Possession was a technique that infused the will of the Lingfeng Sword into a disciple. The Ye clan used this test to make a preliminary evaluation of their disciples’ potential. Unfortunately, in this era, not a single person had been able to endure even half of the Lingfeng Sword’s will.

Thus, this technique had become a legend. People had only heard about it but had never personally witnessed it. Now that Ye Lingxiao displayed it, the Ye clan’s disciples were all thrilled.

The Lingfeng Sword was the Ye clan’s legacy divine weapon, revered as a supreme existence and considered the clan’s priceless treasure. Its name came from a peerless expert in the Ye clan’s history: Ye Lingfeng. Before his death, he transferred the full power and will of his life into his sword.

After that, his soul became one with the sword’s spirit, becoming a legacy divine weapon that protected the Ye clan. The Ye clan had offered sacrifices to it over a long time. Furthermore, other experts had imitated Ye Lingfeng, and right before their deaths, they merged all their power with it.

The Lingfeng Sword contained the souls and wills of dozens of peak experts, so activating it required enduring unimaginable pressure. In the Ye clan, the only one capable of doing so was Ye Lingxiao. In order to kill Long Chen, the Ye clan lent him the Lingfeng Sword.

Now that Ye Lingxiao used the Lingfeng Possession, he had essentially been possessed by dozens of peak experts. Their strength merged fully with his body, causing his aura to grow sharp and wild.

Countless whirlpools condensed around Ye Lingxiao’s body, and indistinct figures occasionally appeared in his Heavenly Fate Disk.

“Long Chen, are you prepared to welcome death?”

Ye Lingxiao’s voice had changed, becoming ancient and gravelly, devoid of human emotion. It was like listening to a stiff corpse speak—a hair-raising sound.

“From the moment I set foot onto the cultivation path, I have been prepared to welcome death. Unfortunately, it refuses to come. There’s nothing I can do about it,” replied Long Chen, remaining completely indifferent.

“Fool. Death is right before you, but you don’t even know it. I’ve prepared this technique for Long Tianrui, so I feel a bit unwilling to waste it on you. As retribution, I’ll tear your corpse into a thousand pieces!”

The Lingfeng Sword quivered ever so slightly. Its edge merely moved a few inches, but it somehow cut through space and shook the entire martial stage. 

“Under the Lingfeng Possession, Ye Lingxiao’s power had risen to an unimaginable height. Are you sure Long Chen can win against him?” asked Jiang Wuwang as he turned to Feng Fei dubiously.

Jiang Wuwang hadn’t expected Ye Lingxiao’s merger with the Lingfeng Sword to have reached such a level. A light quiver of the Lingfeng sword demonstrated Ye Lingxiao’s full mastery of it, which was absolutely terrifying.

Without his clan’s legacy divine weapon, Jiang Wuwang knew he wouldn’t be able to block this attack. It was no wonder Ye Lingxiao had said this move was prepared for Long Tianrui; he truly had the qualifications to challenge her in this state.

“Long Chen has an endless supply of trump cards up his sleeve. I’ve known him for a long time, but I’ve never seen him run out of cards. Just look at him. He hasn’t even entered his combat state yet. He’s still handling things with ease,” replied Feng Fei confidently.

Seeing Ye Lingxiao’s state, Zhao Qingtian retreated to the edge of the martial stage, his expression dark and wary.

Zhao Qingtian hadn’t expected Ye Lingxiao to reveal his trump card so quickly. Realizing he wouldn’t get a chance to fight, Zhao Qingtian felt extreme resentment, but there was nothing he could do.

Ye Lingxiao’s eyes were sharp like a blade as he stared at Long Chen. As he slowly raised the Lingfeng Sword, the air throughout the entire martial stage surged forth. A sharp killing intent completely locked onto Long Chen.

Only a small portion of this killing intent came from Ye Lingxiao; most of it emanated from the wills within the Lingfeng Sword. These wills were like bloodthirsty fiends finally given the chance to kill, revealing their sinister nature.

Ye Lingxiao swung his sword down without any flashiness. The Lingfeng Sword then sliced through space, emitting an ear-piercing sound accompanied by a strange screech, reminiscent of a nightmare from ancient times.

Everyone hearing that sound felt their souls ache, as if an invisible hand was clutching their souls, trying to drag their souls out of their bodies.

Even before the attack landed, everyone felt disturbed. They couldn’t concentrate or control their fear. Most terrifying of all, those with weak wills directly lost the ability to resist, simply waiting for death.

Everyone was shocked by the sword’s power, finally understanding why the Ye clan’s disciples had reacted as they did when they first saw this move. Ye Lingxiao was absolutely terrifying.

His sword fell, neither fast nor slow. Everyone saw it move clearly, as if Ye Lingxiao was intentionally showing everyone how Long Chen would die.

Just as the sword was about to reach Long Chen’s head, Long Chen slowly raised his hand, reaching out to the Lingfeng Sword.

“What?!”

“Is he crazy?!”

“He couldn’t have given up, right?!”

Even with Ye Lingxiao using the Lingfeng Possession, Long Chen dared to grab the Lingfeng Sword with his bare hand. Was that any different from suicide?

Blood-colored dragon scales covered Long Chen’s arm, and a faint cross appeared on his palm, blocking Ye Lingxiao’s sword.

BOOM!

A powerful explosion erupted, and a qi wave shook the heavens.
