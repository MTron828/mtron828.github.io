Chapter 4837 Slaying Hu Yifei

“Ah!”

Hu Yifei let out a miserable shriek as Long Chen ripped off his arm along with his shoulder, sending flesh and blood spraying through the air, shocking countless onlookers.

Long Chen was somehow able to ignore the pressure of the martial stage; he didn’t even need to summon his manifestation.

However, Hu Yifei's reaction speed was also impressive. Instead of suspecting Long Chen of cheating, his instincts told him that Long Chen was truly formidable.

Regretfully, his swift response was futile. Long Chen swiftly eliminated any chance for Hu Yifei to admit defeat and escape. After tearing off his arm, Long Chen followed up with a powerful kick to Hu Yifei's abdomen.

BOOM!

The seemingly casual blow from Long Chen caused the sickening sounds of bones breaking to echo, sending shivers through the spectators. As Lu Ziqiong watched this scene in disbelief, the entire arena fell into a deathly silence. Although she had felt that Long Chen was a hidden expert, she hadn’t expected him to be this powerful.

On the other hand, Lu Ziyu, Lu Chengfeng, and the other disciples of the Lu family felt an icy chill. For the first time, they realized just how foolish they had been.

Previously, they had looked down on Long Chen and Mo Nian, even insulting and provoking the latter. Now that Long Chen was fighting, they realized that they were nothing more than little clowns in front of him.

Long Chen’s kick sent Hu Yifei smashing into the end of the martial stage, causing him to cough up blood upon impact.

Long Chen then continued to walk toward him, using the same pace as before.

“Go for the kill when he’s ill! Crush him before he gets used to the pressure!” shouted Lu Chengfeng passionately.

Long Chen was unaffected by the Heaven Saint devil pressure, while Hu Yifei had to use his manifestation to resist it. Theoretically, this was Long Chen’s best chance to kill him. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

“Big Brother Long Chen is incredible. How can he be unaffected by the pressure? What do you think, Big Brother Mo Nian?” asked Yu Fei excitedly as she stared at Long Chen’s unrivaled figure.

“This kind of devil pressure has a large effect on you, but it might as well not exist against Long Chen,” replied Mo Nian.

“Why is that?” inquired Lu Ziqiong. Even she couldn’t hold back her curiosity.

“If my guess is correct, the devil pressure from the stage is tied to the devil-slaying abilities of the fighters, correct?” asked Mo Nian.

“Yes, both Hu Yifei and I have killed Heaven Saint devil creatures, so the pressure is a bit weaker against us. The more devils you’ve slain, the less pressure you’ll feel... Are you saying Long Chen has slain Heaven Saint devil creatures? And more than one at that?” Lu Ziqiong covered her mouth in disbelief.

“I don’t know if he’s killed Heaven Saint devil creatures. However, I know that no one can count the number of devil creatures he has slain. The reason he isn’t affected by the pressure is likely related to that,” remarked Mo Nian.

Mo Nian didn’t know about Long Chen’s exact achievement in the immortal world, but during their time on the Martial Heaven Continent, Mo Nian knew that Long Chen had exterminated countless devils.

Mo Nian also wasn't certain about the connection between the devil race and devil creatures, but from what he observed, Long Chen's ability to resist the devil pressure stemmed from his slaughter of numerous devil experts.

A deathly silence fell over the spectators as Long Chen's thunderous footsteps echoed out. As Hu Yifei realized that he couldn’t retreat anymore, he glared at Long Chen, his manifestation operating at full power.

“Quick! The impact of the devil pressure is going to fade soon!” Lu Chengfeng and the others were all anxious. In their mind, if this pressure vanished, so would Long Chen’s advantage over Hu Yifei.

Just then, the martial stage quivered, and Hu Yifei’s manifestation suddenly expanded to cover the majority of the stage, freeing him from the restrictions.

“Die! Ten Thousand Sword Merger!”

When Hu Yifei formed one-handed seals, specks of starlight flowed within his blood sea manifestation, causing tens of thousands of swords to shoot out of it.

The swords swiftly converged into a single massive blade the instant they exited his manifestation. An overwhelming divine aura emanated from the sword, sending shivers down the spectators’ spines

"What power! Hu Yifei doesn't appear to be fatigued from his previous battle at all!" Startled cries filled the air. Hu Yifei had injured Lu Ziqiong with this attack, and now it seemed even more formidable, perhaps because he knew that he couldn’t hold back anymore.

The giant sword shot toward Long Chen. However, what truly astonished the spectators was that in the face of Hu Yifei's deadly strike, Long Chen didn't unleash his aura or manifestation. He didn't even pause his steady advance. With remarkable calmness, he extended a single hand.

“What?!”

“Is he crazy?!”

“Isn’t he looking down on Hu Yifei too much!?”

This action caused an uproar amongst the spectators, as they all couldn’t believe that Long Chen had withstood Hu Yifei’s killing blow with his bare hand.

Just as countless people were shocked, a layer of blood-colored divine radiance covered Long Chen’s hand, and the tip of that giant sword slammed into it.

BOOM!

A ripple spread from the impact point, causing the entire martial stage and barrier to shudder.

“How can this be?!”

Hu Yifei was terrified to see Long Chen block his strongest attack barehanded without the use of any divine ability.

Long Chen eyed Hu Yifei and indifferently said, “In front of the city gates, we competed with Spiritual Strength, and you lost. I then told you that Spiritual Strength was my weak point. Now, do you believe it?”

BOOM!

Long Chen tightened his grip and crushed the giant sword, turning tens of thousands of spiritual souls into dust in one go. Blood sprayed out of Hu Yifei’s mouth as he clenched his head, screaming. Apparently, the destruction of the swords dealt a serious wound to his soul, and he felt like his head was splitting apart.

Long Chen’s footsteps pressed forward like before. He slowly said, “Before your death, I’ll tell you one thing. In front of absolute power, all schemes are worthless.”

Hu Yifei was in too much pain to even comprehend Long Chen’s words; he didn’t even realize that Long Chen had arrived right in front of him.

With an extended finger, Long Chen pressed on Hu Yifei’s forehead, and a streak of lightning shot out. The next moment, Hu Fei’s screams came to a stop, and silence enveloped the world.

“He... died?”

Lu Ziqiong and the others’ jaws dropped. But to be fair, no one had expected Hu Yifei to be unable to fight back against Long Chen

“Hey, that fellow with the shitty drawings on his face, come up. As I said before, I’ll rip the teeth out of your mouth one by one.”

Long Chen clasped his hands behind him, looking at Cao Shaoqing. When the spectators saw that Long Chen was challenging Cao Shaoqing, an uproar exploded amongst them.
