Chapter 4023 Subduing the Blue Flame Voracious Wolf

Sacred chanting resounded throughout heaven and earth like the imperial edict of a god.

As Long Chen chanted, white flames rose and a terrifying heat unfurled. Surprisingly, the dome of the heavens was about to collapse from the heat, but a layer of frost still covered the earth, as if it had become a land of ice and snow.

This time, Huo Linger didn’t hold back. The full power of the Ice Soul was unleashed into the strongest Raging Flame Prison where the Blue Flame Voracious Wolf was trapped inside.

The Blue Flame Voracious Wolf roared and struggled against the prison, but even as flames exploded out of it and its claws raked across the prison, it was unable to break free. It then suddenly opened its mouth, and a blue flame sphere smashed into the flame prison.

BOOM!

The huge flame sphere caused the prison to deform. It began to twist but didn’t break.

At this moment, the pillars of the prison had black flames flicker over them. Those black flames possessed a sinister aura, akin to the devil’s maw devouring the blue flames.

When the wild Blue Flame Voracious Wolf saw those black flames, it instantly went still. It recognized the origin of those flames.

Those were the Yan Xu Flames. Even after devouring it, it was still so powerful that Huo Linger wouldn’t lightly use them. She couldn’t fully control them yet.

However, with the support of the Nirvana Scripture and Long Chen, she unleashed it to devour her opponent’s power.Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

Thus, the Blue Flame Voracious Wolf was now like a terrified rabbit. It was no longer even thinking about obtaining some sacrificial offering and only wanted to flee.

However, the more it struggled, the more the prison shrank, terrifying it. Also, the power of the Ice Soul gradually permeated throughout its body, weakening its flame energy.

As for the Yan Xu Flame, it was like maggots devouring his energy. As a result, the Blue Flame Voracious Wolf was rapidly weakening.

“The Yan Xu Flame really is terrifying. Even an immemorial divine beast is restrained by it.” Long Chen couldn’t help being shocked as he watched its effect.

As he was forming hand seals and chanting, his spirit, soul, and will merged. In this state, every syllable of the Nirvana Scripture that he chanted seemed to be able to control this world’s fate.

Long Chen was overwhelmed by a profound feeling he had never experienced before. It became evident to him that he had undergone a complete transformation through his dedicated practice of the Dragon Soul Body Forging Art.

The flame energy of the world flowed under Long Chen’s control. Before this, he could only control the power of heaven and earth. But now, he had a feeling like he could control anywhere the Nirvana Scripture could reach. He even felt like he could extract the flame energy of the imperial disciples for himself.

But of course, he didn’t do so. That would just be weakening his own side. Strangely, he found that he was unable to support them with flame energy. He was only able to use this flame energy to support himself and Huo Linger whose soul was linked with his.

Other than that, he also found that he was capable of using the power of his spirit, soul, and will through the Nirvana Scripture to rapidly consume the Blue Flame Voracious Wolf’s flame energy and give it to Huo Linger.

As a result, the Blue Flame Voracious Wolf roared in terror, but it was meaningless. As time passed, it grew weaker and weaker, while Huo Linger only grew stronger.

In truth, the Blue Flame Voracious Wolf only ever had one chance to escape, and that was to unleash its full power the moment the flame prison condensed. Then it would have had a high chance of shattering the flame prison.

But in the end, it was the heroic spirit worshiped by the Blue Flame Empire. Having stayed alive thanks to the Blue Flame Empire’s offerings and faith energy, it would not use up so much of its energy for nothing, or replenishing it would be too difficult and take too long.

Thus, it hadn’t unleashed a full-power attack right at the start, resulting in it being caught in this prison of death. It had lost its only chance of escape.

Long Chen couldn’t help sighing with relief. This time, his life finally took a turn for the better. Originally, he had thought that it would take a great price to subdue this Blue Flame Voracious Wolf. But it turned out to be quite easy.

The eight hundred thousand imperial disciples had fully sealed down this area, so no information could leave this place. As there was no worry about other variables intruding, everything was under control.

“Don’t let him escape!”

Suddenly, Yu Qingxuan cried out. They had just exchanged blows with Lan Tianba, causing him to cough up blood and shoot back. However, the way he flew back was a bit odd, and Yu Qingxuan instantly had a bad feeling.

As expected, Lan Tianba was a crafty old fox. Seeing that the Blue Flame Voracious Wolf was trapped, he knew that it was over. Thus, he borrowed their combination attack’s power to fly away in the other direction, wanting to escape their blockade.

Lan Tianba was extremely fast, and by the time they reacted, he was already at the edge of the barrier.

“Ignorant juniors, just you wait! Your Vermilion Bird Empire will pay a bloody price!”

Lan Tianba’s saber lit up with divine light, unleashing a full-power attack at the barrier.

However, just as his saber slashed onto the barrier, all the imperial disciples, including Yu Qingxuan and Zhu Yunwen, rapidly formed hand seals. A giant Vermilion Bird totem then appeared on top of the barrier, blocking Lan Tianba’s saber.

BOOM!

Half of Lan Tianba’s body instantly collapsed and his saber flew away. He almost exploded.

The miserable Lan Tianba had never expected that the strongest technique of the eight hundred thousand imperial disciples would actually be defense. Of course, that was how they had managed to resist the terrifying pressure of the trial by fire.

The combined defenses of eight hundred thousand Vermillion Bird empire’s experts possessed such power that the backlash almost took Lan Tianba’s life.

Even in his peak condition, he wouldn’t be able to break their absolute defense, let alone in this weakened state. But if he was in top condition, at least, he wouldn’t be half-dead after trying.

Zhu Yifeng’s sword then slashed down, taking advantage of Lan Tianba’s confusion to cut off his head, shattering his soul. Just like that, an empire’s master, a majestic three-flower Earth Venerate, was slain by their combined forces.

Looking at Lan Tianba’s head, they felt like they were dreaming. They didn’t dare to believe that they had actually done this.

Just then, on Long Chen’s side, within the endless flames, the giant Blue Flame Voracious Wolf was dragged into a black spatial gate by the flame prison.

BOOM!

The spatial gate then slammed shut and the Blue Flame Voracious Wolf vanished. The next moment, Long Chen raised his head and laughed.

“Success!”
