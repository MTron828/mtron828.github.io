Space shook. One rainbow-colored figure shot through the sky after another. There were over a thousand Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrows flying through the air, and they were a wonderful sight to behold.

The current Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow race was no longer as powerful as before. Only just over thirty of these figures had reached the twelfth rank. The rest were at the eleventh rank.

However, that didn’t affect their domineering appearance. Cloud was carrying Long Chen and the others. She was actually flying at the very front.

She was incredibly fast. She would only slow down in places that had cities or sects.

“Heavens, isn’t that Long Chen?”

“There’s his Dragonblood Legion too!”

“What are so many experts of the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow race doing together?”

Countless experts were amazed by what they saw streaking over their heads. They knew that today was the day that the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow race was announcing their return. For Long Chen to lead them through the sky so fiercely, what were they planning?

The Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow race was viewed as traitors of the Xuan Beasts. Hence, it had been many years since so many Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrows had appeared on the continent.

Furthermore, Long Chen was leading the Dragonblood Legion along with the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrows. That couldn’t be for nothing.

“Brother Long Chen, where are we going?” asked Cloud.

“Don’t rush. Let’s stroll around for a while longer to announce to the world that the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow race is back. We will no longer be bullied, and we want revenge. That way, your old followers will be more comfortable with joining your side. You’ll need to gather your old loyal subordinates,” said Long Chen. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

The Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow race had once been the most powerful race of the Xuan Beasts. But due to the mechanisms of other races’ schemes, they became victims and were expelled from their midst.

To wipe away the insult and humiliation of having such a thing done to them would require blood. They would need to rise once more. By patrolling like this, they were showing off their power and making a kind of announcement.

“But this way, the Xuan Beasts’ headquarters will be prepared. We won’t be able to sneak attack them, right?” Cloud didn’t understand.

“Foolish girl, they aren’t gods. They have no idea if we’re targeting their stronghold or not. Right now, our general roaming direction is the headquarters of the Martial Heaven Alliance. They might think that the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow race is going there to express their sincerity and thanks. That kind of etiquette was quite common in the ancient era. The Xuan Beasts won’t think we’re attacking them because their actions today have gone a bit too far, in truth, those experts were already dead. By returning their heads, they can say that they were simply returning their remains. We have no reason to be angry,” said Long Chen.

Those heads had been cut off in their attacks of the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow race’s strongholds. They had kept the heads to research the divine marks on their crystal bones to see if they could replicate the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow race’s divine abilities.

However, such a thing was incredibly difficult. They weren’t capable of it. With the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow race announcing their return, they sent over the heads to humiliate them. However, on the other hand, they could also say that they were returning their remains. That kind of double-faced action was particularly disgusting.

“Then if we don’t have an excuse to attack, what are we supposed to do?” asked Cloud worriedly.

“Do we need an excuse to attack? If they need an excuse, then for example, we can say that the weather’s not bad today,” said Long Chen. When had he ever required an excuse for his actions?

The Dragonblood warriors laughed. As for Qu Jianying and the others, they hadn’t come. They had returned to where they had come from.

To use Long Chen’s words, they had come for formalities only. The Dragonblood Legion and the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow race were enough. If they went as well, it would be bullying.

Countless experts of the continent stared up in shock as the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrows passed through the sky. The Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrows felt extremely emotional inside at this. After so many years, they were finally flying over the continent once more. They were about to wipe away years of humiliation.

Some of them were unable to hold back their bird cries, releasing their resentment and anger.

“Speed up.” Long Chen sent a message to Cloud. Multicolored light flowed around Cloud, transforming her into a rainbow that streaked across the horizon.

Following Cloud, the others also sped up, and the sound of their cries grew more and more resounding.

In the end, they were so fast that the people below only saw a rainbow streak going through the air and heard their cries, without even being able to see their figures.

The Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrows accelerated more and more, unleashing their emotions. They felt something that they hadn’t felt before.

They quickly arrived at the territory of the Xuan Beasts. Their arrival immediately caused an alarm to ring out.

However, they ignored everything, charging straight for the headquarters. The Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrows were too fast, and the Xuan Beasts were unable to stop them.

“Hehe, we’ve arrived.” Long Chen had a gratified smile. As expected, Zheng Wenlong’s reports were very accurate. They hadn’t come for nothing.

“Who’s there?!”

There were actually Netherpassage experts here at the headquarters. Countless other experts were also rushing over. These people weren’t from the Xuan Beasts.

Last time, their headquarters had been destroyed by Long Chen and Ji Wuming. Hence, the Xuan Beasts had moved their headquarters to a neighboring plot of land and started to rebuild. This time, rather than just creating caves in a mountain, they were building a grand protective formation. They had invited countless craftsmen to do so.

There were all kinds of materials stacked up. The workers were busy surveying and planning for the construction when Long Chen arrived.

“We’re here to accept our gift.” Long Chen smiled and walked down from the sky. Those Netherpassage experts’ expressions completely changed.

“What... what are you doing here?!” Even the Netherpassage experts who had reached the second step trembled in fear.

Long Chen had slain Ji Wuming who had been at the third step and supported by a supreme sect’s karmic luck. As a result, they didn’t have the slightest confidence to go against him. If he wanted to kill them, they probably wouldn’t even be able to run.

“I’ve already said I’m here to accept a gift. What, after being allied with the Xuan Beasts, have the ancient family alliance’s people forgotten how to speak the human language?” Long Chen sneered.

It seemed that the people in charge of rebuilding the Xuan Beasts’ headquarters were from the ancient family alliance. The ancient family alliance had once been one with the Righteous path, but due to Di Long, they had fractured.

Then through several large battles, both sides had taken losses, and the hatred between the two sides grew. Their hatred for each other had grown to the point where neither side cared who was right and who was wrong.

“Accepting what gift?” asked that Netherpassage expert. He began to sweat. He had a bad feeling.

“Today is the day that the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow race is returning to the continent. The Xuan Beasts sent a paltry congratulatory gift. Feeling like they were all one family, they felt embarrassed to send anything bigger. But since they’re embarrassed, we came to take it ourselves.” Long Chen waved his hand. “Brothers and sisters of the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow race, no need to stand on courtesy. If it can be moved, take it.”

Following Long Chen’s orders, the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrows opened their mouths. The piles of materials were swallowed by them.

“No... those are...”

That Netherpassage expert suddenly stopped. A white bone spear was pointed at him, and Gu Yang was staring at him icily. As long as he said another word, he wouldn’t hesitate to attack.

Long Chen patted that Netherpassage expert on the shoulder. “You and I are both parts of the human race. If it weren’t for that idiot Di Long, we might be friends. So sometimes right and wrong are important to be clear about. Why would humans make things hard on other humans? These resources belong to the Xuan Beasts, and I’ve come here to accept my gift from the Xuan Beasts. Does it have the slightest thing to do with you? If you’re willing to risk your life for them, I’ll accompany you. If you aren’t, then just quietly watch the show. After all, this has nothing to do with you. As long as you don’t raise your weapon against me, I won’t do anything to you. But if you do, then there will be no room for negotiation. You can decide yourself if you want to live or die. If you don’t want to die, then you should back up a bit from those resources.”

The workers fled to the side. The resources were sucked up by the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrows.

Long Chen had heard that the Xuan Beasts were reconstructing their headquarters, and those resources were not cheap. Apparently, Pill Valley had paid quite a price, as the Xuan Beasts themselves were unable to afford such luxury.

Now that they were sucked into his pocket, Long Chen really felt refreshed.

The Xuan Beasts would have never imagined that after just a short moment of peace, Long Chen would dare to run over and snatch their resources. Furthermore, he even had an excuse to do so.

Seeing those resources being sucked away by the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrows, that Netherpassage expert could only shake his head with a bitter smile. Those resources belonged to the Xuan Beasts, and he was only in charge of the construction. The Xuan Beasts shouldn’t take out their anger on him, right?

Suddenly, the void rumbled. Countless experts came surging over, blazing with killing intent. The one at the front was the leader of the Xuan Beasts, Peng Wanli.

“Long Chen, you have gone too far!”
