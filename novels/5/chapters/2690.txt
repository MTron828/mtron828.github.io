Chapter 2679 Shameless

“A warm-up?”

Such an explosive battle was just a warm-up? Was that an insult to their intelligence?

However, when they looked at Long Aotian’s expression, it didn’t seem to be a lie. Furthermore, with Long Aotian’s power, he didn’t need to brag.

For a moment, people were simply dumbfounded. Even the power of their warm-up was enough to make people feel despair, so what would happen if they went all-out?

“End me? This grand aspiration of yours will never be achieved in this lifetime. A despicable little person who stole other people’s talent also dares to say such big words? The world must have really changed. I used to curse the heavens for being blind, but now I understand. It’s not that the heavens are blind but that they have no eyes at all. Even trash like you can stand in such a position. The so-called Heavenly Daos are nothing more than a heavenly joke. Fortunately, I, Long Chen, have never believed in those heavens.”

Long Chen had entered a special kind of state, having completely mastered the wrath of heaven and earth. He no longer needed to be careful.

The Heavens’ Wrath state of the Heaven Splitting Divine Sect was still something that controlled Heavenly Dao energy, something within the scope of the Heavenly Daos.

However, Long Chen had entered a peculiar state that was outside of that scope. He had escaped the limitations of the Heavens’ Wrath state and was viewing the world from a different angle. Having seen the essence of the Heavens’ Wrath, he used his fury to form a resonance with all life that was restricted by the Heavenly Daos. Hence, his Heavens’ Wrath state was fundamentally no longer the same as the Heaven Splitting Divine Sect’s Heavens’ Wrath.

It was precisely due to this that Long Chen said that Long Aotian had missed his only chance to kill him. If he hadn’t shown Long Chen the Three Flowers Converge, Ten Thousand Daos Slaughter just to show off, Long Chen wouldn’t have managed to fully comprehend this new Heavens’ Wrath enlightenment.

All life was unwilling to be restrained by the Heavenly Daos. They had been suppressed for far too long. They had grown up with the restrictions of the Heavenly Daos and wished to be free.

It was Long Aotian’s Three Flowers Converge, Ten Thousand Daos Slaughter that had been the spark of insight that drew Long Chen’s anger together with the anger of not only the heavens but also all things beneath the heavens. That was what allowed Long Chen to possess unprecedented power.

Long Chen was now fighting with the power of the Heavenly Daos, and all things in this world that wished for freedom were giving him their energy. Mountains, rivers, the stars, the sea, and all things within heaven and earth had now formed a subtle connection with Long Chen.

The current Long Chen was truly fearless, and his power was continuously rising. It was his first time controlling so much power that came from outside of his body.

Long Aotian sneered, “The weak are devoured by the strong. Those are the Heavenly Daos. The weak aren’t qualified to complain. I, Long Aotian, am the only lead of this world. As for you, you’re merely a fruit that the heavens prepared for me. Your Spirit Blood, Spirit Root, and Spirit Bone were taken for me. And today, your fame, position, and glory will also belong to me. You escaped death back then, perhaps because the heavens wanted me to kill you now in front of everyone as a stepping stone to my unrivaled position. You, Long Chen, are fated to be nothing more than a foundation for me, Long Aotian. That is your fate.”

“What a pity then. I, Long Chen, have never believed in fate. I just believe in my own power. I believe that today, I will beat you like a dog. Then I’ll tear off your flesh bit by bit in front of your father and mother so that they can experience that flavor.”

Suddenly, Long Aotian’s mother sneered, “A slut is a slut. Your mother was a slut, and the son she birthed is also a slut. No matter how hard you work, you can’t escape that. As for my son Aotian, he is fated to be this world’s main character and lead its experts to victory. My son is an emperor, while you were simply born with a golden key. Your birth was simply to give my son that key. Do you still not understand this? Struggling when you’re already through death’s door is meaningless.”

Long Aotian’s mother was quite malicious. Furthermore, her voice was extremely sharp. It was unknown if this was her natural voice or if she had changed it in order to antagonize Long Chen, but anyone who heard her voice felt like cutting off her hateful tongue.

“Shut up! You’re the slut. Everyone in your family is a slut.” Long Chen didn’t mind others insulting him, but he hated it the most when others insulted his family.

That was especially true when it came to her biological mother and father whose fates were uncertain. His eyes instantly turned scarlet.

“Long Chen, accept your fate. Although your father was unmatched, he was too stupid. In the end, he was just a brash man that couldn’t achieve anything. He thought that he had become unrivaled, but my sword still stabbed him through his weak spot. After being so injured, he was surrounded and suppressed, unable to escape his fate. His ending back then is a reflection of your future. Your struggle is meaningless. Just give up. Due to your father being from the same family, we can leave you an intact corpse.” Long Aotian’s father also jumped in. He had a completely regretful expression.

Daoist Heavenly Feather’s expression changed. She instantly saw through their malicious schemes. They had clearly sensed what a threat Long Chen was, so they were antagonizing him, using his parents to make him go crazy. At that time, he would be filled with openings, and Long Aotian could easily kill him.

She was about to warn Long Chen when the High Priest stopped her, shaking his head. “Don’t worry about it. I understand this child Long Chen. Those two are truly foolish, not knowing Long Chen’s character. They don’t realize that in the Heavens’ Wrath state, the angrier he gets, the greater his power. They want to anger him to the point that he reveals an opening? What a joke. Just watch. They will pay a terrible price for their ignorance.”

This husband-and-wife pair managed to insult Long Chen’s mother and then mock Long Chen’s father in one go. Long Qifeng’s sanctimonious appearance in particular made him feel even greater hatred.

If he was telling the truth, then it was even more hateful. Considering how powerful Long Zhantian had been, how could he have been stabbed by a sword? It was obvious that it was a despicable sneak attack, which further showed just how shameless their entire family was.

Even the divine families’ experts were staring at the two of them gloomily. The two of them had thrown away the face of the divine families for their own goals. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

Even if Long Aotian killed Long Chen today, considering his character, could he truly lead the Martial Heaven Continent’s experts?

At this moment, Long Chen’s eyes were completely red as if he had gone insane. On the other hand, Long Aotian suddenly stepped on the air and vanished, his spear piercing toward Long Chen’s back without a sound. No one knew how he had suddenly moved.

“Watch out!”

Startled cries rang out. Long Chen was just standing there, as if he hadn’t sensed what was happening behind him.

“Despicable!”

“Shameless!”

People were infuriated by Long Aotian taking advantage of his parents’ distraction.

Just as his spear was about to pierce through Long Chen’s back, Long Chen vanished. A hand suddenly appeared out of midair and slapped Long Aotian’s confused face.

BOOM! The void collapsed. Everyone was deathly silent.
