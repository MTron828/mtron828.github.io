Chapter 4144: Uncle Tree Shakes Venerates

BOOM!

As the radiant golden light swept over, the Heaven Venerate of the Soaring Dragon Company exploded, transforming into blood mist. Within the billowing mist, some runes materialized and slowly dissipated throughout heaven and earth.

After all, a Heaven Venerate was an existence that had absorbed an enormous amount of Heavenly Dao energy. So, now that his body was destroyed, those Heavenly Dao runes were naturally reclaimed by the Heavenly Daos.

After his body exploded, a fist-sized golden figure appeared where he was. That was his Yuan Spirit.

“Just wait, the Soaring Dragon Company will not let you off!”

Having lost his body, he escaped his bindings and hastily fled.

“Boss, my bad!” Guo Ran didn’t dare to look at Long Chen.

Just now, just as Long Chen was about to attack, Guo Ran had taken over. He wanted to stand out, and as a result, his arrow only destroyed that Heaven Venerate’s body, not his Yuan Spirit, allowing him to escape.

Guo Ran hadn’t expected an innate Heaven Venerate’s Yuan Spirit to be so powerful. His arrow was actually unable to kill it.

If Long Chen had attacked with the golden spear instead, with it directly piercing the innate Heaven Venerate’s head, the latter’s Yuan Spirit would have been instantly wiped out.

Thinking about it, Long Chen seethed with frustration. This little fellow’s desire to show off was just too much. Nevertheless, given that the deed was already done, there was no use in scolding him now.

“Anyone who dares to attack my master will have to kill me first! I don’t know how many of you I can stop, but I know I can drag a few of you down with me. If you doubt my Undying race’s divine abilities, come and try it,” announced Uncle Tree.

This time, the enemies’ expressions changed. A fight to the death with the Undying race? That was like a suicide mission.

They could not believe that Long Chen had managed to make such a powerful expert of the Undying race willing to protect him so loyally.

For a moment, they were too intimidated to attack. Although the treasures were enticing, they could lose their lives too.

Apart from that, the Undying race’s protectiveness of their own kin was well known. If this Undying Dragon Tree expert were to be slain by them, they would probably be hunted down by the entire Undying race. Such a perilous action should not be taken lightly. It could very well lead to the obliteration of their entire clan and sect, for the Undying race was not an existence that just anyone could provoke.

The current Uncle Tree was in an unrivaled state. Although everyone knew that he couldn’t maintain this state for long, they didn’t dare to risk their lives.

Other than that, they also had to face Xu Jianxiong, the leader of the Fullmoon race that came from the life-forbidden area. No one wanted to offend such a force and the Undying race.

Most importantly, even if they were to offend these two terrifying powers, they still might not be able to capture Long Chen, who had the High Firmament Academy behind him. This oldest academy in the nine heavens and ten lands might be said to have declined, but its profound foundation still gave them a sense of trepidation.

“It’s fine. Go ahead and attack. I have enemies spread throughout the nine heavens and ten lands, so I don’t mind adding you to the list. As long as you dare to attack me, I will dare to treat you just like I treat the Soaring Dragon Company. You are naturally permitted to try to steal my things. Of course, I hope you will be able to gladly accept me stealing your treasures as well.”

Long Chen swaggered over with the spear on his shoulder, looking completely indifferent to their threat. This scene caused their hearts to shake. They finally understood that this youngster was not at all tender. The news of the Soaring Dragon Company being repeatedly plundered was known to all.

Even though their business was spread throughout the heavens, they were unable to stop this little fellow.

Thus, if this fellow were to set his gaze on them, they would never get a good night’s sleep again. It was the so-called principle of someone with nothing to lose having no fear toward people with something to lose. Long Chen could plunder one spot after another, but they couldn’t do the same.

These experts all had their own reputations to uphold, and they came from different powers. They were hoping to take advantage of this opportunity, but now it seemed that this thought was not practical. Rather than gaining any meat, they might just lose all their eggs in one go.

Seeing the unfavorable situation, quite a few experts directly retreated and brought their people away. As for whether they actually left or were hiding in the distance, who could say?

“Long Chen, hand over your treasures, or there will be no rest until death!”

Although the others gradually scattered, the Blood Devil race’s experts still refused to leave. Xue Qingkuang in particular was seething with rage.

“Are you a child? Do you think that I will give away what is already mine? Are you dreaming? As for no rest until death, hehe, as a member of the human race, do you think that I’m friends with your devil race? Who is afraid of no rest until death between us?” sneered Long Chen.

“Long Chen, we can let off everything else, but hand over the Heaven Merging Blood Lotus Seed! We can pretend as if nothing happened if you hand it over. That is my bottom line!” shouted the race leader.

Hearing that, everyone was startled. Was the Blood Devil race really planning on just accepting this loss?

It had to be known that they had given Long Chen a fortune in immortal metals, treasures that were only possessed by the Blood Devil race. Their value was incalculable.

Were they really planning on letting all that go as long as Long Chen handed over the Heaven Merging Blood Lotus Seed? Were they really the Blood Devil race famed for their brutality and cruelty?

“What crap. Either attack or scram. I was planning on collaborating with you sincerely, but you betrayed me, so I’m keeping your deposit. Don’t even try talking reason with me. Your devil race has never talked reason. Aren’t you very wild, very domineering? Right now, my attitude is fight or scram!” sneered Long Chen.

“You!” Xue Qingkuang’s fury soared. He was about to attack right then and there when his leader grabbed him.

“Good, very good! Long Chen, is it? Just wait. The Heaven Merging Blood Lotus Seed will return to our hands sooner or later. But you will pay the price of your foolishness.” The Blood Devil race’s leader then turned to Uncle Tree and Xu Jianxiong. “Undying Dragon Tree, Fullmoon race, your names have been recorded by my Blood Devil race. We’ll see who’s the last one laughing!”

Just like that, he left, dragging Xue Qingkuang who was glaring at Long Chen as he was brought away.

“Hey, wait a moment!” called out Long Chen suddenly.

This shout was a pleasant surprise for the Blood Devil race’s leader and Xue Qingkuang. They thought that Long Chen was finally afraid.

“I can’t just give you the Heaven Merging Blood Lotus Seed for free. But if you have any treasures on the same level as it, we can do a trade. Our first collaboration didn’t go well, but perhaps our second one can!” Long Chen smiled brightly, looking as if he needed a beating.

“Fuck off!”

The Blood Devil race’s leader roared and brought away his people, not even looking back again.
