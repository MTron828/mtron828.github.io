Chapter 2470 Ye Ming

Translator: BornToBe

The figure had just appeared, and before it could even get a clear look at the surroundings, Evilmoon was already silently slashing toward it.

The figure was covered in a black cloak that covered its face. A black aura exuded from its body. It was the Corrupt path’s mysterious expert, Ye Ming.

“Long Chen!”

Ye Ming was startled. He extended a hand, five different runes lighting up on his fingertips. Then the five runes whirled together into a five-colored shield.

BOOM!

The shield exploded, but Long Chen’s sneak attack was also resolved.

“It just so happens that I was looking for you.” Ye Ming snorted, and his figure suddenly became illusory. He vanished just like that.

This was not a simple movement art. He had truly vanished. Even his aura was gone.

Long Chen suddenly swung Evilmoon behind him, perfectly meeting a fist. White bone spurs were coming out of the fist.

The bone spurs shattered, but Ye Ming’s figure was still not present. Long Chen’s expression didn’t change. Without looking back, he swung Evilmoon to his left rear.

Long Chen swung Evilmoon seven times, every time blocking an attack that came out of nowhere.

Ye Ming’s figure appeared in the air once more. His face was still covered by his cloak. He snorted. “No wonder Tian Xiezi was unable to kill you. I really did underestimate you. I shouldn’t have agreed to Tian Xiezi’s request.”

“I feel the same way about you. Most teleportations can only be carried out within a specific domain, but you are able to freely teleport within this world that has completely different laws from the Martial Heaven Continent, and without summoning a domain at that. You can even merge your aura into the Ten Thousand Dragon Nest. As expected of a god’s reincarnation. I’m growing more and more interested,” said Long Chen with a faint smile. Battle intent grew within him.

A god’s reincarnation definitely had to relate to many secrets. Perhaps Long Chen could learn a few of the Martial Heaven Continent’s secrets from Ye Ming.

Ye Ming’s aura clearly fluctuated upon hearing that. He icily said, “Tian Xiezi’s loyalty was insincere. Not even death is enough punishment.”

Ye Ming was enraged. His identity was a secret within the Corrupt path. The only one to know of it was Tian Xiezi.

He was well aware of Tian Xiezi’s abilities. Although Long Chen might possess the power to kill him, it was impossible for Long Chen to obtain Tian Xiezi’s secrets. The only possibility was that Tian Xiezi had revealed them himself. This was equivalent to a betrayal to a Corrupt God.

“Let’s not waste time. We don’t need to make any excuses for fighting. Let me experience just how powerful a god’s reincarnation is.” Long Chen’s divine ring appeared behind him, and 108,000 stars lit up inside of it. The earth was crushed by the pressure.

“No wonder you could kill Tian Xiezi. So your manifestation has also awoken,” said Ye Ming coldly. That starry sky behind Long Chen was taken to be a manifestation by him.

Long Chen didn’t waste words and slashed Evilmoon down with his full power. This was no divine son, but someone who had once ascended and become a god.

“Hmph, it doesn’t matter how strong you are. You’re still nothing in front of me.” Ye Ming snorted, and in the face of Long Chen’s attack, he simply stood there. A black manifestation suddenly burst into existence behind him.

There were two eyes within Ye Ming’s manifestation, but other than that, there was only endless darkness.

Those eyes seemed to have something dancing within them. Just being looked at by them was enough to make a person feel like their soul was being wrested out of their body.

“It’s dark energy!” Evilmoon let out a startled cry.

BOOM!

Long Chen’s saber slashed down, but Ye Ming caught his attack with his bare hands.

Long Chen felt as if his attack had been sucked away into a vast sea, with all his power vanishing.

“Devil Eye Soul Snapper.”

The eyes within Ye Ming’s manifestation suddenly grew. It was as if a devil was staring into Long Chen’s spiritual sea.

Some kind of energy tried to break his soul. This spiritual attack came without any warning.

“Not good!” Long Chen was shocked that Ye Ming’s eyes were able to unleash spiritual attacks without warning and through space. This attack caught him off guard.

Just as his Spiritual Strength was suppressed and in danger of being stripped away from his body, the Divine Gate within his mind-sea opened. The Divine Gate Star lit up, and the attack silently vanished.

Ye Ming’s body shuddered, and he stared at Long Chen in shock. He had thought that this divine ability of his could easily kill Long Chen in an instant when he was caught by surprise. But despite having victory within his grasp, some kind of mysterious power had made his divine ability useless.

BOOM!

In that instant, light exploded out of Evilmoon, blowing away Ye Ming’s arms and slashing toward his head.

Ye Ming’s figure instantly vanished. His teleportation technique had allowed him to escape.

However, the hood of his cloak had been destroyed, revealing his true face.

Upon seeing his appearance, Long Chen was surprised. Ye Ming looked very young, but his eyes were white as snow. He had no pupils.

There were black lines around his eyes, giving off a bizarre and sinister feeling.

“So even after nirvanic rebirth, you managed to keep a pair of eyes within your manifestation while you cultivated a new pair of eyes. It seems that your plot isn’t small. You want to make up for any flaws from your past cultivation?” Long Chen looked at Ye Ming observantly.

In truth, these words weren’t his own but from Evilmoon.

As expected, Ye Ming’s expression changed. He then smiled. “I wouldn’t have thought a baby like you would know this much. I was going to keep you alive to distract those fellows from the divine families for me, but it seems that I have to kill you now.”

A sword appeared in Ye Ming’s hand. Its edges were covered in jagged teeth. Those teeth looked chillingly sharp.

Long Chen ignored the sword, continuing, “In your last life, you cultivated dark energy. Dark energy’s main purpose is to devour. But the eyes of your divine ability are clearly lacking enough dark energy, and they even require another kind of energy to restrict the eruption of the dark energy from harming yourself. If you didn’t require that second kind of energy to restrict it, your dark energy could have killed me just now. That’s why in this life, you are trying to make up for the flaws of your last life by cultivating a new set of eyes. At that time, with two sets of eyes merged together, you will be able to truly control dark energy. Not bad, truly not bad.” Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

“You… Who are you?!” demanded Ye Ming suddenly. This kind of secret was not something that someone like Long Chen could come into contact with. His gaze locked onto the saber in Long Chen’s hands.

“It’s not important who I am. But I must admit, it’s impressive that you are trying to replicate the dark race’s innate divine abilities. At the present time, there are no flaws in this path of yours. This Ten Thousand Dragon Nest has something you need, and very urgently at that, am I right?” Evilmoon continued to pass words through Long Chen.

Suddenly, the world turned dark. Long Chen felt like he had been tossed into an endless hell.

Within this darkness, Long Chen was shocked to find that his own power was being sucked away without his permission.

“I don’t care who you are. Since you know my secret, you must die.”

Ye Ming’s voice resounded through the darkness. A pair of eyes appeared within the darkness, staring at Long Chen.

“Do you see? This is dark energy, something capable of absorbing the power of all other things in this world. This is the strongest divine ability of my dark evil dragon race. This Ye Ming is a god’s reincarnation, and now that he has entered the fourth step of Netherpassage, he has an easy path for himself. Tian Xiezi was only capable of sucking you into his manifestation, but Ye Ming is capable of extending his manifestation. Without needing to suck you inside, you are already within the domain of his manifestation,” transmitted Evilmoon to Long Chen.

The space around him rumbled. Long Chen didn’t know what was happening, but he felt the space around him collapsing and his own energy flying away. Despite doing his best, he couldn’t stop his spiritual yuan from being devoured.

Long Chen slashed Evilmoon in front of him, managing to block a sword from within the darkness.

This attack from Ye Ming wasn’t extraordinarily powerful. However, in that instant, more of his spiritual yuan flew away.

“So, dark energy is very powerful. This is practically unbeatable,” said Long Chen.

“Correct. Dark energy can reach an unbeatable level, but I have yet to achieve full control over it.” Ye Ming’s voice resounded throughout the darkness. “By fixing my final flaws, this entire world will belong to my Corrupt path. Sovereigns, invaders, they will all be nothing before me. Dark energy is the strongest power within this world. Long Chen, I consider you a true expert, so I’ll give you a chance to kill yourself.”

Long Chen smiled and shook his head. “There is no such thing in this world. No matter how great one power is, there will definitely be at least one power that suppresses it. I’ve come to realize how amazing your dark energy is. I also know how strong the dark evil dragon race is.”

Evilmoon had its own goal at this moment. It always thought that Long Chen was looking down on it for losing to a Sovereign. By exposing Ye Ming’s goal, Ye Ming would summon his strongest domain to kill them. Now Long Chen would experience just how strong the dark evil dragon race was.

“Let’s see which one of our worlds is stronger. Five Star Battle Armor!”

Long Chen’s divine ring shuddered, and five stars blazed with light. A majestic aura wildly burst out.
