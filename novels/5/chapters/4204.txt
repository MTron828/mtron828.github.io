Chapter 4193 Original Nirvana Scripture

When Long Chen and Bai Shishi arrived at the second floor of the palace, they were greeted by the presence of more than ten individuals, all of whom belonged to the senior generation. Amongst them were Bai Zhantang and the other vice palace master.

However, these elders paid no attention to Long Chen and his companions as they arrived. The former were already deeply engrossed in a meditative trance, fully immersed in the profound immortal characters inscribed upon the bone steles.

At this moment, Long Chen found that Bai Zhantang’s aura had reached the innate Heaven Venerate realm.

In the state where he had forgotten himself and everything else, except for what he was comprehending from the bone stele, he couldn’t conceal his aura. Thus, a powerful pressure exuded from him, one that was several times greater than an ordinary innate Heaven Venerate.

“How can this be?”

Long Chen was taken aback. During his time at the academy, he had never sensed this. Bai Zhantang had always appeared to be an Immortal King. Even if he suppressed his power on purpose, at most he could be a World King.

Just how much time had passed? When did he become an innate Heaven Venerate? Was he like Long Chen’s grandfather and had suppressed his power?

Bai Shishi’s mother simply smiled and didn’t say anything in response to Long Chen’s shock. As for Bai Shishi, she was walking over to a bone stele.

This bone stele had golden immortal characters carved into it, and Long Chen could sense the terrifying metal energy fluctuations coming from it.

Bai Shishi was instantly drawn to it. The next moment, before Long Chen even said anything, Huo Linger and Lei Linger ran out in the form of two excited girls. Just as they were about to cry out, Long Chen hastily covered their mouths.

Long Chen then pointed at the people who were in meditative states and gestured to both of them to stay silent. They couldn’t cause a ruckus here.

Huo Linger and Lei Linger obediently nodded, and only then did Long Chen release them. The two of them immediately ran to separate bone steles and started comprehending them, following the same practice as everyone else in the room.

“Your spirits are amazing.” Bai Shishi’s mother was amazed by Lei Linger and Huo Linger. She could see that they were a fire spirit and a lightning spirit. Despite her wealth of experience, having encountered many stronger spirits, she had never come across any with such remarkable intelligence. The level of intelligence these two displayed was approaching that of the human race, a phenomenon that should have been inherently impossible. If she didn’t personally see it, she wouldn’t believe it.

“They aren’t my spirits, they’re my little sisters,” corrected Long Chen with a slight smile.

Lei Linger and Huo Linger were raised by him. So, he had never viewed them as servants, but rather as cherished members of his own family.

Bai Shishi’s mother didn’t mind his correction. She then said, “You should start as well. There’s not much time left. This is your greatest chance to improve before the Sage King Convention.”

“Senior, you go ahead. I can sense a stronger summon. It’s not on this level,” said Long Chen.

Bai Shishi’s mother was startled. “You want to go to the third level?”

Long Chen nodded. “Yes. The summon is stronger from there. This junior will take his leave.”

Long Chen bid farewell and went off to the next staircase. He quickly vanished within it.

Watching as he left, Bai Shishi’s mother was filled with shock.

“He can touch even higher secrets of the Heavenly Daos while in the Immortal King realm? Can it be that he is the destined one? The one to change the final board?”

Long Chen didn’t know what Bai Shishi’s mother was thinking. All he knew was that there was a stronger summon up there.Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

This time, there were no illusions when he stepped onto the staircase. Everything was normal. After ninety-nine steps, he reached the third level, also the final level of the High Firmament Palace.

BOOM!

The moment he stepped onto the third floor, a terrifying pressure attacked him, almost sending him flying.

Long Chen felt like an entire world was pressing down on him, creaking his body. Long Chen was startled. After that, he took a deep breath, and golden dragon scales covered his body.

With the Dragon King Battle Armor on, most of that terrifying pressure was instantly mitigated.

Long Chen walked in step by step. When he passed the gates, he saw the palace master’s large figure.

This level only had three bone steles and a lone figure in addition to Long Chen. The palace master stood before one of the bone steles, deep in meditation, resembling an immovable giant statue.

“The palace master is actually this terrifying. This is only his most ordinary aura, but it has such a terrifying pressure.”

Long Chen was shocked. When a person was in their meditative state, their aura should be calm. And when most experts fought, they would raise their auras to the peak in preparation for a high-intensity battle.

Normally, they would keep their auras suppressed to avoid making others uncomfortable. Being in a meditative state returned their auras to a natural state.

However, the palace master’s natural aura actually exuded such a terrifying pressure. If he was in his battle state, Long Chen couldn’t imagine just how powerful he would be. It seemed that Long Chen had still underestimated him.

“Could it be that the palace master has stepped into the Eternal realm?” guessed Long Chen. Otherwise, how could he give off such terrifying pressure? It was many times stronger than other innate Heaven Venerates.

Bai Zhantang’s pressure had been strong enough. But in front of the palace master, he paled in comparison.

Long Chen didn’t dare to disturb him as he headed toward the three bone steles. He could feel two bone steles calling to him. One of them was the one that the palace master was facing at the moment.

“Dragon bone stele?”

When Long Chen got closer to the bone steles, he was shocked to see that this bone stele was made from a dragon bone. Although the dragon bone’s power had been locked by the immortal characters, Long Chen immediately sensed it when he got closer.

“No wonder I have such a feeling,” thought Long Chen. He had dragon blood flowing through his veins, cultivated the Dragon Soul Body Forging Art, and possessed the dragon race’s divine abilities. It would be strange if he didn’t feel a resonance with it.

“Perhaps what’s carved on top of it is related to the dragon race. However, it’s not the one resonating the strongest with me.”

Long Chen then turned to the other bone stele. Looking at this one, he saw that there were very few immortal characters on it.

Other bone steles had millions of immortal characters carved densely on top of it. However, this one only had a few dozen immortal characters.

Even so, every single one of these characters was extremely complex, akin to totems. When Long Chen got closer to it, his head turned blank as he actually recognized two characters.

“Nirvana Scripture!”

Long Chen knew some second-generation Jiuli immortal characters but not even one first-generation Jiuli immortal character. There was even less to say about the original Jiuli immortal characters.

However, for some reason, he recognized these characters. It was like these characters had been carved into his soul.

Buzz.

When Long Chen got closer, those characters seemed to come to life. In the next instant, his surroundings transformed, and he found himself in a world of fire.
