Chapter 3438 Let’s Talk Nicely

So many World Kings had joined forces to attack a single Divine Lord that had just advanced. If that information spread, it would shock countless people.

Long Chen had killed the hopes for their futures, so these World Kings were crazy with rage. All their faces were twisted with fury.

As dozens of World Kings attacked at once, heaven and earth twisted and spacetime was locked shut. With nowhere to go, Long Chen was instantly caught in a sure-death scenario.

However, Long Chen wasn’t the slightest bit worried. In front of all these attacks, he simply rested the Minghong Saber on his shoulder, seemingly having given up on resisting and wishing to die.

Just then, a screen of light appeared around Long Chen, and it had countless stars flickering within it just like an entire star-field.

Those World Kings’ attacks landed on the light screen, causing it to quiver ever so slightly. With a few ripples, those attacks seemed to be pebbles that fell into the sea, vanishing without a trace.

“What?!”

These World Kings were shocked. They had never witnessed such a thing.

“Ah, how regretful. I was lacking just a little bit.” Long Chen looked through the screen of light and at the heavily wounded hall master. He then sighed, shaking his head regretfully.

To put it frankly, he was unable to fully control his new power. When he attacked, there were large fluctuations that showed off his intent. That was why the hall master had escaped his death.

Long Chen’s dissatisfied expression at having failed to kill the hall master left the experts present even more stunned. Long Chen had just advanced to the Divine Lord realm but had managed to heavily wound the Sacred Pill Hall’s master. After this battle, his name would spread far and wide. But he still wasn’t happy with that.VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

After this battle, no one would be able to question the High Firmament Academy’s decision about making him a dean. If others weren’t present, Long Chen would have managed to kill the Sacred Pill Hall’s master. His power was definitely enough to be the dean of a branch academy.

Long Chen felt a bit regretful. His main target had been the eighth prince, but his second target was the hall master. They were the ones he had to kill to avenge the nine star heir.

Regretfully, there were too many people in the surroundings, and he had only had one chance. It was such a pity that he hadn’t managed to succeed and could only leave a heavy wound on him.

However, he had destroyed the Auspicious Cloud Prefecture, exterminating the foundation of the Sacred Pill Hall and killing millions of Lord Brahma’s followers in this base. He had also destroyed his divine statue. If that nine star heir knew these things, he would definitely be able to smile in the nine springs.

Also, the hall master was already old, and his Blood Qi had started to decline. As Long Chen’s attack had wounded his core, it was already impossible for him to fully recover afterward. There was even danger of his realm falling.

Once his realm fell, his longevity would instantly reach its limit. In any case, he wouldn’t be able to live much longer. This attack had taken half of his life at least.

“Fine, killing you now would be meaningless. It would be better for you to stay alive so that you can beg forgiveness from Divine Venerate Brahma. Tell him how you smashed apart his statue. If you don’t explain yourself well, I trust that Lord Brahma will punish you properly.” Long Chen smiled sinisterly at the pale hall master who was rapidly consuming medicinal pills to suppress his wounds.

Hearing that, the hall master coughed up more blood. He grew listless. At this moment, his assistants were horrified and hastily sealed his aura with their divine power, having him fall unconscious for now to protect his life.

However, with this, there was an eighty to ninety percent chance that his realm would fall afterward. But if they hadn’t sealed his aura, with his tumultuous emotions, he might very well lose control of his unstable power and explode right here.

They were no fools. If they had let the hall master die, when the questions were asked and the responsibility for this came crashing down, the two of them would have to endure it. But as long as the hall master was still alive, the two of them wouldn’t be blamed too much.

Thus, they definitely couldn’t allow him to die. Even if he lost his realm and lifespan, that was of less importance to them. This was an extreme emergency.

At this moment, the demonic beasts began to repeatedly attack the barrier around Long Chen. The leaders of the Mammoth Divine Elephant, Water Mallard, Golden Barbarian Bull, and Blue Eye Bright Scale races in particular were attacking the most ferociously.

Regretfully, no matter how they attacked, they were unable to break that barrier. Of course it was impossible for them to break it. This barrier was made from the energy of the core of the star-field. In front of this power, their own individual power was like that of ants.

“Actually, there’s no need for you to hate me. If you want to hate someone, you should hate the Sacred Pill Hall. You are nothing more than the Sacred Pill Hall’s pawns. No, you can’t even count as pawns. You are pigs that the Sacred Pill Hall raised. Do you know that the price of the pills they sell you are dozens of times greater, or even a hundred times greater than what the rest of the world sells them for? The Sacred Pill Hall locked you up here and brainwashed you, slowly turning you into their subordinates to fight against nine star heirs. By then, other than the Nine Underworld Hall, there would be an additional force dedicated to killing nine star heirs. You already killed a nine star heir here, so the Sacred Pill Hall will quickly spread recordings of this throughout the world. Then every nine star heir will come here to get vengeance on you. The seeds of enmity will grow until all of you are simply killing each other, and as the pain and hatred pile up, the truth no longer becomes important. If you fools still don’t understand how you are being used by the Sacred Pill Hall, then you are truly so foolish that there is no cure.”

“Absolute nonsense! You are just making up lies!” The two assistant hall masters roared furiously, veins bulging on their foreheads.

Fortunately, they had made their hall master fall unconscious, or if he heard Long Chen’s words, he really might just die from rage.

“Calm down. We’re all just talking nicely. Don’t get so angry.” Long Chen flapped his hand as if he was being a kind elder that mediated things.

“Talking nicely?!”

The two assistant hall masters looked at the destruction around them and the shattered statue of Brahma. They clenched their teeth furiously. After progressing to this point, he urged them to talk nicely? They suddenly felt that they might fall unconscious just like their hall master.

“Ah, fine, I won’t say much more. Your Integral Heaven Star-Field isn’t too far from my Empyrean Heaven Star-Field. In my Empyrean Heaven Star-Field, there is a very trustworthy company called the Huayun Trading Company. You can secretly send people to see how things are there. You can see what the prices of identical products are. Once you see their prices, you’ll learn the difference between a black-hearted scammer and a merchant with integrity,” said Long Chen. He wanted to say more, but the core of the star-field was telling him that she was only able to maintain this barrier for a limited time. Thus, he quickly spat out some facts about the Huayun Trading Company.

Just then, an item came flying out of the wreckage. It actually directly passed through the barrier that protected Long Chen.

It was the Minghong Saber’s sheath. Once the Minghong Saber entered the sheath, Long Chen noticed that it was different from other sabers. It was a complete item with its sheath.

The sheath was two feet thick and was like a shield. Countless blood-colored runes flowed on top of it. Curiously, the pressure that the sheath gave off was even stronger than that of the actual saber.

Long Chen didn’t have time to examine it more closely, and he put away the saber and sheath. “I am Long Chen from the High Firmament Academy’s seventh branch. If anyone wants revenge, come find me. The Empyrean Heaven Star-Field doesn’t have a single power controlling it like the Sacred Pill Hall. We welcome any friends. As for whether you are a friend or foe, it’s up to you.”

“What nonsense! You killed Yuner, repaying kindness with enmity. We can only be enemies!” howled the Lightning Falcon race’s leader.

Long Chen was startled but then laughed. “Then come get revenge. When have I, Long Chen, ever been afraid of anyone?”

Suddenly, the light screen covering Long Chen quivered and he vanished, leaving behind all the wreckage.
