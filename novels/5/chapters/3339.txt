Chapter 3328 Devil World Heavenly Bead

“Long Chen, watch out! That’s a Heavenly Bead of the devil world!”

When that bead appeared, one particular elder of the Heavenly Rainbow Domain shouted. This elder’s seniority was extremely high. Even amongst the other Immortal Kings, he was greatly respected.

“Senior, Long Chen can’t hear you. What is that Heavenly Bead?” asked an Immortal King respectfully.

“It is refined from a star of the devil world and could be considered the same as if the entire Heavenly Rainbow Domain was compressed into a bead. This bead was clearly refined from a flame star, so it was no wonder the Heavenly Rainbow Flame would instantly choose him. It’s definitely related to that bead. Long Chen has to be careful of it! If Mo Yan detonates it, then everyone in that barrier will be turned to ash! Is there any way that we can warn Long Chen?!” explained the elder anxiously.

Of all the experts present, only he knew just how terrifying this bead was. If Mo Yan was pressed, then Long Chen would definitely die.

Hearing that, all the Immortal Kings were shocked. It seemed that the devil race had truly come prepared. They even brought out such a terrifying treasure.

However, there was nothing that they could do. Now that those monsters were going all-out, no other Four Peak disciples could get close to them. Immortal Kings also couldn’t enter.

Within the barrier, Long Chen was fighting experts from all sides. Since the Heavenly Rainbow Flame had chosen him, he had become the target of all their attacks.

The most infuriating thing to those outside the barrier was that even the other human experts inside the barrier were joining in on the attacks against Long Chen. They didn’t have the slightest mercy on Long Chen just because they were fellow humans.

Long Chen’s bone saber danced in the air as he blocked all his attackers. Only after being chosen by the Heavenly Rainbow Flame did he realize that absorbing it was not so simple.

Merging with it required using a certain amount of core energy. During the merger, his combat power would definitely be reduced. It was no wonder that Mo Yan had chosen to hide behind a barrier after being chosen.

These experts seemed to be aware of this, and their attacks rained down on Long Chen, not giving him a chance to absorb it.

If Long Chen didn’t absorb it, the Heavenly Rainbow Flame wouldn’t belong to him. If he did absorb it, his power would drop, and he would definitely die under their attacks.

They attacked crazily, but they weren’t risking their lives against Long Chen. They only wanted to disturb him, making it so he didn’t have a chance to absorb the Heavenly Rainbow Flame. They were waiting for Long Chen to reveal an opening.

However, amongst them, there was one person in particular who stood out. That was Mo Yan. His spear was now emitting devil flames. With every attack, a terrifying divine might exploded.

Mo Yan was truly enraged. He had lost his chance to obtain the Heavenly Rainbow Flame. The preparation of tens of thousands of years, the perfect plan that couldn’t fail, had failed. So, he cast his resentment and rage on Long Chen.

With every single one of his attacks, the world shook. He was the only one going all-out against Long Chen.

Mo Yan roared and once more stabbed his spear forward. Even before his spear reached Long Chen, the flames had condensed into a giant tip that reached Long Chen.

After defending against three consecutive blows, Long Chen’s arm shuddered. The current Mo Yan was truly powerful.

And just as Mo Yan prepared to attack again, the others scattered to avoid being affected. At this moment, Long Chen snorted and slashed his saber repeatedly.Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Long Chen unleashed nine slashes of his saber. Nine saber-images struck the spear, but they were all broken apart by Mo Yan’s spear.

“Long Chen, you’re definitely dead!”

Mo Yan roared and continued to attack with the leftover power of his spear.

BOOM!

When Long Chen’s saber clashed with the spear, a huge explosion rang out. This final blow of his was still unable to stop the spear, so the spear pierced toward Long Chen’s head.

Just then, a lotus mark appeared on Long Chen’s left hand, and he grabbed the head of the spear.

“Die!”

Seeing Long Chen do that, Mo Yan smiled sinisterly. His spear shuddered, its power erupting to blast Long Chen to pieces.

However, at this moment, his expression changed. His Heavenly Bead had popped out of the notch in his spear.

A fist-sized Lei Linger then giggled as she held the Heavenly Bead. After making a face at Mo Yan, she vanished, taking the Heavenly Bead with her.

Without the Heavenly Bead, the flames of his spear instantly dimmed. As his spear was caught in Long Chen’s grasp, that scene left people dumbfounded.

Suddenly, Long Chen shoved the spear toward Mo Yan. When Mo Yan was still stunned, the butt of his own spear slammed into his chest.

Although it was only the butt of his spear, it was backed by Long Chen’s immense power, so it pierced through Mo Yan’s chest. This sudden change made everyone jump.

Just as Long Chen was about to kill him, his sense of danger went off. As a result, he slashed his saber behind him.

A dagger then appeared out of midair, striking the saber. Sparks flew. After that, a figure gradually appeared. It was the Nine Underworld Hall’s Tian Mo.

This distraction allowed Mo Yan to escape his death and take back his spear from Long Chen’s hold.

“Bastard!”

“Traitor!”

“Despicable Nine Star Hunter!”

Seeing Long Chen be interrupted just as he was about to kill Mo Yan, people loudly cursed.

No matter what, shouldn't they first make sure that no outsiders could obtain the Heavenly Rainbow Flame? Even if you wanted to fight for it, you had to wait until Long Chen killed Mo Yan! That was a mortal enemy of the human race.

Now, Mo Yan was enraged. His eyes turned blue with fury. He hadn’t obtained the Heavenly Rainbow Flame, and now even the devil world’s Heavenly Bead was stolen by Long Chen. Was there anyone in this world as unlucky as him?

That Heavenly Bead was a priceless treasure of the devil world and also something that he depended on to cultivate. He was capable of using it all the way until he ascended to the Immortal King realm. Although he had used up some of its power to draw over the Heavenly Rainbow Flame, the remaining energy would still be enough to support him all the way to the Immortal King realm.

“Long Chen, return my Heavenly Bead! I’ll kill you!” Having lost the Heavenly Bead, Mo Yan went completely crazy. His Ten Thousand Devil Diagram began to burn. Now, he was willing to ignite his blood soul power just to increase his power.

The current Mo Yan looked suicidal. If he didn’t kill Long Chen and take back the Heavenly Bead, his future would be over anyway. He truly was a madman now.

“If you don’t want to lose a main force, you should fight together,” said Tian Mo coldly, vanishing back into the void.

His meaning was clear. With a madman like Mo Yan going all-out, it would be easier for everyone to find openings to kill Long Chen.

However, if Mo Yan died and everyone returned to the awkward stalemate where no one was willing to sacrifice themselves, the ultimate winner would be Long Chen. At that time, they would all become stepping stones for Long Chen’s rise to fame and the laughingstocks of their respective domains.

BOOM!

He had just vanished into the void when a lightning spear stabbed through the air, causing the void to explode. Tian Mo was then forced out of the void.

“Of everyone remaining, you will be the first to die!”

With a lightning spear in his left hand and a bone saber in his right hand, Long Chen’s killing intent overflowed as he pointed his weapons at Tian Mo. All the old and new grudges would be settled right here and now.
