Chapter 3580

This was a group of ancient elders. They were doddering, especially the four elders at the front. They were quivering as if they might collapse at any moment.

The four of them had almost reached the limits of their lifespans. They might die at any moment and couldn’t even open their eyes. And yet, they had the face to block Long Chen’s path.

“Dean, this person is the killer of my Heavenly Dragon Divine Armor College’s disciples. For you to protect him like this, how will you give everyone an explanation?” barked one of those elders.

Although he was already old, he still had plenty of qi. His words contained an unquestionable dignity.

“An explanation? That will have to wait until after I finish greeting my guest. It’s not the time yet,” said Xue Yifan, still smiling even as these elders blocked his path.

“Greeting a guest? A murderer counts as a guest?” sneered another elder, his voice full of dissatisfaction. It seemed that they didn’t even place Xue Yifan, the dean, in their eyes.

Guo Ran couldn’t help cursing, “You old fogey, who is a murderer?! You better speak more politely! All of you with your canes, do you think that you’re some big-shots?! Do you believe me when I say that if you anger my boss, he’ll kill you, cover you in a coffin, and bury you in the earth?! Your entire family will come and cry as you are put in your place.”

The current Guo Ran could truly be said to have guts big enough to cover the heavens. As long as Long Chen was present, he didn’t know what fear was. Now, he cursed anyone that he wanted.

“Brazen creature! You dare to insult us?!”

Guo Ran’s curse instantly enraged countless people. After all, those four elders at the front had even higher seniority than the dean.

Those people had never viewed him very favorably. After all, he wasn’t a native born in this place. Although Guo Ran said that he was an ascender, the Alldevil Star-Field didn’t have many ascenders, so people always had suspicions about his true origins.

Despite Guo Ran’s astonishing talent, he was suppressed all over. This was done with the tacit approval of these higher-ups. They looked down on Guo Ran, a person with no background. Guo Ran’s growth was too fast, so wasn’t that saying that everyone else was an idiot?

“Fuck you! Who do you think you are? What are people that are halfway into the grave so arrogant about? You don’t even have the slightest ability left. I don’t see you going onto the battlefield, but you’re all so arrogant in your little den! If you have some almighty ability, why don’t you quell the unrest outside? Help the Alldevil Star-Field pass through its crisis!” said Guo Ran disdainfully.

For over a year, Guo Ran had been very cautious and prudent, not daring to say too much. He had been afraid that one wrong word would give them something that they could use against him.

But now, he had Long Chen to support him, so he wasn’t afraid of anyone. All the emotions that he had been holding back for so long were all unleashed. He didn’t place anyone in his eyes any longer.

The four elders were so enraged that their bodies shook. “Come-”

“Leave. Whatever matters there are, they can wait until I finish with my guest. If anyone dares to block us again, don’t blame me for not caring about your feelings,” shouted Xue Yifan suddenly.

This cold shout from Xue Yifan stunned everyone, especially those elders. In all their memories, Xue Yifan had only ever been amiable. In all their lives, they had never seen his face go cold. But today, they did.

Those people instantly fell silent and were all scared. As soon as Xue Yifan started walking again, they opened a path.

Long Chen didn’t even look at them. He strolled past them alongside Xue Yifan. As for Guo Ran, he smiled disdainfully at them and stuck close behind Long Chen.

Xie Qianqian, Tu Hu, and the others were originally following behind them. However, they came to a stop at this time. That was because the dean’s palace was up ahead. They weren’t qualified to enter that place.

However, as soon as they paused, they sensed countless hostile gazes looking their way like sharp swords. Feeling a chill, they pretended like they didn’t see anything.

A group of three people entered the palace, and no one else came to block them again. Inside the spacious palace, the three of them sat lotus style. Guo Ran obediently sat beside Long Chen.

Xue Yifan then looked at Guo Ran. Guo Ran suddenly felt a slight chill and hastily said, “Dean, there’s no need to ask me to stay. I’ll definitely follow my boss.”

“What a pity, a real pity!” sighed Xue Yifan.

“What is a pity?” asked Guo Ran.

“If dean Long Chen came one or two years later, a hero might have arisen within my Heavenly Dragon Divine Armor College.” Xue Yifan shook his head regretfully. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Long Chen was startled. “Was senior planning on turning Guo Ran into the leader of the Heavenly Dragon Divine Armor College?”

Guo Ran himself was startled. His reaction wasn’t as quick as Long Chen, so he looked at Xue Yifan questioningly.

Xue Yifan bitterly smiled. “The very first day Guo Ran came, I already noticed him. This child’s innate talent and comprehension ability are astounding. He likes to walk the novel paths that can lead to unexpected successes, paths that his predecessors didn’t dare to even think of. His potential is limitless.”

“Dean, you wouldn’t be saying these things only because my boss came, would you? I feel like I have no home in the Heavenly Dragon Divine Armor College. I’m targeted from all sides. If it weren’t for senior apprentice-sister Xie Qianqian looking after me, I don’t know how many times I would have been conned to death. If you really viewed me so highly, why didn’t you promote me?” asked Guo Ran.

Xue Yifan shook his head and didn’t reply. It was Long Chen who said, “A heavenly general descends with a great mission on their shoulders. They must first endure pain. They must work until their bones collapse, starve until they are skin and bones. An expert is not raised, it is someone who suddenly explosively grows under immense pressure. Senior can be said to have shown careful consideration. I will thank you in Guo Ran’s place.”

Long Chen looked at the elder. He felt that this elder might very well be an incredibly wise person, so he didn’t doubt his words.

“I was previously very curious about why this child Guo Ran has such good talent but none of the arrogance of an expert. So many people bullied you, suppressed you, and schemed against you, but you just kept enduring, not fighting back. I was always waiting, waiting for the day that you exploded. It is only now that dean Long Chen has come that I understand. Although you are powerful, you feel too dependent on him. You have never thought about being an independent supreme expert. You have never thought of being the shield that blocks the wind and rain,” said Xue Yifan, looking at Guo Ran regretfully.

Guo Ran was stunned. It was only now that he realized that the dean had always been looking after him.

Thinking back carefully, it seemed that there were several times when he had almost died, only to ‘luckily’ get out alive. So it wasn’t actually luck but the dean’s secret help.

“Dean, I’m sorry. I have disappointed you. Thank you for saving my life.” Guo Ran was someone who knew to repay kindness. He respectfully kowtowed to the dean. “It can’t be blamed on me. If you have to blame someone, blame my boss for being too strong! With him, I never have to worry about anything. In this lifetime, I don’t have such grand goals. My own goal is to be right behind my boss showing off. Boss will show off big, and I’ll show off small. It’s safe, quick, and painless,” said Guo Ran without blushing in the slightest.

These words enraged the dean to the point of laughing. Not knowing whether to laugh or cry, he said, “I, Xue Yifan, have never misjudged people in this lifetime. But now I am old. I actually misjudged you. I was actually hoping for you to be a hero like Xia Guhong, leading the Alldevil Star-Field onto its proper path. It seems that I was overthinking things.”

“Xia Guhong? Are you talking about big brother Xia Guhong, the monarch of the Grand Xia Nation?” asked Long Chen hastily, feeling surprised.
