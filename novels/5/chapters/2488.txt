Chapter 2478 A Wild Dragon’s Power

Long Chen was precisely waiting for Mo Nian to arrive. For him to only arrive at this time must mean that he had taken the wrong path, costing him quite a bit of time.

With Mo Nian here, Long Chen no longer had any misgivings. His azure dragon essence blood began to fill his body with power.

“Hey, wait a minute. Long Chen, when did you become so classless? You’re going to bully a child?” Mo Nian looked at the short Zhao Ritian in confusion.

This was definitely an act. He had to have noticed that Zhao Ritian was a dwarf but still called him a child. With just a word, Mo Nian had stabbed Zhao Ritian where it hurt.

Zhao Ritian had been born with his metal body. Due to awakening his talent too early, his body was unable to grow like others. That was the source of the darkness in his heart.

“Die!” Zhao Ritian furiously pointed a finger, and an arrow shot at Mo Nian.

“Watch out!” warned Long Chen, worried that Mo Nian would underestimate Zhao Ritian’s power.

BANG!

Zhao Ritian’s arrow exploded in midair as if it had been struck by an invisible arrow. Fragments shot out in every direction.

Quite a few fragments landed in the ground, causing lumps of metal to start growing.

Mo Nian exclaimed, “Damn, you can turn things into metal? Not bad! Little fellow, are you interested in opening a blacksmith shop with me?”

Mo Nian had not witnessed this kind of power before, but his mouth did not spare Zhao Ritian. He managed to turn Zhao Ritian’s innate divine ability into a tool for making a living.

“You dare to blaspheme me? I’ll kill you!” Zhao Ritian’s eyes turned scarlet.

“Shortie, your opponent is me.” Long Chen blocked Zhao Ritian’s path.

“Die!” Zhao Ritian was further enraged, and his hands clawed toward Long Chen as if wanting to tear him apart.

His claws reached Long Chen instantaneously, but before they could touch him, a hand struck him in the face from a strange angle, causing his metallic face to distort. He smashed into the ground.

A wave of earth shocked the experts that had arrived. Zhao Ritian’s head had been flattened by Long Chen. It no longer looked like a head. Instead, it was like a pot lid.

The power of that slap was so immense that others couldn’t believe it. Even Long Chen stared at his palm in surprise.

In their fight, Zhao Ritian had been acting like he was merely even with Long Chen as bait to make others join forces against him. That way, he would have a reason to kill them all.

However, Long Chen had not used his full power either. He had not even displayed his face-slapping divine art. That was because he was worried about Zhao Ritian going crazy and starting a slaughter before Mo Nian arrived.

Now that Mo Nian was here, Long Chen didn’t need to worry about the others. He directly used his slap. This technique, which was originally just a humiliating blow to the mind, had now become a peerless attack. There probably weren’t many people capable of receiving it.

Mo Nian, Nangong Zuiyue, and Beitang Rushuang were all startled at Zhao Ritian’s current appearance. He no longer appeared human. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Zhao Ritian’s head tottered. Stars were spinning in his mind. Although he didn’t have a body of flesh, this slap had been truly vicious, causing him to temporarily lose his senses. If it was another expert, not even a trace of their skull would remain.

“Hahaha!” Long Chen laughed excitedly. This was power, true power.

The power of the dragon was used through the flesh and blood. By using his spiritual yuan to control it, it naturally grew sluggish. With the dragon king’s pointers, Long Chen basked in the sensation of being in control of such immense power.

The other experts were stunned because the current Long Chen had yet to even bring out his signature technique, his divine ring. Just by using the power of his physical body, he had unleashed such terrifying power.

“Long Chen definitely isn’t human. How could a human possess such a physical body?” guessed one of those experts.

Amongst everyone present, the one who was the most shocked was Feng Fei. Only she was aware of just how monstrous Zhao Ritian’s Million Metal Body was. However, that body was like dough in front of Long Chen.

“Very good, Long Chen. You’ve managed to fully enrage me.”

Zhao Ritian’s flattened head returned to its normal state. A harsh light shone in his eyes.

“That has to be an undying body!” A chill ran through the experts witnessing this. Zhao Ritian seemed to have no weaknesses. Even with his head flattened, he wasn’t injured. Fighting an undying body like that would make a person give up hope.

Zhao Ritian sinisterly said, “Back in the Immemorial Path, I think I recall that you mentioned your name, but I’m not in the habit of remembering other people’s names. I didn’t even recall it when I heard your name. But I’ll remember it now. You’re the first one qualified to be killed by me ever since I came from the battlefield against the other races.”

The earth began to shake. The ground suddenly split open, and a torrent of mountain peaks began to spurt out of the ground like bamboo after a spring rain.

Those mountains were all different colors, but they had a metallic luster to them. They seemed made out of metal.

“This is…” Everyone’s jaws dropped. They realized that these mountains were solid objects made of immortal and divine metals.

“Damn, ignoring how strong this shorty Zhao is, his metal controlling powers are enough to make him become the richest man alive!” Mo Nian was also stunned. Looking at the endless precious metals coming out of the ground, his eyes reddened.

Wouldn’t someone with this power have an endless supply of divine materials? Zhao Ritian’s body was an unending source of treasures.

Nangong Zuiyue shook her head. “That is impossible. His own ability makes it so that he has to exhaust endless resources just to activate it. The legends say that the Million Metal Body requires all kinds of materials to be absorbed once the body’s innate divine abilities are awakened. The more metal energy he absorbs, the stronger he grows. The amount of resources he has absorbed has to be unimaginable. Even if an entire world’s power was gathered just for him, it still might not be enough to feed him. He is most likely forced to constantly wander through worlds gathering their metal energy for himself. Perhaps only the divine families have the ability to raise such a terrifying monster. We are now within his manifestation. This place has become his world, a world full of metal energy.”

“What are you talking about? The dragon corpse and altar are still there. How is this place his manifestation?” asked Mo Nian.

Nangong Zuiyue answered, “As long as there is metal within the world, he is capable of assimilating it. These mountains were brought forth by his energy. He can use their energy as he pleases. Do you see the metallic mountains behind him? Those aren’t physical objects but his manifestation. His manifestation’s power has merged with reality, turning him into the ruler of this world. Long Chen is correct. This person is incredibly vicious and sinister. He was acting weak in hopes that we would help Long Chen, giving him enough reason to kill us all. Due to awakening his divine ability too early, he was stuck in his dwarf form. His heart grew twisted then, resulting in this nature. I can see the brutality in his eyes.”

Nangong Zuiyue was worried. For such a brutal person to appear amongst the divine families was not a good thing. Such a person could no longer be judged according to a normal person’s logic. His twisted heart made it almost impossible to work together with him.

“No need to worry. Long Chen will definitely beat him to death,” said Mo Nian with a smile. He wasn’t worried at all.

Nangong Zuiyue shook her head. “The Million Metal Body is a kind of undying body. His body has no weak points, and his energy comes from the world and his manifestation. No matter how strong a person is, how are they supposed to fight against an entire world? Even if Long Chen can fight with Zhao Ritian evenly for a time, Zhao Ritian’s energy will replenish infinitely, while Long Chen’s energy is slowly ground down… We have to be ready to help as soon as Long Chen can’t endure any longer. The first thing to do is break his manifestation.”

Nangong Zuiyue's steady nature had her preparing a backup plan. Zhao Ritian was absolutely terrifying.

Just as she was speaking, the terrain continued to change. The world had been completely transformed. The altar was now surrounded by mountains of metal, and this place had become a world of metal.

A metallic ringing was constantly present. It was as if the very air was being infected.

“Long Chen, your close female friend is worried about you being beaten by that shortie Zhao. I told her that he isn’t a match for you, and that you could crush him just by taking off your pants and pissing on him. I’ve finished bragging for you, so don’t turn me into a liar.” Mo Nian cupped his hands over his mouth and shouted loudly.

Zhao Ritian’s hair stood on end from fury. His body transformed, going from black to every color of the rainbow.

The mountains shuddered and space froze. Everyone present felt like they were bound by countless invisible chains. They couldn’t move.

They were appalled. Zhao Ritian was targeting Long Chen, but they were still affected to this extent. Then the pressure that Long Chen was under must be unimaginable.

“Taste my fist!” Zhao Ritian unleashed a punch, his fist shining with multicolored divine light. This was a fist that contained the power to destroy heaven and earth.
