Chapter 4136 Heaven Raising Spear

“He actually reached that barrier!”

The tsunami-like pressure coming from the Great Desolate Winged Devil’s corpse caused Xue Qingkuang’s expression to change.

“Master, what can we do? Even you can’t reach that place!”

They had been here for over ten days, using the pressure here to stimulate their devil qi. But Xue Qingkuang had another goal: he wanted to obtain this corpse’s devil core at all costs. Even if it had been dead for countless years, as an Eternal expert, for its physical body to be so perfectly preserved, its devil core must still remain.ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

If Xue Qingkuang could obtain its devil core, then he would gain its invaluable experience of advancing to the Eternal realm. That was of incalculable value to countless experts of the devil race.

However, after trying so many times, Xue Qingkuang was unable to get past that final barrier. He couldn’t get closer to the corpse.

Now, he could only watch as Long Chen reached that barrier and walked straight through, causing him to feel shocked and enraged.

“He has the aura of the true dragon on him. Perhaps that’s the reason why he doesn’t feel the pressure as much. But we, despite being part of the same devil race but from different branches, endure even more intense pressure.” Xue Qingkuang clenched his teeth furiously.

“Then what can we do? Should we all attack him together? We cannot allow him to blaspheme the Devil Saint!”

“All of us are under multiple times the pressure, so we’re at too much of a disadvantage. We can only wait and see,” said Xue Qingkuang.

In truth, Xue Qingkuang was angrier than anyone else here, but he understood that the pressure they faced exceeded what Long Chen and his companions were enduring. If a fight were to break out, they would not win.

Furthermore, he also wanted to see just what would happen after Long Chen got close to the corpse. Would there be more barriers? Or would he be cursed by the corpse?

It had to be known that even him, with the bloodline of the devil race, had to be extremely careful. One mistake and he would die trying to get the devil core. Thus, he refused to believe that Long Chen could gain anything from this trip.

At this moment, Guo Ran and the others were not following Long Chen. They were in their original locations, patiently watching.

After all, this place was the limit for the Dragonblood warriors. Their movements would also be extremely restricted if they were to fight here.

With the Blood Devil race eyeing things from the side, they didn’t dare to be careless. They were on constant guard against their sneak attack.

After reaching this point, Long Chen’s body felt extremely heavy, and each of his steps caused the earth to shudder. It felt like he was carrying an entire world on his shoulder.

To counteract the pressure, the dragon blood in his body began to circulate rapidly. Without Long Chen needing to do anything, the dragon-shaped runes in his body automatically awakened, resisting the terrifying pressure for him.

“The dragon power really is helping me block a portion of the devil pressure.” As Long Chen advanced, the pressure grew, but the dragon-shaped runes throughout his body were constantly lighting up, resisting the devil pressure. Although it was difficult, Long Chen managed to keep advancing.

Long Chen reached the corpse and found its wings lying flat on the ground, so he confidently stepped onto one of its wings.

Seeing this, the Blood Devil race’s experts were incensed. Long Chen dared to step on their Devil Saint’s corpse. What a blasphemy!

However, when Long Chen did step on its wings, devil qi erupted and climbed on top of his foot like ink.

“Not good! It’s the winged devil’s curse!”

In the distance, Xu Jianxiong and Uncle Tree’s expressions changed. They had been keeping a close eye on Long Chen the entire time, but they could not communicate with Long Chen through the barrier. They could only worry.

It had to be known that this was an Eternal existence. Although it was already dead, it would not permit others to blaspheme its corpse.

“Hahaha, die, ignorant human!”

Upon seeing that ink-like qi wrap around Long Chen’s feet, the Blood Devil race’s experts laughed. This was the curse of the devil race. When their experts died, their curse runes would automatically target anyone who dared to get close to their bodies.

This was a kind of self-protection mechanism. That way, if their bodies landed in the hands of their enemies, their innate runes wouldn’t be stolen, and it also prevented their enemies from stepping on their corpses. It seemed that only people from the same race as them could avoid this curse. But Xue Qingkuang was from a different branch of the devil race, so even he would be taking a risk dismantling its corpse.

The Blood Devil race’s experts all knew of this rule, so they had been waiting for this moment. As they expected, Long Chen really did foolishly fall for this move.

The black ink crawled up Long Chen’s legs like millions of demonic tadpoles. However, when they reached his knees, Long Chen let out a cold snort.

Golden flames suddenly burst out of his body, turning that ink into smoke upon contact.

“What?!”

When the people around saw that scene, they were shocked shitless. Just what kind of flame could burn the power of a curse? Furthermore, it was the curse of an Eternal expert!

“What kind of flame is that?!” Cries of disbelief rang out.

“The flame is golden and reserved, and there is an explosiveness within its sacred might, a will to destroy along with rebirth. Why does that sound so similar to the legendary Sun Flame?” exclaimed a Heaven Venerate outside the barrier.

“Its aura, color, and texture are all very similar. But the Sun Flame is ranked sixth on the Heavenly Flame Rankings. If that really was the Sun Flame, it wouldn’t give off such little pressure.”

“That’s right, the Sun Flame possesses a destructive will, as well as the power to give birth to all life. If his flame was the Sun Flame, it wouldn’t be so weak.”

“He’s only an Immortal King. There’s no way he can control the wild Sun Flame. Actually, not even its flame seed could be controlled with his realm.”

All the flames on the Heavenly Flame Rankings had their own characteristics. Some were warm, some were cold. But the Sun Flame was known as a wild flame.

The Sun Flame was notorious for being the most challenging flame to control. According to legend, taming it required sheer brute force. It was said that even the most basic Sun Flame seed could only be harnessed by an innate Heaven Venerate or higher. There existed no technique to subdue it; only raw power would suffice.

Thus, the appearance of this golden flame was particularly shocking to everyone. It was very similar to the legendary Sun Flame, yet people were also unable to believe that it was the Sun Flame.

“But if it isn’t the Sun Flame, how can it burn an Eternal existence’s curse?”

“Hmm…”

This question stumped everyone. They had suspicions, but they refused to believe that an Immortal King could control the Sun Flame as that would topple all common knowledge.

Just as they were discussing it, Long Chen had climbed up the corpse’s wing, heading straight up its back and arriving in front of that spear.

In front of everyone’s shocked gazes, he delivered a powerful punch toward the spear.
