Chapter 4395 Army of the Feather Race

Long Chen caught the Triple Supreme of the devil beast race and slammed him into the ground.

A lightning platform appeared just before he landed, protecting the ground. Upon impact, he lost his ability to retain human form and transformed into a three-meter blood-colored crocodile. This one blow caused all of his scales to shatter, and he passed out.

The crowd was dumbfounded. A Triple Supreme was still nothing in front of this black-robed man?

Long Chen intentionally looked at Little Crane. Seeing that she was fine and seemingly excited, Long Chen was at ease.

He retrieved a pair of pliers and pried open the crocodile's mouth. Afterward, he seized a tooth and yanked it out, causing the unconscious crocodile to miserably shriek.

"Shut up!" Long Chen admonished, delivering a direct smack to the crocodile's head, causing it to once again lose consciousness.

Long Chen was very efficient with his pliers and quickly pulled out seventy-two teeth. The crocodile was twitching in pain, but unable to make any sound.

To everyone’s surprise, while the crocodile itself appeared sinister and ugly, his teeth were like triangular jewels. Runes and light flowed within them.

Long Chen then took out a needle and a string and poked holes into these teeth. Each tooth was about the size of a fingernail, and he quickly linked them together into a necklace.

“Wow, so pretty!” Little Crane cried out excitedly upon seeing that necklace.

“Little Crane, this was made of his teeth. Aren’t you afraid?” asked Long Chen with a smile.

“I’m not afraid! Who knows how many people he will harm with these teeth? But if I keep them, he can’t bite anyone! But Big Brother Long Chen, are you really going to give this beautiful necklace to me?”

Seeing that she felt no taboo over this, Long Chen laughed and hung the necklace around her neck.

A faint divine light emanated from the extracted tooth, casting a gentle glow upon Little Crane's enchanting face. Like a little fairy from a wonderland, her long eyelashes fluttered, and her black and white eyes sparkled with delight and excitement.

“Little Crane, you really are beautiful. When you grow up, you’ll definitely be even more beautiful.” Long Chen looked at her pamperingly.

“When I grow up, I’ll marry Big Brother Long Chen!” Little Crane giggled.

Long Chen chuckled along. Considering Little Crane's long lifespan, by the time she grew up, he would likely be long gone.

Nevertheless, the innocence in a child's words bore no harm. Perhaps she didn't even grasp the concept of marriage.

Seeing Long Chen and Little Crane talking and laughing while standing beside that Triple Supreme, all the experts here felt a chill.

When did the human race give rise to such a terrifyingly domineering existence? He had torn apart the limbs and wings of the Feather race’s experts and had left a Triple Supreme of the devil beast race half-beaten, even extracting his teeth for a necklace. He was definitely a vicious character.

Before this, numerous experts of the other races had been feeling uncomfortable to see Long Chen act so arrogant. However, when that Triple Supreme was beaten, their expressions transformed into shock. Any inclination they had to join in was instantly crushed.

Just then, the world started to rumble, and terrifying pressures surged. Countless figures could be seen flying over.

“It’s the Feather race’s experts!”

“Heavens, there are so many Triple Supremes!”

“Not just that, there are half-step Eternals—no, that’s a true Eternal!”

When everyone saw those figures, whether it was the human race or the other races, they were all shocked.

The Feather race had brought an army of tens of thousands of experts, with the majority being elite World Kings.

There were over ten Triple Supremes amongst them, accompanied by dozens of half-step Eternals and one elder with Eternal Qi swirling around him. He was a true Eternal.

“The Feather race’s power really is terrifying. They could gather this many experts at once? No wonder the other races don’t wish to provoke them.”

The Feather race was infamous for their tyranny and unreasonableness. While each of them was individually powerful, the primary source of people's fear lay in their sheer numbers. With their people scattered everywhere, a single call could mobilize an army of tens of thousands.

When they arrived, the experts in the city instantly fled, leaving this ancient city empty. After all, they were all afraid of being implicated.

“Hahaha, that brat of the human race is done for!” The experts of the other races laughed in delight.

“It’s probably not just him. The fury of the Feather race will spread to the other humans as killing him won’t quell their anger. Hehe, this is interesting,” said one of them as they glanced at the frightened humans.

Some human experts had a bad feeling and stealthily slipped away, only to find themselves surrounded by other experts of other races.

“Just watch. Your people provoked this calamity, so you’ll need to accept the consequences,” sneered those experts.

“You…!”

The human experts were both shocked and infuriated. Was this an execution of the human race? Yet, surrounded by many experts from other races, they didn’t dare to resist.

“Are you afraid?” whispered Long Chen to Little Crane.

Little Crane was clearly a bit nervous, but she firmly said, “A bit, but I know Big Brother Long Chen will protect me. You’ll scare away those bad people!”Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

“What if I kill them? Will you no longer like me?” probed Long Chen.

“Of course not. I know Big Brother Long Chen only kills bad people. Killing them will prevent the good people from being harmed,” replied Little Crane.

Hearing her response, Long Chen was startled. It seemed that Little Crane understood more than he thought. Or was it just what her father and mother had taught her?

“Bally,” Long Chen called and looked at the spherical lifeform. The name of Bally was something that Little Crane had given it.

“Yes, master?” asked the spherical lifeform.

“Protect my little sister,” said Long Chen.

“Don’t worry, even if I have to die, I will protect young miss!” swore the spherical lifeform.

Just then, the Feather race's experts completed the encirclement of the entire city, and their Eternal expert gazed at Long Chen. He inquired, "Just him?"

The people by his side were the ones whom Long Chen had delimbed and dewinged. They nodded, their eyes brimming with hatred.

“Yu Feng, kill him, but don’t harm the girl beside him. She’s a bit strange. Perhaps she’ll be useful to us.” The Eternal expert turned to an expert whose face was filled with arrogance.

The expert called Yu Feng nodded. His wings quivered, and he instantly vanished. The space in front of Long Chen twisted, and a claw reached out of that space, going straight toward Long Chen’s neck.
