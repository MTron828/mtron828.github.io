“It’s that amazing?” Long Chen was stunned.

The High Firmament Academy’s number one branch was the strongest of all the branches. It was ten times larger than the head academy, and the building conditions were a hundred times superior. However, no matter how large or impressive it was, the head academy remained the foundation. Otherwise, according to the secular world’s logic, the number one branch would have become the head academy already.

Many people had proposed moving the head academy’s foundation stone to the first academy. However, history proved just how right they had been not to do so. In the primal chaos war, the flames of war were fiercest in the Sovereign Emperor Heaven.

Even with the first academy’s power, they couldn’t survive that battle of gods. Fortunately, the head academy’s foundation stone was linked with all its branches. As long as the head academy’s foundation stone remained undamaged, the foundation stone of the branches could not be destroyed.

As long as the foundation stone remained, the worlds established through it remained as well. Bai Letian and the others had mobilized the full power of the academy to reclaim the first academy due to the countless treasures left behind.

The High Firmament World was one such relic. Its laws had remained operational the entire time, accumulating the energy of countless years. Now, this accumulated energy was exceptionally terrifying.

Hearing that, Long Chen was tempted. While he had agreed to go with Mo Nian, he also wanted to lead the Dragonblood Legion’s tribulation. That way, they would obtain the maximum benefits from their tribulation.

However, he had no idea where Mo Nian was. The latter wouldn’t appear before the Brahma Pill Valley’s Heavenly Flame Devil Domain opened, and Long Chen had no way of communicating with him. After all, he didn’t spend much time aboveground.

If Long Chen didn’t go, then perhaps Mo Nian would get into trouble in the Heavenly Flame Devil Domain. Long Chen couldn’t let him go alone.

Suddenly, the Earth Cauldron’s voice rang out in Long Chen’s mind. “Don’t go to the High Firmament World. You have to go to the Heavenly Flame Devil Domain.”

“Senior!”

Long Chen was startled to hear its voice. It seemed that even though it wasn’t in his spiritual space, it could still see him.

“The High Firmament World might have accumulated a huge amount of energy, but it’s meaningless for you. It’s a far cry from the Heavenly Flame Devil Domain. As for your Dragonblood Legion, there’s no need for you to look after them so much. During a heavenly tribulation, your presence might ensure they absorb more energy, but it also makes them dependent on you. The tribulation is meant to temper both body and will. Even if you hadn’t made arrangements with Mo Nian, I would have proposed not being there for their tribulation. It’s meaningless and might even affect the quality of your tribulation,” said the Earth Cauldron.

Long Chen understood the principle that it spoke of. After all, to gain something was to lose something else. The High Firmament World was no longer so enticing to him.

Moreover, Long Chen couldn’t gather Doyen power, so he could never become a Heavenly Chosen. This kind of opportunity was meaningless to him.

“Senior, are you doing well?” asked Long Chen.

“I’m doing well. They’re doing their utmost to help me. I almost feel bad pretending to be asleep,” replied the Earth Cauldron.

Long Chen chuckled. Before he could respond, the Earth Cauldron added, “However, I feel like we can move on to the next step…”

“What next step? You couldn’t be thinking…”

“That’s right. Just that!”

Long Chen was speechless. It had said that it felt a bit embarrassed, but now its appetite had increased shamelessly. Was this the style of a legendary primal chaos divine item?

Clearly, the Earth Cauldron had set its sights on the new group of experts. With so many of them possessing heaven vein dragon qi, it wanted their help as well. Their heaven vein dragon qi could help its recovery.

The Earth Cauldron said, “I’ve been following your example. I keep giving them the feeling that I’m about to awaken at any moment, so they feel like success is within reach.”

It imitated how Long Chen had conned countless medicinal ingredients from one of Lord Brahma’s disciples. Ultimately, learning good habits was hard, but learning bad habits was too easy.

“That’s a bit difficult. After all, the Long clan treats this matter as top secret. They even erased the memories of their main pillars,” said Long Chen.

“Even if it’s difficult, it must be done. Their power is extremely important to me. If they do not activate the Earth Setting Rune in me, I won’t be able to help you refine the Nirvanic Charge Pill,” replied the Earth Cauldron solemnly.

“What? Why is that?” asked Long Chen in shock.

“The Earth Setting Rune is my most foundational rune. If it cannot recover, the other runes will remain in a state of slumber. I can refine ordinary pills without it, but the Nirvanic Charge Pill requires gathering the astral laws from above the nine heavens. With my condition, I am not sure if I can do it. Even if I can, there will be issues. One is that the power of the laws will be impure, affecting the quality of the pill. The other is that it will be impossible to maintain such a refinement for long. I would need to rest a few days after each refinement, which would affect our efficiency,” answered the Earth Cauldron.

Long Chen’s heart shook. During this time, the Long clan had strictly ordered the disciples not to provoke the mercenaries. In order to thank Long Chen, the mercenaries were going all-out to gather the remaining medicinal ingredients he had requested.

He was only missing around ten of the medicinal ingredients for the Nirvanic Charge Pill, so he was filled with anticipation for it. If the Earth Cauldron couldn’t refine it, that really would be a disappointment.

If even the Earth Cauldron couldn’t do it, then there was nothing more to be said about other cauldrons. They had to do this.

“Senior, how much longer will it take to activate the Earth Setting Rune?” asked Long Chen.

“Just a bit. Unfortunately, the Long clan… Well, you understand,” replied the Earth Cauldron, embarrassed.

Clearly, the Long clan had exhausted all their resources. They were close to reaching the necessary level, but the four heaven vein experts from the Long clan couldn’t quite cross that threshold.

Long Chen nodded understandingly. He assured the Earth Cauldron not to worry; he would find a solution. This matter was crucial for both of their futures, and he needed to figure something out.

“Qin Feng, I’m not participating in the High Firmament World this time. I have something more important to do,” said Long Chen.

Qin Feng was disappointed to hear that. Seeing his expression, Long Chen instantly thought of the Earth Cauldron’s words.

As expected, he had been there during their tribulations too many times, causing them to feel a bit dependent on him. There really was a trace of unease and fear when it came to facing the tribulation on their own. It seemed that it would be best if he refrained from accompanying them in their future tribulations.

“When you return to the academy, bring the mercenaries with you. I don’t feel comfortable leaving them here,” remarked Long Chen.

Qin Feng nodded. Since Long Chen wasn’t planning on returning, Qin Feng intended to leave immediately to pass the message to the academy.

However, just then, a loud knocking came from the door, accompanied by an icy and arrogant voice.

“Long Chen, come out. There are people who want to see you."
