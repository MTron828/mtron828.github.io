Chapter 3738 Terrifying Yin Changsheng

These flame stones were embedded into the formation and could not be broken. But the white-robed woman’s attack had shaken them loose, so Long Chen easily sucked them all into the primal chaos space.

Long Chen had just taken the flame foundation stone when he immediately took out the Minghong Saber and slashed the space behind him.

BOOM!

With a heaven-shaking explosion, Long Chen’s saber struck a flame spear. Long Chen then cast his net, took the stones, and attacked all in one go.

The result of this exchange was Long Chen being forced back several steps, his Blood Qi flipping within him. He was shocked inside. This fire-haired man’s power was actually so immense.

When Long Chen saw the runes on the spear in the fire-haired man’s hand, Long Chen’s pupils shrank.

“Faith energy?”

This spear was actually a World Domain divine item nourished by faith energy. Faith symbols covered it.

“You are the successor of the Sacred Pill Hall’s master?” Long Chen swung out his hand, looking at him coldly.Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

“I am hall master Yin Tiande’s final disciple, Yin Changsheng. I am also the heir of the Yin clan’s bloodline. Now you can die in peace!” The fire-haired man pointed his spear at Long Chen.

“No wonder you can control faith energy. But your name isn’t very good. Based on my many years of killing, all those called Changsheng[1] end up having bad deaths,” said Long Chen.

Cultivators, especially powerful ones, liked to call themselves rather domineering names. Many people would have names with characters like Heaven, Earth, Sun, Moon, Star, etc.

In truth, even just a name had a connection to the Heavenly Daos. It involved karma, and if someone’s life was not tough enough, it would come to a premature end.

Some people who had such names chosen for them before being born would die in the womb. Without a tough enough life, they couldn’t endure such a domineering name.

For the likes of those with incredibly arrogant names like Long Aotian, Zhao Ritian, Ye Liangchen, or those like Batian or Tianba, if their lives weren’t tough enough, they would definitely die before adulthood.

Even if they did reach adulthood, this name alone would cause fate to twist and turn for them. Such a name was not something that just anyone could endure.

For example, Long Chen’s father, Long Tianxiao, had the Heaven character in his name. But it had no meaning of disrespect toward the heavens. Despite this, he still spent a lifetime fighting. He brushed up against death countless times and was forced into desperate straits. Furthermore, he was nothing more than a secular cultivator. Perhaps the Heaven character in his name couldn’t be blamed for all of it, but such names always brought karma with them.

As for Long Chen’s biological father, Long Zhantian, he had been incredibly glorious back in the day in the Long family. He was claimed to be the number one genius of the world and had created his own cultivation technique. As an unprecedented genius on the Martial Heaven Continent, he was praised by the Long family as an existence that could stand shoulder to shoulder with the Sovereigns.

However, what happened afterward? As soon as his child was born, he faced calamity. He was separated from his wife and child. Now, no one knew where he was. Zhantian was an arrogant name, meaning to fight the heavens. It was clearly a name that defied the heavens. Such a provocation toward the Heavenly Daos made it fated that he would have a tougher life than others.

Perhaps if it wasn’t for Long Chen’s mother giving Long Chen a more ordinary name, then with Long Zhantian’s character, he would have definitely given Long Chen an even more domineering name. If that really happened, Long Chen would truly be defying the heavens just to exist.

However, his mother did not wish for her child to be some peerless genius. She didn’t need him to have incredible accomplishments. If he could live an ordinary, peaceful life, she would already be happy.

Thus, a name truly couldn’t be randomly made. Some people’s names had taboo characters, and in order to survive, they either had to live peaceful lives, have exceptionally tough lives, be blessed with fortune, or accumulate good karma to gain the favor of the Heavenly Daos. Only then would they not be beset by calamity and disaster.

However, of all the people that Long Chen had encountered, all those given the name Changsheng had bad ends. In fact, Long Chen remembered that at least eighty heavenly geniuses that he had slain were named Changsheng.

As for those people who died at his hands without ever getting a chance to say their names, it was unknown how many of them were called Changsheng. In the end, they never lived up to their name. Today, he encountered another one.

“You’re the one who won’t have a good death. Hand over the Ice Soul, and I’ll leave you with an intact corpse. If not, I’ll make you suffer a life worse than death, and the Ice Soul will still be mine!” said Yin Changsheng coldly.

His flame qilin roared beside him, its pair of ominous eyes glaring at Long Chen. It was like it was echoing Yin Changsheng’s words.

“Hand over the Ice Soul? Let’s see if you have the ability to make me,” sneered Long Chen. His Blood Qi quivered and the Minghong Saber rumbled. His aura crazily rose like a dragon awakening.

Long Chen had only been at a disadvantage in the previous fight due to rapidly taking the foundation stones. This time, Long Chen would be facing him at full power.

“Since you wish to die so badly, I’ll fulfill your wish.”

As soon as Long Chen entered a fighting state, killing intent exploded out of Yin Changsheng. He found that the other Supreme geniuses were also rushing over.

Although he was the disciple of the master of the Sacred Pill Hall, as well as his descendant, the competition for the Ice Soul would be a competition of power and luck. Once hundreds of Supreme heavenly geniuses came over, if someone else landed the killing blow on Long Chen, the Ice Soul would change masters. He wouldn’t be able to force others to hand it over or have a right to attack them for it.

“My great god, hear your devout follower’s call. Bestow me your divine power. Assist me in vanquishing my enemies!”

White light appeared on top of Yin Changsheng’s spear. Following his chant, powerful faith energy enveloped him and the runes on his spear quickly lit up. It was like an ancient divine beast awakening.

BOOM!

The moment Yin Changsheng moved, his faith energy ignited his Blood Qi. It was like he was possessed by a god, and his spear’s power suppressed the very heavens. Long Chen was shocked to find that Yin Changsheng’s faith energy was not at all weaker than Liao Bencang’s from back then.

“How can his faith energy be so terrifying?!”

Long Chen’s heart thudded. With a roar, his astral energy erupted. His divine ring and astral sea appeared, and he swung the Minghong Saber with all his power.

BOOM!

Long Chen’s arms jolted. Facing this attack, he coughed up blood and was blown back nine steps. With every step, the earth beneath his feet collapsed.

This land was originally covered by a grand formation. With the foundation stones taken, that formation’s power plummeted and the immense power was shaking this underground world.

On Long Chen’s final step, a figure silently appeared. It was Yin Changsheng’s flame qilin. It was unknown what divine ability it used, but it simply appeared. Its gaping maw closed around Long Chen.

“Scram!”

Long Chen’s saber was outside its mouth and unable to block it, so lightning flew out of his left hand.

BOOM!

The flame qilin roared in pain. Its head split open, its blood spraying. It was almost blasted apart by Long Chen’s attack.

Long Chen was shocked and enraged by Yin Changsheng’s power. How did he possess this much faith energy? But his competitive spirit was ignited. Within the same realm, he had never suffered such a loss in this lifetime.

“Split the Heavens…”

Long Chen raised his saber toward Yin Changsheng. Just as he was about to decide which one of them was stronger, the white-robed woman’s voice rang out in his head.

“Not even a Divine Venerate is necessarily a match for him in his current state. Leave!”

[1] Changsheng=long life.
