Chapter 4658 Fallen Daynight’s Disciple

Just as Long Chen shattered the lightning sword, the world shuddered, and a sphere of light appeared around Long Chen.

“You despicable bastard, you’ve been locked down by the tribulation! Now let’s see where you run!” Yu Zihao laughed viciously, a cruel light in his eyes. He was already imagining how he would torture Long Chen later.

“Lord Brahma’s disciple, how are you so petty? You can’t even take a joke. Didn’t I just take a bit of your things? You’re acting like I murdered your father and slept with your woman afterward,” scoffed Long Chen.

“You...!” Yu Zihao was incensed. Long Chen had conned him so badly and now called him petty? He felt like he would explode, and for a moment, he was too enraged to even think of how to respond.

That was because he didn’t dare to actually say what had happened to him, as it was too embarrassing to admit that he had fallen for a scam. Even if he did tell everyone, no one would sympathize with him.

“Zihao, why are you getting so angry toward a dead man? When we get back, I’ll refine him into a human pill for you.” Another voice rang out at this time.

Long Chen looked toward the source—another sphere of light with an indistinct figure. As if sensing Long Chen staring at him, this person intentionally cleared his sphere of light to let Long Chen see him.

It was an icy-faced, red-haired man. He gazed at Long Chen loftily, as if he was a god looking at an ant.

“Where did this one come from? Red hair won’t turn you into the legendary red torto—eh? Oh, I see... This one is Lord Brahma’s disciple, and if you’re helping him eat shit, you must be Fallen Daynight’s disciple,” guessed Long Chen. He was going to insult this red-haired man a bit, but he suddenly realized the latter’s identity midway.

“Shut your filthy mouth. Blasphemer, I’m going to refine you into a human pill right now!” the red-haired man roared furiously.

Long Chen’s guess was right on the mark. This person was Fallen Daynight’s disciple, which was why he was so angry.

“Brother Gengjian, calm down. He’s been locked onto by the heavenly tribulation. Killing him now is letting him off too easily. I want to see him suffer first.” This time, it was Yu Zihao’s turn to comfort him.

“Two dogs eating shit together, how brotherly.” Long Chen clapped his hands in admiration.

Fallen Daynight’s disciple shook with rage, but he still endured. He swiftly formed hand seals, and thunderforce boomed around him, enveloping him and blocking him from sight.

Yu Zihao was the same. With a sneer, he directly blocked off his senses. He knew that he couldn’t match the sharpness of Long Chen’s tongue, so he just waited for the heavenly tribulation to descend.

The sphere of light around Long Chen grew denser, a sign that Yu Zihao had successfully managed to pull him into the tribulation.

Long Chen simply smiled. Trying to use heavenly tribulation to harm him? Who would have thought that someone in this world would come up with such a funny idea? That was fine... he would wait to see if they could keep laughing in a bit.

“Long Chen, we’ll see how you flee this time.” Once Yu Zihao and Fallen Daynight’s disciple fell silent, another voice rang out.

Long Chen didn’t even look back and lazily said, “It seems that the one to run last time was you, right? If you didn’t have the protection of the ancestral scale last time, there would no longer be a Netherdragon Tianzhao in this world.”

Netherdragon Tianzhao hadn’t interrupted Yu Zihao but waited for his chance to speak.

After this round of greeting, the guards on the outer edge were scared shitless. They didn’t know who Long Chen was, but they knew that anyone who dared to undergo tribulation in this place had to be an absolutely terrifying monster.

The ones on the outer edge were just spectators and guards. Their races’ strongest monsters had gathered here for their tribulations, and the guards had set up formations to protect their leaders.

After all, even these monsters might still fall in front of the strongest heavenly tribulation. Moreover, even if they did survive, they would still be severely wounded and at their weakest state. That was why these people were here to protect them.

For a single person, many experts from their respective races had come to offer protection, with groups ranging from millions to tens of millions of people.

Furthermore, even the guards present were elites amongst elites, so it was obvious how important this upcoming tribulation was to these people.

These guards had followed their leaders here, and they had not said much. Only a few factions with hostile relationships had their guards exchange mocking remarks before falling silent. None of them showed any intention of fighting yet.

However, as soon as Long Chen arrived, people repeatedly targeted him. They could tell that Yu Zihao had previously suffered at his hands, and Netherdragon Tianzhao had been beaten by Long Chen before. These two formidable figures had both crossed paths with Long Chen before, indicating that Long Chen was no ordinary individual.

The human expert who had tried to con Long Chen grew antsy. Although he knew Long Chen’s name and had seen his picture, he didn’t have a true understanding of him.

He suddenly felt a bit afraid and was worried about Long Chen’s retribution. Would his family be destroyed because of this?

“A minor victory or defeat doesn’t mean anything. To know how to retreat is the mark of a real warrior. In a bit, I will show you what true power is,” declared Netherdragon Tianzhao coldly.

“If one minor victory doesn’t mean anything, what about two victories?” asked Long Chen.

“You...!” Netherdragon Tianzhao’s rage immediately erupted. Having suffered two humiliating defeats at the hands of Long Chen, Netherdragon Tianzhao couldn’t act indifferent when Long Chen mentioned this.

“Don’t worry, once you lose more, you’ll get used to it. Although, I must say, based on my calculations, a person can be lucky once, or even twice, but not thrice. It seems you’re due for some calamity today,” Long Chen remarked, counting on his fingers as if calculating something.

“That’s right, there won’t be a third time! I’ll show you who won’t be escaping a calamity today!” sneered Netherdragon Tianzhao. He seemed confident in himself.

“Hmph, I won't give you a second chance. You schemed against me once, but now that we’ve crossed paths again, your death is inevitable!” A sinister voice echoed, akin to the hiss of a harbinger of doom, sending shivers down the spine of everyone. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

That voice came from a large sphere of light within which resided a person, a carriage, and a horse. This sight shocked the guards witnessing it.

“He’s even met this person?!”
