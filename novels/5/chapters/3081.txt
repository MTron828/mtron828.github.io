Chapter 3070 Instructor Convention

At some unknown point, Bai Shishi had appeared behind Long Chen, her gaze so ominous it appeared as if she wished to kill and eat people.

“Cough, fairy Shishi, I was wrong,” said Long Chen extremely awkwardly. With the sword on his neck, he had no choice but to lower his head.

“Where were you wrong?” demanded Bai Shishi.

Her tone and words were exactly the same as how Long Chen had questioned young master Changchuan. It almost made Luo Bing and the others laugh.

Long Chen began to sweat. It seemed that this girl had heard everything before entering. He had actually been speaking with such frank assurance before. Just thinking about it made a chill run up his back.

“I was wrong in that…”

Long Chen suddenly looked at young master Changchuan. “I was wrong in that I took a stand of principle, trying to help others onto the right path. If you have to blame someone, blame him. He’s the one who wants to pursue you.”

Bai Shishi’s gaze then turned to young master Changchuan. He instantly felt a chill and shook his head. “I didn’t ask anything just now! I didn’t slander fairy Shishi at all. Every single person here can testify to that.”

“You don’t even have the guts to admit it, but you want to pick up girls?! The face of the life forbidden zone has been completely lost by you!” Long Chen hadn’t expected young master Changchuan to be such a coward.

Young master Changchuan fled far into the distance, lowering his head and not saying a word. It was as if he didn’t even see or hear Long Chen.

Bai Shishi’s frosty face once more turned to Long Chen. Her sword continued to rest on his neck.

Hmph, do you dare to kill me? You want to just stare? Let’s see who’s afraid of who!

Long Chen looked back at Bai Shishi. Just like that, many minutes passed…

Everyone else was silent, and the atmosphere was very tense. Bai Shishi was quite patient. Just like that, she glared at Long Chen without the slightest intention of retreating. In the end, it was Long Chen whose eyes started hurting. Tears almost came out.

That was due to researching the Three Flower Pupils lately, so he had been overusing his eyes. He was unable to out-stare her. Feeling he was about to cry and that this would be too embarrassing, he conceded.

“Your skin is very good.”

Luo Ning hadn’t expected Long Chen to suddenly spit out such a random thing, and a chuckle escaped her lips before she covered it up.

Luo Bing and the others bitterly endured. They looked at Bai Shishi. While the others wanted to laugh, her expression didn’t even twitch in the slightest. She wasn’t moved at all.

“Why don’t you sit for a bit? I’m sure standing all this time is tiring…” probed Long Chen.

Once more, Bai Shishi just stared at him silently. Finally, Long Chen couldn’t endure any longer. He suddenly covered his face and wiped away tears from his eyes.

“I really am moved. It’s my first time being stared at by a beautiful woman for so long. You actually didn’t vomit? I must be more attractive than I thought.”

Long Chen finally couldn’t help the tears from coming, but he immediately acted as if it was from being moved by Bai Shishi. He even sobbed a few times.

Mu Qingyun and the others didn’t know what was happening with his eyes. Seeing him actually manage to squeeze out tears, they almost laughed.

“Next time you use me to make a joke, don’t blame me for turning hostile.” Bai Shishi snorted and walked away.

Once she was gone, Long Chen sighed with relief. He was very sullen inside. If he wasn’t in the wrong, why would he have to act so servile?

“Brother Long, my sincere apologies.” Young master Changchuan came back.

“My brother San helped you out of the kindness of his heart, and you tossed him into a hole just to run off yourself,” said Mu Qingyun frostily.

“I wasn’t just running away. I simply felt that brother Long’s words were correct. Perhaps I should consider finding someone with a better temper. Actually, during the registration, I saw quite a few decent women,” said young master Changchuan.

Luo Bing and the others were speechless. It seemed that this young master Changchuan changed ideas far too quickly, no? He was giving up just like this.

“Tch, I can’t be bothered with you. All you can do is trick some ignorant young women with your face. If you encounter women with any real ability, with your character, you’ll be beaten to death sooner or later,” said Long Chen, rubbing his throat that was still a bit sore.

“That’s why I ask brother Long for your teachings,” said young master Changchuan.

“You want to be taught? I only have one life, and I want to live a bit longer, so give it up. But you are correct. The Nine Prefecture Convention has millions of outstanding women attending. Perhaps you will encounter someone that suits you. However, if you want to have the highest odds of encountering a woman like that, you must grasp this opportunity,” said Long Chen solemnly.

“What opportunity?” asked young master Changchuan hastily.

“You must show off your talent at the convention. Let more people recognize you. Eliminate some people targeting us. Do you know what you are lacking most right now?” Long Chen patted young master Changchuan’s shoulder.

“What am I lacking?”

“You lack the domineeringness a man should have. You give off the feeling of a boy, not a man. A man must have responsibility, daring, and domineeringness. This time, why don’t we directly take first place in the competition? What do you think?” A glint flickered in Long Chen’s eyes.

On the way here, Bai Shishi’s mother had told Long Chen that he should think of a way to make young master Changchuan go all-out without holding back.

“But… my people told me to just play around and leave it, not to compete for the rewards,” said young master Changchuan.

Long Chen instantly understood where the problem lay. Young master Changchuan came from that mysterious life forbidden area, and his background was shocking, so he was only here to attend for the experience, not to make a name for himself. Perhaps he also didn’t wish to be used by the academy. That was why Bai Shishi’s mother would ask Long Chen to do such a thing.

“Well, it’s up to you. I said that you’re like a child. You’re just going to listen to others and not use your own brain? You can’t even handle your own affairs? Then what can you do? Can you become a bit more manly?” said Long Chen scornfully.

Young master Changchuan clenched his teeth. “Fine, I’ll listen to you. I’ll go all-out this time.”

“Right, that’s what a man should do. This is such a good opportunity, wouldn’t it be a waste to just let it slip away? Wouldn’t you have regrets? Such a grand stage has been set up for you. You can use it to unleash your light. What else is cultivation for?” encouraged Long Chen.

“Brother Long is right. I’ll go activate my final bloodline rune right now.”

Just like that, young master Changchuan returned to his room.

Just like Bai Shishi, young master Changchuan had an extremely large room for improvement. He still had trump cards. Long Chen suddenly wanted to know just how terrifying this fellow that came from the life forbidden area was.

Three days passed. Today was the day of the Dao discussion, and everyone from the High Firmament Academy was brought to a plaza on the western side of Silver Moon City.

This plaza was filled with people. It was a sea of people that stretched further than his sight.

“Long Chen, the instructors are counting on you.” Bai Shishi’s mother looked at Long Chen. This Dao discussion was only for Long Chen. No one else from the academy could help him, not even her. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Don’t worry. I won’t lose the academy’s face.” Long Chen gave her a thumbs-up and patted his chest. Just like that, he swaggered up the Dao discussion stage. When he did, a hissing sound rang out.

“Why would this fellow appear here? Isn’t he… heavens!”
