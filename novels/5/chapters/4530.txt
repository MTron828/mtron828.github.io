Chapter 4519 Heavenly Corrupt Medicinal Field

“Asura race? Hmm, why does it sound a bit familiar?”

A formation disc illuminated another mountain, revealing Long Chen’s figure. He rubbed his chin, deep in contemplation.

“That’s right, the Nine Underworld Luocha mentioned having a trace of the Asura race’s bloodline. Tch, who cares? No one can stop Boss Long San from getting rich! Whatever falls into my hands is rightfully mine!”

Long Chen shook his head and took out that saber again. As he gripped it, his hand sank, and the mountain beneath his feet trembled as if struggling under the weight it bore.

“Hehe, only something as heavy as this is interesting enough. Haha, what if I returned this saber to them in exchange for them creating a Dragonbone Evilmoon for me? Would they agree?”

Long Chen laughed, knowing that the idea wasn’t very practical. Ignoring whether or not they would agree, just how many years would it take them to create such a divine weapon? He couldn’t wait that long.

“Well, I’ll just use this saber. It should be able to endure my astral energy. Hehe, Ying Tian, just you wait. I’ll cut you down this time.”

Long Chen swung the saber a few times. It really was too heavy for him, so he wasn’t able to wield it perfectly.

But then, he hadn’t used a heavy weapon in a long time, so perhaps his wrist control had weakened slightly.

A spider-like entity suddenly appeared behind Long Chen, and its legs wrapped around him. At the center of its eight legs was a rectangular form.

Long Chen then directed the saber behind him, and it seamlessly slid into that rectangular form. It fit perfectly, creating a perfect sheath.

Seeing this discovery, Long Chen was extremely satisfied. The only regretful thing was that despite being a domineering weapon, it was different from Dragonbone Evilmoon’s innate ruler qi.

Long Chen had been in the immortal world for quite some time now, having fought countless battles and seen countless divine weapons. However, he had never seen another weapon like Dragonbone Evilmoon. This was why after the Minghong Saber was destroyed, he never felt like getting another saber.

Those sabers were just far too weak compared to Dragonbone Evilmoon, and Long Chen was extremely picky. Up to now, aside from the Minghong Saber, this blood-colored saber was the only one he deemed worthy.

After placing this blood-colored saber on his back, Long Chen adjusted the formation disc beneath his feet. It lit up, and once again, he disappeared.

When he reappeared, he found himself enveloped in a mist saturated with immortal spiritual qi. Mountains lay hidden within the mist, barely visible and resembling a mirage.

This was the medicinal field of the Heavenly Corrupt Sect. Over tens of millions of years, they had invested significant time and resources to transform this treasured land into a holy land.

Through the last soulsearch, Long Chen had obtained quite a bit of information about the Heavenly Corrupt Sect. Although he didn’t know the sect’s innermost secrets, he possessed a comprehensive understanding of its general structure.

As a result, Long Chen had strategically placed backup plans throughout the sect’s territory. Regardless of his entry point, he could always escape, and even if he failed, he also had other plans.

Long Chen knew he couldn’t rely on his luck, so he depended on his power. Having obtained some of their divine materials, Long Chen now came for their medicinal field. He estimated that news of his previous sneak attack would be swiftly relayed to their headquarters.

Their elders would very likely decide to send pursuers in the direction he supposedly fled. The notion that he hadn’t fled but returned for more would probably not cross their old minds.

Even if they did consider this possibility, it would take some time for them to arrange their defenses. Long Chen had more than enough time to make his move.

While this medicinal field was just one among the hundreds owned by the Heavenly Corrupt Sect, it was the finest. Naturally, Long Chen would pick the best for himself.

Although the Heavenly Corrupt Sect was part of the Corrupt path, it didn’t imply that all their treasures possessed an evil attribute. Both the divine materials and precious medicinal ingredients they owned could be utilized by both the Righteous and Corrupt paths.

Only once their weapons were injected with resentful spirits did they truly become evil. Similarly, only when these ingredients were refined into evil pills would they possess evil nature. Before undergoing these processes, they were all normal.

Long Chen saw that there were more guards here than in the previous location. However, their role wasn’t to thwart potential attacks but rather to prevent accidental harm to the medicinal ingredients caused by some ignorant workers.

After all, the rarer the medicinal ingredient, the pickier it was. Some were so sensitive that even the slightest touch could lead to their demise.

These medicinal ingredients were incomparably precious, and many of them had signs beside them with the names of their caretakers. If any harm befell the medicinal ingredients, the caretakers would be held responsible. So, if a precious medicinal ingredient died, that person would probably accompany it. Thus, all of these people were vigilant in their duties.

“Stop, you-!”

Pfft!

With a single finger, Long Chen killed a guard but didn’t do a soulsearch for fear that he would trigger another seal. He could only check some of their spiritual fragments. Fortunately, the fragments did contain what he wanted.

Very quickly, Long Chen found the diagram of the medicinal field’s tiers and stealthily went around to the highest tier. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

“Damn, there are Saints personally standing guard here?”

When he reached the place with the highest-tier medicinal ingredients, he saw a Saint conducting an inspection there.

Long Chen instantly went still. While he wasn’t afraid of a single Saint, fighting here could ruin all these precious medicinal ingredients, which would hurt him instead. In his view, these ingredients were already his, so he wouldn’t let anyone ruin them.

After going through this field, the Saint summoned a dozen Eternal experts working in the area and scolded them.

He basically rebuked them for not paying enough attention to the finer details, stating things like “people who neglect their work will be punished.”

Those Eternal experts repeatedly shook their heads like chickens bobbing for rice, not daring to argue. They were already used to this. Whether or not there was a problem, this Saint would always scold them.

Actually, this was a good thing; it suggested that there were no real problems. The real concern would be if he didn't scold them.

The Saint sent spittle flying for two hours, during which Long Chen felt the increasing urge to silence him forever. Long Chen didn’t even know what this Saint was trying to express with his rant.

Eventually, whether out of fatigue or running out of curses, he swung his sleeve and walked away.

Once he left, those Eternal experts relaxed but continued to stand there for a while, only fully relaxing and laughing once they were certain the Saint was gone.

However, halfway through their laughter, they froze as that Saint actually returned.
