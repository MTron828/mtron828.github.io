Chapter 2082 Confrontation

Silence rang out after Shi Lingfeng’s words. Everyone looked at Nangong Zuiyue.

This Shi Lingfeng was just like the legends said. He was vicious and domineering, not giving face to anyone. He was actually directly provoking Nangong Zuiyue. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

The formation around Long Chen’s group was a simple one that prevented outsiders from hearing them. But they could hear what was said outside.

“This Shi Lingfeng is courting death.” Beitang Rushuang’s expression was chilly.

Although she and Nangong Zuiyue were enemies, Shi Lingfeng was provoking not just Nangong Zuiyue, but also the everlasting families.

On the other hand, Nangong Zuiyue merely smiled lightly, tasting her tea as if she hadn’t heard his provocation.

Seeing no reaction from Nangong Zuiyue, Shi Lingfeng smiled mockingly. He then turned to Long Chen.

“Little fellow, you’re Long Chen?” demanded Shi Lingfeng.

Long Chen frowned and asked Beitang Rushuang, “What is wrong with this fellow? Is he an idiot? I didn’t even do anything, but it seems he wants to find trouble for me.”

“Perhaps it’s because your face is blacker than his. Maybe evil people are drawn together by fate?” Beitang Rushuang couldn’t help finding it funny.

“Brat, I’m talking to you. Are you deaf?” demanded Shi Lingfeng.

“Are you an idiot? Who said I had to answer you? Are you my son?” sneered Long Chen. However, as soon as he said this, he regretted it. Shi Lingfeng’s face was so ugly, wasn’t he cursing himself like this? “Ah, I misspoke just now. What I meant is, are you an idiot? Fairy Zuiyue can’t even be bothered to look at you. Are you taking that disdain for fear?”

Nangong Zuiyue couldn’t help shaking her head. Long Chen really had no patience. Beitang Rushuang smiled though.

“You’re courting death!” Shi Lingfeng suddenly roared, and killing intent enveloped Long Chen.

“Brother Shi, please stop!” Dongfang Yuyang appeared in the room like a spring breeze, a displeased expression on his face. “Brother Shi, why bother?”

This place was the Dongfang family. Shi Lingfeng was too big for his britches.

“Long Chen insulted me, so I want to kill him.” Even with Dongfang Yuyang present, Shi Lingfeng’s killing intent didn’t dissipate.

“Brother Shi, this place is the Dongfang family, not your Stone race. I hope you can be clear on that. This gathering is being hosted by my Dongfang family, and it’s for everyone to help each other and develop. The Dongfang family is doing this for the Martial Heaven Continent, but we are not pushovers. If someone takes advantage of our kindness, then don’t blame us for kicking you out.” Although Dongfang Yuyang was rather tactful, there was anger in his eyes.

The way Shi Lingfeng had treated one of their attendants was already pushing things. They had made a concession by not punishing him for it. However, Shi Lingfeng continued pushing things, and there was no way they could accept it.

Dongfang Yuyang’s tone was firm and embodied the resolve of his everlasting family. If Shi Lingfeng continued acting like this, he would have to scram.

Shi Lingfeng nodded. “Then I’ll give you face and not quibble with him here.” Pointing at Long Chen, he said, “Brat, just wait. Once we’re out of the Dongfang family, I’ll smash you to bits.”

Long Chen didn’t reply to Shi Lingfeng’s provocation directly. He looked Shi Lingfeng up and down and then whispered into Beitang Rushuang’s ear, “Are those crystal things on his scabs worth some money?”

Having Long Chen in such close contact made Beitang Rushuang turn red, but then she jumped at his words. He was actually placing his sights on Shi Lingfeng? “You idiot, with the formation back up, why are you getting so close?!”

“Oh, sorry, it was a habit. Can you answer my question?” Long Chen hadn’t realized that. But after doing bad things, he didn’t like to discuss them.

“This fellow belongs to the Stone race, a strange lifeform. Their origins are unclear, but they were born by the earth. What can be said for sure though is that every part of their bodies is an absolute treasure. Their flesh is tough like stone. Blade and saber cannot pierce it, water and fire cannot damage it. They essentially have no weaknesses. On the ground, they can absorb the earth’s energy. In the sky, they can absorb the energy of the stars. As for those so-called scabs of his, they are natural crystals, with each one being its own world. It is said that each crystal contains the Dao, and through them, it is possible to see the mysteries of the world,” said Beitang Rushuang.

“In other words, he’s worth a lot of money? Good, good, I’ll be doing some big business soon then.” Long Chen’s eyes lit up like a hungry wolf that had seen meat.

“You can’t be serious!” Beitang Rushuang felt a chill from that look.

“I’m always serious when it comes to making money. I’m so poor right now. If I don’t make some money, I’ll starve. But don’t worry, I’ll make sure to pay your portion, and of course fairy Zuiyue’s portion too. I won’t pocket all the profit myself,” promised Long Chen.

“No, I don’t need a portion.” Beitang Rushuang shook her hand. What kind of joke was that? If it was known that a genius of her grand everlasting family was conducting such business with Long Chen, the Beitang family would become the laughingstocks of the continent.

Furthermore, the closer she got to Long Chen, the more she felt that he wouldn’t lie about something like that. He really would do it. She definitely didn’t want to be implicated.

However, Nangong Zuiyue merely smiled without saying anything, not expressing any of her thoughts toward his plan.

Long Chen couldn’t help finding it funny. Beitang Rushuang definitely wasn’t a match for Nangong Zuiyue intellectually. She couldn’t even tell when he was joking. Would he really drag others down with him?

After the waves caused by Shi Lingfeng, things returned to calm. Experts walked in one by one. When they looked around, they nodded to the people they knew before quietly finding their own seats.

With Long Chen sitting in the back, he saw everyone as they walked in. Beitang Rushuang and Nangong Zuiyue introduced them to him. These people were all heroes of their generation. In fact, even Long Chen had heard some legends about them.

The majority of them were very cold, merely looking around indifferently before sitting down.

“Do all experts have to act like they’re supreme and indifferent to everyone else?” asked Long Chen.

Nangong Zuiyue said, “Actually, that’s not the case. It’s just that being unrivaled is very lonely. After reaching the peak, you can’t find another target. That loneliness shaped their characters. No one else was able to stand alongside them, and no one was capable of even following them. They didn’t have a single qualified opponent. That is its own kind of pain.”

“But you’re not like that, right? You don’t have that narcissistic loner feeling,” said Long Chen.

“Me? What I pursue is different from them. I’ve always been looking, but I’ve never found what I’m searching for. I’m still working hard at it, but they have already reached the peak. And what about yourself? Your character isn’t like theirs either,” said Nangong Zuiyue, laughing when she mentioned Long Chen’s character. She had never imagined that such an expert existed in this world.

“Me? You all dominated your era, and no one was able to fight back in the end. But I’m not able to dominate any era. At any time, I might be surrounded and beaten like a wild dog. Just look at me now. It’s only been a few days, but all kinds of trouble are plaguing me,” sighed Long Chen.

On his way, he had run into those idiots of the Mechanism Sect. He had been schemed against, almost losing his life.

He had already made himself a powerful enemy even before arriving at the Dongfang family. His fortune took a rare turn for the better, allowing him to obtain the Moon and Star Refining Furnace along with the Nine Lotus Soul Condensing Pill. But then, that good fortune resulted in another powerful enemy wanting to buy it from him.

Huang Feiyan had used the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow race to threaten him. Did she think he would submit? So a second enemy had been made.

Then this stone idiot had come out of nowhere as well, directly targeting him. Long Chen asked himself just what he had done to get surrounded by enemies. Even before he killed the last batch, new ones already came.

“Everyone, the time has arrived. The second day’s auction is about to start!” At this moment, a white-robed, middle-aged man walked in.
