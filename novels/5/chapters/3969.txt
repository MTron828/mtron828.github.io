Chapter 3958 Long Chen’s Betrothal Gift

Within the cases were two mesmerizing reddish-brown jugs, each about the size of a fist. Adorning the surface of these jugs was an intricately carved Vermilion Bird with seven ethereal clouds around it. Also, the image of the Vermilion Bird was so vivid, as though it would fly off of the jug and into the clouds.

Upon closer examination, millions of tiny runes actually formed a complete formation in each cloud, emanating different colors. To their surprise, the seven clouds were seven formations with energy flowing within them.

Actually, even an amateur could see that the jugs were amazing treasures just from the fact that such complicated formations were carved into them.

Moreover, the auspicious clouds covering the Vermilion Bird possessed immense power. It was like they were their own world.

“Could this be… the legendary Vermilion Bird Pear Flower Wine?” Jiang Huixin was filled with shock as she looked at the jug in her hand.

“Seven auspicious clouds, with the Vermilion Bird’s eyes being dark purple. The Purple Eye Vermilion Bird loves the Divine Flame Pear Flower, and it will only make its nest on top of it! It probably is real!” Xu Lanxin looked closely at the carvings, also feeling shocked.

“If it is real, then this gift is too precious. Look at the seal. This wine is at least a million years old, and it might be one-of-a-kind. Furthermore, the jug has a formation that will absorb the essence of heaven and earth to nourish the wine. Who knows what purity this wine has reached after a million years?” Jiang Huixin rubbed the jug lightly. Long Chen had style when it came to spending money.

It was because the Divine Flame Pear Flower was essentially extinct. Even if it did exist, every petal would be a priceless treasure, costing an astronomical amount of money. What kind of person would gather millions of such flower petals to make wine?

“Open it and look! There’s no way I can calm myself without looking,” urged Xu Lanxin.

However, Jiang Huixin hesitated. This was a priceless treasure. If it was real, then the formation would be ruined once opened. After that, the wine would need to be drunk within a few days, or its power would gradually fade away.

Although the two of them were empresses of the Vermilion Bird Empire, they had only ever heard of such a legendary wine and had never seen it before.

Thus, the two of them were very curious. These two wine jugs had extraordinary origins. But once opened, they would be lost forever, akin to destroying a heavenly treasure.

“Big sister, open it! There are two jugs anyways. If they’re real, there will still be one more. What if that little fellow was toying with us? You saw how strange he was. I feel like he really would be capable of anything,” said Xu Lanxin.

If Long Chen really had given them two counterfeits thinking that they wouldn’t open them, wouldn’t it be embarrassing if one day, someone opened one jug in front of everyone to find it empty or backed with some terrible wine?

After hesitating for a long time, Jiang Huixin finally decided to slowly open the seal. As soon as the seal was touched, a fiery energy blew away her hand.

The next moment, the wine jug floated in the air, a vast aura erupting out of it like a volcano, causing the entire palace to shake.

Countless runes lit up on the walls, pillars, floor, and ceiling. The defensive formation was automatically triggered.

Seeing this, the two of them exchanged a look. It seemed that this wine was not fake.

The seal on the jug turned into two layers of runes flowing around it. When that happened, a brilliant bird cry rang out as if it had come from ancient times, accompanied by a burst of divine light.

When the jug’s runes all lit up, the two women could vaguely see the image of a Vermilion Bird raising its wings. Following that, a dense wine fragrance emerged, somehow causing the temperature to rapidly rise.

In the end, the Vermilion Bird flew out of the jug and flew once around the hall before slowly fading away. As it disappeared, divine flame energy slowly fell.

After that, the palace stopped shaking and the formations faded away. Everything returned to normal.

However, now the hall was filled with the scent of wine. Just smelling it could intoxicate someone. Now when they looked at the jug, they saw that the Vermilion Bird on it was gone. As for the seven clouds, they were still there, but they were growing dim.

Jiang Huixin and Xu Lanxin exchanged a look, seeing each other’s shock. Jiang Huixin then took out two cups.

She slowly poured the wine into the cups. At first, the wine was amber, but after being poured into the cup, it actually began to boil, looking like roiling lava. The powerful flame fluctuations shook their hearts.

After that, they raised their cups and gulped the wine down in one go. When it passed through their throats, it was even more fiery than they had expected. In the mouth it was like honey, covering their tongue and teeth with its flavor. But when it entered the stomach, a rich heat rapidly spread throughout their bodies.

The next moment, flames ignited throughout their bodies. Even when they were actually set ablaze by this wine, they slowly closed their eyes, immersing themselves within the flames. In their minds, the image of the Vermilion Bird soaring in the sky above a sea of pear flowers appeared.

The two of them only opened their eyes after a long moment, unable to calm themselves.nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

“This Vermilion Bird Pear Flower Wine is stronger than the legends. Even with our high cultivation bases, our energy was further purified. Perhaps this can give us an opportunity to break through our current bottleneck! This gift is too precious!” Jiang Huixin looked at the tiny jug of wine with a complicated expression.

Although it was only a tiny jug of wine, the space inside could fit thousands of cups of wine. Moreover, wine on this level was something priceless, even if it was just a single drop.

“That child has a heart.” Xu Lanxin sighed. She hadn’t liked Long Chen before, but after he had taken out such a priceless treasure, she had no choice but to revise her judgment.

In truth, Long Chen had no idea just how precious this gift was. It was simply prepared by Xia Guhong for Long Chen to be given to the two empresses, and Long Chen only did as he said.

“If you accept other people’s food, you can’t say no to them. Let’s go. We’ll get Xiaoyun to try it as well.” Jiang Huixin picked up the wine jug.

“If big brother Xiaoyun knows it is from Long Chen, he definitely won’t drink it.” Xu Lanxin shook her head. She understood his temper far too well.

“No problem. He doesn’t need to know it was from Long Chen. We can use something else and pretend that it was Long Chen’s gift, then give him the wine. Once he knows, it’ll be too late.” Jiang Huixin smiled.

“That’s a good idea.” Xu Lanxin laughed. The two of them left the palace just like that, laughing.

…

“Long Chen!”

Long Chen had just left the palace and had not gone far under the lead of a eunuch when he heard someone calling to him.

He turned in delight to see Yu Qingxuan wearing an imperial dress. She was like a noble fairy appearing before him, wearing a sweet smile on her face as beautiful as a flower blooming.

“Qingxuan!”

Long Chen hastily walked to her side. However, just as he reached out to grab her hands, a large figure blocked his way.

“What mountain village did you come out of to not know the rules? You dare to show disrespect to the princess?”
