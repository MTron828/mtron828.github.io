Chapter 2931 Boss San is Mighty

Today was also the day for the immortal competition’s winners to check in. However, Mu Qingyun and the others had been too excited and had moved out in advance.

They had been stalled a bit by the rainbow cranes on the way, but they still arrived a bit earlier than Luo Bing and the others. By the time the immortal institute’s disciples arrived, they saw that Li Cai and the others had been knocked down.

As for Long Chen, he was surrounded by hundreds of people. It was a chaotic sight that dumbfounded them.

“Qingyun, what happened here? Why are you fighting?” asked Luo Bing.

“Because… Actually, I don’t know either.” Mu Qingyun thought about it for a while and suddenly realized that she also had no idea why a fight had broken out here.

“What?”

Luo Bing was speechless. “Even before entering the inner academy Long Chen already started a fight.”

“This is already the second. We had another fight on the way here,” said Zhong Ling helplessly.

Hearing this, even Luo Bing couldn’t help sighing. Had Long Chen gotten addicted to fighting?

“Let’s first join in.” Luo Ning rolled up her sleeves. Just as she was about to attack, Mu Qingyun stopped her. It was forbidden to use weapons here, so for a woman to join in would put her at too great of a disadvantage. That was especially true for the Immortal Institute’s disciples. They had weaker physical bodies, and since they couldn’t use magical arts, they would naturally be at an immense disadvantage. After all, those were Four Peak experts. Other than Long Chen, none of them could actually fight them head-on.

“Don’t spread out your attacks! Work together to close in on him! Don’t let him dodge- aiya!” A Four Peak expert tried to give orders, but Long Chen deftly weaved through the crowd, knocking down everyone he touched. This person had received a kick to the abdomen and tumbled back. As a result, the pain made it impossible for him to stand again.

The other Four Peak experts joined into a circular wall around Long Chen, pressing down on him from every direction. This was the only way to stop his strange movements.

“Attack!”

Over a hundred people stepped forward at once, some jumping into the air to seal all paths for Long Chen to dodge.

“Blast away!”

Long Chen suddenly let out a shout. His voice was like thunder, and those people charging at him were instantly blown back like a flower blossoming. They then tumbled into the distance.

With a single qi wave, Long Chen’s surroundings were emptied. He had two people in his hand as well. Those two lay there like mud, their bones broken.

Those two were the unlucky ones. At that moment, Long Chen had grabbed them and used them as human weapons, swinging them wildly to knock everyone else away. Thus, the two of them had passed out.

However, Long Chen already showed some restraint, as he had picked out the two with the strongest physical bodies. He had not attacked them this entire time just to prepare for such a moment, and the facts showed that it was truly correct to leave himself more outs.

The gate now had a mass of people lying in front of it, and only seventy to eighty guards were still standing. However, when they looked at Long Chen, they were filled with terror. They no longer dared to charge forward.

Even hundreds of them had been unable to do anything to Long Chen. With their remaining numbers, they would just be asking for a beating.

“Nice!”

Cheers rang out after a moment of silence. The spectators then began to clap for Long Chen’s display.

“Haha, how satisfying. These bastards also made things difficult for me when I came.”

“Junior brother, good job. In the inner academy, you can’t be a coward, or you won’t have a place for yourself.”

These spectators had been bullied by others when they first joined the academy. Regrettably, they hadn’t known things that they knew now, and they also didn’t have the power that Long Chen had. Thus, seeing these guards get put in their place, they felt particularly refreshed.

“Are we still playing? If not, I’m going to go check in,” said Long Chen, tossing the two half-dead fellows to the ground.

“Brat, don’t think that a powerful physical body means that you can be arrogant. If it weren’t for the academy’s rules, we’d have beaten you to a pulp,” cursed one of the disciples who was lying on the ground.

They were not allowed to use their cultivation base, their cultivation technique, their Battle Skills, their weapons, and many other advantages that they had here. That was why this beating was particularly vexing. It wasn’t that their power was inferior, but the rules were inhibiting them.

Long Chen then walked up to that person and patted his face with a dangerous expression. “You shouldn’t complain. You should thank your academy’s rules, or you would currently be in the netherworld complaining to a Yama King.”

For some reason, being stared at so closely by Long Chen made that person’s hair stand on end. He felt like he was staring into the eyes of a terrifying beast that had once more consumed him. The sensation of death filled his heart.

Seeing that this person wasn’t talking any longer, Long Chen slowly stood and patted some dust off of his body. He then walked over to Li Cai and pulled him out. At this time, the other Unfettered Alliance disciples were also helped up.

Although they were injured, it was just a battle with physical bodies, so the wounds weren’t severe. After all, no one had dared to strike them in their vital regions, so they could still stand. Only some people had some trouble and needed to be supported.

The first words out of Li Cai’s mouth were. “Boss San is mighty.”

“Brother San, we…” Mu Qingyun walked over a bit uneasily. They hadn’t participated in that battle, so they felt bad.

Long Chen waved her off. “This was a battle between men who had nothing better to do. It was nonsense. Wouldn’t you have been laughed at by others for joining in?” Long Chen waved to Luo Bing and Luo Ning. “Let’s go check in.”

Luo Bing and Luo Ning stared at him speechlessly. What a carefree disposition. After beating people, he just walked off like nothing had happened. Even his smile was so bright.

The guards also struggled to crawl up now, but some people couldn’t walk and needed to be carried away. Eight people were left at the gate to serve their duty, while the rest left. It would probably cost quite a bit of money for them to recover.

However, Long Chen ignored them. He asked the spectators where to check in, and with their guidance, they were quickly done. They finally received their official status plates as disciples of the inner academy. Starting now, they were elite disciples of the inner academy.

Li Cai and the others practically danced with excitement despite having bloody and swollen faces. This was something so great that it brought honor to their ancestors.

After obtaining their new status plates, they had seven days of free time. During this time, they could celebrate with some of their friends in the inner academy and say goodbye, send word to their families, handle administrative matters, etc.

After seven days, they would no longer be allowed to freely come and go, and would have to keep up with the cultivation system in the inner academy. Their freedom would be limited.

Just as Long Chen and the others finished the procedure and were leaving, they found that the door out of the check-in location was blocked by a new group of people.
