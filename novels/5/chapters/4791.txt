Chapter 4780 Ten Moves

“Two Earth Saints?!”

If they weren’t personally witnessing it, they wouldn’t dare to believe this. The Celestial race had actually sent out two Earth Saints to handle Long Chen.

Previously, Long Chen had been suppressing the first Earth Saint, not giving him a chance to breathe. If Long Chen had continued to keep up the upper hand, perhaps he would have had a chance to defeat the first Earth Saint.

Before this, the junior generation of experts had felt their blood boiling with excitement, especially the ones from outside the Sovereign Emperor Heaven. It was like Long Chen was using his power to show that even if they weren’t from the Sovereign Emperor Heaven, they could still laugh arrogantly here.

That was why most newcomers were hoping that Long Chen could win. After all, it was like they could see themselves in him. They were almost cheering when they saw Long Chen have the upper hand. But now that another Earth Saint had appeared, they were all enraged. The Celestial race was absolutely shameless.

Long Chen was sent flying by the second Earth Saint’s sneak attack. However, he showed no anger on his face, only icy killing intent.

“Although I knew that your Celestial race was shameless, I didn’t expect you to be shameless to this extent. You’ve given me a new understanding of shamelessness. Do you have more people? You can call them all out now!” said Long Chen arrogantly. Even against two Earth Saints, he showed no hint of fear. He did not appear any less imposing than the two of them.

Long Chen’s words were like a clear slap in the face to these two Earth Saints. As Earth Saints, even within the Sovereign Emperor Heaven, they were powerful figures with their own prestige. Hence, to fight a Divine Venerate one on one was already extremely embarrassing, and to gang up on one was a complete joke.

“What are you doing? I was only probing his power. That was why I was just defending!” roared the first Earth Saint.

“I... I couldn’t handle how arrogant this brat was acting. I wanted to teach him a lesson as well. What are you up to? Stop wasting time! If you can’t do it yourself, get out of the way and I’ll teach him what real power is!” retorted the Earth Saint.

Their acting skill wasn’t bad, but the crowd watched them apathetically. Some even sneered. Who would have thought such childish excuses would come from the mouth of two Earth Saints?

Just as Long Chen said, they had truly brought everyone’s understanding of shamelessness to a new level, making a mockery of the existence known as Earth Saints.

“Keep acting. I’ll wait for you to finish and throw all the dignity of the Celestial race. Oh, sorry, I misspoke. I forgot that the Celestial race has always been this shameless. How could there be any dignity to lose?” declared Long Chen with a smile. His apology was even more unbearable than a curse to these Earth Saints.

“Brat, I let you launch a few moves without attacking back due to your age! You don’t know how high the heavens are! If you can last...” The first Earth Saint shouted, but his words suddenly got stuck in his throat.

How many moves did Long Chen have to endure for this Earth Saint to spare him? The Earth Saint was originally going to say three because Yue Wuxu hadn’t even managed to endure three moves from Long Chen. Killing Long Chen that way would win back some face for the Celestial race.

However, it wasn’t realistic for him to kill Long Chen in three moves. Ten moves? He found that it would still be very difficult. A hundred moves? What would be the point of that? Everyone was looking at him as his mouth was opening and closing, but no words came out of it.

“How about a hundred thousand moves? Otherwise, you wouldn’t have any confidence!” interjected Guo Ran loudly.

Hearing this, people almost burst into laughter despite the tense situation. Everyone could see that this Earth Saint had misspoken and had now dug a hole for himself in a quicksand. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

“The main thing is whether or not he can last that long against boss,” said Gu Yang with a disdainful tone.

Two Earth Saints had joined forces against Long Chen, and it enraged the Dragonblood warriors. However, they knew that it wasn’t the time to attack yet. They could only abuse them verbally.

“I’ll bet my life that he can’t last ten moves against boss.”

Just then, a completely emotionless voice rang out, and to everyone’s surprise, the speaker was Yue Zifeng.

Previously, all of their attention had been on Long Chen. However, when they looked at Yue Zifeng, they were shocked to find that he wasn’t a Heavenly Doyen.

Although Long Chen also wasn’t a Doyen, his overwhelming Blood Qi terrified everyone. On the other hand, Yue Zifeng’s Blood Qi fluctuations were weak, and he lacked any Heavenly Dao fluctuations. However, when they looked at him, their souls shuddered.

Some people tried to use some probing arts to examine him, but all of them directly felt a sharp pain in their eyes, as if someone had just cut them with a blade. This discovery shocked these experts.

“A powerful general doesn’t have weak soldiers. This person is truly terrifying.” Only now did these people realize that Yue Zifeng was also an exceedingly terrifying existence.

“Ten moves? Hahaha!” The Earth Saint who had been lost for words laughed furiously.

Defeating him in ten moves? What an absolutely wild and insulting statement. Although he knew that Yue Zifeng was perhaps intentionally antagonizing him by saying this, he was still enraged.

“Foolish brat, you will regret your ignorance!” The Earth Saint clenched his teeth, and like a provoked beast, he slowly walked toward Long Chen.

As the tension mounted, the hearts of onlookers quivered, and they instinctively withdrew further, bracing themselves for an imminent clash to the death.

Long Chen lifted Evilmoon from his shoulder, slicing through the void with two swift strokes. Tilting his head slightly, he let out a resigned sigh.

“Zifeng, you’re really making things hard on me. Fine, I can’t let my brother lose face...”

Long Chen’s smile suddenly vanished. Waves of palpable killing intent then emanated from him as he aimed Evilmoon directly at the Earth Saint.

“I will take your head in ten moves!”
