Chapter 3796 Good Wishes

Long Chen instantly understood that Mo Nian didn’t know this person at all. He had only dragged Long Chen here to eat this person’s food and drink his wine. But they had been discovered.

Mo Nian ran off on his own. Being stared at by this many people, Long Chen had the urge to jump into a hole.

However, he was quite smart and quickly thought of how to deal with this situation. He sighed and emotionally looked at the woman. “Since you ask, I’ll tell you the truth. I’ve long since secretly been in love with you…”Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

Every person’s expression changed when they heard this. This was a wedding reception. Was he trying to start a fight?

The wife’s expression also changed. She didn’t recognize Long Chen at all.

Before they could say anything, Long Chen continued, “Let me put it this way. I came without any intention of leaving alive. To have my beloved be taken away, what was the point of living? I was planning on deciding life and death with you after the wedding reception, but I see your love for each other. You, you are more handsome than me, and your cultivation base is higher. I truly can’t compare to you. I feel like the two of you are truly a perfect pair. Fine, I won’t quibble with you. You’ve taken my beloved woman, and I’ve eaten a meal from you. With one plate of stir-fry pork, we’re even.”

Long Chen swaggered to the table and in front of countless dumbfounded gazes, he took a plate of stir-fry pork and walked out. He ate as he walked, no one stopping him.

“What? That works?!”

When Long Chen walked out, Mo Nian was waiting outside. Seeing him easily escape that embarrassing predicament, Mo Nian was completely shocked.

“Can you be more serious? You, the great future leader of the Limitless Palace, really have to con people out of their food? Can you have some shame?” demanded Long Chen.

“Tch, my master told me that a person cannot have any shame, or they will lose out. Let’s go eat from the next place,” said Mo Nian contrarily. He actually dragged Long Chen to another feast in the distance.

“Ah, I’m not going to go. My stomach isn’t that big. This plate is enough for me. You go, and I’ll wait for you,” said Long Chen as he munched on his food. He didn’t want to get conned by this fellow again.

“Alright, then just wait. I didn’t eat my fill just now, so I’ll make up for it there. If I’m noticed, I’ll do the same thing as you.” Mo Nian directly went over to their feast.

Long Chen was speechless. However, thinking about it, he had to at least admire that Mo Nian had retained his childish innocence even now. He truly was living a simple, carefree life. That wasn’t bad either.

…

There were all kinds of feasts being held. Mo Nian came to a place that he was rather familiar with. Seeing the people here toasting, he randomly picked a seat, not caring whose it was and began to eat.

“Hey, who are you?”

Mo Nian had only eaten a few mouthfuls before someone noticed him. They didn’t look at him kindly.

“Me? Ah, cough, I came to congratulate you. I hope you have such a joyous day every year…”

However, before he could even finish his act, the expressions of the people around him changed. Killing intent actually covered him.

“We’re carrying out a funeral feast here. You wish such an event on us every year?” demanded a Divine Venerate furiously.

Only then did Mo Nian realize that there was a funeral hall in the distance. His jaw dropped.

…

Long Chen had just finished his food when he saw Mo Nian running back in a panic. He couldn’t help asking, “You finished eating so quickly?”

“You damn bastard, if you have guts, then don’t run!”

Following that, Long Chen saw countless experts charging over with furious expressions. It seemed that they wanted to tear Mo Nian apart.

Seeing this, Long Chen hastily fled with Mo Nian. In Clear Sky City, people didn’t dare to actually fight. Hence, in the end, those people chased them for a bit before leaving.

“What did you do? Did you seduce the new wife?” asked Long Chen speechlessly.

“Don’t even talk about it.” Mo Nian thought about explaining it, but then thinking about how Long Chen would laugh him to death, he decided to just keep his mouth shut.

Mo Nian brought Long Chen around for a stroll. As a result, Long Chen saw many buildings with the Dragonblood Legion’s name written on them. They had the name of Mo Nian’s rented palace on them as well.

Mo Nian smiled. “Those are all notices that I placed. They are spread throughout all the conspicuous areas within Clear Sky City. As long as someone from the Dragonblood Legion comes here, they’ll immediately join us. With this method, I found over seventy Dragonblood warriors. I’m sure that as time passes, even more will come. They’ve probably received my message.”

Long Chen nodded. With this, as long as the Dragonblood Legion’s people came to this city, they would see the notices. Mo Nian truly had thought this through.

Mo Nian brought Long Chen around to see these things so that he could be at peace. He understood Long Chen’s heart and knew that he longed to reunite with his brothers.

Originally, Mo Nian was planning on bringing Long Chen around the market to see if he needed anything available. The current Mo Nian was a moneybags with more money than he could spend.

However, Long Chen declined. He had to go into seclusion for a few days to activate the fifth star of the battle armor. Once he got used to it, he could then activate the sixth star and then the complete Seven Star Battle Armor.

Once they were back in the palace, they found that Jiang Lei and the others had yet to awaken. Hence, Long Chen directly entered seclusion. The palace had a luxurious training room. Six hours later, Long Chen had activated the fifth star, and violet qi swirled around him. His aura grew denser and sharper.

When he came out of seclusion, he was pleasantly surprised to see that three more Dragonblood warriors had found this place thanks to Mo Nian’s notices.

At this time, Jiang Lei and the others finally woke up. Long Chen then distributed the Heavenly Dao Fruits. Seeing them directly become Supreme experts after consuming this fruit, Mo Nian’s eyes almost popped out of his head.

“Brother, do you have extra fruits? Don’t forget a portion for my Mo family!” said Mo Nian enviously.

“Have you found the disciples of your Mo family?” asked Long Chen.

“I’ve found over three thousand of them and arranged a place for them to cultivate. I wonder…” Mo Nian was a bit embarrassed to ask for such a heaven-defying treasure, but he couldn’t help asking for some for his family.

“That’s a minor matter. Your Mo family’s brothers are my brothers. What the Dragonblood warriors have, you will also have.” Long Chen patted Mo Nian’s shoulder and promised. Was he lacking such a thing?

Mo Nian was delighted. Three days later, Long Chen finished activating the sixth star. He was only one step away from the Seven Star Battle Armor.

Moreover, the current Six Star Battle Armor was already ten times stronger than the old Six Star Battle Armor. Long Chen had immense confidence due to this.

At this time, everything was going according to Mo Nian’s expectations. Countless people were coming to Clear Sky City, and the Dragonblood warriors were also coming from all directions. There were already over five hundred of them.

Long Chen gave every single one of them a suitable Heavenly Dao Fruit. They now had over five hundred Supreme experts.

Suddenly, a tablet on Long Chen’s waist lit up. Long Chen was delighted. “Guo Ran and Xia Chen have come as well!”
