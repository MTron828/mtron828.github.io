Chapter 4530 Corrupt God Bone

“I didn’t expect the Heavenly Corrupt Sect’s foundation to be so terrifying.”

Within a majestic and grand palace, Long Chen couldn’t help but suck in a cold gasp of air.

There were only a few dozen people inside this hall, and they all treated Long Chen as an important guest. Other than the Sage King, the others were all higher-ups of the mixed beast race.

Through their explanation, Long Chen finally learned why they hadn’t pursued the Heavenly Corrupt Sect after taking the upper hand.

The Heavenly Corrupt Sect was just a portion of the Corrupt God’s legacy that was scattered throughout the world of the ninth heaven. To make things worse, they had a piece of the Corrupt God’s bone inside their main altar.

It was the original Corrupt God’s true bone, and it possessed unimaginable power. So, if the mixed beast race’s people were to launch an assault on their headquarters, the Corrupt sect master could simply use that bone to end the mixed beast race’s Sage King in a blow.

As a result, the mixed beast race could only adopt a passive defense and had to drive off the Heavenly Corrupt Sect each time they attacked. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

After all, the Corrupt God’s legacy extended beyond the Heavenly Corrupt Sect. If the Heavenly Corrupt Sect truly felt threatened, they would ask for aid from the other heirs to the Corrupt God’s legacy. Thus, even if the mixed beast race were a hundred times stronger than they were now, they wouldn’t dare to push the Heavenly Corrupt Sect too much.

After learning this, Long Chen was taken aback. He hadn’t expected the Corrupt God’s legacy to be so terrifying.

“That’s why despite having the upper hand, we can’t kill Xie Fei. At the critical moment, the sect master can use the Corrupt God’s bone through space to save him, as he is the divine son of the Corrupt God. Thus, today’s battle result is basically the best we can ask for,” sighed the Sage King.

Long Chen couldn’t help but sigh as well. No wonder his intuition had told him that he wouldn’t be able to kill Xie Fei. It seemed that the sect master still had a terrifying trump card up his sleeves.

“I never expected to encounter another divine son here.” At this moment, a strange expression appeared on Long Chen’s face.

In the mortal world, those so-called divine legacies had produced quite a few divine sons and divine daughters, but Long Chen had essentially slain all of them.

“What’s so amazing about being a divine son? I’ll kill him sooner or later!” snorted Feng You from the side.

Clearly, she still didn’t want to accept her defeat. If Long Chen hadn’t intervened, she would be dead by now. However, for someone as prideful as her, such an outcome was utterly unacceptable.

“If it weren’t for his weapon receiving the blessing of the Corrupt God’s bone, I wouldn’t be afraid of him at all. He’s basically cheating.”

The Sage King shook his head in disappointment. “Child, a battle is not a game. You must use any means necessary to kill your opponent, so there’s no such thing as cheating, nor are there so many ifs. Unfortunately, my head isn’t very agile, and you’re not much better off in that regard. How am I supposed to pass down the position of race leader to you like this?”

The Sage King shook his head and sighed helplessly. After all, the mixed beast race was not a race with a pure bloodline inheritance; they could be likened to an alliance.

All these beast art cultivators had bonded as a family although they had no bloodline relations between them. After all, in order to survive and strive for more resources, they had to band together, pooling their strengths for greater power. This unity shielded them from being devoured individually.

Among their ranks were humans who had formed bonds with the demonic beast race through mating, while some of them had close connections with the demonic beast race and could call them for aid if required.

Some of them had simply absorbed a strong demonic beast’s blood, hoping to produce a monstrous offspring with the talents of both races. The outcome of such unions varied, as different individuals and demonic beasts produced diverse kinds of offspring. While some could revert to their original form after the merger, others were permanently transformed.

As a result, the mixed beast race was regarded as mutants by both the human race and the demonic beast race, often being overlooked and ignored.

The merger of two bloodlines and souls resulted in the mixed beast race having a relatively lower level of intellect. They tended to be quite naive, and their cognitive abilities were not particularly sharp. Individuals who had merged with demonic beasts possessing low intelligence ended up with absolute garbage IQ. As a consequence, there weren’t many smart experts throughout the entire mixed beast race.

Despite having hundreds of Saints, they had only employed a few dozen of them in this battle because the rest lacked the necessary intelligence—their brains seemed to be made of muscle rather than actual brains. Like ducks startled by thunder, they proved challenging to command, so the higher-ups didn’t include them in the battle.

However, one good aspect of the mixed beast was that they were very united. As long as their leaders gave the order, no one would question it. Especially in battle, the mixed beast race’s warriors were unafraid of death.

Hence, even though their heads weren’t too bright, their advantages made up for this. As long as they had a comparatively smart leader, no one would dare to provoke them.

The Sage King of the mixed beast race had been their pillar all this time. However, he had grown old, so he wanted to raise a new leader to lead them.

Endowed with the ancient phoenix’s bloodline, Feng You stood out as the strongest and most talented expert among the mixed beast race’s junior generation. Not only was she strong, but she also exhibited intelligence and the qualities of a natural leader. Because of this, the Sage King had always wanted to groom her as his successor.

So, for his successor to say something so childish disappointed him.

“This time, it was my fault. The Heavenly Corrupt Sect’s master out-schemed my foolish head. However, Feng You, your intelligence is not inferior to Xie Fei’s. You win some and you lose some, and to be able to accept defeat is the path of the king. You can’t make excuses for the sake of our race’s future,” explained the Sage King solemnly.

“I understand.” Feng You lowered her head.

Observing her calm expression, the Sage King didn’t press the point any further. He then shifted his attention back to Long Chen. “For you to aid us in our time of need, my mixed beast race will carve this gratitude into our hearts. However... there are some words I want to express that may be offensive.”

“Please, instruct me, senior,” Long Chen hastily replied.

“Although your power is impressive, the reason you could make Xie Fei suffer is that you relied on that mysterious cauldron. Xie Fei will learn from his mistakes this time and won’t make the same mistake. You relied entirely on luck this time. So, in the future, you should avoid fighting Xie Fei,” advised the Sage King carefully.

Long Chen laughed inside. This elder’s heart was good. He thought that Long Chen was too weak to fight Xie Fei, which proved that Long Chen’s acting skills were good enough to be able to trick this Sage King.

“Is senior warning me that my only ability is sneak attacking and exploiting other people’s ignorance? I already know that. I don’t dare to face that fellow directly,” Long Chen chuckled in response.

“No, you really are powerful. Youngsters shouldn’t be unduly humble,” the elder said, laughing when he saw that Long Chen wasn’t angry.

“Long Chen, don’t worry. You saved me this time, so this big sister will protect you for a lifetime!” Feng You exclaimed, throwing an arm around Long Chen's shoulder and laughing cheerfully.

“Hehe, then many thanks!” Long Chen laughed. This girl was going to protect him? Interesting.

At this moment, a furious roar echoed from the distance, forcing Feng You’s expression to shift drastically. Everyone then immediately rushed out of the palace.
