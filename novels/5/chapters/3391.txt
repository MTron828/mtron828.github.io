Chapter 3380 Black Sea’s Fiend Spirits

“What are those?!”

Long Chen felt like his hair was about to stand on end. From Leng Yueyan and Ming Cangyue’s terrified expressions, he knew that those were most likely the fiend spirits that they were most afraid of.

Furthermore, there wasn’t just one of them but millions. As they got closer, he saw that they were somewhat humanoid. However, they had frog-like legs and smooth heads covered in black lines.

They were over thirty meters tall, far smaller than those mountain-sized sea monsters. However, their auras were sinister and bloodthirsty. They wielded tridents in their hands. Now, they were slowly approaching as if he was prey on its deathbed struggle.

Leng Yueyan and Ming Cangyue were horrified. These fiend spirits possessed terrifying power that countered their divine energy. Even they didn’t dare to enter deep into the black sea.

The black sea’s barrier had already formed, and they had to use up a huge amount of their core divine energy to break through it. But they needed time to store up the necessary energy. With these fiend spirits coming, there was no time at all.

Just then, a sinister wind blew, and ripples appeared on the surface of the water, which was originally as smooth as a mirror. Following it, strange creaking sounds could be heard. In the distance, a broken ship slowly floated over.

The ship was rotting and decayed, while the canvas on the mast was in tatters. A weak wind blew it, causing it to creak. It sounded as if it was recounting its grief.

“A Ghost Ship!”

Leng Yueyan and Ming Cangyue were shocked. In all their time in the Netherworld, this was their first time seeing a Ghost Ship.

The Ghost Ship slowly floated straight toward Long Chen.

Long Chen was delighted. Perhaps he could use the Ghost Ship’s power to escape. He saw a long chain on the side.

However, while the sea monsters fled in terror, those fiend spirits were somehow not afraid of the Ghost Ship. They continued to slowly approach him.

“Scram!” Long Chen cursed furiously. He charged toward the Ghost Ship like it was a lifeline.

Unexpectedly though, those fiend spirits really did vanish with his roar. They vanished without a trace like they had never appeared in the first place.

Long Chen was startled. He didn’t know if they had simply reacted too slowly to the Ghost Ship, or if they really had been scared away by his domineeringness. He had no time to think about it and just charged up the Ghost Ship.

Just then, the Ghost Ship shuddered. In front of Long Chen’s stunned gaze, it slowly collapsed. It was as if some energy had cut off its final trace of vitality. The body of the ship fell apart like mud.

“How could I be this unlucky?!” Long Chen cursed furiously. Weren’t Ghost Ships supposed to last forever? Was this Ghost Ship simply unable to endure his bad luck?!

Just then, sharp pain wracked his chest. Something had pierced his chest and out his back. His blood then dyed the black water.

“Long Chen!”𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

Leng Yueyan and Ming Cangyue cried out in shock. This sudden attack was completely bizarre.

The sharp pain made it difficult for Long Chen to move. Moreover, there was a destructive power in the wound that almost made his body collapse.

It had to be known that the current Long Chen was in his full power state. He had his dragon scales supporting him, and the power of his physical body was at its peak.

But even in this state, that attack was like a sharp blade slicing through paper. It easily pierced his body.

The most terrifying thing was that Long Chen was unable to sense just what it was that had stabbed him.

The destructive energy quickly invaded his body. Without Long Chen doing anything, the primal chaos bead seemed to have sensed the danger to his life, and so life energy poured out. As a result, the resplendent Wood Foundation Divine Trees withered at a speed visible to the naked eye.

It had to be known that in their current state, their life energy was practically limitless. But this strange attack was using up their energy rapidly.

Long Chen looked behind him. He saw something stained with his blood slowly floating away on the water.

“Get back here!” Long Chen clenched his teeth and grabbed it. It only looked to be the size of a palm, but when he grabbed it, he suddenly felt a sharp pain. Three of his fingers were severed.

Only then did Long Chen realize that it was some sharp tip, like a broken sword. Long Chen’s fingers had brushed against its sharp edge, which instantly severed them.

Long Chen was shocked and enraged. It was a black sword tip the exact same color as the water. It was as if it was merged with the sea. It had no aura at all and was almost impossible to sense. If it wasn’t stained with his blood, he wouldn’t have been able to sense it.

Long Chen had never seen something so terrifying. Using the jagged saber that Leng Yueyan had given him, he tried to grab it, only for a hole to be cut into the saber as soon as they touched.

This saber was a weapon of a Nethergod, but in front of that sword tip, it was as weak as paper.

Long Chen caught up to the sword tip and finally had a chance to carefully pinch it and pick it up. After obtaining it, Long Chen was delighted and charged back to the surface of the water.

When he met the barrier, with a light swing of the sword tip, the barrier was instantly pierced through. He easily came out of the water.

“Long Chen!”

Leng Yueyan and Ming Cangyue were overjoyed. They had felt powerless just now and had really thought that Long Chen would die right in front of them. For the first time in their lives, they felt what true fear was.

Right now, Long Chen was as pale as paper, and the wound in his chest had yet to heal. Although it wasn’t getting worse, it was still a bloody hole.

He looked inside the primal chaos space. All the vegetation had withered to death, including the Devil Eye Water Lilies. In order to save his life, the primal chaos space had used up all the life energy available.

Long Chen then tossed the pitch-black sword tip into the primal chaos space. After that, he turned toward the two of them. “Let’s not stay here any longer than we have to. Help me gather those corpses. They’re useful to me.”

Long Chen was in an extremely weak state right now. Just being struck by the sword tip sucked away all his energy. He didn’t even have the energy to stand.

Ming Cangyue immediately gave orders for her subordinates to gather the corpses. Once the battlefield was cleaned up, they immediately left.

As for Long Chen, he was so tired that he fell asleep in Ming Cangyue’s embrace. After sleeping an unknown amount of time, he woke up from a dream and found himself in a palace.

Seeing Ming Cangyue and Leng Yueyan by his side, Long Chen sighed. “I forgot to tell you not to immediately go back in case those fiend spirits chase us.”

Ming Cangyue rubbed his cheek and softly said, “You fool, we’ve condensed a new divine core here. We can directly use the transportation formation to leave. Why worry about crossing the black sea again?”

Long Chen clapped his forehead. He had actually forgotten this. Long Chen then checked his wound. It had closed, but there were still black lines weaving on top of it like caterpillars crawling. He still wasn’t fully healed.

“Long Chen, just what was it that injured you?” asked Ming Cangyue.

Only then did Long Chen cautiously take out the black tip of the sword for them to examine.
