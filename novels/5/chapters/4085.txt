Chapter 4074 Battle of Heaven Venerates

“Ninth Elder, wait!”

The injured elder was grabbed by one of his comrades, stopping him.

“Seventh Elder, what are you doing?” roared the Ninth Elder, feeling furious as hell.

These three people were the Ye clan’s Seventh, Eighth, and Ninth Elders respectively. After the Ninth Elder was injured, as soon as he successfully fled, he summoned these two comrades of his.

At this moment, the Seventh Elder pointed at Long Chen and Uncle Tree.

“Who are you?” he demanded. “Why are you provoking my Ye clan? If you don’t give us a satisfactory explanation, you will die miserably today.”

While his tone was sharp, in truth, he was probing his enemy’s bottom line. After all, someone who could injure the Ninth Elder so badly could not be a nobody.

Although the Ninth Elder said that he had simply been careless, the Seventh Elder was not convinced. And indeed, when he spotted Uncle Tree, he could sense that Uncle Tree was a terrifying expert, his aura shaking the Seventh Elder’s heart.

“Provoke your Ye clan?”

Hearing this ridiculous statement, Long Chen and the others simply laughed in fury. They had clearly been helping the Ye clan, only to be repaid with enmity and an attack, and that was called a provocation? Could there even be people less reasonable than them?

Thus, Long Chen didn’t bother arguing and directly challenged them. “If you want to fight, then let’s fight. If you don’t, then scram. Where did all these worthless words come from?”

Long Chen was well aware that they wanted to know his backer. If he had a tough background that could challenge the Ye clan, then there would still be room for negotiation.

However, if his background was weaker than the Ye clan, then they would immediately kill him without misgivings.

In the cultivation world, there was an unwritten rule. If you were to be killed by someone without reporting your name and background, it would be hard to blame the killer.

The Ye clan might be an Eternal clan, but for them to want to figure out Long Chen’s background at this time, it proved that even Eternal clans did not possess absolute authority within the Nirvana Overflow Heaven. They also had forces that they were wary of. Otherwise, they wouldn’t bother testing Long Chen’s background.

“Since that’s the case, you can just die!”

The Seventh Elder immediately erupted when he saw that Long Chen wouldn’t reveal his identity, clearly looking down on them.

Three Heaven Venerates attacked at once, their manifestations covering the sky. It was like three celestial gods had descended, and the ten thousand Daos fell under their control. No one could resist them.

Seeing this scene, Uncle Tree was forced to make his move. As a result, the aura of the Undying race erupted, and a towering locust tree appeared before them, blocking their way.

“You’re from the Undying race!”

The three Heaven Venerates were startled. Uncle Tree had kept his aura concealed the entire time, so they were unable to see through his origins. But now, they recognized his aura.

BOOM!

Facing this mighty attack, the three experts of the Ye clan blocked together, the impact causing mountains to crumble and terrifying astral winds to rage throughout the mountain range.

As for Long Chen and the others, they had long since been prepared, but when the qi wave struck them, they were still blown back miserably. The power of Heaven Venerates wasn’t something that they could resist yet.

“They’re too powerful!” Xia Chen cried out. It was their first time witnessing a true battle between Heaven Venerates. To their surprise, even the shockwaves alone were already difficult to endure.

In an instant, the beautiful mountain range was destroyed. When Heaven Venerates fought, it was truly like the apocalypse. The cracks spreading in the sky from their blows shook people’s hearts.

“Is the Undying race so amazing?! You dare to be enemies with my Ye clan?! Courting death!” The Seventh Elder roared furiously. Upon learning Uncle Tree’s status, although he was a bit surprised, his misgivings were gone, so with his sword, he unleashed rays of light at Uncle Tree.

Now, he no longer had any hesitation about killing Long Chen and the others. Although the Undying race was powerful, their relationship with the human race was already bad, so killing them wouldn’t make a difference.

As the Seventh Elder’s sword slashed out, Uncle Tree snorted coldly. “The Undying race isn’t that amazing. But when it comes to killing the few of you, it shouldn’t take much effort.”

Uncle Tree was wooden and slow, wishing to simply get along with everyone. Moreover, he wasn’t easily angered. That was the only reason why he had managed to survive so long in the fiend eye. Someone with an explosive temper would have long since died from the outrage.

Uncle Tree suddenly slammed his hands together on the Seventh Elder’s sword. To everyone’s surprise, the monumental power within this sword directly vanished without a trace.

At the same time, a bark-like layer appeared on top of the sword and began to spread toward the Seventh Elder’s hand.

Seeing this scene, the Seventh Elder’s expression changed. He didn’t know what that was, but whatever it was, it gave him chills.

With a shout, his manifestation darkened and power poured into his sword, enabling him to escape Uncle Tree’s grasp.

The bark on his sword then shattered and fell to the ground, leaving large holes where it landed.

Those holes had just formed when it was like the land was infected. A layer of bark was rapidly spreading miles and miles on the ground; it was a shocking sight.

At this time, the Eighth and Ninth Elders’ attacks came, their two swords piercing toward Uncle Tree’s back.

All of a sudden, a violet rod appeared in Uncle Tree’s hand. As he smashed it at the two of them, it exuded violet divine light that turned the world purple.

BOOM!

The berserk impact tore through the land, causing lava to spurt out of the ground, turning this world into a sea of fire.

As the lava mixed with fragments of Heavenly Daos, waves of death spread in every direction, extinguishing all living beings around. Indeed, when Heaven Venerates fought, they brought endless destruction.

Long Chen and the others retreated further and further, but the astral winds coming from the battlefield still cut their cheeks. They appeared miniscule in front of Heaven Venerates.

“Heaven Venerates are incredibly powerful. As they are one with the Dao, and their will becomes law. With every move, the will of the heavens follows. There’s no way to fight them.” Yu Qingxuan could only sigh as she watched Uncle Tree fight the three Heaven Venerates.

The Heaven Venerate realm was a dividing line in the cultivation world. As a result, while Long Chen and the others could defeat multiple Earth Venerates without any fear, they were rather powerless in front of a Heaven Venerate.

This feeling of powerlessness mostly stemmed from the Heavenly Daos. The Heavenly Daos were controlled by Heaven Venerates, and if the Heavenly Daos did not wish for them to live, just how could they go against them?

“Three flowers merged into one, fusing with heaven and earth. They really aren’t easy to deal with. But the Dragonblood Legion has never submitted to the Heavenly Daos, so who cares about Heaven Venerates? Could it be that they are even greater than the heavens?” said Long Chen.

Ever since Long Chen started cultivating the Nine Star Hegemon Body Art, he had constantly been fighting the Heavenly Daos. What tribulation of his wasn’t one of sure death? However, he was still alive now, right?

Even one against three, Uncle Tree continued to fight, causing the world to darken from their power. However, Uncle Tree was not the slightest bit at a disadvantage. Even without the support of the Nether Emperor’s formation, he was still incredibly powerful.

Suddenly, a figure left the battlefield, shooting straight toward Long Chen and the others with an insidious expression.ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

“The elder’s too tough, so I’ll kill you brats first!” The Ninth Elder smiled sinisterly, killing intent erupting from his eyes.

“We’ll kill this bastard together!”

Seeing this scene, Long Chen reached behind him and clenched the Minghong Saber’s hilt. As for Guo Ran, Xia Chen, and the others, they felt their battle intent ignite into a blazing fire.
