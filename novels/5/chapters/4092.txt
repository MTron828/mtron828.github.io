Chapter 4081 Sage King Convention

In the Nirvana Overflow Heaven, there existed countless races and channels to other major worlds. In other words, compared to other heavens, it was possible to directly enter the Netherworld, Devil World, Undying World, and other worlds from here

Based on the historical records, after the Nirvana Overflow Heaven underwent that great battle, the flames of war spread throughout all worlds, piercing the walls between them. Even now, they had not healed.

This resulted in there being many pathways to other worlds from here. Since it was possible to directly reach the Netherworld from here, Long Chen instantly thought of Leng Yueyan and Ming Cangyue, as well as his brother, Wu Tian.

He hadn’t known Wu Tian for long, but the two were truly like-minded and were sincere brothers. He could tell that Wu Tian felt the same toward him.

Their fates were extremely similar, as were their characters, resulting in them being close. However, Wu Tian’s situation was not much better than Long Chen’s. He had even more enemies than Long Chen, and they were also stronger.

“If I have a chance, I’ll definitely go take a look in the Netherworld.” Long Chen took a deep breath and settled this. The world was enormous, and with his current power, he was too miniscule.

However, even so, arriving at the Nirvana Overflow Heaven brought him endless drive. If the Nirvana Overflow Heaven was connected to every major world, then his old friends would also be coming soon.

After getting a general understanding of the situation between the races and worlds of the Nirvana Overflow Heaven, Long Chen then focused on the human race’s information. When he read through it, he couldn’t help sighing.

He was shocked to find that over half of the Nirvana Overflow Heaven’s human forces were subordinates to Lord Brahma.

It had to be known that this was the Nirvana Overflow Heaven. Those who could actually establish a footing in this world had unimaginable power.

Just what kind of power did Lord Brahma possess to make the majority of the human race here loyal to him? This was beyond Long Chen’s expectations.

“Lord Brahma has not revealed himself in countless years, and the name of Divine Venerate Brahma is also something from countless years ago. No one knows what realm he has reached now. Has he already become Eternal? Otherwise, how could so many powers submit to him?”

Long Chen had known that Lord Brahma would be incredibly powerful. Otherwise, there was no way that a crafty schemer like Enpuda would be so loyal to him.

If Lord Brahma had truly reached the Eternal realm, then he would truly be terrifying. It had to be known that he was a god cultivator, and god cultivators were almost unmatched in the same realm. If Lord Brahma was an Eternal expert, then he had to be one of the strongest experts within the Eternal realm.

“Fuck, how is this bastard so powerful?!”

Long Chen cursed inside. Originally, he had thought that the distance between him and Lord Brahma was shrinking. But the closer he got, the more he realized that what he had seen was just the tip of the iceberg.

It seemed that he couldn’t truly fight Lord Brahma yet and still had to be careful. Before he had the power to challenge his subordinates, it would be foolish to go at him directly.

Long Chen also found that the human race had many domineering existences here. Some experts from mysterious sects and powers caused even the other races to feel great trepidation.

Amongst those forces were the four immemorial sects: the Zither, Chess, Calligraphy, and Painting Sects. They rarely fought with the rest of the world, but their reputation was such that even the other races didn’t dare to provoke them.

What Long Chen found particularly surprising was that the Wine God Palace was also present here. Long Chen didn’t know why Xia Guhong hadn’t mentioned it to him.

However, the Wine God Palace in the Nirvana Overflow Heaven was in tatters. It was said that it became ruins after the immemorial battle.

These ruins still had terrifying laws that prevented even Heaven Venerates from entering. Even getting close would make them light-headed, as if they were drunk. To his surprise, he found that some people had died of alcohol poisoning near the ruins.

Thus, this place was called the Wine God Palace, as well as the ruins of the Wine God. Legend was that Wine God’s portrait was present inside the ruins, but no one knew the truth of that.

Many people had asked the Violet Flame Heaven’s Wine God Palace to provide confirmation, but the latter never did. If the Wine God Palace was still present, why did they not repair the ruins? It was puzzling to the outside world.

Other than the four immemorial sects, there were other ancient inheritances as well. However, they were mostly low-key and rarely interacted with the outside world. As a result, people only knew their names, but not their true bodies.

Of course, no one dared to test them either because anyone who had previously done that had perished.

Other than the four immemorial sects and those mysterious powers, the most conspicuous forces would have to be the eight Eternal clans. They were all said to be part of the Heavenly Divinity race: the Long, Ye, Jiang, Zhao, Ji, Wang, Wei, and Qin clans.

Contrary to the other human forces, these eight clans were not low-key. Their activity was spread over a wide area, and they also had business with other races.

These eight clans were extremely powerful, nurturing innumerable prodigies who emerged with each passing day. Also, their relationships with other races were a mix, with them being friendly to some and hostile to others. But due to their immense power, even other races did not wish to provoke them.

It could be said that the eight Eternal clans were the representatives of the human race here. They were what intimidated the other races. If there was a war between the human race and other races, it was always these eight clans that mediated things. Normally, the other races would at least give some face to these eight clans.

Since that was the case, the eight clans were gradually pushed into being the representatives of the human race in the Nirvana Overflow Heaven. Of course, this only happened after they received approval from certain forces.

However, some mysterious forces with ancient inheritances didn’t show any interest in them. The four immemorial sects were also uninterested, being only spectators. As long as others didn’t provoke them, they wouldn’t provoke others.

“No wonder the Ye clan was so arrogant. It seems that they really view themselves as overlords of the human race. No one from the human race can defy their will,” said Long Chen.

The most active members of the human race were the eight Eternal clans, so they were practically in control over all the human race’s activity. Moreover, any forces that could compete with them simply ignored them, resulting in them being so arrogant.

“The Long, Ye, Jiang, Zhao, Ji, Wang, Wei, and Qin clans. I wonder what kind of relationships they have between themselves? If they are all united, it will be a bit troublesome.” Long Chen frowned.

According to the information that he had, the eight clans had little to do with Lord Brahma’s forces. They seemed to be afraid of him though and didn’t get involved with him.

Anyway, Lord Brahma was Long Chen’s mortal enemy, and now the Ye clan was also his enemy. It was not a good situation to be in.

“Boss, the guild master wishes to see you.” Just then, Guo Ran came in.

“Invite them in,” said Long Chen hastily. This was their territory, so he couldn’t be rude.

“Mister Long Chen, we just received some information today. I think that you will be very interested in it.” The guild master smiled and handed Long Chen a golden invitation card.

Long Chen was confused when he saw the words on the invitation.
