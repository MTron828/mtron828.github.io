Chapter 1878: Decisive Clash with Di Feng

Di Feng was fighting intensely against Yue Xiaoqian, but he wasn’t using his full power . He had seen that Yue Xiaoqian’s status could not be low within the original devil race, so he wanted to capture her alive . He hoped to learn the whereabouts of the original devil race from her .

The original devil race was the enemy of the entire continent . If he could really obtain the location of their headquarters, he could gather a giant force to annihilate them .

He also knew that Long Chen had a definite relationship with the original devil race, but they had never managed to find any proof .

If he could capture Yue Xiaoqian alive, then it didn’t matter whether or not Long Chen admitted it . He had plenty of ‘proof’, or at least ways to make proof that Long Chen was the puppet of the original devil race, that he had betrayed the human race . Then Long Chen would also become the enemy of the whole continent, and even anyone related to Long Chen would be annihilated .

That was why he didn’t want to use his full power . He wanted to find a chance to capture her alive . For him to defeat her wasn’t very difficult . The current Yue Xiaoqian was in a strange condition and unable to disguise herself as an Empyrean . Since she was also unable to use Heavenly Dao energy, she was relying entirely on her divine mark .

However, this place was not the Skyscraping World . Although she wasn’t suppressed here, she wasn’t supported either . So she was at an immense disadvantage fighting here .

Despite that, her power was still extremely great . To capture her alive was something even Di Feng couldn’t do without an opportunity .

Suddenly, Di Feng’s expression changed . He swung his arm, and a spear emitting an ancient aura appeared, stabbing behind him .

BOOM!

Mo Nian’s arrow struck the spear, causing a huge explosion . The surrounding experts jumped in fright . They all turned to see who had attacked, but all they saw was a streak of lightning .

A saber pierced through the air, and it was like all the killing intent in the world had been condensed within it . Di Feng had no choice but to give up on Yue Xiaoqian . His spear faced Long Chen’s Evilmoon .

BOOM!

Long Chen’s spear contained the power he had been accumulating on his way rushing over . He crashed into Di Feng like a shooting star .

Before this, Mo Nian’s aura had only knocked Di Feng back . But Long Chen’s saber sent Di Feng flying into the distance .

The air Di Feng passed through rumbled . It was like space was unable to bear the impact, and Di Feng was unable to stabilize himself .

Long Chen was truly infuriated . He wouldn’t allow anyone to attack his women .

Long Chen was covered in dragon scales, his divine ring was spinning behind him, and five stars revolved in his eyes .

Di Feng was startled, having never encountered such explosive power . His manifestation appeared behind him as he attempted to stabilize himself .

However, space continued to rumble as if it was about to explode . He was unable to force Long Chen off .

“It’s you!” Di Feng finally recognized Long Chen .

“How dare you injure my brother? I’ll make sure to get justice for him!” shouted Long Chen, killing intent overflowing out of him .

Mo Nian was startled . Since when had this fellow been such an upholder of justice? No, he was definitely just using him .

When Mo Nian saw Yue Xiaoqian’s expression, he instantly realized that Long Chen was making an excuse for himself .

Suddenly, Long Chen sent out a kick at Di Feng’s abdomen . Di Feng snorted and also sent a kick to meet Long Chen’s attack .

Both their bodies shook . But just at this moment, a ray of light pierced through the air, instantly reaching Di Feng . Di Feng had no choice but to twist his body away, and the arrow narrowly flew by his cheek . However, Di Feng’s expression was still calm . He was already familiar with Mo Nian’s attacks .

After dodging Mo Nian’s attack, Di Feng’s spear lit up, about to unleash an attack to force Long Chen away . Now that Long Chen was at such a close range, he was unable to unleash the full abilities of his spear .

However, just as he did this, a hand came from a strange angle and smacked him in the face .

Di Feng had managed to dodge Mo Nian’s arrow, but he wasn’t able to dodge Long Chen’s slap which was timed perfectly with the arrow . As a result, Long Chen sent him flying away .

The sound of this slap resounded through the air, shocking the surrounding experts .

“What?”

“That’s...?”

“How... is that possible?”

Hundreds of experts stared in dumbfounded shock . Their jaws dropped . Even having personally witnessed it, they couldn’t quite believe it . The future leader of the ancient family alliance, a peak expert, had actually been slapped in the face .

“Heavens, isn’t that Long Chen! And that’s Mo Nian! Everyone, attack!”

Someone finally reacted . Weapons began to blaze with light as hundreds of experts prepared to activate their divine items to kill Long Chen and Mo Nian .

However, the majority of them went after Mo Nian . One reason was because they were confident that Di Feng could kill Long Chen on his own, while another was that they hated Mo Nian more .

The majority of the experts here were from the ancient family alliance . All of them had a deep enmity with Mo Nian .

“Long Chen, die!”

Di Feng suddenly roared . The sound waves alone were like a giant wave crashing through the world . He was fully infuriated .

His manifestation changed, and a crowned figure appeared within it . That figure’s hands were in a seal, and divine light flowed out the seal . When its palm separated, they actually opened a gate before it . Immortal light flowed out of the gate and into Di Feng’s body .

With the support of this immortal light, Di Feng seemed to become an immortal king . He looked both wise and powerful . However, his aura didn’t match with his sinister expression .

“Die!” Di Feng’s spear pierced through the air at Long Chen . Immortal light sealed heaven and earth .

BOOM!

Long Chen slashed Evilmoon at the spear while also dodging to the side . As a result, his saber-image instantly shattered . Although he managed to avoid the spear, the shockwaves blew him back . He almost coughed up blood .

“This is a paragon art!”

BOOM! Di Feng’s spear tore through the ground, splitting the mountain range . The power of his attack was appalling .

With Di Feng using a paragon art, Long Chen couldn’t tarry . His Yuan Spirit formed hand seals, and thunderforce gathered throughout the world .

Thunder rumbled and a berserk aura rose . Lightning filled the world, immersing Long Chen . Upon extending a hand, a lightning spear appeared in Long Chen’s grasp .

BANG!

The two spears collided . Long Chen’s lightning spear actually exploded .

“This is just a quasi paragon art . You aren’t even connected to another world’s energy and are still suppressed by the laws of heaven and earth . You think that’s enough to resist a true paragon art? What a joke,” sneered Di Feng as he attacked again .

“Does your face not hurt?” sneered Long Chen, another lightning spear condensing in his hands . He once more threw it at Di Feng .Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Yet again, his spear was shattered .

“Die!” Di Feng’s spear was merciless and pierced toward Long Chen . However, his expression quickly changed .

Long Chen was now forming hand seals himself . A lightning dragon had appeared around him, and it formed a swirling lightning portal .

As the portal was forced open, a torrent of terrifying lightning burst out of it, pouring into this world .

Long Chen’s lightning spear condensed once more . He smiled . When Long Chen connected to the Morning Dao Lightning Field, he felt a powerful surge of thunderforce pouring into his body . He had limitless energy .

His spear pierced forward, and the lightning domain behind him gave him immense power .

This time, an ear-ringing explosion occurred when the two spears collided, blinding people . Both of them were blown back by the immense power .

The instant those two spears collided, amongst the endless lightning, seventy-two dragon teeth silently pierced toward Di Feng .

Di Feng was startled . Long Chen’s attacks came one after another . He didn’t even know when those dragon teeth had appeared, as they were hidden in the lightning .

The huge figure within Di Feng’s manifestation suddenly formed a hand seal, and rays of immortal light shot out like flying swords .

As the dragon teeth collided with the flying swords, the void shook and exploded .

Immortal light filled the battlefield, making it so people were unable to see what was going on .

Di Feng suddenly let go of his spear . Floating in the air, he formed hand seals rapidly . The figure within his manifestation followed his movements exactly .

As Di Feng formed those seals, his spear seemed to awaken . It blazed with light, and the immense power caused space to twist .

The runes on the spear began to light up one by one according to some kind of sequence . When the final rune lit up, the spear grew in size, becoming a giant heavenly spear .

“Void Breaking Overlord Spear!”

When the spear’s power reached a peak, the clash between the flying swords and dragon teeth was coming to an end . With a roar, Di Feng sent his giant spear piercing forward .

Just as the spear shot forward, on the other side, the endless lightning domain also vanished . All that lightning had been compressed into one spear .

“Wild Lightning Soul Battle Spear!”

Long Chen also let out a shout as the two of them unleashed their strongest attacks at the same time .
