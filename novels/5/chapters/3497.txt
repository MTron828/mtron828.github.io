Chapter 3486

Seeing this scene, countless experts fled for their lives. They didn’t know who Boss Long San was, but they didn’t dare to get close to that Ghost Ship.

It was said that even just looking at a Ghost Ship could easily infect someone with terrifying karma. If they actually got close to it, they would be doomed.

The formations on the docks quickly activated, forming layers of defenses. As for the Ghost Ship, the wind and waves pushed it onward even faster. It quickly reached those defenses.

“Kill him!”

Qi Hong ordered the person controlling the grand formations to unleash a killing blow on Long Chen.

Hence, the grand formations condensed and runes lit up. Astonishing divine might shook the world. But what shocked them was that while the runes gathered, they couldn’t merge.

“What… what is going on?!”

“It’s probably the influence of the Ghost Ship’s aura! The grand formations have lost their effect!”

“How can this be?!”

The Soaring Dragon Company’s people panicked. As the black qi filled the world, the protective light of the grand formations slowly melted like snow meeting a blazing sun.

BOOM!

Just then, the Ghost Ship that looked like it was about to fall apart from decay smashed into the docks. With a heaven-shaking explosion, a black ripple shot in every direction, corroding countless buildings rapidly.

The port’s ships, boats, and towers all collapsed. It was like they had suddenly gone through millions of years of usage, finally reaching the end of their lifespan and turning into black dust.

At this moment, the Ghost Ship exploded and the power of time erupted. Black ripples unfurled.

In just a breath’s time, the ripples spread a hundred thousand miles and continued to spread.

Other than people, all buildings and constructions decayed and fell apart. As for the people, it was like they were cursed. Their skin turned black.

Only supreme experts were capable of barely resisting that immense force and fleeing.

As for Qi Hong and the other World Kings, they had long since fled in terror. They weren’t touched by that black qi.

However, seeing the others with black qi covering their bodies, they were horrified. Those people had their longevity stripped away without even being aware of it.

In an instant, this glorious land was turned into a land of death. Death qi infected every single thing here, and the bustling port vanished, with all the buildings and ships turning to black dirt.

This Ghost Ship had been found by Long Chen, and he had forcibly changed its course. Not caring about karma, he sent it charging after the Soaring Dragon Company’s ship.

That tablet on him had almost caused him his death, but now it helped him out. It was connected to the ship’s formation, and through that faint sense, he was able to accurately chase after it.

As for the experts that were originally busily working on the docks, they were horrified. They watched as that giant stronghold that had been standing for countless years vanished just like that. They felt like they were in a nightmare.

“Little fellow, you dare to destroy my Soaring Dragon Company’s base?! Die!”

Seeing Long Chen walk out of the black mist, a World King in charge of guarding the port roared and attacked with his palm.

He had been in seclusion and had no idea what had happened. But seeing that all the buildings were destroyed, his fury soared. Sensing that Long Chen was only a Divine Lord, he directly reached out to grab him.

“Careful!” Qi Hong was appalled and hastily shouted at him. But it was too late.

The next moment, a blood-colored light flashed and that World King was cleaved in two by a saber. Even before his body split apart, another streak of saber-light swept out, cutting him apart once more.

The four pieces of his body fell from the sky. A World King was killed just like that, as effortlessly as cutting a melon.

That World King was actually quite powerful. Although he was also at the first Heavenstage, he was younger, meaning that his Blood Qi was active enough that he had a chance to reach the second Heavenstage. That was why he was in seclusion.

But perhaps his anger was clouding his judgment. He had rashly attacked without even summoning his manifestation.

Even after killing a World King, Long Chen’s anger didn’t diminish. He walked through the air, his lightning wings flickering and his divine ring raging. Now, his stars poured energy throughout his body. His target was Qi Hong.

Long Chen’s head was full of Bai Fang and Bai Rui. Those two kindhearted people had died right in front of him, and his hatred overflowed.

“Qi Hong, you bastard, I will tear your body into a million pieces!” Long Chen’s voice was like thunder shaking people’s ears.

Seeing that Long Chen was clearly in the Divine Lord realm but possessed the power to slay World Kings, everyone was shocked. He was like a devil god that had suddenly descended upon them.

“Attack together!” CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

Qi Hong was already locked onto by Long Chen. Fearing for his life, he took out a ruler covered in strange marks. The other World Kings also took out their weapons.

The ship originally had three World Kings, and the port had five. As Long Chen had killed one, there were only seven of them in total. At this moment, seven World Kings attacked at once and their auras erupted together. As a result, the world shook.

“Split the Heavens 2!”

Even against seven World Kings, Long Chen didn’t retreat. The Minghong Saber cried out, becoming one with Long Chen.

BOOM!

After that, the earth was torn apart. Terrifying ripples appeared throughout the world, but the space didn’t shatter.

Clearly, the Violet Flame Heaven’s Heavenly Daos were more complete, and its space was more stable. It wasn’t so easy to break apart. Even after concentrating all of his power, Long Chen didn’t manage to make the void shatter.

Long Chen and the seven World Kings coughed up blood together. It was only with their combined force that they managed to block Long Chen’s attack, and they were all injured.

Long Chen flew back, his feet stamping on the ground like nails to stabilize himself. After that, lightning flickered, and he shot toward one of the World Kings, arriving before them in the blink of an eye.

“Save me!” That World King cried out. That last exchange had caused his qi and blood to flip inside of him, and it had yet to settle. Incapable of concentrating his power, there was no way he could block Long Chen.

The closest World King to that elder hastily rushed over and stabbed his sword at Long Chen’s ribs, trying to force Long Chen away.

However, he hadn’t expected Long Chen to completely ignore his attack. Long Chen’s saber blasted his target into blood mist.

As for that sword attack, it pierced the dragon scale armor, but the attacker wasn’t the slightest bit happy about it. Instead, an expression of terror came over him.

His sword might have pierced Long Chen’s body, but it was like it had planted roots inside of him, and he could no longer pull it out. He had tried to use his power to make Long Chen explode, but he found that his power was like a clay ox falling into an ocean within Long Chen’s body.

“Get back!” Qi Hong shouted. He and the other World Kings rushed over.

Regretfully, that person was caught in his hesitation over whether or not to throw away his sword or cause his power to explode within Long Chen to give everyone a chance to kill him. As a result, Long Chen’s saber swung through a strange angle in the air, cutting off his head.
