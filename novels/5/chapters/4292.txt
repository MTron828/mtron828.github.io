Chapter 4281: Eight Great Divine Commanders

Three figures appeared at the same time, unleashing terrifying pressures that made it so that Mo Nian and the others couldn’t move.

The three of them had auras of half-step Eternal experts. However, their auras were ten times stronger than that of ordinary half-step Eternals.

Their presence instantly made people feel despair, as if three colossal mountains were blocking their path.

“You really are amazing. Unsurpassed talent, limitless potential, yet also infinitely cunning. The entire battlefield is under your control. Long Chen, I really admire you!”

One of the three was skinny and tall, wearing a black robe and carrying a strange spear on his back.

Perhaps it shouldn’t even be called a spear because it was just too thick. It was more like a pillar and was as thick as a normal person’s thigh.

With how skinny he was, the thick spear looked extremely off in contrast. This person’s eyes were as sharp as a falcon’s, seemingly capable of seeing through everything.

When he looked at Long Chen, it felt like he could see through all of Long Chen’s secrets. Strikingly, there were actually two pupils within each of his deep eyes.

“It’s too bad. Whether you are wildly arrogant or overwhelmingly domineering, you shouldn’t have gone against Lord Brahma. All those who went against Lord Brahma ended up with the same fate: dead,” said the large man beside the black-robed man.

This man was extremely well-built and wore sleeveless beast hides. His exposed skin had a copper-like hue and was covered with such dense runes that they resembled scales.

His Blood Qi was overwhelming, and his voice was like thunder. Although he was only speaking with a normal voice, it still rumbled in people’s ears, giving them a splitting headache.

“If my guess is correct, you should be two of Lord Brahma’s eight great divine commanders!” said Long Chen coldly.

“Hahaha, not bad. I didn’t praise you for nothing. You really are smart. Talking to smart people really does save energy.” The black-robed man laughed. He suddenly turned to the third person. “Brother Yan, what do you say? Do you want to personally avenge your little brother?”

That man stepped forward. He was wreathed in black flames and looked at Long Chen coldly.

“Hand over the golden lotus seed.” Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

“Ah, I understand, you are also a son of Yan Xu. You’re Yan Hong’s big brother.” Long Chen’s killing intent was instantly triggered.

His enmity with Yan Hong stemmed from the latter’s intention to devour Yu Qingxuan. Furthermore, the Yan Xu Flame was innately a sinister, evil flame. It wanted to devour all other flames.

It possessed terrifying devouring abilities, but the golden lotus seed in Long Chen’s primal chaos space seemed to be able to counter it. So this fellow had come for it.

However, even if Long Chen did hand over the golden lotus seed, this fellow would definitely still kill him and Yu Qingxuan to take their flames.

“I, Yan Chang, do not like smart people, nor do I like wasting words. Hand over the golden lotus seed, or I will start killing the people beside you one by one.”

This person was Yan Xu’s third son, Yan Chang. He stared at Long Chen coldly, and black flames rose behind him. It was like the flames of hell.

“Then why don’t you just try it!?”

Long Chen roared furiously, his killing intent erupted in front of this threat. As his killing intent raged, golden divine radiance gradually appeared around him.

This golden divine radiance was different from the light of the Dragon King Battle Armor. It was very gentle, like a holy light, not overbearing at all.

When this golden light appeared, Yan Chang’s pupils shrank slightly. A cruel and savage smile then appeared on his face.

“Good, very good, excellent! This trip wasn’t for nothing! It is still on you. You two, I want the golden lotus seed in his body. As for the rest, it’s up to you two.”

“Then this will be simple.” The black-robed man smiled. He suddenly extended a hand straight toward Long Chen.

The instant he extended his hand, everyone, including Long Chen, coughed up a mouthful of blood. A strange energy then poured into their bodies through every opening; there was no resisting it.

“Brahma’s power?!”

Long Chen was incensed. This was Lord Brahma’s faith energy, a force beyond the confines of laws, something that couldn’t be defended against or resisted.

Yan Chang was after Long Chen’s golden lotus seed, but its divine radiance was something he didn’t dare to go against. Hence, he used this black-robed man to kill Long Chen instead.

“Die!”

Long Chen clenched his teeth and disregarded his overdrafted Spiritual Strength. His bronze cauldron then came flying out, smashing at the black-robed man.

When it appeared, the ten thousand Daos crumbled, and the faith energy above the ten thousand Daos was instantly shattered.

The black-robed man was shocked to see Long Chen smashing this bronze cauldron at him. The next moment, his arm exploded along with half of his body.

“What?!”

The black-robed man cried out in terror and retreated, blood spraying out of his mouth. The remaining half of his body was covered in cracks, on the verge of collapse.

This sudden turn of events made everyone on the battlefield jump in shock. They stared in terror at the bronze cauldron in Long Chen’s hands.

“Could it be…?!”

“Is that the real Heaven Earth Cauldron?!”

People’s jaws dropped, and their eyes almost popped out of their sockets. If that wasn’t the Heaven Earth Cauldron, how could it possess such terrifying power?

“Die!”

Long Chen once more smashed the bronze cauldron at that black-robed man. At this point, Long Chen had set his heart on smashing him to death.

The black-robed man was shocked and filled with fury. The thick spear on his back then lit up, exuding an explosive and radiant divine glow alongside a burst of immense faith energy.

This was an Eternal divine weapon and also a sacred faith symbol. Its aura was thousands of times greater than other Eternal divine items.

Other Eternal divine items also had the Eternal aura, but they didn’t have the Eternal power if the user had not reached the Eternal realm. Without that Eternal power, they couldn’t unleash an Eternal divine weapon’s power.

However, there was one method to draw out this power, and that was by using faith energy. It was practically cheating.

BOOM!

In front of countless terrified gazes, the bronze cauldron smashed into that Eternal spear. The cauldron then rumbled, and milky white divine radiance erupted into the air, obliterating the spear.

However, when the power that exploded out of it filled this world, Mo Nian and the others instantly smelled the scent of death coming for them.

Suddenly, the sound of a zither rang out and a strange ripple spread. The next moment, both Long Chen and the bronze cauldron vanished.

The black-robed man was caught in the center of those ripples and was directly blown out of existence. As for Yan Chang and the other divine commander, they were powerless to intervene and fled out of the core region as fast as they could.

“We’re doomed!”

Mo Nian and the others could only watch as that explosive power crashed toward them. Since it had instantly killed that black-robed man, then there was no chance they would survive.

Suddenly, the void quivered and multiple barriers appeared in front of the Dragonblood Legion. Following that, a beautiful figure appeared in front of everyone.

“Master!”

When Tang Wan-er saw that figure, she cried out in delight.
