Chapter 3683

Qing Yu’s attack had been like a fierce tiger. The aura was astonishing. However, Guo Ran caught it with just two fingers, and that fierce tiger became a trembling kitten.

Qing Yu’s expression completely changed. After that, he pulled with all his power, but no matter what he did, it was like his sword was fused with Guo Ran’s hand. His pulling was like a dragonfly trying to shake a tree. It didn’t budge.

At this moment, everyone’s expression changed. Before this, Guo Ran had simply stayed behind Long Chen like a sloppy little attendant, so no one had viewed him to be anyone important. Therefore, no one had expected him to shock everyone as soon as he made a move.

“You want to attack my boss? Do you think that you’re qualified? Go back and cultivate for another thirty thousand years first!” Guo Ran sneered and suddenly flicked the tip of the sword with his thumb.

Sparks flew. After that, an inch of the tip of Qing Yu’s sword snapped off.

This sword was a top grade King item. But in front of Guo Ran, it simply wasn’t worth anything.

The sword began to quiver intensely. As a result, Qing Yu was no longer able to hold onto it, and the webbing between his forefinger and thumb broke apart. He flew back. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

With a flick of Guo Ran’s finger, that broken sword tip shot after Qing Yu like a bolt of lightning.

After that, with a cold flash, the sword tip pierced through Qing Yu’s head. Seeing this, the Tea Divine School’s disciples cried out in terror.

“Senior apprentice-brother Qing Yu!”

They thought that Qing Yu was dead, killed by this attack from Guo Ran. After all, if someone’s head was pierced, they would naturally die.

However, they quickly realized that Qing Yu wasn’t dead. He was standing there motionlessly, seeming to be a fool who didn’t dare to move.

“Senior apprentice-brother Qing Yu, are you alright?” The woman who had previously spoken came forward and pulled at him with concern.

Qing Yu’s body quivered after being pulled, and that shaking caused strands of hair to fly into the air. An inch-wide area along the center of Qing Yu’s head became barren land as the hair there fell.

Qing Yu had been wearing a golden crown. But the golden crown had already fallen, and his hair fell in disarray. The center was now bald. However, it was so perfectly centered that the left and right sides were perfectly symmetrical.

This spectacle was shocking and funny to people. But when they looked at Guo Ran, their gazes contained profound fear.

Let alone them, even Long Chen and Xia Chen jumped in shock. When did this fellow’s control over his Supreme Bone reach such a high level?

However, when they looked at Guo Ran’s expression, they knew that this was just a random coincidence. He wasn’t able to flick anything so accurately.

In fact, even Guo Ran himself was shocked. He had actually planned on slashing off a piece of Qing Yu’s scalp as a warning and punishment for his disrespect toward the Wine God Palace.

However, Guo Ran hadn’t expected to end up slightly off. His flick ended up deviating up, resulting in this surprising result.

Guo Ran quickly clasped his hands behind his back and indifferently said, “For our first meeting, I don’t have any gift for you, so I can only give you a reverse mohawk. Don’t worry, it’s perfectly centered. Go ahead and count every hair on both sides. If they’re not equal, even by one strand, it will count as my defeat!”

Long Chen and Xia Chen were speechless. This fellow’s face really was thick. He would brag about anything.

However, that attack was truly shocking. The Tea Divine School’s disciples were all horrified, so how could they be in the mood to count? Guo Ran dared to brag, but no one dared to find the evidence against him, which let him pull off a perfect performance.

“Little fellow, your luck is good. My boss’s mood is good today. In the future, if you still don't know how high the heavens are and how deep the earth is, then make sure to go out in at least groups of two,” advised Xia Chen sternly.

“Will we be luckier if we are in groups of two?” One of the disciples of the Tea Divine School couldn’t help asking.

Xia Chen shook his head. “No. I simply meant that you’ll have company on the path to the Yellow Springs!”

People laughed, not having expected Xia Chen to make such a joke.

Suddenly, Xia Chen formed a hand seal, and Qing Yu’s broken sword seemed to come to life, flying through the air.

Just like that, the sword accurately stabbed into the sheath on Qing Yu’s waist. Upon seeing this scene, people’s smiles stiffened.

The Tea Divine School’s disciples were particularly terrified. That was because, at that moment, they felt a sharp light pass by their necks.

It was only once they saw Qing Yu’s hair slowly falling and heard the sound of the sword entering the sheath that they understood what had just happened.

Guo Ran had previously done a reverse mohawk that amazed everyone. But Xia Chen’s move gave them chills.

Through space, Xia Chen had controlled someone else’s weapon. Furthermore, he had brought it right past all their necks before it entered Qing Yu’s sheath. If he had wished to, those disciples of the Tea Divine School would already be headless corpses.

“I… I… I came to discuss the Dao, not to fight!” Qing Yu clenched his teeth and did his best to shout bravely.

“Were we fighting just now? Furthermore, if we were, would you even be qualified to participate in a martial competition with us?” Long Chen smiled.

“You were the one who attacked first just now!” raged Qing Yu.

“Curious. Does attacking mean fighting? We were discussing the Dao, weren’t we? You said something about floating and sinking, picking things up and putting things down. I was just testing whether you really had reached that realm. If you are capable of picking things up and putting things down, you shouldn’t be so angry. Put down your anger. You came to challenge the Wine God Palace, so shouldn’t you be prepared to be humiliated? What? You were planning on just insulting the seniors of the Wine God Palace? You didn’t expect anyone to retaliate? If you can’t accept others treating you the same way that you treat them, how can you say that you’ve reached the realm of being able to pick things up and put them down?” retorted Long Chen.

“You…!”

Qing Yu was left speechless. He began to sweat as he no longer had any idea what to do.

Long Chen indifferently said, “The Tea Saint Lu Yu’s Tea Scripture has three parts. The part that you’ve comprehended is nothing more than the lower part, and is merely the most superficial part of it. Lu Yu’s three-part Tea Scripture corresponds to three realms, the world of desire, the colored world, and the colorless world. Within the scripture, there is a line: from above, achieve the Dao, ascend to the heavenly palace; from the center, achieve the Dao, become an immortal in the southern palace; from below, achieve the Dao, live forever within the world. The scripture that you’ve obtained is only the third portion, the lower part, corresponding to the world of desires. Seek your desires, know your desires, understand your desires, and break your desires. If you can comprehend this lower part of the scripture, you can live forever in the world, possessing eternal life. For you to come and challenge the Wine God Palace, you are clearly trying to increase the fame of your Tea Divine School at the expense of the Wine God Palace’s reputation. Based on the partitions of the Tea Scripture, you are in the lowest level of the third part. To put it frankly, you haven’t even entered the gates of the Tea Scripture before setting up your so-called Tea Divine School. Bragging, showing off, conning people, your ignorance and foolishness are almost painful.”

These words didn’t just shock the outsiders, but they also moved the people inside the Wine God Palace. The Tea Saint Tu Lu was known to them all. But as for his scripture, not many people were aware of it.

“Absolute nonsense! You don’t know what you’re talking about!”

Just then, an elder in white robes walked out from the distance with an enraged expression.

Upon seeing him, Qing Yu and the others cried out, “Patriarch!”
