Chapter 2390 Young Master Ye Qian

Translator: BornToBe

The voice was a bit familiar. Long Chen looked over to see a pretty young lady looking at him with wet eyes.

“Wan Qing, you’re here?” Long Chen was surprised to see her here.

When they stood facing each other, Long Chen wanted to rub her head. But the current Wan Qing was no longer a little girl, so such an action was a bit inappropriate.

“Pill Valley is exchanging some pointers with the divine families. I’m here to purchase some precious ingredients. I just had a discussion with the grandmaster alchemists of the divine families, and then I came here…” Wan Qing looked at Long Chen emotionally. There was happiness but also bitterness within her eyes.

“She didn’t come?” asked Long Chen.

Wan Qing shook her head. “She has been in seclusion the entire time. It was supposed to be her coming here for the alchemy discussion, but she refused. The valley master was helpless to order her, so he sent me. With how skilled the alchemists of the divine families are, I feel like I’ve lost face for Pill Valley.”

More tears appeared in her eyes. This time, she had suffered quite a bit during the alchemy discussion. Although she had reached an extremely high realm in alchemy, compared to the Pill Fairy, she lacked maturity. After all, she wasn’t the daughter of the valley master. Their starting points were completely different. Although the Pill Fairy had taken her in later, her foundation was naturally weaker.

“The divine families wanted to compare who is more skilled?” asked Long Chen with surprise.

“Not exactly a comparison but simply an exchange of insights. They truly are powerful. The most frightening thing is that the one to exchange pointers with me was a young disciple who had his own special insights on alchemy. It could even be said that he is capable of blazing new paths that others have never imagined. In the end, after a simple competition, I ranked second behind him. But I saw that the other three were secretly holding back to let me win. I’m still lacking compared to them,” said Wan Qing sadly.

“Foolish girl, how could you be lacking compared to them?” Long Chen shook his head.

“I…”

Long Chen waved his hand. “Just think about how old you are compared to them. When did you start training compared to them? Where were they born and where were you born? If the positions were switched, they would definitely be inferior to you.” Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

“Hehe, big brother Long Chen really knows how to talk.” Wan Qing smiled slightly. “Are you here to buy medicinal ingredients? We can go together.”

“Alright.”

“Then can you hold my hand just like back then?” asked Wan Qing bashfully.

“Of course. No matter how much time passes, our relationship won’t change.” Long Chen smiled and held Wan Qing’s little hand.

Wan Qing felt the same warmth that she had held back then. He was the same Long Chen. However, some people had changed.

Thinking of that, Wan Qing’s eyes reddened. Long Chen stopped and softly stroked her head. “There are many things in this world that we can’t control. No matter how high our cultivation base, no matter how skilled we are, it doesn’t matter. But no matter how the rest of the world changes, we can make sure to keep our hearts the same. Everything else can pass by. Life is short and bitter, so make sure to favor the joy or you won’t have anything to get you through the hard times. Even if you lose that happiness in the future, the memories can still be cherished.”

Wan Qing nodded, slightly comforted. She was about to speak when a group of people walked over.

There were over ten of them, all of them wearing violet robes with a pill furnace embroidered on the front of their robes. There was a medicinal pill above the pill furnace made of golden thread, looking like it was radiating light. They had the mark of the divine families on their sleeves. It seemed that they were people from the divine families’ alchemy division.

“Who are you?” The leader of this group was a young man. Seeing how intimately Long Chen was acting with Wan Qing by rubbing her head, his expression was cold.

Wan Qing hastily started to introduce them. “Young master Ye Qian, this is-”

“What does who I am have to do with you?” demanded Long Chen. Seeing the fury in this person’s eyes, how could he not understand what was going on? He couldn’t be bothered with such a person.

Although this person could count as handsome, the arrogance in his eyes was irritating. It was like there was not a single person worthy of entering his sight within this world.

“You dare to be rude to the leader of the Divine Pill Division? Are you looking to get kicked out of the divine families?” shouted a person beside the leader.

“With how arrogant you are, I suspect you must be the leader of the divine families. If you act any bigger, this whole hall might not be able to contain you,” sneered Long Chen.

Wan Qing covered up a smile. Long Chen really was the same as back in the day. She had no good feelings toward these geniuses of the Divine Pill Division either. Although they were powerful, they were extremely arrogant. Although they meticulously maintained a certain politeness with their words, their arrogance leaked out heavily.

With the way they talked, it was like they felt that everywhere other than the divine families was trash. In fact, some of them had been extremely rude when discussing Pill Valley’s alchemy arts with her. Wan Qing was reserved and hadn’t said anything, but that didn’t mean that she wasn’t angry with them. Seeing Long Chen going against them, she smiled inside. Her big brother Long Chen was always the bane of bad people.

“Who are you?” demanded Ye Qian, killing intent appearing in his eyes.

Ye Qian was the most famous junior alchemist of the divine families. He was highly viewed by the higher-ups, and his status made it so that he was about on the same level as Feng Fei in terms of reputation.

Within the divine families, he was the only one who wasn’t part of the main bloodlines but had to be called senior. That was evidence of his special status.

Ye Qian was known as a once-in-a-millenia alchemy genius. With the divine families’ support, his alchemy arts were unparalleled. Of course, that description was given to him by himself.

In his eyes, the only one who could compare to him was the Pill Fairy. The gathering that Wan Qing had just attended had been held in order to have the Pill Fairy come. But she hadn’t.

The fact that the Pill Fairy hadn’t come had been extremely irritating to them. But Wan Qing with her particular graceful and subdued air had moved their hearts.

Ye Qian in particular had never encountered a beautiful woman with a temperament like her. He instantly felt an urge to pursue her. During the discussion, he had made the others allow her to win second place just to give her a good impression.

However, this woman he was pursuing was now being so intimate with another man. The most unacceptable thing was that this man was actually viewing him as trash.

Within the entirety of the divine families, there were few people who dared to speak to him like this. Even Feng Fei would be polite to him when requesting pills.

The anger in Ye Qian’s voice drew quite a bit of attention. People were drawn over.

“Heavens, isn’t that Ye Qian of the Divine Pill Division? Why is he here?”

“He wouldn’t be bullying someone again, right?”

“Shut up! You don’t want to end up provoking the Divine Pill Division.”

In just a moment, everyone on this level was drawn over. Even though people were whispering, they had to be careful with what they said, afraid of offending Ye Qian and the others.

“Eh, who is that black-robed person? He’s strutting around like he doesn’t recognize Ye Qian. What an unlucky fellow.”

“No, he seems a bit familiar. I feel like I’ve seen him before. Why can’t I remember?”

“It’s that person from the Martial Heaven Continent, Long Chen.”

The people in the divine families knew of what was happening on the Martial Heaven Continent. The outstanding members of the continent were all known. Some disciples even went to see what was happening on the continent, but most of them didn’t pay much attention. In their eyes, the people of the Martial Heaven Continent were frogs at the bottom of a well.

It took a while for someone to recognize Long Chen. Even Long Chen didn’t know that he had ended up being ranked number one on the divine families’ list for people to watch out for on the continent.

“Ah, I remember him now. No wonder he’s so arrogant. So he’s a heavenly genius of the Martial Heaven Continent.”

“Tch, so what? Having come to the divine families, even a tiger has to kneel. This is the territory of dragons. He wants to act arrogant here? His life has probably come to an end.”

Just as people were discussing this, Shen Chengfeng was drawn over by the disturbance. He instantly turned white when he saw what was happening, and his soul almost leaped out of his body. He rushed over, shouting, “Long Chen, you can’t kill people here!”
