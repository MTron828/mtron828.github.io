Chapter 3401 Giving Face But Not Receiving Face

Others couldn’t hear what Lei Yuner said, but they did hear Long Chen clearly, and that drove them mad.

Lei Yuner was actually willing to form a contractual agreement with Long Chen. Could it be that the current swans all liked toads so much? Had their taste grown so heavy?

Although they hadn’t heard what Lei Yuner said, from Long Chen’s tone, she was definitely threatening him.

Compared to their threats, a threat from Lei Yuner was definitely on a completely different level. But Long Chen still dared to refuse her.

Lei Yuner’s expression sank. She seemed angry and lightning runes appeared on her silver hair as well. After that, a violent aura rose.

Long Chen didn’t say anything and just looked at her. He also wanted to know if she would dare to fight in this place. Was Ying Bokong’s warning true? Would no one dare to challenge the Sacred Pill Hall’s might?

“Princess, please calm your anger. Give face to my Sacred Pill Hall. Don’t make things hard on us.” An elderly voice rang out at this moment, covering the entire city. Although the voice was polite, it also contained unquestionable dignity.

Clearly, everything here was under the Sacred Pill Hall’s watch. They gave her a warning.

Although the Lightning Falcon race was powerful, this was the territory of the Sacred Pill Hall. They had to follow their rules, or the Sacred Pill Hall would lose face.

However, the Sacred Pill Hall was also quite polite with this warning. If they weren’t somewhat afraid of them as well, they wouldn’t be using such polite words.

“What are you smiling at?!” Lei Yuner shouted at Long Chen angrily when she saw a smile appear on his face. She thought that he was mocking her.

“It’s nothing. I just feel like you’re very beautiful when you’re angry,” said Long Chen. Actually, he wasn’t smiling but simply curling his lips. That was because that elderly voice was quite displeasing.

It was a World King, and his voice contained the aura of the God Dao. That aura clearly came from Lord Brahma, meaning that this was one of his subordinates. Unfortunately, Long Chen’s displeased expression had actually been taken as an odd smile by Lei Yuner. She clearly had yet to fully grasp the human race’s facial expressions.

“The princess of the noble Lightning Falcon race actually asked a lowly human to form an equal spirit contract. The face of the demonic beast race has been lost by you.”

Suddenly, another voice rang out. It was not loud, but heavy, like rushing thunder. Everyone then looked in that direction and saw two giant figures walking over.

Ying Bokong’s expression changed. One of them was the driver of the Elephant Emperor War Chariot. He was very large with a powerful Blood Qi that was as vast as a sea. Ying Bokong instantly recognized him.

Furthermore, at this time, he was obediently walking behind an even larger man in golden armor.

If the driver’s aura was like a vast sea, then the man in the golden armor was an entire cosmos. His Blood Qi was as heavy as a starry sky, making it difficult for the people around to breathe.

With his arrival, it was truly like a fierce tiger descending amongst a flock of sheep. The pressure made it so that others didn’t dare to move.

“The Mammoth Divine Elephant race’s eighth prince, the master of the Elephant Emperor War Chariot and the future leader of the Mammoth Divine Elephant race. He actually came as well.”

“The Mammoth Emperor has eight sons. Seven are famous existences, but the eighth prince is very mysterious. Not even his name has been revealed, but he was bestowed the Elephant Emperor War Chariot. His power is probably unimaginable.”

“I heard that the Mammoth Divine Elephant race has been in talks with the Lightning Falcon race lately. Could it be…”

Eyeing this eighth prince as well as the princess of the Lightning Falcon race, and then glancing at Long Chen, people seemed to realize something.

“Inferior human race? Hey, this big dumb elephant is cursing you.” Lei Yuner suddenly laughed, and in front of everyone’s dumbfounded gazes, she actually hugged Long Chen’s arm and hid behind him.

Long Chen was startled and quickly understood. This Lei Yuner was using him as a shield. He had also heard the discussion going on in the background. This eighth prince of the Mammoth Divine Elephant race very likely had some conflict with Lei Yuner.

Long Chen really did want to toss Lei Yuner out. He didn’t want to be used by others. But that would be as if he was afraid of this eighth prince.

He had rejected Lei Yuner. If he flung her out, then it would really be as if he was a coward.

Furthermore, he also saw the eighth prince’s expression change when Lei Yuner wrapped around his arm. The latter’s gaze became as sharp as a blade, and killing intent soared out of him. This action of Lei Yuner’s had clearly enraged him.

Long Chen indifferently said, “I have no enmity with any of you. I only came here to calmly advance to Divine Lord. Whatever personal grievances you have, you can settle amongst yourselves. Don’t involve me.”

Long Chen didn’t push Lei Yuner away from him, but he did express his position clearly. He didn’t want to interfere in their matters, so don’t provoke him.

“Inferior human, you have no right to speak here. If you want your life, then scram,” said the eighth prince darkly.

Now Long Chen was angry. It really was a case of giving face but not receiving face. Did he not know what kind of a man Boss Long San was?

Hence, Long Chen no longer cared about being used by Lei Yuner. He naturally extended his hand around Lei Yuner’s shoulders and glanced at the eighth prince. “It seems that you don’t understand Boss Long San’s words. Since you refuse to give me face, I’ll accompany you. Little sister, let’s go. Brother San will treat you to some food.”

Just like that, Long Chen left with his arm around Lei Yuner’s tender figure. Originally, he wanted to hold her waist, but she wasn’t tall enough for that. If he wanted to hold her waist, he’d have to bend down, and his act would appear incredibly awkward. So he only wrapped his arm around her shoulders.

Lei Yuner didn’t reject this intimate act. In fact, she strutted with him, glancing back at the eighth prince with a mocking smile. She then left with Long Chen just like that.Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

“Courting death!”

The Mammoth Divine Elephant race’s eighth prince was enraged. That large man behind him was about to stop the two of them, but he was stopped by the eighth prince. If they were to forcibly stop Long Chen, it would be the same as attacking them. Even their Mammoth Divine Elephant race had to give face to the Sacred Pill Hall.

“Good, I’ll make you regret your actions. With that little bit of power, you are trash in front of me,” said the eighth prince darkly.

“Have you been eating your own crap lately? Why does your breath smell so bad? If you want to fight, we’ll meet again in the Divine Lord Immortal Realm,” said Long Chen.

Just like that, Long Chen arrogantly left with the Lightning Falcon race’s princess. Ying Bokong was shivering as he followed behind them.

“Tell our people to seal all the exits! I will not permit him to leave!” ordered the eighth prince.

“Yes!” That large human immediately replied in the affirmative and vanished amongst the crowd.
