Chapter 3262 Wily Old Fox

Long Chen was very direct, so he directly tossed out such a question. He had come to resolve a problem, not to play games. The courteous words ended here.

“This is an internal matter of the Yuhua Palace! We will naturally handle our matters justly. We don’t need an outsider like you to interfere!” snorted the palace master.

“How laughable. If you really were capable of handling this impartially, would I, Long Chen, be forced to cross the devil sea just to waste words on you? The Yuhua Palace can count as a famous, righteous sect. That is the only reason I came to talk reason with you, hoping that I could resolve this peacefully. I don’t know if it’s because you think I’m young, but you took me for a fool. Let me say something rude here, I’ve killed more lifeforms than you’ve ever seen in your lifetime. Lord Brahma, Enpuda, none of them were able to topple me. Do you think that you can scare me? You’re too naive,” sneered Long Chen, not giving this palace master any face.

Long Chen was holding back a belly full of fire due to Qi Yu’s matter. He didn’t want to be too rigid with the way he handled this thing, but the palace master was truly forcing Long Chen with his unreasonable actions. He actually wanted to kill them for their treasures? If that patriarch had not appeared, Long Chen would have turned this place into a sea of blood.

“What big words! You dare to come to my Yuhua Palace with such impudence? If you’re so confident, then do you dare to fight me?” said Jiang Baihe sinisterly.

He was claimed to be a genius that came only once every ten thousand years, so he was extremely arrogant. Seeing someone who was even more arrogant than him, he was enraged.

“Shut up! You don’t know how to properly behave!” shouted the patriarch. He thumped his cane on the ground, causing the entire palace to shudder. As a result, the palace master and Jiang Baihe instantly shut their mouths.

Only then did the patriarch turn to Long Chen and amicably say, “Great dean, this old man has not properly raised my children, letting you see such jokes. I’ve been in seclusion all this time, so I’m not clear on this matter. But I can see that Qi Yu is an upright and good child. His eyes are clear. There are definitely some fishy things when it comes to this matter. I will personally investigate it and find the cause of it to clear this child of all crimes.”

The patriarch then turned to Qi Yu and smiled kindly. “Child, your talent isn’t bad. But your strongest point is your determination. Your willpower is the strongest of all the disciples. Don’t worry, I will get justice for you. Furthermore, starting today, no one will dare to make things difficult for you in the Yuhua Palace.”

Upon hearing this, Jiang Baihe’s expression grew extremely ugly. A vein throbbed on his forehead, and killing intent flowed within his eyes. The patriarch was actually willing to stand up for Qi Yu just because of these youngsters.

He was enraged, unable to understand what this patriarch was thinking. Had he grown muddled with age? How was he such a coward that was biased toward these outsiders? Why was he protecting Qi Yu so much, while abandoning him, a peerless heavenly genius?Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

As for Long Chen, he somehow had a bad feeling. This old man was trying to smooth things over.

Seeing the patriarch treat him like this, Qi Yu was overjoyed. He hastily bowed. “Thank you for your kindness. I will listen to the patriarch’s instructions.”

The patriarch laughed. “Good child, what magnanimity. You are a real man. Yu Xuan, your vision isn’t bad.”

Yu Xuan was also beaming after hearing the patriarch praise Qi Yu. Furthermore, the patriarch was going to stand up for him. In the future, he didn’t need to fear Jiang Baihe.

With just a few words, this crafty old man had completely placated Qi Yu. Long Chen felt like his punch had landed on cotton.

Qi Yu had said that he would listen to the patriarch’s instructions. If Long Chen started making demands now, it would appear all too overbearing.

Having already said this, there was no way Long Chen could force it. Ah, it seemed that Qi Yu was still too inexperienced.

Long Chen said, “Senior’s noble character and integrity are truly admirable. Then this is precisely the result that everyone wants. However, on the way here, I asked Qi Yu what kind of result he wants, and he told me he doesn’t want anything else other than to fight the people who participated in the attack against him. Due to their use of poison at the time, he could only watch as those new disciples were slaughtered in front of him, unable to protect them. The guilt from that incident made him swear to kill all those murderers. Most despicable of all, those people actually placed the blame on Qi Yu. Such maliciousness truly makes the heart cold. As his boss, I naturally must help him achieve his heart’s desire. There are some things that can simply come to a tacit understanding, but some things cannot be left ambiguous. I won’t bother doing a soulsearch on that Lu Ziya, but all those people who attacked my brother that day must give an explanation. I won’t bully you. Last time, they used despicable poison, but this time, we can have a fair battle. Qi Yu can still be one person. They had sixteen people, but Lu Ziya is crippled, so have the fifteen of them come out. One against fifteen, a life-and-death match until one side is exterminated. After this battle, no matter who wins or loses, this matter can end.”

Hearing Long Chen’s words, Yu Xuan was shocked. Long Chen wanted Qi Yu to fight fifteen Primals at once. It had to be known that just now, Qi Yu had sent her spiritual messages to explain what had happened.

Yu Xuan was now aware that Qi Yu’s attackers were all Jiang Baihe’s capable subordinates. None of them was weaker than Qi Yu.

The only reason he had managed to survive was because they all felt that he was definitely dead, so they didn’t want to get dragged down with him. Thus, they held back, giving Qi Yu a chance to escape.

Now Long Chen wanted him to fight against fifteen of them at once? Was that not sending Qi Yu to his death? She couldn’t believe her ears.

Qi Yu was patting her back comfortingly. In the past few days, he had exchanged pointers with Qin Feng. He had also gone up the Honing Heavenly Staircase and had completely transformed. He was confident.

Upon hearing this, the expressions of the Yuhua Palace’s experts changed. They turned toward Jiang Baihe with some disbelief.

Jiang Baihe liked Yu Xuan and hated Qi Yu. This was something that everyone in the Yuhua Palace was aware of. But for him to use such despicable means against Qi Yu was truly contemptible.

The Yuhua Palace was a righteous power, so for such a thing to occur was an immense humiliation. If such a thing was spread, how would the Yuhua Palace’s disciples have the face to see others?

They also thought of how the palace master had protected Jiang Baihe. So, he actually wanted to kill the victim? They didn’t know about any of this.

Long Chen had explained this matter clearly. Actually, he was blackmailing them. If they wanted to keep this matter secret, fine. But the precondition was to hand over the attackers. As long as they listened, he wouldn’t be too hard on them.

“All those who attacked Qi Yu that day, stand up!”

The patriarch had no choice but to helplessly open his mouth once more.
