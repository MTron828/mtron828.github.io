Chapter 4829 Star Cloud Martial Stage

“The thirty-seventh martial stage! That’s definitely going to be a battle of peak geniuses! Quick, quick!”

“Quick what?”

“Buy tickets! Otherwise, they’ll be sold out!”

As an uproar exploded within and outside of the city, countless experts flooded the city, rushing in a certain direction.

“Quick, put a drop of blood on your tablet. We’re also going to buy tickets!” exclaimed Mo Nian.

Long Chen then placed a drop of his blood onto the tablet, causing its runes to light up as if it had come to life. This tablet now represented Long Chen’s status. In the future, he could use it to freely come and go through Devil Fall City. He could also store his money and honor points in this tablet.

If Long Chen could kill a Heaven Saint devil creature alone, his honor points would instantly push him to the gold rank, granting him superior privileges.

Moreover, all transactions within the city required this tablet, and personal trades without it were strictly prohibited, as they offered no protection. In other words, if someone fell victim to a scam without using the tablet, it was considered their own fault. Hence, without the tablet, Long Chen couldn’t enter the city, and they also couldn’t buy tickets to watch.

Once the tablet recognized him as master, a large stone behind the administrator lit up slightly, signifying that Long Chen could go.

Just as Mo Nian was about to drag Long Chen off, Lu Ziqiong surprisingly said, “You don’t need to buy tickets. As a participant, I am allowed to bring ten people in.”

“There’s such a thing?” Mo Nian was delighted and then gave her a flattering smile. “Lady Lu, not only are you eloquent, but the way you handle things is also beautiful. You are truly a heroine amongst women, a phoenix amongst the people. We two brothers prostrate ourselves toward you in admiration. Being able to meet you is the blessing of three lifetimes.”

Long Chen shivered as he listened to Mo Nian. Wasn’t this kind of praise too exaggerated? He hastily said, “Miss Lu, we have four people here. It’s not convenient for us to come with you.”

Long Chen didn’t want to owe her this little favor. After all, Lu Ziqiong was probably only referring to the two of them. If they left these two sisters alone, it would be far too rude.

“No need! We don’t mind at all...” Yu Tong hastily waved her hand. She knew just how rare this chance was and didn’t want to hold Long Chen and Mo Nian back.

Mo Nian clapped his forehead, cursing himself for forgetting about this. However, just as he was about to apologize, Lu Ziqiong emotionlessly said, “It’s fine. All four of you can come.”

“What?”

Mo Nian was stunned as that meant they would be taking four of those precious spots. That didn’t seem too good, as after all, they weren’t acquainted.

“It’s fine. I have to thank you all for giving me this chance. I’ve long since wanted to fight him, but every time I challenged him, he refused. You guys got me what I wanted, so the four spots is me returning the favor,” answered Lu Ziqiong indifferently.

When she spoke, her voice was just as icy as her face, not showing the slightest emotional fluctuation, giving them a strange feeling.

Lu Ziqiong’s tablet suddenly flickered, and ten soybean-sized runes flew out of it. She handed four of them to Long Chen.

Long Chen took them, but before he could say anything, Lu Ziqiong was already turning and leaving. One of the guards behind her said, “If you place those runes on your tablets, you will be able to directly go to the starry cloud martial stage to watch the fight. Hehe, I really envy you.”

This was the guard who had helped them out before. Seeing those runes, he was envious, but Lu Ziqiong couldn’t possibly give the runes to the likes of him. Hence, the guards could only accept their fate.

“What is going on? Did her conscience finally awaken? She felt that she needed to make it up to us after using us, huh? Well... if she wants to give us good things, it will be rude to reject them,” laughed Long Chen. Mo Nian also didn’t stand on courtesy and directly grabbed one of those runes from Long Chen’s hand, placing it onto his tablet.

That tablet was like a drop of water landing on his tablet, quickly branding itself onto the tablet. However, other than that one additional rune, it didn’t seem that there was any change to his tablet.

Long Chen, Yu Tong, and Yu Fei also did the same thing, not noticing any other change. The four of them started to grow uneasy.

“Mo Nian, you lead the way,” said Long Chen.

“Yu Tong, why don’t you lead the way? Having a beautiful woman lead the way is such a wonderful thing,” responded Mo Nian.

“You don’t know your way around, do you?” asked Long Chen.

“I say, you really don’t know how to speak to your friends. If you already know, why do you have to say it?” scolded Mo Nian.

“But I don’t know the way either!” answered Yu Tong. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

The four of them looked at each other, dumbfounded. Neither Yu Tong nor Mo Nian knew where the star cloud martial stage was.

Long Chen looked at Mo Nian scornfully. This fellow had been going on and on about how famous he was in Devil Fall City, to the point where he made it sound like he was the city lord.

However, he didn’t even know where the star cloud martial stage was. Just like that, all his bragging was exposed.

Mo Nian seemed to know that Long Chen had seen through him. So, he quickly ran over to the gate and asked the administrator.

The administrator was extremely busy, but seeing Mo Nian, he still had the patience to give him some instructions.

Mo Nian recovered his previous arrogance once he was back. With a wave of his hand, he led the three of them into the city.

“The star cloud martial stage is in Yaohua Prefecture’s northern city—the Clear Wind Valley. We’ll need to take two transportation formations to get there.”

Mo Nian didn’t dare to tarry and directly rushed to the closest transportation formation, but when they arrived, they all gasped as there was already a giant line here.

“It looks like we won’t make it,” said Yu Tong.

“No, we’ll have to run. If we wait, how long will it take?” Long Chen felt a chill looking at that endless line.

“Running is no good. Devil Fall City isn’t just as big as what you see. Even if we fly at full power, we’ll need three days to get there. Furthermore, it is forbidden to fly in the city. Wait a moment. I’m going to take a look,” said Mo Nian.

Mo Nian rushed off to the front of the line and ran back in delight. The truth was that with their tablets, they could directly skip the line.

Hearing this, the three of them were delighted. They then learned that this line was mostly for people who hadn’t gotten the tickets, so they could only watch from outside.

Those who had bought tickets had special access. As for their four tablets, with that specific rune, they were given top priority, and there was no need for them to wait in line.

After they passed through two transportation formations, the surroundings got darker. Above them, a vast starry river arched like a celestial dome, encompassing a colossal martial stage.

“Damn, this martial stage really is badass,” Mo Nian exclaimed, his jaw dropping at the spectacle.

Long Chen, however, found himself captivated by the expansive starry river overhead, becoming entranced by its cosmic expanse.
