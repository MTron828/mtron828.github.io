Chapter 4488 Lifehunter Peak

“You think that you can kill me? Those words are too audacious for your feeble mouth!” sneered the Lifehunter expert. Suddenly, his previously destroyed arm regenerated. Moreover, as it regrew, he once again vanished from sight.

“What?!”

Startled cries rang out. They had thought that he had been so wounded by Long Chen that he had lost the ability to conceal himself. However, it turned out that he also possessed terrifying healing abilities.

When he vanished, Long Chen didn’t panic. This was entirely within his expectations, and he nonchalantly stabbed his lightning spear in front of him.

An immense power collapsed the void, generating a giant vortex that sucked the Lifehunter expert inside. He was visible now.

Long Chen’s lightning spear wasn’t directed at the Lifehunter expert. Instead, it aimed at the vortex’s center that drew everything around it.

Just as Long Chen’s spear was about to strike the Lifehunter expert again, he was also drawn toward the center.

“Lifehunter Peak Instant Kill!” the expert shouted, once again enveloped in those blood-colored marks. However, this time, his sword took on a violet hue.

At the sight of the violet light, Luo Ning, who had just awakened, seethed with anger. The violet light symbolized not just her violet blood power but the essence blood of numerous experts from the violet blood race that this strange sword had absorbed.

BOOM!

The lightning spear and the sword clashed once more, unleashing a brilliant explosion. Following that, a wave of destruction spread.

Long Chen’s lightning spear exploded, and the impact sent him flying back. As for the Lifehunter expert, blood sprayed out of his mouth, and his expression changed.

“Damn!” Guo Ran and Xia Chen cursed. If Long Chen had a powerful divine weapon, that attack would have been enough to kill this fellow.

While a weapon condensed from his thunderforce was powerful, it was still one step lower than a true divine weapon.

After that, Long Chen summoned his lightning spear once more and shot back.

Long Chen’s power seemed limitless. Meanwhile, the Lifehunter expert was still coughing up blood, so Long Chen instantly locked onto him.

At this moment, Long Chen knew that this terrifying assassin had just revealed an opening. The latter was afraid.

Their last exchange had leaned on outside forces. Long Chen had harnessed Lei Linger’s energy, while the Lifehunter expert had utilized the energy amassed within his divine sword over countless years.

The crucial difference lay in the fact that Lei Linger’s power was practically limitless, whereas that sword’s power was depleting. If it continued, that sword would break.

Losing that sword would be akin to losing both his arms—a circumstance the Lifehunter expert couldn't afford.

“We’ll end things here. I’ll take your life next time,” sneered the Lifehunter expert, and he suddenly appeared in front of the academy’s gates.

“Keep dreaming!” shouted Xia Chen as he swiftly formed hand seals. All of a sudden, multiple layers of light covered the academy. Xia Chen had added layers of shields on top of the academy’s formations.

“You’re the one dreaming. What a pitiful frog at the bottom of a well,” the Lifehunter expert sneered. He simply stabbed Xia Chen’s barriers with his sword. The barriers then rippled, and he passed right through them.

“What?!” Xia Chen’s expression completely changed. Somehow, this Lifehunter expert had a method to nullify all kinds of defensive formations.

“Remove your formation!” shouted Long Chen

Xia Chen hastily undid his work. Following that, an explosive sound rang out as Long Chen forcibly ripped a giant hole in the academy’s outer barrier.

The Lifehunter expert had a mysterious power that nullified the formations’ effects. On the other hand, Long Chen had to use raw brute force.

With Long Chen in pursuit, the two of them vanished from sight, leaving the academy’s disciples staring at the hole in silence. They still felt like they were dreaming.Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Xia Chen just stood there, overwhelmed by humiliation. As a formation master, someone had actually deemed his proudest work as trash.

“Luo Ning, are you alright?” At this time, Yu Qingxuan ran over to Luo Ning’s side. Seeing how pale she was, Yu Qingxuan hastily fed her a medicinal pill.

“I’m fine. It’s thanks to Big Brother Long Chen’s warning back then. Otherwise, that sword would have pierced my head instead of my chest.” Thinking back, Luo Ning shivered in fear.

Back then, she hadn’t sensed anything. It was Long Chen’s bloodline power that startled her and raised her sense of alarm. After that, she launched her own attack, resulting in that assassin switching the angle of his attack.

However, even though she managed to deviate his attack, when that mysterious sword pierced her, it sucked away her blood, leaving her soul almost crumbling.

If Long Chen hadn’t come and injected his own violet blood to prevent her soul from dissipating, she wouldn’t have lasted long enough for Luo Bing to arrive. Just thinking about it, Luo Ning felt traumatized.

Just as everyone was discussing that terrifying Lifehunter expert, two people were watching everything from a high vantage point of the academy. They were Bai Leitan and the sweeping elder.

“The Lifehunter race revealed themselves in such a high-profile manner to target the violet blood race. However, the real violet blood race has not appeared in countless years, so Long Chen is now the world’s strongest expert of the violet blood race and the Lifehunter race’s main target. However, to dare to brazenly barge into my academy to kill people, they really are looking down on me,” said Bai Letian.

Bai Letian’s tone remained flat, but a profound iciness simmered in his eyes. Even someone as amicable as him was genuinely enraged.

On the other hand, the sweeping elder remained indifferent. Observing the hole in the formation, he calmly remarked, “This world has been thrown into chaos. If you cannot even find the source of the chaos, don’t even think about fixing the threads.”

Bai Letian bitterly smiled. “Sweeping elder, are you saying that my realm is still lacking?”

“If you cannot remain calm, it only shows that you’re still too young. Nevertheless, this anger shows that you still have some spirit. That is a good thing. Anger itself is not detrimental, but it becomes undesirable when unleashed prematurely. Long Chen is even younger, and he may not endure as well as you. Thus, let him handle certain matters on our behalf. Refrain from adding fuel to the fire. Allow events to unfold in their proper sequence,” advised the sweeping elder.

“Disciple understands.” Bai Letian bowed.

The sweeping elder nodded. “Our academy has endured for many years. At this crucial moment, we must continue enduring. As for Long Chen, let him go wild. You can just feel good about supporting him.”

“Yes,” replied Bai Letian before departing. Observing as he left, the sweeping elder sighed.

“It’s nice to be young.”

…

The void exploded. Golden wings sliced through the air as Long Chen surged like a bolt of lightning.

BOOM!

Long Chen thrust his lightning spear once again, forcing a figure to materialize from the void.
