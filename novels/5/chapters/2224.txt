Chapter 2214 Remember This

Long Chen ignored the pressure of Han Zijun’s manifestation, slapping him with the back of his hand as easily as if he was a disobedient child.

Han Zijun’s head was spinning. Seeing other people’s strange gazes, he let out a furious roar. A sword appeared in his hand.

Long Chen’s figure flashed, and he once more slapped Han Zijun in the face. This time, Han Zijun spun dozens of times through the air like a spinning top.

“You even dare to raise a weapon against me? Your guts aren’t small.”

Long Chen slapped him again with the back of his hand, sending him spinning in the opposite direction. His body twisted like dough, and at the same time, bloody teeth flew through the air like flowers.

“Long Chen, what are you doing?!” shouted the elder from the outer branches of the divine families.

“Old ghost, shut your mouth. If you want to keep your teeth, then tighten your fart hole,” said Long Chen coldly.

Han Zijun stabilized while Long Chen was speaking. His manifestation shook as he activated his Spirit Blood. After that, the sword in his hand blazed with divine light. The void rumbled as he slashed it at Long Chen.

Xia Yunchong was appalled. If this sword landed, then it wouldn’t just be the Heavenly Cloud Platform that was destroyed. The entire capital might be turned into ruins.

“Kneel!”

Long Chen stood with his arms behind his back, not even looking at that sword. He stared only at Han Zijun.

With Long Chen’s icy gaze locked onto him, Han Zijun felt like he had been cast into the Asura Hell. His entire body turned ice-cold. The feeling of death hung over him, telling him that he was about to die.

His sword just hung in the air above Long Chen’s head. He didn’t dare to slash it down, and his hand quivered.

Everyone stared in dumbfounded silence. Long Chen was just standing there, but that was enough to intimidate Han Zijun to the point that he didn’t dare to unleash his attack. If he did unleash it, wouldn’t Long Chen die like this? Using his own life to mess around, wasn’t Long Chen a bit too crazy?

Looking at Long Chen’s arrogant figure, Xia Youluo thought back to how they had once messed around in the Wine God Palace to get as much wine as possible. It seemed like another lifetime.

Ever since she had killed herself and then been saved by Long Chen, that childish girl had disappeared. But the price of growing into a different person was that she no longer had an excuse to act like a spoiled child in front of Long Chen like she had back in the Wine God Palace.

“Kneel. Don’t make me say it again,” demanded Long Chen.

“You...” Han Zijun trembled. How could he kneel? What would happen to his dignity?

However, Long Chen’s eyes were like the eyes of the Grim Reaper. Han Zijun’s life was in his hands.

“If I want to kill you, not even a god would be able to protect you. I’ll give you three breaths’ time. Kneel or die. You decide,” declared Long Chen.

Long Chen’s killing intent was locked onto Han Zijun. However, Long Chen was actually waiting for the people from the outer branches of the divine families to interfere. Of course, even if they did, Long Chen wouldn’t be sparing this arrogant fool who had wanted to make Xia Yunchong kneel.

He wanted to be arrogant? Then Long Chen would show him what true arrogance was. Today, if he didn’t kneel, then even with the outer branches of the divine families present, Long Chen would kill him.

A third step Netherpassage expert? So what? As long as Long Chen desired it, not one of them would be escaping.

“Fine, I admit defeat.”

Han Zijun really did kneel before Long Chen. He stabbed his sword into the ground, and his body was quivering, either from fear or anger.

The entire Heavenly Cloud Platform was deathly silent. People didn’t dare believe their eyes. The previously mighty Han Zijun had really knelt to Long Chen.

“Long Chen, as an outsider, you are interfering in the matters of the four nations and have broken the order between them. We came to bear witness to these events, but you interfered. Are you looking down on the divine families?” demanded the lead elder of the divine families’ outer branches.

“Are you an idiot? How am I an outsider? If your eyes aren’t blind, take a look at this. What is it?” Long Chen took out the tablet on his waist.

On the very front of it, it was written National Protector, Great General Long Chen. Long Chen thanked his luck that the person he had tried to give it to had refused, otherwise, he wouldn’t have this proof. Of course, everyone in the Grand Xia could testify to him having received envoys from the Grand Han, but it was better to have physical proof.

That elder’s expression grew ugly. Long Chen actually had an official position within the Grand Xia, and that meant that he did have an excuse to interfere.

Seeing the elder fall silent, Long Chen squatted down to face the unwilling, furious, and terrified Han Zijun. Long Chen patted his face. “Little fellow, don’t be aggrieved. Think about how arrogant you were when you came in. I’ve already been very polite. Actually, you’re very lucky that you didn’t end up killing anyone from the Grand Xia when you barged up here. Otherwise, you wouldn’t even have a chance to kneel. Your head would already be in my hand as an offering to the dead. Don’t think that you’re amazing just because someone awakened your Spirit Blood and Empyrean manifestation. That manifestation isn’t a heavens’ soul manifestation. Moreover, your foundation is shaky, and your realm is unstable. You don’t even have the spiritual perception of a real expert. Killing you is as easy as killing a chicken. If you were competing in true combat power, Xia Yunchong could kill two of you on his own. All you are is a pig who looks big. To save your life by kneeling, it’s an excellent trade. At this time, you shouldn’t be angry, you should be happy.”

Long Chen patted Han Zijun like he was teaching a disobedient child. That tone of his was both shocking and funny.

Long Chen was so strong that just a word from him could make a person kneel. That was no coincidence. His power was so great that Han Zijun didn’t dare to resist. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

Long Chen stopped patting Han Zijun’s face and instead poked his head. “You’re just a pitiful insect being used by others, but use this big head of yours to remember my words clearly. If you want to live longer, don’t throw away all morality. With the slightest carelessness, you’ll throw your life away as well. This time, you were lucky, but no one can rely on luck to survive a lifetime. Will you remember this?”

“I’ll remember!”

Han Zijun’s face was numb from being patted, and the poke made stars spin in his head. He was completely subdued by Long Chen now. His mouth was swollen and his teeth were gone. His words were mumbled almost incoherently.

With his life in Long Chen’s hands, he would believe anything Long Chen said. More importantly, Long Chen’s words were right on the mark.

Originally, he was an extremely low level prince of the Grand Han. Although he was talented, he hadn’t reached the level of the old Grand Han’s Three Monarchs.

Someone had used a secret art to stimulate his Spirit Blood and artificially increase his realm. However, this was not the result of his own training, and as a result, his actual combat power was not very strong.

That was why he refused to fight Xia Yunchong and put on an act of looking down on him. In truth, he was afraid.

His act had been exposed, and his life was in Long Chen’s hands. His mental realm had already collapsed. From a wolf baring his fangs, he had transformed into an obedient rabbit.

Seeing Long Chen looking like an elder lecturing a child, turning the arrogant Han Zijun into his current state, people sighed inside. Evil people were best handled by evil people.

“You can scram,” said Long Chen.

Han Zijun fled like a prisoner released from a death sentence. He hastily bowed to Long Chen before hiding behind the elders of the divine families’ outer branches.

“Long Chen...” The lead elder glared at Long Chen.

“Is the name Long Chen something you can say? Do you not want your life? You have to call me Great General Long Chen or perhaps Master Long. If it weren’t in deference to your old age, I’d have already slapped you,” said Long Chen disdainfully.

“You...” The elder raged. He was from the outer branches of the divine families. Although he wasn’t a true member of the divine families, other cultivators would have to be respectful toward him no matter where he went. With his status, how could he call someone master?

“What? Don’t try to tell me that you didn’t know the real reason why you came here. I’ll say this: if anyone dares to get any ideas over the Grand Xia, they can’t blame me for becoming their enemy. Let me tell you, when I get angry, even I’m afraid of myself. So it would be best if you didn’t provoke me and stayed away from the Grand Han. No one can touch the Grand Xia, or I’ll make sure they have a miserable life,” declared Long Chen.

This matter was clear. The outer branches of the divine families had supported Han Zijun. Of all the people who had come, most likely Han Zijun was the only member of the Grand Han. The rest were just disguised members of the outer branches of the divine families.

From the way they were enraged at how Xia Youluo had killed one of them, the truth was clear. If it was just some random disciple of the Grand Han, they wouldn’t have tried to kill her.

They were trying to use Han Zijun as a puppet to secretly subdue the other three nations. As for why, Long Chen didn’t know and he didn’t care.

This was his warning not to provoke him. The Grand Xia had a relationship with him, and if anyone dared to touch the Grand Xia, he would make them pay a bloody price, even if they were the divine families.

“Long Chen, you’re too arrogant!” roared the elder, his whole body quivering in rage.

“Just this is arrogant?”

Long Chen suddenly took out a black saber. A flash of light appeared.

The elder that had previously attacked Xia Youluo was cut in half by Long Chen’s saber, his Yuan Spirit killed.

“Then what does this count as?”

Long Chen lazily rested Evilmoon on his shoulder, looking at the elder with a faint smile.
