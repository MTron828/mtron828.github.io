Chapter 3247 Vile Dragon Domain

“Are you joking with me? Go be dean of a branch academy?” Long Chen stared at the deputy dean in disbelief.

The deputy dean laughed. “What would be the point of such a joke? I’m being serious. This is also the will of the dean. Of course, you can accept or refuse. It’s up to yourself. The academy will not force any disciple to do something they don’t want to do.”

Long Chen suddenly thought of something and asked, “Does our High Firmament Academy really have branches? How come I’ve never heard of them?”

“Of course we have them. The High Firmament Academy is the most ancient academy in the nine heavens and ten lands. How could we not have branches? If you are interested, I’ll explain it to you,” said the deputy dean.

Long Chen was naturally interested. He hastily poured some tea for the deputy dean and quietly listened to his story. As he explained, Long Chen came to understand just how glorious the original High Firmament Academy was.

Their branches were spread throughout the immortal world. As for why they declined, the deputy dean didn’t say much. He merely said that some things had happened, resulting in the destruction of countless branch academies, leaving behind only the main academy.

The branch academies were still there, but after tens of thousands of years, they were nothing more than ruins. Some had also been occupied by others.

Right now, the academy was planning on sending Long Chen to one of those branches. According to the deputy dean, as long as the main academy was present, then the branch academies would still have karmic luck flowing within the ruins.

As long as a new tower was built on top of those ruins and ignited, the karmic luck would flow again.

Once the karmic luck was activated, the main academy could directly construct a transportation formation connecting the two. In the future, the academy’s disciples could come and go without passing through the devil sea.

“There will probably be many challenges, no?”

Long Chen was no fool. The deputy dean might put it simply, but if it was really so easy, the academy would have long since done so.

“Of course it will be difficult. Very, very difficult. Countless forces will not permit such a thing to occur. Of course, that includes Lord Brahma. Even palace master Bai Zhantang wanted to try it, but the dean refused to consent to it. However, for some reason, he sent me to ask you,” said the deputy dean. Clearly, he was of the opinion that Long Chen shouldn’t go. But since the dean had sent him, he had to fulfill his duty.

“If Lord Brahma is watching, how can we succeed? Even if the divine tower is built, once they come, won’t we have to run?” asked Long Chen in confusion.

“No. Once the divine tower is built, the High Firmament Academy’s experts will not permit it to be destroyed by anyone. The main thing is that the tower must be built quickly without others damaging it in the process. That’s the main difficulty. All the ruins are being monitored, so any actions we make will be noticed,” said the deputy dean.

“That’s far too difficult. How can I, a Four Peak disciple, possibly do it?” demanded Long Chen. This was an impossible task. To build a tower right under people’s eyes, with failure spelling death?

“I feel the same way. But the dean said that you are the only one in the High Firmament Academy that can do this. But don’t feel any pressure. The dean also said that you can do it if you want. But if you don’t want to do it, then don’t force it,” said the deputy dean.

“Is there a reward?” Long Chen couldn’t help asking. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

The deputy dean laughed. “The dean said that you would ask that. As long as you can do this, then in the future, the High Firmament Academy will be your steadiest support. After all, you are the dean of a branch academy. At any time, the High Firmament Academy will stand behind you. Furthermore, it is the type of support that means no matter the price.”

Long Chen’s heart leaped. What did that mean? Was the academy willing to go to war with Lord Brahma for him?

No matter the price? That clearly referred to Lord Brahma. The High Firmament Academy had been acting low-key for so many years, so were they announcing their comeback?

However, Long Chen could hear the confidence in the deputy dean’s voice. The High Firmament Academy was truly not afraid of Lord Brahma.

But if they weren’t afraid of Lord Brahma, why had they been suppressed for so long? Why were they only starting their counterattack now?

No matter how Long Chen wracked his brain, he was unable to figure it out. But this reward truly did move him. With such a powerful backer, he could do so many things in the future.

“Where is the branch academy? You haven’t said which branch. What kind of forces surround it? Is there any more detailed information?” asked Long Chen.

“The branch academy that you will reconstruct is the seventh branch, and it is located at the end of the Vile Dragon Domain’s Dragon Spine Mountain Range. The Vile Dragon Domain is different from the Heavenly Swell Domain. The human race’s cultivators are not the dominant force there. It is the opposite. The human race can only cultivate there with their tails pressed between their legs. The Vile Dragon Domain was once the land of the vile dragon race, and thousands of different vile dragons lived there. They set up their own independent regime, so the wild beasts, demonic beasts, and devil beasts there ran rampant. Moreover, the spiritual qi there is dense and more suitable for beast cultivation. As those beast races dislike the human race, the human race has a tough time living there. However, it is also a land of countless treasures. All kinds of precious medicines can be found there. Thus, it is a very dangerous area, but humans continue to risk it and go there for adventure. In my personal opinion, your talent is extraordinary and you are smart, but this matter will still be extremely dangerous for you. You should carefully consider your decision,” said the deputy dean.

Vile Dragon Domain? Long Chen suddenly had a thought. Did the dean want to send him there because he had true dragon essence blood?

The Heavenly Swell Domain was like a prison. Others were unable to enter as they pleased. Hence, if he wanted to join up with the others, he would have to have a way to get out.

However, if he simply left without a powerful backer, he would also be forced to tuck his tail between his legs.

And if he could reconstruct the seventh branch academy, that would be a solid stronghold for everyone to gather at.

Long Chen could also see that this was the High Firmament Academy’s first step in returning to their past glory.

However, what kind of trump cards the academy had or what their plans were, they were all unknown to Long Chen. But leaving the Heavenly Swell Domain was at the top of his priority list.

“I’m prepared to try it. But I need some time first,” said Long Chen.

The deputy dean nodded. “There’s no rush. If you agree, then the academy needs to prepare some things. However, remember, do not tell others about this matter. No other person can hear of it.”

Long Chen was startled. He wasn’t such a talkative person. But for the deputy dean to so sternly warn him of it, he found it odd.

“Vile Dragon Domain? I’m looking forward to it!” Long Chen felt a trace of excitement. If this step was completed, it was one step closer to the day of the Dragonblood Legion gathering once more.
