Chapter 4047 Sweeping Through the Eight Empires

The heavens had truly been pierced, and the imprint of the ancient cauldron was left in the sky. Cracks then spread through the dome of the heavens.

Normally, the Heavenly Daos would automatically repair themselves no matter how severe the damage they suffered. However, this time, it was as if the self-recovery abilities of the Heavenly Daos had weakened.

A net of cracks just hung in the air, and there was no sign of it healing. Looking at those giant cracks, people felt chills.

“Long Chen!”

Yu Qingxuan charged over at Long Chen who had lost consciousness. As he fell from the sky, Yu Qingxuan caught him.

Long Chen was covered in blood, and his eyes were closed shut. Black bloodstains still marred the skin beneath his left eye, emanating an aura of hellish darkness. However, Yu Qingxuan didn't let the gruesome sight deter her. With great concern and affection, she tightly hugged Long Chen, her heart overwhelmed with emotion. Upon sensing that his Spiritual Strength was still present, she couldn't help but shed tears of relief and joy. Long Chen was still alive.

A slender hand gently touched Long Chen's forehead, and Dong Mingyu appeared by his side. Usually, her expression was indifferent, but now it was filled with worry. After all, Long Chen's Spiritual Strength seemed to be hanging on, but the fluctuations were highly erratic. What troubled her even more was the presence of a sinister dark energy that was fiercely active within him.

“Master…” Dong Mingyu looked at Ye Wusheng beseechingly.

Ye Wusheng looked at Long Chen and then said, “He is fine. However, the power of hell isn’t so easy to control. After using the power of hell to destroy the envoys, he had to pay a price for it. As for what the price is, only the future can tell. Anyway, he is now infected with the Nether Emperor’s karma, and no one can say what will happen to him. Mingyu, we’re leaving!”

“Master, I want to…”

“You’ll have plenty of chances to reunite in the future. As your master, I promised that once you personally killed Enpuda, I would pass my full legacy to you. Rather than wasting time here, you should be cultivating so that you have enough power to stay together longer,” said Ye Wusheng. She then grabbed Dong Mingyu’s hand and started walking away.

Dong Mingyu kept looking back, her gaze heartbreaking. But ultimately, she chose to listen to her master.

Suddenly, Ye Wusheng paused and looked back at everyone. “When Long Chen wakes up, tell him to immediately leave the Violet Flame Heaven. Large groups of experts will quickly come looking for him, and there might even be existences on my level.”

Ye Wusheng then pointed at the sky and told Yu Xiaoyun, “This hole will not heal for at least a thousand years. With the wall of the heavens broken, primal chaos qi will come out of it. If you want to strengthen your immemorial heroic spirit, do your best to create a formation around it. If you miss this chance, you will find others coming to take it from you. If that happens, the Vermilion Bird Empire will never recover.”

“Many thanks, senior!” Yu Xiaoyun hastily bowed. He knew that this short-haired woman’s origins were shocking.

Ye Wusheng then waved her hand slightly. Without looking back, she vanished into the void while holding Dong Mingyu’s hand. No one knew where they went.

“Activate the grand formation! Pour in all our resources to strengthen the Vermilion Bird’s heroic spirit!” shouted Yu Xiaoyun.

Ye Wusheng was Dong Mingyu’s master, and Dong Mingyu was close to Long Chen. Thus, Yu Xiaoyun was sure that Ye Wusheng wouldn’t trick them.

Once the grand formation activated, the dim capital once more lit up. At the same time, pillars of light soared out of certain places on the Vermilion Bird Empire’s borders.

“The broken formations can be repaired?” Yu Qianxue and the others were surprised. It had to be known that on their way back here, they had personally seen the broken formations of the border cities.

“They only broke the fake formations that we set up to trick them. After all, we wanted to capture them all in one net and settle things once and for all. However, we didn’t expect them to summon the Yan Xu Gate and the hell gate. If it weren’t for Long Chen, we’d have lost,” sighed Yu Xiaoyun.

According to their original plan, Yu Xiaoyun had been one hundred percent confident of crushing the eight empires.

After all, the Vermilion Bird Grand Formation’s strongest technique had yet to be unleashed. If it was used, it would be enough to wipe out all their enemies, but that would also damage the Vermilion Bird Empire’s foundation. Still, in his opinion, wiping out all their enemies and gaining countless years of peace was worth it.

In the end, they could never unleash this technique because the hell gate had the ability to suppress the Vermilion Bird's heroic spirit. While the Vermilion Bird's power could combat the Yan Xu Flames, it proved ineffective against the power of hell.Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

This time, Long Chen not only rescued Yu Qingxuan but also safeguarded the entire Vermilion Bird Empire, thereby saving countless lives among the common people.

Yu Xiaoyun quickly gave some orders. “Yunwen, Yifeng, Qianxue, Ziang, Fengyi, Changfeng, Qiwen, Xuefeng, the eight of you lead eight squads to the eight empires! Seal off their cities and treasuries. Tell them that starting now, the names of the eight empires are erased. All their territory belongs to the Vermilion Bird Empire. If anyone dares to dissent, execute them. Extraordinary circumstances require extraordinary measures. There is no reason to speak of. There are only your bloody weapons!”

“As you order!”

Everyone immediately assented as they were all nursing a belly of fire. This time, it had truly been dangerous. If it weren’t for Long Chen, not a single soul from the Vermilion Bird Empire would have survived.

With that in mind, they had no intention of being merciful or courteous toward their enemies. Also, Zhu Yunwen and the rest of the group realized that entrusting them with leading the troops was Yu Xiaoyun's way of acknowledging their outstanding performance in battle.

The eight of them then led the Vermilion Bird Empire’s elites to the eight empires. As the experts of the eight empires had been decimated, this conquest posed no threat at all. All their city lords even came out and begged for mercy.

Throughout the conquest of the eight empires, the Vermilion Bird Empire faced minimal resistance. While there were sporadic dissenters, their absolute power obliterated any trace of opposition, leaving no room for defiance in the face of such overwhelming might.

The treasures of the eight empires were swiftly confiscated, becoming the resources of the Vermilion Bird Empire. With a newfound fervor, the empire focused on making the most of these riches.

Moreover, Yu Xiaoyun and his companions were overjoyed to discover that the primal chaos qi emanating from the rift in the heavens had immensely positive effects on the Vermilion Bird's heroic spirit. With each passing day, its strength grew exponentially. If they were able to absorb this energy for a thousand years, the Vermilion Bird Empire would become an unstoppable force, unafraid of any potential enemy.

As the Vermilion Bird Empire got to work, Long Chen descended into endless darkness.

Within this darkness, there was not the slightest sound nor the slightest light. There was only a deathly silence.

However, within this darkness, Long Chen didn’t feel the slightest bit nervous or afraid. Here, he felt at peace; he felt safe. Just like he said, when he was most helpless, when he was most weary, the darkness enveloped him, sympathized with him, and comforted him.

“Long Chen, the great nine star heir, we’ve finally connected again.” Within that darkness, an ancient voice rang out. That familiar voice was back.
