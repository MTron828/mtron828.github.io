Chapter 4102 Fulfilling Promises

Although it was just a vague figure, Long Chen recognized that it was Lord Brahma.Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

“You traitors! You dare to betray the Fullmoon race?!” roared the race leader.

“What betrayal? It’s you who remains pedantic and cannot adapt to the present era! Lord Brahma’s divine light has covered the majority of the nine heavens and ten lands, so why would our Fullmoon race resist him? We guard this life-forbidden area, but what benefits do we get out of it? Every year, so many of our warriors die while standing guard over the dark world. But who gave a damn about us?” The Heaven Venerate instantly grew fearless after summoning this holy figure.

“What bullshit! We stand guard over the dark gate to fulfill our duty, our promise! When did our Fullmoon race break its promises?!” raged the race leader.

“Our promises? Our duty? So what?! Let me tell you the truth. If the Fullmoon race continues to refuse to move forward, the only thing awaiting you is death. Do you know? Quite a few powers in the life-forbidden area are secretly loyal to Lord Brahma! Lord Brahma will soon control the nine heavens. How laughable is it? You refuse to follow him due to some promise made by some foolish ancestors. Even with your deaths at hand, you don’t realize the truth. How many lives does the Fullmoon race lose to guard the dark world? How many places in the life-forbidden area are we powerless to enter? Wouldn’t working with Lord Brahma be far more beneficial?” The Heaven Venerate sneered. Seeing that they were exposed, he directly told them the truth.

Hearing this, Long Chen understood. It seemed that they had fully become Lord Brahma’s followers. Lord Brahma didn’t reveal himself personally, but his hands had spread to the life-forbidden area, having even infiltrated the Fullmoon race. His methods were truly powerful.

“Bastards! You have betrayed the Fullmoon race! To cast your loyalties to Lord Brahma, you deserve ten thousand deaths! Have you forgotten that the blood of the Fullmoon race is flowing in your veins?!” demanded the race leader.

“Hahaha, so what? We have been cleansed by Lord Brahma’s sacred light. My soul is together with Lord Brahma. Since you refuse to change your ways, don’t blame us for not warning you. When Lord Brahma personally descends, it will be the time of your destruction, hahaha!” The Heaven Venerate laughed.

“Die!”

The race leader furiously unleashed a punch, unable to hold himself back. He also didn’t bother asking about the full truth of this matter.

Buzz.

However, what shocked everyone was that this punch simply passed through that holy figure as if they had become illusory.

“Hahaha, you might be powerful, but you are only a slightly stronger ant in front of Lord Brahma! This is all I will say: if you still can’t differentiate good from bad, don’t blame me when I make rivers of blood flow in the Fullmoon race!”

The holy figure twisted, forming a giant whirlpool that absorbed the traitors. They then vanished without a trace.

“Lord Brahma!”

The race leader quivered with rage. Clearly, they had made their preparations in advance. They only dared to act so brazenly with Lord Brahma supporting them.

Most infuriating of all, these traitors that deserved to die had escaped in front of him, the race leader. That was practically a slap in the face.

“Race leader, activate the totem’s soul chasing art! We will recall their souls!” proposed a Heaven Venerate.

The race leader shook his head. “It is useless. Their souls have been cleansed by Lord Brahma. Otherwise, they wouldn’t dare to be so crazy.”

Upon hearing this, everyone’s expression became grim, and an engulfing silence descended over the whole plaza. Blazing killing intent could be seen in their eyes. After all, traitors were always the most hateful existence.

“Speak. Are you Lord Brahma’s people?!” Suddenly, an elder turned to Long Chen and the others.

“Hahaha!”

Xia Chen, Guo Ran, and the others couldn’t help laughing. Even Long Chen couldn’t help being amused. This fellow had gone crazy from rage. Did he think that everyone was Lord Brahma’s subordinate?

However, it wasn’t that strange. After all, Lord Brahma was from the human race, and so were they. It was plausible that Long Chen had come and driven these people away to gain the Fullmoon race’s trust.

By saving Xu Changchuan and sacrificing a few pawns, Long Chen would have the Fullmoon race’s full trust. If he really were Lord Brahma’s subordinate, that would be a great plan.

“What are you laughing at?!” demanded the Fullmoon race’s experts.

“Have you not heard my boss’s great name? Or do you not pay attention to news from the outside world?” asked Guo Ran.

“Brother Guo Ran, our Fullmoon race’s information network really is limited. There must be some misunderstandings. Please help us out,” said Xu Changchuan hastily to stop a conflict from erupting.

Only then did Guo Ran solemnly say, “Do you know of Lord Brahma’s four halls?”

“Of course. The Nine Underworld Hall, the Bloodkill Hall, the Sacred Pill Hall, and the Martial God Hall. That’s old news from many years ago. Who doesn’t know about it?” said one elder frostily.

“Then do you know who the master of the Nine Underworld Hall and the Bloodkill Hall are?” asked Guo Ran.

The elder impatiently said, “Of course! Liao Bencang and Enpuda. Do you think that I’m a child? What’s the point of such senseless questions?”

“Alright, then do you know that the two of them have been killed?”

“What?!”

All the Fullmoon experts were shocked, including the race leader.

Seeing their shocked expressions, Guo Ran was very pleased. He continued, “Liao Bencang and Enpuda both died at our hands. Why don’t you tell me whether we’re on Lord Brahma’s side?”

“Died at your hands? Impossible! You’re just bragging!” shouted a Fullmoon expert. He refused to believe such a thing.

It had to be known that Liao Bencang and Enpuda were both god cultivators with Lord Brahma’s divine seal on them, meaning that they could utilize Lord Brahma’s power.

Let alone some Immortal Kings, even Heaven Venerates would at most have a chance at defeating them, but definitely not killing them.

“Tch, first of all, we’re too arrogant to bother telling lies. Secondly, we’re smart enough not to tell lies that would be exposed. It won’t be long before news from the Violet Flame Heaven reaches the Nirvana Overflow Heaven. You can just ask around then. If you don’t know anything, don’t randomly accuse others. You’re not losing your own face but the face of your Fullmoon race,” snorted Guo Ran.

“You…!” That elder was enraged. Guo Ran’s words didn’t leave him with any face.

The race leader suddenly waved his hand, interrupting him. He then looked at Long Chen.

“I will fulfill Changchuan’s promise.”

“Race leader, you can’t!”

All the experts of the Fullmoon race cried out.
