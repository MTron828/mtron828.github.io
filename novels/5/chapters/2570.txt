Chapter 2559 Untameable

This terrifying phoenix was a soul art, not a true physical body. However, it was still cleaved in two by Long Chen’s saber.

As a result, Feng Fei instantly turned as pale as paper. Blood flowed out of her mouth, and the phoenix’s mournful cry rang out as it fell from the sky. At this moment, Feng Fei was filled with disbelief.

Last time, she had used this move in an attempt to suppress Long Chen in front of the headquarters of the ancient family alliance. However, that had provoked Long Chen’s Divine Gate Star, resulting in a fierce counterattack that ended with both of them injured.

Feng Fei had ended up treating that time as a mystery, but she hadn’t cared particularly because she had not used her full power. At that time, this technique had still been in an embryonic state. Its power was now many times greater.

This attack contained a phoenix’s soul essence that she used her soul to nourish. It was a priceless treasure of the divine families, something unique with no duplicate even within the divine families.

In her youth, this strand of soul essence had been placed in her soul to be raised as her most loyal housepet. When she used this soul art, the phoenix’s soul essence supported it. Such a soul art contained the divine might of a phoenix, making it an incredibly powerful move.

However, even such a powerful move was cut in two by Long Chen. Her phoenix soul essence was injured.

“Last time you were so forceful. I didn’t know how to use soul arts, nor did I wish to expose my trump cards because of you. That’s the only reason you managed to injure me. This is the constant look of the divine families, arrogant idiots who think the world belongs to them. I give you face, but you don’t give face. The big picture, the lives of the world, righteousness, you don’t care about any of them. By blaming us for all these when we don’t listen to your orders, are you taking us for fools? Since you don’t want to get along, we can all just trap ourselves. We’ll see who dies first.” Long Chen stepped forward and slashed Evilmoon at Feng Fei once more.

In the distance, Long Aotian’s expression darkened. Long Chen’s cursing had included him as well. He then narrowed his eyes.

The Long family had sent him in order to form a good relationship with Long Chen. The Long family’s higher-ups had already figured out Long Chen’s character. He was someone who repaid debts. As long as they gave him a favor, they could easily get closer.

If Long Aotian could pull Long Chen in, it would be equivalent to pulling in the Dragonblood Legion, the Martial Heaven Alliance, and the Xuan Beasts as well.

However, Long Aotian had his own pride, and he was resistant to helping Long Chen. That was because Long Chen had snubbed their faces back in the day. Furthermore, Long Aotian didn’t really care about the Martial Heaven Continent’s people. He didn’t think there was anyone useful amongst them that could help him. But since the family head had ordered him, he had no choice but to come.

He knew that this was not something only involving him. It implicated the competition between all four families. Although he was unwilling, he still had to come.

However, he hadn’t expected that Long Chen wouldn’t even give him a chance to interfere. Long Chen’s power was truly stunning.

He had been standing in the distance the entire time, just waiting for Long Chen to fall into crisis so that he could save Long Chen. That was the order that the Long family head had given him.

Unfortunately, Long Chen’s arrogance greatly displeased him. Long Chen was publicly challenging the divine families, and this further antagonized him.

BOOM!

Jiang Wuchen charged over. Despite being covered in blood, he blocked Long Chen. In exchange, he was sent flying once more.

Jiang Wuchen was no longer in his peak state. After being repeatedly injured so badly, his Blood Qi was no longer at full capacity. On the other hand, it seemed that Long Chen was still as strong as ever.

“Even Sovereign sprouts can’t stop him. It seems that Long Chen truly has the ability to suppress Zhao Ritian.” When they heard that Long Chen had suppressed Zhao Ritian, they assumed that he had done so with the full power of the Dragonblood Legion. Now it seemed that he had no need for such a thing.

Jiang Wuchen’s defeat was already clear. In terms of power, he was at an absolute disadvantage. As for Feng Fei, she was injured after only one blow. On the other side of the battlefield, Ye Liangchen was still trapped by Huo Linger. Was there anyone who could stop him now?

“Bastard, you’re courting death!”

Jiang Wuchen roared. A berserk expression appeared on his face.

Jiang Wuchen’s chest suddenly began to glow. In that instant, the world flickered and an intense feeling of death swamped Long Chen’s heart.

“You can’t!” Feng Fei turned grave and charged over at Jiang Wuchen.

Bang!

Suddenly, a hand slammed into Jiang Wuchen’s chest. The light that was gathering there shattered.

“You’ve gone mad. If you activate your Spirit Bone now, you will no longer be qualified to become a Sovereign.” The one who had interfered was surprisingly Long Aotian.

Long Aotian’s movements were extremely bizarre. He was completely silent, like a phantom. No one had sensed him move.

Long Aotian’s actions caused Jiang Wuchen to cough up a mouthful of blood. His aura suddenly dropped.

Feng Fei supported Jiang Wuchen. Examining his chest, she finally sighed with relief.

Long Chen looked at Long Aotian. “Are you joining in as well?”

“I came to save you. We can stop here.” Long Aotian frowned.

“Save me? Hahaha!” Long Chen laughed. “What a huge joke. The only one in this world that can save me is myself. From the Star Field Divine World, I can tell that your divine families are not interested in fighting against the tribulation of the dark era. You don’t care about the lives of the Martial Heaven Continent. You’re so busy fighting each other that you aren’t even aware of yourselves. You act like gods, like others owe you something. It’s like the slightest offense against you deserves complete annihilation. Sorry, I don’t care how strong you are, but I’m no longer associating with you. This bastard threatened me just now, so I’m going to kill him. You now have two options, either leave or take out your weapon.”

“Long Chen, you are too arrogant!” barked Long Aotian.

“Me, arrogant? Am I as arrogant as you Sovereign sprouts? Back in the Immemorial Path, you were so arrogant that you didn’t give a damn about other people’s lives. Others were undergoing tribulation, but you suddenly charged in. Others begged you to let them live, but what did you do? Other than disdainfully sneering at them, what else did you do? There’s no need for more words. Are you getting out of the way or not?” The more Long Chen talked, the angrier he became. The hatred toward the four of them from back then was now unleashed.

Back then, Yue Xiaoqian was undergoing her tribulation and almost died due to their tribulation. Long Chen had begged them to slow down and allow her to pass. After all, her tribulation was almost over, and she would need at most a few breaths of time.

However, the four of them hadn’t cared about either of them. Long Chen was powerless to interfere in Yue Xiaoqian’s tribulation, but fortunately she had managed to pass with her own power.

At that time, Long Chen’s hatred had started simmering toward the four of them, and upon entering the Star Field Divine World, Long Chen had given up any hope toward the Long family.

The Long family had not given him any information about what was inside, and he refused to believe that they didn’t know Zhao Ritian would be coming in. He refused to believe that they didn’t know about the Ten Thousand Dragon Nest or the mother tree.

Moreover, the sea demon race, Pill Valley, the Corrupt path, and the divine families had colluded to bait him into the territory of the mother tree in order to kill him. He refused to believe that this was not prearranged.

In Long Chen’s view, the Star Field Divine World had been a trap. Although it wasn’t necessarily set up by the Long family, they had known about it and not told him. This was a betrayal.

Now that he was facing Long Aotian, his past and current enmity had combined. Hence, Long Chen was filled with killing intent.

He would no longer be working together with the divine families. In the Star Field Divine World, he had sworn not to rely on others but himself.

Long Chen pointed Evilmoon at Long Aotian’s nose. Everyone was stunned. Long Chen was planning on challenging all four Sovereign sprouts at once.

Long Aotian stared at Long Chen. He slowly clenched his fists. “I was thinking of helping you, but since you refuse to recognize kindness, don’t blame me.”

Just as Long Aotian was about to make his move, rumbling filled the air. A horrifying pressure crashed down upon heaven and earth.

“Long Chen, release Ritian or I will slaughter your entire family!”

A furious roar rang out. The void rumbled and collapsed, revealing a black hand. As the hand pulled at the void, an old woman walked out.

“Tearing through the void. It’s a Heaven Merging expert!” Startled cries rang out. This person seemed even stronger than the previous Heaven Merging experts.

This exceedingly ancient-looking woman was covered in wrinkles, and there were countless spots on her skin. She was withered like firewood. It looked like a puff of wind could blow her away.

However, her hands were black and sharp like bird claws. Her nails were very long and looked like they were made of metal.

As soon as the old woman appeared, her figure shook and Long Chen felt a chill. He had been locked onto. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

Without thinking, Long Chen swung Evilmoon. His attack then landed firmly on a withered claw. As a result, Long Chen’s body quivered, and the flesh on his arm almost tore itself off his bones. He flew back.

Long Chen coughed up a mouthful of blood. He was shocked. This person knew true teleportation, so he was unable to grasp her location. He had relied entirely on his years of experience and sense of danger to instinctively block her attack. He had randomly guessed correctly.

“You have some skill.” The old woman was somewhat surprised. Her figure once more vanished.

Long Chen swung Evilmoon behind him, once more accurately blocking her attack. However, this time he coughed up three mouthfuls of blood, tumbling away.

The old woman snorted at being blocked twice. She was about to continue attacking when Long Chen suddenly took out something that made her expression change.
