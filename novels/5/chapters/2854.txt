Chapter 2843 Luo Sisters

“Is he crazy?!

Startled cries rang out. The Elite Group was called trash behind their backs as they only lazed around. No one had ever viewed them as true elites. They were a joke in the academy.

For Li Cai to instantly challenge the third rank Zhong Changsheng, everyone was dumbfounded, including the instructors.

Just at this moment, Heaven Master Yun Yang also appeared. He smiled at Long Chen. “Instructor Long Chen, you seem to be in quite a rush. There’s still ten breaths’ time until the agreed-upon time. Now I feel like I’m late.” Heaven Master Yun Yang was the one who had proposed the time, but he was the last to arrive.

Long Chen shrugged helplessly. “Isn’t that because I have no other choice? If we still didn’t start, there might be someone whose blood dyes the ground red. Then the gamble would be meaningless.”

Everyone then looked toward instructor Ming Ze. Long Chen was clearly referring to his blood.

More than ten times the usual people had arrived here today. It wasn’t just the God Institute’s disciples, but the disciples from other institutes had also been drawn over, resulting in the plaza being packed to the brim.

“What a domineering tone, what a sharp gaze! It’s just like the rumors! That arrogance is truly worthy of someone who dares to call himself Boss Long San!”

At this time, the name of Boss Long San had spread throughout the God Institute and even further.

The names of just Long Chen or instructor Long Chen were unable to properly describe him. Only the name Boss Long San was worthy of his temperament.

Within the God Institute, and perhaps the entire academy, Long Chen was completely unique. A newcomer who had arrived less than two months ago already caused such a ruckus. Countless other newcomers felt admiration and worship for him.

Most newcomers were suppressed by their senior disciples, but Long Chen was able to stand on his own, not bending to anyone. All of them hoped to be the same as him one day.

“Long Chen…” Ming Ze’s expression sank, and he clenched his teeth furiously. Long Chen had once more slapped him in the face.

“Please keep your mouth shut. I’m afraid that you might make me kill you. That might cause me to forfeit a great future,” Long Chen sighed helplessly.

He didn’t know why Ming Ze was so foolish as to constantly go against him. He couldn’t imagine what was growing in his foolish head.

“He is Long San?”

In a distant corner of the plaza, there was a rather conspicuous group of disciples. They didn’t fit in with the rest because they were disciples of the Immortal Institute.

The speaker was a very beautiful young woman with perfect facial features and long hair. However, her face was currently a bit pale, and her eyes were a bit dim. It seemed that she was injured, but her voice was still pleasant to hear.

“Yes. He’s the one that killed the Lightning Lizard Beast in one punch. He’s very powerful, and equally strange and mysterious,” said a woman beside her. That latter was the one that Long Chen had met before, Luo Ning. The other woman was her big sister, the rank one expert on the immortal rankings, Luo Bing.

This big sister seemed to possess a completely different temperament from Luo Ning. While Luo Ning was valiant and carried herself tall, Luo Bing was more subdued. The two sisters were three years apart, but it was Luo Ning who seemed to be the older one.

“How curious. I get a familiar feeling from him,” said Luo Bing.

“You feel it too?” Luo Ning was surprised. “I had the same feeling, but I thought it was a mistake. This little fellow looks nice, but my standards aren’t bad enough to like someone with just a look.”

The first time Luo Ning had seen Long Chen, she was moved by the pain in his eyes. In that instant, for some reason, her heart started pounding, making her feel an urge to comfort and protect him. But that feeling was instantly suppressed by her.

Later on, when she talked to him, he merely answered that his name was Long San. He clearly didn’t want to talk to her.

Hence, although she had obtained the gall of the Lightning Lizard Beast to help Luo Bing recover, the way Long Chen had ignored her did not make her happy.

“He’s too domineering. Without any background, he’ll suffer in the future. If there’s a chance, you can try to warn him that the academy’s interior is rife with complicated connections. It would be better if he could reserve himself a bit…” Luo Bing suddenly had a coughing fit. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

Seeing this scene, Luo Ning hastily took out a medicinal pill for her. Once Luo Bing consumed it, she felt a bit better and continued watching.

Heaven Master Yun Yang saw that Ming Ze was about to reply, so he waved his hand to cut him off. “Alright, the time has come. Any personal grievances between the two of you can be settled after the competition. Of course, from your current appearance, it seems that this enmity will be very difficult to settle. I feel like the chance of a life and death battle being approved is very high.”

Ming Ze’s expression grew unsightly to behold, and he shut his mouth. Last time, Long Chen’s life and death challenge didn’t meet the requirements. But if their conflict reached the point that it couldn’t be mediated, Long Chen could send an application in. Once it passed, the life and death battle would proceed.

Seeing that Ming Ze was silent, Long Chen couldn’t be bothered with him any longer.

“The time has come. I’ll ask Heaven Master Yun Yang to take charge of the competition,” said Long Chen.

“Alright, then let’s not waste time. The challenges can start. As long as ten members of the Elite Group can enter the divine rankings, instructor Long Chen of the God Institute will be allowed to wear whatever he wants without being bound by the God Institute’s rules,” announced Heaven Master Yun Yang.

“He did all this just to not wear instructor robes?”

Luo Bing stared at him strangely. Only now did she learn that Long Chen had gone to such a fuss just for some clothes.

“Who knows? In any case, he really is curious. He doesn’t answer when I ask him anything. It’s annoying,” said Luo Ning irritably.

Considering her straightforward nature, Long Chen’s way of shrugging off her questions vexed her. But she also couldn’t stop feeling furious about him. It made her want to hit someone.

“The challenges start now!” Heaven Master Yun Yang suddenly caused the martial stage to rise. A barrier appeared around it.

Everyone’s gaze focused on the stage. Li Cai was standing there. With everyone’s gaze on him, he grew excited. He had been forced to live a sullen life this entire time. Now his battle intent soared.

“Where is Zhong Changsheng? Come out and face your death!”
