Chapter 3935 Future Path

Long Chen’s hand was about to touch the rust. But when he heard the dragon expert’s warning, he snatched his hand back like he had just been electrocuted.

“You never learn your lesson. I already told you that this cauldron’s origins are too great for you to research,” said the dragon expert irritably.

“But I spent so much effort to obtain it. It has to help me out at least a little bit!” quibbled Long Chen.

“Help you? You aren’t even qualified to touch it right now. That rust is covering up Heavenly Dao runes of the primal chaos era. If that rust falls, just a look will cause it to appear in your next heavenly tribulation. With your current power, what are you going to use to resist it? Even a thousand lives wouldn’t be enough!” raged the dragon expert.

“Fine, I was wrong.” Long Chen stopped arguing and obediently accepted his mistake. In truth, he was very curious about this cauldron and was still thinking about how he could learn more about it.

The dragon expert said that it was incredibly terrifying but didn’t mention anything about its actual origins. Thus, Long Chen felt an itch. Every person had a curious heart, and the stronger the person, the stronger their urge to know things. Long Chen was no exception to this.

“I’ve told you. The bronze cauldron’s origins are immense, and it isn’t something that you can currently control. When your cultivation base reaches that level, it will naturally reach out to you. You have plenty of secrets on you, so don’t mind this one. In any case, don’t touch it and don’t expose it,” warned the dragon expert.

“Alright, I’ll listen to you.” Long Chen put on a very obedient appearance before saying, “Senior, last time, your dragon scale had eight runes. I only learned three. Can you pass the others to me now?”Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Long Chen had ignited five of the runes during that battle in order to rapidly absorb the three runes. Those three runes were Dragon Roars at the Heavens, Cloud Dragon Immolation Claw, and Divine Dragon Pendulum Tail.

Those three moves were incredibly terrifying. Using them, Long Chen had blasted through his enemies. That refreshing feeling was something that would stay with him for the rest of his life.

If he could learn all eight, then Long Chen wondered if he would be qualified to challenge three-flower Divine Venerates.

“Give up on it. You aren’t a true member of the dragon race, and your essence blood is limited. Even if all eight were transmitted to you, you would only be able to unleash three. Furthermore, after every advancement, my dragon race seals their divine abilities into their reverse scale in order to have a fresh start for new divine abilities. As I don't even remember what divine abilities lay within that reverse scale, there’s no way for me to teach them to you,” said the dragon expert.

“Oh.” Long Chen couldn’t help being a bit disappointed. Although the dragon expert veiled this insult, Long Chen could tell that it was saying that he was still human, and his power couldn’t reach the same level as the true dragon race. Compared to them, there was still a difference, and based on its tone, that difference was not small.

That made Long Chen feel a sense of loss. There was no way for him to imagine the power of an ancestral dragon. It didn’t seem like this gap was something that he could make up for.

As if seeing through Long Chen’s disappointment, the dragon expert’s voice softened slightly. “You foolish child, what are you sad about? The power of your physical body was not just increased with my essence blood. Have you forgotten what your foundation is?”

“The Nine Star Hegemon Body Art!”

Long Chen was instantly revitalized. That was right, he cultivated the Nine Star Hegemon Body Art. Could he merge the power of his dragon blood with the nine stars?

This instantly reminded Long Chen of his foundation. The power of the dragon blood had almost made him forget about it.

Long Chen felt ashamed inside. The ancestral dragon essence blood had given him so much power that he only focused on the dragon race’s divine abilities.

Although the dragon race was powerful, the Nine Star Hegemon Body Art was also a supremely terrifying cultivation technique. Right now, he was still fumbling around blindly with this technique and had already gained so much power.

First, without counting the power of the nine stars, there was also the power of the stars above the heavens. Right now, he was only able to draw in the power of nine hundred and ninety-nine of them. But what kind of power would he have if he drew in nine thousand? What about one hundred and eight thousand?

“Many thanks for the reminder, senior!” Long Chen sincerely expressed his thanks.

The dragon expert said, “Remember, your foundation is the Nine Star Hegemon Body Art, whose power is beyond your imagination. Since you’ve walked down your own new path, once you succeed, its power will definitely be greater than the original.”

Long Chen nodded. “Junior understands. I will continue testing my path of the nine stars.”

“No, there is no rush right now. You’ve just obtained my dragon blood, and it still hasn’t fully merged with you. For the next little while, you should focus on merging with it. Once you can fully retract my dragon blood aura, you will have reached full mastery.”

“Fully retract it? How can I possibly do that?” Long Chen was startled.

Right now, the dragon blood was surging through his body out of his control, causing his Blood Qi to rage like a burning fire. What terrifying level of control would it require to fully retract such a terrifying force?

“You have to make it possible. You have to fully control everything. Otherwise, if the power of your dragon blood is too strong, it will overwhelm you, the host. The power of your nine stars, your astral energy, your thunderforce, your flame energy, and even your pupil arts will all be affected. If it continues for a long period, it will delay your cultivation speed. Right now, you have just entered the Immortal King realm and have merged with my dragon king essence blood. In terms of realm, it is a perfect match. If you cannot control the power of your physical body, your cultivation base will definitely stagnate. In the Dragon King realm, the greater your power, the less dragon blood aura leaks. So, it must be the same in the Immortal King realm. Your essence, qi, and spirit must be balanced in order to advance. Your qi is powerful, and there’s no need to even say anything about your spirit. Thus, you don’t need to cultivate them in the Immortal King realm. You just need to cultivate the power of your physical body.”

“In other words, in my Immortal King realm, all I have to do is merge with the dragon blood energy and that’s it?” Long Chen was pleasantly surprised. If that was the case, it would be much easier. Then he wouldn’t need to consume pills until he wanted to puke.

“As long as you can control the power of my dragon blood, you can essentially skip through the early and mid stages of the Immortal King realm. As for the late stage, you will also require the power of your nine stars. However, at the ninth Heavenstage, you will start needing to merge the power of the nine stars with the dragon blood in order to break through. That will be the most difficult time. It will also be a test as to whether or not you can trailblaze a new path on the way of the nine stars,” said the dragon expert.

Long Chen instantly understood. After the ninth Heavenstage, he would have to condense a new Seven Star Battle Armor. His current Seven Star Battle Armor was only the most basic Seven Star Battle Armor. If he wanted to get stronger, he would have to change it just like how he had changed the Six Star Battle Armor.

“Hehe, then there’s still quite a bit of time. It just so happens that I have something important to do beforehand.” Long Chen instantly thought of Yu Qingxuan’s sweet expression before she left, leaving him smiling excitedly.
