Chapter 4745 Encircling

When countless Lifehunter experts appeared, Long Chen and Bai Zhantang sealed the hole in the barrier, so the others could only attack from other spots.

The existence of the hole dropped the overall defensive power by ninety percent, causing those nine star Doyens to pierce their way through easily.

Just as they appeared, the Dragonblood warriors descended upon them like divine blades from the heavens, their strikes drawing the blood of nine-star Doyens until it soaked the ground. Each swing of their sword was lethal, leaving no need for a second slash.

These hundreds of thousands of nine star Doyens had seemed like an unstoppable tide, but now, they were just like moths that threw themselves into a fire.

“Kill Long Chen!” one of the Sage Kings roared. The ten of them had been going all out but couldn’t break Long Chen’s defenses, which resulted in them being anxious.

Their primary objective was Long Chen, with Luo Bing and Luo Ning as secondary targets. Six of them were tasked with surrounding Long Chen, while the remaining ten were to split up and demolish the High Firmament Academy's buildings. Only the nine star Doyens were assigned to capture Luo Bing and Luo Ning.

However, their plans were disrupted by Bai Zhantang and Long Chen’s unexpected fighting prowess. Even facing ten of them, he was unbeatable. If this situation persisted, the nine star Doyens would soon meet their demise.

BOOM!

Suddenly, Bai Zhantang was sent flying by the six of them. Enraged, he stamped on the ground to rush toward Long Chen. However, as he made his move, the space around him twisted unnaturally.

“Bastards!!!”

Bai Zhantang roared in fury, cursing himself for falling into their trap. These Lifehunter experts had employed an unknown method to set up a spatial trap, effectively snaring him.

“Break!” Bai Zhantang roared. A strange rune then appeared on his forehead as he swung his broadsword down, causing spatial runes to explode.

The twisting space indeed returned to normal. However, Bai Zhantang had been sent out of the academy. In fact, he was almost outside of the academy’s territory.

“Long Chen, hold on! I’m coming!” Bai Zhantang roared and rushed back. Despite his distaste for Long Chen, he was still his future son-in-law. As a result, Bai Zhantang was also anxious to see him in danger.

He cursed his foolishness again, having fallen for such a simple trap. If his two wives were present, they wouldn’t have fallen for it. Thinking of this, he clenched his teeth so hard that they almost shattered.

With sixteen Sage Kings surrounding Long Chen, the pressure on him rose immensely. Evilmoon whistled through the air, unleashing layers of saber-images. However, it couldn’t stop Long Chen’s defensive area from shrinking.

“A group of shameless things. No matter how many of you are here, each of you is nothing more than rabble. If my father could kill you until you ran for your lives, I can kill you until you cry for your parents!”

After that, the Split the Heavens runes on Evilmoon lit up, and an enormous saber-image soared into the heavens.

“Evilmoon Split the Heavens Slash!”

BOOM!

The slash sent the sixteen Sage Kings flying, shocking them all. The colossal saber-image fragmented into sixteen, resembling a blossoming lotus as it slashed at each of them simultaneously.

Long Chen and Evilmoon created this technique based on the nine forms of Split the Heavens. Dubbed the Evilmoon Split the Heavens Slash, it stood as their number one combination technique.

All those sixteen saber-images slashed down at once, sending those Sage Kings flying despite their efforts to block with all their might.

“It’s too bad this technique isn’t perfect yet. Otherwise, not one of them would be alive,” said Evilmoon irritably.

Despite their successful tests, Long Chen and Evilmoon had only ever used half of their power. Now that they unleashed their full might, their lack of control became evident, resulting in immediate flaws.

“Scatter!”

Those sixteen Sage Kings were terrified and immediately vanished into the void.

BANG!

Just then, a golden sphere exploded amongst them. As some kind of golden powder spread through the air, their figures emerged again.

“You think you can start a fight and just run? Is there such a good thing in this world? You can leave, but leave your heads behind first!”

Guo Ran appeared in the air, blocking their path with a multicolored saber in his hand. Beside him stood Xia Chen, Gu Yang, Li Qi, Song Mingyuan, Yue Zifeng, Yu Qingxuan, Bai Shishi, and Bai Xiaole, forming a barrier around the Sage Kings. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“When it comes to sneak attacking someone from the shadows, I have no choice but to admit that you’re the best. However, once you’re exposed, you’re nothing more than rats in the street. Even if you sprout wings, you won’t be able to escape today!” declared Guo Ran.

At this moment, the Dragonblood Legion was slaughtering hundreds of thousands of Lifehunter assassins.

The reason for such an efficient massacre was the berserk state of these nine star Heavenly Doyens. They didn’t fear death and were just charging forward recklessly. As a result, they were slain one by one.

“Blood Soul Ignition!” One of the Sage Kings roared. After that, he murmured a strange incantation, causing his Blood Qi to ignite and his aura to multiply in power.

As Guo Ran had pointed out, while the assassins excelled at sneak attacks, they faltered when faced with direct confrontation. Even with their cooperative skills, they struggled to land a blow on Long Chen.

With the mission already deemed a failure, their survival hung in the balance. So, their only option was to go all out.

One of those Sage Kings charged directly at Guo Ran as he felt that amongst all of them, Guo Ran was the weakest. His instincts decided this for him.

The Sage King was quick as lightning, his sword thrusting into Guo Ran’s chest in an instant. Before his attack struck, even he was stunned. Although he had felt Guo Ran to be weak, he hadn’t thought him to be so weak that he was unable to even dodge his probing blow.

However, just as his sword stabbed into Guo Ran’s chest, his expression changed.
