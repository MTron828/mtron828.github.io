Chapter 2091 No Effect?

Huang Feiyan’s furious shout made the others in the room frown. Just how petty was she?

Everyone wanted treasures, and this was an auction. Why couldn’t others bid on something just because she wanted it? Bidding was courting death? The Xuan Beasts were definitely too big for their britches.

“With shit like you here, why would I need to look for more shit?” Long Chen was also enraged. This girl was too arrogant. Why couldn’t he bid for this? He rarely stooped to the level of women who irritated him, but this Huang Feiyan was too infuriating for him to hold back.

Beitang Rushuang almost spat out her tea after hearing this.

Quite a few people were looking at Huang Feiyan oddly, some of them having a faint smile on their faces. Huang Feiyan took a few seconds to react as she didn’t understand the human language as well as them. However, when she realized what Long Chen had said, she turned ashen with rage. She pointed at Long Chen, about to burst into curses.

“Sit down!”

Peng Kunzi suddenly shouted at her.

Huang Feiyan unwillingly glared at Long Chen, but she swallowed what she was about to say. Clearly, even someone as willful as her had to listen to Kun Pengzi. It could be seen just how grand Kun Pengzi’s status was amongst the Xuan Beasts.

Dongfang Yuyang couldn’t help frowning. He had previously said that he would accompany everyone now and that they were to give him face by not causing any more trouble.

Zhao Wuji and Shi Lingfeng hadn’t provoked Long Chen, but Huang Feiyan seemed to have not heard Dong Yuyang’s statement, irritating him.

However, Dongfang Yuyang also did not want to expel her unless he was forced to. If he casually kicked people out, that wouldn’t be in accordance with the goal of this gathering.

Fortunately, Kun Pengzi was present, suppressing her. Seeing this, everyone realized that Huang Feiyan was even more unreasonable than the stories said. Perhaps only Kun Pengzi could keep her under control.

“Mister Long Chen bids one hundred and five underworld spirit beads. Are there any higher bids? If not, I’ll have to announce-,” said the middle-aged man.

“Two hundred.” Huang Feiyan spat out her bid.

Two hundred underworld spirit beads was an astoundingly high bid. Even though these heavenly geniuses didn’t lack money, this was no small amount.

Even a hundred would not have been worth it for this measly withered root. For her to bid two hundred, perhaps she had gone insane and simply wanted to go against Long Chen.

“Two hundred and five.” Long Chen’s bid calmly came out once more.

Flames almost exploded out of Huang Feiyan. She had already come to the conclusion that Long Chen was going against her. Each time, he was bidding five beads more than her. He was clearly toying with her.

This was no longer a matter of price but a competition of wealth. She refused to believe that someone with no backer could compare to someone like her in terms of wealth. She was about to bid three hundred.

“Give it to him,” said Kun Pengzi indifferently.

“What?!” Huang Feiyan was enraged. Even Kun Pengzi wasn’t letting her continue.

“If you can’t learn to control your emotions, then even a pile of Infinite Eight Bitters Roots wouldn’t help you. External power can only assist you, but cultivation relies on yourself. Do you think a little Infinite Eight Bitters Root can change your fate? That’s a joke. If you could learn to see yourself clearly, that would be even more helpful than ten Infinite Eight Bitters Roots. Refusing to accept a simple setback like this means that you will never be able to step to a higher level. Every person requires setbacks before advancing while constantly strengthening themselves. Of course, some people managed to advance with no setbacks at all. But I’ll tell you this, those people all died without understanding how to stop and take a look at where they were. They just blindly charged forward. What kind of accomplishments could they have?” said Kun Pengzi coldly.

His words were heard clearly by all the experts because Huang Feiyan had shut down the sound formation in order to shout at Long Chen. Everyone quietly nodded. Kun Pengzi was a true expert. Even as a Xuan Beast, he was cool-headed and able to control his own emotions. No wonder the Peng Emperor had chosen him as his heir.

After all, Xuan Beasts were still beasts. They were easy to anger, and their comprehension of the Heavenly Daos was a far cry from humans.

The heavens had given them powerful physical bodies and long longevity, and in exchange, stripped them of their comprehension toward the Heavenly Daos. People said that the heavens were fair. If they gave you something, they would also take something else away.

In the same vein, if they took something from you, they would also quietly give you something. Perhaps that was the true essence of the Heavenly Daos.

Kun Pengzi was calm and steady, truly possessing the mannerisms of an emperor. Huang Feiyan appeared particularly immature in front of him.

“Two hundred and five underworld spirit beads going once.” Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

“Two hundred and five underworld spirit beads going twice”

“Two hundred and five underworld spirit beads going thrice. Congratulations mister Long Chen on obtaining the Infinite Eight Bitters Root,” announced the middle-aged man in charge of the auction.

Long Chen’s lips curled. What congratulations? This thing was trash in other people’s hands. It was only useful to him. If it weren’t for that idiot Huang Feiyan, this thing’s price would not have surpassed fifty underworld spirit beads. However, an auction wasn’t the place to get an advantage.

The second item quickly went up. It was a set of bone armor and was also an ancient relic. There were divine runes on it, but just like the Infinite Eight Bitters Root, it was damaged.

There was no way around that. These things were too old. Many parts were incomplete, and that was the only reason why their owners had been willing to auction them off.

Despite the damage, the bone armor had many rare runes on it, and so there was value in researching it. There was definitely some potential there.

The bone armor drew quite a bit of attention, going from a starting price of thirty underworld spirit beads all the way to one hundred and fifty in no time at all.

In the end, the winning bid was made by Nangong Zuiyue for one hundred and eighty underworld spirit beads. She was particularly fond of these things that had historical value.

“Last time it was a tortoise shell, and this time it’s bone armor. Hehe, if you add some tofu, you can make a delicious stew. Then if I added the Infinite Eight Bitters Root, it would definitely be nourishing,” joked Long Chen.

Nangong Zuiyue smiled. Both times, she had bought bones. For a girl to keep buying such things was truly a bit strange.

Just as the third treasure was put up for auction, the items that Long Chen and Nangong Zuiyue had bought were brought over.

After obtaining the Infinite Eight Bitters Root, Long Chen couldn’t stop his heart from wildly pounding. If it worked, he would profit endlessly. If it didn’t work, those two hundred underworld spirit beads of his would have been for nothing.

Long Chen directly tossed the Infinite Eight Bitters Root into the primal chaos space. He covered it with the life dirt. However, he was disappointed not to see any reaction at all.

Normally, whatever plant he threw in, even if it was just a branch, it would quickly start to revive and grow. However, there was no sign of that from the Endless Eight Bitters Root.

Long Chen sighed inside. It seemed that this Endless Eight Bitters Root had run out of all its vitality. Even the primal chaos space was unable to revive it.

The auction continued. It went without saying that everything being auctioned off was an amazing treasure. Every item was enticing. Long Chen wished he could buy them all, but he didn’t have that much money.

At this time, Long Chen saw what powerful foundations these ancient existences possessed. He had thought that the five hundred underworld spirit beads he had obtained with the Hundred Flower Dao Resonation Pill would make him rich, but now he found that these five hundred underworld spirit beads weren’t that much at all. Many people were bidding over five hundred underworld spirit beads.

For example, Nangong Zuiyue had spent over six hundred underworld spirit beads. Long Chen looked at her directly and asked if the people in her home were all this rich, eliciting a laugh.

“Zhiqiu, do you see anything you want? If you do, just tell me. Although I’m out of money now, I can always borrow some and buy things for you. My two big rich creditors are right here.” Long Chen smiled at Ye Zhiqiu.

Ye Zhiqiu had always been icy, and Long Chen wanted to improve the slightly cold atmosphere of their seat.

“Let me tell you, I’m not lending you any more. I also don’t have that many underworld spirit beads,” warned Beitang Rushuang. This fellow had no money and still offered to buy things for others. He was truly shameless.

“I don’t see anything interesting, but my master gave me three hundred underworld spirit beads this time. Long Chen, you can use them.” Ye Zhiqiu took out a cosmos bag and gave it to Long Chen.

Long Chen was immediately embarrassed. It was just a joke, but Ye Zhiqiu had taken it seriously. Just how could Long Chen take Ye Zhiqiu’s money in front of everyone?

“Ah, I never thought that the great Long Chen would have the potential to be a gigolo!” Beitang Rushuang laughed. After being teased by this slippery fellow for days, she finally found a chance to counterattack.

With Beitang Rushuang saying this, Long Chen really couldn’t accept this cosmos bag. Seeing his embarrassed state, Beitang Rushuang laughed delightedly. Long Chen simply told Ye Zhiqiu to keep it for now, and if there was anything good that appeared, they could combine their underworld spirit beads to buy it. By this point, the prices of the treasures appearing were growing increasingly high.

“A qilin horn! They even have such a thing!” exclaimed Ye Lingshan suddenly. A giant horn had been brought onto the stage. Divine runes still flashed on top of it, and an incredibly ancient aura was emitted. This was definitely not a damaged item.

The appearance of the qilin horn brought intense competition. In the end, it was Huang Feiyan who managed to purchase it for one thousand and eighty underworld spirit beads.

That was the highest bid since the auction had started. Huang Feiyan happily took away the qilin horn. Clearly, it was very useful to her.

“Everyone, the qilin horn was one of the three top treasures of this auction. In other words, there are still two more priceless treasures coming up. Those who haven’t managed to win anything, don’t miss this chance. Here is the next treasure. It is definitely exciting and desirable.”

The middle-aged man pushed open a red curtain on the stage, causing countless startled cries to ring out amongst the crowd.
