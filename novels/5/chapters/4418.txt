Chapter 4407 Dark Dragon Race

BOOM!

Two large hands clashed in midair, resembling shooting stars striking each other. This impact caused the entire world to momentarily flicker between black and white.

In the aftermath of a tremendous explosion of Blood Qi, both of them were propelled backward. Long Chen could feel his Blood Qi violently churning within him.

“The dragon race’s aura. Are you a dragon?” A cold shout resonated from the other side. Long Chen’s presence had clearly shocked him.

“No, you’re not. You’re just a lowly human.”

Thereafter, a surge of qi exploded, distorting the void, and a figure materialized. Clad in black robes with two horns atop his head and scales covering his body, this man looked very intimidating.

He was towering in stature and muscular, with overwhelming Blood Qi. Lightning seemed to streak in his eyes with every blink.

In their first encounter, Long Chen was blown back a great distance, while this man was only knocked back three steps. It seemed that the latter held the upper hand for now.

“Little human, how dare you meddle in my affairs? Do you think absorbing a bit of the dragon race’s essence blood would make you untouchable? Your little bit of dragon power is nothing in my eyes. You must be tired of living,” said that horned expert coldly.

The fact that Long Chen had suddenly appeared and blocked this horned expert’s attack shocked most of the Eternal experts in this area. They struggled to fathom how a human could intercept such a formidable attack. Perhaps others didn’t know, but they were well aware of just how terrifying this horned lifeform was.

“Don’t you think it’s too early to say such a thing?” Long Chen swung out his tingling arm, displaying a peculiar smile. “How unexpected to encounter someone from the dark dragon race here. No wonder you possess such power.”

It was truly unexpected. This horned lifeform’s horns were actually dragon horns, a symbol of supreme power.

However, this dark dragon was not from the dark evil dragon race or the dark barbarian dragon race, as his aura distinctly differed from the palace master’s. Nevertheless, the power he exuded was still astonishing.

For some reason, after that one blow, Long Chen felt his dragon tendons tighten as an immense surge of dragon blood coursed through them. In an instant, Long Chen realized that everything regarding the dragon race was exceptionally prideful, especially his dragon blood, which came from a mysterious dragon expert. The aura of this dark dragon expert was stimulating the latent dragon might within Long Chen.

“Hmm, a true dragon’s essence blood? How interesting. Absorbing your essence blood will be greatly beneficial to me. You really are out of luck today,” sneered the horned lifeform, his mouth forming a sinister smile, revealing a set of sharp teeth.

“Friend of the human race, you aren’t a match for him. You must leave! We don’t know each other, so there’s no need for you to lose your life for nothing,” calmly remarked the woman behind Long Chen, her voice unwavering even in the face of imminent danger.

She knew just how powerful this dark dragon expert was. On this entire battlefield, he stood out as the most powerful expert capable of posing a threat to her life.

In the Esoteric Spirit World, she could kill him with a casual slap, but in this place, her realm was suppressed by the Heavenly Daos, reducing her from a Saint to an Eternal. Moreover, the relentless battles of the past few days had taken a toll on her, leaving her significantly injured.

Hence, when this terrifying fellow appeared, she directly lost hope. All that was left was for her to drag this peerless heavenly genius down with her. Fortunately, Long Chen arrived on time before that happened.

“Saint, master is very powerful. He can definitely help us,” exclaimed Bally as it came up to the Saint, floating in front of her like it would protect her at all costs.

“Senior, leave this fellow to me. Can you handle the rest?” asked Long Chen.

“You have to know, he is…!”

“It’s not important what he is. As long as he’s in the World King realm, he is bound to die at my hands,” said Long Chen indifferently.

The woman’s pupils shrank ever so slightly. Long Chen’s words carried a confidence that made it impossible for her to doubt him.

“Are my wounds so severe that my perception is off?” the woman murmured. Despite the hopelessness that had settled in her heart, Long Chen's presence somehow kindled a flame of hope within her. Her will to fight reignited, albeit gradually.

“Alright. I, Ye Ling, am willing to fight alongside you.”

After saying that, she took a deep breath. The gemstone on her forehead then lit up, and her dispirited aura rapidly recovered.

She had originally been planning on detonating this gemstone to drag down the dark dragon expert with her. But now, she used a gentler method to draw the gemstone’s power out. It seemed that she had put her hopes on Long Chen.

If Long Chen failed, considering that she had exhausted the gemstone’s power, perhaps she wouldn’t even have the power to kill herself when the time came. However, for some reason, she was willing to place all her bets on Long Chen.

“Hahaha!” The dragon expert laughed as if he had just heard the world’s funniest joke. “You think that you can stop me? Well, someone who can’t even receive a single attack from me wishes to fight me, and the foolish woman of the Earth Spirit race is also willing to trust you. Hahaha, has this world gone crazy?”

Despite his laughter, his voice was full of anger. Long Chen’s words had clearly provoked him. Black qi materialized behind him, plunging this world into darkness.

“No, I’m not going to block you. I’m going to kill you,” answered Long Chen.

Long Chen shook his hand a bit more until the numbness was gone. He then added, “Or perhaps the one that wants to kill you isn’t me, but the will of the dragon blood inside me. Sorry, but I can’t let you leave alive today.”

“Hahaha, you really are trying to make me laugh to death!” the dragon expert laughed furiously. Perhaps in all his life, no one had dared to speak to him this way.

“If you were to die laughing, that wouldn’t be a bad way to die. At least, you won’t feel pain and fear. It could count as a kind of release!” said Long Chen solemnly.

Long Chen had only been planning on blocking this person, not killing him. After all, he still didn’t know much about the Earth Spirit race, so he didn’t want to kill people for them.

However, the dragon blood in him began to surge, and the will deep within his soul started to influence him. In a matter of seconds, Long Chen knew that this dark dragon expert very likely harbored a profound grudge against the true dragon race.

Having inherited the dragon expert’s will, Long Chen had also acquired the true dragon race’s enmities. His resolve embodied the will of the dragon expert.

After all, the dragon expert had helped Long Chen immensely, saving his life multiple times and even saving all the lifeforms on the Martial Heaven Continent. Long Chen would not defy its will.

Based on this, Long Chen decided that he had to kill this dark dragon. It was a kind of responsibility for him.

“Ignorant human, you will pay the price for your foolishness. Once I kill you, I’ll exterminate your whole sect and family!” roared the dragon expert.

“It’s not like you’ll have that chance,” remarked Long Chen indifferently.ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

“Die!” the dragon expert roared and prepared to attack.

“Wait a moment!” said Long Chen suddenly.

“What? Regretting now is too late,” sneered the dragon expert. However, it did stop for a moment.

“Bally, help me look after my little sister.”

Long Chen then carefully handed the sleeping Little Crane to Bally.

“Master, don’t worry. I swear that no one will harm young miss,” said Bally as it retreated with Little Crane.

“Alright. Come. Let me see whether your fists are as tough as your mouth.”

After sending off Little Crane, Long Chen turned to the dragon expert. His gaze instantly turned cold.
