Chapter 3924 Divine Dragon Tail Pendulum

Golden light gushed out of Long Chen’s manifestation. Like a sun, its sacred light erupted, blinding the world.

BOOM!

When everyone’s vision was back, they saw the Soul Hooking Terror Devil sent flying by a kick from Long Chen. As for its sickle covered in blue flames, it was in Long Chen’s hand.

Long Chen then threw the sickle directly toward Mo Nian, who caught it with delight. “Hahaha, many thanks!”

“What do you want this thing for?”

“Hehe, you don’t know, do you? With this thing and some other adornments, I can go mess around in hell. Perhaps there are some great tombs in hell as well.” Mo Nian laughed, putting away the sickle with a pleased expression.

Having lost the sickle, the Soul Hooking Terror Devil began to attack Long Chen with its claws.

“Why isn’t it coming to attack you?” wondered Guo Ran. If it was him, he would reclaim his weapon first before doing anything else.

“It doesn’t have high enough intelligence. Furthermore, it was summoned to kill Long Chen by the Nine Underworld Luocha. As she locked its power onto Long Chen, it will only attack Long Chen,” said Mo Nian.

Just as Long Chen unleashed that eruption of light, his manifestation began to quiver, and his power was starting to climb beyond his control.

All of a sudden, a bolt of lightning hacked down from the nine heavens, causing the world to look like a picture scroll that had a giant crack torn into it.

“Careful, careful. It still bursts. Well, whatever. In the past, I was always waiting for other people to unleash their big moves. Today, I’ll unleash mine first. In any case, I’ve done what I promised. I’ve given you all enough time, but if you just keep holding back, there’s nothing else I can do.” Long Chen looked at his own hands. The power coursing through his body was overflowing past the dams.

Crack!

Another bolt of lightning split the sky, enlarging the crack from the first bolt that had yet to heal.

Long Chen’s dragon scales began to quiver, each scale having golden runes flowing within them. As they blazed like tiny golden suns, a violent power slowly rose, causing the void to rumble.

BOOM!

Suddenly, with the collapse of the dam, a flood of power poured out like untameable wild horses.

Bolts of lightning continued to rain down from the sky, rending the heavens asunder. Enormous rifts then materialized in the void, accompanied by some temporal distortions. This display of power was nothing short of terrifying, possessing the might to obliterate the foundations of the world.

Seeing this scene, Long Aotian and Kun Tu could no longer hide their powers.

As Kun Tu raised his wings, the power of cosmos flowed onto them and was absorbed by him. As for Long Aotian, he activated both of his bloodlines, letting his seven-color Supreme Blood and violet blood mix and roar. With two peerless bloodline powers, he was strengthening the Sun Moon Five Element Flag in his left hand and a blood-colored spear in his right hand.

In the process of strengthening them, the void behind Long Aotian collapsed. His wild power could not be contained by this world.

Unfortunately, Mo Nian and the others were behind him. As the world was being torn apart, this tear now stretched toward them. If they didn’t leave, they would also be torn apart.

Even so, there was no need for them to do anything. Cloud simply summoned her true body and brought them away.

As Long Aotian and Kun Tu were accumulating power, heaven and earth were starting to collapse. The scene was hair-raising. Mountains simply crumbled and floated into the sky, while Grand Dao runes appeared all over the place. They were simply milling around chaotically, as if the laws of the world were lost.

The lifeforms of the three thousand worlds were terrified, not knowing what was going on. They could only watch in terror as cracks spread across their sky.

Through those cracks, they could see countless spatial blades spinning. Those cracks were akin to the mouths of devils smiling sinisterly at them, looking like they might be devoured at any time.

In the core of the battlefield, Long Chen’s entire body was shining, a violent aura gushing out of him explosively. However, that overflowing power made Long Chen roar painfully. He felt like his body was on the verge of exploding.

“Kunpeng Heaven Shattering Slash!”

With a furious roar, Kun Tu unleashed a sweeping arc with his heaven-shrouding wings. It was like a river of stars was contained within his wings as they fell from the starry sky.

“Dual Blood Overturns the Cosmos!”

As Long Aotian stabbed both of his weapons forward, the power of his seven-color Supreme Blood and violet blood were unleashed to their limits. In an instant, his Blood Qi covered the sky, and the power of the ten thousand Daos was sucked up by him.

One unleashed the greatest physical power, while the other displayed the greatest bloodline power. With both of them unleashing all their might, it was as if the nine heavens would be devoured by them.

“Divine Dragon Tail Pendulum!”

In response, Long Chen spread his hands and made a seal with both of them. His left leg was the axis, while his right leg swung like a whirlwind.

Just as Long Chen’s leg began to spin, his manifestation vanished, replaced by an enormous dragon tail that followed the spinning of his leg like a long whip.

The golden dragon tail then swung out with an ear-piercing explosive sound, crashing against the two incoming attacks.Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

BOOM!

The order of heaven and earth was dealt a devastating blow, and it tore the entire world into two. Both parts then grew further and further away.

After heaven and earth were torn apart, wild astral winds unfurled in every direction. The rumbling sound was so powerful that it made people feel like their souls would flee.

“Heaven Lock Earth Seal!”

“Original Devil Shield!”

“Golden Metal Shield!”

Meng Qi, Yue Xiaoqian, Bai Shishi, Li Qi, Song Mingyuan, Cloud, Little Snow, and others that specialized in defense summoned their greatest barriers. They had long since been prepared.

Mo Nian also took out another coffin and put everyone inside. However, in front of this apocalyptic attack, all of these defenses were rendered useless.

As Mo Nian’s coffin was torn apart by terrifying astral winds, they were all blown away in a wild tempest.

But in the end, it was Mo Nian’s coffin that was the most helpful. Although they were blown away, they weren’t injured.

Everyone hastily stabilized themselves. Looking around, they were shocked to find that the world had changed. The core of the battlefield was a giant black gulch that split the world in two. They could also hear heaven and earth wailing as if suffering from immense pain.

Right now, Long Aotian and Kun Tu were covered in blood. Their bodies were almost crushed by this kick from Long Chen. As for that terror devil from hell, it was gone. Having lost its divine weapon, it was unable to block this attack and was wiped out of existence.

On the other hand, Long Chen wasn’t much better off. Golden blood dripped down his body, and his face was a bit pale. This had truly been a world-destroying exchange, with all three of them having unleashed their strongest attacks.

“I learned three of the dragon race’s divine abilities. The first is Dragon Roars at the Nine Heavens, the second is Divine Dragon Tail Pendulum, and this is the third.”

Long Chen took a deep breath. His manifestation then appeared once again as his hands took the form of claws.

Two heaven-shrouding dragon claws materialized above the nine heavens. As they appeared, the stars quivered. They instantly locked onto Long Aotian and Kun Tu.

“Cloud Dragon Immolation Claw!”

BOOM!

The dragon claws reached down, tearing through the river of stars.
