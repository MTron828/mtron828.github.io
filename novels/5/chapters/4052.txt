Chapter 4041 A Curse that Shakes the Heavens

The lightning needle pierced through Dongfang Zichu’s Yuan Spirit, causing him to scream so miserably. Even a three-flower Earth Venerate would wail in pain if their Yuan Spirit was pierced.

Pain was the fairest thing in this world. It didn’t matter what your status, realm, or power was. In front of pain, no falsehoods could be made; they were all stripped away.

A three-flower Earth Venerate’s pain tolerance might not be greater than an ordinary cultivator. As he screamed in pain, the dignity of an expert was silently trampled.

“When a man is about to die, they talk softly, when a bird is about to die, they cry out mournfully? Well then go ahead and scream as much as you please.”

Long Chen’s expression was frightening. He was clenching his teeth, and veins bulged on his forehead. As for his eyes, they were full of icy killing intent.Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Another lightning needle pierced Dongfang Zichu’s Yuan Spirit. Having endured the harrowing process of soul refinement, Long Chen gained firsthand knowledge of the most excruciating form of torture possible: tormenting the Yuan Spirit.

“AH!” Dongfang Zichu’s Yuan Spirit quivered and screamed. He was suffering through unimaginable pain at this moment.

“Why must you force me?”

STAB!

“If you want to kill me, why didn’t you come at me? Why did you have to target Qingxuan?!”

STAB!

“If you want to harm me, then fine. But you cannot harm the woman I love.”

STAB!

“You harmed my woman, turning me into a devil. None of you will ever reincarnate again.”

STAB!

Long Chen repeatedly stabbed Dongfang Zichu’s Yuan Spirit with a lightning needle. Dongfang Zichu repeatedly screamed like he was in hell. But he had no ability to resist.

“Didn’t you say that you had an undying body? I don’t believe in that kind of witchcraft. These lightning needles contain my will.”

Long Chen clenched his teeth. He suddenly bit his finger, causing blood to flow. After that, he marked Dongfang Zichu’s forehead.

“I, Long Chen, swear my oath! All gods and devils hear me! All ten thousand Daos of the universe be the witness! Using my blood, I seal Dongfang Zichu! Starting now, heaven and earth cannot contain him! The Six Daos cannot reincarnate him! The three worlds cannot accept him! He is to suffer the pain of lightning devouring his soul night and day. As long as I, Long Chen, do not die, the soul devouring cannot stop. If any one of you dares to defy me, when I rule this world, heaven and earth will collapse, the Six Daos will crumble, and the three worlds will be overturned!”

When he swore his oath, rumbling rang throughout the world, causing heaven and earth to quiver. Each of his words seemed to be branded into the laws of heaven and earth. In that instant, heaven and earth submitted, and the ten thousand Daos obeyed.

“His will has exceeded the laws of the Heavenly Daos, to the point that he can change the laws with just words?! Just who is he?!”

Within the darkness, a pair of beautiful concealed eyes finally showed a trace of shock.

Following Long Chen’s roar, a crack appeared in heaven and earth. After that, Long Chen released Dongfang Zichu.

“No! Lord Brahma, save me!”

However, no one answered him. Dongfang Zichu was dragged into the darkness by an invisible force, and it shrank until the world sealed itself once more. Dongfang Zichu was gone.

Everyone knew that Dongfang Zichu was done for. He would not die and would be tortured for eternity. From this moment on, he could no longer exist within heaven and earth, the Six Daos, and the three worlds.

All he could do was suffer through the cracks between the three worlds as lightning ravaged his soul. Even if he wanted to die, he could not die.

As long as Long Chen didn’t die, he would suffer. This curse was truly terrifying. When people thought of Dongfang Zichu’s fate, they got goosebumps.

Within the capital, everyone was stunned. They were holding off the Yan Xu Gate’s invasion, so they saw everything clearly.

Long Chen was absolutely terrifying. After going through the trial by fire with him, Zhu Yifeng, Zhu Yunwen, Yu Qianxue, and the others thought that they had gained a certain level of understanding over Long Chen’s power. But now, they found that they didn’t understand him in the slightest.

With a single oath, Long Chen made heaven and earth submit? The ten thousand Daos grew subservient? It was like an imperial edict, shaking the world with his words alone. That left them completely dumbfounded. Was this really the Long Chen they knew?

Yu Qingxuan’s eyes were full of tears as she stared at the ferocious Long Chen who appeared to be a devil. At this moment, she felt no fear, only warmth.

Long Chen had previously told her that for her, he would be willing to become a devil to fight this world.

Long Chen had said it, and he had done it. To be loved by a man so deeply that he viewed her life as above his own, that was a love that no woman could resist.

Yu Qingxuan’s tears rolled down her face. She then looked from the Yan Xu Gate to the deathly hell gate. Now, she knew that she did not want to die.

Just then, Long Chen’s Kunpeng wings flapped. He actually shot toward the Yan Xu Gate.

BOOM!

All of a sudden, the Yan Xu Gate opened and a black hand reached toward Yu Qingxuan.

When it appeared, an overwhelming divine pressure shook the land, causing the capital to actually begin to sink. The barrier also became covered in countless cracks.

As a result, the experts inside the capital were horrified. At this moment, Long Chen reached the Yan Xu Gate and unleashed his remaining power. Before the Dragon King Battle Armor fully faded, he would destroy the Yan Xu Gate.

BOOM!

However, his enormous saber-image directly crumbled, the backlash causing him to hack up blood, almost dying. As for the hand, it was completely undamaged.

“That’s… a Heaven Venerate’s power!”

Yu Xiaoyun and the others despaired. This hand possessed the aura of a Heaven Venerate, the strongest existence within the Divine Venerate realm.

Mortal Venerate, Earth Venerate, and Heaven Venerate. Although they were all in the Divine Venerate realm, the difference between each level was as immense as heaven and earth. Those beneath the Heaven Venerate realm were ants. To put it simply, even a hundred thousand Earth Venerates could not resist a single Heaven Venerate.

As the giant hand slowly fell, the barrier cracked more and more, looking like it might shatter at any moment.

Yu Xiaoyun, Jiang Huixin, Xu Lanxin, and the others were bitterly enduring, but they were already pale. It seemed like they had reached their limit. Once this barrier was broken, they would at least be severely wounded, if not dead from the backlash. But they refused to give up.

Yu Xiaoyun looked over everyone who was bitterly enduring, then he looked at Long Chen in the distance. Despite being badly injured, Long Chen charged back at that hand. He was like an ant trying to fight back against the hand of the heavens. His figure appeared so small and alone.

Yu Qingxuan suddenly cried out, “Stop! Mom, dad… Thank you all. Thank you for bringing me into this world. Thanks for letting me experience this world’s beauty. Long Chen, thank you for everything that you have done for me. But you can stop now. If there is a next life, I am willing to be your wife and spend a lifetime with you to thank you for the kindness you have shown me.”

Yu Qingxuan fully gave up when she saw all the people that she cared about fighting to the death for her. She loved this world, and she loved everyone here. So, she was willing to die rather than have them all sacrifice their lives for nothing.

“I already said that as long as I am here, no one can hurt you! Trust me!”

Long Chen’s furious roar rang out. Although he was covered in blood, his gaze was still determined. He then put away his saber and formed hand seals. Just like a moth throwing itself into the fire, he charged toward the Yan Xu Gate.

Buzz.

Suddenly, a golden light lit up in front of Long Chen’s forehead, and a golden lotus seed appeared in front of him.

Long Chen was overjoyed. He had finally managed to summon this lotus seed. Just like that, Long Chen smashed the golden lotus seed at the Yan Xu Gate and the hand.
