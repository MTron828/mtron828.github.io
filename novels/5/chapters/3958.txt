Chapter 3947 Helping a Dog Eat Crap

The Vermilion Bird Empire boasted the Philosopher Institute as its highest institute of learning, serving as a pinnacle of intellect pursuit. Within the institute, the disciples were categorized into different ranks based on their academic achievement and dedication.

The initial two ranks were attainable through completing some examinations. However, formal scholars needed to seek out and establish a mentor-disciple relationship with a master from within the institute. Only by gaining the trust and willingness of a master would they be considered official members of the Philosopher Institute.

It was a bit similar to the inheritances of the martial path, but not quite the same. Within the Philosopher Institute, every master had their own specialties. After formally accepting a master, there were three degrees to gain through one’s studies, and each degree came with its own rank. But above these three degrees was the highest level of learning, the Hanlin degree. Those who passed the Hanlin exams were considered Hanlin scholars.

Hanlin scholars were of such high status that they were seated on the same level as princes and princesses. As for the actual Philosophers of the Philosopher Institute, their status was even higher. When meeting the emperor, they didn’t even need to kowtow.

A Hanlin scholar possessed such learning that countless students looked up to them, and this pudgy scholar before Long Chen was exactly a new Hanlin scholar that was just promoted this year.

He was barely thirty years old but had gained such a noble academic degree. Thus, it could be said that he had reached the peak of his life, having a limitless future before him.

Wherever he went, he would be followed by a crowd, being the center of attention. He really liked this feeling. It was as if this was his essence of existence.Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

However, today, he felt very unnatural. As the Zither Sect’s disciples were playing, he was seated with many others and could no longer find that feeling of being a crane amongst birds.

In fact, from the start, he hadn’t even had a chance to show off at all. The Zither Sect’s beautiful women didn’t even look at him.

The Zither Sect’s disciples were all like heavenly fairies. Most importantly, they possessed a grand air about them. They were rather aloof, but that wasn’t targeted toward him, so while he wasn’t happy about it, he could accept it.

However, when Liao Yuhuang grabbed Long Chen’s hand in front of so many people, that set countless hearts ablaze with jealousy. For someone as arrogant as this scholar, it was unbearable.

He was looking down on cultivators, viewing them as coarse people who could only use their fists, with mouths dumber than feet. But unexpectedly, Long Chen was able to infuriate him with just a few words.

With his fury set ablaze, his head was no longer so nimble, so he was unable to find words to counterattack. The more he tried to think of something, the more blank his head became.

In his panic, he directly stood and pointed at Long Chen, shouting, “Who do you think you are?! What qualifications do you have to debate with a Hanlin scholar like myself?!”

This furious display caused countless people to look at him oddly. Was this really a Hanlin scholar? Why was he cursing like an uncouth fellow then?

Long Chen’s lips curled. He shook his head. “I wonder, was your Hanlin degree obtained through some certain means that cannot see the light of day? How are you so lacking? Seeing myself stand out and discuss music theory with the fairies of the Zither Sect, you are so jealous that you wish to discuss how crude martial arts are. Then when I want to discuss that with you, you instead switch to wanting to talk reason. Then when I try to talk reason with you, you talk about status and position. What? Does talking require qualifications?”

After cursing, the scholar's turbulent mind gradually cleared, and he realized the folly of his outburst. It was only due to his jealousy that he had said such an incoherent thing. However, regretting it was useless now. Since he had said it, he couldn’t take it back.

He thickened his face and said, “Of course. The Vermilion Bird Empire’s emperor is a noble existence. Can any random person be qualified to speak to his majesty?”

Now that he had gotten here, if he were to admit that he had misspoken, that would be a slap in his own face. Hence, he naturally refused to admit he had made a mistake. Other than that, he also wanted to test Long Chen’s foundation. If he had a chance, he would turn things around.

“That really is interesting. Didn’t you say that martial force was unable to resolve problems, and that people needed to talk reason? Now, you throw out something about status. In other words, if my status was lower than yours, I wouldn’t even be qualified to speak to you. Then how would we talk reason?” asked Long Chen lightly.

“I…” The scholar was instantly dumbfounded. He had dug a hole and then jumped into it himself.

“Thus, talking reason is something limited. It can only be done when there are binding forces between sides that are equally matched in power. For example, you are only able to act so arrogantly under the protection of the Vermilion Bird Empire’s imperial laws. If you were to leave the empire, then considering your lack of power and arrogance, I guarantee that you wouldn’t live for longer than a day,” continued Long Chen.

What kind of dogshit was this Hanlin scholar? He lacked any ability and still dared to act like a big shot. Could it be that he was a fake?

“You are spouting nonsense! Your reasoning is completely fallacious! Within the laws of heaven and earth, within the Dao of all things, when all spirits respect each other, there would no longer be differences between weaker or stronger!” raged the scholar.

Long Chen slowly extended his hand and lazily said, “I can’t be bothered to move. Can you bring your face here and hit it against my hand? Thank you for your cooperation!”

As a result, a burst of booming laughter rang out. One reason was because Long Chen’s way of speaking was interesting, but the other reason was because the scholar had truly slapped himself in the face.

After Long Chen had grasped the opening in his words, this scholar should have never continued sticking to that argument. The more he did, the more holes appeared in his argument. This person was truly foolish.

Long Chen could no longer be bothered to even argue with him. After grabbing the opening the scholar revealed, he was completely crushed.

Everyone’s laughter instantly made the scholar realize that he had slapped himself in the face once again. Now, there was nothing he could do to get out of this predicament. His face twitched with fury, but he didn’t know what to do, causing him to sweat a lot.

That miserable appearance of his was extremely satisfactory to the cultivators. Thus, they felt great admiration for Long Chen. His words didn’t have anything sophisticated to them, but he was able to leave the other side speechless and unable to retaliate.

“A frog at the bottom of a well cannot speak of the sea. A summer bug cannot speak of winter. Your hands are soaked in blood, and it’s unknown just how many lifeforms you’ve killed. What qualifications do you have to talk reason with us?” Another scholar stood up and challenged Long Chen.

This person was helping the first scholar out of his predicament. After all, which cultivator could avoid killing others? This person’s words were sharp and struck right at the source of the problem.

“Oh, so someone’s coming out to help the dog eat crap. Do you want to argue? Alright, then Boss Long San will have a nice chat with you today.”

At this moment, Long Chen threw caution to the wind, no longer planning on being low-key in the Vermilion Bird Empire. So, they wanted to play? He would gladly accompany them.

As a result, Long Chen directly jumped onto the stage and took out the chair of a grandmaster, making a show of sitting on it arrogantly. Looking down at the scholars below the stage, he said, “I can see now. I’m not suited to being low-key. Fine, I won’t make any plans for my marriage. I’ll just charge in with my eyes closed. Let’s see who’s afraid of who later!”
