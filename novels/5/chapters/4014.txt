Chapter 4003 Trial by Fire Battleground

“What does it mean for my dragon blood to produce cores?” asked Long Chen.

Long Chen’s dragon blood was originally filled with runes. But now, those runes had condensed into what appeared to be tiny little eggs.RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

“There’s no need for you to know yet. Anyway, your current condition is very good, even better than I expected. Keep going with this refinement, and it will quicken the pace. After condensing these cores, your room for growth has once more risen explosively. Don’t waste your time,” said the dragon expert.

Long Chen found that after these cores condensed, the terrifying pressure no longer felt so terrible. Long Chen then began to cultivate on the tenth step.

Once his essence blood was refined to the limit once more, Long Chen began to practice his punches and kicks. When his qi and bones were also refined, the golden runes in them also became golden cores.

When all three were refined to their limit, he became completely used to the pressure on the tenth step. He could even walk through the air once more. This forbidden flying space was no longer able to restrain him.

With the blood, qi, and bones strengthened, he started refining his Yuan Spirit once more. It was weird though. His Yuan Spirit was changing, but he was unable to sense it strengthening, which worried him somewhat.

“Senior, what is going on with my Yuan Spirit?” Long Chen was unable to keep himself from asking.

“Just keep refining. When the time comes, I will naturally tell you,” said the dragon expert indifferently.

Feeling helpless, Long Chen could only continue cultivating blindly. To his surprise though, when his Yuan Spirit refinement was complete, Zhu Yunwen and the others started to attempt climbing the tenth step.

Long Chen watched as they worked together to climb the tenth step. He didn’t help.

He knew that this final step was a trial for their cooperation. They had to be able to work together perfectly, to trust each other, to be able to support each other at a moment’s notice.

Long Chen suddenly understood why, despite the intense competition between the princes and princesses, there was no resentment among them, and no one resorted to underhanded tricks.

This trial by fire was a way to maintain their unity as believers of the Vermilion Bird. This trial was also a test of their feelings. Under the support of their faith energy, the imperial family’s bloodline was fully protected. From start to finish, they were one solid block.

When Zhu Yunwen and the others saw Long Chen standing steadily on the tenth step, they were shocked, but it was also the greatest encouragement for them.

If Long Chen could stand on it by himself, there was no excuse for them to not get up as well. At this moment, they no longer knew the meaning of the word fear as they charged up together.

They repeatedly failed. With every attempt, they were blown back. Their formation was thrown into chaos, and people coughed up blood.

With every failure, Long Chen would punch the void, causing a huge ripple that tore apart the terrifying pressure. This way, they were at most injured and were at no risk of dying.

Without that danger, they had no more misgivings. They repeatedly tried multiple formations to distribute the pressure.

With Long Chen present, their morale was high, so they continuously tried to climb up. As for Long Chen, he was facing off against all the pressure alone. His power was also constantly growing.

A day later, they finally managed to climb onto the tenth step. The moment they managed to do so, the Vermilion Bird in their manifestations soared into the heavens, forming one giant bird.

That giant bird was the combined body of all their manifestations, and it unleashed a sacred light upon them all. Immersed within that light, a trace of that sacred aura also appeared on Yu Qingxuan and the others’ bodies.

“It’s the Vermilion Bird Divine Blessing! It’s a repayment of our faith energy! We have actually received the blessing of the Vermilion Bird! Imperial father, we succeeded!” Zhu Yunwen and the others cried out emotionally.

Long Chen didn’t know what this repayment of faith energy was, but when this divine light shone on them, he sensed sacred energy entering their bodies, causing their auras to change.

Just then, the huge gate in front of them slowly opened. Long Chen and the others exchanged a glance.

“Let’s go.”

When Long Chen stepped forward, Zhu Yunwen and the others also followed without waiting to investigate how they had exactly changed.

“Kill!”

When they stepped through the gate, they heard roaring, and Long Chen was startled.

“The devil race!”

BOOM!

Long Chen then unleashed a punch that shattered the surrounding space. As a result, countless devil experts were blown apart, but not a single drop of blood appeared.

“It’s a simulation of a battlefield!”

Only then did Long Chen realize that these devil experts were replicated by a formation. They didn’t actually have bodies of flesh and blood.

At this moment, Zhu Yunwen, Yu Qianxue, and the others also saw the situation here. Yu Qingxuan said, “It’s a battlefield trial by fire.”

Suddenly, they saw blood. One of the imperial disciples was struck by a spear from a devil expert, and it pierced straight through his shoulder.

“No, the devil experts are truly from the devil race! Everyone, be careful! You can easily lose your life here!” Long Chen’s divine sense swept through the battlefield and he instantly noticed quite a few Blood Qi fluctuations.

“This trial by fire is a battleground! Battle is how you fight for the right to survive! If you are careless, you really will die here! Warriors of the Vermilion Bird Empire, we are no longer children hiding under the wing of our imperial father! This trial by fire is a rehearsal for when we step onto a true battlefield! Slaughter them!” shouted Zhu Yunwen.

“Kill!”

The imperial disciples unleashed furious roars and began attacking, not caring whether the devils were real or illusions. They treated each and every devil as if it posed a genuine threat, determined to eliminate them all.

Also, these devil experts were not weaklings. All of them had combat experience, and although they were in the Immortal King realm, their power was not weak. If they were underestimated, these disciples really might be killed by them.

“Brother Long, this place doesn’t suit you. Why don’t you go onward? We’ll follow from the rear,” said Zhu Yunwen.

Although their powers had crazily grown during this time, they all knew that Long Chen was growing even faster than them. Thus, Long Chen would purely be wasting his time here. It would be better for him to scout ahead. It would save time and help them prepare for the next danger.

Long Chen nodded, and after imploring Yu Qingxuan and the others to be careful, he set off alone. There was another step up ahead, but this step was a thousand miles away. When he stepped onto it, he saw that the devils on the battlefield were a bit stronger and more numerous than before.

However, it was only a slight difference. With Long Chen’s current power, he blasted apart the enemies with a single punch. That wasn’t even his full power, but he already blasted a path straight through them.

Long Chen quickly reached the tenth step. The devil experts here had gone from the initial Immortal King realm to the peak of the Immortal King realm. However, they still weren’t enough to pose a problem for Long Chen.

Long Chen arrived in front of the gate and didn’t waste any time, directly passing through it. On the other side of the gate, a cold devil qi poured upon him.

“World Kings?”
