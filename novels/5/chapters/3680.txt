Chapter 3669

When the spatial gate opened, Long Chen’s group of three along with the other assassins from the first batch of the trial silently walked over to it.

Once they were all through, the spatial gate shut behind them. All of them vanished.

“Eh? Something seems off with the lightning pool?”

The elder in charge of activating the Star Peering Heavenly Mirror Trial suddenly found that the aura of the lightning pool was a bit different from before.

When he got close, his expression suddenly changed. The lightning pool was already dry. The sight on the surface was actually a kind of illusion.

But then, the disciples were still unconscious, just floating in the air. They had no idea what was happening.

“Wake up!” shouted the elder.

Following this roar, those assassins were startled awake.

Just as they woke up, their bodies instantly exploded. Over eight thousand disciples bizarrely self-detonated.

“What is going on?!” The elder cried out, horrified.

Just then, the towering pillar that stood at the core of the lightning sea shattered. Countless cracks covered it. In front of that elder’s appalled gaze, it crumbled and collapsed.

“Quick, inform island master Chen Ming! Something major has happened!”

…

Long Chen didn’t even have time to look at his surroundings before he felt a gust of wind. A fist smashed toward him, and the immense power was so oppressive that he couldn’t breathe.

BOOM!

Long Chen also unleashed a punch. A large man then appeared in front of Long Chen.

This man was tall and muscular with arms thicker than a normal person’s leg. He had long hair and a square face, and his eyebrows were thick and sharp. However, his gaze was lightless.

His qi was like a wild lion. At this moment, battle intent overflowed out of him, and his Blood Qi was like an erupting volcano. With a roar, another fist smashed toward Long Chen.

BOOM!

Long Chen sighed inside. This was also a nine star heir. Regretfully, he had long since died, and his physical body was turned into a puppet. Even though he was dead, his battle intent had not extinguished yet.

They had another fierce clash. However, this attack was clearly several times stronger than the first. After this blow, that nine star heir roared and six stars appeared behind him, forming a hexagon. His aura then grew explosively by dozens of times.

Clearly, everything was under the control of the Nine Underworld Hall. The first two attacks restricted the power of the nine star heirs, giving the Nine Underworld Hall’s assassins time to get used to their power.

Otherwise, if this nine star heir instantly summoned the Six Star Battle Armor, these assassins would mostly be killed right at the start.

Long Chen raised a hand to block the incoming fist. After that, a seven-colored divine ring appeared behind him.

This time, there was no heaven-shaking explosion. That nine star heir’s power simply flowed into Long Chen’s body, and a bridge formed between them. They were capable of sharing their power.

At this moment, that nine star heir’s body quivered. His listless eyes lit up ever so slightly.

“You are also a nine star heir?”

His voice was rough and almost unintelligible. However, as a fellow nine star heir, Long Chen was able to understand him.

Long Chen nodded. That nine star heir’s face then twitched a few times. It seemed that he wanted to smile, but his face was too stiff to do so.

“Good, very good! Avenge us.”

Although he had been turned into a puppet, his battle will had not extinguished. The Nine Underworld Hall had intentionally preserved this battle intent in order to perpetuate a flexible fighting force.

To do this, they must preserve at least the slightest consciousness of the puppet. Because of this, the nine star heir also knew that he was already dead. He couldn’t control his body. All he could do was slay the Nine Underworld Hall’s disciples that came to this trial.

This was a huge humiliation to the proud nine star heirs, but he was powerless to change things. This pain was something that perhaps only Long Chen, a fellow nine star heir, could understand.

“Brother, go in peace. Leave everything to me!” Long Chen nodded solemnly.

A hint of gratification then appeared in that nine star heir’s eyes. The next moment, his battle will extinguished and his body slowly fell. This man that had been enslaved for countless years finally rested.

When his body fell, it gradually turned into dust, eventually vanishing without a trace.

…

Chen Ming arrived in front of the lightning sea. When he saw that it was dry and the pillar was destroyed, he was dumbfounded. He had lived for countless years but had never seen such a thing before.

“Look at the Star Peering Heavenly Mirror!”

Chen Ming hastily took out a formation disc, and images appeared on it. It was the image of Long Chen and the others entering the Star Peering Heavenly Mirror. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

However, following that, a scene that he didn’t dare to believe appeared. The two disciples that Liao Bencang had told him to keep an eye on, Long Chen and Guo Ran, suddenly vanished from the sight of his formation disc. He was unable to see the situation inside the Star Peering Heavenly Mirror.

A bad feeling suddenly rose within Chen Ming. He then saw a sight that gave him chills. All the disciples that entered the Star Peering Heavenly Mirror had just encountered the nine star heir puppets when their bodies suddenly exploded. They were wiped out.

“Quick! Inform the palace master! Lock down the Star Peering Heavenly Mirror Trial!” shouted Chen Ming in horror. The entire Nine Underworld Island was thrown into chaos. An ear-piercing alarm screeched throughout every corner of the island.

…

BOOM!

A talisman in Long Chen’s hand exploded. The Star Peering Heavenly Mirror tried to transport him out, but this talisman stopped it. Long Chen then appeared in front of a giant mirror.

This giant mirror was floating within space. The stars appeared incredibly miniscule in front of it.

Standing before it, Long Chen saw nine giant star clusters and seas of stars below the clusters.

The nine star clusters were the nine heavens, and at the core of the nine star clusters was a black area. He could vaguely see something, but he was unable to see it clearly.

Below the nine heavens were the star seas. He could see a mysterious layer of mist separating them. That mist was the wall of ascension, the wall which separated the immortal world and the mortal world.

Through the Star Peering Heavenly Mirror, Long Chen saw the mortal world’s stars had chains binding them.

Those chains were spread everywhere. Only a very small portion of star-fields didn’t have those chains. At the end of those chains was the dark area at the heart of the nine heavens.

When he looked at the edges, Long Chen’s heart suddenly pounded wildly. At the edge of the universe were four giant figures. They seemed to be slumbering beasts.

Moreover, behind them was endless darkness. That darkness seemed to also be concealing something.

In that instant, the fearless Long Chen felt terror wash over him. His hair stood on end, and sweat soaked his clothes. Long Chen felt like he was seeing something taboo about the world. It was as if something terrifying within that darkness was looking back at him.

His heart had never pounded so hard. His soul ached with pain. It felt like needles were stabbing his eyes, and fresh blood poured out of them. He knew that he was looking at something he shouldn’t see. But he continued to look. He wanted to know what was at the core of the nine heavens.

Suddenly, the Star Peering Heavenly Mirror quivered. An immense force of rejection tried to send Long Chen out. As a result, his expression changed. He was out of time.

Long Chen clenched his teeth and stabbed the black dagger into the Star Peering Heavenly Mirror.
