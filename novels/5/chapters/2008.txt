A small group of Life Star disciples walked in. They weren’t from the Xuan Beasts. They were humans.

They put on a domineering front, but the fear in their eyes could be seen by everybody. When they saw Long Chen, their bodies involuntarily quivered.

As for why their voices had sounded very strange before, it was because they had tried to sound disdainful, but their voices shuddered, making it sound odd.

“We... represent the Xuan Beasts in sending a gift... are you not going to greet us?!” said the lead disciple.

“Don’t recite the script that they gave you to put your life in danger. I don’t know if I should praise your bravery or curse you for your stupidity,” interrupted Long Chen.

He didn’t know if these people had been forced here or had been bought, but based on their fear, they didn’t want to be here. However, they had still come, so their gift couldn’t be anything good.

“Bring out your gift,” said Long Chen indifferently.

That person hastily took out a case and handed it over. The Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow race’s experts came forward. When they opened it, their killing intent soared.

“Courting death!”

One of those experts was about to kill these people but was stopped by Que Yuzhu.

Looking inside the case, they saw heads. They were the heads of the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow race. They belonged to the experts that had been hunted down during the Xuan Beasts’ cooperation with Heavenly Fate Island.

Now that the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow race was establishing their territory, they sent over those heads. It was clearly a contemptuous insult.

“Did the Xuan Beasts demand you to tell us anything?” asked Que Yuzhu. As the leader, she had to remain calm and not be so easy to anger.

The Xuan Beasts were being clear. Even if the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow race had found support, they would not let them off.

They had sent heads without attacking this time, but next time, when they did attack, they would cut off all their heads.

“They didn’t give us anything to say, but they did order us to say things that would anger you. Sorry, we have no choice. If we didn’t do it, our wives, children, and elders would be killed!” said one courageous disciple suddenly.

As expected, they had been forced. This was why they had sent humans. If they had sent Xuan Beasts, they wouldn’t be able to return. They were just scapegoats.

Long Chen suddenly had a thought. “What sect are you from?”

“We are disciples of the Sea Spirit Gate,” said that disciple respectfully. Although they were terrified of Long Chen, they also revered him.

“I understand. You were in the first group of sects to join Pill Valley’s side. Your sect is too weak. In the eyes of your so-called sect, you’re expendable cannon fodder. It should be the Xuan Beasts that caused your sect to send you out to your deaths. In truth, the wrong ones aren’t you but your sect’s higher-ups. For your family, you were willing to come despite the danger. That means all of you are real men. There’s no need for you to go back if you don’t wish to. You can report directly to the Martial Heaven Alliance’s fourth commander. As for your families, they will receive the Martial Heaven Alliance’s protection, and your original sect won’t dare to touch a single hair on their heads, or they’ll be asking to be exterminated,” said Long Chen.

Those disciples were delighted by Long Chen’s words. Some of them even wept. Long Chen had not just resolved the danger to their families, but he was even giving them the honor of being the disciples of the Martial Heaven Alliance. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

The disciples wept and knelt, expressing their thanks. Long Chen waved his hand, bringing them up. “Hot-blooded men should only kneel to their parents. Don’t submit even to heaven and earth. When you get used to submitting, it will silently erode the sharpness of your Dao-heart. I’ve given you this chance, but as for your futures, it’ll be up to yourselves,” said Long Chen.

The disciples thanked him, bowed deeply to Qu Jianying, and then took their leave, going straight for the headquarters of the Martial Heaven Alliance.

“Smart.” Li Tianxuan smiled and praised Long Chen.

“Xuan Master overpraises this little one,” chortled Long Chen.

“What’s going on?” asked Qu Jianying. That smile between Long Chen and Li Tianxuan was not ordinary.

Li Tianxuan said, “This move of Long Chen’s was very smart. Once those disciples join the Martial Heaven Alliance, it will cause a chain reaction. Of the sects that have betrayed the Martial Heaven Alliance and those that are just standing by the sidelines, countless disciples within them are dissatisfied by their decisions. However, they’re just disciples without any authority. They can’t change the decisions of the higher-ups. We refused the sects from joining our ranks because we don’t want those scheming old fellows. They’re too selfish and care only about themselves. But their disciples are different. It is the current junior generations of this world that are the main characters of this era. We don’t want those scheming old fellows, but the disciples have immense potential. As long as we can draw them over, they will become powerful warriors. When news of those disciples being accepted into the Martial Heaven Alliance spreads, it will cause more and more disciples to follow in their footsteps. In the end, we’ll have the genius disciples while leaving Pill Valley with the useless scheming elders.”

Through this explanation, Qu Jianying and the others came to a sudden understanding. It was no wonder Long Chen had so directly refused to allow those sects to join them. He already had a plan to deal with them.

He was removing the trash while keeping the gold. This was perfect. Qu Jianying couldn’t help sighing over the fact that this fellow was a monster.

Qu Jianying immediately sent people to spread word of this incident and to make sure that those new disciples were treated well. They would make the whole world learn that the Martial Heaven Alliance wasn’t excluding everyone. They were only excluding the toxic.

As long as they were willing to fight for the continent, they could be accepted regardless of their original position. The disciples were innocent. It was the higher-ups who had decided to betray the Martial Heaven Alliance. So the Martial Heaven Alliance would only accept the disciples. The majority of those higher-ups were toxic.

Although a portion of them weren’t toxic, the Martial Heaven Alliance didn’t have the time to accurately determine that. Most importantly, they weren’t important. They had already reached their lives’ higher points. In truth, they were no longer very valuable.

The cultivation world was merciless and cruel. The Martial Heaven Alliance’s resources couldn’t be spent on the useless. They needed elites.

Qu Jianying could already imagine countless disciples throwing themselves to her side thanks to this one move. It wasn’t just because the Martial Heaven Alliance was strong now, but also because it was the home of the Righteous path.

Que Yuzhu had those heads put away and announced that they would be properly buried another day. “Today is a celebratory day for the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow race. Thank you to everyone who came from so far away. I hope you’ll accept my apologies for my poor accommodations.”

For most sects, they would celebrate for three days and nights on the inauguration. However, it was much simpler for the Xuan Beasts. They would normally end things with just a meal. The Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow race had too many things to do. They were simply announcing that they were the rulers of this territory and that they were returning to this world.

“I’ve already prepared the food, and we can start the feast in just a few hours. However, people can’t waste their lives. Some things have to be done immediately, don’t you think, race leader Yuzhu?” Long Chen looked at Que Yuzhu with a smile.

Que Yuzhu didn’t know how to reply to such a thing. After all, conversing with humans was more difficult for the Xuan Beasts who always liked to be direct.

“Hehe, brother Long is saying that there’s still some time until we eat. Maybe we should get our exercise done to work up our appetites?” said Cloud. After knowing Long Chen for so long, she could guess what he wanted to do.

“You’re saying...” Que Yuzhu was startled.

“I mean that people should be magnanimous and not always keep grudges,” said Long Chen.

Now Que Yuzhu didn’t understand again. It was Li Tianxuan who said, “Long Chen rarely keeps grudges because he’s afraid of forgetting them. That’s why he prefers to get revenge immediately, so there’s no need to keep the grudges.”

Que Yuzhu finally understood. Since the Xuan Beasts had come to provoke them, they wouldn’t leave things as they were. They would strike back immediately.

“All experts of the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow race, hear my orders! Gather for an attack!” Que Yuzhu immediately gathered all the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrows that were at the eleventh rank and above.

“Haha, move out. Our target is the Xuan Beasts’ headquarters!” Long Chen laughed, while others bitterly smiled. This fellow was definitely not destined to have a peaceful life. This time, there would be a good show to watch.
