Chapter 2862 Slaughtering a Few People to Play

Long Chen peered through a crack in the rocks, and there was a large spacious area up ahead.

Half of this space was lava, and there was a small stone island within the lava with a stone pathway leading to it.

At this moment, hundreds of experts were surrounding the two women. The leader of those experts was Chu Kuang.

Beside Chu Kuang were many faces that Long Chen had never seen. However, all of their auras were very powerful. They were wearing robes of the God Institute’s disciples, but they were a bit different compared to Li Cai and the others’ robes.

“Inner academy disciples!” Long Chen suddenly recalled that these were the robes of the inner academy. Chu Kuang had actually brought out a group of inner academy disciples.

Luo Bing and Luo Ning were surrounded. At this moment, Luo Ning clenched her sword, glaring at Chu Kuang with overflowing killing intent.

“Chu Kuang, you bastard, I didn’t expect you to follow us,” spat out Luo Ning through clenched teeth. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

“Hahaha, how naive. The Chu family has eyes throughout the High Firmament Academy. What can possibly escape us? My eyes lie even amongst the people by your side. None of your movements can escape me. What? Has your heart finally been won over?” Chu Kuang laughed arrogantly like he was looking at prey caught in his trap.

“Ruxin is your spy?!” Luo Bing’s expression suddenly changed.

“Hehe, count yourself smart. Now you understand. Although she looked to have an enmity as deep as the sea with me, she had long since come to my bed. How laughable that you were fooled the entire time. This time, you’ve left yourselves with no way out,” laughed Chu Kuang.

“That bitch. I viewed her as a sister, and she actually betrayed me. Next time I see her, I will definitely cut off her head!” raged Luo Ning.

The Ruxin she spoke of was their most trusted confidante. When the two of them left, only she knew of it. But that was what had resulted in their current plight. Betrayal was the most painful thing.

“You won’t have that chance. Even together, both of you aren’t a match for me. Now with this many inner academy disciples here as well, there’s not the slightest chance of you getting away. Furthermore, you didn’t expose your tracks to anyone in order to keep your movements secret. Ruxin only knows that you go out and not what you’re doing. No one will save you. Hehe, but don’t worry, I won’t kill you. I’ll make sure that you’re captured alive, so I can properly play with you afterward, hahaha!” Chu Kuang and the other disciples beside him sneered at them filthily. The academy had its rules. But since this place was not the academy, there were no rules for them to respect.

“The Ying Prefecture’s Luo family?”

Long Chen suddenly clapped his forehead and stared in shock at Luo Ning and Luo Bing. They were actually from the same family as his mother. As for Chu Kuang, he had to be from the Sheng Prefecture’s Chu family. At this moment, Long Chen didn’t expect this world to be so small. In the vast immortal world, he had actually encountered people from his mother’s family here.

He grew a bit emotional. If this was the case, then he would quickly obtain information about his mother.

“Ning-er…” Luo Bing slowly placed her hand on the back of Luo Ning’s head, her voice quivering. Her eyes grew wet.

“Big sister, I’m not afraid. I won’t lose the face of the Luo family,” said Luo Ning staunchly. She had no fear.

She knew that Luo Bing intended to kill her to avoid her being captured alive. At that time, her life would be worse than death.

Compared to her big sister, Luo Ning’s combat power was still lacking. Hence, Luo Bing would kill her and then go all-out against Chu Kuang and the others. Every person she dragged down with her would be a bonus until she had no choice but to also kill herself.

Unfortunately, Luo Ning was too weak. If a battle started with these people, she might not even have the ability to kill herself when the time came.

“If there is another life, let us be sisters again…” Luo Bing closed her eyes. She was just about to do it when a voice rang out.

“If the two of them together aren’t a match for you, what if you add me in as well?”

Everyone was startled. They turned to see a black-robed Long Chen walking in with a smile.

“It’s you!”

Chu Kuang and the others were surprised. No one would have imagined that Long Chen would suddenly appear here.

However, after a moment of shock, Chu Kuang actually smiled. He waved his hand, and over ten more people appeared from behind some rubble, blocking off Long Chen’s retreat path.

Chu Kuang could be said to be truly cautious. Other than the people he had shown off, he even had some hidden backups just to prevent Luo Bing from escaping. It was a final line of defense that should have never been required, but now they gave Long Chen no chance of escaping.

However, Long Chen didn’t even look at them. He had long since noticed Chu Kuang’s arrangements, so he continued walking over.

That smile on his face was extremely bright. It was his first time being so happy in the immortal world. It felt like the clouds had parted.

“It really is a case of the heavens opening a path for you, but you still barge through the locked gates of hell. Long Chen, I admire this courage of yours. Are you trying to be the hero saving the beauties? It’s too bad that you overestimate your power,” sneered Chu Kuang.

“You’re wrong. I’m not just going to be the hero saving the beauties. I’m going to take all the treasures here as well as slaughter a few people for fun,” said Long Chen. He looked at the disciples in the surroundings and indifferently said, “Boss San’s mood is good today. I’ll give you a chance. If you don’t want to die, then hurry up and scram.”

“Hahaha!” Laughter rang out from each of them, and they looked at Long Chen like he was a fool.

“Are you an idiot? Do you not see our cultivation bases?” sneered one of those inner academy disciples.

“You are referring to the fact that you’ve ignited your divine flames?” Long Chen cast his gaze at that disciple and then shook his head. “In my eyes, you are all ants. Even slighter bigger ants can only be trampled. There is no difference.”

Long Chen had arrived before them. Hence, they opened up their enclosure and closed it behind him. As for Long Chen, as if he didn’t even notice them, he walked over to Luo Bing and Luo Ning.

Chu Kuang didn’t bother stopping him either, allowing him to enter. By walking in, he was giving up his last chance to escape.

Long Chen walked right up to the two of them and smiled. “I’m here to save you.”

“You… why bother?” Luo Ning was moved, but she knew that Long Chen couldn’t do anything against so many experts that had ignited their divine flames.

“There’s nothing else I can do. I’ve been toppled over by the immortal looks of two beautiful women, so I have no choice but to come out. Let me tell you a secret: I wasn’t trying to walk so slowly just now. My legs are actually sore, and I was worried that I would trip if I went any faster,” whispered Long Chen solemnly.

Although he switched to a whisper midway, everyone heard him clearly. Luo Bing then stared at him in bewildered confusion. Was this person a fool?

“Just die. Who wants to hear you talk?” One of the disciples suddenly took out a sword and slashed at Long Chen’s back.

Long Chen chuckled. “Alright, we’ll go with what you said.”

Without looking back, Long Chen suddenly bent over, his body twisting. His hand swung out in a graceful arc.

After that, his hand slapped that disciple’s face perfectly. As a result, half of his head caved in, and he was blown back, falling into the lava.
