Chapter 4796: Shocking Changes

The spatial gate opened, but instead of a flourishing academy, it revealed a ruined mountain range. The land was covered in terrible scars and holes where lava and water intersected, filling the air with a dirty scent.

Whats going on?! Bai Zhantang roared and charged out when he saw this.

Long Chen and the others were startled to see the devastation around them. At first, Long Chen suspected that the dean had brought them to the wrong place, but Bai Zhantangs grave reaction dispelled his doubt. Something terrible had unfolded here.

Bai Letians expression darkened as well. Holding the High Firmament Divine Sword, he disappeared in pursuit of their enemies, leaving behind lingering traces of Heavenly Dao runes. It seemed that the enemies had just left.

Boss, should I? Xia Chen asked, ready to act.

Long Chen shook his head. This could be a trap, and only the dean has the power to chase them. Rushing in blindly might lead us into an ambush. Lets assess the situation first before making any moves.

Long Chen led the way toward the direction Bai Zhantang had taken, navigating through layers of dense mist before arriving at the top of a mountain.

This enormous mountain consisted of solid rock, its surface gleaming with a golden hue, looking like a natural vein of precious ore. Yet, what caught their attention was the clean slice that cleaved through the mountain, leaving behind a surface as smooth as glass. Whatever had cut it was terrifyingly sharp, and they could feel the aura of a Heaven Saint from it.

Guo Ran couldnt help gasping when he saw this scene. As a skilled Forging Master, he immediately recognized the nature of the immortal metal comprising the vein. Despite its exceptional toughness, it had been effortlessly sliced apart like a watermelon. Hence, he knew that the attacker was incredibly powerful.

When Long Chen and the others set foot on the mountain, they could see tens of thousands of experts wearing the robes of the academy here. To their surprise, the weakest of them were at least Sage Kings.

Mom!

Long Chen and the others had yet to recover from their shock when Bai Shishis cry pierced through the crowd. She then pushed through the crowd. Long Chen's gaze followed hers, landing on Bai Shishi's mother whose complexion was a pallid yellow. With a jolt of concern, Long Chen hastily rushed over as well.

Bai Shishi trembled with fear and panic, tears streaming down her face as she called out to her mother in distress.

Mom! Mom! What happened to you?!

Bai Zhantang and Bai Xiaole's mother were by her side, offering support and aid. With their palms extended, they worked together to help her recover. After all, there were many wounds on her, and her robes were soaked with blood.

At this moment, Bai Shishi also extended her hand, placing it on her mothers chest. Seeing this, Bai Zhantang and Bai Xiaoles mother jumped.

Long Chen immediately grabbed her hand, stopping her. Your emotions are not stable enough. Your metal energy is too unsteady to help heal others.

If someone else had tried to stop her, Bai Shishi might have exploded. But when Long Chen said it, she burst into tears. He was entirely correct. In her state, he could accidentally worsen her mothers condition if she tried to help.

Angry and panicking, Bai Shishi cursed herself for being useless. After all, her metal energy was the most suitable to help her mother recover, but at this critical moment, she was unable to calm herself enough to do so. She felt like she was about to go crazy.

Long Chen quickly took out a medicinal pill and placed it in the mouth of Bai Shishis mother. This was a peerless-grade Saint pill and was covered in a pill cloth that blocked off the senses of the Heavenly Daos. However, her condition was so severe that she couldnt even swallow the pill. Long Chen then gave Bai Zhantang a look. With a blush on his fierce face, he kissed her, pushing the medicinal pill into her stomach.

She quickly started coughing intensely. With every cough, black qi came out of her mouth. Seeing this scene, Long Chen hastily pulled Bai Shishi away.

This black qi sizzled the golden ores on the ground, corroding the ground.

Heavens, what is this?! exclaimed Guo Ran. For this black qi to be able to corrode this ore, perhaps it could even melt some Saint weapons.

Bai Shishis mother coughed out seven mouthfuls of black qi. At first, it was pitch black like ink and gave off a disgusting stench, but toward the end, it became diluted. As a trace of rosiness returned to her face, her black eyes looked around. When she saw Bai Shishi, her eyes brightened. Shishi

Mom, Im here! Mom, Im sorry Bai Shishi hugged her mother tightly, sobbing.

In all of Bai Shishis memories, her mother had never suffered any injury, not even a superficial one. In her heart, her mother was her idol, an undefeatable goddess.

Hence, when Bai Shishi saw her in such a state, her mind went blank, and all her thoughts were in chaos. She wasnt even able to calm herself down.

Bai Shishis mother gently stroked her daughters cheek, a gentle smile gracing her lips despite her condition. Foolish child, why are you apologizing? Let me take a look at you. Its been so long. I missed both of you.

Bai Xiaole also knelt in front of Bai Shishis mother, tears streaming down his face. Who did this? Ill get revenge for you.

Looking at his determined expression, Bai Shishis mother simply smiled. My familys little boy has finally grown up. Im so happy

Another coughing fit interrupted her words, causing Long Chen to step forward and take out another medicinal pill.Y√¥ur favorite ùíèovels at n/ùíê(v)el/bin(.)com

Im fine. You shouldnt waste these treasures, Bai Shishi's mother insisted, waving off the offered pill after seeing it.

Her injuries had brought her perilously close to death's door, and Long Chen's pill had been the saving grace that pulled her back from it. With this knowledge, she understood that the pill must be an extraordinary treasure.

Though she had never laid eyes on a peerless-grade Saint pill before, she suspected that Long Chen had just fed her one, given its unparalleled potency.

Because of the immense value of such a pill, she firmly refused to eat the second pill, as she knew that it was practically equivalent to a second life. She didnt want to waste it.

Dont say it like that. How could it be a waste? Mother-in-law, you are my mother as well, Long Chen replied earnestly, his smile unwavering.

On the other hand, Bai Shishi went completely red, marveling at just how shameless Long Chen could be.

Meanwhile, Bai Zhantang let out a severe cough nearby. He had yet to give Long Chen consent to this matter.

Ah, father-in-law, are you unwell? asked Long Chen.

Bai Zhantangs face instantly darkened, but before he could reply, Bai Shishis mother accepted the pill with a smile. Alright then, Ill thank you for your filial devotion.

As soon as she consumed this pill, her wounds started healing at a rate visible to the naked eye. She then gazed at Long Chen in astonishment, overwhelmed by the rapid improvement in her condition.

This child

Its fine. After all, I made them myself. I can always make more, Long Chen reassured her with a casual wave of his hand before his expression turned serious.

What happened here? asked Long Chen.
