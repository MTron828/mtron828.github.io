Chapter 4034 Slaying Liao Bencang

How was that possible?!

That was the first thought to flit through people’s minds. Faith energy could only be exhausted, not beaten.

After all, faith energy was a power that transcended the power of the Heavenly Daos. It was the mental energy of countless lifeforms, and it was unbreakable.

It was precisely due to this that even three-flower Earth Venerates felt trepidation toward Liao Bencang, a World King. This was the terrifying power of faith energy.

However, Long Chen’s power actually caused Liao Bencang’s divine statues to crack. Such a thing completely surpassed their understanding.

“Impossible! He isn’t from the dragon race! How can he possess such powerful sacred energy?!” The Kunpeng patriarch’s eyes were full of disbelief.

Sacred energy was something that the Kunpeng race possessed as well. It was a power that the Kunpeng race had strived to snatch from the Heavenly Daos generation after generation. It could also be considered a power that exceeded the Heavenly Daos.

Only a trace of sacred energy would be born in an expert’s body after fighting against the Heavenly Daos and experiencing countless tribulations.

This trace of sacred energy then slowly accumulated and was added to, creating a powerful inheritance for future generations.

It could be said that sacred energy was a power for which innumerable generations of Kunpeng race experts had risked their very lives, waging relentless battles against the heavens to claim its profound might.

Other than the Kunpeng race, there were many other races with sacred energy. They were unwilling to be limited by the Heavenly Daos, and thus, struggled against their shackles, slowly accumulating the sacred energy.

However, only two races had the strongest sacred energy. One was the Kunpeng race, while the other was the true dragon race.

The true dragon race’s sacred energy stood at the peak of the ten thousand races. It was due to this that they were the emperor of the beasts, their dragon might capable of suppressing all other beasts.

Because the Kunpeng patriarch also possessed sacred energy, he could see through some clues. After all, only sacred energy could directly tear through faith energy.

However, that was something impossible for him to accept. Long Chen’s sacred energy was this terrifying? Although its aura was slightly weak, its strength was shocking.

If the Kunpeng patriarch’s sacred energy could be likened to a large tree, then Long Chen’s sacred energy was like a three-inch nail.

Although it was smaller, its toughness was much greater. It directly clashed with Liao Bencang’s faith energy and began to obliterate it.

The most bewildering thing to the Kunpeng patriarch was that Long Chen’s sacred energy did not purely stem from the true dragon race but also from himself. It was the merger of these two sacred energies that formed an unprecedented sacred energy.

This completely toppled his understanding of sacred energy. Sacred energy was something gained through fighting against the Heavenly Daos, the privilege and authority grasped through surviving the heavenly tribulation. Other than that, it could only be accumulated through countless generations.

Since that was the case, Long Chen was from the human race and had ascended from a lower plane, so there were definitely no sacred inheritances from his ancestors. Then just how did he come to gain sacred energy?

While the Kunpeng patriarch was bewildered, Liao Bencang’s smaller statues were continuing to crack. Even his largest statue was starting to crack, looking like it might fall apart at any moment.

Liao Bencang was filled with disbelief and terror now. He knew little about sacred energy, even less than the Kunpeng patriarch, so he was even more bewildered about how Long Chen was doing this. His faith energy was supposed to be unrivaled!

“Help me! Or you’ll all die too!”

Liao Bencang suddenly roared. The moment he felt fear, a certain face entered his mind. That was the face of a fatty smiling sinisterly at him.

BOOM!

Just as he roared, the countless smaller statues behind him exploded, signifying that Liao Bencang was now cut off from his followers. He could no longer absorb an unending stream of faith energy.

As a result, Liao Bencang hacked up blood, and his forehead split open. But then, through the crack in his forehead, a translucent arrow shot out toward Long Chen.

“Splitting the mind?! That’s the power of a Heaven Venerate.”

The other experts rushed over. Seeing that Liao Bencang was capable of unleashing a spiritual attack while striving to defend against Long Chen with his full power, they all jumped in shock.

In that state, not even an Earth Venerate could do such a thing. If they were unleashing their full power to defend, their essence, qi, and spirit had to be merged. To split one’s attention to launch another attack was purely quickening their own death.

However, Liao Bencang was capable of unleashing such an attack while still resisting Long Chen’s attack. That meant that he had utilized some kind of special power.

This power was called the “mind” in the dragon race. It had no name in the human race. Thus, it was simply said to be the power of a Heaven Venerate, as only Heaven Venerates were capable of controlling this incorporeal power.

However, what was even more shocking was that, despite the appearance of this translucent arrow, Long Chen didn't attempt to dodge. Instead, that spiritual arrow simply exploded just before reaching his head.

“What?!”

People were shocked to see a translucent shield appear in front of Long Chen’s head and block Liao Bencang’s attack.Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

At this moment, the giant statue behind Liao Bencang cracked more and more, terrifying him. He tried to cry out for aid, but the moment he opened his mouth, violent pressure caused his body to explode.

“Attack!”

The Kunpeng patriarch cried out. If they still didn’t take action. Liao Bencang would be truly dead. If he died, who could stop Long Chen then?

Dozens of three-flower Earth Venerates from the Kunpeng race, the Alldevil race, the Blood race, the Underworld race, and others attacked. However, they didn’t dare to approach Long Chen and simply launched long-distance attacks.

One attack after another tore through the air, containing their full power. They no longer even thought about holding back as Long Chen’s power terrified them.

Suddenly, another translucent barrier appeared around Long Chen. When they saw that, everyone’s hearts shook. Was this a Heaven Venerate’s power again?

This time, there was no heaven-shaking explosion. The barrier around Long Chen simply twisted, and everyone’s expressions changed.

“Not good! Our power…!”

Long Chen coughed up blood, but Liao Bencang didn’t even make a sound. He simply exploded, his divine statue disintegrating, and his faith energy dissipating into nothingness.

“Long Chen, I won’t let you off!”

Liao Bencang’s unwilling roar hung in the air. His physical body crumbled, and his Yuan Spirit transformed into nothingness. However, his faith energy still hung in the air. As long as it wasn’t completely destroyed, he would have a chance of condensing a new Yuan Spirit.

Just as all that faith energy was about to dissipate into heaven and earth, the world quivered. The spatial gate high in the sky slowly opened.

Long Chen couldn’t help being shocked when he saw that. How did the gates of hell suddenly open?

A powerful suction force came out of the gate, sucking the faith energy inside of it.

“Nooo! Enpuda, you goddamn bastard…!” Liao Bencang’s unwilling roar rang out from within that faith energy.

“No, this isn’t the aura of hell! It’s a trick!” Long Chen’s expression suddenly changed.

Just then, the spatial gate lit up, and a pillar of light shot out of it toward a certain direction. That direction was the capital. Just then, Long Chen saw black flames appear above the capital.

At that sight, Long Chen’s soul suddenly quivered. A terrible feeling rose within him.

“That’s the Yan Xu Flame! Their target is Qingxuan!”

Killing intent exploded out of Long Chen. Ignoring the people in front of him, he shot toward the capital.
