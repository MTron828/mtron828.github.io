Chapter 3974 Smashed into a Meat Patty

Following that voice, a group of large, muscular experts in extravagant robes walked in.

“It’s the crown prince’s people. They’re intentionally causing trouble, but it’s not convenient for me to teach them a lesson in this place. However, you don’t need to have so many misgivings. As long as you are strong enough, you can do whatever you want with them. There’s no need to give them face,” whispered Yu Qianxue in Long Chen’s ear.

Over ten experts approached with confident strides. Their leader was a full head taller than Long Chen, and his arms rivaled the thickness of a person’s thighs. But what was even more amazing was his Blood Qi that was surging under his skin like serpents.

When those experts stopped in front of Long Chen, the leader stared at Long Chen provokingly. He was a powerful Double Supreme, and his Blood Qi was like a raging fire, suffocating others.

With a disdainful smile, he said, “Someone like you wants to marry a princess? Maybe you should take a piss and look at your reflection first. You think you’re qualified?”

Long Chen smiled and looked from this large man to the others. Shaking his head, he indifferently said, “My mood is good today, and I don’t want other people to ruin it. Also, my temper isn’t very good, so I would advise you to hurry up and scram. You can just be good people. Is being a dog so interesting? If Zhu Yunwen doesn’t accept me, he can come at me directly. What is the point of sending a few scapegoats?”

Long Chen knew that the crown prince nursed a grudge against him after they had almost fought that day. Thus, his subordinates would naturally target him.

One of them pointed at Long Chen and cursed, “Brat, you should watch your language, or else-!"

Before he could finish his sentence, Long Chen swiftly grabbed his wrist, exerting a tremendous force that resulted in the violent tearing of the entire arm. Blood then sprayed in all directions as the individual let out a harrowing scream.

It happened all too quickly for anyone to react. Now, that person’s dismembered arm was in Long Chen’s grasp.

“Courting death!”

Their leader furiously smashed a fist at Long Chen. However, the confined space limited his ability to gather power, resulting in an attack solely relying on his physical strength. Despite this limitation, this fist unleashed a wild tempest.

To their surprise, his large fist was caught by Long Chen’s hand, which was akin to a dragon claw digging into his fist, making him feel pain. Without hesitation, this expert sent a kick at Long Chen’s armpit to make him let go.Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

However, he had just raised his foot when Long Chen directly lifted him up.

After that, in front of everyone’s stunned gaze, the large man was ruthlessly slammed into the ground.

BOOM!

As he was solidly smashed into the ground, the bricks’ runes lit up, forming a powerful defensive formation that protected the ground from any damage. On the other hand, that large man hacked up blood, his teeth letting out a crunching sound.

“Who said that you could have such a dirty mouth?!” roared Long Chen.

Long Chen raised the large man into the air, using him like a sandbag and smashing him into the ground repeatedly.

Seeing this scene, Yu Qianxue and Zhu Yifeng were dumbfounded. Long Chen's attack had come so abruptly that they were unable to react in time. Moreover, they couldn’t even tell what technique he was using, as it was completely different from the fighting style that they were used to.

How could Long Chen achieve this? It had to be known that this large man was one of the powerful subordinates of the crown prince. Even Yu Qianxue would need at least ten moves to defeat him.

However, in front of Long Chen, he was unable to exchange even half a move before being caught.

The first three times he was smashed into the ground, he still had the power to fight back. But by the fourth time, he was already unconscious.

By the fifth time, he had no spiritual qi left to protect his body, which caused his bones to shatter. The pain then woke him up, and he was smashed into the ground again, knocking him unconscious once more.

In the end, Long Chen smashed him into the ground eighteen times. Eventually, he sensed the weight in his hand lighten. When he raised his gaze, he discovered that all that remained in his grasp was a thick arm. The force of Long Chen's strikes had propelled the large man's body through the air, sending him hurtling and crashing into a nearby wall.

Upon impact, the man's body went limp, resembling a lifeless mass of mud. He just lay there motionless, his fate hanging in the balance, as the extent of his injuries and his state of being—whether alive or dead—remained uncertain.

Long Chen was now holding two severed arms, overflowing with icy killing intent. Just by looking at his ominous appearance, the people in the vicinity quivered endlessly.

“Sorry, it’s definitely my heart-devil causing trouble again. I must stay calm…” Long Chen tossed aside the arms and put on a regretful appearance.

“Bullshit!”

Just then, Long Chen heard a spiritual roar from the bronze cauldron. His heart-devil was enraged.

It was Long Chen himself being violent, yet he blamed his heart-devil while the latter was unable to even leave the bronze cauldron. Thus, he cursed Long Chen’s shamelessness.

Long Chen pretended not to hear and shrugged. “I already told you that my temper isn’t good. It’s your own fault for not listening!”

Long Chen’s temper came and left quickly. Just now, he had seemed like he was about to murder them all, and now he seemed fine as if nothing had happened. These sudden turns left Yu Qianxue and Zhu Yifeng flabbergasted.

“You… you… you sneak attacker! How shameful!” One of them roared at Long Chen's indifference.

As a result, a hand suddenly struck his face, causing half of his face to collapse. He was then smashed into that meat patty of a large man who was stuck on the wall.

“AH!”

As a result, that person fainted, but the large man woke up from the pain.

His body was a shattered mess, with every bone broken and his Blood Qi in complete disarray. As a result, agonizing waves surged through him, causing him to writhe and convulse as if countless startled rabbits were stampeding over his injuries. The excruciating torment became unbearable, pushing him to the brink of wishing for a swift death.

“Cough, my apologies. I tend to be a bit heavy-handed. Next time, I’ll be more careful. Also, I should advise you to keep your voices down so I’m not startled. It’s rude to point at people. Also, take note of your tone and attitude when speaking. In fact, it would be best if you just didn’t speak to me. After all, life is very precious. A person’s life is already short, and there’s no point in taking shortcuts!”

Long Chen was now smiling brightly, but that was even more terrifying than his previous appearance. He was like a phantom when he attacked, and they were unable to defend against him.

Those people all retreated in terror. It was only once they were far away enough that they felt safe.

They then quickly pulled off the meat patty man and the other one before slinking away. But just as they were about to leave Long Chen’s line of sight, one of them pointed at Long Chen and cursed.

“Just you wait-!”

That person didn’t even finish speaking before a flash of lightning pierced his mouth.
