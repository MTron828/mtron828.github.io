Chapter 3136 Long Chen’s Rage

Everyone's breathing stopped. Die Wu’s palm caused space to collapse, but Gui Yun’s dagger had stabbed through her heart.

Even through the formation, the sinister air of that dagger made people’s souls shudder. It was like a devil had cursed it, giving it a sinister, dark, and bloodthirsty qi.

Black runes instantly covered Die Wu’s body. It was like a net-binding prey, and her body began to petrify.

“Gui Yun, release her and I will use her life to trade for yours,” announced Long Chen.

Whether it was the Butterfly Spirit race or the Butterfly Dance race, they were both innately kind races. Long Chen was unwilling to watch them just die.

Although he also knew that Die Wu wouldn’t be able to live long due to the loss of her contractual partner, he was unwilling to watch this. That should not be her fate. Perhaps he might even have a medicinal pill that could save her life.

Gui Yun was startled. He quickly understood his meaning and laughed.

Long Chen looked at her with a powerful light in his eyes. “There’s nothing to laugh about. I never joke with my enemies. The very first time I saw you, I was ready to kill you. If you release her, then when we fight, I can spare your life. If you kill her… I, Long Chen, swear to hunt you down whether you flee to heaven or hell. Even if Enpuda supports you, it won’t change your fate of being killed by me.”

Long Chen’s words reverberated through the air and through people’s hearts. Long Chen was actually planning on killing Gui Yun? Where did that confidence come from?

“Hahaha, are you threatening me? How laughable.” Gui Yun laughed until the fat on his face bounced.

“I’ve never threatened anyone. I’m only stating facts,” said Long Chen. Seeing Die Wu captured, an indescribable sorrow appeared in his heart.

Did this world really have such a thing as kindness being repaid by kindness? Then why would such a kind race end up in such a miserable plight?

In the lower plane, he encountered the Spirit race and the Luo Spirit race. They were all kind races. But what did their kindness receive in return? Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

They only received grief and pain. The mortal world was like that, and the immortal world was the same.

Lord Brahma’s hands had spread throughout the immortal world. His dogs were all over the nine lands and ten lands. Enpuda was nothing more than one of his dogs, but he had established the Bloodkill Hall that terrified people.

Lord Brahma was Long Chen’s fated enemy. The losses of the five Sovereigns, of Ling Yunzi, of the old man, of Qu Jianying, of Hu Feng, of everyone in that battle, it all could be traced back to Lord Brahma.

Even if Long Chen wasn’t a nine star heir, he would not let off Lord Brahma. For Gui Yun to appear before him, he definitely wouldn’t let him leave alive.

However, at this moment, Long Chen was willing to let him go for Die Wu. This was no threat. But other than himself, everyone else thought that he was crazy.

Just as everyone was staring at him in shock and contempt, Die Wu smiled gently. “Long Chen, you’re a good person, a true warrior. My Butterfly Dance race will always remember your favor. However, I don’t have long left. Letting off this fiend isn’t worth it.”

Die Wu’s words were suddenly cut off by a scream. Gui Yun’s dagger had started to suck away her soul essence and Spirit Blood.

“Stop!”

“You brute!”

“Stop at once!”

Countless cries rang out from the spectator stands.

BOOM!

A black figure suddenly charged at the martial stage. As a result, divine light flowed on top of the martial stage’s barrier, and a runic sword shot out.

“This idiot!”

Bai Shishi and the others were stunned. Long Chen had actually charged toward the stage. It had to be known that the martial stage’s formation prevented such interference. Even the Flower Butterfly patriarch, a Divine Lord expert, was seriously injured by it.

Why did Long Chen suddenly turn into an idiot at such a time? This action was practically sending himself to his death.

The runic sword whistled toward Long Chen. At this moment, runes flowed on top of Long Chen’s hand, and a cluster of flames appeared on his fingers. Every cluster contained different runes.

BANG!

Long Chen’s palm then slammed into the runic sword, and it was actually sent flying into the air.

In an instant, everyone was stunned. That runic sword was sent flying by Long Chen?

The barrier once more shuddered. Multiple runic swords now whistled toward Long Chen.

“Brave warrior, thank you for your kindness. Right now, all I can do is this…”

A flower rune suddenly appeared on Die Wu’s hand, and she slammed it behind her. It happened so suddenly that even Gui Yun didn’t expect her to be capable of such a thing.

BOOM!

Die Wu’s hand slammed into Gui Yun’s body. He coughed up blood, and his chest was almost pierced. A flower mark was branded into his chest.

Die Wu smiled. “You never expected this, right? I know that I can’t beat you, so that palm of mine was missed intentionally. A portion of my power was sealed into my other hand, and my spiritual seal is now branded on your body. With Long Chen’s blessing of the Butterfly Spirit race, even if your concealing arts are really perfect, you won’t be able to escape his senses. This is all I can do. I believe that a warrior like him can kill you once you can’t hide from him. Then I’ve also accomplished my mission… I can join… my companion.”

The remaining light in her eyes vanished. Just like that, she fell from the air. Her final palm had exhausted all her remaining longevity. But a sweet smile still remained on her face.

Gui Yun was shocked and enraged. He circulated his energy, but he was unable to remove the mark on his chest. That mark was bizarre. It sank into his bloodline, his bones, and even his soul.

“Slut, die!”

Gui Yun furiously unleashed a fist, blasting apart Die Wu’s body. However, no blood appeared. She transformed into flower petals that danced through the air.

The Butterfly Dance race was not human. It could be considered a branch of the flower demons, so those flower petals were her body. They fell, the final ending of a beautiful life.

“Gui Yun!”

Long Chen’s voice seemed to come from the depths of hell. Somehow, he had avoided all those runic swords and was now standing in front of the martial stage’s barrier. But it was too late.
