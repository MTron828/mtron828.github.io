Chapter 2099 Heavenly Dao Spirit Silver

He was fast, appallingly fast. Zhao Wuji’s black wings had runes flashing on top of them, allowing him to break through space. He arrived in front of Long Chen in an instant.

His sickle blades slashed toward Long Chen like two giant pincers, one from the left and one from the right.

With a cold snort, Long Chen’s foot stamped on the air, and he shot back, avoiding the blades. He had just dodged the two blades when a long needle appeared in front of his face.

Zhao Wuji’s sickles had actually been bait. The true attack was his sharp tail.

That tail was like a scorpion’s. It had eighteen segments, and the tip was a sharp needle. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

Long Chen punched the needle, and an explosive sound rang out. Long Chen’s fist was covered in blood. His scales were actually split apart by Zhao Wuji’s needle. The blood that came flowing out was black and smelly.

“Hahaha, your reactions aren’t bad, but this is just the start. The main course hasn’t even started. Do you have any last words?”

Zhao Wuji floated in the sky, his black wings flapping and his tail swaying. He smiled coldly.

Long Chen had been injured in just the first exchange. The experts below were sighing inside. This Zhao Wuji was even more difficult to deal with than the legends said. His techniques were bizarre, and all their combat experience was useless in the face of this strange armor.

“You’re not qualified to hear any of my last words.” Long Chen flicked off the blood. Zhao Wuji’s armor was extremely toxic, but those toxins couldn’t invade Long Chen’s body.

“You’re still talking big. Let me see just how much longer you can last!” Zhao Wuji transformed into a series of afterimages that shot at Long Chen.

Long Chen snorted and charged straight at Zhao Wuji as well, seemingly unafraid of his armor.

“Just what is Long Chen thinking? Is he an idiot?!” Beitang Rushuang cursed as she watched Long Chen foolishly charge at Zhao Wuji barehanded.

Zhao Wuji was like a hedgehog. What kind of idiot would choose to fight him with their fists?

“Long Chen definitely has his own plan,” said Ye Lingshan. However, even she wasn’t entirely confident in that.

BOOM!

Long Chen was prepared for a direct clash with the azure dragon’s scales covering his arms, but just as he was about to receive the attack of Zhao Wuji’s tail, a sphere came out of the tip and exploded.

Countless needles shot out, filling the air around them. There was no way to dodge that many needles.

With a shout, Long Chen suddenly smashed his fist forward, and his immense power caused space to cave in. The needles in front of Long Chen were sucked into that collapsing space and then actually flew back toward Zhao Wuji.

“What a refined counterattack!” This move of Long Chen’s made even these experts sigh in amazement. Long Chen’s force had to first go from hard to gentle, and then back from gentle to hard in an instant. That kind of adaptive ability was admirable.

The regretful thing was that these needles merely bounced off of Zhao Wuji’s armor. They didn’t harm him at all.

Suddenly, the runes on Zhao Wuji’s chest began to move. Long Chen’s scalp turned numb, and without even thinking about it, lightning wings appeared on his back and he dodged to the side.

Dozens of black lights shot out of Zhao Wuji’s chest, bringing with them a space-piercing sound that almost shredded people’s eardrums.

Those black lights vanished beyond the horizon. They were so fast that no one even managed to see what they were.

From that space-piercing sound, they could guess that they were some hidden weapons. For there to be so much power behind them, anyone struck would probably have their body directly explode from the impact.

Seeing all this, everyone felt a chill. Zhao Wuji was too insidious. This Life-Ripping Armor was filled with mechanisms. Even if your cultivation base was higher than his, you would lose your life from the slightest carelessness against him.

Those mechanisms were fast, but Long Chen was not slow either. It was as if he had known what would happen, which allowed him to move before the attack even appeared.

Long Chen was about to counterattack when he found that Zhao Wuji was already shooting back. That wasn’t because he was dodging Long Chen’s counterattack, but simply because firing that attack just now resulted in him sending himself flying away.

Long Chen shot after him with his lightning wings. His fists were a blur as he attacked.

Long Chen began a fierce battle against Zhao Wuji and his Life-Ripping Armor. Mechanisms popped up one by one, coming from Zhao Wuji’s wrists, shoulders, elbows, groin, neck, back, waist, knees, ankles, simply everywhere. As a result, light sounds would ring out along with the launch of each mechanism.

There were several times where Long Chen narrowly avoided a fatal blow. Zhao Wuji’s mechanisms came in an unending torrent. Just watching Long Chen dancing on a tightrope like this made Beitang Rushuang and Nangong Zuiyue sweat.

This intense battle could make people’s hearts clench. Every inch of Zhao Wuji’s Life-Ripping Armor had a hidden mechanism that would suddenly appear.

“So that’s it.” Kun Pengzi suddenly muttered to himself as he watched their fight, his words mystifying Huang Feiyan.

Zhao Wuji was startled by Long Chen’s spiritual perception. Every time he unleashed an attack, Long Chen would be able to sense it and just barely dodge his killer attack.

This Life-Ripping Armor of his had over three hundred and sixty mechanisms, and each mechanism could unleash different kinds of attacks. In total, he had over a thousand killer attacks.

However, in front of Long Chen, his unending killer attacks had lost effect. Not one managed to show results.

The thing that made him uneasy though was that as their battle continued, Long Chen seemed to be growing more familiar with his techniques. Zhao Wuji was no longer able to pose any danger to Long Chen.

“He’s just probing my skills!” Zhao Wuji came to a frightening realization. He suddenly found that in just over an incense stick’s worth of time, he had used up over a thousand mechanisms in their fierce fight. Now, Long Chen would already be dodging as he activated his mechanisms.

With a furious howl, Zhao Wujis’ armor lit up. His blades unleashed an explosion of light as they slashed toward Long Chen.

BOOM!

Long Chen was forced back. Flinging off some blood, he smiled. “What? Are you not planning on using the mechanisms that you’re so proud of?”

The two of them were maintaining their original distance from before the battle had started.

Beitang Rushuang sighed. Watching that battle had been intense. Zhao Wuji’s Life-Ripping Armor was so dangerous that any mistake could have been fatal to Long Chen.

Ye Lingshan said that she wasn’t nervous and that she was confident in Long Chen, but even she had some sweat on her palms. This Zhao Wuji was practically a killing machine.

By this time, many people had noticed the clues. At the start, Long Chen had been repeatedly injured, but toward the end, he was able to dodge all of Zhao Wuji’s sinister moves, and it seemed to be growing easier for him.

“You want to test all my moves? Keep dreaming. I wouldn’t be able to use up all my moves even while fighting non-stop for three days and nights. As for you, you will die if you are struck by just one of these moves. Do you think I’m afraid of you?” sneered Zhao Wuji.

Long Chen shook his head. “I’m not interested in that. I’m just helping one of my brothers accumulate some experience. He might get some inspiration. He’s quite the genius, and I’m sure he’d like this gift.”

Long Chen had activated a photographic jade from the start and even used his Spiritual Strength to perfectly record every movement of Zhao Wuji’s armor.

The transformations of the runes, the locations of the mechanisms, the signs before an attack, they were all recorded. Although it wasn’t possible to unlock the Life-Ripping Armor’s secrets just from looking at it, it would be very helpful to Guo Ran considering what a forging fanatic he was.

“This bastard’s really a madman!” cursed Beitang Rushuang. Was it worth it to risk his life like this? Just how crazy did he have to be?

“You want to peek at my Mechanism Sect’s secrets? Hahahaha, alright, then take a look!”

Zhao Wuji suddenly laughed, and his black armor slowly changed color. It went from black to silver.

When it was fully silver, Heavenly Dao energy boomed. All the experts present let out startled cries.

“Heavenly Dao Spirit Silver?! How is that possible?! How can he have so much of it?!”

Heavenly Dao Spirit Silver was a divine material that had been exceptionally rare even in the ancient era. It possessed its own spirituality and could not be refined from the ores of the earth. Instead, it was extracted from certain meteorites that came from the heavens.

It was said that those objects that came from outside the world had absorbed a huge amount of Heavenly Dao energy when they broke through the world’s spatial barriers. Only after absorbing a huge amount of Heavenly Dao energy would it become silver.

When it was exposed to the outer world, it naturally absorbed Heavenly Dao energy, and some ancient powers used them in their formations to absorb Heavenly Dao energy and allow their disciples to awaken their manifestations.

However, this kind of precious material could not be obtained just because you wanted it. There had only been a few records of meteorites coming from outside the world. Every time, an intense competition ensued. Even the everlasting families had very small quantities of this material. For Zhao Wuji to have a whole set of armor made from it was shocking.

A silver beam of light soared out of Zhao Wuji’s armor and into the sky. Heaven and earth shook as endless Heavenly Dao energy surged toward Zhao Wuji.

“Long Chen, I’ll show you how great the difference between an idiot like you and me is! Even if you cultivated for a thousand, for ten thousand years, you wouldn’t be able to make up for this difference!”

Zhao Wuji’s voice resounded through the air. Rumbling rang out as his manifestation appeared behind him.
