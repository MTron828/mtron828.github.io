Chapter 1573 Fight or Fuck Off

Translator: BornToBe

The one who had attacked was the old man. The old man didn’t say anything after killing that person. He didn’t even bother explaining.

Boss Bao laughed. “This is the style of the Heaven Splitting Battle Sect. What’s the point of explaining? They were intentionally accusing Long Chen wrongly. He only has one mouth, so no matter what he says, he’s going to be drowned out by your billions of mouths. How laughable. If everything could be explained, would there still be any fighting in this world? Old man, my words are right, right?”

The Heaven Splitting Battle Sect didn’t get along with the rest of the world precisely because they didn’t like playing such senseless scheming games. What irritated them the most was that many sects that wanted to devour others had to provide some kind of sanctimonious reason for their actions to cover up their own shamelessness.

That was what made it even more shameless. Did they really think others didn’t see their true intentions just because they tried to cover them up? Did they think that was enough to look arrogantly down upon others from a moral high ground and criticize them?

That was why the Heaven Splitting Battle Sect rarely came into contact with the outer world and never talked reason with other sects. If anyone provoked them, then they would simply fight. If they had the ability, then they could kill the Heaven Splitting Battle Sect. If they didn’t have that ability, then they would be the ones killed.

The Heaven Splitting Battle Sect’s experts had muscles for brains. They had one principle: if you can fight, then don’t waste words.

Even within the Heaven Splitting Battle Sect, when fellow members disagreed with each other, they would decide who was right with their fists. Whoever’s fist was harder was right.

This person was clearly guilty of falsely accusing Long Chen on purpose, but he still blamed Long Chen for not explaining himself. Long Chen might be able to bear it, but the old man couldn’t.

The old man shook his head. “His voice was too loud and irritating. That’s all.”

Everyone was speechless. Why did that sound like he had killed him not because he had cursed Long Chen, but because his voice was ugly?

Long Chen had slapped the palace master’s face in front of the valley master, while the old man had even killed a sect leader in front of him. Yu Xiaoyun’s gaze was growing darker and darker. They were clearly not giving a damn about his status.

However, he was a generation’s expert, and he had great self-control. He coldly said, “Even if that’s the case, Long Chen still can’t change the fact that he betrayed the human race and joined hands with the Spirit World’s creatures to kill experts of the ancient family alliance.”

“That’s right! He killed so many of my disciples! The ancient family alliance is supposed to be allied with the Righteous path against the Corrupt path! However, you turned your vicious means onto us! That’s completely intolerable!” cried an expert from the ancient family alliance.

He was rather smarter than the previous person, and he said this from behind the valley master, not only showing that he was blindly following Pill Valley but also guaranteeing his safety. No one could attack him from this spot.

Following his lead, more and more experts came out to demand that Long Chen pay for their disciples’ lives with his own life.

“Long Chen, do you dare to admit that you worked together with the creatures of the Spirit Race to kill the disciples of my ancient family alliance?!” roared a sharp-mouthed Life Star expert. He had clearly had his family killed by Long Chen and was extremely emotional.

When this person said this, everyone shut their mouths. The distant neutral camp’s experts all held their breath.

This was the crucial point. If this was false, then all their accusations against Long Chen would be false. Then he would be able to make a huge counterattack, and his name would be spread through history.

At this time, Zi Yan had awakened and was standing in the neutral camp. Seeing the excited people around her, she was a bit confused.

There were actually so many people in support of Long Chen. Based on their spiritual fluctuations, they all believed he was wrongly accused.

“You’re correct.” Long Chen nodded.

The neutral camp’s people couldn’t believe their ears. Long Chen had really joined hands with enemies to massacre the experts of the Righteous path and ancient family alliance?

“How could this be?” All the neutral camp’s disciples became disappointed. The majority of them had believed that Long Chen had been falsely accused this entire time. However, he personally admitted to it now.

Although Pill Valley had disseminated some photographic jades that revealed scenes of Long Chen’s fighting in the Spirit World, they would rather believe that someone was framing him. They had hoped that he would manage to throw off their slander, but now that hope was extinguished.

“Good, good! Since you’ve admitted to it, then no matter what methods we used to kill you, they were necessary and right! The Dragon Slaughtering Convention was also not based on nothing, and the people who died today died for justice! Long Chen, you must die today. Valley master, please help uphold justice for us!” roared the sharp-mouthed Life Star expert.

“That’s right, please get justice for us, valley master! Long Chen must be held accountable. This is justice for our disciples!” Other experts began to roar as well.

Long Chen coldly said, “I’m not done talking yet. Hear my explanation.”

“Who would want to hear your explanation? We need to immediately execute him and make sure to extract his soul so that he never reincarnates. All those people beside him should be executed as well. We have to wipe them all out-!” shouted the sharp-mouthed Life Star expert.

“Fuck your mother!” Long Chen couldn’t bear it anymore and charged at him. Yu Xiaoyun’s Daynight Furnace flickered, but the patriarch activated the Xuantian Tower, and a pillar of light encased Yu Xiaoyun.

Yu Xiaoyun’s expression changed. The Daynight Furnace’s own divine light flowed out, forming a barrier around him.

“Valley master, I’d advise you not to force me. Right now, I am listening to the current Xuan Master. What he tells me to do, I’ll do. Considering you are just a clone, you cannot contend against me. I trust that you also do not wish to see this clone of yours destroyed,” said the patriarch.

“I don’t believe you dare to do so,” said the valley master gloomily.

“You’re right, I don’t dare. However, I am listening to Li Tianxuan’s orders, and Li Tianxuan is listening to that little fellow. So you shouldn’t be asking if I dare , but whether Long Chen dares,” said the patriarch.

“You...!” Yu Xiaoyun was enraged. His true body was still in seclusion and couldn’t come out. However, even though this was just a clone, it couldn’t leave him for too long. The longer it stayed away, the more it affected his true body’s progression. Just having his clone summoned like this had cost him greatly.

The patriarch was correct. His clone’s power was less than a third of his true body’s, and it could not bring out the full power of the Daynight Furnace. Even though the Xuantian Dao Sect’s patriarch had only advanced to the Netherpassage realm recently, there was still a chance he could destroy his clone if they fought.

BOOM!

Long Chen charged into the crowd, slashing Evilmoon. A dozen Life Star experts were sent flying. After this much time, he had recovered at least enough energy to unleash one attack. His one attack sent his blockers flying, while the sharp-mouthed Life Star expert’s Ancestral item exploded along with his arms. Before he could flee, Long Chen grabbed his throat.

“Long Chen, come back. Don’t cause a fuss,” shouted Li Tianxuan.

Long Chen returned to his original location. He was still holding that sharp-mouthed Life Star expert.

Seeing Long Chen return, the patriarch released his hand seal, and the Xuantian Tower’s divine light dimmed. Yu Xiaoyun also pulled back the Daynight Furnace.

However, now his face was as dark as the bottom of a pot. In all his life, he had never been so vexed. Long Chen had come and gone without anyone stopping him. These experts were all afraid of him and didn’t dare to stop him.

Instead, they directly fled. If only they had used two divine items, they might have been able to capture Long Chen alive.

However, there were no Netherpassage experts amongst them. The experts present didn’t have sharp enough insight to see that Long Chen hadn’t recovered much at all. They had ended up wasting such a good opportunity. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

“Fuck your mother!” Long Chen repeatedly slapped the sharp-mouthed Life Star expert. “When I killed people first, you said I refused to explain because I was guilty. Now that I want to explain, you say that no one cares about my explanation. Then what the fuck are you telling me to do?”

Long Chen was doing his best to control his power, but in his anger, he carelessly blew apart that Life Star expert’s head. His Yuan Spirit flew out.

“Valley master, save me!”

However, he had only just flown out when Long Chen pointed a finger. A lightning arrow pierced the Yuan Spirit, killing it.

“What do you want to explain?” the seventh boss asked curiously.

“Fuck, I’m not explaining anymore. Explaining is useless anyways. Those who trust me don’t need an explanation, and those who don’t trust me won’t believe it.” Long Chen rested Evilmoon on his shoulder and spat on the ground. These people were too infuriating.

Pointing Evilmoon at the experts in front of him, Long Chen roared, “All you bastards, listen well! I’m only going to say this once. The Spirit World’s creatures once helped out the Martial Heaven Continent, and we are indebted to them. However, some idiots randomly read some history books and believed them without realizing that history is written by the victors. Those history books are like prostitutes talking about how pure and beautiful they were back in the day. The dirty parts were all covered. Whoever believes that crap is just an idiot. The true history was already lost in the river of time. Of course, you can believe me if you want to, or you can not believe me. But don’t talk to me about proof. I have always acted openly. If I do something good, perhaps I might not admit to it, but when I do bad things, I always dare to admit to it. If you want to be enemies with me, then come. Other than having one life and one blade, I also have over twelve thousand life and death brothers. So, fight or fuck off!”

“Fight or fuck off!”

“Fight or fuck off!”

“Fight or fuck off!”

The Dragonblood Legion’s hot blood was ignited, and the roaring of over twelve thousand Dragonblood warriors shook the sky.

“Who would have thought that the Eastern Xuan Region is so lively? It’s so gratifying.”

Just as the Dragonblood Legion’s angry roars were shaking the sky, a soft voice rang out. A chariot slowly flew over.
