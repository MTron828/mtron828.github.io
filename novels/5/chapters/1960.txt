Chapter 1950: 1950

That young man spat at Long Chen, startling quite a few people .

It had to be known that Long Chen was one of the world’s most ruthless people . From the Eastern Wasteland to the Central Plains, those heavenly geniuses that had become enemies with him had all died .

Although this man was at the Life Star realm and was also a powerful Empyrean, it seemed that someone on his level wasn’t qualified to be arrogant in front of Long Chen .

“What an idiot . After advancing to Life Star, he actually thinks he’s too big to be killed . He wants to insult Long Chen to raise his own prestige while there are Netherpassage experts around . ” An old man shook his head .

“Last time, rivers of blood flowed through the Eastern Xuan City . No one was able to stop Long Chen from leaving . Does he really think such a person would allow such humiliation?” A Life Star expert sighed . He was already over a hundred years old and had no hope of further advancements . He would not be the main character of this era . However, being witnesses to this era, these people had personally seen Long Chen’s rise and seen him create miracle after miracle .

Long Chen suddenly vanished from his original location . Space shook and he reappeared in front of the young man . He was like a phantom, coming and going without any warning . Although the man had been prepared, he had not expected Long Chen to be so quick . He reached out to unsheathe his sword .

At the next moment, Long Chen’s hand grabbed the sword hilt, while his other hand slapped this young man’s face .

Blood flew out of his mouth, and his teeth became free, flying through the air .

As for his sword, it had come out of its sheath and was now pressed against his forehead .

For a moment, everyone was dumbfounded . Even the Netherpassage experts were stunned . Long Chen’s speed was inconceivable . He was so fast that they couldn’t even react .

The Netherpassage experts exchanged a glance, acknowledging how serious this situation was now . Long Chen was actually able to move while completely disregarding their life and death domains .

It had to be known that Long Chen was only at the peak of Soul Transformation . For him to be able to ignore their domains was against all common sense .

“Do I know you?” asked Long Chen, still pressing the sword at the young man’s forehead .

“No... no!”

The man was now terrified, unable to speak properly . He only had one life, and now it was in Long Chen’s hands .

“To express your disdain toward me, you came here, showing off your bravery? I actually look down on and hate people like you the most . ”

Long Chen pressed forward with the sword . That person’s body shook once before he fell from the sky, his Yuan Spirit dead .

In front of Long Chen, this confident Life Star Empyrean didn’t even have the slightest ability to resist . His corpse landed on the ground, causing a burst of dust to fly into the air . Everyone’s hearts shook .

They looked at the gloomy Long Chen whose killing intent was steadily rising . Their hair stood on end .

Long Chen put away the sword . Although it was just a quasi divine item, it was still quite valuable .

Without even glancing at the Netherpassage experts, he began walking out of the city .

It was the same road, the same man walking alone . His enemies had grown even stronger, but his indomitable air was the same .

There were over ten Netherpassage experts present . They exchanged a glance, their meaning to wait until Long Chen was out of the city to attack .

If they fought within the city, they might not care about others, but they still had to worry about the Huayun Sect . The Huayun Sect might interfere under the excuse of stopping the disturbance in the city .

Long Chen walked away slowly . Under the gaze of countless experts, he walked out of the city with over ten Netherpassage experts following him .

“Attack!”

Once he was out of the city, one of the Netherpassage experts finally gave the order . Life and death energy erupted, and a sword slashed toward Long Chen .

He used his sharpest attack right from the start, clearly no longer viewing Long Chen as a Soul Transformation disciple, but a true threat .

“The battlefield hasn’t changed at all . Good, I’ll add some color this time . I think the blood of Netherpassage experts should be good . ”

Long Chen’s gaze was icy-cold, and he was filled with fury . Since they had to force him until he had no other option, they couldn’t blame him for being vicious .

Long Chen’s divine ring burst into existence behind him . He activated the Five Star Battle Armor, and white scales also appeared all over his body .

However, when those scales appeared, Long Chen’s skin split open, and his blood poured out .

“As expected, this is too much . My current physical body is still unable to summon the complete Azure Dragon Battle Armor . However, this state should be enough . ”

Long Chen glanced at the bloody scales on his body for an instant before slashing his saber at the attacking Netherpassage experts .

BOOM!

Black and white light intertwined, devouring the sky . That berserk energy caused the world to shake .

“What?!”

All the experts watching let out startled cries . They saw a Netherpassage expert actually be sent flying . He wasn’t able to receive even a single blow .

“How is that possible?!”

“Just what kind of power is that?!”

“Is this some kind of self-destructive secret art? Is he exchanging his life for power?”

Wild speculation erupted . This saber slash had surpassed the limits of their imagination . Just how was it possible for a Soul Transformation disciple to ignore two major realms and force back a Netherpassage expert?

The other Netherpassage experts attacked as well after they recovered from their shock . Rumbling rang out as Long Chen’s saber danced .

“Scram!”

Long Chen suddenly let out an angry roar, like thunder shaking the land . A qi wave containing dragon might spread, and those Netherpassage experts tumbled back .

All that remained was Long Chen standing in the sky . Evilmoon’s runes had lit up, and a dragon cry could be heard echoing through the air, resonating with heaven and earth .

“A group of early Netherpassage brats think they can block me?” sneered Long Chen . He pointed Evilmoon toward the sky . “Split the Heavens 7!”

Evilmoon rumbled as a giant saber-image tore through the clouds . The void was torn in two, and then a black river of stars crashed down .

The current Long Chen was finally able to cooperate with Evilmoon’s power . When the two of them worked together, they could unleash the full potential of the seventh form of Split the Heavens .

The Netherpassage experts’ expressions changed . They had never imagined that a Soul Transformation disciple would be capable of unleashing such a terrifying attack .

They actually felt a sensation of death from this attack as they were completely locked down . Trying to run would only send them to their deaths .

BOOM!

Over ten divine items lit up, unleashing their divine power .

The black saber-image collided with the light of those divine items . The world almost crumbled from their power . As a result, a burst of astral winds blew back the Netherpassage experts, and they were wildly coughing up blood .

“What? He actually wasn’t defeated?” Startled cries rang out . They couldn’t understand how these Netherpassage experts had been blown back despite joining forces .

Just as they were filled with disbelief, a black saber slashed down mercilessly at one of the ancient race Netherpassage experts . He was blown to bits, his Yuan Spirit annihilated . He vanished from this world . ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

Long Chen had a pair of lightning wings on his back, but he was covered in blood . His Azure Dragon Battle Armor was incomplete, and ignoring the fact that it limited his power, his body couldn’t even endure it . The backlash just now had heavily injured him .

However, this time, he was smarter . He didn’t try to heal with the primal chaos space while he had the Azure Dragon Battle Armor on . First of all, there would only be a little effect, and he would also waste a huge amount of life energy .

His whole body was wracked with pain, but he still clenched his teeth and pressed on . His lightning wings flapped, and he shot after the fleeing Netherpassage experts .

The next Netherpassage expert hastily raised his weapon upon seeing Long Chen turn to him, and as a result, his weapon was shattered along with his body .

His Yuan Spirit had just come out when one of Long Chen’s lightning wings smashed it, blowing it apart .

Long Chen had killed two Netherpassage experts in a row . However, his killing intent was still soaring, and it was as if he had forgotten his own injuries and pain . He shot after the third Netherpassage expert .

This expert was from the Xuan Beasts . He was a giant, and his movements were not nimble . Hence, he was instantly caught up to, and seeing Long Chen’s saber falling toward him, he roared, his battle-ax lighting up .

BOOM!

Evilmoon created a giant nick in the ax . At this moment, the Netherpassage expert thought that he had escaped a calamity, and he suddenly sent a kick at Long Chen . However, he had just moved when Long Chen’s left hand thrust forward, a lightning spear in his hand .

“Die!”

Thunder rumbled and lightning flashed . That Xuan Beast Netherpassage expert exploded into a rain of blood .
