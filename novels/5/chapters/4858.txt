Chapter 4847 Blood Soul Battle Armor

All eyes were fixed on the figure—none other than Devil Fall City's city lord, Xing Wujiang.

The position of city lord was not hereditary but chosen by the Square Heaven Seal. Moreover, the Square Heaven Seal’s method of choosing was very simple—the strongest of the five factions would be the city lord.

Legend had it that the Square Heaven Seal was the karmic luck divine weapon from a supreme faction back in the immemorial era. Following a bloody battle, this faction was fatally weakened and eventually split into the five factions we know today: Violet Palace Sect, Iron Blood Gate, Yellow Spring Pavilion, Heaven Heart Hall, and Xing Wujiang's Xing family.

In the decisive battle, the other four factions withdrew, leaving Devil Fall City to the Xing family—an event that marked a critical turning point for the city.

The Square Heaven Seal was suppressing a terrifying devil, leaving it unable to help the Xing family with other affairs. On the other hand, the subordinates of that devil launched a continuous assault on Devil Fall City as they tried to save their patriarch.

For tens of thousands of years, the Xing family defended Devil Fall City. Although the battle was incredibly bloody and desperate, the Xing family managed to persevere.

The devils only stopped and chose to leave when they saw that they could not take over the city. The Xing family also got a breather.

It was at this time that those people who had left Devil Fall City returned, all of them considering themselves heirs to the Square Heaven Seal.

The Xing family hated them for being traitors and were unwilling to let them inside the city. Just as another bout of conflict was about to erupt, the Square Heaven Seal transmitted its divine sense. It would permit the Violet Palace Sect, Iron Blood Gate, Heaven Heart Hall, and Yellow Spring Pavilion to oversee Devil Fall City, but the position of city lord would be given to the strongest faction. There were two conditions: the city lord had to possess the bloodline of the original master of the Square Heaven Seal, and they had to pass the Square Heaven Seal’s trial.

The first condition was satisfied by all four factions. Although their bloodlines were no longer pure, some of their ancestral blood remained.

The second requirement was more stringent. The Square Heaven Seal’s trial was absolutely terrifying. Only Heaven Saints were qualified to attempt it, and failure likely signified death.

Even so, all five factions coveted the position of the city lord. Records showed that other factions had occasionally seized the position, but most of the time, it was the Xing family who held command of the Square Heaven Seal.

According to the Square Heaven Seal’s rules, one family would be the city lord, while the other four remained defenders of the city, obligated to obey the city lord’s orders. With Xing Wujiang having no children, the other four families saw an opportunity to potentially claim the position.

Those who didn’t have the original bloodline were not qualified to inherit the Square Heaven Seal. Even if other members of the Xing family possessed the bloodline, they were deemed too weak and could be disregarded in the selection process.

As the Xing family declined in strength, the future city lord would likely come from one of the other four families. This led to a rise in arrogance among the four families, particularly in recent times, fueled by rumors of Xing Wujiang’s problem with his body.

However, when Xing Wujiang actually appeared, all of them were stunned speechless. Xing Wujiang actually looked completely healthy.

Xing Wujiang sat in his seat, looking just like a spectator. While he seemed rather lonely all by himself, he still exuded immense pressure. As he remained silent and didn’t pull down his hood, people couldn’t see his face.

However, Long Chen’s heart suddenly shook as he sensed a sharp gaze coming from beneath the cloak. His dragon blood started circulating, as did his violet blood and seven-color Supreme Blood.

Is he examining me? Long Chen narrowed his eyes, looking back fearlessly.

“Little brother, fight hard. If you win, I’ll treat you to a meal.” Xing Wujiang suddenly spoke, but his words left everyone baffled. This was all too sudden and bizarre, causing the spectators to scratch their heads.

“Then I’ll thank you in advance.”

Sensing that the city lord held no malice toward him, Long Chen nodded in acknowledgment. Xing Wujiang's words were essentially a form of support for Long Chen.

Cao Guofeng’s expression instantly sank, but he still sneered, “Win? Keep dreaming!”

Just then, Long Chen’s tablet started to flash. As Long Chen didn’t quite understand their mechanism, Lu Ziqiong hastily told him, “You’re going to be transported to the stage soon! Get into your combat state!”

The flash was a sign that he would soon be brought onto the stage. The participants had to be ready, or they would be directly crushed by the martial stage’s devil pressure.

“Ten moves?” asked Mo Nian.

“Don’t mess around,” replied Long Chen. He didn’t want to play such a senseless game, adding handicaps to himself just for fun.

Hearing their conversations, Lu Ziqiong and the others felt a chill. In those few short words, the two of them expressed something terrifying to them.

Long Chen stood up and straightened his robes a bit. After that, he stretched his waist, appearing incredibly relaxed. Just then, a ray of divine light coming from the martial stage enveloped him, and he vanished, reappearing on the stage.

Cao Shaoqing’s figure appeared there as well. However, startled cries rang out when people saw his appearance.

“Heavens, what is he wearing?” Lu Ziyu’s eyes widened.

Cao Shaoqing was clad in black armor that covered him from head to toe, with spikes protruding from his feet, fists, knees, and elbows. His helmet featured dagger-like points, giving him a menacing appearance.

This armor was pitch-black, except for the blood-colored runes carved into it. Even through the barrier, its demonic and hellish nature was evident, resembling the armor of a devil king.

“No way! The Iron Blood Gate even took out the Blood Soul Battle Armor!”

“Isn’t that their priceless treasure?” 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

“Is this a joke? If the Iron Blood Gate is going to let Cao Shaoqing use the Blood Soul Battle Armor, there’s not going to be any point in watching this fight.”

Countless whispers filled the air, with some expressing anger. Cao Shaoqing was already formidable, but with this armor, it seemed impossible for him to lose.

Suddenly, a rumbling sound echoed through the arena. The bricks of the martial stage started to glow, and a profound devilish pressure surged forth.
