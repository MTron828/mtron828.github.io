Chapter 5038 Execution Formation

Within the barrier, thirty-six of the Brahma Pill Valley’s two-vein Heaven Saints had surrounded Long Chen. The Long clan leader and the others watched from the sidelines, glaring at Long Chen as if they wanted to tear the flesh from his bones.

Although the previous battle was brief, it was exceptionally intense. All the clans had lost heaven vein experts to Long Chen, with the Zhao clan suffering the most significant blow by losing their clan leader. These experts were incredibly costly to raise, making their loss even more devastating.

The Long clan also held a similar fate. After Long Qianxue’s departure, they were reduced to just the clan leader, who glared at Long Chen with fear and fury. He had never imagined things would escalate to this point.

Long Chen watched as people left. The Heaven Overseer only departed because Long Chen had instructed him to.

Long Chen could tell that the Heaven Overseer was in pain. The latter had genuinely wanted to draw Long Chen into the Long clan, but he could only watch as the Long clan pushed Long Chen into the position of an enemy.

Long Tianrui was the last one to leave. Before going, she said, “If you agree to be mine, I can protect you with my life.”

Long Chen responded, “Go. Don’t delay things any longer.”

Long Tianrui gave Long Chen a profound look before leaving.

“Long Chen, although your sins are irredeemable, and you have opposed my Brahma Pill Valley multiple times, the Divine Venerate is merciful. If you are willing to join Pill Valley and become Lord Brahma’s loyal follower, you can escape death. Within the limitless sea of bitterness, you can return to the shore,” said the leader of the thirty-six elders.

Although he seemed to be trying to mediate things, his tone was harsh and his expression icy, indicating he knew Long Chen would not accept. He was merely going through the motions.

“My path is correct. Why would I return to the shore?” asked Long Chen. “Do not presume victory is within your grasp. Can you not see that I have been anticipating your arrival?”

When Long Chen said that, the Long clan leader and the others’ expressions changed. They suddenly recalled Long Chen had had chances to kill Ye Lingxiao and Zhao Qingtian sooner on the martial stage, but had waited for them to bring out their trump cards.

Long Chen had the power to destroy the martial stage from the start but had been in no rush to escape. After that, when surrounded by their top experts, he had a chance to flee but chose not to run. It really did seem as if he was waiting for the Brahma Pill Valley’s experts to appear.

Realizing this, the Long clan leader felt a surge of fear. He shouted, “Quick, kill him!”

“Shut your mouth! How is a single man enough to terrify you to this extent? Are you not afraid of others laughing at you?” The leader of the thirty-six elders shouted chidingly at the Long clan leader before turning back to Long Chen. “You’re the one who shouldn’t act like victory is in your grasp. There was once a youngster just as confident as you, but in the end, he died at our hands. Do you recognize this?”

As the elder took out a black shovel, Long Chen quivered. That was Mo Nian’s.

Could it be? Long Chen’s killing intent rose. He suddenly stamped down on the ground, shooting toward the elder like a bolt of lightning.

The elder sneered, “Cherish the relic of your companion!”

The elder then threw the shovel at Long Chen.

Long Chen caught it and threw it into the primal chaos space. At the same time, the elder retreated, and the thirty-six of them formed hand seals.

Thirty-six flame pillars wove together into a giant cage that fell upon Long Chen.

Long Chen’s soul shuddered when this flame cage appeared. He was surprised to sense that the full power of all thirty-six of them had been perfectly merged together.

The power of thirty-six two-vein Heaven Saints together was enough to kill Long Chen a thousand times over. Once the cage shrank, its power would grow. Thus, if he wanted to break it, he had to use brute force to crush it now.

With a roar, Long Chen concentrated all his dragon blood power into his palm. At this critical juncture, he didn’t dare to hold back.

“Sovereign Blood Seal - God Slaying Cross!”

As Long Chen ignited all his dragon blood power, the cross on his palm flashed, and he slammed it into one of the flame pillars.

Seeing Long Chen’s resistance, an elder sneered, “A mantis trying to stop a chariot. You don’t know your own power—”

BOOM!

At that moment, all their expressions changed. When Long Chen’s palm slammed into the flame pillar, a cross-shaped fissure broke it apart.

The thirty-six of them spat out blood at the same time, completely shocked.

This cage was a high-level formation technique of the Brahma Pill Valley. It merged the power of thirty-six people, and even a three-vein Heaven Saint wouldn’t be able to make it budge. Once their target was caught, they would definitely die. This technique had never failed them. After all, breaking any of the flame pillars required enduring the power of all of them.

However, Long Chen’s palm had destroyed the flame pillar, and the backlash was jointly shared by all thirty-six of them, causing them to spit out blood. Long Chen’s power exceeded their imagination.

What they didn’t know was that while Long Chen’s bloodline power was strong, and the God Slaying Cross was also domineering, those factors alone would not let him break their formation.

It was the trace of Sovereign qi on Long Chen’s palm that was the real crux behind the destruction of their formation. Unfortunately, they would never know this. As for Long Chen, he was still rather vague on the details himself.

After destroying a pillar, Long Chen charged out of their cage. Raising Evilmoon, he swung it at one of them.

“Seven Forms in One!” FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

Seeing the incoming attack, that elder shouted and formed hand seals, conjuring a flame shield in front of him that quickly formed thirty-six layers. He only condensed one, but the other elders were aiding him.

BOOM!

The flame shields exploded one after another, and Long Chen’s saber stopped less than three inches from that elder’s head, with only the final shield intact. Seeing the edge of the blade right in front of him, that elder started to sweat.

“Flame Devil Execution!” their leader shouted, and the others’ hand seals changed. The final shield in front of Long Chen exploded, and a powerful force blasted him. With a grunt, he was thrown back.

All thirty-six of them were able to share their power, making them unbeatable. Long Chen’s heart turned cold. At the same time, they formed hand seals, causing flames to rage within heaven and earth. Layers of nets were thrown at him from every direction, leaving him nowhere to run.

“Ignorant fool, since you want to die so badly, I’ll kill you right here!” the leader shouted, and his hand seals changed. All thirty-six of them started chanting.

Upon hearing that chant, Long Chen suddenly shook.
