Chapter 3418 You’re Talking Nonsense

The Sacred Pill Hall’s master continued to speak, his voice resounding throughout heaven and earth. “The nine star heirs are the scum of the world. They are another form of Heaven-Seizers, and they rely on killing others to cultivate, stealing power from others. The reason why he has such a terrifying physical body is because he has killed countless demonic beasts, taking their power for his own. His cultivation is special. It is a cultivation technique that depends on harming others to strengthen oneself, so he has slain countless lifeforms. Countless demonic beasts have been killed for his powerful physical body. This is why a little human with a weak physical body came to possess such terrifying Blood Qi.”

When the hall master’s powerful voice that was backed by his Spiritual Strength and filled with righteous indignation rang out, Long Chen finally couldn’t hold back anymore.

“What fucking nonsense!”

Just as the hall master was giving a passionate speech and the demonic beats were enraptured by his words and emotions, Long Chen’s curse struck everyone dumb.

Even Lei Yuner jumped. It was the master of the Sacred Pill Hall that Long Chen was cursing. Did he not want his life any longer?

“If you expose yourself because of me, I won’t forgive you even in my death!” The nine star heir’s howl resounded in Long Chen’s mind.

He had just implored Long Chen to endure, and not much had happened before Long Chen started cursing. So, the nine star heir was enraged.

The world fell deathly silent. Everyone’s gaze was instantly concentrated on Long Chen, and the Sacred Pill Hall’s experts were glaring at him with killing intent.

“What did you say?” The hall master coldly turned to Long Chen.

“I said that you are spouting nonsense. Who said that the human race’s physical bodies are weak? I refuse to believe this lie. Do you think all humans are as sickly as alchemists like you?” demanded Long Chen.

“How brazen!”

One of the assistant hall masters barked at Long Chen. He then cast a glance at the eight half-step World Kings, and they prepared to subdue Long Chen.

“What? Can it be that the Sacred Pill Hall will not permit others to correct their incorrect words?” sneered Long Chen.

With him saying that, the hall master narrowed his eyes. He then extended his hand, stopping the half-step World Kings. If he wanted to, he could easily subdue this youngster. But he had to have an excuse first.

“Tell me, which of my words were wrong?” demanded the hall master.

Everything was within Long Chen’s expectations. Pill Valley had been like this, and now the Sacred Pill Hall was the same. They were a bunch of sanctimonious hypocrites who wanted to be seen as saints while being thieves.

“Which words were wrong?”

BOOM!

Long Chen stamped the ground with a single foot and the earth shuddered. Cracks were spreading on this hard plaza floor, instantly going beyond the horizon.

Countless experts’ expressions changed. This plaza was backed by a formation, and it was extremely tough. They hadn’t seen Long Chen store up energy at all. So just by stamping his foot, he had unleashed such terrifying power.

“Count this as me begging you not to expose yourself!” implored the nine star heir. He knew that Long Chen was enraged. But Long Chen had only condensed up to the sixth star. If he was exposed now, he would definitely die.

Hearing that, Long Chen was enraged but he also felt terrible. He wished he could kill all these people from the Sacred Pill Hall right now. But he didn’t have that power yet.F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

He was incredibly vexed, but he knew that with so many experts present, there was nothing he could do. That feeling of powerlessness drove him mad.

“Who said that the human race had weak bodies? Hall master, are you discriminating against the human race? Or do you no longer view yourself as a human?” asked Long Chen.

“Who are you?” demanded the hall master darkly.

“I am just an ordinary human, a human that could not be more ordinary to the extent that I was even targeted by a pack of fools and made to pay a full seventy thousand immortal king crystals just to come here,” sneered Long Chen.

“Seventy thousand immortal king crystals?”

The hall master was startled and then looked at his two assistants. They were also confused, not knowing about this matter.

“What is going on?” demanded the hall master.

“Reporting… It is because… Boss Long San… cultivated all seven powers to the highest level. It was impossible to confirm his true power. Moreover, over thirty races, including the Water Mallard race, the Mammoth Divine Elephant race, the Golden Barbarian Bull race, and the Blue Eye Bright Scale race asked for him to pay the highest price…” One of the half-step World Kings nervously stepped forward. He was the one that Long Chen had paid the price to.

“So the rules of the Sacred Pill Hall can be changed so easily just by gathering a few people! What a huge joke. If you can swear on your soul that you didn’t receive any benefits from those races, I, Boss Long San, will immediately leave the Integral Heaven Star-Field!” sneered Long Chen.

Originally, he had only cursed the hall master due to his rage without considering the consequences. But following the pleading of the nine star heir, Long Chen came up with a plan to cover it up.

“I… I…”

That half-step World King had no reply. He truly had accepted bribes from those races to do this.

After that, the hall master furiously slapped the elder’s face, sending him tumbling back and coughing up blood. Startled cries then rang out.

“Bring him away! Once the matter of the Divine Lord Immortal Realm is over, cripple his cultivation base and expel him from the Integral Heaven Star-Field!” shouted the hall master.

Hearing that punishment, people’s hearts shook. That was a half-step World King! He was to be crippled? That was truly ruthless.

As for Long Chen, he sneered inside. Just who was he showing this act to? Once everyone was gone, who would know how this person would be punished? Only these brainless demonic beasts could be tricked by such a childish lie.

“Young friend, my Sacred Pill Hall has produced a degenerate. This old man will apologize to you as a representative of the Sacred Pill Hall. Our reputation cannot be soiled by anyone. We will return your ticket price.” The hall master turned to Long Chen and handed a spatial ring to him with an amicable smile. “It was my Sacred Pill Hall that was wrong in this matter. All the consequences will be borne by us. You can enter the Divine Lord Immortal Realm with a peaceful heart.”

Long Chen received the spatial ring under the envious gazes of quite a few people. That was seventy thousand immortal king crystals. It was no small sum.

Wu Ying and the others were particularly enraged. Their attempt at conning Long Chen had only ended up with him getting free entrance.

Long Chen saw the hidden killing intent within the hall master’s amicable smile. It seemed like he was not planning on letting Long Chen leave alive. That was the only reason he had said such nice words. It was just for others to see. He was truly a wily fox. This further set the Sacred Pill Hall up as a righteous and glorious place.

Long Chen simply smiled as he took the spatial ring, not even bothering to say thanks. That arrogant rudeness of his even angered the demonic beasts as they felt that he had gone too far.

As for the hall master, he acted indifferent to it. With this done, he looked around and focused on the nine star heir once more.

“Demon, you killed countless lifeforms! You are the very definition of evil. Your crimes cannot be atoned for no matter what. Today, I will represent all living creatures beneath the heavens in carrying out your execution! Do you have any last words?”
