Chapter 2576 When the Old Tiger’s Not at Home

“Fatal weakness? Tell us!” exclaimed Qu Jianying.

“The Blood race relies entirely on their bloodline power. While fighting, their blood starts flowing inconceivably fast. Hence, being poisoned is fatal to them. Due to how rapidly their blood flows, as soon as the poison enters their bloodstream, they’ll die before having a chance to expel it. You all saw how they died after they touched the poison from my bombs, right?” said Long Chen.

When they had seen those Blood race experts collapse in numbers, they had been startled, but they hadn’t noticed why. Only now did they suddenly recall that it was a bit odd.

This could be considered a major difference between the Blood race and the human race. Since they relied on their bloodline power to fight, a touch of poison could instantly spread throughout their entire body.

On the other hand, the human race’s power was spread through the essence, qi, and spirit. The essence represented essence blood, which was Spirit Blood, and this was just a supportive power. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

As a result, when it came to resisting poison, the human race was far superior to the Blood race. Based on Long Chen’s original expectations, after being poisoned, there should have been many Blood race experts screaming in pain, which would impact their confidence. But their poison resistance was so low that they had directly died without having a chance to scream for long. Because of this, he couldn’t achieve his original goal, but he had found a fatal weakness.

“This truly is a fatal weakness. But why has such a weakness not been noticed in the past?” wondered one person.

“Senior Heavenly Feather said that the Blood race has many branches. In order to prevent us from seeing through them, they are most likely switching between various races to attack us. That way, it’s useless even if we grasp their weaknesses, because next time, it won’t be the same attackers,” said Li Tianxuan slowly.

That was the only reasonable explanation. If the Blood race really had such a fatal weakness, then considering the past dark eras, someone must have noticed it.

“Perhaps my luck is good and I encountered the weak generation?” laughed Long Chen.

“It’s just unknown whether or not different branches will come after we counter this wave… cough, I’m not trying to jinx it. Don’t take it seriously,” said a sect leader, hastily apologizing in the middle when he saw the others’ expressions change.

He had just been casually wondering, but Long Chen couldn’t possibly take it casually. With his luck, anything could happen. It seemed that the chances of getting an advantage like this were incredibly low considering his luck…

“No, you are very reasonable. This is very likely, so we can’t take them lightly,” said Long Chen solemnly.

This sect leader was moved to have Long Chen treat him respectfully as a senior. Would the likes of Feng Fei, Zhao Ritian, Ye Liangchen, Jiang Wuchen, Long Aotian, Ye Ming, and the others treat him like that? When speaking to them, he had to look up at them.

On the other hand, Long Chen treated him and everyone else sincerely. It was not artificial at all. He truly viewed him as a senior.

Because of this, let alone the hot-blooded youngsters, even old fellows like them were willing to spill blood for such a figure.

Other than the Sovereigns, who else had this charisma? However, Long Chen wasn’t even a Sovereign sprout. It was quite the conundrum.

“Long Chen is correct. We absolutely cannot be careless against these invaders. The Martial Heaven Continent is powerful, but we have trouble on the inside as well. We have to maintain our highest state of vigilance,” said Qu Jianying.

“Alliance head, the divine families have left along with their defensive formations. Since we have to stand guard over the Yin Yang World ourselves, we need to construct several transportation formations,” said someone.

Qu Jianying nodded. “We cannot count on the divine families, so we need to rely on ourselves. They are actually so petty that they just suddenly abandoned their defensive post. They don’t care about the big picture. We can’t leave our backs to them. Sect master Qi, I’ll leave this matter to you. Set up three main formations and eight emergency formations. As for what type and scale, you don’t need me to go into details, right?” said Qu Jianying.

That sect master Qi nodded. “After following you for so many years, have I ever disappointed you? Don’t worry, it shall be done.”

“Good. The Blood race definitely won’t undergo any large-scale assaults during this time, but we must be on guard. Disciples that are no longer in seclusion should join us on the battlefield,” said Qu Jianying.

Daoist Heavenly Feather suddenly said, “Warn all the disciples not to enter the Yin Yang World, even if the Blood race provokes them. The entire Yin Yang World is covered by their world divine item. Going over would be risking death for nothing.”

Since even Daoist Heavenly Feather had been injured by that mysterious attack, anyone else would definitely die. Because of this, she was worried that some prideful disciples might charge over, sacrificing their lives for nothing.

Although such a terrifying attack was not for those ordinary disciples, entering the Yin Yang World was entering the enemies’ home territory. Everything was within their control, so it would still be suicide.

Long Chen looked at the entrance to the Yin Yang World and then stared at the mist. As a giant egg entered his mind, he sighed. He had no idea how Little Snow was.

They had been apart for so many years. Last time, Little Snow had taken the curse meant for him and died. Just thinking about it brought him pain.

Regretfully, with the Yin Yang World locked down by that terrifying world divine item, there was definitely no way that he would be able to sneak inside again.

“Little Snow, wait for me. I’ll slaughter my way in and take you back.” Long Chen clenched his fists. Once he advanced to the Heaven Merging realm, perhaps he would be able to pull Little Snow out of the abyss.

Qu Jianying took action, making swift and decisive moves. Her followers were all extremely efficient, and the Martial Heaven Alliance’s people quickly arrived, setting up the formations.

Some disciples were also sent over to help. Everything was methodically arranged.

“Senior, are you alright?” Long Chen looked at Daoist Heavenly Feather worriedly. He noticed that she still had a faint rosiness to her face that was not normal.

“The power of that divine item is extraordinary. However, this kind of wound is nothing. Within ten days to half a month, I’ll have fully recovered,” said Daoist Heavenly Feather.

Everyone’s heart shook. Even a terrifying existence like Daoist Heavenly Feather would require recuperating for so long to recover from a single attack?

Hearing this, Long Chen felt even greater gratitude. If it hadn’t been for Daoist Heavenly Feather, that attack would have taken half his life, if not all of it.

“I’ll take my leave, so I entrust this place to you,” said Daoist Heavenly Feather.

Long Chen hastily said, “Senior, I’ll send you off.” After all, she had been injured because of him. He felt very apologetic.

“No need. You have many things to do. Don’t waste your time.” Daoist Heavenly Feather smiled kindly at him and then left.

Once Daoist Heavenly Feather left, the old man gravely said, “I’ll need to make a trip back and beat that warning into those brats. Otherwise, they’ll take far too heavy of a loss.”

The most disobedient disciples in this world belonged to the Heaven Splitting Battle Sect. Those fellows were capable of doing anything.

“Old man, the situation is pressing. Can you teach me the ninth form of Split the Heavens? Whether or not I can learn it, I need to try. What if I’m one of those amazing geniuses that instantly masters it?” said Long Chen.

Right now, the door to the Yin Yang World had been blown open, and Devil Spirit Mountain’s Sovereign seal would probably fully vanish within a few days. The Martial Heaven Continent didn’t have the time to wait.

The old man hesitated. Finally, he said, “Fine. I’ll teach it to you. But don’t get your hopes too high. I estimate that your chances of learning it are extremely low. We can try though so that you don’t get hung up on this matter.”

Hearing this, Long Chen was delighted. At the same time, Qu Jianying shook her head but didn’t say anything. She didn’t seem to have much hope for Long Chen to be able to learn it.

Qu Jianying stayed behind, temporarily not returning to the headquarters because she had many things to handle. And at this moment, Ye Lingshan was leading her people here.

As for the Nangong family, Beitang family, Xuan Beasts, and Mo Gate, Qu Jianying didn’t request any help from them. The Martial Heaven Alliance only mobilized a portion of their forces, with most of them being seniors. They were still giving the junior generation of disciples as much time to cultivate as possible. Hopefully, they would be ready to attempt breaking through the Heaven Merging realm as soon as possible.

When the moment was ripe, they could make their breakthroughs, which would allow the Martial Heaven Continent’s power to instantly soar.

With Qu Jianying personally watching over the Yin Yang World, Long Chen had no need to worry about it. As for Devil Spirit Mountain, the Sovereign seal had yet to fully break, so only Li Tianxuan brought a group to stand guard over it.

With everything having been arranged, Long Chen and the old man returned to the Heaven Splitting Battle Sect. But as soon as they approached, they heard shouting and cursing from the plaza.

Boss Bao was currently glaring at Bao Buping. It seemed that Boss Bao was thinking of giving him a beating, but Bao Buping was already an expert at the fourth step of Netherpassage. Boss Bao seemed unable to sort him out, so he had to use his throat.

“How many times have I told you to wait for the news from the old man? Are you trying to revolt?!” roared Boss Bao.

“Unacceptable, we can’t wait that long. We weren’t able to give a proper display in the Star Field Divine World, weakening the prestige of the Heaven Splitting Battle Sect. This time, we have to put on a good show!” said Bao Buping, sticking out his neck stubbornly.

“Little brat, your wings have grown so you’re not going to listen, is that it? You dare to disobey the orders of the old man?” raged Boss Bao. Since he was unable to suppress Bao Buping, he could only use the old man.

“Hmph, I’ve remembered every single one of that old man’s beatings. Sooner or later, I’ll return them all. I’m already a fourth step Netherpassage expert. When I have the time, we’ll have to consider whether or not it’s time for him to give up his sect master position… ow!”

Bao Buping suddenly felt a sharp pain on his butt and was sent flying by a cane. The old man appeared in front of them.

“Little brat, you think you can flip the heavens already? I’ll give you your chance right now. If you beat me, the Heaven Splitting Battle Sect is yours.”
