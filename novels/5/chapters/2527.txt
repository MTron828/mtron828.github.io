Chapter 2517 Little Pretty Boy?

Long Chen’s soul energy began to circulate. Using the karmic hell flames within his primal chaos space as the connection, he formed a spiritual bridge with the karmic flames burning the altar.

An image of a dragon appeared on his forehead. That was Huo Linger’s dragon form. A ball of flames burned around her.

Using the nine star World Extermination Flame Lotus had sucked away almost all her energy. She was no longer able to show her true form outside. However, she could recuperate within the primal chaos space.

Although Huo Linger had not absorbed the karmic hell flames, there was now a slight connection between the two. There was also a connection between the karmic hell flames he had released upon the altar and the karmic hell flames in the primal chaos space.

By using that connection, he was able to feed his Spiritual Strength to the karmic flames on the altar. Those flames intensified.

Black marks began to appear on the altar as if it was being incinerated.

Ye Ming began to panic. If this continued, the altar would be too damaged to ever revive the Heaven Devouring Fiend King again.

Ye Ming’s call made Feng Fei, the Pill Fairy, and Zhao Ritian raise their weapons against Long Chen.

In his current state, he could not be disturbed by others. He couldn’t even afford the distraction. That would cut off his connection to the karmic flames. Then he wouldn’t be able to form that connection again because Ye Ming would not give him a second chance.

“Dragonblood Legion, full defense! Six Fold Heavenly Resistance Formation!”

Xia Chen took out a formation disc, and light began to shine on top of it. With Long Chen at the center, a light appeared above, below, behind, in front, left, and right of him.

Those six spots then radiated light, forming a giant sphere protecting Long Chen. It was like a star.

The Dragonblood warriors began to split up, entering the giant sphere and standing within certain places in the light, forming a curious protective sphere.

“I’ll keep handling Feng Fei.” Mo Nian took a deep breath and went to stop Feng Fei. After fighting her for so long, he was profoundly aware of how powerful she was.

Despite using his full power, he was unable to get an advantage over her. Now he understood how powerful the divine families’ Sovereign sprouts were.

“Little dwarf, let’s continue!” Wilde stuffed his face with meat and then charged at Zhao Ritian.

Yun Tian also attacked. His sword unleashed a wave of sparkling divine light that illuminated the sky. With a single step, he appeared in front of the Pill Fairy.

The Daynight Furnace floated above the Pill Fairy’s head. Holding the Brahma Divine Diagram, she summoned divine light that swept toward Yun Tian like a river of stars.

“I won’t fall for the same move twice.” Yun Tian’s sword suddenly pierced toward a certain spot in the sky.

BOOM!

The Brahma Divine Diagram shook intensely. The river of stars vanished. This time, the Brahma Divine Diagram failed to suck Yun Tian into its world. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

The Pill Fairy was shocked, but just at that moment, Yun Tian’s sword was pointed at her head. His sword appeared slow but was actually quick as lightning.

“Good sword technique.” Yue Zifeng couldn’t help nodding his head. Of everyone here, only Yue Zifeng was able to see just how profound this sword technique of Yun Tian’s was.

The Pill Fairy’s expression changed. She took seven steps back, every step just barely avoiding Yun Tian’s sword. As the two of them moved, it revealed the foundation of a true expert.

On the eighth step, the Pill Fairy finally had a chance to strike back. The Daynight Furnace smashed down, and sparks flew as it blocked Yun Tian’s sword.

After finally stabilizing her position, the Pill Fairy realized that the seven steps she had resulted in her crossing thousands of miles and leaving the battlefield. Yun Tian’s attack had clearly contained some kind of spatial law.

“As expected of a Sovereign’s son.” The Pill Fairy stared coldly at Yun Tian, filled with shock.

When Yun Tian had been chasing down Ye Ming, she, Zhao Ritian, and Feng Fei hadn’t been using their full power against him. Their goal had really been to benefit from their fight.

Ye Ming was the one enduring most of Yun Tian’s attacks. They just needed to make sure that he didn’t die. It was only when he was in danger that they would interfere.

They had exhausted the majority of Yun Tian’s energy on the way here. They had thought that he would be out of energy.

However, in her battle with him, she had found that the more energy he used up, the longer the rest of his energy seemed to last him. It was absolutely bizarre.

Even within the Brahma Divine Diagram, with absolute advantage, the Pill Fairy hadn’t been able to defeat him.

Now, without the advantage of the home territory of the Brahma Divine Diagram, Yun Tian was even more terrifying.

“You overpraise me. Your double god seals have already formed. To become a god in the future will be effortless for you. If you didn’t have mercy, I wouldn’t have been able to last. Why don’t the two of us come to a pause and just watch?” Yun Tian suddenly sheathed his sword and smiled at the Pill Fairy.

The Pill Fairy was startled. “What do you mean?”

“I’m saying that you don’t attack Long Chen, and I won’t help Long Chen. The two of us can just watch. How’s that?”

“Are you saying that you’ll just watch even if Long Chen is going to die?” The Pill Fairy narrowed her eyes.

“Of course. He is the main character of this place. I can only help him. My mission is to help him block one powerful opponent. The ultimate victory or defeat is up to him. So as long as you don’t interfere, I won’t interfere either,” said Yun Tian.

“I know your power is not limited to just this. Fine, I will trust that a Sovereign’s son will not be a little person who breaks his word. We can watch together.” The Pill Fairy put away the Daynight Furnace and the Brahma Divine Diagram, as well as her manifestation.

“Many thanks.”

Yun Tian cupped his fists slightly. There was a hard-to-describe nobility about his actions that involuntarily inspired reverence.

The Pill Fairy nodded. She no longer put up any guard against him. The Sovereigns were supreme existences. As a Sovereign’s son, Yun Tian definitely wouldn’t sneak attack her.

Seeing the two of them stop fighting and return to the battlefield together, everyone fighting was shocked. What was going on?

“Yu Qingxuan, have you been seduced by that little pretty boy? What are you doing? Kill him!” roared Zhao Ritian.

This roar made a layer of frost appear on the Pill Fairy’s face. “Shut your dog mouth, or I don’t mind changing sides and killing a dislikeable dwarf.”

“You…!” Zhao Ritian was infuriated but didn’t dare to say another word. He really was afraid of the Pill Fairy switching sides.

He was no fool. Seeing that Yun Tian was also not fighting, he could guess what was going on. Ignoring the Pill Fairy, he smashed the Heaven Suppressing Dragon Coiling Rod at Wilde and knocked him back.

The two of them were originally evenly matched, but due to the World Extermination Flame Lotus exposing and refining the land’s immortal metal for him to absorb, he had rapidly recovered the energy he had spent.

On the other hand, Wilde had eaten some meat just now, but he hadn’t managed to fully recover. Wilde’s power was gradually starting to fall in comparison to Zhao Ritian’s.

Wilde roared furiously and charged back. However, Zhao Ritian still managed to charge over to the Dragonblood Legion’s defenses.

“All of you laughable ants can die!” Zhao Ritian forced Wilde back once more and smashed his rod at the Dragonblood warriors.

“You think you can sneer at the Dragonblood Legion? Have a look at our true power.” Guo Ran’s voice rang out. Suddenly, every Dragonblood warrior’s position shifted. Guo Ran appeared in front of Zhao Ritian and slashed his dual sabers at him.

“Even an ant dares to be arrogant? How laughable.” Zhao Ritian sneered, refusing to believe that Guo Ran could receive his attack.

BOOM!

Zhao Ritian’s rod smashed into Guo Ran’s sabers. However, curiously, his full power rapidly dispersed.

The spherical formation that the Dragonblood warriors were in sunk, resulting in the majority of his power dissipating.

The sphere suddenly swelled back, and an irresistible power sent Zhao Ritian flying.

“What?” Zhao Ritian was shocked. The power that had bounced him back was his own metal energy. In other words, the Dragonblood Legion’s formation was capable of absorbing his energy to strike back at him.

As Zhao Ritian was blown back, he forgot that Wilde was behind him. Wilde immediately smacked the back of Zhao Ritian’s head with the door bolt.

Zhao Ritian’s head was completely deformed, and he was sent flying back to the Dragonblood Legion.

“I don’t want his head, I want a leg!”

The sound of a sword unsheathing rang out, mixed in with Guo Ran’s shout. A ray of Sword Qi shot out of the formation.

The Sword Qi accurately landed on Zhao Ritian’s leg. However, his leg was too thick, and the Sword Qi failed to fully cut off his leg. However, his leg now drooped.

Just at that moment, countless willow branches shot out like tentacles, wrapping around that leg and pulling fiercely.

The prepared Guo Ran swung his sabers. With an explosive sound, the leg was torn off.

From the moment Guo Ran sent him flying back to Wilde’s door bolt, Yue Zifeng’s sword slash, Liu Ruyan’s pull, and then Guo Ran’s follow-up, only the time for a blink of an eye had passed.

Zhao Ritian’s mind was still muddled from being struck in the head by Wilde. By the time he reacted, one of his legs had left his body.

“You damn bandits, you won’t have good deaths!” Zhao Ritian roared furiously. Gnashing his teeth so hard that they creaked, he charged at the Dragonblood Legion once more.
