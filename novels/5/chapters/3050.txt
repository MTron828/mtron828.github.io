Chapter 3039 Choosing a Suitable Person

“It’s fine. We’ve entered the High Firmament Academy’s barrier. I stopped the chariot to let you rest longer.” Bai Shishi turned from the window and looked at him.

“Good.” Long Chen took a deep breath and sighed. He then rubbed his face, feeling so much better after that sleep.

“What are you looking at me for?” Long Chen cocked his head at Bai Shishi. She seemed to be wearing a smile that was not a smile.

Bai Shishi said, “You were acting weird in your sleep. Sometimes you cried, sometimes you laughed. Like you’re a fool.”

“Nonsense,” said Long Chen. But his words lacked confidence.

“Not only that, but you were also talking. You shouted many names.” Bai Shishi leaned closer toward Long Chen. Her eyes were like stars staring at Long Chen, as if wishing to see through his secrets.

“Are you getting so close because you want me to kiss you? I didn’t expect that you were such a person!” Long Chen looked at her guardedly.

Bai Shishi was a bit angry, but she quickly smiled. “I know you’re just trying to anger me. So I won’t get angry.”

“What did I say in my sleep?” asked Long Chen.

“I’m not telling you.” Bai Shishi raised her eyebrows and smiled mischievously. It was as if she had won, so she was delighted.

“Tch, so you were just lying?” Long Chen snorted disdainfully.

“Is that so? Tell me, who is Chu Yao? Who is Meng Qi?” Bai Shishi grew even more pleased.

Long Chen started. Was he really sleep talking? How else would she know those names? He had no idea what he had said in his sleep, or if he had divulged any secrets.

Long Chen’s bewildered expression drew out Bai Shishi’s laughter. She smiled brilliantly. That feeling of success was even more delightful than when she had awoken her divine abilities.

Long Chen wanted to figure out what he had said, but how could he have known that he had actually only said Chu Yao and Meng Qi, and that was it? The crafty light in her eyes made Long Chen feel strange.

“You have so many women. I don’t understand how a weirdo like you got so many women to fall for you. Do they have a problem with their aesthetics?” asked Bai Shishi.

Long Chen clenched his teeth. She was getting payback for his teasing. But who was he? He knew just what to do.

He eyed Bai Shishi and indifferently said, “My charisma is simply amazing. I don’t dare to show my strong points to others now. It would be best if you get further away from me, or if you end up falling for me as well, you’d be doomed. All my women are as beautiful as heavenly fairies and have peerless aptitude. With your looks and talent, you’d probably only be able to become a bed warmer.” F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

However, Bai Shishi didn’t get angry. She smiled. “I have a bit of confidence in my looks and talent. You won’t be able to anger me like that. Furthermore, I, Bai Shishi, dislike men, especially such unfaithful, fickle men. As long as a woman is strong enough, she has no need for the lifeform known as a man.”

“I can’t be bothered to argue with a child’s perspective,” said Long Chen. It seemed that Bai Shishi had a problem in her heart. She had a certain prejudice against men. According to Bai Xiaole, she was also extremely cold to her father. They almost never spoke.

Bai Shishi sent the chariot flying toward the academy. The academy quickly received word, and Luo Bing, Luo Ning, Mu Qingyun, Bai Xiaole, and the others all came to welcome them. Millions of inner academy disciples cheered for their return.

It had already been two days since Bai Xiaole and the others had returned to the academy. Hence, the shocking battle of the Jialin Immortal Land had already been spread to all the other disciples with the most brilliant narratives.

That battle was innately an extremely heart-moving story, but through their words and additions, Bai Shishi and Long Chen were described as peerless battle gods who had descended to wipe out their enemies.

Just one day ago, the High Firmament Academy received word that the Golden Bell Gate had been wiped out. It was forever gone from this world.

Bai Xiaole declared that it was definitely done by Long Chen. Long Chen had the Heaven Merging Stone Spirit, and this trump card had yet to be used. Hearing that Long Chen had wiped out the entire Golden Bell Gate, these disciples grew even more admiring of him.

Long Chen was too domineering. He didn’t only kill all the disciples of the five powers, but he even chased them back to their nest and wiped them out. His revenge didn’t wait for a single night. Just how domineering was that?

Thus, when people received word that Bai Shishi’s chariot had returned, all the inner academy’s disciples almost came out. This was the welcome of the returning heroes.

“Are you very moved?” asked Bai Shishi.

“It’s alright. I’m used to it.” Long Chen waved his hand.

At this time, the Heaven Female Alliance’s disciples swarmed over Bai Shishi. They were extremely moved to see that she was safe and sound. It could be seen just how important she was in their hearts.

Bai Shishi comforted them and directly left just like that with them. She didn’t even say goodbye to Long Chen, as if she didn’t know him.

“Boss, are you alright?” Bai Xiaole supported Long Chen, seeing that he was still a bit pale.

“It’s fine. I suffered a minor injury against the master of the Golden Bell Gate. It’s not important,” said Long Chen without reddening in the slightest.

In any case, no matter what he said, Bai Xiaole would believe it. But Luo Bing was aware that he was just bragging. Anyway, they were all relieved to see him return alive.

“Senior apprentice-brother Long Chen, the fact that we could return alive is all thanks to you. This favor…” said an inner academy disciple who rushed over emotionally.

“You’re wrong. You returned alive thanks to yourself. After all, at that time, you chose to believe me. That required its own courage. You made the correct choice at the right time, and you all heroically slew your enemies on the battlefield. Every single one of you is a hero. This victory doesn’t belong to any one person; it belongs to all of us, including the warriors of the High Firmament Academy who fought to the death. You are all the future pillars of the academy. The fact that you didn’t fall during that battle also indicates that you are raising the flag of the High Firmament Academy’s resurgence. Work hard, brothers.”

These words moved them immensely, so they let out heaven-shaking cheers. Long Chen’s words were the greatest acknowledgment. To receive the acknowledgment of an expert like Long Chen was their life’s greatest honor.

In the distance, Heaven Master Yun Yang, Heaven Master Dong Ming, the head judge, and the others watched. Heaven Master Yun Yang smiled. “Some people are natural leaders. They possess a charisma that makes others willing to fight to the death for them. Such a charisma is simply innate. Although Shishi is powerful, ultimately, her talent lies in being a general, not the commander in chief.”

An Elder came running over. “Reporting to Heaven Master, the vice dean requests to see you. He says that the Clear River Palace, Nine Cauldron Church, Silver Moon City, and Amethyst Heart Island’s big figures have come.”

“Oh?”

Heaven Master Yun Yang and the others exchanged a look. He smiled. “Alright, now there will be a good show.”

“Other than that, the vice dean said that he won’t be receiving them. If you are also unwilling to receive them, he says that you can choose a suitable person instead,” said the Elder.

“Choose a suitable person?”

Heaven Master Yun Yang was startled. They all looked at the distant Long Chen and then started laughing.
