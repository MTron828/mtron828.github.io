Chapter 4318: Taking Inventory

“We’re rich, we’re rich!”

The three of them went through multiple spatial transportations before coming to an extremely well-hidden location. After setting up an illusion formation, this place was fully safe, and the three of them finally had a chance to shout and cheer to unleash the joy in their hearts.

“With all these primal chaos spirit stones, even if we encounter an Eternal expert, I’ll just blast them with money!” shouted Xia Chen.

“I still can’t do that yet. I have to create a new set of battle armor first. But once I become a World King, I’ll definitely have the power to challenge Eternal experts!” said Guo Ran confidently.

All these immortal metals and divine materials were now in Guo Ran’s hands, with some divine metals so obscure that even Guo Ran couldn't identify them by name.

With so many materials, let alone creating a single set of armor, Guo Ran could even create a million of them and still have plenty left over. The problem was that he still didn’t have the ability to forge an Eternal battle armor.

As for primal chaos spirit stones, they chose to divide them up evenly. As a result, each of them now had an ocean’s worth of spirit stones.

“Let’s see what’s on the bone books. Maybe there’s something we can use right now,” said Long Chen.

This was a rare moment of safety in this world, so the three of them finally had a chance to study the bone books.

“Heaven Battling Divine Scroll!”

Upon seeing this, Long Chen’s heart quivered with astonishment. The very first ancient tome he had chosen was actually the secret art of the Heaven Battling Divine Sect. Just from its name, he knew it had to be one of the core techniques of the sect.

“Three Fold Storm Slash. This is a Battle Skill.” Xia Chen picked up an ancient tome and shook his head. He wasn’t interested in this at all.

Every bone book was wrapped in a sphere of light, and they had to send their divine sense inside just to learn the title. However, actually cultivating it would require their souls to enter the bone book.

This was an extremely ancient inheritance technique. It was extremely effective, but if a person’s Spiritual Strength wasn’t strong enough, their soul would be thrown into disarray trying to read it. They could even die.

“The Item Forging Divine Sect’s Item Forging Spirit Mark Chapter! This is precisely the treasure that we wanted!” Guo Ran suddenly jumped up.

Xia Chen was also delighted to hear that. This was just what they needed. “Quick, let me take a look!”

“Don’t start cultivating here. The Spiritual Strength inside this bone book is too powerful, and I’m worried you won’t be able to endure it. Let’s first sort these things out. When the time comes, I’ll help you read through them,” said Long Chen.

It was only then that Xia Chen and Guo Ran suppressed their excitement and continued going through the books. These bone books held a treasure trove of invaluable secrets, encompassing cultivation techniques, Battle Skills, divine abilities, as well as tomes on alchemy, item-forging, inscriptions, formations, and an array of other subjects like feng shui, divination, astrology, and beyond.

Over seventy percent of them were related to cultivation techniques, Battle Skills, and divine abilities, encompassing hundreds of martial disciplines. It could be said that they really comprised a comprehensive compendium of knowledge. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

Among these, there were records of dozens of Eternal experts, detailing their step-by-step journeys toward attaining Eternity. These records held inestimable value.

After sorting out everything, Xia Chen and Guo Ran picked out forty-seven bone books for themselves. They were all related to their professions, including item-forging, inscriptions, formations, runes, mechanisms, hidden weapons, puppets, battleships, and more.

Seeing their enthusiasm, Long Chen was worried that the two of them wouldn’t have enough Spiritual Strength to read the bone books. Thus, the three worked together to read their contents.

As the bone books lit up, Long Chen felt a stabbing pain in his soul. These bone books were even more potent than he had expected.

Both Xia Chen and Guo Ran also felt a burst of pain. If Long Chen hadn’t blocked the first wave of the impact, they wouldn’t have been able to endure.

The next moment, energy entered their minds through the bone books, causing countless scenes to appear. Long Chen saw runes flying about, as well as figures wielding hammers and striking new weapons. They then branded runes into those weapons.

The scenes were very chaotic and mixed, causing Long Chen’s head to ache. He couldn’t understand them.

On the other hand, Xia Chen and Guo Ran were both quivering with anticipation. Just because Long Chen couldn’t understand the contents didn’t mean they couldn’t either. These images were branded into their memories indelibly.

Three full days slipped by, and Long Chen’s face turned as pale as paper. He had exhausted most of his Spiritual Strength, but thanks to him, Xia Chen and Guo Ran had now read all their bone books. What truly mattered was that Xia Chen and Guo Ran had firmly memorized them all.

“Boss, thank you!” Seeing how pale Long Chen was, Guo Ran immediately thanked him. After all, Long Chen had taken the brunt of the spiritual impact while the two of them benefited.

“Don’t say such meaningless words. You’re going to give me goosebumps,” said Long Chen as he took out a medicinal pill to recover his Spiritual Strength. He asked, “So, did you two gain anything?”

“I gained a lot.”

“An unimaginable amount.”

The two of them were excited by what they had learned. Guo Ran said, “Boss, when we return to the Nirvana Overflow Heaven, I will forge a half-step Eternal divine weapon for every single Dragonblood warrior. Then, we will sweep through the world.”

“Is it not possible to forge true Eternal weapons?” asked Long Chen.

“Eternal divine weapons require spirits, and there are several methods to imbue them. However, the forger must be at least at the half-step Eternal realm to do so. Even if I successfully undergo the next tribulation, I’ll only be a World King. That’s too far from the Eternal realm. However, don’t worry. I will forge weapons that can advance. As long as our brothers work hard enough to nourish them, these weapons will generate their own spirits, and over time, they will transform into genuine Eternal divine weapons that match their masters. This way, our brothers will be able to unleash the full power of their Eternal divine weapons,” said Guo Ran confidently.

Long Chen nodded. That confidence of Guo Ran’s meant that he really was sure of himself.

“Xia Chen, what about you?” asked Long Chen.

“I’ll keep it secret for now. Hehe, when the time comes, I’ll give you a nice surprise,” chuckled Xia Chen.

“Little fellow, you’re learning how to act low-key, huh?” laughed Long Chen.

Xia Chen was a man of few words, but his actions spoke volumes. He had a knack for consistently delivering pleasant surprises to Long Chen.

“Boss, are we leaving? Or should we play around with the geniuses here?” asked Guo Ran.

“We’re not leaving, but we don’t have time to play with them. We’re going somewhere important,” said Long Chen.

“Where?”

“The place we’re going to was mentioned by that idiot Kunpeng: the primal chaos eye.”
