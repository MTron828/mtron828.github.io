Chapter 3667

This person was precisely the master of the Nine Underworld Hall, Liao Bencang. He actually appeared here.

Long Chen’s heart sank. Didn’t Liao Bencang always stay in the headquarters of the Nine Underworld Hall? How could he appear here? ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

According to the memories he had gained from the Nine Underworld Luocha’s soul, Liao Bencang had to stay in the Nine Underworld Palace of the Heaven Gathering Mountain. That was the headquarters of the Nine Underworld Hall.

The faith energy of the Nine Underworld Hall’s countless believers was concentrated there. It was his cultivation land for gathering faith energy, so he wouldn’t leave it for nothing.

For this fellow to come to the Nine Underworld Island filled Long Chen with worry. Although he had once slain Liao Bencang’s avatar, that was an avatar that had descended across heavens. Its power was greatly reduced. There was no way to describe just how much weaker an avatar was compared to the true body.

“Reporting to the palace master, this is our first batch of disciples to pass the killing trial in this generation,” said an elder reverently.

Liao Bencang’s gaze swept over everyone. When his divine sense swept over Long Chen, he paused slightly.

Just as he was about to speak, the gate beside the lightning pool opened and thousands of disciples walked in, led by a World King. He then bowed to Liao Bencang.

“Palace master, the disciples that passed the trial are all here. Of the thirty million disciples, a total of eight thousand nine hundred and seventy-two passed. Please look over them.”

Only eight thousand nine hundred and seventy-two passed from thirty million disciples. Long Chen gasped inside. The Nine Underworld Hall’s trials were too bloody.

This was nothing more than one branch of the Nine Underworld Hall, but it already had so many people. The Nine Underworld Hall truly had an immense foundation and power.

These eight thousand nine hundred and seventy-two people had only gained the privilege of the lightning pool tempering. After that, they had to go through the rest of the trials. It was unknown just how many of them would survive.

It could be said that the selection of the Nine Underworld Hall was incomparably cruel. But Liao Bencang actually had so many followers. If it was someone else who did this, they would have long since run out of believers.

“Greetings, palace master!”

Those disciples all knelt on the ground. The person before them was their god, so these disciples that were normally numb to everything finally showed some emotion. Their gazes were full of fanatical worship.

In their hearts, Liao Bencang was an incomparable existence. He was their faith; he was what they entrusted their very souls to. They were fearless toward death because they knew that they would return to the embrace of their god after dying. That was their final home.

Liao Bencang nodded and smiled at those disciples with gratification. “Not bad. This generation’s essence, qi, and spirit are excellent. There have been great advancements in terms of the physical body in particular. It seems that you, Chen Ming, have put in a great deal of effort. There are two people in the pool with exceptionally powerful Blood Qi. One of them even has the aura of a Supreme Bone on him, so it is very likely that he is on the verge of awakening the Supreme Bone. When the trial is over, bring the two of them over to see me. If they meet my standards, I’ll take them as personal disciples.”

Liao Bencang pointed to Guo Ran and Long Chen’s bodies that were floating in the pool. Clearly, he had sensed that the two of them were different as soon as he arrived.

Long Chen continued to float there motionlessly. But inside, his heart was shaking. He already had Lei Linger cover up his, Guo Ran, and Xia Chen’s aura. They were fully merged into the lightning sea just to prevent anyone from seeing any clues.

But unexpectedly, this was unable to fool Liao Bencang. He instantly sensed that Guo Ran’s aura was different. Perhaps if it weren’t for Lei Linger’s protection, Guo Ran’s identity would have been exposed.

Hearing that Liao Bencang might take them as personal disciples, the other disciples were all envious. As for that World King named Chen Ming, he hastily said, “If these two can enter your eyes, that would truly be a blessing for them. Don’t worry, I will definitely look after them well.”

At this moment, the second group of disciples also entered the lightning pool, receiving its tempering. Watching as everything went as expected, Chen Ming asked, “Palace master, why did you come here personally?”

Clearly, even this World King was unable to comprehend why Liao Bencang had shown up here.

Liao Bencang said, “The Star Peering Heavenly Mirror has given off some strange ripples, and the Star Peering Space suddenly produced a great deal of death qi. That’s why I came to take a look.”

“Death qi?! Impossible! I just checked it half a month ago! It must have been my mistake. Palace master, please forgive me!” Chen Ming quivered.

It had to be known that the Star Peering Heavenly Mirror was one of the Nine Underworld Hall’s greatest treasures. Any careless mistake and he would definitely lose his life.

“It has nothing to do with you. The Star Peering Heavenly Mirror’s problem has just occurred and I’ve already erased the death qi.” Liao Bencang waved his hand dismissively.

Chen Ming sighed with relief since Liao Bencang wasn’t blaming him. But he was still confused. “How can death qi appear within the Star Peering Heavenly Mirror? Is it due to the puppets sealed inside?”

“I’ve checked the puppets as well, and there is no problem with them. That death qi… it’s as if it comes from the Star Peering Heavenly Mirror itself,” said Liao Bencang solemnly.

“It comes from the Star Peering Heavenly Mirror? Wouldn’t that mean… its longevity has come to an end? But how can that be?” Chen Ming was shocked.

The Star Peering Heavenly Mirror was a divine item personally forged by Fallen Daynight. It was used to spy on the nine star heirs within the nine heavens and ten lands. However, it did not possess an item-spirit. Due to that, it should have unlimited longevity.

Normally, only a divine item with an item-spirit would have any sort of longevity. If the item-spirit was damaged, or if it failed in an attempt to break through, or if there was some change in the Heavenly Daos, there were all kinds of risks that could cause the item-spirit to die.

Before the item-spirit died, the divine item would produce death qi just like the spots that appeared on an old person as they grew old. It was a premonition of death.

However, the Star Peering Heavenly Mirror didn’t possess an item-spirit, so how could it suddenly produce death qi? This was something that Chen Ming was unable to figure out.

“I am unable to determine the reason either. But don’t worry, it has just produced the death qi. There shouldn’t be any change within the next few thousand years. When the trial ends, I will ask Fallen Daynight’s disciple to come take a look. You deal with the trial for now,” said Liao Bencang.

“Yes.”

“Speaking of which, has there been any movement from that damn fatty’s side?” asked Liao Bencang. That damn fatty he was referring to was naturally Enpuda.

“We just received some information about it. Ji Wuming has awakened dual Supreme Bones in both hands,” said Chen Ming.

“Hmph, I knew that Ji Wuming’s idiot little brother would be schemed to death by that damn fatty sooner or later,” sneered Liao Bencang.

“There’s also another piece of news. Ji Wuming’s brother died in the hands of Long Chen’s subordinate,” reported Chen Ming.

“What?! Long Chen has also come to the Violet Flame Heaven?!” Liao Bencang instantly jumped.
