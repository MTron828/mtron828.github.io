Chapter 2753 Sovereign Ye Ming

It was Ye Ming. However, when he appeared, a powerful Sovereign might radiated out of him, causing the world to shake. People’s souls involuntarily quivered in front of him.

“Impossible! It must be fake!” Guo Ran’s voice shuddered. This Sovereign aura could only be possessed by a true Sovereign. Although this Sovereign might felt a little bit different, it was definitely Sovereign might!

There was also a Sovereign crown above Ye Ming’s head, so there was no mistaking it.

Behind Ye Ming was Gui Si, the old monster that had once fought for three days and nights against Sovereign Zi Yang. Behind him was the endless army of the Undying race, and there was no way to see their true numbers.

The army of the Undying race was mostly in the mid Heaven Merging realm, but their numbers were so great that it sparked despair.

Suddenly, Long Chen’s clone disintegrated and Evilmoon once more appeared in his hand. Huo Linger also returned to his arm, along with the Demon Moon Furnace and the Heaven Flipping Seal.

Ye Ming stepped to the front of the Undying army and turned toward Long Chen. “Hahaha! I bet you didn’t expect this, did you, Long Chen? I’m already a Sovereign. I’m faster than everyone else. The Martial Heaven Continent’s star core will land in my hands. The plan of two lifetimes, the focus of tens of thousands of years, was all for today. The Martial Heaven Continent will be destroyed by my hands. There is no longer anyone in this world who can stop me. I, Ye Ming, am the ultimate winner.”

Long Chen rested Evilmoon on his shoulder. He coldly said, “I must say it really is unexpected. You spent two lifetimes and sacrificed the Corrupt God’s property to lay this path for you to ascend to the heavens in one go. Truly amazing. However, are you not afraid of the Corrupt God finding you for payment once you ascend now that you’ve destroyed their Corrupt path?”

“Do you think the Corrupt God only has this one place to nurture followers? All I did was borrow one world. The Corrupt God also wouldn’t necessarily know about it. And even then, so what? I have the support of the Undying race behind me. You think losing the little Corrupt path here is enough reason to go for an all-out war against the Undying race’s god? Cut the crap. Don’t stall. I know that you brought back the Eastern Wasteland Bell, but it’s meaningless. Without all five supreme divine items gathered, you can’t suppress the Heaven Devastating Bracelet. Furthermore, the only reason they were capable of fighting the Heaven Devastating Bracelet back then was because the Martial Heaven Continent was in its prime. Now, the Martial Heaven Continent has one foot in the grave. It cannot give the five supreme divine items enough power. Even if they were all gathered, it wouldn’t stop the destruction of the Martial Heaven Continent.”

“What bullshit! Are you blind?” cursed Guo Ran. “Did you not see that the Heaven Devastating Bracelet is no longer moving? A single Eastern Wasteland Bell is enough to suppress it all on its own!”

Guo Ran could not accept that this person that they had beaten like a dog had now become a Sovereign. In the Star Field Divine World, although there was some difference between himself and Ye Ming, he still possessed the ability to fight him. However, now? All Guo Ran’s cultivation only resulted in him reaching the ninth Heavenstage, while Ye Ming had become a Sovereign. Where was the justice in that?

“You think you’ve suppressed it? Hahaha!” Ye Ming laughed. “What a naive thought. The Heaven Devastating Bracelet has been hidden in the Martial Heaven Continent for over a hundred thousand years. Like a tumor, it has been absorbing the continent’s strength with every passing day. Now, its power has far surpassed the remaining power of the Martial Heaven Continent. Even the five Sovereigns were unable to do anything to it after exhausting all their methods. They could only slow down its speed. Now, the five Sovereigns are dead, and the Heaven Devastating Bracelet has accumulated enough power to destroy the Martial Heaven Continent. Do you think a little Eastern Wasteland Bell can suppress it? How laughable.”

“You’re spouting bullshit!” sneered Guo Ran. He intentionally quibbled meaninglessly just to stall time.

The Undying race’s attack had come out of nowhere, and many experts of the Martial Heaven Continent were still in seclusion. To call them all out and have them enter a combat-ready state would take some time.

However, Long Chen stopped Guo Ran and indicated for everyone to retreat. Just like that, he walked toward Ye Ming.

“A moth to the fire, sending itself to its own death? Are you in such a rush to die?” sneered Ye Ming.

“You are stalling. Although I don’t know why you decided to do that, I myself have decided to get things started.” Long Chen’s aura began to climb. With every step he took, his aura rose.

Even in the face of Ye Ming who had become a Sovereign, Long Chen was fearless. For some reason, after his star diagram awakened, he was filled with endless confidence. This domineering will caused him to lose any desire to be cautious.

“Haha, I didn’t expect you to see through it. But that’s fine. It still won’t change the Martial Heaven Continent’s fate. Long Chen, today I’ll return the humiliation you gave me plus the interest.”

At this moment, a blood-colored sword appeared in Ye Ming’s hand and Blood Qi erupted, dyeing the world red. When this sword came out of its sheath, a sharp aura made people’s hair stand on end. This was a peerless weapon infected by unlimited resentment.

With this sword in hand and a Sovereign crown on his head, Ye Ming was like an evil king. Terrifying ripples then spread from him, causing the Daos of the world to cry out. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

“This is the Corrupt Heaven Sword, a divine item that the Corrupt God personally made. Perhaps you don’t know, but it once tasted Sovereign Zi Yang’s blood. Using it to kill you is appropriate.” Ye Ming gazed down on Long Chen like he was an ant coming to his death.

However, Long Chen didn’t seem to see or hear Ye Ming. The rhythm of his footsteps didn’t change.

His divine ring suddenly appeared behind him, along with the star diagram. His aura erupted like a volcano.

With another step, white scales covered Long Chen’s body, forming a connection with his star diagram and divine ring.

“Evilmoon, you’ve always been complaining that my power wasn’t enough, restricting your power. Today, I think that my power is enough.”

Evilmoon quivered. The star diagram covered its pitch-black surface. It was like the cosmos’s stars were revolving within Evilmoon.

Evilmoon cried out excitedly, “Haha, you succeeded?”

Black qi gushed out of Evilmoon. From within every star in its body, it was possible to hear a furious dragon’s roar.

At this moment, endless power poured into Evilmoon’s body. With Long Chen’s boundless power, Evilmoon was free to use all its abilities. It felt like it had escaped from a swamp.

“An ant also dares to look down on a Sovereign’s might?!”

Seeing Long Chen remain indifferent even after saying so much, Ye Ming was finally angry. He then slashed his sword down, unleashing his Sovereign might.

“Six Star Battle Armor!”

Long Chen cried out. He swung Evilmoon with its endless starlight at Ye Ming’s sword.

“Nine Star Hegemon Body Art, whether or not you are truly a heaven-defying cultivation technique will be decided here.”
