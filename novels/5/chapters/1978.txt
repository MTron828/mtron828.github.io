Chapter 1968: 1968

“Haha, it’s been a while . Why don’t you come and sit over here? Things are very lively here . ” Mo Nian laughed, seeming very familiar with Hu Feng .

“No, I’ll be over there . Next time, I hope I’ll be able to treat you to some wine as thanks for your Pure Water Mercury . ” Hu Feng gracefully declined Mo Nian’s proposal .

That kind of thing couldn’t be decided randomly . If he went over there, that would be equivalent to joining the Martial Heaven Alliance’s side . Hence, he chose to sit in the neutral camp .

“Hehe, that’s fine . Let me tell you, there’s plenty of that stuff within old tombs . I can get you as much as you want . I can even sell it to you wholesale . The more you buy, the greater the discount,” said Mo Nian .

Pure Water Mercury was a very peculiar thing . It was normally used to seal stone statues or coffins . But it was unknown what Hu Feng was using such a thing for .

This kind of mercury would naturally absorb the earth’s essence to grow, but aboveground, it would absorb spiritual qi and slowly dissipate .

Mo Nian spent a great deal of time underground, so he had quite a bit of this stuff . After a coincidental encounter, Hu Feng had bought a great deal of his stock .

Originally, Mo Nian was planning on simply giving it to him, but Hu Feng had refused, insisting on buying it .

The expressions of the opposing experts sank . Mo Nian had obtained that Pure Water Mercury from their tombs . This was unbearable .

Hu Feng hadn’t expected Mo Nian to directly announce this matter to everyone . He couldn’t help being a bit embarrassed . But he didn’t say anything and sat down in the neutral camp .

“Big brother, are you very powerful?” Hu Feng had just sat down when a little girl pulled on his sleeve .

“Ah... . not very powerful . ” Hu Feng was startled . Just how was he supposed to answer this question? If he said yes, it would be showing off, if he said no, it would appear like fake modesty .

“Xuan-er, don’t cause trouble . ” Suddenly, another woman came running over, grabbing the girl . This girl was Qi Xuan, while the person pulling her was her big sister, the one who was on the same level of fame as Ye Lingshan in Clearwind City, Qi Fengxue .

Qi Fengxue apologized, “I’m sorry, my little sister doesn’t understand things and might say something offensive . ”

Hu Feng smiled . “It’s fine, it’s very rare to see someone so pure and without other motives in the cultivation world . ”

“Hehe, I knew that big brother was a good person . Big brother Long Chen is also a good person . If brother Long Chen comes and can’t beat these bad people, can you help him? Shouldn’t good people help good people?” asked Qi Xuan .

“Ah... well...” Hu Feng was immediately at a loss for words .

“Xuan-er, stop it . Hurry and sit . ” Qi Fengxue’s expression darkened . This place was the neutral camp, and since they were here, they couldn’t participate in the fighting between the two sides . She was regretting bringing Qi Xuan . But if she didn’t bring her sister, she would cause an even bigger fuss .

Seeing Qi Fengxue’s expression, Qi Xuan immediately began to cry . “You’re not a good person! Big brother Long Chen saved me in the Yin Yang World, but you’re not going to help the person who saved your little sister? Is the point of cultivation to just protect your own hide?”

Qi Fengxue’s expression became unnatural . Although Qi Xuan was naive, she still understood how to repay kindness . But even if Qi Fengxue understood that, what could she do? She wasn’t just one person . She represented the Heaven Reaching Ancient Castle and needed to be cautious with her actions .

“Long Chen, have you arrived yet? This time, I’ll go at it with you three hundred times!”

Suddenly, a thunderous voice rang out . A large, fat man with a fierce-looking face walked in . He had a giant butcher’s knife on his shoulder .

“The Fierce Yang Butcher, Tu Qianshang!”

A startled cry rang out . This fatty was a disciple of the Wine God Palace, Tu Qianshang .

The current Tu Qianshang had advanced to the Netherpassage realm . When he walked in, an intense alcoholic smell filled people’s noses .

The smell was burning hot . As soon as people smelled it, they coughed, feeling like they couldn’t breathe .

“Hahaha, fatty, you’ve come . Get over here . We missed you . ” Boss Bao laughed and enthusiastically called out to him . The other bosses all stood excitedly .

Seeing them, Tu Qianshang was delighted and hastily went over to give them a fierce embrace .

“Fuck, I encountered quite a few irritating pigs that tried not to let me in . I actually thought that Long Chen had already arrived,” cursed Tu Qianshang .

At this time, they saw that Tu Qianshang’s blade was covered in blood . Hearing this, they understood that those that had blocked him had probably met an untimely end .

“Greetings, senior . ” Tu Qianshang bowed to the old man .

“No need for that nonsense . We know you have some good wine . Come, come, let us taste your new wine . Your wine’s the strongest in this world . ” Boss Bao gulped down his saliva .

Tu Qianshang and the seven bosses directly began to drink . Even the old man joined in .

The smell of alcohol filled the air . After one gulp of Tu Qianshang’s wine, Boss Bao breathed fire . The air was ignited .

“Fuck, if I wasn’t familiar with you, I’d think that you were feeding us wine! This wine’s addictive!” laughed Boss Bao .

Tu Qianshang’s wine was domineering . Ever since he had helped Long Chen escape the Grand Xia and slaughtered his old enemies, undoing the knot in his heart, his Wine Dao had progressed even further .

Even the old man exclaimed that this wine was good . He even forgot about his previous displeasure with Qu Jianying .

“Tu Qianshang, why have you come here? Is the Wine God Palace planning on interfering with Long Chen’s matter?” demanded an Elder from Heavenly Fate Island

“The Wine God Palace is the Wine God Palace, while I am Tu Qianshang . I’ve come here to drink wine with Long Chen . What does the rest have to do with me or the Wine God Palace? Other than that, don’t stand so high . Count yourself lucky today that I haven’t drunk that much, or I’d have cut off your head,” said Tu Qianshang coldly before ignoring him .

Tu Qianshang’s temper was very much to the old man’s liking . His wine was even more to his appetite . After drinking a few bowls, he even forgot that this place was Heavenly Fate Island .

More and more people were arriving, but Qu Jianying was disappointed to see more and more experts of the Righteous path standing with Pill Valley . There was also a portion standing in the neutral camp . ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

“Alliance head, don’t feel bad . The waves wash away the sand, leaving behind the gold . It might be painful, but only through this can we be stronger,” comforted Li Tianxuan .

“I understand the theory, but are people truly emotionless? Seeing those people that followed me into death in battle against the Corrupt path now standing with the Corrupt path, I can’t say that my heart doesn’t hurt . ” Qu Jianying shook her head .

“As time passes, people’s hearts change . They followed you because of your charisma, because of their hot blood, but also because the Righteous path was on the verge of destruction . If they didn’t want to die, they had to fight . They didn’t fight out of some noble desire . It was their only option back then . But now they have more options . Only now can we see who truly belongs to the Righteous path,” said Li Tianxuan indifferently .

These seniors of his had been people he had once worshipped in his youth . But now, seeing the hypocrisy of the world, he didn’t feel anything .

“Di Feng has arrived!”

A flying boat shot over and a man walked off it . It was Di Long’s son, the ancient family alliance’s number one genius, Di Feng .

Following him, a large group of experts from the ancient family alliance walked off the boat as well .

These disciples were young, but they had reached the mid Life Star realm . Their auras were shockingly powerful .

Di Feng’s gaze swept through the crowd . His eyes landed on Mo Nian .

“Mo Nian, do you dare have a battle to the death with me?”

“Just you? Last time, if it weren’t for the sudden eruption in the Yin Yang World, you’d have already been killed by me . You had to lay down a trap for me in the Yin Yang World, and for you to challenge me again, I guarantee you’ve prepared another trap for me, because you simply have no confidence in beating me . The same trap used twice is meaningless,” said Mo Nian lazily .

“Hmph, isn’t that because you’re a cowardly mouse? You just keep running . In a real fight, do you think I’m afraid of you?” mocked Di Feng .

Mo Nian was about to reply when everyone felt a chill . Two graceful figures walked in .

Snow swirled around those two figures, and a biting chill struck the air . The two of them were like ice goddesses . One of them was the Ice Fairy, Ye Zhiqiu . But the one beside her was a beautiful woman looking to be in her late twenties . There was a snowflake mark on her forehead .

Upon seeing that woman, the senior generation was deeply stunned . Qu Jianying jumped up . Even the old man and the others stopped drinking, staring at her with disbelief .

“Why would she come?!”
