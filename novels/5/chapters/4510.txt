Chapter 4499 Gate to the Ninth Heaven

“Heavenly Province, you’ve gone too far!”

Outside the gates of the High Firmament Academy, Long Chen and the others wore dark expressions. At this moment, Luo Ning gritted her teeth in fury.

The Heavenly Province had sent them a gift, a giant violet crystal. Its beauty was absent, replaced by a grisly, bloodstained appearance.DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

This crystal was crafted from violet blood, a substance unique to the violet blood race, and only their essence blood could be refined into such a form.

However, it wasn’t composed of the pure essence of the violet blood; rather, it consisted of the impurities extracted from their blood. As disciples of the violet blood race advanced, they expelled these impurities, often in the form of violet powder, a substance they never bothered to collect. That meant this crystal was made of the essence blood of countless people.

Clearly, the Heavenly Province had absorbed the essence of the violet blood before refining the impurities into this crystal as a gift for Long Chen.

The crystal was over ten meters tall, representing the annihilation of an entire branch of the violet blood race and the deaths of millions of people.

This was the Heavenly Province’s declaration of war against Long Chen. Since Long Chen had killed a member of the Lifehunter race, the Lifehunter race immediately retaliated.

Long Chen’s expression was gloomy, and he clenched his fists so hard that they creaked. He had been pushed to the limit. His fury was almost out of control, but he didn’t know where the Heavenly Province’s headquarters was.

Although the Heavenly Province had come out in a loud and tyrannical fashion, they were a group of extremely mysterious and crafty people. They were the ones capable of finding others, and others wouldn’t be able to even find their shadow.

“Long Chen, don’t get angry. They’re doing this on purpose,” said Yu Qingxuan, holding Long Chen’s hand.

The other side’s goal was clear and simple—to enrage Long Chen. Next time, when he fought someone from the Heavenly Province, he would lose his mind and show openings for them to take advantage of.

Long Chen also knew this. However, he couldn’t stop himself from being enraged. Unfortunately, all this rage had nowhere to go as he had no idea where the other side was.

“Heavenly Province, I will send you to the province of death sooner or later,” blurted Long Chen after managing to suppress his anger.

The violet blood race had many branches. As long as the Luo family was fine, there was no need for Long Chen to be too anxious.

Luo Bing and Luo Ning had sensed the crystal and were sure that it wasn’t from the Luo family or the Xu family. It was some other branch.

Hence, Long Chen had Luo Bing and Luo Ning take the blood crystal. As fellow members of the violet blood race, if they could one day confirm its origins, they would be able to give them a proper farewell.

“Xia Chen, you…”

After dealing with the blood crystal, Long Chen turned to Xia Chen and was shocked to find that the latter’s aura hadn’t changed at all. He was still a Triple Supreme.

Just as Long Chen thought that the Heavenly Doyen Fruit had no effect on him, Xia Chen smiled slightly and pointed at his forehead. An immortal character seal appeared there.

Long Chen instantly understood and laughed. “You little fellow, when did you learn to be so sinister?”

Xia Chen had actually used a talisman to seal his own Doyen aura and power.

“It was my idea. Hehe, conning people to death definitely feels better than beating them openly,” laughed Guo Ran.

Guo Ran and Xia Chen were always together, cooking up new inventions and plans. Hence, when Xia Chen became a Doyen, Guo Ran was shocked as Xia Chen’s Doyen aura was absolutely terrifying. With a wave of his hand, the aura of the Heavenly Daos followed him. Furthermore, due to just becoming a Doyen, Xia Chen couldn’t fully reserve his aura.

Seeing that scene, Guo Ran immediately proposed putting a seal on Xia Chen to cover up his Doyen aura. With it, not only would Xia Chen be able to silently utilize Doyen power, but at a critical time, he could undo the seal and instantly catch his opponent off-guard. With the power of the world as his backing now, his power was unfathomable.

However, the stronger he was, the more low-key he wanted to be. After being with Guo Ran all the time, he had been led astray as well. Their principle was simple: if I can con you to death, I won’t bother fighting you openly.

As a result, Xia Chen developed a seal to completely cover up his Doyen power. Now, the only ones in the Dragonblood Legion aware that Xia Chen had become a terrifying Doyen were Long Chen and Guo Ran. If he were to fight others, he could definitely con them. Who would think that a Triple Supreme would suddenly become a terrifying Heavenly Doyen?

“That’s right. Boss, I have just refined all of the Saint-level immortal metals that you brought back. Xia Chen and I believe that we can create a Saint divine item for you. Without one, you won’t be able to use the nine forms of Split the Heavens!” said Guo Ran.

“Only now?” Long Chen was startled. Considering the time that had passed since their return from the Esoteric Spirit World, the refining process seemed rather slow.

However, thinking about it, he realized that those were Saint-level materials. With Guo Ran’s skill level, refining them was extremely difficult, so it was natural for it to be slow.

Looking at the Dragonblood warriors, Long Chen instantly noted that their armor and weapons didn’t have any of the aura of those Saint-level materials. He understood what this meant.

“Boss…” started Gu Yang and the others.

Long Chen waved his hand, interrupting them. “Since I’m the boss, what I say counts. Use all those materials to strengthen the brothers of the Dragonblood Legion. The pathway to the ninth heaven is about to open, and monsters from various worlds are appearing. The Dragonblood Legion must be ready then.”

“But boss, you…” Guo Ran was unwilling to do this. Without a suitable weapon, Long Chen would be unable to unleash his full power.

“Am I the boss, or are you the boss?” demanded Long Chen. He knew they had good intentions, but he had plenty of trump cards as well. He wasn’t worried about not having a weapon.

However, the situation was different for the Dragonblood Legion. They were still Triple Supremes and not Doyens. While facing an ordinary Doyen posed no significant threat, confronting a formidable figure like Netherdragon Tianzhao would be a different story.

If the Saint-level materials were incorporated into their equipment, their defensive and offensive prowess would rise to a new level. What made it more impactful was the fact that the Dragonblood Legion worked together. Strengthening just one or two members wouldn't make a significant difference, but if the entire legion experienced an upgrade, their collective power would become truly formidable.

Guo Ran couldn’t say anything in response. While he and Xia Chen were thrilled to have acquired those divine materials, their limited power meant a considerable amount of waste during the refining process.

Despite the inefficiencies, they pressed on to avoid falling behind. They then finished the refinement, but a new challenge emerged—if they upgraded the Dragonblood warriors’ equipment, there wouldn’t be enough material left to create a weapon for Long Chen.

That gave them a headache. After private discussions with the whole legion, they reached a consensus to discreetly forge a weapon specifically for Long Chen.

However, before they could even start studying how to make such a weapon, Yue Zifeng spoke up in opposition, saying that if they dared to do such a thing, their boss would definitely be unhappy with them. As a result, Guo Ran tested the waters, only to end up exactly as Yue Zifeng had predicted.

In the end, Guo Ran gathered the weapons and armor of the Dragonblood warriors to upgrade them. He had personally made them, so upgrading them wasn’t anything difficult for him.

By incorporating Saint-level materials into their equipment, even if it didn’t elevate them to the status of true Saint items, they would emanate a hint of a Saint item’s aura. Within the realm of Eternal divine items, they would definitely stand as the strongest existences.

Days later, the world started shaking. A formidable aura permeated the nine heavens and ten lands. Divine light beamed from various world gates, converging to rupture the sky and unveil an enormous gate.

“The gate to the ninth heaven has finally opened!”

Within the academy, the sweeping elder paused and looked into the distance. His turbid eyes gradually grew clear, and his eyes seemed to see through that gate.

“What shall come will come.”
