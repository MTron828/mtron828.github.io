Chapter 1618 Han Feifei

Translator: BornToBe

“AH!”

That man let out a miserable cry, causing everyone to jump. That whip had clearly been aimed at the woman. Why would that man suddenly act as the hero saving the beauty?

Even if he wanted to be a hero saving a beauty, he wouldn’t use his own face to receive it. However, when people saw that his throat was caught in someone else’s hand, they couldn’t help letting out startled cries.

A cloaked man was holding him like he was a chicken. The former had used the latter’s face to receive that whip. Even the whipper was startled. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

Naturally this cloaked person was Long Chen. He coldly said, “Is it fun playing such a joke? Now you’ve experienced how it feels, so tell me, is it fun?”

“Who... who are you?!” demanded that man.

Previously, it had been this man who had smiled wickedly and pushed that woman forward just as the palanquin was approaching. That woman hadn’t been expecting such a thing, and so she had been pushed out.

Long Chan had seen it clearly. As a man, he wasn’t opposed to pulling pranks. Who didn’t have a bit of a petty side?

However, a man had to take responsibility for his actions. Seeing this man push that woman to be beaten while acting like he hadn’t done anything had sparked Long Chen’s anger, so he had helped that man play the hero saving the beauty.

“Who I am isn’t important. What’s important is that as a man who stands while he pees, you have to bear the responsibility for your actions. If you harm someone, you have to help them bear the consequences. I knew you didn’t have that courage, so I just helped you out. There’s no need to thank me.” Long Chen slowly released the man and patted him on the shoulder.

When Long Chen said this, everyone immediately understood what had happened. They all glowered at the man, especially the women. If it weren’t for the palanquin being present, they might have already charged forward and beaten him to death.

“Just wait!” The man cried out some vicious words before covering his face and leaving.

The woman who had almost been harmed thanked Long Chen, but Long Chen merely smiled and shook his head.

“You like meddling in other people’s affairs? Scram!”

The expert with the whip was embarrassed at having his attack so easily blocked. Seeing the woman, who had been his original target, thank Long Chen, he was enraged and attacked Long Chen, eliciting startled cries.

Long Chen caught his whip. His hand moved so fast that others couldn’t even see it. The expert tried to pull back his whip, and the whip’s runes lit up. It was a powerful Ancestral item. However, no matter what he did, the whip was like a little snake caught in Long Chen’s grasp. He couldn’t pull it out.

“You should bless your luck. If the weather wasn’t good today, you’d be a corpse. Scram!”

Long Chen shook his hand ever so slightly. That expert coughed up blood, while every inch of his whip exploded, its fragments scattering through the air.

“Bastard, you-!”

Pow!

The expert’s furious roar was cut off when Long Chen slapped him across the face. His head caved in, and he flew into the distance.

Long Chen’s gaze was cold. Originally, his mood was good as he had come to see Chu Yao. His mood was as sunny as the weather. Being in a crowd of so many people made him recall many things of a more mediocre time.

However, there just had to be a fool who came to provoke him, ruining his good mood. If the weather wasn’t good, or if his mood wasn’t good, he’d have long since killed that idiot with the wave of a hand.

Long Chen’s actions startled everyone, and they backed up even further, looking at him in shock. Someone actually dared to attack Han Feifei’s people? Just how tough was his backing?

“What is going on?” A female voice came from within the palanquin. It sounded like its owner had just woken up.

“Reporting to the young lady, someone is blocking the path and causing trouble!” reported one of the experts.

“Then hurry up and kill them. I want to see brother Di Xin already,” said the woman.

“Yes.” The experts immediately surrounded Long Chen. “Brat, although you have some skill, you shouldn’t have become enemies with my Han family. To be enemies with the Han family is to be enemies with the Southern Xuan Region’s ancient family alliance. Before, you didn’t know the young lady’s status. But now that you do, it’s too late. I’ll give you to the count of three. Kill yourself. Doing so has two benefits: you’ll get to keep your corpse intact, and you won’t bring disaster to your family.”

“Hahahahaha...”

Long Chen couldn’t help but laugh. Even in all his time dominating the Eastern Xuan Region, he had never encountered someone so wildly arrogant, arrogant to the point that it was laughable.

“It seems you don’t know how to appreciate kindness. Fine, you can die then,” said one of the experts furiously. All of them raised their weapons at Long Chen.

“Wait a sec.” Long Chen waved his hand.

“Are you regretting it now? It’s too late!”

“I’ve never done anything I’ve regretted, so there’s no need for you to worry about that. I was just saying to wait because I want to ask if we can switch locations. Killing you here wouldn’t be too good,” said Long Chen.

After all, this was right beneath the Skywood Divine Palace, Chu Yao’s sect. Killing people here wasn’t good. However, his killing intent had already been provoked. He definitely wouldn’t be merciful once he attacked.

The crowd was shocked. Just who was this cloaked man? Did he not know who Han Feifei was? He actually dared to go against her!

Just as everyone was shocked, within the main palace of the Skywood Divine Palace, four women were drinking tea and looking at the scene on the wall.

The four of them were Meng Qi, Chu Yao, Tang Wan-er, as well as a beautiful woman looking to be in her late twenties. Her hair was tied up in a high bun, and her bearing was natural and graceful. She was the Skywood Divine Palace’s master.

For Chu Yao, she had sacrificed her youthful appearance. However, Chu Yao had then brought back the divine life elixir from the Spirit World which had restored her beauty. Furthermore, she looked to be even younger and more beautiful. When the four of them were together, it looked as if they were sisters. If it wasn’t for the difference in their cultivation bases, it would have been impossible to realize the truth.

They had been chatting here the entire day. The palace master was extremely experienced, and she would discuss the Dao with them every day, benefiting the three of them greatly. They were gaining new insights and benefits with each passing day.

However, the three of them had recently been growing anxious because Long Chen hadn’t come even after all this time. When they had seen him appear, Tang Wan-er had immediately leaped up. But after a moment of excitement, she gnashed her teeth. “That scoundrel, who knows where he went all this time? He must be punished! Don’t open a back door for him this time. Let him take the test with everyone else and fight for his own spot.”

“That’s no good. Long Chen isn’t very good at minding his own business. If things get troublesome, it’ll be hard to fix them,” said Chu Yao with a laugh.

“Isn’t this the Skywood Divine Palace? Would he dare to cause trouble here?” demanded Tang Wan-er. This was Chu Yao’s home. Long Chen definitely wouldn’t dare to cause trouble here.

“I wasn’t talking about that. You know how outstanding Long Chen is... There are so many women here, aren’t you worried...” Chu Yao winked at Tang Wan-er profoundly.

“He wouldn’t dare!”

Tang Wan-er immediately raged, but her confidence flagged.

“In this world where experts were revered, a person like Long Chen has a fatal attraction for women. Furthermore, he also has that wild and fearless aspect to him. Long Chen is dangerous, and some women are very attracted to that. You want to toss him into a crowd of women? Isn’t that like tossing honey into an ant’s nest?” laughed Chu Yao.

“I refuse to believe he’s so amazing!” quibbled Tang Wan-er. However, she had no choice but to admit that Chu Yao was right.

“Then Meng Qi, don’t you think he should be punished? He ignored us for such a long time!” Tang Wan-er turned to Meng Qi for help.

Meng Qi shook her head helplessly. She patted Tang Wan-er on the head. “You really are like a child. If Long Chen didn’t get the message, that means he’s very busy. If he received it and didn’t come, it means he had something even more important to do. There’s nothing to punish him over.”

“Big sister, why do you always speak up for Long Chen? If you act like that, he’ll become completely unbridled. There’ll be no way to keep him in check!” said Tang Wan-er.

Meng Qi was always gentle and kind, as well as good at understanding others. Oftentimes, when it came to Long Chen, she would do whatever he said.

“Are you treating him like a child?” laughed Meng Qi. “Alright, if you want, he can muddle his way in with the crowd. Actually, if you look at him, he’s reserved himself quite a bit. He’s quite low-key in the crowd. Look at these geniuses puffing out their chests trying to impress others. Long Chen’s intentionally trying not to draw attention. Hehe, it’s you, Wan-er, who’s trying to cause trouble for him.”

“Sister, you’re laughing at me!” cried Tang Wan-er.

“Oh? Palace master, quick. Someone has to stop Long Chen. he’s going to start killing!” Meng Qi suddenly let out a startled cry.

...

“Hmph, there’s no need to go through so much trouble. You can die right here!”

Those experts sneered at Long Chen’s expression, and their auras began to rise.

Long Chen shook his head. Some people were in such a rush to reincarnate. If he didn’t help them out, he’d feel bad for their energetic attitudes.

“Stop!”

Just as Long Chen was about to send these people to their deaths, a cold cry rang out. A figure appeared in the air.
