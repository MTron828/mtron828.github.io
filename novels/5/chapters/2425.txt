Chapter 2415 Do You Dare to Fight Me

Translator: BornToBe

The sea of karmic hell flames seemed to have been provoked by Hong Yaoyang. They crashed against the Nethergod palace.

“Long Chen, you despicable fellow, if you have the guts, come out and fight!” roared Hong Yaoyang, clenching his teeth furiously. He knew he had been conned by Long Chen.

The karmic hell flames were flames beyond his power as a god. Anything within the cycle of reincarnation could be incinerated by the karmic flames.

In his fury, he had attacked Long Chen. Originally, he had locked Long Chen down with his divine power and had been confident that his blow would kill him. However, he hadn’t expected Long Chen to easily escape his lock by being sucked into the Demon Moon Furnace.

As a result, he had planted the seed of karma between himself and the karmic hell flames when his attack struck them. Now, he would have to reap the consequences.

The karmic hell flames currently viewed Long Chen and Hong Yaoyang as mortal enemies. With Long Chen hiding inside the Demon Moon Furnace, the karmic hell flames couldn’t reach him. He didn’t even need to defend against them.

Seeing the karmic hell flames attacking Hong Yaoyang, Long Chen laughed, “Hong Yaoyang, you weak coward, if you have the guts, come out and fight! If you don’t come, I’m your granddaddy!”

“You…!” Hong Yaoyang was so infuriated that his hair was standing on end. Seeing Long Chen hiding within the Demon Moon Furnace with the karmic hell flames powerless to touch him, Hong Yaoyang was completely enraged. He didn’t dare to charge into the sea of karmic hell flames.

If he attacked the karmic hell flames again, that would plant more karma between them. If it was just this amount of karmic hell flames, then that wasn’t too worrisome. However, with too much karma, all of Purgatory’s karmic hell flames would come out, and he would be doomed.

“Long Chen, do you think a turtle shell will protect you? Idiot, the karmic hell flames can only be unleashed for a limited amount of time. After four hours, they will be summoned back by the laws of Purgatory. Then I’ll make you regret coming to this world!” declared Hong Yaoyang.

“Four hours. Did you hear that? Mo Nian, you have four hours,” transmitted Long Chen.

“Alright, I’ll do my best to be quick,” replied Mo Nian.

Mo Nian had also run into trouble on his side. The sword’s power was so great that it was taking a great deal of effort for the Five Element Sun Hunting Bow to absorb it. He needed to suppress it as his bow absorbed it.

His original plan was for the Five Element Sun Hunting Bow to absorb the sword’s power while he absorbed Hong Yaoyang’s mortal husk’s inheritance. But now he could only go one at a time.

Just from that reply, Long Chen knew that Mo Nian was having trouble. He needed to think of a way to stall.

“Hey, that little brat called Hong Yaoyang, do you have no ability at all? Get over here and fight. My blade has long since grown thirsty for your blood,” called out Long Chen arrogantly.

Hong Yaoyang sneered, “You want to provoke me into attacking the karmic hell flames again? How childish. When the karmic hell flames retreat, we’ll see if you can still be so arrogant.”

Hong Yaoyang refused to fall for it. If he attacked the karmic hell flames, he would draw more karma over. Their power would also increase.

“At the time I started being arrogant, you were still in diapers,” sneered Long Chen. But as soon as he said this, he felt like he had gone a bit too far. That was a god of this world, an existence that had been living for who knew how many millennia.

“Hahaha, a little-”

Just as Hong Yaoyang laughed derisively, Long Chen came shooting out of the karmic hell flames, slapping him in the face.

Hong Yaoyang hadn’t had any defenses against Long Chen, someone he viewed as an ant. As a result, Long Chen’s slap landed solidly on his face. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

Moreover, Long Chen’s hand was enveloped by the karmic hell flames, setting Hong Yaoyang’s face on fire.

Hong Yaoyang roared and punched Long Chen. Even before the punch arrived, Long Chen felt like his body would crumble from the pressure.

Long Chen vanished, reappearing within the Demon Moon Furnace. This was a trick he had drilled in advance with Ling-er.

With his mind connected to the Demon Moon Furnace, he was able to instantly enter the Demon Moon Furnace when it pulled on him.

Such a thing wouldn’t work on the Martial Heaven Continent. But here in the Netherworld, he was just a Yuan Spirit and not restricted in that way. Even a god’s lock was escapable using this method.

Long Chen’s vanished, resulting in Hong Yaoyang’s furious punch tearing through the karmic hell flames.

Seeing the devastation resulting from this one punch, Long Chen smacked his lips. “Damn, if that hit, not even a hundred lives would be enough.”

Fortunately, they had been fast enough to get away. But Ling-er was afraid. “Big brother Long Chen, don’t play around anymore. If I was the slightest bit slower just now, you would have died.”

“It’s fine. Having fun is stimulating,” laughed Long Chen.

“Big brother Long Chen… do you really have such faith in me?” asked Ling-er.

“Of course. You’re my partner. I’ve entrusted my life to you when refining pills, so I can do it now as well,” replied Long Chen as he looked through the karmic hell flames at the furious Hong Yaoyang.

“Big brother Long Chen…” Ling-er’s voice shuddered. She had never had anyone that had any faith in her. Every one of her masters had simply used her to their own advantage. She was always viewed as a tool.

Even if she was something so important that others would view her as important as their own life, she was just something to benefit others.

She had never tasted what trust was. But working with Long Chen, she felt his absolute trust in her. That made her feel a gratitude that she had never felt before.

Hong Yaoyang’s expression changed. This punch of his was even stronger than his previous attack. The karmic hell flames were enraged.

“You bastard!” Hong Yaoyang roared furiously. He hastily formed hand seals and then slammed his hands on the palace. He needed to raise the palace’s defenses if he wanted it to survive.

A wave of fire came crashing out of the flames as his hands slammed on the palace. Hong Yaoyang ignored it, allowing it to sweep over him.

Just at that moment, a hand reached out from within the flames and struck him in the face.

“You shameless brat, do you dare to fight?”

Hong Yaoyang had never expected Long Chen to dare to attack again. As a result, another handprint appeared on the other side of his face.

Hong Yaoyang was enraged. His hand reached out like a bolt of lightning to grab Long Chen.

The clothes on Long Chen’s shoulder were torn off, and several bloody holes appeared there. His blood gushed out. Hong Yaoyang had reacted so quickly that Long Chen hadn’t had time to retreat.

“Fuck off. You even dare to scratch me?”

Long Chen twisted back, following the flow of the karmic hell flames to fall back. He said goodbye by landing a foot on Hong Yaoyang’s nose.

Hong Yaoyang felt a sour feeling on his nose, and tears streamed out.

Although he was a god, in order to avoid karma, he had not summoned his strongest defenses. His more powerful defenses would cause a backlash to the karmic hell flames, which would increase the karma.

As a result, by taking advantage of this, Long Chen managed to slap him twice and stamp his nose. Hong Yaoyang went crazy.

“DIE!”

In his rage, Hong Yaoyang didn’t care about any consequences. A sword suddenly appeared in his hand. The entire Netherworld shuddered when that sword appeared.

BOOM!

Sword Qi cut the sea of karmic hell flames in two. This sword was capable of destroying an entire world.

However, Hong Yaoyang was still one step too slow. As soon as Long Chen’s foot had landed, he returned to the Demon Moon Furnace without waiting for Hong Yaoyang’s reaction.

Long Chen reacted even faster than Hong Yaoyang because he knew that in terms of speed, he couldn’t compare to the god of this world.

“Big brother Long Chen, please stop playing around. It’s too frightening!” exclaimed Ling-er. If Long Chen had been the slightest bit slower, he would no longer exist in this world.

“Hehe, okay, I’ll stop playing. That was enough.” Long Chen smiled.

Karmic hell flames came gushing over, enveloping the sky. The flames were coming from every direction to attack the palace.

“Long Chen, you bastard, you won’t have a good death!”

Hong Yaoyang let out a bestial roar. He had been conned by Long Chen once more. This attack of his had fully provoked the karmic hell flames. The defenses outside of the palace had been incinerated, and the flames were now attacking the palace itself.

“Hey, how can you curse people like that? It’s classless.” This time, Long Chen stayed right next to the Demon Moon Furnace, simply looking at Hong Yaoyang in a carefree manner.

“Just wait!” Hong Yaoyang roared and ignored Long Chen. He sat on top of the palace, an image of a throne appearing behind him. He was finally activating the power of the Nethergod’s throne. If he didn’t, the palace would be incinerated.

Divine light filled the palace, creating a barrier that blocked the karmic hell flames. However, he had barely stabilized the situation when his expression completely changed. He once more looked at Long Chen, his eyes full of killing intent.

“You bastards, you’re stealing my mortal husk.”
