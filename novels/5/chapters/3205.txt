Chapter 3194 Black Sword

“This is… the Four Peak selection?”

An institute head cried out in shock. Those sharp swords contained all the essences and attributes of the ten thousand Daos within heaven and earth. This should be the final segment of the heavenly tribulation.

However, why was it different from other people’s tribulations? Other people had their Heavenly Dao runes hidden in the void. But here, the Heavenly Dao runes were hidden within sharp swords.

Every sword contained destructive power. Even the institute heads felt fear toward them.

“Qin Feng, focus!” shouted Long Chen. This was the final moment. Qin Feng had to endure.

“Boss, I can hold on…”

Qin Feng’s vision was starting to blur. It felt like an endless hell was closing in on him. This pressure almost made his will collapse.

As for Long Chen’s voice, it seemed to be like a whisper of the wind in Qin Feng’s ears. His body shuddered as he concentrated his final bit of power on staying conscious.

The millions of lightning dragons gathered, condensing into one giant dragon that wrapped around Long Chen and Qin Feng.

However, even its combined body seemed weak in front of those sharp swords. They easily pierced into its body, leaving giant holes.

Fortunately, it wrapped itself around them in multiple layers, and some of those lightning swords exploded within its body.

Long Chen eyed those swords. He then suddenly made his move.

His hand reached out four times. Four of those swords were caught by Long Chen and stabbed into Qin Feng’s body. As a result, his body became covered in cracks and almost shattered.

Just like that, Long Chen grabbed Qin Feng and sent him flying out like a cannonball.

That direction was where Bai Xiaole’s mother and the others were. Bai Xiaole’s mother hastily formed hand seals. When Qin Feng reached the edge of the heavenly tribulation, space twisted and he was transported right in front of them.

“The heavenly tribulation is chasing!” DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

The institute heads cried out. The tribulation clouds in the sky were rumbling, preparing to spread toward them.

BOOM!

Just at this moment, Long Chen charged into the heavens with lightning raging on top of his black saber. A giant saber-image tore through the tribulation clouds.

Seemingly enraged by Long Chen, they ignored Qin Feng. As the range of the tribulation shrank, the power of the lightning swords raining down on Long Chen instantly increased.

However, the others had no time to look at Long Chen. They had to heal Qin Feng, who was on the verge of death. The current him only had half a breath of life more than a dead person.

“Blood, flesh, tendon, bone, and all of them were rank seven runes. Did Long Chen want him to die?!” Bai Zhantang examined the four bloody holes in Qin Feng’s body. There were four different violet runes sealed inside them.

He had actually given Qin Feng four rank seven runes at once with similar properties. This was no different than murder, no?

“Stop wasting words and heal him. He really will die like that!” urged Bai Shishi’s mother.

Bai Zhantang hastily got to work. Thanks to everyone’s combined efforts, they managed to protect Qin Feng’s life.

However, when it came to those four Heavenly Dao runes in his body, there was nothing that they could do. They could only let him slowly absorb them. During this time, Qin Feng would probably have to suffer quite a bit of pain. But it was all worth it.

Only once Qin Feng was saved did they turn back to Long Chen. A dragon mark had appeared on Long Chen’s black saber, and it was covered in wild lightning. Those lightning swords were being hacked apart.

Lei Long had merged its power into the black saber, aiding Long Chen against the heavenly tribulation. Even so, countless lightning swords continued to strike Long Chen’s body.

Those swords stabbed into his body and exploded. Their power was easily enough to kill a Divine Lord as every sword contained destructive will. It was not like other people’s heavenly tribulations where the Heavenly Dao runes were the reward for passing the tribulation.

There was no such choice for Long Chen to make. All the Heavenly Dao runes were simply trying to kill him.

Because of them, Long Chen was quickly covered in blood. Some of those runes flickered with a seven-colored coldness that directly pierced straight through his body.

“Peak rank Heavenly Dao runes!”

When they saw the seven-colored light, they knew that it was the manifestation of a peak rank Heavenly Dao rune.

However, those lightning swords looked the same as the others. It was only when they pierced through Long Chen’s body or struck his saber that they would reveal their light. It was as if they were hiding themselves.

Suddenly, Long Chen roared and raised his saber. With nothing blocking their way, those swords pierced into his body. After that, a giant saber-image tore into the heavens.

“Split the Heavens!”

Long Chen’s saber fell. Suddenly, amongst those countless swords appeared a black lightning sword.

“What is that?”

“Why is it black?”

“There’s no record of such a thing!”

The institute heads exclaimed in shock. They had never seen or heard of such a thing.

BOOM!

The black saber collided with the black sword. When the black ripples spread from the point of collision, the other lightning swords were blasted apart.

The power of that black sword was truly terrifying. The collision shook Long Chen’s insides and turned his arms numb.

“Lei Long, hurry. My survival depends on you,” transmitted Long Chen. At the same time, the primal chaos space’s life energy poured into his body.

Lei Long crazily absorbed the lightning runes in the air. Only when it was strong enough could Long Chen resist the power of that black lightning. Otherwise, he would be killed by this tribulation.

He had just knocked away the first black sword when another black sword appeared behind him. Not giving him any time to dodge, it pierced through his back and out his chest, leaving a bowl-sized bloody hole.

“What is this?!” Bai Shishi started to panic. Those black swords contained destructive power, and it was impossible to tell what kind of rune they contained. There was some terrifying, sinister aura on top of them. It wasn’t something that should appear within a heavenly tribulation.

No one answered her because no one knew what those black swords represented. The sinister aura gave them chills. Only the dean was lost in thought as he looked at the black swords. No one knew what he was thinking.
