Chapter 2556 Help You Out

The blinding light was the result of multicolored runes exploding. They emitted a blinding light like the sun.

When the light slowly faded, it was possible to see three vague figures within. From their general outlines, it was possible to tell who they were.

Jiang Wuchen’s giant body made him very easy to recognize, but Ye Liangchen and Long Chen’s figures weren’t so easy to tell apart. However, since two of them were attacking one person, the person at the center had to be Long Chen.

“What happened with Long Chen? How can he block the attacks of two Sovereign sprouts by himself?” Everyone was startled to see this. It seemed that Long Chen had undergone a heaven-toppling transformation in the Star Field Divine World.

Three people were clashing against each other, and berserk energy was constantly exploding from their palms, bursting out like sharp blades, shredding the void around them.

“Break!”

Long Chen suddenly roared. At this moment, his six-color divine ring rapidly spun, and power exploded out of his palms like a volcano. With a final explosion, Jiang Wuchen and Ye Liangchen were knocked back.

Jiang Wuchen retreated four steps, each step causing the void to shatter like ice. Meanwhile, the ground beneath him exploded, unable to bear that power.

As for Ye Liangchen, he was directly sent flying. His manifestation shuddered, attempting to stabilize him but failing.

Even one against two, Long Chen could force back his opponents. He actually had the advantage against two Sovereign sprouts.

Long Aotian was startled, not having expected Long Chen to be so powerful.

However, now that things had reached this point, there was no way this battle would end any time soon. After all, Long Chen had just slapped the faces of two Sovereign sprouts. There was no way they would take that lying down.

Even an ordinary person wouldn’t be able to accept such humiliation, let alone prideful Sovereign sprouts like Ye Liangchen and Jiang Wuchen.

At this moment, Ye Liangchen and Jiang Wuchen were ashen, killing intent exploding out of them. Ye Liangchen shouted, “Get out of the way. I’ll kill him!”

“He’s mine. You scram.” Jiang Wuchen reached out and grabbed the giant hatchet behind him. Despite the hatchet not attacking yet, its sharp aura had sliced through the void.

Jiang Wuchen was fully enraged now. Long Chen’s slap was extremely humiliating, making him feel like he was going insane.

BOOM!

Jiang Wuchen was like a wild Magical Beast charging toward Long Chen. He was wielding his hatchet, which was a divine item with an exceedingly ancient history. Its fierce aura caused a rumbling that made people feel like their souls would flee.

“You scram! His life belongs to me!” Ye Liangchen also attacked and a sword appeared in his hand.

His sword had countless star patterns along it, as if millions of stars had been condensed inside of it.

“You want to kill me? Just the two of you?” Long Chen snorted and Evilmoon appeared in his hand. With a single step, he appeared in front of the charging Ye Liangchen and unleashed a slash.

“What?!”

Long Chen’s attack was identical to Ye Liangchen’s. His saber was slashing at his opponent’s head just like Ye Liangchen’s sword.

There was no feint or trick. Long Chen was truly undergoing a suicidal exchange with Ye Liangchen. Was Long Chen trying to force him to change moves midway?

Ye Liangchen twitched. This was clearly an attempt at forcing him to concede and retreat, which would allow Long Chen to grasp the initiative.

As a result, Ye Liangchen turned his sword. He had no choice but to switch to defense because he had no confidence in blocking Long Chen’s attack with something else.

Evilmoon then slashed heavily into Ye Liangchen’s sword, sending him back several steps.

One unleashed a full-strength attack, while the other was forced to switch techniques midway. Ye Liangchen was naturally at a disadvantage. Most shocking of all, he realized that a portion of his power was sucked away by Long Chen.

“How is that possible?” Ye Liangchen found this difficult to believe, as his astral energy came from his manifestation. Only he was able to control this power. If anyone else tried to absorb it, the curse of the stars would kill them.

“Die!”

Just at that moment, Jiang Wuchen’s hatchet fell. This attack had been accumulating power this entire time, so it possessed the power to topple mountains and invert the seas.

“Go fuck yourself.” Long Chen swept his saber out, not forgetting to add a few words. A sinister aura exploded out of Evilmoon.

At this moment, two divine items crashed together with shooting stars, and a huge explosion boomed.

Intense sound waves spread through the air. As a result, some disciples with weaker cultivation bases held their ears as blood flowed out of them. The only sound they could hear was that booming sound, and they couldn’t even hear their own screams.

Some disciples even directly fainted. The sound waves possessed a strange law to them, so even though they were at a great distance and at the end of the sound wave, they were still affected. If they were closer, perhaps their souls would directly shatter.

In front of countless shocked gazes, Jiang Wuchen tumbled back. This giant seemed powerful, but he seemed inferior to Ye Liangchen.

Right now, Jiang Wuchen was shocked and infuriated. He almost spat out blood, but even as it rose into his throat, he forcibly swallowed it back down.

Jiang Wuchen clearly sensed that Long Chen’s attack just now contained Ye Liangchen’s power as well. Did he actually borrow Ye Liangchen’s astral energy?

“Ye Liangchen, what are you doing? Are you lending him your power?!” Jiang Wuchen roared furiously, blaming Ye Liangchen. Perhaps that way, he could win back some face.

Using this method, he was telling anyone that he hadn’t lost to Long Chen. It was Ye Liangchen who had loaned Long Chen power. Just now, it had been the two of them together to force him back.

Ye Liangchen was still shocked, pondering about how Long Chen had taken his astral energy when he heard Jiang Wuchen’s cursing. As a result, his fury soared, but he had no way to explain it. Long Chen truly had borrowed a portion of his power, and Jiang Wuchen’s announcement had told everyone that he was the loser in the previous exchange.

“I told you not to interfere. I’m going to use my full power now, so don’t get hurt accidentally.” Ye Liangchen snorted, and the river of stars behind him suddenly charged out of his manifestation, transforming into sharp swords.

“He’s a sword cultivator!” exclaimed Yue Zifeng.

“A sword cultivator? Aren’t sword cultivators only capable of using sword arts?” asked Guo Ran and the others.

A sword cultivator could only use the sword, so using other magical arts was a blasphemy to the sword. But Ye Liangchen had previously used his fists and only taken out his sword once he had been slapped by Long Chen.

Summoning a river of stars to fight was also not the method of a sword cultivator. If it wasn’t Yue Zifeng personally making this statement, no one would believe that Ye Liangchen was a sword cultivator.

“I don’t understand either, but his stars contain the will of the Sword Dao. These attacks are the result of triggering that will. Look carefully at his sword,” said Yue Zifeng.

When they focused on Ye Liangchen’s sword, they suddenly noticed that the stars within were mimicking the swords being unleashed by his manifestation.

“Is his sword linked to his manifestation? Hence, he can only unleash his greatest power when his manifestation is fully activated, right?” asked Meng Qi.

“That is most likely the case,” said Yue Zifeng.

Everyone sucked in a cold gasp of air. If that was true, then Ye Liangchen’s strongest state was when those millions of stars were fully activated.

Even in his current state, none of them could match him. If he activated all those stars in his manifestation, who could fight him?

At this time, star swords streaked toward Long Chen, and he repeatedly swung Evilmoon, blasting them apart.

Swords rained down around him, leaving glossy holes in the ground and enveloping him. On the other hand, Jiang Wuchen stood still and watched. After a moment of hesitation, he coldly said, “You still have half an incense stick’s worth of time.”

Although Jiang Wuchen was also angry, attacking Long Chen now would end up with him clashing with Ye Liangchen. So he chose to endure briefly.

“Long Chen, you had better endure this. You can’t die to his hands, or… I, Jiang Wuchen, will kill everyone connected to you,” shouted Jiang Wuchen.

Suddenly, lightning exploded out of Long Chen. At some point, the void had been filled with lightning runes. They had been hidden before, but now they appeared, transforming the battlefield into a sea of lightning.

“So that’s what was going on!” When the sea of lightning appeared, the question that everyone had been pondering was answered. This was how Long Chen was teleporting. He had a lightning domain present that none of them had noticed before. His control over this lightning had reached a practically perfect level to be able to hide it from everyone.

The spatial pressure of the battle had increased with the intensity of the fighting, affecting these runes. Hence, he had to increase their power if he wanted to continue teleporting, but this decision would expose them.

When those lightning runes appeared, Long Chen’s body vanished and he escaped Ye Liangchen’s lock, essentially exposing his teleportation secret.

However, just as he vanished, Jiang Wuchen’s heart turned cold. His hair suddenly stood on end as a sensation of death filled him. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

After that, he instinctively shot forward and raised his hatchet behind him as a shield.

BOOM!

Evilmoon then slammed into the hatchet, exploding with power. Being unable to block the intensity of the clash, Jiang Wuchen coughed up a mouthful of blood and slammed into the ground, raising a giant wave of earth.

“Since you want to die so badly, I’ll help you out.” Killing intent blazed within Long Chen’s eyes. His divine ring suddenly changed. Now, three of the colors were spinning clockwise, while the other three spun counterclockwise.

Six stars lit up within his divine ring. Light shot out of the FengFu Star to the Alioth, Life Fate, Enlightenment Palace, Divine Gate, and Nethergate Stars, before finally returning to the FengFu Star, creating a six-point star.

When that six-point star appeared, Long Chen’s Blood Qi was fully activated, and a berserk power caused the world to shudder. A domineering will filled the air.

“Boss is finally unleashing his full power!” exclaimed Guo Ran. Long Chen had been fully enraged by Jiang Wuchen.

Suddenly, Long Chen swung Evilmoon at the earth, striking Jiang Wuchen who was just climbing out of the ground.
