Chapter 2529 Play Stupid Games, Win Stupid Prizes

BOOM!

Long Chen’s fist violently smashed into the Sea God Trident, shattering this inherited divine item of the sea demon race into tiny golden fragments.

Long Chen’s fist then continued onward to strike the Six Horn Sea Serpent’s head, and it exploded along with his body.

“What?!”

Everyone was stunned and appalled. What kind of power was this? With his bare hands, Long Chen had shattered a divine item and killed the king of the Six Horn Sea Serpent race even when the latter had destroyed his own manifestation for unprecedented power.

“This power… it comes from…” Evilmoon was also startled. Long Chen shouldn’t be this powerful barehanded. “Not good!”

Just at this moment, Long Chen was already charging over to Dongfang Yuyang. Due to the backlash of the last attack, half his body was nothing more than bones.

However, it seemed that he didn’t feel any pain. The rage and killing intent inside of him didn’t diminish at all after killing the Six Horn Sea Serpent. It only grew.

It was like killing him had unlocked the most primitive desire to kill within Long Chen. The darkness within his eyes slowly began to resurface.

Just as Long Chen was about to strike Dongfang Yuyang with his fist, Evilmoon forced itself to appear in Long Chen’s hand. Long Chen conveniently swung it at Dongfang Yuyang.

The instant that Long Chen’s attention had turned to him, Dongfang Yuyang felt like he had been locked onto by a primordial beast. The surrounding space pressed down on him from all directions.

However, the thing that terrified him the most was that his two arms had yet to regrow. His Heavenly Dao energy was unable to help them recover.

In that instant, it was as if the only things left in this world were him and Long Chen. No one else could help him.

A pair of wings appeared on Dongfang Yuyang’s back. Those were Kunpeng wings that then folded in front of him.

Next, a pair of stone arms grew out of his shoulders. They quickly formed hand seals, and a giant stone shield rose out of the ground, one after another for a total of eighteen.

At the same time, Dongfang Yuyang’s body began to dissipate. In one go, Dongfang Yuyang had used the power of the Peng Emperor, the Stone Emperor, and the Blood Emperor.

BOOM!

Long Chen’s saber slashed down. The two heaven-shrouding wings were the first to explode. Then the eighteen stone shields shattered like walls of flour.

When the final shield exploded, the black saber-image landed on the illusory Dongfang Yuyang. As a result, Dongfang Yuyang let out a shriek as he was cut in two.

Even then, Dongfang Yuyang didn’t die. Blood mist tried to connect his two halves as he fled.

“Split the Heavens 8!”

Long Chen swung Evilmoon vertically, unleashing a black crescent moon at Dongfang Yuyang.

“No!!!” Dongfang Yuyang let out a mournful and unwilling cry.

The black crescent moon caught up to Dongfang Yuyang and blasted him to pieces. Even his Yuan Spirit was turned to dust.

The manifestation of the three Emperors slowly dissipated, merging back into the void.

“Get down!” Yue Zifeng suddenly shouted. Everyone was horrified to find that Long Chen’s attack hadn’t faded after killing Dongfang Yuyang, and it was now rushing toward them.

The Dragonblood warriors hastily ducked. The chilling Saber Qi flew past their heads.

The sharp winds cut their cheeks. As for the Martial Heaven Alliance’s disciples, countless bloody wounds appeared on their bodies, shocking them.

That saber wind had clearly passed hundreds of meters above them, but it still possessed such terrifying power. It struck, all of them would have been turned to dust.

Countless giant branches were blown apart as the attack struck the crown of the Life Spirit God. Almost half of it was lost, stunning everyone.

“Just what level of power is this?” Even the prophet of the Luo Spirit race turned pale. That attack had just happened to go right past him.

“Long Chen, you have to control yourself!” roared Evilmoon. Long Chen was being far too wasteful like this.

It was unknown if he was startled out of his state by Evilmoon’s roar or if he was stunned by his own power, but the darkness within Long Chen’s eyes faded once more.

“The main thing is that I can’t control this power… pfft!” Long Chen coughed up a mouthful of blood. Countless wounds appeared all over his body.

Long Chen was badly startled and extracted the energy of the Heavenly Qilin Demon Trees again to recover. Without them, he would be in no state to keep fighting.

“The Nine Star Hegemon Body Art is so strange. When the black qi fades, Long Chen’s body can’t hold on…” Evilmoon was shocked inside.

Long Chen then turned his attention to Ye Ming. With a deep breath, Long Chen stepped toward him, raising Evilmoon with a beast-like roar.

Ye Ming was the main culprit. Just now, Long Chen hadn’t known what was going on with himself. His head was muddled, and even his memories of killing the Six Horn Sea Serpent and Dongfang Yuyang were vague.

He assumed that this was the result of the Six Star Battle Armor, which caused him to be unwell. He was unaware that another kind of power was encroaching upon him.

“Long Chen, I admit that you’re very powerful. But you should have reached your limit. We can settle things now.” Ye Ming didn’t feel much fear even in front of the unprecedentedly powerful Long Chen.

“Even if I have reached my limit, I have more than enough to kill you!” roared Long Chen, slashing Evilmoon down.

Long Chen felt like there was a volcano within his body. Currently, that volcano had yet to erupt, and he was currently poking holes in it.

Despite just being small holes, the power that gushed out threatened to explode his body.

His body could not endure the impact of this power. Every attack brought with it a backlash and immense pain.

Even the Heavenly Qilin Demon Trees were unable to fully keep up. Despite appearing fully recovered on the surface, many internal wounds were starting to accumulate in his body.

Those internal wounds weakened him and reduced the power that he could unleash. The slightest misjudgment of how much power he could draw out could mean death for him.

The Six Star Battle Armor’s power was too terrifying. Compared to it, Long Chen was miniscule. Trying to control its power was like dancing on the tip of a blade.

Ye Ming unleashed a punch to receive Long Chen’s slash. As a result, a powerful explosion caused countless fragments of spacetime to fly through the air. The Heaven Devouring Fiend King’s arm exploded, while Long Chen was also blown back, hacking up blood.

This fiend king was a terrifying existence that had fought against the dragon king to the death. However, even though its physical body had reached that level, it could not endure Long Chen’s power.

Long Chen attacked once more, striking with even greater power.

BOOM!

The other arm of the fiend king also exploded.

“Die!”

Long Chen raised Evilmoon again, but now all the Heavenly Qilin Demon Trees had withered. All their life energy had been used up.

“You’re the one who’s going to die! As long as I block this one attack, you won’t have another chance. Hahaha, Long Chen, you really are foolish. I can easily see through your intentions. Heaven Devouring Blood Gathering, Unending Life!”

Ye Ming laughed, and the Black Armor Corps in the surroundings instantly withered and fell to the ground, turning to mush.

“This is…”

No one had expected Ye Ming to have such a trick. He was absorbing the Black Armor Corps’ life energy for himself.

In an instant, the endless Black Armor Corps vanished. Ye Ming’s arms grew back, and a beast-like pattern appeared on them.

“Qilin Heavenly Arm!”

Ye Ming suddenly stamped down on the ground and unleashed a powerful punch.

BOOM!

A blinding light erupted in the sky. It was like a star had exploded.

This explosion was the strongest one since the battle had started, causing the entire world to shudder. Long Chen shot back like a shooting star, creating a giant ditch in the ground.

In that instant, Long Chen’s aura vanished. When the light faded, it revealed the fiend king still standing in the sky. One of its new arms was blown away.

Even after absorbing the Black Armor Corps’ life energy, Ye Ming had been forced to sacrifice an arm.

“Hahaha, to think that you’d also end up like this one day. Even though you’re dead, I won’t let you off.”

The direction Long Chen was shot toward just so happened to be in front of Zhao Ritian. He laughed and charged over in search of Long Chen’s corpse.

Suddenly, an icy black weapon stabbed through his chest. Long Chen appeared out of the hole, holding Evilmoon.

“You perfectly embody the expression play stupid games, win stupid prizes,” said Long Chen, looking at Zhao Ritian’s terrified expression. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

When the Luo Spirit race saw that two emerald leaves had appeared on Long Chen’s back, they suddenly cheered and knelt on the ground, tears overflowing from their eyes.

“Mother tree!”
