Chapter 2882 Play With You

Long Chen slapped Chu Kuang in the face, sending him tumbling back. Chunks of his black flesh fell off his face, revealing some of his barely grown skin.

“Long Chen!”

Chu Kuang was enraged. Long Chen was so brazen as to attack him in front of everyone.

Dozens of people surrounded them in an instant. There were even Four Peak experts in their midst, looking ready to kill.

When Chu Huairen left, the head just also directly left. The spectators had only just started leaving when they saw Long Chen slap Chu Kuang. They immediately sat back down to watch.

“Long Chen, you dare to attack me in the trial hall! I’m going to report this right now! Just you wait!” raged Chu Kuang.

He was a genius that the Chu family had spent a huge amount of effort raising. No one had ever struck him like this. He had always been the one beating others.

However, against Long Chen, he suffered repeated losses. He hated Long Chen to the bone. Today, he had slapped him once more in front of the majority of the academy’s distinguished people. Such a humiliation was worse than killing him.

If it weren’t for the fire poison preventing him from fighting, he would be trying to kill him.

“Go ahead and report it. I’ll also report that you managed to escape the court by acting like a dead dog, tricking everyone. Now you’re acting like a wild dog randomly biting people. Your criminal charge isn’t small, so go ahead and report it. I’ll await the good news here,” said Long Chen indifferently.

Faking an injury in order to trick the court was definitely not a light accusation. Ignoring everything else, at the very least, fifty lashes of the fire whip would be unavoidable. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

Considering the current state of his body, fifty lashes of the fire whip would fully ignite the fire poison in his body, essentially crippling him.

Chu Kuang gnashed his teeth furiously. His face twisted with rage. He spat out, “Alright, Long Chen! Remember that there is no rest until death between us! I’ll make you regret coming to this world!”

“I’ve heard that so often that my ears are tired of it. But even after so many years, I’m still living alive and well. But those who said that to me, well, it’s so sad, but the grass on their graves has already grown high and tall.”

Long Chen walked right in front of Chu Kuang. Facing his furious appearance, Long Chen chortled, “I wasn’t originally interested in the divine competition, but that… what was that bad person’s name?”

“It’s Chu Huairen,” interjected Li Cai.[1]

“That’s right, that bad Chu person, I knew he wasn’t someone good with just a glance. Saying that you would definitely win has made me interested. I don’t dislike arrogant people, but I very much mislike people who are even more arrogant than me, especially those who don’t even have the ability to be arrogant. I’ve decided to play with you in the divine competition this time,” said Long Chen.

Long Chen was originally not interested in Chu Kuang at all. He was just some foolish child of a powerful family. However, today, Chu Huairen’s arrogance had angered him. He also saw just how big the Chu family’s influence was in the academy. If he wanted to grow here, he would need to make the Chu family submit, either by beating them into submission or pulling them out by the roots. Otherwise, he wouldn’t be able to cultivate in peace.

Long Chen was clear on his own matters. To peacefully cultivate wasn’t very possible for him. Since that was the case, why not play a bit bigger? He would use explosive power to pave the way in front of him.

Hearing that Long Chen would participate in the divine competition, Mu Qingyun was delighted. She clenched her fists and hugged Zhong Ling and Zhong Xiu. Li Cai was also excited. With Long Chen present, they had nothing to fear.

“Hahaha, good. Then let’s meet at the divine competition. I’ll show you my true power and how foolish you are to go against me.” Chu Kuang laughed and turned around.

As a result, he almost collapsed. With his injuries, his body wasn’t able to move so agilely. If people weren’t supporting him, he waddled like a dog pooping.

People from the Chu family helped bring Chu Kuang away. The onlookers scattered mostly, but some remained to discuss things quietly. Perhaps they were simply reminiscing after not seeing each other for a long time, or perhaps they were discussing Long Chen.

Long Chen and the others left in high spirits. The sky looked particularly blue. The air smelled particularly fresh. Chu Kuang had truly lost out this time. After being bullied by him for so long, they finally vented a bit.

Furthermore, these people now looked at Long Chen like he was a god. His display during the trial had been marvelous. He even managed to curse a magistrate and make him lower his head. Just how amazing was that?

“Boss San, when will we be as flashy as you?” asked Li Cai worshipfully.

“Cultivate and read more. If you had spent the time that you previously wasted on reading instead, you would definitely be in a different state than right now,” said Long Chen as he walked.

“That’s right, the books make the person! No wonder boss San’s temperament is so special! I need to work hard to catch up!” declared one disciple.

“Same! When you’re all alone, you get caught up in your dreams. Last time when we went hunting, a girl slept on my shoulder, and I’ve already figured out the names of our future children!” exclaimed another disciple.

“I feel like I’ve been getting better luck with girls lately. Yesterday, I locked eyes with one and she didn’t get bashful!”

“Give it up. Only someone as handsome as boss San can make girls bashful when he looks at them. For you, they’d only get afraid.

“No way…”

Long Chen’s agreement to join the divine competition left the Unfettered Alliance’s disciples so excited that they didn’t even know how to express it. Their words came out in a jumbled mess.

“Long Chen, our immortal competition is also going to start soon. I have to go prepare for battle. My opponents are very powerful. We don’t dare to be careless. Hopefully we can all win,” said Luo Bing.

The divine competition and the immortal competition occurred at the same time, but the locations were different. As for the other institutes, their competition formats were completely different and held at different times.

“Good luck.” Long Chen nodded.

“Long Chen, don’t lose to that bastard Chu Kuang! Otherwise, I’ll look down on you,” said Luo Ning.

“If I win, will you no longer look down on me?” asked Long Chen.

“Hehe, it depends on the situation,” laughed Luo Ning, leaving with Luo Bing to return to the Immortal Institute.

“Brother San, there’s still a month left until the divine competition. Should we increase the pace of the training?” asked Mu Qingyun.

“No, work and play should be balanced to get the best effect. Everyone, take a three day break. Don’t do anything you need to do. Just do your best to relax as much as possible. Three days later, we’ll start our training again. Also, don’t hand in the list for the competition yet. Leave it to the end,” said Long Chen.

Just as he was leaving, he clapped his forehead. “Hand over your immortal crystals.”
