Chapter 2144 The Blood Emperor’s Descendants

“Don’t look for trouble. I haven’t killed anyone in a few days, and it’s tough holding myself back. If you are in a hurry to reincarnate, I’ll send you on your way,” said Long Chen coldly.

He didn’t know if it was his bad luck flaring up again, but as soon as he left the original devil race, just when he was trying to be low key to avoid exposing his identity, someone disturbed him.

The more he didn’t want to cause trouble, the more others wanted to find trouble for him. Flames of fury rose inside him. Why was it that so many idiots ended up finding him instead of finding others?

Long Chen was wearing a black cloak with the hood covering most of his face. However, his icy killing intent exuded from his words, causing the two men to jump.

“Who are you?” probed one of them.

“Who are you to ask? Scram!” snorted Long Chen. Ignoring those ancient family alliance experts, he continued forward.

“How brazen! You dare to ignore us?!” The one who asked him was infuriated. He summoned his manifestation and unleashed a palm at Long Chen.

His hand became red like blood, and his Blood Qi rumbled like thunder. This was Long Chen’s first time encountering such a cultivation technique.

However, he didn’t care about it. He randomly swung his hand, slapping the infuriated man in the face, sending him flying back while coughing up blood.

As soon as Long Chen did it, he regretted it. In this world, the only one capable of such a beautiful slap was him. Hadn’t he just exposed his identity?

“Bastard!”

The other expert charged at him, but before he could reach him, Long Chen sent him flying with a kick.

They were just two Empyreans whose manifestations hadn’t even awakened. They weren’t qualified to be arrogant in front of him. Even if they were awakened Empyreans, they wouldn’t be qualified.

“Who are you?!” demanded the one who had been slapped. He knew that he had encountered an expert.

“Is it any of your business? You aren’t fit to know my name. Hurry up and scram. Take advantage while my mood’s still decent,” said Long Chen indifferently.

“Do you know who we are?!”

At this moment, Long Chen truly noticed something different about them. Although they were wearing robes of the ancient family alliance, they had another mark on their chests, one that looked like a blood-colored tree. Looking carefully, Long Chen saw that it was a wutong tree.

Seeming to notice that Long Chen had finally taken note of that mark, one of them shouted, “We are the Blood Emperor’s descendants! You actually dared to attack us! Do you believe me when I say you-!”

The speaker was once more slapped in the face, causing him to cough up more blood.

“Who cares about descendants of the Blood Emperor? Even the Stone Emperor’s had the crap beat out of them by me, so do you believe me when I say I’ll send you to see your ancestor if you keep talking?” snorted Long Chen. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

“You... you... you’re Long Chen...!”

Those two ancient family alliance experts instantly paled. Even their voices shivered.

Long Chen had destroyed the Mechanism Sect and then charged his way into the Stone race, practically beating Shi Lingfeng to the point that he had to kneel and beg for mercy. If Nangong Zuiyue hadn’t come at that time, Shi Lingfeng would have been killed. So when Long Chen mentioned beating the Stone race’s descendants, the two of them instantly realized his identity. They also became covered in icy sweat.

They might not fear anyone, but Long Chen wasn’t just anyone. Others wouldn’t dare to kill them, but Long Chen definitely wouldn’t mind.

“Sorry- sorry, we were disrespectful!” The two of them exchanged a glance and lowered their heads. After all, their lives were more important. There was a homicidal devil king in front of them, and their status couldn’t intimidate him.

“Since you’re the Blood Emperor’s descendants, does that mean that the heir of the Blood Emperor has also awakened?” asked Long Chen.

“Yes. The Blood Emperor’s own daughter, Xue Luocha, has inherited all the Blood Emperor’s divine abilities. We’ve come out now to sweep away all the other geniuses on the continent.” One of them immediately started to become arrogant again.

The other one glared at him and said, “Of course, we won’t be enemies with mister Long Chen. We won’t be sweeping you away for sure.”

Although they felt great respect for their Xue Luocha, she wasn’t present right now. Facing Long Chen, they couldn’t be arrogant.

The Peng Emperor, Blood Emperor, and Stone Emperor’s heirs had all come out. It was said that Xie Tianzi had an extremely deep relationship with the Corrupt Emperor, but Xie Tianzi was especially mysterious, and there weren’t many rumors about him.

On the other hand, there were quite a few legends about the Blood Emperor. It was said that the Blood Emperor had once fought a Sovereign but had been suppressed. Of course, too much time had passed to be sure about any such rumors.

It was said that the Blood Emperor had created a new cultivation path with blood at its core. Long Chen had truly sensed a strange energy within the two of their attacks just now.

Long Chen continued, “Is Xue Luocha beautiful?”

For some reason, the two of them looked at each other oddly and at the same time said, “Beautiful enough to eclipse the moon and shame flowers.”

“Alright, it seems that was a useless question. It doesn’t have anything to do with me.” Long Chen knew he couldn’t draw out any useful information from the two of them. He was about to leave when he suddenly recalled something and asked, “Why did the two of you block me in the first place?”

“Ah... that’s... nothing. We just wanted to ask if you’ve searched this area yet,” said one of them awkwardly.

They were currently searching for any questionable signs or traces. If they found any place that could be the location of the qi flow eruption, they would need to immediately report it. If their information was correct, they would get a huge reward.

Long Chen immediately understood. The two of them had wanted to force out his secrets. If he had found something, the accomplishment would go to them. Based on their conduct, he estimated that Xue Luocha was no good egg either. The leader was the one who raised the soldiers.

“Alright, you can scram. Count yourselves lucky today,” said Long Chen, flying off.

Seeing him fly off, the two of them sighed with relief. They suddenly realized that their backs were covered in icy sweat.

“Why would he appear here?”

“Don’t you see where he’s going? It’s the opposite of us. He’s definitely also looking for the location of the qi flow eruption. Everyone’s searching for it. We should hurry up too. Let’s pick a different path. We won’t find anything where Long Chen’s already been.”

Long Chen sped across the Martial Heaven Sea-Ring. Looking at the endless sea, he suddenly recalled many memories.

Back in the day, he had crossed the eastern sea on a flying boat to reach the Xuantian Dao Sect. Years had passed since then. He was no longer the same youth. His cultivation base had grown, but he was growing wearier as well. Perhaps that was the price of growth. Even the memory of when he had left the Phoenix Cry Empire with Little Snow replayed in his mind.

“Little Snow, are you alright? Will you be the same you once you’re reborn?”

Little Snow’s soul had merged with that mysterious giant egg, but Long Chen didn’t know the origins of that egg. He also didn’t know what the final result would be.

He thought of when he had been hunted by Marquis Ying back in the wilds of the Phoenix Cry Empire. Little Snow had been only a few months old but had chased after him to find him, ending up covered in wounds and bitten by a toxic viper. Long Chen had never forgotten that sight. Later on, Little Snow had sacrificed itself to save him. Long Chen had an urge to charge into the Yin Yang World right now just to take a look.

However, it was just a thought. He couldn’t actually do it. He could only wait for the day that Little Snow was reunited with him.

Flying over the sea, he saw many other experts flying around rapidly. However, those experts weren’t as confident as the other two and didn’t stop him.

Once he stepped onto land, he quickly found a city. Using the transportation formation, he arrived in the Eastern Xuan City. From there, he went to the Central Xuan Region. His first stop was the Martial Heaven Alliance.

As soon as he arrived, Qu Jianying met him. “During this time, more powers from the ancient era have come, each stronger than the last. Amongst them are the descendants of the Blood Emperor. Have you heard of them?”

“I encountered two people, who said that they were descendants of the Blood Emperor, and wanted to rob me,” said Long Chen.

“Did you kill them?” Qu Jianying started. Someone dared to rob Long Chen? Just how blind were they? She estimated that the two of them were already on the path to reincarnation.

“No, I’m not someone who likes causing trouble. After slapping them a couple of times, I told them to scram.” Long Chen waved his hand, indicating that he himself was very low key.

Hearing that, Qu Jianying was a bit more at ease. She did not want Long Chen to be surrounded by enemies.

Although last time he had managed to shake the Martial Heaven Continent by destroying the Mechanism Sect and attacking the Stone race, forcing the Stone race to lower their heads, things were not as quiet as they appeared on the surface. There were countless hidden dangers waiting.

“Good. Other than that, I should tell you that there’s been movement from the danger zone known as the Martial Heaven Sea-Ring,” said Qu Jianying gravely.
