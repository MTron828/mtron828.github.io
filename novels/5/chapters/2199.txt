Chapter 2189 Six Horn Sea Serpent

The arrival of the sea demon race shook people’s hearts. The previous movements of the sea demon race and their activity on the continent had made people guess that they might come for their own portion of the qi flow eruption.

However, that was just a guess, because in the past, the sea demon race had never participated in the competition for the qi flow.

That was because after the qi flow eruption, all the qi flow would disperse throughout the continent. It would be absorbed by the land and sea once more.

The Martial Heaven Sea-Ring was vast. Plenty of the qi flow would end up entering the sea. There was no need for them to participate in this.

However, all the signs had indicated that this qi flow stream would be the greatest throughout history, so people had speculated that the sea demon race might come to fight over it.

The Martial Heaven Sea-Ring had always been a mysterious existence. There were countless legends about it. It was too big, too deep for people to investigate fully. People were curious but also afraid of it.

Now, the sea demons had truly come, and with an army of millions at that. They had all reached the eleventh rank. Based on their powerful auras, they had to be the sea demons with the strongest bloodlines amongst their race.

Furthermore, none of their seniors had come. In other words, this army of sea demons possessed enough confidence to not worry about needing their seniors for protection.

The Martial Heaven Continent’s experts’ hearts rose up into their throats. No wonder it was said that the sea demon race possessed the power to match the entire continent’s lifeforms. This army before them made them believe it.

These sea demons outnumbered all the geniuses of the Martial Heaven Continent here. Just their numbers intimidated everyone.

“Now it’s troublesome.” Qu Jianying and the others’ expressions changed. These sea demons wanted Long Chen’s strongest qi flow stream.

“The Martial Heaven Continent has never had any conflicts with the Martial Heaven Sea-Ring. After so many years of peace, since you want it, you can take it. None of the people on our side has any opinions about it. However, some people might not give you this face. Whether or not you can take the strongest qi flow stream will be up to your own abilities.” Yu Xiaoyun smiled at the speaker of the sea demon race.

“Bastard, he’s getting someone else to do his dirty work!” Qu Jianying gnashed his teeth. This move was clear to everyone. “Guangyuan, Tianxuan, you are the people that Long Chen listens to the most. Can you advise him to leave his qi flow stream? They can come to our side. There’s enough qi flow here for them to absorb. We don’t need to fall for their scheme.”

If Long Chen refused to give up his qi flow stream, then the Dragonblood Legion would be facing the sea demon race that possessed the power to contend against the entire continent.

“Impossible.” The old man and Li Tianxuan shook their heads at the same time.

“I understand Long Chen. Even if he has to die, he won’t give it up. Otherwise, he wouldn’t be Long Chen,” said the old man.

Li Tianxuan was of the same opinion. No one could change Long Chen’s decisions. All they could do was watch.

Liu Ruyan, Yue Zifeng, Guo Ran, Ye Zhiqiu, Mo Nian, Li Qi, and Song Mingyuan returned to the Dragonblood Legion’s side. Their opponents had retreated.

“You...” Seeing that Li Tianxuan and the old man refused to even try to advise Long Chen, Qu Jianying shouted, “Dragonblood Legion, as the head of the Martial Heaven Alliance, I order you to come here.”

“Hahaha, so the Dragonblood Legion is full of cowards in the end!” As soon as Qu Jianying said this, someone opened his mouth to mock the Dragonblood Legion and provoke them into staying behind. “Even they can’t act tough in front of true power- ah!”

That person’s final scream wasn’t part of his provocation. It was because an arrow had struck him in the shoulder. That arrow’s power wasn’t very powerful, but now his entire body was turning black. Death energy spread throughout his body.

The speaker was a traitor of the Martial Heaven Alliance. He hastily took out an antitoxin pill, but he could only bring it up to his mouth before his Yuan Spirit dissipated.

Guo Ran sneered, “A full bottle doesn’t make a sound, but a half-full one splashes loudly. For people with half-empty heads who talk loudly, I will send you on the path of reincarnation for free!”

The experts present couldn’t help being afraid of Guo Ran. His crossbow was absolutely terrifying, and it was like a life-reaping death god. No one wished to be his next target. Whatever toxin he had applied to his arrow, it was ridiculous. Even if someone did consume an antitoxin pill, they would probably still die.

Furthermore, Guo Ran clearly had the ability to kill that person instantly with his attack, but he had instead used poison to make him suffer first. That viciousness gave others chills.

Guo Ran turned to Qu Jianying. “Alliance head, we naturally have to listen to you. Our boss also wouldn’t dare to ignore your words. However, our boss is our chief. We cannot go against his words. Boss has said that today, we cannot submit to anyone. Even if the big boss of the heavens came, we have to beat him until he kneels.”

Qu Jianying was infuriated. Even at this time, he was in a mood to talk glibly? Long Chen was fighting the Pill Fairy in the Brahma Divine Diagram. With the raging flames over there, Long Chen had no idea what was happening outside.

Just at that moment, two flame-wrapped figures appeared outside the Brahma Divine Diagram. The flame dragon behind Long Chen roared, while the phoenix behind the Pill Fairy shook its wings, raising the flames around it. Neither of their auras had dropped in the slightest.

The Pill Fairy icily stared at Long Chen. “There’s no need for me to fight to the death with you right now. If you can survive today, we can settle our debts later.”

The Pill Fairy returned to her camp, leaving Long Chen to face the sea demon race alone.

When the Pill Fairy returned to her side, she suddenly swayed, holding her head.

“Qingxuan, are you injured?” Yu Xiaoyun immediately went toward her.

“I’m fine.”

The Pill Fairy gave a cold reply before ignoring him. After forming hand seals, her divine mark on her forehead lit up. The divine halo behind her head brightened, and her pale face gradually recovered some color.

Yu Xiaoyun looked at the Pill Fairy helplessly. Ever since Yu Qingxuan had received the god’s inheritance, she had grown colder and colder to him, her father. There even seemed to be some kind of hatred.

Back then, when he had forced Yu Qingxuan to receive the god’s inheritance, she had begged him with tears in her eyes not to go through with it. But he had hardened his heart and activated the inheritance ceremony.

Ever since that time, Yu Qingxuan had never called him father. The daughter that had always wanted to be beside him whenever there was a chance had grown cold to him. The distance between them grew greater and greater.

Looking at her icy back, Yu Xiaoyun sighed and didn’t say anything else.

Everyone’s focus was on Long Chen and the army of sea demons. The army of sea demons stretched beyond the horizon.

The ones at the rear were like giant mountains. Seeing this army, people found it hard to breathe.

The experts of the sea demon race slowly walked forward. At their front was a tall and muscular man with six horns on his head. He had shoulder-length hair, and there was a natural iciness to his face. His physical body was so powerful that it felt like his Blood Qi was about to explode. Just a glance from him was enough to turn someone cold.

That man walked over to Long Chen and looked at him coldly. “I’ve heard of you. You are Long Chen, correct? Bring your attendants away, or we’ll kill you all-”

Pow!

Long Chen’s anger popped up before this man was even finished talking. His breath was disgusting, like rotting fish. Long Chen didn’t even bother listening to what he was saying toward the end. He directly slapped him in the face.

At this moment, Long Chen’s divine ring was still present, so this slap contained immense power. The man from the sea demon race was sent flying and caught by the sea demons in the back.

All the experts present, both friend and foe, were dumbfounded. Did Long Chen not even know who that person was?

This slap was so resounding that it caused everyone’s jaws to drop, including the old man’s. Long Chen had even bigger guts than he did.

Long Chen didn’t deceive him. He had said that he wanted to go big and get his interest and capital back from the previous battle. Now it seemed that he had underestimated Long Chen’s taste for vengeance. Was the sea demon race also within his calculations? Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

“I don’t dislike arrogant people, but I dislike people who are even more arrogant than me. If you have the guts, then why don’t you try repeating what you just said?” said Long Chen disdainfully.

The man from the sea demon race immediately roared, “Kill them all!”

The man’s manifestation appeared. Within it was a giant sea drake.

“It’s the Six Horn Sea Drake race!”

Seeing that giant sea drake, the senior experts immediately understood. This man came from the leading race of the sea demons.

Although the experts of the Martial Heaven Continent didn’t know much about the sea demon race, they knew that the sea demon race was under the leadership of the Six Horn Sea Drake race. While crossing the sea, upon encountering any Six Horn Sea Drakes, you had to flee. If you fought, you would be surrounded by sea demons in an instant.

Following the man from the Six Horn Sea Drake race, the other sea demons roared. The sky dimmed as the furious army of sea demons charged toward the Dragonblood Legion.

Seeing how easily things fell into place, Yu Xiaoyun and the others smiled. They could peacefully watch as the Dragonblood Legion was destroyed.
