Chapter 4052 Nirvana Overflow Heaven

When they saw the message from the Huayun Trading Company, even Long Chen was shocked. Although he knew that this cauldron’s origins would be astonishing, he didn’t expect it to be one of the ten great primal chaos divine items.

The primal chaos divine items were the strongest divine weapons of the nine heavens and ten lands. There were only ten of them, and Long Chen only knew that one of them was the Grand Xia Dragon Sparrow.

Xia Guhong had the Grand Xia Dragon Sparrow’s karmic luck supporting him. Thus, when he used a trace of its power, he was unstoppable.

And that was only a trace of its karmic luck, not the true Grand Xia Dragon Sparrow. But it was enough to terrify countless people.

As for this bronze cauldron in Long Chen’s hands, it was also one of the ten great primal chaos divine items. Furthermore, it was the actual item, not just some karmic luck.

“Wait, what does it mean, the Earth Cauldron?” asked Guo Ran, rereading the message.

“The Heaven Earth Cauldron is probably two cauldrons, the Earth Cauldron and the Heaven Cauldron. Only when they are merged together are they the true Heaven Earth Cauldron. This must be the Earth Cauldron,” said Long Chen. However, even he couldn’t say anything for sure, as he didn’t have further knowledge of the ten great primal chaos divine items, let alone the others.

“If that’s true, who knows how many people will come after you?” said Xia Chen heavily.

“Tch, what’s there to be afraid of? Anyone who dares to come, we’ll kill!” Guo Ran brandished his sabers obstinately.

This battle had caused Guo Ran’s confidence to inflate. These two sabers of his were made with the divine weapons he had smelted in the underground tomb of the three thousand worlds.

It could be said that his current equipment was as valuable as an entire city, and it embodied his greatest techniques.

With this battle armor, he could even fight Weng Taibei alone, so it could be seen just how powerful he was.Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“Boss, what do we do now?” asked Xia Chen.

Long Chen thought for a moment. “Did you finish what I asked you to do?”

“It’s done. In three more days, the formations should stealthily activate. The three branch academies will be revitalized, and the High Firmament Academy’s experts will be able to cross heavens,” said Xia Chen.

When Long Chen and the others left the three thousand worlds, he had told Xia Chen and Guo Ran to stealthily activate the three branch academies of the High Firmament Academy in the Violet Flame Heaven.

Long Chen knew that Enpuda, Liao Bencang, and the others’ focus would definitely be on him. He would then draw their attention, giving Xia Chen and Guo Ran a high chance of success.

However, Long Chen hadn’t expected Enpuda to be so treacherous. The latter had actually used Liao Bencang as bait and sacrificed him to open the hell gate. Thus, Long Chen almost died this time.

Fortunately, just as Long Chen planned, with Enpuda and Liao Bencang focusing on him, Xia Chen and Guo Ran managed to find the foundation stones of the branch academies and stealthily set up formations.

The formations would merge with the foundation stones. It would take some time to awaken them, but once they did, the High Firmament Academy would instantly sense it.

However, this was the Violet Flame Heaven, while the High Firmament Academy was in the Darklight Heaven. They were in different heavens, and the border of the heavens was tough. Thus, the amount of energy needed to awaken the foundation stones was much greater. If it was Long Chen, he definitely wouldn’t be able to pull it off. However, it was nothing difficult for Xia Chen.

“Three days? We can’t wait for that. The Huayun Trading Company’s information network is the fastest and most accurate. Although the Vermilion Bird Empire has locked down the information, there is no such thing as an impervious wall. If the Huayun Trading Company has received this information, the other major powers will soon receive it as well. We have to leave here within one day, or we might not be able to leave,” said Long Chen.

The Huayun Trading Company’s information network was top tier. However, the other major powers also wouldn’t be lacking in this regard.

In particular, the Soaring Dragon Company had a deep enmity with Long Chen, so they would definitely spread this information as quickly as they could so that everyone knew.

After all, the appearance of the Heaven Earth Cauldron would definitely drive countless experts crazy, to the extent that even experts on Ye Wusheng’s level would come. Although Long Chen was confident in himself, he wasn’t so crazy as to think that he was unrivaled. Now that the news had leaked, he had to leave.

“Should we ask for the protection of the Wine God Palace?” proposed Guo Ran.

Long Chen shook his head. “Since when did our Dragonblood Legion rely on others to survive? Furthermore, considering how major this matter is, not even the Wine God Palace might be able to stop it. We can’t implicate them.”

The Wine God Palace had graced Long Chen with their favor, especially Xia Guhong. He had treated Long Chen like a brother, so how could Long Chen cause trouble for him?

“Let’s go. We’ll go to the heavenly boundary river. We’re leaving the Violet Flame Heaven,” said Long Chen.

The heavenly boundary river was how Long Chen had entered the Violet Flame Heaven. Who would have thought that he would be leaving through it again after staying in the Violet Flame Heaven for just a while?

“Hehe, then are we going to the Nirvana Overflow Heaven? It’s even stronger than the Violet Flame Heaven!” Guo Ran was excited.

“Yes, we’re going to an even vaster world.”

Long Chen took a deep breath. The Nirvana Overflow Heaven was even more perfectly preserved than the Violet Flame Heaven. As its inheritances ran deep, the experts there were even stronger. Furthermore, the stronghold of the Long Aotian’s Long clan was located there.

In other words, going to the Nirvana Overflow Heaven would bring him one step closer to his father. Long Chen was nervous when he thought about that. He had no idea how his father was.

When it came to his mother, he hadn’t gained that much information, but he knew that with Luo Zichuan present, her life was not in danger.

Luo Zichuan was a smart man. If he refused to tell Long Chen the situation with his mother, he had to have his own reasons. Long Chen also refused to believe that his grandfather would harm his mother.

Thus, compared to his mother, he was more worried about his father. From the start, after dealing with Qingxuan’s matter, he had been thinking of going to the Nirvana Overflow Heaven to find his father. Even if he hadn’t exposed the Heaven Earth Cauldron, he would still be in a rush to go there.

“Hahaha, excellent! That fellow Mo Nian said that he would go to the Nirvana Overflow Heaven after leaving the three thousand worlds! Now, we can see who can make a name for themselves there first!” Guo Ran laughed excitedly.

“Who cares about making a name? He either couldn’t continue running where he was, or there were too many people who wanted to kill him, or he ran out of tombs to dig up,” said Long Chen disdainfully. He truly understood Mo Nian far too well.

“Let’s go!”

As Long Chen waved his hand, Xia Chen summoned their newly built flying boat. The curtain of the heavens was like rippling water, and the flying boat merged into the void just like that, vanishing without a trace.
