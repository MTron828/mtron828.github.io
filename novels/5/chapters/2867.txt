Chapter 2856 Wilderness

Long Chen went to the Pill Institute, or more accurately, the medicinal fields. He quickly found the supervisor from last time. Due to their last interaction, they could be considered old friends now.

That supervisor hastily greeted Long Chen, “Boss San, you’re back! This time… what do you want?”

Last time, Long Chen had taken some of his medicinal herbs and this supervisor had turned a blind eye to it. In return, Long Chen hadn’t exposed his embezzlement of these medicines. Just like this, they had a tacit understanding.

“Gather some herbs for me. I want fresh ones and one of each. I’ll pay you three times what the Pill Institute would pay you for them.” Long Chen got straight to the point.

“Boss San, what are you saying? If you want any, just ask! I don’t want any of your money!” said the supervisor with a cajoling smile.

As long as Long Chen didn’t make things hard on him, he would already light incense in thanks. Making money from Long Chen? He didn’t dare to do so.

“Go get them. One each. It’s not much money, and I can’t make you work for nothing. Treat it as me treating you to tea.” Long Chen waved his hand.

He knew that all the supervisors here were connected in their own network. They were familiar with each other’s medicinal fields.

However, Long Chen couldn’t be bothered to go through all the medicinal fields, picking plants one by one. He would rather have their help and save all that time.

Hearing this, the supervisor didn’t dare to tarry and immediately ran off. Two hours later, he returned with over three thousand plants.

“Boss San, some people that supervise their medicinal fields weren’t present, so I can only give you these for now. Take a look…”

Long Chen curled his mouth. Just from this supervisor’s gaze, Long Chen could see that he was probing him.

“Then take these. There are thirteen thousand immortal crystals here.” Long Chen tossed him a sack.

The supervisor was delighted but still put on a modest expression. “Boss San, you’re making things hard for this little one. Being able to help you is my honor. How could I take your money?”

“Boss San doesn’t make others work for free. These immortal crystals are yours. Think of a way to reach those supervisors and get me more plants. I’ll return tomorrow,” said Long Chen.

As he left, the supervisor called out, “Boss San, don’t worry, even if I have to break my legs running, I’ll get them all!”

After that, Long Chen tossed the plants into the primal chaos space, and the medicinal field inside grew once more. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

He knew that this fellow had refused to bring out everything because he was worried that Long Chen was only giving him lip service about paying him. If Long Chen didn’t pay in the end, he would have suffered a large loss.

That was why he had only brought over a few, to probe Long Chen. Hence, Long Chen didn’t just pay him in return but also gave him some extra. That way, he should be at ease and prepare more for Long Chen next time.

Long Chen then went to buy a better pill furnace. His old one was sold back for a discounted price, but he got back seventy percent of the capital. From this, he supposed that the Pill Institute had some conscience.

He spent over thirty thousand immortal crystals on a new pill furnace that was of a much higher quality than his old one. But the price was truly painful.

Even so, if he wanted to do good work, he needed a good tool. After that, by the time he returned to the training room in the God Institute, half a day had passed. However, Mu Qingyun was still unable to feel the pulse of her sword.

Her face was slightly pale. Seeing Long Chen return, she looked up and nervously said, “Brother San, am I especially stupid?”

No matter how she tried, she was unable to feel her sword. That was a large blow to her confidence. For her to become number two on the divine rankings showed that she was extremely talented. But that talent didn’t help her here.

“No, I would say that you’re just an ordinary idiot,” said Long Chen after a moment’s thought.

“Brother San…” Mu Qingyun was looking for comfort with that question, only for Long Chen to make it worse.

“It was just a joke. Don’t take it seriously,” said Long Chen with a smile.

“But I…”

“You’re too impatient. Things won’t go faster just because you’re in a rush. A sword cultivator doesn’t depend on talent but on a strong will. The training can end here. Everyone, stop!” called out Long Chen.

“Boss San, aren’t we training for a whole day? It’s only been half a day,” said Li Cai. His face was covered in sweat.

Teaching so many people was very tiring, but these disciples were all so dedicated that they couldn’t stop. The Elite Group seemed to have become addicted to the admiring gazes of these disciples.

“What can be taught in theory has already been taught. Gather up to go to the hunting grounds. Training that poses no danger is too ineffective.”

Long Chen directly asked for a flying boat from Mu Qingyun. They then formed a hunting party of two thousand people.

The hunting grounds of the God Institute were specifically made for disciples to hone their combat skills. There was definitely a certain level of danger here, but as long as there were enough people and the disciples were careful enough, the chances of death were extremely low.

Furthermore, the beasts here were specifically picked and tossed inside. They were all beasts with impure bloodlines, and thus limited combat potential. They were perfect for disciples to train on.

However, under Long Chen’s guidance, the flying boat passed through this hunting ground. After eight hours, Zhong Ling couldn’t help saying, “Brother San, any further and we’ll leave the hunting ground. It will be the wilderness. There will be no formation of the hunting ground blocking more terrifying beasts from appearing. We might be wiped out if we encounter some terrifying existence.”

The God Institute’s hunting ground was on its borders. There was a special formation blocking stronger beasts from entering while keeping the weaker beasts inside.

Outside of the hunting ground was a boundless wilderness with countless dangers. It was unknown how many people had refused to heed the warning and entered that wilderness, only to never return.

Hence, to these people, it was essentially a forbidden area. No one dared to enter.

“If you want to become an expert, how can you not face danger? Since you’ve chosen cultivation, a path of no return, there is nothing to be afraid of,” said Long Chen.

The barrier appeared in front of them at this time. It buzzed, giving them a warning that any further and they would be in dangerous lands.

However, Long Chen didn’t stop. He had Mu Qingyun send the flying boat right through the barrier and into the wilderness.

All the disciples’ hearts clenched once they passed the barrier. They were in a completely unknown world now.

The flying boat then continued for half an incense stick’s worth of time before a sudden explosion shook it. After that, the sky darkened. The disciples inside staggered and cried out.

A giant toad thousands of meters tall had appeared out of some hole. It opened its enormous mouth, and its tongue shot out, wrapping around the flying boat. It then began to pull them inside.
