Chapter 3554

The one roaring was precisely the valley master of the Magnificent Cliff Valley. Ever since Luo Zijun was slain, he had been waiting here, waiting for Long Chen to appear to get revenge for Luo Zijun. But the most important thing for him was to reclaim the Phoenix Blood Heavenly Silk Net.

Hence, when he saw Long Chen, he charged out first with a halo of light behind his head. That was the World King Divine Radiance.

The World King Divine Radiance was a mark of status of a World King. Early stage World Kings were unable to summon a very powerful World King Divine Radiance, and only those in the mid stage could unleash its real power.

Also, those capable of unleashing the World King Divine Radiance were the only existences that could rely on their own power to control World Domain divine items.

As for those previous experts of the Soaring Dragon Company, despite the Soaring Dragon Company clearly possessing some World Domain divine items, they hadn’t used them, not because they didn’t want to, but because those early stage World Kings were unable to use their power.

At this moment, the valley master of the Magnificent Cliff Valley charged at Long Chen, his sword piercing toward him. Against a mere Divine Lord, he actually unleashed his full power. He was clearly not going to give Long Chen any chance.

“Stay your hand!”

The two Elders of Yu Qingxuan were startled. Just now, they had only seen Long Chen. So, it was only once this valley master attacked that they realized Yu Qingxuan was on Long Chen’s back.

However, by the time they reacted, the valley master had already attacked, instantly reaching Long Chen.

Long Chen then swung his hand, and the Phoenix Blood Heavenly Silk Net opened. Without him having to do anything, it caught the valley master.

“What?!”

The valley master was shocked to be caught by the Phoenix Blood Heavenly Silk Net. He hadn’t expected that his Magnificent Cliff Valley’s priceless treasure would be something that Long Chen was capable of using.

BOOM!

His sword struck it head-on, merely causing a muffled sound. The giant net was too elastic, and his terrifying attack’s force was dissipated throughout it.

The valley master’s expression changed. He knew just how terrifying the Phoenix Blood Heavenly Silk Net was. Once caught, there would be no escaping.

Hence, the valley master spat out a mouthful of blood onto the Phoenix Blood Heavenly Silk Net, and Long Chen felt it quiver. Powerful Spiritual Strength started to sink into the Phoenix Blood Heavenly Silk Net.

Just then, its light increased. It actually refused to listen to Long Chen’s orders and began to rebel.

The Phoenix Blood Heavenly Silk Net was originally the divine weapon of the Magnificent Cliff Valley. It had been nourished by countless generations of valley masters, and it only submitted to Long Chen because it had no choice.

Now that the valley master was calling out to it again, it immediately started to resist, using the power of the valley master’s essence blood to dispel Long Chen’s spiritual mark.

Just then, another terrifying World King attacked, his sword going for Long Chen’s back.

“You dared to kill my disciple and steal my True Fire Sword! You must be tired of living!” shouted this elder, his voice like thunder.

“It’s the True Fire Sect’s patriarch!” A startled cry rang out as someone recognized this elder.

“Heavens, two seventh Heavenstage World Kings are attacking a mid stage Divine Lord together!”

It was already shocking enough for the valley master to attack. But for the patriarch of the True Fire Sect to attack as well, one from the front and the other from behind, were they not afraid of losing face?

“Scram!”

Long Chen had been focusing on resisting the valley master, not wanting to lose the Phoenix Blood Heavenly Silk Net. For the True Fire Sect’s patriarch to also attack him now, he was enraged. The Minghong Saber then slashed behind him.

BOOM!

In front of countless dumbfounded gazes, Long Chen’s saber unleashed a burst of divine light that actually caused the True Fire Sect’s patriarch to be blown back three whole steps. Every step sent him hundreds of miles away, causing the void beneath his feet to collapse.

“How can that be?!”

Countless experts stared in shock at Long Chen. A little mid stage Divine Lord had actually forced back a late stage World King?

Suddenly, Yu Qingxuan coughed up blood and fresh blood covered Long Chen’s neck, dyeing his clothes.

“Qingxuan!” Long Chen was shocked. With that attack just now, in her weak state, Yu Qingxuan was injured.

“I… I’m fine. Don’t worry about me.” Yu Qingxuan squeezed out a smile when she saw Long Chen’s concern.

That slight smile caused Long Chen to feel like millions of vipers were thrashing within his heart. His expression gradually became colder.

Thump.

Thump.

Thump

“...”

The world fell silent. Long Chen could no longer hear any of the sounds of the outside world. He could only hear his own heart beating.

“Are you angry?”

“Are you foolish?”

“Are you still questioning whether killing is wrong?”

“If you could make it so that everyone was afraid of you, would you be forced into this situation?”

A voice rang out in Long Chen’s mind, asking questions of him, interrogating his inner heart and soul.

“Long Chen… are you alright?”

Yu Qingxuan suddenly sensed something wrong with Long Chen.

Long Chen’s eyes had turned completely black. They were like two black holes. At the end of these black holes was an endless hell of death, one that could devour the ten thousand worlds.

For Long Chen to suddenly become motionless while Yu Qingxuan cried out, countless people thought that it was the result of receiving the attack of the True Fire Sect’s patriarch. He was probably too injured to move.

Zhao Mingxuan and the others had been flying away, but seeing this, they were delighted. This was their best chance to kill Long Chen. It was also their only way to cover up how embarrassing it was when they fled like stray dogs.

“Long Chen, you idiot, die!”

Zhao Mingxuan and the others instantly pounced. There were also the experts of the Devil race, Nether race, and Blood race as well.

Long Chen had killed countless members of their races, so it didn’t matter who killed Long Chen. They would all be heroes of their races and naturally wouldn’t let go of this chance. Tens of thousands of experts attacked Long Chen at once, and this scene shook everyone watching.

“Long Chen, what is wrong?! Wake up!” shouted Yu Qingxuan hurriedly.

Long Chen suddenly reached out and rubbed her cheek warmly. Although his face was still icy, his voice was warm. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“I’m fine. I just feel very aggrieved, very angry. I just want to protect you, so why are some people always trying to harm you? They have no respect in their hearts. They constantly challenge my bottom line, constantly forcing me down one path. Since that’s the case, fine. I will become a devil that slaughters this world.”

“Long Chen, you…” Yu Qingxuan stared at Long Chen, feeling stunned. Long Chen’s black eyes looked very frightening.

However, she could sense the warmth that Long Chen felt for her inside. It seemed as if Long Chen was willing to destroy this entire world for her.

Suddenly, the flames around Yu Qingxuan’s body vanished. Long Chen threw her out, causing her to appear before her two protectors instantly.

Once Yu Qingxuan was sent away, Long Chen’s face became cold once more. His gaze swept over everyone. It was like a devil had been reborn.
