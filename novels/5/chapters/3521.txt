Chapter 3510

They hadn’t expected Long Chen to instantly turn hostile. It was like a gentle rabbit instantly became a berserk dragon. His killing intent locked Zhao Mingxuan down.

Everyone jumped. They hadn’t expected this fellow that they detested and disdained to suddenly unleash such terrifying killing intent.

“If you insult me, I can treat it as ignorant farts. But if you insult my parents, then you are courting death. A dragon has a reverse scale, and if you touch it, you will definitely enrage it. I can’t be bothered to care about any of you, but that doesn’t mean that I’m afraid of you. If you want to die, let us meet on the life-and-death stage.” Long Chen looked at Zhao Mingxuan darkly.

It didn’t matter how these fellows insulted him; he could treat it all as a joke. But this arrogant fellow had actually talked about his parents. Hence, Long Chen instantly lost control.

If it weren’t for Yu Qingxuan sitting right beside him, he might have directly slashed his saber and killed this fellow. This group of brainless young masters was truly hateful.

Being locked down by Long Chen’s killing intent enraged Zhao Mingxuan. This was an unacceptable provocation to him. He was just about to speak when Yu Qingxuan spoke first.

“Young master Mingxuan, aren’t you all going too far? If I said that you had no father or mother, which is why you are so mannerless, would you be happy?” Yu Qingxuan had been nursing her anger this entire time. Now that Long Chen had exploded, she was immediately on his side. These people had truly gone too far.

Long Chen had shown such restraint, but they repeatedly pressed down on him. This wasn’t just targeting him now. Long Chen had been invited by her. So for them to target Long Chen like this, it was no different than targeting her as well.

The reason Long Chen felt these people to be foolish was because they were unaware that their own actions were driving Yu Qingxuan away from them.

All of them were like fighting cocks, making people feel disgusted. It was only when they saw Yu Qingxuan’s rage that Zhao Mingxuan apologetically said, “I was just joking with brother Long Chen. I didn’t expect brother Long Chen to be so petty. Well, just treat it as my mistake. I apologize.”

Zhao Mingxuan raised his wine cup and gestured to Long Chen. Although he apologized, there wasn’t the slightest sincerity.

Hence, Long Chen didn’t move nor raise his wine cup. He just looked at Zhao Mingxuan.

“You can apologize for yourself, but I cannot accept it. Every person must bear responsibility for their words and actions. To tell the truth, I really dislike people who think themselves omnipotent but lack any ability at all. All they do is talk about their family, their mother, their father, their sect, and their master to show off. In my eyes, those people are all contemptuous, using the glory of their predecessors to cover up how inferior they feel inside. Wherever they go, it’s like they’re afraid that people won’t know their status. They immediately have to show off their halos of light. But are those halos yours? Without them, what are you? I came from the lower world to the higher world, and I’ve killed so many people like you on the way. When death comes for you, there won’t be many of you who don’t piss in your pants.”

“You’re going too far!” shouted one of them.

“Too far? What? Can only princes vent their anger, but the commoners can’t even light a lamp? You humiliating others is simply natural, but for me to say the truth is too far? Let me make a comparison. Just how transcendental is fairy Qingxuan’s status? Just how did she report her name and status though? If she showed off like the rest of you, would you even be qualified to sit together with her?” sneered Long Chen.

When Long Chen turned the topic to Yu Qingxuan, they hastily shut their mouths. They naturally wouldn’t be so foolish as to attack fairy Qingxuan.

“Fairy Qingxuan is sweet and gentle. She doesn’t want to use her status to suppress others. Hence, she treats every single person sincerely. But as for the rest of you? Your family, your father and mother, even your master’s statuses are all spat out to make yourselves look good. Why don’t you bring me to your ancestors’ grave so that you can dig them out and introduce me to every single one of them?” said Long Chen disdainfully.

Yu Qingxuan almost laughed, but she knew that this wasn’t the place to laugh, so she endured.

Although his words were a bit too far, that was out of emotion, and they were correct. Furthermore, it was the other side that had attacked him first, while he was simply counterattacking. Yu Qingxuan didn’t feel like he was doing anything wrong. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

As for Yu Qingxuan’s two guards, they had faint smiles on their faces. They felt that this little fellow’s way of talking was very interesting.

“Brother Long Chen…” said Feng Xiang.

“Don’t call me brother. Just call me Long Chen. I don’t like being called brother from the front while being stabbed in the back by the same person,” said Long Chen indifferently.

Feng Xiang coldly said, “Everyone is introducing themselves so that we can get along better. No one thought that you would be so sensitive. Everyone here has their own status and position. Is there a problem with getting to know each other and giving a more detailed explanation so that we can mutually benefit? We are only so polite to you to give fairy Qingxuan face. I hope you know your own position.”

He wanted to play this game with Long Chen? He was too immature. If they wanted to target him, then they could target him. They didn’t need to come up with so many excuses.

Long Chen smiled lightly. “Everyone is smart. Does the veil really need to be torn off of certain people’s faces? If so, I don’t mind doing it.”

These people were intentionally targeting him, and Yu Qingxuan had witnessed it clearly. No matter how they quibbled, they wouldn’t be able to change reality.

Long Chen’s goal was only to draw Yu Qingxuan’s attention. What the rest of them thought of him, he didn’t care.

“Can we change topics? Young master Feng Xiang, didn’t you say that the food was prepared?” With the atmosphere being so awkward, Yu Qingxuan finally spoke up.

Feng Xiang clapped his forehead. “My apologies, I’ve neglected you.”

Feng Xiang snapped his fingers, and beautiful attendants immediately came out, carrying plates full of delicacies.

With the smell of various delicacies filling the air, the atmosphere once more warmed up. The smell immediately increased everyone’s appetite.

These delicacies all contained dense flame essence. As soon as they entered the mouth, dense flame energy would spread throughout the body. It was both delicious and of great nourishment. It was an absolute luxury to flame cultivators.

With the good food on the table, the previous displeasure seemed to be forgotten. They all began to toast each other, and in order to not leave Long Chen out, Yu Qingxuan offered her first toast to him.

When Long Chen drank the wine in his cup, he was startled. “The Wine God Palace’s wine?”

This time, it was Feng Xiang’s turn to be shocked. This was the wine that his father had concealed for countless years. It was made by an expert of the Wine God Palace.

His father had only been given three jugs. After that, he had drunk one, leaving two more jugs. In order to entertain Yu Qingxuan, his father then endured the pain of losing one of the last two jugs.

Feng Xiang had been hoping for Yu Qingxuan to taste it and be delighted by it before he said the origin of this wine. He hadn’t expected Long Chen to say it first.

Yu Qingxuan drank her cup as well. She found that the wine energy was gentle and long-lasting. It was like she was drinking a river, and it also left a strong aftertaste. Seeing that Long Chen was able to tell the origin of this wine, she was shocked. She looked at Feng Xiang. “Is this really the Wine God Palace’s fine wine?”

Feng Xiang was irritated at having the limelight stolen by Long Chen, but he also couldn’t express it and could only nod. Yu Qingxuan’s beautiful gaze then turned toward Long Chen.
