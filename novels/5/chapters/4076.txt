Chapter 4065 Unmatched Power

When the giant crystal core flew into that person’s hand, astral light flowed out. The next moment, the enormous crystal core shrank and was caught by him.Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Crunch.

The warrior directly opened his mouth and bit down, causing sparks to fly around. To everyone’s surprise, the sea whale’s crystal core was forcibly devoured bite by bite.

Long Chen and the others stood in stunned silence, unable to react as they watched the astonishing scene unfold before them. The individual before them appeared utterly famished, devouring the crystal core with an almost desperate intensity. When he was done, a gradual spark of vitality slowly began to shine on his body. He seemed to have been revitalized.

Suddenly, the Ghost Ship quivered and he actually jumped to the sea whale’s head. That was where the crystal core had flown out of.

He then reached in and pulled. As he did so, the heavens quivered and astral light condensed into a starry giant behind him.

The starry giant was as tall as the heavens and was composed of the light of billions of stars. At this moment, this giant figure also reached toward the sea whale’s head.

BOOM!

With a heaven-shaking explosion, the sea whale’s corpse unleashed huge waves, while Long Chen and the others saw something unimaginable.

They saw the giant starry hand forcibly pull out the sea whale’s giant spine.

The immense power caused its corpse to deform and the sea demons to flee in terror.

BOOM!

An enormous spine then appeared above the nine heavens, so enormous that it looked like a heavenly whip, giving off a terrifying divine pressure.

When the sea whale died, it dissipated all its defenses so that others could devour its body. However, there were two places where it could not dissipate its energy. Those places were its crystal core and its bones.

The crystal core was where all its energy concentrated, while the bones were the foundation that supported its immense body. Thus, even the sea whale was unable to dissipate the energy within them.

It was only once its flesh and blood were fully consumed that the energy of its crystal core and bones would slowly dissipate. And only then could its bones sink to the depths of the sea and continue providing food for the lifeforms at the bottom of the sea.

When the spine was ripped out of its body, it was like a divine whip, an existence that shook countless souls.

When the astral light and giant figure vanished, the whip rapidly shrank until it was only three meters long and then wrapped around the warrior’s waist.

The warrior looked around as if appraising where he was. After that, he simply stepped into the void. With a few steps, he vanished, leaving behind the shocked Long Chen and the others.

“How terrifying!”

“What level is he at!?”

Guo Ran and the others stared at each other, stunned.

The Heaven Venerate that they had previously encountered had been so powerful that even their combined forces hadn’t been enough to beat him.

After that, they entered a fiend eye and saw Uncle Tree kill a Heaven Venerate with one blow. That told them that even Heaven Venerates were not unrivaled existences.

Then they encountered this lifeform of the primal chaos era. He had been on the verge of death, but as soon as he woke up, he managed to rip out the sea whale’s crystal core and spine.

After he consumed the crystal core and seemed to take the spine as a weapon, he simply left. In front of him, perhaps even Heaven Venerates could only kneel and scram away.

“Following boss always lets me see more of the world. People ask me why I’m so low-key. The main thing is that how could I be high-key after seeing so many terrifying existences?” said Xia Chen with a hint of terror.

Arrogant people were people who hadn’t seen the world. People who had seen the world never felt themselves to be so powerful because they had seen a vaster world. Only frogs at the bottom of a well continued to croak loudly as if afraid others wouldn’t know of their existence.

“Fuck, he didn’t even say thank you! What strongest warrior beneath the starry sky? He’s simply rude!” Although Long Chen didn’t mind, as he didn’t think that this person could give him anything good anyway, for him to leave without even saying a word was not very polite.

“Boss, what are you talking about?” asked Guo Ran and the others, feeling startled.

Long Chen had yet to tell them about the Warriors of the Starry Sky. Now that they asked, he explained simply. Guo Ran and the others had also previously never heard of Warriors of the Starry Sky. But after seeing this person’s terrifying power, they had to agree with Long Chen’s explanation.

“The strongest warriors beneath the starry sky. It seems that they need not have any qualms about that statement,” said Xia Chen.

“That was because, I feel like once the Dragonblood Legion reaches the peak, we’ll be the ones to have that title,” said Guo Ran confidently.

“Who are you bragging to? If you have the energy, you should think about how to raise your own power. If you aim so high that the footsteps are too big, you might pull a muscle,” said Long Chen.

The power of this warrior was so great that it was enough to make others feel despair. Saying that they would surpass this person was definitely bragging too early.

The Warrior of the Starry Sky was gone, while the sea demons devouring the sea whale were also scared away. But it probably wouldn’t be long before they all came back.

On the Ghost Ship, no one dared to attack Long Chen and the others, so everything went smoothly. Xia Chen continued to steer them on their way, going around the sea whale’s corpse.

As they traveled, Long Chen tried to get the puppets under control. But despite his best efforts, he was unable to do so. Just like that, his dream of turning them into his puppets couldn’t come true.

Now, all they had left to do was take a long journey across the heavenly river. Thus, Long Chen decided to use the Earth Cauldron to refine pills.

He should really refine more pills. As before this, all of his Immortal King Pills had been distributed to everyone. Through the Huayun Trading Company, he was able to send pills to the Luo family in the Darklight Heaven, along with countless Heavenly Dao Fruits. Long Chen wanted to turn the Luo family into a supreme force to make up for his mother’s actions.

During this time, the Demon Moon Furnace and the Moon and Star Refining Furnace had not been slacking either. They helped Long Chen refine countless pills. Some were given to Xia Chen and the others, and some were sent away.

Thanks to it, Xia Chen, Guo Ran, and the others reached the seventh Heavenstage of the Immortal King realm. Their Heavenly Dao Crowns grew increasingly solid, and so did their control over heaven and earth’s energy.

Right now, only Long Chen was still at the initial Immortal King realm. He didn’t even count as having reached the first Heavenstage. In terms of realm, he had been tossed far into the distance.

However, he was in no rush. Even the dragon expert had told him that the cultivation path of the Nine Star Hegemon Body Art was one that focused on the physical body as a foundation. After raising the power of his physical body, raising his realm would be as easy as raising a hand. Moreover, he didn’t even have to worry about his foundation growing unsteady.

When Long Chen took out the Earth Cauldron to refine pills, he suddenly realized a problem.

“If I use the Earth Cauldron to refine pills, won’t my heart-devil be released?”

In an instant, Long Chen’s excitement vanished. If his heart-devil was unleashed, it would disturb his mind and emotions. Furthermore, given that Long Chen had trapped him this time, no one could guess what kind of retaliatory actions he might pursue.

“Well, I suppose I’ll take a look. Perhaps we can talk it out.” Long Chen carefully opened the lid the tiniest bit. Any movement from his heart-devil and he would slam it shut.

However, when his mind crept into the Earth Cauldron, Long Chen’s expression completely changed. The Earth Cauldron was completely empty, and the sealed heart-devil was gone.
