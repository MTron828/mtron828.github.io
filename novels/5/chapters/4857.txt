Chapter 4846 Yellow Spring Pavilion, Heaven Heart Hall

When Long Chen and Mo Nian looked over, even they were shocked by Gao Jianli’s appearance. Half his face was a skull, while the other half was bloody flesh—a truly frightening sight. However, after observing him, Long Chen redirected his attention back to the martial stage.

Long Chen had no favorable opinion of the Violet Palace Sect, and he only felt somewhat close to Lu Ziqiong. In fact, Long Chen didn’t even feel good about Lu Ziyu. If she wasn’t Lu Ziqiong’s sister, he wouldn’t have brought her here.

Normally, because of his relationship with Lu Ziqiong, Long Chen would rise and bow, or at the very least nod in greeting. However, Long Chen couldn’t be bothered to do so on this occasion.

Unexpectedly, Gao Jianli spoke to Long Chen first. “Dean Long Chen, on behalf of the Violet Palace Sect, we congratulate you on your upcoming victory.”

His declaration startled the surrounding experts. Dean? Just who was a dean? The young man who was about to fight Cao Shaoqing?

Since he had spoken, Long Chen turned back to him and cupped his fists. “Many thanks, Sect Master. I sure hope for that to be the case!”

Long Chen’s response was neither warm nor cold as he maintained a certain distance from them. He knew very well that the Violet Palace Sect was behind everything that resulted in his fight with Cao Shaoqing, and he did not want to be used by them.

Gao Jianli seemed nonchalant about Long Chen’s apathetic response, but a cold light gleamed deep in his eyes. However, this wasn’t reflected in his expression as he calmly remained seated, and the experts from the Violet Palace Sect quickly followed suit.

Seeing this scene, Lu Ziqiong and Lu Ziyu felt a bit uneasy. Their Lu family was one of the three major families of the Violet Palace Sect. While the two of them might count as top experts in their family, they were not its peak geniuses. As a result, they were now in an awkward position as Long Chen stood out among them all. Having their own sect’s heavenly geniuses, who were typically far above them, staring at Long Chen with envy put them on edge.

Just then, on the other side, a tottering old man with wrinkles like tree bark and half-closed eyes settled down with assistance from his attendants. His gaze swept over the crowd until it landed on Long Chen. Seeing him, Long Chen narrowed his eyes. The minute their eyes met, he felt a strange energy inside him fluctuate.

The strange thing was that if this elder’s gaze hadn’t met his own, Long Chen might not have even sensed this fluctuation.

“Interesting. This fellow cultivates the Ghost Dao,” remarked Mo Nian with curiosity.

Yu Luo looked at him strangely. “You have a keen observation. He is indeed a cultivator of the Ghost Dao and also the master of the Yellow Spring Pavilion. His nickname is Owl, and no one knows his real name.”

“The Yellow Spring Pavilion... that explains it,” Mo Nian responded with a nod of understanding.

“What’s his story?” asked Long Chen.

Shaking his head, Mo Nian replied, “There’s no story. But I’ve rob—cough... I mean, after years of archaeology, I’ve encountered some graverobbers that cultivated the Ghost Dao. You can say that I’ve had some interactions with them.”

“By interactions, you mean stealing their business, is that correct?” asked Long Chen, looking speechless.

“What business? I'm an archaeologist uncovering the past, revealing the true face of history! It's a noble pursuit for humanity—no, for the entire cultivation world! Those who practice the Ghost Dao are delving into dark arts, harnessing Ghost Qi. How dare you compare them to me?” argued Mo Nian ferociously like a cat whose tail had been stepped on.

“It was just a joke. No need to fret,” replied Long Chen with a smile.

“This isn’t something to joke about. However, there is one thing you should take note of. Practitioners of the Ghost Dao wield incredibly unique and mysterious techniques—ones you've likely never imagined, let alone seen. One mistake and you will find yourself in deep shit,” warned Mo Nian.

Spending entire days in tombs, Mo Nian often encountered strange things. Although he refused to admit it, there were occasions where he inadvertently had to “steal their business”. Having fought with cultivators of the Ghost Dao, he had gained a certain level of insight into their practices and techniques. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

At this moment, another platform lit up, and an old crone with a cane appeared.

“That is the master of the Heaven Heart Hall. I don’t remember her name, but she is also a vicious character. I heard that the former master was her husband, but he died at her hands. Outsiders are not privy to the details,” introduced Yu Luo.

“A woman who likes to gossip will be disliked no matter how they look on the outside. It only shows your petty heart.” That old crone suddenly glared at Yu Luo, her wrinkled face brimming with an icy ferocity.

She had clearly heard Yu Luo’s words, which was startling. After all, Yu Luo’s conversation with Long Chen was on the other side of the martial stage and not spoken loudly.

While Yu Luo did not respond to her provocation, Mo Nian grasped that chance to say, “An old woman with a malicious mouth and dirty looks will be disliked even if she doesn’t say anything.”

Hearing this, Long Chen almost cheered. Every single one of Mo Nian’s words was spot-on. Using the term "old" with "woman"? That was practically taboo.

“You little brute, don’t even think about leaving Devil Fall City alive!”

As expected, Mo Nian’s words had an immediate effect. The hall master's expression contorted with rage, and an ear-piercing roar echoed out, causing countless experts to clutch their heads in pain. Some of them nearly fainted from the intensity of the sound.

“Ugly people are really odd. It was you who provoked our magnanimous, beautiful, fairy-like race leader Yu Luo first. Can others not retort when crap spews out of your filthy mouth? Being old and ugly isn’t a sin, but how can your temper be so terrible? What kind of man would fall for you? I truly can’t comprehend it,” Mo Nian remarked with a shrug, his expression indescribable.

“Die!” The ugly hall master roared angrily, and a hand resembling a chicken claw stretched out toward Mo Nian through space.

Mo Nian snorted in response. However, before he could react, the martial stage quivered, and an irresistible force pushed back the fugly hall master.

“Hmph, you guys dare to ignore the rules nowadays!” A powerful voice rang throughout the stage, sending shivers through everyone’s heart.

“City lord!”

A massive figure appeared on the only empty viewing platform, towering like an iron structure. At this moment, a tsunami-like pressure washed over everyone present.

“What a terrifying pressure!” exclaimed Long Chen and the others. This pressure surpassed anything they had encountered before—it was clearly beyond the level of ordinary Heaven Saints.

What intrigued them even more was that the figure wore a cloak that covered his face. Unlike others who arrived in groups, he slowly sat down on his viewing platform alone. The atmosphere became deathly silent in his presence.
