Chapter 4366 Blood Debt Paid With Blood

“Despicable!” people cried out. After all, this expert from the Great Desolate World had just launched a shameless sneak attack on Long Chen.

Before this, Long Chen and the Dragon Elephant expert’s clash had been a straightforward fight, and that was why no one from the Dragonblood Legion had moved.Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

However, everything changed when this expert resorted to a sneak attack, infuriating the Dragonblood Legion.

“Since you’re so shameless, there’s no need for us to hold back. Brothers, kill them all!” shouted Guo Ran.

“Kill!”

The Dragonblood warriors took out their weapons and charged forward like hungry wolves.

BOOM!

At this time, a heaven-shaking explosion erupted on Long Chen’s side. The expert wielding the white bone blade ruthlessly stabbed it into Long Chen’s back. Fortunately, Long Chen had summoned a seven-color shield beforehand, and it forcibly blocked this attack.

The void then quivered, and the attacker slowly appeared. When everyone saw that figure, they were shocked.

“Shadow race!”

So it was a Shadow race expert. No wonder he had such skill in hiding, and no one had noticed him.

Long Chen, however, surprised the Shadow expert by having set up defenses in advance. Most shocking of all was that he could fend off both the Dragon Elephant’s spear and the Shadow expert’s killing blow at the same time.

Despite the silent nature of the assault, it carried the full extent of the Shadow expert's power, yet it failed to breach Long Chen's formidable shield. The Shadow expert instantly had a bad feeling.

He quivered, seamlessly blending into the void, becoming as transparent as water. Following the failure of his lethal strike, he swiftly retreated—a standard maneuver for assassins.

“World Extermination Flame Lotus!”

However, before he could escape, a slender hand holding a white flame lotus appeared, and the flame lotus exploded.

This was different from Long Chen’s immense World Extermination Flame Lotus, which was thousands of miles wide. This flame lotus was only the size of a fist, looking both beautiful and refined.

Nevertheless, this refined flame lotus was even more lethal. After going through the heavenly tribulation, Huo Linger comprehended a new technique.

Back when the flames of the ten thousand Daos tried to refine Long Chen when he was trapped in the fake Earth Cauldron, Huo Linger absorbed their power. Hence, not only had her power grown, but she had also made countless breakthroughs in terms of comprehension.

The flames of the ten thousand Daos encapsulated all flames within the nine heavens and ten lands. Although only a trace of their individual powers had appeared, they had merged into one back then. After absorbing it, Huo Linger received enlightenment and started to create her own flame techniques.

With all that enlightenment, Huo Linger managed to modify the foundation of this technique and came up with this mini World Extermination Flame Lotus.

This fist-sized flame lotus was actually a compression of that enormous flame lotus, so its power was incredibly concentrated. The moment it exploded, the world was covered in terrifying white flames.

“AHH!”

A wretched figure screamed within the sea of white flames and came flying out of it. It was precisely the assassin of the Shadow race.

Even someone as strong as him was left in a wretched state from Huo Linger’s attack. White flames enveloped him, and he did his best to extinguish them by patting his body.

BANG!

Suddenly, a shocking scene occurred. Due to slapping his own body too hard, his hand actually exploded.

His shattered hand then transformed into dozens of ice fragments that fell to the ground, still burning. It was like meteors falling to the ground.

The Shadow race expert continued to scream in terror and no longer dared to pat himself. He simply allowed the white flames to burn him as he fled deep into the Great Desolate World.

“Raging Flame Dragon Cage!”

All of a sudden, the Shadow race expert was surrounded by pillars of white flames, akin to an enormous cage.

“Raging Flame Deathblow!”

When Huo Linger’s hand seals changed, the flame prison rapidly shrank. In response, the Shadow expert screamed in terror. His manifestation burst into existence as he tried to stop it.

However, no matter how he struggled, the prison continued to shrink. A powerful pressure then crashed down on him.

“Save me!” the Shadow expert suddenly shouted.

Following that, the void quivered, and four figures shot toward Huo Linger. They had incredibly powerful auras that rivaled those of the Dragon Elephant or the Shadow expert.

All six of the Six Great Lords, the strongest experts of the Great Desolate World’s junior generation, had appeared now.

The strongest of them was the Dragon Elephant expert, but he was suppressed by Long Chen, and the Shadow expert was trapped by Huo Linger, his life hanging by a single thread. No longer able to sit still, four of them attacked together.

BOOM!

At that moment, a piercing scream erupted from the Dragon Elephant expert. Startled, the four of them swiftly turned around and were so terrified that their hair stood on end.

They saw Long Chen holding the speartip in one hand, forcing the Dragon Elephant expert back further and further away. Then, with a swift motion, Long Chen seized the spear with both hands and forcefully thrust the spear base into the chest of the Dragon Elephant expert.

“The Dragon Elephant race is nothing. In your next life, remember not to say big words when you don’t have the power to back them up,” said Long Chen. His arms suddenly shook.

“Stop!”

The resonating roar of an Eternal expert filled the air, accompanied by a terrifying aura that targeted Long Chen.

However, it was too late. Despite the pressure, Long Chen unleashed his power without hesitation, blowing the Dragon Elephant expert apart violently.

“You damn human race! I will make you pay your blood debt with blood!”

The void ruptured into chaos. An elder wreathed in an Eternal aura appeared, his Blood Qi erupting. A golden spear then stabbed toward Long Chen.

“Pay blood debt with blood? Alright, we’ll do as you say!”

Long Chen’s gaze crackled with intensity. When he raised the seized spear, the river of stars behind him quivered, and the spear became covered in countless star marks.

“He can use the Dragon Elephant race’s ancestral divine weapon? How can that be?!” The Great Desolate World’s experts let out startled cries, unable to believe what they were seeing.

This divine weapon could only be activated using the Dragon Elephant race’s bloodline. Long Chen was a human, so it was impossible for him to use it.

However, the spear in his hand grew brighter with time, and its aura also intensified. Suddenly, cracks appeared throughout the spear as if it couldn’t endure his power.

Long Chen suddenly stabbed the spear at the Eternal expert in front of him.

BOOM!

Long Chen’s spear had yet to even touch his opponent when it suddenly exploded, unable to contain his power. However, the moment it exploded, a river of stars was unleashed, crashing toward that Eternal expert.
