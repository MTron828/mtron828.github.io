Chapter 3833 Appearing One After Another

Long Chen and the others quickly noticed that Shi Yang wasn’t shouting at them. He was looking behind him at the entrance to this area.

“Shi Yang, what a coincidence!”

An arrogant voice came from there. Following that, the flame-wrapped Yin Changsheng walked in.

Also, he wasn’t alone. Thousands of the Sacred Pill Hall’s disciples followed him. Just like Shi Yang’s group, they were all Supreme heavenly geniuses, elites amongst Supremes.

“When did Supreme heavenly geniuses become so cheap? Where are they all coming from?!” Seeing so many Supreme experts, Guo Ran couldn’t help feeling profoundly powerless.

He had a Supreme Bone, and although he didn’t dare to say that he was unrivaled, he still felt that he should be an outstandingly rare existence.

However, Supreme heavenly geniuses were everywhere here. They were as common as dogs. That was quite the blow to Guo Ran.

“It’s not surprising. Many of them have heavy auras, and their spiritual fluctuations are a bit different. They are clearly heavenly geniuses that sealed themselves. The heavenly geniuses of hundreds, thousands, or even hundreds of thousands of years are accumulated in this era. It’s only natural,” said Yue Xiaoqian.

A powerful race like the devil race had an unimaginable foundation. Although the number of Supreme heavenly geniuses present looked astonishing, this was the result of the devil race’s various branches accumulating experts over a great deal of time.

Just like them, the Sacred Pill Hall was also an existence with countless years of history. Flame cultivators depended on chance and the luck of the era. As many people were dissatisfied with their own era, they sealed themselves, waiting for a better era to emerge. It wasn’t surprising.

The reason Guo Ran found it surprising was because they hadn’t seen so many Supreme heavenly geniuses in the Nine Underworld Hall and the Bloodkill Hall. So, he had assumed that the Sacred Pill Hall would be the same, but their power was actually this terrifying.

“You followed me?”

Shi Yang looked at Yin Changsheng’s smile, and killing intent appeared in his eyes.

“Followed you? There is only one entrance to this heavenly tomb. Tell me, what could I do that wouldn’t count as following you?” sneered Yin Changsheng mockingly. He didn’t care about Shi Yang. He didn’t even bother coming up with an excuse.

Clearly, he had followed Shi Yang. Considering how large his group of devil experts was, it was all too easy to notice him.

“This Fusang Tree is mine. As for the rest, I’m not interested.” Yin Changsheng’s gaze instantly fell on the Fusang Tree. As a flame cultivator, this Fusang Tree was a must-have.

“Big words. If you say it’s yours, it’s yours?” said Shi Yang coldly.

“If you don’t agree, I can kill you first and then take the Fusang Tree,” sneered Yin Changsheng.

Hearing this, the devil experts were enraged and took out their weapons. They were already famous for their viciousness, and being looked down upon like this instantly provoked their killing intent. As long as Shi Yang gave the word, they would immediately attack the Sacred Pill Hall’s experts. They were unafraid of death.

The Sacred Pill Hall’s experts also took out their weapons, ready to fight. As the top experts of the Sacred Pill Hall, they were unafraid.

Suddenly, clapping sounds rang out and a figure walked out of the darkness. He appeared silently with no warning, so everyone jumped in shock.

“Ji Wuming!”

Startled cries rang out. This person was Enpuda’s personal disciple, Ji Wuming.

Ji Wuming came alone. Without his followers, he walked right out of the shadows like a silent specter. No one knew how he had done this. Ji Wuming had his hands clasped behind his back.

Standing in the air, his robes fluttered around him, and his figure occasionally grew illusory, as if he might vanish into the void at any moment.

“This heavenly tomb can’t be split only between you two. I’m also thinking of getting a portion. Are the two of you willing to give me this face?” asked Ji Wuming lightly.

Although he was alone, he was completely calm and full of confidence. He wanted his portion as well.

“Don’t look at him, or you’ll be sensed,” transmitted Long Chen to Guo Ran and Xia Chen.

The current Ji Wuming had completely changed. He was ephemeral, and even Long Chen’s powerful mental energy was unable to lock onto him.

This fellow had probably made some terrifying breakthroughs as well, otherwise, he wouldn’t be so confident as to demand a portion from both the devil race and the Sacred Pill Hall.

Ji Wuming didn’t wait for them to fight and secretly profit. That meant that he was confident enough to openly take what he wanted.

When Yin Changsheng and Shi Yang saw Ji Wuming, their pupils shrank. Yin Changsheng said, “I didn’t expect you to take that step first. I underestimated you before.”

Ji Wuming smiled. “To tell the truth, I’m only slightly faster than you. Although I haven’t fully completed the merger, compared to the two of you, I’m a small half-step faster. Otherwise, how would I dare to make such a demand?”

“Hmph, even if you are a little faster than us, so what? Having your bone and blood merge isn’t something that can be done in one go. Without profound primal chaos qi as a support, you will only ever take that half-step. It’s meaningless. All it takes is me and a few brothers to fight, and you will have to flee for your life. If you’re smart, you’ll hurry and scram,” sneered Shi Yang.

“What if I’m not smart? Then what?” Ji Wuming smiled lightly, seemingly completely indifferent.

“If you’re not smart, then the heavenly tomb will be your burial land!” shouted a large expert beside Shi Yang.

Suddenly, a light sound rang out. Blood spurted. That large expert’s head was pierced through, and his body slowly collapsed. He was dead.

“What?!”

Everyone was stunned. No one had even seen Ji Wuming move. How had he killed him?Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

It had to be known that this person was one of Shi Yang’s trusted generals with immense power. But he was silently killed.

When people looked back at Ji Wuming, they saw that he had a sparkling dagger in his hand. This dagger was now stained with black blood.

“An immemorial evil corpse’s head really is hard. However, a radish is a radish. It doesn’t matter how hard it gets. It still can’t stop itself from being cut.” Ji Wuming flicked his dagger, and the black blood instantly vanished. He looked at Shi Yang. “Now what? Am I qualified to demand a share now?”

“Courting death!”

Shi Yang roared furiously and spread his arms. Corpse qi exploded. He was about to attack when a woman’s cold voice rang out.

“Who do you think you are, Ji Wuming? Where do you think you’re going to run now?”

The Nine Underworld Luocha’s figure slowly walked into the tomb. She was also alone.

When she appeared, Ji Wuming instantly noticed the mark on her forehead. His calm expression finally changed as he narrowed his eyes.

“Asura mark.”
