Chapter 2725 The Terror of Demonic Pills

Dragonbone Evilmoon, its name already had the word Evil in it. In truth, it was truly a dark and sinister existence. Before Sovereign Yun Shang refined it into a weapon, it was unknown how many lifeforms it had killed.

Its life was focused on cultivation, and its cultivation was done through slaughter. The dark evil dragon race was an evil existence, and precisely due to that, they were also very sensitive to other things of similar nature.

Evilmoon had not brought up anything before about Long Chen refining and consuming demonic pills. However, this time, it had a bad feeling toward these demonic Heaven Merging Pills.

It had told him not to refine these demonic pills and instead use the Moon and Star Refining Furnace to refine the normal pill. Although the effect was a bit lacking, it was much steadier.

However, in the end, Long Chen was still using demonic pills with large, unknown side effects, so Evilmoon couldn’t help warning him one last time.

“I know. But I have no other choice.”

Long Chen shook his head. No one in this world had any choices any longer. In order to raise his cultivation base, Long Chen couldn’t bother with side effects. It was unknown how many geniuses were sacrificing their futures just to increase their cultivation bases as high as possible for the upcoming battle. Their futures were sacrificed, and he was no exception.

Hearing this, Evilmoon sighed and didn’t say anything else. Then Long Chen popped a demonic pill into his mouth.

At this moment, Long Chen sat lotus style in the air. His body rumbled as if terrifying experts were fighting.

The space around Long Chen began to explode, spreading large fluctuations that distorted the laws of heaven and earth. Zi Yan was shocked to see this and took out the Southern Sea Zither to prevent anyone from possibly disturbing him at this critical moment.

As Long Chen began digesting the power of the demonic pill, shadows that looked like tentacles appeared around him, connecting him to the void. Those dark shadows possessed a frightening evil energy. It was as if they were roots squirming into the heavens.

Zi Yan covered her mouth at the sight of those countless black tentacles. She had never seen Long Chen in such a state.

Suddenly, the Southern Sea Zither spoke to her, “A demonic pill possesses nefarious energy. It is something that exists outside laws. No one can say whether or not such power is good or bad, but one thing is certain: with this power, Long Chen’s cultivation speed will be astonishing. It’s just that…”

“Senior, what is it?” asked Zi Yan.

“It’s just that this world doesn’t have so many shortcuts. If you walk a shortcut, you might have to pay an immense price. However, none of you have any other paths to choose from. If you don’t rapidly advance, once the other worlds birth Sovereigns, the Martial Heaven Continent will be destroyed,” said the Southern Sea Zither.

BOOM!

Just at that moment, a terrifying aura exploded. Zi Yan jumped, and a wave of divine light came from the Southern Sea Zither, wrapping around her. However, a huge force blasted this defense apart, sending her flying.

“So fast?” In just a short moment, with just three pills, Long Chen had advanced to the second Heavenstage?

“Long Chen is using the quickest, most violent way of advancing. This will waste a bit of the medicinal energy and force his body through a backlash. Most likely, only someone with a powerful physical body like him would be capable of doing such a thing. Someone else’s body would have exploded,” said the Southern Sea Zither, its divine light seemingly seeing through Long Chen.

“It’s for me. Otherwise, he wouldn’t be in such a rush.” Zi Yan suddenly felt uneasy. She didn’t know if this would affect Long Chen’s future. If a problem occurred in his future because of such rapid advancement, she would feel guilty for a lifetime.

“Zi Yan, I have a question for you. If Long Chen suddenly tricks you, what will you do?” asked the Southern Sea Zither out of nowhere.

“Trick me? Why would he do that? He doesn’t do that,” said Zi Yan.

“I’m asking you if he tricks you, will you hate him? Will you kill him?”

“Senior, why would you suddenly ask me such a thing?” asked Zi Yan.

“First answer my question,” said the Southern Sea Zither sternly.

“If he has to trick me, then fine. He is my life’s fated devil star. I chose him. That means that I’ve abandoned all defenses toward him; I’ve entrusted my life to him. No matter what he does to me, I won’t hate him. Even if he raises his blade and kills me, I won’t hate him. I will believe in him with my full heart,” said Zi Yan.

At this moment, more and more black tentacles were stretching out of Long Chen’s back and reaching into the heavens. Long Chen seemed like a devil king absorbing the energy of the world.

However, his expression was still calm. That determined face gave her a sense of safety, as if even if the heavens collapsed, Long Chen would hold them up. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

“Love is a double-sided mirror. You both invest in each other and gain from each other. You love him deeply, and he loves you deeply. I’m at ease like this,” said the Southern Sea Zither, seemingly talking to itself but also giving vague directions.

BOOM!

Before Zi Yan could reply, another explosion rocked this land. At this moment, Long Chen’s aura explosively rose to the third Heavenstage. It had been less than an incense stick’s worth of time.

The tentacles shuddered, tearing through the void, slicing apart the laws of the Heavenly Daos. At the same time, an ear-piercing screech rang out.

“Why is Long Chen’s cultivation art so different from everyone else’s? Does he cultivate entirely based on medicinal pills? Does he have to merge with the Heavenly Daos?” exclaimed Zi Yan.

The Southern Sea Zither said, “The energy inside his body is rejected by the Heavenly Daos, and there’s no way to mix them. This cultivation technique does not belong to the Martial Heaven Continent. He was previously able to absorb the energy of the Heavenly Daos, but now his power is too great, resulting in a fierce expulsion between the two. Long Chen’s power cannot suppress the laws of the Martial Heaven Continent, and the laws of the Martial Heaven Continent are unable to suppress him either. Long Chen’s cultivation technique automatically resists them. As his realm increases, the rejection grows as well, so the resulting phenomenon also grows more terrifying.”

Just as it said, as Long Chen continued consuming medicinal pills, the spatial fluctuations erupting around him grew more intense.

After two hours, another explosion rocked the land, and the laws began to explode. Long Chen advanced to the fourth Heavenstage.

Upon reaching the fourth Heavenstage, he finished eating this batch of medicinal pills and began to eat giant pills.

When the first giant pill entered his stomach, the black tentacles sharply increased. They looked like a fiend brandishing its limbs, attempting to escape some kind of binding. That sight made Zi Yan’s heart shudder.

The only thing that comforted her was that no matter how frightening the phenomenon Long Chen was causing, his expression was completely unperturbed.

Finally, after three days, Long Chen’s aura exploded, causing the stars to shake. He had advanced all the way to the seventh Heavenstage of Heaven Merging.

After that, Long Chen slowly opened his eyes. He spat out a mouthful of turbid air and then suddenly punched the air.
