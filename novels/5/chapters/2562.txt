Chapter 2551 Enemies Arrive, World Gate Opens!

A group of armored experts walked off of the chariot. There were still some bloodstains on their armor, and dense killing intent soared out of them. It seemed that they had just come from a battlefield.

Those warriors were escorting a large man with long facial hair. He was extremely tall, like a small giant.

It was like he was a monster in human form. A strong scent of blood came from him, and he had a giant hatchet on his back. As he walked across the void, the void shuddered.

“Looks like I came in time. Let me see just how many heads that brat who conned me back then has. I wonder if there’s enough for me to cut them all down,” snorted the large man.

He wasn’t intentionally speaking loudly, but every one of his words exploded through the air like thunder.

“Another Sovereign sprout.”

Every expert stared in shock. The divine families actually had three more Sovereign sprouts other than Feng Fei.Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

“Feng Fei is from the Jiang family, while this guy is also surnamed Jiang. Did the Jiang family produce two Sovereign sprouts?”

“I hear the divine families are the Jiang, Long, Ye, and Zhao families. The Zhao family also has a Sovereign sprout named Zhao Ritian. It’s said that he controls metal energy and possesses an undying body. I wonder if he’ll come as well,” said someone with a certain understanding of the divine families.

The Martial Heaven Continent’s side was still unaware that Zhao Ritian had secretly entered the Star Field Divine World as well. He had already been toyed with by Guo Ran.

Jiang Wuchen came in so ferociously with blood still staining his body. However, the words between the three of them puzzled everyone.

They kept mentioning how Long Chen had made them suffer. But how was that possible? The divine families were supreme existences. They essentially ignored the matters of the Martial Heaven Continent.

The Sovereign sprouts in particular were special existences amongst the divine families. They were geniuses amongst geniuses. How had they ended up interacting with Long Chen?

Everyone stared at each other. They could only conclude that Long Chen was truly a monster. He had made all these Sovereign sprouts suffer.

Even Qu Jianying, the old man, and the others were dumbfounded. They had never heard Long Chen mention this matter before. Did he actually have such illustrious combat achievements?

“Jiang Wuchen, the four of us were conned by that brat back then. Now we can finally get our revenge. But it seems that someone wants to shamelessly accept that dog and is willing to go against us because of it. What do you think about that?” Ye Liangchen asked Jiang Wuchen.

Jiang Wuchen then looked at Long Aotian. “Long Aotian, I have no enmity with you. Our relationship can be considered decent, but I can’t give you face over this matter. He humiliated us and must pay the price. I can let him off alive, but he must kowtow three times. Then I can spare his life.”

“Do you know what the Lord Venerate wants?” said Long Aotian coldly.

“Don’t try to use the Lord Venerate to suppress us. I came from Resentful Death City straight here. No one gave me any information about that, nor do I need any. Today, I’m going to make that arrogant fellow pay the price for his arrogance back then,” said Jiang Wuchen.

The three Sovereign sprouts stood in the sky, facing each other in a triangle formation. All three of them had brought tens of thousands of subordinates. They were staring coldly at each other. The atmosphere grew increasingly tense.

“Hahaha, this time, Long Chen’s definitely dead. No one can protect him. Alliance head Qu, all your plans are going to come to an end.” The head of the ancient family alliance, Di Long, smiled sinisterly, intentionally provoking Qu Jianying.

“If the Martial Heaven Alliance doesn’t have Long Chen, it will immediately scatter like smoke in the wind. As for the Righteous path? Hmph, sooner or later they’re going to be ruled by the Corrupt path,” said Xie Wentian with a cruel light in his eyes.

Long Chen had been a thorn in the Corrupt path’s side. Ever since his rise, he had dealt countless setbacks to the Corrupt path. He was like their bane, causing them to lose endless face.

“Don’t get excited too early.” Suddenly, the crowned elder of the sea demon race spoke up. “The Zhao family’s Sovereign sprout entered the Star Field Divine World with Feng Fei, while my race’s young prince has awakened the Sea God’s weapon. Since both parties hate Long Chen, he might not even come out of the Star Field Divine World alive. Moreover, Xie Wentian, you were pretty sinister. You actually sent the seventh generation Corrupt God’s reincarnation in without exposing the slightest clue. Isn’t that to act like a pig to devour the tiger? You’re the one who's most clear on whether or not Long Chen will be coming out alive, am I right? Why are you acting so fake now?”

“The seventh generation Corrupt God’s reincarnation?!”

The Righteous path’s experts jumped. They suddenly thought of a mysterious person that had been by Tian Xiezi’s side.

Xie Wentian twitched. He snorted, “The sea demon race’s mouths are quite big.”

Xie Wentian was startled to find that this secret had been leaked. According to what he knew, only the divine families should possibly be aware of it.

However, this person had still exposed it. That meant that they had to have a collaboration with the divine families, and the divine families had leaked this secret to them.

As for saying his mouth was big, he was mocking him for not knowing how to keep secrets. To put it frankly, he was calling him an idiot.

Qu Jianying’s face turned pale. This Star Field Divine World was clearly a trap then. If so many people were targeting Long Chen, he must have faced many tribulations.

“Don’t worry. So what if they’re Sovereign sprouts? So what if he’s a reincarnation of a Corrupt God? Long Chen definitely isn’t inferior to any of them,” comforted the old man.

Even though that was what he said, the old man was also nervous. This time, the enemies were truly terrifying.

“Fuck, why hasn’t the Heaven Splitting Divine Tablet come back? With it, I could slaughter these bastards.” The old man eyed these fellows furiously.

“You don’t need to worry. Long Chen will be fine. I trust him,” said Daoist Heavenly Feather suddenly.

Although Daoist Heavenly Feather had always stood in the neutral position, she always maintained a certain care for the Martial Heaven Alliance.

“Are you not afraid that you’ve made a misjudgment?” Suddenly, an indifferent voice rang out.

Startled at this rudeness to Daoist Heavenly Feather, everyone looked over to see that the speaker was the head of the Dongfang family.

The Dongfang, Ximen, Nangong, and Beitang families were already here. While the first two were in their own isolated areas, the Beitang and Nangong families were banded together. Due to Nangong Zuiyue and Beitang Rushuang, the two families had ended up particularly close.

For the Dongfang family head to suddenly speak here, the other three family heads were all startled. Their impression of the Dongfang family head was that he was always cautious and crafty. Why would he suddenly target Daoist Heavenly Feather? Did he take the wrong medicine this morning?

“You dare to question Daoist Heavenly Feather?”

“When Daoist Heavenly Feather swept through the continent, your great-granddaddy was still playing in the mud.”

“Daoist Heavenly Feather is the leader of the entire cultivation world. Are you trying to challenge her?”

Quite a few people began to curse at the Dongfang family head. Daoist Heavenly Feather was revered by countless people, and she was viewed as practically a history book. Her knowledge could not be questioned. Hence, many people amongst the neutral faction glared at him.

“Haha, it doesn’t seem that I said anything wrong. Is it wrong to question such a statement?” The Dongfang family head smiled indifferently.

Just as everyone was going to continue cursing him, Daoist Heavenly Feather said, “To tell the truth, everyone says that an old person’s vision will grow blurry. It truly is easy to make misjudgments. But despite that, I can say that my eyes can still see very clearly. For example… I can see the Heaven-Seizer of your family that takes other people’s inheritances.”

“What?!”

Everyone was shocked by this. A Heaven-Seizer? Wasn’t that an existence that was not permitted on the Martial Heaven Continent? If anyone dared to raise a Heaven-Seizer, they would immediately be wiped out by the rest of the powers of the continent.

The Dongfang family was raising a Heaven-Seizer? Could it be… Everyone immediately thought of Dongfang Yuyang.

“What nonsense are you spouting?! Don’t think that just because of your seniority you can slander others!” The Dongfang family head’s expression changed, and he pointed and shouted at Daoist Heavenly Feather.

His heart was pounding wildly. Despite him trying to calm down, the gaze of countless experts applied immense psychological pressure on him. He began to panic.

“Why are you so nervous? If you are afraid of this secret being exposed, you should have kept quiet and not targeted me. Even though I’ve spoken now, I have no proof. Furthermore, you have the support of the divine families. What are you afraid of?” Daoist Heavenly Feather shook her head.

“This is slander!” raged the Dongfang family head.

“If you say it’s slander, then it’s slander. Everyone, you can just treat it as a joke,” said Daoist Heavenly Feather.

Treat it as a joke? No one was capable of that. Heaven-Seizers were a nightmare to deal with. They should not exist in this world.

With Daoist Heavenly Feather’s status, how could she possibly make such a joke? Everyone stared at the Dongfang family head vigilantly.

“The Dongfang family is under the protection of the Ye family. What, do you not like it?” The words on their side had ended up disturbing the three Sovereign sprouts. Ye Liangchen then turned to glare at Daoist Heavenly Feather arrogantly.

“How could I not like it? The future belongs to you youngsters. An old woman like me has no choice but to accept it,” said Daoist Heavenly Feather with a light smile. Although she didn’t show the slightest displeasure, countless people were infuriated on her behalf.

Suddenly, the spatial door began to shudder. As it slowly opened, balls of light appeared. It was possible to see figures within those balls of light.

“They’ve come out!”

Everyone immediately tensed and stopped breathing, staring intently at those balls of light.
