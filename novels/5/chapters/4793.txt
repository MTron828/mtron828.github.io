Chapter 4782 Mortal Dao

“How can this be? He can escape the spiritual lock of an Earth Saint and the senses of a top Saint weapon?!” This time, even the Heaven Overseer was filled with disbelief.

Some might say that Long Chen’s slap in the Earth Saint’s face was just a fluke, or more accurately the Earth Saint had underestimated Long Chen and was careless.

However, in this scenario, the Earth Saint was fully prepared for combat and had activated a Saint weapon. In such a state, he didn’t even need to intentionally defend. The moment Long Chen got close, both the Earth Saint and his Saint weapon would instantly sense him and react.

In this world, people might be able to trick the senses of other experts but not divine weapons. After all, divine weapons had no feelings, no way to be befuddled. They would instantly grasp any movements containing hostility or killing intent. This was an iron law, a law that had never changed. However, it was broken today by Long Chen.

When Long Chen slapped the Earth Saint in the face, not only did the Earth Saint not sense him, but even his divine weapon didn’t do anything to block or attack. This strange scene toppled the understanding of countless experts.

The stronger the person, the more shocked they were by Long Chen’s attack. After all, this was an attack that destroyed common sense, leaving everyone dazed.

Just as the Earth Saint was tumbling back, Long Chen remained in his slapping position and spat out two words.

“First move.”

One slap counted as one move? That was practically the biggest insult for the Celestial race’s Earth Saint. When he finally stabilized himself, half of his face was a bloody pulp. He clenched his teeth so hard that they almost shattered, and flames almost burst out of his eyes.

“DIE!”

This time, he learned his lesson, no longer being so chatty. Tens of thousands of sword-images unfurled through the sky before suddenly merging into one ultimate sword.

Seeing this scene, Long Chen finally raised Evilmoon. As he grasped it firmly with both hands, blood-colored light flowed across his scales. Behind him, the colossal dragon manifestation swirled, while Blood Qi surged within him. Long Chen felt as though molten lava coursed through his veins, his dragon blood greedily absorbing the world’s aura.

“Six Forms in One!” With a resolute cry, Long Chen unleashed the same attack as before. However, this time, his manifestation suddenly froze. Even his divine ring stopped spinning, and the black qi swirling around Evilmoon congealed.

BOOM!

In front of the all-out attack of an Earth Saint, Long Chen chose to fight head-on. These two divine weapons once more clashed, sending shockwaves rippling through the land. A sharp pang surged through Long Chen’s palm, followed by a sensation akin to a boulder slamming into his gut.

Sent hurtling through the air, Long Chen wasn’t alone in his plight. The Earth Saint fared no better.

The two of them coughed up blood at almost the same time. However, to everyone’s astonishment, their divine weapons continued to remain locked in battle, as if glued together.

Wiping the blood off of his mouth, the Earth Saint roared, “Devour that black saber’s item-spirit to avenge your master!” At the same time, he shot toward Long Chen like a divine bird.

“Evilmoon!” Long Chen was shocked.

“Don’t worry about me. Who would refuse to eat food that sends itself to your door? Don’t forget how I obtained this body of mine,” snickered Evilmoon.

Long Chen instantly understood. Evilmoon had let itself be stuck to the sword.

After all, to gain control over its body, Evilmoon had devoured countless dragon souls. When it came to devouring, it was the king.

“Let’s see how many blows you can last against me without a weapon!” the Earth Saint sneered and slammed his palm down. The next moment, the void twisted, and countless Heavenly Dao runes swirled into a giant claw that covered all the space around Long Chen.

“Mortal Dao, One Hand Covering the Heavens!”

The hand crashed down like a heaven-encompassing net or a hand clenching people’s souls, striking people in the weakest part of their hearts.

The observing experts felt their souls shudder. Even though they weren’t the main target, they couldn’t stand against this power. For them, in front of an Earth Saint, surrender was the best ending. Resistance would only make their lives painful without changing anything. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

When a Sage King saw his disciples cowering in fear, he scolded, “Use your heart to sense it! Above Sage Kings are the Heaven, Earth, and Mortal Saints! They control Heaven Dao, Earth Dao, and Mortal Dao. The Mortal Dao attacks the seven emotions and six desires. If your will is not strong enough, you won’t even be able to think about resisting. You can only allow them to slaughter or enslave you. The pressure that Long Chen is under is a million times greater! If you can’t even handle this little bit, how will you face the challenges in the future?!”

Countless Sage Kings were urging their disciples to stop retreating, stand tall to face this pressure, and use this chance to temper their wills.

BOOM!

Just then, a dragon claw stretched out of Long Chen’s divine ring and slammed into the enormous hand, crushing it into bits.

“He isn’t affected by the Mortal Dao?”

Seeing the hand destroyed, startled cries rang out. The Mortal Dao was a mental attack that affected every expert. Some people would be so badly affected that they would rather die than resist.

The Mortal Dao was something only Mortal Saints could control. It was a special kind of Heavenly Dao energy, derived from their trials during that tribulation. Utilizing it was akin to harnessing the force of heavenly tribulation against enemies. All people had emotions and desires that would affect them, but Long Chen appeared impervious to such influences.

“That’s the third move.”

As the dragon claw destroyed the hand, Long Chen continued to count the number of moves.

“Bastard, don’t get too arrogant! I refuse to believe that you have no weaknesses! Mortal Dao, Soul Peering Mirror!” roared the Earth Saint.

A giant mirror appeared before Long Chen. When it emerged, Long Chen didn’t react, but countless experts screamed in terror.

When they looked in the mirror, they saw countless terrifying sights, such as bloody beasts, ferocious devils, and ghouls wielding blades. Some disciples directly shut their eyes.

“Open your eyes! That mirror reveals what you fear the most! You must face them!” shouted some Sage Kings. This was a rare chance for them to temper themselves, and they shouldn’t miss it.

This was a Soul Peering Mirror, condensed by an Earth Saint—a rarity among factions, as not all possessed such formidable forces. For some smaller factions, they only had a single Earth Saint. Hence, it would be far too much of a loss for them to not take advantage of this chance.

While Long Chen showed no fear toward the mirror, he did become sluggish. Just then, startled cries rang out as the Earth Saint appeared behind Long Chen like a phantom, his claw aiming for Long Chen’s heart.

Long Chen seemed like he was trapped in a nightmare. His eyes were lifeless, and he wasn’t moving.

Just as everyone thought that Long Chen was about to die, Long Chen didn’t bat an eye. Without so much as a flinch or a glance backward, his hand swung behind him, delivering a resounding slap to the Earth Saint's face once again.
