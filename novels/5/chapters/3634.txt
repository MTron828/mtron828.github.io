Chapter 3623

BOOM!

Suddenly, the jade in Guo Ran’s hand exploded. The image vanished, but Alldevil Tianye’s merciless devil eyes that were full of killing intent were deeply imprinted in people’s minds now. All of them were pale as paper. It was like they had just walked past the gates of hell.

“How terrifying…”

Their hearts were filled with fear. After all, that Alldevil Tianye’s gaze was absolutely terrifying. They couldn’t even form a will to resist it.

“Just who is this person?! He’s a monster!” Leng Hui was just as terrified. He had never seen such an existence before. With a single gaze, he could make their will crumble.

“Using mental energy to gaze back at us. This person really is terrifying.” Having exchanged a glance with that person through space, Long Chen’s heart shook.

“We must hurry back to the Heavenly Dragon Domain. The real battle is about to erupt.”

When the battleship reached a secret transportation node, they directly returned to the college. As for that transportation formation, it was destroyed after one use. Their enemies wouldn’t be able to follow them.

When Long Chen and the others returned to the Heavenly Dragon Divine Armor College, Xue Yifan and the other elders were waiting for them.

“We’re abandoning the Heavenly Dragon Domain. All of our resources are to be moved to the Magnificent Heaven Domain. Bring everything that you can.” Long Chen directly gave this order after returning.

“What?!”

“That’s not possible!”

“You want us to abandon everything we’ve had for so many years? It’s unacceptable!”

Everyone was stunned by these orders, especially the college’s senior experts. They firmly opposed this.

“We’d rather die here than leave!” declared one elder furiously.

“Up to you. If you want to die, then stay here. Leave your corpses for the Alldevil race to enjoy. If you want to live, do as I say. Our time is very pressing. Every second that passes can decide life or death. I can’t be bothered to explain things to a bunch of fools,” said Long Chen coldly.

Countless people admired Long Chen now. But to have these old fellows abandon the college was even worse than killing them.

“When it comes to the three major domains, the Magnificent Heaven Domain possesses the greatest defensive power. The nine dragon veins underground support it, making it the most suitable for a long-term battle. We’ve all seen the recording. The Allldevil race raised the Luo clan to use them against us while they were gathering their power. While the human race exhausted itself fighting each other, they raised their elites, so the power disparity in this battle is immense. We must know how to sacrifice. I agree with Long Chen’s order,” said a half-step Divine Venerate.

“Of course you agree! You’re not the one abandoning your sect, your home! You don’t care!” roared an elder of the Heavenly Dragon Divine Armor College. His face was already streaked with tears.

The half-step Divine Venerate furiously retorted, “Bullshit, this is called taking a look at the big picture, understood?! Do we even have any leeway to choose in our current state? It’s not just your home! So many people have been forced to abandon their homes just to squeeze into our three domains. Trillions of people have lost their homeland! Did you say anything when they lost their homes? As long as we win this war, we can rebuild our homes. If we lose our lives, who will look after those homes?!”

The half-step Divine Venerate’s roars caused countless people to fall silent. The Heavenly Dragon Divine Armor College’s disciples looked at the buildings around them; their eyes moistened. As for the elders, they were sobbing.

They also knew that protecting lives was the most important thing. As long as they were still alive, they could still rebuild everything. But they were unwilling to leave this place. Abandoning the college was a kind of humiliation.

“We will act according to Long Chen’s orders. All people within the Heavenly Dragon Domain must leave. The Heavenly Dragon Divine Armor College will be the first to mobilize,” shouted Xue Yifan.

However, when people looked at Xue Yifan, they found that he had lost his normal calm. He looked as if he had aged a great deal all of a sudden. As the dean, the college was his life. He probably felt the worst out of everyone to give this order. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

With even the dean giving the order, the others finally stopped resisting. Lowering their heads, they got to work on moving with tear-stained faces.

“I’m sorry, dean.” Long Chen looked at Xue Yifan. This wise elder that always appeared as if everything was under his control was finally showing his pain and helplessness.

Xue Yifan shook his head and forced out a smile. “A man can plan as much as he wishes, but he cannot outplan the heavens. I, Xue Yifan, spent half a lifetime planning. I thought that everything was under control, but now I find that it’s a huge joke. If it weren’t for you coming, the Alldevil Star-Field would be doomed. The Alldevil race was always a brainless existence. But the more brainless an existence is, the more unpredictable it is. My plan was to raise Guo Ran into a hero over several years, and he would lead the human race in a counterattack. But the Alldevil race won’t give us that chance. I even said that you came too early, saying that you caused my plan to fail. Thinking back, I really am foolish.”

Xue Yifan had spent a lifetime planning and scheming. He rarely made any mistakes. But this time, his meticulous plans were completely meaningless.

He knew that the Alldevil race wasn’t really planning on using the Luo clan to subdue the human race. They only intended on using the Luo clan to cause some trouble for the human race before wiping them all out.

However, unexpectedly, the Alldevil race’s movements were incredibly quick. They had all seen Alldevil Tianye, so Xue Yifan knew that Alldevil Tianye was not drawn over. No, he directly came to kill.

In other words, the battle between the Luo clan and the human race meant nothing to him. Alldevil Tianye had come to kill the human race and had not appeared at that time due to some plan. They had only run into each other due to coincidence.

The Alldevil race had simple brains, so they didn’t know what planning was. They would simply fight if they were strong enough and recover if they were wounded. Once they recovered, they would fight again.

Back then when the Luo clan surrendered to the Alldevil race, it would be more accurate to say that the Luo clan had taken the initiative to find the Alldevil race. They offered advice to the Alldevil race.

The Luo clan promised the Alldevil race that they would subdue the human race without the Alldevil race needing to lose a single soldier. They then had the Alldevil race form a contract with them guaranteeing that the Alldevil race wouldn’t kill them once they won.

However, neither the Luo clan nor Xue Yifan had thought that huge changes would occur within the Alldevil race during this time. The Alldevil race actually had tens of thousands of branches, and their interior was also a fight for authority and position.

This Alldevil Tianye was a powerful expert with an immense background. He directly declared himself overlord of the Alldevil Star-Field when he took over. He then ordered the attack on the human race without caring about the Luo clan.

It just so happened that he had come as Long Chen and the others attacked Hongying City. If Long Chen and the others had left one step slower, the consequences would have been unimaginable. Just thinking about it made Xue Yifan sweat and feel a burst of fear.

Under the dean’s orders, the Heavenly Dragon Domain’s experts rapidly moved, and the Celestial Essence Sect also started moving. All their resources were gathered in the Magnificent Heaven Domain.

“Calculating the time, the enemy army should take seven days to reach this place if they’re fast and ten days if they’re slow. We have to hurry. Leave that Alldevil Tianye to me. As for the others, it will be up to you.”

Long Chen stood at the peak of Magnificent Heaven City. He looked into the distance, his blood starting to heat up.
