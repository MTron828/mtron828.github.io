Chapter 5021 Sore Loser

The explosive collision forced Zhao Qingtian back along with Long Wuyang. Although Long Wuyang was knocked back, the spectators still cheered for him.

At this moment, Zhao Qingtian held a golden glaive. After the first exchange, he no longer dared to look down on Long Wuyang.

Unexpectedly, Long Wuyang was powerful enough to knock Zhao Qingtian back a few steps. Startled and enraged, Zhao Qingtian felt humiliated, especially by the cheers mocking him.

“Well done! Long Wuyang has guts and wits! Perhaps he can last three moves,” Qin Feng said, clapping from the spectator stands.

“What do you mean?” Long Ziwei and Gui Jiu asked, confused.

Just now, Long Wuyang had unleashed his full power and was unable to shake Zhao Qingtian. But with his second attack, he forced Zhao Qingtian to take out his weapon and knocked him back. Long Ziwei and Gui Jiu didn’t understand the difference between the two exchanges.

“With his first attack, Long Wuyang absorbed quite a bit of Zhao Qingtian’s power. With his second attack, he unleashed that power back along with his own. Hence, Zhao Qingtian was struck by his own power and his opponent’s, which is why he was knocked back. Quick, look!” urged Qin Feng.

Just then, Long Wuyang was blown back all the way to the martial stage’s barrier. He smashed into it, causing it to bend and send him flying back, his speed instantly reaching a peak.

“What?!”

Even Long Qianxue and the others were startled by this. Long Wuyang was truly skilled. With the second attack, he managed to absorb his opponent’s energy. He then borrowed the barrier’s power to propel himself back, combining his own power, his opponent’s, and the barrier’s.

Long Wuyang moved with incredible speed, giving Zhao Qingtian no chance to react. His staff smashed toward Zhao Qingtian with the greatest power of his life. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Zhao Qingtian hadn’t expected his opponent to make such a move. In the second exchange, he was caught off-guard, and using his own power against Long Wuyang caused his energy to become disorder. He had barely settled when the third attack came, leaving him no time to breathe or adjust.

“Thousand Earth Gates!” Zhao Qingtian shouted as one giant gate after another appeared, dozens in total.

However, Long Wuyang was too fast. He blasted through them instantly, and his staff clashed with Zhao Qingtian’s glaive.

BOOM!

A giant hole appeared in the martial stage because of the collision, and both Long Wuyang and Zhao Qingtian spat out blood. Zhao Qingtian was sent flying, smashing into the barrier.

Seeing Zhao Qingtian injured, countless people cried out, but there were even more cheers. Long Wuyang had managed to injure his opponent, a heavenly genius from the ancient era. Even if he ultimately lost, this was still a great feat.

BOOM!

Suddenly, the martial stage quivered, and a giant Heavenly Fate Disk came into view, so enormous that it covered the entire stage. A sharp light then sliced toward Long Wuyang.

Seeing the attack, Long Wuyang hastily blocked. However, with an explosive sound, his coiled dragon staff shattered, and the attack sliced into his chest, cutting it open. If not for the staff blocking it, the attack would have torn him to shreds.

“Die!”

Zhao Qingtian seemed to have gone crazy. He thrust his glaive toward Long Wuyang’s head, clearly intending to kill him. Seeing his enraged expression, the Long clan’s experts cried out in alarm. If not for the barrier on the martial stage, they would have charged forward to save Long Wuyang.

Zhao Qingtian’s glaive energy pierced through the martial stage, but Long Wuyang was gone. People looked around and saw Long Chen holding his golden scepter at the border of the martial stage, with Long Wuyang lying beside him.

“He...”

Long Chen’s swift movements shocked Long Qianxue and the others. It was so fast that they couldn’t see him clearly. His movement art was practically like that of a ghost.

Long Chen sneered at the crazed Zhao Qingtian. “I looked down on you before, but I look down on you even more now. Had you not brazenly said that it would be your loss if he lasted three moves? Now, you were injured in three moves. If you refused to accept this, that would be one thing. But to want to kill your opponent after your boastful claim? I really don’t understand. Are all ancient era’s people so shameless, or is it just you?”

“You...!”

Zhao Qingtian was enraged. This was like consecutive slaps in the face. He had said some big words at the start and had no way to take them back now.

“Although I look down on you, I admire one thing about you: how do you manage to eat your own shit without shame? The color of your face doesn’t even change!” remarked Long Chen mockingly.

Zhao Qingtian almost choked. The spectators also felt like Zhao Qingtian had gone too far and lost the style of an expert. Hence, Long Chen’s ridicule was very satisfying for them.

Beside Long Chen, Long Wuyang crawled up and cupped his fists to him. He said, “Thank you for saving me. However, a loss is a loss. Brother Qingtian’s power far surpasses my own. I also have to thank Brother Qingtian for showing me what a real expert is, and what the difference is between us. I will work hard on my cultivation in the future.”

Long Wuyang crushed his tablet and was transported out. When he admitted defeat, he received a round of applause and cheers. The Long clan’s disciples in particular were very proud of him.

On the other hand, the victor, Zhao Qingtian, was holding back a belly of fire with nowhere to release it. He glared at Long Chen.

“Just you wait,” Zhao Qingtian spat out, giving Long Chen no chance to reply before storming off.

“Idiot,” muttered Long Chen, ignoring him. He then waved his scepter and entered the next martial stage.

When this martial stage was activated, it revealed Jiang Wuwang facing off against an expert from the Ye clan. Jiang Wuwang nodded toward Long Chen upon seeing him, then cupped his fists slightly toward his opponent, signaling for his opponent to make the first move.

Jiang Wuwang’s moves adhered to societal norms, but he received applause due to the stark contrast between him and Zhao Qingtian. In that contrast, Jiang Wuwang seemed much more elegant.

Jiang Wuwang’s opponent attacked ten times, while Jiang Wuwang remained on defense the entire time, never counterattacking. After unleashing all his abilities, his opponent realized he couldn’t win and finally admitted defeat.

The third bout featured Ye Lingxiao, who directly stabbed his opponent through the chest with his sword at the start, giving his opponent no chance to respond.

When the fourth martial stage activated, Long Tianrui’s fairy-like figure appeared before everyone and received a burst of cheers. Long Tianrui was a woman countless men dreamed of, and they felt an innate worshipful feeling for her from the depths of their souls.

When Long Tianrui opened her eyes, she didn’t look at her opponent but at Long Chen. Just as she opened her mouth, Long Chen quickly interjected, “Don’t spout nonsense! Let the battle commence!”
