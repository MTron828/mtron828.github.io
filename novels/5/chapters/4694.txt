Chapter 4683 Gamble

Countless spectral lifeforms in ancient robes came charging out, unleashing their wrath upon the nearest experts.

“AH!”

A scream ripped through the air as an expert blew an ancient lifeform apart with a punch. But the next moment, the power of time erupted in him. His fist instantly decayed, and the decay rapidly spread.

With grim resolve, he made a swift decision, tearing his own arm from his body to halt the relentless decay’s advance.

After this lesson, the other experts didn’t dare to fight these ancient lifeforms head-on, using only magical arts and divine abilities to keep them back. Fortunately, these lifeforms weren’t as terrifying as the Warrior of the Starry Sky, so these experts could still handle them.

However, even more of them emerged from the Ghost Ships. Now, the experts in the tribulation were like fish struggling inside of a net, appearing completely powerless.

BOOM!

The whale spine swept through the air, blowing hundreds of Ghost Ships apart. In front of the Warrior of the Starry Sky, these Ghost Ships were as flimsy as paper.

Long Chen continued to dodge through the crowd and crushed these ancient lifeforms. Strangely, their power of time didn’t affect him.

Thankfully, Lei Linger had been supporting him the whole time. Her millions of split bodies were hidden within the tribulation, constantly absorbing thunderforce. Moreover, she offered Long Chen vital resistance against the encroaching power of time.

The greatest threat to Long Chen was still the Warrior of the Starry Sky. Wielding power above what the heavenly tribulation should have, the Warrior of the Starry Sky had specifically come to annihilate Long Chen. In the end, Long Chen could only bide his time, gradually wearing down the Warrior's formidable energy reserves.

Indeed, the power of the heavenly tribulation had its limits. As time wore on, the Warrior of the Starry Sky would inevitably weaken. Thus, time became Long Chen's most precious asset, his only hope for overcoming this ordeal.

“Don’t come over here!” A heavenly genius screamed in terror upon seeing Long Chen flying toward him. His soul almost fled in terror.

BOOM!

As the whale spine fell, Long Chen narrowly evaded its deadly trajectory, but the same could not be said for the unfortunate heavenly genius. Not even a trace of his Yuan Spirit survived.

“Long Chen, you goddamn bastard! When this tribulation is over, I will kill everyone you care about right in front of you!” roared another heavenly genius in fury.

Hearing him asking for it, Long Chen appeared right in front of him.

The whale spine abruptly withdrew before thrusting through the world like a spear, extinguishing the life of the heavenly genius in an instant.

Long Chen coughed up blood this time. Despite successfully manipulating the calamity to his advantage, he was wounded by the shockwaves unleashed by the whale spine.

Long Chen couldn’t help but feel shocked. Just how powerful was this Warrior of the Starry Sky? Even after attacking so many times with such power, the Warrior of the Starry Sky still stood strong, his aura not dwindling in the slightest.

Long Chen seethed with frustration as he realized the heavens were breaking all the rules just to kill him.

However, amidst the chaos, there was one thing that comforted him: the sight of countless dragon runes on the Warrior of the Starry Sky.

Lei Linger had stuck tens of thousands of her split bodies onto the Warrior of the Starry Sky to absorb his power. However, his power was so concentrated that extracting it proved challenging for Lei Linger. She could only absorb it gradually, bit by bit.

As more Ghost Ships disintegrated, unleashing the ancient lifeforms, Long Chen weaved through the chaos, dodging left and right. The relentless onslaught of the Warrior of the Starry Sky left nothing but annihilation in its wake, blasting those ancient lifeforms apart like rotting wood.

Among the heavenly geniuses enduring the tribulation, only a scant hundred remained, scattered and desperate for survival. They immediately fled whenever they saw Long Chen moving toward them.

With his calamity-drawing technique no longer being so effective, Long Chen chose to stop. These people were not idiots. If he gave them a chance, they would temporarily bind him for an instant, and the Warrior of the Starry Sky would instantly kill him.

“Dragonbone Evilmoon, get your ass out here! I’m going to die like this!” Long Chen cursed inside. Without Evilmoon, he wouldn’t be able to beat the Warrior of the Starry Sky.

After all, Lei Linger still wasn’t strong enough to control the Warrior of the Starry Sky. If this continued, one slight mistake would instantly lead to his death.

From outside of the tribulation, the Dragonblood Legion was also nervous. As they had finished their tribulations, they couldn’t help Long Chen now. If they were to charge in, the power of the tribulation would instantly kill them.

Furthermore, it wasn’t as if the Dragonblood Legion had it easy. Countless peak geniuses had died in the tribulation, and their subordinates blamed their deaths on Long Chen.

Unable to do anything to Long Chen, they could only unleash their fury on the Dragonblood Legion. Like maimed beasts, they attacked Xia Chen and the others ferociously.

The Dragonblood Legion’s battlefield was now littered with corpses, with small mountains forming beneath their feet. Lost in the heat of the battle, they themselves didn’t know just how many enemies they had killed.

Against the endless tide of experts, they could only respond with merciless slaughter. Even though they were severely outnumbered by the millions, the Dragonblood warriors stood their ground.

“This won’t do. I have to counterattack.”

Long Chen repeatedly dodged, but the Warrior of the Starry Sky’s attacks were growing increasingly ferocious. He wouldn’t be able to last much longer like this. Seeing that Dragonbone Evilmoon still wasn’t back, he couldn’t wait any longer.

“Cloud Dragon Immolation Claw!” Long Chen shouted, and an immense dragon claw shot out from the dragon figure behind him. Following that, a blood-colored dragon tail swept through the air.

“Divine Dragon Tail Pendulum!”

The next moment, many small stars enveloped Long Chen, and his fists shimmered with celestial radiance. Long Chen was preparing a big move as the whale spine pierced through his dragon claw and dragon tail, looking like a viper pouncing toward his chest.

“This is my gamble!” 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

Long Chen gritted his teeth and suddenly slammed his hands together.

Blood erupted as the whale spine drove into Long Chen’s chest, but despite the ferocity of the attack, Long Chen’s hands clamped firmly around the spine, halting its advance.

After going through the Cloud Dragon Immolation Claw and Divine Dragon Tail Pendulum, the spine’s power had diminished, but its remaining power was still terrifying. Even though Long Chen had grabbed it first, it was still strong enough to pierce straight through him.

A violent power tore through Long Chen’s body, threatening to blow him apart. Fortunately, he managed to hold on.

After the whale spine pierced him, Long Chen felt a sharp pain at the back of his head. Reacting swiftly, he twisted his head, narrowly avoiding an incredibly thin sword that sliced across his cheek.

“I’ve finally found my chance. Let’s see how you’ll survive this time.”

At this moment, Ying Tian’s slimy voice echoed through the chaos.
