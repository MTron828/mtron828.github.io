Chapter 3224 Going Down the Mountain

Long Chen shook his head. He had always thought that the Heavenly Daos were targeting him and trying to get him killed. As for why, he really couldn’t say.

“The heavens place great responsibility on people. But those people must first be tested. Their muscles might break, their stomachs are empty, and they turn into nothing but skin and bones. This struggle is what turns them into people capable of great power. All true experts have gone through their own struggles. For the Heavenly Daos to reject you, for the Human Dao to bully you, it is the storm that rages across the plain, leaving only the tough grass. It is the fire that leaves behind only the true gold. The moment I saw you, I could sense that brutality deep in your inner heart. Although your eyes have been sealed, I can sense that terrifying dark energy. If you are allowed to grow, you will possess the power to destroy the entire world. In theory, you should be a Divergent of heaven and earth, someone who should not exist in this world. Such an existence will face heavenly punishment and be wiped out. And yet, you are still alive. That means that you have great goodness in your heart, and the heavens will not kill you. But your heart also has great evil, so the Heavenly Daos desire to wipe you out. You are a combination of contradictions, so the Heavenly Daos have also become contradictory. Whether you are destroyed or not rests on the line between good and evil,” said Luo Zichuan.

“Are you saying that the Heavenly Daos are not destroying me because I have good in my heart, but they don’t like me because I have evil in my heart? But all people have good and evil in their hearts. Why are they targeting me?” asked Long Chen.

Luo Zichuan nodded. “That is the real question. But you shouldn’t be asking me this question. You should ask yourself.”

“Ask myself?” Long Chen stared blankly.

Suddenly, his heart jumped. Was it his status as a nine star heir?

Luo Zichuan stood up and turned his back to Long Chen, looking into the distance. He muttered, “The current Heavenly Daos are no longer the old Heavenly Daos. There is a mysterious existence with supreme power affecting the neutrality of the Heavenly Daos. However, there is one thing that you must understand. The Heavenly Daos and the Human Dao, they are all good and bad. Some people will harm you, and some will help you. You must be clear on which ones are enemies and which ones are friends. Don’t view everyone around you as an enemy just because of the one enemy in front of you.”

Long Chen was shocked. Luo Zichuan had also seen something about him and was warning him. Was he saying that it was because of the nine stars that Long Chen was targeted by the Heavenly Daos?

However, at the same time as he was targeted, he also received a portion of the Heavenly Daos’ protection. He was not abandoned by the Heavenly Daos. It was just that he was constantly rejected by Heavenly Dao energy. It was only now that Long Chen’s thinking changed.

Unfortunately, Luo Zichuan was being rather obscure with his words. He didn’t say anything directly. Long Chen also didn’t dare to be sure that his guess was correct.

“For you to use Heavenly Dao energy will be a hundred times more difficult than others. Today, you have only opened the door. You’ll need to slowly comprehend and experience it yourself in the future,” said Luo Zichuan. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

“Junior understands,” said Long Chen.

Luo Zichuan had opened a door for Long Chen. This was a door to an entirely new world, so Long Chen had truly benefited immensely.

“You have too much power. Compared to the saber in your hand, you rely more on your own power. That is currently the area that you are lacking the most compared to me. The heavens have the laws of the heavens. All things have their own attributes. Hence, a saber is not just an extension of your body. It is the link connecting you to heaven and earth. However, I am unable to teach you such a thing. The only one who can teach you is yourself. If I tried to explain it with my saber, then after that teaching, only one of us would be alive. That would no longer be a lesson but a killing. You will need to rely on yourself to learn those things. But you also don’t need to be in a rush. Right now, you don’t even have a suitable saber for yourself. Perhaps one day it will find you,” said Luo Zichuan.

Long Chen instantly thought of Dragonbone Evilmoon. It had once been his most trusted companion. With it, perhaps Long Chen would be able to gain deeper insights into the Saber Dao.

When it came to the saber, his only technique right now was the first form of Split the Heavens. But in front of Luo Zichuan, Long Chen had no chance of unleashing it.

Luo Zichuan’s attacks were like a tempest, so big moves like that were a joke in front of him. There was no chance of unleashing it. Trying to would be no different than suicide.

However, after this battle, Long Chen saw a new direction for Split the Heavens. He could change it, allowing Heavenly Dao energy to merge into it, greatly shortening the cast time. He was looking forward to it.

Long Chen stared at Luo Zichuan’s back. After a moment of hesitation, he said, “Grandfather, I…”

“Let’s go. The food has been prepared.” Luo Zichuan interrupted him. Just like that, he began descending the Honing Heavenly Staircase.

Long Chen followed him. Before this, he was always sent tumbling down. Now that he was walking down, he found that descending the mountain was even harder than climbing it. He found it difficult to control his own body.

“Life is like climbing one mountain after another. Beyond the mountain you see before you, there is always another mountain. But most people can only see what is right in front of them. Once they reach the peak of the mountain, they gaze into the distance and see an even larger mountain. To get there, you must descend the mountain that you have climbed. Many people are only capable of climbing, but not descending. They do not realize that the descent is preparation for the next climb. Thus, countless people become dispirited and depressed when they descend the mountain. By the time the next mountain is in front of them, they have no more energy and are powerless to climb it. These valleys are the greatest trial in a person’s life. Only when your Dao-heart is steady while crossing these valleys can you make all your preparations for the climb. You have done well in this regard. No matter what kind of despair I forced you into, your Dao-heart remained unshaken. That is something I was unable to achieve in my youth,” said Luo Zichuan as he walked.

Every single one of Luo Zichuan’s words contained deep meaning. But Long Chen only wanted to ask where his mother was. He wasn’t too interested in these words.

“Grandfather, my mother…”

Luo Zichuan suddenly stopped. Long Chen was so frightened that he almost instinctively whipped out his saber.

Without turning back, Luo Zichuan lightly said, “Do you not understand what climbing down the mountain means? Sometimes your path might look like it’s leading you away from your target, but surprisingly, it is precisely the only correct path. You cannot tell your identity to anyone, including those uncles of yours, understood?”

“Understood.”

Long Chen helplessly nodded. Luo Zichuan truly was mysterious. Most of his words were vague.

However, he understood that Luo Zichuan did not wish to talk about his mother. As for why, Luo Zichuan definitely had his reasons. For him to say this, he was essentially telling Long Chen not to mention this matter again.

At the same time, the matter of him being his grandson was to be kept secret. Even his uncles were to be kept in the dark. Long Chen vaguely felt like there was something big that he didn’t know going on.
