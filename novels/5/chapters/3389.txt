Chapter 3378 Taking a Risk

The formation was broken. The city was flooded by an endless army of the Ghost Dao’s lifeforms. As a result, miserable screams rose and the city instantly became a living hell.

The Netherworld’s experts were torn apart by the Ghost Dao’s lifeforms. Flesh and blood flew through the air. It was truly a terrifying sight.

“Hold on! My master will soon arrive!” shouted Long Chen. If nothing else, this could con those five fellows into protecting him.

The five of them immediately took out their weapons and started slaughtering these lifeforms.

They were still hoping for Long Chen’s so-called master to come save them. If they wanted to stay alive, they had to make sure that Long Chen didn’t die.

However, there were too many Ghost Dao lifeforms, and of the five of them, only two of them were at full power. The others had lost the support of their territories, so they were quickly riddled with wounds from those lifeforms’ teeth and claws.

“When will your master arrive?! We’ll all die if it takes any longer!” shouted one of them.

“Soon, very soon! We’re just a bit off!” shouted Long Chen, making a show of earnestly checking a jade tablet.

This was actually the jade talisman to teleport him out. But he didn’t dare to use it. If he tried to, the five of them might instantly kill him.

“AH!”

A Nethergod suddenly had half his body devoured by a lifeform with a crocodile’s head. The others wanted to save him, but too many enemies instantly pounced on them. That Nethergod was instantly torn apart.

The lifeforms that devoured him had their withered bodies grow plump. Their auras also grew stronger.

“No!”

With the loss of that Nethergod, the situation grew even more dire. Another one was immediately dragged away, his corpse split between those lifeforms.

They were no longer able to protect Long Chen. So, Long Chen took out his saber and started fighting himself as he hid behind the other Nethergods.Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

The rest of the city had been devoured. It was just Long Chen and the other three barely hanging on. Long Chen glanced at the distant spatial crack and found that at some point, it had closed.

BANG!

Suddenly, Long Chen kicked the city lord’s butt, sending him tumbling forward. This elder had never expected Long Chen to do such a thing. The loss in balance resulted in him being instantly devoured.

“What are you doing?!”

The remaining two were shocked, not understanding why Long Chen would harm them. Just as they were bewildered, they were drowned by the army of lifeforms.

As for Long Chen himself, he shot away. Right now, he was the only person remaining in the city. An endless tide of Ghost Dao lifeforms charged at him from below.

While flying through the air, lightning wings spread on his back. He shot into the distance and swung his saber behind him.

BOOM!

A giant saber-image slashed down. Countless lifeforms were exterminated, but many powerful lifeforms endured it and continued chasing.

Long Chen was fleeing at the front, and an endless army of the Ghost Dao lifeforms were chasing him from behind, looking like a long dragon refusing to give up on hunting its prey.

“Split the Heavens!”

Long Chen suddenly turned back and slashed down his saber. As a result, the closest lifeforms were blasted apart, and tens of thousands of them were slain.

However, that was practically nothing to this army. It merely slowed them down for a moment.

What infuriated Long Chen was that the jade talisman was ineffective. These lifeforms seemed to emit a strange force field that blocked the talisman’s function. Most likely, he would need to fly a certain distance away from them in order to use the talisman. But these lifeforms were like glue, refusing to leave him alone.

“Wait a minute! I’m not from the Netherworld. Why are you chasing me?!” Long Chen shouted as he ran.

But those lifeforms ignored his shout and continued chasing. Wherever they went, the ground was torn asunder, leaving ruins and desolation in their wake.

Long Chen was as quick as lightning, but those lifeforms were not slow. Some winged ones were even faster than Long Chen. In just a few seconds, they were right behind him.

With no other choice, Long Chen used Split the Heavens once more, resolving the danger before him temporarily. But he knew he couldn’t keep doing this.

Although he had advanced to the tenth Heavenstage, after unleashing Split the Heavens thirty-six times in a row, his spiritual yuan was starting to drop. As for that army, he didn’t see any change in their numbers. If this continued, his spiritual yuan would run out before he killed even a tenth of them.

“Fuck, what is this luck!?” Long Chen cursed furiously. Everything had been planned, only for these ghosts to come out.

Long Chen was unable to understand. Even if these lifeforms were to mince him, each one wouldn’t even be able to obtain a single speck of him, no? But they still refused to give up. It seemed that they wouldn’t give up until they devoured him. He was so infuriated that he got a stomach ache.

“Wait, could it be… were they after me from the start?” Long Chen’s heart suddenly sank.

If they really were targeting him, how could he, someone at the Four Peak realm who wasn’t even a lifeform of the Netherworld, cause this giant army of lifeforms of the Ghost Dao to chase after him?

“Is it due to the Ghost Dao mark? But we should be on the same side then! Why would we kill each other?”

Long Chen was repeatedly attacking, leaving behind countless corpses. But these lifeforms never gave up. Not one chose to stop chasing.

“If this continues, I’ll have to take a risk.” Long Chen took a deep breath. A determined expression appeared in his eyes. Clenching his teeth, he shot off in a certain direction.

…

Leng Yueyan and Ming Cangyue led their people at full speed to the final city. But they were stunned by what they saw.

The city was in ruins. There was blood everywhere, and the smell was nauseating.

Leng Yueyan and Ming Cangyue quickly scoured the city and found several weapons belonging to Nethergods. But those weapons’ runes had long since dimmed and shattered. Their masters were already dead.

“Not good! This place was attacked by the Ghost Dao hunters!” Their expressions changed when they saw the countless corpses of the Ghost Dao hunters within the city.

“It’s that direction! Let’s go!”

Leng Yueyan looked into the distance. There was a giant ditch in one direction, and the two of them immediately set off with their people.

“Long Chen, you have to be alright!”

Leng Yueyan and Ming Cangyue prayed inside. Their hearts clenched. They had never imagined that this place would suddenly be sneak attacked by the Ghost Dao hunters.
