Chapter 2176 Do Not Interfere

Pill Valley’s people had arrived, and Yu Xiaoyun immediately interrogated Long Chen. The other experts arriving had worried expressions upon seeing that the qi flow eruption was right next to the entrance to the Yin Yang World.

There was a huge amount of power bursting out of the earth right now. If that power struck the Sovereign seal, then this shield of the Martial Heaven Continent would be blown away, and the army of the Blood race would be free to invade.

“So Long Chen, now what can you say?! Saying you colluded with the original devil race was entirely true! You are a traitor of the continent, and now everyone has seen your true face!” shouted the leader of the ancient races, Long Juncang.

The Xuan Beasts, the ancient races, the Corrupt path, the Stone race, the four everlasting families, all the large powers of the continent were arriving.

Seeing Long Chen occupying the largest stream of qi flow as well as the nearby Sovereign seal, and then hearing the cursing from Pill Valley’s experts, they all came to realize something.

“How could this be? How could Long Chen be a traitor of the Martial Heaven Alliance?” Beitang Rushuang’s expression changed. She didn’t believe that Long Chen would do such a thing, but his current display seemed to be the greatest proof against him. There was no need for slander.

At this time, the Martial Heaven Alliance also arrived, and Qu Jianying was stunned to see the Dragonblood Legion and the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow race within the beam of light.

“Alliance head Qu Jianying, now do you have anything to say?” sneered the sect master of a sect that had left the Martial Heaven Alliance.

Li Tianxuan and the old man were both startled as well. Just how was it that Long Chen had known the location and time of the qi flow eruption? Furthermore, if he knew, why didn’t he tell them?

“Long Chen, what is going on?” asked Qu Jianying. Although she was full of suspicions, she refused to believe that Long Chen was a traitor of the Martial Heaven Continent.

“What is there to ask? Long Chen is a traitor! Qu Jianying, you foolish woman, are you still trying to quibble and protect him?” demanded an elder who had betrayed the Martial Heaven Alliance.

That elder’s voice was still ringing through the air when a golden arrow shot through his head, killing him in mind and body.

That golden arrow had come so suddenly and was so fast that by the time people reacted, the elder was already dead.

Within the light beam, Guo Ran was holding a three-foot-long blood-colored crossbow. He coldly said, “Is our alliance head someone an opportunist like you can shout at? Do you want to try again?”

There was no need to try because that person was dead and couldn’t possibly make another sound.

“Guo Ran, you sneak-attacking trash-”

An Empyrean disciple standing behind the elder shouted at Guo Ran, summoning his awakened manifestation. As a result, Guo Ran’s second arrow pierced through that disciple’s shield and then blew up the disciple’s body. His Yuan Spirit was protected by the shield, but his physical body was destroyed.

“Bas-!”

His Yuan Spirit had only appeared for a moment before Guo Ran’s next arrow exterminated him.

“I, Guo Ran, disdain shooting while hidden. Are you an idiot? My crossbow lit up, so how can it count as a sneak attack? Are you blind?” sneered Guo Ran.

“Long Chen, do you think martial power can silence the voices of the heroes of the Martial Heaven Continent? Your sins cannot be let off this time!” Dongfang Yuyang stepped forward, coldly looking at Long Chen.

“Long Chen what is going on?” shouted Qu Jianying. Many experts behind her were shaken by this, and she needed to give them an explanation.

Long Chen said, “Alliance head, I will say one thing. Not one of us is a traitor of the Martial Heaven Continent.”

“Then how did you know the location of the qi flow eruption? The entire continent has been looked through by my people, but we didn’t find it. You definitely hid it!” shouted an ancient race expert.

Long Chen indifferently looked at that person. He shook his head. “You and I are not related in any way. I’m too lazy to respond to your question.” Turning to Qu Jianying, he said, “Alliance head, this is a world where the weak are devoured by the strong. I’ve had enough of wasting time, trying to explain things to idiots. As for how I know the location and time of the qi flow eruption, I can’t be bothered to explain because explaining will only cause a bunch of people to refute me. People who are familiar with me know that I disdain lying and don’t need me to explain. Those who don’t believe me would say I’m lying no matter what I say. So why bother? We’re all busy people, so don’t make up fake excuses. If you want to kill me, then just come!”

“Senior apprentice-brother Long Chen, I believe you!” shouted one of the Martial Heaven Alliance’s disciples.

“Senior apprentice-brother Long Chen, we all believe you!” Following the first, many disciples of the Martial Heaven Alliance shouted together.

A large portion of those people had fought alongside the Dragonblood Legion in the Yin Yang World. They immediately thought of that intense fight with the entrance to the Yin Yang World right in front of them.

The Dragonblood Legion’s bravery and heroism were still imprinted strongly in their minds. With Long Chen and the Dragonblood Legion here, facing the heavenly geniuses of the various powers, it felt similar to that battle from back then.

“People who are suspecting senior apprentice-brother Long Chen, are you all idiots? If it weren’t for him, the Martial Heaven Alliance would have long since been destroyed by their coalition! Have you already forgotten how those greedy wolves have fractured our interior bit by bit?” shouted someone.

“Have you been brainwashed by Long Chen? Since he could betray the Martial Heaven Continent, he could do anything. Who doesn’t know how to pretend to be a good person?”

“You coward, come out and say that in front of everyone! Since you say senior apprentice-brother Long Chen is a coward, you should be able to wager some blood on that, right? Come out instead of hiding in the ground! People like you are the trash of the cultivation world!”

“You...!”

“What you? I’m giving you a chance to pretend to be a good person! Do you want it or not? Didn’t you say everyone knows how to do this? Senior apprentice-brother Long Chen risked his life time and time again to protect us. Now you slander him loudly, but become a coward when it comes time to actually take action?”

“That’s enough!” Yu Xiaoyun’s thunderous voice rang out, ending the shouting between the two of them. “Everyone has already seen that Long Chen can’t even give an explanation. This kind of play probably couldn’t even trick a three-year-old child. Now, he has occupied the largest stream of qi flow. We should all attack together to exterminate him for the Martial Heaven Alliance. Whoever kills Long Chen will be given the largest stream of qi flow as a reward. What does everyone think of this?”

“I like it. It’s decided!” The Stone race’s Shi Lingfeng was the first to agree and shoot out, followed by over ten thousand experts of the Stone race.

Following that, the Corrupt path, ancient races, Xuan Beasts, Pill Valley, the ancient family alliance, and the other various powers also moved.

“Alliance head, we trust senior apprentice-brother Long Chen. He is definitely no traitor of the Martial Heaven Alliance. Let’s help him!” shouted one disciple.

“Just how much has Long Chen done for the Martial Heaven Alliance? If we don’t stand together with him now, are we even cultivators? Alliance head, please give the order! The Martial Heaven Alliance must stand beside Long Chen!” said one of the Elders.

“That’s right, I agree with Elder Qi’s opinion. A person needs to know how to repay kindness. They can’t choose to be a coward just because of some danger,” said one sect leader. He was one of Qu Jianying’s earliest supporters. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

“Alliance head, since you trust Long Chen fully, we can trust him as well. Let us fight and show the power of the Martial Heaven Alliance!” said another sect leader.

More and more disciples and elders spoke up in support of Long Chen. Curiously, the old man didn’t say anything, instead standing quietly beside Qu Jianying.

On the other hand, Bao Buping and Chang Hao weren’t able to stand still. “Are we fighting or not? If we are, we’re going first!”

Bao Buping had just finished shouting when he was kicked by Boss Bao. Boss Bao glared at him and pointed stealthily to the old man.

He was indicating that it was rare for the old man to be getting along well with the alliance head, so Bao Buping shouldn’t add oil to the fire.

Qu Jianying’s heart was moved. After the large waves washed away the sand, what was left was the gold. These loyal members of the Martial Heaven Alliance all trusted her.

Qu Jianying looked at the old man. The old man merely smiled faintly. “No need to look at me. I’ll listen to you. You can treat me as your subordinate.

Boss Bao and the others were stunned to find that when the old man smiled, Qu Jianying actually blushed.

Boss Bao and the others exchanged glances. The two of them had definitely gotten up to something romantic. However, Boss Bao and the others didn’t dare to say anything. They could guess why the old man had gone from a violent tiger to a docile cat.

Qu Jianying raised her hand, about to give the order to attack, when Long Chen’s voice rang out.

“This battle belongs to my Dragonblood Legion and the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow race. It is a battle to the death against the various powers who oppose us. I would ask others to not interfere. If you are neutral, then do what you came to do. If you’re friends, find a place with good fengshui to watch. If you’re enemies, then come at us. This is your best chance to kill me. Don’t miss it.”

“What is this brat thinking?!” Qu Jianying was stunned. Her hand was still hanging in the air. She didn’t know whether or not she was to support Long Chen.

“Let’s find a place with good fengshui to watch. We can occupy some good qi flow streams now.” Li Tianxuan looked around and saw that other powers had started occupying the strongest qi flow streams. They led their group over to a large light beam.
