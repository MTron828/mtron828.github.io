Chapter 4398 Curious Little Crane

Long Chen’s group of three left through the transportation formation. However, even after their departure, the people within and outside the city didn’t dare to move. The experts from other races, in particular, were drenched in sweat, with some emitting unpleasant odors. Something beyond sweat had been unleashed.

On the contrary, the human race's experts were brimming with excitement. This place was right next to the High Firmament Academy, so the experts of the other races didn’t dare to be too aggressive here. Despite this, they frequently bullied the humans in this area.

However, Long Chen had just come and killed many of those experts ruthlessly. Was that also the attitude of the High Firmament Academy?

If that was the case, then the Darklight Heaven was about to be flipped on its head. Long Chen’s return could signify something big.

The experts of the other races eventually recovered from their shock and slipped away. Some of them were so apprehensive that they refrained from using transportation formations, fearing they might end up in the same place as Long Chen.

“Dean Long Chen is back, so the Darklight Heaven is about to change!” the human experts laughed delightedly. How much longer could the other races maintain their arrogance?

Although Long Chen had been away from the Darklight Heaven for several years now, and countless heavenly geniuses had risen in the Darklight Heaven, those heavenly geniuses were lacking a great deal compared to Long Chen.

When Long Chen rose, the heavenly geniuses of his generation became mere fireflies, envious of the moon's brilliance. His radiance completely overshadowed theirs.

As for the experts from other races, they promptly delved into Long Chen's background and swiftly reported this development to their seniors.

The transportation formation lit up, and Long Chen walked out while holding Little Crane’s hand. Bally was walking behind them.

This place was Silver Moon City, an extremely famous city within the Darklight Heaven. It was also where the Nine Prefecture Convention had been held last time.

During the end of the Nine Prefecture Convention, chaos ensued, resulting in the death of the city lord. Since then, Silver Moon City had changed hands multiple times. When the gates to other worlds opened, those other races viewed this place as a chunk of fatty meat.

Presently, Eternal experts from various worlds were stationed within Silver Moon City. Numerous factions had established their territories inside, leading to an environment of extreme chaos as these factions vied over territory and power.

Since Long Chen’s last visit, Silver Moon City had expanded by a hundred times its original size, transforming into a major hub. Experts of the various worlds had occupied some territories inside, engaging in trades using unique goods from their respective worlds to acquire what they needed.

However, there was a lack of universal currency for these exchanges, and it was all too easy for accidents to occur while trading.

The human race’s currency was ordinary spirit stones, but now, they also incorporated primal chaos spirit stones. Occasionally, medicinal pills were also used as a form of currency.

However, the experts from other worlds had no use for spirit stones or medicinal pills. Their needs were exceptionally peculiar.

As a result, it was hard to trade well here. Sometimes, people would feel like they had lost out the moment they finished a trade and would immediately attack the other side. In some cases, lifeforms would directly seize desired items if a trade went awry. In essence, Silver Moon City was far from peaceful. Possessing treasures without sufficient strength was equivalent to inviting danger.

“Master, you have to be careful. This place is dangerous and has many experts. As a human, you might be targeted,” warned Bally.

Bally was looking after Little Crane, constantly playing with her and making her happy. It appeared to have embraced its role as a caretaker with enthusiasm.

“Target me? Good. I won’t have to feel bad then,” said Long Chen.

“There are lots of bad people here. A lot more than in the last city.” Little Crane frowned as she surveyed Silver Moon City. As an auspicious beast, she felt the atmosphere was thick with smoke and dust, making her uncomfortable.

“Big Brother Long Chen, my mom told me that this world has three kinds of people,” said Little Crane suddenly.

Long Chen was startled. It seemed that Little Crane wanted to impart a lesson. Hence, he smiled and squatted down to meet her eyes at the same level.

“What three kinds of people? Let me learn a bit.”

“My mom said that these three are good people, bad people, and people who are a mix of good and bad,” said Little Crane seriously.RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

“That makes sense.” Long Chen nodded.

“Good people and bad people are one in a million, while people who are a mix of good and bad are the absolute majority. Good people and bad people’s characters are set in stone, and no matter what happens, a good person will never become a bad person, and a bad person will never become a good person. Even if a good person is harmed countless times, they will still harbor goodness in their heart. Conversely, a bad person, even if treated well by everyone, will be unable to change the badness in their bones,” explained Little Crane.

Hearing this, Long Chen quivered. What was going on? Was this a message Little Crane's mother was conveying to him through Little Crane?

It had to be known that these words certainly didn't originate from Little Crane herself. They carried a deeper, more profound meaning, so Long Chen listened attentively, disregarding the presence of those around him.

Little Crane continued, “The people who are a mix of good and bad are easily influenced. If they’re with good people, they’ll become good. If they’re with bad people, they’ll become bad. But my mom said that the influence of good people cannot compare to the influence of bad people. You might need to be good to someone ten times to convert them into a good person, but if you are bad to someone once, it will plant a seed in their heart, and that seed will affect them for the rest of their life. I asked my mom if our rainbow crane race is good or bad, but mom said that our race is neither good nor bad. Our mission is to pass auspicious signs to people who can change the world. If those people are good, then we are good. If they are bad, then we are bad.”

Long Chen looked into Little Crane’s eyes. Her words seemed careless yet also intentful. Was this an advice from her mother?

“Big Brother Long Chen, do you think you’re good or bad?” asked Little Crane suddenly.

“I suppose I should count as bad!” Long Chen smiled bitterly.

“Hehe, then I’ll be bad with Big Brother Long Chen! Even in hell, I’ll be with Big Brother Long Chen. I’ll never regret it,” said Little Crane.

Her smile was pure and innocent, typical of a kind little girl. For some reason, hearing that she would never regret it made Long Chen feel a pang of heartache.

“Even in hell, Big Brother will always protect you. Big Brother will make sure your eyes keep their pure light forever,” Long Chen assured as he gently rubbed Little Crane's head, solemnly swearing his commitment.

Little Crane giggled. She was about to reply when a gust of wind blew by, accompanied by an angry shout.

“Humans, get out of the way!"
