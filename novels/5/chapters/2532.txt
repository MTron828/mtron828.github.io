Chapter 2521 The Fiend King’s Revival

The Dragonblood Legion’s fury soared. Dongfang Yuyang’s despicable shamelessness drove them crazy. A generation’s heavenly genius had actually sunk to this level.

As long as Long Chen gave the order, the Dragonblood warriors would immediately charge over and fight Dongfang Yuyang to the death.

“You ants are not qualified to wave your claws at me. Or do you want to try it?” Dongfang Yuyang raised Ye Lingshan in front of him, using her as a shield.

Blood dripped off of Ye Lingshan. She clenched her teeth, refusing to make a sound.

It was unknown just how much pain Ye Lingshan was currently enduring. Dongfang Yuyang was intentionally tormenting her to provoke everyone. Despite her covering up that pain, the more she acted like that, the more infuriated people were.

“So, Long Chen, are you going to stop or not? Do you really need me to do some more? Do you want me to tear off her clothes and let every man here enjoy the beauty of the future leader of the Martial Heaven Alliance? If that’s what you want, I’ll do it.” Dongfang Yuyang ignored everyone’s furious gazes, smiling sinisterly at Long Chen.

“Tear off her clothes for us to enjoy. This woman…” Zhao Ritian laughed, as if humiliating Ye Lingshan could make him feel better and win him back some face.

“Shut up!” Feng Fei immediately shouted, cutting him off. Dongfang Yuyang’s actions even made her feel disgraceful.

However, she was currently on the same side as Dongfang Yuyang. Although she detested his actions, she could only silently accept them.

On the other hand, Zhao Ritian was actually loudly encouraging him. Once they left the Star Field Divine World, it would give a terrible name to the divine families.

Someone else was already taking on the burden of the villain, but he just had to open his mouth and share some of that burden. Feng Fei had an urge to slap him.

“Big brother Long Chen, what should I do?” Dong Mingyu’s voice rang out in Long Chen’s ear.

Dong Mingyu was hidden in the air. No one could see her. She was like a ghost guarding Long Chen.

Dongfang Yuyang had truly infuriated her. She wanted to kill him, but she had no guarantee of being able to assassinate him in one blow.

She also had no idea what Dongfang Yuyang had done to Ye Lingshan. Perhaps he would kill Ye Lingshan as soon as Dong Mingyu appeared. That was why Dong Mingyu had yet to strike.

Mo Nian’s veins were throbbing, and the Heaven Seizing Sun Hunting Bow was quivering. He wished to charge over. He regretted not killing him back then.

“Release her,” said Long Chen finally.

Both friend and foe jumped in fright upon hearing his voice. That voice was hoarse and terrifyingly cold. It was as if he was a completely different person. It was like the voice of a devil from hell.

Meng Qi and the others turned to stare at Long Chen. They were shocked to find that at some point, his eyes had turned black.

“Pull back your Spiritual Strength and I’ll release her. I, Dongfang Yuyang, always keep my word,” said Dongfang Yuyang with a pleased smile.

Everyone’s gazes concentrated on Long Chen, awaiting his decision.

“Long Chen, you can’t!” Ye Lingshan suddenly shouted upon seeing Long Chen slowly release his hand seal.

Dongfang Yuyang immediately snorted, causing Ye Lingshan to cough up a mouthful of blood and no longer be able to make a noise. She stared at Long Chen with disappointment.

In her eyes, this decision of Long Chen’s was the height of foolishness. She would rather die and use her death to give the Martial Heaven Alliance’s disciples a fanatical drive to get stronger to wipe away this humiliation.

She could see that Long Chen was about to win. He was abandoning all that because of her.

She was shocked, infuriated, as well as moved. She hated herself for being useless. How was she supposed to lead the Martial Heaven Alliance in the future when she had fallen into someone else’s hands and became a trump card to be used against Long Chen? She would never be able to live with this humiliation.

She was unable to change anything, so she had accepted her death. But Long Chen really had chosen to submit for her. The calm indifference she had kept up vanished, and she was unable to bring it back up. She couldn’t hold back her tears.

The flame lotus on the altar slowly dissipated. All the flames on it vanished. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

Without the karmic hell flames burning, the altar rumbled. The Heaven Devouring Fiend King’s corpse began to quiver.

“Now, can you release her?” said Long Chen coldly.

“Release her? Of course, but not right now.” Dongfang Yuyang smiled. He was eating his own words.

“Dongfang Yuyang, can you have some fucking sense of shame? In front of every single person here, you’re breaking your word!” Both the Martial Heaven Alliance’s experts and the neutral experts began to curse.

“When did I break my word? I said that I would release her, but I didn’t say when or where. Once we leave the Star Field Divine World, I will send the beautiful Ye Lingshan to the Martial Heaven Alliance safe and sound,” said Dongfang Yuyang.

Clearly, Dongfang Yuyang didn’t want to give up this precious trump card so quickly. Long Chen had even given up the victory that was right before his eyes for Ye Lingshan. That meant that Dongfang Yuyang had endless uses for her.

Suddenly, a white figure appeared and a sword slashed through the air. Dongfang Yuyang was startled. He was about to pull back when sharp pain came from his arm.

His arm was severed without him even being aware of it. The sword hadn’t even touched his arm yet.

Everyone stared. Yun Tian had used some method to appear in front of Ye Lingshan and strike him. As for his sword, it had broken the limits of spacetime. By the time they saw his sword, it had cut off Dongfang Yuyang’s arm. Even though Dongfang Yuyang had been on guard against a sudden attack the entire time, he wasn’t able to prevent this.

Dongfang Yuyang reached out to grab Ye Lingshan with his other hand, but when the sword shook again, his expression changed. His body became illusory.

Dongfang Yuyang’s body was cleanly cut in two. However, this body was just an afterimage. He had fled miles away.

Ye Lingshan fell from the sky, and Meng Qi caught her. After investigating her body, her fury soared.

“Despicable!”

There was a strange poison within Ye Lingshan’s body that was devouring her soul.

“Give her to me.” Liu Ruyan pressed her hand on Ye Lingshang’s back. At this moment, Ye Lingshan’s face was rapidly turning black. Her life energy was rapidly fading.

“Die!” Dongfang Yuyang sneered from a distance. He formed hand seals, fully activating the poison in Ye Lingshan’s body.

A towering willow appeared behind Liu Ruyan. She snorted. “A bit of witchcraft is all.”

The willow trembled and black qi flowed out of it, filling the air. It gave off a chilling aura.

“What powerful poison!”

Everyone was startled. Dongfang Yuyang’s despicableness made their hair stand up in anger. Fortunately, Liu Ruyan was an Undying Willow. She had drawn out the poison with her own body.

Dongfang Yuyang’s expression sank, but then he laughed and entered the barrier of the altar, sneering at Long Chen. “All your efforts were wasted. Now just wait to be killed. When the Heaven Devouring Fiend King is revived, you and your Dragonblood Legion will be erased from this world.”

Ye Lingshan had been saved, but all of Long Chen’s previous effort was wasted. Everyone stared at the altar blankly.

Yun Tian sheathed his sword, not continuing to attack Dongfang Yuyang. He silently retreated to his original position. Before he could say anything, the Pill Fairy said, “My Pill Valley’s disciples joined the fight, while you interfered to save Ye Lingshan. We are even now.”

The disciples of Pill Valley had asked her what to do. Although she didn’t encourage them, when Zhao Ritian summoned them, she didn’t stop them either. That could be counted as cheating, so she said that Yun Tian’s interference by saving Ye Lingshan could cancel each other out.

Furthermore, Yu Qingxuan also felt immense disgust for Dongfang Yuyang’s actions. She was embarrassed to be on the same side as him. Victory or defeat could be decided with an aboveboard fight, but Dongfang Yuyang’s actions had tainted their side. Now all of them were sharing a part of that infamy.

“Long Chen, you fool, why did you do this?! Are you trying to turn me into the one who gets us all killed? You should never have saved me.” Ye Lingshan couldn’t stop herself from sobbing.

She couldn’t face such a life. This was worse than dying. Even as she cried, she couldn’t help falling into Long Chen’s embrace.

She didn’t know how she would face the future. How was she supposed to face the people of the Martial Heaven Alliance? She was currently not a powerful woman, but a lost and weak person.

“Sleep. You’re overthinking it. Since I dared to save you, I won’t let you die here.” Long Chen patted Ye Lingshan’s head. She fell unconscious.

Long Chen handed her to Meng Qi and then took a deep breath. Evilmoon appeared in his hand. Right now, there was nothing else left to do other than fight.

Buzz.

The altar blazed with light, and the Heaven Devouring Fiend King’s quivering body rose slowly.

A burst of hair-raising laughter rang out. It was a chilling sound that pierced everyone’s eardrums. The Dragonblood warriors tensed up. The Heaven Devouring Fiend King had been revived.
