Chapter 2194 Shocking World Energy

Dongfang Yuyang had barely gotten close to Long Chen when a terrifying qi wave blasted them back. It was like a star had exploded, and the four of them were unable to resist.

“What?!”

The four of them were shocked, and their first guess as to what had just happened was that Long Chen had exploded. Otherwise, there was no way that just his aura could force them back.

The others watching were also stunned. Qi waves continued to surge out of Long Chen with such power that the laws of the Heavenly Daos crumbled around him. In that instant, Long Chen seemed to be isolated by the rest of the world.

“Without a heavens’ soul manifestation, without the support of the Heavenly Daos, without any aura of some ancient power, how does he possess such might?”

“It seems to be pure world energy... but how could his world energy be so terrifying?”

“If it really is pure world energy, then his astral space has to be unimaginably big. It can actually go against the laws of the Martial Heaven Continent.”

All kinds of guesses were made. Long Chen’s power could only be described as terrifying. From ancient times to now, there had never been a case of someone whose world energy could reach such a level.

Long Chen spread his arms and roared. A blast of power caused the world to collapse around him. The collapsed space spread as if he was hammering it over and over again. Tian Xiezi, Kun Pengzi, Shi Lingfeng, and Dongfang Yuyang were forced to back further away.

Twelve blasts came from Long Chen’s body. Standing within a giant hole, Long Chen looked like a devil god. His eyes were scarlet, and his black hair whipped around him.

The 108,000 stars within his body had linked up into one giant starry diagram. With it, he felt as if he controlled the power of a whole cosmos. Every star had grown to a size of three hundred thousand miles. When he advanced to the twelfth Heavenstage, his power could no longer be controlled, and he was forced to allow it to explode outside of him. It was like a dam being released, and as his power blasted out of him, he felt a sense of relief.

“I refuse to believe this!” Shi Lingfeng roared. Long Chen was actually more powerful, more terrifying than before. He could not accept this. The Stone Emperor within his manifestation unleashed a punch at Long Chen.

“You can refuse to believe it, but you’ll have to believe this.” Long Chen smiled. The World Trees in his primal chaos space rapidly withered as he drew out their life energy to heal. He only managed to fully recover when they were completely withered.

“My physical body is now so strong that the World Trees aren’t able to keep up anymore.” Long Chen clenched his fist. The growth of his astral spaces had forced his physical body to also become stronger. He quickly put on a new set of black robes made personally by Chu Yao. In his new robes, he looked even more striking.

BOOM!

Long Chen didn’t accumulate any power and just let out a simple punch. It was no magical art or Battle Skill. It was a simple punch backed by the power overflowing from him. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

However, this simple punch brought with it the sound of heaven and earth collapsing. This was a power that exceeded people’s understanding.

Long Chen’s punch not only blasted through the fist from the figure in Shi Lingfeng’s manifestation, but it also struck Shi Lingfeng’s fist. In front of everyone’s shocked gazes, Shi Lingfeng’s arm exploded, all the way up to his shoulder.

Long Chen quickly followed up with a kick to Shi Lingfeng’s abdomen, and the latter screamed. A hole appeared in his abdomen and golden blood flowed out. He shot back like a cannonball.

Shi Lingfeng’s manifestation stamped on the ground, trying to stabilize him, but Long Chen’s power was so great that he continued flipping through the air.

After flipping three times, Shi Lingfeng finally managed to stop. He had just barely stabilized himself with his manifestation when Long Chen appeared next to him like a gust of wind, unleashing another simple punch.

With just one arm, Shi Lingfeng didn’t dare to block it. He slammed a palm on the ground, while his manifestation unleashed another punch. He flew away.

However, he was prepared this time, and his other arm regrew. He formed hand seals. “Earth Energy, Heavenly Stone Source, Stone Ramparts Raise the Heavens!”

His manifestation stamped on the ground, and one giant stone wall after another appeared. There were thirty-six of them buying him time.

Long Chen shot through the stone walls. Those incredibly tough and thick walls were like piles of flour in front of him. A black shadow passed through them.

The thirty-six stone walls were instantly pierced through. Long Chen’s foot stamped onto Shi Lingfeng’s chest, so hard that a bulge appeared on his back. His body was almost stamped through.

Shi Lingfeng was sent flying once more. Everyone was flabbergasted as they saw Long Chen completely crush Shi Lingfeng.

“Heaven-defying, absolutely heaven-defying. Is Long Chen really human?”

Shi Lingfeng had activated his Spirit Blood and connected to his manifestation. His power had soared, yet he was still beaten by Long Chen to the point of being unable to retaliate.

“Stone Emperor Spirit, Bloodline Summons!”

Shi Lingfeng roared. Golden blood flowed out of his nose, eyes, ears, and mouth, turning his entire body golden.

The figure within his manifestation rumbled and gradually merged with him. Shi Lingfeng’s aura became ancient and domineering.

“He’s actually igniting his Spirit Blood!”

Startled cries rang out. Shi Lingfeng had managed to revitalize his Spirit Blood, so it was no longer like the ordinary Spirit Blood of other experts. It contained the power of his inheritance and was incomparably precious.

This kind of Spirit Blood was not replenishable. Every bit he used up would be gone forever. Once he used it all up, he would never be able to connect to his manifestation again.

Shi Lingfeng let out a bestial roar that created waves in the surrounding space. “Long Chen, I’ll tear your corpse to pieces!”

“This grand aspiration is something you’ll never achieve in this lifetime.” Long Chen faced the golden Shi Lingfeng directly. Long Chen’s fist struck Shi Lingfeng’s wild attack and caused the ground to sink.

“Support Shi Lingfeng!” Dongfang Yuyang immediately rushed over, getting a bad feeling upon seeing that even while igniting his Spirit Blood, Shi Lingfeng was unable to beat Long Chen. Once Shi Lingfeng’s Spirit Blood was used up, there would be no chance of defeating Long Chen.

Dongfang Yuyang rushed over with his spear and shield. An ancient aura spread out of him.

Kun Pengzi and Tian Xiezi also attacked. Kun Pengzi’s Kunpeng manifestation became golden, and divine light flowed from it into Kun Pengzi’s body. His lightning halberd rumbled.

Tian Xiezi’s divine halo glowed. The Corrupt God’s figure within his manifestation also enveloped Tian Xiezi in divine light. An evil air unfurled. With just a wave of his hand, death filled the air.

BOOM!

The four of them attacked at the same time, causing heaven and earth to collapse. However, what shocked everyone was that all four of them shot back, coughing up blood.

A pillar of light was at the center of their battlefield. That sight reminded people of the qi flow streams.

However, this pillar of light centered around Long Chen. His divine ring spun rapidly. The five-point star within the divine ring had been replaced with a six-sided design.

The six-sided design had five bright stars and one very dim star. The dim star was the Nethergate Star that he had just recently condensed.

This star had yet to go through the nine star transformations and so he was unable to summon the true Six Star Battle Armor. However, just its existence was enough to make Long Chen’s aura grow explosively.

Long Chen took eight steps through the air, each step causing his aura to grow more and more. At the eighth step, he raised his saber. “Split the Heavens 8!”

A black saber-image fell from the nine heavens like a black river of stars, bringing with it endless destructive power.

Dongfang Yuyang’s expression changed. Long Chen’s attack was targeted on him.

A ruthless expression appeared on his face. He put away his spear and shield. Pressing his palms together, the Dongfang family’s ancient castle appeared in the air.
