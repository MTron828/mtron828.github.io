Chapter 4299 Distributing Heavenly Dao Fruit

Long Zhantian departed, leaving Long Chen feeling disappointed and frustrated. He felt lost as the two of them hadn’t even had a chance to properly talk before they had to separate again.

Despite those feelings, Long Chen knew that his father was too concerned about his mother to just sit around. He had no other choice but to leave.

Unlike Long Chen, Long Zhantian was simply unwilling to believe that his wife was safe without seeing her. Thus, he still had to leave.

“Do you see? This is the difference. Your father only started merging with primal chaos qi in the Divine Flame realm and has not yet truly rooted himself into the ten thousand Daos. But even without condensing a primal chaos manifestation, he is already so powerful. Now you can imagine just how powerful those lifeforms behind that gate are.” The dragon expert’s voice rang out in Long Chen’s mind.

Long Chen nodded. “I admit that they’re powerful. But I refuse to believe that they’re stronger than my father. My father is a true peerless genius.”

“I have to admit, your father and your grandfather are both quite the characters. They possess both great intellect and endurance. Following one path to the end leads to mastery of all paths. Using the ten thousand Daos to view heaven and earth, they have long since planned out their future paths and are fully confident. As for you, I’m curious, just how did you end up with such a hot temper? Your father was able to endure for so many years just for this one chance. His resilience is absolutely astonishing, but you didn’t inherit a single bit of this from him. However, if you were to say that your character was inherited from your mother’s side, Your grandfather was also an individual who meticulously planned for many years to ensure the success of his life's goal. If you possessed even half the ability of your father or grandfather, or even just a tenth of it, your accomplishments would undoubtedly be even greater," the dragon expert remarked with a sigh.

Long Chen bitterly smiled. His grandfather and father were truly figures with long-reaching vision and great aspirations. He couldn’t compare to them.

If he was imprisoned, separated from his wife and child, and his brothers were killed, there would be no need for anyone to do anything else to him. He’d die from rage himself.

“Maybe my temper is from the Dragon Soul Body Forging Art.” Long Chen shrugged.

“Bastard, my dragon race’s characters are very amiable! As long as people don’t touch our reverse scales, we are very reasonable. Furthermore, my dragon race is the emperor of the ten thousand beasts. Our intelligence is the highest of all beasts, and we’re not at all inferior to the human race in that regard. As for you, the moment you get angry, you start acting like your brain was eaten by a dog! In that state, you do all kinds of idiotic things!” raged the dragon expert.

“Senior, is it time for me to start preparing for my tribulation? My father told me to undergo tribulation soon,” said Long Chen.

“There’s no rush just yet. The primal chaos qi in the Nirvana Overflow Heaven is still climbing, and the laws are still growing more complete. It isn’t the best time to undergo tribulation yet. Your father gave you a great gift, so you should slowly digest it. Once you manage to comprehend this gift, you will essentially master the Blood Condensation level. Previously, I was even pondering how to fully awaken your seven-color Supreme Blood, but your father already helped me out. After Blood Condensation, there is Tendon Transformation, Bone Forging, and Meridian Opening. Once your entire body is on the same level, you can undergo tribulation. After that, you can just borrow the power of the heavenly tribulation to fully merge your seven-color Supreme Blood, violet blood, dragon blood, Supreme Bone, and mutated Spirit Root. So, this upcoming tribulation is very important, and the difficulty is beyond your imagination. You have to be mentally prepared as well.” The dragon expert’s voice grew solemn here.

“Understood. But I am confident.” Long Chen clenched his fists.

After saving his father, Long Chen grew much more confident. He was unafraid of any difficulties.

When Long Chen returned to the academy, he saw Xia Chen drilling formations with the Dragonblood warriors. The return of so many Dragonblood warriors required new formation drills to make sure that everyone was on the same level.

Guo Ran, on the other hand, was diligently toiling away in seclusion. He had made a promise to the Dragonblood warriors to craft a complete set of battle armor and weapons for each of them, and he was committed to fulfilling that pledge.

Actually, the Dragonblood warriors had the Dragon Blood Battle Armor, so the armor part wasn't that urgent. However, suitable weapons had to be made for each of them.

Even so, Guo Ran was rather anxious. Having witnessed the might of Eternal divine weapons, he found his peak-grade World Domain divine items to be less appealing.

But for him to forge Eternal divine weapons? He lacked the necessary techniques, the power, and the materials for such an endeavor. He had been in seclusion for several days now, and no one knew what he was up to.

At this moment, Long Chen called over the Dragonblood warriors and distributed tens of thousands of Heavenly Dao Fruit among them. Each fruit bore three-colored markings, signifying that they were all Triple Supreme Heavenly Dao Fruits.

After all, Long Chen had killed so many Triple Supremes in the last battle that he had lost count. As a result, the Heavenly Dao Tree was covered in fruit, and there was a large pile at the foot of the tree.

There were tens of thousands of Triple Supreme Heavenly Dao Fruits, each displaying distinct colors and representing different kinds of talents. Thus, he let the Dragonblood warriors choose amongst them while emphasizing the importance of finding a fruit whose attributes aligned with their own talents and aptitudes.

Before the Sage King Convention, most of the original two thousand Dragonblood warriors were Double Supremes. As for the Dragonblood warriors who had been in the mirror world, a significant portion of them had yet to even achieve the Supreme level.

With so many Heavenly Dao Fruits to pick from, the Dragonblood warriors were incredibly excited. Long Chen shared in their enthusiasm, knowing that a Supreme Dragonblood Legion was about to rise.

After picking the best Heavenly Dao Fruits for themselves, the Dragonblood warriors went into seclusion. Even Xia Chen had chosen a Heavenly Dao Fruit with a shocking degree of affinity with him.

Given his expertise as a formation master, Xia Chen placed special emphasis on Spiritual Strength and soul energy. And to his astonishment, he stumbled upon a Heavenly Dao Fruit with energy fluctuations that left him dumbfounded. Without hesitation, he seized it.

Other than Gu Yang, Li Qi, Song Mingyuan, and Yue Zifeng, all the Dragonblood warriors found Heavenly Dao Fruits that matched them.

Long Chen then interrupted Guo Ran’s seclusion and found that this little fellow was busy drawing. However, these drawings weren’t runes for armor and weapons but maps.

With just a look, Long Chen knew that Guo Ran was studying the ore deposits in the Nirvana Overflow Heaven. This little fellow was planning on plundering forging materials.

“Hehe, boss, don’t misunderstand. I’m just calculating the reserves in these ore deposits, as well as how many materials we have. We need quite a few materials to fully equip the Dragonblood warriors, and I’m just seeing if we have enough money.” Guo Ran awkwardly chuckled upon being seen through by Long Chen.ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

“It’s alright, there’s no rush. Improving ourselves is the most important thing. The rest can be figured out later on.” Long Chen didn’t bother exposing Guo Ran and had him pick from the stock of Heavenly Dao Fruit. In an instant, this fellow’s eyes lit up, and he pounced on one Heavenly Dao Fruit in particular.

“What kind of energy is this?”

Long Chen eyed the strange marks on this Heavenly Dao Fruit and was dumbfounded. He couldn’t tell what attribute it was at all.

“I don’t know either, but my senses tell me that it has the highest affinity with me!” Guo Ran hugged the Heavenly Dao Fruit excitedly.

Long Chen nodded and didn’t say much more. He had Guo Ran go into seclusion and focus on absorbing the Heavenly Dao Fruit.

Just as Long Chen walked out, a disciple of the academy ran over with a report.

“Senior apprentice-brother Long Chen, someone is looking for you!”
