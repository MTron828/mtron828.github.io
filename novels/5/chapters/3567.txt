Chapter 3556

The people in the outside world were all stunned. They had come to watch the fun. After all, every time the Heavenly Flame World closed, there would be a fight between the various forces.

In the Heavenly Flame World, killing people for their treasures was a common occurrence. That planted the fuse for enmity.

Once the powers of the slain disciple learned of what had happened, they would come here to avenge their disciple.

If their power was a bit stronger than the other side, they would directly wipe out the other side. If they were equally powerful, they would just eliminate the disciples of the other side, avenging their disciple and winning back some face.

If the other side was too powerful and couldn’t be provoked, they would only be able to swallow this grievance, not even daring to let out a fart.

Every time the Heavenly Flame World closed, there would be some fights. But every time, the Heavenly Flame World was different, so the conflicts would vary as well.

They had thought that the closing this time around would definitely cause quite a few conflicts. Thus, people had long since found seats to watch from.

However, they hadn’t expected the gates to the world to directly crumble, and Long Chen to come charging out and slay Zhao Mingxuan.

That was the peak heavenly genius of the Raging Flame Heavenly Palace, the palace master’s personal disciple. He possessed immense power and limitless potential. However, such a heavenly genius had been slain by Long Chen. This scene was unbelievable.

Within the Dragon Blaze Prefecture’s ancient city, Feng Xiang’s father watched as space collapsed and countless experts came out. His gaze roved around the flood of people until he spotted Feng Xiang. He then sighed with relief.

Although he had expelled Feng Xiang from the family, it was for his own good. Feng Xiang was his child, so he couldn’t possibly not worry.

“Long Chen, you bastard, die!”

Just then, the elder of the Golden Crow race came charging over at Long Chen with a World Domain divine item in his hand.

The spectators were shocked to see how furious he appeared to be. He wasn’t holding back at all, and his eyes were full of killing intent.

“Could it be…”

Everyone’s gaze swept over the crowd. As expected, they didn’t see any sign of Wu Yang. Did that mean that…?

Some people who were well-informed about Long Chen’s enmity with Zhao Mingxuan and the others quickly scanned the flood of people with their divine sense. They were shocked to find that amongst that crowd of people, other than Feng Xiang, the others were all gone. A guess that they didn’t even dare to believe then appeared in their minds.

“Long Chen, return my apprentice’s life!” Another furious roar rang out and space shuddered. After that, an elder came charging out with raging killing intent.

“It’s the Raging Flame Heavenly Palace’s master!”

Countless experts came charging out from every direction. What shocked everyone was that they were all major forces. Essentially, all of them could be considered local overlords in this place.

Countless lifeforms of the Devil race, Blood race, Nether race, and others were also attacking Long Chen. All of them appeared completely infuriated.

“What did Long Chen do?!”

It could be said that many people knew Long Chen because his name was truly resounding. He was the number one academy’s youngest branch dean, a ruthless figure who dared to plunder the Soaring Dragon Company. Hence, countless people had been wondering whether or not Long Chen would survive being hunted by Zhao Mingxuan and the others in the Heavenly Flame World.

As a result, they personally witnessed Long Chen kill Zhao Mingxuan, and the various elders of the major powers were attacking him. Their jaws dropped.

“Scram! His life is mine!”

Just as countless people were attacking Long Chen, a roar came from within the ruins of the spatial gate. That voice made countless people's souls quiver.

BOOM!

When space exploded, a clump of raging flames charged out like a shooting star. As soon as it appeared, the flame energy of the world ignited.

Moreover, the flame star had yet to even arrive, but a violently surging flame energy already compressed the ten thousand Daos to the point that they wailed.

“Yan Xu Flame!”

Shocked cries rang out when they saw the black vapor coming from that blood-colored flame. They recognized this to be the strongest flame within the nine heavens and ten lands, and it was also the most evil flame, the Yan Xu Flame.

Many of the people here didn’t enter the Heavenly Flame World. But even amongst those that did, many didn't know about Yan Hong.

Now that Yan Hong appeared, he stunned everyone. They hadn’t expected the Heavenly Flame World this time to draw over the Yan Xu Flame.

At this moment, those experts charging at Long Chen came to a pause. Yan Hong’s attack had been brewing for a long time, and even they were covered by it.

However, in front of this full-power attack, Long Chen didn’t retreat in the slightest.

“Starry Sea Births Violet Qi, Draw Stars Into the Cosmos!”

Long Chen shouted and his star diagram quivered. All of a sudden, ninety-nine stars lit up together. In that instant, people couldn’t help looking up. It vaguely seemed as if there were other stars lighting up in the sky above the nine heavens. Even in the daytime, they could sense it.

“Heavens, senior Long Chen is using the Starry River of the Sky Art to draw in astral energy!” An emotional cry rang out.

This was a fellow cultivator of the Starry River of the Sky Art. He had previously listened to Long Chen discuss the Dao. Hence, he was reverent and worshipful toward Long Chen. Also, he hadn’t expected to see Long Chen here and personally witness him draw astral energy into his body.

The moment Long Chen activated this, ninety-nine stars amongst his 108,000 stars quivered intensely. Energy as vast as the sea then poured throughout his body.

This power was incomparably fierce. It was like a flood, but it didn’t belong to Long Chen. It was something that Long Chen had drawn from above the nine heavens using the Starry River of the Sky Art.

Also, this power could not be stored and could only be unleashed. If Long Chen tried to stop it, he himself would be blown apart. Up until now, this was the greatest amount of power that Long Chen had ever unleashed, a power that pushed him to his limits.

In the Heavenly Flame World, Long Chen was unable to sense the power of the stars. He couldn’t draw their power into his body. Now, he was no longer restricted in that regard. As this power coursed through his body, he slashed the Minghong Saber, striking first despite starting second.

The Minghong Saber’s violet qi gushed out and ninety-nine stars lit up. This was a saber that made the world change color, a saber that seemed like it would tear the world apart.

BOOM!

The saber slammed into the flame star. After that, the flame star crumbled, exposing a black spear that clashed with Long Chen’s saber. The collision caused a huge explosion. It felt like a celestial gong had been rung, shattering the ten thousand Daos. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

As a result, a ripple of death rapidly spread and devoured the dome of the heavens. It destroyed the land and caused heaven and earth to be devoid of their original color.

As that ripple of death spread, those experts charging at Long Chen hastily turned and fled. However, the World Kings that had been charging at him didn’t have time to dodge. They could only be devoured by that black ripple.
