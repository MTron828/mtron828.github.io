Chapter 2374 Treating People the Way They Treat Others

Translator: BornToBe

Long Chen and the others had only just returned to the eighth legion’s camp when Ye Lingfeng came charging over with his people.

“Long Chen, Shen Chengfeng, hand over our spoils or I will annihilate the eighth legion today!”

Ye Lingfeng’s roar resounded throughout heaven and earth. His voice was full of hatred and resentment. Through this one battle, they had lost so much, but had only gotten less than a tenth of the spoils.

Tens of thousands of experts from the third legion were now standing in the eighth legion’s camp. They were so angry it looked like they might spontaneously combust at any moment.

“Aiya, aren’t you that commander Ye? Why did you come over here so ferociously?” Long Chen walked out, looking at him like a kindly elder. The act almost made him laugh, but he managed to keep up his appearance.

“Why?! Hand over our things!” roared Ye Lingfeng.

Long Chen looked at him disdainfully. “Commander Ye, this time you’re wrong. We came rushing over to the third legion from such a great distance to help you, but instead of being grateful, you come here looking like you want to kill people? It truly makes a person’s heart cold.”

Some of the people beside Ye Lingfeng felt these words to be so familiar, but the eighth legion’s people all knew that this was how Ye Lingfeng had treated them before when taking their spoils.

“Bullsh*t! This was your scheme! Hand over the spoils right now!” demanded Ye Lingfeng, also noticing that imitation.

“Your spoils? Did they have your name on them?”

“You!”

“What you? Have you forgotten how arrogant and domineering you were when you took our spoils? Let me tell you, the demonic beasts that we killed have our arrows in them. That’s the proof. Whoever killed the prey gets it. Didn’t you say that last time? It’s your own crap, returned to you untouched, right?” sneered Long Chen.

Ye Lingfeng had taken the eighth legion’s spoils in a similar way, infuriating the warriors. Now the wheel had turned, and spitting back Ye Lingfeng’s words right at him was a cathartic release for Shen Chengfeng and the others.

“That’s completely different. You were the ones who drew the demonic beasts over to our side maliciously. Hmph, as long as this is reported to the Heaven Executioner, just a few searches through some souls will show the truth. Did you really think your scheme was seamless?” shouted Ye Lingfeng.

Shen Chengfeng’s expression changed slightly when the Heaven Executioner was mentioned. The Heaven Executioner was someone who handled big things in the divine families. If this matter ended up growing any bigger, it would be troublesome.

“The truth? Isn’t it already very clear? Our actions were all open and aboveboard. If you want to say something, then say it,” urged Long Chen.

“You…!” Ye Lingfeng switched targets. “Shen Chengfeng, Long Chen doesn’t care if you live or die. He can just leave whenever he wants. But as for you? Are you willing to throw your lives away?”

Shen Chengfeng put on a calm exterior, but he was a bit panicked inside. He didn’t have Long Chen’s guts. He had the entire eighth legion to consider.

This truly wasn’t a good thing. Quite a few people of the third legion had died. If this matter was further investigated, it wouldn’t be good.

Just as Shen Chengfeng was dwelling in his fear, Long Chen suddenly laughed. “Ye Lingfeng, playing this game with me is stupid. I can use my left foot to outthink you. You want to use the Heaven Executioner to suppress others? It doesn’t matter who you bring this up to. Yes, this was arranged by me, but I was arranging for the demonic beasts to be drawn over to our camp so that we could exterminate them. You suddenly charged into our plans, completely messing things up. You were the ones who drew the demonic beasts away. When you lost your camp, we clearly had no chance of victory, but we still took the risk to come save you. So tell me, just who is afraid of who? This entire battle plan was drawn up by me, and even commander Shen had to listen to my orders, let alone the other warriors. If I say something is black, then it’s black. If I want it to be white the next instant, then it’s automatically white. Who can say anything? So I’ll tell you what the truth is. This is the consequence of maliciously ruining our plans. If you have to blame anyone, blame yourself, understand?”

Hearing Long Chen put it this way, Shen Chengfeng and the others almost prostrated themselves before him. This whole thing had been set up by Long Chen, and it seemed that the only reason he hadn’t told them the plan was precisely to counter this play by Ye Lingfeng.

After thinking about it, this result was due to Ye Lingfeng charging into their battlefield. All the consequences would have to be borne by him.

As long as Long Chen didn’t admit he was intentionally conning him, no one could do anything about it. Now their backs straightened. So, he wished to tell the Heaven Executioner? Then go ahead, it was all his own fault anyway!

“You…” Ye Lingfeng was finally at a loss for words. This had truly started because he wanted to ruin the eighth legion’s plans and take their spoils.

Now he had been burned from touching the fire. No one would be able to blame Long Chen for this.

In other words, Long Chen hadn’t left them anything to use against him.

“I don’t care. Hand over our things or I’ll wipe you out right here and now!” barked Ye Lingfeng.

“If loud voices were what ruled things, donkeys would be in command of this world. You want to wipe us out? Then just try it. Let’s see if you have the guts,” sneered Long Chen contemptuously.

Ye Lingfeng ground his teeth to the point that they were about to splinter. He didn’t dare to attack.

Amongst the legions, friction was only natural, but open slaughter was absolutely not permitted. If he killed even one of them, he wouldn’t be escaping alive either.

“What are you glaring at me for? Shouldn’t you fuck off now? Are you waiting for us to treat you to a meal? Sorry, but we don’t have the money. We haven’t counted our spoils from the last battle, so you should scram.” Long Chen flapped his hand at Ye Lingfeng’s furious glare like shooing away a bug.

“Fine. Long Chen, Shen Chengfeng, just wait. My things aren’t so easy to take. I’ll make you regret this.”

Ye Lingfeng’s voice came from between the cracks in his teeth. He brought his people away.

Once he was gone, the eighth legion’s warriors erupted into cheers.

“Amazing, Ye Lingfeng looked like his dad had just died. I suddenly realized how blessed we are.”

“Fuck, we finally got to vent. I feel like my next bottleneck has even weakened. The feeling of revenge is about to burst out of my chest.”

“Senior apprentice-brother Long Chen actually conned Ye Lingfeng to this point.”

The eighth legion’s warriors were so excited that it couldn’t be described with words. They were still floating in the clouds.

The resentment that had been accumulating for years was finally released. That feeling wasn’t something an outsider could understand.

“Brother Long, I really admire you. This scheming is something I’ll never be able to learn,” praised Shen Chengfeng.

Long Chen shook his head. “This little trick is practically shameful. If it was taken out in the secular world’s empires, people would laugh at you for trying such things. But it’s enough for Ye Lingfeng. A higher level scheme might not even work on that idiot.”

“Long Chen, aren’t you saying that we’re also idiots?” Shen Chengfeng bitterly smiled.

“You were born in the cultivation world and live off of martial power, so you don’t need schemes. But I was born in the secular world in a noble family that was about to be crushed. I grew experienced with these schemes from a young age. In the secular world, individual power doesn’t vary much. When two people are equally powerful, then schemes can show their usefulness. But in your world, it’s a joke, because as long as you can crush your opponents with power, no scheme will make up for it. Tell me, if I was in the Xiantian realm and possessed unparalleled intelligence, do you think I could beat you?”

“No, that would be impossible.” 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“Exactly. Just remember that fish and bears have different skills, and you can’t have both. If you waste your time scheming, your cultivation speed will definitely be slowed. For me, playing these kinds of games is just for some occasional fun. Don’t fall for it,” warned Long Chen.

Shen Chengfeng’s heart shook, and he hastily said, “I understand.”

“Good. Has everything been counted up yet?”

“We have enough to reclaim our first defensive line. Just half our points should be enough for that. We also have enough to reward the warriors and equip them better.” Shen Chengfeng’s eyes shone with excitement.

“Why would taking back your territory require points?” asked Long Chen.

“Hm? I don’t understand. If we don’t use the points for various besieging apparatus, how are we supposed to take back our camp?”

“Isn’t there still Ye Lingfeng and the others?”

“What?”
