“Hong Yaoyang? Haha, so a bastard like you has fallen into such a state.”

With the Demon Moon Furnace floating above the sea of flames, Mo Nian came out and laughed at Hong Yaoyang.

Hong Yaoyang was pale, and the divine light coming out of him was showing signs of fading. It seemed that he had also reached his limit.

“Bastard, you dare to steal my inheritance?!” raged Hong Yaoyang.

“What do you mean, steal? I took it. At best, you can consider it plundering. Hehe, little brat, you chased me down for so long. What’s wrong with me taking a little bit back? Don’t like it? Bite me.” Mo Nian laughed. Seeing Hong Yaoyang’s current plight made him want to dance in excitement.

“Alright, stop messing around. We don’t have much time left. Once the karmic hell flames retreat, even if that fellow’s exhausted, he can kill us with a single attack.” Long Chen pulled Mo Nian away. It seemed that he had forgotten their current situation and simply wanted to enrage Hong Yaoyang to death.

“Fine. We got our revenge and some treasures. We can go. There’s nothing to stay for. The only regret I have is that I didn’t get to slap him as well. Ah, it’s so regretful. How about I go and try it right now?” asked Mo Nian unwillingly.

Hong Yaoyang coughed up a mouthful of blood. The multicolored blood faded into the air in a wave of divine power.

“Damn, what a pretty sight. Brother, I’ll give you money if you show me that again. As a hick, I have never seen such a sight!” exclaimed Mo Nian.

“You…!” Hong Yaoyang clamped his mouth shut. Blood leaked out.

“If you have to, just cough it out. Holding it in must be painful. Furthermore, if you just hold it, it won’t go anywhere. Well, if you don’t want it to go out from the top, you can let it go out from the bottom. But if you pull down your pants, it won’t be as nice of a sight,” sighed Mo Nian.

Hong Yaoyang didn’t reply. When Mo Nian was about to continue antagonizing him, Long Chen stopped him. “He cut off his divine sense. He can’t hear you. Let’s go.”

“Fine. Although I didn’t get to piss him to death, I’ve gained enough, hehe,” chortled Mo Nian. Suddenly, he saw that Long Chen was sending the Demon Moon Furnace to the direction of the palace. “Hey, where are you going?”

“It was so hard for us to come here. How can we not take a little bit back before leaving? This door bolt is a treasure.” Long Chen pointed to a certain set of gates in the palace.

“You can’t be serious.”

Mo Nian looked at those gates. His face twitched. They were so tall that he couldn’t see the top of them.

The two doors had a notch between them with a giant door bolt keeping them closed.

The doot bolt was pitch black and emitted a hair-raising aura. Even without Long Chen saying anything, Mo Nian knew that it was a treasure. But no matter how big his guts were, there was no way he would dare to do such a thing.

“Is this even possible?” demanded Mo Nian.

“It’s fine. I’ve done a similar thing twice. This time, we’ll even have the protection of the karmic hell flames,” said Long Chen, completely relaxed.

“Bastards, what are you doing?!” demanded Hong Yaoyang, his expression changing.

“We’re going to leave, but you’re pretty rude not to send us off with a gift. So we’ll be taking one ourselves.” Long Chen and Mo Nian arrived at the gates.

There was a strange force around the gates that prevented the karmic hell flames from approaching. Long Chen and Mo Nian no longer needed to block them.

Looking at the giant door bolt, Mo Nian felt a fire light up within him. He had no idea what material it was made of, but the energy it gave off was incredibly evil. He wondered if the Heaven Swallowing Sun Hunting Bow could absorb it.

Mo Nian tried to lift the bolt, but even with his full power, he wasn’t able to budge it. “Damn, it’s too heavy.”

On the other side of the bolt, Long Chen also lifted with his full power. As a result, the door bolt did quiver slightly. However, that was all. He was far away from lifting it.

“It’s no good. We can’t lift it,” said Mo Nian.

“We can. Come over here. We’ll lift from the same direction and make the bolt lose its balance and fall off,” said Long Chen.

Mo Nian flew over. Long Chen took a deep breath and summoned the Azure Dragon Battle Armor. Mo Nian also used his full power.

Slowly, the door bolt began to rise. Rumbling sounds rang out.

“Stop! Those are the Holders of Evil! If the gates are opened… you’ll be instantly killed!” shouted Hong Yaoyang. This slight distraction caused the palace to quiver, and the karmic hell flames got even closer, causing him to jump and return his focus on them.

“What are the Holders of Evil? They look pretty evil themselves,” asked Mo Nian spiritually. He didn’t have the energy to open his mouth.

“It has nothing to do with us. Work hard. The karmic hell flames are getting weaker. They’ll probably vanish in a little bit,” replied Long Chen as he lifted.

“Stop!” roared Hong Yaoyang.

Long Chen ignored him. The door bolt slowly began to slide off.

Hong Yaoyang was roaring, but Long Chen chose to ignore him. Eventually, after sliding off a certain extent, the doot bolt fell.

“Now!” Long Chen flew after it and grabbed a corner. Space twisted and the door knocker vanished, reappearing in Mo Nian’s astral space.

BOOM! The door bolt landed on the ground and a wave of earth exploded. Cracks filled his astral space. Mo Nian cried out. “Are you trying to kill me?!”

His entire astral space was cracked. It was just one step from exploding. Mo Nian was drenched in sweat.

Just at that moment, the doors rumbled and a sinister air came out of the crack in the doors. A terrifying sensation of death filled Long Chen and Mo Nian.

“Run!”

Without hesitation, the two of them hid within the Demon Moon Furnace. A burst of mysterious energy exploded out of the gates. Following that, black qi gushed out, filling this world.

Even the karmic hell flames were blasted away by that black qi. The impact caused them to retreat back into Purgatory.

“It’s over. This Netherworld is done for.”

Seeing the black qi invading this world, Hong Yaoyang’s expression was one of hatred and despair.

Long Chen and Mo Nian had vanished, and he was just foolishly staring at the open gates. He suddenly roared, “Long Chen and that other bastard, just wait! I will definitely find you!”

Following that, the palace split apart in the middle. Hong Yaoyang grabbed the upper half and flew away, vanishing across the horizon.

It wasn’t long after he left that the black qi filled the entire Netherworld. Countless dark creatures came out of the gates. They roared, their voices full of resentment…

…

Within the Mo family’s ancestral land, the family head, Mo Yi, and Liu Zongying were silently standing there like statues. Every blink of an eye felt as long as a year.

Long Chen’s lifeforce had faded away, but there was still the slightest aura of his spirit. However, those spiritual fluctuations would occasionally fade, making their hearts clench. They didn’t even dare to take a deep breath. They were waiting for a miracle.

It had been seven days, but there were so signs of either of them waking up.

Suddenly, Long Chen’s body twitched. He began to breathe, delighting them.

Liu Zongying cried out, “Long Chen, you’re awake! Mo Nian… is he…?”

Long Chen had been planning on teasing her a bit, but seeing how nervous she was, he decided against it. “Don’t worry, he’s fine. You can sense that his soul is back.”

At this moment, they realized that Mo Nian was no longer dead. However, he was still unconscious. Liu Zongying immediately grabbed Mo Nian and wept tears of joy. Even Mo Yi’s eyes grew wet.

“Long Chen, what’s wrong with Mo Nian? Why isn’t he awake?” asked Mo Yi.

“Ah…” Long Chen was embarrassed. It was because Mo Nian was focused entirely on repairing his astral space after the door knocker had damaged it. If it wasn’t repaired quickly, there was a chance it could shatter. He would only wake up once his astral space had recovered from that crisis. It was Long Chen’s miscalculation, so he didn’t know how to explain it.

Just at that moment, alarms began to blare from above. Mo Yi and the family head’s expressions changed.

“Enemy attack!”
