Chapter 2627 Sneaking into Devil Spirit Mountain

Guo Ran laughed and gave the order to retreat. After that, Liu Ruyan’s branches stretched out, grabbing the devil ape’s corpse.

Right now, Feng Fei stared in amazement. Although she had personally seen this scene, she still found it difficult to believe.

“Wilde, put away the corpse. You can eat it later.” Tang Wan-er couldn’t help speaking out. The sight and sound of the giant corpse being eaten was extremely off-putting. Although Wilde was a pure-hearted child who ate to cultivate, watching him tear into that corpse in such a bloody fashion was something they couldn’t get used to despite years of seeing it.

After that, Wilde mumbled something through a mouthful and came out of its body. However, his body was soaked in black blood, and the only part of him that was still white was his eyes. Seeing him like this, the divine families’ disciples recoiled in fear.

Being stared at by Wilde was like being stared at by a monster. They felt like they would be eaten as well.

As for the Devil Spirit Mountain’s side, it was in chaos. The death of the ape caused furious roars, but they didn’t dare to charge out. It seemed like their top experts had left, either scared off or going to report the news.

“Return our king!”

The devil experts inside Devil Spirit Mountain roared at Long Chen and the others. They were those who had come with the devil ape. However, they weren’t apes. Some of them had wings, some had horns, some had two heads and four arms, and even more.

“Their king? What does that mean?” asked Guo Ran.

“The devil race is enormous and has many sub-races within. Moreover, those sub-races have branches, and those branches are split into many tribes. As far as I know, a tribe is the smallest subdivision and can be considered to be the equivalent of a sect on the Martial Heaven Continent. It seems like this devil ape could be considered their sect leader,” said Feng Fei.

The current Feng Fei was no longer as arrogant as before. The Dragonblood Legion had actually killed a mid Heaven Merging expert, and that was an astonishing achievement.

Before this, she had always thought that without Long Chen, the Dragonblood Legion was nothing more than ants. However, now that she had witnessed their true power, she couldn’t compare it to when they had been in the Star Field Divine World.

Guo Ran cupped his fists. “Many thanks for lady Feng Fei’s explanation. Also, many thanks for your warning. I’m not too good with words, so I hope you won’t take offense from this. But if the rest of the divine families could be like you, I feel like our collaboration will go a bit smoother.”

Feng Fei’s arrogance might be annoying, but that warning she had given showed that she cared about the big picture before her personal grievances. Just that bit of act proved that she wasn’t a spoiled rotten child.

Regretfully, it seemed that her position was the lowest amongst the four Sovereign sprouts. Ye Liangchen and Jiang Wuchen were truly detestable in comparison.

As for Long Aotian, although he hadn’t expressed any hostile intention toward the Dragonblood Legion, his icy arrogance made them feel uncomfortable. Being unable to see through him, they felt somewhat uneasy.

Although Feng Fei was a bit foolish and somewhat princess-like, in comparison, she was easier to get along with. That was why Guo Ran said those words just now.

Feng Fei indifferently said, “Is that supposed to be praise?”

“It can’t count as one. I am simply stating facts. After all, we are joining forces against our enemies, the invaders from other words. So we should be united against them, don’t you think?” Guo Ran smiled.

Feng Fei remained silent but Guo Ran didn’t mind. Feng Fei couldn’t be the ruler of the divine families, nor was she able to control the other Sovereign sprouts.

“Why did you suddenly launch an attack without saying anything?” At this moment, Ye Lingshan finally demanded an explanation.

“Senior apprentice-sister Lingshan, this is due to boss’s edicts,” said Guo Ran hastily.

“Edicts?”

Ye Lingshan was speechless? Why hadn’t he said orders instead of some nonsense like edicts? Had Long Chen claimed himself to be a god or emperor at some point? Guo Ran was always exaggerating things.

“Then why didn’t Long Chen come?” asked Ye Lingshan.

“Due to the loss that we suffered yesterday, we went to talk to boss. Boss was still in seclusion and unable to come out, but when we explained what happened, he cursed us for holding grudges. The Dragonblood Legion never holds grudges. Who has the time to hold grudges? So, he told us to hurry up and repay them an eye for an eye. If the Alldevil Heavenwalker came out, then he’d leave his seclusion and slaughter him. Otherwise, we could take matters into our own hands. See, this is the teleportation talisman we prepared. If I crush it, boss will immediately come. But we didn’t get a chance to use it,” said Guo Ran.

Meng Qi and the others concealed smiles. Guo Ran was truly more suited to acting. His eyes, his expression, and his movements were all natural. Even they almost believed it.

Hearing this, Feng Fei and Ye Lingshan nodded. No wonder the Dragonblood Legion dared to attack Devil Spirit Mountain. So they could summon Long Chen at any time.

“How curious. Why is that Alldevil Heavenwalker now cowering like a tortoise? I wanted boss to kill him.” Guo Ran frowned.

He truly was unwilling. If the Alldevil Heavenwalker had come, then with the Dragonblood Legion’s full power, Long Chen would have a high chance of killing him.

The Alldevil Heavenwalker had defeated Ye Liangchen and Jiang Wuchen. If Long Chen then killed him, that would be incredibly good news for the Martial Heaven Continent. Their morale would reach unprecedented heights.

“What about the experts of the original devil race? Why didn’t they come?” asked Feng Fei.

Not even Yue Xiaoqian had come. If she was here, they would have had it even easier.

She didn’t know that the reason Yue Xiaoqian hadn’t come was because Long Chen didn’t want her aura rubbing off on him. Due to their close relationship, once Yue Xiaoqian activated her Devil Suppressing Divine Seal, it might cause a slight reaction in Long Chen’s body. Considering how sensitive the devil race was to this aura, Long Chen might be easily exposed.

“Boss said that this was a chance for the Dragonblood Legion to show our power. This way, we told the devil race that even without the original devil race, they are nothing more than crops to be harvested…” said Guo Ran.

Just as Guo Ran was bragging, Long Chen and Dong Mingyu had covered themselves in the hide of a devil expert and followed their army back into the depths of Devil Spirit Mountain.Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m
