Chapter 3445 Dog-Headed Generals

“One is the devil sea, and the second one is the devils from outside the immortal world. The last one is the Undying race’s Devil Eye Water Lilies,” said Bai Letian.

“The Undying race has also come?” Long Chen was startled. He really did feel a bit of worry when it came to this race. They were truly difficult to deal with.

“Yes. Thus, Zhantang and the others have gone to reinforce the seventh branch academy. Their real goal is that side,” said Bai Letian.

After a moment’s hesitation, Long Chen couldn’t help asking, “Dean, I want to ask you. Was this done by Lord Brahma?”

Most things related to Lord Brahma were taboo in the academy. Everyone who knew about him kept it a secret, but Long Chen really couldn’t help asking. He felt that this was definitely done by Lord Brahma.

Bai Letian smiled. “It can be said that it was and it wasn’t.”

“What does that mean?”

“With Lord Brahma’s intellect, he wouldn’t make such a childish move. For them to be in such a rush to destroy the seventh branch academy, they have essentially revealed the powers that Lord Brahma controls. No matter what, Lord Brahma is from the immortal world. Even if some people do know some of the old secrets, they don’t mention them to others. On the surface, Lord Brahma appears to be a powerful overlord of the immortal world with absolute authority. He wouldn’t let others know that he can control the other forces.”

Long Chen came to a sudden understanding. “You mean to say that it was done by those dog-headed generals underneath Lord Brahma? In other words, they panicked once we took back the seventh branch academy, and they directly communicated with those powers without discussing it with Lord Brahma first?”

Bai Letian nodded. “Dog-headed generals is an appropriate description for them. Only fools would act so openly and directly. Lord Brahma and Fallen Daynight are in seclusion, so everything is done by their subordinates, disciples, and disciples of their disciples. Based on our understanding, there are only a few people with this kind of authority amongst Lord Brahma’s subordinates. A crafty old fellow like Enpuda is always meticulous. He likes to scheme things through without leaving any evidence of his actions, so this definitely wasn’t done by him. My personal guess is that it was done by the Nine Underworld Hall’s master, Liao Bencang. Although he is an assassin, he has an explosive temper, and his head isn’t that bright. He has always been at odds with Enpuda.

“Although Enpuda appears to be suppressed by him on the surface, with the difference in brains, there’s no way he can outplay Enpuda. Enpuda simply knows how to endure. Taking back the seventh branch academy caused them to panic. For such a major thing to occur while Lord Brahma is in seclusion, they wanted to quickly fix it. But once wood has been turned into a boat, it cannot be turned back. They are willing to pay any price to destroy the seventh branch academy before Lord Brahma comes out of seclusion. The mastermind is probably Liao Bencang, and if my guess is right, Enpuda will have argued with him and then lost the argument on purpose. That way, if Liao Bencang does succeed, nothing bad will happen to Enpuda. And if Liao Bencang fails, he will have a way to escape his sins.”

Long Chen nodded. Enpuda was truly a schemer, and such a forceful play was unlike him. This must have been done by Liao Bencang. However, who would have thought that a person with such a foolish head would be an assassin under Lord Brahma? Was there no one else he could find?

Furthermore, based on Bai Letian’s tone, he didn’t particularly care about Enpuda and the others’ attack.

“Dean, what is their goal in this battle? It is meaningless, no?” asked Long Chen. Even after gathering three major powers, they were unable to break the academy’s barrier. Then what was the point?

Bai Letian smiled slightly. “Attrition.”UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

Long Chen instantly understood. It seemed that they were playing just who had more ammo. They were competing in terms of manpower, physical resources, and financial power.

This kind of attrition might not have any effect for one or two months. But what about after three or five years? Or thirty or fifty years?

The High Firmament Academy was said to have declined, so they definitely couldn’t beat Lord Brahma in terms of manpower, physical resources, or financial power. Although this was a simple play, it was quite effective. It was just that they had neglected to consider one aspect.

That was that whether it was the devil crystals of the devils, the demonic cores of the sea demons, or the corpses of the Devil Eye Water Lilies, they were all very valuable.

After they were killed, their corpses could be traded for immense wealth. If the fighters were strong enough and kept the casualties within a certain range, they would actually profit.

Furthermore, they were backed by Zheng Wenlong. These demonic cores, devil crystals, and so on could be rapidly sold and turned into useful materials. They wanted to compete in a battle of attrition? Then they could compete to their heart’s content.

Seeing that disdainful smile, Bai Letian also smiled. “It seems that you are already prepared.”

“Hehe, it can’t count as preparations. I’ve just made some small fortune during this time, and it should be able to help with our current predicament,” said Long Chen.

Only then did Bai Letian have a chance to ask Long Chen about what had happened after he fell for Enpuda’s scheme.

Long Chen told the dean a bit about how he had entered the Netherworld. After breaking through the void, he appeared in the Integral Heaven Star-Field, coincidentally running into the opening of their Divine Lord Immortal Realm. He didn’t bother concealing anything about the Integral Heaven Star-Field.

Hearing all this, Bai Letian was stunned, but he also found it comical. “You turned a disaster into a blessing. Even the protector spirit of the Integral Heaven Star-Field has helped you. Since you’ve gained so much wealth, I won’t be so courteous with you. In the future, the expenses of your seventh branch academy will have to be paid by yourself.”

Originally, with the seventh branch academy under siege, the main academy was paying close to a thousand immortal king crystals every day just to maintain the barrier. As for the medicinal pills, damaged weapons, and other fees, they were all paid by the battle.

Since Long Chen had money, Bai Letian was quite direct. He could pay for himself.

Long Chen laughed. Now he understood what it meant for riches to lead to domineeringness. With money, he could stand tall.

“Dean, do you think it’s possible to draw out Lord Brahma’s subordinates and end them?” Long Chen made a throat-cutting gesture.

Bai Letian was startled and then laughed. “I know that your current power can challenge ordinary World Kings. But you don’t know the differences between World Kings. Let us not speak of the differences between early, mid, and late stage World Kings. The likes of Enpuda and Liao Bencang have countless believers, so they have an enormous amount of faith energy. World Kings like them have power that exceeds your imagination. Do not compare them to the World Kings of the demonic beast races.”

Although Long Chen also knew that Enpuda wasn’t an ordinary World King, he hadn’t expected Bai Letian to give him such a response. His heart then turned a bit cold.

However, he forced out a smile. “I can’t, but what about the academy? You definitely have the power to kill them, no?”

“Hehe.”

Bai Letian simply laughed and didn’t reply. Long Chen knew that this old fellow wouldn’t tell him the truth. The academy had truly hidden itself deeply.

The Heaven, Earth, Wind, and Lightning Elders were extremely terrifying. The Divine Lightning Elder was ranked last amongst them, so the other three must be even more terrifying. But if the dean refused to tell him, Long Chen could only let it be.

In the end, when Long Chen prepared to return to the seventh branch academy, Bai Letian warned him, “If you have the ability, then go ahead and show it. As long as you don’t randomly run around, the academy will definitely protect you.”

Hearing that, Long Chen was at ease. He excitedly stepped on the transportation formation.
