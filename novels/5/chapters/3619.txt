Chapter 3608

Just as everyone was cheering, the void shuddered and countless battleships came out from every direction, causing everyone to jump.

“Clear Rain City, don’t be alarmed! We came to help you!”

A voice rang out. At this moment, thousands of battleships were whistling over, floating above Clear Rain City. After that, people began walking out of them.

“Old city lord, my apologies. My Luoli City came late.”

“Our Heavenly River Sect immediately gathered our troops and moved out when we received the signal. I didn’t expect to still be one step too late.”

“Fortunately, the heavens have protected Clear Rain City. Otherwise, not even ten thousand deaths would let me rest in peace.”

All these elders apologized to the city lord with ashamed expressions. They were all late stage World Kings, the leaders of the various powers.

“What are you staring at? Are you blind? We didn’t make it in time to kill the enemies, so hurry up and help clean up the battlefield!” barked one of the elders at a disciple behind him.

The expressions of the Heavenly Dragon Divine Armor College’s disciples changed when they heard that. These people couldn’t be seen during the fight, but they came now to take the spoils of war?

If they were allowed to go through the battlefield, who knew how many treasures would end up falling into their pockets?

“Scram. Anyone who dares to touch anything on this battlefield better not blame my saber for being merciless,” said Long Chen coldly.

“Who are you? How brazen!” shouted one elder darkly.

The city lord hastily made introductions. “Sect master He, this is Long Chen. He-”

“Who I am isn’t important. What is important is that I’m not as shameless as you lot. You were hiding in the dark during the battle and only pretended to be late once the battle was won. Could it be that your life’s cultivation base was spent on tempering this thick face of yours? Scram back to wherever you came from,” said Long Chen coldly once more.

Just who was Long Chen? He had experienced and seen these kinds of people often. These old fellows had shamelessly come to take advantage of them.

“Little fellow, you’re quite brazen! You dare to be so rude to sect master He-” A disciple behind that elder angrily pointed and cursed at Long Chen.

Long Chen also pointed at him and a lightning arrow pierced the disciple’s head. He didn’t even make a sound as he collapsed, dead.

“You…!” The elders were all shocked and enraged that Long Chen would kill this disciple.

“Shut your mouths. Scram! This place does not welcome you!” shouted Long Chen.

“You… your Heavenly Dragon Divine Armor College is talking big, huh? Do you think that you can fight the entire Alldevil race by yourselves?!”

“Exactly! You want us to scram? Fine, then we’re leaving! We’ll wait for the day that you kneel and beg for our aid!”

Several experts roared furiously at Long Chen. They were all major figures within their own sects, people with face and status. Long Chen was insulting them by telling them to scram.

In truth, when these people received the distress signal from Clear Rain City, they became cautious. They then stealthily slipped over to the outskirts and hid themselves.

They were waiting for others to make the first move and wanted to see the situation first. If the situation took a turn for the worse, they would silently leave as if they hadn’t come in the first place. They would only appear once their side had the advantage.

Sending charcoal in the snow? Impossible. But being decorations on something that was already perfect to get some benefits was their specialty.

According to the unwritten rules of the Alldevil Star-Field, as long as someone came to help, they would get a part of the battle spoils on the battlefield. But Long Chen didn’t care about those rules. He directly exposed their true motive, humiliating them and enraging them.

“Kill him!” said Long Chen coldly.

At some point, a refined crossbow appeared in Guo Ran’s hand. An arrow then shot out, killing that elder instantly.

“What?!”

These elders were all shocked. Seeing this scene, all the experts from that elder’s side summoned their battle armors. Their battleships rumbled as they entered combat state.

“If anyone dares to make a rash move, kill them all,” ordered Long Chen.

The Heavenly Dragon Divine Armor College’s battleships also turned toward them, and the battle armors on the warriors shone brightly once more. They stood behind Long Chen, their killing intent still raging.

The Heavenly Dragon Divine Armor College’s disciples had just experienced a major victory, so their morale was still high and their killing intent had yet to be quenched. Just the sight of them terrified these elders.

Just now, Long Chen had destroyed the famous Qingying Battleship in one blow, reversing the tides and obtaining a grand victory. As a result, the disciples of the Heavenly Dragon Divine Armor College now looked at Long Chen like he was a god.

A peerless expert was always an idol with countless worshippers. In this world where experts were revered, they possessed boundless charisma. Thus, it didn't matter who the other side was. With this order from Long Chen, these disciples wouldn’t hesitate to kill them.

“Have you gone mad?! You’re going to start a slaughter between us?!” shouted one elder, quivering with rage.

“Mister Long Chen…” The city lord was also dumbfounded. They had just obtained a victory, but Long Chen suddenly wanted to cause an internal battle. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

Long Chen waved his hand, cutting off the city lord. After that, his gaze swept through the crowd. Looking at the leaders of these forces that were shocked and enraged, he snorted.

“Remember these words of mine. Starting today, the Heavenly Dragon Divine Armor College is leading this war. This is not a discussion. This is based on how we dared to stand up in the face of danger, that we dared to jump into a trap, that we placed Clear Rain City’s commoners’ lives as the number one priority despite the battlefield situation being unknown. Cowardly tortoises like yourselves that only watched secretly and waited to see which side to leap on have no input on anything. When there’s danger, you run. When there’s profit, you surround it like hyenas. You have the face to demand anything from me now?”

“Absolute nonsense! We were-”

“Shut up!”

Long Chen roared. It was like thunder splitting heaven and earth, shaking the world. His voice contained a supreme will that could not be disobeyed.

As a result, everyone’s ears were shaken by this roar, and their souls quivered. They had never experienced such a terrifying will. They then stared at Long Chen in horror.

Long Chen pointed at those elders and icily said, “If you dare to swear on your ancestral heroic spirits that you didn’t do this, then I’ll take it back. If any one of you dares to swear such a thing, come out. If I wrongly accused you, I, Long Chen, will cut off my own head right now as an apology.”

Long Chen's voice surged through the battlefield like thunder. It was overflowing with righteousness, and these elders were speechless under this pressure.

No one dared to swear by their ancestral heroic spirits. Lying in that situation would definitely cause a Heavenly Dao backlash. Furthermore, it wouldn’t just be a backlash on them but also on all their descendants. In that case, their entire family might be thrown into danger.

Seeing them remain silent, the Heavenly Dragon Divine Armor College’s disciples looked at them scornfully. Long Chen tore off their lies, and it was truly satisfying. Following Long Chen, they felt an arrogant pride as if they were heroes looking down on the rest of the world.

“Let’s go.”

This group of people ultimately left with a gloomy expression.

“The offensive troops are in charge of cleaning up the battlefield. You must finish within two hours. Defensive troops, set up the transportation formation. All the commoners of Clear Rain City are to be brought back to the Heavenly Dragon Domain and found proper arrangements.”

As soon as Long Chen gave his orders, everyone got to work. The Heavenly Dragon Divine Armor College’s disciples all worked hard.

In just a short six hours, the battlefield was cleaned up, and the commoners were all sent away. When Long Chen and the others returned to the Heavenly Dragon Divine Armor College in the battleships, they were met with tens of thousands of uninvited guests.
