Chapter 4413 The Nether Dragon Race’s Fury

“Courting death!”

A thunderous roar echoed, causing a world somewhere to tremble in response. An entire palace directly disintegrated into nothingness.

An elder had been sitting inside this palace. Beyond its walls stretched an infinite mountain range saturated with black qi. At this moment, in countless gorges and ravines, pairs of colossal eyes snapped open.

They were all giant dragons concealed in the darkness, originally cultivating but were roused by this resounding roar.

One giant dragon after another flew toward the elder from every direction. They completely blocked the sun, giving off an enormous and heavy feeling.

“Race leader, what happened?”

The giant dragons were all Eternal experts. Most importantly, their auras were dozens of times stronger than those of ordinary Eternal experts.

“Damn bastard! A human brat killed my son, Tianye!” roared that elder.

“What?!” The giant dragons were shocked and enraged.

“How could this be? Young master Tianye bears your personal spiritual seal. When he is on the brink of death, it should activate automatically. The power of that seal is definitely on par with half of your full-power attack! Not to mention a little human brat, even a Saint of the human race might not be able to block it!”

“That human race brat possesses the true dragon race’s divine abilities and has a certain level of understanding over our nether dragon race. He actually managed to rip off Tianye’s reverse scale without triggering its senses, making it impossible for me to unleash an attack! Absolutely hateful! The human race must pay the price for their foolishness! Gather everyone. We will completely trample his sect and everyone in his family!” roared the race leader.

“Race leader, please calm yourself for now. We naturally must get revenge for young master Tianye. However, we have to learn the background of his killer first,” said one of the Eternal experts.

“Fuck, why would I care about that?! I want to destroy his sect, his entire race! They will all accompany my son in death!”

“Race leader, please don’t misunderstand. When has our nether dragon race ever been afraid of anyone? If they dared to kill young master, we must make them pay the blood debt. I’m simply saying that we have to investigate first to make sure that we include all sects related to him, including his friends and family. We must kill them all. Before moving, we must learn all their positions and come up with a battle plan first. If we were to just wipe out his sect, some people would be able to escape. If that were to happen, hunting them down would be like searching for needles in a haystack,” explained that Eternal expert.

Finally, the race leader’s furious expression softened slightly. He nodded. “You really are the calmest one among us. You are right. We can’t let any of them escape. Doesn’t the human race have something called ‘nine familial exterminations?’ Hmph, I’ll kill everyone even remotely connected to him. Inferior humans dare to kill a genius of my esteemed nether dragon race? I'll make them understand the meaning of fear!”

“Greetings, respected race leader.”

In a short moment, two human elders in black robes with a dragon head emblem on their chests walked in and bowed deeply to the race leader.

They were guests of the nether dragon race, or more bluntly put, dogs in charge of managing things in the Darklight Heaven for them.

Given that the nether dragon race's Saint wouldn't risk departing this world lightly, they relied on humans to gather information and handle matters outside their world. Because of this, countless humans had knelt before them, pleading for the opportunity to be their liaison.

As for these two elders, their cultivation bases had reached the Eternal realm, and they were truly skilled at adapting to circumstances and fawning. Hence, they managed to obtain the dragon race’s favor, which allowed them to become dogs clad in dragonhide.

“Tell me, who is this brat called Boss Long San?” demanded the race leader.

“Boss Long San? This little one has never heard of such a person,” responded one of the elders in confusion.

“You don’t even know him!? Then what use do I have for you?!” roared the race leader. He then sent a single claw cutting through space.

That elder didn’t even have a chance to resist before exploding. His blood soaked the other elder beside him.

Trembling with terror, the surviving elder realized the ruthlessness of the nether dragon race. They were too brutal, killing people at the drop of a needle. Despite their complete loyalty to the nether dragon race, death could arrive for them at any moment.

“Tell me, do you know some youngster in the human race called Boss Long San? Don’t tell me you don’t know either!” The race leader glared at the surviving elder with a grim expression.

That elder’s soul almost fled in fright. He knew that if he couldn’t answer, he would be accompanying his comrade in hell.

“Boss Long San, Boss Long San… A youngster…” the elder murmured.

The race leader grew impatient and suddenly waved his hand. Seeing this, the elder jumped in fright and cried out, “I know, I know who he is!”

“Speak! Who is it?!”

“He… he is… a very outstanding youngster…” In truth, this elder had not thought of who Boss Long San was and was simply stalling for his life.

“You dare to lie to this Saint?! You must want to die!” The race leader’s hand reached for the elder’s neck.

“I know! He’s Long Chen!” shouted that elder in terror.

Just then, the race leader’s claw stopped, just a bit away from crushing the elder into a patty.

“Bastard, he called himself Boss Long San! You dare to lie to me?”

“No, no!” The elder waved his hand, but he kept stumbling over his words in panic. “Boss Long San is his nickname! His real name is Long Chen! I guarantee it! I swear on my head!”L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

He was already covered in sweat. In truth, he didn’t even know Long Chen. When Long Chen grew famous in the Darklight Heaven, this elder was still sealed away.

Fortunately, after he joined the nether dragon race, in order to be a better dog, he started to gather information on the Darklight Heaven in recent years. Perhaps this was another case of knowledge being able to change one’s fate.

“What family does he hail from? What sect?” asked the race leader.

“He’s an ascender from the lower world. He has no family. However, he does belong to a sect!” answered the elder hastily.

“What sect?”

“The High Firmament Academy!”

Upon hearing this response, these experts of the nether dragon race instantly fell silent.
