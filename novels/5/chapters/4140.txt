Chapter 4129: Cursing People is Wrong

Watching the crowd leave with disgusted expressions on their faces, Yu Qingxuan couldn’t help but laugh. This fellow Long Chen really was amazing. Now, no one would believe that he had the Heaven Earth Cauldron.

Originally, they had been worried that they would be targeted due to possessing the Heaven Earth Cauldron, causing their progress to be slow. But Long Chen had resolved it in one move.

Looking at the people’s enraged expressions as they turned away from Long Chen, she was sure that Long Chen had another identity: a master actor.

As for the large fellow who had been killed by the Dragonblood warrior, his corpse was brought away. The city guards had long since grown indifferent to such things. As long as no one damaged the city, they essentially didn’t care.

Furthermore, by taking away that person’s corpse, they could gain quite some money. That person’s weapons, armor, and spatial ring were so worthless to Long Chen and the others that they couldn’t even bother, so those things ended up in the hands of the city guards.

It was unknown if it was because of this money, but the guards treated Long Chen and the others very respectfully. While everyone else scattered, they stayed behind to fawn over Long Chen.

In this place, the death of someone with no background was simply ignored. A person dying here was no different than an ant dying.

“Let me tell you guys, I really have the Heaven Earth Cauldron.” Seeing everyone else scatter, Long Chen turned to the guards seriously.

“Hehe, we totally believe you. We will believe anything you say,” said those guards solemnly.

“Alright, I can’t be bothered.” With such a response, Long Chen was in no mood to keep acting. He then followed everyone into the city.

As soon as they entered the city, he was met with many odd gazes, many of which seemed to contain disdain and disgust. After all, people had labeled him as a scammer.

That was precisely what Long Chen wanted; only then would he get a few peaceful days.

Long Chen and the others continued trading for various treasures, exchanging the things that they didn’t need for treasures that they urgently needed. Like this, they managed to profit immensely.

As they got closer to the core of the Sage King Star-Field, they saw more experts from various races. However, the atmosphere was much more tense here. Some of the more oppressive races did not even allow others into their city, so they created a border where they didn’t permit others inside.

Here, you could see Heaven Venerates anywhere accompanying their disciples, as they didn’t want any trouble to befall the latter.

As for Long Chen and his companions, when the others saw that he didn’t have a Heaven Venerate guarding him, quite a few forces provoked him. As a result, Long Chen didn’t care who or why they did it; all those people had their heads broken and their blood spilled. If they dared to raise weapons on him, they were directly slain.

After killing them, he would announce, “The primal chaos divine item, the Heaven Earth Cauldron, is in my hands. If anyone wants it, come discuss it with me at any time.”

The first few times people heard of the Heaven Earth Cauldron, they jumped in shock. However, after seeing Long Chen do it over and over again, they grew numb to it.

By intentionally announcing it, they thought that Long Chen’s intention was too obvious, and only a fool would fall for it. On the other hand, the Dragonblood warriors’ powerful auras and sharp attacks shocked quite a few people. A Heaven Venerate was even slain in three moves by two of the Dragonblood warriors.

As time passed, Long Chen’s background gradually became common knowledge. Just the fact that he was the High Firmament Academy’s youngest branch dean already shocked countless people. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

It was members of the senior generation who were shocked by that. In the junior generation, perhaps many people didn’t know of the High Firmament Academy, but all the seniors knew that it was an existence with a terrifying foundation.

Furthermore, his battle record was also revealed. The matter of him causing the deaths of Enpuda and Liao Bencang in the Vermilion Bird Empire also stunned everyone. Although the two of them didn’t really die at Long Chen’s hands, that was what the rumors were, and countless experts of the senior generation refused to believe in such a thing.

It had to be known that Liao Bencang and Enpuda had their believers spread throughout the nine heavens and ten lands, and they were also Lord Brahma’s loyal subordinates. So for the two of them to be slain by Long Chen, most of the people didn’t dare to believe it.

Long Chen saw a trading center in the city, so without taking a second look, he walked over. “Hey, shopkeeper, do you have-”

“Scram, you goddamn bastard!” The shopkeeper was enraged to the point of shaking when he saw Long Chen.

“Soaring Dragon Company?”

Only when he saw the shopkeeper’s robes did he realize that he had walked into the Soaring Dragon Company.

“Cursing people is wrong. Brothers, get to work!”

The next moment, countless people screamed and cursed, while Long Chen and the others laughed and walked in. This trading outpost had been set up specifically for the Sage King Convention. But now, it was also plundered.

“They actually came to us. I’d feel bad if we didn’t accept their sincerity,” chortled Guo Ran.

“You goddamn bastards, you won’t have good deaths! Just wait, the Soaring Dragon Company won’t let you off! What are all of you people doing?! Long Chen has the primal chaos divine item, the Heaven Earth Cauldron! As long as you kill him, you’ll obtain a supreme treasure! Why aren’t you doing anything?!” After cursing Long Chen, the shopkeeper encouraged the crowd to attack him.

Quite a few spectators had gathered here because of the chaos, but hearing the shopkeeper’s words, they all rolled their eyes. Did he also think others were fools? Why would they be free fighters for the Soaring Dragon Company?

The Soaring Dragon Company’s people shouted and cursed like vixens on the street. But Long Chen and the others simply smiled, not getting angry at all.

Long Chen and the others' principle was to loot people without killing them, to be such transcendent bandits that they allowed themselves to be hit without hitting back, and to be cursed without cursing back. In any case, the treasures were in their hands, so being cursed a bit could be considered fair.

Perhaps the Soaring Dragon Company had also noticed this, which was why they dared to curse them so openly. Otherwise, considering that the strongest amongst them was only an Earth Venerate, they were completely unable to shake Long Chen and the others.

They originally didn’t have a branch here. But with the Sage King Convention starting, they had set up a temporary shop to make some money. However, after over two months of buying and selling valuable items, Long Chen and his group simply took everything from them, leaving them with nothing. This understandably left them very angry.

However, the Soaring Dragon Company’s reputation was truly lacking. Despite there being countless experts watching, not one person stepped forward to help them.

“Everyone, other than the Heaven Earth Cauldron, I also have some other treasures! If you have anything good to sell, perhaps we can do business. I don’t dare to say that I have too many items, but in any case, what the Soaring Dragon Company has, I also have!” declared Long Chen.

Hearing this, the Soaring Dragon Company’s people coughed up blood. He directly robbed the Soaring Dragon Company of all their treasures and then sold them like this? Was there any bully bigger than that?

The others also laughed when they heard this. This fellow really was quite domineering, directly plundering the Soaring Dragon Company. Was he not afraid of the Soaring Dragon Company’s reprisal in the future?

“Ignorant brat! Today, your retribution has come! Let’s settle our debts now!”

Suddenly, the void quivered and hundreds of experts wearing robes of the Soaring Dragon Company descended.

“An innate Heaven Venerate!”
