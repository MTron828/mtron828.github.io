Chapter 2631 Western Desert Ax

It was a giant ax covered in rust and bound by countless chains.

It seemed to be in slumber, and yet it still exuded a murderous aura that gave Long Chen chills.

It was a truly heaven-splitting ax. Just the head was miles long, and its handle had two curves that made it look like a dragon’s body. Long Chen felt like a speck of dust in front of it.

Long Chen’s heart pounded. This giant ax had caused the fragment of the Eastern Wasteland Bell to resonate, so the name of this ax was obvious. It was one of the five supreme divine items of the Martial Heaven Continent, the Western Desert Ax.

“Long Chen, come over here.”

Long Chen was deeply stunned by the giant ax, but a voice came from below, drawing him out of his stupor.

Long Chen swam down, and as expected, he saw the Heaven Splitting Divine Tablet. Although its body was also large like a mountain, it was also tiny compared to the Western Desert Ax.

“Senior, I found you. But… is this the Western Desert Ax?” asked Long Chen.

The Heaven Splitting Divine Tablet said, “Correct, the supreme divine item, the Western Desert Ax. The reason I didn’t directly leave after escaping my bindings is because I noticed it. I then snuck in, using my core energy to grind down one of its chains. As long as one of these chains is broken, the Western Desert Ax will be awoken from its slumber. Then it can leave as well. I’ve been bound in Devil Spirit Mountain for a long time, so I know just how terrifying their attack this time is. Hence, we must have the five supreme divine items to face this dark tribulation. Not even one can be missing.”

“Senior, what can I do to help?” asked Long Chen.

“I sense the head’s aura…”

Just at this moment, a voice rang out in Long Chen’s mind. It was low and heavy but contained a power that would not diminish despite the long years.

“Senior Western Desert?”

The Heaven Splitting Divine Tablet was delighted. It hadn’t expected it to awaken at this time.

“The prophesied son has finally arrived. Long Chen, use the head’s power to break these chains. However, I’ve had all my power sucked away by them, so I won’t be able to help you escape when the time comes,” said the Western Desert Ax.

Long Chen’s heart pounded. Could this all have been arranged by the workings of fate? Only the Eastern Wasteland Bell’s fragment could save the Western Desert Ax, while Long Chen had only ended up here due to searching for the Heaven Splitting Divine Tablet. Was he really this so-called prophesied son? The gamebreaker?

“No problem. Once I release you, as long as you don’t resist, I can bring you into my space,” said Long Chen.

“Will that work? Senior Western Desert is…” The Heaven Splitting Divine Tablet was startled. This supreme divine item would shatter any astral space it was stored in.

“No problem. Even the senior Eastern Wasteland Bell was capable of entering,” guaranteed Long Chen.

After saying that, he turned to Dong Mingyu. “Hold my waist.”

Dong Mingyu obediently held on. After that, Long Chen’s primal space shook. He first brought the Heaven Splitting Divine Tablet inside and took out the bronze fragment. He then cut it against one of the chains.

As soon as the bronze fragment touched the chain, the chain exploded. At the same time, divine light exploded out of the fragment, and the other chains binding the Western Desert Ax also exploded.

“Senior, come in!”

The giant ax slowly entered the primal chaos space. It was so big and so heavy that moving it was extremely laborious.

With the Western Desert Ax out of energy, it couldn’t assist Long Chen in his efforts. Long Chen was relying entirely on his own power.

“Senior Divine Tablet, please help!” cried out Long Chen.

The depths of the sea rumbled and roiled. It was as if the entire devil sea was boiling. The alarm had most likely sounded, and the peak experts of the devil race would quickly arrive.

With the Heaven Splitting Divine Tablet’s help, the Western Desert Ax was finally dragged into the primal chaos space. Long Chen then slammed the Horned King’s body, blasting it apart.

The Horned King’s body exploded, and his essence blood transformed into a whirlpool. Long Chen stepped inside, vanishing without a trace. The whirlpool then slammed shut behind him.

He had only just left when one figure after another appeared. They were the devil race’s top experts. They possessed the power to destroy heaven and earth.

“Life Sacrificing Blood Shield? A traitor has appeared within the devil race! Lock down Devil Spirit Mountain!”

These top experts immediately sensed that a secret art of the devil race had been used, one that could be activated by sacrificing a life to create a transportation formation for another person. Only devil experts with the purest bloodline could activate it.

However, for someone like the Alldevil Heavenwalker, the life he sacrificed might not be his own. He had subordinates who had to know this technique so that they could potentially save their master.

As for the Horned King, he also knew this technique because despite his status, he was still one of the Alldevil Heavenwalker’s subordinates. If he had to, he would have to use this technique for the Alldevil Heavenwalker.

There were two ways to activate this technique. One was voluntarily using it, and one was forcibly activating it. If the subordinate was unwilling to use it, the master could directly kill them to activate the technique.

This technique was extremely marvelous and could allow someone to escape with their life. It could be activated quickly and without warning.

Long Chen arrived at the Horned King’s cave once more and immediately eliminated the two guards.

Lightning then flashed around him, and he shot off like a bolt of lightning toward the transportation formation. The lightning made it impossible to see his appearance.

Once he arrived at the transportation formation, he waved his hand, unleashing a sea of lightning that wiped away those preparing to use it.

Long Chen activated the transportation formation. But right at this moment, the void rumbled. The devil race’s elders had sent out the order to lock down Devil Spirit Mountain, so a beam of light shot out of the center of the island, sending out chains in every direction.

However, Long Chen smiled. The transportation formation had been activated. Furthermore, he had broken the control mechanism, so it was too late for them to restrain him.

At the next moment, the void twisted. Long Chen felt himself being drawn in.

BOOM!

A giant hand suddenly fell from the sky, shattering the transportation midway. As a result, Long Chen was torn out of the void and coughed up a mouthful of blood.
