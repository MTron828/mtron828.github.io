“Long Chen has come to the Heavenly Desolation Domain!”

Within a glorious palace, dozens of elders gathered together. At the center of the hall sat a wizened old man, nearly skin and bones. Without that thin layer of skin, his bones seemed like they might collapse.

Despite his frail appearance, the old man still possessed an imposing bearing, his eyes still bright within their sunken sockets. Occasionally, streaks of lightning flashed deep within them.

There were four seats in front of him. While everyone else’s seats were silver, these four seats were golden.

Three of the four golden seats were occupied, while one remained empty. The first seat was taken by a black-haired, middle-aged man with bushy eyebrows. This was Long Qihua, the leader of the four Heavenly Saints.

In the second seat sat a short, chubby elder who looked almost like a dwarf. His feet didn’t touch the ground as he sat, giving him an odd appearance. He was the Long clan’s second Heavenly Saint, Long Yaoting.

The one on the third seat was a woman with a cold and indifferent expression. Her eyes were closed, as if she were meditating or simply uninterested in the outside world.

She was the only woman of the four Heavenly Saints, Long Qianxue. She was naturally cold and hadn’t spoken in hundreds of years. It wasn’t that her cultivation technique forbade her from speaking; she simply couldn’t be bothered.

The fourth seat was empty, belonging to Long Zhantian, who was not present here.

Other than the three Heavenly Saints, dozens of Heaven Saints were also present. These Elders held the highest authority in the Long clan, and among them, one Elder stood out because he was merely an Earth Saint. However, despite his lower rank, he was the Heaven Overseer who had previously met Long Chen.

All the Long clan’s top experts had gathered. When the wizened elder announced that Long Chen had arrived, their reactions varied—astonishment, indifference, anger. One elder, with only a single arm, clenched his teeth, his killing intent rising.

The wizened elder was the clan leader. After speaking, he fell silent and simply looked at everyone, as if waiting for their response.

However, not a single person spoke. The entire hall was deathly silent.

They knew who Long Chen was, and many of them couldn’t help but stare at one particular elder whose expression was especially gloomy. He didn’t even bother concealing his killing intent.

This individual was a former member of the four Heavenly Saints, Long Zaiye. His arm had been severed by Long Zhantian.

Several months had passed since he lost his arm and had his position taken. Yet, his hatred had only intensified. Long Zaiye swore to reclaim what was rightfully his and exact vengeance for the humiliation Long Zhantian had inflicted upon him.

However, up to this point, he had yet to do so. And now, Long Zhantian’s son had come.

During a previous Long clan assembly, the Heaven Overseer had advocated for Long Chen’s acceptance into the clan, urging them to lower their resistance. If they ignored him, he would have no sense of belonging in the Long clan.

Long Zaiye vehemently opposed this suggestion. Most elders shared his sentiment, with some remaining silent, unwilling to express their views.

The Heaven Overseer had helplessly said, “If you don’t bring Long Chen back now, once he grows to Long Zhantian’s level, the Long clan will have lost any chance of bringing him back.”

Under the intense opposition, the Long clan tabled that matter indefinitely. After all, only the four Heavenly Saints had the authority to make such decisions, but with one absent, the other three remained silent.

Seeing the staunch opposition of the former member of the four Heavenly Saints, most people followed his lead. The main problem was that Long Zhantian had barged into the Long clan in the most violent and forceful manner, killing many of their experts. That was a naked slap in the Long clan’s face, and they harbored a grudge against him.

The patriarch had resolved the issue, but resentment simmered beneath the surface. Although Long Zhantian had departed from the Long clan’s territory, his son’s arrival reignited their resentment.

On that fateful day, Long Zhantian had charged into the Long clan on his own, leaving a trail of death and countless injuries in his wake. Many of those slain had been key figures within their branches, so how could these elders not harbor some resentment?

Hearing news of Long Chen’s arrival, many of them felt the urge to kill him. However, they were still able to hold it back and didn’t express it so openly like Long Zaiye.

For a moment, the hall fell into a heavy silence, lasting as long as an incense stick’s burn. Finally, Long Zaiye lost his patience and said, “Are they trying to humiliate the Long clan? First the elder, now the young one? Aren’t they acting like the Long clan has no one who can put them in their place?”

The Heaven Overseer interjected, “The clan leader hasn’t addressed this matter yet. Isn’t it premature to pass such a judgment?”

Long Zaiye furiously argued, “Don’t forget what happened! Have you forgotten the arrogance of his father? Have you forgotten the lives lost among our experts?!”

With a disdainful curl of his lips, the Heaven Overseer replied, “I don’t know whose subordinate was so stupid as to demand Long Zhantian’s blood for verification. That’s what triggered him. When did our clan’s disciples ever demand such a thing for one of our own to return home? If they hadn’t intentionally insulted Long Zhantian, he wouldn’t have retaliated. After that, they surrounded and attacked him without giving him a chance to explain. If they were prepared to kill, they should have been prepared to face the consequences.”

“You…!” Long Zaiye was infuriated. It was his bloodline’s branch that had provoked Long Zhantian, leading to the death of his descendants. In his fury, Long Zaiye charged forth, only to have Long Zhantian sever his arm. If not for the intervention of the first Heavenly Saint, Long Zaiye might not have survived the encounter.

“Enough,” the clan leader intervened. “I convened this meeting to discuss how the Long clan should treat Long Chen, not to listen to your bickering.”

“What is there to discuss?! Have him scram! If he doesn’t scram, just kill him!” snorted Long Zaiye.

The Heaven Overseer sneered, “You really are an oddity. Did Long Zhantian sever your arm or your sense? How could you say something so brainless? Both Long Zhantian and his son are Long clan members, with Long clan blood coursing through their veins. What right do you have to cast them out? Moreover, it was Long Zhantian who severed your arm, not Long Chen. Blaming a junior without cause, do you have no dignity?”

Long Zaiye erupted from his seat. “I care not for dignity! I’m going to kill that brat right now!”DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

In front of everyone’s shocked gazes, Long Zaiye stormed out.
