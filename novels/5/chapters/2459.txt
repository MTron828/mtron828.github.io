Chapter 2449 The Power of the Third Step of Netherpassage

Translator: BornToBe

A crab even bigger than a mountain came out of the Demon Moon Furnace. It fell to the ground, its body fully cooked and bright red. Something yellow was coming out of its belly, giving off a strong scent.

“Sorry, the fire was a bit strong,” said Long Chen apologetically.

A peak expert of the sea demon race had been cooked by Long Chen. This was a giant slap in the face to the entire sea demon race. The sea demons were gnashing their teeth furiously.

“You really are too courteous. You know that it’s been a long time since I’ve had meat, so you gave me such a nice crab. Speaking of which, did you bring any hot peppers for flavor?” asked Long Chen.

“Long Chen, you will regret this.” The Six Horn Sea Serpent man’s words came from the space between his clenched teeth.

“Regret it? No, you will be the one regretting it. I let you off in front of the Yin Yang World and then again in the Martial Heaven Sea-Ring. I’m telling you, I’m not used to letting things go like that. This time, I’m not letting you go again. I’ll show you who is going to regret it!” A cold light appeared in Long Chen’s eyes.

The sea demon race was really stupid. It seemed that the Ye family had incited them as well. This time, Long Chen wasn’t planning on having mercy on them.

A race with such low intelligence would never forget about an enmity. They would only remember that others had done things wrong to them without ever considering their own actions. Long Chen had endured them twice before, but now he had cooked that peak expert to show his determination.

“Long Chen, you’ve now created an undying enmity between the sea demon race and your Martial Heaven Alliance!” declared the Six Horn Sea Serpent.

“Alright. I feel like rather than just shouting, you should use that trident in your hand to speak,” said Long Chen lazily.

The Six Horn Sea Serpent man furiously waved his hand, giving the signal to retreat.

“You guys should retreat as well. Ah, don’t forget to bring the crab. Don’t eat him yet. We’ll save the feast for when I cook this little fish serpent as well,” said Long Chen to the Dragonblood warriors.

“Die!” The Six Horn Sea Serpent man suddenly attacked. The horns on his head lit up one after another. His aura multiplied in power.

This could be considered his strongest divine ability. Every horn on his head was like a seal containing his power. Now that all six horns lit up, a wave of power spread in every direction. Both the sea demons and the Martial Heaven Alliance’s disciples retreated.

“Long Chen, I wasn’t going to kill you because you aren’t my target. My targets are those like Feng Fei. But since you’re in such a rush to reincarnate, I’ll show you the Six Horn Sea Serpent race’s forbidden power!”

The Six Horn Sea Serpent man suddenly vanished. It was as if he had teleported. He appeared in front of Long Chen, his trident slashing down like lightning.

The power of this attack had reached the pinnacle. Even the Dragonblood warriors sensed a feeling of death coming from that attack.

“Just brute power? I’ve never been afraid of that.” Long Chen snorted. This divine ability was just pure power. Hence, Long Chen slashed his saber out. His astral spaces sent their power circulating through him. His FengFu, Alioth, Life Fate, Enlightenment Palace, Divine Gate, and even the slumbering Nethergate Star that had yet to fully form began to shudder.

Six stars appeared in his eyes. Although he could only summon the Five Star Battle Armor, the sixth star was definitely there. His life and death energy erupted.

Even as the Six Horn Sea Serpent unleashed his full power, Long Chen used just one hand, meeting his bone trident with Evilmoon.

A powerful explosion unleashed a tempest with the two of them at the center. Astral winds were flung out chaotically.

The two of them were still locked at the center, neither of them budging. However, the surrounding space was being continuously wrecked.

“You’ve improved, but you want to challenge Feng Fei with just this level of power? You must be joking,” sneered Long Chen.

The Six Horn Sea Serpent man was shocked. Even after experiencing his race’s blood baptism, he was still unable to beat Long Chen in power.

In truth, Long Chen’s calm expression was just cover. He was shocked inside. He had previously thought that life and death energy was more of a law and not a power. But upon reaching the third step of Netherpassage, he realized that when he used his world energy, his life and death energy was the key to controlling his world energy. This was something that he had not noticed or heard of before.

Life and death energy could be considered a law for others. The life energy could be used to heal oneself or others, while the death energy could be added to weapons or magical arts to give them the power of a law. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

However, the Nine Star Hegemon Body Art was different. Now that he had reached the third step, his astral spaces had opened, giving him an unending source of explosive power.

Without even realizing it himself, Long Chen had grown in power.

No matter how the Six Horn Sea Serpent attacked, Long Chen didn’t budge. This infuriated him.

“Bastard!” A giant manifestation appeared behind him, rapidly growing solid. It was a giant sea serpent.

Water Qi filled the air, turning it sticky and misty. It was even possible to smell seawater.

His manifestation roared. The mist condensed into water droplets that turned this place into a giant sea.

Within this sea, the Six Horn Sea Serpent’s power continued to rise. It could no longer be considered pure power, as it now contained the strongest laws of the sea. This was a domain.

“I didn’t think that you’d force me to use my Heavenly Water Domain. Long Chen, you can be proud even in death. This was what I was preparing to use against Feng Fei.” Within the raging sea, the Six Horn Sea Serpent sneered at Long Chen.

His voice was full of anger, as well as unwillingness. This was a technique he had never exposed in front of outsiders. As long as he was given enough time, he could suck in the entire world’s Water Qi to support himself. This was the divine ability that allowed the Six Horn Sea Serpent race to stand amongst the top ranks of the sea demon race.

Every technique had its own flaws, including this Heavenly Water Domain. He needed to condense mist, then condense droplets, condense water, and then turn it into a sea. Furthermore, it needed to be completed over a large area to be effective, or the opponent would escape out of it.

This technique took a great deal of time to set up. Now that it was exposed, his enemies would simply flee as soon as the mist appeared. Then he would never be able to use this trump card again.

This was what he had been planning on using against Feng Fei, but now Long Chen had forced it out. This technique would now probably be useless against Feng Fei.

“What a useless technique. After one use, it no longer has any effect. There’s no need to use it against weak opponents, while strong ones will be prepared. You really do underestimate Feng Fei. You think that this could trap her? How naive.” Long Chen shook his head contemptuously, still not counterattacking.

“Big words, but you won’t be able to escape alive now,” sneered the Six Horn Sea Serpent. His domain continued to grow larger, and the pressure increased.

If he allowed this domain to continue growing limitlessly, in theory, he could control this entire world. Of course, the precondition was that he could control it without it devouring him first.

Even as the Six Horn Sea Serpent’s domain increased in power, he didn’t unleash any fierce attacks.

Long Chen slowly smiled. “What? Are you stalling for time? Sorry, my time is limited. I’m going to attack.”

BOOM!

Long Chen suddenly slammed the back of Evilmoon’s blade with his other hand. A fierce power created a typhoon within the sea.

“Azure Dragon Battle Armor!”
