Chapter 3569

Divine light pierced through the world, instantly creating a giant opening in the spatial gateway.

Staring into that hole, people saw endless devil beasts on the other side. They also saw a tiny speck fall amongst them. It was Long Chen.

“World Extermination Lightning Radiance!”

A thunderous cry reached them. After that, an explosion of lightning turned those devil beasts into a mass of flesh and blood, and some of that came flying back through the channel.

As a result, startled cries rang out. The people staring into the hole had no time to dodge and were directly struck by a current of flesh and blood.

That immense current then crashed through mountains, and countless people popped out of it. By that time, the spatial channel had closed once more, leaving behind only stunned experts. They were all silent.

…

When Long Chen entered the chaotic spatial current, he could sense those powerful spatial blades. He had experience in that regard, so he directly charged through to the end of the spatial channel.

Once he was on the other side, powerful devil beasts attacked. This attack could be seen from the other side of the channel, and it came from over ten mid stage World King earthen dragons.

They actually knew a combined attack. It was quick and vicious, definitely capable of killing anyone caught off-guard. If Long Chen had not been prepared, he might have very well died.

It was only now that Long Chen could see this place clearly. It was a den of devil beasts, and they were practically endless. It was as if they had set up a heaven-encompassing net just to make sure that anyone that came through the spatial channel would be sending themselves to their deaths.

Huo Linger was still absorbing the Yan Xu Flame, so Long Chen directly summoned Lei Linger. As a result, lightning ravaged this space, slaughtering those devil beasts.

However, at that moment, Long Chen’s heart suddenly shook. Terrifying auras were rising in the distance, and they gave him the chills.

“Late stage World King devil beasts!”

Long Chen’s expression changed slightly. It should not be assumed that he could dominate late stage World King devil beasts just because he could kill late stage World King Heavenly Flame Spirits and late stage World King humans.

Devil beasts that were capable of cultivating to that level were not ordinary devil beasts. They had to be species with major origins, powerful bloodline inheritances, and terrifying divine abilities.

There were millions of species of devil beasts, and different species had different divine abilities. Even with a World Domain divine item in hand, a late stage World King of the human race was not a match for a devil beast in the same realm. Normally, it would take several people in the same realm to join forces before people dared to fight one devil beast.

As for the auras that Long Chen sensed now, they were definitely not ordinary. Furthermore, there were dozens of them. The disturbance here had actually drawn out dozens of late stage World King devil beasts.

Hence, Long Chen didn’t dare to tarry. He didn’t even bother gathering the precious devil cores, and lightning wings already spread on his back. Using the Lightning Falcon race’s movement art, he flew off.

He had just flown off when the void behind him exploded. One giant figure after another appeared, chasing after him.

“Damnable human race, stop right there!” roared one of those giant devil beasts.

“Oh? A beast speaking the human language?”

Long Chen couldn’t help shouting back. He instantly realized that the devil beasts here were different from the lower grade ones that he usually encountered. They were higher grade devil beasts, and it only made sense for them to be able to speak.

“Damnable human race, stop right there! I will tear you to pieces!” Another furious roar came over. They clearly heard him.

This response instantly made Long Chen relax. For it to say such a thing, it seemed that their intelligence was very average. He was no fool. Why would he stop and be torn apart?

Seeing that they had some intelligence did move Long Chen. If he could capture them and do a soulsearch or perhaps a slave seal, perhaps he could learn some secrets. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

However, after counting, he saw that there were twenty-seven late stage World King devil beasts. After a moment’s hesitation, Long Chen gave up on that enticing thought. He still didn’t know the situation in this place, and it wasn’t worth the risk.

After thinking through it, Long Chen’s lightning wings accelerated. He was like a shooting star vanishing across the horizon. Those devil beasts were instantly thrown off.

The Lightning Falcon race’s movement art gave them unrivaled speed. This was the trump card that allowed Long Chen to act so recklessly. If he couldn’t beat someone, he could always run, and no one could do anything to him.

After flying a bit, Long Chen noticed a city in the distance, so he went over to take a look. However, the city was already in ruins. There was desolation everywhere. The broken buildings were clearly done by devil beasts.

But within these ruins, he didn’t see any signs of battle or any blood. It was as if the people inside the city had retreated, leaving an empty city that the devil beasts then destroyed.

From the ruins, he found a transportation formation. However, it was also destroyed. Furthermore, from the marks left over, it seemed to have been destroyed by the human race.

“Could it be that the devil beasts here know how to use the human race’s transportation formations?” Long Chen was surprised by this. Otherwise, it didn’t make sense for them to break their own transportation formations.

Long Chen investigated but found no secret transportation formations. He then took out the map again. Fortunately, this map that the Huayun Trading Company had given him was detailed enough. Even this tiny city of the Alldevil Star-Field could be found on it.

“This is nothing more than a remote place whose main purpose was a transportation node for people entering the Alldevil Star-Field.” Eyeing the map, Long Chen saw a row of irregular white spots and instantly understood.

The white spots were like a dotted line stretching into the depths of the Alldevil Star-Field. That was where the real cities were. Clearly, this place was still considered the wilderness. There was still a long way until he reached the core region.

Without any transportation formations, Long Chen could only fly on his own. He was fast, but the Alldevil Star-Field was enormous. In order to guarantee that he would always be in his peak condition, he would rest for an hour every now and then.

After two days of flying, the curious thing was that he didn’t encounter any other devil beasts or any humans. Everything was strangely calm.

When Long Chen followed the map to a large city, just as he was about to get near the city, rumbling sounds rang out. Battleships then came whistling out of the void.

They were quite domineering in size and form, looking like metal beasts. Also, runes flowed around their entire bodies, and a murderous aura came from them. They were very impressive.

There were dozens of them, and they flew right past Long Chen’s head. The sound of space being broken and the heavens’ dome being torn apart sent waves blasting in every direction.

Following that, furious roars came from ahead of them. The entire world instantly became dark as countless devil beasts that had been hidden, slumbering in this place, were now attacked by these battleships.

The battleships unleashed waves of divine swords upon the devil beasts. In front of these divine swords, those devil beasts were as weak as paper and instantly torn through. Their blood dyed the sky red.

“What powerful battleships!”

Long Chen sighed in amazement. He rushed forward, and after climbing a mountain, he saw the ancient city in the distance and an endless sea of devil beasts around it.

“They’re… attacking to lift the siege?” Long Chen’s heart shook.
