Chapter 1572 Come and Bite Me!

Translator: BornToBe

“We had no choice but to be patient. The higher the cliff, the higher the waves that crash against it,” said that elder with a faint smile.

The elder had a friendly face, and his faint smile seemed natural. It was like he was a kind senior that would never get angry or fight others.

“Patriarch, you’re right. What we needed was a cliff so high that it could tell the waves to go fuck themselves!” cried out Long Chen.

The valley master’s expression sank slightly. He couldn’t even reply to such an indirect insult without losing status.

“Bastard, no one taught you any manners, is that it?!” The Divine Flame Palace’s master was the first to rush to Yu Xiaoyun’s aid.

Long Chen was about to retort with a few choice words when the patriarch said, “My apologies, this child is too young and temperamental. I’ve made you laugh at us. However, I feel like this matter can end here. After all, continuing to mess around isn’t beneficial to anyone.”

Long Chen frowned. Wasn’t that too weak? He looked at Li Tianxuan and saw the latter shrug helplessly.

“Stop here? Are you joking? Long Chen has slaughtered countless innocent people, harming the very core of the Eastern Xuan Region! Why should we stop here? Do you feel like that’s possible?” sneered Yu Xiaoyun.

“Well-”

The patriarch’s words were cut off by Li Tianxuan, who said, “Master, why don’t you come here and rest? Leave this to me. All you need to do is be a fighter. I am the current Xuan Master, so I’ll handle it.”

The patriarch, who was the old Xuan Master, simply did not know how to be unyielding. Even Li Tianxuan couldn’t bear to continue watching it. Most likely, his master was about to try to compromise and settle this thing peacefully, but such a thing was simply impossible.

The patriarch bitterly smiled. Shaking his head, he didn’t say anything in retort. He gave his position to Li Tianxuan, and Li Tianxuan pushed Long Chen in front of him.

“Now Long Chen is the temporary Xuan Master of the Xuantian Dao Sect. Valley master, if you have any problems, you can talk to Long Chen. Long Chen’s attitude is the attitude of my Xuantian Dao Sect. Whether we fight to the death or settle things peacefully, it’s all up to Long Chen.”

Li Tianxuan’s words left no room for doubt. Everyone’s expressions changed. If Long Chen was in control of the Xuantian Dao Sect, wouldn’t that mean another battle was about to erupt?

“Alright. Then my orders are for all troops-” Long Chen raised Evilmoon without hesitation, about to charge forward.

Li Tianxuan almost coughed up blood. That was not what he had intended. He hastily shouted, “First diplomacy before fighting!”

Long Chen helplessly put down Evilmoon, resting it on his shoulder. He looked at Yu Xiaoyun. “Fine, diplomacy first? Although I feel like such a thing is wholly unnecessary, my mood isn't bad after finding out that the Xuantian Dao Sect and my friends are still fine. I’ll play a bit. Just now, you said I have slaughtered countless innocent people. Tell me, what makes them innocent? They wanted to kill me. Was I supposed to show my neck to them so they could kill me?”

Long Chen’s mood was truly excellent. Although he had learned that the Xuan Master was safe thanks to Zheng Wenlong’s messages, he hadn’t known the situation about the people. Now seeing them all alive, he felt a weight being lifted from his shoulders.

He appeared to be a completely different person now, no longer overflowing with battle intent. He looked like a simple scoundrel without the slightest air of an expert.

“Bastard, can you have some upbringing? Someone like you isn’t qualified to speak to the valley master. Even speaking to me is a loss of my status!” shouted the palace master in place of Yu Xiaoyun.

Long Chen’s status truly wasn’t high enough for him to speak directly to Yu Xiaoyun. The palace master came out at just the right time, taking his place.

“Fuck off. I’m not talking to you.”

Long Chen’s feet didn’t move. He didn’t lift his legs and simply swung a hand.

The two of them were originally hundreds of meters away, but it was like Long Chen had teleported to slap the palace master’s face and then returned as if he hadn’t done anything.

The palace master had still been sneering derisively when Long Chen struck him, sending him flying. The sound of bones breaking rang out along with a pained grunt.

His movements were clean and natural. It happened suddenly without the slightest warning. Even the valley master and the old Xuan Master only reacted after Long Chen’s slap had struck.

Everyone’s jaw dropped so low that they could fit their own fists inside.

It was silent. Just what was domineering? What was called arrogance? Ignoring a Netherpassage expert and slapping his underling, a late Life Star expert, in the face. In this world, where would one find someone more domineering and arrogant than Long Chen?

From the moment he moved, to his slap, to returning to his position, it all occurred in less time than it took to blink. In just that short time, he accomplished something that surpassed all their imaginations.

“Amazing! When can I also be so unbridled in front of peak experts?” Seeing everyone’s shocked expression, Guo Ran was filled with envy.

This time, Guo Ran’s display had already been dazzling enough. The Dragonblood Cross Slash had even injured the palace master using a divine item. That was absolutely shocking.

He had truly shown off, and his light even suppressed Yue Zifeng’s. It could be said that his name would truly shake the four seas.

However, if he had to compare himself to Long Chen, then if Long Chen was the bright moon, he wasn’t even a twinkling star. He was more like a firefly. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

Ignoring how Long Chen had fought against three top experts without fear, how he had been unrivaled when his five stars had awakened, and how he had consecutively cut down heavenly geniuses, that slap alone was enough for him to look down arrogantly upon the rest of the world. Who else but Long Chen was capable of such a feat?

Long Chen had just returned to his position when a net of divine light enveloped him. It was Yu Xiaoyun. That slap wasn’t just a slap across the palace master’s face, but it was also a slap across his face and Pill Valley’s face.

This divine net came from the Daynight Furnace, and it was so quick that Long Chen had no chance of getting away. However, he also didn’t try to dodge. He lazily rested Evilmoon on his shoulder.

Divine light struck like a sword, blowing the net apart. That light had come from the Xuantian Tower, in conjunction with the patriarch. Although the patriarch’s character was very yielding, his power was great. It was no wonder Li Tianxuan had told him to just act as a fighter this time.

“I, Long Chen, represent the Xuantian Dao Sect. As long as I give the word, the entire Xuantian Dao Sect will attack you with our full power. Does an insignificant palace master have the qualifications to speak with me? Can you represent Pill Valley? If not, then stop wasting my time.” Long Chen had known that the patriarch wouldn’t let him be bullied. Hence, he could sneer down at the palace master who was crawling up from the ground, his head still misshapen.

Just now, Long Chen had forgotten about the weakness of flame cultivators’ physical bodies. He had almost killed the palace master with his slap.

“If you want to talk, then let’s talk. If you don’t want to talk, then let’s fight. As for smearing my name, just stop. That’s too inferior. You said I was controlled by an evil weapon and destroyed my sect? Are your heads only filled with crap? What a ridiculous story. As for the idiots who believe anything that people say, if I say I’m your father, will you kneel down and call me daddy? All of you better listen well. There are quite a few people amongst you idiots who once came to suppress my Xuantian Dao Sect. Back then, I said that anyone who tries to stop our rise would be mercilessly slaughtered. However, did you think holding onto someone bigger’s leg would protect you? You repeatedly sent your people against me. Did you think numbers would protect you? Not only could you eliminate an enemy, but you could also get a favor from someone else. It’s not a bad plan. That’s why you didn’t care whether or not I was falsely accused. You blindly did whatever they wanted you to do. You controlled the Eastern Xuan Region’s public opinion. You acted like you actually believed the lies spewing from your mouths. Was it fun to invert black and white, to confuse right and wrong? Well, it wasn’t very fun for me. Nevertheless, it was fun when I killed your idiot disciples. But based on your expressions, I see that wasn’t very fun for you. Do you want to come and bite me?”

Long Chen had no fear with the Xuantian Tower supporting him.

As for these senior experts that had come, many of them were leaders of their own sects that had sent their disciples here. Those disciples had been slaughtered to the last by the Dragonblood Legion. Seeing Long Chen’s current appearance, they truly did want to bite him to death.

Suddenly, a Life Star expert amongst the crowd roared, “Long Chen, don’t be so arrogant and act so righteous! Even if you were wrongly accused, you should have explained yourself instead of slaughtering everyone! The way I see it, you simply wanted to kill instead of explaining yourself! You’re a murderous devil, a piece of trash, a bastard-!”

That person was in the midst of cursing when a saber-image fell, causing him to explode.
