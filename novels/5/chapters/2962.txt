Chapter 2951 Third Rank of the Inner Academy, Long Yanzong

Hearing this, Long Chen turned back and saw a person walking over. His heart then shook.

This person was exceedingly tall and muscular. His hair was golden, as were his eyes. Moreover, there were flames dancing within his pupils.

He was like a walking volcano, as his body contained endless flame energy. When it erupted, it would shake the heavens.

This was Long Chen’s first time seeing someone with such pure flame energy in their body. Moreover, such a powerful person had actually called out to stop him.

From this person’s robes, one could see that he was an inner academy disciple whose cultivation base was in the Divine Flame realm. However, his aura was even more shocking than Four Peak experts’ aura.

“Do you need something?” asked Long Chen.

That person eyed Long Chen. He said, “I have an urgent matter to attend to. Leave this place to me. Once I’m done, you can use it.”

His tone was flat. It wasn’t pressing or overbearing. However, it was unquestionable.

“Sorry, but I also have urgent matters to attend to. Once I’m done, you can use it.” Long Chen walked in. What kind of joke was that? He was in more of a rush than anyone. Even if this man had asked nicely, Long Chen would have refused, let alone with such a tone.

Upon hearing this, that man’s expression sank. He barked, “Are you a newcomer? Do you not know who I am?”

“I am a newcomer, but I’m not interested in knowing who you are,” said Long Chen.

“Brat, I urgently need to cultivate the fourth volume of the Nirvana Scripture. You had best listen clearly. I’ll give you two options. Leave and I’ll give you one million immortal crystals when I’m done. Or, I, Long Yanzong, head of the inner academy’s third strongest guild, won’t let you live much longer in the inner academy!”

This person was the leader of the third strongest guild. He was extremely powerful and had an explosive temper. Other than those two monsters, everyone else in the inner academy was afraid of him.

Wherever he went, others would flee. Hence, for some rookie who had just entered the Divine Flame realm to not appreciate his kindness, he was enraged. If this place wasn’t the Divine Scripture Pavilion, he’d have long since attacked.

Long Chen eyed Long Yanzong and sneered, “Boss Long San isn’t afraid of anyone’s threats. You might not have recognized me before, but let me tell you now that Boss Long San can go wherever he pleases in the inner academy. From a young age, I’ve specialized in curing people with your particular illness. If you’re interested, I’ll help cure you another day.”

Long Chen directly walked into the room and closed the door behind him.

“Courting death!”

Long Yanzong was enraged. Flame runes appeared on his fist, and he had an urge to smash open that door.

He had read the fourth volume of the Nirvana Scripture over ten times in the last half year. He had spent almost thirty million immortal crystals on it. Today, a flash of enlightenment had struck him, and he felt that he had a high chance of fully comprehending it.

Hence, he had rushed over, only to see Long Chen had activated it first. He then thought that Long Chen would let him go first, but Long Chen actually ignored him.

With this rage, his good mental state was broken, and any sense of enlightenment was gone.

The Nirvana Scripture was different from other techniques. Some cultivation techniques could be trained in private rooms or the rooms by the bookshelves.

However, the Nirvana Scripture had to be comprehended within that specific room because when it was comprehended, flame energy would burst out. A mistake could destroy the pavilion.

There was only one room for the Nirvana Scripture, and to use it, you had to wait until the person inside was done. Only then could a second person go in.

Long Yanzong was so enraged that, let alone comprehending the Nirvana Scripture, he couldn’t even calm himself down. Even when Long Chen came out, he wouldn’t possibly go in because he had no chance of comprehending it in this state.

“Brat, you really are courting death. Let’s just wait until you come out.”

Long Yanzong gloomily left. The people inside the pavilion that saw him immediately got out of the way, not even daring to look at him.

Long Yanzong was famed for being a fearsome existence. Flame cultivators all had explosive tempers. Seeing him leaving so gloomily, they acted like they didn’t see anything. Once he arrived at the exit, the disciples at the entrance greeted him respectfully.

“Who is that black-robed brat?” demanded Long Yanzong.

“He’s a newcomer to the inner academy named Long Chen. I heard that he’s very powerful. He killed Chu Yang’s little brother, Chu Kuang, in the outer academy. He also won the divine competition and entered the inner academy through there,” reported a disciple.

Long Yanzong sneered, “Chu Yang? That scheming little man? Hmph, his little brother definitely isn’t much better. What faction is Long Chen from?” Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

“He has no faction or backer. Right now, he has a status as a Human-rank instructor of the God Institute, a Human-rank instructor of the Immortal Institute, and a disciple of the Pill Institute.”

“Understood. Foolish brat, just wait.”

Long Yanzong snorted and left, leaving behind the quivering disciples.

…

Long Chen didn’t bother caring about Long Yanzong. The moment he saw the latter, he already saw through his character. Domineering, selfish, obstinate, and petty.

He had seen many people like that. If you conceded one step to them, they would take two steps forward. They didn’t know what gratitude or respect was.

This Long Yanzong would become his enemy sooner or later. With just a look, Long Chen knew that they were fated to be enemies. He would have to either beat him into submission, or beat him to death.

Inside the room, he found that he was in an entirely separate world. It felt like he was within the cosmos. Countless flame runes floated around him like stars.

Every rune represented a different kind of flame energy. Hence, it was as if he was immersed in a sea of tens of thousands of flames. He finally no longer felt aggrieved about those immortal crystals.

This place was actually a giant flame formation, and comprehending the Flame Dao was far easier here. Long Chen didn’t care about the comprehension side, but Huo Long directly charged out.

As soon as Huo Long appeared, those twinkling flame runes quivered. After that, flame energy poured toward Huo Long.

A sphere of light then lit up in Long Chen’s hand, and sacred chanting rang out. That voice was so familiar.

This was the Nirvana Scripture. It started with the first volume all the way to the third volume. When the fourth volume started, those flame runes began to move toward Long Chen.

A figure then appeared in Long Chen’s mind. At that instant, he was too stunned to move.
