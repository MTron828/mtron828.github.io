Chapter 2581 Mysterious Cloud Seas

“Well done,” snickered Evilmoon.

“You bad person, why did you use me to hit big brother Long Chen?” The one to attack Long Chen was the Demon Moon Furnace. Ling-er jumped out of the furnace and glared at Evilmoon, her hands on her hips.

The Demon Moon Furnace had been refining pills when Evilmoon had suddenly dragged it out of the primal chaos space and struck Long Chen with it. Now, its item-spirit, Ling-er, was glaring at Evilmoon like she would declare war on it.

“My power is linked to Long Chen. If I attacked, he would sense it. The only one capable of sneak attacking him in this state is the one he trusts the most, you.”

“Really? I’m big brother Long Chen’s most trusted person?” Ling-er’s fury vanished, replaced with delight.

“Of course. There is no one who can compete with you,” said Evilmoon.

Ling-er smiled excitedly. “I’m big brother Long Chen’s most trusted person, haha…” But after spotting Long Chen lying on the ground with an egg-sized bleeding lump on his head, her expression changed and she cursed Evilmoon, “You bad person, I was his most trusted person, and I hit him! He won’t trust me anymore! I… I… I’ll go all-out against you!”

The Demon Moon Furnace lit up with divine light.

“Ow.”

Just at that moment, Long Chen woke up and he rubbed his head. Feeling the giant lump on his head, he furiously said, “Old man, weren’t you too ruthless? Did you need to hit me so hard?”

Long Chen felt like his back skull was broken. What a ruthless blow. He was still dazed.

“Don’t blindly accuse people.” The old man pointed behind Long Chen.

Long Chen turned back, just in time to see Evilmoon and the Demon Moon Furnace vanish at the same time. They returned to the primal chaos space, acting like this had nothing to do with them.

Long Chen shook his head and saw Boss Bao and the others staring at him in shock. He seemed to recall something yet also wasn’t able to recall it.

“Old man, did I lose control just now?” asked Long Chen. He circulated the primal chaos space’s life energy, and the lump on his head slowly shrank.

“Yes. Everything was going well at first, but when your divine ring appeared, you lost control. Just as you were about to summon the Six Star Battle Armor, you were knocked out by your pill furnace,” said the old man.

“Big brother Long Chen, it wasn’t me, it was that evil fiend-!” explained Ling-er.

“It’s fine. You were probably the only one who could stop me in that state,” comforted Long Chen.

Although he didn’t quite know what had happened, he knew that after fighting together for so long, he and Evilmoon had gradually started to merge their power. It was difficult for Evilmoon to directly stop him as a result.

In order to comfort Ling-er, Long Chen repeatedly emphasized how important she was. In truth, it could have been the Demon Moon Furnace, the Heaven Flipping Seal, or the Moon and Star Refining Furnace. Any of them could have struck him without him sensing the danger.

“Hmph, that evil fellow Evilmoon was right. I really am big brother Long Chen’s most trusted partner!” As expected, Ling-er was delighted to hear this.

“Long Chen, look inside yourself. See if your body has changed,” said Evilmoon.

Long Chen asked for a break from the old man. After that, the old man quickly checked his body and found that he wasn’t injured. He even had sixty to seventy percent of his spiritual yuan. That shocked the old man. Such a terrifying Heavens’ Wrath hadn’t even exhausted Long Chen that much.

Since he was fine, the old man let him go. However, the old man called over Boss Bao and the others for a lesson on the finer details of controlling the Heavens’ Wrath.

Long Chen then found a place to sit. He closed his eyes and activated his inner sense. After that, he was shocked to find cloud seas had appeared over his 108,000 astral spaces.

“What is that?” asked Long Chen.

“How am I supposed to know? When you entered the Heavens’ Wrath state, your astral spaces sucked in the outside world’s energy and condensed these cloud seas. They seem slightly similar to the law runes of the outside world but also not exactly the same. They were extremely active when you were in the Heavens’ Wrath state, but once you were knocked out, they calmed down,” said Evilmoon.

Long Chen examined them, feeling lost. Currently, he had to rely entirely on himself for the Nine Star Hegemon Body Art. The cloud seas completely threw him off.

“It seems that the cloud seas are being absorbed by your astral spaces. When the cloud seas were active, the outside world’s laws were affected by you and controlled by your divine ring. That’s why you were able to unleash so much power without actually using up much of your own. Most importantly, the backlash mentioned by that old man didn’t appear, perhaps because of these cloud seas as well. That’s all the information I can provide you. You’ll need to figure out the rest by yourself,” said Evilmoon.

He hadn’t exhausted much of his own energy? Nor had there been much backlash? Only now did Long Chen think to check and see that he had maintained sixty to seventy percent of his essence, qi, and spirit. He also wasn’t like Boss Bao and the others who were too exhausted to stand after entering this state.

When Evilmoon explained what had happened, Long Chen could only stare blankly at the cloud seas. His astral spaces were now covered by the cloud seas. They were like mist, providing a mysterious layer to his astral spaces.

“Well, I suppose they must be something good. But I have no idea how to use them,” sighed Long Chen. The Nine Star Hegemon Body Art was starting to evolve out of his control.

Rumbling rang out to the other side. Bao Buping, Chang Hao, and the others were still training. They gradually came to control the Heavens’ Wrath state. Although they were still exhausted after one attack, it wasn’t as bad as their first try.

They began to preserve more and more energy, and yet their power only grew. They were clearly rapidly gaining insight into this technique.

“Damn it, am I really unable to learn the ninth form of Split the Heavens? The old man must have a way!” Long Chen started to grow anxious upon seeing their rapid improvements.

Now that he had come to experience just how terrifying this attack was, he wanted to learn it even more.

“There must be a way. There must! Calm down and think…” Long Chen tried to comfort himself. He entered a meditative state to calm himself and check his own body.

His astral spaces didn’t seem to have much of a connection to the cloud seas. They were both still. Even after examining them for a long time, he wasn’t able to see any clues.

After that, he slowly entered the Heavens’ Wrath state. At this moment, the cloud seas started to quiver. With his previous experience, he kept himself in this initial state and patiently observed the changes.

As his essence, qi, and spirit spread through the outside world, the world rumbled, and the cloud seas became active. They were roiling, and the astral spaces were also quivering.

“I get it. The cloud seas are the bridge between the astral spaces and the outside world. My essence, qi, and spirit are the fire seed, while these cloud seas are the firewood. I’m burning the energy of the astral spaces and the outside world. Only once the fire seed is big enough will it cause more cloud seas to ignite. But these cloud seas really are baffling. I have no idea what they really are.”

“Evilmoon, I’m trying again, look after me.”

Long Chen’s fury began to soar. As a result, the old man and the others jumped. This time, Long Chen’s Heavens’ Wrath was even more berserk than last time.

However, Long Chen was once more struck in the end and collapsed. When he crawled up, he checked the cloud seas. They had grown a bit.

Evilmoon said, “This is no good. When you enter that state, you automatically summon your divine ring and then your Six Star Battle Armor. You are unable to control it. That little old man is correct, if you can’t control yourself, you will unleash all your power into one attack and then die. Your soul is too complicated to control this anger. The ninth form of Split the Heavens isn’t suited for you.”

Evilmoon understood Long Chen well. Long Chen had gone against the common path countless times due to his instinctive will. That was something that could not change.

Although Long Chen had not mentioned the Pill Sovereign’s will within his soul, Evilmoon had managed to sense it.

Furthermore, it was not just the Pill Sovereign’s memories. There was something far darker hidden within Long Chen’s soul.

Evilmoon had already interrupted Long Chen multiple times when that black aura had started to infect him. That was why Evilmoon suggested that he gave up on the ninth form of Split the Heavens. It had no affinity with him.

“Essence, qi, and spirit are the origin. The cloud seas are the base. Ignite the energy of the astral spaces and the Heavenly Daos. Use anger as the connection to merge the two. The Heavenly Daos don’t like me, so I have to forcibly take their energy. The Heavenly Daos don’t like that, so they disturb my mind to make me see all the memories that infuriate me. How infuriating. I can’t control my fury, so the fire only grows until it goes out of control…”

Long Chen muttered to himself. Evilmoon fell silent. It had already given up, but if Long Chen refused to give up, then it wouldn’t waste any further effort on changing his mind. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

Long Chen suddenly slapped his leg and jumped up with a smile. “I’ve figured it out. This will definitely work.”
