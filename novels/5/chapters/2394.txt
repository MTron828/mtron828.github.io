Chapter 2384 Brothers, Perform

Translator: BornToBe

Ye Lingfeng quickly arrived with over twenty thousand Heavenly Dragon warriors. This hall was big enough to fit them all.

Ye Lingfeng glared at Long Chen. The rest of the warriors of the third legion were about the same.

When Ye Lingfeng reached Long Chen, he pointed at him and was about to say something when Long Chen slapped him. “How brazen! Kneel!”

At the same time, Long Chen kicked Ye Lingfeng’s knee, forcing him to kneel.

“Instead of greeting the lord overseer, you point at others? That great disrespect is unacceptable, even to me! Speak, do you want to die?” Long Chen grabbed hold of Ye Lingfeng’s hair and conveniently slapped him a dozen more times.

“Long Chen, stop!” shouted Elder Long.

Shen Chengfeng hastily separated Long Chen and Ye Lingfeng, but Ye Lingfeng’s face was still badly swollen.

The pockmarked elder slammed a wooden seal repeatedly. The sound was so loud that it shook people’s ears. “Long Chen, what are you doing?! It is forbidden to injure people in this hall! Come, capture him!”

“Hold it! On what grounds?” demanded Long Chen.

Ye Lingfeng crawled up from the ground. He was dizzy from the slapping and still didn’t know what was happening. Not even in his dreams would he imagine that Long Chen would dare to strike him here.

“Please get justice for this little one!” cried Ye Lingfeng. Unexpectedly, his acting skills were not bad. He could cry so easily.

“Shut up! You’re crying here?” cursed the pockmarked elder. Ye Lingfeng shut his mouth, leaving the hall silent. Everyone was looking at Long Chen. The elder coldly said, “Do you need to ask on what grounds? It’s based on the grounds that you attacked and injured someone here in this hall! Just this is enough to punish you.” Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“Bullsh*t. When we entered, you were the one roaring about how we needed to kneel. But you didn’t say a thing when they came in. In fact, Ye Lingfeng ignored you rudely, so I taught him a lesson. After all, you were the very one who said that this is to protect the dignity of the divine families and the order of this court of law. This is to protect the world’s peace and maintain the civilization of the cultivation world. Did I say anything wrong?” asked Long Chen.

Shen Chengfeng and the other warriors of the eighth legion looked at each other in amazement. Long Chen wasn’t just skilled at fighting. His mouth was not one whit less sharp.

He had clearly beaten someone simply because he disliked them, but he could still come up with such a grand reason to make this beating just, as if not beating Ye Lingfeng would be against the laws of the heavens.

Elder Long lowered his head, not daring to look at Long Chen for fear of laughing. The Elder beside him was trembling, on the verge of losing control.

The pockmarked elder was also trembling but from rage instead. “You are spouting nonsense! Even if a lesson needed to be taught, it would be a matter for the law enforcement disciples! You have overstepped your responsibilities. Come, have-”

“I slapped him because of an aboveboard reason. Everyone saw it. He came in rushing at me to attack me, so why couldn’t I defend? Is reasonable self-defense a crime?” sneered Long Chen.

“More nonsense! Everyone here has eyes, and I saw that he never attacked you!” raged the pockmarked elder.

“You didn’t see it because you are blind, but everyone else saw it. He came rushing at me as soon as he saw me, and when he was less than ten feet away, he suddenly pointed his finger at me. At that distance, if he wanted to attack, he would instantly take my life. His left foot was forward, his right foot was back. His mouth was open, his eyes were circular. That was clearly the posture of the long-lost technique, the Teeth Grimacing Life Ripping Finger. I also felt a sharp killing intent that chilled me from the bottom of my feet to the top of my head. Even my shoes turned cold. To protect myself in that situation is the natural instinct of a cultivator. I attacked to prevent him from killing me. Ah, it really is frightening just thinking about the Teeth Grimacing Life Ripping Finger. It actually contains fierce curse energy. Suddenly, I feel dizzy. Quick, I need support, I’m dizzy, I’m falling…”

Long Chen started to totter, so Shen Chengfeng came to support him. Long Chen groaned, “How insidious. My elbow, ow! My hips, ah! My waist, it’s doomed. This wound, there’s no way for me to recover without five hundred and fifty thousand points. Elder Long, please, get justice for me! I was helping you when I was injured, so this is a work injury. You have to support me.”

Seeing Long Chen fake being injured, the pockmarked elder’s face was twitching. He had never seen such a shameless person. He had clearly been the one to beat someone else and was now acting like the injured party.

Both the Heaven Elders and the disciples were dumbfounded. Their eyes had been opened to the world.

Elder Long’s mouth opened several times, but no words came out. Every time he opened his mouth he felt like laughter would come out, so he could only close his mouth and nod.

“Alright, this matter can end here. Long Chen, we’ve held eight joint hearings in the past, and we only seek the truth. Thousands of warriors have lost their lives this time, and that is no small matter. This matter must be investigated to give an explanation to the dead. You don’t need to worry about us accusing someone innocent. So, I hope you can be cooperative. After all, the Star Field Divine World is about to be opened, and the dark era will be following. Time is very precious to all of us, so wasting time is killing ourselves.” The white-haired elder finally spoke up. Although his face was icy without the slightest air of a smile, his tone was not forceful.

Long Chen immediately stood straight and gave him a thumbs up. “Senior is wise. These words are correct. Suddenly, I feel like my injuries have healed quite a bit. If others could speak like you, then we would definitely be able to discuss things properly.”

The white-haired elder smiled ever so slightly and looked at the pockmarked elder.

The pockmarked elder looked from Long Chen to Ye Lingfeng. Although Ye Lingfeng’s face was too swollen for the others to see his expression, it was definitely not a good one.

“Ye Lingfeng, why did you go to the eighth legion’s camp?” asked the pockmarked elder.

“Reporting to senior, we had just taken some losses and were in a rush to make up for them. In our carelessness, we were suddenly surrounded by demonic beasts. When we heard that the eighth legion was making an attempt to reclaim their camp, we were trapped near them. We wanted to warn them about the mass numbers of demonic beasts nearby so that they could retreat, but who would have thought… Long Chen actually betrayed us!” cried Ye Lingfeng.

Long Chen sneered at him. “Can you use your brain when lying? Do you think everyone is as stupid as you? Why were you surrounded by demonic beasts in the first place? Wasn’t it because you were intentionally drawing them over?”

“It was an accident. We didn’t realize we were surrounded until it was too late,” said Ye Lingfeng firmly.

“Then tell me, what were those nine tracks of bloody corpses nearby there for? Was it not because you attacked nine regions of demonic beasts to draw them over? Although you tried to clean it up afterward, there were definitely nine tracks. I’ve already had people record them. Here, I’ll show everyone.” Long Chen activated a photographic jade, revealing nine bloody marks left on the ground. They were like nine rivers of blood, all pointed toward the eighth legion’s camp.

Ye Lingfeng’s expression changed. Although he had tidied up afterward, it wasn’t possible to cover it all up. The blood that soaked into the ground couldn’t be instantly cleaned up. A hole had just been poked in his story.

“Ye Lingfeng, how brazen! You dared to lure demonic beasts to harm others?!” shouted the pockmarked elder.

“It’s not my fault! Long Chen was the one who harmed me first! I was forced to counterattack!” Ye Lingfeng had no choice but to do his best to drag Long Chen down with him.

“Hey, what are you saying? Is there proof?” asked Long Chen.

“You…” Ye Lingfeng was speechless. Long Chen had done things so cleanly that there was no proof to be used against him. Going crazy, Ye Lingfeng declared, “The eighth legion has broken the laws of the divine families! When we were in crisis, you refused to help us! You even banged drums and gongs to celebrate your own success instead of helping us! As the leader, you must be executed!”

Having been the one to draw so many demonic beasts over and have so many warriors die, he was definitely dead. He could only grasp onto this one weak point of Long Chen’s to have the slightest hope of living.

“Was there such a thing?” demanded the pockmarked elder.

“Everyone from the third legion can testify to it!” declared Ye Lingfeng. The third legion’s warriors began to give testimony about how Long Chen had started banging drums, playing gongs, and lighting firecrackers.

“Long Chen, do you have an explanation?” asked the pockmarked elder, a glimmer once more appearing in his eyes.

“What is there to explain? I told you that I was testing ways to fight demonic beasts. I was doing my best to drive the demonic beasts away from you this way,” said Long Chen indifferently.

“What nonsense! That is impossible!” The pockmarked elder shook his head.

“You don’t believe me? Alright, I’ll give you a demonstration. Brothers, perform.” Long Chen waved his hand.

The eighth legion’s warriors immediately took out their instruments, creating such a loud clamor that it felt like the entire hall would explode. Everyone felt their heads buzzing.
