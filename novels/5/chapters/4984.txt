“An open conversation? Yes, well said!” mocked Long Chen, nodding at the clan leader’s awkward expression.

Indeed, someone who could sit in the position of the clan leader couldn’t be ordinary. The clan leader’s mental fortitude was definitely above average. Despite Long Chen’s mocking tone, the clan leader chose to ignore it.

He said, “You hold the position of dean at High Firmament Academy and have established your own legion. If you consider yourself a member of our family, you must understand our current predicament. Even the finest chef cannot cook without ingredients...”

Seeing the clan leader once more become long-winded, Long Chen hastily said, “Get to the point.”

What kind of timing is this for him to seek sympathy? Isn't he embarrassed? Long Chen thought cynically.

The clan leader patiently responded, “Access to the Heavenly Fate Divine Pool is something we can grant you. However, the Jiuli Tower is among our most closely guarded secrets. How did you...?”

“My father told me,” said Long Chen without hesitation. “With my father’s abilities, even sealing his memories is useless.”

In truth, Long Chen wasn’t certain if his father’s memories had truly been sealed, but he was confident they couldn't have been erased so easily.

The clan leader said, “The Jiuli Tower is a major matter that requires deliberation. We will give you an answer later. However, you can go to the Heavenly Fate Divine Pool first. Regardless of the outcome, the benefits of the Heavenly Fate Divine Pool are yours to enjoy.”

Hearing this, Long Chen felt that there was a chance of things going smoothly. As expected, while brute force wasn’t the best way to solve all problems, when a problem couldn’t be solved, brute force was an excellent method.

“Qianxue, bring Long Chen to the Heavenly Fate Divine Pool,” ordered the clan leader.

Long Qianxue nodded and escorted Long Chen away. Inside, Long Chen celebrated quietly. It was a relief that Long Qianxue was accompanying him, not the Heaven Overseer.

Had it been the Heaven Overseer, it would have meant the clan leader was suspecting the Heaven Overseer of secretly colluding with Long Chen. For the Heaven Overseer to be staying for their discussion meant that things were going smoothly.Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

Long Qianxue led the way in silence, with Long Chen following quietly. They encountered no one on their route; the Long clan seemed unusually focused and dismissive of idle bystanders.

After going through a transportation formation, Long Chen and Long Qianxue appeared atop a tall mountain. Veiled in clouds and imbued with immortal qi, this secluded place instantly refreshed Long Chen as he felt the air invigorating his pores.

The spiritual qi in this area had condensed to a kind of limit. Most importantly, it was notably gentle, nurturing Long Chen’s mind and soul. It seemed capable of silently revitalizing all life.

As Long Chen appeared, two elders immediately stepped forward. Long Qianxue simply raised her hand and remained silent.

Although Long Qianxue was one of the four Heavenly Saints, the four elders didn’t even look at her. She appeared accustomed to this and simply handed a jade plate to one of them.

The elder then placed it on a stone gate behind him, and the gate creaked open.

This location was heavily guarded and restricted access solely to those possessing the right status plates. Only the four Heavenly Saints, the Heaven Overseer, and the clan leader were authorized to enter. Without their respective plates, even important people would be denied access.

When the stone gate slowly opened, a dense mist billowed forth. Long Chen immediately felt his entire body relax, his Blood Qi quickening as it greedily absorbed the energy.

“The energy of the divine pool is gentle while within it, but once absorbed into the body, it can become uncontrollable. It may trigger the awakening of Doyen power, pitting you against the heavens. You have to know how to control it. Many heavenly geniuses have perished within the Heavenly Fate Divine Pool, and it is all due to one thing: greed,” said Long Qianxue.

“Many thanks,” Long Chen acknowledged with a cupped fist. At least Long Qianxue seemed decent enough to offer a warning.

Other than the Heaven Overseer, perhaps everyone else in that assembly wanted Long Chen to die here. Not encouraging him to absorb as much as he could until he exploded was already nice of them. There was no way they would warn him of this danger.

“No need for thanks. But next time you curse people, try to point them out clearly,” Long Qianxue remarked curtly before departing.

Long Chen felt a twinge of embarrassment. He had just cursed them all, including Long Qianxue. When anger took over, he tended to overlook such details.

After Long Chen had walked through the gate, he heard it close behind him. Through the mist, he vaguely saw stone steps going down, so he followed the path. After a dozen steps, he stepped into a milky white liquid.

“Hehe, this is the Heavenly Fate Divine Pool. Looks like things are really going smoothly.”

There was no need for him to even absorb it; it flowed effortlessly into his body through every pore.

The sensation was akin to a thousand gentle hands massaging every inch of him, so profoundly comforting that Long Chen nearly wanted to roar with delight.

Simultaneously, his dragon blood, violet blood, and seven-color Supreme Blood all surged into a frenzy of circulation. It was as if this new energy was the most exquisite delicacy they had ever encountered.

His seven-color Supreme Blood devoured the energy with the most ferocity, seemingly liberated from the suppression of his dragon blood.

“Hehe, you’re finally in your element,” Long Chen chuckled softly. This divine pool was a legacy of the Long clan’s ancestors, naturally affecting their bloodline the most. Here, the seven-color Supreme Blood reigned supreme.

Long Chen made no effort to actively absorb the energy. He simply closed his eyes and allowed the Doyen power to flow into him. Once inside his body, it ceased its gentle influence and ignited into a slow-burning intensity.

However, the burning process was very slow, and the power continued to climb incessantly. No wonder Long Qianxue had told him not to be too greedy at once.

The experience was akin to drinking alcohol: it might go down smoothly at first, only to unleash its potent effects unexpectedly later on. A single excessive gulp could lead to intoxication hours later—or worse, death. The energy in the divine pool was similar. The spiritual qi was mixed with various energies of heaven and earth. Once they left the bindings of the divine pool, they slowly awoke and started to resist.

After the burning of an incense stick, Long Chen figured out the pattern of this energy. After making a simple estimation, he directly called out Huo Linger and Lei Linger.

When the two of them entered the divine pool, they were incredibly excited. Long Chen gestured for them to be silent and pointed at the door.

“You have to learn how to silently profit!”
