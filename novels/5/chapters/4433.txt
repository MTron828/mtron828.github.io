Chapter 4422 Refining the Sacred Light Snow Lotus Pill

After throwing the Sacred Light Pistil into the primal chaos space, Long Chen was about to find a suitable place in the central medicinal field for it when the Earth Cauldron stopped him.

“It can’t be planted here. It is an ice element species, whereas this place is filled with fire elements. Plant it near the border.”

Thinking about it, Long Chen realized that it was right. The primal chaos space was now incredibly vast. However, the central region was filled with the immense Fusang Trees and Moon Trees. They had already spread out and occupied their own territories in the central region.

Fortunately, after the primal chaos space expanded, the edges of the primal chaos space remained empty. Hence, Long Chen carefully planted the Sacred Light Pistil in the border region.

Upon contact with the soil, delicate hair-like roots emerged from its base, and frost instantly covered the ground. The frost rapidly extended over thousands of miles, persistently growing. The single pistil was like a seed and quickly produced a leaf.

There was only a single leaf and no sign of a flower. The leaf had a hexagonal shape, with veins gradually forming on its surface. A potent sacred aura coursed through these veins.

Upon the birth of the first leaf, an astonishing event unfolded. The Sacred Light Pistil rapidly withered, causing Long Chen to panic at the sight. Was it unable to grow in this place?

“Don’t panic. This is the particularity of the Thousand Leaf Sacred Light Snow Lotus,” reassured the Earth Cauldron, as if anticipating this outcome.

The Sacred Light Pistil withered, and that thumb-sized hexagonal leaf slowly fell. Once it fell, the withered root system seemed to awaken and connect to the fallen leaf.

With the nourishment of the root system, the leaf started to glow. Following that, two edges on the top of the leaf produced two tiny shoots. Those two shoots quickly produced two more hexagonal leaves.

As a result, one gave birth to two, two gave birth to four, four gave birth to eight, and eight gave birth to sixteen. What Long Chen found curious was that the Thousand Leaf Sacred Light Snow Lotus had no stalk. It consisted of leaves only.

The hexagonal leaves were crystalline, with sacred light flowing within them, looking like colored glass. Their beauty could make a person forget all their vexations.

“Toss all the corpses into the black soil. Don’t hold back,” instructed the Earth Cauldron.

Only then did Long Chen manage to pull himself out of his rapture. He had a large stock of Eternal corpses, and many of them had Neidans or crystal cores. Since they were treasures to Xia Chen and Guo Ran, directly decomposing them would be a waste.

Hence, Long Chen did a quick extraction. After taking out those cores, he tossed the corpses into the black soil. As more corpses fell into the black soil and were devoured, vast life energy filled the primal chaos space.Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

Sensing so much life energy, the Thousand Leaf Sacred Light Snow Lotus started to grow even more rapidly. However, after it reached one hundred and twenty-eight leaves, its growth speed clearly slowed down.

Its leaves didn’t go straight up but spread in every direction, looking like a holy ice spirit flower vase.

“Work hard. The Thousand Leaf Sacred Light Snow Lotus must have one thousand and twenty-four leaves to produce the Sacred Light Pistil. It is the main ingredient to refine the Sacred Light Snow Lotus Pill,” said the Earth Cauldron.

Hearing this, Long Chen clenched his teeth and stopped bothering with the Neidans and crystal cores. He directly tossed all his stock of Eternal corpses into the black soil.

“Senior, do you think this is enough? If it’s not, I’ll get more fertilizer right now.” Long Chen was determined to make this work. If the number of corpses wasn’t enough, he was ready to take a stroll through the new worlds that had just opened.

“It should be enough,” said the Earth Cauldron.

The Thousand Leaf Sacred Light Snow Lotus quickly gave rise to five hundred and twelve leaves, and a new batch of leaves quickly grew. At this moment, the Thousand Leaf Sacred Light Snow Lotus was already bigger than a person.

Its form underwent a continuous transformation, resembling a beautiful maiden in a dance. Additionally, a colossal world of ice had manifested around it.

Surprisingly, this ice didn't exude coldness; rather, it emitted a sensation akin to sacred light purifying the soul.

After a sequence of changes, a total of one thousand and twenty-four leaves emerged. Finally, the Thousand Leaf Sacred Light Snow Lotus had achieved its ultimate form.

A snow-white lotus flower then appeared. When its nine leaves opened, they revealed three tender flower pistils, and three pillars of sacred light soared into the heavens.

At this moment, all the corpses that Long Chen had gathered were devoured. The giant Fusang Trees and Moon Trees had once more grown immensely.

However, what surprised Long Chen was that their flames had actually weakened slightly. Their power was starting to withdraw inside of their bodies.

Every single leaf of the trees had a powerful flame rune. If you were to pick off a single leaf and detonate it, it would be enough to wipe out an ordinary World King.

The Fusang Trees and Moon Trees were still growing stronger, but it seemed that they were still a far cry from the Fusang Trees and Moon Trees that existed in the legend.

Long Chen didn’t pay much attention to them, as his focus was on the Thousand Leaf Sacred Light Snow Lotus. He reached out and carefully plucked the three flower pistils.

When the three Sacred Light Pistils were extracted from its body, the Thousand Leaf Sacred Light Snow Lotus instantly crumbled, transforming into ice fragments.

“It’s fine. Even if it loses all of its Sacred Light Pistils, it won’t die in this place. However, it will take some time for it to be reborn. Ignore it for now. Come out. We’re going to refine the Sacred Light Snow Lotus Pill,” urged the Earth Cauldron.

When Long Chen left the primal chaos space, he was holding three Sacred Light Pistils.

The Earth Cauldron materialized in front of him. Without him needing to say anything, Huo Linger also appeared and started to warm up the Earth Cauldron.

The Earth Cauldron said, “My Spiritual Strength isn’t enough to refine this pill. Furthermore, my strength is difficult to replenish, so I will need to rely on your Spiritual Strength to refine this pill.”

“That’s fine. I have plenty of Spiritual Strength,” said Long Chen indifferently. He had absolute confidence in his Spiritual Strength.

“It will be different this time. We are refining a Saint Pill. Do you understand what a Saint Pill is?”

“Could it be…?”

“Yes, it is a pill used by Saints. Your Spiritual Strength is powerful, but it’s still not enough to fully refine a Saint Pill. Thus, during the refinement, you will need to use soul nourishing pills to recover your Spiritual Strength. I will control the tempo of the refinement to give you some time to recover. However, we also don’t have that much time. If the refinement time is stretched out too much, the medicinal pill’s spirituality will plummet, and the produced pills will be of low quality. It would be a waste of treasure,” said the Earth Cauldron solemnly.

Long Chen’s heart shook. They were going to refine a medicinal pill used by Saints? Then the difficulty would probably be heaven-defying with his current abilities. Not daring to be careless, Long Chen focused and entered his top condition.

“Let’s begin.”

A golden flame rose in the Earth Cauldron, and the three Sacred Light Pistils in Long Chen’s hand flew into its body.
