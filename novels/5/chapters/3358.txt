Chapter 3347 Old Brilliance

“Are you mad? The resources required for such a thing are unimaginable.”

Even Bai Zhantang was shocked. The academy’s grand formation had seven levels. Right now, they had built them up to the third level.

Activating the seventh level required all the buildings to be fully restored. That required an ocean’s worth of resources.

“No worry. I don’t have anything else, but I do have money. The seventh academy is mine, so it must be built into the strongest stronghold. The defensive and offensive power must be of the strongest level. Speaking of which, the spirit gathering formation and training formation must also be the strongest. No need to worry about money. Work as fast as you can and be happy about it. I will pay you ten times the wage that the main academy pays you,” said Long Chen to the craftsmen.Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

These craftsmen were delighted. They were already paid a decent sum by the academy, but for Long Chen to offer them ten times that, they immediately got to work.

There truly was nothing for Long Chen to nitpick about Zheng Wenlong’s efficiency. Those hundred thousand Wood Foundation Divine Fruit had been directly provided as collateral for Long Chen, enough to provide him with an incredible amount of resources. All the resources that weren’t immediately required for bare minimum maintenance within the nearby domains were sent over to Long Chen. Storehouses were emptied for him.

Materials for all kinds of buildings were piled up. When Bai Zhantang saw the mountains of materials, he was dumbfounded. This fellow Long Chen had way too much money. With millions of craftsmen working, they had finished the bare-bones structure of the seventh branch academy. But with these resources, they further perfected it, restoring it to its former glory.

When the main palace was completed, its glorious splendor changed the entire aura of this place. An ancient yet new aura filled the air. When it was finished, heaven and earth shook. Karmic luck flowed toward the seventh branch academy.

This branch was originally a treasured land of great fengshui. When the palace was completed, it was like it had awakened, drawing out a natural manifestation of heaven and earth.

One palace after another was built and bricks covered the roads. After that, emerald grass grew out of the land like a mattress. Small bridges over creeks and rivers were constructed. Now, this place was filled with immortal qi. Long Chen had turned the seventh branch academy into a wonderland.

Furthermore, in order to improve the atmosphere, Long Chen even took out some fertile soil from the primal chaos space and sprinkled it in some places. This soil still possessed immense life energy even after leaving the primal chaos space.

After moving it outside, there would be no problem for its life energy to remain for hundreds of years. During this time, it would improve the fertility of the natural soil, allowing all vegetation to flourish. Even some large trees that might take years to sprout would instantly germinate and grow if planted here.

Day by day, the seventh branch academy grew. In just a short month, all the buildings of the old branch academy had been rebuilt.

During this one month, the amount of resources that Long Chen took out shook Bai Zhantang and the others deeply.

Every day, the Huayun Trading Company was sending over an ocean’s worth of resources. And every day, they were used up. The millions of craftsmen were constantly busy, working without pause.

Even after watching the work be done bit by bit, when the seventh branch academy was fully restored, they felt like they were dreaming. 

Bai Zhantang was truly unable to imagine just what kind of relationship Long Chen had with the Huayun Trading Company. They just tossed over so many precious resources like they were trash.

Just using money, Long Chen had created a glorious branch academy. The work of a hundred years was completed in just a month.

All the buildings could be used now. If the formation was fully activated, this domain’s power would be instantly sucked into one single attack, and that truly was an attack capable of killing a World King. With this, the seventh branch academy was truly an impenetrable stronghold.

However, the huge price had used up a hundred thousand Wood Foundation Divine Fruit. That was essentially all of them. Zheng Wenlong had also emptied the storehouses of the Huayun Trading Company in all the nearby domains to satisfy Long Chen’s requirements.

The huge amount of business that Zheng Wenlong had conducted gave him greater privilege and authority compared to before. In the future, as long as Long Chen had some treasure, he could directly exchange them with the Huayun Trading Company. This was a true mutually profitable collaboration.

However, for now, Long Chen could no longer bother Zheng Wenlong. The resources he had right now were gained using the Wood Foundation Divine Fruit as collateral. If something happened and the price when they were sold and auctioned was not as high as expected, then the Huayun Trading Company would lose out. Thus, for now, Zheng Wenlong could only provide Long Chen with this much.

Anyway, this was enough. Long Chen had the best spirit gathering formation, and his giant academy only had a thousand disciples. All kinds of resources were available. There was no need for people to line up to get their resources.

Heaven Master Yun Yang, Heaven Master Dong Ming, and the others sighed in amazement. Whether it was the Elders or disciples of the seventh branch academy, they were all blessed. With only a few people, there were more resources available for every person. Even Bai Shishi’s mother joked about leaving the Battle God Palace and joining the seventh branch academy, enraging Bai Zhantang.

With the seventh branch academy being built into such a glorious state, the main academy asked if Long Chen wanted them to send him some people to keep up appearances, but Long Chen declined.

He said that other than some Elders for day-to-day management, he didn’t want anyone from the senior generation. He wanted a young academy.

The main academy respected his choice, so they didn’t push this or ask again. That made Long Chen feel much more at ease. Although the academy was inflexible with some things, they kept their word. So, he was satisfied.

He didn’t mind raising some more people, but if they just came to eat without doing anything, wouldn’t that be irritating? If he had a bunch of new people come to criticize and give orders, he would be vexed to death.

Thus, what was important was quality, not quantity. Fewer people meant that things were easier to manage. There would also be fewer conflicts, and he would have it easier as dean.

Since this place was already built into an invulnerable stronghold, Bai Zhantang brought his people away. He had brought thirty-six Immortal Kings, and Long Chen gave each of them a Wood Foundation Divine Fruit, shocking and delighting them. This thing was incredibly precious, and even if they couldn’t use it, they could exchange it for other treasures.

As for Bai Shishi’s mother and Bai Xiaole’s mother, Long Chen naturally wouldn’t be stingy. He gave each of them ten. The only things that he could bring out for them were these things.

Hence, the two of them smiled widely and praised Long Chen for being thoughtful and magnanimous. But when it came to Bai Zhantang, Long Chen didn’t give him anything.

To use Long Chen’s words, Bai Zhantang was the deputy palace master, so how could he give him such a small thing? It would be an insult to his dignity, so Long Chen didn’t give him anything.

Hearing this, Bai Zhantang clenched his teeth in fury. Just how much did Long Chen want to humiliate him? But with his status, he definitely couldn’t lower himself to ask Long Chen for one. He could only act disdainfully and leave.

After a month of hard work, Long Chen could finally relax. As long as it was within the Vile Dragon Domain, even if Enpuda personally came, he wouldn’t be afraid.

Bai Shishi, Mu Qingyun, Luo Bing, and the others cultivated in the spirit gathering formation. The cultivation conditions here were many times greater than at the main academy. They didn’t want to waste any time.

After finishing all this, Long Chen also wanted to start cultivating. However, just then, he suddenly thought of something very important.

His mind sank into the primal chaos space, and he came to the foot of the Heavenly Dao Tree in the black soil. When he saw its current state, he was absolutely shocked.
