Chapter 1902 Long Chen’s Appetite

Translator: BornToBe

“I haven’t failed your mission.”

Xia Chen’s voice rang out, causing everyone’s expressions to change.

Suddenly, rays of divine light began shining out of the ground. They were like pillars of light, enveloping the entire battlefield within them.

At the same time, formation runes began flowing in the air, and a figure appeared in the sky. It was Xia Chen.

Xia Chen had a giant formation disc above him. Divine light flowed out of it and created a dome that covered this region.

“What damn thing is this?!” One of the ancient race experts launched a furious sword blow at the formation. When his Sword Qi struck the barrier, it didn’t cause the slightest ripple. The Sword Qi simply vanished.

All the experts were shocked. Connecting this sudden change with Long Chen’s words, the coalition army’s people suddenly had a bad feeling.

Quite a few experts switched to attacking the formation, trying to charge out.

“Condense!” Suddenly, Xia Chen let out a cry. The formation disc above his head began to rapidly spin. Black ripples spread throughout the barrier.

“AHH!”

Mournful cries came from the experts attacking the formation. Black qi was corroding their bodies. In just a breath’s time, they transformed into a white skeleton. In two breaths’ time, their skeleton also corroded into nothing more than dust.

“What?!”

Now everyone was shocked. Hundreds of experts had just tried to break this barrier, including seven Empyreans. But even those Empyreans were slain.

“He’s drawing out the Yin world’s death’s energy!” shouted someone.

Following that person’s reminder, everyone finally noticed that a portion of this giant barrier was covering the Yin world’s barrier of death. It was absorbing that death energy.

Xia Chen had a gratified smile. This unusual but terrifying formation of his was actually working.

He had started secretly setting up this formation while the battle had been going on. That was the mission Long Chen had given him. Huo Lieyun had wild ambitions, but Long Chen’s ambitions were even bigger. He didn’t just want a simple victory but also the lives of all his enemies.

It could be said that this formation had used up all the accumulated wealth of the Dragonblood Legion. This was an absolutely terrifying formation, which had not only been set up secretly but was also absorbing some unknown death energy. It was a huge gamble with high odds of failure.

However, Xia Chen was a genius formation master. He had actually managed to succeed, so he was filled with pride.

It was only upon joining the Dragonblood Legion that he managed to have the money to squander on giant formations like this. Before this, there were many theoretical formations that he understood but hadn’t had the money to test. Only with a constant flow of money and a lot of testing could his skill increase, so this current accomplishment was thanks to Long Chen’s wealth.

Standing in this grand formation, he had a grand feeling like he was in control of this world. Regretfully, this formation was only a barrier formation, not a killing formation. Otherwise, he could use the death energy to annihilate everyone inside.

There wasn’t enough time to set something like that up, especially since the plan had only popped into Long Chen’s head when he had gathered with the Martial Heaven Alliance’s army. Xia Chen had only had three days to plan and prepare the materials.

The death barrier was like a haze covering this world, and the coalition army’s experts were finally afraid. Long Chen had come prepared.

The golden tide had now ended, and they could no longer feel the fluctuations of life and death energy merging. Instead, the only thing was this death qi.

“As expected, Long Chen is superior to those idiots like Huo Lieyun, Xie Luo, and True Immortal Jiaoqi.” The man in the neutral camp with the giant die spinning behind him smiled slightly. He had been extremely calm from the start, and even the arrival of this grand formation didn’t cause him the slightest nervousness.

Although everyone in the neutral camp knew that theoretically, no one would want to become enemies with them, the arrival of the giant death barrier meant that all their lives were in someone else’s hands. It was a very uncomfortable feeling.

“Big brother Long Chen is amazing! Big sister, look, it was clearly a chance to earn a favor from him, but you didn’t take it. Now you won’t get that chance!” Qi Xuan giggled, her previous nervousness having long since vanished.

Qi Fengxue glared at Qi Xuan but couldn’t be bothered to scold her. Qi Xuan couldn’t even understand just how complicated such a thing was for them.

There was also another woman in the neutral camp. She had an ordinary face and appearance. Looking up at Long Chen in the sky, she had a complicated expression.

The neutral camp’s experts retreated to a corner of the battlefield, not wanting to join in and expressing their neutrality.

However, the nervous people were those who were comparatively weaker. As for the top experts, they were calm. They still wanted to see what the conclusion of this battle would be. Based on the current standings, Long Chen’s side had only taken a slight advantage.

In this scenario, perhaps their chances of victory were higher, but Long Chen’s goal wasn’t just to win. He wanted to annihilate all of his enemies. That kind of appetite was frightening.

This was a true battle to the death. If the Martial Heaven Alliance’s side lost, then the Martial Heaven Alliance would fracture and perhaps collapse.

If the coalition army lost, it would also be a grievous blow to their side and severely impact their morale. The neutral camp’s experts watched with rapt interest.

“You want to devour all of us? Long Chen, your appetite’s quite big.” Huo Lieyun smiled.

“I’ve always had a big appetite. Most importantly, I don’t just have a good appetite but a good set of teeth as well.” Long Chen smiled brightly, revealing his teeth. Those teeth looked quite good normally, but now they seemed to shine with a cold light that gave others chills.

Long Chen’s smile suddenly vanished, replaced with overflowing killing intent. His gaze was as sharp as the tip of a blade.

“Alright, the time for talking is over. To dare kill my brothers of the Heaven Splitting Battle Sect, I’ll have you all accompany them!” shouted Long Chen. “Is the Dragonblood Legion present?”

“Present!” The Dragonblood warriors’ roar shook the sky.

“Kill them all! Don’t leave a single one alive! Vengeance for our fallen brothers!”

“Kill!”

The Dragonblood warriors charged out once more. This time, they were like devils incarnate, their blades slaughtering their enemies mercilessly.

Their charge shattered the courage of these trapped experts. They fell back continuously, trying to avoid the Dragonblood warriors.

The Dragonblood Legion’s addition to the battle instantly made them the strongest force. The Martial Heaven Alliance’s disciples naturally followed behind them, slaughtering their enemies.

“Zhao Tianji, when are our reinforcements getting here?” Seeing this unfavorable situation, Huo Lieyun finally started to get a bit worried. He sent a message to one of the Fate Princes.

“They’ll be here quickly! It should be in an hour!” replied the Fate Prince who was hiding in the crowd.

“An hour?! In an hour, the entire coalition army will be annihilated! Which idiot planned this timing? Were they trying to con us?!” This time, even Huo Lieyun was infuriated with Heavenly Fate Island.

In an hour, most of their members would have been killed by the Dragonblood warriors.

Long Chen had said that Pill Valley was intentionally making the various large powers sacrifice a portion of their experts in order to make them feel hatred for the Martial Heaven Alliance. This deduction of his was accurate. Pill Valley was intentionally uniting the large powers against the Martial Heaven Alliance.

However, there was already enough hatred planted. If all these people were killed, how would Pill Valley and Heavenly Fate Island explain themselves to those large powers?

That Fate Prince’s expression was ugly. Huo Lieyun had just insulted all of Heavenly Fate Island’s people. This plan was plotted by all of Heavenly Fate Island’s calculations. However, none of them had expected things to go awry at every turn. Their plan was supposed to be flawless, but now it had turned against them. If Huo Lieyun didn’t know about Heavenly Fate Island’s enmity with Long Chen, he would really suspect that Heavenly Fate Island was helping Long Chen out.

Heavenly Fate Island had succeeded in scheming against Long Chen multiple times, including the underground battlefield of the Devil Slaughter Rankings. They had mostly been successful.

They had thought that they would succeed this time as well. However, they would never have imagined that Long Chen would obtain so many inheritances in the Yin Yang World, infecting himself with their karma as well. That fragment of Eastern Wasteland Bell in particular threw the lines of fate into complete chaos. Now it wasn’t just Long Chen, but even the people related to his fate were no longer predictable.

So their flawless plan had become a joke. The remaining two Fate Princes were still dumbfounded, their minds blank, not knowing what to do. They could only continue to transmit everything happening here to the outside world through a secret communication method. They told their reinforcements to hurry up.

Suddenly, the two Fate Princes hiding in the crowd saw two Dragonblood warriors charging toward them.

“We’ve been noticed!”

The two of them were startled, but they were comforted to see that it was just two ordinary Dragonblood warriors. They would be easy to handle. Exchanging a glance, they decided not to hide. They took out their strange rulers, and their Heavenly Dao manifestations appeared behind them.

“Die, you bastards of the Dragonblood Legion!” The two Fate Princes both launched powerful attacks.

“You’re the ones who will die.”

The two Dragonblood warriors suddenly spat at the Fate Princes’ faces, and then they unleashed a kick. Their shoes actually flew off at the two of them.

The two Fate Princes instinctively dodged. However, the runes on their rulers didn’t light up.

They hastily dodged the spit and the shoes. As a result, two sharp swords came from a strange angle, slicing up from beneath their butts.

Blood flew into the sky and rained down. The two Fate Princes were turned into four pieces.
