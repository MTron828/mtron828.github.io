Chapter 4269 Astral Power

When violet qi burst out of Long Aotian, the Violet Blood race’s Xu family shouted in disbelief.

Violet qi swirled around him and the heavens. The laws of the Heavenly Daos seemed to be worshiping him.

The violet divine radiance then extended beyond the barrier, enveloping the entire Sage King Convention. It was an endless tide of violet qi that covered the heavens.

Never before had anyone witnessed such a grand manifestation. This endless violet qi resonated with the ten thousand Daos and ten thousand laws.

“How can this be?! How can he have violet blood power?! And how can it be so pure?!” demanded the Xu family head.

The violet blood was one of the strongest bloodlines within the nine heavens and ten lands, but it was different from the seven-color Supreme Blood. It could not simply be produced out of nowhere and was inherited through bloodline inheritance.

In other words, seven-color Supreme Blood was a kind of rare talent mutation that could only be produced by chance, but violet blood had a source and couldn’t randomly appear.

This was precisely why the Xu family head’s expression contorted. He was afraid. After all, their Xu family had betrayed the Violet Blood race. With Long Aotian possessing such a terrifying violet blood power, how could he not be afraid?

Moreover, Long Aotian’s violet blood fluctuations were incomparably pure. They simply couldn’t compare to him. There was a qualitative difference.

The Xu family’s experts finally understood why Long Aotian had said that Xu Yifeng simply could not represent the Violet Blood race when he had fought Long Chen. Now, they understood that Long Aotian was a true expert of the Violet Blood race. That swirling violet qi covered the very heavens, and it also covered people’s hearts with fear.

“Long Chen, your aura is already starting to fall. It seems that I overestimated you. This time, you are definitely dead.” Long Aotian’s primal chaos manifestation was still present, and now there was endless violet qi within it as well.

Long Aotian’s aura, which had been starting to fall before, instantly reached its peak state once more.

“Do you see? This is the power of activated violet blood. As long as heaven and earth are not destroyed, my power is limitless. I am the very heavens! How will you fight the heavens?!” Long Aotian shouted, his voice echoing throughout heaven and earth.

“How will you fight the heavens?!”

“How will you fight the heavens?!”

“How will you fight the heavens?!”

His voice was like an imperial edict. Heaven and earth spread his word to every corner, and it penetrated deep into people’s souls, causing them to feel pain in their souls.

Although it was simply a shout, it somehow contained a powerful spiritual attack. Those with weaker wills would have their souls directly crushed.

“So what if you are the heavens? I, Long Chen, have always lived by defying the heavens. When have I ever been afraid? If you feel like you are the strong one, then why are you so afraid of me? After fighting to this point, you are still holding back. What are you afraid of?” asked Long Chen.

“Me, afraid of you?! Bullshit!”

Long Aotian’s face twisted. In an instant, his previous arrogance transformed into a fierce malevolence.

Long Chen had struck him in the weakest spot of his heart again. Long Aotian truly was afraid of Long Chen, and he couldn’t afford another failure. Thus, even with all this power backing him, he was still afraid.

The limitless power welling up within him failed to provide him with a sense of absolute ease. Even as powerful as he was, he didn’t dare to be the slightest bit careless.

“Whether it’s the seven-color Supreme Blood or the violet blood, I am their master, not you. No matter how your father and mother despicably stole them from me, these things will return to their master sooner or later. What is mine will be reclaimed by me. In a bit, I’ll let you experience what it feels like to have your Spirit Blood, Spirit Root, and Spirit Bone taken. I’ll let you experience what it feels like to be trash.” Long Chen pointed the Minghong Saber at Long Aotian.

“What?! This violet blood is from Long Chen as well?!”

“Just what kind of origin does Long Chen have? How can he have two such terrifying bloodlines?!”

“What’s terrifying is that after losing them all, he still has this much power. If he were to reclaim it…”

The experts present were left feeling utterly drained after hearing their conversation. This one battle seemed to have depleted their lifetime quota of shock. Today, Long Chen had given them far too much shock. They were almost numb now.

“Cut the crap. You’re the one who’s going to die here!”

Long Aotian shot toward Long Chen once more. With a single step, ripples appeared in the void beneath his feet, and his violet qi seemed to seethe. It was as though one could witness the flow of Grand Dao runes converging toward him.

Seeing this scene, countless experts were stunned. Long Aotian was indeed telling the truth. The current him could truly be called the heavens. Heaven and earth obeyed him, and the ten thousand Daos were his to command. Long Chen was not only fighting Long Aotian’s power but also the limitless power of the Heavenly Daos.

In contrast, countless stars suddenly lit up behind Long Chen, forming a starry sea. It was as if the very cosmos had appeared behind him.

“What?!”

Even the most experienced innate Heaven Venerates were startled to see that sea of stars. They had never seen such a manifestation before.

While it was said that the highest realm of the Starry River of the Sky Art was a starry river manifestation, it had remained a mere legend, unseen by any living soul.

In truth, Long Chen’s manifestation was a starry sea, not a starry river. However, the outside world’s experts couldn’t tell the difference, and even the disciples of the Starry River Sect were unable to discern the subtlety.

“Drawing stars into the body!” Long Chen’s dragon scales then lit up, each one having its own individual star.

At the same time, 108,000 stars within the starry sea behind him began to flicker in rapid succession, forming a pattern that resembled a mystical formation.

Long Chen’s whole body was blazing with astral light, as if he had donned a starry sky battle armor. The starlight lit up on the Minghong Saber as well.

“Die!”

Once again, Long Chen and Long Aotian shouted at the same time, their divine weapons roaring with them. One possessed the laws of the Heavenly Daos, and the other contained the power of the stars.

BOOM!

In front of everyone’s rapt gazes, those two divine weapons clashed again, forming a heavenly explosion of Sword Qi and Saber Qi.

This time, their powers didn’t cancel each other out; instead, they slid off one another's forces, crashing into the barrier of the martial stage. A horde of experts fled in panic for their lives.

The divine radiance from these two divine items cleaved the martial stage in two, leaving behind an unfathomable chasm that extended deep into the very Sage King Prefecture.

This attack had already exceeded the scope of people’s understanding. Even innate Heaven Venerates were now pale with terror. There was no blocking such an attack, as anyone who tried would die.

BOOM!

“Again!”

Terrified screams rang out. This time, their explosive power was slanted, rushing toward the buildings out of the martial stage. One particular ray of Sword Qi was headed toward the High Firmament Academy’s side.

Bai Xiaole’s mother was raising her hands to form seals when the palace master slammed a palm forward, causing Long Aotian’s Sword Qi to be shattered.ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

As for Long Chen’s Saber Qi, it rushed toward a group of experts as well. Amongst those experts was a man wearing yellow robes and a golden crown. However, in front of Long Chen’s overwhelming Saber Qi, he just stood there instead of fleeing like everyone else. Long Chen’s Saber Qi directly slashed onto that person’s head.
