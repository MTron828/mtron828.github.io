Chapter 2503 Corpse Devouring Armored Spider

“I’ve found them!” shouted Mo Nian.

By retracing the path of the Ghost Ship and traveling through the endless Black Armor Corps, killing an unknown number of them, after two hours, they finally found their tracks.

This place was a barren land, with multiple powerful auras still hanging in the air. The Black Armor Corps didn’t even dare to approach this place.

“The aura of these flames belongs to the Pill Fairy. There’s also Zhao Ritian’s metal energy and spiritual pressure belonging to Feng Fei. This gorge was created by Ye Ming’s jagged sword. It’s filled with an aura of death and decay. There are also signs of some other attacks that came from unknown people, but they weren’t from Yun Tian. Why are so many of them attacking him at the same time? Is becoming a Sovereign really so important, even more important than the safety of the Martial Heaven Continent? They’ve already forgotten that without the Sovereigns, the continent would have fallen into oblivion, and they would already be dead.” Long Chen clenched a handful of black dirt angrily.

Although Yun Tian had not publicly stated his identity, just his mannerisms said everything.

For Feng Fei, Zhao Ritian, and the others to join forces to attack him, they were clearly after the position of Sovereign. They felt that with Yun Tian present, none of them could become a Sovereign, so he had to be eliminated first.

As for Long Chen, he had never thought of becoming a Sovereign. He just hoped to live happily. If someone else was capable of leading the Martial Heaven Continent to peace, he would be willing to follow them.

However, Zhao Ritian, Feng Fei, and the others had clearly forgotten to be grateful to the Sovereigns. They were actually joining forces against a Sovereign’s descendant. That made Long Chen’s killing intent blaze.

“Perhaps what they wish for is not peace. In their eyes, only becoming a Sovereign is important. In war, although countless people die on the battlefield, that’s just a drop in the ocean compared to the defenseless commoners who die. Greed is the original sin. No tricks are out of the question. Other people’s lives or deaths don’t matter. Perhaps Zhao Ritian and Feng Fei’s thoughts are the thoughts of the divine families. They want to rule this world, even if this world is a war-stricken battlefield of death,” sighed Mo Nian.

Mo Nian patted Long Chen on the shoulder. “Brother, we both don’t have such aspirations, but now you’ve seen reality. If you don’t fight for this, others will kill you. You want to protect your people, but others don’t want to allow you to do so. The Martial Heaven Continent is in chaos, and the divine families’ attitude is still ambiguous. They will sooner or later reveal their fangs. I don’t believe that they’re so kindhearted as to silently pay for the continent’s peace. They have their own glorious history, and it is said that they previously assisted the Sovereigns in battle. However, that is not recorded in history, and the past Sovereigns have never said anything about the divine families. This matter is a complete mystery. The divine families are like leopards watching their prey. When their opportunity ripens, they will pounce.”

Mo Nian had no good feelings toward the divine families. But since Long Chen had a collaborative relationship with the Long family of the divine families, there were some words that he hadn’t said to him.

Now, Mo Nian could no longer hold back. For Zhao Ritian and Feng Fei to not hesitate to attack Yun Tian, there had to be some unspeakable secret behind it.

“I understand. Let’s go,” said Long Chen.

“You’ve thought it through? If Yun Tian is being attacked, will you be capable of unleashing killing blows?” demanded Mo Nian.

“I’ve thought it through. Even against Yu Qingxuan, I won’t have mercy. Enemies are enemies. To be entangled by emotions toward enemies is folly.” Long Chen took a deep breath.

“Alright then.” Mo Nian nodded. If Long Chen was going to go so far, then he was at ease. Otherwise, if Long Chen had his hands tied against Yu Qingxuan once they caught up, they would be sending themselves to their deaths.

The two of them chased down the tracks. Mo Nian suddenly said, “Strange, why are these marks so off? Is Yun Tian simply being attacked without striking back?”

They had yet to see a single mark from Yun Tian. It was as if he was incapable of attacking.

“There’s blood!” Long Chen suddenly pointed to a drop of blood. “It has the aura of darkness. It’s Ye Ming’s blood.”

Ye Ming was in possession of dark energy. His blood was easy to distinguish.

“Then does that mean that Yun Tian is only attacking Ye Ming? Why?” asked Mo Nian.

Yun Tian was being attacked by four peak experts. Theoretically, he should be trying to break free from their siege. After all, all four of them were peerless geniuses. To run was normal.

“Ye Ming definitely has some sinister scheme. That’s why Yun Tian has no choice but to kill him. It seems it isn’t the four of them attacking Yun Tian, but Yun Tian hunting down Ye Ming with the other three helping Ye Ming. Ye Ming is fleeing as he fights off Yun Tian. That’s why these battle scars are so strange,” hypothesized Long Chen.

“No way. Yun Tian is so powerful?” Mo Nian was gobsmacked.

Long Chen’s heart shook. Yes, Yun Tian was truly powerful. However, if he was capable of hunting down Ye Ming while dealing with those three people’s attacks, that was hard to believe.

“Maybe it has something to do with the dragon king essence blood and Sovereign Yun Shang.” Long Chen could only come up with another guess. Sovereign Yun Shang had left Yun Tian the dragon king essence blood, as well as indicated a path for him to walk on the Ghost Ship. Yun Tian had to have his own lucky encounters.

The two of them continued following the tracks, but the more they saw, the more off they felt things to be.

At some point, the sky had started to turn dark. The void was twisting, and the aura of decay and death grew stronger.

“This place is like a cemetery. The smell is a bit familiar.” Mo Nian touched his nose suspiciously. But looking at the scars on the ground, it didn’t seem like they had gotten off track.

Suddenly, the ground beneath their feet exploded. One giant black monster after another crawled out of the ground. They had the bodies of spiders with eight long legs. Their mouths were extremely sharp like the mouthpieces of mosquitos, and their bodies were as big as calves.

“These are Corpse Devouring Armored Spiders! How did they grow so big?!” exclaimed Mo Nian. As an expert archaeologist specialized in digging up ancient tombs, he was knowledgeable about all things fond of living in tombs.

The Corpse Devouring Armored Spider was one of the most frightening lifeforms to live in tombs. Their food was the liquid within corpses.

They also preferred the corpses of powerful lifeforms. Ordinary corpses were unappealing to them.

The bodies of most cultivators remained preserved for many years. Normally, it took hundreds or even over a thousand years before it rotted.

When it rotted, the flesh would undergo a transformation with the blood, and this new liquid was essentially poison. But it was what the Corpse Devouring Armored Spiders lived off of.

Their mouthpieces were exceptionally terrifying. They were like drills, capable of easily piercing the toughest formations and coffins to consume the corpses within.

As a result, the tombs of some famous sects and families always had people guarding them, just to guard against these creatures’ entry.

Once they entered, they would not just consume the corpses. They would lay eggs within the corpses before those ancestral remains were consumed. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Mo Nian was familiar with them, and as a result, he was exceptionally shocked. That was because the Corpse Devouring Armored Spiders that he had seen before were all only the size of a palm. He had never seen one this big.

“Be careful. If you’re bitten by one of these things, it can poison you to death.” Mo Nian had barely finished warning Long Chen when one of the spiders pounced on him. Mo Nian shot an arrow that got stuck in its head. It didn’t pierce all the way through.

Sparks flew when the arrow pierced into its head, as if its head was made of metal. Mo Nian’s arrows were easily capable of piercing mountains, yet it was unable to pierce its head.

“How are they so powerful?!” exclaimed Long Chen and Mo Nian at the same time.

Mo Nian suddenly realized that Long Chen was talking to him, as if he knew. He shouted, “The Corpse Devouring Armored Spiders that I’ve seen are all only the size of a fist. They’re like grandbabies compared to these!”

After Mo Nian killed the first one, the rest of the spiders charged toward the two of them. They were jumping about in the sky, their sharp mouthpieces flickering with a cold light.

Mo Nian repeatedly pulled on his bowstring, unleashing waves of divine light that sent them flying. He managed to create a free space for the two of them.

“When did you learn to play the bowstring?” Long Chen was surprised. Mo Nian had actually gained such a skill.

“Ha, I, Mo Nian, am a master of all skills. Fuck, now isn’t the time. Think of a way to get rid of them!” shouted Mo Nian.

“You’re the expert in these things, you think of a way!” Long Chen pushed the responsibility onto Mo Nian.

As Mo Nian plucked his bowstring, he said, “These things have toxins in their mouthpieces, and their armor is their defense. They have a strong lifeforce with a crystal core and a Neidan. Destroying one will not cause the other to immediately die. If we want them dead, they have to be completely crushed. They aren’t Magical Beasts or demonic beasts. I don’t know how to classify them. That’s all I know, so you think of something!”

Shockingly, more and more Corpse Devouring Armored Spiders appeared in their surroundings. It was unknown where they were coming from, but they were endless.

Long Chen unleashed a slash of his saber, killing a dozen of them in a line. But the rest were simply knocked back, not killed.

Their armor was tough, and their size was small enough that his attacks were unable to unleash their full power. It was like his attack had landed on cotton, causing the cotton to merely split but not break.

“Fuck, this is definitely something Ye Ming left behind to block us.”

Long Chen formed hand seals, and flames began to fill the world.

“Raging Flames Incinerate the Heavens!”
