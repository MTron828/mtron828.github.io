Chapter 4185: Unexpected Violet Blood

A group of people emerged in the distance, appearing to be young experts. There were seventy to eighty of them, and all of them were dressed extravagantly.

To Long Chen’s surprise, they were all Triple Supremes. Even after being in the Sage King Prefecture for so long, he had never seen a faction with so many young Triple Supremes before.

“Long Chen, they…!”

When Luo Bing and Luo Ning saw them, they were particularly shocked and hastily sent Long Chen a message.

“Don’t say anything for now. Let’s just watch first.”

The reason Luo Bing and Luo Ning were so shocked was because they could sense a powerful bloodline resonance with these people. These people were actually part of the Violet Blood race.

However, their Blood Qi was far stronger, and violet divine radiance flowed around them, bestowing upon them a majestic and sacred aura. It was clear that their bloodline was significantly purer than that of the Luo Clan.

As this was Luo Bing and Luo Ning’s first time encountering the Violet Blood race in the outside world, they were incredibly excited. They directly wanted to greet them, but Long Chen stopped them.

Long Chen also sensed this resonance. Although his Spirit Blood had been taken away, in the end, he still had his mother’s bloodline. Violet blood had once flowed through his veins as well.

However, Long Chen had a queer feeling about the appearance of these people. Luo Zichuan had never told Long Chen about their existence. While these people’s violet blood was of high purity, it didn’t reach Luo Zichuan’s level. Furthermore, there seemed to be some slight differences between them and the Luo Clan. But as for what was different, Long Chen was unable to tell.

These people instantly surrounded Long Chen. Their leaders, a divinely handsome man and a peerlessly beautiful woman, advanced toward him. They looked like a golden couple, yet the inherent arrogance they radiated didn't sit well with those around them.

This woman was attracted to the Violet Pupil Nine Tail Fox on Bai Xiaole’s shoulder and was very fascinated by it.

“Hey, are you selling that little fox? Perhaps we can trade other immemorial demonic beasts for it,” said the woman.

The Violet Pupil Nine Tail Fox was still enraged, so for someone to treat it as a housepet for sale, its fury instantly switched targets. “You have a mental illness, don’t you? If you have an illness, treat it. Don’t provoke me here. I’m not in the mood.”

“Oh, what a temper. We’ll see how I treat that!” RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

Feeling enraged, she summoned a violet gold bell in her hand, and violet divine radiance filled the sky.

“An Eternal divine weapon?!”

When this bell appeared, Long Chen and the others couldn’t hide their astonishment. Blood runes flowed on top of the bell, indicating that this was clearly an Eternal divine weapon belonging to their bloodline.

Upon feeling this aura, Long Chen instantly attacked, piercing a spear at the bell.

“Scram!”

As if long since expecting him, the man beside the woman unsheathed his sword, colliding against Long Chen’s spear.

BOOM!

Everyone felt like the Heavenly Daos themselves had detonated, as the violent impact left them gasping for breath and forced them back.

On the other side, both Long Chen and that man grunted and took a few steps back, with each step causing the void to quiver and intense rumbling to resound.

That man’s expression shifted noticeably. He clearly hadn’t expected Long Chen to be so powerful. In that exchange, neither side had gained the upper hand.

Long Chen was equally taken aback. This man’s Blood Qi was astonishing and seamlessly merged with the Heavenly Daos, which meant that he could use Heavenly Dao energy at will, and every single one of his movements was backed by the Heavenly Daos. Other than Luo Zichuan, Long Chen had never encountered someone with such a high level of merger with Heavenly Daos.

At this moment, the Violet Pupil Nine Tail Fox let out a startled cry. Violet runes had appeared on top of its body like a net binding it, and it began to fly toward the bell.

“Release it!”

Bai Xiaole shouted furiously. He swiftly formed hand seals, and a three-flower mark materialized in his eyes.

“Don’t!” Long Chen shouted. The Violet Pupil Nine Tail Fox was now caught by the violet gold bell. If Bai Xiaole rashly tried to pull it back, it would be like smashing his eyes against the bell.

“A dragonfly trying to shake a tree!” The woman sneered mockingly at Bai Xiaole’s efforts.

Buzz.

As the bell shuddered, Bai Xiaole screamed and blood gushed from his eyes.

However, to everyone's astonishment, even in the face of such an injury, Bai Xiaole refused to surrender. With blood streaming from his eyes, he bellowed, "Heavenly Eye Slashes the Cosmos!"

BOOM!

The three flowers then twisted, converging into a single blade. Receiving an impact from it, that woman grunted, her body swaying.

The violet gold bell had caught the Violet Pupil Nine Tail Fox in an invisible hand. Usually, this was a technique with a one-hundred-percent success rate that could catch anything.

However, Bai Xiaole’s pupil art had forcibly severed that invisible hand, crushing her technique and even injuring her soul.

Looking at Bai Xiaole’s bleeding eyes, Long Chen was enraged, his killing intent exploding out of him.

“Long Chen, don’t!”

Seeing that gaze, Luo Bing and Luo Ning were horrified. With their understanding of Long Chen, they knew that a massacre was about to occur.

Luo Bing and Luo Ning grabbed his elbows, afraid of him attacking. If he were to attack, there would no longer be any room to talk.

“You idiot! Do you not want your life anymore?!” The Violet Pupil Nine Tail Fox flew back to Bai Xiaole’s side and cursed him furiously. Bai Xiaole’s eyes were covered in cracks, on the verge of shattering.

“They were going to take you away! I know I have no ability, and you’ve suffered by having to stay with me. So, the least I can do is go all-out for you!” said Bai Xiaole.

Bai Xiaole was currently blind, and his eyes burned like they were on fire. However, there was a rather foolish smile on his face now, a smile of remarkable innocence.

“You…” The Violet Pupil Nine Tail Fox was speechless. It seemed both vexed and moved.

“Long Chen, don’t! We can talk this through!” begged Luo Bing as she held onto Long Chen.

Bai Shishi was also blazing with killing intent. Her hand already turned gold, and her icy killing intent locked onto that woman.

Bai Xiaole was her little brother. Although the two didn’t get along well normally, for Bai Xiaole to be injured triggered a burning rage in her.

“Xin-er, what happened? Who dares to make things hard on my Violet Blood’s Xu family? Whose guts are that big?”

Just as Long Chen was hesitating about whether to kill this woman as revenge for Bai Xiaole, an enormous ship covered the sky.
