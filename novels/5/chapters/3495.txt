Chapter 3484

The instant Long Chen was sent out, he saw Bai Fang and Bai Rui. At some point, they had appeared beside that elder.

At that moment, Long Chen felt a sharp pain inside. His first thought was that they had sold him out.

However, he quickly noticed that he was wrong. Their shocked expressions showed that they had no idea what was going on.

BOOM!

The center of the whirlpool had a terrifying force inside of it. Anyone who was sucked inside would be instantly crushed. Hence, Long Chen didn’t hesitate. He slashed his saber, and space exploded. He interrupted his spatial transportation midway.

But the other experts were instantly sent to the core of the whirlpool. They were horrified, but they couldn’t even scream. That was because they couldn’t even move a muscle.

Following that, an invisible power tore apart their bodies. They were sucked inside silently, as if some invisible mouth simply devoured them.

There were millions of cultivators in the low and middle levels. Other than Long Chen, they were all gone now. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

As for where Long Chen had ended up, he was not too far from the core of the whirlpool. It had a terrifying suction force that was dragging him toward it.

“What are you doing?! Didn’t you say that if I gave you the treasure, you would let off big brother Long Chen? How can the grand Soaring Dragon Company lie to and cheat people?!”

Bai Fang roared with outrage.

The elder clapped him on the back of his head, instantly knocking him unconscious. Seeing this, Bai Rui screamed and supported her big brother, only to be kicked and lose consciousness as well.

Long Chen instantly understood. It was no wonder that he had felt Bai Fang’s expression to be a bit odd. So he had given his treasure to the Soaring Dragon Company. Bai Fang had been deceived.

“Soaring Dragon Company, you are courting death.” Long Chen clenched his teeth so hard that they creaked. This Soaring Dragon Company was absolutely despicable. Long Chen resisted the powerful suction force and began to walk out.

“Truly amazing. Even the Fiend Devil Eye that a Divine Venerate would be somewhat afraid of is being resisted by you. You truly have some ability. However, you shouldn’t have provoked my Soaring Dragon Company. Die in peace. In your next life, remember to pay attention to who you can offend and who you can’t!” sneered the elder.

After that, the ship lit up and a giant ray of divine light shot toward Long Chen. The immense force caused the void to rumble and unleashed huge waves on the sea.

BOOM!

Long Chen was enraged and unleashed Split the Heavens, blasting apart that attack. But due to the force, he was knocked back several steps. In just that short distance, the suction force grew even more terrifying.

“Amazing. You can even block such an attack. Even I cannot do such a thing, but you are able to do so at such a young age. It seems that my decision was correct. If we were to fight you directly, we wouldn’t be a match for you. Such a shame. In the end, you will still die.” That elder shook his head and waved his hand once more. The ship attacked again.

BOOM!

Long Chen was forced back once more, his qi flipping inside of him.

The most enraging thing was that every step back he took caused the suction force to crazily grow. Before this, he was capable of walking out of it. But now, it was difficult to even keep himself steady.

“Big brother Long Chen, we’ve let you down. If there is another life, we promise we will repay your favor. They conned my Bai family’s priceless treasure out, but they don’t know how to activate it, so it’s useless for them. Now, I will transmit the activation method to you. You must help avenge us.”

At some point, Bai Fang had awoken, holding his little sister. Blue flames then wrapped around his body. His expression was determined.

“Don’t!”

Long Chen was horrified. Bai Fang was actually going to transform into the Dao together with his little sister. He had ignited his and Bai Rui’s spiritual flames. This signified that not even a god could save him.

“Stop!”

The elder also cried out and reached toward them. But the two of them instantly turned to dust. Following that, some information appeared in Long Chen’s mind.

Bai Fang had used his and his sister’s spiritual flames to transmit information to Long Chen. They vanished from this world due to this.

When this information entered his mind, he learned that when the ship was attacked by the sea demons, the elder stealthily told Bai Fang that for them to kill Long Chen was as easy as turning a hand.

They only wanted Bai Fang’s treasure. Moreover, Bai Fang was truly too pure. If it was his own life, perhaps he wouldn’t even care about this threat.

But thinking of how such a heroic figure like Long Chen would be killed because of him, he felt like even ten thousand deaths wouldn’t make up for his sin.

Thus, he agreed, giving the treasure to the elder in exchange for letting off Long Chen, as well as the two of them.

However, he hadn’t expected that just after he gave them the treasure, the Soaring Dragon Company would renege on their deal.

In that instant, all of Bai Fang’s hopes turned to dust. He was nothing more than a tiny figure. He thought that an existence as grand as the Soaring Dragon Company would definitely keep their promises. But he was once more made a fool out of by reality.

He knew that when the Soaring Dragon Company realized they couldn’t activate that treasure, they would definitely torture the two of them. Then they would be living a life worse than death.

With his hope extinguished, the dejected Bai Fang directly killed himself along with his little sister, leaving this world full of regrets, this world that had let them feel the warmth but also extreme coldness.

“Soaring Dragon Company, you butchers!”

Long Chen raised his head and roared. As his killing intent exploded, he was like a bloodthirsty devil king.

“Go kill yourself!” The elder was also enraged and activated the formation repeatedly, sending one attack after another at Long Chen. Despite going all-out, Long Chen was still sucked into the whirlpool.

Seeing that Long Chen was gone, the elder darkly gave orders. He hadn’t expected Bai Fang to actually have a backup. Now that he was dead, this priceless treasure couldn’t be activated. They would have to think of something.

The ship slowly left, vanishing within the night. As for the giant whirlpool, it continued to spin just as it had for all this time…

…

Long Chen was sucked into the whirlpool. Now, his fury was blazing. He resisted the whirlpool with all his power, but it was too strong. His body creaked. He was actually in danger of being crushed.

This whirlpool seemed to be the spot where two worlds were clashing. It could crush anything, and Long Chen was left bloody.

“Soaring Dragon Company, just wait for me to get out of here! I’ll slaughter all of you!” roared Long Chen.

Just then, countless tentacles stretched out of the whirlpool. However, just as they were about to get close to Long Chen, a startled cry rang out.

“The Ghost Sovereign’s mark? What a pity! This top grade flesh and blood can only be looked at but not eaten.”

Just as Long Chen thought that he was about to die, a force sent him flying out of the whirlpool.

Once he was out, he just happened to see the last light of the ship. Without thinking about it, he flew off in that direction.

“Fuck, Boss Long San will kill all of you!” Long Chen clenched his teeth, his eyes blazing with killing intent.
