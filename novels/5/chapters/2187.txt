Chapter 2177 Guo Ran vs. Shi Lingfeng

“What? Are we really just going to watch?” Qu Jianying looked back at the old man and sent him a message.

The old man looked at Yu Xiaoyun and the others. He replied, “It’s fine. That little fellow must have the confidence to say such things. Also, do you see that Yu Xiaoyun and the others aren’t joining in? We should just wait and keep an eye on them. Old against old, young against young. We’ll see who loses patience first.”

At this time, Li Tianxuan had led people to occupy a large qi flow stream. He chose a very suitable stream. It wasn’t so huge that it was the most contested, but it could enter the top ten.

“Has there been some mistake? Are we even men? Why aren’t we fighting?” demanded Bao Buping and Chang Hao.

“Little bastards, who do you think you’re talking to?!” raged Boss Bao, sending a kick their way. But they dodged.

“Don’t think that just because you’re older, we don’t dare to sort you out! None of you are real men! We are life-and-death brothers with Long Chen, so no matter what, we’re going!” declared Bao Buping.

“Don’t take another step, or I’ll break your leg!” shouted Boss Bao.

“Just try it!” Bao Buping and Chang Hao ignored him.

The other disciples of the Heaven Splitting Battle Sect shouted, “Anyone with a tool down there, follow me! We’ll fight together with Long Chen!”

“Brat, you dare? If you go, you will no longer be a disciple of the Heaven Splitting Battle Sect!” declared Boss Bao. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

“So what? Starting today, we’re joining the Dragonblood Legion! Brothers, let’s go!”

Bao Buping waved his hand, leading thousands of the Heaven Splitting Battle Sect’s disciples to Long Chen’s side.

“Bastards, get back here!” shouted Boss Bao.

The Seventh Boss patted Boss Bao’s shoulder, quietly saying, “That’s about enough. You’re not good at acting. It’s so fake that I’m getting embarrassed just watching.”

“It’s true. You should say less. I’m getting goosebumps,” added the Fourth Boss.

“You...” Boss Bao almost coughed up blood.

The old man was standing beside Qu Jianying now. He couldn’t tell the Heaven Splitting Battle Sect’s disciples to join Long Chen, or that would be taken as not listening to orders. However, the disciples of the Heaven Splitting Battle Sect couldn’t possibly just watch considering their relationship with Long Chen.

The disciples were definitely going. They just needed a reason, resulting in Boss Bao putting on an act of not being able to look after these children. But this act was a bit too fake.

Bao Buping and Chang Hao brought the Heaven Splitting Battle Sect’s disciples over to Long Chen’s side, but the battle had already begun.

Shi Lingfeng and the Stone race’s experts were the first to arrive. Shi Lingfeng’s one eye shone fiercely.

“Long Chen, I’ve mastered the Stone Emperor’s divine arts! Today, I’ll show you my Stone race’s true divine abilities!” Shi Lingfeng smashed a fist forward. A giant fist-image appeared, sparkling like a sky of stars.

“The Stone Emperor’s paragon art, the Star Falling Fist! That was the paragon art that Shi Changsheng created himself based on the Stone race’s bodies.” Quite a few experts of the senior generation were stunned by this attack.

Long Chen snorted. He was about to attack when Guo Ran stepped forward. “There’s no need to waste your energy on this trash, boss. I’ll kill this dog!”

Guo Ran shot away, his body instantly becoming covered in blood-colored armor. Various runes lit up on his armor as he unleashed his own punch.

Long Chen had never seen Guo Ran in this armor. It seemed that his armor had evolved greatly during this time. There were two small wings on his sides, as well as a curved horn on the top of his head. His shoulders were protected by two dragon heads, his elbows had sharp points on the ends, and there were a pair of wings on his back. The feather-like marks along his wings made them look like wings made of metal feathers. Those wings were made based on the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow race’s wing structure because Guo Ran wanted to imitate their speed.

“What a dogshit paragon art! Watch as I, Guo Ran, break it with a single punch!”

“Who do you think you are to fight me? Face your death!” raged Shi Lingfeng, feeling insulted that Long Chen had sent a subordinate out against him.

BOOM!

Guo Ran’s fist smashed into Shi Lingfeng’s attack without any flashiness. Shi Lingfeng’s attack simply crumbled, unleashing a wave of ripples that made space twist.

As for Guo Ran, he remained in his original location, not having been forced back a single step. He was still in his punching posture.

“What is going on?”

“I didn’t even see how he countered that terrifying attack.”

“His aura fluctuations and Blood Qi fluctuations are practically nonexistent. There’s no world energy, and it wasn’t a magical art, so... this was all the power of his armor? Is he someone from the Mechanism Sect?”

“Could it be that Long Chen’s subordinate was able to master all the Mechanism Sect’s mechanism arts after its destruction?”

Guo Ran slowly stood up straight. Clasping his hands behind him, he arrogantly said, “The Stone Emperor’s paragon art? If I had known it would be so weak, I wouldn’t have even punched. I would have just farted and dispelled it.”

Long Chen silently gave Guo Ran a thumbs-up inside. He was truly a marvel. That punch just now had tricked everyone.

That was no punch. Guo Ran had activated a cylinder in his wrist to unleash a weapon to destroy Shi Lingfeng’s attack.

Long Chen felt that burst of power to be a bit familiar, and now he recalled that it was the power of the Mechanism Sect’s God Extermination Cannon.

However, Guo Ran had somehow modified the power. It wasn’t as strong as the God Extermination Cannon, but it could be activated very quickly. He liked acting, and he was good at it, so it looked like he had unleashed a casual punch to destroy Shi Lingfeng’s attack, shocking everyone.

Long Chen had no choice but to admit that when it came to mechanisms, Guo Ran was truly a monster. But what made him speechless was that because Guo Ran liked showing off so much, he had actually made it so that when he spoke, his armor amplified his voice, making it sound even more arrogant.

“What a fart!” Shi Lingfeng furiously stamped forward, recovering from his shock. Multiple figures of him appeared in the sky, appearing in front of Guo Ran in an instant.

His speed shocked everyone. The Stone race’s power was renowned, but their speed was supposed to be lacking in comparison. They had never seen someone from the Stone race possessing such speed.

“Alright, as you wish!”

Guo Ran didn’t even look at Shi Lingfeng. Lazily stretching, he turned and bent. Runes lit up on his armor as he pointed his butt at Shi Lingfeng.

A powerful boom ripped through the air. A ray of divine light shot out, followed by raging flames.

Shi Lingfeng couldn’t even unleash his attack before he was sent flying by that explosion. He tumbled back, only stopping when he was caught by several of the Stone race’s experts.

A powerful qi wave spread through the air. This attack’s power was even greater than Guo Ran’s punch.

However, no one marveled at its power. Instead, they stared oddly at the ripples, some people even unconsciously covering their noses and backing up. Looking at the miserable Shi Lingfeng, they were shocked.

“As expected, the leader raises similar troops. No wonder the Dragonblood Legion calls Long Chen boss. The boss isn’t normal, and his subordinates aren’t normal either,” said Beitang Rushuang within a stream of qi flow. She rolled her eyes. Was there a single normal person in the Dragonblood Legion?

“I can flatten you with just a fart. Now, do you believe it?” Guo Ran deliberately shook his butt a few times before standing back up.

“Bastard!” Shi Lingfeng roared. The Stone race’s experts that had caught him were thrown into the distance. The runes on his body suddenly split down the middle, opening like eyes, revealing crystals.

Those crystals were like the stars in the sky. His runes connected to each other like chains, pulsing energy throughout his body like blood vessels.

Upon taking a single step, the void collapsed. Shi Lingfeng’s aura had grown explosively, and he shot at Guo Ran like a shooting star.

“I’ll tear you to pieces!” Shi Lingfeng seemed to have become a blazing star. His arms stretched toward Guo Ran.

“Shi Lingfeng has gone insane! He’s even offering up the qi of his true spirit! This is equivalent to burning his essence blood!” said someone heavily. The current Shi Lingfeng was displaying the greatest power of one of the ancient era’s supreme geniuses.

“I’ll only need one hand to handle you.”

Guo Ran kept one hand behind him, while a blood-colored saber appeared in his other hand.
