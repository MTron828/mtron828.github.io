Chapter 2377 Who is Conning Who?

Translator: BornToBe

“Has Ye Lingfeng gone mad?! If we all die here, he won’t be getting out alive either!” Shen Chengfeng was shocked and enraged that Ye Lingfeng would do such a thing.

They saw Ye Lingfeng dragging a giant dragon-shaped flying boat with his three war chariots.

This flying boat was the divine families’ supreme killing item, the Divine Dragon Tyrant Crossbow.

The body of the boat was the body of the crossbow, while the two wings were the arms. The string was dozens of meters thick. There were giant arrows constantly being fired.

Every time the string quivered, a giant arrow would pierce through the void. It didn’t matter what cultivation base the demonic beasts had, they would still be blasted apart.

This was a weapon capable of even killing Heaven Elders. It was an extremely important treasure and also the strongest trump card of the third legion. But it was so huge that it required three war chariots just to move it.

Every shot of it was incredibly expensive. Even if the eighth legion had one, they couldn’t afford to use it.

It was the sight of the Divine Dragon Tyrant Crossbow that infuriated Shen Chengfeng the most. Ye Lingfeng actually wanted them all dead.

Ye Lingfeng sneered. He saw Long Chen and the others surrounded by the demonic beasts. “Stop shooting. There’s no need to waste more arrows.” 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Suddenly, the earth exploded and a giant bubble of light appeared in a certain spot. The chariots pulled into the bubble and space began to twist. This was actually a giant transportation formation capable of being set up within the Ancient Battlefield.

Ye Lingfeng had clearly come prepared. Due to the size of the Divine Dragon Tyrant Crossbow, they couldn’t move that far with the formation, but it would definitely be enough to get out of sight.

Despite the short range, just this one formation had come at an incredible price. Ye Lingfeng had truly put down the capital to eliminate Long Chen and the eighth legion.

“Long Chen, just let me properly enjoy the sight of you dying,” sneered Ye Lingfeng.

“What is that?” Suddenly, the second commander pointed out the tower that Long Chen was on.

“It’s used for sending messages. Who are they trying to message?”

“No, it’s pointed right at us!”

BOOM!

The tower lit up, and an arrow tore through space. As it got close to them, it suddenly exploded into multicolored powder like a beautiful firework.

“It seems different from the fluctuations of a distress signal. What are they doing?”

“Ignore them. Activate the transportation formation,” ordered Ye Lingfeng. He also felt that something was a bit off.

“Commander, the surrounding spatial fluctuations have changed. The formation is unable to activate!” cried the second commander suddenly.

The transportation formation quivered a few times when he tried to activate it, but nothing else happened.

“Long Chen must have set this up. He broke our transportation formation. We dug our own graves.” The third commander quickly fell into despair. This meant that they were doomed.

The second commander kept trying, roaring, “That arrow contained spatial chaos dust! We won’t be able to use the transportation formation temporarily.”

“How long?” demanded Ye Lingfeng.

“At least an hour. But the demonic beasts we drew over will arrive within a minute. Then the formation will still be useless as their attacks will disrupt space.” The second commander also fell into despair.

At this moment, furious roars suddenly rang out. Ye Lingfeng was shocked to find that somehow, Long Chen and the eighth legion had vanished. As for the demonic beasts that had surrounded them, having lost their target, they now cut the third legion off at the rear.

“Bastards, they definitely used the hidden transportation formation set up underground!” raged Ye Lingfeng.

The camps had secret formations set up underground. Those formations had been built up for hundreds of years. Even if the camp was lost, the demonic beasts wouldn’t know the secret entrance to those formations, so they could only destroy the buildings aboveground.

There was a secret transportation formation underground, but it was not to be used unless there was no other choice. If it was activated, it would expose the secret of the formations underground.

However, today, Shen Chengfeng had activated it, bringing everyone away. They had also destroyed the entrance.

The demonic beasts hadn’t even understood what was happening. They had just felt a powerful explosion that had killed the ones closest to the camp before Long Chen and the others had vanished without a trace.

A strange scent hung in the air after the explosion. Any demonic beast that smelled it would start becoming violent. Their eyes reddened, and without any considerations, they charged over at Ye Lingfeng and the others.

“Have the three chariots surround the Divine Dragon Tyrant Crossbow! We’ll set up our defenses here. Send out distress calls for aid!” shouted Ye Lingfeng.

It was too late to run. If the Divine Dragon Tyrant Crossbow was pointed in the direction of the camp, then by using its power, he was eighty percent confident in being able to charge through.

Unfortunately, it was pointing in the wrong direction, and with its giant body, turning it around would take more than the few seconds that they had before their enemies arrived.

They had no choice but to endure here and hope for reinforcements. Ye Lingfeng quickly gave orders. “Transfer the Divine Dragon Tyrant Crossbow’s power to the war chariots. It’s no longer useful.”

The Divine Dragon Tyrant Crossbow began to blaze with light. That light poured into the three chariots.

The chariots rumbled. Runic swords shot out, slaughtering the approaching demonic beasts.

Using the chariots, they formed a domain of death for the demonic beasts. However, there were still cracks between the chariots that were covered by the third legion’s warriors. They couldn’t allow the demonic beasts to charge through to the Divine Dragon Tyrant Crossbow.

The Divine Dragon Tyrant Crossbow was currently their greatest source of power. If it was broken, then just the three chariots alone would not last even an incense stick’s worth of time before running out of energy.

“Brothers, endure! The distress signal has been sent out, and we’ve received a reply that people will come save us!” shouted Ye Lingfeng.

The divine families would send word to the other experts in the Ancient Battlefield to come assist them as soon as they received the distress signal. They only had to endure until those reinforcements arrived.

Unfortunately, enduring until then was not easy. These demonic beasts were attacking crazily without fear for their own lives.

“These demonic beasts, did they take the wrong medicine?! Why are they so crazy?!”

The third legion’s warriors were all green with fright due to the crazy demonic beasts.

“It feels off. They’ve become far more violent than they usually are!”

These demonic beasts were just foolishly charging up to the chariots, completely ignoring the runic swords blasting out of them. After the first wave died, the second wave would take its place. There was no end to them.

“Fuck, it’s definitely something Long Chen did!” Ye Lingfeng clenched his teeth furiously. Although he didn’t know what had happened, he was sure that he had been schemed against by Long Chen again.

“Commander, Long Chen and the others have returned!”

Through the cracks between the tide of demonic beasts, the third legion could see the camp. What they saw made their heads almost explode. Long Chen and the eighth legion were currently in the process of setting up their defenses.

Once everything was set up there, they could reactivate the formations to restore the camp to the way it was before. Then the demonic beasts would find it extremely difficult to break through again.

The reason that it had been broken through last time was because Shen Chengfeng and the majority of the eighth legion’s warriors had been forced to guard the Yin Yang World, while someone else had lured a mass of demonic beasts over.

In truth, the eighth legion’s camp was stronger than the seventh legion’s because the eighth legion was so weak. As a result, the defensive camp was their trump card that protected their lives.

That was also why they had become such a joke after losing it. For them to lose even with such a powerful defensive trump card was a humiliation.

Now, Long Chen was standing on top of the new buildings with a bright smile. Beside him Shen Chengfeng said, “I never imagined that we could take back our camp without spilling a single drop of blood.”

All they had done was charge into the camp, unleash an arrow, charge underground, set off an explosion, and then use the formation to return to their second camp.

When they returned, the demonic beasts were ignoring them and crazily attacking Ye Lingfeng. They could enjoy that sight as they rebuilt their camp.

“They’ve spotted us,” said Shen Chengfeng.

“It’s curious,” said Long Chen.

“What’s curious?”

“Their gazes don’t seem too friendly. It’s so puzzling.”

“Yes… it really is puzzling…”

Shen Chengfeng and Long Chen exchanged a glance and burst into laughter.
