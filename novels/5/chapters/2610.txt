Chapter 2599 Spirits Cry, Ghosts Weep

With Sovereign Zi Yang beside him, Long Chen instantly became arrogant. He clasped his hands behind him, looking down on Ye Ming.

Ye Ming stared at Sovereign Zi Yang in terror. He knew exactly who he was. It was precisely because he knew who Sovereign Zi Yang was that he was so terrified.

“No need to worry, my big brother won’t bother with you. Come, let me see what improvements you’ve made during this time,” said Long Chen. He was extremely satisfied by Ye Ming’s reaction.

“You are unable to beat him in this place. Resentful Death City’s resentful spirits are under his command, and he has already opened his death spirit eyes. Although he hasn’t brought out its full potential yet, it’s no problem to control a few Heaven Merging resentful spirits. They’re extremely powerful,” warned Sovereign Zi Yang.

Long Chen’s heart shook. This fellow’s eyes were called the death spirit eyes? Was his dark energy specifically cultivated to open his death spirit eyes so that he could control the resentful spirits here?

At this moment, Sovereign Zi Yang pressed a finger against the powerful barrier, which then shuddered and shattered.

This terrifying barrier was as flimsy as a piece of paper in front of a Sovereign.

Ye Ming’s figure sank into the altar, vanishing from sight.

“He fled?” Long Chen was astonished. He felt like Sovereign Zi Yang wouldn’t bother killing Ye Ming. He would disdain doing so.

“He went to call reinforcements. Long Chen, watch closely. Your future enemy is about to appear,” said Sovereign Zi Yang.

Reinforcements? Long Chen was startled, but before he could react, black qi suddenly whirled out of the altar; an aura full of darkness, decay, and death filled the air. Just breathing in this scent could make a person feel like they had aged a thousand years and grown weak. Therefore, Long Chen hastily blocked the aura outside of his body.

“Zi Yang, I didn’t expect to see you again. Hehe, but it seems that you’re nothing more than a strand of a discarnate soul. What can you possibly do?”

An icy voice rang out from within the black qi, and a figure slowly appeared. It was an old man who looked like a withered corpse. His skin was black, his robes were black, and he was holding a bone cane with a skull on top.

The skull was only the size of a fist but had three faces, looking like a human skull that had been shrunk. Moreover, bewitching ghost flames flickered inside the eye sockets, and just a glance at those ghost flames made Long Chen almost fall unconscious. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

With just a glance, the majority of his Spiritual Strength vanished.

“Excellent, you were able to escape the soul binds of the Six Eye Demon Pupils without any help. Your mental energy is very powerful,” praised Sovereign Zi Yang.

Long Chen was unable to feel any joy over this praise. Just who was this terrifying elder? Without initiating any attack, just a look at that skull was enough to exhaust the majority of Long Chen’s Spiritual Strength and almost make him fall unconscious. The difference was as great as heaven and earth.

Furthermore, he seemed to recognize Sovereign Zi Yang. Could it be that he…?

Turning back to the strange elder, Sovereign Zi Yang smiled slightly. “Even if I’m just a discarnate soul, I will not forget the blessing of heaven and earth’s nurturing. I still need to do my utmost to repay this debt. I didn’t expect that after killing you, the slightest trace of your discarnate soul would escape. Your Death Spirit race’s divine abilities are truly worthy of admiration.”

As expected. Long Chen’s heart pounded. No wonder he was so terrifying. So this was the expert that had fought against Sovereign Zi Yang for three days and nights back then.

“The Death Spirit race can protect their souls even when killed as long as we are in a place with death spiritual qi. Even a broken soul can be reformed and recovered into a Yuan Spirit. Although I no longer have a body, I am still alive. As for you, the mighty Sovereign Zi Yang, you are only left with a trace of a discarnate soul. You’ll quickly vanish from this world, hahaha!” The elder laughed, seemingly rejoicing in his victory.

Back then, Sovereign Zi Yang had killed him, but he had used the laws of this place to be reborn, while Sovereign Zi Yang only had this discarnate soul left. That could definitely be considered a kind of victory.

“You are working with Ye Ming because you lack a physical body? Did you want to possess him when the time comes?” sneered Long Chen.

The elder then turned to Long Chen, tightening Long Chen’s nerves instantly. It felt as if all his weaknesses were exposed before him. His soul shuddered, however, this time he was prepared, and he didn’t leave any hole in his mental defenses.

The elder smiled sinisterly, a dark smile appearing on his withered face. “The sixth-generation Sovereign? It doesn’t look like it. His inner heart is just as dark as ours. He’s nothing more than a hypocrite. Is this your successor? It seems that the Martial Heaven Continent has truly declined.”

“Even if it has declined, I’m still more than enough to kill your successor. If we were in the same realm, I’d be able to beat the crap out of you,” retorted Long Chen. This old man had managed to provoke him with just a few words.

“You don’t have much patience or eloquence. Let this old man give you a lesson,” the elder snorted. His palm suddenly slammed toward Long Chen, and darkness covered the world in an instant. As a result, Long Chen’s divine sense was sealed, and he couldn’t even sense Sovereign Zi Yang’s existence.

BOOM!

A loud explosion rang out in Long Chen’s ears, but it felt as if it came from a distant world. Long Chen was startled. Within the endless darkness, he felt like he had lost his connection to the rest of the world. He felt like a blind man who had entered a battlefield.

“You can deceive my senses but not my intuition.” Long Chen suddenly slammed a hand forward, and lightning burst out of his palm.

In an instant, the darkness around him exploded as the lightning returned light to the world. Long Chen’s hand viciously struck the elder’s face.

As a result, the elder was sent flying. When Long Chen’s vision returned, he saw Sovereign Zi Yang standing calmly beside eight giant figures. After that, those eight figures slowly broke apart, seemingly broken by Sovereign Zi Yang.

“If you want to target him, do it directly. Are you afraid that I would help him?” Sovereign Zi Yang looked at the elder of the Death Spirit race and shook his head.

The instant the elder had rushed out, Sovereign Zi Yang had also attacked. Their clash resulted in the explosion that Long Chen had heard. At the very least, Sovereign Zi Yang knew that the elder wouldn’t kill Long Chen for various reasons, just like Sovereign Zi Yang wouldn’t kill Ye Ming.

Regretfully, the elder had underestimated Long Chen. His mental domain was unable to seal Long Chen’s instincts, and even Sovereign Zi Yang hadn’t expected this exchange to end in such a way.

A behemoth of the Death Spirit race had been slapped in the face by Long Chen. Sovereign Zi Yang felt it to be shocking and comical. Even in his three days of fighting against the elder, he had been unable to pull off such an astonishing thing.

“Courting death!” The elder instantly flew into a rage and waved his bone cane. In that instant, Long Chen felt like his eardrums were being torn apart. Wails and shrieks filled the air like a tsunami, and he almost fainted.

BOOM!

Sovereign Zi Yang interfered once more. Suddenly, a ray of rainbow light streaked through the air, and a peaceful aura suppressed the shrieks.

Although the voices were still present and raging furiously, they were unable to affect Long Chen to the same extent any longer.

“You actually use the Spirits Cry, Ghosts Weep sound on a member of the junior generation. It seems that you haven’t made any improvements after all these years.” Sovereign Zi Yang shook his head in disappointment.

“Stupid human race, you’re a group of hypocrites. You act so high and mighty, when all you are is a mix of contradictions. You’re freaks of right and wrong. Although I was defeated back then, I still refuse to accept that I’m inferior. I will personally destroy the Martial Heaven Continent and hunt down your human race to extinction!” cursed the elder furiously.

It was as if Sovereign Zi Yang’s disappointment in him was gravely insulting. After that, his cane lit up, and giant dragons appeared out of the darkness.

Those giant dragons unleashed an ancient aura like they were divine beasts that had walked out of legends, causing countless thin cracks to appear in the void as if they were moving through ice. It was as though the world was unable to endure their power.

“Long Chen, look closely. This is the special power of the Death Spirit race. They can summon lifeforms from other worlds. These lifeforms are sometimes bred and raised by them, while some are captured and tamed, a bit similar to the Beast Tamers of the continent. However, these lifeforms can freely transform between the state of real and illusory with their death spiritual qi, making them harder to deal with. His original steed was already killed by me, so these lifeforms were most likely raised by him after that. Their auras are extremely weak.”

This was weak? Long Chen felt a chill. The power of every one of these black dragons was equivalent to a full-power Heaven Merging expert.

“Time is running out. I cannot show you more of their divine abilities, so I’ll kill him again to win you some time.” A violet sun rose behind Sovereign Zi Yang as he spoke. In that instant, the Sovereign might filled the world.
