Chapter 3542

Long Chen’s roar seemed to have prodded a beehive, so countless people fled for their lives. That loud sound would definitely disturb all the Heavenly Flame Spirits.

However, after running, they found that although many of the Heavenly Flame Spirits had moved, there was nothing else. They were still absorbing the runes.

“This bastard! Just wait, I’ll definitely kill you sooner or later!”

People were enraged. Instead of absorbing the flame runes himself, Long Chen just made it so that others didn’t absorb them. It was absolutely hateful. Most importantly, with Long Chen here, who dared to relax and absorb the runes?

Only some brazen people saw some clues. The Heavenly Flame Spirits here viewed absorbing these flame runes as the highest priority and were ignoring them. Even the ruckus that Long Chen made didn’t stop them. That signified that as long as they didn’t attack, there would be no danger.

As a result, people started to emulate Long Chen, starting to climb to the waist of the mountain. However, they were far more careful than him when they got close to those Heavenly Flame Spirits. They didn’t even dare to make any big movements.

As they had guessed, these Heavenly Flame Spirits continued to ignore them. Furthermore, absorbing the flame runes here was even more effective.

These currents of lava had been flowing for a while. As time passed, the runes inside them diminished. Even so, these people got to absorb even more now.

However, they were very cautious, merely absorbing from this outer edge and not daring to enter deeper. That was because if they went any deeper, they would have no chance of escaping if something happened.

Most importantly, they were afraid of Long Chen. In their eyes, Long Chen was a madman constantly courting death in flashy ways. No one knew when he would go crazy again. If those Heavenly Flame Spirits were really enraged by Long Chen, they would be implicated and would also die. That would be too aggrieving of a death.

Those who had managed to come here were all powerful experts. They dared to eat food right out of the tiger’s mouth because they all had confidence in themselves. But there was a difference between confidence and madness.

“Should we go to the mouth as well?” Wu Yang looked at Long Chen who was standing on the head of a Heavenly Flame Spirit, peering into the mouth of the volcano. He seemed lost in thought.

“We can’t. This bastard has too many treacherous tricks. He might be intentionally baiting us over. When we go, he’ll unleash an attack that enrages all the Heavenly Flame Spirits. Being attacked by so many fifth Heavenstage World King Heavenly Flame Spirits is too dangerous,” said Zhao Mingxuan.

Last time, he was already conned by Long Chen. A fifth Heavenstage Heavenly Flame Spirit had attacked him with all its power. If he hadn’t had a divine item to protect him, he would already be dead.

Now that he saw Long Chen again, he wanted to tear him apart. But he didn’t let his anger overwhelm his head. Having been conned, he had experience. He felt that it was better to be safer. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Other people were being careful, but Long Chen wasn’t the slightest bit worried. Ever since receiving Aunt Gong’s reminder and being bestowed the golden lotus seed, he seemed to have returned to the Long Chen that had first set out on a journey with Little Snow, the time when he was heading to the Xuantian Monastery. He had been full of confidence in himself, feeling himself to be capable of anything. He didn’t know what fear was.

He had returned to his brazen character, doing whatever he wanted.

After scaring everyone with a roar, he climbed up on the head of a bull-shaped Heavenly Flame Spirit. From its head, he peered down and found that the volcano was like a gushing spring. Lava was constantly coming from below.

At the core of this spring was a giant egg-shaped rock that was constantly rolling. That rock was covered in strange marks.

“Huo Linger, that seems to be the legendary Heavenly Flame Crystal. But its shape isn’t quite the same. Take a look,” said Long Chen.

Huo Longer transformed into a flame dragon and carefully swam through the lava and toward that rock. She quickly sent back a delighted transmission.

“Big brother Long Chen, it really is a Heavenly Flame Crystal. The fluctuations are the exact same, but the Heavenly Flame Crystals are inside this rock. I can sense many of them, yet I can’t absorb them without breaking the rock.”

Suddenly, that giant rock sank down. Huo Linger was startled and moved to grab it.

“Don’t rush. Use your split bodies to investigate the situation underground,” said Long Chen.

Huo Linger immediately transformed into hundreds of small flame dragons that swam beneath the core of the volcano. After a while, she sent back an overjoyed message.

“Big brother Long Chen, there are these rocks everywhere down below! Hundreds of them! Many of them are actually scattered Heavenly Flame Crystals.”

Heavenly Flame Crystals were crystals condensed from Heavenly Flame energy. They only existed in legends. Although Long Chen had read countless books, he still knew very little about them.

Very quickly, Huo Linger returned and Long Chen saw a fist-sized blood-colored crystal in her hand. It was pure flame energy inside. A single crystal was just like a small volcano. If it was detonated, its power would be astonishing.

“Huo Linger, what’s wrong?” Long Chen suddenly sensed an oddity in Huo Linger’s spiritual fluctuations.

“I suddenly feel a wave of dizziness. The lava’s flame energy seems… to be toxic,” said Huo Linger, a bit unsure.

Toxic?

Long Chen looked at the motionless Heavenly Flame Spirits around him and instantly understood.

“It seems that these fellows are being poisoned as they absorb this energy. They are absorbing it while resolving the toxins. That’s why they are ignoring me unless their lives are threatened.”

Huo Linger was also a spiritual body and could be poisoned just like these Heavenly Flame Spirits. But the human race was different. They were only absorbing the purest essence of these flames. It was slower, but any parts that could harm them were rejected.

On the other hand, a spiritual body consumed energy in great gulps, using their body to expel the parts that could harm them. This was why they could be poisoned.

After thinking it through, Long Chen said, “I’ll merge my Spiritual Strength with you and deal with the poison. You can then take the Phoenix Blood Heavenly Silk Net down and dredge up the Heavenly Flame Crystals. We have to take all the treasures before those fellows notice.”

Huo Linger was not one entity with Long Chen. She was independent. It was only when Long Chen used ultimate flame moves that she merged with him, and only in that state would both of them share wounds.

As expected, after merging, Long Chen also sensed a strange energy starting to invade his soul. It was burning his soul.

As a spiritual body, Huo Linger’s Spiritual Strength wasn’t powerful. On the other hand, Long Chen’s Spiritual Strength was as vast as a sea, so this little wound was nothing to him. He could endure it easily.

With her limited energy, Huo Linger was only able to use the Phoenix Blood Heavenly Silk Net to pull up one rock at a time. Long Chen then helped her put it in the primal chaos space.

In the primal chaos space, under the light of the golden lotus seed, that rock instantly shattered. Millions of Heavenly Flame Crystals then clattered on the ground.

“Damn, we’re rich!” Long Chen was shocked and delighted. He had Huo Linger continue dredging them up.

“Oh?”

Long Chen suddenly noticed that Zhao Mingxuan and the others started to creep forward stealthily. Originally, they had stopped in the outer region, but it seemed that they had sensed something.

Suddenly, a powerful explosion made everyone jump. They then saw Long Chen standing atop the bull-shaped Heavenly Flame Spirit, striking a golden gong viciously. The sound truly shook heaven and earth.

“Wake up! Sleepy time is over! Quick, people are trying to snatch your meat!” In front of countless horrified gazes, Long Chen repeatedly struck his gong.
