Chapter 4608 Mysterious Temple

“It’s only one realm higher than me?”

Long Chen almost couldn’t believe it. According to his senses, that tree demon’s power was essentially on par with a Sage King.

“That’s why I said you shouldn’t underestimate low-tier lifeforms. They also have their terrifying points. The Ghost Camphor Tree Demon’s bloodline is extremely ancient, so its power cannot be underestimated,” explained the Earth Cauldron.

Hearing this, Long Chen was taken aback. It seemed that he had to be more careful now. He had just entered this region but already encountered such a terrifying existence.

Who knew how many more terrifying existences would be inside? He couldn’t just barge in like this. This was not a place to play around.

However, at the same time as he was shocked, he also felt a profound sense of defeat. Previously, he had easily fought across two realms. But now against a single Divine Venerate tree demon, he had to flee miserably.

“In truth, you don’t need to be depressed about this. This is due to the different eras. The primal chaos era was the peak era of the nine heavens and ten lands, and everything started going downhill from then on. Although there was a resurgence at the end of every era afterward, it was nothing more than a tiny bump in the process of decline. The nine heavens and ten lands have been declining all this time. If we were to compare it to a ladder, then your generation would be at the bottom of the ladder. You simply weren’t born in the right era. Having someone like you from the end of this declining era fight across realms against a lifeform with an immemorial bloodline is fundamentally unfair,” consoled the Earth Cauldron, who had seen through his thoughts.

“Although I can understand the principle, I’m still not happy about it. Actually, it’s not that I couldn’t beat it. I just don’t have a good weapon.” Long Chen shook his head.

At this time, Dragonbone Evilmoon’s figure reappeared in his mind. Back then, with Evilmoon in his hand, he had felt heroic and domineering.

But that was all meaningless now that he didn’t have a usable weapon. After recovering, Long Chen thought of returning to face the Ghost Camphor Tree Demon again.

He had been caught off-guard back then and forgotten that he had another terrifying trump card to use against it—the primal chaos space’s black soil.

As long as he could set up a trap, with its low intelligence, he had a high chance of killing it.

However, the Earth Cauldron told him that the Ghost Camphor Tree Demon was crafty and cautious. After expending a significant amount of its energy and sustaining injuries during their previous encounter, it would undoubtedly be in hiding once more.

Even in its peak state, it rarely fought people head-on, let alone now that it was injured.

Other than that, Long Chen had taken the Great Sun Sunflower, so there was no longer any point in him going back there. According to the Earth Cauldron, after recovering, it would probably sneak attack other lifeforms to take over whatever precious treasure they were guarding.

To use the Earth Cauldron’s words, you already took their treasure, so what were you so bitter about?

Thinking about it, Long Chen had to agree. Although the Ghost Camphor Tree Demon had attacked him first, he had also taken its Great Sun Sunflower. It had paid its debt.

Speaking of the Great Sun Sunflower, Long Chen hastily checked the primal chaos space. He saw that the Great Sun Sunflower was shining brightly, brimming with vitality.

Long Chen saw that the seeds had turned yellow and were rapidly maturing. He took one and examined it closely. The seed looked like it was made of gold, covered in beautiful lines like it was an intricately carved ornament.

As soon as he took off the shell, a fragrant smell filled the air. Without hesitation, he tossed the seed into his mouth. The moment he sank his teeth into it, a burst of exquisite flavor flooded his palate, making him drool, and the fragrance flowed through him, going into his mind and his Dantian.

At the same time, he felt his Blood Qi instantly reach a peak. He was now akin to a lively dragon filled with energy.

“This really is a natural divine pill! Fuck, if I had known that this thing was so miraculous, I would have eaten a few back then and crushed the Ghost Camphor Tree Demon!” Long Chen slapped his leg in regret.

Long Chen found that sometimes he was really foolish. He had to use his brain more. If he had managed to kill the Ghost Camphor Tree Demon, he would have been able to take its corpse. What a loss of a priceless treasure.

Long Chen checked and found a total of nine hundred and ninety-nine seeds. He took them all, and the flower immediately withered.

That was fine as he directly planted five hundred of the seeds. However, they didn’t immediately start germinating like Long Chen had expected. After thinking about it, Long Chen found that this was normal. After all, this was a legendary treasure, the Great Sun Sunflower. It only made sense for its growth to be extremely slow.

As long as he could obtain enough corpses, its seeds would rapidly grow in the primal chaos space.

Crack

Long Chen tossed another seed into his mouth.

“It really is delicious! It’s addicting!”

Just one seed was enough to reinvigorate Long Chen and make him feel like he was in his peak condition. Realizing the danger, he hastily put the rest away, refusing to let himself eat another one. If he were to just eat them all like this, it would be a complete waste.

“The Great Sun Sunflower really is valuable. Your luck isn’t bad. With it, you can refine even higher-tier medicinal pills,” praised the Earth Cauldron.

Clearly, even the Earth Cauldron viewed the Great Sun Sunflower as a treasure. As Long Chen could grow them like a farmer, he’d have a sunflower field soon.

Eating just two seeds already made Long Chen feel like he was in his peak state and full of energy. He immediately set off once more.

However, he was more careful now. He had encountered a terrifying tree demon from the beginning, so there had to be even more terrifying existences in the way.

As Long Chen pressed forward, his heart suddenly tightened. He could sense a pair of eyes watching him from within the mist.

Long Chen’s heart skipped a beat. Within this mist, he couldn’t see the appearance of the master of those eyes, but the other side could see him clearly.

While this didn’t mean that this lifeform was necessarily stronger than Long Chen, this was its territory, and it had already noticed Long Chen. If they were to fight, it would be hard for Long Chen to get an upper hand against it.

Unlike the tree demon, this mysterious monster refrained from launching an attack on Long Chen. It seemed to think that Long Chen was not to be trifled with. Such a strong perception showed that its power was definitely above the tree demon’s.

Long Chen walked along the border of its territory, and as expected, it didn’t attack him. Long Chen continued beyond it and started to encounter many terrifying lifeforms.

Their auras were all much stronger than the tree demon’s. In fact, Long Chen had the urge to retreat after sensing them.

Although Long Chen couldn’t see the lurking lifeforms within the mist, their terrifying auras were palpable to his senses. Navigating cautiously, he traveled through the borders of their territories.

Those lifeforms also detected Long Chen’s presence, but they only gazed at him vigilantly or occasionally let out a low growl. However, none of them attacked him.

“How dangerous.”

Long Chen walked through this dangerous land for three days. The further he went, the more chills he got. Every single one of them gave him a sense of mortal danger. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

If Long Chen were to fight them together, he realized that even a hundred lives would not suffice for him to escape the perilous situation.

However, for the Nirvana Scripture, Long Chen braved this danger. On the seventh day, the mist gradually faded away, revealing a clear world.

“There’s a...”

When Long Chen gazed into the distance, he was shocked to see a hidden temple in this land.
