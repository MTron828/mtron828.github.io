Chapter 2504 The World’s Number One Handsome Man

A sea of flames spread, instantly igniting the Corpse Devouring Armored Spiders. However, there seemed to be another layer of energy around them, blocking a portion of the flames. Even once they were set on fire, it was a very slow process. It seemed that they didn’t fear these flames much.

Even within the sea of flames, they continued to charge forward, completely unafraid of death.

“They have powerful earth element energy within them. Fire isn’t a good counter to them,” said Mo Nian.

Long Chen pointed his finger. Flame arrows shot out, piercing a few of their bodies.

Those few Corpse Devouring Armored Spiders fell from the sky. Long Chen cut through one of them and saw that their armor was only three inches thick.

“What curious lifeforms.” Long Chen was surprised that this armor was able to block most of his flame energy.

However, while their bodies resisted the flames, they were still impacted, so his flame arrows were able to kill them.

Even though they were dead, they didn’t immediately burn to a crisp. Instead, they slowly shrank. Upon reaching the size of a fist and completely deforming, they suddenly transformed into ash.

“What a powerful lifeforce.” Long Chen was surprised. Even when dead, they had immense life energy that resisted his flames. It was only once their lifeforce was exhausted that they turned to ash.

He suddenly had a thought and began tossing the dead Corpse Devouring Armored Spiders into the primal chaos space’s black soil.

As expected, upon being devoured by the black soil, they quickly released a huge amount of life energy.

What Long Chen didn’t know was that these Corpse Devouring Armored Spiders were an ancient breed that fed on the essence of corpses. They had stored up an astonishing amount of life energy within their bodies. They had long lifespans, with the potential to grow for tens of thousands of years. It could be said that they had no natural predators. Furthermore, due to only devouring corpses, they did not break the balance of the world and were not hunted.

According to Mo Nian, these Corpse Devouring Armored Spiders would only attack people if someone barged into their territory while eating. Mo Nian could not figure out why this place would have so many of them.

Furthermore, people had clearly already fought here, but they hadn’t attacked them. Why would they attack the two of them?

Within the flames, their defenses dropped, allowing Mo Nian to tear through lines of them with his arrows.

Furthermore, with every slash of Evilmoon, Long Chen blasted a wave of them apart. He quickly gathered their corpses up at the same time.

Mo Nian asked, “What are you gathering their corpses for? Poison pills?”

“How could I have time for that? I have another use for them,” said Long Chen.

As more and more of them entered the black soil, the Heavenly Qilin Demon Trees quickly grew.

Although his flames were unable to directly burn them to death, it weakened them to the point that killing them became relatively easy. There were now so many of their corpses piled up into mountains that Long Chen was incredibly busy trying to gather them all.

This continued for two hours. Long Chen estimated that the two of them had killed millions of them by now.

Those corpses were tossed into the primal chaos space. The three hundred Heavenly Qilin Demon Trees had doubled in size.

Their growth was truly slow. It took an enormous amount of life energy to make them grow, but they didn’t disappoint him. With every inch they grew, they stored more life energy for him to tap into.

At this point, just these three hundred Heavenly Qilin Demon Trees had managed to surpass the entire forest of fully matured World Trees that he had planted before.

The Heavenly Qilin Demon Trees were only sixty meters tall now. They were essentially saplings when compared to a towering fully matured Heavenly Qilin Demon Tree. Once they were fully mature, there would be no way to estimate their energy.

At this time, Mo Nian came flying back from outside the sea of flames. He had gone to take a look at their situation, but he had been forced back.

The sea of flames had a limit. Beyond this flame domain, the Corpse Devouring Armored Spiders were incredibly powerful. Hence, Mo Nian didn’t dare to charge into their midst.

“How is it?” asked Long Chen.

“Fuck, we’re completely surrounded by a sea of spiders. My divine sense is cut off at that point, but based on what I saw, this entire world is full of Corpse Devouring Armored Spiders. There’s no way to see the end,” said Mo Nian.

They were essentially endless. Long Chen’s giant flame domain was essentially an island within a sea.

“Continuing like this is no solution. This is definitely Ye Ming’s trap to block us from saving Yun Tian. I say we should take the risk and try charging through,” said Mo Nian.

“You just said that this is Ye Ming’s trap. Did you consider that it might be a double-layered trap?” asked Long Chen.

“What do you mean?”

“If we use our full power to charge through this sea of spiders, who knows how much energy it will waste? If at that time, Ye Ming, Zhao Ritian, and the others were waiting for us, what would we do?”

“Eh…”

“Then consider an even worse situation, where upon charging out of the sea of spiders, we end up in a sea of beasts or worse. We can’t just act according to how Ye Ming expects us to,” said Long Chen.

“Then what are we supposed to do? Just wait?” Mo Nian frowned.

“Yup, just wait. Our reinforcements are coming.”

“Reinforcements? What reinforcements? Your Dragonblood Legion?”

Long Chen smiled. “I already sent out the call for reinforcements. They’ll get here quickly.”

“Are you not worried about Ye Ming scheming against them?”

“Nope. First of all, he didn’t have the time to do such a thing. Furthermore, dealing with the Dragonblood Legion would require at least two peak experts. If they did that, it would be a joke. Yun Tian would easily be able to kill them if they tried that,” said Long Chen. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“You’re so confident? I don’t want to insult you, but as long as they send out a single Zhao Ritian, they can block your Dragonblood Legion,” said Mo Nian.

“Do you think the current Dragonblood Legion is still the old Dragonblood Legion? If Zhao Ritian goes out on his own, I guarantee he’ll never be able to follow through with his name again,” laughed Long Chen.

The two of them continued to kill the Corpse Devouring Armored Spiders without exhausting themselves.

Suddenly, Long Chen began to flick his finger. One small flame lotus after another shot out. Despite their miniature size, when they exploded, they slaughtered the Corpse Devouring Armored Spiders within a giant region.

“Damn, what is that? Did you learn it on the Ghost Ship?” asked Mo Nian.

Those were miniature World Extermination Flame Lotuses. Mo Nian had seen Long Chen use this technique before, but even then, their power was not much greater than the miniature ones that he was shooting out.

Most shocking of all was that Long Chen was shooting them out easily without accumulating any energy. These miniature World Extermination Flame Lotuses were capable of killing fourth step Netherpassage experts easily.

“Speak up, what did you obtain on the Ghost Ship?” asked Long Chen.

“Hehe, it’s a secret. I’ll tell you later. I want to enjoy the sight of your shocked expression at the time,” snickered Mo Nian.

“Wretch.”

“Your uncle.”

“My only uncle is your uncle. I’ll tell him that you called him a wretch.”

“…”

Since Mo Nian refused to tell him what he had gained, he naturally wasn’t in a position to inquire what Long Chen had obtained. As for the matter of the Sovereign, Long Chen didn’t want to mention it for fear of bringing more karma upon Mo Nian.

As time passed, no matter how many they killed, more and more Corpse Devouring Armored Spiders appeared.

After a while, Mo Nian jumped out to take a look, only to see that there was still no end to them. Furthermore, as they killed more and more, the newcomers were slightly different. Their mouthparts were golden, and some of them even had wings. Those ones were quick as lightning. Mo Nian was almost bitten by one. It would cause unimaginable pain and slow down a person’s reactions, which could be fatal here.

However, the two of them continued to maintain a steady attack rate, making sure to stay in their peak condition for fear of someone launching a sneak attack.

After six whole hours, Long Chen had gathered countless corpses. The Heavenly Qilin Demon Trees had grown to one hundred and fifty meters.

Long Chen could clearly sense an ocean’s worth of life energy within them. That was the only gratifying thing about being trapped here.

“Boss, don’t panic! The world’s number one handsome man, the number two expert beneath the heavens, the divine armored warrior Guo Ran has come to help!”

Guo Ran’s metallic armored voice rang from the sky. A blood-colored figure charged through the sea of spiders.
