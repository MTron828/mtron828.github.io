Chapter 3975 Dragon Power Test

“Seeing how you’re holding out your butt, I can tell that you must need to spit out a few balls of dung. You want to play this game with me? Keep talking and I’ll feed that dung back to you.” Long Chen had long since noted that this fellow was not obedient, so he had already prepared a lightning sword just for him.

As a result, this lightning sword pierced this fellow’s mouth, shattering his jaw. He was fried black by the lightning and passed out.

Now, those people didn’t even dare to make a sound, only adding this charred person to the people that they were dragging away. They came tyrannically and left wretchedly.

“I don’t understand. Are you all children? Why do you play such low-grade provocation games? Who has so much free time? Why not cultivate? Wasting precious time on such things, you must truly be blessed.” Long Chen looked at Yu Qianxue helplessly.

Barely recovered after seeing Long Chen’s ruthless means, she snorted. “Don’t act so wise like you’re more mature. This is a world with constant fighting. Which place doesn’t have this kind of in-fighting? That’s how you show your value, through constant competition. How else do you know if you are outstanding or inferior? Life is a stage, and if you don’t know how to show off your power, you can only live an ordinary life.”

“An ordinary life?” Long Chen bitterly smiled. “I wish I could live an ordinary life.”

“If you were a member of the imperial family, you would have been banished a long time ago for lacking any ambition. As an imperial disciple, an heir to the Jiuli bloodline, and a follower of the Vermilion Bird, you cannot say such a worthless thing. The imperial disciples have to work hard in order to protect the throne and the people,” said Yu Qianxue.

“The logic’s not bad, but such childish competition cannot create true experts. Greenhouse flowers might look nice, but a single frost will wipe them all out,” said Long Chen disdainfully.

“What nonsense. Are you looking down on my imperial family?!” demanded Yu Qianxue.

“You can treat it as such. I can’t be bothered to explain it to you since none of you would understand. I’ll tell you the truth. As a person, you aren’t terrible. In fact, I can just barely count you as a friend. But I don’t want you to use me. I have no interest in being drawn into the fight between the princes and princesses. One mistake and your imperial family’s blood will flow like a river. My current goal is only to marry Qingxuan. I don’t want to get sucked into your affairs in case I can’t hold myself back,” said Long Chen sincerely.

If this continued, when his temper erupted, he would slaughter a few princes and princesses, and then there would be no way to propose. He would be the enemy of the imperial family.

Long Chen actually wanted to avoid standing out in the Vermilion Bird Empire. He just wanted a few days of peace where he didn’t have to constantly fight and kill. But based on the current trend, he was going to be drawn into a fight again.

“Your words are very arrogant. You think you can make the blood of the imperial blood flow like a river? Haha!” Yu Qianxue sneered.Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

Long Chen looked at her and also laughed, not saying anything else. Sometimes, naivety was also a kind of power. He wished he could be naive, but he didn’t have that chance.

Yu Qianxue then brought Long Chen down a long passageway. On the way, they saw quite a few imperial disciples. They all stared at him, clearly having heard of him.

However, their gazes were mostly icy or contemptuous, even hostile. There weren’t many friendly faces here.

It was because the imperial disciples were split into factions and branches. These disciples had all chosen their own sides, picking the prince or princess that they supported.

In truth, this could be considered another trial for these disciples, a test of their judgment.

Considering Yu Qianxue’s aloofness and lack of skill in winning people over, other than herself possessing immense power, she had no other strong points.

Thus, other than some guards and aides, she didn’t have the support of any imperial disciples. In this area, she was even worse than Zhu Yifeng, who had two imperial disciples willing to support him. In fact, they were very close to him. As for Yu Qianxue, she had no one.

Long Chen, Zhu Yifeng, and Yu Qianxue arrived at a gate and saw more people in charge of inspecting status plates here. They even made a record of Long Chen and the others before opening the gate.

The next moment, a shockingly ancient aura came out of the gate. This was a giant plaza with all kinds of equipment inside.

As a place for testing the strength of the physical body and training one’s power, there were various pieces of equipment here with dragon marks carved into them. They gave off a heavy feeling. These were all incredibly old items.

“This is the Vermilion Bird Empire’s special dragon power testing grounds, and only cultivators with the strongest physical bodies train here. Also, the units of weight here are measured in dragon power. A single dragon power is the full power of a dragon king or three hundred thousand Jun. One Jun is three hundred thousand Shi, and one Shi is three hundred thousand catties. The catty here is equivalent to the mortal world’s catty. As an ascender from the mortal world, you should have a general understanding of it, right?” explained Yu Qianxue.

“A general understanding? Are you asking me how many catties a dragon force is?” Long Chen rolled his eyes. Probably Xia Chen and Guo Ran would be able to instantly calculate it, but he couldn’t be bothered.

The immortal world’s weights were mostly counted with Shi, and the Shi standard was based on the amethyst granite. It had high density, was easy to cut, and was very common. It was a material that could be found almost everywhere within the nine heavens and ten lands. One square foot of amethyst granite was three hundred thousand catties.

So, in the immortal world, one Shi was three hundred thousand catties. But on the other hand, in the mortal world, one Jun was three hundred thousand catties. The measurement units had changed.

A single dragon force was equal to three hundred thousand of the immortal world’s Juns? It would be impossible to count just how many of the immortal world’s catties that would be.

When Long Chen and the others arrived, there were hundreds of experts training here. All of them were large, physically strong cultivators. In particular, they saw one practicing the horse stance with a short rod. However, veins were throbbing on his forehead. It seemed that whatever that rod was, it was incredibly heavy.

“Big brother, those rods have the weight of a single dragon power. It is the lightest weight here. For him to be able to hold the horse stance for several breaths is already very impressive. I can’t do that. At best, I can hold it for a single breath. Any more, and my body wouldn’t be able to endure it. The strain of holding it would tear apart my meridians. For him to be able to last this long, his maximum lift is probably around three dragon powers. His physical body can be counted as extremely powerful,” said Zhu Yifeng.

Long Chen asked Yu Qianxue, “What is your maximum?”

Yu Qianxue indifferently said, “The imperial family doesn’t focus on the physical body, so I have only reached ten dragon powers. I look forward to seeing how many dragon powers you can lift.”

Although her tone was flat, anyone could hear her pride. Perhaps in the entire Vermilion Bird Empire, the number of women possessing ten dragon powers could be counted on one hand.

“Big brother, you haven’t tested it before, so just try one dragon power first. It’s frighteningly heavy. You can easily get injured if you aren't careful.” Zhu Yifeng kindly advised Long Chen, feeling worried that for his own pride, Long Chen would directly challenge ten dragon powers. If he was injured from the attempt, it would be embarrassing. Hence, he gave Long Chen a step down from that.

Hearing this, Long Chen patted his shoulder. This child really wasn’t bad. To be able to still possess a kind heart while growing up in such an emotionless environment was truly rare.

Long Chen then looked at that rod with a hint of anticipation in his eyes. After so many years, he finally had a chance to test his power. He slowly reached out his hand.
