Chapter 2202 Since You Want To Die So Badly, I’ll Help You Out

The Stone race’s leader roared furiously, and his body began to expand as he tried to tear apart Chu Yao and Liu Ruyan’s bindings.

However, he underestimated their power. This was a quick tactic they had agreed upon before even fighting him. First, Yue Zifeng slowed him down, then Liu Ruyan and Chu Yao shocked him, and then Tang Wan-er would draw his attention so that Liu Ruyan and Chu Yao could bind him.

Everything had gone smoothly. The Stone race’s leader struggled with all his might, and while the willow branches and wooden stakes creaked, they didn’t break.

BOOM!

Tang Wan-er’s wildly spinning wind blade slashed through the Stone race’s leader’s head. A black hole appeared in the void where his head had been.

Chu Yao and Liu Ruyan’s bindings were sliced apart. Wind blades exploded, cutting apart the Stone race’s leader’s body. His life and death had been decided in an instant.

“Heavens!”

Every expert was stunned by this. The Stone race’s leader was someone who stood at the peak of the current era, but he had been slain like this.

Even the old man was startled. He had fought against the Stone race leader previously and hadn’t been able to beat him. Without risking his own life, the old man had no confidence in doing so. That was how powerful an existence the Stone race’s leader was. But Yue Zifeng, Liu Ruyan, Chu Yao, and Tang Wan-er had managed to kill him very quickly.

At this moment, the head of the Xue family arrived from the other direction. He held a water-thorn in his hand, and a terrifying Blood Qi exploded out of him.

The one facing him was a fairy who looked like she had walked out of a painting. She stood on Cloud’s back. Meng Qi was forming rapid seals.

The void exploded and the world dimmed. One giant figure after another appeared in the sky.

There were ten Magical Beasts, all as large as mountains. There was a phoenix, a drake, a tortoise, a lightning beast, a sword-bone wolf... All of them had auras that made people’s hair stand on end.

“Peak twelfth rank Magical Beasts!”

The head of the Xue family also jumped in horror.

Those ten Magical Beasts then opened their mouths at the same time, unleashing ten attacks at the oncoming experts of the Xue family.

As a result, even the Xue family’s head was unable to block the combined power of ten peak twelfth rank Magical Beasts. He was instantly blown to bits with no suspense.

These ten peak twelfth rank Magical Beasts were from the Wild World. Meng Qi had captured them before the battle.

Normally, Beast Tamers could only subdue Magical Beasts weaker than themselves. Subduing Magical Beasts on the same level as them was very dangerous, as stronger Magical Beasts might suddenly turn against their master. That was a common occurrence.

As for subduing a Magical Beast stronger than them? That was even more dangerous. Even for Meng Qi, subduing ten of them was her limit.

If she tried to subdue any more of them, she wouldn’t have enough Spiritual Strength to maintain a tight enough control over them. As a result, she wouldn’t be one hundred percent confident in them following all of her orders. Not only would that reduce her overall combat power, but there would even be some danger of the Magical Beasts turning on her. These ten Magical Beasts were perfectly suited to her current power level.

Without her spiritual bindings, there was no way these dumb Magical Beasts could understand how to cooperate like they just had. Furthermore, they had gathered their power for this attack very quickly. Meng Qi had drilled them for a long time to use this combined attack.

Now that these ten peak twelfth rank Magical Beasts attacked together, with all their power concentrated together, they killed the head of the Xue family in one blow.

Those Magical Beasts suddenly began to roar and stare at her spiritual bindings. Meng Qi’s expression changed. After seeing blood, these Magical Beasts started to enter a berserk state.

At this time, the best method was to give them some spiritual pill to teach them a lesson. However, now wasn’t the time for that. Meng Qi gave them one simple order, and they began to pounce at the incoming experts.

These twelfth rank Magical Beasts charged through the experts from the various powers, and those experts fled like the wind.

“Don’t be afraid, they are just brainless Magical Beasts! Focus on their weaknesses!” shouted an expert of the Xuan Beasts. He sent an attack at a wind wolf’s groin.

That wind wolf let out a heaven-shaking roar, as half of its extra limb was sliced off. It slammed a paw to the sneak attacker, killing him, and then unleashed a wind sphere through its mouth that blasted through the enemies surrounding it.

Although people fled in every direction, quite a few people didn’t get away in time and were torn apart. After all, a peak twelfth rank Magical Beast was an existence comparable to a fourth step Netherpassage expert.

Their intelligence was low, but that didn’t mean that their pure destructive power was low.

Others continued to sneak attack the wolf. One person crushed its gonads which made it roll on the ground.

“Kill it!” Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

Seeing a chance, the other experts pounced on it, attacking quickly to make sure it couldn’t get back up.

“No, run!” shouted someone. That ancient race expert noticed that the wind wolf started to inflate.

BOOM!

A huge explosion blasted away the surrounding experts. The wind wolf’s detonation killed at least ten thousand experts.

The remaining nine Magical Beasts continued to crazily attack, but there were simply too many enemies, and their large bodies made it easy for others to attack their weak spots.

Another three were quickly killed, but they also detonated themselves before dying, killing masses of people.

With only six left, they were quickly targeted. The experts had grown smarter, focusing on long-range attacks.

With only six of them remaining, Meng Qi was able to control them much easier. She formed rapid hand seals, controlling them in battle.

One of the Corrupt path’s elders had snuck his way behind one of their butts for a sneak attack, only for that Magical Beast to suddenly raise its leg and squash him into a meat paste.

“Kill that Beast Tamer!”

People began to shout and point at Meng Qi. With her controlling the Magical Beasts, it was very difficult to sneak attack them.

“Cloud, you can lead the warriors of the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow race. I have Ruyan’s protection here.” Meng Qi flew off of Cloud’s back. The experts of the various powers had started to fight the Dragonblood Legion. The Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow race needed Cloud to lead them.

Willow branches descended from the sky, wrapping around Meng Qi and pulling her into the towering willow. Here, no one could injure her, while she could focus on directing the six Magical Beasts.

The six Magical Beasts began to fight properly once more, working together. For a while, the enemy was unable to do anything to them.

As for the rest of the Dragonblood Legion, they were in an intense battle. Facing a tsunami of enemies, they were still fearless. Sword Qi swept through the air.

Unfortunately, what they were facing was essentially the strongest forces of the rest of the continent. Under that immense pressure, their formation began to crack.

At the core of the formation was Xia Chen controlling things, but even he was helpless. The power of millions of powerful experts attacking at once was just too much.

Injuries had started to appear amongst the Dragonblood warriors, but the healing warriors quickly restored their bodies.

This was a merciless and bloody battle. The Dragonblood Legion was barely able to protect themselves. But the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow race protecting the skies was under immense pressure, and casualties had started to appear amongst them.

Of course, on the other side, countless experts were being slain. Their corpses and weapons were piled into mountains. Rivers of blood flowed on the ground.

“Hahaha, how fun! The Dragonblood Legion is actually able to fight a bit! Then let my sea demon race test just how powerful you are.”

Suddenly, arrogant laughter rang out, and the Dragonblood warriors’ hearts turned cold. That voice was familiar. It was the voice of the Six Horn Sea Serpent man.

Heaven and earth shook as the giant sea demon army returned, led by the Six Horn Sea Serpent man. They hadn’t really left. Instead, they were planning on letting their two sides fight while they reaped the benefits.

“Long Chen, aren’t you very arrogant? Then let me see just how you save your friends. I’ll make sure you personally watch as they die,” sneered the Six Horn Sea Serpent man, his manifestation once more appearing. He unleashed a powerful punch that actually enveloped the entire Dragonblood Legion.

Chu Yao and Liu Ruyan both had a bad feeling, and they joined forces to summon a giant wooden wall. As a result, that wooden wall was smashed to bits.

The Six Horn Sea Serpent man’s power was just too terrifying. Only Long Chen and Wilde could contend against him.

BOOM!

The Six Horn Sea Serpent man once more unleashed a punch, one that landed on the Dragonblood warriors’ formation. Dozens of the warriors were blown back, coughing up blood, throwing the formation into chaos.

“Not good!” Xia Chen’s expression changed. With the formation broken, their enemies could charge in. They wouldn’t give the Dragonblood Legion a chance to set the formation up again, and at that time, every warrior would be fighting for themselves. That would definitely result in many casualties.

“Hahaha, starting today, the number one legion of the Martial Heaven Continent is history!”

The Six Horn Sea Serpent man laughed and raised his trident. It blazed with light, and he didn’t give the Dragonblood Legion any breathing room. He charged in.

Up in the sky, Long Chen’s hair stood on end with rage. This bastard had actually returned.

“Since you want to die so badly, I’ll help you out. Wilde, take my place.”

Long Chen clenched his teeth and suddenly left his battlefield. He raised a hand, and a giant flame lotus appeared. Sacred chanting began to ring out through heaven and earth.
