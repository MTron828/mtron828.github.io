Chapter 1966: 1966

The wild Huo Lieyun instantly stopped, looking at Mo Nian in shock . The latter had actually taken out a formation disc again, but this time, there were hundreds of divine items behind him .

Although those divine items were all quasi divine items, the sight of so many of them was still shocking .

The thing that people didn’t understand was how Mo Nian was capable of controlling so many divine items . It had to be known that each divine item had its own item-spirit . A person’s Spiritual Strength was limited, and normally they could only control a single divine item .

Controlling two divine items was difficult, and those who could control three to five were very rare .

The fact that Mo Nian had taken out a dozen divine items before and instantly absorbed all their divine energy had already been shocking enough . Now he was doing the same thing, but with hundreds of them .

“Are you not coming? Don’t worry, I won’t kill you . But if you dare to come over, it won’t just be piss this time . ” Mo Nian waved the formation disc at the shocked Huo Lieyun .

“You... wretch,” cursed Huo Lieyun .

Huo Lieyun didn’t know what method he had used, but when Mo Nian had sacrificed those divine items, the runic chains he had condensed had actually been able to bind Huo Lieyun . Huo Lieyun had been careless just now, however, if hundreds of divine items were sacrificed this time, the power would be dozens of times greater than before .

Perhaps it might not be able to cause any serious harm to his flame body, but while he was bound, Mo Nian might actually crap on his head . The name of the Western Wretch was not for nothing . Being humiliated in front of this many people was not something Huo Lieyun was willing to accept .

“Hehe, that’s right, young people shouldn’t be so fiery . Just look at me . I’m hard at work every day, but I don’t complain . No matter how people curse me, it doesn’t stop me . So, little fellow, try to calm down . Once you reach my realm, you’ll understand . That’s all I have to say to you . I’m going to enter now, so you can leave!” Mo Nian actually swaggered past Huo Lieyun’s body and into Heavenly Fate Island .

“Bastard! Wretch!”

Huo Lieyun clenched his teeth, furiously cursing Mo Nian and eighteen generations of his ancestors . But he didn’t dare to attack .

He might not be afraid of Mo Nian’s battle power, but he was afraid of his wicked moves .

He had already been defeated by Long Chen, so this was his only chance to wipe away that disgrace . He had to focus on that, or he would forever be a laughingstock .

“I can enter on my own . If you dare to say a word, do you believe me when I say I’ll toss you into a dung pit for a hundred years?”

Two of Heavenly Fate Island’s disciples came to receive Mo Nian, but once he spoke, they didn’t dare to move .

Sometimes, the Western Wretch was even more terrifying than the Eastern Madman . At most, Long Chen would just kill you, but Mo Nian would make you live a life worse than death . He was constantly challenging mankind’s limits when it came to wretched moves .

In front of everyone’s shocked gazes, Mo Nian walked right in . Those disciples of Heavenly Fate Island didn’t dare to stop him .

“Bastard, don’t even think about leaving Heavenly Fate Island alive!” Huo Lieyun silently cursed . He also walked in .

. . .

“Scram!”

Just a short while later, a shout rang out like thunder . The disciples of Heavenly Fate Island were knocked back, coughing up blood .

Everyone turned to look . Just who was brazen enough to attack Heavenly Fate Island’s disciples?

They quickly saw a powerful elder standing at the gates, wielding a black wooden cane .

“It’s the sect master of the Heaven Splitting Battle Sect, Wu Guangyuan!”

It was the old man . The seven bosses had also come, as well as dozens of Life Star disciples . Those disciples were led by Bao Buping and Chang Hao .

“Fuck, when I dominated the continent, your fathers were still playing in the mud! Who dares to block me?” shouted the old man . His temper was well-known on the Martial Heaven Continent, and after advancing to Netherpassage, it had only grown worse . He wouldn’t give face to anyone .

Back in the Martial Heaven Alliance’s headquarters, he had even dared to fight Pill Valley’s master, Yu Xiaoyun . What didn’t he dare to do?

As for the disciples blocking his path, if he didn’t see that they were so weak that they weren’t worth anything, he would have long since beaten them to death .

Those disciples simply didn’t know enough about the continent . They were busy focusing on comprehending the mysteries of fate, and so they hadn’t recognized the old man immediately .

The old man suddenly turned back at the Righteous path’s experts that had been kept out of Heavenly Fate Island . “Can you bastards grow up a bit? Just because they don’t want you to enter, you won’t? You’re going to endure it as they insult you? What if they want to kill you instead? Are you going to stick your necks out for them to slice off? You cowards of the Righteous path embarrass me . ”

After that scolding, the old man walked in with the experts of the Heaven Splitting Battle Sect .

“Fuck, this senior is right . I’m going in! Who dares to block me?!”

Someone in the crowd suddenly walked forward, pointing his spear at the disciples of Heavenly Fate Island . He had been inspired by Mo Nian and the old man .

“Let’s go!”

Others also shot into motion . They had long since been holding back their fury . Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Hey, you can’t-!”

That disciple was kicked away .

“Fuck off with your can’t . Why is it that others can but we can’t? If you make any more noise, I won’t go in . Instead, I’ll just kill you before leaving . ”

Chaos reigned at the entrance . Heavenly Fate Island had tried to give a show of power to the Righteous path, but the old man wouldn’t accept such a thing .

“What a waste of all your years . No wonder you’ve raised a group of fools, you don’t know how to follow rules . ”

Just at this moment, a cold snort rang out from deep within Heavenly Fate Island . It was the Unfettered Allseer . He was mocking the old man for his rudeness .

“Don’t play this meaningless game with me . Do you think people don’t know about your plot? If you want something, then fight for it openly . The Heaven Splitting Battle Sect’s motto is fight or fuck off . If you keep spouting nonsense, I’ll topple your Heavenly Fate Island . ” The old man continued walking forward . Each time his cane touched the ground, the ground rumbled, indicating his determination .

The Unfettered Allseer didn’t reply . In the senior generation, the old man had another nickname, which was the old madman .

No one wanted to provoke him, because when he went crazy, he would do anything . If he was further angered, he might just start fighting before Long Chen even arrived .

Countless experts followed along with the old man . Inside Heavenly Fate Island, they saw beautiful scenery: towering mountain ranges, long brooks, ancient trees . The spiritual qi here was extremely dense .

This floating island was rich in precious minerals, but they weren’t mined . Instead, they were connected by a formation to absorb the world’s essence to nourish Heavenly Fate Island . This place was distant from the clamor of the mortal world .

“What a good place . But it’s actually been occupied by a bunch of idiots,” cursed Bao Buping . In comparison to Heavenly Fate Island, their Heaven Splitting Battle Sect was like the home of a pack of beggars .

“Fuck, let’s just kill them and take this island for ourselves!” Chang Hao clenched his fist .

Bao Buping and Chang Hao had just spoken when the old man kicked them both .

“Why’d you kick us?!”

“Are you two unfilial bastards thinking of establishing your own sect here? Furthermore, this place is like mist blocking your eyes . You see the leaf in front of your eyes, but not the forest behind you . Here, you’re isolated from the rest of the world . You’ll think that what you see here is the entire world, when in reality, you see nothing . That’s why Heavenly Fate Island has never produced any true gods and has no divine inheritance . As for our Heaven Splitting Battle Sect, we were once called the Heaven Splitting Divine Sect because we had god-like existences . The reason our home is barren is so that your hearts can be clear . So what if I kick you? If it weren’t to give you face because so many people were here, I’d beat the crap out of you . Your words are against the foundations of our ancestors, understood?” demanded the old man .

Bao Buping and Chang Hao were startled . They hadn’t expected there to be such a thing . They shut their mouths .

They continued onward and eventually reached a giant platform . There were countless runes carved onto the platform . It was a giant calculating machine .

There were already quite a few experts gathered here . They formed three factions .

One was the neutral faction that was in the middle . To the left were the people of the Martial Heaven Alliance, while to the right were the allied powers of Pill Valley, the Xuan Beasts, the ancient races, the Corrupt path, the ancient family alliance, and the others .

The old man saw Qu Jianying amongst the section for the Martial Heaven Alliance . His expression sank, but he still decided to sit on the edge of the Martial Heaven Alliance’s side .
