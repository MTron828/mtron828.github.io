Chapter 3558

Yan Hong had used his core energy with this attack, not holding anything back. As for Long Chen’s World Extermination Flame Lotus, he had merged the flame energy of the Heavenly Daos with the huge amount of flames he had gathered in the primal chaos space, unleashing a horrifying attack.

This World Extermination Flame Lotus gave no room to dodge. When this attack fell, it was a front-on attack where the only thing that mattered was power.

BOOM!

The two flames crashed together, and it was like a sun had exploded within this black world. A giant hole was blasted into the wall of the heavens.

The huge hole had flames still burning within it, and darkness devoured them. But the flames outside the hole gushed out like a tsunami.

The wave of flames gushed out, turning mountains into flat lands, turning the earth into lava. A terrifying heat unfurled, and even the Dragon Blaze Prefecture which was thousands of miles away was affected.

The grand formation of the prefecture city had long since been activated. However, what the Dragon Blaze Prefecture’s experts had not expected was for the flames to cause the formation’s runes to rapidly break apart.

“Not good!”

The city lord’s expression completely changed. He hadn’t expected Long Chen and Yan Hong’s flames to contain such terrifying destructive power. The formation’s runes instantly lost effect.

If this formation was broken, then perhaps the Divine Lords and above in the city would be fine. But the millions of weaker commoners would instantly turn to ash.

However, what no one had expected was for a figure to suddenly appear standing before the wave of flames just as they broke through the formation. He smashed his World Domain divine item at the oncoming flames.

“It’s Xiang-er!”

The city lord was shocked. With Feng Xiang’s current power, even with a World Domain divine item, he couldn’t possibly block such terrifying flames.

BOOM!

However, curiously, the moment Feng Xiang appeared before the city, the endless flames suddenly parted, going around the Dragon Blaze Prefecture’s ancient city and flying past.

Originally, Feng Xiang had also known that if he tried to block it, it would be difficult to escape death. But he had still chosen to come out.

It was unknown if it was because he really was such a chivalrous hero inside, or if it was because he wanted to use his own death to prove just how big of a mistake it had been for his father to expel him. In any case, he had appeared there with no plans of surviving. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

When the flames passed around his body, he was dumbfounded. For a moment, he saw a flame dragon appear within the wave of flames before him.

“Long Chen!”

Feng Xiang’s heart shook. It wasn’t him that saved the Dragon Blaze City. It was Long Chen who had done so secretly.

At that moment, having escaped death, Feng Xiang felt complicated emotions. Originally, he had decided to use his death to prove himself. At the same time, he would use this as revenge against his father. He hated his father for his mercilessness.

However, he hadn’t expected Long Chen to have long since expected that the range of this attack might reach this far and had set up a way for the Blazing Dragon Prefecture to survive from the start.

It was just that his actions were very concealed. On the surface, it really did look like Feng Xiang had taken that sure-death attack and blown it to the sides, protecting the Dragon Blaze Prefecture. His mind buzzed blankly.

“You saved Qingxuan’s life, and I saved your Dragon Blaze City. From this moment, we owe each other nothing.”

Suddenly, an icy spiritual fluctuation was sent into his soul, shaking Feng Xiang’s whole body.

After that, the void twisted and Feng Xiang felt an immense suction force. He then found himself within the Dragon Blaze City, and his father nodded at him with gratification.

“Starting today, you are the city lord of the Dragon Blaze Prefecture.”

“Dad…” Feng Xiang looked at his father in disbelief.

“When you put down your selfishness and could think for others, you have passed my trial.” Feng Xiang’s father patted him on the shoulder.

“Dad, it was Long Chen…” Feng Xiang hastily rejected this. He had his own pride and refused to accept praise for something that he hadn’t done.

Feng Xiang’s father interrupted him. “Your heroism was seen by everyone. Sometimes, the process isn’t that important. What is needed is the result. No matter what your goal was in coming forward, the moment you are willing to sacrifice your life for the commoners of the city, you are qualified to be the city lord.”

Only then did Feng Xiang realize that the entire city’s people were looking at him reverently. Their gazes were full of gratitude and respect for him. It was completely different from those gazes that were afraid of his abuse.

In that instant, Feng Xiang felt a hundred different emotions, including shame and guilt. He now understood that if he wanted to gain the respect of others, it wasn’t through using martial might to suppress them.

Outside of the city, the flames were whistling loudly, devouring this world. The spectators might have fled quickly, but they were still devoured by the sea of flames. They had been prepared though, so they most likely hadn’t been killed. It was just unknown how far they were blown away.

BOOM!

Suddenly, another heaven-shaking explosion erupted from the core, shocking the people.

“They’re still fighting!”

The void was torn apart, and they saw the Minghong Saber forcing Yan Hong out of a spatial crack. As Yan Hong was constantly being forced back, the void behind him exploded repeatedly, unleashing a spray of flames.

People found that Long Chen’s body was out of violet qi, but there was still a large amount of violet qi on the Minghong Saber that was forcing Yan Hong down, not giving him a chance to breathe.

“You really have some ability. I didn’t expect you to be so powerful. But it’s useless. My Yan Xu race is an undying, indestructible existence. As long as the world’s flames are not extinguished, I cannot die. Your violet qi might be powerful, but it can’t kill me. Furthermore, as time passes, you lose more and more violet qi. But the world’s flames can't be extinguished, and so my power will never run out. How will you fight me now?!” Yan Hong roared with his face twisted sinisterly. Despite his loud voice, he was already out of breath. He was starting to pant.

This roar shook countless people. As expected, he actually lost. In a frontal collision, he was unable to beat Long Chen and could only rely on his undying body to slowly exhaust Long Chen.

Yan Hong’s aura was already in the late Divine Lord realm, and he was the strongest flame of the nine heavens and ten lands. No one in the same realm should be capable of fighting him. However, he had actually lost to a human. How was that possible?

Long Chen gazed at him coldly, his eyes full of killing intent and his voice full of ice-cold mercilessness.

“Your big brother devoured the Heavenly Rainbow Fairy, and you harmed my lover. I already said that you wouldn’t be leaving here alive. Today, you are definitely dead!”

Long Chen’s violet qi crazily erupted on his Minghong Saber. It ignited, crazily crushing down on Yan Hong. It seemed that this was the final competition between them. It would be a competition to see who wouldn’t be able to continue first.

A black rune lit up on Yan Hong’s forehead. When that rune lit up, his body became illusory. Clearly, he was also using his final bit of energy. Both of them were already exhausted.

“Fool, in this world, no one can kill my Yan Xu race! The person to die will only be you!” shouted Yan Hong coldly.

“Is that so?”

Long Chen held his saber in his right hand. All of a sudden, his left hand struck as quickly as lightning, a single finger striking that black rune on Yan Hong’s forehead.

The moment his finger touched Yan Hong’s forehead, a white lotus appeared on Long Chen’s fingertip. Also, when the white lotus manifested, the hot temperature of the world plummeted. The heat had been directly frozen, and snowflakes appeared in the air.

“Ice Soul!”

Yan Hong suddenly cried out in terror. He wanted to dodge, but it was too late.

The moment Long Chen’s finger touched Yan Hong’s forehead, the Ice Soul energy poured into that rune. As a result, that rune shattered and Yan Hong’s aura vanished.
