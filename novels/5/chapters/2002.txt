“What are you so nervous about?” Qu Jianying looked at Long Chen oddly.

Hearing that, Long Chen immediately relaxed. It seemed that he had overthought it.

“Ah, I was just nervous that you would beat me because of the old man’s matter,” said Long Chen.

“Hmph, that old bastard, I’ve known him for the better part of my lifetime. If I got angry at everything he did, I’d have long since died from rage. I can’t be bothered with him,” snorted Qu JIanying.

Inside, Long Chen thought to himself that while it was true that the old man’s temper was fierce, Qu Jianying wasn’t any better. They always had to have thorns in their words. Even if one of them had a good temper, they still wouldn’t be able to get along over time.

The two of them always blamed the other for their problems while never reflecting on themselves. For a person to look at themselves clearly was truly difficult.

“Alliance head, did you need me?” asked Long Chen.

“Yes. We have several things to discuss.” Qu Jianying nodded.

“Why would you need to discuss things with me? You’re the alliance head, and I’m just a little disciple.” Long Chen smiled.

Qu Jianying shook her head. “Your tribulation and battle have shaken the continent. You slew your fellow peak geniuses, destroyed Heavenly Fate Island whose inheritance stretches back countless years, and even killed two island masters. You don’t even realize this, but your influence might be even greater than mine. In just ten years, the entire Martial Heaven Continent might belong to you. So don’t act so bored all the time like Mo Nian. You should bring out your charisma-”

Long Chen hastily waved his hand, already knowing her goal. “That’s enough, alliance head. I don’t have such aspirations. If I wasn’t forced to, I wouldn’t have stood out like I did. So don’t try to use the name of all lives or the people to talk me around. The reason I am brothers with Mo Nian is because the two of us are both little rogues happy with just the basics. We’re also very lazy and can’t accept such immense responsibility. There’s no way for me to compare to Ye Lingshan in that regard, nor do I wish to sacrifice so much. I see how you care for me because of the old man, and you see the trust I have in you. As we’re so close, there’s no need to mince words. I, Long Chen, am not that kind of person, so you shouldn’t waste the effort to make me into that.”

Seeing Long Chen shake his head like a rattle even before she was done speaking, Qu Jianying couldn’t help sighing. After hesitating for a long time, she had discussed it with the higher-ups of the Martial Heaven Alliance to consider making Long Chen the leader of the Martial Heaven Alliance. His rallying power was simply much greater than Ye Lingshan’s.

The leader of the Martial Heaven Alliance didn’t necessarily need to be incredibly powerful, but they did need great charisma and rallying power, the ability to make others follow them into death.

Long Chen was perfect for that, and when she had suggested it, the majority of people had supported this choice. But the four Grand Elders had immediately shaken their heads.

Yan Nantian had told Qu Jianying to give up on that, saying that Long Chen would not accept being the alliance head. He was a wild horse that no one could subdue. He pursued freedom, something he would never have as the alliance head.

As expected, even the position of leader of the Martial Heaven Alliance was unable to move Long Chen.

“Are you really not going to consider it?” asked Qu Jianying.

“I’m not jumping into that hole. I never wanted to be some savior of the world. I just want to live in peace with my wives. Fishing, hunting, having a group of babies, wouldn’t that be a much better life?”

“But you have a relationship with Sovereign Yun Shang. The Sovereigns were always the protective gods of the Martial Heaven Continent. On their own, they pulled against the tide of destruction, saving the continent from a crisis. This is your responsibility!”

“When I encountered Sovereign Yun Shang, he never said anything about that. I feel like it’s fine for me to be like this.”

“You... you actually saw Sovereign Yun Shang?!”

The Sovereigns were the strongest and most mysterious existences in this world. They had left behind countless legends but had then vanished without a trace. Some people said that they had died, while some said that they were hiding. There were countless guesses.

However, anyone who could obtain anything that a Sovereign had left behind would be viewed as someone who would have amazing accomplishments in the future.

Long Chen had actually even seen Sovereign Yun Shang? In her shock, Qu Jianying completely forgot about her previous matter.

“Yes, I suppose. We chatted a bit and played chess. Then he gave me Evilmoon. He told me to eat and drink properly and maintain a strong body. He didn’t mention anything else,” said Long Chen.

“Nonsense!” cursed Qu Jianying. She refused to believe that. Actually, the first part was true, but Qu Jianying assumed that Long Chen was hiding some kind of secret. After all, this matter was related to the Sovereigns and couldn’t be randomly talked about. It wasn’t convenient for her to pursue this topic.

“Long Chen, I called you over to discuss things that are happening outside. Due to us refusing those opportunists and traitors, the majority of them have gone to Pill Valley’s side,” said Qu Jianying gravely.

“Yu Xiaoyun has once more made a move?” Long Chen was surprised by this. Those people shouldn’t be so reckless as to join Pill Valley that easily. Being refused by the Martial Heaven Alliance should have made them even more cautious.

Qu Jianying nodded, sighing. “When it comes to intelligence, I can’t compare to Yu Xiaoyun. Perhaps you’re the only one who can match him...”

“Our sect leader is definitely not inferior to him in that regard,” said Long Chen quickly, ending that change of topic right there.

The sect leader he referred to was Li Tianxuan. When it came to intelligence, the only one Long Chen admired was Li Tianxuan. Yu Xiaoyun might be difficult to deal with, but that was only because of his position. If Li Tianxuan was standing in an equal position, Yu Xiaoyun wouldn’t necessarily be Li Tianxuan’s match.

With Li Tianxuan in the Martial Heaven Alliance, there was nothing for Long Chen to worry about, so he quickly stopped Qu Jianying.

Qu Jianying glared at Long Chen for a moment, feeling like he was a wily old fox who couldn’t be conned. “Three days after we refused those people, Pill Valley sent out word that any disciples of sects allied with Pill Valley could enter Pill Valley’s Brahma secret realm for tempering,” said Qu Jianying.

“The Brahma secret realm? What damn thing is that?” Long Chen was startled. Didn’t Pill Valley only possess the Heaven Dragon Flame Region? Where did a Brahma secret realm come from?

“The Brahma secret realm is one of Pill Valley’s secrets. It’s said that it is a legacy that their god Lord Brahma left behind before becoming a god. As for whether that’s true or not, there’s no way for us to know. There are countless precious medicines and beasts within it, and it is a sacred land to Pill Valley. Pill Valley was only willing to reveal this secret to steady their side’s hearts after they took such immense losses in the previous battle. One aspect is compensation to them, while another reason is to draw over people from the neutral side. As long as the neutral camp’s people swear to never stand beside the Martial Heaven Alliance, they will also be allowed to enter the Brahma secret realm.”

Yu Xiaoyun seemed to have countless moves up his sleeve. The Martial Heaven Alliance had only just won a victory when he made his next move, instantly stabilizing his side and even drawing in more of the neutral camp’s people.

“Is the Brahma secret realm really related to Lord Brahma? Is Pill Valley really willing to share their god’s inheritance with other people?” Long Chen frowned, thinking that this wasn’t usual for Yu Xiaoyun. “What about the sect leader? What does he say?” 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“Li Tianxuan said that this move is very strange and that he can’t see through it. However, this might be Yu Xiaoyun’s only way to steady the hearts of the large factions on his side,” said Qu Jianying.

Lord Brahma’s inheritance? Long Chen had an urge to go. He still didn’t know much about the Pill Sovereign’s memories. However, the intense disgust he had for Lord Brahma and Fallen Daynight came from deep within his soul, and so they should be related to the Pill Sovereign’s memories.

The Pill Sovereign’s memories had a close link to the Nine Star Hegemon Body Art as well, but he knew little about either. If he wanted to figure it out, he had to go to the Brahma secret realm.

“Has the Brahma secret realm already been opened?” asked Long Chen.

“Not yet. They have announced that it will open in one month because they are still waiting for the Pill Fairy, their god’s chosen, to fully awaken. They need her power to open the Brahma secret realm,” said Qu Jianying.

“Her?”

Long Chen’s heart pounded hard. The warm smile of the Pill Fairy appeared in his mind. It made him think of past events.

He couldn’t help sighing. Why did she have to be Yu Xiaoyun’s daughter, with Yu Xiaoyun being his mortal enemy? They would definitely have a battle to the death one day. It really was a case of fate toying with people.

“Apparently, the Pill Fairy has already reached the last step of her inheritance. Once she succeeds, she will become Pill Valley’s divine daughter and will be blessed by the god’s power. At that time, no one will be able to match her within the same realm. Perhaps this is one of the reasons that Yu Xiaoyun retreated. You are currently unrivaled in the same realm, but his daughter might be able to kill you. In fact, your current fame might even have been boosted intentionally by him so that when his daughter kills you, Pill Valley will rise far above anyone else,” said Qu Jianying. Yu Xiaoyun’s scheming was extremely frightening.

She warned him, “You must be careful of the Pill Fairy. Once she becomes the divine daughter, her entire character will change. The will of the god will influence her mind. Don’t think that your past relations with her will make it so that she won’t kill you.”

“I understand.”

Long Chen nodded. He had heard a bit about this god inheritance. The so-called divine sons and divine daughters were servants of their gods. They were only loyal to their god.

Sometimes, some things couldn’t be avoided no matter what. Long Chen was already used to it. The future would come no matter what.
