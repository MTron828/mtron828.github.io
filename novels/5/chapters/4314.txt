Chapter 4303 Other World, Move Out

Long Chen was still basking in the delight of the immense changes in his body when he suddenly heard this, and in an instant, his curiosity was piqued.

“Another brazen idea? Great!”

“Now, your Spirit Root has been dispersed throughout your starry sea, your seven-color Supreme Blood has been activated, the dragon blood has entered your tendons, your Supreme Bone has reforged your skeleton, and your violet blood has opened your meridians. Qi Condensation, Blood Condensation, Tendon Transformation, Bone Forging, and Meridian Opening have all been completed. But have you not noticed something peculiar about your body?” asked the dragon expert.

“Something peculiar? I feel like my body has gotten even stronger. I’m thirsting for a battle with a real expert!” Long Chen felt his body thrumming with power, but he felt an intense thirst as well.

“You are wrong. This thirst is not for a battle but for nourishment.”

“A thirst for nourishment?”

“You have awakened your qi, blood, tendons, bones, and meridians, going through an immense transformation all at once. However, you have to know that the stronger the body, the more energy is required to maintain it. This is why little Wilde has to constantly eat meat when he fights. If he runs out of meat, he also runs out of his energy source and will quickly exhaust himself. After a certain point, he will enter a deep slumber to reduce the exhaustion in his body. You are now the same, and you should be able to feel it. You feel full of power right now, right?”

“Yes, I feel limitless power welling up within me. I feel like I want to fight someone just to unleash it,” said Long Chen.

“You are not in a combat state but already feel such terrifying power. If you were in a fighting state, you would burn up even more energy. Your body is like a reservoir. Before this, the output was only a finger’s thickness, while the input was an arm’s thickness. Thus, you never ran out of energy. But now, your output is greater than your input even when you aren’t fighting. Even if you just sleep, you will constantly exhaust an enormous amount of energy. In less than half a year, you will not be able to keep up, and your core energy will start running dry. When that time comes, your qi, blood, tendons, bones, and meridians will descend into slumber to protect themselves, and you will return to your old state.”

“What!?”

“This is a serious problem. I’m not joking at all. Your body is like an empire with an army of a hundred thousand. But suddenly, you gain an army of ten million, while your army provisions have not increased. How long do you think you can keep them satisfied? In this era, there is no lack of amazing geniuses. But why do people rarely manage to surpass their ancient predecessors? It isn’t that they aren’t strong enough but that they are so powerful that there isn’t enough energy for them. They either starve to death or sacrifice some power to continue surviving,” said the dragon expert.

Long Chen’s jaw dropped. “Isn’t primal chaos qi slowly filling the Nirvana Overflow Heaven? And aren’t the laws of the Heavenly Daos gradually growing complete? Aren’t they enough for me?”Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

“If you only had one or two types of energy, it would be no problem. But you now possess seven-color Supreme Blood, violet blood, and dragon blood—three top-tier bloodlines, and they come at an immense cost. Moreover, there’s your mysterious Supreme Bone and the extraordinary 108,000 Spirit Roots. Do you feel like the Heavenly Daos will starve everyone else to death just to feed you? Fortunately, you have the Sage King karmic luck, and the Heavenly Dao energy now favors you. Otherwise, with this level of consumption, you would be drained in just three days, let alone lasting half a month."

After hearing the grave picture that the dragon expert painted, Long Chen couldn’t help asking,” Then senior, why didn’t you tell me about this earlier?”

“I also didn’t expect your consumption to be this terrifying. Furthermore, even if I did tell you beforehand, what could you do? If you didn’t activate them in the Immortal King realm, then the process would take even more energy in the World King realm. Furthermore, they would be far more difficult to activate then. You wouldn’t make such a choice even if you were beaten to death,” said the dragon expert.

“That is true. Then senior, what is this brazen idea of yours? Is it a solution to this problem?” asked Long Chen hastily.

“Of course. I am simply thinking that you might want to explore the world on the other side of the gate,” said the dragon expert.

“What is there? Can I recover my energy in that world?” asked Long Chen.

“Primal chaos qi is much denser there. If you go to that world, recovering your energy won't be an issue. But that’s not my real goal. After all, you can’t undergo tribulation there, and if your identity is exposed, you will definitely die. My plan is that since the human race has long since vanished in that realm, there should be quite a few spirit stone deposits underground. Hehe, you understand.”

“Spirit stones? I have plenty!” For a moment, Long Chen still didn’t understand.

“Fool! Your spirit stones are basically trash! I’m talking about primal chaos spirit stones! Spirit stones that contain primal chaos qi!” cursed the dragon expert.

“What? There’s such a thing?” Long Chen jumped in shock.

“Of course. It is something that only your human race can use, and it is trash to other races. That’s why I guarantee there are primal chaos spirit stone deposits in that world. There should be some in the ruins of the human race. As long as you gather enough spirit stones, you can rely on the primal chaos qi within them to help you cultivate and maintain the requirements of your body. Otherwise, you will simply starve to death. So, are you interested?”

“Of course, I’m interested! Fuck, this is an undiscovered land of treasures to me!”

Long Chen’s eyes lit up as though he could see countless spirit stones shining before him and even hear some kind of calling.

“The lifeforms on the other side of the gate are theoretically capable of crossing, but they lack an understanding of formations, preventing them from doing so. However, from your side, attempting to pass through requires opposing the flow of primal chaos qi, a pressure that's beyond the endurance of an ordinary individual. Moreover, the higher one's realm, the more intense the pressure becomes. If a Heaven Venerate attempts it, it's akin to self-destruction. Even for World Kings, the odds are incredibly slim. Only Immortal Kings might have a chance, but they would need not only an exceptionally robust physical body but also a spatial law-based formation. As you have a formation master by your side, it should be no problem for you.”

“Alright!”

Long Chen immediately got impatient and ran off, grabbing Xia Chen and Guo Ran. When he told them that he wanted to go to the world on the other side of the gate, their eyes turned green with greed. They seemed even more excited than Long Chen.

“Move out!”

The three of them were on the same page in an instant, and without another word, they set off.
