Chapter 4560 Time to Honor a Promise

This Underworld expert was extremely powerful. The moment he attacked Feng You, he also used one of the Underworld race’s divine abilities to blink somewhere, tricking even someone of Feng You’s caliber.

His blinking ability was incredibly bizarre, allowing him to seamlessly continue his attack unhindered. He swiftly redirected his target from Feng You to Long Chen’s head.

It all happened so fast that even an experienced expert like Feng You was unable to react in time.

As for Long Chen, he was at the vanguard and still charging forward as if he didn’t sense any danger. Feng You’s heart clenched with worry. She rushed forward, but she knew that she couldn’t make it in time.

The Underworld expert sneered disdainfully. It was as if he could already see his weapon stabbing through Long Chen’s head.

Just as his weapon was about to pierce Long Chen’s head, a hand covered in starlight caught the tip of his weapon, causing the Underworld expert to tremble. Following that, a streak of lightning arced across this expert, rendering him stiff.

The starry hand then snapped his weapon, and Long Chen sent its tip stabbing through that expert’s head, instantly extinguishing the fire of his soul.

“The stranger the weapon, the faster you die. Do you not understand that?” Long Chen snorted. From the start, he hadn’t even looked at this person.

In Long Chen’s view, this person was practically asking to die. He wanted to use a little trick to kill him?

This unlucky bastard was far too naive. Not to mention Ying Tian’s technique, this person’s skill was even way below that of a second-rate assassin from the Lifehunter race.

When this person died, another six-star Heavenly Doyen Fruit appeared in the primal chaos space.

This person was actually a powerful six-star Heavenly Doyen. However, thinking himself smart, he ended up dying effortlessly at Long Chen’s hands. If he had chosen to fight directly, then Long Chen would have needed to put in some effort to kill him.

To put it frankly, while this move might be effective against others, it was purely courting death when used against Long Chen.

Just as Long Chen killed this person, Wu Hun appeared in front of Long Chen, wielding a black spear in his hand.

The moment his subordinate moved, he already had a bad feeling. Although he had yet to exchange blows with Long Chen, based on his intuition, he knew that Long Chen was not an easy target to provoke. At the very least, his subordinate was not a match for him.

Unable to stop his subordinate in time, Wu Hun immediately rushed over to save him. However, Long Chen was just too fast. Before Wu Hun could intervene in their fight, his subordinate was already dead.

“Scram!”

In front of Wu Hun, Long Chen told him to scram again.

“We’ll see!”

Wu Hun seethed with rage at the loss of his powerful subordinate. It felt like a humiliating slap in the face.

However, the Fantasy Spirit World’s gate was on the verge of opening. For Wu Hun, there were two important things at this point: one was to get near the gate, and the other was to conserve his power.

If he were to start a fight with Long Chen, not only would it delay his progress, but it would also use up his precious energy. It was not an acceptable loss to him.

Thus, despite his rage, he endured as it wasn’t the time to get revenge for his subordinate yet.

The mixed beast race’s experts were all stunned as they saw Long Chen kill that powerful expert effortlessly. Only now did they realize how terrifying Long Chen really was.

Thinking of how a peak expert like Long Chen had addressed them as brothers, a surge of emotion heated up within them. Their reverence and gratitude for Long Chen rose to a new level.

Although Feng You had guessed that Long Chen had been holding back and was actually strong, she hadn’t expected the extent of his power to be at this level.

“The mixed beast race is here! If you don’t want to die, make a path! Otherwise, this spear of mine will show no mercy!” shouted Feng You, emboldened by Long Chen’s impressive demonstration of power.

“You should control your explosive power. From now on, you must exercise restraint,” advised Long Chen.

“What?” Feng You was startled.

Long Chen then grabbed Feng You’s spear and unleashed a stab with it, killing an enormous beast.

Feng You was taken aback. She had thought that only her race’s core flame could activate the power of this spear.

Unbeknownst to her, Long Chen had Huo Linger, a flame spirit that had devoured an unknown number of flames, so it was a trivial task for him to control this spear. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

Furthermore, if she had intended to slay that beast, she would have done so by exploding its head with sheer force. However, Long Chen simply poked its head, and the spear pierced through with ease. The seemingly effortless act left Feng You wide-eyed in disbelief, unable to comprehend it.

“When your power is limited, you have to learn how to wield it efficiently. Use the least energy to create the greatest killing prowess. Don’t just randomly unleash your power. Try condensing your flame energy onto the tip of the spear,” advised Long Chen.

BOOM!

Feng You tried to heed Long Chen’s advice and stabbed an expert who was blocking their way. To her astonishment, that expert still exploded.

“Don’t panic. Just try it out slowly. Put your will into the tip of the spear before attacking,” explained Long Chen.

Feng You was talented, so she quickly mastered the method Long Chen had spoken of. In the end, she successfully reduced her energy expenditure and increased her killing prowess, a development that brought her great delight.

Feng You was exceptionally talented, yet she lacked a true master within the mixed beast race and had to rely on herself to comprehend many things. After all, the mixed beast race was not a single race but rather a coalition of various races, each with its own distinct characteristics. Hence, their way of teaching wasn’t that reliable. What Long Chen taught her was nothing more than the simplest method to control her energy, but it brought Feng You immense joy.

Pressing onward, they encountered an even more chaotic battlefield ahead, with corpses littered all over the ground. Long Chen didn’t forget to clean up as they advanced.

As they progressed, even more powerful experts appeared. Relying on just a powerful aura to intimidate them was no longer possible. Long Chen and the others had to show what they were made of to compel them to yield.

As the gate drew closer, the battles escalated as well. However, with Feng You present, Long Chen essentially didn’t need to fight. Instead, he gave Feng You pointers as she fought. Enlightened by his pointers, her power continuously grew. Despite the ongoing skirmishes, she felt invigorated and not the slightest bit fatigued.

Suddenly, the air twisted. Long Chen’s hand swiftly darted out, revealing a cold arrow gripped firmly within his grasp. With a sinister smile on his lips, Long Chen looked ahead.

“Enemies truly do meet often. It’s the time to honor a promise.”
