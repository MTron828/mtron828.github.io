Chapter 4224: Cloud’s Might

“Long Chen, don’t move.”

Suddenly, Meng Qi spoke, startling Long Chen. She actually didn’t want him to help Chu Yao? He then stared at her in bewilderment.

Seeing his confused gaze, Meng Qi laughed and said, “Fool, leave this kind of small matter to us. You should focus on the karmic luck bead. I trust that with our power, we’ll be able to handle it.”

“I…” Long Chen was a bit worried as he didn’t want anything to happen to them. As for the karmic luck bead, it wasn’t as important as his family. If something happened to them because of his lack of care, he would go crazy.

“Are you looking down on us?” demanded Tang Wan-er.

“I wouldn’t dare!” declared Long Chen immediately. He knew Tang Wan-er’s temper. If he dared to doubt her, she’d turn her wrath on him.

Meng Qi smiled and looked at Ye Zhiqiu, Yu Qingxuan, Tang Wan-er, Dong Mingyu, and the others.

“After training hard for so long, isn’t it our turn to show off a bit?”

Hearing that, all the ladies smiled. Suddenly, Cloud let out a cry, and an enormous figure appeared in the sky.

Meng Qi, Ye Zhiqiu, Yu Qingxuan, Tang Wan-er, Dong Mingyu, and the others jumped onto Cloud’s back. Cloud’s wings then flapped ever so slightly.

BOOM!

Cloud shot out like a shooting star through the broken void, causing an ear-piercing sound to ring out. It seemed that she had broken the limits of space. As soon as he moved, she appeared before the Undying race’s territory and shot at the Devil Eye Water Lily race.

Cloud was incredibly fast, crossing many miles just like that. Her enormous body was like a mountain crashing at them.

“Courting death!” The Devil Eye Water Lily race’s experts roared furiously as they summoned their true bodies. The next moment, enormous lily leaves covered the sky.

Their leaves were like a net, weaving in front of Cloud and exuding devil qi all around. Etched onto the leaves were runes that bestowed them with remarkable flexibility, all designed for the precise purpose of subduing raw brute force.

In front of their blockade, Cloud suddenly opened her mouth and shot out a black ray of divine light. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

Like a celestial god’s blade, this black light instantly tore through those lily leaves. The Devil Eye Water Lily race’s defenses were unable to block Cloud.

This was Cloud’s innate divine ability. As it pierced through the lily leaves and tore through the army of the Undying race, countless lifeforms exploded into bits.

Most terrifying of all, Cloud’s divine ability actually passed through their ranks and struck the martial stage’s barrier.

BOOM!

The barrier quivered. After a bit, the black light finally exploded and dissipated.

This was an attack that reverberated through the heavens, leaving countless spectators in astonishment. The formidable defensive divine ability of the Devil Eye Water Lily race had, unexpectedly, been breached.

BOOM!

There was another explosive sound as Cloud’s enormous body smashed into the lily leaves net. The previous attack left a hole, and now Cloud smashed straight through it.

Countless Devil Eye Water Lily experts had their bodies crumble and were blasted back, their broken leaves and flowers flying through the air. Cloud broke through their defenses in the simplest, most violent way.

Cloud then let out a bird cry and raised her wings, from which a flowing five-colored divine radiance emanated. With a sudden shift in momentum, she shot upward with remarkable speed.

At this moment, a sword slashed down right in front of Cloud, like a river of stars slashing down, forming a domain of death. It was Lian Wuying who had attacked.

She had timed this attack perfectly, thinking that it would definitely land. But unexpectedly, Cloud’s enormous body was actually so nimble, and she managed to instantly change her flying path.

The sword missed Cloud, instead hitting the martial stage. Upon impact, the martial stage split open.

Just then, Cloud’s body turned in the sky, exuding multicolored divine radiance. She then opened her mouth once again.

Lian Wuying’s expression instantly changed.

“Dodge!”

BOOM!

A black sphere of light shot down at them like a meteorite. With an explosive sound, the martial stage was blown apart, and a raging qi wave sent the Devil Eye Water Lily experts flying.

Just as they were wretchedly blown back, Cloud’s figure shot at them like lightning. And just like that, their ranks were easily blown through, and Cloud arrived in front of Liu Ruyan and Chu Yao.

Cloud even leisurely spun in the air in a pretty arc before stopping, as if provoking the Devil Eye Water Lily race.

“Big Sister Meng Qi!”

Cloud returned to human form, and Chu Yao emotionally rushed toward them. All of them embraced each other, feeling like it had been a lifetime since they had all been together.

“Good sisters. Today is a happy day. Let’s not cry,” said Meng Qi. But she was sobbing as well.

Tang Wan-er was the one crying the hardest. During the time when the Martial Heaven Continent was destroyed, they had all ascended into the immortal world without a clue of the others’ whereabouts. At that time, they didn’t even know if any of their comrades was still alive, or if they would ever meet again.

What they were most afraid of was that everyone else was gone, and only they survived. Thus, now that they were meeting again, they couldn’t control their emotions.

Previously, in front of Long Chen, they had done their best to hold their emotions back. But now that Long Chen wasn’t here, the dams overflowed, unable to be controlled any longer.

Even the icy Ye Zhiqiu couldn’t stop her tears. One drop after another fell from her face, turning into ice crystals the moment they fell.

Yu Qingxuan didn’t know what had happened between them, but feeling their deep emotions for each other, she also wept.

Of everyone, only Liu Ruyan wasn’t crying. She just calmly watched everyone without saying a word.

“Now isn’t the time to cry. We have to help Ruyan deal with these people,” said Meng Qi, making a great effort to calm herself down.

“That’s right, let’s wipe them out!” Tang Wan-er seemed to feel much better after crying. Now, she seemed refreshed and ready to fight.

“I actually don’t need your help to deal with the likes of them. Big Sister Chu Yao and I would be enough. I only asked for help from that dislikable fellow as a test,” said Liu Ruyan.

“You wanted to see if the karmic luck bead was more important to him or Big Sister Chu Yao, correct?” asked Meng Qi.

Liu Ruyan nodded.

“You foolish girl, you still don’t know Long Chen’s character. For you and Chu Yao, he’ll throw away even his own life, let alone some karmic luck beads,” said Meng Qi.

“What does it have to do with me?” snorted Liu Ruyan.

Meng Qi simply smiled and looked at her. After that, Liu Ruyan gradually blushed.

“They’re…!”

Suddenly, Cloud let out a startled cry and pointed at the Devil Eye Water Lily’s side.
