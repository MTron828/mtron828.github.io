Chapter 4172: Root of the Tumor

.

“Just what is your High Firmament Academy doing? How many generations has it been since you last participated in the Sage King Convention? Now you’re finally here, and you only let us wander the outer edge?”

“Has your High Firmament Academy forgotten your ancestral teachings? The High Firmament Academy was built with the support of the entire human race! All your accomplishments are due to us! Now, you actually locked down the core area? Have you forgotten your roots? That is completely unjust! Call out your overseer!”

“What did your High Firmament Academy promise back in the day? Didn’t you say that everything in the High Firmament Academy would belong to the entire world? But what about now? Aren’t you slapping yourselves in the face? How are you any different than a conman?”

Furious roars rang out one after another, coming from a group of disciples clad in various robes who found themselves barred from entering the core region's gates. The scene was rather chaotic and intense, with these disciples appearing on the brink of losing control.

The High Firmament Academy’s disciples who were guarding the gates were also panicking. They had already reported this to the higher-ups but had yet to receive any response. They didn’t know how long they could maintain the situation.

Seeing their panic, those people grew even more wanton. Some people directly pointed at the guards’ noses and cursed them vulgarly, throwing all kinds of insults their way.

The High Firmament Academy’s disciples were enraged, but they were only a few hundred against hundreds of thousands. As a result, they didn’t even dare to curse back.

“What number one academy? What treasure of the world? All lies! Let’s just attack together! We’ll destroy this sanctimonious academy and turn it into ruins!”

“The High Firmament Academy is a bully! After taking our things and promising to share them with us, you lied and kept them for yourselves! Everyone, let us reclaim what is ours! We’ll see who dares to block us!”

Several voices were urging on the crowd, acting as if they were the wronged party. The discontent of the people was already simmering, and now, these provocateurs were adding fuel to the fire. In response, flames of fury ignited, and people really did charge toward the disciples guarding the gate.

The High Firmament Academy’s disciples were appalled. In this case, if they were killed, who could even find the killer? They didn’t even know how they were supposed to face them. Yet, all of a sudden, blood flew through the air.

The ruckus, curses, and all the noises seemed to be cut off in an instant. Over ten people had charged forward, and now, over ten heads flew through the air, their blood raining down.

It was like a bucket of ice water had doused these individuals who had been consumed by their anger. They instantly calmed down, staring in horror at the newcomers.

“Keep roaring, keep shouting. Let me see just how arrogant you are to dare to run rampant in my High Firmament Academy.”

The black-robed Long Chen arrived at this critical time, causing all those guards to cheer. Long Chen was practically an idol in their eyes.

“You are going too far! How can you indiscriminately kill people here?!” shouted one person.

He had barely spoken when Mu Qingyun unsheathed her sword. The next moment, a bolt of lightning streaked through the air, cleaving that person in two.

Mu Qingyun could be considered a genius of the Sword Dao. Long Chen had once given her pointers, but since Long Chen wasn’t a sword cultivator, his advice could only lead her to the initial stages of her journey.

Afterward, Mu Qingyun had perused all kinds of tomes in the academy regarding the Sword Dao. As she walked further and further down this path, her power grew increasingly terrifying.

It could be said that what Long Chen had given Mu Qingyun was a key. After Mu Qingyun learned how to use this key, she learned to study various locks. Then, with all her experience, she began to create her own keys.

In just a short time, Mu Qingyun had completely transformed. Currently, she was extremely famous in the High Firmament Academy, second only to Bai Shishi in terms of reputation.

At this moment, Mu Qingyun slowly sheathed her sword, her gaze calm. She didn’t say a word, as if she had merely done something completely inconsequential.

However, that one strike of hers left everyone, including the Supreme Heavenly Geniuses, utterly astounded. After all, that strike possessed the power to claim even the lives of Supreme Heavenly Geniuses who were unprepared for it.

Long Chen suddenly extended a hand, and a startled cry rang from the crowd. It turned out that someone was lifted into the air by Long Chen through space, and no matter how they struggled, it was useless.

Long Chen clenched his hand like a metal claw clutching that person’s neck. He sneered, “What? After lighting a fire and fanning the flames, do you think that you can run? What happened to your passion and bravery from before?”

“What… what are you doing?! It is your High Firmament Academy that is bullying those who gave you your current position! Are you going to kill us all?! Even if you kill us all, you can’t stop the truth!” shouted that person in panic.

“I don’t know. But I want to try it.” Long Chen shook his head.

With just a slight clench of his hand, that person’s body exploded and his blood rained down, rendering the onlookers utterly speechless. Long Chen's brutal methods left them in a state of shock and disbelief.

“His blood…!”

“The color’s wrong! This is the blood of the beast race!” Suddenly, startled cries rang out. The falling blood was not only vivid but also bore peculiar markings. It was not something the human race should have.

“Could it be that…?!”

Suddenly, the onlookers realized that they had been used. It seemed that this person had been using Spiritual Strength when shouting just now, intentionally fanning their emotions, and they had actually followed along without realizing it.

At this moment, over ten people in the crowd shot out in different directions, fleeing.

However, their efforts proved futile as the void trembled and golden arrows accurately pierced through their heads. What baffled the onlookers was that these arrows weren’t shot at them from behind but from the front.

It was a silent, bizarre attack, and people didn’t even know how this attack was unleashed. Finally, fear and dread gripped their hearts.

“They’re actually all demonic beasts!”

All of the fleeing individuals had the same thing in their blood, so everyone in the crowd quickly realized that they had been used. These demonic beasts had used them to cause trouble for the High Firmament Academy.

"You think you could hide? Did you think that concealing yourself would guarantee your survival?" sneered Long Chen 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

Upon forming hand seals, his vast Spiritual Strength spread. Following that, a majestic dragon cry rang out in the onlookers’ heads.

Dozens of people in the crowd suddenly had their heads explode. Their corpses slowly fell.

What shocked people was that, without exception, all of them possessed the blood of the beast race. Furthermore, looking at their blood, it seemed that they came from the same race.

“Alright, the root of the tumor has been found. Time to treat it entirely.”

Long Chen smiled. However, that smile was incredibly cold.

“Kill them all.”
