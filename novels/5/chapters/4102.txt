Chapter 4091 The Fastest Shortcut to Getting Rich

At this moment, the glorious buildings of the Soaring Dragon Company were in ruins, and people saw a dragon claw pressing into the ground at the center of this devastation. Seeing the elder who was on his last breaths caught underneath that claw, they didn’t dare to believe their eyes. Was this really that arrogant Heaven Venerate?

Even the Huayun Trading Company’s experts were stunned. They had been worried about Long Chen and the others, so they had been pondering how they could protect them when this sudden turn caught them off-guard.

Long Chen took a deep breath. With the support of Heavenly Dao energy, it was like a sledgehammer had a hilt added to it. Not only did it give the hammer greater destructive power, but it also protected the hammer from the backlash. Now, Long Chen could unleash his full power without misgivings.

It was like grabbing the head of a hammer and smashing it into a stone versus grabbing the hilt of the hammer and striking the stone. There was an immense difference between the two. The first one, you couldn’t even unleash your full power for fear of injuring your hand. But with the second one, you could freely smash it as you pleased.

The dragon expert said that Heavenly Dao energy would only be able to provide Long Chen with a limited amount of help. However, in reality, it was incredibly important. After all, he wasn’t from the dragon race and didn’t have an enormous body that could endure the backlash of his own power.

Yu Qingxuan simply stared dumbfoundedly. She also hadn’t expected Long Chen to possess such terrifying power. It had to be known that she had been by his side this whole time. In the Violet Flame Heaven, their combined might had been unable to beat a Heaven Venerate. But in this short time, he had managed to reach the point of being able to beat a Heaven Venerate by himself? This rate of improvement was astonishing!

“Boss, we got it!”

At this time, Xia Chen and the others came flying back, beaming with excitement. They had charged into the treasury, and while Xia Chen broke the formation, Guo Ran and the others broke the bindings on it.

Unable to break open the treasury in such a short time, they chose to take away the entire treasury itself. After all, Long Chen no longer had the black dagger, so they had to use a different method to open it. However, this method was also extremely fast and clean.

“Wow, old fellow, life must be painful for you. I’m a good person, so I’ll free you from your misery!”

Seeing the Heaven Venerate still had a single breath in him, Guo Ran directly shot him with a golden arrow, killing him. Not even his Yuan Spirit could escape.

“So shameless.” Xia Chen looked down on him disdainfully. He knew that Guo Ran would definitely start telling others how he had personally slain a Heaven Venerate. Of all of them, perhaps only Guo Ran would be so shameless as to take advantage of this.

“Let’s go. More people will come soon.”

Xia Chen then took out the flying boat and embarked with the others, soaring into the sky. Just after their departure, a group of intimidating individuals descended, causing the onlookers to hastily flee in fear.

“One, two, three, four… Heavens, they sent nine Heaven Venerates! The Soaring Dragon Company’s reaction speed is fast!”

Long Chen and the others had plundered the Soaring Dragon Company in an instant, being unbelievably efficient.

However, the Soaring Dragon Company’s reaction speed was also shockingly fast. The transportation formations were clearly broken, so how did they arrive so quickly?

Other than the nine Heaven Venerates, there were also hundreds of Earth Venerates, all of them filled with killing intent. When they saw the corpse of the Heaven Venerate, as well as the destruction around them, especially the hole where the treasury was, they all went crazy.

Their gazes roved around, and anyone in the vicinity immediately hid, not daring to look at them.

“Who did this?! Get out here!” shouted a Heaven Venerate.

“Reporting to senior, it was a youngster called Long Chen. He led a group of people over. They… they came from the Huayun Trading Company,” said someone.

That person came from a power that was essentially subservient to the Soaring Dragon Company.

“Huayun Trading Company?”

The Heaven Venerate furiously turned to the Huayun Trading Company’s side.

“But that person called Long Chen already left,” added that person hastily.

“He left?! Even then, the Huayun Trading Company must give us an explanation!”

Just then, the tablets on their waists began to blink, causing their expressions to immediately change.

Another Heaven Venerate cried out in disbelief, “Clear Rain City’s branch is under attack! Could it be…?!”

“We’re going!”

With no time to spare for the Huayun Trading Company, the nine of them used some magical art. The void trembled, and in an instant, they all vanished.

“No way. Long Chen didn’t run and just went to the next one?”

The city's experts were left astonished, their jaws agape in disbelief.

…

BOOM!

A giant cross attack tore through the Soaring Dragon Company’s branch. As a result, the Heaven Venerate in charge hacked up blood, cracks covering his body. He was almost slain with this one attack.

“Good! We’re leaving!”

Long Chen shouted, and they once more got on the flying boat and flew off.

“All of you wait-” The injured elder was about to stop him, only to cough up blood once more. The world then spun around him, and he almost fainted.

“Hahaha, that’s the third one! We're moving twice as fast as the last two times. Clearly, there's a lot of room for us to enhance our teamwork," Guo Ran chuckled.

Long Chen was in charge of barging through the door, Guo Ran and Xia Chen and the others went straight for the treasury, while Yu Qingxuan drew the attention of their enemies with her flames. When the Heaven Venerate appeared, Long Chen would instantly launch a powerful attack that gravely wounded them.

After obtaining the treasury, Long Chen and the others directly left. But after unleashing two all-out attacks, Long Chen was exhausted and unable to unleash the Cloud Dragon Immolation Claw again.

The third time, it was the Dragonblood Legion that combined their power to attack, seriously wounding the Heaven Venerate. Also, in the last two plunders, they didn’t kill the Heaven Venerate. They just took the treasure and left.

“We’ve really struck gold this time. The Nirvana Overflow Heaven’s Dragon Soaring Company is filled with money. Now, we can really compete with Mo Nian,” laughed Xia Chen.

The Nirvana Overflow Heaven’s Soaring Dragon Company was truly packed with treasures, including various materials that they could use. It was so great that they didn’t even recognize all the treasures that they obtained.

Alchemy materials, forging materials, cultivation resources, formation building materials, as long as you could think of it, they were there. Even if you couldn’t think of it, it was still there.

After plundering the Soaring Dragon Company, they felt like their eyes were opened to a greater world. They also felt that their current knowledge was too narrow, as many of the things they obtained were not within the realm of their knowledge.Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

“As expected, plundering the wealthy is the fastest shortcut to getting rich. The amount of guts a person has is the amount of wealth they can produce,” laughed Guo Ran.

Everyone laughed with him, and only Yu Qingxuan was silent.
