Chapter 3281 Immortal King Tiers

Long Chen’s voice resounded throughout the Zhaoming Ancient City. It was calm, but that calmness contained powerful confidence.

It was not a threat, and it was not done to scare others. It was like he was just stating a fact yet also like announcing a heavenly edict.

“Two!”

Long Chen didn’t give them any time to consider this and directly started counting. The atmosphere instantly grew intense. All the experts within the city held their breaths.

This youngster was far too domineering. He was trying to subdue the entire Vile Dragon Domain in one go.

Just as Long Chen was opening his mouth to count to three, the void shuddered and two figures appeared in front of Long Chen.

One was a tall and thin man in blood-colored armor. He had a spear on his back and emitted soaring Blood Qi.

The other one had sideburns and a beard. His eyes were like copper bells. Also, he had a huge hatchet on his back, and his killing intent was particularly stifling.

The one with the spear was the Iron Blood Mercenary Group’s leader, while the one with the beard was the master of the Blood Drinking Alliance. Both of them looked at Long Chen coldly.

The mercenary leader sinisterly said, “Brat, are you not afraid that the two of us would join forces and kill you all right here?”

In the end, Long Chen managed to force both of them out. However, they were both infuriated.

“Since I dare to come here and call myself boss, I naturally must have the ability to be the boss. If I didn’t have the ability to control everything, I wouldn’t come here and embarrass myself. If the two of you feel that just killing Qiu Yang wasn’t enough, then I welcome any of you to come and provoke me. I don’t mind killing two more,” said Long Chen indifferently.

“You’re crazy!” said the mercenary leader coldly.

“Just this is called crazy? No, no, no. That’s because you still haven’t seen when Boss Long San is really crazy. Even a World King like Enpuda isn’t placed in my eyes. I’ll say something that you won’t like to hear. In front of a few Mortal tier Immortal Kings, there’s entirely no need for me to go crazy. I know that you are all ruthless characters, and I myself am specialized at killing ruthless people. It seems that my friend’s sword alone was unable to shake you. Then I’ll give you another chance. Anyone who doesn’t submit, come out and challenge me. Of course, it would be no problem even if all four of you came at me together,” said Long Chen.

After hearing this, their expressions changed. Long Chen was too arrogant. He actually wanted to fight all four of them together?

“Foolish little brother, with how handsome you are, how could big sister be willing to fight you?” Jiang Yuhe was the only one who smiled.

Jiang Yuhe was quite smart. She didn’t do anything that she wasn’t assured of. As she was unable to see through Long Chen, she didn’t make any rash decisions. Being the first to give up on this challenge was quite a smart decision. It both gave face to Long Chen and a way out for her.

As for Zhao Qinglong, he didn’t say a word. He had lost his Little Spirit King Qiu Yang and was now the weakest of the four major powers. He had no right to be arrogant at this time.

He wished for the Blood Drinking Alliance and the Iron Blood Mercenary Group’s leaders to attack Long Chen. That way, he could see just how strong Long Chen was.

However, he was disappointed that the two of them were no fools. Although they acted tough, they had only come to test the waters. To have them challenge Long Chen while Zhao Qinglong and Jiang Yuhe merely watched? They wouldn’t do something so foolish.

“What do you want?” demanded the Iron Blood Mercenary Group’s leader. Although his tone was cold, he very clearly didn’t want to do something he couldn’t win.

“I don’t want much. I just want to cooperate for something big. I was originally going to talk with you with good intentions, but you didn’t seem to want to. When I was little, my mom made me read books. She said after reading books, you can talk reason with others. When I grew up though, I learned that while I could talk reason, others wouldn’t listen. I realized that this method was no good, so I started cultivating with all my power just so that I could force people to talk reason with me. So killing people isn’t the goal. The goal is to make others sit down and talk reason. So I want to know, are you willing to talk reason with me now?” asked Long Chen.

The four leaders were left rattled by Long Chen. They were confused and had no idea what he wanted. Ultimately, it was Jiang Yuhe who said, “Of course we can talk reason. As long as others aren’t taking our food, anything can be discussed. Don’t you think so as well, little brother?”

Long Chen smiled. “I, Long Chen, have walked in this world for so many years, but I’ve never taken other people’s food. Of course, that’s other than my enemies. That’s another story. Don’t worry, I am not interested in your position, nor do I want a portion of this place where even birds don’t crap. I simply want to collaborate. The collaboration will be mutually beneficial, and I won’t take your rice bowls. I’ll even add some extra meat into your bowls.”

“Really?” The leader of the Iron Blood Mercenary Group didn’t fully believe him.Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“I, Long Chen, disdain lying. As for why I went to such pains just to eliminate a single Qiu Yang, it was just so that we could properly talk. If there’s no need to kill more people, then let us simply sit down and chat.” Long Chen waved his hand. A table then appeared along with four seats.

The four of them hesitated slightly, but they all sat down. This indicated that they were willing to listen to Long Chen.

The four of them had only just sat down when the space around them vanished. They jumped in shock and instinctively reached for their weapons.

“No need to worry. This matter relates to certain secrets. I can’t let outsiders listen is all,” said Long Chen indifferently.

Only then did they realize that they were in a peculiar space cut off from the outside world.

They also took note of Bai Xiaole who was behind Long Chen. As they recognized his Three Flower Pupils, their hearts pounded hard. Bai Xiaole appeared completely unremarkable behind Long Chen, but he actually possessed such a terrifying divine ability. This one move from Bai Xiaole further shook them.

In truth, this was also done intentionally by Long Chen. Only by intimidating them could they properly discuss the future.

“Little brother, what kind of good thing did you come here for that requires our collaboration?” asked Jiang Yuhe. She giggled. “It couldn’t be collaborating with me to have children, right?”

Bai Shishi glared at Jiang Yuhe. She felt her to be just like Lu Mingxuan. However, Lu Mingxuan only had a dirty mouth, but this Jiang Yuhe was capable of actually following through.

Furthermore, her clothes that revealed a full view of the mountain valley were definitely a bit unacceptable to a rather conservative woman like Bai Shishi.

In the face of Jiang Yuhe’s teasing, Long Chen smiled. “When it comes to making children, we can consider that later. I want to ask the four of you, if I could offer you a chance to advance from a Mortal tier Immortal King to a Spirit tier Immortal King, would you grasp that chance?”

“What?!”

As soon as Long Chen said this, the four of them shot up, staring in shock at him.
