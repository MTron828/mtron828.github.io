Chapter 4881 Beating the Unbeatable

A full moon emerged behind Huo Qianwu, and countless runes flowed on top of it, its sacred light shrouding the heavens.

Standing before it, with the sacred light shining on her, Huo Qianwu appeared like a holy goddess. Regrettably, her expression looked rather ferocious, contrasting with the sacred light.

As Xing Wujiang observed the intense battle unfolding before him, he sighed, “This is the Heavenly Fate Disk, a symbol of status for Heavenly Chosen, and it’s synonymous with the word unrivaled. Long Chen, my good brother, are you prepared?”

Seeing it, Xing Wujiang knew that Huo Qianwu had started to fight seriously.

As Long Chen wasn’t deterred by the pressure of a Heavenly Chosen, even if he couldn’t win, he should be able to flee. At the very least, he wouldn’t easily die at her hands. However, Xing Wujiang fretted over the possibility of Long Chen refusing to retreat and instead choosing to fight Huo Qianwu to the death.

The Heavenly Fate Disk was something countless people dreamed of possessing. The Heavenly Chosens seemed to have an unfair advantage in life with it, as they became unrivaled beneath the heavens. At this moment, countless people stared enviously at the Heavenly Fate Disk. Other than those few people from the Flame Divine Hall, no one else present had seen a true Heavenly Fate Disk.

“This Doyen power...”

Huo Qianwu’s Doyen power had reached a legendary level, condensing to the point of being liquid.

Normally, Doyen power of Heavenly Doyens was gaseous, akin to a mix of smoke and mist. Yet, despite its ethereal nature, it augmented the Doyens’ abilities exponentially, akin to adding wings to a tiger.

However, the Doyen power emanating from Huo Qianwu was different, forming ripples of energy that transcended mere quantity. There existed a dimensional disparity between the Doyen power of Heavenly Chosens and that of Heavenly Doyens.

With the Heavenly Fate Disk activated, Huo Qianwu looked at Long Chen coldly. “Do you see? This is the Heavenly Fate Disk that many people never get to see. It symbolizes unrivaled power, a testament from the world that I am invincible. An insignificant ant like you could never hope to grasp this power, even with ten lifetimes of training. Now that you’ve witnessed it, you may die without regrets!”

Huo Qianwu’s voice echoed throughout every corner of the world, commanding authority as if she were a deity reigning over her domain.

Everywhere her Doyen power touched became her domain, and even the experts outside the barrier were unable to move under her terrifying pressure. According to normal standards, the one at the core of a domain had to be under a thousand times the pressure. Yet, Long Chen remained remarkably composed even in the presence of her formidable power.

“As I said, I specialize in beating people who think they are unbeatable. Even if you have this bullshit Heavenly Fate Disk, I can still beat you,” said Long Chen lightly.

Now that he was stalled and unable to assist Mo Nian, Long Chen was also in no rush. He didn't hold much hope for finding treasures, given his bad luck. Instead, he preferred to have a proper fight with Huo Qianwu. Encountering such a formidable opponent for the first time ignited his competitive spirit.

Previously, Long Chen had been reluctant to fight her, partly because he didn't want to engage in battle with a woman. However, he now realized he had misjudged the situation. Perhaps it was due to constantly being targeted by the Heavenly Daos, or perhaps it was because he wasn’t a Doyen, but he wasn’t very sensitive toward the fluctuations of Doyen energy.

Even when Huo Qianwu used the Blaze Dragon Bone Whip, Long Chen didn’t view her as a real opponent. He only wanted to get rid of her to help Mo Nian. However, when she summoned the Heavenly Fate Disk, Long Chen finally recognized her as a real opponent. He also understood why Xing Wujiang would repeatedly warn him to be careful with Heavenly Chosens, even subtly hinting that it wasn’t embarrassing to run when facing them. Long Chen appreciated his concerns, but what Xing Wujiang didn’t know was that the stronger the opponent, the more easily Long Chen’s fighting spirit was ignited.

Long Chen’s blood started to heat up, and his fighting spirit blazed.

Huo Qingwu coldly said, “Frogs at the bottom of a well have no experience, so they are always blindly ignorant. You will pay the price for your foolishness.”

Unexpectedly, Long Chen stuck Evilmoon under his armpit and clapped for a moment before putting it back on his shoulder. He taunted, “Wow, I didn’t expect you to be able to say something so correct. It’s rare for someone to have such an accurate judgment of themselves.”

Hearing this provocation, Huo Qianwu exploded with rage. Clearly, in terms of cursing people, she couldn’t compare to Long Chen.

The Heavenly Fate Disk behind Huo Qianwu quivered, and flames appeared all around it. In an instant, this world became a sea of fire.

“What kind of flame is that?!” Startled cries rang out. Even through the barrier, they felt like they would melt. If they were inside, even if their bodies could survive, their souls wouldn’t.

“That’s the Doyen Flame, a terrifying flame that can amplify any flame within the heavens. Even an ordinary beast flame can unleash hundreds or thousands of times its original power when boosted by the Doyen Flame,” explained a Heaven Saint.

All of them knew that Huo Qianwu was a heavenly genius of the Flame Divine Hall, which possessed countless Heavenly Flame seeds. Hence, whatever flame she controlled had to be absolutely terrifying. However, what Huo Qianwu was displaying was merely the Doyen Flame, and that was enough to ignite the very world, turning it into a blazing flame sea. They couldn’t imagine how terrifying it would be when she summoned her core flame.

Unexpectedly, Long Chen just looked at Huo Qianwu indifferently. “Don’t blame me for not warning you. You shouldn’t bother with any senseless probing blows. Don’t think about beating me with the tiniest bit of power. Make sure to deal a thunderous blow from the start while I still haven’t figured out your techniques. That’s your only chance.”

“Ignorant fool!”

Huo Qianwu was enraged by Long Chen’s expression. She had thought that this Doyen Flame would be enough to crush him mentally, but he completely looked down on it. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

Countless runes lit up on the Heavenly Fate Disk behind Huo Qianwu, condensing into a golden bird. When it appeared, startled cries rang out.
