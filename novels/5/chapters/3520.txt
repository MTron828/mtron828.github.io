Chapter 3509

Long Chen pretended not to see these people’s gazes. Instead, he looked at Yu Qingxuan. She was a pure person and hadn’t seen through these subtle changes in expression. However, she was very happy to have Long Chen come with her.

Including Long Chen, there were sixteen people, and they all went up to the restaurant. As for the others, they scattered.

Amongst these sixteen people were two elders. They were Yu Qingxuan’s guards, and they were solemn and serious. They hadn’t said a word the entire time, nor did they seem like they were going to. Their eyes were closed.

Long Chen could sense that from the start, the two of them had been keeping their Spiritual Strength dispersed throughout the air. They were clearly guaranteeing Yu Qingxuan’s safety, making sure to sense even the slightest hostility that approached her.

Long Chen didn’t know just what kind of status Yu Qingxuan had for her to have two fourth Heavenstage World Kings protecting her. Furthermore, based on their cautious appearance, they did seem worried about something happening to Yu Qingxuan.

Once they climbed up the steps to the restaurant, they didn’t just get to see the entire Dragon Blaze Prefecture. From here, the Dragon Blaze Prefecture looked just like a giant dragon entrenched onto a tall mountain. They could see even further areas.

In the distance, they could see streams of lava and volcanoes erupting. They could even see what appeared to be a rain of stars falling from above the nine heavens.

“What beautiful scenery.” Long Chen stepped up, looked around, and couldn’t help praising the view.

“This scenery is something many people will never get to see in their lifetimes,” said one man calmly, his tone one of slight disdain.

“That’s true. If it weren’t for fairy Qingxuan, I would never get to see such scenery in this lifetime. I’ve made sir laugh. Hehe, what a wretched laugh,” said Long Chen.

That person clearly didn’t hear Long Chen’s hidden meaning. Seeing Long Chen react this way, he looked down on him even more, but he didn’t press things. If he intentionally targeted Long Chen, he might draw Yu Qingxuan’s ire.

When they arrived at their table, Long Chen snatched the spot beside Yu Qingxuan and then pretended to look around foolishly.

“Why? Did I sit in someone’s spot?”

The atmosphere grew tense. Every single person wanted to sit beside Yu Qingxuan, but on the surface, they were prepared to modestly decline. Yet, this brazen fellow had actually taken it first.

He, someone with no background or status, actually had the face to ask them such a question? Could it be that he really didn’t know how wrong he was? Upon seeing his blank expression, these people’s expressions grew unsightly.

“It’s fine. Let’s all just sit wherever! It’s our first meeting, so let’s relax!” said Yu Qingxuan hastily, having sensed that the atmosphere was a bit off.

Since she had said this, everyone could only sit. However, the atmosphere was tense because Long Chen took the important seat. These people already felt contempt for him, but Long Chen dared to be so shameless as to sit right beside Yu Qingxuan. It was definitely a toad squatting beside a swan. Hence, their hearts were burning with rage.

“Everyone, don’t be so serious. Let’s all introduce ourselves. I’ll start. I am Yu Qingxuan, and I come from the Daluo Star-Field,” said Yu Qingxuan. She was starting to sense that these people were targeting Long Chen, and she was getting worried. However, she wasn’t worried about herself but that these people would make things hard on Long Chen. She had invited Long Chen here out of kindness, so she was afraid that Long Chen would end up in a worse position because of her.

“I am Feng Xiang, and I am from the Chaotic Star Sea. From my ancestors, I inherited the Dragon Blaze bloodline. My father is the city lord, a seventh Heavenstage World King. So, once I reach the World King realm, I will probably have to endure the hard work that he went through,” said Feng Xiang lightly.

Although he said that he would suffer, he was clearly proud. His meaning was that in the future, he would be the lord of the Dragon Blaze Prefecture.

His father was actually a seventh Heavenstage World King. That was truly a very terrifying existence. Long Chen was unable to imagine just how powerful a seventh Heavenstage World King would be.

“I am Zhao Mingxuan. I come from the Ancient North Star-Field’s Raging Flame Heavenly Palace. My master is the Raging Flame Heavenly Palace’s master and also a seventh Heavenstage World King. I’ll also have to deal with some bitter suffering like brother Feng Xiang. Most likely, the position of palace master will fall on my shoulders,” said the man that had helped Feng Xiang out of his embarrassing predicament before.

“I am Wu Yang. I am from the Golden Crow Star-Field’s Three-Foot Golden Crow race, and I’ve just awakened my immemorial bloodline. Also, I have always wanted to exchange blows with experts in the same realm but never found a good opponent. Although you don’t have much flame energy, the power of your Blood Qi is strong. Are you interested in exchanging pointers?” A pair of sharp eyes stared at Long Chen coldly, along with golden light.

Although the others were just introducing themselves and had their hostile gazes occasionally flicking toward Long Chen, this Wu Yang actually challenged Long Chen directly.

This made Yu Qingxuan’s expression change. But Long Chen simply smiled. “I’m not an expert. Sir seems to have picked the wrong opponent.” Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

Seeing Long Chen admit his inferiority, Wu Yang smiled disdainfully. That disdain simply overflowed from every part of him.

Long Chen was also sneering inside. He didn’t have time to play these games with them. The more they bullied him, the happier he was.

Long Chen was very familiar with Yu Qingxuan’s character. For a kind person like her, the weaker he seemed, the more she would look after him. Hence, these fellows were inadvertently helping him.

Furthermore, these fellows were all raising their noses high into the air, showing off and looking down on him. Idiots like them wished to pursue Yu Qingxuan? They had to be dreaming. They couldn’t even see how distasteful Yu Qingxuan found this. Were their heads full of crap?

Following that, others continued to report their names and backgrounds. It had to be said that their backgrounds were truly very terrifying. Every single one of them had a major background.

“We’ve introduced ourselves. Brother, it’s your turn. Let us hear your glorious background.” The last person finished introducing himself and then directly made things hard for Long Chen.

Yu Qingxuan felt a trace of regret now. She regretted coming here, or perhaps it should be said that she regretted inviting Long Chen. She could clearly feel them targeting him. With her kind nature, she hadn’t realized it at the start. But now, she knew that they were targeting him.

However, despite being enraged inside, she didn’t know how to resolve it. Long Chen had helped her out immensely before. If she were to protect him, perhaps he would feel even more inferior inside. She was unable to think of any solutions.

“My glorious background? No, I’m nothing more than a nameless little person who can’t compare to the likes of you all. To tell the truth, I really admire all of you. You can report such a long line of titles, like what sect, what race, your father, your mother, your master, their cultivation bases,” said Long Chen.

Upon hearing that, everyone’s expression grew unsightly. Long Chen was clearly mocking them for using their backgrounds to make themselves appear glorious. They hadn’t relied on their own efforts.

“My surname is Long, and my name is Chen. I am an ascender from the lower world,” said Long Chen lightly.

“Do you have no father or mother? Why don’t you report their names?” sneered Zhao Mingxuan.

“If you want to die, I’ll help you out right now.”

At that moment, Long Chen’s face grew frosty, and some killing intent that made all their expressions change erupted. Even those two fourth Heavenstage World Kings opened their eyes, staring in shock at Long Chen.
