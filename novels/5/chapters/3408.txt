Chapter 3397 Elephant Emperor War Chariot

With Ying Bokong flying at full speed, in just a day and night, Long Chen could already sense several powerful auras rushing in the same direction from a distance away. They truly traveled quickly.

Those who dared to travel so recklessly were all powerful existences that were unafraid of being surrounded and besieged.

As for Long Chen, people had tried to stop him seven times during this trip. However, those people were all directly killed with a slap.

Although Long Chen’s aura was suppressed, true experts would be able to sense the pressure that a person gave them. So, those who would block him were all second-rate trash. Long Chen couldn’t be bothered to waste words with them.

As for Ying Bokong, he had gained quite a few spatial rings during this time, making plentiful gains. As a fellow demonic beast, there were many things that they had that were useful to him. So, it could be said that Long Chen had brought him an immense fortune.

After this day and night of flying, Long Chen started seeing auspicious clouds filling the sky. Also, the spiritual qi was extremely dense, and multicolored light shone throughout this place. It was like a rainbow sea.

“Master, this is the Auspicious Cloud Prefecture, the most flourishing prefecture of the entire Integral Heaven Star-Field. Other than those participating in the Divine Lord Immortal Realm’s opening, there are no other outsiders. Even for our Falling Star Gate, other than the disciples, there are only ten people with a spot to participate in the gathering. In this place, as long as you have money, you can buy anything that you dream of,” said Ying Bokong excitedly as he watched the auspicious clouds roil.

This was his first time coming to the Auspicious Cloud Prefecture. It was a famous location that had changed the fates of countless people. It was somewhere people dreamed of coming to.

“Scram!”

Suddenly, a large man like an iron tower came crashing toward the two of them in an ancient chariot. He was like a meteor.

This was a powerful human expert, with a very powerful Blood Qi. Such a thing was rare amongst humans.

As for the chariot, it was unknown what material it was made out of. However, it was heavy and ancient, giving off a wild desolate qi. As a result, the space in front of it was constantly compressed and exploding from its pressure.

Moreover, it was incredibly fast. Long Chen was staring at the rainbow mist when it reached him.

Long Chen then pulled Ying Bokong, and they instantly moved like lightning, avoiding the chariot.

“Eh?”

A surprised sound came from inside the chariot. It seemed that the owner was quite surprised that Long Chen could dodge.

However, it simply whistled by at top speed. Although the driver had shouted at them to get out of the way, he hadn’t actually given them the time to do so. Furthermore, he was crashing the chariot straight at them, clearly with the intent to kill the two of them.

Long Chen was infuriated. This fellow was too arrogant. If he hadn’t been caught off-guard, he would have smashed that chariot apart.

“It’s the Elephant Emperor War Chariot! The Mammoth Divine Elephant race has also come. The person inside is definitely set to be the Mammoth Divine Elephant race’s next leader. Otherwise, they wouldn’t be qualified to use the Elephant Emperor War Chariot,” said Ying Bokong. He was covered in cold sweat. With that speed, if it hadn’t been for Long Chen pulling him aside, he would have crushed to bits. It was only after a moment that he recovered his wits and said, “Many thanks for saving my life, master.”

The Mammoth Divine Elephant race? Long Chen was slightly surprised. He had heard of it before. It was quite famous and was said to be a species from the immemorial era, one of the brute power-oriented demonic beasts.

The one controlling the chariot actually possessed such astonishing Blood Qi, but that human was nothing more than the driver. The true expert was inside.

Even so, that person had not revealed themself, and the chariot was also concealing their aura. However, just as the war chariot flew by, Long Chen vaguely felt a Blood Qi as vast as a sea. There was definitely a terrifying expert inside.

“Something huge might just occur. The Lightning Falcon race’s emperor bloodline has appeared, as well as the new leader of the Mammoth Divine Elephant race. This opening of the Divine Lord Immortal Realm will definitely not be simple. Those two races possess their own inheritance lands specialized for their own advancement, so they would normally only send a few members to give some face to the Sacred Pill Hall. Master, you also said that you sensed several powerful auras on the way. It seems that this time, it’s going to be extraordinary,” said Ying Bokong.

“It would be best if it wasn’t ordinary. I really did come at the right time.” Long Chen smiled. Wu Tian had truly picked the best spot. He had actually sent him here. If Long Chen didn’t grasp this chance, he would be letting down his big brother.

When they got closer to the auspicious cloud region, Long Chen clearly felt the spiritual qi grow more abundant. Furthermore, the closer they got, the more abundant it was.

They quickly saw the prefecture city, and even Long Chen had never expected this city to be so huge.

There was already a long line in front of the gates. According to Ying Bokong, they had just started, so the line wasn’t too long. If they had taken a few more days, the line would probably stretch for ten thousand miles.

There were eight entrances. Every entrance had quite a few experts lined up, and only one entrance had no queue.

That was the entrance for foreign experts. With that, Ying Bokong entered through a different entrance, while Long Chen went to that one alone.

There were two stern-faced elders by that gate. Their faces were covered in wrinkles, and their Blood Qi had already declined. Although they were Heaven tier Immortal Kings, they were so old that it was like they had turned into wood.Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

A Heaven tier Immortal King had a lifespan of hundreds of thousands of years. So, for these elders to be in this state, they had probably reached their limit. Their expressions naturally weren’t too good. When Long Chen arrived, they almost seemed to be asleep. Only when Long Chen knocked on the table did they finally raise their eyes at him.

It seemed that they were dissatisfied with how he had knocked on the table, so they irritably tossed a tablet to him and pointed to the stone tablet at the side without a word.

Long Chen eyed the tablet. It told people how to register with it. They just had to carve their own name and add a drop of blood on it to register.

Long Chen then wrote Long San, only to accidentally add a Boss, turning it into Boss Long San. Long Chen wanted to ask if he could change it, but he found that those two elders were completely ignoring him. It was like they were sleeping.

Long Chen frowned. If they were going to be so uncaring, he wouldn’t care either. He directly dripped a drop of blood on it, and the tablet flashed.

After that, the elder received the tablet, wrote something else on it, and then returned it to Long Chen. He then waved his hand as if telling Long Chen to scram.

He entered just like that? Was there no need to confirm his status? They didn’t even ask Long Chen anything. He was surprised by this.

However, just as he entered the gate, a group of people surrounded him with unfriendly expressions.
