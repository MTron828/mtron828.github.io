Chapter 4738 Attacking the Future Father-in-Law

When Long Chen heard this news, he exploded with rage. He was already irritated enough at the thought of needing to consume so many medicinal pills, so he immediately rushed out. With a sweep of his divine sense, he instantly located Bai Xiaole.1

As he flipped the lightning wings on his back, he shot off like a bolt of lightning toward the east side of the academy. Long Chen sensed a terrifying aura from there—the aura of a Sage King.2

The mountain range here lay in ruins, and the sky was marred by many cracks. Behind Bai Xiaole, the Violet Pupil Nine Tail Fox had manifested its true form, its projected huge eyes dominating the heavens and earth.0

Those two eyes were fixed upon a large cloaked figure, and the figure’s hands pressed against the void, using brute force to hold back these eyes.0

BOOM!2

Suddenly, those two huge eyes exploded, causing Bai Xiaole to scream, with blood pouring from his eyes. However, he didn’t retreat. Instead, he jumped onto the Violet Pupil Nine Tail Fox’s head and abruptly shut his eyes, becoming motionless as his aura dissipated.0

Just then, the Violet Pupil Nine Tail Fox’s aura grew explosively as their souls merged, and its claw raked down.0

“Your flippant temper hasn’t improved at all. You only have this little bit of ability,” sneered the man concealed within the cloak.5

Hearing that, Long Chen was enraged. Without hesitation, he grabbed Evilmoon’s hilt and projected his killing intent toward that man.0

“What the fuck?!” That man let out a startled cry. Suddenly, Evilmoon sliced through the air. A fierce will to rend the heavens themselves unfurled, shaking the very foundation of the world.1

“You idiot!” That man cried out. He suddenly formed hundreds of hand seals in an instant, and his aura changed.0

“Hundred Ghosts Seal the Heavens!”1

With a shout, a strange creature appeared behind him. It bore two horns and cascading hair that reached down its feet, clad in an ancient robe. Ghostly qi permeated the world around it. 0

That creature manifested just as the man completed the final hand seal. It clapped its hands together, unleashing countless illusions resembling Ghost Ships which then formed a giant seal in the sky.1

BOOM!2

Evilmoon instantly cleaved the seal apart and was about to strike the man, but the man also slammed his hands together, catching Evilmoon’s blade.0

Evilmoon halted just three inches from his face. Yet, a powerful astral wind blew back his hood, revealing his enraged face.0

When Long Chen saw his face, his fury instantly transformed into confusion. This person was someone he knew.1

“Have you gone crazy?! Why do you want to kill me?! What did I ever do to you?!” roared that man furiously.1

“Vice Palace Master, what are you doing here?” Long Chen was baffled, feeling like his brain was no longer functioning. He had no idea what to do.2

This person was precisely Bai Xiaole’s father, Bai Zhantang.0

“Can’t I be here? You are too vicious. Someone else would already be dead because of your attack!” roared back Bai Zhantang, his spittle flying into Long Chen’s face.0

Long Chen had never imagined that the one attacking Bai Xiaole was his own father, his future father-in-law. Being barked at by Bai Zhantang, Long Chen didn’t know what to say.0

“I only knew that someone was attacking Bai Xiaole, so I rushed over.” Finally, Long Chen managed to spit out an explanation. He didn’t know who had sent him such a flawed report.3

No matter how arrogant he was, there was no way he would slash his own future father-in-law. After all, he still needed to marry his beloved daughter.0

“I was the one who sent the report. I told that person not to tell Long Chen the truth,” said someone. Just then, a woman walked over from a distance. It was Bai Shishi.10

“You…!” Now, Bai Zhantang was even more enraged, his hands quivering. “They all say that women always leave the family and join their husbands. They really are right. Count yourself vicious.”0

Long Chen’s attack had been merciless. Had Bai Zhantang not unleashed one of his trump cards in time, this attack would have taken half his life.0

“Who told you to bully Xiaole?” countered Bai Shishi frostily.0

Bai Zhantang was baffled, looking at Bai Shishi and then Bai Xiaole. With an inconceivable expression, he asked, “You’ve started to care for him?”5

After wiping the blood off of his face, Bai Xiaole roared, “So what?! Other than bullying me, what are you good at? Now that my boss is here, let’s see if you can beat him!”1

Only now did Long Chen comprehend what was going on. It appeared that upon Bai Zhantang's return, he had immediately sought to test his son. However, for some inexplicable reason, he had been extremely heavy-handed. Unable to just stand idly by, Bai Shishi orchestrated this scheme.2

As a result, in his enraged state, Long Chen didn’t even bother asking any questions and immediately attacked, almost killing his future father-in-law. Thinking about this, Long Chen didn’t know whether to laugh or cry.0

“He’s your father?” With the battle over, the Violet Pupil Nine Tail Fox returned to Bai Xiaole’s shoulder and said, “No wonder he was so vicious. Sorry, I didn’t know that. I shouldn’t have said those things.”0

“What did you say?” asked Long Chen.0

The Violet Pupil Nine Tail Fox spread its claws, awkwardly replying, “I said… I said… I’d beat him until he knelt… and called me daddy…”7

In the end, it was so embarrassed that it covered its mouth.1

“What the fuck?”0

Long Chen almost spat out blood. No wonder Bai Zhantang had been so brutal. After hearing such a thing, of course he would beat his son senseless until their familial roles were crystal clear. This hierarchy couldn’t be muddled.2

Bai Shishi still looked frosty, clearly not going to apologize for her actions. As for Bai Xiaole, he was clenching his teeth stubbornly, and only the small fox was covering its face awkwardly. Now that it knew this conflict stemmed from its words, it felt guilty.5

Seeing this scene, Long Chen could only bravely say, “Vice Palace Master, how could you not inform us that you were back? It’s all a misunderstanding. Little Nine is just a little fox, so I trust you won't hold it against it. Besides, you witnessed Xiaole’s remarkable improvement. You should be happy.”2

When Bai Zhantang heard that, his expression softened. Bai Xiaole’s growth had definitely surprised him, to the point that he had to unleash his full power to suppress Bai Xiaole. Naturally, he felt pleased by his son's growth.1

He naturally wouldn’t quibble with Little Nine. However, his ire was directed at how Bai Shishi had manipulated Long Chen into attacking him, which left him discontented. After all, he never felt satisfied by this future son-in-law.0

Seeing the smile Long Chen was holding, Bai Zhantang didn’t argue and just snorted. “His power might have grown, but so has his temper. He doesn’t even want to be my son anymore. Fortunately, I have broken through, or wouldn’t I be dead now?”0

“That’s right, Vice Palace Master, your cultivation base… how has it risen to this realm?”1

Long Chen was baffled by Bai Zhantang’s growth.0

“This isn’t the place to talk. Let’s talk in the academy.”0

As Bai Zhantang walked off coldly, Long Chen gave Bai Xiaole a look. Not daring to defy Long Chen, Bai Xiaole followed him.0

On the other hand, Bai Shishi didn’t want to come with them. Just as she was about to walk off alone, Long Chen grabbed her hand, causing her to blush. Although she was extremely unwilling, she let Long Chen drag her along.
