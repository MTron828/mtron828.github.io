Chapter 3968 Escaping the Sea of Bitterness

“Brother Yifeng, you have a knack for arriving at the right time. I just finished cooking this fish. Come, let’s have a feast.”

A three-foot-long fish that looked a bit like a swamp eel was being grilled at the moment. The oil was running down its body, and its fragrant smell made people drool.

Long Chen took out two elegant wine bowls and poured out some wine.

“Wow, big brother, you know how to live! When I heard that Princess Qianxue sent you to raise fish, I thought that you would be depressed. But your attitude is good. Let me raise you a toast as an apology for my mistake.” Zhu Yifeng had originally come to comfort Long Chen. After all, his current position was caused by him. Even if he was cursed by Long Chen, he had to accept it.

Unexpectedly, Long Chen was doing very well and was actually cooking fish here. The fishing ground here was the royal family’s, so they only raised precious species of fish.

Hence, the meat of these fish was exceptionally delicious and also had a nourishing effect. It could be directly turned into a medicinal pill. As they were top grade fish with shocking value, ordinary people couldn’t afford to eat them.

“Haha, that’s nothing. But I’ll drink to it.” Long Chen laughed. It was only once he arrived that he found that this was actually a good place.

How could he not? There were many precious fish here, and Long Chen didn’t plan to just watch them. He had been looking for a good fish to eat when he noticed a golden dragon fish baring its fangs at him. Long Chen naturally decided to pick it up and tossed it onto the grill.

“Wow, this wine is amazing!” Zhu Yifeng exclaimed. It was his first time drinking such fine wine. “Wait, is this from the…”

“Of course. Other than the Wine God Palace, who can produce such divine wine? Drink as much as you want!” Long Chen had almost no friends in the Vermilion Bird Empire. Hence, when a friend had come to drink with him, he was happy and directly filled his bowl again.

Zhu Yifeng drank three bowls, overjoyed with this feeling. So this world actually possessed such beautiful wine? In comparison, the other fine wines that he had drunk were water.

“Don’t just drink the wine. Let’s eat the fish too. I have a feeling that this is no ordinary fish. Its meat will definitely be delicious.” Long Chen used chopsticks to send a mouthful of the fish into Zhu Yifeng’s mouth. It instantly melted, its juices filling his mouth. It was fatty but not greasy; it was exceptionally delicious.

“Wow, what fish is this? It’s so delicious! I’ve never tasted it before!” Zhu Yifeng tasted the fish, and his eyes lit up. This fish was better than all the other fish he had ever tasted as a prince of the empire.

“Hehe, I don’t know the name of the fish, but if you like it, I’ll fish up a few more for you. In any case, I’m in charge here. Furthermore, Princess Qianxue isn’t bad. She sent me medicinal plants and fish. I might have misjudged her. Let’s raise another toast!” With the fish’s meat in his mouth, Long Chen raised his wine bowl again.

Zhu Yifeng sighed with satisfaction. He felt like he had reached the peak of his life.

“Big brother, I can say that Princess Qianxue might have a bad temper, but she actually isn’t much of a schemer. She is the one who poses the least threat to me amongst the princes and princesses. That’s the only reason I dared to come here. If it was someone else, I wouldn’t dare to come. I’d be afraid that they would do something to me,” sighed Zhu Yifeng.

“Exactly. This isn’t a bad place. Once I marry Qingxuan, I’ll make sure that she lives a carefree life, away from this scheming place. Let’s make sure that the wine doesn’t stop!” Long Chen raised his wine bowl again.

The two of them chatted as they drank and ate. Zhu Yifeng seemed to have found a confidante and began to spout all his complaints. For example, his mother was too harsh, his father was too cold, and his brothers and sisters were fighting each other. It was like he was lost in the sea of bitterness.

“I don’t know when I’ll be able to escape the sea of bitterness,” sighed Zhu Yifeng.

“You’ll be able to escape the sea of bitterness very soon.”

Just then, an icy voice rang out. It was Yu Qianxue’s. At this moment, icy killing intent radiated out of her, and she glared at Long Chen like she was going to eat him alive.

Yu Qianxue had hundreds of guards with her, many of which Long Chen had not seen before. All of them were powerful experts, and some of them did not possess weaker auras than Yu Qianxue herself.

“Oh, there are so many of you! Sorry, but I only cooked one fish. It’s not enough for all of you. If you had told me you were coming, I would have cooked a few more,” said Long Chen.

“Princess Qianxue, sit. Let’s eat together! This fish is too delicious! And there’s wine too!” Zhu Yifeng pulled out a seat for Yu Qianxue.

“You can eat it yourself. This might just be your final meal. Make sure to eat more so that you don’t lose out,” said Yu Qianxue frostily.

“Princess Qianxue, what are you saying? Isn’t it just a fish? You wouldn’t kill the two of us for that, right?” Zhu Yifeng laughed awkwardly.

“I won’t kill you, but someone else will. You two fools have also implicated me. Long Chen, you ill omen, are you trying to get me killed?!” raged Yu Qianxue, her patience gone.

Zhu Yifeng’s expression changed and he suddenly had a bad feeling. As he looked back at the grilled fish, his heart thudded. With a quivering voice, he asked, “Big brother, did this fish have seven colors?”

“Nope!” Long Chen shook his head.

“Oh, thank goodness. I almost pissed myself. As long as it’s not seven colors, it’s fine.” Zhu Yifeng sighed with relief.

“Why don’t you tell me how many colors its scales had?” asked Yu Qianxue.

“Five,” said Long Chen directly. He remembered this.

“Then adding on the lips and whiskers?” said Yu Qianxue coldly.

“I wasn’t paying attention. Now that you mention it though, it seems that they were different colors…” Long Chen nodded.

Crash.

“Brother Zhu, what’s wrong? Why do you look like that?” Long Chen saw Zhu Yifeng sitting on the ground, his face pale and his entire body limp.

“Big brother, we’re dead. We’re definitely dead. You cooked my imperial father’s most-beloved Seven Color Dragon Fish!” Zhu Yifeng wept, scared out of his wits.

“No wonder it was so delicious! So it’s what the emperor eats!” exclaimed Long Chen.

“You don’t know anything. That was the Seven Color Dragon Fish my imperial father was raising as a tonic. Its gallbladder is used to refine the Three Flower Heaven Ascension Pill. Do you know what the Three Flower Heaven Ascension Pill is?” Yu Qianxue had the urge to kill Long Chen. He still hadn’t realized just how grave of a mistake this was. He thought it was as simple as just eating a fish.Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

“I know. It’s used by an Earth Venerate to become a Heaven Venerate. The Seven Color Dragon Fish’s gallbladder is one of the main ingredients,” said Long Chen lightly.

“You know?! The Vermilion Bird Empire only has a single Seven Color Dragon Fish! And you… you… you still cooked it?!” Yu Qianxue lacked the words to express her rage. She then grabbed Long Chen’s collar, almost spraying saliva into his face as she no longer cared about royal etiquette.

“His Majesty has arrived!”

Just then, a eunuch’s voice rang out. After that, Long Chen felt a flaming aura approaching. Those flames were flames of fury.
