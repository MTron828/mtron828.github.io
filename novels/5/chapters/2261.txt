Chapter 2251 Hundred Beasts Slaughter

BOOM!

The one hundred and eight peak Magical Beasts attacked in unison. There were swords of light, giant spheres of destructive power, and rays of light that swept through the battlefield.

The Blue Ring Blood race’s experts at the front were enveloped by those attacks before they could react.

Peak twelfth rank Magical Beasts were on par with fourth step Netherpassage experts. The only reason they were at a disadvantage in a fight against them was because their intelligence was too low. Even a third step Netherpassage expert could kill them if they did it smartly. However, their true power was absolutely terrifying. Their attacks were so sharp that even fourth step Netherpassage experts didn’t wish to fight them head on.

These Magical Beasts were under Meng Qi’s control, and even the cast time for their attacks had been shortened by her training.

The battlefield became empty. Even these high ranking races were blown to bits.

The Blood race’s sharp charge had been stopped right in its tracks. It was unknown just how many of them had been killed, but the Blue Ring Blood race’s experts hastily retreated, throwing their army into a panic.

“Too terrifying. No wonder Beast Tamers are said to be the most terrifying profession. They have limitless potential.”

This scene shocked everyone. If they were facing a hundred peak twelfth rank Magical Beasts, wouldn’t even a fourth step Netherpassage expert have to flee for their life?

If all their attacks had been concentrated on one spot, wouldn’t that be enough to wipe a fourth step Netherpassage expert out of existence?

Pill Valley and the other powers were all terrified. They suddenly recalled the last battle. Apparently, the Dragonblood Legion hadn’t been forced to the point of even using all their cards. Meng Qi had only used a few of these Magical Beasts back then.

In reality, they were overthinking it. Meng Qi had gone back to the Wild World and captured these Magical Beasts with the drake king’s help after that last battle.

Even though her Spiritual Strength had far surpassed someone in the same realm, she was actually only able to fully control around thirty of them at once.

Just subduing a Magical Beast wasn’t enough. They would just run rampant over the battlefield, attacking both friend and foe. Their potential was very limited that way, and they might even be killed if someone caught their weak point.

However, there was a supreme, heaven-defying treasure within Meng Qi’s hands known as the Myriad Spirit Diagram. After bringing these Magical Beasts into it, she could control them through the diagram.

The only regretful thing was that their intelligence was too low, and their bloodline had regressed too severely to inherit the Myriad Spirit Diagram’s divine abilities.

Long Chen had once sighed over that. If these Magical Beasts could be trained to the same level as Xuan Beasts, then Meng Qi would be able to sweep through the Martial Heaven Continent all on her own.

Meng Qi’s move shocked everyone. If these Magical Beasts were used properly, they would be able to trample the opposition. Just how terrifying was the thought of a legion of Magical Beasts?

However, after the brief chaos after the first attack, the Blood race’s army made their move. The Stone Blood race switched positions with the Blue Ring Blood race, charging up to the front.

Meng Qi formed hand seals, and the Magical Beasts roared again. Their attacks blasted forth across the battlefield once more.

However, this time, their attacks didn’t have the same effect. The Stone Blood race’s experts slammed their hands on the ground, summoning giant, mountain-like shields that blocked the attacks.

Only the ones at the very front were killed. The ones behind them were injured, while the ones at the rear weren’t harmed at all.

After blocking that attack, they pounced. They were now even closer and would quickly reach the Magical Beasts. That would throw them into a panic, and even twelfth rank Magical Beasts would be quickly slaughtered by the millions of Blood race experts.

Meng Qi was preparing to unleash another attack when Long Chen said, “Don’t waste the effort. Good steel must be used on the edge of the blade. Put them away to use at another critical time.”

The other side had already come with a counter play, reducing the effectiveness of the Magical Beasts. Forcing it was meaningless. They would only be able to kill a portion of the Blood race’s army without achieving the real goal.

“Our moves have been probed by the other side. Now is truly the time for a direct clash. Meng Qi, your Magical Beasts can be used for sneak attacks at important moments. Your attacks are the sharpest and possess the greatest killing power. Pay attention to the movements on the battlefield to attack,” said Long Chen. “Brothers, the real battle’s starting. Let these idiots see the true power of the Dragonblood Legion.”

“Kill!”

Long Chen charged to the very front, lightning wings spreading on his back. He was like a bolt of lightning streaking across the battlefield.

“Kill!”

Following Long Chen; Guo Ran, Gu Yang, Li Qi, Song Mingyuan, and the others also charged. The Dragonblood warriors as a whole roared, their voices shaking heaven and earth, their killing intent making the world change color.

BOOM!

A giant saber-image tore out of Evilmoon and slashed down on the Blood race’s army, blasting a straight line through them. It didn’t matter if it was the Stone Blood race, the Blue Ring Blood race, or the Golden Horned Blood race at the rear. They were all killed.

BANG!

However, before his attack could reach the end of the battlefield, a blood-colored fist-image blew it apart.

Out from amongst the Golden Horned Blood race walked an expert covered in blood chains. His head was completely bare of the slightest hair, but he had two horns that looked like they were made of gold.

Long Chen’s heart shook. His intuition told him that this was an extremely powerful opponent. Although his aura was still in the Life Star realm, he gave off an extremely dangerous feeling. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

“Human, come face your death. I want your Spirit Root.” That expert smiled cruelly, looking like a crocodile staring at its prey.

“I feel like I want your Spirit Blood,” said Long Chen, shaking his head. However, he didn’t charge over.

If this Golden Horned Blood expert wanted to play games with Long Chen, he was far too lacking. This Golden Horned Blood expert had countless experts by his side. If Long Chen went over, he would be attacked by the entire group.

Long Chen knew that this opponent was also afraid of the Dragonblood Legion’s experts. He didn’t dare to charge forward for fear that Meng Qi, Chu Yao, and the others would work together to eliminate him.

The Dragonblood Legion was clashing with the Blood race’s army. Gu Yang messaged Long Chen, saying that he was going to reinforce Yue Zifeng. At this time, Yue Zifeng was facing the attacks of many of the Blue Ring Blood race.

Chu Yao, Tang Wan-er, Ye Zhiqiu, Guo Ran, and Cloud were all fighting now, slaughtering their enemies.

Chu Yao, Tang Wan-er, and Ye Zhiqiu’s large-area attacks were extremely effective. Chu Yao joined forces with Liu Ruyan. Liu Ruyan locked the sky, while Chu Yao locked the earth. Willow branches and wooden stakes interwove, forming a giant cage.

Even the Stone Blood race with its powerful earth energy was unable to block their combined attacks.

Tang Wan-er had summoned an endless sea of wind blades, creating a region around herself devoid of any life. After having awakened a heavens’ soul manifestation, Tang Wan-er’s combat power had soared. Wherever her wind blades went, the Blood race’s experts were chopped up like cabbages.

With her sword in hand, Ye Zhiqiu was like an ice goddess. The Blood race’s experts would barely manage to take a few steps within her domain of ice and snow before being turned into ice statues. That was such a frightening sight that the ones behind them ran in terror.

The Dragonblood Legion’s power was stunning. That expert of the Golden Horned Blood race couldn’t sit still. He had no choice but to charge over to Long Chen.

As expected, thousands of other experts followed him. After having drawn people’s attention, their auras were completely exposed.

Qu Jianying and the others gasped. Those experts all possessed such powerful auras that Ye Lingshan felt suffocated. They were all experts amongst experts that had been hiding their auras to bait Long Chen into going over.

“Those fellows are all Netherpassage experts with pure bloodlines. Who would have thought that the Blood race would send such terrifying enemies at us during the initial sounding-out phase?” Qu Jianying was growing worried.

Qu Jianying knew more than most people about the Martial Heaven Continent’s history. Experts on this level had previously only appeared during the late stages of the dark era in the past. However, they were now appearing right at the start. That wasn’t a good omen.

If things were like this already, then what about the battles in the future? Was this dark era really going to close the door on the continent’s history?

“You want to rely on the pressure of a dead ghost’s remnant power to protect yourselves? You’re too immature. Since we’ve come, we’ll force open the door. All that awaits you is death and despair. All you have to do is prostrate yourselves on the ground and wail in anguish.”

The Golden Horned Blood expert arrived in front of Long Chen, his gaze icy.

Long Chen’s originally calm expression instantly became frighteningly cold. “You wish to blaspheme the Sovereigns? Then I’ll use all your blood as an offering!”
