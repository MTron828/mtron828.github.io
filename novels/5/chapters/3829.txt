Chapter 3818 Heaven Swallowing Toad

As Guo Ran had bizarrely vanished, everyone jumped in horror. It happened too suddenly and out of nowhere.

The four of them hastily rushed to Guo Ran’s path. Fortunately, with his armor, he was leaving very clear footprints.

Following those footsteps, they advanced and suddenly saw a giant skeleton ahead.

The skeleton had a giant head and sharp teeth that were like pointed blades. Even after so many years, they hadn’t decayed. They still gave off an incomparably sharp feeling.

This skeleton had four short but powerful limbs. It also had a tail that was a bit like a crocodile’s. But the proportions were all very odd.

Its mouth was almost two-thirds of its body, so its head was huge while its body was small. Its body parts didn’t seem to match very well.

At this moment, its huge mouth was open as if it was roaring or eating something. It was just squatting there, like a mountain of bones sitting. It gave off a very frightening sense of pressure.

“Based on its form, it should be a legendary Heaven Swallowing Toad. Be careful. The Heaven Swallowing race is very frightening,” warned Long Chen.

“I thought that the Heaven Swallowing Toad only had three legs?” said Mo Nian.

“No, the three-legged Heaven Swallowing Toad is called the Heaven Swallowing Golden Toad, the emperor of the Heaven Swallowing Toad race. If it has four legs, it should be one level weaker compared to the Heaven Swallowing Golden Toad bloodline,” explained Long Chen.

After saying that, they continued following Guo Ran’s footsteps. As expected, this fellow had directly gone to that Heaven Swallowing Toad’s skeleton. Furthermore, with the distance between his footsteps, he was clearly running.

It could be imagined that Guo Ran immediately thought that he had found a treasure when he spotted this skeleton, so he ran over excitedly.

As they followed his footsteps, they saw that the footsteps suddenly vanished once Guo Ran reached the leg of the Heaven Swallowing Toad.

“Wait for me here. I’m going to take a look.”

Long Chen stepped forward alone, walking to where Guo Ran’s footsteps vanished. The moment he stepped on that final footprint, light suddenly shot out of the Heaven Swallowing Toad’s countless sharp teeth.

Immense spatial energy then wrapped around Long Chen, and he vanished. Seeing this, Mo Nian, Xia Chen, and Yue Xiaoqian all jumped in shock.

“It’s devouring energy! Xia Chen, guard the outside. Don’t let its mouth close. We’re going in too.” Yue Xiaoqian also walked in.

She had just stepped on that footprint when she also vanished. Mo Nian nodded.

“This is the entrance to the Heaven Swallowing Toad’s space inside its body. Brother, make sure not to let its mouth close. If you want, see if you can take out its teeth. Those are absolute treasures.” Mo Nian patted Xia Chen’s shoulder and walked in as well, vanishing.

“What the fuck?!”

Mo Nian had just entered an extremely spacious world when he let out a shocked cry. He saw endless gold and silver piled into mountains.

This fellow Guo Ran was crazily running around and breaking the mountains of wealth, with Long Chen and Yue Xiaoqian helping as well.

BOOM!

The peak of a multicolored mountain was forcibly ripped out of the ground. It rolled toward Mo Nian.

This thousand-mile mountain was composed entirely of various immortal metals fused together. Its weight was unimaginable. Mo Nian hastily dodged to the side as the mountain smashed into the ground beneath his feet.

“We’re rich! We’re rich!” Guo Ran flew over and hugged that mountain, his limbs dancing with excitement.

“Little fellow, your luck really is amazing! This Heaven Swallowing Toad was probably a terrifying existence when it was alive. It devoured so many treasures.” Seeing that Guo Ran was fine and had actually found such a land of treasures, Mo Nian couldn’t help praising him enviously.

“What’s amazing about it? Without us, if he came in alone, he wouldn’t be able to leave. He’d be trapped to death here,” said Long Chen.

Yue Xiaoqian said, “This Heaven Swallowing Toad was a terrifying existence when it was alive. It devoured an unknown number of experts. It’s also a metal-devouring beast, specialized in devouring various kinds of immortal metal. Once immortal metal enters its body, it can use its power to become impervious to blade or spear. All this immortal metal is its best essence. If it is refined, it will be of incalculable wealth.”Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Hehe, the first thing I thought of when I saw all these immortal metals is that I can now create powerful Dragonblood Battle Armor and Dragonblood Battle Swords. At that time, when all our brothers in the Dragonblood Legion are gathered once more, we’ll be fully equipped. Hmph, anyone who dares to get arrogant in front of me will get flicked away by their underpants!” Guo Ran was extremely pleased. It was like he could already see the scene of him directing the Dragonblood Legion once more.

“Hurry up and gather it all. Xia Chen will get worried if we take too long,” said Long Chen, continuing to tear out the mountains.

Some of these mountains were tens of thousands of miles tall. However, the entire mountain wasn’t actually top tier. It was the area above the waist of the mountain that was the best.

The rest at the bottom was much worse in comparison. As for the stuff at the foot of the mountain, it was practically trash. This was related to the cultivation base of the Heaven Swallowing Toad.

When it was young and weak, it could only devour some lower grade immortal metals to strengthen itself. As its cultivation base grew, so did its power, and it began to devour better immortal metals.

The immortal metals at the peak of the mountains were the very best materials to make World Domain divine items. Before this, Guo Ran and Xia Chen were even anxious about how they were supposed to get so many materials.

As a result, what they thought about directly came to them. After severing the peaks of several mountains, they had enough materials to fully equip every single Dragonblood warrior.

In order to save time, they only took the best parts. After all, it was quite taxing to gather them all.

Other than the mountains, Long Chen also found another region. That was a black swamp. It was a land of death.

Even immortal metals would corrode on contact with it and World Domain divine items would vanish. When Guo Ran saw a hole in the sword that he used to test the black water, he jumped in shock.

“What kind of water is this?! It’s so terrifying!”

“It’s the Heaven Swallowing Toad’s stomach acid. It’s its strongest killing tool. Once it devours its enemies, it is fated that they will die here. That is its most terrifying point. Its stomach is its strongest weapon,” said Yue Xiaoqian.

“Boss, what are you looking at this thing for? Are you serious?” Guo Ran couldn’t help speaking up when he saw Long Chen looking at the black water so studiously.

“Don’t you feel that this is good stuff?” said Long Chen.

“Boss, you’re really going to…?” Guo Ran instantly thought of the Netherworld’s water that Long Chen had once brought back for him.

“It’s no good. This thing will corrode any receptacle.”

However, Guo Ran quickly shook his head. Back then, he had something that could resist the corrosion of the Netherworld’s water. But he didn’t have anything for this.

“I have a method.”

Suddenly, Yue Xiaoqian spoke up.
