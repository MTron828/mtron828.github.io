Chapter 3441 Changes

Long Chen used the movement art he had learned from the Lightning Falcon race. Lightning then wrapped around his body, and he transformed into a Lightning Falcon that sped through the air. Seeing space constantly twisting while experiencing this carefree speed, Long Chen was moved. It was like he had returned to his childhood and Long Tianxiao was helping him ride a horse through the plains.

Long Chen raised his head and roared. As a result, thunder rumbled and he accelerated to the point that even the world around him grew blurry from how fast he was going.

This feeling of speed made him feel like all his vexations were being thrown far into the distance, as if all his worries were no longer a concern.

After leaving the Integral Heaven Star-Field, he was no longer worried about revealing that he knew the secret arts of the Lightning Falcon race. So, he flew at top speed.

In just over two hours, it was no longer a barren wilderness around him. He gradually saw some greenery, and the sparse spiritual qi in the air also increased in density.

At this point, he slowed down a bit. It was no longer a flat land. If he accidentally crashed into a mountain at this speed, he might end up injuring himself.

He quickly saw signs of civilization. This place was still mostly wilderness at this point. The spiritual qi was thin, and there weren’t many people around. When he swept out his divine sense, he found that the people here seemed to be hunters.

Due to the sparse spiritual qi here, there weren’t any ferocious beasts around. There were simply some wild beasts that they could hunt to live off of. Perhaps this sparse spiritual qi was precisely what allowed them to survive here.

Long Chen then paused and saw a small village not too far from him. A few dozen children were running around there, brandishing some sticks and shouting. A man in a crude beast hide was also holding a small club and sternly rebuking anyone whose movements were incorrect.

The children all looked to be around six or seven years old. When the man struck them with his club, they clenched their teeth and cried, but they didn’t make a sound.

There was also a group of women cleaning up some prey and some strong people tidying up weapons. Those were just normal metal weapons, but they were very careful with them. Those weapons were clearly as important as their lives.

Upon seeing this village, a slight ripple appeared in Long Chen’s heart. He thought of a pure and innocent maiden with a slightly dark complexion and large eyes, a maiden that always had a smile on her face.

A necklace of different colored stones then appeared in his hand. It was a very crude and simple necklace that was held together with hemp strings. The stones were also not perfectly circular. It wasn’t all that good to look at.

However, Long Chen had always been looking after it properly. This was something from Xiao Hua, an incomparably pure girl from a small village in the Phoenix Cry Empire’s wilderness, who thought of him as a gift from the heavens.

Long Chen thought of the Martial Heaven Continent and his old friends. He didn't know how they were. Were those that had ascended doing well? Were those that hadn’t ascended accustomed to their new world?

Long Chen sighed. He put away the necklace and continued on his way.

The spiritual qi in the air grew denser as he flew. He gradually started to see tracks from powerful beasts and some cultivators.

Long Chen then saw some small squads fighting a huge bear. That was probably their prey, but it seemed that they had provoked something that they shouldn’t provoke. Just as the seven of them were about to be killed, Long Chen slapped that bear to death.

Having escaped death, those people were all grateful to Long Chen. He asked them some questions and learned that they came from a small town. As for what prefecture they were in, they really didn’t know. It seemed that this place was truly remote.

Long Chen asked them where their town was, and it really was small. The strongest person in this city was only at the Divine Flame realm. This was most likely the result of the sparse spiritual qi limiting their room for growth.

Long Chen asked that expert and learned that this place belonged to the Qingyang Prefecture.

The Qingyang Prefecture wasn’t even able to enter the ranks of the hundred domains and thousand prefectures, because this prefecture had been in ruins ever since an ancient battle. It was only in the last few million years that it once more became suitable for cultivation. This place could not be compared to those other prefectures inside the Heavenly Swell Domain.

The so-called hundred domains and thousand prefectures referred to the intact domains and prefecture cities that survived that ancient battle.

In the immortal world, prefectures made up domains, domains made up star-fields, and star-fields made up heavens. It was said that the entire immortal world had nine heavens but ten lands. That saying was a bit contradictory, but people kept repeating it.

After learning this, Long Chen gave that expert a longevity extending pill, one that could give him an extra thousand years of life. That expert was overjoyed and repeatedly thanked him.

This town was too poor to even construct a transportation formation, so Long Chen could only set off on his own.

When he reached the prefecture city, it finally appeared a bit more like the cultivation world. He asked for their best transportation formation.

This place wasn’t the Heavenly Swell Domain. From here, he was transported to another prefecture city. He then went through seven prefecture cities before reaching the core prefecture city of this domain.

When he came to their greatest transportation formation, he found that there was no one overseeing it. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

He was standing in front of the transportation formation and about to ask for someone’s help when someone spotted Long Chen and jumped in shock.

“Aren’t you Long Chen? The dual champion of the Heavenly Swell Domain’s Nine Prefecture Convention?”

Long Chen hadn’t expected someone to recognize him. He said, “Yes, that’s me. Brother, do you know if this transportation formation can be used?”

This person was in the Four Peak realm. However, his spiritual fluctuations were already growing sluggish. He looked to be in his thirties, but his actual age was definitely not young.

But in the immortal world, it was a person’s realm and power that was respected. Sometimes calling someone brother was raising them up, acting like you didn’t know their age or power.

“Of course you can use it. However, this transportation formation is rarely used. In order to save resources, it isn’t activated at all times. If you wait just a bit, I will inform the city lord to activate the transportation formation. He needs to personally come to unlock it.” That person was overwhelmed with favor at being called brother by Long Chen. He immediately ran off to alert the city lord.

As a result, he didn’t just bring back the city lord; countless experts also came to take a look. The news of the arrival of the dual champion of the Nine Prefecture Convention was quite big here.

The city lord was an Earth tier Immortal King, and he was most likely the apex expert of this region. In the end, shallow waters couldn’t produce big fish. There was no way that this place could compare to the Heavenly Swell Domain.

“Dean Long Chen, your reputation precedes you. I won’t say any superfluous words, do you wish to return to the Heavenly Swell Domain?” asked the city lord.

“Yes, I’ll trouble you to help me out.” Long Chen cupped his fists.

“Dare I ask what the current situation is like there?”

“What situation?” asked Long Chen.

“Do you not know? The Heavenly Swell Domain, the Vile Dragon Domain, and other domains are being attacked. Devils have invaded from another world, and the devil sea has also erupted. Those fiend devils are climbing onto the land in multiple domains. Is our information wrong?” asked the city lord, feeling baffled. Upon hearing this, Long Chen’s expression instantly changed.
