Chapter 3928 The Human Race’s History

Long Chen was sucked into the void that was constantly twisting around him. It was like he was falling into a spacetime passageway, leaving him feeling dizzy and light-headed.

“What’s going on? Why is it different from when I entered?” shouted Long Chen.

“When you came in, you were coming from a major world to a minor world. It was naturally easier to follow that flow. But now that you’re going back, you’re going against the flow. The laws of the major world are pulling you back, so it’s naturally less comfortable,” said the dragon expert.

“Senior, why didn’t I run into everyone in the three thousand worlds? Didn’t you say that I would see my old friends?” asked Long Chen.

“Didn’t you see so many of them? The main reason you had to come here was for my dragon scale, so being able to see so many of your friends was already not bad. Furthermore, do you know what that bronze cauldron you obtained is? Let me tell you, you’ve profited immensely this time. Are you still not happy?”

“No, no… I just miss my friends,” said Long Chen hastily.

This time, he didn’t see Chu Yao, Liu Ruyan, Ye Zhiqiu, Tang Wan-er, Zi Yan, Wilde, and others. He felt a bit empty without seeing everyone.

The one he was worried about most was Wilde. This foolish child had no survival skills. Would he be reduced to a beggar like when Long Chen encountered him for the first time? If that were the case, Long Chen really would die of guilt.

Moreover, it wasn’t just Wilde and his women. Only twenty-seven hundred Dragonblood warriors had appeared this time. The healing warriors in particular had not shown up, not a single one. Thinking of this, Long Chen was full of worry.

He wasn’t dissatisfied with his gains this time, but he was worried about those people. Even just getting to see them for a glance would be good. At the very least, he would get to see how they were.

“Don’t worry and don’t blindly ask around. Destiny will draw you together again. Hehe, however, I really have to say that you did well this time. You won me some face. I finally got to vent a bit after so many years.” The dragon actually laughed, feeling very pleased with Long Chen’s fight.

The most satisfactory thing wasn’t Long Chen’s fighting style, but how he had shown off. That domineering display of his, the icy arrogance, and his air of standing above the rest of the world had particularly satisfied the dragon expert. It was like it was the one who had fought and won.

“Hehe, it’s all thanks to your guidance.” Long Chen took advantage while the iron was hot to directly suck up.

It went without saying that the dragon expert had helped him out immensely. Thus, he was full of gratitude and reverence toward it.

Only now did Long Chen learn that this dragon expert was a terrifying ancestral dragon, someone who had created their own complete bloodline inheritance. Long Chen only obtained a portion of its essence blood and three divine abilities, but that was enough for him to sweep through the three thousand worlds.

Without the ancestral dragon reverse scale, against the monstrous experts like Long Aotian, Kun Tu, the Nine Underworld Luocha, Ji Wuming, Yin Changsheng, Shi Yang, Weng Tianyao, and the others, he would be forced to flee.

With the support of this dragon blood, his body felt full of power, giving him endless confidence. He had relied only on the dragon race’s divine abilities to sweep through his enemies this time. He hadn’t even needed to use a single one of his own techniques.

“Hehe, this time your flattery isn’t bad. I’ll accept it. Now, do you understand why I didn’t have you listen to your grandfather?” said the dragon expert.

Long Chen nodded. “I understand. My grandfather’s control over his power has to be raised to the pinnacle because his power is limited. That powerful control is what grants his limited power such immense killing power. But I am different. Just like the old man says, in front of absolute power, all techniques are meaningless. Rather than focusing on control, it would be better to gain even more power. No matter how much you save and scrimp with a bowl of water, even if you unleash its power to the limit, it will be limited. But a raging river can splash wastefully and still possess shocking power. Rather than saving every little bit, I can expand my power even more. I won’t need techniques then. If I did, it would just mean that I didn’t have enough power.”

“Hahaha, good little fellow. So you’ve finally reached this point. Did you know? Your human race cannot store much energy due to your bodies, so you had no choice but to think of ways to use your power efficiently. Thus, your human race was particularly smart and came up with countless magical arts and divine abilities. Using your own power, you drew out the power of the Heavenly Daos. This increases your attack power and allows you to save your own energy. But then, your human race had many cultivators who reached the wrong conclusion. You constantly studied all kinds of magical arts to increase the efficiency of your attacks, reducing the costs of the attacks. That isn’t to say that drawing out the power of the Heavenly Daos is wrong. The important thing is to base it on your own circumstances. Your human race cared so much about drawing out this energy that you neglected your own power. In the end, your human race grew too dependent on the Heavenly Daos. I will tell you now, in the primal chaos era, your human race’s physical bodies were actually very powerful. Even amongst the ten thousand races, they could squeeze into the top ten.”VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

“Really?!”

Long Chen was shocked. The human race was always said to possess the weakest bodies of the ten thousand races. They could enter the top ten? He couldn’t believe it.

“In that era, your human race didn’t know any magical arts or Battle Skills. They had to rely on their bloodline divine abilities to protect themselves. At that time, your human race’s bloodline was very pure. Mountains could be moved, seas could be overturned as easily as turning a hand. However, your human race was fickle. When the Heavenly Daos changed, they changed along with them. They constantly researched the changes in the Heavenly Daos and used the essence of heaven and earth to strengthen themselves. They gradually formed the path of cultivation. Once the path of cultivation was opened, the path of their bloodlines was shut. As your human race’s magical arts and Battle Skills grew stronger, your bloodline divine abilities weakened. In the end, your physical bodies weakened more and more. Now, your human race’s physical bodies rank near the bottom, but your magical arts are the strongest amongst all races. Furthermore, after your human race set foot onto the path of cultivation, the other races imitated you, spending a great deal of effort on transforming into human form in order to receive the blessing of the Heavenly Daos. However, it is different now. The heavens are no longer the old heavens, but your human race’s cultivation style didn’t change with it this time. Your human race no longer has anyone capable of creating a new cultivation system that adapts to the changes of the Heavenly Daos. Thus, the human race is now much weaker. Compared to the immemorial era, you are much, much weaker. But you cannot place all the blame on no longer possessing such abundant primal chaos qi. The main reason is because your human race no longer understands the Heavenly Daos,” said the dragon expert profoundly.

“Were the Heavenly Daos intentionally changed by some power to target the human race?” asked Long Chen.

The dragon expert didn’t reply, no longer speaking. As a result, Long Chen’s heart shook. Did an existence like this dragon expert also have taboos about this subject?

Suddenly, Long Chen’s vision changed as he reappeared in the Violet Flame Heaven Capital. But even before he fully grasped what he was seeing, a terrifying sensation of death enveloped him. He directly grabbed the Minghong Saber and unleashed a full-power swing.
