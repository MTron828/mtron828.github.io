Staring at Feng Fei’s radiant smile, Long Chen almost cursed under his breath. Who conned people like this? These people hadn’t been welcoming him with open arms to begin with, and now she was only making matters worse.

In traditional clans, outsiders were generally frowned upon, and the more prestigious the clan, the stronger their aversion toward out-marriage. Highly talented young women were particularly coveted by countless young men within their clan.

In this case, marriage outside the clan was seen as a slap in the face to all the young men. It implied that they were not worthy enough, or she would have sought a partner inside the clan.

If the women couldn’t find a suitable match within the clan, they definitely wouldn’t settle with someone mediocre. So for a woman to either marry out or bring in an outsider, it reflected the worthlessness of her clansmen.

With Feng Fei’s beauty and talent, combined with her indescribable noble air, she instantly captivated countless men in the Jiang clan. They praised her as the Jiang clan’s number one beauty.

Now that their number one beauty was holding the arm of an outsider, the Jiang clan’s men felt as if they had been slapped in the face.

Long Chen was speechless. He glanced at Feng Fei from the corner of his eye, but she mischievously stuck her tongue out at him. Her expression told Long Chen that she was intent on conning him to the end.

“Are you not afraid I’ll kill them all?” demanded Long Chen through a spiritual transmission.

“I’m not afraid. Everything is under control,” responded Feng Fei with a cheerful tone.Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

At this moment, a large man with a giant battle-ax on his back stepped forward. “Hey, Long Chen! I challenge you to a fight!”

Long Chen observed this guy. The latter was a Heavenly Chosen, so he wasn’t weak.

“No need. You win,” said Long Chen. He refused to get entangled with these greenhouse flowers, so he simply ignored them.

“You coward!” shouted that man.

“Hey, stop before you go too far! I will not permit insults!” warned Feng Fei hastily.

She knew Long Chen’s character. If someone insulted him, he could just ignore them. However, if this person said something relating to his father or mother, then things would definitely go out of control.

“Gutless coward, come over and fight me! If you can block three blows from me, I’ll kneel and kowtow to you!” shouted that man.

“I’m not interested in something like that,” replied Long Chen, shaking his head.

“You…!” This large man was enraged but didn’t know what to do.

As Long Chen walked over, with Feng Fei following him like a shadow, an emotionless voice rang out.

“Long Chen, is it? I’ve heard of you.”

Long Chen looked over to see a fair-skinned man seated on the plaza. No one was around him, and it seemed that the Jiang clan’s disciples were afraid of him.

His eyes had been closed, but when Long Chen looked at him, he opened them. His gaze was like a sharp sword stabbing into Long Chen’s eyes. If Long Chen’s will wasn’t strong enough, it might have instantly collapsed.

However, when it came to willpower, Long Chen had never submitted to anyone. Long Chen didn’t retreat in the slightest, nor did he counterattack.

“Who did you hear it from?” asked Long Chen.

Long Chen sensed the aura of time from this person. Clearly, he was a sealed expert. What surprised Long Chen even more was that the man’s eyes were like crystals, as if a water screen blocked Long Chen from sensing this man’s true power.

The number of people capable of concealing their power in front of Long Chen was very small, especially those in the same realm, so this person was not ordinary.

“From her,” replied the man as he looked at Feng Fei.

Long Chen also looked at her. Just what was she thinking? He was speechless.

“What did she say about me?” asked Long Chen.

“The moment she walked into the Jiang clan, she said that anyone who wanted to be her husband had to defeat a certain person.” The man stared at Long Chen, making it clear who that person was.

The man continued, “After that, she added that some geniuses might match you in the same realm, but she refused to believe they could beat you.”

“Damn, you really brag about me. Thank you!” said Long Chen sarcastically.

Those words were truly arrogant. If Feng Fei had just replaced “Long Chen” with “Mo Nian”, Mo Nian would be absolutely overjoyed. He might even kowtow toward her in gratitude. He liked that kind of shit the most.

“Feng Fei is our clan’s number one beauty. You should be mentally prepared,” warned that man.

“I’m mentally prepared. Anyone who challenges me, I will immediately admit defeat. Whoever wants to take her can do so!” declared Long Chen, shrugging.

Feng Fei was just joking anyway, so why bother with such a troublesome affair? Hearing Long Chen’s answer, that man was baffled, and Feng Fei angrily punched Long Chen.

Long Chen walked past them just like that. The disciples of the Ye clan and Zhao clan were also present, but Long Chen didn’t even look at them.

Although Long Chen had teased Feng Fei, she wasn’t actually angry. She continued walking alongside him, saying, “That person is Jiang Wuwang. He is the number one expert of our Jiang clan’s junior generation. He is a heavenly genius from the ancient era.”

Long Chen nodded. “His name’s not bad[1]. He does look very steady. At least, he has some brains, unlike certain people who are like bulls in heat, provoking whoever they see.”

“What are you talking about? Do you have to be so crude?” rebuked Feng Fei.

As they strolled, a group of young women holding luxurious platters filled with delicacies headed toward a large palace.

Long Chen said, “Let’s go there. We can eat while we chat.”

Long Chen and Feng Fei then walked into the palace. It was empty, with only a large table covered in hundreds of delicacies. Every single one of them was a rare and delicious treat. Feng Fei looked astonished.

“Long Chen, you’re doing this well in the Long clan?” asked Feng Fei.

“Don’t stand on courtesy. Come on, let’s eat! Otherwise, it’ll get cold,” Long Chen replied, gesturing for Feng Fei to sit as he poured wine and started sampling the delicacies.

Between bites, Long Chen asked about the situation of the four clans. He learned that they housed a number of sealed heavenly geniuses of the ancient era. The Jiang clan had four of them in particular, with the one Long Chen encountered being the most formidable among them.

The Zhao clan and Ye clan’s strongest geniuses were Zhao Qingtian and Ye Lingxiao[2]. Long Chen frowned when he heard their names.

Feng Fei couldn’t help but ask, “What is it?”

“After hearing those names, I feel like they’re going to provoke me,” replied Long Chen.

Feng Fei laughed. It was just a name. How could it be taken so seriously?

“Long Chen, what are you doing?!” A flustered voice rang out, almost on the verge of tears.

Feng Fei and Long Chen turned to see who had interrupted their meal and conversations.
