Chapter 3521

BOOM!

Long Chen’s fist struck the winged devil race expert’s palm like a bolt of lightning. A huge heaven-shaking explosion then erupted.

“If you dare to harm a single hair on her body, I will tear your corpse into ten thousand pieces and grind your bones to dust!” roared Long Chen. Black qi swirled out of his body, and his killing intent was overflowing. He was standing in front of Yu Qingxuan.

Seeing the berserk Long Chen protecting her, Yu Qingxuan was stunned. That winged devil expert had yet to release his aura, but he was definitely a terrifying mid stage World King. For her, Long Chen was willing to risk his life against such an opponent. Hence, she looked at Long Chen foolishly. Even her fear of the winged devil expert vanished.

Black qi gushed out of Long Chen’s body, and hilling intent raged in his eyes. His face was twisted in a fierce and malevolent expression.

As for that devil expert, he still had a faint smile. Eventually, the black qi coming from Long Chen’s body slowly dissipated.

“You…”

Long Chen stared in shock at the winged devil expert.

That devil expert also pulled back his hand. He looked at Long Chen. “Just now, you were already bedeviled. When the thing that you want to protect the most is threatened, you transform into a devil. In truth, no matter how kind and good a person is, once their bottom line is touched, they will strike back with all their power, willing to pay any price. They won’t mind becoming a devil either.”

Only now did Long Chen realize that the devil expert was intentionally testing him. Furthermore, under the influence of the wine, he had activated his dark energy.

Curiously though, his heart-devil didn’t take this opportunity to invade and take control of his soul. Long Chen was startled.

Yu Qingxuan was staring at Long Chen blankly and didn’t say anything for a long time. This figure was deeply imprinted in her mind.

“Do you know? My devil race wasn’t originally evil. It was the same as your human race. The majority of the time, it was kind. But when the devil race produced one expert, after he became the devil race’s conviction, the devil race’s desires limitlessly grew and inflated. In the end, it devoured our intelligence, and all the devil race’s people became slaves to their desires. They lost their minds and their rationality. As a result, they could only act according to instinct, devouring other lifeforms to live. Do you know why my devil race became like this?” asked the winged devil.

Long Chen shook his head. He suddenly thought that this expert before him was extraordinary.

The devil expert indicated for him to sit down. He then poured more wine for Long Chen and said, “Because in the immemorial era, the devil race was the strongest, the leader of the ten thousand races. At that time, the devil race produced a supreme expert, the Devil Master. His appearance brought the devil race to unprecedented glory, but he also led the devil race down a path of no return. My winged devil race was originally the emperor race of the devil race, but now we’ve become walking corpses, becoming pawns used by others. I say all these things to you to impress upon you one point.”

“What is it?” asked Long Chen.

“If one day your human race becomes the overlord of the world, then the devil race’s path will become your future.”

Long Chen’s heart pounded wildly. After a long time, he nodded. “That truly is possible. Human desires are also limitless. When there are no enemies inhibiting us, when we lose our sense of respect, we become unbridled, willing to do anything. However, I want to know. Did the devil race sink to this level solely due to that person called the Devil Master?”

The devil expert shook his head. “This matter implicates too much, so it cannot be said. Today, junior brother can count as a kindred spirit. Neither of us is a good person, so I merely wish to give you a warning. As for the Devil Master, as long as junior brother does not fall, you will sooner or later understand what kind of existence he was. We have destiny tying us together, and while I have nothing else to give you, you can have this little bit of wine. Please don’t refuse.”

The devil expert gave Long Chen hundreds of jugs of wine. So, Long Chen hastily thanked him.

He and Yu Qingxuan then left. This time, Long Chen didn’t continue onward. He brought Yu Qingxuan away, out of the Wine God Palace.

Long Chen had just left the Wine God Palace. Deep within the Wine God Palace, there was a location that on the Martial Heaven Continent would have been the residence of the High Priest.

There was an elder here as well. He wore white robes, and his hair was also white. He looked to have become a transcendent immortal, untouched by the dust of the mortal world.

“High Priest.”

Just then, the winged devil expert appeared and bowed to this elder.

Surprisingly, this elder was also a High Priest. The High Priest then looked at the winged devil expert and asked, “How was it?”

“I’m ashamed. Long Chen’s heart-devil is too strong to be rattled. Forgive this disciple for his powerlessness,” said the devil expert.

The High Priest shook his head. “Even with your power, you are unable to shake his heart-devil. Then the others have no chance at all. When Long Chen entered the Wine God Palace, the Wine God’s statue sensed it. That proves that he is the one that the Wine God prophesied. Seeing him entangled by a heart-devil, I thought that this was the guidance of the Wine God and that I was to help him. But even you were powerless. It seems that I misinterpreted the Wine God’s will. Long Chen has left now. Who knows what kind of additional variables will join the equation?”

The devil expert said, “Disciple gave him wine that contains the laws of the devil world. It can help him control his heart-devil, inhibiting its growth. This way, the Ghost Sovereign mark will not be activated so soon. Furthermore, disciple even mentioned the Devil Master in hopes of disturbing the lines of fate. Hopefully, the Ghost Sovereign will not make his move on Long Chen so early.”

The High Priest nodded. “You did very well. Throwing karma into chaos will help him conceal himself. The Wine God has not passed down an imperial edict in so long, and the palace master has also been silent. For the person that the Wine God prophesied to appear now, it seems that something major is about to occur.”

The High Priest extended his hand. His fingers moved slightly as if he was counting or calculating something. But in the end, he didn’t dare to finish calculating it. He slowly lowered his hand. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

The moment that he put down his hand, his entire palm suddenly withered.

“High Priest!” The devil expert cried out.

“What powerful karma… Not even touching it is acceptable. If I truly tried to calculate it, I might have lost my life. It seems that the Heavenly Daos are about to completely change.” The High Priest looked at the empty air somewhat gravely.

…

Long Chen and Yu Qingxuan left the Wine God Palace. Seeing that Long Chen seemed to have suffered a blow, Yu Qingxuan took the initiative to talk to him, comforting him. When Long Chen became a devil and appeared in front of her, she wasn’t afraid. Her heart actually felt particularly warm.

Long Chen smiled. “I’m fine. Let them wait. Once my cultivation base soars, I’ll carry out a ‘massacre’ of the Wine God Palace. All their wines will be mine.”

Seeing that Long Chen had returned to normal, Yu Qingxuan relaxed. She suddenly thought of something.

“Long Chen, did you come to the Dragon Blaze Prefecture for the Heavenly Flame Spirits as well?”

“The Heavenly Flame Spirits?” Long Chen was startled.
