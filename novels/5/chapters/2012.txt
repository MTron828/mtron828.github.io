The Martial Heaven Continent had a long history and countless inheritances. It had given rise to countless experts in the past. In the immortal era, even gods had appeared.

The majority of experts liked to leave some of their inheritances behind for destined people to carry on their legacies. Some supreme experts left behind their astral spaces, turning them into minor worlds.

Those minor worlds were attached to the Martial Heaven Continent. As long as you could find the entrance, you could enter.

However, after so many years, many minor worlds were in ruins. Some had fractured and vanished.

Practically, every sect on the continent had its own inheritance land. Some seniors had left behind their astral spaces and they were kept in order by their descendants. They were precious legacies.

Other than those spaces with masters, there were some spaces without masters. Some of those spaces were too big, and as the Martial Heaven Continent moved, they clashed with its laws, resulting in their destruction.

Some of those spaces were able to resist that clash and ended up being drawn into cracks within the world. Some formed a strange resonance.

There were also some like the Yin Yang World and Devil Spirit Mountain. Most likely, a minor world had formed a resonance while in contact with both the Martial Heaven Continent and those foreign worlds. Those two minor worlds had been compressed by both worlds, resulting in them being crushed and forming spatial channels connecting the worlds. If it wasn’t for the Sovereign Blood Seal suppressing those channels, the devil race and the Blood race would have long since charged onto the continent.

There were layers of space throughout this world. Perhaps they weren’t visible, but they existed.

Some ancient sects looked like they had been destroyed, but recently, more and more mysterious sects were reappearing.

Some of those sects had been gone for so many years that people hadn’t even heard of them. However, when people looked through historical records, they found that they were terrifying sects that had been incredible existences thousands of years ago. Now that the great era was descending, they were coming out from their minor worlds to restore themselves to their former glory.

Geniuses were currently gathering at Pill Valley. They were there to enter the Brahma secret realm.

Long Chen sat atop a tall mountain, watching those geniuses flying over his head. It was unknown what he was thinking.

“Are you planning something evil again?” asked Evilmoon. It was truly starting to understand Long Chen.

“I have to think of a way to enter the Brahma secret realm. Do you have a method?” asked Long Chen.

“In theory, if you could accurately pinpoint the spatial node, with my current power, perhaps we can break through space and enter...”

“I’m talking about in reality,” interrupted Long Chen.

“Fine. In reality, there’s no chance you can find the spatial node. It’s Pill Valley’s top secret. Outsiders can’t possibly learn it,” said Evilmoon.

“So you can’t do it.”

“What do you mean, I can’t do it?” snorted Evilmoon angrily. “You’re the one who doesn’t even know the spatial node’s location. It’s like you’re asking me to kill someone but you don’t even know where they are.” Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

The so-called spatial node was where the minor world connected with the Martial Heaven Continent. As long as Evilmoon could reach that spot, it might be able to tear through space to enter it.

“If you don’t want to die, then get out of my way!”

Just at this moment, a coarse and tyrannical voice rang out from the distance. Long Chen turned to see a golden-horned bull pulling an ancient carriage through the sky.

That bull was actually a twelfth rank Magical Beast. Quite a few experts were flying through this region, and some of them came from the same sect. When they saw that bull, they hastily evaded it.

However, unexpectedly, the bull was too fast, and even though they avoided its body, they weren’t able to avoid the astral winds that roared off of it. They were blown back miserably.

Some of them even coughed up blood. That bull was advancing at full power. Its master was clearly doing this on purpose.

“Courting death!” Those experts were enraged, and they took out their weapons. Divine light lit up as they attacked the carriage, wanting to teach the person inside a lesson.

BOOM!

Ripples spread along the carriage. It actually had a powerful barrier that blocked their attacks.

“Courting death!”

A furious shout rang out from within, and the carriage came to a stop. A large man came out. He had bushy eyebrows, a beard, and a mustache. He smacked a rod that he had at those people.

A dragon’s cry actually rang out, causing Long Chen to jump. That fellow actually possessed a trace of dragon blood.

“This fellow’s dragon blood isn’t pure. You see that rune on his forehead? It should be the mark of the barbarian dragon race. The barbarian dragon race only possesses brute power but no divine abilities. They’re a group of brainless fellows,” explained Evilmoon.

BOOM!

The large man’s rod caused space to explode and sent those disciples tumbling back, coughing up blood. With just this one attack, even a dozen genius Life Star disciples were unable to endure.

None of them had used their full power, but that man also hadn’t summoned his manifestation.

“You... you’re the Barbarian Dragon Palace’s Man Batian!” someone cried out in shock.

“Since you know who I am, you can scram!” snorted Man Batian.

Man Batian? Long Chen felt like he had heard that name. He wracked his brain and suddenly slapped his leg. He remembered. Ye Lingshan had mentioned this person to him.

He had once pursued Qi Fengxue but was refused. Then he had pursued Ye Lingshan, but she had ignored him. Back then, he had sworn that when he awakened his barbarian blood manifestation, he would marry both of them. Countless people had sneered at him for that.

Later on, he had vanished. People all thought that it had been a farce, but recently, he had reappeared and defeated consecutive geniuses without suffering a single defeat.

Furthermore, his sect, the Barbarian Dragon Palace, also surfaced. When someone investigated their history, they were stunned. The Barbarian Dragon Palace had been famous many years ago. Its experts had the inheritance of the barbarian dragons. They were immensely powerful.

It was said that back when True Immortal Jiaoqi was alive, the two of them had clashed. No one knew the final result, but since the two of them were still alive, outsiders guessed that they might be equally matched.

Although Man Batian had only recently come out, his fame was growing rapidly. He was a tyrannical existence amongst the neutral powers. Other than that, due to his bloodline, he was very unreasonable and would kill people as soon as they displeased him. He was famous and infamous.

Those people were startled when they heard that name. A hint of fear appeared in their eyes. They cursed their bad luck at encountering such a garbage person.

“Either fight or fuck off!” snorted Man Batian, pointing his rod at those disciples. He spoke to them like they were ants.

“Man Batian, don’t go too far!” raged one disciple. A warrior could be killed but not humiliated. This person went too far. It was clearly his carriage that had smashed into them, and now he even shouted at them to scram.

“Die.” That disciple had just shouted when Man Batian turned toward him, smashing his rod. That rod compressed space, sealing the disciple’s movements. The disciple was shocked to find that he couldn’t move.

Just like that, the disciple exploded along with his weapon.

The others were startled and infuriated. This Man Batian was as unreasonable and tyrannical as the stories said.

“Since you don’t scram, you can die!”

Seeing those disciples panicking, Man Batian laughed. His bull’s two golden horns suddenly began to shine.

A wave of divine light shot out of the horns, striking the disciples like a mountain. Those disciples summoned their manifestations, but despite going all-out, they were heavily injured. Two of them had their bodies explode, and they fled with only their Yuan Spirits.

Those disciples instantly vanished from sight as they fled. Man Batian laughed as if bullying them had been delightful.

“Brother, help me out!”

Just at this moment, a hand clapped onto his shoulder.

Man Batian jumped in shock. He turned back, but before he could even see who was behind him, a hand slapped his face.

He seemed to hear the sounds of bones breaking and then lost consciousness.

Long Chen carried Man Batian to the carriage and then glanced at the bull indifferently. As soon as Long Chen looked at it, it stiffened, all its previous majestic air vanishing.

“If you don’t want to become steak, you’ll listen obediently,” said Long Chen. He dragged the unconscious Man Batian into the carriage. Upon entering, he saw that it was very luxurious. The floor was actually padded with the fur of a twelfth rank Magical Beast, and there were over ten female cultivators on a wooden bed, not an inch of thread on their bodies. They stared in shock at Long Chen.

“Senior apprentice-brother Long Chen!” One of those women recognized Long Chen. Then realizing that she wasn’t wearing anything, she blushed, covering herself up.

Long Chen hastily left the carriage, taking out a spatial ring and tossing it inside. He told them to put on clothes first.

Through their explanation, he learned that they came from various sects. They had been captured by Man Batian. When they had refused his advances, he had captured them in his anger. Fortunately, they had run into Long Chen before Man Batian could do anything further to them.

“Sorry.” Long Chen reached out and patted each woman on the back of their head. They instantly fell unconscious.

His Spiritual Strength entered their minds, erasing their memories of Man Batian and seeing him here. They were also geniuses who were going to attend the Brahma secret realm, so he had to do this.

After erasing their memories, he placed them in different locations. That way, they could act like nothing had happened.

As for Man Batian, Long Chen hadn’t been planning on killing him, but after seeing those women, he had directly done a soulsearch and learned just how many wicked things he had done. After that, Long Chen directly killed him.

He began to change his appearance, dressing himself up as Man Batian. After confirming that there were no mistakes, a blaze of flames turned Man Batian into ashes.

“Haha, if you don’t want to die, then get out of the way! I, Man Batian, am coming!”

Long Chen suddenly cleared his throat and laughed, sending the carriage flying straight toward Pill Valley.
