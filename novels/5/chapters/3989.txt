Chapter 3978 A New Direction

“What? Five hundred and thirty-seven dragon power? Are you sure that this information is accurate?” Yu Xiaoyun stared at his two empresses in shock.

“There is no mistake. Yu Xiaoyun, you are naturally gifted and even possess the Vermilion Bird Divine Radiance. I remember that where you were in the Immortal King realm, your secret record was only three hundred twenty-seven. Who would have thought that the seemingly scholarly Long Chen would actually possess such terrifying power?” said Xu Lanxin.

“There’s no way. Even if he has true dragon essence blood in his veins, his body is still that of a human. How can he possess such power?” Yu Xiaoyun couldn’t believe it.

Even as a child, Yu Xiaoyun had been exceptionally gifted and possessed shocking power. However, his power was a secret of the Vermilion Bird Empire. So, other than himself, only his empresses were aware of the full extent of his power.

Back then, the Vermilion Bird Divine Radiance appeared when Yu Xiaoyun was born, causing the Vermilion Bird’s runes to form on his body. Due to this, he was said to be the rebirth of the Vermilion Bird’s son.

Therefore, his physical body was terrifyingly powerful. But as the secret weapon of the Vermilion Bird Empire, his power was a secret to the people.

However, Long Chen’s power had even exceeded Yu Xiaoyun’s younger days, causing Yu Xiaoyun to not dare to believe it. He had never encountered someone whose power exceeded his in his lifetime.

Moreover, Long Chen had even surpassed him by a full one hundred and ten dragon power. It was unbelievable.

“The High Firmament Academy’s youngest dean throughout all of history, perhaps he is even stronger than we imagine! This child truly knows how to hide his power,” said Jiang Huixin with a smile. She felt very curious about Long Chen.

“Hmph, even if his power surpasses mine from back then, so what? Strength isn’t my greatest talent,” scoffed Yu Xiaoyun unhappily when he heard their praise toward Long Chen.

Seeing his angry expression, the two empresses exchanged a look and laughed.

…

“Five hundred and thirty-seven dragon power?!”

“Impossible!”

“That’s pure nonsense.”

“Princess Qianxue must be intentionally spreading a rumor about him. In the Immortal King realm, let alone a human, not even the dragon race would possess such power.”

The news that Long Chen had five hundred and thirty-seven dragon power was spreading like wildfire. As he had broken the record in the Immortal King realm, all the cultivators in the empire soon heard of it.

When they heard it, their first reaction was to think that it was a lie, that the result was definitely an equipment failure or formation malfunction.

As countless people sent runners to verify this report, Long Chen was already in Yu Qianxue’s mansion, accompanied by Zhu Yifeng. After all, the latter was now full of worship for Long Chen and refused to leave his side. He even left his own home and stayed at the princess mansion, acting like Long Chen’s aide.

This time, Yu Qianxue’s guards treated him with the utmost respect. No one even dared to display the slightest disrespect to him.

Thinking of the dragon expert’s Dragon Soul Body Forging Art, Long Chen directly went into seclusion.

“This cultivation technique is too general. The dragon senior must have used the principles from the start of its cultivation to create it. But as more details are added, it’s easier to make mistakes, leading people off the wrong path. The soul, spirit, will, mind, blood, qi, and bones—the first four are mental energies. Soul, spirit, and will are easy to understand, but what is this mind? If the spirit is the Yuan Spirit and the soul is Spiritual Strength, then wouldn’t the will and mind be one thing? Why are they split? Or is the will something different in the dragon race? The will is the will? And the mind is the will too? Is such an understanding right or wrong? If it is a technique of the dragon race, it must have the dragon race’s power as a foundation. I only have dragon blood, so I’ll have to start with it.”

After thinking of a general path, Long Chen entered his cultivation state.VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

When his golden dragon blood rumbled and ignited, golden flames enveloped his body. However, even as it burned, he didn’t sense anything.

But when he used this dragon blood as the ignition point to ignite his spiritual qi, he directly coughed up blood. His body almost exploded.

“Are you a pig?! How can you ignite all your spiritual qi at once?! Are you trying to get yourself killed?!” cursed the dragon expert.

“Oh. I was careless.”

Igniting the essence blood was very simple to Long Chen. Thus, he hadn’t particularly felt that igniting his spiritual qi would be anything difficult either. As a result, he had overlooked one crucial detail: this time, it wasn't a simple matter of igniting his spiritual qi alone. It involved utilizing the power of his dragon blood to ignite his spiritual qi, an act that nearly caused his entire body to explode in the process.

After his first failure, Long Chen split his spiritual qi into hundreds of portions, igniting one portion at a time.

As expected, it was much simpler this time. His dragon blood and spiritual qi were now burning at the same time, letting him see golden spots appear in his originally white spiritual qi. His spiritual qi was starting to be infected with the aura of the sacred dragon.

After finding this method, he progressed smoothly. In just an hour, all his spiritual qi was burning. He then removed the blockades and let this spiritual qi circulate throughout his body.

When his qi and blood merged, his aura changed. His body now had a sacred light around it.

“AH!”

Suddenly, Long Chen screamed. When he tried using this qi and blood flame to ignite the bones, an agonizing sensation surged through him. It felt as if countless scalding iron brands were raining upon his bones, searing them with relentless intensity, causing golden spots to appear on his white bones.

The golden spots, looking like dragon-shaped runes, gradually spread over his bones. As they branded themselves on the bones, golden energy flowed into the bones.

However, this process was extremely painful. Even with Long Chen’s pain tolerance, his face still twisted and veins throbbed on his forehead.

“There’s no need to be in such a rush. You can go one bone at a time,” advised the dragon expert.

“No need. It’s been a long time since I’ve felt such pain. Why not go all-out?!” Long Chen clenched his teeth.

BOOM!

Long Chen’s entire body shook as golden flames engulfed every single bone within his body. When millions of dragon-shaped runes branded themselves onto his bones, Long Chen let out a heaven-shaking roar, exposing the golden light that came even from his teeth.

“Are you trying to kill yourself?!”

The dragon expert was stunned. Let alone a human, even the heavenly geniuses of the dragon race would feel enough pain to want to die when forging their bones.

At this moment, Long Chen’s scarlet eyes almost popped out of their sockets, and his entire body convulsed with tremors, unable to withstand the overwhelming power surging through him. A primal, guttural roar emanated from deep within his throat, yet no intelligible words escaped his lips.

However, he didn’t give up. He directly used this explosive method to cover his entire skeleton with runes.

After an arduous two-hour ordeal, Long Chen's body finally ceased its incessant twitching. Beads of sweat drenched the ground beneath him, evidence of the immense exertion he had undergone. Moreover, his vibrant countenance now appeared pallid and drained, devoid of its usual vitality.

After resting a bit, Long Chen activated his inner sense and saw that all his bones had become golden with countless runes on them. They were like veins flowing through his bones.

“Hehe, I have a body of steel now.” Long Chen sensed the strength of his bones and couldn’t help crying out excitedly. He felt like his current bones, supported by these runes, were even stronger than World Domain divine items.

“I understand, I understand!” The dragon expert also cried out emotionally with a quivering voice.
