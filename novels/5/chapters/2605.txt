Chapter 2594 Autumn Water Divine Sword

The bag Mo Nian was holding was a cosmos bag. From it, he took out one large object after another.

“The crystal core of a thirteenth rank Magical Beast, the Scarlet Dragon Rhinoceros.”

“This crystal bone! Its rune contains a terrifying water energy. Is it from the Primordial Kun race?”

“This sword, it’s so sharp! This forging method has long since been lost. I want it!”

Seeing the various treasures, Qu Jianying was astonished. There were crystal cores, crystal bones, weapons, books, and all kinds of treasures of incalculable value.

“You can pick from these. Just leave me some so I can equip the disciples of Mo Gate,” said Mo Nian magnanimously.

“Long Chen, what are you looking at me like that for?” demanded Mo Nian. Long Chen’s smile, which was not a smile, made him feel a bit guilty.

“Don’t bring out these useless things. The alliance head has helped you out, and you bring out this broken sword for her? Aren’t you embarrassed?” said Long Chen disdainfully.

Qu Jianying was startled and then looked at Mo Nian. With no way around this, Mo Nian clapped his head and feigned sudden realization. “Aiya, that’s right, if you didn’t remind me, I would have forgotten. I specifically picked out a treasure for you, alliance head. I’m just too forgetful.”

Mo Nian then offered up an ancient sword with both hands to Qu Jianying. There was quite a bit of dust and rust on this sword, and it looked like it was breaking down.

Despite that, a sharp aura came from it, and even through its sheath, they could sense the murderous aura that condensed from it having killed countless powerful lifeforms.

After that, Qu Jianying carefully received the sword and looked at the old man. Only when the old man nodded did Qu Jianying finally begin to unsheathe it.

When just three inches of the blade was revealed, a sharp aura caused the palace that they were in to quiver, and black threads appeared around the blade. Those threads were the sword’s sharpness slicing the void.

Although they were both prepared, Qu Jianying and the old man still jumped in shock. This sword was absolutely terrifying.

“Autumn Water.”

The sword slowly calmed down, allowing them to see the words on it. After that, Qu Jianying and the old man let out a startled cry together.

“The Nine Yang Sword Sect’s founding ancestor, Li Qiushui’s, personally forged weapon, the Autumn Water Divine Sword!”

Mo Nian asked, “Is this sword very famous?”

Qu Jianying solemnly said, “Very much so. Senior Li Qiushui was a behemoth of the Sword Dao who once followed Sovereign Zi Yang. When the dark era fell upon that generation, Li Qiushui led her disciples to slaughter countless invaders. However, it is said that she and her disciples were trapped in an evil formation and perished. After hearing that news, without exception, all her disciples threw themselves into the battlefield.

“In the end, although the Martial Heaven Continent won, not a single member of the Nine Yang Sword Sect survived, and a vast legacy was lost just like that. Their actions shook the entire world, and afterward Sovereign Zi Yang led a three month memorial for the Nine Yang Sword Sect. It can be said that senior Qiushui is a model example for us, so seeing her sword is extremely moving.”

Qu Jianying then placed the Autumn Water Divine Sword at the top of the palace and kowtowed to it, followed by the old man. They were filled with reverence for this righteous and heroic senior.

The people in their generation grew up hearing stories of her. At this moment, Qu Jianying’s eyes were even red from emotion.

Seeing their reaction, Mo Nian didn’t quite know what to do. Should he kneel as well or not? However, when he saw Long Chen just standing there, he decided to just follow his act.

In the end, Qu Jianying didn’t scold them as their lives were just different. They didn’t know as much as her about the history and couldn’t fathom the feelings of the older generation.

“Long Chen, this Autumn Water Divine Sword is a priceless weapon. Although it can’t compare to the five supreme divine items, below those five, not many divine items can endure a single attack from it. You should give it to Yue Zifeng. Like that, this sword would land in the right hands.” After kowtowing, Qu Jianying reverently passed the Autumn Water Divine Sword to Long Chen.

Long Chen shook his head. “Zifeng does not rely on the sharpness of his sword to win. His path is different from other sword cultivators.”

Yue Zifeng had always declined when Long Chen offered to find him a powerful divine sword. He said that his destined sword had yet to appear. Perhaps his pursuit for that destined sword was part of his cultivation path.

That was why Yue Zifeng always used ordinary swords. In addition, sometimes swords would automatically leap into his hands, and only then would he replace his old one.

Because of this peculiarity, although this Autumn Water Divine Sword was a priceless treasure, Long Chen was sure that Yue Zifeng wouldn’t want it.

“Alright, then I’ll give it to Lingshan. She will carry out senior Qiushui’s will.” Qu Jianying respectfully put away the Autumn Water Divine Sword and then turned to Mo Nian. “Where did you find this Autumn Water Divine Sword?”

“It was in a pile of bones near the core of the city. There was one particular skeleton seated cross-legged with this sword resting on its knees. I didn’t know that it was senior Li Qiushui, but when I took the sword, her corpse turned to dust,” said Mo Nian awkwardly. He didn’t know if Qu Jianying would curse him for blaspheming a senior.

Qu Jianying nodded. She sighed. “Senior had her own spirit, and she entrusted her sword to you.”

“Was senior Li Quishui killed because of Resentful Death City?” asked the old man suddenly.

Qu Jianying’s expression changed. The stories said that Li Qiushui was surrounded by invaders and fell into one of their domains before vanishing. But Mo Nian had found her in Resentful Death City.

“There are definitely some secrets in Resentful Death City. Mo Nian only survived thanks to the remnant Sovereign seal. If we think about it, for a Sovereign to seal Resentful Death City, he must have had his reasons. If senior Qiushui was Sovereign Zi Yang’s follower and her corpse was found in Resentful Death City, it implies that she was trapped and died there. Then looking at it from another angle, doesn’t it mean that there was no Sovereign seal over Resentful Death City when she died? If that’s the case, then it’s clear who left the Sovereign seal,” said Long Chen.

“You mean it was left by Sovereign Zi Yang?” Qu Jianying and the old man were startled. This analysis didn’t have much to base itself on, but it was reasonable. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

“If we want proof, it’s simple. Mo Nian, take out a few hundred treasures. We can investigate what part of history they’re from,” said Long Chen.

Qu Jianying and the old man stared at Mo Nian in shock. After that, Mo Nian cursed Long Chen, “That’s easy for you to say! Where am I supposed to get a few hundred of them? Resentful Death City is filled with terrifying resentful spirits. Why don’t you steal a few hundred for us to take a look at?!”

“I certainly can’t do it. But you are a grandmaster archaeologist, a pioneer of excavating the lost culture of the Martial Heaven Continent. Come now, don’t be low-key. Show us your abilities!” Long Chen smiled wickedly. He truly understood Mo Nian.

“Count yourself vicious!”

Mo Nian glared at Long Chen and waved his hand. After that, a dozen weapons clattered to the ground, and the palace rumbled, with space twisting.

“Damn!” The old man gasped.

“The Formless Wheel, the Heavenly Spirit Parasol, the Ghost King Shield, the Heaven Piercing Hegemon Spear…” Qu Jianying examined the divine items one by one, her heart pounding. These were all famous existences in the Martial Heaven Continent’s history. They and their masters had left behind countless legends.

Besides, the owners of these weapons had all been experts in the same generation as Sovereign Zi Yang. They were famous existences that had stood at the apex of the continent at that time.

“This Heavenly Spirit Parasol is a treasure of the Nangong family. Back then, their family… Well, it’s not for me to say. You should return it to the Nangong family later.” Qu Jianying sighed when she saw the Heavenly Spirit Parasol.

“These experts were truly from the same generation as Sovereign Zi Yang. Then Long Chen’s theory that the Sovereign seal was left by him is likely. But if Sovereign Zi Yang sealed Resentful Death City, why is it that no one from the Martial Heaven Continent knew of it? Furthermore, the divine families were capable of entering Resentful Death City, but they didn’t say anything either.” The old man’s expression sank. He smelled a scheme.

“We’ve never viewed Resentful Death City as a powerful enemy, only treating it as the final trump card of the Corrupt path. It seems that we were wrong. Resentful Death City definitely poses a serious threat to the Martial Heaven Continent, or the Sovereign wouldn’t have sealed it. But it really is incomprehensible why the Sovereign didn’t leave any warning,” said Qu Jianying.

“Perhaps Daoist Heavenly Feather or the High Priest knows something? Maybe we should ask them?” suggested the old man.

Long Chen shook his head. “There’s no need. They know many things, but if they could say any, they wouldn’t conceal it. So asking them about things that they can’t say is meaningless. If the Sovereign didn’t mention it, then doesn’t that have huge implications? Even if the High Priest did know, he definitely wouldn’t dare to say it.

“The Martial Heaven Continent is like a riddle slowly being solved by our generation. The Corrupt path, the divine families, and even Pill Valley are acting mysteriously. They are scheming something, and only we are still blind. But I refuse to believe that the five Sovereigns were just going to let us be destroyed without leaving any clues. Now, the Martial Heaven Continent lies on the brink of destruction. Whether or not we win is something I feel like is up to Mo Nian.”

“Me? What the fuck, what are you looking at me for?” demanded Mo Nian.

“Hehe, it depends on whether or not you can take out some more divine items to equip our side,” chortled Long Chen.

“Bastard, there’s no more!” raged Mo Nian.
