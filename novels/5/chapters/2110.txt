Chapter 2100 Devil Ape Roars at the Firmament

The Heavenly Daos trembled as Zhao Wuji’s manifestation appeared behind him. There was a giant beast roaring within it. Looking at the giant beast closely, people found that it was a gigantic ape. Its fur was shining brightly, and a pillar of Blood Qi soared into the sky.

Heaven and earth trembled with that giant ape’s roar. It was like it wasn’t just an image, but a solid existence.

“Impossible! How could he have awakened this manifestation?!” The supreme geniuses watching were alarmed.

“Devil Ape Roars at the Firmament! That’s not a manifestation that someone like him should be able to awaken! There’s definitely something off!” Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

As the ape roared, Zhao Wuji’s own Blood Qi began to shake. The devil ape’s Blood Qi actually merged into his.

“Hahaha, Long Chen, I heard you’re not an Empyrean, so perhaps you don’t know this manifestation of mine!” Zhao Wuji laughed, his voice full of disdain.

Long Chen truly didn’t know this manifestation. He had never studied Heavenly Dao manifestations. He had no interest. In any case, it wasn’t as if he could awaken one.

“Since you’re about to be killed by me, I’ll explain it to you out of the goodness of my heart. Even amongst Empyreans, there are differences. The heavens will only allow one unique manifestation to awaken at one time. Every unique manifestation has its own name. As for my manifestation, it is a manifestation that only body cultivators can awaken. Its name is Devil Ape Roars at the Firmament. Do you see everyone’s shock? I’m not a body cultivator, and power isn’t my forte, and yet I’ve still awakened this manifestation.” Zhao Wuji was covered in his shining silver armor, with his manifestation trembling behind him. The sight was dreadful. “Long Chen, do you know the greatest difference between us? Or perhaps I should say the difference between you and all of us. It’s that you are just a country bumpkin who relied on a bit of luck to reach your current height. But so what? Do you even know what a powerful foundation is?”

“I don’t know what a foundation is, nor do I need to know.” Long Chen shook his head.

“You’re also not qualified to know. All you need to know is that someone like you isn’t fit to stand amongst us,” sneered Zhao Wuji. “You killed disciples of my Mechanism Sect. Today, I’ll kill you to announce to the world that my Mechanism Sect is forcibly rising!”

Zhao Wuji suddenly flew down at Long Chen. His sickle blades sliced through the air, leaving black tears in the sky. A terrifying aura filled the surroundings.

“The void is being torn apart!” Ye Lingshan couldn’t help being shocked. She hadn’t expected Zhao Wuji to be so powerful.

“Zhao Wuji’s Life-Ripping Armor is a priceless treasure. But even I have never heard that his armor has a second state. Furthermore, his manifestation was definitely awakened through special methods. His own power wasn’t very strong, but it’s multiplied by his armor. With this manifestation, his power has erupted to an unimaginable level. Furthermore, his armor is made of Heavenly Dao Spirit Silver, and his manifestation is essentially man-made. It can be said that he’s a cheating monster. Now we understand why no one wanted to provoke him,” sighed Beitang Rushuang.

Zhao Wuji as a person was trash, but he was still an existence that posed a threat to them. That threat had originally been assumed to be his insidious mechanisms, but the current Zhao Wuji had surpassed everyone’s expectations. Other than his mechanisms, he still had such a straightforward move.

Zhao Wuji was using a domineering and direct power to attack Long Chen. His blades slashed toward Long Chen, leaving long black marks in the air they passed.

“You’re going to forcibly rise? It’s a bit early for you to think like that,” snorted Long Chen.

Long Chen’s five-colored divine ring manifested behind him, and five stars appeared in his eyes. Evilmoon materialized in his hand as well, meeting Zhao Wuji’s dual blades.

BOOM!

Huge ripples spread through the air when they clashed. This was a horrifying exchange. Zhao Wuji’s immense power was actually unable to crush Long Chen. In fact, it didn’t seem like Long Chen required much effort to block him.

For a moment, everyone could only stare in disbelief. Just how was this possible? Now that Zhao Wuji had activated the second state of the Life-Ripping Armor, the Heavenly Dao Spirit Silver had gathered a crushing amount of Heavenly Dao energy. Anyone facing him would feel an absolute Heavenly Dao suppression.

“It’s that divine ring of his! It’s actually blocking the pressure of the Heavenly Daos! Just what kind of cultivation technique is that? Is it something that has surpassed the Heavenly Daos?!” Someone suddenly shouted, causing people to realize what was going on. As Long Chen’s five-colored divine ring spun, the crushing Heavenly Dao energy was broken up.

The Heavenly Dao energy was crashing down on Long Chen like a waterfall, but Long Chen’s divine ring was like a steady boulder. No matter how the Heavenly Dao energy crashed down upon it, it didn’t budge. The sight was shocking.

“So he did have some skill. No wonder he was able to talk tough.” Beitang Rushuang finally smiled. It seemed that Long Chen wasn’t as weak as she had expected.

In truth, Beitang Rushuang hadn’t been looking down on Long Chen at the start. After all, he was the one who had dominated his generation. But after meeting him, her impression of him had sharply dropped. She had come to the conclusion that he was a scoundrel with a glib tongue. There was no way he could stand amongst them, and so she had gradually forgotten that he was also a supreme expert.

Evilmoon was locked with Zhao Wuji’s blades. Long Chen clearly sensed the ripples of the Grand Dao that were being forced away by their power. He couldn’t feel the will of that Grand Dao, so it could be said that this move of Zhao Wuji’s was useless against him.

“I forgot, you aren’t even an Empyrean, and this Heavenly Dao energy isn’t enough to threaten you. Then I’ll show you another kind of power!”

Zhao Wuji’s manifestation suddenly shook, and the devil ape roared furiously. Blood chains condensed from its Blood Qi and connected to Zhao Wuji.

Zhao Wuji’s aura rose explosively. It was like he was possessed by the ape, and he let out a roar.

This roar did not sound like it came from a human. Suddenly, Long Chen felt Evilmoon sink as if a mountain was pressing down on it. He was forced back a step.

With that single step, a strange sound rang out from the void. It was like the void was about to be crushed by his single step.

He was forced back step by step, and every time, the world would shudder. With each step, a sound like a heavenly hammer striking the earth would ring out. Everyone could tell that Long Chen was currently enduring a terrifying power.

Clad in his armor, Zhao Wuji looked like a scaled monster. His face twisted into a sinister smile. “Don’t you claim to be very powerful? In the face of my manifestation, are you feeling despair? Do you realize the difference between us now?”

Long Chen was quickly pushed all the way down to the ground. When he touched the ground, it instantly cracked. Those cracks spread into the distance, shattering the nearby dirt mountains.

Long Chen’s expression was still calm. He coldly looked at Zhao Wuji. “You’re very arrogant. Are you so arrogant that you didn’t feel like hearing what my trump cards are?”

“You? You’re a country bumpkin with no background. Do you think you’re worth me paying attention to? Not just me, but none of the experts here care about your abilities. Do you think everyone is like you, forced to gather information on others? No, that’s just the display of a coward. We disdain doing such things,” sneered Zhao Wuji.

Ye Lingshan couldn’t help blushing slightly. It seemed that amongst everyone here, only she had done such a thing. Long Chen also hadn’t been interested in the other experts.

“Is that so? Good, very good. What did you say just now? Something about being very strong with your manifestation? Do you realize that you’re the true country bumpkin? You hid in that rat den of the Mechanism Sect for so long that you didn’t even realize how much the outside world has changed. This little bit of power can’t even count as power. I’ll let you see what true power is.” Long Chen suddenly smiled mockingly.

“Azure Dragon Battle Armor!”

Following Long Chen’s shout, his entire body became covered in white scales like a set of white armor.

A dragon cry could vaguely be heard resounding throughout heaven and earth. Long Chen’s blood began to circulate quicker, and a sound like rushing thunder rang out.

Heaven and earth shook uneasily. The ground beneath Long Chen shattered as invisible energy surged out of him, blowing apart the clouds.

When Long Chen summoned the Azure Dragon Battle Armor, the distant Huang Feiyan turned pale. The true dragon pressure coming out of Long Chen made her feel extremely unwell.

“Now do you know why I said what I said at the beginning?” said Kun Pengzi indifferently.

Huang Feiyan nodded. She had sensed that Long Chen possessed true dragon essence blood from the start, but she hadn’t expected it to be so terrifying once he activated it.

If she had really fought Long Chen, then the pressure of the true dragon would have completely suppressed her. There would have been no way she could win.

Huang Feiyan looked at Kun Pengzi with admiration. It seemed that he had long since seen through all of this. Thinking of how she had wanted to attack before Zhao Wuji, she blushed with shame. She was too immature compared to Kun Pengzi.

BOOM!

Evilmoon shook and Zhao Wuji was forced back.

Zhao Wuji slammed his blades into the air, leaving two long black cuts in the sky. Despite that, he flew back for ten miles before stabilizing.

He was shocked. He hadn’t expected Long Chen to possess such terrifying power. Even with the Life-Ripping Armor, he was forced back.

“That’s about enough. I’ve essentially memorized your techniques. All that’s left is to kill you.”

Long Chen’s gaze was cold, and his killing intent burst out once more. Suddenly, he vanished.
