Chapter 2658 Heaven Shattering God Extermination Arrow

It wasn’t just Mo Nian who couldn’t move. Even Beitang Rushuang and Nangong Zuiyue turned pale. They were also locked down just because they were standing close to him.

“It’s over. We’re definitely dead. That’s my Heaven Shattering God Extermination Arrow!” Mo Nian’s heart sank. That was his strongest technique, but it had also been copied by the Heavenly Daos. Now that nine clones of him had appeared at once, not even ten lives would be enough to survive this.

Mo Nian turned green. He had wanted to conserve his power in order to seem like a pig to eat a tiger. As a result, he really did end up like a pig. He was going to die to his own hands.

Ximen Tianxiong and the others’ clones had yet to attack, but Mo Nian’s clones had locked the experts down.

BOOM!

At this moment, nine Mo Nians nocked their bows like full moons. Just as Mo Nian and the others thought that they were dead, a sword shattered the void, striking the nine Mo Nians and blasting them into lightning.

Right away, the bindings on Mo Nian and the others vanished, and they saw Yun Tian within the lightning. He had killed all nine Mo Nians in one blow.

“Boss Yun Tian, you’re amazing! I, Mo Nian, am willing to revere you as boss for this lifetime!” Mo Nian cried out excitedly, almost crying from the emotion of taking back his life. If he died here, it would not be worth it.

“Brother Mo, your technique is amazing. Fortunately, I have a secret art to escape such locks, or we would have all died.” Yun Tian smiled at Mo Nian. He had only just spoken when nine Yun Tians surrounded and attacked him.

“Boss Yun Tian, don’t panic, I’ll help you!” Mo Nian grabbed the Heaven Seizing Sun Hunting Bow, and his aura instantly transformed. An arrow condensed on the string.

“I can handle it. Go help the others,” said Yun Tian, his expression still calm even with nine of his clones attacking him at once.

“Alright.” Mo Nian unleashed his arrow. Right now, Ximen Tianxiong was already surrounded by nine of himself and was injured in the first exchange. Since he had never encountered such a scenario, his heart sank.

Luckily, an arrow blasted through three of the Ximen Tianxiongs. Containing the laws of the Heavenly Daos, not only was the arrow incomparably sharp, but it was also able to curve through the air and slay three targets at once.

After that, Mo Nian began to unleash a rain of arrows, and the clones attacking Ximen Tianxiong were quickly killed. Ximen Tianxiong then shouted his thanks. Without this aid, he wouldn’t have lasted more than a few breaths’ time.

“Help the others,” responded Mo Nian. He continued attacking, helping Nangong Zuiyue and Beitang Rushuang.

“Help! Don’t let them activate the Heavenly Fate Dice!” shouted Hu Feng suddenly. Mo Nian jumped and hastily focused on Hu Feng’s side.

Hu Feng had a rare expression of fear. His Heavenly Fate Dice was quivering as it unleashed divine light that trapped his nine clones. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

Those nine clones were forming hand seals, seemingly in preparation for some kind of ultimate technique. Looking at this scene, Ximen Tianxiong rushed over, while Nangong Zuiyue and Beitang Rushuang also charged over, ignoring their own clones for now.

Hu Feng’s clones were killed one by one. However, when the final clone finished the hand seal, Hu Feng instantly turned pale.

Just at this moment, a zither twanged and a wave of light struck the clone, destroying it.

“Many thanks, Zither Fairy.” Hu Feng shouted into the distance. Zi Yan was standing far away from everyone. However, when she interfered, her heavenly tribulation rapidly drew her closer.

Originally, Zi Yan was undergoing her tribulation outside the core, but this interference was captured by the Heavenly Daos, and she was drawn in.

With Zi Yan’s assistance, the clones were quickly all killed. Just as everyone was thinking of going to help Yun Tian, they saw that he had killed his own nine clones.

“Hu Feng, what happened just now? You scared us,” said Mo Nian. Hu Feng’s appearance just now was like the ends of days had come.

Hu Feng said, “This heavenly tribulation is truly terrifying, but it’s also shameless. It copied my Gambling Heavenly Dao’s forbidden art, which is a suicidal technique that sacrifices your very life as a price to activate it. After that, it will summon a devil from another world that is limited by my cultivation base. Since I’m currently in the Heaven Merging state, it might summon an existence at the very peak of Heaven Merging.”

Hearing that, everyone felt a chill. Something at the very peak of Heaven Merging? If a ninth Heavenstage Heaven Merging expert appeared, they would probably all be killed.

Furthermore, it would have been nine of them. This technique of Hu Feng’s was truly heaven-defying. But the Heavenly Daos were also extremely shameless to start with this technique.

“My apologies for implicating the Zither Fairy,” said Hu Feng.

Zi Yan smiled. “It’s fine. Watching the fighting here is more comfortable than just watching from a distance.”

Suddenly, an explosive sound came from the core region. Someone was coughing up blood. It was Jiang Wuchen.

Jiang Wuchen had lasted an incense stick’s worth of time against his nine clones before being injured. The divine families’ experts were shaken.

“Wuchen, hold on! This kind of sure-death heavenly tribulation is based on time. As long as enough time passes, the tribulation will end. You have to survive the final wave…”

BANG!

The speaker was an elder from the divine families, but he wasn’t even done warning Jiang Wuchen before his body suddenly exploded. His interference with the heavenly tribulation had been sensed by the heavens.

Even a Heaven Merging expert was like an ant in front of this terrifying heavenly tribulation. They didn’t have the slightest ability to resist.

The elder was from the Jiang family. Having known that this would be the result and that he didn’t have many years left, he chose to sacrifice his life to warn Jiang Wuchen.

After hearing that elder’s warning, Jiang Wuchen stopped fighting his clones head-on. He chose to fight conservatively, buying time.

Ye Liangchen wasn’t much better off than Jiang Wuchen, but he was more prudent and had been fighting steadily the entire time.

On the other hand, Long Aotian appeared to have it easy. He was like a fish in water. This was his first time showing his power, stunning quite a few people.

However, the most shocking one was Feng Fei. She was only facing five clones. The other four were gone.

Feng Fei’s expression was odd. That was because those four clones had been destroyed silently without anyone managing to see who had done it. But she assumed that it was most likely Long Chen. Otherwise, the one to end up injured first would have been her.

At this moment, Long Chen was fighting intensely against his nine clones. However, his focus was on the heavenly gate.

“As expected, there’s still one more wave. Time’s running out, and Lei Long is still lacking a bit of food. I can’t waste any more time.”

BOOM!

Long Chen suddenly let out a punch that directly caused one of his clones to explode, causing everyone to jump in shock.
