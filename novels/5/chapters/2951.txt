Chapter 2940 Divine Flame Spirit Pool

The divine flame spirit pool was a place that countless outer sect disciples dreamed of going to. It was the best place to condense the divine flame seed.

It was rumored that the High Firmament Academy’s divine flame spirit pool was the envy of countless sects. Many heavenly geniuses came to this academy only for the divine flame spirit pool.

Reportedly, the divine flame spirit pool was connected to an underground dragon vein. It gathered the spiritual yuan of heaven and earth, using the purest, most primal source of energy in the world. It was the best thing to build a person’s foundation.

Condensing a divine flame was very important to every cultivator. The divine flame was the source from which a person’s potential was stimulated. It was where all a person’s energy was ignited.

In the Mortal Transcendence realm, people did their best to excavate their potential. But a person’s potential was as mysterious as the cosmos. Some people were as inconspicuous as random pebbles on the road before condensing the divine flame, but afterward, they might erupt with a different power.

In the Mortal Transcendence realm, a person was like a stone. Only when the divine flame was ignited would that stone split open, revealing what treasures were lying within.

However, without a good source of energy to ignite a person’s divine flame, a person’s potential would not be fully excavated. And if the potential wasn’t excavated, it might remain dormant forever.

If Mu Qingyun and the others hadn’t become elite disciples, they would have to buy spirit pills to ignite their divine flames. In this case, although they could still enter the Divine Flame realm, much of their potential would remain hidden to them. They would be fated to remain pebbles on the road for a lifetime.

On the other hand, elite disciples had the privilege of entering the divine flame spirit pool to ignite their divine flames.

Back then, Chu Kuang could have chosen to make his breakthrough during the battle. With his advantage as a Divine Flame expert, he wouldn’t have been defeated. Even if he was defeated, he wouldn’t have lost his life.

One reason he hadn’t was because he had never imagined that he would lose, while the other reason was that the divine flame spirit pool was something that could not be bought with money. Even with the Chu family’s power, they couldn’t have such a thing. That was why Chu Kuang had been waiting the entire time. If people still left behind spirits after they died, it was unknown whether or not Chu Kuang’s spirit would go crazy with rage.

He had won in the previous divine competition. However, the moment he defeated Mu Qingyun, he admitted defeat, giving up on that chance.

He had done this to target Mu Qingyun. Moreover, his cultivation base back then had yet to reach the point of breaking through to the Divine Flame realm, so he still had some time to kill. While he waited, he could also bring in another batch of powerful experts into the inner academy, strengthening the Chu Alliance.

Regretfully, this grand aspiration of his had been ended by Long Chen’s hands. As for Long Chen, he had now come to the divine flame spirit pool in order to enter the Divine Flame realm.

“Hello. The divine flame spirit pool is full right now. You need to wait in line. Looking at the number of people who have registered, it should be your turn around three days from now,” said the woman in charge of this matter.

“No way. I rushed over here so fast, and I still need to wait?” asked Long Chen.

The woman smiled. “You must have entered from the outer academy, right? You must not be aware that in the inner academy, hundreds of thousands of people enter this place through various examinations.”

“Hundreds of thousands?!” exclaimed Long Chen.

She explained, “It is possible to directly apply to become an inner academy disciple. However, it not only requires top tier talent, but the other thing is… well, you understand.”

Long Chen came to a sudden understanding. So directly applying for the inner academy required not just talent but also money; neither aspect could be lacking.

As for the outer academy, those disciples lacked both money and talent, so they could only enter through competitions like the divine competitions.

Long Chen smiled. In the past, he might have greatly detested this method, but after hearing that elder’s words, especially that part about there being no nameless grass of the earth, no useless people of the heavens, he understood many things that he hadn’t understood before.

Every person had their own use, their own meaning. It was up to you how to use it. The academy was not a charity. In order to exist in this cruel world, a person had to find their own meaning of existence in this world.

“Alright, then I’d like to make my reservation now. Thank you!” Long Chen received a tablet that said five hundred and ninety-eight, meaning that he was five hundred and ninety-eighth in line.

Just as she handed it to him, the number dropped by one, showing that someone had ignited their divine flame and their position was handed to the next.

The woman warned Long Chen to keep the tablet with him at all times. He had to pay attention to the number, or he might miss his spot. If he missed it, he would have to line up again.

Long Chen then nodded and left with the tablet. As soon as he left, someone within the crowd also vanished.

…

“Long Chen has registered for the divine flame spirit pool? Excellent. The chance has come. We’ll kill him there.”

Within a private room, Chu Huairen listened to that person’s report and smiled sinisterly.

“Uncle, didn’t we already discuss this? Long Chen is to be left to me.” There was another person within the room. It was Chu Kuang’s big brother, the head of the Chu Alliance, Chu Yang. He frowned.

Chu Kuang had been killed by Long Chen, infuriating the Chu family. After that, they sent out orders to kill Long Chen to win back their reputation.

This responsibility naturally fell into Chu Yang’s hands. To him, this was a great thing. Long Chen had killed Chu Kuang, and now he would kill Long Chen. When that happened, his reputation would instantly soar. It would be one of his important chips to fight for the family head position.

“Yang-er, this is not a game. I know you want to personally kill Long Chen for your own list of achievements, but Long Chen is not as simple as you imagine. Every time I see his gaze, I get a bad feeling. If we have the chance, we must kill him. We cannot leave him any chance. Don’t worry, no matter how he dies, the credit will go to you. A man would rather fight with wits, not power. Killing people without seeing blood is the most superior method,” said Chu Huairen.

After several interactions with Long Chen, for some reason, Chu Huairen felt more and more afraid of him. If Long Chen didn’t die, it would be difficult for him to find peace.

“Alright, then I’ll arrange things.” Chu Yang nodded helplessly.

“No, don’t interfere in this matter. I’m afraid of you not being completely clean. If that bastard catches you, it will be troublesome. I will personally arrange it so that not even gods or ghosts could tell,” said Chu Huairen.

“Then I’ll leave it to you,” said Chu Yang.

“Speaking of which, what about the Luo family?”

“The Luo family? They’re worthless. That idiot Luo Qingyang has actually become jealous of Long Chen due to Luo Bing and has rejected him. Moreover, he even infuriated Luo Bing. My subordinates tell me that Luo Bing has just applied to create her own guild. The Luo family was already weak here, but now that their power is scattered, they won’t be able to even bear a single blow from us,” said Chu Yang disdainfully.

“Good. Keep an eye on Long Chen’s movements. This time, I want him buried in the divine flame spirit pool.” A ruthless smile appeared on Chu Huairen’s old face.
