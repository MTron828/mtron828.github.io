Chapter 3504

The sound of the saber echoed through the air. Those people that had attacked Long Chen were now lying on the ground. They would lie there forever until someone moved them.

Six World Kings were instantly annihilated. Furthermore, Long Chen’s expression was still completely flat. It gave everyone chills.

That was especially true of those that had wanted to capture Long Chen and force him to spit out the complete Starry River of the Sky Art. Cold sweat covered their backs. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

Long Chen struck too quickly and ruthlessly. All of them had misjudged him based on his cultivation base and age.

When Long Chen’s gaze swept over them, their hair stood on end. They were so terrified that they involuntarily took a few steps back.

Looking at those World Kings, Long Chen sneered disdainfully. These fools were unable to even tell the difference between the strong and the weak. For them to have lived so long was truly a miracle.

Seeing that these World Kings weren’t moving and were fully shaken, Long Chen turned back toward those cultivators.

“All cultivators of the Starry River of the Sky Art, calm your hearts. Listen to my words. This is the key principle of the Starry River of the Sky Art. No matter what version of the Starry River of the Sky Art you cultivate, you will be able to follow these different paths to the same end. You will reach the other shore.”

“What?!”

Startled cries rang out from everyone. Long Chen was actually going to share the key principle of the Starry River of the Sky Art with them?

“Senior, you cannot! This Starry River of the Sky Art is a secret of the starry river line! How can it be shared with the public? If a bad person or other races were to learn it, wouldn’t it bring a calamity upon all life?” said one expert.

Quite a few experts’ expressions changed. Those experts weren’t humans. They were precisely lifeforms of other races, and that person’s words were clearly targeting them.

However, Long Chen was so powerful. Although they were enraged, they didn’t retort.

Long Chen shook his head. “The Grand Dao is formless and love is boundless. Good and evil are not differentiated by race. The human race has good and bad; the other races are the same. Do not take one part to be the whole. Are you going to stop eating for fear of choking?”

When he said this, those various lifeforms were all grateful. Those words made them feel very comfortable.

Long Chen continued, “Moreover, the Starry River of the Sky Art is a supreme Yang cultivation technique. Those who cultivate it must innately be straightforward people. The clash of Yin and Yang might not kill those schemers if they gave up quickly enough, but if they forced it, they would lose their life. Thus, the Starry River of the Sky Art is innately an honorable and above-board cultivation technique, and we should not restrict others from cultivating it. Instead, it should be spread far and wide so that the starry river line can spread its branches and leaves. Only by gaining disciples and growing healthy branches throughout the world can we live up to the sweat and blood of the Starry River Sage.”

Hearing that, everyone finally understood Long Chen’s intention. They couldn’t help admiring his magnanimity.

“I will begin reciting the true scripture. Everyone, memorize it with your hearts.”

Everyone instantly listened with rapt attention. They sat lotus style and clasped their hands together, looking reverent. Even the World Kings grew solemn and listened seriously.

“The Grand Dao is the epitome of utmost simplicity. It starts with one and ends with nine. The stars in the sky are endless. When the starry river flows, the Grand Dao connects. Search for one dot to start…” Long Chen began to recite the sutra. This was the true essence that he had comprehended from the starry river manifestation. He now shared it with everyone.

Perhaps it was fate. This Starry River Palace was created by another disciple of the Starry River Sage. Just like Li Xinghe, they all remembered their master fondly and inherited their master’s dao. They even abandoned their old names, calling themselves Xinghe, after the Starry River.

This disciple of the Starry River Sage was very intelligent and actually managed to preserve part of his inheritance. When someone managed to walk up the nine stone steps, the starry river manifestation would appear. Then the key principle of the Starry River of the Sky Art would appear.

When Long Chen obtained this principle, he also understood the thoughts of these two disciples of the Starry River Sage. They didn’t care about anything else. They only hoped for this cultivation technique to continue to be passed down, and they didn’t need anyone to remember them. It was enough for the people to remember their master, the Starry River Sage.

Long Chen felt great admiration for the starry river line. That was why he acted according to their will, spreading the Starry River of the Sky Art as far as possible.

The scripture had three parts. The first part was an overview, the second part was the principle of how to circulate the cultivation technique, and the third part was how to solve the most commonly encountered problems while cultivating it.

Long Chen recited for almost an hour before finishing with all three segments. After he was done, some sweat appeared on his forehead.

In order to deepen everyone’s impression of it, his voice was backed by his Spiritual Strength. As a result, these words were imprinted in their souls. They would never forget them in this lifetime.

“Many thanks for this kindness, senior! I will never forget this favor for the rest of my life!”

After hearing the complete scripture, those cultivators of the Starry River of the Sky Art all wept and kowtowed toward Long Chen.

Seeing this, Long Chen waved his hand, and a gentle force lifted them up. Long Chen smiled. “There’s no need to thank me. I was only lucky to obtain the complete Starry River of the Sky Art. If you truly want to thank someone, thank the Starry River Sage. It was this ancient almighty senior that created the Starry River of the Sky Art. However, he ultimately died due to endless Dao wounds. He used his own life to create the Starry River of the Sky Art. This is a senior worthy of respect. Of course, saying anything is just empty words. If you truly want to thank the Starry River Sage, then once you are strong enough, transmit the Starry River of the Sky Art as far and wide as possible. Find those with righteous hearts and transmit this cultivation technique that suits them.”

Hearing that, everyone kowtowed toward the statue of the Starry River Sage. Long Chen’s selflessness only caused them to feel greater reverence for him.

“Alright, then everyone, if you have any questions, please ask. I will do my best to answer all of them,” said Long Chen.

Hearing that, everyone went wild with delight. Someone hastily said, “Senior, forgive this disciple for his foolishness, but what does it mean in the scripture when it says, one star one matter, one star one me, one matter one me, astral energy courses?”

Countless cultivators instantly looked at Long Chen with anticipation. They also didn’t understand.

“The matter is the outside, the me is the inside. When you forget the matter and yourself, you will enter true stillness. Cultivators must not look at themselves; they must look in the distance. Use the heart as a mirror, the soul as water. Sometimes, the flower in the mirror and the moon in the water are not just reflections. This is what it means for the heavens to be one with the person. If the flower and moon do not exist, then where did the flower in the mirror come from? Where did the moon in the water come from?” said Long Chen.

“You mean…”

That disciple suddenly raised his head and looked at the heavens. An expression of wild delight appeared on his face. Long Chen simply smiled.

The others also came to understand. Long Chen’s words were filled with profundities, and yet they were simple to understand. These words directly entered their souls, making them feel as if the clouds had parted.

More questions came, and Long Chen answered every single one, no matter the question. His learning impressed even World Kings. They all made guesses as to what the origins of this mysterious black-robed youngster were.

After an hour of questions, all the doubts of the cultivators of the Starry River of the Sky Art had been answered. However, how many of them would actually comprehend the full things would depend on their talent and aptitude.

Long Chen suddenly stood and stretched lazily. He smiled at everyone.

“Everyone, let us meet again.

BOOM!

Suddenly, without any warning, Long Chen struck the void with his saber. The void shattered and four wretched World Kings came tumbling out.

“Third Heavenstage World Kings?!” Startled cries rang out.

One of those World Kings received Long Chen’s saber and coughed up blood.

The other three were just about to surround Long Chen when he transformed into a bolt of lightning that vanished from this world.

“You old dogs, just wait. Boss Long San will sooner or later take your dog lives.”

Long Chen had vanished, but his cold snort rang throughout the ruins. In the end, only four furious elders and a group of dumbfounded people were left in the ruins of the Starry River Palace.
