Chapter 3976 The Difference is Too Great

When Long Chen’s hand wrapped around one of those rods, Zhu Yifeng and Yu Qianxue held their breath in anticipation. Long Chen hadn’t focused his power. That attitude was like he was just picking up an egg.

The surrounding experts also paused to stare at him, but most of them had mocking sneers. They waited to see him embarrass himself.

This was a common sight here. Many people thought that they were powerful and overestimated themselves here. During their first time, most of them would embarrass themselves. Many of them would even cough up blood from misjudging the necessary power required.

After that, the rod quivered slightly, and Long Chen’s expression changed.

“Hahaha!” When they saw his expression change, those experts all laughed.

“He doesn’t know how high the heavens are!”

“There really are many ignorant people nowadays.”

“Hehe, only the ignorant are fearless…”

However, just as the mocking voices rang out, they came to a sudden stop. The disdainful expressions became one of confusion and then shock.

That terrifyingly heavy rod was easily picked up by Long Chen. Even Yu Qianxue was covering her mouth in shock, while Zhu Yifeng’s eyes almost popped out.

Moreover, Long Chen didn’t just pick up the rod. He rolled it around in his hand, which almost drove these experts crazy. They didn’t dare to believe their eyes.

“A single rod is this heavy? Not good.” Long Chen appraised the weight without a hint of joy on his face. He looked solemn.

The dragon expert’s voice rang out in Long Chen’s mind. “A so-called dragon power is only the most basic power of a matured dragon king. You know, a sacred dragon possesses ten thousand dragon power after becoming a dragon king. As for you… well, I won’t say it. Just remember, if you want to change your Seven Star Battle Armor, you’ll need at least three thousand dragon power. Only once your physical body reaches that power level can you endure the impact of changing the Seven Star Battle Armor. Of course, three thousand dragon power is only the lowest base. If you want to lower the risk, you should make your physical body as powerful as possible. Three thousand dragon power is only the minimum. If you cannot reach that level, you cannot try it, or you really will lose your life.”

“Ten thousand dragon power?”

Long Chen almost dropped the rod in his hand. A sacred dragon was actually such a terrifyingly powerful existence?

Hearts thundered in the room, but the rapid beats didn't belong to Long Chen; instead, they resonated within the chests of everyone else present.

“Big brother… big brother!”

Seeing Long Chen lost in thought as he weighed the rod in his hand, Zhu Yifeng finally called out to him.

Only then did Long Chen recover his wits. At this moment, he saw that everyone was completely dumbstruck.

Long Chen said, “It seems that I overestimated myself. This rod is one dragon power? I’m probably a far cry from the requirement.”

Long Chen looked at the rod and sighed. Its weight was truly a blow to him.

“Big brother… no, boss, is it really not difficult for you to hold it? Or is there a problem with the rod? Let me try it- aiya!”

BOOM!

The rod smashed into the ground. As a result, the earth cracked and the training grounds swayed. There was no issue with the rod.Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“Big brother, I asked to try it, not for you to throw it at me!” Zhu Yifeng was green with fright. Long Chen had casually tossed the rod to him, but he didn’t dare to catch it.

“Sorry, I didn’t do it on purpose.” Long Chen reached his hand into the ground and pulled out the rod, returning it to its original location.

Yu Qianxue had reached out to press a button that would activate a formation. With it, the rod would be automatically brought back to its original location.

It had to be known that such mistakes were common here. People often dropped these rods. Fortunately, the formation would automatically repair the ground and send the rods back.

It was because there was almost no way to pull these rods out of the ground due to the lack of grip. Hence, for Long Chen to forcibly pull it just like that was truly shocking.

People stared at Long Chen like he was a monster, and they were filled with shock and amazement. Their previous disdain had long since vanished.

After all, experts always received people’s reverence wherever they went. They surrounded him, staring at him reverently.

“Senior apprentice-brother, you’re so powerful! Why not challenge yourself and see what your limit is? We can help you find the weights,” suggested someone.

Long Chen was so powerful that a single dragon power was nothing to him. Hence, they were all interested to know his limit.

The next moment, Long Chen looked at the longest rod. It was only one foot above the ground and had to be lifted with brute power.

“Rise!” Long Chen grabbed it, and in front of countless shocked gazes, he lifted it from its spot.

“A hundred dragon power! Heavens, what am I seeing?!”

All the experts were fully dumbfounded now. They couldn’t believe what they were seeing.

“Double it!”

“Double it!”

“Add another hundred…!”

BOOM!

The training grounds shook as rods covered in dragon marks fell to the ground.

This time, Long Chen was covered in sweat and gasping for breath. He could no longer pull them out of the ground.

“Five hundred… thirty-seven dragon power…”

The experts present were stunned. Long Chen’s limit was five hundred and thirty-seven dragon power. It had to be known that in the Immortal King realm, the highest record in history was two hundred and eighty-seven dragon power. Furthermore, that was a record accomplished by someone at the peak of the Immortal King realm.

As for Long Chen, he was only in the initial Immortal King realm. However, he had broken the record and almost doubled it. Was he really human? No, even a beast race couldn’t possess such power, right?

Actually, the record of two hundred and eighty-seven dragon power was completed by an expert from a beast race. As for the record for a human expert, it was ninety-three.

Everyone stared at Long Chen who was staring at those rods gloomily. Five hundred and thirty-seven. That was a far cry from three thousand. Was he really so weak?

After he had absorbed the ancestral dragon essence blood, his power allowed him to look down on all others in the same realm. Even Kun Tu was defeated by him. Despite that, he remained far from meeting the minimum criteria set by the dragon expert, let alone matching the awe-inspiring prowess of a sacred dragon. It was truly a blow to him.

“Don’t be dejected. You aren’t from the dragon race, so it’s normal for my dragon blood to not raise your power that much. I actually thought that your foundation would put you at three hundred dragon power, but it seems that I underestimated you.” The dragon expert once more spoke to him. Surprisingly, there was a hint of gratification in its voice.

“Senior, are you just trying to comfort me?” Long Chen smiled bitterly. He felt like he had wasted this transcendent blood.

“My dragon race doesn’t know how to comfort the weak. Long Chen, since your foundation is so strong, I have a new idea. Do you wish to gamble?”

Upon hearing this, Long Chen’s heart pounded wildly. He smelled the hint of something good.
