Chapter 3740 Arrest Warrant

Long Chen’s escape caused the three Divine Venerates’ expressions to completely change. Their expressions were exceedingly ugly now.

The Ice Soul Divine Flame had been suppressed for millions and millions of years. The efforts of many generations of people, just as everything was about to pay off, ended in failure.

The three Divine Venerates then glared at Yin Changsheng. If it weren’t for his special status, they would definitely kill him right now.

If it weren’t for him, the three of them would have directly attacked, not giving Long Chen any chance to scheme like this. Then how would he escape?

“You idiot, fool!”

The Supreme geniuses cursed Yin Changsheng. Long Chen had actually fled from his grasp with the Ice Soul Divine Flame. Of over forty million disciples, only a few hundred survived. 

The deaths of those disciples were supposed to be paving the path for these Supreme experts. But the result? Those disciples died, and the benefits were all taken by Long Chen. They had all fought for their lives and gained nothing from it.

As for Yin Changsheng, he had shot out and engaged in a fight with Long Chen without any thought of working together. If they had joined forces, there was no way Long Chen could escape.

“If you don’t have the ability, then stop showing off. If you can’t beat someone, don’t act like big shit. Every single one of us was relying on the Ice Soul Divine Flame to temper our bodies and souls before advancing to the Immortal King realm, using it as a foundation for perfect advancement. Now, all because of you, the efforts of so many generations of people have been wasted. How do you still have the face to roar? Why don’t you just kill yourself to escape the shame?” sneered a Supreme expert. He pointed his sword at Yin Changsheng and cursed him furiously.

The Ice Soul had been sealed for millions and millions of years. Every time the three thousand worlds opened, the Sacred Pill Hall’s disciples within the nine heavens and ten lands, as well as the three thousand worlds, would rush over to absorb the Ice Soul’s energy.

Hundreds of thousands or even millions of years might pass before the next opportunity. Due to this, some Supreme geniuses even sealed themselves after they had reached the peak of the Divine Lord realm. They would wait millions of years just for the chance to absorb the Ice Soul’s energy. They also wanted to test their luck to see if one of them would be the lucky person to become the master of the Ice Soul.

This furious expert cursing Yin Changsheng in particular had sealed himself for many centuries. He had waited all of this time, and now his hopes were extinguished. How could he not be enraged?

“I’ll give you a chance. Let’s have a fair fight and let the heavens decide life and death.” The sword-wielding man’s killing intent soared as he looked at Yin Changsheng.

“Die!”Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

Yin Changsheng was already fuming at having Long Chen escape along with the Ice Soul. Now that he had to endure everyone’s blame, he lost control.

That sword-wielding expert directly exploded; blood mist filled the air. After that, a humanoid clump of flames appeared within the blood mist. That was his Yuan Spirit.

Seeing this, Yin Changsheng waved his hand, and the Yuan Spirit was dragged into his hand. It was like a chicken. This powerful Supreme genius actually didn’t have the slightest ability to resist Yin Changsheng.

This sight horrified the others. They saw that person’s Yuan Spirit struggling crazily, but he was unable to escape Yin Changsheng’s hand.

“My master is the master of the Sacred Pill Hall, Yin Tiande. He is your god. As for me, I am the future hall master. My master has already passed down his mantle to me. Who do you think you are to dare be disrespectful to me?!”

Yin Changsheng squeezed, and that person’s Yuan Spirit exploded. A Supreme expert was slain just like that. The others stared at Yin Changsheng in terror. These disciples now understood why the three Divine Venerates only watched with ugly expressions despite Yin Changsheng having caused such a disaster. 

The disciples of gods all had faith in their gods. They were Yin Tiande’s followers, and their faith energy was a bridge to him. Not a single one of them could be the slightest bit disobedient to him.

As Yin Tiande’s disciple, Yin Changsheng could control his faith energy. That was essentially controlling their lives. It didn’t matter how strong they were. They were controlled by his faith energy. If they attacked Yin Changsheng, they would simply die.

Because Long Chen and Yin Changsheng had spoken underground before, they hadn’t heard about Yin Changsheng’s special identity. Now, although they were still enraged, they no longer dared to express it.

After killing that disciple and shocking everyone, Yin Changsheng actually grew increasingly angry.

Originally, the Ice Soul trial was his chance to show off. He concealed his identity and came here alone because his master had arranged things for him. He wanted his disciple to stand out in this trial and make everyone else submit to him. That would make it even easier for him to gain their faith energy.

The plan was for Yin Changsheng to lead everyone to the Ice Soul. He would then gradually show his power and leadership ability.

After all, there was no way to subdue the Ice Soul. It would rather die than submit, so no one could obtain its approval.

But the slain disciples would provide Yin Changsheng with immense faith energy. Yin Tiande had also transmitted to him how to control this faith energy and obtain the Ice Soul.

However, who would have thought that Long Chen would appear here and ruin everything? Yin Changsheng had no chance to even utilize the technique to subdue the Ice Soul before the Ice Soul ran into Long Chen’s primal chaos space.

Other than subduing the Ice Soul with faith energy, Yin Changsheng didn’t know how to control this faith energy. All he could do was pour it into his spear to fight Long Chen. He had no idea how else to use it.

He was like a beggar who had no idea how to use the mountain of gold he had. All of that power and no way to use it. He could only watch as Long Chen escaped.

“Transmit my orders! All people of the Sacred Pill Hall are to do their best to arrest Long Chen! I will definitely tear his corpse into ten thousand pieces!” declared Yin Changsheng coldly.

“Yes!”

The three Divine Venerates could only nod. The white-haired elder hesitantly said, “Master Changsheng, looking for Long Chen now is no different than searching the ocean for a needle. Leave looking for him to us. You should adjust your condition and prepare to become Immortal Kings with the others. Since the Ice Soul is gone, we can only use a backup. All the grand formations can be activated to quickly create another Heavenly Flame World.”

Considering how large the three thousand worlds were, and that Long Chen had escaped with a spatial talisman, chasing after him would be far too difficult.

If they delayed their breakthroughs to Immortal Kings due to wasting time looking for Long Chen, then it would be a calamity if they were still stuck as Divine Lords when Long Chen came for them as an Immortal King.

“Then I’ll leave it up to you.” Yin Changsheng suppressed his anger and nodded. This was all that he could do.

From over forty million disciples and hundreds of thousands of elders, they were reduced to only these three elders and a few hundred disciples.

The giant flame pillars were gone and so was the flame barrier. Moreover, the skyscraping glacier had collapsed next to a ruined land with a giant hole in the ground. From the sky, it seemed to contain a mocking expression to it, as if it were laughing at something.
