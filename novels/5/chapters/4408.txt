Chapter 4397 Feather Race Three Saints

“Did he just beat an Eternal expert in one move?

Every expert present, whether they were from the human race or not, was bewildered. After all, that was a genuine Eternal expert, yet he couldn’t even withstand a single attack from Long Chen. When they looked at Long Chen, they were filled with shock.

While they were astonished, in reality, Long Chen was equally taken aback. He could sense just how weak this person was. At first, he had even thought this expert was intentionally pretending to be the pig to eat the tiger.

It was only when Long Chen launched his attack that he realized this person wasn't acting like a pig; he truly was a pig.

While the aura of an Eternal expert lingered in the air, it was superficial and unable to solidify. According to Long Chen's assessment, this person had reached the Eternal realm using some special trick and not his inherent abilities.

Despite being an Eternal expert, in terms of true combat strength, he would perhaps be on the same level as the Great Desolate World and the humanless world’s half-step Eternals. In fact, some of those half-step Eternals could be slightly stronger than him.

This person was nothing more than a paper tiger, looking frightening but was exposed the moment he fought. It was no wonder he kept on releasing his aura to intimidate Long Chen.

If it were someone else, they would have been deceived. However, Long Chen remained unaffected. Even a bona fide Eternal expert was nothing in his eyes.

“Don’t… don’t kill me! The Feather race won’t let you off if you kill me! My race has three Saints and tens of thousands of Eternal experts…”

With the spear in his chest, that Eternal expert begged for mercy. Then, sensing the power in the spear remained contained rather than erupting, he felt a trace of hope.

“Tens of thousands? If they’re as fake as you, what can they do?” sneered Long Chen disdainfully.

“No, no, they’re different! My talent was limited, and I was unable to reach Eternity, so I asked a Saint to forcibly elevate my realm. That’s why I have the aura of an Eternal but not their power. The others are different! They are true Eternals! Every single one of them is a hundred times stronger than me! We still haven't reached the point of no return; as long as you let me off, we can settle this here. My Feather race will no longer trouble you, and we can all be friends,” pleaded the Eternal expert.

The more he spoke, the more confidence he gained. His terror gradually faded, replaced by a calm demeanor, as if everything was under control.

Listening to his explanation, people started to comprehend how Long Chen was able to effortlessly defeat an Eternal expert. It appeared that this particular Eternal expert was a fake one.

“Be friends? Do you think that your Feather race is worthy? Tell me, are there other experts coming?” asked Long Chen.

“Yes, there are many!” the Eternal expert responded without thinking.

“Good. Then you are useless.”

The spear quivered.

“No-!” The Eternal expert let out a terrified cry.

BOOM!

He exploded.

The Eternal expert had never imagined that this one response would lead to him losing his life.

The meaning of Long Chen’s question was that if no one else was coming, he would have to release him so he was able to call over more people.

However, that Eternal expert said that they were already on their way. Thus, he had no use for Long Chen.

An Eternal expert was slain. While everyone now knew that he was basically a fake, seeing him dead was still shocking.

Furthermore, when Long Chen’s spear quivered, it unleashed a qi wave that blew back his hair, causing his pigtails to come undone. His hair then fell naturally.

“He…!”

Seeing him with his hair free, numerous experts cried out in shock.

“He is…!”

“The High Firmament Academy’s Dean Long Chen!”

“Heavens, he’s back!”

“No wonder he’s so powerful! So he's the youngest dean in the academy’s history!”

Countless experts cried out in shock upon recognizing Long Chen. Previously, Long Chen’s mass of pigtails had left people feeling like he was not likely to be human. After all, that hairstyle wasn’t common among humans. Hence, while some people felt like he looked a bit familiar, they didn’t recognize him.

However, with his hair now free, someone instantly shouted his name. It had to be known that when Long Chen left the Darklight Heaven, his name had become widely known, reaching the point where almost everyone was familiar with it.

Once he left, the other heavenly geniuses gradually took his place, causing people to forget about him. After all, the nine heavens were enormous. There were people who rose like shooting stars, but there were also people who fell like meteorites.

The instant someone recognized Long Chen, all the human race’s experts grew emotional.

“Huo Linger, do you remember everyone who stopped the humans from leaving just now?” asked Long Chen.

Flames then quivered beside Long Chen, and Huo Linger’s figure appeared with a faint smile.

“I’ve locked onto every one of them.”

“You know what to do then,” Long Chen replied with a smile.

Huo Linger nodded and started to form hand seals. Both inside and outside the city, countless experts’ expressions changed as they realized Long Chen was settling the score with them.

Countless experts fled in every direction.

“AH!”Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

Just as they moved, flames enveloped them, and miserable screams rang out. However, no matter how they struggled, it was useless.

Even Triple Supremes only lasted a few extra seconds before being incinerated.

Some people resorted to kneeling and begging for mercy, but Long Chen’s face remained icy. He didn’t even look at them.

“You stopped others from running for their lives, and you were quite arrogant then. By blocking other people’s paths, you’ve blocked your own. After all, your lives are not greater than anyone else’s. If you could laugh as you watched others die in pain, you should be able to laugh when facing your own death.”

Long Chen’s voice echoed through this space, icy and without the slightest hint of pity. He never felt the slightest pity when killing people who had taken advantage and slaughtered the human race.

Tens of thousands of experts had made a move to block the human experts from running just before. Fortunately, Huo Linger had remembered them all and locked onto their positions. Not a single one was wrongly accused, and they were all burned to death.

When the world returned to calm, the screams of those lifeforms still echoed in people’s ears. As a result, some of them quivered in terror, their faces pale as paper.

Vicious, absolutely vicious. Long Chen was a truly vicious character. They had never witnessed such brutality from a human expert before.

After killing those people, Long Chen simply stood in the air. He then waited two hours before finally cursing, “That old bastard tricked me! No one’s coming! What a waste of time.”

Long Chen walked over to Little Crane’s side and grabbed her hand. Bally hastily followed behind them. After entering the transportation formation, the three of them vanished just like that.
