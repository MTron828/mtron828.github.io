Chapter 4225: Warm-Up

Cloud suddenly noticed that the experts she had just eliminated had somehow reappeared. Their numbers hadn’t diminished at all.

“Don’t be surprised. The Undying race has a powerful life force and almost no fatal weak points. As long as their life energy is not exhausted, they have undying bodies,” explained Chu Yao. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

This was the most terrifying part of the Undying race: their tough life force. Furthermore, their self-recovery abilities were also astonishing. So, killing them would require exhausting all of their life energy first.

The problem was that they also had vast stores of life energy. Adding to their monstrous recovery ability, this was precisely why they were called the Undying race.

Within the same realm, not even ten people might be able to beat an Undying expert. Furthermore, even a hundred experts in the same realm might not be able to kill one, because if they couldn’t win, they would easily flee. Killing an expert of the Undying race was as difficult as ascending the heavens.

This was why only a few people in the world were willing to provoke the Undying race. They were simply too difficult to deal with.

Cloud had the utmost confidence in her divine ability. Seeing those experts be blasted apart, she had thought that they were dead. But they still lived and didn’t even seem injured. She was completely shocked by this spectacle.

“Our Undying race’s forte is always a battle of attrition, not brute power. In truth, our battles aren’t as dangerous as battles within your human race, where life and death are decided in an instant. For us, if we see the situation turn against us, well, you will see it a bit. These people might look mighty now, but soon you’ll see what stray dogs look like,” added Liu Ruyan.

The Undying race’s powerful life force inevitably turned normal battles into battles of attrition. These battles weren’t that dangerous, as they could always retreat if they couldn’t win.

As a result, although Cloud had broken through their blockade and displayed shocking power, they still weren’t afraid of her. Their powerful life force was enough to exhaust all other races that weren’t part of the Undying race.

“It’s because of this that we cannot let Long Chen fight them. This kind of battle would exhaust his energy. This Sage King Convention is particularly dangerous, with the air of traps and danger all around. We have to be prepared for the worst-case scenario and keep our trump cards for the end,” said Meng Qi.

They all nodded. The Sage King Convention this time was absolutely bizarre; no one knew what would happen. Conserving Long Chen’s power was their safest option.

“Sorry. I didn’t think of that,” Liu Ruyan apologized.

Meng Qi smiled slightly. “We’re all sisters. There’s no need to talk like that. You stood up for Long Chen, so Long Chen naturally wouldn’t just watch as you were bullied. The end results would be the same.”

Liu Ruyan had requested aid from Long Chen to test him. However, it seemed that she had been thinking too naively. Nevertheless, expecting her to apologize, especially now that she held the position of the young king of the Undying Willow race, was difficult.

To their surprise, she still apologized despite her new status, but Meng Qi had no intention of rebuking her anyway. Whether or not Liu Ruyan had asked for aid, Long Chen would still have helped, so there was no need to apologize. Meng Qi was always looking after everyone.

Suddenly, the void exploded and the giant passageway piercing into the heavens crumbled.

Originally, the dark creatures had only been capable of pouring out of that passageway. But now, it was like the dam was?overflowing, and the dark creatures flowed in even larger numbers.

Endless dark creatures flooded out in every direction, their roars shaking the void.

“Did that smell stop working?”

When they saw these dark creatures no longer purely attacking the devil race, Guo Ran was disappointed. They were attacking all sides once again.

“Its effective period has probably passed. Well, the odor can’t hang around forever. After a certain time, it dissipates,” said Xia Chen.

“Prepare for battle!” announced Guo Ran.

The dark creatures were now attacking indiscriminately, which interrupted those lifeforms that were thinking of attacking Long Chen, including the Undying race. They all retreated to their own camps.

Now, there were just too many dark creatures around. They were endless, and the sight of so many of them gave people chills.

There was now a veritable tsunami of dark creatures crashing down on everyone. Due to their numbers and density, some of them crushed each other, while some were even directly killed as they charged out.

The experts outside the martial stage watched nervously as those terrifying dark creatures drowned out their disciples.

Bai Shishi’s and Bai Xiaole’s mother were standing anxiously. After all, their children were inside, so as mothers, it was impossible for them not to be nervous.

The same sentiment held true for members of the other races. Initially, they had dispatched an astonishing number of experts, totaling over ten billion. However, they were like a drop in the ocean compared to the overwhelming horde of dark creatures. The disparity in numbers was too immense.

As a result, the people outside were undoubtedly nervous, but the ones within were even more anxious. In particular, those weaklings who had climbed up the stairs with Long Chen were trembling in fear.

Even the brave experts who had come to support Long Chen couldn’t help but feel fear when they looked at the dark creatures. Cold sweat formed on their palms, and their foreheads became moist.

However, when they looked at the Dragonblood warriors, they saw that the latter were completely calm, without even a trace of fear or nervousness.

Furthermore, this trait was not unique to just one or two of them; it applied to all of them. As long as these people were not idiots, they had to be true experts. This kind of expression couldn’t be faked.

Just then, the flood of dark creatures reached them, obscuring their view with nothing but twisted faces, pointed teeth, and sharp claws.

“Brothers, time to get up. The warm-up is starting. After the warm-up should be the real battle.”

Long Chen smiled and slowly reached back for the Minghong Saber.

As the Minghong Saber flew out, a saber-image swept through the wave of darkness. It was as if the world itself was being cleaved apart, leaving a long fissure in its wake. Any dark creatures caught in this rift were effortlessly sliced in two.

When Long Chen attacked, he didn’t notice that the golden lotus seed in the primal chaos space suddenly lit up, radiating an unprecedented divine radiance.

Following Long Chen’s opening attack, Gu Yang, Li Qi, Song Mingyuan, Yue Zifeng, and all the other Dragonblood warriors also made their move.
