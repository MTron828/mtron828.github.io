Chapter 3694 Once More Seeing the Nine Underworld Luocha

“Enpuda, you gossiping damn fatty, why don’t you just kill yourself!?”

Liao Bencang appeared along with a group of black-robed assassins wearing metal masks. There were thousands of them, which was ten times more than Enpuda’s group.

Liao Bencang flew over, but upon seeing Long Chen’s group of three, flames of rage exploded out of his eyes. His faith lotus then appeared behind him, and he immediately sent a palm toward the three of them.

“Little brats, die!”

Liao Bencang unleashed a giant palm-image that crashed down toward the three of them. The abundant faith energy seemed to cause the very cosmos to collapse. People couldn’t even breathe in front of it. As a result, they were all horrified. They didn’t even have a second to react to Liao Bencang’s arrival before he attacked.

Suddenly, a single finger pointed out and a gust of wind flew out from the flying boat behind Long Chen. That heaven-encompassing palm was shattered by the gust from this single finger.

“What?!”

Everyone was shocked. Liao Bencang’s fame was on the same level as Enpuda’s. They were amongst this world’s most terrifying assassins. But someone destroyed one of their attacks with a single finger? Just who was this person?

Liao Bencang’s expression changed. Only then did a certain person appear and a ruler qi radiated from him. When people saw him, they couldn’t believe their eyes.

“The Grand Xia’s monarch, Xia Guhong!”

This name was repeated by quivering voices. Xia Guhong was the symbol of an entire era. He was that era’s king. At that time, he reigned supreme.

The ancient Grand Xia’s monarch, the heir to the innate primal chaos divine item, the Grand Xia Dragon Sparrow. Considering his natural ruler qi, this could not be anyone else. He was a legendary existence within the nine heavens and ten lands.

Although the Grand Xia had long since vanished, people would never be able to forget the final generation monarch. This outstanding figure that had shaken the entire era ultimately had a sad ending due to love.ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

But no matter what, in that era, he was an unrivaled king that no one could compare to.

He soared like a shooting star, lighting up the entire world. After that, he suddenly vanished, but that glory already lit up an entire era. Even now, people had not forgotten him. Thus, when he appeared along with his ruler qi, many people instantly recognized him.

Furthermore, the fact that he was able to shatter the attack from the master of the Nine Underworld Hall with the gust of a single finger filled them all with amazement. This was the style of a legendary figure.

“As expected of the Grand Xia’s monarch, the Grand Xia Dragon Sparrow’s aura has always remained on you and has yet to dissipate. That also means that the Grand Xia Dragon Sparrow has yet to fall. Perhaps this is a fortune for our human race.” Enpuda bowed slightly to Xia Guhong.

Even Enpuda, a figure whose name shook the world, bowed to Xia Guhong. He didn’t dare to be rude.

Liao Bencang instantly went from a raging tiger to a quiet cat. In front of Xia Guhong’s ruler qi, he felt second-rate. Despite being enraged, he didn’t dare to attack again.

Xia Guhong eyed Enpuda. “The human race’s fortune has nothing to do with the Grand Xia Dragon Sparrow. The harvest that you sow is the harvest that you reap. Today, I came with these three brothers of mine to the Violet Flame Heaven Capital. I naturally won’t interfere in battles against the same realm, but if someone is so shameless as to take advantage of their cultivation base to attack my brothers, then I, Xia Guhong, will be forced to move these rusty old bones of mine.”

Countless people stared at Xia Guhong in shock, and some of the senior experts even had worshipful gazes when looking at him. Immediately, Xia Chen and Guo Ran’s hearts swelled with pride.

For Xia Guhong to call them brothers made them feel like they had directly ascended to the heavens. That feeling of pride could not be described with words. Guo Ran was so excited that he didn’t even know how to express himself.

“Even if your body has gotten rusty, I’m sure a few skinny monkeys can’t take advantage of you. They would only be inviting their own humiliation if they attacked you.” Enpuda smiled slightly.

“Enpuda, go fuck yourself! All that crap in your stomach is what makes you so damn fat! Are you trying to provoke me?!” raged Liao Bencang.

This curse caused countless people to look at each other in dismay. This was the master of the Nine Underworld Hall? The existence whose name shook the world? Could an assassin really possess such a temper?

Although Liao Bencang had an explosive temper, he wasn’t so foolish as to not realize that Enpuda’s words were clearly targeting him.

He was nothing more than an avatar and wasn’t a match for Xia Guhong. If they were to fight, he really would be inviting his own humiliation.

Clearly, Enpuda had long since known that Xia Guhong was inside the flying boat, but he didn’t warn Liao Bencang, letting him lose face. The more Liao Bencang thought about it, the more enraged he was.

Suddenly, Liao Bencang’s sword came out of his sheath. In front of countless disbelieving gazes, he actually attacked Enpuda.

However, Enpuda seemed to be prepared and easily moved aside, also bringing his people away. It was like he was saying that Liao Bencang was a rabid dog, and he couldn’t be bothered by him.

“Your Nine Underworld Island was already destroyed by Long Chen. Even after mobilizing all of that faith energy, you still let three juniors escape from your grasp. You then have the face to cast your anger on others? You’ve lost the face of your entire family. If I was you, I wouldn’t even need Lord Brahma’s denouncement. I’d have directly killed myself.” While Enpuda didn’t attack, his mouth didn’t slack off.

Last time, they had crossed heavens just to attack Long Chen. That had been a joint operation, and the failure infuriated both of them. Now, the two of them already tore off any pleasantries. After all, Enpuda wasn’t some saint. If he didn’t insult Liao Bencang a bit at this time, how would he make it up to himself?

“Wuming, remember, an assassin must always retain their calm. Don’t learn from palace master Liao,” reminded Enpuda.

“In truth, I don’t need master’s reminder. After all, a marvel like palace master Liao is unprecedented. Even if disciple wished to learn from him, disciple couldn’t possibly obtain this skill.” Ji Wuming shook his head.

This master and disciple actually played off of each other, cursing without using curse words, leaving Liao Bencang with no room to retaliate. As a result, he was fuming.

“Shut your mouth, or I’ll eliminate you within the three thousand worlds. The Divine Venerate forbids us from killing each other, so don’t force me to break his rules.”

A woman standing beside Liao Bencang spoke and her voice caused everyone to jump. It was a bizarre sound, not at all like a human’s. Coming from her mouth, that voice caused people to quiver. Every word seemed to possess the power to reap souls, terrifying people.

“Who is that?” Guo Ran whispered to Long Chen.

“I am the Nine Underworld Luocha. Remember my name, because the master of this name will kill all of you.”

The Nine Underworld Luocha stared at Long Chen, her gaze containing a sharp and cold light. Her mouth curled into a dangerous arc.
