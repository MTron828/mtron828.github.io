Chapter 3966 Making the Princess Faint From Rage

“What explanation do you want from me?” asked Long Chen after gulping down his food and wiping his mouth.

“You have just arrived in my mansion, and you already caused me to spend three days in solitary confinement. Why don’t you tell me what explanation I’m asking for?” raged Yu Qianxue.

“What does you being in solitary confinement have to do with me? It was your unruly subordinate that wanted to take my life. Am I not allowed to fight back? It’s all your responsibility and has nothing to do with me. Also, since we’ve signed a contract, you need to give me a martial master status plate. Since you have time today, get it done quickly,” said Long Chen.

To become a prince or princess’s training partner was a recognition of one’s power. Otherwise, the prince or princess wouldn’t sacrifice one of these precious spots.

As a result, the person chosen would immediately be promoted from an ordinary martial artist into a martial master, directly skipping the martial fighter rank.

A martial master already possessed a certain level of status. With it, you could directly join the army and become a squad captain rather than starting as a regular soldier.

Also, it was easier for squad captains to accumulate merit on the battlefield. They would be able to advance through the ranks much faster.

“You have the gall to ask me to issue you a martial master tablet?!” Yu Qianxue frowned deeply. Just looking at his confident and bold appearance enraged her. She couldn’t believe her eyes.

“That’s what’s written on the contract,” said Long Chen lightly.

“Alright, then today you are my formal training partner. We’ll fight in a bit.” Yu Qianxue snorted and fished out a new status plate for him. On one side were the words Martial Master, while the other side had the mark of the princess mansion on it, as well as her name.

In other words, this martial master status plate was issued based on Yu Qianxue’s approval. If there were any problems, she would also have responsibility for it.

Long Chen received it with a smile. “Many thanks.”

“Don’t thank me too soon. Now that you’re my formal training partner, I have the authority to request a fight with you. Activate the mansion’s eighteen grand formations!” shouted Yu Qianxue while looking at Long Chen like she was going to give him a vicious lesson.

“You shouldn’t. Your Yang Qi is deficient, your Yin Qi is soaring, your aura is turbulent, and your mind is in a severely weary state. You can’t fight properly today. Pick another time,” said Long Chen indifferently.

Long Chen didn’t know what the solitary confinement involved, but Yu Qianxue was clearly weary that even her mind was not in a good condition. For an expert like her to be weakened to this extent, it was as if she had been tortured.

“According to the contract, you have no authority to decline! Even if I’m not in my peak condition, I can still beat you!” said Yu Qianxue coldly.

“According to the contract, there are conditions under which I can decline. For example… my body doesn’t feel comfortable right now,” said Long Chen.

“Why would you be uncomfortable?!” raged Yu Qianxue.

“Physiologically, you know, men always feel uncomfortable a few days a month.” Long Chen shrugged helplessly.

“You… you have no shame!”

Yu Qianxue’s hair stood on end from how angry she was, and her guards looked at Long Chen dumbfoundedly. How could he even say such a reason?

“Alright, since you’re not comfortable, I order you to watch the main gate!” Yu Qianxue’s voice was almost a howl.

…

According to the contract, after becoming the training partner of a prince or princess, the prince or princess was obligated to provide the training partner with a good cultivation environment, a guarantee of safety, and a generous wage.

However, not everyone got the same treatment. Some of them were not even important subordinates but simply employees with better talents. Thus, as long as they weren’t humiliated by the orders, they simply had to do their job well and they were set for life.

Outside the capital was a giant park with towering trees and dense vegetation. There were all kinds of precious medicinal plants here.

This was essentially a giant medicinal field, one of the imperial family’s businesses, and it was currently under Yu Qianxue’s administration. Within the Vermilion Bird Empire, all the princes and princesses had their own businesses. Otherwise, if they just relied on the stipend given to them as members of the royal family, they wouldn’t even be able to fully feed themselves, let alone their individual forces.

Hence, the imperial family left a portion of its businesses to the princes and princesses to manage. In other words, they could gain greater authority through proper management, and the profit from these businesses all went into their own pocket after deducting the taxes. But if they were to make any business mistakes, the royal family would take everything back at any moment.

Since Long Chen refused to fight with Yu Qianxue, Yu Qianxue directly ordered him to guard the medicinal farm.

This was rather humiliating work, but Long Chen was happy to do it. He had heard that there was a kind of spiritual creature called the Lightning Flash Sable here. It was covered in purple fur and possessed a trace of thunderforce. It wasn’t particularly powerful, but it was incredibly fast, so it was very difficult to catch.

It didn’t injure people, but it would often sneak its way into the medicinal field to steal the fruit. Furthermore, it also had the special ability to pass through barrier formations.

Perhaps if the grand formation was activated, it would be unable to pierce through. But keeping the formation activated at all times was untenable. The profits from the medicinal field would all be wasted on keeping up the formation.

Thus, to save money, it was people who patrolled the fields and made sure to drive off the Lightning Flash Sables and other pests. But when Long Chen arrived, he saw a few medicinal plants that he didn’t have in the primal chaos space, so he decided to directly become an embezzler.

However, while this medicinal field had millions of plants, not many were particularly precious. Long Chen only found a few hundred that he didn’t have.

After that, he went to the gate. He was preparing to keep studying the Seven Star Battle Armor when a Lightning Flash Sable ran up to him. It actually wasn’t the slightest bit afraid of Long Chen and just chattered to him.

“So this medicinal field was your home?”Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

To his surprise, he was actually able to roughly understand the Lighting Flash Sable’s spiritual fluctuations.

Before the medicinal field appeared, this area was the home of the Lightning Flash Sables. But after the medicinal field was built, these Lightning Flash Sables were driven away.

They had no choice but to find lightning attribute plants for food, but it was even harder to find them in other places. It was much harsher for them. Hence, it was asking Long Chen to be flexible and gather some for them.

This Lightning Flash Sable mentioned that Long Chen had the blessing of the rainbow crane on him, so he was definitely a good person that would help it.

Long Chen dug out a rock from the ground, raising the fence and barrier. “Gather your family and get as much as you can. In any case, it’s not mine.”

Long Chen directly sat and closed his eyes in meditation. As a result, less than half a day later, Yu Qingxuan came running over frantically. When she saw thousands and thousands of Lightning Flash Sables stealing from the medicinal field, she was ashen with rage.

“Long Chen, what are you doing?!”

“Watching over the gate, no?” said Long Chen lazily.

“If you’re watching the gate, why didn’t you bother with all the Lightning Flash Sables stealing the plants?!” Yu Qianxue pointed at the Lightning Flash Sables that now fled hastily.

“You told me to watch the gate and not anything else. Tell me, did I lose the gate? Did it break under my watch?” asked Long Chen.

“You…!”

Yu Qianxue felt her blood rushing up to her head. At this moment, she felt the world spinning around her and she collapsed.
