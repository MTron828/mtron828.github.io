Chapter 3310 Heavenly Rainbow Appears

After the Nine Underworld Hunter vanished, Bai Xiaole and the others clenched their teeth furiously. This bastard was truly malicious.

His final sentence in particular, saying that Long Chen would only be exposed when he was forced to the brink of death, was clearly labeling him as an underworld ghost seed.

As a result, anyone who found Long Chen unpleasant now had a righteous excuse to attack him. They would be warriors of justice. This was absolutely shameless.

“He should bless his luck that this is the fairy plaza. Otherwise, he definitely wouldn’t leave here alive,” said Bai Shishi darkly. As the High Firmament Academy’s heavenly fairy, she had never suffered such an insult. Although it was targeted toward Long Chen, it was still unacceptable.

“It’s nothing more than a God Dao incarnation. It’s not even a clone. Even if you killed it, it would be meaningless.” Long Chen shook his head and smiled.

“You can still smile?” Seeing that Long Chen was still able to smile after unleashing such overwhelming killing intent, Bai Shishi was speechless.

“Isn’t gaining an enemy something to rejoice about? Without them, I’d be very poor. As for rumors, it doesn’t matter. Just like what this senior said, the higher you want to climb, the more resistance you will face. In cultivation, there’s no need to talk reason. I am not as grand as the Heavenly Rainbow Fairy, nor do I have the heart that bemoans the state of the universe and pities the fate of mankind. For anyone who blocks my path, there is only one response. Kill!”

Long Chen didn’t know what illness he had contracted, but having more enemies actually made him more excited. A fiery, war-like blood ignited within him.

“Dean Long Chen, please, there’s no need to call us seniors. With your status and learning, you can treat us with equal seniority,” said one of the Immortal Kings very curiously. The killing intent that Long Chen had just released almost made them collapse.

Furthermore, he said that he had destroyed the Bloodkill Hall in the Heavenly Rainbow Domain. They didn’t dare to believe it, yet they also felt that Long Chen wouldn’t bother lying about such a thing.

They no longer dared to view Long Chen as an ordinary Four Peak disciple. Furthermore, he represented the High Firmament Academy.

“I came here today under the status of an ordinary member of the human race in order to pay my respects to the Heavenly Rainbow Fairy. According to age, hierarchy, and cultivation accomplishment, you truly are my seniors. I’ve also brought trouble for you due to my arrival. I hope that you won’t blame me,” said Long Chen with a smile.

“How can you say such a thing? How about we arrange for you to offer your flowers right now?” probed one of the Immortal Kings.

They were afraid that Long Chen would cause more trouble here. What if someone else provoked Long Chen and he killed them? Then they would be caught in an awkward position.

Long Chen shook his head. “All people are equal in front of the Heavenly Rainbow Fairy. I, Long Chen, do not believe myself to be special. Seniors, please go back to your regular work. As long as no one else here goes too far, I won’t make things hard on you.”

These Immortal Kings knew that Long Chen had finished venting his anger. Theoretically, there really should be no problem. But just what were they supposed to do if someone came and provoked him?

Helplessly, the six of them left. They let a group of other experts accompany Long Chen. Bluntly speaking, those people were to prevent others from provoking Long Chen.

The plaza settled back down. However, now there was a new respect in people’s eyes when they looked at Long Chen.

Suddenly, someone walked toward Long Chen. Quite a few people jumped, thinking that someone was targeting Long Chen once more. Even those experts left behind by the Immortal Kings twitched. They were about to reprimand this person when the latter said, “Senior apprentice-brother Long Chen, we have seven brothers who came to pay respects to the Heavenly Rainbow Fairy. It will soon be our turn. However, we greatly admire you, and your time is precious. We are willing to give you our place so that you can offer your sacrifice first. We brothers have nothing else to do, so we’ll go back to the back of the line.”

When they heard this, everyone sighed with relief. Long Chen was also surprised. “Then many thanks, brother.”

As a result of this, Long Chen saved quite a bit of time. He took out a case. “I’d ask brother to not mind this small regard.”

Long Chen didn’t like to accept favors from others for no good reason. So, he gave this person a treasure pill.

However, that person’s expression sank. He coldly said, “Although we brothers might not come from riches, riches do not make a man. Brother, are you looking down on us?”

Feeling startled, Long Chen took back the case and smiled. “That was rude of me. I apologize. I’ll remember this favor.”

Hearing Long Chen say this, this person smiled and left, going to the back of the line with his group.

Long Chen and the others took their place. They were right at the front of the line now.Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

At this distance, Long Chen’s arm tingled and Huo Linger manifested beside him.

“Big brother, I like this big sister. I can feel a familiarity with her. It’s like I’m seeing my family.” Huo Linger ran out, even stopping her absorption of the fire lily seed. She held Long Chen’s hand and gazed up at the Heavenly Rainbow Fairy’s statue.

Huo Linger’s sudden appearance made Bai Shishi and the others jump. They had no idea of her existence. Normally, Huo Linger only came out in flame form, so they didn’t recognize her.

“Of course you feel close to her. Just like you, she is a spirit of fire. You are both embodiments of flames.” Long Chen gently rubbed her head.

“Unfortunately, big sister isn’t here. There’s only a trace of her soul left in the statue. I feel sad.” Tears actually appeared in Huo Linger’s ears. They dripped down, becoming clumps of flame runes that fell to the ground. They didn’t ignite the ground when they fell. Instead, they were absorbed by it.

Long Chen didn’t know how to comfort Huo Linger. As she grew stronger, she gained her own intelligence and her own emotions.

It was her first time seeing someone just like her, but all she was seeing was a statue. It was like seeing a corpse. That pain wasn’t something outsiders could comprehend.

“Hey, don’t cry. We came to offer sacrifices to big sister. She’ll definitely bless us.” Long Chen pulled the sobbing Huo Linger forward slowly. He then placed the fresh flowers in his hand at her feet.

After putting down his flowers, Long Chen slowly looked up. He stared into the Heavenly Rainbow Fairy’s eyes. At that moment, rainbow light appeared in her eyes, and Long Chen felt the world become quiet. Everyone within the grand plaza had faded away.

Only Long Chen and Huo Linger remained in front of the statue. Just as he was shocked, divine light condensed into the form of a beautiful woman in rainbow-colored robes.

“Heavenly Rainbow Fairy!”

Long Chen couldn’t help being shocked when he saw her. The Heavenly Rainbow Fairy had actually manifested in front of him.
