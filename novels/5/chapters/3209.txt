Long Chen’s eye was in sharp pain. Blood continued to flow out of it. Bai Xiaole’s mother helped him wipe away the blood. White light appeared on her palm. When that light shone on his eye, the pain slowly faded.

“Isn’t it only because I had no other way? I used up all my trump cards. If I didn’t do something reckless, I would have lost my life,” said Long Chen helplessly.

Even when he was unconscious, he had vaguely felt the pain in his eye. But during this time, he had also sensed that someone seemed to be pressing on his eye to relieve the pressure slightly. Now he knew that Bai Xiaole’s mother had been standing by his side this entire time.

“Then why did you anger the heavenly tribulation and fight against the Heavenly Daos? Weren’t you playing with your life?” she demanded.

With the support of the white light from her hand, his eye stopped bleeding. The pain lessened quite a bit. But he still didn’t dare to open it.

“What do you mean, angering the heavenly tribulation? Even if I didn’t anger it, its power wouldn’t have dropped. I’m all too familiar with it. I just quickened the pace a bit. I just skipped some of the steps because I was worried about those bastards escaping,” said Long Chen.

Seeing that Long Chen could still smile at this time, Bai Xiaole’s mother was speechless. This child had played with his life to the point that he was used to it. That didn’t seem like a good thing. He could still smile so cheerfully after barely escaping with his life.

“I made a new eyepatch for you. There’s a spatial formation on it. It can you suppress that thing. However, those black swords are truly bizarre. No one has any way to deal with them. For now, you will be unable to open your eye.” Bai Xiaole’s mother took out a new eyepatch. There were runes covering it. When he put it on, a cool feeling fell over his eye. The sense of pain completely vanished.

“Hehe, many thanks, senior.”

Long Chen was endlessly grateful. Thanks to her skill in pupil arts, his eye would no longer be in pain. That was enough.

As for the energy of the seven swords, he would think of a way to slowly refine them. After saying a few more words, Bai Xiaole’s mother left.

Long Chen looked inside himself. He found that countless runes had appeared within his bloodline. These were the Heavenly Dao runes that had appeared during his tribulation.

Originally, he had thought that those Heavenly Dao runes would be absorbed by Lei Long. He hadn’t expected them to appear in his blood.

After this tribulation, he found that all his aspects had gone through a heaven-toppling transformation, whether it was his physical body, soul, mental energy, and even his flame energy.

The Four Peak realm normally only strengthened the four attributes that a person chose to decide their future cultivation direction.

However, Long Chen’s heavenly tribulation had resulted in all the Heavenly Dao runes being sucked into his blood without him even being aware of it.

“Is this related to those seven black swords?”

Long Chen suddenly thought of those seven swords. Due to having to fight them off, he hadn’t even had time during the tribulation to absorb those Heavenly Dao runes.

Long Chen focused his mental energy on his left eye. His left eye instantly began to sting. But this investigation didn’t cause anything odd.

Long Chen found that in the Three Flower Pupil of his left eye, the seven swords were embedded into the center of the flower. They contained such terrifying power that he shivered just sensing them now. He had almost died to these seven swords.

They were completely bizarre. They contained every kind of energy in the world. It seemed that they had no weaknesses. There was nothing that suppressed them. If the Purgatory Eyes hadn’t worked, Long Chen really would have died.

Although he had long since expected his tribulation to be terrifying, he still hadn’t expected it to have reached this extent.

As he examined them more closely, he found that the seven swords were covered by a mysterious dark energy. They actually didn’t repel each other. Instead, they seemed mutually attracted to each other.

The dragon expert had said that the Purgatory Eyes were the window to the dark energy inside his body. Could it be that these seven black swords also contained dark energy?

Wasn’t it said that heavenly tribulation was purely on the side of Yang? How was there dark energy?

Long Chen suddenly shuddered. He had a feeling that his current understanding of heavenly tribulation was being toppled.

“Big brother Long Chen!”

Just then, a light cry rang out, drawing him out of his stupor. His arm shook. A three-inch miniature person jumped onto his palm.

That was a violet-haired girl. Her eyes had lightning runes flickering in them that contained destructive power.

“Lei Linger, you’ve finally transformed again?” Long Chen was delighted. This meant that Lei Linger had finally obtained the acknowledgement of the immortal world’s Heavenly Daos. It could leave Long Chen and freely control heavenly lightning.

“This heavenly tribulation gave me greater control. I’ve finally regained that feeling of freedom that I had on the Martial Heaven Continent. However, the suppression of the Heavenly Daos here is stronger. I can only transform into this small form, and I can’t form hand seals myself,” said Lei Linger.

“No need to worry. You’ve fully regained your spirituality. You’re only a step away from truly transforming,” said Long Chen.

“Big brother Long Chen, can you send me into your eye? I can absorb the power of the seven swords,” said Lei Linger, hopping onto his shoulder.

“Are you sure you can absorb them? You won’t be rejected?” asked Long Chen. This was no joke. One mistake could be fatal.

“I’m sure. Those black swords contain thunderforce, along with other energies. Due to the other energies, I was unable to directly absorb them. But they don’t reject me,” said Lei Linger confidently.

“Alright, try it.” Long Chen clenched his teeth. Leaving the seven swords in his eye forever was no solution. It wasn’t as if he could only keep one eye open for the rest of his life. If Lei Linger was so confident, then she could try it.

Lei Linger transformed into a lightning rune that Long Chen slowly sent into his left eye. He was prepared to drag her out at any moment if something happened.

However, he was pleasantly surprised to find that there was no change when Lei Linger entered. The Three Flower Pupil didn’t react, and the seven swords merely quivered ever so slightly before falling silent.

The lightning rune slowly spread like a web towards the seven swords. However, the swords still didn’t react.

Through this net, Lei Linger began absorbing their power. However, it was extremely slow. The swords didn’t even seem to sense it.

Seeing that, Long Chen relaxed. The problem with his eye was being resolved. He continued looking within himself. He suddenly noticed a swirling vortex beneath his Dantian.

“The seventh star!”

Long Chen instantly shot up.
