Chapter 3411 Shameless Sacred Pill Hall

Everyone, including Lei Yuner, stared at Long Chen. A Lightning Spirit Blood Soul Pill was worth thirty immortal king crystals. And he crushed it just like that? What was that for?

The expression of the Sacred Pill Hall’s elder sank. Clearly, he thought that Long Chen’s action was a provocation.

As for the Water Mallard race’s experts, they actually thought that Long Chen was angry at their provocation and had lost control of himself. Just as Wu Ling was feeling pleased and about to mock him, she heard Long Chen start talking.

“Lightning Spirit Blood Soul Grass, Thousand Leaf Vermillion Fruit, Violet Root Magnolia Vine, Flowerless Ivy, Wheel Seeds…”

Long Chen eyed the resulting powder of the Lightning Spirit Blood Soul Pill, occasionally sniffing as well. He rattled off a list of medicinal ingredients.

These names left others befuddled, but the elder was completely shocked. Long Chen was listing out all the ingredients in the pill.

Furthermore, the most unbelievable thing was that the order he listed was the order that they had to be placed in the pill furnace. He wasn’t the slightest bit off.

“You… you are an alchemist?” asked the elder in shock.

Lei Yuner, Ying Bokong, and even Wu Ying were all startled to hear this. They stared at Long Chen in disbelief.

“A bit,” said Long Chen, smiling slightly.

This Lightning Spirit Blood Soul Pill would count as being above average in difficulty to refine. Although it was a tier four medicinal pill, with Long Chen’s current soul energy and Huo Linger’s power, refining it wasn’t anything difficult.

Something as trash as this was actually treated as a treasure by the Sacred Pill Hall to be sold for such a high price. It was truly a scam.

“Since you are an alchemist, you can join my Sacred Pill Hall. As long as you pass the exam, you can live in the Bright Cloud Domain and obtain a never-ending supply of medicinal ingredients. I don’t mind telling you that this domain is a heavenly place that alchemists dream of reaching. I feel like you can consider it,” said the elder, his entire tone changing after learning that Long Chen was an alchemist.

“I don’t feel like it. Alchemy is a side hustle for me. I never wanted to be a true alchemist. I was just curious about the Lightning Spirit Blood Soul Pill. Can I trouble you to give me a Lightning Spirit Blood Soul Grass?” asked Long Chen.

The elder didn’t immediately agree. He looked at Long Chen. “You should know that the Integral Heaven Star-Field is dominated by my Sacred Pill Hall. The heavens cannot have two suns, and the people cannot have two lords. This place welcomes all cultivators, but if anyone causes trouble, they usually won’t have a good ending.”

The elder was clearly threatening him. The Sacred Pill Hall was monopolizing the medicinal pill market of the Integral Heaven Star-Field. They would not allow anyone else to sell medicinal pills here.

The Sacred Pill Hall was well aware of just how they priced their pills. So they would not permit anyone to come in and undercut them.

They were truly shameless people. On the Martial Heaven Continent, Pill Valley had even sold fake medicine. Here, they instead took a monopoly and charged outrageous prices. Lord Brahma’s followers were all only capable of shameful acts.

Long Chen sneered, “I only want to buy a single Lightning Spirit Blood Soul Grass. Tell me, is the essence refined from a single grass enough for a single furnace of Lightning Spirit Blood Soul Pills? Even if it could, I have never refined such a pill before. Do you think I could refine such a difficult pill on my first try? Don’t tell me that your Sacred Pill Hall is so afraid of me refining pills that you don’t even dare to sell me a single Lightning Spirit Blood Soul Grass?”

The elder’s expression softened when he heard that. Long Chen was correct. The Lightning Spirit Blood Soul Pill was a difficult pill to refine. Even practiced masters often failed, let alone someone who hadn’t reached the Divine Lord realm.

“The Lightning Spirit Blood Soul Grass is priced at three stalks for one immortal king crystal. I will give face to the Lightning Falcon race and give you an additional two. How about we close the curtains to today’s matter here in order to avoid harming our friendship?” said the elder generously.

The main thing was that he didn’t believe that a little Four Peak disciple could truly refine the Lightning Spirit Blood Soul Pill. Even if he could, it would probably be low grade or trash grade. Without practicing it many times, it was very difficult to refine it.

Thus, one stalk or five stalks of grass made no difference to him, so he intentionally acted generous. It was quite sly. Through this, it covered up any previous air of displeasure, and neither side would make things hard on the other.

“Then many thanks. I know that you were only following your duty and not intentionally harming the Lightning Falcon race. We have no intention of blaming you,” said Long Chen with a smile. He then put away the five palm-sized stalks of Lightning Spirit Blood Soul Grass. Inside, he was cursing the elder’s entire family.

This old bastard acted courteous, when in fact he gave Long Chen the worst Lightning Spirit Blood Soul Grasses that he had. Three of them were essentially trash. Most of their medicinal nature had decayed.

Even though two were still complete, they hadn’t reached full maturity and didn’t contain enough energy. This old fellow was truly treacherous. Not cursing him out loud was already showing great restraint.

“Haha, exactly. The Lightning Falcon race is a noble race. They naturally wouldn’t make a fuss over such a minor affair,” laughed the elder.

“Right, the Lightning Falcon race is a noble race that soars over the heavens. They definitely live a different life when compared to those bugs crawling their way through the earth, or ducks that ingratiate to anyone they can. I’m sure you must be busy with business, so we’ll leave first.” Long Chen laughed and left with Lei Yuner.

“Hold it!”

Only after Long Chen and Lei Yuner had started walking away did Wu Ying react and realize that Long Chen was cursing her. She pointed at Long Chen, but before she could curse him, the Sacred Pill Hall’s elder coldly said, “It is forbidden to make a ruckus in this region of business.” He was at ease with what Long Chen had just said. He knew that Long Chen wouldn’t do what he shouldn’t do. He wouldn’t cause trouble for the Sacred Pill Hall.

Lei Yuner laughed. She also only realized Long Chen’s insult now. The heads of the demonic beasts really weren’t as agile. But seeing Wu Ying’s current expression almost made her dance.

Ignoring Wu Ying’s fury, they walked away. It wasn’t that long after when they heard Wu Ying roar and the elder indifferently say, “Whether you want to buy it or not, don’t shout so loudly.”

Clearly, the inflated price of the medicinal pills was not targeted toward the Lightning Falcon race. Just now, the Water Mallard race had been laughing at them, but their retribution had come.

After hearing that furious roar, Lei Yuner was in an excellent mood. Holding Long Chen’s hand, she said, “Why don’t I buy five hundred for now? After I advance, I must immediately stabilize my foundation. If I buy a thousand, then I won’t have enough to buy you a weapon. But five hundred should just barely be enough to make my blood soul power stable afterward,” said Lei Yuner.Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

Looking at this tender girl, especially the naivety in her eyes, Long Chen’s heart softened. He said, “I will help you handle the Lightning Spirit Blood Soul Pills. But I have a request.”

“What is it?”

“I want to learn your Lightning Falcon race’s movement art.”
