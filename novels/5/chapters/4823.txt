Chapter 4812 The Celestial Race’s Number Three Expert

When golden light filled the air, chains as thick as arms wrapped around the devil lord like golden dragons.

The devil lord struggled crazily, tearing the earth apart and causing the golden chains to creak. Unfortunately for it, the chains were embedded deep into the earth. Unless it could pull up the entire ground, it couldn’t escape.

Bai Shishi was no longer the same as when she had first entered the Sovereign Emperor Heaven. Having merged with the energy of the Heavenly Daos of this world, she had absorbed the purest metal energy, causing her own metal energy to undergo a qualitative transformation. This transformation not only brought her closer to Heavenly Dao energy but also enabled her to unleash even greater power.

Previously, her metal energy had been too rigid, lacking the flexibility to withstand such strain. The brittle chains would have shattered instantly. However, her new chains were far tougher. Although they might stretch under pressure, they would not snap.

The devil lord raged, and the other devil creatures vainly tried to save it. They formed a wave of death, even detonating themselves in order to attack the Dragonblood warriors.

However, the dragonblood warriors’ cooperation was flawless. Even without Guo Ran to direct them, they instantly formed a defensive formation that blocked the devil creatures.

Long Chen grabbed Evilmoon and pointed it at the devil lord’s head. However, just as his blade was about to pierce its head, he suddenly thrust Evilmoon behind him.

Sparks exploded as Long Chen's saber pierced through a black shield, revealing an astonished figure behind it.

The figure was a white-robed man, appearing somewhat handsome but with a face covered in pockmarks. No one knew when he had managed to sneak up on Long Chen, nor did anyone understand how Long Chen had detected his presence.

“The Celestial race is only capable of using worthless tricks like this,” Long Chen snorted. Suddenly, Evilmoon quivered, causing the shield to shatter as it pierced towards the man's head.

The white-robed man wasn’t hiding his status and was wearing robes of the Celestial race. Long Chen could not be more familiar with those robes.

“As I suspected, Yue Wuxu’s death at your hands was justified,” the pockmarked man snorted, reaching out to grab Evilmoon’s blade as it pierced toward his head.

“Courting death!”

Long Chen and Evilmoon were both enraged by this. The pockmarked man's daring move to grab Evilmoon's blade was the ultimate provocation to them both.

With a resounding explosion, he indeed caught hold of Evilmoon's tip with his hand. The tremendous power contained within Evilmoon dissipated as if it were a stone sinking into the depths of the ocean.

Xia Chen and the others were shocked. They knew just how strong Long Chen was, so it was unimaginable for them that someone could block his attack barehanded.

“I’m impressed you managed to kill Yue Wuxu. He was ranked tenth amongst the Celestial race’s heavenly geniuses. However, your strength is insufficient in front of me,” stated the pockmarked man indifferently.

“Then what rank are you?” asked Long Chen, his battle intent rising.

“Did you think that I’m rank one? Sorry to disappoint you, but I am rank...” The pockmarked man had the time to leisurely raise his other hand and raise three fingers.

However, someone who could block Long Chen’s saber barehanded was perhaps qualified to act like this. Even Bai Shishi and the others’ expressions changed at this revelation.

“You were the one who assumed that I thought you were rank one. In truth, I didn’t think so. I was just curious,” replied Long Chen lightly.

At this moment, the devil lord was still struggling, but Bai Shishi’s metal energy bound it firmly, while Li Qi and Song Mingyuan summoned two earth giants to restrict its limbs. Since the devil lord was under control, Long Chen was in no rush.

“Oh, is that so? Well, that’s not important. Even if you didn’t ask, I’d have told you. After all, I have to teach you just how vast the heavens are. Ants like you from outside of the Sovereign Emperor Heaven always think that you are mighty. It’s annoying. Other than that, I am to tell you that my name is Zhang Benzhi. Remember my name. After all, once you’re dead, you wouldn’t want to be a stupid ghost unsure of its killer.”

“Then I suppose I don’t need to give you my name?” Long Chen smiled.

“No. I don’t need to remember the name of everyone I kill. After all, I really can’t remember them all.”

Long Chen shook his head. “If you truly believed you could kill me, you wouldn't waste so much time talking. You're stalling for something. Those Heaven Saints have gone to the academy, haven't they? The others don't dare to enter this place due to the Heavenly Dao seal suppressing their cultivation bases. Hence, you're not here to kill me; you're buying time for them. Normally, I’d let you keep acting. But reclaiming the academy’s territory is too important for me to do that.”

Suddenly, black qi surged from Evilmoon, accompanied by a potent divine pressure that slowly intensified, causing the world to tremble.

“Smart. You saw through this. Since that’s the case, I won’t bother buying time. To tell the truth, if it weren’t for those higher-ups giving me the order, I wouldn’t have bothered stalling time. But since you’ve seen through it, they can’t blame me. Now my goal is to kill you. Are you ready?” Zhang Benzhi suddenly grew serious, his pockmarked face looking like the face of a devil now.

Long Chen remained silent, but his aura continued to climb. He would use his actions as his reply. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

The cloud sea behind Zhang Benzhi continued to rage and expand, covering the sky.

Zhang Benzhi coldly said, “It’s useless. My manifestation can devour all your energy. This is the divine ability of the Cloudrubbing race. In front of me, all your efforts are meaningless. Once you use up all your energy, you will—”

Suddenly, a starry sea appeared above Evilmoon, illuminating the darkness with its celestial lights. An awe-inspiring power surged forth, sending shockwaves through the very fabric of the world.
