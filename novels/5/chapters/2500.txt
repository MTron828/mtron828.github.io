Chapter 2490 The Ghost Ship Reappears

Black qi flowed around Ye Ming and began to mix with the black flood. It seemed that he was borrowing its power to attack the white-robed man.

“Leave this fellow to me. You should know what to do!” shouted Ye Ming.

BOOM!

The white-robed man swung his sword. Ye Ming was instantly sent flying, but after retreating into the black torrent, he flew back out and attacked once more.

At the same time, Feng Fei, Zhao Ritian, and Di Feng seemed to agree with Ye Ming and went straight toward Long Chen.

“Long Chen, your death is at hand,” sneered Di Feng.

Three powerful experts were attacking Long Chen simultaneously, instantly putting him in an inferior position. Even fleeing would be difficult.

Suddenly, an arrow pierced through the air. Facing the arrow, Di Feng snorted and his body became illusory. As a result, the arrow passed through his body without causing any damage. The only one capable of injuring him was the white-robed man.

“Mo Nian, your attacks are useless against me. Once I kill Long Chen, I’ll come for you,” sneered Di Feng, ignoring Mo Nian and attacking Long Chen.

“Mo Nian, you kill that Ritian idiot. Leave this fellow to me,” shouted Long Chen. He swung Evilmoon at Di Feng.

“Big words,” sneered Di Feng. His body quickly became illusory. Evilmoon passed straight through his body just like Mo Nian’s arrows.

“Your attacks are nothing more than…” Di Feng laughed, his body becoming solid once more.

Just at that moment, Long Chen twisted Evilmoon. Its dragon marks lit up, and it cut Di Feng in two.

“What?!”

Di Feng’s sneer vanished, replaced with shock that was echoed by the other experts. Long Chen was actually able to counter his bizarre technique.

Evilmoon stabbed forward, this time aiming for Di Feng’s head. However, Feng Fei’s sword appeared in front of it, and with a swing, she sent Long Chen flying. His hand almost broke.

“Long Chen, if you surrender now, I can spare your life,” said Feng Fei.

“A person who can make me surrender has yet to be born in this world. Whatever abilities you have, go ahead and bring them out,” snorted Long Chen.

“Our target is him, but if you want to die so badly, fine.” A cold light flickered in Feng Fei’s eyes. In her eyes, Long Chen was ignoring her kindness.

BOOM!

Zhao Ritian was blown up by Mo Nian’s arrow. Mo Nian might not be able to do anything to Di Feng’s strange Emperor technique, but he had plenty of room to play when it came to Zhao Ritian. After all, Zhao Ritian was in a weakened state.

“Feng Fei, hurry up and kill Long Chen! Why are you wasting words?!” shouted Zhao Ritian. His body quickly reformed.

Ye Ming and the white-robed man were still fighting, but Ye Ming was clearly at an immense disadvantage. In just a few exchanges, he was coughing up blood, but he persevered in order to tie the white-robed man down.

Mo Nian had suppressed Zhao Ritian, but with his undying body, Mo Nian was unable to kill him quickly. Every time Mo Nian wanted to go help Long Chen, Zhao Ritian summoned his manifestation and blocked him.

With Feng Fei and Di Feng attacking Long Chen at the same time, he was in immense danger. Even a single Feng Fei wasn’t someone he could handle in his current state, let alone adding in another opponent who had gained the Blood Emperor’s inheritance.

Feng Fei stopped trying to convince Long Chen after his refusal. She repeatedly attacked, her blood sword unleashing waves of power.

Long Chen snorted and swung Evilmoon behind him, perfectly blocking Di Feng’s sneak attack. He then gripped Evilmoon with both hands, preparing to unleash his full power to receive Feng Fei’s attack.

Killing intent raged within him. He no longer cared about Feng Fei’s existence. All he had was a belief in killing his opponent. Even if he was no longer at his peak, as long as he could grasp the slightest chance, he could still kill her. Even a weaker person could kill a stronger opponent with just one chance.

BOOM!

Suddenly, divine light flew over, knocking Feng Fei back. Her expression changed. “Yu Qingxuan, what are you doing?!”

The divine light had come from the Pill Fairy and had been aimed for Feng Fei’s vitals.

The Pill Fairy ignored Feng Fei. She turned to Long Chen. “Hand over the three divine bones and I will not participate in this battle.”

Everyone was startled. If the Pill Fairy joined in, Long Chen really would be dead. In his weakened state, how was he supposed to face such powerful opponents?

Nangong Zuiyue and Beitang Rushuang exchanged a glance. They both nodded. Now was the time for them to join in.

“Hahaha!” Long Chen suddenly laughed. His voice was icy. “If you want to attack, then come. Let’s see who is capable of taking my life.”

Long Chen was the most infuriated by the Pill Fairy. If others attacked him, he wouldn’t feel such rage. Only the Pill Fairy could cause him to feel such anger.

Despite knowing that the Pill Fairy was now Lord Brahma’s puppet, he was unable to accept her icy and emotionless treatment.

A flame lotus rapidly condensed in his hand, and sacred chanting filled the air. Flame energy surged toward Long Chen.

“So you’ve obtained the third volume of the Nirvana Scripture. But I won’t let you release this technique.” The Pill Fairy shook her head. She summoned the Daynight Furnace, but before she could attack, rumbling rang out. From the other side of the black flood came a giant figure that was causing space to explode.

“A Ghost Ship!”

Startled cries rang out. This was a completely black ship that gave off an air of immense decay. Just looking at it was terrifying.

The world started to collapse. People began to flee, but in the next instant, the Ghost Ship broke the shackles of space and time. Chaotic space filled this world, throwing the laws of heaven and earth into disorder. Long Chen’s flame lotus was also affected and instantly dissipated.

In that instant, the world was thrown into chaos. Everyone lost their connection to the world’s energy.

The Ghost Ship was like its own world crashing into this one. The chaotic flow of space poured into this world. As a result, some of the experts who had begun to flee were sucked into that chaotic flow. One of them, a peak expert capable of reaching this place, was instantly crushed.

People were horrified to find that the arrival of the Ghost Ship had thrown time into chaos as well. Their own senses were off. The Ghost Ship had entered this world, and they had lost their best chance to escape.

“Get onto the ship!” shouted Mo Nian. He shot an arrow onto the top side of the ship, and a hook appeared at the end of the arrow, clinging onto the Ghost Ship. A long chain then grew out of the arrow.

The chaotic flow of spacetime threatened to swallow this entire world. The Ghost Ship was their only choice.

The Ghost Ships were said to be carriers of misfortune and calamity. It was said those who had set foot on a Ghost Ship all died miserably. There was only a single Sovereign who had been a lucky survivor.

Chaotic spacetime continued to pour into this space. Whole regions collapsed like a giant mouth had clamped shut. It seemed that they were only one step from being swallowed into the stomach of a beast.

Mo Nian had flown onto the Ghost Ship, and Long Chen followed without hesitation.

Everyone’s fight was forced to stop due to the Ghost Ship’s arrival. With this world about to be destroyed, the Ghost Ship was their only option. But this option might very well be another path to death or even worse.

The white-robed man looked at the Ghost Ship without joy or sorrow. “It’s finally here.”

With a single step, he arrived on top of the Ghost Ship. His movements were still graceful and easy even through this chaotic flow. It seemed that the chaotic flow of space was unable to affect him.

However, that was not the same for others. Within this chaotic flow, Feng Fei and the others could only use their divine items to protect themselves as they attempted to fly toward the Ghost Ship. Their divine items creaked from the pressure, making them all feel icy chills.

The surprising thing was that Ye Ming was also unaffected by this chaotic flow. He was like a fish in water, chasing after the white-robed man like a specter.

The white-robed man slashed his sword at Ye Ming, tearing through the chaotic flow.

Ye Ming easily dodged, and as a result, the sword left a path through the chaotic flow.

“Many thanks!”

Two experts in particular had been unable to resist the chaotic flow of space and had been sucked by it, but the white-robed man’s attack had created a path for them. The two of them immediately flew onto the boat by following that path.

Ye Ming had realized that he had no advantage in this place. He then looked over at Long Chen who had reached the Ghost Ship and smiled coldly. His jagged sword suddenly slashed toward Nangong Zuiyue and Beitang Rushuang.

Long Chen had only just set foot onto the Ghost Ship and hadn’t had time to appraise the situation when he saw Ye Ming’s sinister smile. Killing intent exploded within him.
