Chapter 4141: Laughable

BOOM!

The spear shuddered, causing cracks to spread throughout the land beneath it. The moment giant flakes of rust fell from the spear, golden light as bright as the sun blasted out of it, illuminating this world. After that, the divine might of an Eternal existence shook heaven and earth.

The spear, which had remained concealed under layers of dust for countless years, finally unveiled its true form. Resembling a golden celestial pillar that seemed to part heaven and earth, it exuded an aura of profound majesty and sanctity.

The overwhelming presence of an Eternal divine item sent shivers down the spines of countless experts, compelling them with the irresistible urge to bow in reverence.

“What a spear!”

Countless people cried out upon seeing a true Eternal divine weapon. Although it had not been awakened, just the rust falling already unleashed a power that shook their souls. This was a priceless treasure.

Still holding the bronze cauldron, Long Chen stared at this spear in amazement. This spear’s runes were in a dragon shape, giving off an ancient and domineering aura. Long Chen was very fond of such arrogant divine weapons.

“Heavens, to be able to strike an Eternal divine weapon without taking any damage, that bronze cauldron really might be the legendary Heaven Earth Cauldron!”

“Even if it’s not the Heaven Earth Cauldron, it has to be on the level of another Eternal divine weapon. How is this fellow so lucky?! Doesn’t this mean that he has two Eternal divine weapons now?”

“Not necessarily. He might not be able to take that spear. Even though he could shake off the rust, the item-spirit has not awoken. Taking it won’t be so easy.”

“That’s right. If Long Chen takes it out of the corpse, the Great Desolate Winged Devil will no longer have anything suppressing its final will. When its final resentment erupts, everyone in that core region will die.”

Hearing this, Guo Ran and the others had a bad feeling and directly retreated. As for Xue Qingkuang and the experts of the Blood Devil race, they also didn’t dare to tarry in the core region.

After all, the Great Desolate Winged Devil had been nailed here for countless years, and its Eternal will was suppressed by the spear all this time. As the spear acted like a seal, once it was removed, the corpse’s Eternal will would wipe out their souls.

“Now, Long Chen is in a difficult position. He’s definitely unwilling to just leave the spear there. But if he pulls it out, the resentment from an Eternal expert will extinguish his mind in an instant. Even if he doesn’t die, he’ll be turned into a crippled idiot.”

Hearing this speculation, quite a few people nodded. If they were Long Chen, that would definitely be the case. They would be unwilling to just give up, but if they did pull it out, it would probably cost them their lives. It was quite the predicament.

“Everyone, did you see? Did you see that?! Does anyone still suspect me of being a scammer?!” shouted Long Chen, raising the bronze cauldron and waving it.

Everyone was left speechless. What was wrong with this fellow? Even at this time, he was still announcing that he had the Heaven Earth Cauldron. Could it be that he had no intention of taking the spear and was only showing off the Heaven Earth Cauldron?

“Hey, junior brother of the human race, I really like you. Pull out that spear so that we can see what it looks like, alright?” Someone waved to Long Chen.

“Long Chen, don’t listen to them! If you pull out the spear, you will be killed by the Eternal will! That beast race fellow has bad intentions!” shouted an elder of the human race hastily.

The one asking Long Chen to pull out the spear was a Heaven Venerate from the beast race. He was intentionally trying to harm Long Chen. He thought that Long Chen was too young and hot-headed, so perhaps he would directly pull out the spear without thinking about it. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

However, there were quite a few human experts in the surroundings, and they all warned Long Chen not to fall for it. After all, he was a heavenly genius of the human race. How could they let Long Chen be conned to death like that?

“Hehe, many thanks for your warning, seniors. Beast creature, you think you can con me? How laughable. Someone who can con me has yet to be born! With your little brain, don’t even try. You’re just making a fool of yourself.” Long Chen first cupped his fists toward the person who warned him to express his thanks before sneering at that Heaven Venerate from the beast race.

Long Chen continued, “Today, I am showing everyone that this bronze cauldron of mine is extraordinary! I also don’t know what it is. However, through the Soaring Dragon Company’s appraisal, it is very likely the primal chaos divine item from legends. Even I can’t say anything for sure. Today, I’ve taken the risk of smashing this spear because I want to verify whether this bronze cauldron is ordinary or not. If it shattered just like that, it would be nothing to cry about. After all, constantly carrying it and having people hunt me for the Heaven Earth Cauldron is quite bothersome. If I were to accidentally lose my little life because of it, it wouldn’t be worth it…”

Quite a few people nodded after hearing Long Chen’s statement. If he didn’t have the Heaven Earth Cauldron but died to some random rumors, that would be quite a vexing death.

“However, everyone has seen that this cauldron truly is extraordinary. It clashed with the spear without taking the slightest damage! Not even a speck of its rust fell! Everyone, just look!”

Long Chen began to revolve the Heaven Earth Cauldron for everyone to see. Although they were very far, they could see that it hadn’t changed in the slightest.

“You really are a conman!”

At this time, the dragon expert couldn’t help but speak.

Long Chen was truly evil. This bronze cauldron was a fake that Guo Ran made. In terms of appearance, it was identical to the Earth Cauldron because Guo Ran had even used the rust that had fallen off of the Earth Cauldron and put it on this counterfeit. Just by looking at it, there was no way to tell the difference.

Long Chen first revealed the counterfeit, then used flames to block everyone’s sight before using the real Earth Cauldron to smash the spear. After that, he switched them out again, causing the people on the outside to be unable to see any clues.

Furthermore, Long Chen was now unashamedly showing off this counterfeit. Even the dragon expert couldn’t keep watching. This fellow was simply evil.

Long Chen simply smiled after obtaining the dragon expert’s praise. He continued, “As a person, I am always honest. I can’t say for sure if this is the true Heaven Earth Cauldron. Thus, I hope an experienced person can help me appraise it. Of course, I won’t let people look at it for free. If someone is particularly fond of this bronze cauldron, well, as long as the price is suitable, I won’t mind selling it. After all, this thing is a hot potato. It’s dangerous for me to keep it. Fortunately, the Sage King Convention is happening. Otherwise, some old shameless fellows might have long since attacked me! That is why I am hoping to deal with it before the Sage King Convention ends. If anyone is interested and has something good to trade for it, come find me at any time!”

Countless people were truly moved. Also, everything he said was logical. This thing was a hot potato. With Long Chen’s cultivation base, he was like a child being thrown into a pack of beggars while holding a block of gold.

It was truly reasonable for Long Chen to want to get rid of it. Other than that, even if it wasn’t the Heaven Earth Cauldron, it had to be on the level of an Eternal divine item, and it still wasn’t something that Long Chen could use. Leaving it in his hands would only draw envy, so it would be better to exchange it for things that he needed.

Seeing that he had achieved his goal, Long Chen didn’t want to let people keep examining the cauldron. He directly put it away.

“No, something’s off! If that really was the Heaven Earth Cauldron, how could a little Immortal King like him be able to take it out and put it away? Even an Eternal divine weapon can’t be used so casually, let alone a primal chaos divine item! Not even innate Heaven Venerates are necessarily capable of using such a thing!” Someone suddenly cried out upon seeing Long Chen put away the cauldron.

Everyone was startled. That person was correct, so they all looked at Long Chen.
