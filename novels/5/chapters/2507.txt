Chapter 2497 Nine Star Heir

Sovereign Yun Shang blocked the flood of energy charging toward Long Chen. A mirror image appeared on his palm as he slammed his hand into the torrent.

The flood shattered. Sovereign Yun Shang was forced back several steps and slammed into Long Chen, resulting in Long Chen coughing up a mouthful of blood and flying back.

Long Chen felt like his entire body had cracked and was only one step away from exploding. He was appalled, still not understanding what had happened.

He had only seen millions of streaks of divine light shooting out of Sovereign Yun Shang’s palm, slicing through this cosmos.

The stars of this cosmos turned to dust when faced with that divine light. It was like fireworks were exploding.

Long Chen stared in shock. The original starry sky around them had vanished. It was instead replaced with their dead remnants.

“Are you alright?”

The Heaven Shrouding Mirror returned to its original appearance as if nothing had happened. Sovereign Yun Shang helped Long Chen up.

“I almost died. Big brother, didn’t you say…” Long Chen shut his mouth. Asking like this was blaming Sovereign Yun Shang.

“I was careless. I didn’t think that your cultivation technique would exceed the limits of the Heaven Shrouding Mirror. Your own cultivation level is too low as well, so it doesn’t have the power to look into even a fraction of the future. Going against that flow resulted in this backlash. Your cultivation technique is truly shocking. If my future self had not merged with this past self, I would not have been able to protect you,” said Sovereign Yun Shang gravely. Things had gone astray from what he had expected. That was a very rare thing for him.

“Big brother, you…!” Long Chen suddenly realized that Sovereign Yun Shang’s face was pale. Even the glimmer in his eyes had faded.

“The impact of this karma was too powerful. I used the Cosmos Reversal power to send the backlash away and scatter that energy, but I still had to endure a bit of it. Don’t worry though, this is just a clone, and I’m already dead. Even if you hadn’t come, over the years, this clone would have faded,” said Sovereign Yun Shang.

Looking at the wreckage of the starry sky, Sovereign Yun Shang suddenly laughed. Looking at Long Chen, he said, “I always thought that you were the gamebreaker of the Martial Heaven Continent, but now I understand.”

“Understand what?”

Yun Shang did not reply to that question. He pointed to the Heaven Shrouding Mirror. “This attempt was a failure. The Heaven Shrouding Mirror only used up a bit of its energy, so you can try again. But don’t try the same cultivation technique as before. I no longer possess the power to endure that power again.”

Long Chen was shocked. Just what kind of origin did the Nine Star Hegemon Body Art have for even a Sovereign to feel such reverence for it?

The backlash from it was something that even a Sovereign had almost been unable to block. The origins of the Nine Star Hegemon Body Art far surpassed Long Chen’s imagination.

Looking at the Heaven Shrouding Mirror, Long Chen thought about it and then walked up to it once more. A flame lotus slowly condensed in his hand.

Within the mirror, another flame lotus appeared.

That flame lotus slowly grew. One flame orb appeared on top of the petals. One begat two, two begat three, then they all worked together to give rise to one flame orb after another.

The Star Fall orbs continued to appear. Five, six, seven…

The flame lotus in Long Chen’s hand vanished. But within the mirror, the Star Fall orbs were continuing to increase. Previously, the strongest World Extermination Flame Lotus that Long Chen had used was at the seven star level. That was his limit.

In the mirror though, an eighth Star Fall quickly appeared on the petals.

“So that’s how it works!” Long Chen suddenly let out a startled cry.

The moment the eighth orb had appeared, the original seven had suddenly dimmed before slowly lighting up once more.

“So by weakening the seven Star Falls in that moment, it gives me more room for error, and then I can easily condense the eighth Star Fall.”

Long Chen instantly realized how to condense the eighth Star Fall. The eight star World Extermination Flame Lotus that he was seeing in the mirror was something his future self had gradually improved.

It was like how it was difficult for an ordinary person to jump over a three-meter fall, but by creating a staircase, it became much easier. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

The eighth Star Fall required pulling back in order to advance. With this cushion room, it was possible to pull off the eighth star easily.

The World Extermination Flame Lotus shuddered. A ninth Star Fall appeared on all the petals. This was the complete nine star World Extermination Flame Lotus.

Eighty-one Star Fall orbs lay on top of its petals like miniature flame universes. At the core was a Taiji diagram slowly spinning. It was like the core of the universe, controlling how the flame lotus circulated.

BOOM!

The World Extermination Flame Lotus exploded. Long Chen’s body shuddered and he retreated. The Heaven Shrouding Mirror returned to its original appearance.

“Its power to divine the future has run out. The Heaven Shrouding Mirror now only has enough energy to divine the past. As long as you have the correct vector, you can divine anything. What do you want to choose?” asked Sovereign Yun Shang.

“Anything?” asked Long Chen.

Sovereign Yun Shang laughed. “Ah, I misspoke. If it was before, I would have said anything, but now all I’m going to say is that yes, in theory you can divine anything.”

“Then I want to try it again,” said Long Chen.

Sovereign Yun Shang nodded. “Then try it. The power of the past should not be as powerful as the future. Perhaps I can block it.”

“Many thanks.” Long Chen cupped his fists gratefully.

Long Chen was extremely curious about the Nine Star Hegemon Body Art. He wanted to know more about it because it was related to his fate.

Originally, he had been thinking about using the Heaven Shrounding Mirror to check his origins, but rather than that, he could try to see the past of the Nine Star Hegemon Body Art. If it failed again, there would still be enough energy to check his past.

Seeing a few fragmentary images was better than nothing. This way he could obtain two chances.

Long Chen stood in front of the Heaven Shrouding Mirror and once more activated the Five Star Battle Armor. Light flowed within the Heaven Shrouding Mirror. Long Chen involuntarily took a step back, ready to retreat.

A long-haired man appeared within the mirror. This man also had a divine ring behind him and five stars in his eyes. He stared at Long Chen coldly.

Sovereign Yun Shang’s pupils shrank. The appearance of this man seemed to shock him even greater than the spacetime backlash.

Long Chen was dumbfounded as he looked at the man in the mirror. What was this? Why would a person appear?

“Senior apprentice-brother? Junior apprentice-brother?” probed Long Chen.

The man was like a statue glaring at Long Chen. After a long time, he finally spat out, “You’ve lost the face of the lineage of the nine stars. You’ve already reached the level of the Five Star Battle Armor but are so weak.”

The five stars within this man’s eyes circulated, and a boundless majestic pressure was unleashed. Its aura was identical to Long Chen’s Five Star Battle Armor, but it was unknown just how many times stronger it was.

His hair slowly rose in an invisible wind. He seemed incredibly angry. “To be a nine star heir, you must cultivate the true essence of the hegemon body. To cultivate the nine stars is to dominate the heavens, to dominate the earth, to slay devils and gods. Within heaven and earth, only the nine stars are supreme. But your current self is a kind of blasphemy to the Nine Star Hegemon Body Art. What face do you have to continue living in this world? Do you know that your current appearance is a disgrace to the nine star lineage?”

The man grew angrier and angrier until he was shouting, his voice like thunder booming through the air. An undefeatable will unfurled. The shattered dust of stars was sucked over and formed a hurricane in the air above him.

“What are you talking about?” demanded Long Chen, also angry.

“I’m going to clean up the lineage of the nine stars!” The man roared and suddenly unleashed a punch.

This one punch froze the space around Long Chen. This fist was unavoidable. This was not a normal lock. This was the result of a power that had reached a peak and suppressed all other laws.

BOOM!

Long Chen furiously punched back with both fists, resulting in the void beneath him shattering. A tempest of astral winds raged.

This man’s power was incredibly domineering. It was like an angry sea crashing toward him endlessly.

The instant their fists met, Long Chen felt like what he was facing was an entire universe’s power. His bones cracked.

Long Chen was shocked. They had the same Five Star Battle Armor, the same divine ring, the same cultivation base, and the same aura. So why was the difference so great?

“You’re such a disappointment. You can’t even endure half my power. What right do you have to carry on the will of the nine stars? Who could possibly entrust the lives of the ten planar worlds to you?”

The man’s anger grew upon seeing how taxing it was for Long Chen just to block this single attack. The power of his fist grew.

The space beneath Long Chen exploded, and Long Chen’s knees began to bend. This man’s power seemed to be able to suppress an entire universe. Long Chen was actually being forced to kneel.

Long Chen clenched his teeth. A furious will slowly rose within him, fanning the flames of anger. This oppression was a humiliation to him. Even though he felt like his body would explode, Long Chen continued to resist. The anger inside of him accumulated.

BOOM!

Suddenly, Long Chen’s eyes turned black. His body straightened and a violent aura exploded, forcing back the long-haired man.
