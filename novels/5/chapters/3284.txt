Chapter 3273 Vile Dragon Domain

Blood mist exploded where that golden light passed through. They didn’t even see the person before they were killed.

Bai Xiaole and the others stared in confusion, not knowing what was going on. They had no idea that someone had been spying on them while they were eating.

“Amazing. Even without hitting them directly, the shockwaves of the Sword Qi were enough to kill a late stage Divine Lord.” Long Chen raised his thumb.

A giant ditch was left in the ground, which was covered in golden powder. Following this simple slash, the earth’s metal energy was actually drawn out.

No wonder Bai Shishi loved this sword so much. Long Chen was unable to imagine just how terrifying it would be once Bai Shishi was able to unleash its full power.

“Who was that?” asked Bai Shishi. She hadn’t noticed this person at all. She hadn’t sensed anything, but Long Chen had made a cutting motion to her and pointed in that direction.

“Who else could it be? Those sinister fellows from the Bloodkill Hall, they really have some ability. They already found us,” said Long Chen disdainfully.

He had to admit that the Bloodkill Hall had some skill. Long Chen and the others had been traveling in secret and had only revealed their whereabouts when they arrived at the Yuhua Palace. But the Bloodkill Hall had caught up to them so quickly.

They really were like prairie dogs. Their noses were exceptionally sharp.

However, Long Chen wasn’t prey; he was the hunter. When his prey sent themselves to him, he wouldn’t show mercy.

“We’ve been exposed so quickly? Then what about the mission?” asked Bai Shishi, her expression changing slightly.

Long Chen smiled. “Foolish girl, I already revealed my status as the seventh branch academy’s dean in the Yuhua Palace. This is no longer a secret mission.”

“Call me a foolish girl again.”

Bai Shishi glared at him, but she also couldn’t help asking, “Why did you do that? The deputy dean told you that this was an absolutely secret mission. By waving a flag and announcing it to the world, aren’t you allowing the other side to prepare in advance?”

“Tch, they have their plans, and I also have my own plans to deal with them. The academy has been playing chess against Lord Brahma for so many years, and yet there’s been no improvement after all this time. Why would I play using the same style? In this world, not all things should be done after coming up with a plan. If you just act according to your own heart, you’ll be able to react faster. Well, it’s not like I know how to play chess anyway. If I wanted to play against them, I’d be crushed in an instant, no?” said Long Chen.

“Then how are you planning to do this?” asked Bai Shishi.

“We’re going to the Vile Dragon Domain and take a look at the situation,” said Long Chen.

“Just like that?”Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

“Just like that.” Long Chen nodded.

“With no plan at all?!” Bai Shishi’s eyes widened.

“What kind of plan could I have? Do you think that a few of us are capable of completing this mission? You’re too naive!” Long Chen shook his head. He had her summon the flying boat, and they set off once more.

“Long Chen, don’t tell me that you don’t care about this matter at all.” Bai Shishi looked at him seriously.

Bai Shishi knew just how important this matter was to the High Firmament Academy, so Long Chen’s lax attitude made her heart sink. It couldn’t be that Long Chen had simply accepted the position of dean to play around, could it?

Long Chen laughed and looked at Bai Shishi. Her flawless face was so close to him. Enjoying her beauty at such a close distance was a blessing.

Being stared at, Bai Shishi angrily said, “Talk seriously!”

“Your skin is great!” said Long Chen seriously.

“Bastard, I told you to talk seriously! Stop talking nonsense,” said Bai Shishi, so angry that her jade-like face reddened.

“I already told you. I have my own methods. My path is different from most people’s, so if you feel that my methods are wrong, you can leave. I don’t like being questioned all the time, nor am I used to explaining myself to others. Those who approve of me will follow me through water and fire without asking about the future. There are also many others who don’t approve of me. We all walk our own paths, and we shouldn’t disturb each other,” Long Chen spoke indifferently, turning to look out the window.

These words weren’t very polite, but Long Chen also had no way around it. Bai Shishi was stubborn and had her own viewpoints.

She wanted to know what the next step was, what the overall plan was, and what they were doing. Putting it frankly, she was someone used to being in control.

However, Long Chen was always unconstrained, doing whatever he wanted without preparing complicated plans in advance. So, he was getting angry with Bai Shishi for pressing him on this issue.

The heavens had no second sun, and an army had no second leader. There could only be one head commander. If someone didn’t listen to that commander, then sooner or later, it would cause things to collapse.

Bai Shishi was stunned. She hadn’t expected Long Chen to become hostile just over this, so her expression sank.

Seeing this, Bai Xiaole, Qin Feng, and the others hastily ran to another cabin, closing the door to avoid being implicated.

Meanwhile, Long Chen pretended not to see Bai Shishi’s change in expression. He continued staring out the window.

However, he was shocked to find tears dripping down Bai Shishi’s face. This stubborn girl actually had times when she cried.

He then turned to look at Bai Shishi, not knowing what to do. Bai Shishi also didn’t say anything. She turned away, not looking at Long Chen.

Everyone within the flying boat was silent. After a while, Long Chen awkwardly handed her a handkerchief.

Bai Shishi ignored him at first, but after a bit, she reached out and accepted it, blotting her tears.

“In all my years, it’s my first time being driven to tears due to rage at someone,” said Bai Shishi coldly.

“That’s because if it was someone else, you’d have killed them before getting to this point,” said Long Chen, shrugging helplessly.

With just that, Bai Shishi chuckled. But after that, she seemed embarrassed again and turned away.

“You bastard!”

Bai Shishi was vexed and embarrassed, yet also puzzled. She then reached out and pinched the soft flesh at Long Chen’s waist.

“Aiya!”

Long Chen screamed. Qin Feng and the others who were eavesdropping exchanged glances. They didn’t know how to help.

Long Chen looked at his waist. There was a large bruise now. Bai Shishi truly was vicious. She had actually used her metal energy.

Seeing Long Chen look at her, Bai Shishi seemed pleased. It seemed that she had at least vented.

“Alright, alright! You really are alright! I’m not going to quibble with you over this. But this matter has to be clear to you. Since you’ve come with me, there’s no need to bring a brain. Just listen to me. I won’t repeat myself,” said Long Chen angrily.

Bai Shishi didn’t reply, not agreeing or disagreeing. After several days and several transportation formations, their flying boat finally reached the Vile Dragon Domain.

However, they had just entered this domain when they heard furious roars shaking the heavens, startling all of them.
