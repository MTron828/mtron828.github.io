Chapter 2645 The Old Man’s Might

BOOM!

Countless lightning beasts smashed into the wooden shield, blasting it apart. However, Liu Ruyan still managed to block this first charge.

This gave the Dragonblood Legion some precious breathing room. By the time the shield broke, their formation was complete.

“Kill!”

Meng Qi, Chu Yao, Tang Wan-er, Ye Zhiqiu, Cloud, and the others all attacked at once, taking advantage of the moment just as the lightning beasts finished their assault to launch a powerful counterattack.

With everyone joining forces, a stream of light blasted through the lightning beasts. A giant hole was left in the void.

When that hole appeared, Guo Ran was about to give the order for the Dragonblood Legion to charge out, working together with Meng Qi and the others’ attacks to press their advantage, not giving the lightning beasts any chance to recover.

However, just as his orders were about to come out of his mouth, it felt like a blade cut his throat. No sound came out. That was because he saw a giant figure within the giant hole.

That was a giant divine bird. Its eyes were like golden lanterns looking at them through the hole. In that instant, the Dragonblood warriors felt their hearts stop beating. They were locked onto by a terrifying aura.

“What kind of monster is that?!”

The distant experts were all startled by that divine bird. Just looking at it caused their backs to be covered in cold sweats.

They had advanced to the Heaven Merging realm, but this divine bird made them feel as insignificant as ants. This heavenly tribulation was absolutely terrifying, not giving people any chance of surviving. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

“A lightning beast that has reached the level of a demonic king, and one at the Heaven Merging realm at that!” Long Chen jumped. He had killed demonic kings before, so he knew their auras.

However, this demonic king’s aura was even more terrifying than those. Perhaps it should be classified as a Sovereign sprout demonic king.

“Even the Dragonblood Legion’s heavenly tribulation is this terrifying. I can’t even imagine what your tribulation will be like. Of course, I’m not trying to shake your confidence. I just don’t want you to be careless,” said Evilmoon, hastily correcting itself midway.

“I’m not afraid no matter how powerful the heavenly tribulation is. If I don’t have this confidence, how could I be a nine star heir?” said Long Chen indifferently. He had long since gotten used to his heavenly tribulations.

From the Blood Condensation realm, every one of his heavenly tribulations was trying to kill him. But wasn’t he still living happily? Hence, he didn’t feel too much fear toward heavenly tribulation.

However, this lightning bird did make Long Chen a bit worried. If they were unable to block it, he would be forced to interfere. Then his tribulation would also start ahead of schedule, and that wasn’t a good thing.

“Fuck, brothers, help me out! I’ll kill it!”

Guo Ran suddenly shouted and summoned his armor. At this time, he couldn’t bother about absorbing more lightning. As long as he could eliminate this terrifying divine bird, they would have passed this tribulation.

“Dragonblood Cross Slash!”

Guo Ran roared, crossing his blades before him. As endless energy poured into him, a giant cross condensed in front of him. This was the attack containing the full power of all the Dragonblood warriors.

The giant cross cut through the air, and the Heavenly Daos rumbled. All lightning beasts touched by that cross were blasted apart.

This attack containing over twelve thousand Dragonblood warriors’ full power practically had the power to destroy heaven and earth. Even these Sovereign sprout lightning beasts were instantly destroyed.

However, just as the cross was about to strike the divine bird, it suddenly spread its wings. Lightning filled the world. When its body shuddered, an identical copy of it flew out of its body, smashing into the cross.

“What!?”

“What kind of divine ability is that?!”

Guo Ran and the others were startled. At this moment, the giant cross struck the divine bird’s clone, and an explosion unleashed a wave of lightning that shattered the clouds and blinded them.

After that, the wave of lightning crashed down upon the Dragonblood Legion. They were like a small boat on top of its raging waves, being thrown and rocked badly. Right now, intense pain wracked their bodies, as if millions of needles were stabbing them.

“Careful! This lightning is divine lightning!” shouted Long Chen.

The divine bird was composed entirely of pure divine lightning, completely different from the previous lightning beasts. The energy of divine lightning was something extremely painful even to the Dragonblood warriors.

Therefore, Lei Long made its move. It charged into the sea of lightning, wrapping around Meng Qi, Dong Mingyu, Qu Jianying, Li Tianxuan, and the healing warriors.

Their physical bodies were unable to endure a direct strike from divine lightning, so Lei Long’s protection was like a buffer, allowing them to absorb it slower.

Suddenly, the divine bird let out a cry of soundwaves that was crashing through the air. As its wings quivered, it pounced on the Dragonblood Legion, smashing its wing smashed down like a heaven-splitting blade.

BOOM!

In front of the giant wing, the Dragonblood Legion appeared incredibly minute. At the next moment, Guo Ran shouted, and everyone entered the defensive formation.

Their defensive wall had only just formed when it was smashed apart. As a result, the Dragonblood warriors coughed up blood, their insides breaking apart.

With the divine lightning filling the air, the healing warriors were blocked from casting their spells to help. There was no way for them to heal everyone in time.

The divine bird was absolutely terrifying, and they were unable to stop it. This was the first time the Dragonblood Legion encountered such terrifying heavenly tribulation.

Just at this moment, its second attack came, and there was no way for the Dragonblood Legion to block it.

“Brute, do you think you can be so arrogant?!”

The old man suddenly shouted furiously. As his white hair stood on end, a berserk fury soared. It was as if a god of battle had descended, and the Heaven Splitting Blade tore through the heavens.

“Split the Heavens 9!”

The old man’s roar was like thunder ringing through the air. In that instant, the heavens were cut in two, and his saber landed solidly on the divine bird.

BOOM!

As a result, that terrifying divine bird was cut in two, transforming into divine runes that enveloped the Dragonblood Legion.

However, the old man began to vomit blood, so Long Chen hastily came to support him.

“I’m fine. That divine bird was bizarre. It contained another world’s will, and its offensive power was focused on the soul. If you encounter it, you have to be careful,” said the old man. Despite how pale he was, he still appeared awe-inspiring.

Just at this moment, Lei Long suddenly grew until it completely locked down the sea of divine lightning. The heavenly tribulation ended. The divine lightning was starting to fade, just as Lei Long now locked it inside, giving everyone even more time to absorb it. It also swiped some benefits for itself at the same time.

The divine bird was dead, so the divine lightning’s offensive will was wiped out. It went from a berserk beast to a gentle sheep and was easily absorbable.

An incense stick’s worth of time later, the divine lightning finally fully faded, and the Dragonblood warriors’ auras had completely transformed. They had finally entered the Heaven Merging realm, becoming one with heaven and earth.

“Hahaha, success, success! Invaders, you’ll have to kneel between your daddy Guo’s feet from now on! Tremble in fear!” laughed Guo Ran.
