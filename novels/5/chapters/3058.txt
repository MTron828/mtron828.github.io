Chapter 3047 Future Son-In-Law

With Bai Xiaole’s problem resolved, Bai Zhantang and his wife felt a heavy weight fall off their shoulders. However, Bai Xiaole was still in slumber and couldn’t be disturbed. Only when he woke naturally would they know the exact situation.

Hence, Long Chen returned to the Divine Scripture Pavilion. When Bai Xiaole woke up on the third day, the Three Flower Pupils were finally fully manifested within his eyes.

After awakening, Bai Xiaole seemed to have been enlightened. He was constantly forming hand seals and summoning one spatial art after another.

Bai Xiaole asked Luo Bing, Luo Ning, Mu Qingyun, and the others to exchange blows with him. They were shocked to find that after awakening the Three Flower Pupils, Bai Xiaole’s divine abilities were practically heaven-defying. With a single look, space was torn apart. Hence, they hastily called a stop to the fight, afraid that he might accidentally kill them.

Based on Luo Bing’s calculation, when Bai Xiaole fully mastered his eye arts, his combat power might not be much lower than Bai Shishi’s.

After awakening the Three Flower Pupils, Bai Xiaole went on a rampage, challenging everyone to a battle to test out his new abilities. But it wasn’t more than a few days before someone beat him black and blue, and he came crying to Long Chen.

When Long Chen asked him what had happened, he had an urge to slap him. Bai Xiaole really thought that he was unrivaled after awakening the Three Flower Pupils. He actually went to find Bai Zhantang for revenge. As a result, he was given another beating quickly and easily.

Long Chen couldn’t be bothered to deal with that. He had spent these days memorizing everything he could in the Divine Scripture Pavilion. He had a splitting headache and needed to digest this new information.

After two days, his headache diminished and after a few days of calmness, his aura stabilized. After thinking about it, he decided that he should raise his realm again. That way, he could raise his realm and then stabilize it while reading books.

However, on the next day, Bai Xiaole returned to him. He was truly tenacious. After being beaten so badly by his father, he refused to give up and challenged his father again. Of course, the result was just as miserable as the last time.

“Boss, you have to help me get revenge! He’s too arrogant! He said that even if we joined together, we wouldn’t be able to overcome a single finger from him! How can we endure such a thing!” cried out Bai Xiaole.

Long Chen suddenly had a thought. He said, “Go ask your father if he dares to have a fight where he doesn’t use his realm to suppress others, and we all purely use your physical bodies and fighting skills.”

“Alright!” Bai Xiaole was delighted and immediately ran off. He returned just a short moment later.

“Boss, that arrogant fellow said that no matter what kind of method we use, he’ll accept!”

Hearing that, Long Chen was delighted. He had precisely been thinking about a problem that he couldn’t resolve normally. Now it was perfect.

“Let’s go. Ah, wait a moment, I’m changing clothes.”

After two hours, Long Chen and Bai Xiaole returned with battered faces. Long Chen’s chest even had specks of blood on it, and the clothes he had switched into were destroyed.

One of Bai Xiaole’s eyes was swollen shut, and his mouth was deformed. But his chest was sticking up as if he had won.

Seeing the two of them in this state, Luo Bing and the others jumped in shock. Just who was able to beat Long Chen considering how strong he was?

“Boss really is the boss! We ended up in a draw this time. Next time, we’ll definitely have the advantage!” Bai Xiaole cried out excitedly.

When Luo Bing and the others heard their stories, they were shocked. Only then did they learn that the two of them had gone to challenge the master of the Battle God Palace. Two against one, they had still been beaten.

Bai Xiaole really knew how to cause trouble. How did he even get someone as smart as Long Chen drawn into this mess?

That was the master of the Battle God Palace, someone at the peak of the academy. Long Chen and Bai Xiaole had challenged him to a fight? Were they not asking for a beating?

…

“Peh, those two brats.”

Bai Zhantang spat out some blood, cursing. He sat alone at the top of a mountain, which was now a complete mess from their battle.

He had two large lumps on his head, and his lips were split open. Moreover, his nose was still bleeding. His state was just as bad as Long Chen and Bai Xiaole’s.

If the Battle God Palace’s experts were to see this, they definitely wouldn’t believe it. The undefeatable existence in their hearts had actually been turned into this state.

“Hahaha!”

Just at this moment, two beautiful women walked over. They were Bai Xiaole and Bai Shishi’s mothers.

“Our mighty palace master was actually beaten into this state by two babies. That would definitely cause quite a few people to collapse if they learned of it,” laughed Bai Xiaole’s mother.

Bai Zhantang glared at her. “Wasn’t it all your idea? I only ended up like this because I suppressed my cultivation base.”

“Wasn’t this very fair? You cultivate the Heavenly Vajra Unbreaking Body. Even if you suppress your cultivation base, you should be far stronger than two amateurs in the Divine Flame realm,” said Bai Shishi’s mother, also laughing.

“That Long Chen is a monster. His power is immense. But most hateful of all, when he attacks, a trace of his divine flame power leaks out, ruining my defenses. That wasn’t fair at all!” raged Bai Zhantang.

“He’s been rapidly increasing his cultivation base, so he can’t stop his divine flame energy from leaking. It’s the result of a lack of control, not intentional. Didn’t he gradually manage to control it in the end so that it stopped leaking? Don’t get angry. Long Chen helped Bai Xiaole activate his Three Flower Pupils, so you no longer need to use such violent means to store energy in his body. We owe him a huge debt. Long Chen wants to rapidly increase his realm, and by sparring with him, you're helping him consolidate his realm much faster. It can count as returning the favor. Bai Xiaole also needs more combat experience after awakening his eye arts since Long Chen wants to bring him to the Nine Prefecture Convention. Helping him get stronger is helping your son. What, are you not happy about that?” demanded Bai Xiaole’s mother. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

“Of course I’m happy with that. But that bastard Long Chen’s fighting style is completely sinister! It’s completely against the norm. There were several times when I even misjudged his moves. Ah, it really pisses me off,” cursed Bai Zhantang. He had never encountered such a difficult opponent.

Close-range combat was his specialty, but he hadn’t expected to encounter an entirely new fighting style in Long Chen. Adding on Bai Xiaole interfering with his eye arts, Bai Zhantang ended up falling for their tricks several times, infuriating him.

“Ah, if you have to suffer a bit, then just endure it. Why quibble with children? One is your own son, while the other is your future son-in-law,” said Bai Shishi’s mother profoundly.

“What? That bastard dares to have intentions on my daughter?! I’ll kill him!”
