Chapter 4817 Dragonbone Evilmoon’s Meridian

When a head fell to the ground, Yue Zifeng reappeared before everyone.

“Nice job, Zifeng!”

Xia Chen and the others were impressed. During Zhang Benzhi's confrontation with Long Chen, a deadly assassin had been lying in wait to strike at Long Chen. Thankfully, Yue Zifeng had intercepted the assassin.

Failing with his first attack, that assassin immediately turned tail and fled, but Yue Zifeng refused to let him off and pursued him. Now that the battle was over, Yue Zifeng returned triumphantly, bringing the head of the assassin he had slain.

It was truly remarkable for Yue Zifeng to successfully chase down and defeat such a formidable opponent in a one-on-one battle. After all, the assassin's aura had seemed comparable to Zhang Benzhi's, indicating he was a skilled expert, yet he ultimately fell to Yue Zifeng's sword.

Assassins were all skilled at fleeing and hiding; however, they couldn’t flee from Yue Zifeng.

“He was strong. His final counterattack almost took my life,” replied Yue Zifeng.

Yue Zifeng had wanted to quickly slay his enemy, recognizing the urgency of the situation at hand. However, the assassin was exceptionally powerful and even employed a blood sacrifice technique that nearly cost Yue Zifeng his life.

“In any case, it’s good that you’re back.” Long Chen patted Yue Zifeng’s shoulder, knowing that a peerless sword cultivator like Yue Zifeng was normally frighteningly cool. However, his concern for everyone’s safety had caused him to make this risky move. While disturbances like this were a major taboo for sword cultivators, Long Chen and the others’ safety was more important than his own life, so it was only natural that Yue Zifeng couldn’t stay entirely calm.

Moreover, that assassin was extremely frightening. If he wasn’t eliminated, a sneak attack from him during a critical moment could have been fatal for anyone except Yue Zifeng and Long Chen. That was why Yue Zifeng deemed it necessary to kill him.

Long Chen then slammed his foot down, causing some blood to ooze out of the head. Smelling that blood, Long Chen curled his lips. “Another fellow from the Lifehunter race. They really refuse to give up!”

“Boss, we found it!” Just then, a Dragonblood warrior cried out excitedly. Having searched through the wreckage, one of the Dragonblood warriors found something that looked like a stone altar within the rubble.

It was ovular and covered in brown lines, looking like a natural treasure. Hearing this shout, Long Chen hastily rushed over, delighted. This was precisely what Bai Shishi’s mother had told him about.

After that, Long Chen placed the High Firmament Divine Sword’s scabbard onto the stone altar, and the scabbard exploded into motes of light.

“What?!”

Xia Chen and the others were startled. How could the High Firmament Divine Sword’s scabbard explode like that?

“Don’t worry, this isn’t the real scabbard. It's an avatar condensed by the High Firmament Divine Sword, imbued with its aura and will. This avatar can create clones to deceive our enemies. Meanwhile, with enemies attacking from that direction, the dean and others will handle them,” explained Long Chen.

As the stone continued to glow, Long Chen added, “This avatar contains the High Firmament Academy’s karmic luck. By activating this spot, we can tap into the dragon vein's karmic fortune. The dean and the others will arrive swiftly. Hehe, although it was a bit dangerous, we’ve accomplished our mission.”

The stone kept flashing, dispersing the deathly air with a mysterious power, infusing new vitality into the surrounding mountains.

Just then, a roar rang out, and only then did Long Chen recall the devil lord that Bai Shishi had subdued.

Long Chen and the others walked over. While the devil lord was on its last breaths, its appearance was still ferocious.

“This fellow isn’t as strong as I imagined,” said Bai Xiaole curiously.

“It was strong, but it already was injured by the vice palace master. We simply came before it could heal. You know, this kind of devil creature isn’t very intelligent. It immediately launched a counterattack when it sensed a threat and didn’t understand that it needed to heal first,” explained Long Chen, specifically to tell Bai Xiaole not to underestimate this kind of devil creature. Sometimes, their power was beyond imagination.

Bai Zhantang had dealt a serious wound to this devil lord, so it could no longer unleash many of its divine abilities. Hence, Long Chen and the others could slay it with little effort.

When Evilmoon stabbed into its abdomen, the devil lord instantly shrieked and convulsed, seemingly in immense pain.

The next moment, black qi swirled around Evilmoon, and the devil lord rapidly withered until it turned into a desiccated corpse.

“Refreshing,” Evilmoon sighed in satisfaction. It was in a great mood.

Long Chen then tossed the desiccated corpse into the primal chaos space, but he was disappointed. After its essence was absorbed by Evilmoon, the amount of life energy it unleashed wasn’t very impressive.

“Don’t be sad. Absorbing the energy of Heaven Saints lets me activate a sealed meridian within me. Once this meridian is opened, I won’t need to keep doing this,” said Evilmoon.

“Tch, do I seem like such a petty person? Wait... what did you say? A meridian? You have a meridian?” Long Chen was startled. Weapons actually had meridians?

“This meridian is a different concept from what you know. To put it bluntly, I don’t have a complete understanding of this new body of mine either, but I know that it possesses power that neither of us can imagine. Unfortunately, the door to unleashing all that power is locked right now. Its power is like an ocean, and what I can control is only a single channel. By absorbing the power of Heaven Saints and Heaven Saint weapons, I can loosen the seal of that door. It’s somewhat similar to opening a meridian,” explained Evilmoon.

It seemed that Evilmoon was truly amazing. Thinking of this, Long Chen recalled what the Earth Cauldron had said. It asked Evilmoon whether it recognized it? There must be a deeper meaning to it.

“Boss, boss! I found it!” At this moment, Xia Chen’s excited shout rang out, drawing Long Chen’s attention. He hastily rushed over. He then saw Xia Chen standing in a giant hole and holding a palm-sized piece of jade.

Suddenly, the white jade fractured, and a terrifying apocalyptic aura erupted from it, causing Long Chen’s expression to change.

“It’s going to explode!”
