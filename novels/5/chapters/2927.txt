Chapter 2916 Chu Huairen’s Confidence

Within the multicolored divine ring behind Long Chen, his true divine ring revolved. Of the six colors, half went clockwise, and half went counterclockwise. The power within heaven and earth was absorbed into Long Chen’s body.

This was Long Chen’s first time using the divine ring at full power in the immortal world, and he found that it was even easier to use it here than in the mortal world.

His perception then spread as his divine ring revolved. He even saw beyond the formation and everyone in the plaza.

“Could it be that the Nine Star Hegemon Body Art is actually a cultivation technique from the immortal world? Only in the immortal world can it unleash its greatest power?”

A thought flashed through Long Chen’s mind, but his spear was already stabbing toward Chu Kuang.

“Idiot, do you think you’re worth me using my full power?!”

Chu Kuang was shocked by the power of Long Chen’s divine ring, but he was also infuriated by his words. Hence, his saber’s light multiplied, and he slashed it at Long Chen.

BOOM!

The two weapons smashed into each other and unleashed an explosion of divine light. Countless runes flew through the air.

At the same time, the ground beneath their feet crumbled, and the cracks spread for miles. Their weapons continued to clash, and they both glared at each other. As their power rose, the cracks continued to spread.

“Heavens, are they really human?”

“What level of power is that?”

“Are they really the same as us? Are they in the Mortal Transcendence realm? Why is it that I feel like I wouldn’t even be able to get close before being crushed?”

“Did Long Chen know that this would happen? Is that why he pushed Chu Kuang away from the altar?”

People grew more and more shocked. These two were both monsters. How could they be so powerful?

“They’re incredibly powerful. But how is Long Chen so strong?” exclaimed Luo Ning. Chu Kuang was assisted by his armor and weapon, but Long Chen had no such thing. Even his weapon was something he had just acquired from someone else. He was relying entirely on his own power to fight, which was the most shocking thing.

The ground beneath their feet continued to rumble. Eventually, it began to sink, and a giant hole quickly appeared around them.

“Long Chen, I admit that you truly have some power. But you can’t beat me. My power isn’t something that you can imagine,” said Chu Kuang. The power of his saber continued to slowly rise.

However, no matter how much it rose, he was unable to shake Long Chen.

Long Chen stared at him solemnly. “The first time I saw you, I particularly disliked you and wanted to slap you. At first, I thought it was because you were someone powerless acting arrogant or someone so ugly but still prancing around. But later on, I felt that this was the wrong reason. Then I suspected that it was because of the relationship between the Chu family and the Luo family. However, that also seemed off. Today, while fighting you, I find that I am detesting you more and more. I have a feeling that the answer will soon be revealed.”

“You’ll pay a painful price for your ignorance.” Chu Kuang sneered. His saber’s runes suddenly blazed with light, and his power instantly rose close to thirty percent. As a result, Long Chen’s spear was pushed back, and the saber approached Long Chen’s neck.

Even so, Long Chen didn’t reveal any hint of astonishment in his expression. Just as his spear was being pushed back, his left hand became covered in white dragon scales and slapped Chu Kuang’s in his sneering face.

BOOM!

Because Chu Kuang hadn’t expected Long Chen to suddenly launch an attack with his left hand, his body was smashed through the earth until he was embedded into a mountain. As a result, this large mountain shuddered, became covered in cracks, and then collapsed.

The spectators were all dumbfounded. Just what kind of monster was Long Chen? According to reason, while fighting Chu Kuang who was using his full power, he shouldn’t have the power to attack with his other hand. But he had still done so. The only way this was possible was if he wasn’t using his full power to stop Chu Kuang’s saber.

Even all that wasn’t his full power? Then Long Chen definitely wasn’t human. He was a demon.

Originally, many people were angered by Chu Kuang’s flagrant cheating and the Chu family’s magistrate’s words. They also felt some sympathy for the weaker side, so they cheered for Long Chen to win. But upon seeing this power, they were dumbfounded. Just who exactly was the weaker side? Just who was acting like a pig to eat the tiger? Just who were they supposed to sympathize with?

“This aura… it seems to be the dragon race’s energy. As expected, it’s not the power of a human.” The head judge’s eyes flickered with light as he looked at Long Chen. He was one of the very few people to spot the dragon scales that had appeared on Long Chen’s palm.

He had previously judged that Long Chen’s power was not the power of a human. However, he hadn’t been able to tell just what kind of power it was. But this slap revealed Long Chen’s dragon scales and aura, allowing the head judge to guess.

Right now, the disciples stared at the giant ditch as well as the broken mountain. They were deathly silent.

Even the other magistrate’s expressions changed, but Chu Huairen remained calm. He confidently said, “It’s fine. The young master has plenty of trump cards. He’s still evaluating Long Chen to see just how many of them he should use. After all, it is the competition for the family head position that is truly important. Exposing too much here is meaningless. In the High Firmament Academy, no one in the outer academy is a match for him.” Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

Chu Huairen then looked at the head judge, and he saw that the head judge was also looking at him. Both of them smiled, but each person’s smile contained different implications.

BOOM!

The collapsed mountain exploded. And from within the swirling dust and flying rubble, Chu Kuang walked out.

When all of them saw Chu Kuang, they couldn’t help being shocked. After receiving such a powerful attack, someone else would have died a hundred times. But Chu Kuang was still fine.

“Long Chen, you’ve really pissed me off. Have a taste of my fury!”

Chu Kuang’s hair was a bit messy from walking out of the rubble, but his gaze contained a frightening light, as well as endless killing intent. He suddenly raised his head and roared. After that, four balls of light appeared behind his back.

When that light appeared, Luo Bing and Luo Ning both turned pale. They shot out of their seats.

“Impossible!”
