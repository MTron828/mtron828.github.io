Chapter 4173: Palace Master’s Divine Might

Long Chen’s order scared Bai Shishi and the others. Kill them all? How could they do that?

Only Qing Feng and Qi Yu immediately placed their hands on their swords to follow his order.

“How brazen! I want to see just who dares to try!”

Just then, over ten innate Heaven Venerate elders appeared, and their pressures instantly crashed down on everyone. People didn’t dare to even move in front of them.

However, the appearance of these Heaven Venerates didn’t rattle Long Chen in the slightest. Everything was within his expectations. Without the tacit approval of these old fellows, the young fellows wouldn’t have dared to be so arrogant.

Qing Feng and Qi Yu still had their hands on their swords, looking at Long Chen. If Long Chen gave them so much as a single look, they would directly attack. Even if they couldn’t beat the innate Heaven Venerates, slaughtering the Immortal Kings here would be no problem.

Long Chen simply smiled at those innate Heaven Venerates. He then clasped his hands behind him and stepped forward.

“How brazen? The brazen ones should be you, no? You want to see who dares to try?” Long Chen walked straight over to one of those elders. He was the one who had just spoken.

“Who are you? You aren’t qualified to speak to me. Call out your dean,” barked the elder after eyeing Long Chen.

Long Chen’s response was a slap. He was neither fast nor slow, so people clearly saw the slap perfectly strike the elder’s face.

The onlookers saw that this calm slap was something that even an ordinary Immortal King could easily block. But that innate Heaven Venerate was easily struck, leaving the onlookers dumbfounded.

Only those familiar with Long Chen smiled excitedly. This slap was something that no one within five steps of him could possibly dodge. It was practically a heaven-defying divine ability.

This slap didn’t cause much damage, but the humiliation factor was its strong point. Even an innate Heaven Venerate was unable to sense it when Long Chen attacked. By the time that he reacted, he was already struck.

“You little brute, you’re courting death!”

That innate Heaven Venerate roared furiously. Long Chen hadn’t used any power in this slap. To put it frankly, he was simply humiliating the Heaven Venerate.

Following that roar, everyone’s vision seemed to flicker for a moment. In just a second, Long Chen had slapped him in the face once again.

This time, Long Chen had used his power behind it, and it could be seen from the appearance of the golden dragon scales on his palm.

As a result, the sound of bones breaking rang out. Half of the elder’s face collapsed, and he shot back like a shooting star.

When he smashed into a nearby stone tablet, the tablet was fine, but blood sprayed out of the elder’s mouth.

Among the blood, people could see his teeth roll away.

“An old fart who refuses to die always lives crookedly. I suppose this expression is referring to you. Just say the word, and I’ll send you to the underworld. If you don’t keep your mouth clean, tomorrow will be your funeral,” said Long Chen darkly, his killing intent not concealed at all.

“You brute! I’ll go all-out against you!”

This elder seemed to have gone insane. As he had never suffered such humiliation in this lifetime, he no longer cared about some curse. With a roar, the might of an innate Heaven Venerate burst forth.

“No!”

Startled cries rang out. If he were really to attack Long Chen, that would be instantly sensed by the Heavenly Daos. Even if Long Chen died, he would not survive either.

“Today, he must die!”

The elder had gone insane. He felt like if he didn’t kill Long Chen, he would die of rage.

In the blink of an eye, the space before the elder contorted and warped, revealing a giant claw shrouded in black scale that smashed toward the elder with a heaven-shaking aura.

Upon seeing this scene, that elder’s expression completely changed. He actually didn’t dare to receive that claw and suddenly vanished.

To everyone’s surprise, when the elder vanished, the black claw vanished alongside him. In the following instant, the space in the distance exploded, and the sinister black claw reemerged, stained with blood.

For a moment, people were simply stunned. That elder had fled at the first instant but still couldn’t dodge this claw.

When the claw loosened its grip, the elder was gone, and an item clattered to the ground. That was the elder’s weapon.

Everything unfolded so fast that even innate Heaven Venerates couldn’t react to it. The elder, tragically, didn't even have the chance to draw his weapon before being slain, leaving his companions in a state of panic.

“As expected of the dragon race’s divine abilities. It is similar to the Cloud Dragon Immolation Claw, but his technique seems light and easy. He can unleash it without preparation, catching the other side off-guard. But for me, it’s much more taxing. Ugh, as expected, the dragon race’s divine abilities are more suited to the dragon race,” sighed Long Chen inside.

He knew that the palace master was the one behind this attack. Furthermore, it was done through space. Just as Dean Bai Letian had said, this palace master didn’t like talking, but he was a ruthless character. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

The palace master didn’t even need to appear. Through space, he could instantly obliterate an innate Heaven Venerate, shocking Long Chen. He couldn’t help but sigh. The dragon race was truly powerful.

“Now do you know who is more brazen?” Seeing everyone’s shocked appearance, Long Chen coldly snorted.

All those innate Heaven Venerates’ expressions were ugly. None of them had expected the High Firmament Academy to be concealing such a terrifying expert.

“Let us not beat around the bush. Your petty thoughts are nothing more than the thoughts of children in front of me. You intentionally had the demonic beast race sneak their way in to fan the flames and force the High Firmament Academy to do what you wanted. If they were exposed, you would blame those scapegoats, and the academy wouldn’t be able to punish you for it, am I right?” sneered Long Chen.

Hearing that, the academy’s experts were enraged. These fellows were so treacherous, so despicable.

“Many of you don’t know me, so I’ll introduce myself. I am Long Chen. I am currently in charge of this place. In other words, whatever I say counts,” said Long Chen lightly.

Upon disclosing his name, a noticeable commotion stirred among the experts, indicating that they were undoubtedly familiar with him and his reputation.

Long Chen’s gaze swept over them. “There’s no need to bring up your excuses. The nonsense about how the High Firmament Academy is partly yours? What dogshit! When the High Firmament Academy was in its worst state, it took the efforts of many generations of our people to restore it. As for your ancestors, they only came to join after they saw the High Firmament Academy shine again. Our ancestors did promise that the academy’s wisdom would be shared with everyone within the nine heavens and ten lands, but that only refers to people who sincerely wish to learn. It doesn’t include a bunch of killers with ulterior motives who throw the peace of the world into chaos. As for the ancestral teachings, I’m in charge of this place, and the rules are set by me. Even if I go against the ancestral teachings, I will bear the responsibility myself. So, you can scram. All those who caused a ruckus with you can scram away as well. You have lost your right to be here.”

Upon hearing this, those experts’ expressions changed. Long Chen was kicking them out, not even allowing them to stay in the outer area.

“Long Chen, come out and face your death!”

Just then, from outside the High Firmament Academy’s territory, a furious roar rang out and lightning thundered. After that, the air of heavenly punishment covered this land.
