Chapter 4703 Divine Venerate Pills

Long Chen returned to the academy to gather some more medicinal ingredients. Although he had plenty of medicinal ingredients, the Divine Venerate Pill was a special pill with more than just one pill formula.

Long Chen knew thirty-seven different pill formulas for it, and these pills had different qualities based on their formulas. When the right pill was used by a person with the right constitution, it would unleash an amazing effect. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

Most of the marketplace’s Divine Venerate Pills were all-purpose pills that could be consumed by anyone. They were very safe. However, their effect was minimal when used by someone with a special constitution.

Still, these one-size-fits-all pills were comparatively cheaper, and as a result, the majority of cultivators chose to use them. Only some heavenly geniuses with thick purses would buy specific Divine Venerate Pills that matched them the best.

As for Long Chen, he could farm his own medicinal ingredients and refine his own pills. Other than time, there was almost no cost to him, so he would make sure his brothers got the best pills for themselves.

To his surprise, the Earth Cauldron knew over seventy formulas for the Divine Venerate Pill. Some of the ingredients in those formulas weren’t in Long Chen’s hands, so he took a trip to the academy’s treasury. With many new medicinal ingredients being registered and stored, it was easy to find them.

It went without saying that the Huayun Trading Company’s efficiency was amazing. When they learned that there weren’t enough master appraisers here, they directly sent hundreds of reinforcements, quickly dealing with the appraisal line.

After finishing here, the Huayun Trading Company’s appraisers didn’t even have time to drink any water before rushing over again. They were extremely busy because many other disciples throughout the world had found treasures within the passageway to the ninth heaven.

In this world, only the Huayun Trading Company’s reputation remained untouched, so these people only dared to do business with them. On the other hand, the likes of the Soaring Dragon Company saw their reputation plummet after Long Chen exposed the matter of them sacrificing people. Moreover, Long Chen's counterfeit Heaven Earth Cauldron scam further ridiculed them, making them objects of mockery.

The repercussions extended beyond the Soaring Dragon Company; other trading companies associated with them also suffered, and now they were essentially ignored. This should have been their best opportunity to get rich, but everyone only ran to the Huayun Trading Company to appraise and trade their treasures.

Some of the more powerful sects, due to having so many disciples or having found too many treasures, did the same as the Long Chen and asked for the Huayun Trading Company to come help.

After finishing the appraisal, the Huayun Trading Company only took a small appraisal fee. They never forced a trade, nor did they ever expose what treasures their client had found. Not even the Huayun Trading Company’s headquarters could inquire about them.

In the treasury, Long Chen found over thirty useful medicinal ingredients that he didn’t have. Adding on the ones he had in the primal chaos space, he could now refine forty-eight different Divine Venerate Pills.

The Earth Cauldron told Long Chen that he needed to gather so many different ingredients because he had to consume so many pills. If he were to only eat one type of pill, he would quickly build up a resistance to it, causing its effect to gradually diminish over time.

By consuming different kinds of Divine Venerate Pills, he could make sure to get the most out of every pill.

Consuming pills was just like eating a meal, and the medicinal resistance could be likened to eating the same meal three times a day, every day; it wouldn’t be long before everyone grew sick of it. But by varying the pills consumed, the user could avoid getting tired of eating the same thing over and over again. After all, this so-called medicinal resistance was the result of the body’s rejection.

“Are you prepared?”

They arrived atop a mountain where immortal mist swirled around. The Earth Cauldron grew to the size of three meters, its runes illuminated and shrouded the world in its sacred light. The Earth Cauldron was completely different from how it had been when Long Chen first found it. Its aura was now stronger.

As its aura suffused into the surroundings, the vegetation on the mountain started to rapidly flourish. The entire space was affected by the Earth Cauldron, thrumming with vitality.

“I’m ready.”

Long Chen nodded. With all the medicinal ingredients in the primal chaos space, he practically had a limitless supply.

“I’m talking about your attitude. You’ve entered the Divine Venerate realm, so this is going to be different from before. We’re going to increase the efficiency,” explained the Earth Cauldron.

“Are you saying...?” Long Chen instantly understood, knowing why the Earth Cauldron had expanded.

“Yes. I need the process, and you need the results. Time is extremely valuable to both of us, so the more we can refine, the better. But of course, that will come at an immense exhaustion from you,” replied the Earth Cauldron.

“Alright.” At first, Long Chen had thought that with his new power, refining pills with the Earth Cauldron would be easy. Now, he realized that he had been thinking too simply.

The Earth Cauldron said, “Then let’s start. First up is the Beautiful Silk Divine Venerate Pill. Get nine hundred and ninety-nine portions of it. Then came the Beautiful Silk Tulip, Bamboo Dragon Grass, Violet Heart Root...”

Upon hearing that it wanted nine hundred and ninety-nine portions at once, Long Chen jumped in fright. The Earth Cauldron wanted him to refine that many? He had never done such a thing.

“Senior, shouldn’t we take things step by step? I’m not sure if I can fully control that much.”

Long Chen had absolute confidence in his Spiritual Strength, but he also had experience when it came to refining many pills at once.

“No need. Refining pills is like fighting on a battlefield. Experience needs to be accumulated through actual combat. What difference is there in fighting one person and fighting nine hundred and ninety-nine people of the same level?” asked the Earth Cauldron.

“Well, if I can beat one, I can beat nine hundred and ninety-nine of them. Of course, that’s as long as they aren’t like the Dragonblood Legion, capable of gathering their power together,” answered Long Chen.

“Exactly. These medicinal pills don’t know tactics. Refining one pill isn’t too different from refining nine hundred and ninety-nine pills. As long as you can control them, with your Spiritual Strength, it shouldn’t be anything difficult. Let us start!” declared the Earth Cauldron.

“Alright.”

As Long Chen prepared himself, Huo Linger stood beside him. While working together with Long Chen, she also needed to study the technique.

Flames rose in Long Chen’s hand and slowly entered the Earth Cauldron, causing the Earth Cauldron’s runes to flash according to a set rhythm. The Earth Cauldron had tens of thousands of runes on it. When the one-hundred-and-eighth rune lit up, the entire cauldron reddened, filling the sky with divine radiance.

Even though this divine radiance was shining brightly, the temperature didn’t soar. It was extremely gentle, like sunlight nourishing the land.

Just then, Long Chen used his Spiritual Strength to send the medicinal ingredients into the Earth Cauldron according to the order it wanted.

These medicinal ingredients instantly turned into liquid, and the liquid quickly turned into powder. The powders piled up as more medicinal ingredients entered, until the final ingredient entered. But then, all the powders exploded like an ignited volcano.

Just as they erupted, the Earth Cauldron’s lid closed, sealing them inside.
