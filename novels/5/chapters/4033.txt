Chapter 4022 Fighting a Three-Flower Earth Venerate

The Blue Flame Voracious Wolf was a flame divine beast of the immemorial era. Although its reputation was not as magnificent as the Vermilion Bird, it was still a well-known existence.

When its head broke free from the ground, lifting the entire city into the air, the wolf's mouth revealed fangs stretching for miles, and its two eyes resembled blazing suns, radiating a scorching and fearsome aura.

Its roar in particular seemed like it could tear apart people’s souls. Fortunately, everyone had experienced the Vermilion Bird’s trial by fire and was able to endure this pressure. Otherwise, just this roar would have been enough to shatter their Yuan Spirits.

“Great Voracious Wolf Ancestor, these invaders possess the inheritance flame of the Vermilion Bird! They are your sacrifice! Enjoy them!” shouted Lan Tianba.

This Blue Flame Voracious Wolf was the Blue Flame Empire’s faith divine beast. During this time, they had offered it countless offerings in preparation to awaken it. Unexpectedly, it was forcibly woken up by Long Chen.

If the offerings they gave to awaken it didn’t meet its requirements, it would be infuriated and devour countless lifeforms as compensation. Thus, the Blue Flame Empire didn’t dare to awaken it for nothing.

So, now that it was forcibly woken, it roared furiously. Lan Tianba’s shout then locked its attention onto Long Chen and the others. Now, eating them was the only way to placate its fury.

As expected, when it looked at Long Chen and the others, flames burst out of its eyes, and its killing intent erupted.

With another furious roar, the earth was torn asunder, and its giant body came out of it.

Its body was almost the same size as the entire capital. The moment it showed up, a violent pressure caused the world to quiver, and faint cracks appeared within heaven and earth, as if the very world was being torn apart.

Zhu Yunwen and the others were shaken. They had never imagined that one day they would be fighting an immemorial divine beast that could reach the level of being a faith totem.Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

“Imperial disciples, activate a barrier! Seal this place! Do not permit anyone to run or transmit any news. Yunwen, Yifeng, Qingxuan, Qianxue, all princes and princesses, summon the Vermilion Bird manifestation. You will face Lan Tianba,” shouted Long Chen.

“What about the Blue Flame Voracious Wolf?” asked Yu Qianxue hastily.

“It’s mine. Get to work!” Long Chen shot toward the Blue Flame Voracious wolf just like that.

Seeing Long Chen move, the others also got to work. As eight hundred thousand imperial disciples joined forces, summoning their manifestations, their figures merged into one enormous immemorial Vermilion Bird. It soared above the nine heavens and formed a barrier around the capital city.

Within the Vermilion Bird’s trial by fire, they had learned how to combine their manifestations. Now, they could show it off.

“Kill!”

Zhu Yunwen, Yu Qianxue, Zhu Yifeng, Yu Qingxuan, and the others unleashed their manifestations. Flames exploded as they attacked Lan Tianba.

If it was before, they would have been full of reverence for this three-flower Earth Venerate. But one kick and slap from Long Chen had blasted away that reverence.

In their hearts, three-flower Earth Venerates were now just humans. If Long Chen could slap them, then they couldn’t be that terrifying.

“Qingxuan, Vermilion Bird Cries at the Ten Thousand Daos!”

Zhu Yunwen suddenly shouted, and Yu Qingxuan shot toward the front of their formation. The next moment, her hand made a sword seal, and her sword whistled down, unleashing a rainbow arc. After going through the trial, Yu Qingxuan’s Heavenly Rainbow Flame was finally starting to awaken. When she unleashed her full power, her sword looked as if it could cut down the very stars.

As for Zhu Yunwen, Yu Qianxue, Zhu Yifeng, and the others, they also attacked at the same time. Flame energy merged into Yu Qingxuan’s sword.

With Yu Qingxuan as the main attacker, she combined the power of over twenty people, directly attacking Lan Tianba.

Seeing this, Lan Tianba hadn’t expected them to be so skilled in combination arts. He suddenly realized that he, a grand three-flower Earth Venerate, was actually locked down by Yu Qingxuan.

What he didn’t know was that he wasn’t really locked down by Yu Qingxuan, but by the Heavenly Rainbow Flame. The Heavenly Rainbow Flame didn’t care what level the opponent was. Once you were locked down, there was no escaping it.

“Ignorant juniors, face your deaths!” Lan Tianba roared furiously, and a flame saber appeared in his hand. Brilliant blue divine radiance then emanated from the weapon, filling the surroundings with an otherworldly glow.

With an overwhelming display of power, Lan Tianba swung his saber down with astonishing force, ripping through the very fabric of the heavens.

BOOM!

Both their attacks clashed—the full power of a three-flower Earth Venerate met the combined force of over twenty heavenly geniuses of the current era, causing flames to explode into the heavens.

As a result, other than Yu Qingxuan, everyone else coughed up blood. The power of a three-flower Earth Venerate was unimaginably terrifying. 

Fortunately, they had learned how to share the pressure within the Vermilion Bird’s trial by fire. So, although they were injured, it wasn’t fatal.

The other good thing was that Lan Tianba also coughed up blood. Clearly, even a three-flower Earth Venerate was unable to block their full power.

This fact invigorated them. Being able to rival a three-flower Earth Venerate, just how prestigious was such a claim?

“Die!”

Lan Tianba was shocked and enraged at being injured, so he shot toward them like a bolt of lightning. Seeing that their combination attack was a real threat to him, he took advantage while they were injured to press the attack, giving them no breathing room.

“Heavenly Rainbow Killing Blow!”

However, just as he moved, Yu Qingxuan became one with her sword, shooting out like a loose arrow. She was so fast that by the time he reacted, her sword was already pressed against his throat.

BOOM!

Lan Tianba was sent staggering back, while Yu Qingxuan was forced back a hundred miles before being able to stabilize herself. Now, an unhealthy rosiness appeared on her cheeks. After all, the attack of a three-flower Earth Venerate was not so easy to receive.

Even if Lan Tianba was injured and didn’t have time to accumulate power, just half of his full-power attack was already enough to injure her and shake her spiritual qi.

“Die!” Seeing Yu Qingxuan injured, Lan Tianba shot after her. This was his best time to attack.

“You can die instead!” Just then, Zhu Yifeng’s sword slashed down. Following him were Yu Qianxue and the others.

“You…!”

What infuriated Lan Tianba was that this attack was precisely Yu Qingxuan’s previous attack, but this one had all their power merged into it.

BOOM!

Lan Tianba was sent flying and hacking up blood. As for Zhu Yunwen and the others, they also coughed up blood, but they grew increasingly excited.

Inside their minds, they were roaring with excitement. They could now fight three-flower Earth Venerates head-on, so who dared to look down on them now?

Just then, the recovered Yu Qingxuan unleashed a tempest of attacks, giving Lan Tianba no chance to recover.

As a result, Lan Tianba was repeatedly injured. It was like he was drowning, and they were doing their best to keep his head underwater, giving him no chance to breathe. As long as he had no chance to recover, he would stay in a weakened state.

It was not easy for him to finally force away Yu Qingxuan, but then Zhu Yifeng and the others attacked, keeping him pinned down. 

Blocking Zhu Yifeng’s attack further injured him, and then Yu Qianxue took his spot to attack Lan Tianba again.

Yu Qingxuan was in charge of disturbing him, while everyone else joined forces to attack him, leaving him with no room to retaliate. Finally, Lan Tianba grew afraid as he knew that he was entrapped. If he had no chance to recover, he would eventually die.

“Great Voracious Wolf, you…!”

Lan Tianba shouted for aid from the Blue Flame Voracious Wolf, as the others were already slain by the imperial disciples.

However, halfway through his shout, he was shocked to find that the Blue Flame Voracious Wolf was covered in flames.

“Raging Flame Prison!”

Long Chen’s voice rang out. Following that, a sacred chanting sound resounded throughout heaven and earth.
