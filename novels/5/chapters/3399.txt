Chapter 3388 Brothers

Long Chen eyed the group of large men with long hair that just walked in. They all shared one thing in common: they were exceptionally thick. Their arms were almost as thick as Long Chen’s waist, and their Blood Qi was so powerful it was like it was about to explode.

They gave Long Chen a sense of immense pressure. Although it wasn’t the aura of World Kings, they were definitely stronger than ordinary Heaven tier Immortal Kings. Most likely, they were half a step into the World King level.

Long Chen nodded at these men. His brother truly had many powerful subordinates. Any one of them was an exceptional expert.

Seeing Long Chen nodding, Wu Tian laughed and patted his shoulder. He happily said, “Brother, your vision is good. These are all the elite women I’ve picked out. They aren’t just peerlessly beautiful, but their talent is also amazing. They have limitless potential. I was going to pick one of them as my imperial consort, but since you’ve taken a liking to them, just tell me. I’ll let you pick from them. If you want them all, you can also take them away.”

“Beau…ties…?”

Long Chen’s eyes almost popped out of their sockets. These long-haired, muscular men in his eyes were actually women!

Looking more carefully, they did seem to have some feminine traits. But it was very unclear.

They were almost twice as tall as Long Chen was, and their expressions weren’t very natural. They clearly looked down on this little fellow before them. In their eyes, Long Chen was far too weak.

Clearly, Wu Tian possessed absolute authority, and no one dared to go against his will. But there was no way that their inner fluctuations could escape Long Chen’s senses.

“Brother, no need to rush. Pick carefully,” said Wu Tian generously.

Long Chen almost wept. That wasn’t from emotion but fear. His scalp turned numb. “Big brother, you really are my big brother. Let’s discuss this later…”

“Eh? Are you trying to be courteous with your big brother?” Wu Tian’s expression sank. He thought that Long Chen was simply being courteous. In his view, these beauties with limitless potential were priceless treasures. Allowing Long Chen to pick them proved just how sincere his brotherly feelings were toward Long Chen.

“Brother, as brothers, there’s no need for me to be courteous, right? The main thing is that our taste in beauties is different. I really can’t accept it. Spare your little brother,” said Long Chen, practically begging. He was very moved by Wu Tian’s favor, but this was definitely impossible to accept.

“You prefer those with no meat on their bodies?” asked Wu Tian in surprise.Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

“Uh, not exactly. I just have a different sense of aesthetics. If I find someone that I like, there’s no need for you to offer them to me. I’ll win them myself,” said Long Chen.

“Alright then.”

Since Long Chen didn’t like these beauties, Wu Tian could only drop it. He waved those beauties away. They sighed with relief as they left. Long Chen himself also sighed. That had truly been frightening.

“Brother, my people have reported your matters to me. Your relationship with those two sisters of the Nethergod race is important, yes? Why not have them come to my city? Here, their cultivation speeds will soar,” said Wu Tian. Naturally, he was referring to Leng Yueyan and Ming Cangyue.

Considering their positions, they naturally didn’t enter his eyes. That was why he wanted to find Long Chen better partners. But if Long Chen didn’t like his beauties, he wouldn’t force it. He could help him through other means.

“No need. They are very proud. Let alone you, they don’t even want my help. They have said that they wish to rely on themselves,” said Long Chen.

Long Chen also didn’t want to bring the two of them here. Wu Tian had just escaped the Netherpassage world and was preparing for revenge. His foundation was still not stable, and there were too many unknown factors. Ming Cangyue herself had warned Long Chen not to join Wu Tian’s side precisely due to this.

If he said the truth, it would be hurtful, so he made up an excuse.

“That’s fine. The Nethergod race has the innate ability to control the laws of the Netherworld. They are a race chosen by the heavens. There’s really no need for others to help them,” said Wu Tian, nodding.

After thinking about it, Wu Tian spoke with a rather vexed tone, “Brother, you don’t want anything I’m offering. You’re making things hard on your big brother. Why is it so difficult for you to accept my gift? Hmm, why don’t you consider those beauties? Their constitutions are special. You can even bring them to the immortal world to cultivate. In the worst case, they could simply be your guards.”

Long Chen had helped him out. Although the two could already be considered brothers, it still felt as if he hadn’t given Long Chen anything, leaving him with no face.

Long Chen quickly said, “Brother, you’re too courteous. Don’t mention this matter again. I can’t accept your gifts.”

“But the divine weapons of the Netherworld will be affected by the laws of the immortal world if they are brought there. You can’t use them. You could cultivate some of our techniques, but once you return to the immortal world, those techniques would no longer have the support of the laws of the Netherworld, making them worthless…”

Long Chen had a thought. “Brother, do you have some beast corpses? I truly desire them.”

“What would you want such a thing for?” asked Wu Tian.

“Ah… In any case, I really need them. If it’s convenient for you, help me gather some!” There was no way Long Chen could mention the primal chaos space. But he also didn’t want to lie. He simply avoided the question.

“That is no problem. We are currently tidying up some Underworld races, and many battlefields have yet to be cleaned up. I’ll have someone bring them to you,” said Wu Tian.

“Many thanks, big brother! Those things are extremely important to me. Come, big brother, let me offer you a bowl as well!” Long Chen directly drank all the wine in his bowl.

Seeing how happy Long Chen was, Wu Tian was also happy. Although he didn’t know why Long Chen wanted corpses, he felt much more comfortable knowing that he could help Long Chen.

Wu Tian asked Long Chen some questions about the immortal world. Long Chen replied simply about the matter with himself and Lord Brahma. Wu Tian frowned slightly.

“I have heard of Lord Brahma. It is rumored that the battle of the nine heavens was related to him. But I was still young at that time. I wasn’t qualified to participate in the affairs of my race yet, so I’m not clear on the details of that battle. He has lived for countless years. I remember that back then, he had won the title of Divine Venerate, becoming a famous existence within all the nine heavens and ten lands. So many years have gone by since then. Perhaps he has stepped into higher realms. You must be careful of him,” warned Wu Tian.

Wu Tian was also an existence that had lived for countless years. However, he was still classified as Brahma’s junior.

Long Chen was shocked. He hadn’t expected Lord Brahma to have such fame. Could it really be that he had stepped into higher realms?

“Brother, are you sure that you wish to be enemies with him?” Wu Tian looked at Long Chen seriously.
