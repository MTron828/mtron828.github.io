Chapter 2794 Dragonbone Evilmoon’s Pride

The middle-aged man, unable to defeat Long Chen, had actually come up with such a contemptuous play to force Long Chen to defend passively.

Suddenly, the land shuddered. Long Chen’s barrier of astral energy quivered. Everyone inside of his barrier was sent to the core. The Martial Heaven Continent was protecting everyone so that Long Chen didn’t need to split his attention.

“Long Chen, go kill him quickly! I will use my final power to protect everyone else.” The Martial Heaven Continent’s voice rang out in his mind.

“But then you…” Long Chen’s heart turned cold.

“There are no buts. If you don’t kill him, we will all be killed.”

The Martial Heaven Continent shuddered. A translucent bead appeared. This bead was filled with life energy. It was the core of the star-field, the heart of this world.

The core rapidly expanded until it covered everyone. This was the final energy of the Martial Heaven Continent.

The middle-aged man’s attacks were repelled by it. It was sacrificing its own life to give Long Chen time to kill him. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

Long Chen no longer hesitated. He charged towards the middle-aged man. He was about to unleash a punch when Evilmoon suddenly appeared in his hand.

“Evilmoon, you…!”

“Long Chen, if you have any respect for me, you will continue to treat me as your companion. Let us fight alongside each other again,” said Evilmoon. “Your power has already started to fall. You can’t last much longer. You will enter a weak state soon, and then you could be slaughtered by anyone. Long Chen… to have met you is my life’s greatest blessing. You showed me how important comrades are. You taught me that there are things in this world that are more important than your own life. You showed me what true happiness is. What it means to protect something. I can no longer hate Yun Shang. My life of devouring and killing was like going through the motions of life as a walking corpse. After meeting you, my view of the world has changed. I saw beautiful things from within endless shadows. Long Chen, I am a warrior of the dark evil dragon race. I have my own pride. I hope you can allow me to fight alongside you again.”

Evilmoon’s two dragon marks lit up. A two-headed black dragon appeared within Long Chen’s divine ring. His acupuncture points shuddered as Evilmoon’s power passed through his body.

“Evilmoon…” Long Chen tightly clenched his blade.

“Long Chen, dying in battle is my glory. Waiting on death is a humiliation.”

Long Chen clenched his teeth. He raised Evilmoon. His eyes were scarlet.

A giant saber-image tore into the cosmos.This was a blade that would sever the nine heavens, break the nine underworlds. It was a blade that made gods and devils quiver.

The middle-aged man froze, unable to move. All the divine energy in his body became stagnant.

“Split the Heavens 9!”

Long Chen howled and slashed his saber down. At the same time, two hot streams of tears flowed down as well.

BOOM!

The middle-aged man took out multiple immortal items, unleashing all his power, but was wiped out of existence along with his immortal items. This was a saber that left a giant tear in space that didn’t heal.

Cracking sounds rang out as the original cracks on Evilmoon grew.

“Long Chen, thank you. That attack really was marvelous. It’s definitely the proudest attack of my lifetime. Goodbye. If there is another life, I’d like to keep fighting alongside you.” Evilmoon’s voice rang out one final time before it dissipated.

Long Chen slowly opened his hand. Even the saber hilt transformed to dust and blew away. Long Chen could only watch as it blew away.

It was said that the dragon race has spirits. When they died, they would reincarnate into dragons once more. But which race of dragon would be undetermined.

Within the primal chaos space, Ling-er and the Heaven Flipping Seal wept. Evilmoon was gone.

The Martial Heaven Continent’s people let out a burst of cheers, but then the barrier around them faded. Their joy faded along with it. Instead, they were filled with grief.

Once the barrier was gone, they sensed that the vitality of the entire world was gone as well. Even the commoners could sense it. This world had died.

The Martial Heaven Continent had sacrificed all its power to protect them. It was like a mother protecting her children with her own life.

Countless people began weeping. The Martial Heaven Continent had sacrificed itself for them. They thought back to what they had done to the continent. Their limitless greed had constantly damaged the continent, causing it to weaken. They had dug their own graves. But the Martial Heaven Continent never blamed them. It continued to protect them even as they destroyed its body.

People sank into grief and sorrow. Although they were alive, they had lost their home.

Far too many heroes had died in this battle. Even the Dragonblood Legion had lost over nine thousand people. Although they had won, the Dragonblood warriors didn’t feel any joy.

Every single warrior of the Dragonblood Legion was as close as a brother. They would rather die to protect the ones beside them than have others die. The ones who had died were dead. But the ones who were alive had to endure more pain.

They wished that this was a nightmare that someone would wake them up from. They wished they could wake up and see their fallen brothers laughing once more.

Meng Qi, Chu Yao, Ye Zhiqiu, and the others silently sobbed. The price of this battle was too great. It was unimaginable.

They looked at Long Chen. Long Chen was looking at his hand. That sinister blade of his had forever vanished.

The Martial Heaven Continent was broken. They couldn’t see the slightest greenery, the slightest life. The sound of the wind carried their sobs. It was as if even heaven and earth were crying.

“Since it hurts so much, there’s no need to live. You can all just die. I’m a nice person, so I’ll send you all away together.”

Suddenly, a voice rang out. Everyone raised their hands in shock. That middle-aged man had reappeared.
