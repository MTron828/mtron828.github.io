Chapter 3823 Ghost Dao Lifeforms

“Conceal your auras and don’t move!”

Mo Nian’s expression changed and he hastily sent a spiritual transmission to everyone.

Long Chen’s first instinct was to grab his saber. But with this warning, Long Chen recalled that he was wearing the special robes that Mo Nian had given them.

The five of them went still, standing there like statues. When that lifeform got closer, they finally saw its face.

It was a humanoid lifeform with two black horns growing out of its head. Its hands were like eagle claws, and it had a long tail dragging at the end of its back. Its entire body was withered. But despite that, when it got close, its Blood Qi was suffocating.

This was a terrifying immemorial lifeform. However, none of them had ever seen a lifeform that looked like this before. Even with all Mo Nian, Long Chen, and Yue Xiaoqian’s learning, they didn’t recognize it.

An evil corpse with a withered physical body shouldn’t have much essence blood left, but this corpse still gave them a feeling of immense pressure. It was definitely not some nameless existence.

It stopped right in front of Long Chen and the others, who didn’t dare to even twitch. The lifeform noticed them but didn’t attack. It only strolled around them twice before slowly leaving from where it came.

Once it left, their tense hearts finally relaxed slightly. This meant that the disguises Mo Nian had given them could truly trick evil corpses.

Evil corpses were nourished by the negative emotions found in tombs. They had no consciousness, but they would crazily attack any living lifeform.

First, ignoring the corpse’s actual power, just the death qi contained within it meant that being beaten or clawed by it would be fatal.

Thus, when Mo Nian was robbing tombs, his greatest worry was evil corpses. They were truly difficult to deal with. Against these terrifying evil corpses, even Mo Nian would choose to flee.

Once that evil corpse left, they slowly continued onwards. They were far slower now. After they were through the passageway, they saw a giant open space.

“This is the death cave. The entire tomb’s death qi gathers here and then passes through the death channel to be expelled by the death gate. We’ll have to detour around the death cave to enter the true tomb. Be careful everyone. This is the place that most commonly produces evil corpses,” transmitted Mo Nian silently.

“Guo Ran, don’t pull me! I’m also afraid!” said Xia Chen, annoyed when he felt Guo Ran pulling him.

“I… I’m not pulling you!” Guo Ran’s voice quivered. He stared at Xia Chen in horror.

As soon as he said this, all five of them felt a chill run down their spines.

Long Chen suddenly let out a punch. There was a muffled bang, and a qi wave spread.

It seemed that Long Chen’s fist did strike something because that strange creature let out a painful shout.

However, none of them managed to see what this lifeform was. All five of their expressions changed.

“Long Chen, did you see what it was?” asked Yue Xiaoqian.

“No. I just attacked based on a feeling. It wasn’t big, and it wasn’t hard. It was like striking a cotton sheet,” said Long Chen.

“Oh? After grave robbing for so many years, have I finally run into a ghost?” Mo Nian’s eyes widened.

“What are you talking about? Since when are there actual ghosts in this world?” asked Xia Chen.

“The ghosts that he’s talking about aren’t the mortal world’s ghosts, but the Ghost Dao of the six Daos. They are a kind of spiritual body that can hide within heaven and earth. People normally can’t see them unless you possess a spiritual eye… That’s right, a spiritual eye!”

Long Chen suddenly closed his right eye and opened his left eye, activating the Purgatory Eyes.

In that moment, Long Chen saw countless translucent spheres of light floating through the air. Those were the Ghost Dao’s lifeforms.

Using his Spiritual Strength, Long Chen shared his vision with the others. They all saw those spiritual bodies.

Those spiritual bodies were only the size of a fist. They were like tiny clouds, and they even had small tails behind them like fish swimming through the air.

Without Long Chen sharing his sight with them, they wouldn’t be able to see these lifeforms. Also, these lifeforms didn’t possess any malice. It was like they weren’t even conscious.

Several of them were swimming around Xia Chen and Guo Ran as if they were very curious about them.

It was unknown if it was because one had been struck by Long Chen, but those spiritual bodies didn’t dare to approach Long Chen. They only dared to rove around the others.

“These lifeforms have no killing intent or malice. I once read a book in the original devil race’s ancestral land that mentioned the Ghost Dao’s lifeforms. Some are kind, and some are evil. While some will take lives, and some will help others. Oh, some are even greedy for wealth and like to tease people. The more afraid you are, the more they’ll like to tease you. Long Chen, do you still remember how you bought one of the Ghost Dao’s lifeforms with money and had it lead the way?” said Yue Xiaoqian.

Long Chen smiled. He truly had bought the Ghost Dao’s lifeforms before. After all, he wasn’t afraid of them as his heavenly tribulation lightning was their bane.

“So you’re saying they are a group of trickster troublemakers?” asked Long Chen.

Suddenly, Xia Chen brazenly reached out and grabbed one of those lifeforms. But he was shocked to see his hand pass straight through it. It was like that lifeform was nothing more than an illusion.

“What’s going on?” asked Xia Chen.

“The Ghost Dao’s lifeforms are bodies of special kinds of energy. Of the six Daos, the Ghost Dao’s lifeforms are the most difficult to understand. They can switch between illusory and solid. The moment you touch it, it goes from solid to illusory, making it so that you can’t touch it,” explained Yue Xiaoqian.

Xia Chen curiously tested it but found that he was still unable to touch this lifeform. Also, it seemed to be having fun and wasn’t afraid of him. It actually began to run around his body, drawing to bait him into catching it.

“If they have no malice toward us, we can ignore them. Let’s keep searching.” After some curious tests, they calmed down, and Mo Nian suggested continuing on.

This place was filled with dangers. It was unknown how many evil corpses were running around, so they had to use every bit of time to search for treasures.

Suddenly, Long Chen reached out a hand. A lifeform that had been spinning around Yue Xiaoqian’s side was caught.

That lifeform immediately went from a ball of mist into a palm-sized humanoid lifeform. It let out strange cries as it struggled.

“You can catch it?!”

Suddenly, that lifeform of the Ghost Dao furiously opened its mouth. A viper-like fang then appeared in its mouth, and it bit down on Long Chen’s finger.

Long Chen felt a sharp pain in his finger. He had originally thought that his physical body wouldn’t be afraid of it, but blood began to flow out of his finger.

The moment his blood appeared, that lifeform went still. Moreover, all those lifeforms roaming through the air came to a stop.

They began to quiver in the air as if they were seeing something terrifying.

That lifeform screamed in terror and seemed to be begging Long Chen for mercy.

“Is this… because of the Ghost Sovereign’s mark?” Long Chen’s heart thudded.Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m
