Chapter 4375 Sullen Eight Great Kings

BOOM!

The horn that was sharper than an Eternal divine weapon exploded amongst the ranks of the humanless world. In the end, it was unable to contain Long Chen’s astral energy.

Terrifying astral energies unfurled, blasting apart the surrounding Eternal experts.

Long Chen then summoned the Seven Peak Sword into his grasp. With his astral energy flowing, he was unstoppable. He slaughtered them and willingly let other people’s attacks land on him in order to take their lives.

Long Chen was now incredibly powerful. Unless faced with a life-threatening attack, he couldn't be bothered to dodge. Despite hundreds of attacks landing on him, he paid them no mind. The life energy from the primal chaos space's Moon Trees and Fusang Trees was more than sufficient, instantly healing all his wounds.

Enduring hundreds of superficial wounds, Long Chen relentlessly claimed the lives of dozens of Eternal experts. His suicidal fighting style struck terror into the hearts of the humanless world's experts, as they had never seen such a terrifying human before. He seemed more like a devil than even the devil race.

Before the gates of the humanless world, a growing crowd of onlookers witnessed this gruesome battle. Even the senior generation's experts were horrified by the unfolding spectacle.

The slain lifeforms were Eternal experts. If nothing unexpected happened to them, they would live as long as heaven and earth. However, Long Chen slaughtered them like livestock here, causing Eternal corpses to continuously fall from the sky. It was a bloody and terrifying sight.

Long Chen was like a madman. He didn’t block most attacks and just allowed them to land on him as he reaped another life. This kind of brutal fighting style terrified everyone here.

Long Chen wasn’t the only one fighting. On the side of the Dragonblood Legion, Yue Zifeng, Guo Ran, Xia Chen, Gu Yang, Li Qi, and Song Mingyuan were also locked in battles with Eternal experts. Every single one of them had killed several Eternal experts.

Other than them, Bai Shishi, Yu Qingxuan, and Bai Xiaole successfully eliminated their targets as well. Bai Xiaole in particular seemed to have gone crazy after his merger with the Violet Pupil Nine Tail Fox. It was drenched in blood, and its violet eyes emitted a potent demonic glow that continued to intensify. Every part of it—its tails, claws, teeth, and eyes—unleashed killer moves.

The Violet Pupil Nine Tail Fox had already killed over ten Eternal experts, a record second only to Long Chen.

Most terrifying of all, it was picking out its targets. After killing them, its tail would pierce the other side’s crystal core, seemingly absorbing some energy.

“Wait, where are the humanless world’s Eight Great Kings?” asked one of the spectators suddenly.

It had to be known that the Eight Great Kings were famous. Back then, they had said that any single one of them could beat Long Chen. Why had they still not appeared until now?

“You arrived too late. The so-called King of the Kunpeng race was killed by Long Chen as soon as he appeared. Three of the other Kings had also shown up,” replied another person.

“And then?”Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Two of them were slain by the Dragonblood Legion’s captains. I didn’t really notice who killed them because there was too much going on.”

“And the third one?”

“That one? He was rather unlucky. He thought he was so smart, trying to sneak attack the Dragonblood warriors, but he ended up surrounded and killed. I didn’t even see how it exactly happened. Perhaps even the Dragonblood warriors don’t know that they just killed one of the Eight Great Kings.”

“Really?” That person was stunned. These were the so-called Eight Great Kings? They were treated as nothing more than ordinary people by the Dragonblood warriors?

“I only saw those four appear and die as soon as they arrived. As for the other four, I didn’t see them. This battle is too chaotic. My focus is on senior apprentice-brother Long Chen,” said another person.

“It couldn’t be that the other four were casually slain as well, right?” Everyone exchanged glances. It sounded a bit unbelievable, yet it didn't seem entirely implausible.

As the strongest experts of their generation, they couldn’t possibly be hiding like tortoises in such a large-scale battle, right? How could they face the world afterward?

Yet, if they did join the fray, would their presence truly make a difference? After observing the ferocity of the Dragonblood Legion and the prowess of some individuals who could withstand the blows of Eternal experts, the onlookers felt like the Great Kings were likely not going to bring any impact.

Long Chen took the lead, with Yue Zifeng, Guo Ran, Xia Chen, Gu Yang, Li Qi, Song Mingyuan, Bai Shishi, Bai Xiaole, and Yu Qingxuan following closely behind.

A short distance away, five thousand Dragonblood warriors moved in a coordinated killing formation, sweeping through their enemies. They resembled a machine made of flesh and blood. Even Eternal experts who ventured into their midst would find themselves surrounded and dispatched in less than a breath's time.

Also, anyone who had tried to disturb Long Chen and the others’ rhythm by attacking the Dragonblood Legion ultimately ended up losing everything, including their lives.

Everyone assumed that the Dragonblood warriors were the weakest fighters in the Dragonblood Legion, but little did they know that each one of them was a Triple Supreme equipped with Eternal armor and weapons. Their formation was flawless, and they possessed the ability to link their energy, sharing each other's power.

Even without Guo Ran, they could merge the power of dozens of Dragonblood warriors into one person to attack an Eternal expert. If hundreds of them joined forces at once, even Eternal experts would meet a grisly end at their hands.

This was why many people thought the last four of the Eight Great Kings might have simply died in the chaos to the Dragonblood warriors.

Behind the Dragonblood Legion stood millions of disciples of the Starry River Sect. They were equally ferocious, and their manifestations were all uniform. Because of their connection, when they fought, they could provide mutual support and create a stunning display of power.

Unless Eternal experts came, they weren’t afraid of anyone. As it stood, all the Eternal experts were tied down by Long Chen and the others, and those who slipped through would be dealt with by the Dragonblood Legion and the warriors of the Starry River Sect.

Further behind them were the experts Long Chen had brought from the Great Desolate World. They could only pick up the leftovers of the Starry River Sect’s disciples, but by their turn, most of the enemies were already half dead.

They were mostly only there to clean up the battlefield, while the stronger members of their ranks were supporting the Starry River Sect’s disciples.

The weaker disciples were well aware of their own limits. Since they couldn’t help, they didn’t complain or cause trouble. They focused on doing what they could to support the ongoing efforts.

BOOM!

Suddenly, a shocking change occurred on the battlefield. Numerous experts of the humanless world gave up on fighting and started to flee for their lives.

“What’s going on?”

“Are they giving up?”

“The Eternal experts are also running!”

The experts from the humanless world fled further into their territory. Observing their desperate retreat, countless onlookers were left agape with disbelief.
