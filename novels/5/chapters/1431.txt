Chapter 1432 The Gamebreaker

Translator: BornToBe

All the experts from the Corrupt path, the ancient races, and the ancient family alliance exploded one by one. Chu Yao jumped in shock. This was too sudden. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“This con was arranged from the start.” Long Chen watched as those experts struggled to resist.

Through this reminder, Chu Yao thought of how every one of these people had coughed up a mouthful of blood before this. She instantly realized something.

All of those experts summoned their manifestations and went all-out resisting. But this power wasn’t an outer force. It was coming from within them. They were unable to control their own bodies. It was like the self-detonation process had been triggered and could not be stopped.

Blood poured towards the black saber. As more essence blood gathered on it, a vague figure gradually grew more solid.

“NO!”

Screams of despair rang out. Unable to resist this bizarre power, these experts exploded.

In the end, the only ones left were Sha Guangyan, Peng Wansheng, and seven rank nine Celestials. They had summoned their manifestations and were just barely able to prevent themselves from exploding.

Sha Guangyan and Peng Wansheng were a bit better off. Their primal chaos manifestations made it so there wasn’t much change in them. But the rank nine Celestials were all pale as paper, and had the majority of their Spirit Blood extracted.

They had felt like their bodies were no longer theirs. Their Spirit Blood had been extracted in the most barbaric, most domineering method. Even their Heavenly Dao energy hadn’t helped them.

The fortunate thing was that they were alive. The unfortunate thing was that having lost the majority of their Spirit Blood, they would need to spend a long time recuperating.

In the blink of an eye, over a thousand experts were slain. Even Life Star experts hadn’t been able to resist.

It had to be known that those who were able to reach this place were all true experts. But they didn’t have the slightest ability to resist in front of the black saber.

The blood quickly condensed into a three-hundred-meter blood giant. It grasped the black saber.

The black saber also grew to become three hundred meters long. It slashed down, shaking the sky. Black light devoured the world. A black crescent moon slashed towards the drop of Sovereign blood.

BOOM!

The black crescent moon was like a devil’s blade. The Sovereign blood ripplied, and its rainbow light suddenly blazed. A supreme will descended. It was like the will of a god, something no one could resist.

Peng Wansheng, Sha Guangyan, and the rank nine Celestials all knelt on the ground in front of this terrifying pressure.

Long Chen also felt the pressure, but it didn’t affect him at all. On the other hand, Chu Yao turned pale and tottered, requiring him to support her.

In that instant, Chu Yao felt like a god was looking at her. She felt that not kneeling would be a blaspheme to that god.

But with Long Chen’s support, most of the Sovereign pressure suddenly vanished. In the end, she didn’t kneel.

The rainbow light lit up the sky. The black crescent moon shattered.

The blood giant exploded, and the black blade dimmed. It once more stabbed into the stone platform in exactly the same position as before.

“Chu Yao, be careful. I’m going in.”

Just at this moment, Long Chen shot over. When the black saber stabbed into the ground, just as everyone had yet to recover from their shock, he arrived in front of it.

“Bastard, don’t even think about it!” Sha Guangyan and Peng Wansheng roared at the same time, charging over.

But Long Chen had taken the initiative. He grabbed the black saber. This was the best opportunity to take it.

This was also his only chance. For this chance, he had already moved the World Tree sprouts in the primal chaos space into one of the life storage rocks. He was preparing to drop the black saber into the primal chaos space and have the primal chaos bead suppress it.

In truth, he could tell that this black saber was still being a scammer. It was acting heavily injured, but it was just for everyone to see.

It wanted someone to bring it away. The Sovereign blood in the sky only targeted it. It didn’t target anyone else.

When the time came, no matter who managed to bring it away, it would cooperate. Of course, after striking an agreement with it, the price for bringing it away would probably be that person’s life.

Peng Wansheng and Sha Guangyan were unable to see this. They were still rushing over without realizing that if they did succeed in taking the saber, they would most likely be forfeiting their lives.

If Long Chen didn’t have the primal chaos bead, he wouldn’t hesitate to toss the saber to them. But since he did, he had to try it.

His hand grabbed hold of the hilt. He was just about to pull it out and toss it in the primal chaos space.

But the instant his hand touched the hilt, the saber vanished.

Not only did the saber vanish, all the surroundings vanished. Long Chen appeared in a strange space.

This space was only a few square meters. The space around it was twisting. It was like he was currently in a stable space flowing through the river of time. Long Chen was shocked, thinking he had fallen into a trap.

“Don’t worry. Right now, time is still.”

Just at this moment, a voice rang out behind him. He turned back to see a white-robed man standing there, looking down at a chessboard on the ground. The man didn’t look at him. He seemed to be lost in thought.

When he saw this man, Long Chen’s heart began to pound madly. He instantly felt like he knew who this person was.

“Come and have a look at this chessboard.” The man beckoned Long Chen over without looking at him.

Long Chen’s heartbeat pounded loudly in his ears. Despite his big guts, he couldn’t stay calm in front of a legendary existence.

He forcibly suppressed his emotions and walked over to the man. He didn’t feel any pressure. He didn’t feel any aura at all. It was like this man didn’t even exist. It was like everything in front of him was nothing more than a fabrication.

“How would you play out this game?” asked the white-robed man.

Long Chen carefully examined the chessboard. There was a chaotic arrangement of white and black pieces. Although he didn’t know how to play this kind of chess, he could see that the black pieces had almost taken over the board. The white pieces were fighting with their backs in a small corner.

“It should be your turn. Whatever you decide, you have to choose a path,” said the man.

Long Chen was startled. This sentence sounded like it had a double meaning. He wanted him to make a choice?

He knew that this white-robed man was most likely the Sovereign Yun Shang mentioned by the black saber.

But what did choose a path mean? He looked at the chessboard, not saying a word.

“Hesitating like this shouldn’t be your character,” sighed the man.

Long Chen nodded. Clenching his teeth, he reached out.

The chessboard flipped through the air, the pieces tumbling to the ground. The white and black pieces transformed into runes that vanished.

“I don’t know how to play this kind of chess, and I don’t like wasting time playing by other people’s rules. If I have to play, then I’m going to play by my rules.” Long Chen was a bit apprehensive inside, but he thickened his skin.

The white-robed man seemed to be stunned. Only at this moment did he raise his head. Long Chen finally saw his face.

He looked very young, and wasn’t particularly handsome. He simply looked average except for his bright eyes.

It felt like his eyes contained the river of time. Although he looked young, he also looked ancient. Although he was looking right at him, his memory of him felt like it was constantly being turned vague and indistinct.

“You wear black robes?” The white-robed man was a bit surprised. The flow of the river of time in his eyes suddenly began to flow differently. Looking at his eyes made Long Chen’s head hurt.

“Hahaha, I understand, I understand! Truly worthy of the gamebreaker!” The white-robed man suddenly laughed heartily.

“Junior Long Chen greets Sovereign Yun Shang.” Long Chen paid his respects, while also testing his guess.

“Good, very good!” The white-robed man didn’t admit to it, but he didn’t deny it. He just looked at Long Chen.

Now it was awkward. Long Chen didn’t know what to say to that. However, his face wasn’t so thick for nothing.

“Yes, I also feel like I’m very good.” Long Chen nodded.

The white-robed man smiled. “How is the situation of the Martial Heaven Continent now?”

“Unfortunately, I’m not aware of it. My elders refuse to tell me, and I don’t particularly care. In any case, no matter what the situation is, all I need to do is look after myself and my people,” said Long Chen honestly.

When it came to the Martial Heaven Continent as a whole, he might as well be blind. There were many things that he didn’t know. Whether it was the old man of the Heaven Splitting Battle Sect or Li Tianxuan of the Xuantian Dao Sect, or even the Xuantian Tower, they all didn’t want him to come into contact with too many secrets.

He knew that they were doing this for his benefit, so he didn’t press them on these questions. Even if he knew those things, what could he possibly do about it?

No matter what kind of dangers there were, they would come sooner or later. Dodging was not a way to resolve a problem. In the end, he would have to rely on his power, so all he needed to do was increase his strength.

The man nodded at Long Chen. “With your current cultivation base, they are afraid of having you bear karma. I can’t nitpick them on that. However, you are the gamebreaker. These burdens will fall to you to carry sooner or later. You won’t be able to run. However, not telling you these things is fine. It’ll avoid the implications of karma. They won’t be eliminated in accordance to the rules.”

“Senior, what is the gamebreaker?” Long Chen finally asked this question which he had been puzzling over ever since he had first heard this word. He greatly longed for this white-robed man to answer him.
