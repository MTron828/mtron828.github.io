Chapter 2635 The Western Desert Ax Accepts a Master

“Long Chen, you found the Western Desert Ax?” asked Qu Jianying emotionally.

Long Chen saw that other than the High Priest and Daoist Heavenly Feather, even the divine families’ Lord Venerate and four family heads had come. He hesitated for a moment but still waved his hand in the end.

A giant rusty ax fell to the ground, and a giant hole was smashed into the earth.

Despite the specks of rust covering it, its ancient aura still came out strongly. Its powerful murderous aura shook the people.

“The Western Desert Ax! It really is the Western Desert Ax!”

The senior experts let out startled cries because this ax was identical to the one described in legends. That aura was unmistakable. Only one of the five supreme divine items could possess that aura.

“The Western Desert Ax has had its source energy extracted. It might not…” Daoist Heavenly Feather looked at it worriedly.

She wanted to say that it might not have the power to fight when the battle started. However, such depressing words weren’t appropriate at this time. She didn’t want to give a blow to everyone’s emotions.

“This is a good ax! Brother Long, can I have it?” Wilde was stuffing his face with meat, but his eyes lit up when he saw the Western Desert Ax. This kind of giant weapon was his favorite.

“The Blood Barbarian race? Hahaha, good, very good! It seems that I can finally return to my old glory!”

The Western Desert Ax’s voice suddenly rang out, startling everyone. Both the Northern Source Sword and the Southern Sea Zither were mysterious, and the outside world had never heard their voices. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Senior Western Desert…” Long Chen was also surprised.

“Long Chen, you saved me. Actually, I should take you as my master, but your power doesn’t match mine. Moreover, this little fellow is most suited to me, and I also need his Blood Qi to recover as fast as possible,” said the Western Desert Ax.

“Do you really want to be my weapon?” exclaimed Wilde excitedly.

“Foolish fellow, if you want to control me, you have to pay an immense price. You’ll have to-”

Before the Western Desert Ax could finish speaking, Wilde was already agreeing. “I want to! Do you need Blood Qi? I eat meat every day. My Blood Qi is always strong. You can take as much as you want. I need a good weapon to help my brother Long beat bad people. As long as you can help me, I’m willing.”

Hearing such foolish words from this simple-headed brother of his, Long Chen felt a burst of emotion.

Wilde had followed him for a long time. However, lately, he hadn’t been able to help much when the crisis descended. He had been feeling anxious about this for a long time.

Seeing this terrifying weapon before him, a weapon which he particularly liked as a heavy-type weapon, he greatly desired it.

Although Mo Nian had given him the door bolt, which wasn’t bad, it was an entity from the Netherworld. It was unable to form a connection with Wilde’s Blood Qi.

Furthermore, using it was very uncomfortable. There was nowhere to grip it. Wilde only used it because he didn’t have a more suitable weapon.

“Just as the legends say. The Blood Barbarian race’s people are all muscle heads. Fine, I won’t say anything else. Let us fight alongside each other.”

The Western Desert Ax’s body suddenly shrank until it was about ten meters long. It floated over toward Wilde.

When it fell on Wilde, Wilde let out a startled cry. Four strange bloody bones grew out of his back, and the Western Desert Ax landed on them. When the ground beneath his feet shattered, his shout grew louder.

“Little fellow, I need to form a connection with your blood. This is a painful process. If you can’t handle it, you can give up at any moment,” shouted the Western Desert Ax.

“I won’t! I won’t even if I have to die…” Wilde clenched his teeth, and blood dripped out of his mouth. Only he knew how much pain he was in.

The Western Desert Ax was one of the five supreme divine items. It was called the killing tool of the five divine items, so it had killed countless lifeforms. To become its master required experiencing its domineering side.

Looking at this scene, Long Chen clenched his fists so hard that his fingernails drew blood. Wilde was his first real brother. From the moment Long Chen had received a whip for him in the Phoenix Cry Empire, Long Chen had viewed him as his brother. He was like a child that couldn’t grow up, so Long Chen refused to allow him to be wronged. Wilde’s emotions were all pure.

Now, for him, Wilde was experiencing immense pain. Long Chen was unable to bear this, but he also couldn’t help him.

“Long Chen, it’s fine. The Western Desert Ax won’t harm Wilde.” Meng Qi lightly held Long Chen’s hand.

Long Chen nodded. He also trusted the Western Desert Ax, but he didn’t like seeing Wilde in pain.

BOOM!

Suddenly, the earth trembled. As a wave of pressure blew apart the clouds, a vast aura soared.

Upon looking back at Wilde, an image had appeared on his forehead. That was the image of the Western Desert Ax.

As the image slowly faded, Wilde’s large body began to wither. In just a few breaths’ time, he had shrunk a whole level.

At the same time, bubbles appeared and popped on the Western Desert Ax. The rust slowly fell away.

As the rust fell, it revealed a golden body. The Western Desert Ax was actually golden. However, only a small portion of the rust had fallen away. As for Wilde, he was almost skin and bones now.

Wilde seemed to have expected this and began to rip into a large leg. That was the leg of the mid Heaven Merging devil expert he had bitten to death. Only his two legs remained.

As Wilde’s Blood Qi was sucked away, he quickly replenished it. The intense hunger made his eyes redden.

The first leg was quickly finished. He took out another leg and finished it as well. However, the hunger didn’t fade. Dong Mingyu quickly took out the devil corpses that she had killed.

Hence, Wilde began a feast. That bloody sight made other people’s hair stand on end.

However, the Western Desert Ax had chosen Wilde as master, so the Martial Heaven Continent’s experts were filled with excitement. They had gained another layer of protection for the dark era.

“Congratulations. The return of the Western Desert Ax is a grand occasion for the Martial Heaven Continent.” The divine families’ Lord Venerate spoke to the High Priest.
