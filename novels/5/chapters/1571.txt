Chapter 1566 Five Stars Awaken, Heaven and Earth Shake

Translator: BornToBe

All these senior experts had watched as their beloved disciples died one by one at Long Chen and his people’s hands.

The barrier that had appeared was extremely strange. When their attacks landed on it, a portion of their power was absorbed by the barrier and used to block their remaining power.

This formation was absolutely shameless to use their own power to block their attacks. That was why the barrier had taken so long to break. It was only by continuously weakening its power that they managed to finally break through.

Just as they broke the barrier, they saw Meng Qi unleash a powerful move that temporarily stripped their disciples of their Yuan Spirits.

Meng Qi’s move was absolutely shocking. Since it was spread over such an enormous area, its power was weakened, and she was only able to strip their Yuan Spirits out of their bodies for half a breath’s time.

However, that half a breath’s time was what ended their lives. The Dragonblood Legion didn’t need any direction. Their cooperation was seamless.

As soon as Meng Qi unleashed her move, they unleashed their own powerful moves, slaughtering their opponents. In the end, only around a thousand people survived. The rest were killed.

Those people were people whose Spiritual Strength was also very monstrous. With Meng Qi’s technique spread over such a wide area, they managed to pull back their Yuan Spirits immediately and protect themselves.

Seeing the barrier break, they were delighted and hastily fled toward their reinforcements. They furiously roared, “Long Chen, you’re dead now!”

Evilmoon said, “Long Chen, you should run. There are too many of them, and they have divine items. Your Dragonblood Legion will take large casualties.”

Over a hundred thousand Life Star experts charged over like a tide. Anyone would feel a chill from that sight.

“I’ve already said that I won’t rely on your power to run again. That will affect my Dao-heart.” Long Chen shook his head. He made a gesture, causing the Dragonblood Legion to regather.

Seeing the reinforcements, Yan Weishan, Hu Xiaolin, and Jin Mingwei all exchanged a glance. They all nodded.

The three of them suddenly coughed up blood onto their divine items. That one mouthful of blood contained the majority of their essence blood.

Their three divine items unleashed blinding light. Divine pressure crashed down on Long Chen.

“Long Chen, did you really think we only had this little ability? Today, I’ll let you understand what a true trump card is!” sneered Yan Weishan. The golden furnace above him was shining with divine light. Its divine power had already locked onto Long Chen.

At the same time, Hu Xiaolin’s bone claw and Jin Mingwei’s blood gourd were also locked onto him.

The three of them were now safe thanks to these reinforcements, and so they didn’t mind exhausting a huge amount of their essence blood to activate their divine items. By killing Long Chen in front of everyone, they would retrieve the face they had lost today.

This battle had been extremely miserable for them. It could be said that they had already lost. As for whether or not they could reverse that loss, it would be up to this attack.

There were multiple reasons why they hadn’t unleashed this move before. One was because of their ulterior motives and desire to preserve their power. Another reason was because they wanted to pull in Zi Yan. But the main reason was because they didn’t care about the deaths of these experts. Although they were allied for this one occasion, they didn’t have the slightest relationship to them. They had no reason to do their utmost to help them.

The reason they were unleashing this move now was mostly because of their own reputations. If Long Chen fell to others, it wouldn’t make up for their defeat, so they had to kill him themselves. Furthermore, their reinforcements had arrived, so they didn’t need to worry about entering a weak state after using this move. There was no threat to their lives.

Their three divine items unleashed three huge pillars of light that enveloped Long Chen. He was like a bird in a cage.

“They were actually holding back their most terrifying move!” All the neutral camp’s experts let out startled cries. They had truly hidden their power deeply.

Meng Qi and the others’ expressions also changed. They hadn’t expected these three to be so sinister. Despite how urgent the situation had been, they had still held back their strongest trump card.

As for Long Chen, he had already used up his trump cards. The only thing that comforted them was that Long Chen didn’t reveal the slightest sign of panic. Instead, he seemed to look at their actions with disdain.

Long Chen sneered, “You didn’t even have the courage to put your life on the line. People like you are fated to never be able to compete with me. Did you really think these people could save you? Today, I’ll show you what true power is.”

Long Chen stabbed his saber into the ground and bent his back slightly. The divine ring behind him suddenly stopped moving.

Formless energy started to rise from below Long Chen. A wild gale surged around him, causing his clothes to wave wildly. His hair blew back toward the sky.

A wild aura was circulating within Long Chen’s body. The five-point star in his divine ring grew brighter and brighter. Its lines also grew thicker.

The ground beneath him cracked. Those cracks instantly spread throughout the battlefield. The Dragonblood Legion hastily retreated, and the distant neutral camp’s experts followed. They were all silent. Only the senior experts composed of sect masters and the like were still roaring furiously as they charged over.

“FengFu Star - awaken!”

The lower-left corner of Long Chen’s five-point star in his divine ring lit up. A star appeared there. At the same time, his left foot began to shine. The air of primal chaos and a Grand Dao revolved around him.

“What is that? He still had a trump card?” The jaws of the neutral camp’s experts dropped.

“Evilmoon, you laughed at me for not having the qualifications to challenge the Sovereigns. Today, I’ll show you my qualifications. Even I don't know how strong this move is, because it’s my first time as well.” Long Chen smiled.

The reason why Long Chen had arrived late was because something had happened with the Nine Star Hegemon Body Art. Before this problem, he had assumed that once he finished the ninth star transformation of the Divine Gate Star, he would be able to summon the true Five Star Battle Armor.

However, he was shocked to find that as soon as the Divine Gate Star went through its transformation, the five stars immediately shut down. That had made his soul almost flee his body in terror. If he couldn’t use the five stars, he wouldn’t be able to save Cloud.

He had hastily poured more heaven and earth divine spring into the Divine Gate Star, only to find that it didn’t change at all.

After testing what was going on, he found that when he nourished the FengFu Star with the heaven and earth divine spring, it began to awaken. It was like it had become revitalized with life and was different from before.

After the FengFu Star, the Alioth Star also slowly woke. All his stars seemed to be undergoing a special metamorphosis that required the heaven and earth divine spring.

Long Chen found that he didn’t have enough heaven and earth divine spring, so he hastily went to find more. However, he didn’t reveal his identity at that time to avoid causing anything unexpected in the Dragon Slaughtering Convention.

He had flipped through dozens of powerful forces and snatched their heaven and earth divine springs in order to fully awaken his Five Star Battle Armor. Then he immediately rushed over to the Grand Han.

Now, this was his first time activating the FengFu Star like this. His power instantly surged. The feeling of being full of power was delightful, and this level of power even frightened himself.

“Alioth Star - awaken!”

“Life Fate Star- awaken!”

“Enlightenment Palace Star - awaken!”

His left foot, right hand, left hand, and right foot all began to shine. The lower and middle corners of his five-point star in his divine ring each had a star appear. With every star that awakened, his power soared. That power caused the sky to quiver.

“Divine Gate Star - awaken!”

Long Chen’s forehead lit up. The peak corner of the five-point star lit up as well, and the five stars were all shining brightly. Endless energy was flowing within it, like a lifeless cosmos that had suddenly been filled with limitless energy.

BOOM!

A pillar of light soared into the sky. The stars shook, while Long Chen seemed like the undefeatable god of the starry sky.

Everyone was shocked, and even the experts charging at him felt fear. That kind of power was just too terrifying.

Yan Weishan, Hu Xiaolin, and Jin Mingwei all felt a chill. Long Chen was no human, he was a ferocious monster.

Their three divine items finally finished accumulating energy, and three streaks of light shot toward Long Chen.

Long Chen looked at those three streaks of light coldly. He randomly swung Evilmoon.

BOOM!

Their three attacks exploded. Divine light sprinkled through the air.

“He destroyed the attacks of three powerful divine items with a random stroke of his saber! Heavens, who in the world can match him?!” cried out someone in shock and terror.

Yan Weishan, Hu Xiaolin, and Jin Mingwei coughed up blood. They flew back along with their three divine items. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

“I only have ten breaths’ time. Evilmoon, if you want to eat meat, hurry up,” said Long Chen as he sensed at the energy rapidly being exhausted in his body.

“Good job, Long Chen, you’ve impressed me. Then let’s go all-out!” Evilmoon cried out excitedly.

Long Chen’s figure vanished from his original location. When he reappeared, he was right in front of Hu Xiaolin. His saber slashed heavily onto Hu Xiaolin’s giant head.
