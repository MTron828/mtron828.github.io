Chapter 2491 I’ll Accompany You

Within this chaotic flow of space, everyone was in danger. At this moment, Ye Ming flew back into it and attacked Nangong Zuiyue and Beitang Rushuang.

Beitang Rushuang’s expression changed. It was difficult for them to pass through this chaotic flow. Any more trouble would knock them back further.

Ye Ming was truly treacherous. This attack’s power was normally nothing to them, but within this chaotic flow, it could be fatal.

Nangong Zuiyue extended a hand. A curtain of water appeared within the chaotic flow. It followed the chaotic flow, and Ye Ming’s attack was distorted as it passed through the water, resulting in it flying past the two of them.

Nangong Zuiyue’s water energy was actually able to resolve Ye Ming’s attack. However, doing so within this chaotic flow had come at a price. Her face instantly turned pale.

“Interesting.” Ye Ming was surprised. Within this chaotic flow, they were cut off from Heavenly Dao energy. The only reason he could move so freely here was due to his dark energy.

“Let’s try again,” snorted Ye Ming, attacking once more.

“Ye Ming, you really are courting death. Are you provoking the everlasting families?!” raged Beitang Rushuang.

“The everlasting families? They’re nothing in my eyes,” sneered Ye Ming.

Beitang Rushuang’s fury soared. She raised her bow, but she was stopped by Nangong Zuiyue.

“If you do that, we will lose any chance of escaping this chaotic flow. I’ll handle it.” Nangong Zuiyue formed hand seals. Her true water energy was able to borrow a bit of the energy of the chaotic flow of space to distort Ye Ming’s attacks.

“The backlash is too great. You’ll definitely be severely injured and we’ll still be dead. If we’re going to die anyway, we might as well drag him down with us,” said Beitang Rushuang hatefully.

She could see that Nangong Zuiyue had borrowed some of the power of the chaotic flow of space. However, that power did not belong to the Heavenly Daos. Using it was not easy. Nangong Zuiyue had already been injured, and doing so again would worsen her injury.

“Ye Ming, if you want to play, I’ll accompany you.” Long Chen’s icy voice rang out. He attacked through the chaotic flow.

“Long Chen!” Nangong Zuiyue and Beitang Rushuang were both startled. It was far too dangerous for Long Chen to come back at this time.

“Hahaha, I was waiting for you,” laughed Ye Ming. His sword twisted, slashing toward Long Chen.

“Long Chen, don’t fall for his trap!” shouted Nangong Zuiyue. Ye Ming was clearly attacking them to draw Long Chen out and trap him here.

“Get onto the ship. I’ll kill him. This piece of trash has really pissed me off,” said Long Chen.

BOOM!

Evilmoon slammed into the jagged sword. Space twisted around them.

“Ye Ming, you are supposed to be a generation’s genius, a reincarnation of a Corrupt God, but you do such shameful things. The so-called Corrupt Gods really are trash,” sneered Long Chen angrily. This was the action of a god? It was more like that of a slightly smellier pile of dung.

BOOM!

Long Chen attacked once more. He was also unaffected by the chaotic flow of space.

“A little mortal thinks he can understand the mind of the gods? Such lies will only increase your own karma. You should be respectful toward the gods,” snorted Ye Ming. However, he was a bit surprised that Long Chen could fight within this chaotic flow.

What he was unaware of was that when Long Chen had stepped into the third step of Netherpassage, he had relied on the death energy within the chaotic flow. Hence, he also had a bit of control over this kind of energy.

With Long Chen attacking Ye Ming, Nangong Zuiyue and Beitang Rushuang quickly flew onto the flying boat.

Long Chen attacked three times, clashing with Ye Ming thrice. He was startled to sense that Ye Ming’s power was rapidly climbing. It was as if he was being supported by the energy here.

“Hahaha, have you noticed? I don’t mind telling you. The reason I released the Heaven Devouring Fiend King was to obtain its devouring power. I’ve already succeeded. This chaotic flow of space can’t do anything to me, and its dark energy is strengthening my own. As for you, you will die here.” Ye Ming laughed. Looking at the ship and seeing that everyone else had flown onto it, he suddenly waved his hand. Pillars appeared within the chaotic flow, trapping Long Chen.

“Don’t you like trapping others? The cycle of karma has determined that you should experience what it feels like to be trapped.” Ye Ming suddenly retreated, forming hand seals and summoning a giant black prison within the chaotic flow.

The prison quickly shrank, its pressure crashing down on Long Chen’s body. He felt like millions of black swords were pressing down on his body.

Long Chen swung Evilmoon at one of the pillars, and although he made a cut into it, he didn’t break it. It also quickly reformed thanks to the endless dark energy in the surroundings.

“Your saber really is amazing. It’s actually able to cut into my dark energy chains. Such a treasure is a waste in your hands. It’s more suited to me.” Ye Ming’s eyes fell on Evilmoon.

Evilmoon’s runes lit up. It began to absorb the energy of the prison. That energy had a certain connection to it.

Just at this moment, the Ghost Ship began to fly off in another direction.

“Hahaha, the Ghost Ship is leaving. Even with a divine weapon, you can’t escape my cage. You’ll die here,” laughed Ye Ming. His laughter grew louder as if he was exaggerating it to strike a blow on Long Chen’s confidence, as well as to let the others on the ship hear it.

“Long Chen, your power has dropped too much, restricting my power. It will take several breaths’ time to break this cage,” said Evilmoon.

Having absorbed the dragon source’s energy, Evilmoon had greatly weakened the seal on it, causing its power to soar.

However, even then, it was unable to release its full power without Long Chen’s aid.

The most worrisome thing was that Ye Ming was still there like a fish in water. He wasn’t afraid of the chaotic flow of space at all. Once the Ghost Ship left, Long Chen would be left here with Ye Ming.

“Space has already stabilized. I’ll use my strongest technique to decide victory.” Long Chen’s gaze was icy. A flame lotus slowly condensed in his hand.

“Impossible. In your current state, you can’t handle the backlash of the World Extermination Flame Lotus,” warned Evilmoon.

“If I can’t endure it, then he won’t be able to either.” Long Chen had overestimated Ye Ming. He had never thought that someone who had once become a god would be so contemptible. Long Chen couldn’t wait to kill him.

Just as the flame lotus appeared, a ball of flames began to grow intense within his primal chaos space. Those were the karmic hell flames he had taken from the Netherworld. Huo Linger had managed to absorb a trace of their power but was unable to truly absorb them.

Those karmic hell flames had been left as rations for Huo Linger. They were a priceless treasure, but Long Chen was prepared to use them.

The flame lotus slowly grew, turning blood-red. It was completely different from the normal flame lotus.

All its power was condensed within it, but when it appeared, the chaotic flow of space within this world clearly trembled.

Although it was just a subtle change that no one else sensed, Ye Ming did. He formed hand seals, strengthening his prison.

Looking at the flame lotus, he sneered, “No magical arts can be stable within this space, and the Heavenly Daos are also in chaos. Your resistance is futile. Your only chance is to use that weapon of yours to slowly exhaust me, but I already have everything under control. All of your options are foolish.”

Long Chen ignored Ye Ming’s mocking. He was only trying to rattle him. Although Ye Ming had once become a god, he was constantly putting on such an idiotic act. Most likely, it was to draw Mo Nian, Nangong Zuiyue, and Beitang Rushuang’s attention.

If they came over to save Long Chen, they would fall into his trap. Although such a scheme was very stupid, Long Chen was well aware of just how effective it could be. After all, he had jumped into it just now.

No matter how strong a person was, by grasping their weak point, a stupid scheme could still have a great effect.

The Ghost Ship was already far into the distance. Distorted sounds came from there as if something was happening.

Suddenly, a white figure appeared on top of the Ghost Ship. A giant anchor came flying back toward Long Chen. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

Divine light exploded on the Ghost Ship. The Daynight Furnace appeared, blocking the white figure. There was also a fight going on the Ghost Ship.

BOOM!

The anchor crashed into the black prison, and the prison instantly exploded. At the same time, Ye Ming’s hands were blasted apart, and he was shocked.

Just at that moment, a hand with a blood-red flame lotus on it silently smashed into his chest.
