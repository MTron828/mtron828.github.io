Chapter 4267 Activated Seven-Color Supreme Blood

When the primal chaos qi surged from the martial stage, Long Aotian underwent a transformation, much like a dragon returning to the sea or a tiger returning to the mountain forest. His aura was greatly enhanced.

His manifestation became a mass of primal chaos with the sun and moon revolving within it. From it, a sacred aura radiated, shaking the surroundings, and seven-colored ripples constantly scoured heaven and earth.

Long Aotian’s aura had completely transformed, emanating the presence of an undefeatable battle god that seemed to have transcended time to be present here.

Everyone was stunned to see him like this, including even the Long clan’s experts. They had no idea what had just happened.

Now, Long Aotian’s aura was dozens of times stronger than before. When the surge of primal chaos qi flooded the inside of the barrier, he fused with it to such an extent that, if one were unaware of his origins, they might even suspect him to be a sealed heavenly genius from the immemorial era.

Seven-colored divine radiance rippled, causing the world to appear as if it were ebbing and flowing along with it.

“Long Chen, do you see? This is the seven-color Supreme Blood after merging with primal chaos qi. It is one of the strongest bloodlines of the world and contains the power of metal, wood, water, fire, earth, light, and dark. Unfortunately, this world’s spiritual qi is sparse, and the primal chaos qi is almost gone. Thus, I have never managed to activate this seven-color Supreme Blood. Now though, the gate to another world has opened, and primal chaos qi is flooding this space, finally activating my seven-color Supreme Blood. Now, do you understand? I’m not afraid of you. I’ve simply been waiting for this chance to crush you in my strongest state.”

BOOM!

Long Aotian then slashed his sword, and a seven-colored ray of Sword Qi pierced the dome of the heavens, slashing a hole in the martial stage’s barrier.

Seeing this scene, countless people were stunned. Long Aotian actually possessed the power to destroy the barrier? Just how strong had he become?

With one stroke of his sword, Long Aotian shocked countless people. Long Aotian smiled, very pleased with himself. “So, do you feel resentment? Anger? This seven-color Supreme Blood was once yours, but it would have gone to waste in your hands. It can only display its true brilliance in my grasp.”

“What?!”

Countless startled cries rang out as they didn’t dare to believe what they were hearing. They then looked toward Long Chen. This seven-color Supreme Blood was originally Long Chen’s?

Then didn’t it mean that Long Aotian had ripped this Supreme Blood out of Long Chen’s body?

The experts of the High Firmament Academy, along with those who were familiar with Long Chen, gazed at him in utter disbelief. In the hearts of the academy’s disciples and the Starry River Sect’s experts, Long Chen was an undefeatable war god. It was beyond their wildest imagination that Long Aotian's seven-color Supreme Blood had been extracted from Long Chen. As a result, their emotions swirled in a tumult of shock, anger, and profound sorrow.

“Don’t be angry, the seven-color Supreme Blood would have gone to waste in your hands. My parents possessed remarkable foresight. Your Spirit Blood, Spirit Root, and Spirit Bone were all extracted immediately after your birth and implanted into my body. Now you also see just how wise their actions were. These treasures can only display their light in my body,” said Long Aotian arrogantly.

The current him seemed to be in no rush to kill Long Chen. Instead, he was soaking in the feeling of being far above Long Chen.

“How sinister!”

Bai Shishi’s mother couldn’t listen to this anymore. Long Aotian’s father and mother were so sinister that they were even willing to do such a thing to a newborn baby? Were they animals?

“I didn’t expect this child Long Chen to have such a sad childhood.” Bai Xiaole’s mother couldn’t help sighing. Looking at Long Chen’s back, she found that there were bitter tears of blood behind that staunch back.

He had no other choice but to be strong, for had he not been able to do so, he might not have survived to this day. His resilience and fortitude were born out of necessity.

To everyone’s surprise though, Long Chen didn’t reply to Long Aotian’s provocations and was staring blankly at the Minghong Saber in his hand. It was as if he couldn’t hear Long Aotian.

Long Aotian continued, “Do you know just how much effort the Long clan has put into perfectly awakening your Spirit Root? Almost half of their resources amassed over millions of years were used on me, and only then did your Spirit Blood, Spirit Root, and Spirit Bone spring to life. Yet, fully awakening them required an unimaginable amount of primal chaos qi. With the opening of this gate, my rise is set in stone. From this day onward, no one within the nine heavens and ten lands can compete with me. The ten thousand races will be forced to accept me as their master.”

Long Aotian’s voice resounded throughout heaven and earth, being domineering and wildly arrogant. Hearing it, most people were irked, but heaven and earth were resonating with his voice. It was like the world was changing due to his voice, as if it was turning him into the ruler of the world.

“A little brat also dares to spout such big words?! The human race really is too arrogant! Have you forgotten the time when your human race was only fit to be enslaved and preyed upon?”

Countless other races were enraged by Long Aotian’s arrogance, especially his declaration that they would all serve him. However, they could only voice their displeasure. Seeing that Long Aotian was surrounded by primal chaos qi and his terrifying aura was even spreading beyond the barrier, they were too intimidated to actually attack him. The current Long Aotian was absolutely terrifying.

“Long Chen, you trash, all your talents would have been wasted if not for me. Tell me, how do you want to die? Thanks to your contributions, I am willing to let you choose how you will die,” said Long Aotian as he pointed the Seven Peak Sword at Long Chen.

Nevertheless, as Long Aotian continued his boastful speech, Long Chen's attention remained fixed on the Minghong Saber. His gaze was one of mourning.

The Minghong Saber trembled incessantly, enveloped in an air of solemnity, almost as though it was begging Long Chen. Long Chen felt like his heart was stabbed as he looked at the Minghong Saber.

“Have you given up? You really don’t know how to appreciate kindness, so I guess that I’ll spare you for now. Instead, I’ll kill all your women first.” Long Aotian smiled sinisterly.

The next moment, the Seven Peak Sword lit up, and Long Aotian’s gaze instantly locked onto Meng Qi with a surge of sharp killing intent.

On the other hand, veins throbbed on Long Chen’s forehead as he gripped the Minghong Saber’s hilt. Suddenly, the Minghong Saber’s sheath on his back detonated in a burst of energy.

When it exploded, countless runes poured into the Minghong Saber, causing all the runes on its blade to light up. The next moment, a berserk battle intent erupted like a volcano.𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

The Minghong Saber’s sheath had always been its foundation for advancing. So, now that it exploded, the bottleneck that the Minghong Saber had never been able to break through was instantly blown away.

A resounding saber cry rent the heavens as the aura of an Eternal divine weapon burst forth from the Minghong Saber. It had at last attained that pinnacle, yet its unleashed power carried a poignant tragedy.

Long Chen moved as quickly as lightning, blocking Long Aotian’s back. Heaven and earth quivered as he raised his saber, projecting an aura of unparalleled dominance, a testament to the overwhelming might of both man and weapon.

BOOM!

The Minghong Saber then slashed down with a whistling gale.
