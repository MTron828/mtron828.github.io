Chapter 4323: Fleeing From Danger

“It’s that fellow from underwater!”

Guo Ran recognized him. The closest one to them was not one of the Eternal experts but the heavenly genius from the Kunpeng race.

At first, he was with the crowd, but now, he was gradually throwing them behind him as he got closer.

“Boss, he’ll catch up soon!” shouted Guo Ran.

“It’s the two of us slowing down boss’s speed.” Xia Chen’s expression also changed.

“Boss, put me down! I can use formation discs to block them and then leave with a formation!” shouted Xia Chen.

“What nonsense. If you get off, don’t even think about leaving alive. With the laws of space in chaos, how are you going to leave with a formation?” demanded Long Chen.

Xia Chen was clearly planning on sacrificing himself to slow them for a moment. Although Long Chen would be able to leave with Guo Ran, in that case, Xia Chen would definitely die.

Just then, the Kunpeng got even closer, and Xia Chen panicked. “Boss, we’re going to enter his attack range! His feathers are already shining! He’s preparing some big moves!”

That Kunpeng’s speed was even faster than before, and runes were blazing all across him.

“Don’t worry, he won’t rashly attack us as he’ll only have one chance. His speed will drop the moment he attacks, and if we dodge, he won’t have another chance to catch up to us,” said Long Chen.

Long Chen raced at his maximum speed, causing the very fabric of heaven and earth to distort around him. It was as if he had entered a tunnel of spacetime. Other than this heavenly genius from the Kunpeng race, the others had fallen far behind. It was no longer possible to see them. In other words, once they threw off this Kunpeng, they would have a chance to fully escape. Thus, Long Chen was sure that the Kunpeng would not launch a rash attack without being absolutely confident.

“Boss, is your speed dropping?! He’s getting closer!” shouted Guo Ran. Even through the spacetime channel, while everything else was blurry, that Kunpeng’s figure grew clearer and clearer.

“My speed isn’t dropping. He’s taking advantage of me breaking the flow of air, reducing the air resistance on him. That’s why it looks like he’s getting faster. If I was the one chasing him, I’d also be able to catch him like this. But there’s nothing we can do in our current position. Whoever is at the front is at a disadvantage,” said Long Chen.

“Then what can we do? Should we throw stuff at him?” asked Guo Ran.

Long Chen was dragging Guo Ran and Xia Chen by the arm as he flew through the air. It was difficult for them to endure. If they hadn’t gone through the primal chaos eye’s baptism, this immense pressure would have torn their bodies apart. However, while they were able to endure it now, there was no way that they could properly attack. They couldn’t even form hand seals.

“No need. We’re still a bit far, so he’ll dodge. Once he’s closer, he will launch a divine ability at us. At that moment, toss some useless Eternal divine weapons at him. With his speed, smashing into them should daze him,” said Long Chen.

Long Chen continued to fly at full speed, but the Kunpeng got closer and closer. Xia Chen and Guo Ran could now see the runes flickering in his eyes.

After all, their full attention was on his eyes. When those runes ignited, Xia Chen and Guo Ran’s souls quivered. They knew that they had been locked onto.

Without hesitation, they tossed out the divine weapons of other races that they had only kept for research value. There were sixteen of them, including sabers, spears, swords, halberds, hatchets, axes, hooks, and tridents. These divine weapons came from the devil race, the Ghost Dao, and even from the Underworld lifeforms.

The Kunpeng expert had begun gathering formidable energy in his mouth, but before he could unleash it, he caught sight of divine weapons hurtling toward him.

In response, his wings fluttered, creating numerous illusory images in the sky. He managed to evade seven of the incoming projectiles in rapid succession.

Nevertheless, a devil spear still found its mark in his chest. Though this spear had been thrown rather haphazardly by Xia Chen, it was the Kunpeng's own speed that amplified the impact. The divine weapon detonated after piercing him, creating a substantial cavity in his chest, sending feathers and blood scattering. Nnêw n0vel chapters are published on n0v/e/(lb)i(n.)co/m

As a result, the attack he had been preparing was abruptly interrupted, and he started to tumble through the air. His speed instantly plummeted.

In the blink of an eye, Long Chen disappeared beyond the horizon, vanishing from sight.

“We did it!”

Xia Chen and Guo Ran couldn't contain their joy. They hadn't anticipated that a simple maneuver would enable their escape.

It had to be known that they had been incredibly nervous just now. The experts pursuing them were truly formidable, and they had harbored a genuine belief that they might meet their end here. Yet, their getaway had been surprisingly straightforward.

“Xia Chen, prepare a formation disc. Once we reach the transportation node, activate it. I’m going to slow down,” said Long Chen.

Long Chen's incredible speed made it impossible to perform spatial transportation due to the chaotic nature of space at that moment. After all, to execute a successful spatial jump, they required a stable and calm spatial environment.

However, the dilemma lay in the fact that if they waited for the space to stabilize, the relentless pursuers would soon close the distance. If they didn't manage to initiate the spatial transportation before being overtaken, they would have no option but to flee once more.

Furthermore, it would be even harder to get away if they failed to perform the spatial transportation successfully. The Kunpeng expert would likely not fall for the same ruse twice. If he simply shadowed them closely without making any direct attacks, the aura he left behind would serve as a guide for the other experts in the humanless world to gradually encircle them. Then, they would be dead for sure.

Finally, Long Chen landed in a valley, and Xia Chen immediately activated a formation disc, his hand quivering. After all, this related to whether the three of them would survive or not. It would be a lie to say that he wasn’t nervous.

“Quick, quick, quick!”

Xia Chen fervently prayed as he activated the formation disc. Normally, this bit of time would be nothing. But now, every blink of an eye felt as long as hours.

Xia Chen had just activated the formation disc when the space in the distance began to collapse, a sign that the humanless world’s experts had caught up to them. Long Chen then grabbed Xia Chen and Guo Ran once more. If the spatial transportation didn’t activate in time, he would have to drag them away again.

“Die!”

Just then, those experts also noticed them and unleashed furious attacks. Beams of divine light tore through the world toward Long Chen, Xia Chen, and Guo Ran.

The area where the three of them had stood was instantly blasted out of existence, and a terrifying giant black hole manifested in its place.

Unfortunately for them, just before their attacks landed, the three humans had vanished into thin air.
