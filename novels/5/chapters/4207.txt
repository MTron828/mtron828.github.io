Chapter 4196 Dragon Claw

“Palace master, you called for me?”

Long Chen was shocked. The palace master was still in a meditative state, but he was talking to him.

“Give me a drop of dragon blood,” said the palace master.

“Oh. Alright!”

Long Chen flicked a drop of golden blood off of his finger, and it suddenly curved midway. Instead of going toward the palace master, it flew toward one of the characters on the bone stele he was facing.

As a result, that character brightened. Following that, the palace master’s aura changed and battle intent erupted out of him.

But all of a sudden, the palace master spat out blood, startling Long Chen.

“Palace master, are you alright?!”

“Hahaha!” The palace master laughed, his eyes ablaze with battle intent resembling a fervent fire. He didn’t respond and continued to meditate.

After a while, he spat out blood once more, but then he reabsorbed it.

Every time he spat out blood, his face was covered in delight, as if he enjoyed this feeling.

“What is going on?”

Long Chen couldn’t figure it out. Just what was the palace master doing?

However, since the latter didn’t speak, he didn’t ask about it. Long Chen then continued comprehending the other immortal characters. All of a sudden, he looked at one of the characters on the bone stele in front of the palace master. There weren’t that many there, and the characters were drawn crudely.

“Dragon claw?!”

As he looked at one particular character, these two words instinctively escaped his lips. It was as if, upon observing that character, he was seized by a sudden insight and naturally uttered its name.

Furthermore, the moment Long Chen read it, he naturally hooked his fingers into the form of a dragon claw.

“Could it be that this dragon bone stele has the record of the dragon race’s best techniques?”

Long Chen was delighted by this discovery. He directly abandoned the other immortal characters and focused on this one.

When Long Chen’s mind sank into a certain stroke of this character, a sudden sharp astral wind accompanied by an overwhelming sense of imminent danger surged around him.

The next moment, the dragon scale armor on Long Chen’s chest shattered, causing blood to spray forth. He was blown back, smashing into the wall, and stars spun in his vision from the powerful impact.

Long Chen was shocked and then glanced down at his chest. He saw that his chest looked like it had been clawed. Without the dragon armor protecting him, he’d have been torn apart by this terrifying attack.

“What is going on?”

Long Chen was dumbfounded as he didn’t know what had just happened. The moment he entered that world, an intense sensation of danger made him instinctively leave.

It had to be known that Long Chen’s physical body was incomparably powerful after being guided through the Dragon Soul Body Forging Art by the dragon expert. Furthermore, he was in the Dragon King Battle Armor state. Even a World King divine item would not be able to harm in the slightest.

However, such terrifying defenses were torn through like paper in front of that attack. It was quite the blow for Long Chen.

Fortunately, Long Chen had an immense amount of life energy in the primal chaos space to draw on, and his wounds instantly healed.

As for the blood that had sprayed out of him, he recalled it. Although he was injured, it didn’t affect him.

Gathering the blood was something he was inspired to do by the palace master. Seeing the palace master surrounded by a layer of divine radiance, it seemed that he was surrounded by a barrier of fresh blood. The blood that he spat out would automatically be gathered, resulting in him taking no loss.

Long Chen tried to comprehend that immortal character once more and entered that strange space again. This time, he was prepared, and the moment he entered, he summoned his Kunpeng wings.

As a result, Long Chen once more shot back, his chest subjected to another vicious clawing. This time, the impact was so severe that Long Chen almost coughed up blood.

In that strange space, when he tried to summon the Kunpeng wings, he was shocked to find that he couldn’t. Furthermore, he barely saw a claw appear before he was struck.

“Perhaps it is forbidden to use other divine abilities in that space,” concluded Long Chen.

“Again!”

Long Chen once more tried it. This time, he raised his focus to the absolute peak and saw the claw clearly.

BOOM!

Long Chen let out a grunt. His own claw was almost blasted apart by this dragon claw. However, what he saw this time left him astonished—it was a golden dragon claw. Moreover, its aura resonated in the Immortal King realm, much like his own. In other words, this was the claw of a dragon king.

However, despite being in the same realm, despite it being the same dragon claw, Long Chen’s dragon claw was like a chicken claw in front of it.

Just then, the space beside him quivered. He let out a roar, and without hesitation, sent out a kick.

“Divine Dragon Pendulum Tail!”

BOOM!

Long Chen's timing was impeccable, and he delivered a powerful kick to the dragon claw that materialized beside him. In return, he experienced a searing pain in his foot, as it was almost blown apart by this claw.

Buzz.

Just then, Long Chen felt a terrifying sensation of death envelop him.

He instantly retreated from this space, feeling something wet on his forehead. It was his blood.nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

In an instant, Long Chen found himself covered in cold sweat. His scalp had been torn open. Any delay, and his head would have been destroyed.

“How can this be? No matter how strong a true dragon is, it’s still just in the dragon king realm! If the realm is the same, how is there such a difference?!” Long Chen looked at his bloody palm and foot. He couldn’t believe it.

Ever since he had cultivated the Dragon Soul Body Forging Art, his physical body had reached a point where he could look down on the rest of the world. Even the demonic beast race that was so proud of their physical strength couldn’t compare to him.

However, today, Long Chen was given a ruthless blow. In front of a true dragon, he was unable to endure a single blow.

“That is the true dragon from the primal chaos era. Born from primal chaos, it possesses a physical body that can be described as perfect. It cannot be compared to a true dragon of the current era,” said the dragon expert suddenly.

This explanation made Long Chen feel much better. After all, the era and the laws were different. It wasn’t that Long Chen wasn’t outstanding enough; rather, he had missed that golden era.

“However, even if it is the true dragon of the primal chaos era, you possess my unique Dragon Soul Body Forging Art. Your power is not inferior to it. The reason you are losing is because you are stupid and careless. I thought that you were smart before, but now I find that I was wrong,” said the dragon expert irritably.

“What?”

Long Chen was startled. Just how had he been stupid and careless?

The dragon expert remained silent, a hint of disappointment and anger emanating from its presence. It seemed to be telling him to figure it out himself.

Since Long Chen couldn’t figure it out, he could only take a deep breath and try again. Once more, he entered the world inside the immortal character.
