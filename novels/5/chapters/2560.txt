Chapter 2549 Ye Liangchen

One day ago, on the Martial Heaven Continent, where the Central Plains’ Southern and Western Xuan Regions met, space began to shudder. After that, a giant spatial door appeared in the air.

This door was closed shut, but rumbling spread from it along with a violent aura. The entire Central Plains could sense the terrifying world energy.

This was the ninth day since the disciples of the Martial Heaven Continent had entered the Star Field Divine World. Although it was just nine days, those nine days had felt exceptionally long for them.

The various experts of the continent rushed over to the spatial door when it appeared. The Martial Heaven Alliance, Pill Valley, the Corrupt path, the ancient races, the ancient family alliance, the Xuan Beasts, all the seniors of the various powers gathered.

“Hm? It seems there are fewer elders of the Martial Heaven Alliance now.”

“Wait, check their auras!”

When Qu Jianying, the old man, Li Tianxuan, and the other elders of the Martial Heaven Alliance appeared, the others were startled.

The others found that their auras had reached the fourth step of Netherpassage, but they had also lost a few familiar faces. It had to be known that at this time, all the elders would come out to welcome their disciples back.

“I heard that the Martial Heaven Alliance’s elders used medicinal pills to forcibly attack the fourth step of Netherpassage. A portion of them died from it,” whispered someone.

“How ruthless. Their lives had reached the limit, yet they still forcibly tried to break through. The odds of failure are way too high.”

“Hmph, a group of foolish idiots. At least a bunch of them have died.” While everyone else was just whispering, one person spoke loudly. It was clearly intentional.

“The sea demon race?”

An army of millions of sea demons was flying over. They had intentionally summoned their true bodies, making them as big as mountains.

They had three leaders in human form, and the one at the very front had a golden crown. It was an icy-faced elder.

Six golden horns were protruding through his crown. His eyes shone like lanterns, and divine light came out whenever they opened. This old man seemed to be one with heaven and earth.

“Someone above Netherpassage!”

Everyone’s heart shook. The sea demon race had actually sent out an expert above Netherpassage, and not just one. It seemed that the other two had reached the same level. The other two were bald, with their heads being exceptionally glossy. Moreover, they had tortoise shells on their backs and strange lines on their faces.

Standing there, the two of them also seemed to be one with heaven and earth. It felt as if a look from them could destroy the world.

“They sent out three experts above Netherpassage at once? What is the sea demon race planning? Is this a display of power?”

The sea demon race was insulting the Martial Heaven Alliance so openly. They clearly hadn’t come with good intentions.

“Courting death!” the old man shouted furiously. The millions of Righteous experts were just as angry as him.

After all, those seniors of the Martial Heaven Alliance had bet their own lives in order to have some use on the battlefield in the future. Every one of them was a hero.

For the sea demon race to mock those fallen seniors instantly provoked them. They were far too arrogant, the particularly brainless kind of arrogant.

“Calm down!” Qu Jianying grabbed the old man. The old man had also advanced to the fourth step, but he had relied on his own power to reach this level, not medicinal pills.

Having only recently advanced, his aura wasn’t stable yet, so he was particularly easy to anger at this time. Nonetheless, the old man’s temper had always been bad, so if it wasn’t for Qu Jianying holding him back, he would have attacked just now.

“A group of ants. You’ll be dying in the upcoming battles of the dark era. Your struggles are futile,” said one of the bald elders with the tortoise shell on his back. The previous mocking had also come from him.

“The Martial Heaven Alliance is so lacking. They didn’t even bring out a single person above Netherpassage, throwing away the face of such a large power. The Martial Heaven Alliance has truly fallen. What? We’re talking about you, do you disagree?” The other bald elder spoke up as well.

The two of them looked identical, and even the way they spoke was the same.

“Fuck, do you think that tortoise shell will protect you? Get your ass over here and I’ll break that damn shell!” roared the old man.

The bald elders smiled coldly. They were about to step forward when the elder with the golden crown snorted. “What is there to fight about with a Netherpassage rookie? Don’t lose face.”

The two bald elders stopped and glanced at the old man.

“Count yourself lucky, or you wouldn’t even be qualified to see the battle of the dark era. I don’t mind telling you the truth. Our young master will obtain the Sea God’s inheritance once making his breakthrough in the Star Field Divine World. Furthermore, once he breaks through to the thirteenth rank, his divine bone will awaken and he will be able to summon the true body of the Sea God. At that time, all of you will be beneath him. Not one person will be a match for him, and even Sovereign sprouts will only be green leaves compared to him. Perhaps most of you people will have a chance to surrender, but Long Chen will definitely be killed.”Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

“Even a Sovereign sprout will become a green leaf? What arrogant words. Are you not afraid of choking on such big words?”

Just at this moment, an icy voice rang out. That voice was surprisingly young in this place that was filled with seniors. However, despite being young, it created a resonance with heaven and earth.

Startled, everyone looked over to see a golden war chariot rushing over. It was like a golden shooting star.

The war chariot’s runes were shining, making it look like a blazing sun. It was too bright to look at directly.

When the runes of the war chariot slowly faded, they realized that there were tens of thousands of warriors on it, all adorned in silver armor. Every one of them was unleashing a heavy killing intent and a bloody air.

This killing intent was not something that could be trained. It was the result of experiencing countless slaughters, from walking out of a mountain of corpses and a sea of blood.

There was a white-robed man standing at the front of the war chariot. Upon seeing him, everyone jumped.

He had a third vertical eye, but that eye was closed. However, just looking at it made people feel their goosebumps exploding. A sense of immense danger filled their hearts.

Just standing there, Heavenly Dao energy whirled around him, as if wishing for him to use it. This was a shocking phenomenon where the Heavenly Daos were throwing themselves at him to use. This was something that the people here had never seen before.

“So what if he summons the Sea God’s true body? This place is the Martial Heaven Continent, and a Sovereign could suppress him with a wave of his hand. If you don’t like it, then once your king comes out, I, Ye Liangchen, will be willing to give a display for you to understand,” said the white-robed man, his hands clasped behind him. Even in the face of the elder with the golden crown, he didn’t show the slightest emotion.

“Hmph, the Sovereign sprout of the Ye family is quite arrogant. Right now, the Heavenly Daos are muddled, and a Sovereign has yet to appear. Who knows whether or not a Sovereign will even appear in this era? Youngsters shouldn’t be so arrogant. My race is the Sea God’s descendants and we are fated to rise during this era. The will of the heavens cannot be disobeyed. If you say such big words, you won’t be able to take them back later. You will lose quite a bit of face then,” said the crowned elder with a faint smile. It seemed that he already knew Ye Liangchen’s status, but he didn’t care.

“The Six Horn Sea Serpent race’s divine abilities can only show their full potential upon reaching the thirteenth rank. Fine, I’ll give you a chance. When your so-called king reaches the thirteenth rank, I’ll crush him.” Ye Liangchen snorted.

“Foolish brat, do you know who you’re talking to?” demanded one of the bald elders.

After that, Ye Liangchen glanced at him. All of a sudden, his third eye opened and the void shuddered.

As a result, blood spurted out of the bald elder’s chest. At some point, a giant cut had appeared there. The bald elder then stared at Ye Liangchen in shock.

“A slave thinks he can talk here? If you dare to be noisy again, even if you have your master standing beside you, I’ll still kill you,” said Ye Liangchen. His third eye was already closed.

The bald elder was shocked and infuriated, but he didn’t dare to speak.

Everyone was stunned, not knowing what had happened. Ye Liangchen had simply opened his third eye. He hadn’t even moved, but it was as if the bald elder had been struck by a sword.

That elder was an existence above Netherpassage. Considering that he came from a tortoise race, his defensive power must be astounding. Hence, the fact that he was silently injured was horrifying.

Ye Liangchen was clearly in the Netherpassage realm, but he was able to injure the bald elder easily.

The old man, Qu Jianying, and the others were stunned. Ye Liangchen seemed even more terrifying than Feng Fei. Why didn’t such a figure enter the Star Field Divine World? Was it because he felt it wasn’t worth it?

“Youngster, don’t be too arrogant. If it wasn’t due to your youth, I wouldn’t be so courteous,” said the crowned elder angrily.

“Due to my youth? Please. It’s because of the divine families, isn’t it? Take care of your dog and tell it not to make noise when its master is conversing. Otherwise, it will lose you face,” sneered Ye Liangchen.

After that, Ye Liangchen didn’t give him a chance to respond. He already turned his gaze to Qu Jianying.

“I hear that the Martial Heaven Continent has a little fellow who is so arrogant as to not place even the divine families in his eyes? The reason I deigned to descend here was to suppress him. I’m saying this so you’re mentally prepared.”

Qu Jianying was shocked, as well as enraged. This expert had actually come to suppress Long Chen? The divine families had truly gone too far.

“Ye Liangchen, if you’re going to say that, then you’re not giving me, Long Aotian, any face.”

An arrogant voice rang out along with a thunderous roar. After that, they could see a giant beast flying through the air.
