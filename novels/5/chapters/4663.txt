Chapter 4652 Easily Passing Tribulation

The Dragonblood warriors refrained from summoning their Dragon Blood Battle Armors to conserve their energy, yet to their surprise, they somehow appeared on their own.

A surge of dragon might erupted, resonating with their bloodlines. In a mesmerizing display, the lightning beasts around them started to explode before the Dragonblood warriors could even touch them.

The lightning runes from these beasts were automatically absorbed by the dragon scales. Like voracious predators, their dragon scales eagerly devoured the lightning.

‚ÄúBoss, this is...?‚Äù

The Dragonblood warriors were dumbfounded and didn‚Äôt move, simply allowing their scales to absorb this lightning. They didn‚Äôt even need to do anything.

‚ÄúWhat is going on?‚Äù asked Long Chen as well.

The Earth Cauldron replied, ‚ÄúThe Sovereign blood has awoken and is absorbing the thunderforce to strengthen itself. After all, the advancement of Sovereign blood requires an enormous amount of energy. The Dragonblood warriors weren‚Äôt fast enough, so the dragon souls took over,‚Äù

Hearing that, Long Chen sighed with relief. However, a hint of horror immediately tainted his face. In a panic, he shouted, ‚ÄúGuo Ran, don‚Äôt let your dragon soul control your Dragon Blood Battle Armor! If you don‚Äôt stop it, you‚Äôll become an iron turtle!‚Äù

An iron turtle was an existence with great defensive power but zero offensive power. If the hidden dragon‚Äôs dragon soul were to take over, Guo Ran would be doomed to such a fate.

Guo Ran jumped in fright at that warning and hastily formed hand seals, trying to wrestle control of the Dragon Blood Battle Armor from the hidden dragon‚Äôs dragon soul.

Although defense was important, he didn‚Äôt want to be an iron turtle. How could he have the face to lead the Dragonblood Legion if he became one?

The hidden dragon's dragon soul had already directed Guo Ran‚Äôs Dragon Soul Body Forging Art to prioritize defense. However, before undergoing the baptism of heavenly tribulation, Guo Ran still had a chance to wrestle back some power on offense. This moment marked his sole chance to shed the role of a mere iron turtle.

With that in mind, Guo Ran engaged in a fierce battle against the hidden dragon‚Äôs dragon soul, channeling every ounce of his power. Meanwhile, everyone else had it easy. Their dragon souls rapidly absorbed the power of the tribulation.

Yue Zifeng, Yu Qingxuan, Bai Shishi, and Bai Xiaole were sitting in the air, silently comprehending the laws of the Heavenly Daos contained within this tribulation. With the blessing of the dragon souls, everything was under control.

The lightning beasts continued to emerge from the tribulation clouds, and they grew increasingly powerful. However, the Dragonblood warriors didn‚Äôt even need to bother with them. Upon drawing near, they would be destroyed by the power of the dragon souls.

Every single one of the Dragonblood warriors had absorbed a drop of dragon blood from the Sovereign clan‚Äôs expert. As the dragon blood came from the same source, even though it was split among them, they were resonating, essentially forming a dragon blood formation.

These ferocious lightning beasts were like fireflies drawn to a flame, approached only to be swiftly transformed into lightning runes and absorbed into the formation.

No matter how strong the lightning beasts grew, they were unable to threaten the Dragonblood warriors. After all, their Dragon Blood Battle Armor was constantly growing stronger by absorbing their power. Checkk new ùíèovel chùíÇpters at novùíÜlbin(.)com

Their new scales rapidly strengthened. At first, the newly formed scales looked as thin as a cicada‚Äôs wing, as if one touch would shatter them. However, as they absorbed the thunderforce, these scales rapidly thickened, while their auras and imposing presence grew in tandem.

At the same time, marks started to emerge on top of them, and various changes appeared in the Dragonblood warriors‚Äô scaled armor.

The size, shape, patterns, auras, and other aspects of their scale armor were changing bit by bit. Some Dragonblood warriors had long and thin dragon scales, while others had short and thick ones.

Despite having the same dragon blood, each warrior had taken in a distinct dragon soul, thus steering the trajectory of their Dragon Soul Body Forging Art along unique paths.

Over two hours passed. The lightning beasts continued to grow stronger and larger, but they still couldn‚Äôt touch the Dragonblood warriors.

At this moment, the dragon blood formation had taken visible form, and people could see thousands of dragons roving around them.

Suddenly, the heavenly tribulation underwent a drastic change. The lightning beasts dissipated, replaced by the apparitions of ancient figures. Clad in ancient robes and holding divine weapons, they were filled with immemorial auras and killing intent.

Yet, as soon as these spectral figures materialized, they launched an assault on the dragon blood formation, only to be swiftly blasted out of existence.

They were not much weaker than each Dragonblood warrior. According to the pattern of their past tribulations, a fierce and bloody battle would typically ensue in order to vanquish them.

However, with the Dragonblood warriors‚Äô power consolidated within the formation, a formidable barrier manifested around them, rendering the powerful entities unable to breach their defenses.

Sensing the protection of their united strength, they closed their eyes and entered a meditative state. In this tranquil state, they were communing with their dragon souls, working together to deduce their future paths.

The Dragon Soul Body Forging Art was such a profound technique that even the mysterious dragon expert itself was unable to pass it down successfully. However, Long Chen had charted an alternative path, passing it down to the Dragonblood warriors. Now, in harmony with their dragon souls, they explored the possibilities of forging their own distinct paths. At this moment, their collective effort was nothing short of magnificent.

Seeing the Dragonblood warriors‚Äô scales grow stronger, their auras heavier, and their pressure like a vast sea, Long Chen was filled with excitement.

After this tribulation, the Dragonblood Legion would definitely shake the world, their name resounding throughout the nine heavens.

Time passed bit by bit. After two hours, the immemorial people vanished, replaced by lightning weapons.

Absolutely enormous warhammers, heaven-slashing divine swords, and world-piercing spears‚Äîcountless weapons descended toward the Dragonblood Legion like they were cabbages. Each strike carried a supreme divine might that even Long Chen found terrifying. It was strong enough to threaten a weak Sage King, and even Long Chen would have to use his full power to block them all.

Furthermore, they were not coming one at a time but surged forth in the thousands. Seeing this scene, Long Chen felt a chill.

Yet, amidst the chaos, Long Chen recognized the unique nature of this tribulation. The tribulation clouds were already dispersing, signaling its imminent end.

As the lightning weapons collided with the Dragonblood Legion, the warriors trembled. Cracks marred their once-impenetrable scales, and blood oozed out of their wounds.

These lightning weapons were even more destructive than Long Chen had expected, but the Dragonblood warriors were still able to withstand them. They continued to absorb the lightning runes with all their power, showing that they hadn‚Äôt reached their limits yet. They were still rapidly advancing.

For six hours, the onslaught persisted. As the Dragonblood warriors endured, their scales continued to grow stronger. A layer of violet light appeared on the edges of their scale armor, enhancing their already majestic appearance.

BOOM!

With a heaven-shaking explosion, an enormous dragon claw tore through the tribulation clouds and crashed toward the Dragonblood Legion.

Long Chen‚Äôs eyes narrowed to pinpoints at the sight of this enormous dragon claw.
