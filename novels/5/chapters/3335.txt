Chapter 3324 Who Dares to Touch My Feather Race?!

The human experts pounced upon the dark lifeforms. Seeing this, the disciples that had returned to the side of their elders and had essentially retreated from the competition for the Heavenly Rainbow Flame grew anxious.

If they couldn’t obtain the rainbow hydrangeas, then killing a few dark lifeforms was also good. Even in their old age, they could tell their children and grandchildren that they had slain those dark lifeforms. That was a glorious achievement.

Hence, those disciples joined the battlefield once more. As for their elders, some of them were about to join in as well. After all, killing dark lifeforms was a matter relating to the entire human race.

However, an Immortal King said, “This is a battlefield for youngsters. We old fellows shouldn’t interfere. It’s a rare chance for them to temper themselves. Let them kill the devils. True experts are made on the battlefield. Such an opportunity is far too rare.”

Of course, this opportunity was rare. Let alone these youngsters, even amongst the senior experts here, only a few of them had ever seen a dark lifeform before.

All their knowledge of the dark lifeforms came from ancient books and murals. In the current era, it was almost impossible to see them.

Although these Immortal Kings also wanted to join in, not wanting to kill them but capture a few alive to study, with that person saying this, they would be embarrassed to join in and steal glory from their juniors.

After all, the human experts outnumbered the dark lifeforms a hundred to one. Outside of the barrier, the dark lifeforms were outside of the influence of their spatial gates, and they were suppressed by the immortal world’s laws. So, their combat power was less than half of their usual, and they were unable to create any big waves.

Bai Xiaole’s shout drew in countless human experts. As if afraid that they would get there too late, people charged forward crazily. Blood and flesh flew through the air. The dark lifeforms fought back, but it was useless. They were outnumbered and overpowered. Now, the human race’s experts became fiends demanding their lives.

It wasn’t just the devil race and the lifeforms of the Netherworld. There were other lifeforms covered in black qi that had been brought by other experts. People didn’t recognize their origins, and they didn’t say where they were from.

But no matter where they were from, as long as they had that dark aura on them, they were indiscriminately slaughtered.

Some of the human experts even cut off their heads and hung them on their waists as spoils of battle. That would be what they used to brag about in the future.

Some of them were very powerful and instantly racked up multiple heads on their waists. But some also came too late. There were many human experts, and there were no gaps for them to join the battle through. They almost started fighting their comrades just to get to those dark lifeforms.

As they saw that there was no way for them to get in, they directly chose to be shameless, picking up some corpses on the ground. In any case, no one knew who killed what. The battle was so chaotic that they could easily pass the corpses off as their own kill.

As long as they brought back those corpses and said that these corpses were killed by them, they would be able to brag about this battle in the future.

Those dark lifeforms roared furiously and tried to return to the barrier, but Long Chen was still unleashing qi waves. His aura was crazily climbing. So, they would always be blown back out. If they forcibly tried to stay in, they would be directly crushed by the pressure.

They despaired. Ahead of them was a monster crazily unleashing his aura, Long Chen. Behind them was an endless human army that was like a pack of hungry wolves. There was nowhere for them to go and nothing they could do.

They howled and roared as they fought back, but they were unaware that their voices were unable to reach inside the barrier. They were begging for help from their experts, but those experts were completely focused on Long Chen, unable to hear them.

The dark lifeforms began to flee miserably, but there were too many humans. They could not flee. One brave and powerful devil expert charged back into the barrier, but before he could even shout for help, he was instantly crushed by Long Chen’s aura.

However, his sudden appearance did draw their attention. Only then did they see that their subordinates were being slaughtered by the human race.

The spatial gate behind Mo Yan shuddered. A giant hand then reached out toward the outside of the barrier.

Seeing that, an Immortal King directly activated a King item and attacked that hand. Although these elders weren’t participating in this battle, they were still wary. After all, their descendants were fighting.

BOOM!

The hand and the King item clashed, emitting an explosion of light. As a result, the King item was sent flying, while its master coughed up blood. In that one attack, he was injured and his King item was destroyed. Its runes faded, stunning the spectators.

However, despite their shock, over ten more King items attacked as well. In order to save their disciples, they were even willing to let their King items be damaged. They had to stop that hand.

The giant hand quivered from the impact of the first King item. Suddenly, countless black chains shot out of it, wrapping around the devil experts that were being hunted down, dragging them back into the barrier.

The human experts grew anxious upon seeing the meat that had just been about to enter their mouths run. The late ones who had activated photographic jades to record them mightily killing these dark lifeforms were the most panicked. Ignoring everything else, they wanted to stop them from fleeing. Their weapons slashed toward them.

“Don’t!” Bai Xiaole suddenly shouted. With his Three Flower Pupils, he could see things that others couldn’t. Those black chains were made out of millions of runes. They contained a terrifying power.

Just as Bai Xiaole shouted, the Immortal Kings also shouted. Those black chains couldn’t be dodged.

Some people managed to stop themselves, but a few people were too anxious, and their weapons slammed into those devil experts.

A black curtain then appeared around those experts. Their weapons struck those curtains, and then their bodies and weapons disintegrated. It was completely silent. They simply died.

Seeing those people vanish, the other disciples stopped in horror and cold sweat dripped down them. This danger came far too suddenly. If it hadn’t been for Bai Xiaole’s warnings, they might have died just like them.

Just at this moment, spatial gates lit up within the barrier. Whirlpools appeared and tentacles stretched out, dragging the dark lifeforms into the spatial gates.

The human experts no longer dared to stop them. They fled as far as they could. The dark lifeforms were dragged back into their respective spatial gates. As a result, people’s gazes fell toward the other races remaining. Their gazes were still that of a sinister wolf.

That was because these other races had also killed quite a few human experts in the competition for the rainbow hydrangeas. The Feather race in particular had been the most ferocious. Previously, the human experts had only been killing the dark lifeforms. But now that they were gone, these other races were all that remained.

Seeing those hostile gazes, the Feather race’s experts felt a chill.

“Anyone who dares to touch a single hair on the people of my Feather race will regret coming to this world. I, Kun Wu, swear this!”

Just then, Kun Wu’s icy voice rang out. He had finally returned after being sent flying into the distance.

Just as he said this, a giant saber-image slashed toward him. It came incredibly suddenly. As a result, Kun Wu’s expression completely changed.

This attack came from Long Chen. It pierced through space, falling toward this place.
