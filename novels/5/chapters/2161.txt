Chapter 2151 The Corrupt God Cemetery

A handsome man with a bow was walking through the air gracefully. His every move possessed the air of an expert. Unfortunately, the trace of baby fat left on his face and the unconcealable shamelessness in his eyes broke that image.

This person was someone that Long Chen hadn’t seen in a long time, Mo Nian. Mo Nian swaggered over. Just the way he walked made people feel an urge to slap him.

Mo Nian’s arrival caused a huge ruckus. It was like cold water had been thrown into a pot of boiling oil. Countless people glared at him while clenching their teeth furiously. They looked like they wanted to tear him apart.

“Ten years I wandered with my bow, my arrows causing heaven and earth to shake. The nine heavens, ten lands, and all the universe will revolve around me. Only I, Mo Nian, will rise to glory.” Mo Nian recited his shameless phrase once more. Hearing it gave Long Chen goosebumps.

“Fuck you, Mo Nian, I’ll kill you!” One of the ancient family alliance’s experts pounced at Mo Nian like a vicious wolf. His eyes were completely red.

The experts of the ancient family alliance weren’t the only ones infuriated by his appearance. Almost half of the experts present charged toward him. It was a shocking sight.

“Mo Nian, you irredeemable fiend, how dare you rob my family’s ancestral tomb?! I’ll tear you to pieces!”

“Mo Nian, I’ll eat your flesh, drink your blood, and grind your bones to dust!”

“Mo Nian, your evil deeds have brought your death today!”

Those experts looked so angry that it was a bit frightening. It was like they were seeing the person that had slain their father.

“He is Mo Nian?” asked Beitang Rushuang. “I heard the two of you are brothers. You’re really just as bad as each other. You’re surrounded by enemies throughout the world, while he’s detested by everyone. You two are a perfect match.”

Beitang Rushuang had very accurate information about everyone relevant on the Martial Heaven Continent. An everlasting family naturally had to be up to date. Mo Nian in particular was a marvel. After all, it could be considered an unprecedented miracle throughout the Martial Heaven Continent’s history that a person could rob so many people’s ancestral tombs without being killed.

“I feel like I’m a bit better than him. At the very least, I’m not hated to this extent.” Long Chen rubbed his chin. Based on the reactions to their arrivals, he should be one level better. At the very least, he hadn’t been attacked by half the experts present.

“Hmph, a wild mob dares to speak such arrogant words?”

Mo Nian snorted. He waved his hand through the air, and a slender thread appeared in the air like a bowstring.

Upon seeing that, Beitang Rushuang’s disdainful expression became one of shock. “The earth is my bow, the heavens are my string? Has he actually reached this realm?”

Mo Nian plucked the string. The void shuddered, and a ripple blew back the experts pouncing toward him.

With just a wave of his hand, he blew back tens of thousands of experts like they were rotten wood. For a moment, everyone was stuck in stunned silence.

Soaking in everyone’s shocked gazes, Mo Nian clasped his hands behind him and solemnly said, “I don’t want to kill people, so don’t force me. As for your ancestor’s graves, that’s because your ancestors once committed grave sins against my Mo Gate. Enmities naturally have to be avenged, but as an upright person, I don’t feel like misplacing blame. Your ancestors are the ones who made mistakes, so I haven’t placed any enmity on you. Is getting justice from your ancestors underground wrong?”

“You robbed our tombs, brought the corpses into the sun, and stole all the funerary objects! Mo Nian, how can you be so shameless as to make it sound righteous?!” Roars of fury rang out.

“Cough, you can’t put it like that. Vengeance has interest too. After so much time, I naturally had to get some interest. Taking some of those things was simply correct. As for bringing your ancestors out into the sun, you can’t blame me. In the Yin Yang World, you shamelessly attacked me. Long Chen might be a pushover, but I’m not. We originally had an agreement that he would kill the living while I dug up the dead, but even after I dug up everyone, Long Chen didn’t manage to kill more than a few before stopping. Long Chen, you coward, you were conning me, weren’t you?” In the end, Mo Nian shouted at Long Chen, drawing everyone’s attention to Long Chen.

What? When had he agreed to that? Mo Nian was digging up people’s tombs to restore the power of the Five Element Sun Hunting Bow, but now he made it sound like it was all for Long Chen. Too shameless.

“Long Chen, you’re also trash! The two of you are scourges of the Martial Heaven Continent, and sooner or later, you’ll face your miserable deaths!” One of the ancient race experts was shouting, but before people could understand what was happening, Mo Nian waved a hand and that expert collapsed, a hole in his head.

That person was a powerful Empyrean who, based on his aura, had awakened his manifestation. But in front of Mo Nian, he didn’t have any ability to resist.

In fact, the experts present didn’t even grasp what kind of attack Mo Nian had just launched. The furious experts fell silent, no longer daring to casually curse them.

“You can curse me, but you can’t insult my brother or you’ll die!” Mo Nian snorted and walked over to Long Chen.

Long Chen clapped his forehead as he suddenly realized that Mo Nian was using him as an excuse to kill someone and show off his power. Furthermore, he actually put Long Chen in his debt by doing so. This fellow’s shamelessness far surpassed his combat power.

The death of that ancient race expert was done in such a way that the other experts didn’t dare to say a word in response, afraid that they would be the next.

“Haha, it’s been a while.” Mo Nian walked over. Long Chen helplessly extended his arms for a hug, but unexpectedly, this fellow went right past him and toward Beitang Rushuang. Long Chen’s movements stiffened.

“Aiya!” After being conned, Long Chen silently extended a leg, tripping Mo Nian, causing Mo Nian to tumble toward Beitang Rushuang.

A runic arrow appeared in Beitang Rushuang’s hand. It was pointed straight at Mo Nian’s heart. Mo Nian’s arms were originally spread for a hug, but now they were raised into the air.

“Do I know you?” Beitang Rushuang looked up and down Mo Nian.

“Ah, I’ve long since heard of fairy Rushuang’s great name, so we can count as friends!” said Mo Nian awkwardly, slowly backing up.

“What a shifty-eyed fool. Both of you are rotten eggs.” Beitang Rushuang snorted and put away her runic arrow.

“Cough, serves you right, cough.” Long Chen had a sudden coughing fit.

“Long Chen, that’s where you’re wrong. I’m taking a break from my research of archaeology to help you out, but you laugh at my misfortune? Doesn’t your conscience hurt?” asked Mo Nian.

“Give it up. I feel like if you didn’t come, at least half the people here wouldn’t make a move against me,” said Long Chen. As soon as Mo Nian arrived, he sensed profound hostility from others. Their hatred for Mo Nian had now spread to him. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“Hehe, good brothers should share,” chortled Mo Nian. He pulled Long Chen to the side and whispered, “Are you interested in doing something big with me?”

“What? Is there some big business?” asked Long Chen.

“Yes, a supreme bit of business. Through my years of graverobbing- cough, I mean archaeology, after so many years of archaeology, I’ve accumulated experience. I’ve gone through the tombs of the various large powers. I no longer feel the challenge. That’s why I’m planning on something harder, something that will allow my archaeology skills to advance to a new level,” said Mo Nian mysteriously.

“Stop saying so many useless things and get to the important part. What are you planning?”

“I want to go rob the Corrupt God Cemetery,” said Mo Nian.

Even Long Chen didn’t expect Mo Nian to have set his sights on the Corrupt God Cemetery. That was the most mysterious of the Martial Heaven Continent’s seven danger zones. It was also the one that people knew the least about.

This danger zone was in the Corrupt God’s world. Legend had it that the experts that obtained the Corrupt God’s special care were qualified to be buried there, but as for what exactly was inside, no one knew. In fact, it was unknown whether it really existed or not.

“Are you being serious? You’ve found the Corrupt God Cemetery?” asked Long Chen.

“Of course I’m serious. I’ve found the entrance to the Corrupt God Cemetery, but I’m not confident enough to go on my own. I’m thinking that when we all have time, let’s go with Xia Chen and Guo Ran. We can go for a stroll in the Corrupt God Cemetery and see if there’s anything good. Even if there isn’t anything good, robbing the Corrupt God Cemetery will definitely shake the entire world. I’ll become the number one figure in the archaeology world’s history,” said Mo Nian excitedly.

“I feel like your thinking is too imaginative. That place is filled with dangers. Let me put it to you this way... I could be enticed,” said Long Chen.

“Haha, I knew it. Once you have time, we can discuss the details,” said Mo Nian.

“Hey, do you two even care about your lives?” asked Beitang Rushuang.

“You... are you eavesdropping?” asked Mo Nian.

“Eavesdropping? You don’t have a sound-blocking screen up. Who can’t hear it?” said Beitang Rushuang.

Only then did Mo Nian realize that the people nearby weren’t the Dragonblood Legion but the Beitang family’s disciples.

“Don’t worry, my subordinates aren’t talkative. But I should warn you, if you do go to that place, you will definitely die,” said Beitang Rushuang.
