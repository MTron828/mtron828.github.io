Chapter 4849 Peak of Confidence

Seeing Cao Guofeng like this, the spectators jumped in fright. If Cao Guofeng really started a fight here, would they survive? They got their hands ready to press the button to transport them out.

Although their seats were precious, their lives were more important. After all, if two Heaven Saints started fighting here, they could easily get caught up in it and die.

However, Cao Guofeng didn’t attack. He simply pointed his finger at Gao Jianli and shouted, “You’re spouting nonsense! Not even ten Long Chens would be able to beat Shaoqing!”

Gao Jianli laughed. “You really are ignorant. You must have heard of the High Firmament Academy. Do you not know who Long Chen is? He is their youngest dean in history. I’m amazed by your ignorance.”

While the youngsters present didn’t react to the mention of the High Firmament Academy, the senior experts did. Now that they looked at Long Chen again, their gazes were different. The older someone was, the more they understood what this title meant.

Cao Guofeng was also shocked by this revelation, but he forced himself to remain calm. “An academy that has long since become a legend means nothing. For them to let this arrogant brat be their dean only proves that the High Firmament Academy has declined. Today, my son will kill the High Firmament Academy’s youngest dean in history. That will only make his own accomplishments shine even more.”

Finally, Mo Nian couldn’t help but interject, “You think he’ll shine? Give it up. That foolish son of yours will soon be looking for his teeth on the ground and begging for mercy. If Long Chen doesn’t have the crap beat out of him, I’ll agree that his sphincter is tight. When the time comes, don’t cry on me.”

“Who the fuck are you?! Do you think someone like you can speak here?!” raged Cao Guofeng.

Mo Nian curled his lips. “Tch, how can someone slapped in the face by a Divine Venerate act arrogant here? I’m amazed by your guts. If you’re speaking here, why can’t I?”

Picking at the scab of him being slapped, Mo Nian instantly made Cao Guofeng go crazy.

“Courting death!” roared Cao Guofeng, as he almost exploded. His one roar shook the entire martial stage, and his killing intent filled the stands.

“Gate Master Cao, if you keep shouting and disturbing us, ignoring the rules of the star cloud martial stage, I will have no choice but to send you away.” Just then, an ancient voice rang out once more.

It was the item-spirit of the star cloud martial stage, the one who had previously warned Mo Nian that it was illegal to gamble here.

Hearing this warning, Cao Guofeng quivered with rage, and his hair stood on end. He really was worried that he was going to explode.

At this moment, Mo Nian even raised a finger and put it on his lips, gesturing to be quiet. With a naughty smile, he whispered, “Hey, did you hear? Don’t keep farting so loudly, or you’ll be thrown out like trash. I advise you to hold your fart in for now.”

Mo Nian’s expression was really asking for it, causing Cao Guofeng to tremble furiously. He vowed that once this battle was over, he would torture Mo Nian to death. At this moment, his hatred toward Mo Nian surpassed even his animosity toward Long Chen.

Realizing that he couldn't match Mo Nian in verbal sparring, Cao Guofeng sat back down, suppressing his anger.

The Yellow Spring Pavilion’s master frowned when he looked at Long Chen, looking lost in thought. Meanwhile, the Heaven Heart Hall’s master didn’t seem bothered by the news of the High Firmament Academy.

After things calmed down on the spectator stands, everyone’s gaze turned back on the stage. With the barrier up, Cao Shaoqing and Long Chen were unaware of the fight that had almost erupted in the spectator stands.

The two of them continued to advance, even as the pressure grew. Their steps grew faster and faster until they were like two shooting stars crashing toward each other.

“Iron Blood Sacred Radiance, Blood Sea Wild Crocodile!” Cao Shaoqing roared, unleashing his manifestation—a giant blood sea with an enormous figure hiding within it.

In an instant, his Blood Qi ignited, sending the devil runes pressing down on him flying.

“Heavens, he directly unleashed his manifestation under this pressure!” Lu Ziqiong covered her mouth in shock. She had personally experienced how strong this pressure was and how much of an effect it had on a manifestation. In her fight against Hu Yifei, both of them had slowly resisted the devil pressure and expanded their manifestations.

However, Cao Shaoqing directly unleashed his manifestation under even greater pressure. It was an unbelievable feat.

“Die!”

Cao Shaoqing gave Long Chen no chance to breathe. After unleashing his manifestation, he sent the surging devil qi toward Long Chen, adding a fist to it.

A wave of devil qi then crashed toward Long Chen on top of Cao Shaoqing’s spiked fist. Yu Tong and Yu Fei covered their eyes, while Lu Ziqiong and Lu Ziyu clenched their hands.

“Scarlet Dragon Battle Armor!”

BOOM!

A majestic dragon cry rang throughout the stage. Clashing against the sacred dragon might, the raging devil qi was promptly blasted out of existence. All the devil pressure on the stage vanished in an instant.

Countless onlookers were left dumbfounded. Long Chen had a seven-color divine ring behind him. Within the ring, a colossal dragon was faintly visible, its immense size causing only a few of its scales to be discernible within the divine ring.

Long Chen was covered in blood-colored scales, with a billowing blood-colored cloak trailing behind him. Dragonblood power radiated out of him, giving him a noble, sacred, and icily arrogant appearance. His entire demeanor had undergone a profound transformation.

“He’s so handsome!” Seeing Long Chen in this state, numerous female disciples cried out hysterically in the spectator stands. After all, the visual impact was too much for them. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

“He’s done it again! How hateful.” Mo Nian gritted his teeth with both admiration and envy.

At this moment, a particular glint appeared in Long Chen’s eyes. He murmured, “Only when my self-confidence is at its peak is my power truly unrivaled.”

Just then, Cao Shaoqing’s spiked fist appeared in front of Long Chen.

BOOM!

Long Chen didn’t dodge. In front of countless shocked gazes, two fists collided.
