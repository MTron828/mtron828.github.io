Chapter 3449 Gain Some Profit

“Every person wants power. Every person wants to encounter some miraculous opportunity that can change their fate. Every person hopes to accomplish what takes others years to do in just a day. They want shortcuts that allow them to skip decades ahead of others. They want to soar to the top and look down on their old peers. I have a responsibility to tell you that there are no shortcuts in cultivation.

“If you want to accomplish in a day what others accomplish in decades, then you’ll need to pay the pain of the decades of work compressed into a single day. If you can endure it, you will be completely transformed. If you cannot, you will be turned to dust. No one can change this law.

“The reason I am stronger than you isn’t because my talent is higher, or because I’m smarter than you. It is because I was forced to get stronger. What I endured is not something you can imagine. This power of mine was tempered through countless brushes against death. I had no choice but to get stronger, because if I didn’t get stronger, I would die. Furthermore, my death would be very miserable. You only see my strong side, but you don’t see what lies behind it. If you can’t even endure such a weak tribulation, then don’t even think about changing your fate that the heavens decided for you. Especially the Luo family’s disciples, you keep saying that you will restore the Luo family’s glory, but is that something that can be accomplished just by talking? You're not talented enough to look down on others. You don’t have a World King or a Divine Venerate as a father or mother. What will you use to compete with others?

“Right now, the only thing you can do is compete with your life. Create a new world for yourself and create a new future for yourself. Originally, you had the choice to not try changing your fate, but that chance is gone now. You’ve already chosen to undergo tribulation with me. Either you will change, or you die.

“Trust me. I can see every single person’s talent here. This little heavenly tribulation is nothing to you. Use the threat of death to squeeze out your potential. Force yourself to erupt with greater power. Don’t let your potential lie dormant within your body. Awaken it so that you can change your fate with this heavenly tribulation. You will then be reborn, and your lives will completely change!” Long Chen’s voice rang out above the rumbling of the heavenly tribulation. It was like a celestial god’s voice ringing out above the nine heavens.

The experts feeling immense pressure were revitalized by Long Chen’s speech. Their blood heated up.

Perhaps they didn’t believe in themselves, but they did not doubt Long Chen. This was the charisma of the strong. In the cultivation world, many people simply had blind trust in the strong.

That was especially true when the words came from someone like Long Chen, who was practically a miraculous existence. Every single word he said was firmly believed by them without a doubt. If Long Chen said that they had immense potential inside them, they instantly felt like their bodies were overflowing with power, as if their potential was right in the midst of awakening.

“Kill!”

Xu Zixiong, this simple-minded fellow, immediately charged out. He was the one most affected by Long Chen’s words. Even his eyes were red, as his thirst for power was incredibly intense. After following Long Chen for a while, he could tell that he had transformed, and he wanted to get even stronger.

He charged out, taking the initiative to go against those lightning beasts. Taking out his weapon, he slaughtered them.

Qin Feng and Qi Yu shook their heads. Long Chen’s words were for others to listen. What was this fellow getting so emotional for?

However, following Xu Zixiong’s display of power, the other disciples were also affected. Rather than passively defending, they all charged out, launching a crazy counterattack against the lightning beasts. Their morale soared.

When everyone set aside their fear, their battle intent soared. It was an indescribable power. Every person’s soaring morale was affecting the other, constantly stimulating each other’s wills.

Like charcoal in the furnace, they ignited each other, growing more and more powerful. In just a few breaths’ time, the lightning beasts were no longer able to suppress them. They charged out against the lightning beasts.

A huge number of lightning beasts were devoured, and powerful lightning runes quickly filled the air, strengthening their bodies. As a result, their physical bodies and power continuously climbed.

This was a normal phenomenon, but as these disciples crazily attacked, they didn’t even realize that. They simply felt that their bodies were overflowing with power. They even thought that this was their potential being unleashed. In their delight, they went even crazier to excavate even more potential.

Seeing Long Chen ignite the disciples’ passions so intensely with just a speech, Bai Zhantang curled his lips.

“What a conman.”

Bai Xiaole’s mother covered her smile with her hand. “What? Deputy palace master, are you jealous?”

“What is there for me to be jealous of? My brothers don’t need to be conned,” snorted Bai Zhantang disdainfully.

“But these people aren’t Long Chen’s brothers. With just a few words, Long Chen was able to make them forget the pressure, allowing them to directly face the fear in their hearts and instantly unite them. It seems that our palace master doesn’t have such an ability, right?” said Bai Xiaole’s mother with a giggle.

Bai Zhantang was irritated, but he was also unable to find any words to retort. Seeing Bai Shishi’s mother also starting to covertly giggle, he said, “You’re still in the mood to laugh? Your treasured daughter is going to be conned away by this fellow due to his glib tongue.”

“A glib tongue is better than a foolish tongue. At the very least, he knows how to say things that others like, unlike some people who can’t say a single word of endearment after so many years. It seems that Shishi’s vision is far better than her mother’s. Looks, potential, talent, character, hehe, as expected of my daughter,” said Bai Shishi’s mother with praise.

“The two of you…” Bai Zhantang’s expression darkened. These two wives of his were actually standing on the side of that little fellow.

“What? You’ve accepted the betrothal gift. Don’t you think it’s rude for you to talk badly about your future son-in-law?” asked Bai Shishi’s mother, curling her lips.

“What betrothal gift?!”

Bai Zhantang was startled. He then thought of the immortal king crystals and furiously raged, “That’s not-”UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

“That’s enough. Hmph, after eating other people’s food, you can’t be rude to them. You’re going to talk badly about him behind his back? You’re quite something!” Bai Shishi’s mother glared at Bai Zhantang before turning away and focusing on the heavenly tribulation again.

In the heavenly tribulation, more and more lightning beasts appeared. They also constantly grew stronger. But the disciples’ morale was still high. They were fighting at full power. Saber-images raged and Sword Qi rumbled. The battle was exceptionally intense.

After two hours, these disciples began to have dark red mist surrounding their bodies. That was no manifestation but the result of their sweat and essence blood mixing together after being excited.

“Even the essence mist has appeared. These children really aren’t bad. They are stimulating so much of their potential.” Heaven Master Yun Yang was pleasantly surprised. As a Heaven Master, he naturally knew that this mist was the result of their potential being stimulated to a certain extent.

Their essence blood had silently ignited without them even being aware of it. They were starting to overdraft their power. In a heavenly tribulation, the more power you overdrafted and the more potential you activated, the more you would absorb from the heavenly tribulation. It was the opposite of overdrafting your power during normal times, so it was very beneficial.

However, normal people didn’t dare to go so far. If they reached their limit before the heavenly tribulation ended and didn’t have the power to endure it, they would die.

Suddenly, the void rumbled and the lightning beasts vanished. In return, a sinister aura enveloped the land.

Long Chen narrowed his eyes. As expected, they had also been infected by this karma. Not bad, Lei Linger would get to gain some profit.
