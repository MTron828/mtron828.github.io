Chapter 2938 Too Infuriated to Think

When newcomers joined the inner academy, there was normally a ceremony overseen by the inner academy’s experts on the level of Heaven Masters to welcome them. However, nobody had expected to see Chu Huairen here.

However, the current Chu Huairen was no longer wearing the robes of the Discipline Institute. He was wearing a new set of white robes instead. Long Chen smiled. Although this old ghost had come out again, he had been demoted. He was no longer one of the heads of the Discipline Institute.

Before Chu Huairen could say anything, Long Chen cupped his fists. “It seems that senior has been transferred to the inner academy. Congratulations on your promotion.”

Due to attacking a disciple during the divine competition, Chu Huairen had been severely punished.

However, because Long Chen hadn’t been killed, and Chu Huairen repeatedly claimed that he hadn’t wanted to kill Long Chen but simply suppress him, he was just stripped of his status as one of the three heads of the Discipline Institute and sent to the inner academy.

At this moment, Chu Huairen truly hated Long Chen to the bone, and it just so happened that he was overseeing the welcoming ceremonies today. Hence, he had figured out what he wanted to say to frighten Long Chen and make him uneasy in the inner academy. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

After all, he still had a high status in the inner academy. As Long Chen was essentially in his territory now, he would make sure that Long Chen wouldn’t have a good time.

However, when Long Chen directly congratulated him with the mocking of a victor, his fury got to his head. As a result, all his words were forgotten.

“Aiya, you’re shaking! You shouldn’t push yourself at your age. What if you hurt yourself? Who will take care of you?” asked Long Chen.

Just seeing Chu Huairen quivering with rage was enough to show how much he hated Long Chen now. It was precisely due to this that any one of Long Chen’s movements could infuriate him. Long Chen naturally knew what his goal was in coming here.

Whether it was to frighten him or make him too uneasy to properly cultivate, Chu Huairen simply wanted Long Chen to know that the Chu family’s roots were deep within the academy.

If Long Chen hadn’t encountered the sweeping elder before this, perhaps his mood would have instantly been soured. But now he wasn’t very angry.

Bad things now weren’t necessarily bad for the future. Opportunity lay within danger, and it just depended on how a person viewed them. Hence, he was still calm facing Chu Huairen.

“You…” Chu Huairen wanted to say something, but none of his prepared veiled threats came to mind. “Long Chen, you still aren’t aware of how close to death you are. After killing Chu Kuang, it’s not just the Chu family that won’t let you off. You’ve blasphemed Divine Venerate Brahma. After killing a Divine Venerate’s follower, you should just wait for death.”

Long Chen disdainfully said, “Give it up. If Divine Venerate Brahma really wanted to kill me, would you be so kind as to tell me so that I’m warned? You are simply trying to apply mental pressure on me. That shows that you are currently unable to do anything. The only thing you can do is use that old and ugly face of yours to disgust me. Even after all your years, you didn’t grow a brain. Did you only come here to get cursed out by me? My mood is good today, so I don’t want to. But looking at that face of yours, I feel like not cursing you would be letting down your parents. Well, let me just say that I stopped playing such childish games in my youth. If you want to play this game with me, I’ll play you to the death, so I’d advise you to hurry up and scram. Otherwise, once I catch your tail, I’ll directly alert the Discipline Institute. You should know that you’re no longer one of the three heads of the Discipline Institute. When the trial comes, the positions will be switched. I wonder if you’ll start crying at that time?”

“You…”

“What you? At your age, you should hurry up and find your grave in your family. Let me tell you, I’ve studied face-reading. If you don’t start accumulating good karma now, you will very likely die without a corpse,” advised Long Chen.

“Impudent-!”

“I, Long Chen, have been impudent for a long time. Are you only realizing it now? Make your play now. If you don’t have a play, then just die. Don’t lounge around here to just disgust others. Hey, what’s wrong with all of you? This old fellow is new and doesn’t know the rules, but what about the rest of you? Do you not know what to do?” asked Long Chen to the other experts with Chu Huairen.

These people were Elders of the inner academy, but they were lacking a general manager, someone with greater authority who was in charge of all the inner academy’s supervision and management.

This situation today didn’t actually require such a high level figure to personally oversee things, but one had come, so they could only listen to this newcomer.

However, then Long Chen had come and directly cursed their new manager, leaving them too dumbfounded to even say a word.

When Long Chen had come to check in, he had beaten hundreds of guards. This story spread his name to countless disciples in the inner academy, and they also came to learn of Long Chen’s battle with the Chu family.

Originally, they felt pity for Long Chen inside, thinking that Long Chen would be suffering under the management of their new manager who was from the Chu family.

However, their new manager was struck first by Long Chen. At this moment, Chu Huairen felt like he would explode in anger, but he was actually helpless to do anything against Long Chen.

These Elders simply looked at Chu Huairen. If Chu Huairen didn’t say anything, they didn’t dare to start the formalities yet.

“What are you all looking at me for?! I was just passing by and came to take a look! A little lower world ascender bumpkin is meaningless to me!” cursed Chu Huairen.

After cursing, he turned and left, not daring to stay here any longer. In this state, he might say the wrong thing and let Long Chen gain an advantage over him. Then he would be the unlucky one.

Chu Huairen’s plan failed miserably, so he stormed off. However, his furious appearance shocked Luo Bing, Mu Qingyun, and the others. This formerly influential existence had actually just become a general manager here.

Although such an existence sounded like it was backed with a great deal of authority, it was an empty title. In theory, he oversaw everything, but every real decision was something he could only give his opinion on. He didn’t have the authority to actually decide anything.

Chu Huairen had tried to apply some pressure on Long Chen and the others today. If it weren’t for Long Chen, he might have succeeded in making them worried.

Regretfully, Long Chen instantly saw through his thoughts, so he could only dejectedly leave.

Even the other Elders found this funny. But considering their status, they didn’t dare to laugh.

“Ignore him. That old fellow didn’t eat his medicine before coming out. Just treat him like a crazy dog. I heard that we have a complicated welcoming ceremony. How about we make it simple so we don’t waste everyone’s precious time?” proposed Long Chen.

The Elders smiled. They found his temperament to be very good. Hence, they did just as he said and tossed out some of the complicated formalities.

Long Chen and the others then received maps of the inner academy, new robes, three hundred thousand immortal crystals each, keys to their housing, the rules to the inner academy, and many other things.

“Junior brother, I look favorably upon you. Let me give you a warning. Chu Yang is already your mortal enemy, so there’s no need for me to say anything about it. There are two powers within the inner academy that you cannot offend, or you will truly be doomed,” said the Elder who was the head of this group.
