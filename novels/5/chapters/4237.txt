Chapter 4226: Zifeng’s Shocking Display

Long Chen swung the Minghong Saber repeatedly, cleaving through the terrifying dark creatures as if they were nothing more than soft tofu.

Gu Yang, Li Qi, Song Mingyuan, and Yue Zifeng also stepped forward. At this moment, Gu Yang’s spear whistled, and the power of an Eternal divine weapon shook heaven and earth. With one attack, Gu Yang drew everyone’s attention.

“This is…!”

The experts in Long Chen’s group were dumbfounded. With this attack, Gu Yang easily tore through countless dark creatures, overwhelming even Long Chen’s light.

Although this was Gu Yang’s first time fighting using this Eternal spear, it was evident that the spear and its wielder were in perfect harmony. Now, they wished to have met earlier. Filled with exhilaration, Gu Yang let out a triumphant roar and embarked on a rampage, using this method to celebrate their partnership.

In contrast to Gu Yang's flash, Li Qi and Song Mingyuan assumed a more low-key role, diligently holding the flanks. An aura of astral winds swirled around them as they brandished their rods, effortlessly shattering any dark creatures that came into their path.

Strangely, the dark creatures that were shattered didn't disintegrate into a mass of flesh and blood. Instead, they transformed into dust that collected beneath their feet, creating a rather bizarre sight.

“Heavy earth power, spirit of the earth!”

Suddenly, Li Qi let out a cry, causing the pile of earth beneath his feet to condense and twist into an earth giant.

It was dozens of miles tall and covered in runes. When it opened its eyes, an eerie blood-red light radiated from them, granting it an uncanny semblance of life.

The earth giant then let out a roar. With a single punch, countless dark creatures were sent flying, with quite a few blasted apart.

As the dark creatures were blown apart, they once more turned to dust and fell to the earth. The earth giant’s power was simply limitless, even possessing powerful Blood Qi fluctuations. The moment it joined the battle, it slew countless dark creatures.

“Heavy earth power, spirit of the earth!”

Song Mingyuan also followed up with a shout, summoning another earth giant into existence. As the two earth giants killed more and more dark creatures, the dust beneath them accumulated, giving rise to even more earth giants.

In the blink of an eye, over ten earth giants materialized on the battlefield. With each new arrival, their slaughter intensified, and their numbers grew at an accelerating pace.

This scene dumbfounded people. Just what kind of divine ability was this? How had they never heard of it?

Their ability could turn the flesh and blood of their enemies into dust and then mold that dust into battle puppets. Furthermore, other than mighty earth energy, this puppet also possessed powerful Blood Qi. Even a Supreme heavenly genius might not be a match for them.

Within the sea of endless dark creatures, two graceful figures flitted to and fro. They were none other than Yue Zifeng and Mu Qingyun. With a simple wave of his hand, Yue Zifeng created an enormous crack in the void, and every dark creature caught in that crack was cut apart, as if an invisible blade had slashed them. Their corpses then descended like rainfall.

Every time Yue Zifeng attacked, Mu Qingyun would attack as well, and her Sword Qi slaughtered quite a few dark creatures.

Mu Qingyun’s attacks were also extremely sharp. If she were alone, she would definitely be considered a shocking genius. However, given the power of Yue Zifeng’s blow, she paled in comparison.

“Again,” ordered Yue Zifeng coldly. He waved his hand again, causing the void to split open anew. And just like before, countless dark creatures were slain.

“He… he is drawing his sword!” Suddenly, a cry of disbelief came from outside the martial stage, perplexing countless others.

It was on the third time of Yue Zifeng’s attack that some of them finally spotted the slightest trace of him drawing his sword. At that moment, they were dumbfounded.

Amongst these experts were quite a few innate Heaven Venerates with extensive battle experience. But despite their formidable cultivation bases, it took them three attempts just to catch a glimpse of Yue Zifeng's movements.

If he were their enemy, they wouldn't have a chance to react before Yue Zifeng severed their heads. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

Everyone would say that sword cultivators possessed the most terrifying killing power among all cultivators. However, no one had expected them to be this terrifying.

While many had witnessed the might of sword cultivators before and acknowledged their power, Yue Zifeng's lightning-fast attacks redefined the concept of power. He could no longer be merely labeled as powerful; he had transcended into the realm of a true monster.

However, despite what the senior experts said, many experts here remained skeptical. They couldn’t believe it because they couldn’t see Yue Zifeng draw his sword or sheathe it.

If Yue Zifeng were using his fingers as a sword to attack, that would still be understandable. After all, even though they had not seen an expert doing that, they had heard of them.

However, they were not blind. If they couldn’t even see someone draw their sword, they would be no different than fools after all.

For ninety-nine percent of the experts watching, they could only see Yue Zifeng wave his hand, and then a crack appeared in the void and slew countless dark creatures.

Every time Yue Zifeng attacked, Mu Qingyun would also attack. Yue Zifeng was clearly teaching her the essence of the Sword Dao.

However, Yue Zifeng was not a man of many words, and he used even fewer words when teaching Mu Qingyun. Most of the time, he only gave her a demonstration. As for whether or not she could gain anything from it, it was all up to her comprehension ability.

Mu Qingyun was focused, her expression serious. In every single attack, she used her entire mind and spirit to comprehend the Dao. Unlike everyone else, what she was looking at was not Yue Zifeng drawing or sheathing his sword; instead, her focus was on the millions of variations that appeared the moment he slashed his sword.

Yue Zifeng was using this place as a training ground to teach Mu Qingyun, but his display astonished countless experts inside and outside of the martial stage.

For them to be standing right behind Long Chen, many people had assumed that they must be powerful existences. But they had not expected Long Chen’s followers to be this powerful.

Gu Yang’s heaven-shaking spear left countless innate Heaven Venerates in awe, while Li Qi and Song Mingyuan’s earth spirit art astonished the onlookers. Everyone felt them to be terrifying monsters.

When it came to Yue Zifeng and Mu Qingyun's Sword Dao, it struck terror into the hearts of all who witnessed it, regardless of their faction or race—even the innate Heaven Venerates were not exempt from this overwhelming fear.

They had never encountered a sword cultivator with such terrifying speed and sharpness. There was no time to dodge their attacks at all. Even innate Heaven Venerates would meet their demise if Yue Zifeng managed to get close to them.

“This little fellow really is powerful! I actually misjudged him.”

Even the Battle God Palace’s palace master couldn’t help but say a few rare words of praise.

Bai Zhantang and the others were stunned as well, having never imagined that every single one of Long Chen’s followers was so terrifying.

“The Dragonblood Legion. Not bad!” murmured the palace master to himself.

“Not good!”

Suddenly, the expression of Bai Xiaole’s mother changed, and within her eyes, three flowers swirled in a mysterious pattern. Dozens of figures materialized as reflections within her pupils.

“Shadow Assassins!”

She recognized the origin of these lifeforms. Unbeknownst to Long Chen, they were currently sneaking up on him.
