Chapter 2891 Paving a Path

The spirit awakening, the first step in activating their bloodline, normally required several days. But now, it was completed in just a short hour.

Luo Ning had succeeded in the spirit awakening of her bloodline, so her entire aura had changed. Light glinted from within her eyes with a deep power.

“Big sister!” Luo Ning cried out emotionally. However, Luo Bing indicated for her to be quiet while pointing outside. She meant that Long Chen was still outside. Hence, Luo Ning hastily put on her clothes, as her old clothes had been blasted apart by the eruption of her Blood Qi.

After putting on new clothes, she was still excited. “Big sister, I feel completely reborn! You have to try it too! That fellow Long Chen really is amazing!”

Luo Bing nodded and consumed the remaining pill. But with Luo Ning showing the way, she first took off her clothes before starting the spirit awakening.

As a result, she took a full two hours to complete the spirit awakening. When she finally opened her eyes, Luo Ning cried out excitedly, “Big sister, a violet dragon mark appeared in your eyes! It’s the sign of the ancestral bloodline awakening!”

“Really?”

Luo Bing herself was shocked and hastily took out a mirror. Deep in her eyes, there was a violet mark. It was faint, but it was definitely there.

“This is amazing! Big sister, you can now be classified as a peak genius of the family! You can enjoy the special treatment of a peak genius!” exclaimed Luo Ning, practically dancing.

“I have to call Long Chen in and thank him properly.” Luo Ning turned around, causing Luo Bing to jump and drag her back.

“You foolish girl, I’m still not wearing anything!” Luo Bing was speechless. This little sister of hers was always so impatient and didn’t think things through.

Once she put on her clothes, she said, “We owe Long Chen a huge debt this time. I don’t even know how we’re supposed to repay him. Make sure to be more polite to him. It’s rude to quarrel with someone who has given you such a favor.”

These two medicinal pills were absolute supreme treasures. Even Luo Bing had never seen or heard of such a thing. What kind of medicinal pill could have such an effect?

Long Chen said that he had refined the pills, but Luo Bing didn’t believe it. Although she didn’t know where he had gotten them, she was filled with gratitude. But at the same time, she felt the pressure.

“What else? Doesn’t he have intentions toward us? We can just marry him together,” said Luo Ning casually.

“You foolish girl, you can’t even tell when he’s joking? He only looks at you like a child. It’s the same for me and Mu Qingyun. He doesn’t have those feelings,” said Luo Bing.

“I don’t believe it. He might not like me, but it’s impossible for him to not like you. Unless he isn’t a man,” said Luo Ning decisively. In her eyes, her big sister was the most beautiful existence, someone that no man could resist.

Let alone within the academy, even within their family, she was a famous beauty ever since she was a child. It was unknown how many people had pursued her. As Luo Ning had always remained by her big sister’s side as a bodyguard, she no longer found such a thing odd. In all these years, she hadn’t seen a single man not attracted to Luo Bing, so she was even more confident in her sister’s beauty than her own.

“You really are hopeless. Although Long Chen is from the lower world, he has seen more things than we have. That’s what tempered his character. Furthermore, when it comes to beauty, who can compare to the academy’s number one beauty?” sighed Luo Bing.

“You’re talking about the dean’s granddaughter, Bai Shishi, who is first on the heaven tier immortal rankings?” asked Luo Ning.

“Other than her, who else?”

“Is she really so beautiful?”

“Yes, to a kind of pinnacle that makes others forget to breathe. She is the true beauty. The moon hides itself before her, and flowers are ashamed to be in her presence. Even birds and beasts are envious of her beauty. Furthermore, there is a kind of noble temperament around her, making it feel like just looking at her is blasphemous. I once saw her. Although it was just a moment, it was unforgettable… Ah, that’s not really the topic to discuss. Call in Long Chen. We have to thank him,” said Luo Bing.

The two of them opened the door just in time to see Long Chen toss a mouthful of pills into his mouth. Although they didn’t see it clearly, they all had a layer of light around them. It seemed… that they were all top grade.

He ate top grade pills like snacks? The two sisters turned to stone. This was too crazy, wasn’t it?

Once they were back inside the room. Long Chen once more felt their bloodline fluctuations. “My medicinal pills are a bit too violent for your bodies. Your meridians have been injured by the fierceness. However, this damage isn’t a bad thing either. As your Spirit Blood heals itself, it will widen your meridians. I should warn you not to indiscriminately eat medicinal pills if you sense this later. Don’t cultivate or fight within the next three days. Just let your body recover naturally.”

After saying that, his expression grew solemn. “I hope that you can keep the matter of me refining pills secret. In the academy, other than you two, no one else knows I can refine pills like this. Although I’m not afraid of trouble, I would prefer it if I can be more low-key while I have yet to stabilize here.”

Luo Ning and Luo Bing’s hearts quivered. He was truly saying that he had refined his own pills. If that was true, then…

Luo Bing struggled with herself for a moment, but she couldn’t help saying, “Long Chen, I know that a person should know not to push too far. But as a disciple of the Luo family, I must shamelessly say this. If you can refine these pills, then if you are willing, you can form a collaboration with the Luo family. You can set any price for these pills. Of course, if you are unwilling, we two sisters will swear on the heavens that a third person will not know this secret.”

Luo Bing’s face felt burning hot when she asked this. These two pills that Long Chen had given them were already a tremendous kindness. For her to ask for more, was that not going too far?

However, the effect of this pill was just too miraculous. If the Luo family could obtain a steady supply of these pills, their current emergency would be resolved. It was too important for her not to ask.

Luo Bing and Luo Ning almost couldn’t look at Long Chen after making such a request, but Long Chen laughed. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

“With our relationship, that’s just a minor matter. Once I’ve stabilized myself in the academy, I hope to go take a trip to your Luo family and discuss this collaboration.”

This response made Luo Bing and Luo Ning ecstatic. They wished they could hug and kill for this. It was the best news they could obtain.

However, Long Chen was even happier than them inside. Now he had paved a path to the Luo family. Later on, he could go search for information about his mother.
