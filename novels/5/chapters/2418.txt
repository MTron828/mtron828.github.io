Chapter 2408 Unexpected Failure

Translator: BornToBe

That star seemed to ignite all the energy within the masked elder. Boundless Samsara energy whirled within it, causing Long Chen’s heart to shake.

The masked elder slashed through the ice. His ice energy froze space and time. This was the power of a Dao.

Long Chen was locked down by this sword. With a deep breath, he poured his power into Evilmoon. As a result, a dragon roar resounded throughout heaven and earth, and an evil air exploded out of Evilmoon. It was like a fiend had broken through the gates of hell to devour the mortal world.

BOOM!

As if coming alive, Evilmoon roared as it slashed into the sword. A huge explosion sent Long Chen and the masked elder flying. Long Chen felt like his bones were about to crumble, and he couldn’t help being shocked. What was that star for it to be so powerful?

In that situation, he had been forced to use Evilmoon’s power, and Evilmoon hadn’t disappointed him. It had managed to block that terrifying attack. However, his own physical body was unable to endure it.

While Long Chen was shocked, the masked elder was even more shocked. That star behind him was a manifestation of his astral space. His life and death energy had gathered into his astral space at the core. That gave him greater control over his life and death energy, and it would prevent Long Chen from using his life energy to break the masked elder’s abilities.

If it was an expert on Elder Long’s level, then there would be no need to summon this star outside their body. Someone on that level would be able to balance out their life energy before their technique collapsed. However, this masked elder had yet to reach that level. He had clearly just reached the fourth step.

With his astral space manifestation, the masked elder was no longer afraid of Long Chen disturbing his techniques with life energy. However, he definitely hadn’t thought that Long Chen would be able to face his attack with pure power.

“It seems that this blade of yours is a treasure. A child isn’t suited for such a thing. I’ll be taking it.” The masked elder grew greedy upon realizing that the source of Long Chen’s power was Evilmoon.

“Fuck, does he dare to touch me? Long Chen, kill him!” raged Evilmoon.

“Let’s test his power first,” said Long Chen.

“Test what? This kind of novice is worth testing? In my peak, I could crush a mass of these fellows with a fart. Just kill him!” Evilmoon continued to rage. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Not waiting for Long Chen’s response, dark energy swirled out of Evilmoon and entered Long Chen’s body. His white scales became half black.

Following that, seventy-two of Long Chen’s acupuncture points began to quiver. A giant saber-image tore into the sky, sucking away the energy of heaven and earth.

“Split the Heavens 8!”

Long Chen let out a cry. Although this was also the eighth form of Split the Heavens, when using Evilmoon’s full power to unleash it, this blow cut through the restrictions of space and time. It was like a god’s blade slashing down upon the masked elder.

The masked elder was horrified. In just an instant, Long Chen had transformed into another person. Even his aura had changed, becoming dark and sinister like a devil king.

The masked elder hastily formed hand seals, causing the star behind him to quiver. Life and death energy burst forth like a volcano, merging into his sword. After that, a streak of light erupted out of it.

BOOM!

The sword and saber clashed. Long Chen was unable to keep a grip on Evilmoon, and it went flying out of his hands. Moreover, both his hands were badly mangled.

As for the masked elder, he shot back like a shooting star, blasting through three big mountains before coming to a stop. He coughed up blood, which came out of the sides of his mask.

His ice sword was destroyed, leaving behind only a hilt. Not only that, but the destructive power within Long Chen’s sword was wrecking his body. He was shocked to find that even his life energy was unable to heal his injuries. His Heavenly Dao energy was isolated from him.

Just at that moment, a burst of blinding light appeared. A lightning spear pierced toward his head.

The masked elder was appalled and suddenly took out a jade tablet. That piece of jade was almost the exact same shape as the one that Long Chen had, but it was a different color, blue.

He crushed the jade, and a curtain of light appeared in front of him. Furthermore, a withered hand came reaching out of the light to strike Long Chen’s lightning spear.

The lightning spear instantly crumbled. Long Chen was shocked, and when he retreated, he found that everything around the light barrier was affected by a strange law. His movements were slowed down.

The hand reached toward Long Chen’s throat. Life and death energy surged within the hand, energy that was far stronger than the masked elder’s.

“This is someone on the level of a Heaven Elder.” Long Chen’s heart pounded. The Ye family had even sent such a backup just to kill him.

Just at that moment, Evilmoon came flying back of its own accord, striking the hand.

The hand went from a claw to a fist and instantly became pitch black. It blocked Evilmoon just like that, and a metallic ringing filled the air.

“Gloves!” Long Chen instantly realized that this was a set of divine items. Borrowing Evilmoon’s power, he retreated from the light. Within this light, he was unable to use his full power.

The owner of the hand came out. He wore black robes and also had a silver mask. His hair was black, and although it was not possible to see his face, based on the fluctuations of his Blood Qi, there was no sign of old age.

His hands pulled on the void, and space twisted. He suddenly appeared right in front of Long Chen, a claw reaching for his throat.

“This fellow’s much stronger. This domain only allows life and death energy to be used. We’re at too much of a disadvantage,” said Evilmoon.

Long Chen and Evilmoon felt like they were moving in water. The more power they tried to use, the more that they were impacted. After seven moves, that fellow’s claw reached Long Chen’s shoulder.

Five bloody holes appeared in Long Chen’s shoulder. That person pulled, and Long Chen let out a pained grunt as a piece of his flesh was ripped off.

Those gloves of his were so sharp that even the Azure Dragon Battle Armor was unable to block them.

“What an unexpected failure.”

Long Chen shook his head. He had fallen for a trap. If he hadn’t been in a rush to kill the elder, he wouldn’t have ended up in this trap.

This was clearly a supreme expert on par with a Heaven Elder, and yet he didn’t care about his face and actually came to target Long Chen, a rookie who had just entered the Netherpassage realm. That meant that they viewed killing him as a must.

The masked man tossed away the flesh he had ripped off of Long Chen. Without a word, he continued attacking, not giving Long Chen any breathing room.

BANG!

A cyan brick appeared in front of Long Chen, blocking his claw. Long Chen had taken out the Heaven Flipping Seal at this critical moment.

Having been accumulating power for so much time, it suddenly unleashed a wave of power, blocking the attack without any struggle.

“Good job!” exclaimed Long Chen. After being nourished for so long, the Heaven Flipping Seal was now on the same level as Evilmoon.

This brick he had found within the mysterious coffin in Devil Spirit Mountain had mysterious origins. Even Evilmoon had a high opinion of it and was constantly trying to teach it how to use its power. Now, those lessons were paying off.

Even the masked man was startled. The Heaven Flipping Seal was so hard that even in his gloves, his hand hurt. It felt like it might break.

The Heaven Flipping Seal expanded, separating Long Chen from the masked man.

Long Chen suddenly felt his body lighten as he escaped the masked man’s domain. His gaze instantly turned icy.

“Split the Heavens 8!”

Evilmoon once more unleashed its power. Long Chen was furious. That domain had been far too stifling, and it had almost killed him.

Evilmoon was just as angry as he was. The feeling of having power but not being able to release it was infuriating. A scale-like pattern appeared on its blade. As a result, Long Chen felt his spiritual yuan and the power of his astral spaces pour into Evilmoon.

A giant saber-image appeared in the sky, filled with killing intent. When it slashed into the light domain, the entire light domain exploded.

The masked man blocked with both hands, and a giant star appeared behind him as he used the same technique as the elder.

A muffled bang rang out. The masked man’s star blazed with light, seeming to suck away all the power of Long Chen’s attack.

Suddenly, the masked man coughed up a mouthful of blood. The impact of the attack caused his mask to fly off, revealing his face. Even Long Chen jumped in shock.
