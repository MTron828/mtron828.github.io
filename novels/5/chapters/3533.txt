Chapter 3522

Seeing that Long Chen was surprised, Yu Qingxuan curiously asked, “You didn’t come here for the Heavenly Flame Spirits?”

“I came here for you.”

“Nonsense.” Yu Qingxuan’s face reddened slightly.

“Hehe, that was a joke. I saw many people coming in this direction, so I felt like something major might be happening. I just came to take a look and didn’t expect to see you. After encountering you, I’ve run into one stroke of good luck after another! Oh, that’s right, I already said that we have to split our spoils fifty-fifty. Let’s divvy up the loot!” Long Chen took out the wines.

“No, no! The Wine God Palace’s seniors gave the wines to you. Furthermore, that Spirit race senior already gave me some wine. I’m already very satisfied.” Yu Qingxuan hastily refused.

Long Chen had fought with his wits against the masters of the Wine God Palace, and adding on his shameless face, he managed to con out these wines. She couldn’t possibly take advantage of him.

Long Chen persevered, trying to split the wines with her, but she shook her head the entire time. Long Chen didn’t force her. He just picked out a few dozen of the fine wines that suited her the most. There were a total of a hundred jugs.

Yu Qingxuan still tried to refuse, but Long Chen hardened his face. “If you don’t take it, that’s looking down on me.”

Only once she took it did Long Chen smile. He seemed just like a happy young man with any scheming ability. Infected by him, Yu Qingxuan also felt very happy.

“You mentioned Heavenly Flame Spirits. What are those? Why have they drawn so many flame element experts?” asked Long Chen after splitting the loot.

“The Heavenly Flame Spirits will periodically appear in the Heavenly Flame World inside of the Dragon Blaze Prefecture. Furthermore, this time it is special. The Heavenly Flame World descends upon the Dragon Blaze Prefecture once every thirty-six thousand years, and the Heavenly Flame World contains Heavenly Flame Spirits. They are terrible spirits of heaven and earth that desire to destroy the world. Every time the Heavenly Flame World descends, it is a tribulation. However, later on, people found that those wicked Heavenly Flame Spirits were actually a great opportunity to flame cultivators. If they are subdued, they can purify your flame energy. Last time, you gave me the Heavenly Rainbow Flame, but although it is my life’s flame, it requires a great deal of energy for me to merge with it. Just relying on myself, it would be impossible to accomplish it without a hundred years of cultivation. But if I can subdue enough Heavenly Flame Spirits, it will be possible to resolve that. What is your core flame?” asked Yu Qingxuan.

“Me? I still don’t have a core flame,” said Long Chen after a moment of stunned silence. He truly didn’t have a core flame, nor did he need one. He had Huo Linger.

“Long Chen, you don’t even have a core flame, but…” Yu Qingxuan didn’t know what to say.

“I don’t have a core flame, but that doesn’t mean that I don’t have a powerful flame. It’s just that my cultivation style is different from yours. Let me tell you a secret. I have a flame that is even more powerful than the Heavenly Rainbow Flame,” whispered Long Chen, looking around to make sure that no one else was around to hear it.

Yu Qingxuan laughed. “You’re lying!”

She thought that Long Chen was afraid that she would have a guilty conscience, which caused him to lie. She didn’t realize that he was telling the truth. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

Seeing the emotion deep in Yu Qingxuan’s eyes, Long Chen wasn’t in a rush to prove himself. He had to leave a deep enough impression in Yu Qingxuan’s heart first so that she wasn’t swindled away by others.

In order to make Yu Qingxuan happy, he constantly cajoled her, telling her jokes that made her laugh. Her mood soon improved.

Seeing her smiling like a blooming flower, Long Chen swore to himself that he would protect her forever. He would make sure that this smile remained on her face eternally. He wouldn’t let her suffer the slightest grievance again.

“Let’s go back to the Dragon Blaze Prefecture. Otherwise, those two Elders will get worried,” said Yu Qingxuan. After forming hand seals, a war chariot decked in dazzling gold and jade appeared.

“Oh wow, so this war chariot was yours?” Long Chen’s jaw dropped. This was the war chariot that had drawn his attention back then, the World Domain war chariot.

“You recognize this war chariot?” asked Yu Qingxuan.

“No, I don’t recognize this war chariot. But I recognize its master,” laughed Long Chen.

Yu Qingxuan laughed. “This war chariot was something that my master used in his youth. After I obtained the Heavenly Rainbow Flame, he gifted it to me as a reward. Let’s get on!”

“Hehe, then I’ll definitely have to enjoy this ride. After all, a portion of this reward should be thanks to me!” Long Chen laughed and stepped into the war chariot.

Yu Qingxuan knew that Long Chen was saying that on purpose. She was getting used to Long Chen’s humorous way of talking.

“Damn, this really is luxurious!” Long Chen was stunned. This war chariot had several parts, all made out of materials for World Domain divine items.

Even the seats, tea table, carpets, and the rest were covered in runes. This war chariot was essentially a mobile fortress.

Although Long Chen had strengthened the seventh branch academy to the greatest level, looking at this war chariot, he found that only the owner of this chariot had the right to brag.

Every part of the war chariot had runes carved into it. Once those runes were all activated, it would be a supremely terrifying killing item.

Seeing Long Chen’s shock, even Yu Qingxuan, who was normally indifferent to such a thing, felt a trace of pride.

As the war chariot shot through the air, there wasn’t the slightest sound of it piercing through space, nor were there the slightest shaking or jolts. Seeing the scenery rapidly falling into the rear, Long Chen was amazed.

“Long Chen, this time, let’s go together into the Heavenly Flame World!” said Yu Qingxuan.

Seeing Long Chen stare at her blankly, Yu Qingxuan blushed and said, “I just meant that we can gather the Heavenly Flame Spirits together, looking after each other.”

“Either way is fine,” said Long Chen with a smile. The double meaning of his words made her blush even harder.

Long Chen looked at Yu Qingxuan and said, “If you’re with me, I hope that you can relax slightly. I have no crazy demands for you. I just hope that you can be happy. I don’t want you to feel any pressure because I will never ask you to repay anything.”

“Why… Why do you treat me so well?” Yu Qingxuan saw Long Chen’s sincerity. She then thought of how Long Chen had appeared to protect her in front of the winged devil race expert. As a result, her heart warmed.

“Because I owe you… I owe you far too much. I can spend several lifetimes trying, but I’ll never be able to fully repay you,” said Long Chen.

“Why do you say such a thing?” asked Yu Qingxuan. She clearly didn’t have memories of her former life.

“Whatever I say, it won’t matter. Just tell me, do you trust me?” asked Long Chen.

Yu Qingxuan nodded. “Although I still don’t understand you, I know that you won’t harm me.”

Long Chen smiled. “Then that’s enough.”

Yu Qingxuan’s answer was the greatest acknowledgment he could obtain. Hence, Long Chen felt energy filling him.

When Yu Qingxuan’s war chariot descended upon the Dragon Blaze Prefecture and the two of them came out, Long Chen instantly sensed countless pairs of eyes filled with killing intent staring at him.

Looking at those gazes, Long Chen smiled.
