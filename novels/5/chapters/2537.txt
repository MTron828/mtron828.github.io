Chapter 2526 Final Trump Card

A divine spear exploded right inside of Long Chen’s body, leaving behind a bloody hole in his chest.

Meanwhile, Dongfang Yuyang was blown back by the impact, barely stabilizing himself far in the distance. He then stared at Long Chen in shock.

He didn’t want to kill Long Chen instantly because he wished to savor Long Chen’s expression of despair before death, the crazed gazes of the Dragonblood Legion, as well as the sight of Meng Qi and the others’ hearts breaking.

He hated Long Chen as well as envied him. After all his effort, he had finally had Long Chen’s life in his hands. With just a thought, he could have blasted Long Chen apart with his spear.

However, it didn’t work. The instant Long Chen grabbed his spear, Dongfang Yuyang unleashed the explosive power contained within it. That should have blown Long Chen up without a trace. It contained not just his power but also Long Chen’s. Yet, the power of the spear was suppressed by some domineering energy, which then contained the explosion within a limited area.

The hand that had grabbed the spear was now a mass of flesh and blood. Long Chen still held the tip of the spear with it.

Long Chen then clenched his gory hand, and the strongest, toughest part of the spear slowly transformed into golden powder that blew away with the wind. Long Chen’s aura grew icier and icier. That was a terrifying iciness that enveloped everyone’s hearts, including those allied with him.

“What happened to him?” Tang Wan-er stared in shock. Long Chen’s aura was completely foreign. It was filled with darkness and killing intent as if he was another person.

Meng Qi and the others were all stunned. They had never seen Long Chen like this, and it gave them chills.

Suddenly, a powerful roar shook everyone’s ears. It was like thunder exploding in their ear canals. All other sounds were drowned out by it.

All of a sudden, a black dragon appeared behind Long Chen, and a terrifying aura soared out of it.

Most shocking of all, this giant dragon actually had two heads, and both had roared at the same time. In that instant, the stars were shaken and the nine heavens quaked. A sinister aura suppressed everything else.

People stared in shock at that black two-headed dragon, unaware that this giant dragon was a manifestation of Evilmoon’s soul.

“Long Chen, wake up!” The black dragon roared with both its heads once more.

Following Evilmoon’s roar, a glimmer of light appeared within Long Chen’s black eyes. That light gradually grew until Long Chen’s icy aura vanished and he returned to his normal appearance.

The black dragon also vanished as if nothing had happened. Long Chen stared blankly at the hole in his chest.

“Long Chen, hurry up and heal your injuries. I’ll use my life essence to help you destroy that altar,” transmitted Evilmoon. Long Chen had reached his limit, so Evilmoon couldn’t hold back any longer.

“If you use your life energy, you’ll never be able to recreate your physical body and reach your old peak. Thank you, but I still have my own trump card left. I won’t let you make such a sacrifice.” Long Chen shook his head. He then began to stuff his mouth with giant pills, causing the sixth star within his divine ring to slowly light up.

“Hahaha, the mighty Long Chen has actually reached the point of needing to drug himself up? Long Chen, you’ve really fallen.” Zhao Ritian laughed disdainfully.

This kind of move was nothing more than a display of powerlessness, as it meant that all trump cards had been exposed. It was a self-destructive method of relying on medicinal power to ignite your potential.

The sixth star in Long Chen’s divine ring flickered, growing brighter and brighter. Long Chen’s own aura also grew, as if some terrifying monster was on the verge of awakening.

“Long Chen, stop! You don’t have anyone to guide you in the Nine Star Hegemon Body Art. Your cultivation path has very likely deviated from the correct path. That nine star heir from the Heaven Shrouding Mirror had only reached the Five Star Battle Armor, but he was many times stronger than you. With your current physical body, even if you’ve received the nourishment of the dragon blood, you definitely cannot summon the Six Star Battle Armor. You have to reach the realm above Netherpassage first before trying, or your body won’t be able to endure it!” roared Evilmoon

Long Chen didn’t listen and continued stuffing giant pills into his mouth. These were the gains made by the Moon and Star Refining Furnace all this time.

In order to allow itself to recover quickly, it was constantly refining pills. Hence, the Nethergate Pills had piled into mountains, and Long Chen had already reached his limit of consuming them.

Long Chen had also noticed that his cultivation path might have deviated from the correct Nine Star Hegemon Body Art. It was because that nine star heir he had encountered was many times stronger than him. His domineering aura was something his current physical body wasn’t necessarily able to endure.

Long Chen had been planning on only attempting to reach the level of the Six Star Battle Armor after advancing beyond Netherpassage. But now he had no other choice.

Either he sacrificed Evilmoon’s future, or he risked everything on a gamble to see if he could endure the impact of the Six Star Battle Armor.

Since his path had deviated, then the Six Star Battle Armor shouldn’t be as powerful as it would be if cultivated correctly, so the strain from using it shouldn’t be as great. He felt like he did have a chance.

As the medicinal pills entered his mouth, he activated the Swallow the Heavens, Devour the Earth divine ability. Because of this, endless energy raged throughout Long Chen’s body, pouring toward the Nethergate Star. With every flicker of the sixth star in his divine ring, Long Chen’s aura fiercely climbed.

The Nethergate Star above his Dantian was slowly growing. It emitted energy that was echoed by the FengFu, Alioth, Life Star, Enlightenment Palace, and Divine Gate Stars. His 108,000 astral spaces also shivered, as all the energy was creating a shocking current throughout his body. The sound of the tide caused heaven and earth to rumble.

“Quick, kill Long Chen!” Ye Ming’s expression changed as he suddenly sensed a strong feeling of unease. It might even be fear.

“Protect the boss!” Guo Ran immediately shouted. The Dragonblood Legion quickly formed up around Long Chen, with Meng Qi, Chu Yao, Tang Wan-er, Yue Zifeng, Gu Yang, and the others standing guard on the outside.

The Martial Heaven Alliance and the Xuan Beasts’ experts also stood around Long Chen, ready to attack or defend.

“Haha, now it’s our turn to be the main force. You can all die, you ants!” Zhao Ritian laughed and swung the Heaven Suppressing Dragon Coiling Staff at them.

In one blow, hundreds of the Righteous path’s disciples were killed.

“Zhao Ritian, you little fucker, if you have the guts, come at me!” raged Guo Ran. Zhao Ritian was incredibly sinister, ignoring the Dragonblood Legion’s formation and attacking the weaker disciples.

He was a Sovereign sprout, so those ordinary disciples of the Martial Heaven Alliance could not possibly match him. With every blow, he slaughtered a mass of them. Because of him, a rain of blood fell. The Dragonblood warriors’ eyes reddened.

Those fallen disciples had fought alongside the Dragonblood Legion. They were their comrades-in-arms. Seeing them killed, the Dragonblood warriors were enraged, but they couldn’t leave their formation.

Zhao Ritian seemed to be doing it on purpose, lingering over the outer edge and slaughtering the weaker disciples. There wasn’t a single person capable of matching him there.

Hu Feng was also infuriated. The Heavenly Fate Die behind him spun, and with the Heavenly Nine Tiles in hand, he shot after Zhao Ritian.

“Hahaha, you think you can catch me? Keep dreaming!” Zhao Ritian sneered and avoided Hu Feng, not even letting him get close. Zhao Ritian didn’t want to get trapped in the die, so he flew around the outer edge, occasionally striking with the Heaven Suppressing Dragon Coiling Rod.

“Zhao Ritian, are you even fucking human? Since ancient times, battles have always been fought with dignity, soldiers against soldiers, generals against generals. What kind of bastard are you to kill the weak?” Hu Feng roared furiously. He had always been a refined man, but now he broke into curses. Zhao Ritian was absolutely despicable. As a Sovereign sprout of the divine families, he was actually attacking ordinary disciples.

“They’re doing it on purpose. They want us to break our formation and leave our boss defenseless.” Gu Yang furiously clenched his teeth

At this moment, the Corrupt path’s disciples and the Heaven Devouring Black Armor Corps also attacked.

“Disciples of the divine families, hear my orders. Kill Long Chen!” shouted Zhao Ritian.

The divine families’ disciples immediately charged out, fighting alongside the Corrupt disciples against the Martial Heaven Alliance. However, there was one conspicuous group amongst the divine families that didn’t move.

“You dare to disobey orders?!” Zhao Ritian glared at them. This group was the eighth Heavenly Dragon Legion.

From the beginning, they had only stood there, not making any move. Before this, they were mixed into the crowd and hadn’t been conspicuous, but now that everyone else shot off, their silence was apparent.

Shen Chengfeng shook his head. “Long Chen is our brother who fought alongside us before. To betray the divine families is disloyal, and to betray a brother is injustice. Since we cannot accommodate both, we will not help either side. Once we return to the divine families, we will accept any punishment, even if it means being expelled from the divine families.”

Shen Chengfeng looked at Long Chen with a complicated expression. After considering everything, he had chosen to take this path.

“Bastard, you dare to disobey orders? When we get back, I’ll make sure you’re all executed!” roared Zhao Ritian.

“Whatever punishment we receive, we’ll listen. Even if it’s execution,” said Shen Chengfeng indifferently.

“Even if it’s execution.”

The eighth legion’s warriors echoed his words, their voices firm. Their determination was unshakeable.

“Bastards, just wait!” Zhao Ritian raged, but now wasn’t the time to deal with Shen Chengfeng. Zhao Ritian then cast his rage on the Martial Heaven Alliance’s disciples.

“The four divine generals are coming! Stop them!” shouted someone from the Martial Heaven Alliance. The four divine generals were breaking away from their blockade.
