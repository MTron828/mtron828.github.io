Chapter 3529

The two snakes appeared out of nowhere. Furthermore, it was just as Long Chen’s hand was about to grab his neck. This sudden sneak attack couldn’t be defended against.

The two snakes bit their fangs deeply into Long Chen’s arm. However, Long Chen’s hand was still tightly clenched around that person’s neck.

“The Amethyst Firmament Gate’s spirit flame divine beast, the Flame Spirit Python!” Startled cries rang out.

“Long Chen’s doomed. The Flame Spirit Python’s venom is incomparable. Anyone bitten by it will have fire poison invade their hearts. There’s no cure,” added another person who knew the Flame Spirit Python’s terror.

As soon as someone was bitten by a Flame Spirit Python, its fire poison would instantly spread throughout their entire body. Even the soul would be ignited. All those struck by it would definitely die.

People felt pity for Long Chen as this was truly a sinister play. That person had intentionally baited Long Chen into attacking him. It was a trap.

However, people quickly realized something was off. No matter how those two pythons bit his arm, Long Chen’s hand was still tightly holding that person’s throat. Moreover, the latter’s sinister smile gradually became one of confusion and fear.

Suddenly, the two pythons on Long Chen’s arm exploded, shattering like ice statues. They then fell to the ground in bits of ice, but the ice didn’t melt when it landed on the ground. Instead, it pierced through the ground, leaving tiny holes. It was as if that ice contained a terrifying heat that directly melted the rock.

“Why not just live properly? Why do you just have to get yourself killed? For fame? For profit? I have no enmity with you, so why did you want to kill me?” Long Chen looked at that shocked expert apathetically.

Huo Linger had completely refined the Ice Soul. Although it couldn’t be said that she was the Ice Soul, she was already able to control a trace of the Ice Soul’s power.

Although it was just a trace, that was the divine flame ranked eighth on the Heavenly Flame Rankings. Its ranking was even higher than the Heavenly Rainbow Flame. Hence, this kind of fire poison was a joke in front of Long Chen.

Even without the Ice Soul, with Huo Linger’s power, that so-called fire poison was nothing more than a snack.

Seeing this bewildering scene, everyone was stunned. The experts that were together with that person finally had their expressions change.

“Long Chen, stop! That is our Amethyst Firmament Gate’s future gate master. If you dare to harm a single hair-!” shouted the third Heavenstage World King of the Amethyst Firmament Gate.

“Then what? Will you dare to come to the High Firmament Academy for revenge?” Long Chen lightly.

That person was instantly left speechless. Although their Amethyst Firmament Gate did have some power, in the Chaotic Star Sea, they were only a middling power. In terms of fame, they could not compare to the oldest academy of the nine heavens.

“Don’t talk crap! Release the junior gate master! Then we can treat it as if nothing happened!” shouted that World King.

Long Chen ignored this elder and then turned to Yu Qingxuan. “I’m sorry.”

“What is it?” Yu Qingxuan was startled. Why would he suddenly apologize to her?

“In truth, I’m not some good, kind person. My kindness is reserved only for those who are kind. To evil people, I can only be more evil than them. I have never claimed to be an emissary of righteousness. But I will do my best to slaughter all the evil lifeforms that come at me.”

The next moment, Long Chen’s arm quivered and that junior gate master instantly exploded in body and soul.

The death of their junior gate master infuriated the elder in charge of protecting the Amethyst Firmament Gate’s disciples. With a furious roar, he unleashed his divine might.

However, even before he fully entered combat state, Long Chen’s saber fell, bringing those fluctuations to an end.

The sound of a saber returning to its sheath shook the heavens. Within this silent world, it was as loud as thunder.

That elder’s aura vanished. His finger was pointed at Long Chen as if he wanted to say something, but without saying anything, he plummeted to the ground, his corpse splitting into two halves.

This elder was truly a fool. When fighting against others, at this close distance, he actually unleashed his aura over anything else. What enemy would give you time to warm up like that?

Clearly, this was an elder who had eaten too much and lived too peacefully, relying on his fame and cultivation base. His battle will had already regressed. Long Chen naturally wouldn’t give him any chance.

At this moment, the other experts of the Amethyst Firmament Gate were dumbfounded. That elder was their deputy gate master, and he was also the only one capable of constructing the spatial gate to draw in the reinforcements of the Amethyst Firmament Gate.

However, he was already dead. As they had no backer now, they stared in horror at Long Chen, afraid that he would also kill them.

Long Chen had just killed a third Heavenstage World King with a single stroke of his saber. Although that World King was a fool, Long Chen’s movements were clean and effective. There wasn’t the slightest waste.

That relaxed expression of his even after he killed a World King shook countless experts. This was a true expert that had experienced countless battles.

“I’m really sorry. Maybe I tricked you. Maybe I’m not the person that you thought I was.” Long Chen apologized to Yu Qingxuan, whose expression truly was a bit unnatural.

He knew that Yu Qingxuan had a kind and gentle character. She couldn’t bear to kill people normally. However, Long Chen didn’t want to pretend to be someone that he wasn’t, nor could he pretend.

Just now, the junior gate master of the Amethyst Firmament Gate had provoked him. If Long Chen had endured it, that junior gate master wouldn’t have let things go and would have continued to insult Long Chen repeatedly. He would eventually touch upon his parents. After that, Long Chen would still be made to attack.

Furthermore, the longer he restrained himself, the more his negative emotions would grow. That would produce more dark energy, and his heart-devil would grow stronger. He had no other choice.

Yu Qingxuan shook her head. “There’s no need for you to apologize to me. I am not you. My master’s light protects me, so no one will bully me. But you don’t have that protective light. You can only bare your fangs to protect yourself.”

“Thank you.”

Long Chen smiled, feeling a bit moved. Originally, he was afraid that his actions would cause Yu Qingxuan to dislike him. He hadn’t expected her to understand him.

“Why do you thank me?” asked Yu Qingxuan with a smile. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

“Because I said that I wouldn’t let anyone hurt you. That includes me. If I did something that made you feel bad, that would be the greatest sin,” said Long Chen as if relieved from a heavy burden.

“Shut up! Long Chen, you murderous bastard, you dare to act so unashamedly here?!”

Seeing that Long Chen was showing off and still openly flirting with Yu Qingxuan, Zhao Mingxuan was unable to endure any longer. He raged with killing intent.

“Is using despicable means to sneak attack someone whose Blood Qi has regressed something very heroic?! If you’re a real man, you won’t hide behind a woman! Come out and have a fair fight with me!”

Zhao Mingxuan could not endure any longer. He found that Yu Qingxuan was being bewitched by this fellow. He had to kill Long Chen as soon as possible.

Otherwise, if this continued, then the bewitchment would be too deep, and even if Long Chen was slain, it would be too late. Hence, Zhao Mingxuan could no longer wait.

However, before Long Chen could reply, the void shuddered. The Heavenly Flame World’s gates slowly opened as countless runes appeared on them.

When the spatial gates opened, endless flame energy gushed out and this world instantly became a sea of fire.

Furthermore, at this time, countless experts fought through that current of flames to charge through the gates.
