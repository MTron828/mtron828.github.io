Chapter 5015 Battle of Heavenly Chosens

Thirty-two martial stages lit up at the same time. Just as Long Chen had anticipated, every single competitor here proved to be a powerful Heavenly Chosen.

Among them were quite a few disciples of the Long clan, so it seemed like the Long clan wasn’t as weak as they appeared. The Heaven Rankings didn’t represent their full power.

Many disciples had been biding their time, concealing their true abilities until now. They waited for the perfect moment to shine.

For example, Long Ziwei, the former rank ten of the Heaven Rankings, had long since been eliminated. The one who beat him was also a half-step Heavenly Chosen, but even he was halted at the top 128.

This elite competition was truly a mess of hidden dragons and crouching tigers. Many participants had been eagerly awaiting the chance to display their brilliance on this martial stage.

The thirty-two martial stages were numbered sequentially from one to thirty-two, determining the order of the battles. Unlike previous rounds, these fights were not simultaneous. Most competitors sat with closed eyes, seemingly meditating.

They had been in this state for three days, attuning themselves to the martial stage, enhancing their spatial control. After all, in battles among experts, every little advantage mattered.

At this moment, Long Chen’s figure appeared on the first martial stage along with the two competitors. According to tradition, matches from the top thirty-two onward required the head umpire’s direct supervision.

The two competitors slowly opened their eyes, seeing each other and Long Chen. However, when they looked at Long Chen, disdain flickered in their eyes. It was evident they were not convinced by this head umpire.

In the past, the head umpire had always been at least a one heaven vein expert. Long Chen, however, was only in the same realm as them and not even a Heavenly Chosen. Hence, many questioned his qualifications to officiate.

“Hopefully, they wouldn’t accidentally kill the head umpire, or that’d be laughable,” sneered a disciple.

Although Qin Feng had shocked everyone, not many people had seen Long Chen fight. Thus, they greatly doubted his power. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

“Let’s have a peaceful exchange of pointers. Stop before touching your opponent. Friendship is number one, victory is number two...” Long Chen muttered insincerely, going through the motions of formality.

After a mass of nonsense, he finally declared, “Let the competition begin!”

When Long Chen waved the golden scepter, the barrier instantly vanished, and both disciples shouted at the same time.

Two Heavenly Fate Disks whirled, unleashing wild Doyen power like erupting volcanoes. Their movements mirrored each other almost identically as they clashed weapons.

They immediately went all-out, not holding back at all. When their weapons clashed, a powerful explosion shook the martial stage. Seeing a clash between Heavenly Chosens, all the spectators felt their hot blood ignite.

The two disciples roared repeatedly as their saber and sword clashed like shooting stars, moving too swiftly to be tracked by the naked eye.

“What power!”

Seated in the vicinity of the martial stage, Long Ziwei, Qin Feng, Gui Jiu, and others watched intently. Long Ziwei couldn’t help but sigh emotionally at the intense exchange unfolding before them.

After his recent defeat, he had harbored lingering doubts, believing he could have made it into the top thirty-two if not for bad luck.

However, he now realized the vast chasm in skill between himself and these competitors. Just yesterday, Long Ziwei’s Heavenly Fate Ring had evolved into a Heavenly Fate Disk, marking his advancement from a half-step Heavenly Chosen to a true Heavenly Chosen.

Long Ziwei regretted not making that advancement sooner; perhaps then, he wouldn’t have suffered defeat. However, Qin Feng told him that without the bitter battle, without the suppression and stimulation of his opponent’s aura, he wouldn’t have been able to awaken as a Heavenly Chosen so quickly.

Despite that, Long Ziwei was still dissatisfied. But now, he was fully convinced. Even with his newfound power as a Heavenly Chosen, he stood no chance against opponents of this caliber. The gap was simply too immense.

BOOM!

Both of the competitors clashed once more, both of their divine weapons erupting with divine light. This was the strongest exchange since the beginning of the battle.

Raging astral winds and Doyen power cut through the air, covering the solid barrier in fine cracks.

The martial stages had been upgraded after the top 128’s matches. This was the first instance where someone had damaged the barrier since then, highlighting the terrifying power of the two combatants.

“Will Long Chen be okay?” asked Yu Ying worriedly. Such a terrifying power was indiscriminate and could hit Long Chen.

Both competitors were forcefully pushed back to the edge of the martial stage by each other’s strength, demonstrating their equal prowess. Neither could gain the upper hand.

Meanwhile, Long Chen remained in his original location, and the only part of him moving was his hair. He hadn’t budged an inch throughout their intense battle, seemingly unaffected.

When the mercenaries saw this, they couldn’t help but unleash a burst of cheers again. It seemed that their worries had been for nothing.

Under the intense clash of Heavenly Chosens, Long Chen could remain completely indifferent, which showed that his power far surpassed that of the combatants.

Seeing this scene, Feng Fei smiled slightly and rested her chin on her hand, her eyes shining. For some reason, she particularly liked Long Chen’s indifferent look.

She forgot when she had chosen to become a spectator. But afterward, the entire world felt so beautiful to her.

Sometimes, life was just like that. The more one wanted to gain something, the more the heavens would block you from having it.

However, once one stopped desiring it, the heavens would send it right to them. Back then, Long Chen had left her in the dust. But now, she felt like she was getting closer to him, so close that she could finally enjoy his light.

“Kill!”

Suddenly, both combatants roared in unison. Struggling to gain the upper hand for so long, they seemed angry and started to unleash dangerous techniques. This was no longer a simple martial competition. One mistake... and there could be casualties.

BOOM!

In a swift exchange, one swung a sword, and the other deflected it with a saber. Following that, a strange scene occurred: the sword unexpectedly veered toward Long Chen’s throat like a bolt of lightning.

Gasps of alarm erupted from the spectators.
