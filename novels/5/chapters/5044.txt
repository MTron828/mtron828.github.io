Chapter 5033 Slashing Ye Lingxiao

The expressions of the Ye clan’s experts shifted dramatically as Ye Lingxiao spoke. He was now completely under the control of the Lingfeng Sword.

In pursuit of absolute power, Ye Lingxiao had forsaken himself, surrendering his life to the Lingfeng Sword. The one in control of him now was the original master of the Lingfeng Sword: Ye Lingfeng, the ancestor of the Ye clan. He stared at Long Chen, demanding his name before delivering a fatal blow.

Long Chen sighed heavily in response to Ye Lingfeng’s questioning. “Now that we’ve come to this moment, there’s no point in concealing it any longer. In truth, I am your long-lost father!”

Long Chen’s response caused Feng Fei to burst into chuckles. However, no one else found it amusing. They all stared at Long Chen with bewilderment, unable to comprehend what was in his head. How could he joke around at a moment like this?

Ye Lingfeng stared at Long Chen, his thoughts perhaps dulled by merging with an item-spirit. It took him a moment to grasp Long Chen’s words, and his expression darkened.

“Little brat, you dare to be insolent?!” Ye Lingfeng thundered.

Scanning the surroundings, Ye Lingfeng suddenly spotted the Ye clan leader. He bellowed, “Are my descendants of the Ye clan so weak that they require me to personally handle this insolent brat?!”

The Ye clan leader dared not utter a word. This was Ye Lingfeng, an esteemed ancestor of the Ye clan. Seeing that his opponent was a Divine Venerate, he was instantly outraged.

In the past, they had only awakened Ye Lingfeng during dire life-and-death crises for the Ye clan—times when they had no other recourse.

However, Ye Lingxiao actually awakened Ye Lingfeng. Assuming the Ye clan was in crisis, Ye Lingfeng was outraged. They needed him to personally take action against a young Divine Venerate? Had the Ye clan really fallen to this extent?

“Alright, that’s enough. Your dad’s seen you, so you can go back now. This is none of your business,” ordered Long Chen in a kind tone.

“Little brat, your mouth is blasphemous!” Ye Lingfeng’s anger escalated at Long Chen’s audacity, and he swung the Lingfeng Sword directly at him.

“Old fogey, I gave you too much face, was it!? If you don’t back off, you’ll die here!” Long Chen’s kind smile transformed into fury as he also swung Evilmoon.

BOOM!

One sword and one saber clashed with monumental force, causing a massive explosion that shook the very ground, leaving a crater in its wake. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

As their power raged, the barriers above their heads started to shatter. Eighteen barriers shattered in a row, shocking the higher-ups of the divine clans. None of them had expected Long Chen to possess such power.

Most terrifying of all, Evilmoon pressed down relentlessly on Ye Lingfeng’s sword. As their powers continued to escalate, the ground beneath them sank further, and more barriers shattered.

BOOM!

Suddenly, Long Chen and Ye Lingfeng shot back at the same time. They then charged at each other like bolts of lightning.

Saber-light and sword-images filled the air as they exchanged hundreds of blows. Amidst the storm of flying dust, their figures were obscured, and only the sharp clashes of sword and saber could be heard.

“Tch, as I said, you’re nothing more than an amateur sword cultivator. If Yue Zifeng were here, I’d be amazed if you could last more than three moves,” sneered Long Chen.

BOOM!

Suddenly, a giant saber-image soared into the sky, and a figure was sent flying. The one that was blasted away was Ye Lingxiao, who had been possessed by Ye Lingfeng.

“Little brat, don’t be so arrogant!” Ye Lingfeng roared and pointed his sword at the sky. Suddenly, runes swirled around him, and his aura soared.

“Ancestor, don’t! Lingxiao cannot endure that!” cried out the Ye clan leader.

The Ye clan leader didn’t want Ye Lingxiao to use the complete Lingfeng Possession precisely due to this. Ye Lingfeng was one of their ancient patriarchs, one whose power was ranked in the top ten throughout the entire history of the Ye clan.

Due to the limitations of his current vessel, Ye Lingfeng couldn’t fully unleash his power. He drew upon the energy of heaven and earth, channeling it into the Heavenly Fate Disk to amplify his strength. Hence, he only struggled because Ye Lingxiao was weaker. In his fury, Ye Lingfeng even disregarded Ye Lingxiao’s survival.

Suddenly, cracks fissured across Ye Lingxiao’s Heavenly Fate Disk as his body neared its breaking point.

“Lingfeng Divine Execution!” Ye Lingfeng bellowed, swinging his sword with a strike that combined his and Ye Lingxiao’s full power. The force of this attack reverberated through heaven and earth.

Even the people outside the martial stage felt a chilling dread. They found themselves unable to move, locked down by the sheer force of the sword’s will.

Long Yaoting, a one-vein Heaven Saint, felt his soul shuddering in front of this attack. This blow definitely had the ability to kill him; it would crush him without fail.

“You will die fully convinced of your defeat! Split the Heavens - Six Forms in One!” shouted Long Chen.

Raising Evilmoon, Long Chen conjured six Split the Heavens runes and a sinister qi around it. Empowered by the Dragon Blood Battle Armor, Evilmoon let out a brilliant dragon cry that resounded throughout the sky. As it fell, it seemed to bring forth a river of stars.

BOOM!

The earth was torn asunder, and over fifty barriers shattered instantly. Terrifying gusts blew through the martial stage, some of their force breaking through the barriers and striking the spectators.

Countless individuals were hurled into the air, some coughing blood as chaos ensued. No one had anticipated that their power could penetrate all the barriers, toppling their understanding of what power was.

Amidst the chaos, all eyes remained fixed on the martial stage. As the dust settled, the figures of Long Chen and Ye Lingxiao emerged.

Long Chen remained poised in his slashing stance, while Ye Lingxiao shook, his eyes devoid of life.

Suddenly, the Lingfeng Sword started to disintegrate, clattering to the ground piece by piece.

“What?!”

The Ye clan’s experts were utterly stunned. The Lingfeng Sword was shattered? That could only mean...

As the Lingfeng Sword fell apart, Ye Lingxiao’s body swayed and collapsed.

His collapse wasn’t just a simple fall. It was as if his body crumbled inward, like a sculpture corroded beyond recognition. Long Chen’s saber had annihilated his body and soul. Ye Lingxiao was dead.

An uproar exploded. Ye Lingxiao had actually perished. An ancient heavenly genius whom other Heavenly Chosens could only look up to had died.

Long Chen casually rested Evilmoon on his shoulder and turned lazily toward a distant figure.

“Do you want to do it yourself, or should I lend you a hand?”
