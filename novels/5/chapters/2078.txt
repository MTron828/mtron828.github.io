Long Chen ignored Zhao Wuji as if he didn’t see him. He was focused on the pill furnace.

“Mister Zhao, this place is the Dongfang family...” The attendant’s expression changed. If she allowed Zhao Wuji to fight Long Chen here, things would take a bad turn.

Nangong Zuiyue and Beitang Rushuang just watched indifferently, not feeling worried at all. They knew that Zhao Wuji did not dare to actually fight here.

Long Chen’s divine sense slowly entered the furnace, and he sensed the majestic energy shuddering within. That energy made Long Chen feel increasingly delighted. This time, he had definitely profited.

“So Long Chen, do you want to kill yourself now?” Zhao Wuji pointed at Long Chen and shouted coldly. This was an extremely arrogant and insulting action.

“Scram!”

Without even thinking about it, Long Chen slapped Zhao Wuji in the face.

Nangong Zuiyue, Beitang Rushuang, and the attendant only saw a blur before Long Chen’s hand struck Zhao Wuji’s face.

Zhao Wuji was instantly sent flying. Nangong Zuiyue and Beitang Rushuang covered their mouths in disbelief.

Although Zhao Wuji was trash as a person, everyone had to admit that he was a terrifying existence. In his generation, practically no one had dared to ever provoke him. Although it hadn’t reached the point that he had ruled over the continent, he had definitely become a nightmare for countless experts.

That was why he was qualified to be invited here, because he had the power to stand beside the other peak geniuses of their times. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

Even Nangong Zuiyue had described him as terrifying to Long Chen. That was enough to show just how powerful he was.

However, to handle Zhao Wuji, all Long Chen did was slap him in the face. Nangong Zuiyue and Beitang Rushuang were stunned. The attendant of the Dongfang family hastily crushed a jade tablet.

The reason that Nangong Zuiyue and Beitang Rushuang were so shocked was because in that instant, it had felt like time had come to a stop and space had frozen. Long Chen’s slap had contained its own kind of law. Before anyone realized what was happening, it was already over.

Most importantly, Long Chen’s slap was incredibly beautiful, flowing naturally like water. A slap was clearly a lackluster move but had been developed into a divine art by Long Chen.

After this slap, Long Chen’s expression changed. His hand was now bloody, and there were dozens of tiny holes that had pierced into his hand.

Then he looked at Zhao Wuji. The right side of his face was covered in a layer of scales. Those scales were filled with tiny needle points like barbs.

There was blood dripping down, but that blood was Long Chen’s. Those barbs still had some of his flesh hanging to them.

Zhao Wuji was infuriated. The inside of his mouth was bloody, so he had his mouth shut tightly. Half his teeth had been knocked out, but he silently swallowed them.

This slap of Long Chen’s had come too suddenly for him to react. His armor had come out automatically to counter Long Chen’s attack, but its reaction had been slow. This was a terrifying kind of armor that could block attacks that he couldn’t sense, and it was what he had relied on to dominate the continent back in his era.

However, this amazing armor had lost its effectiveness today. It had only started to counterattack after being struck. This was something that had never happened to him before.

“How vile. There’s actually poison.” Long Chen snorted and swung his hand. His palm, which had already started turning black, had most of its flesh fly off. At the same time, the primal chaos space’s life energy surged toward his hand, instantly healing it.

Long Chen was shocked inside. His divine face-slapping art was his peerless technique. It had actually been half-blocked this time. If Zhao Wuji’s scaled armor hadn’t appeared at the last moment, this slap would have destroyed half his head.

“Long Chen, since you want to die, I’ll help you out!” Zhao Wuji roared furiously, killing intent instantly locking onto Long Chen.

“Halt!”

A cold and clear voice rang out and a white-robed man appeared. At the same time, countless other figures also rushed over, drawn by the disturbance.

The white-robed man was the Dongfang family’s supreme genius, Dongfang Yuyang.

Dongfang Yuyang had originally been busy handling other matters. However, having received an alarm from this region, he had immediately rushed over, only to see the bloody Zhao Wuji and the icy Long Chen.

As soon as Dongfang Yuyang arrived, the attendant explained everything that had happened with divine sense.

“Dongfang Yuyang, didn’t you say that this was a gathering of heroes with grand hearts? Then how did that idiot end up coming here? Are you sure that this is the gathering of past and present heroes?” demanded Long Chen.

Originally, the reason why Long Chen didn’t feel like coming here was because he didn’t want to encounter idiots like this, but Dongfang Yuyang had reassured him that there wouldn’t be.

As a result, before the gathering even truly began, he had encountered this Zhao Wuji. He was extremely irritated. Could it be that he was a natural magnet for idiots?

Seeing Dongfang Yuyang, the other experts nodded to him in greeting.

On the other hand, upon seeing Zhao Wuji, an expression of disgust appeared on their faces, but there was also some fear.

As for their reaction when they saw Long Chen, they looked a bit surprised. They hadn’t expected that a genius from the current generation would be so brazen as to attack Zhao Wuji here. That wasn’t giving Dongfang Yuyang any face.

“Brother Long, calm down. I already understand what happened. I will deal with it.” Dongfang Yuyang cupped his fists to Long Chen before facing Zhao Wuji. “Brother Zhao, this place is my Dongfang family. Don’t you think your actions are a bit inappropriate?”

“It was clearly Long Chen who was the bully and attacked first!” Zhao Wuji’s expression sank.

“A trade was carried out fairly. So why did you have to insult others? Long Chen bought your item, but you deliberately insulted him. Is such conduct worthy of a generation’s top genius? Isn’t pointing your finger at other people’s faces a provocation? I gave you an invitation because we are all outstanding talents of the Martial Heaven Continent’s cultivation world. I thought that after being sealed for so many years, your heart would have calmed down, but you’ve disappointed me. The coming of the qi flow eruption indicates that the dark era is approaching. If we continue fighting amongst ourselves, the world will no longer exist. Your enmity with Long Chen did not start here in my Dongfang family, so don’t bring your enmity in. If you don’t give Long Chen an explanation today, then sorry, I can only ask you to leave.”

Long Chen was surprised. He hadn’t expected Dongfang Yuyang to be so daring. He was actually treating Zhao Wuji like this. Now, Long Chen felt a little better.

The other experts were also surprised, not expecting Dongfang Yuyang to care so much about Long Chen, an expert from the current declined era.

Zhao Wuji’s expression changed several times. In the end, he surprisingly said, “Long Chen, I apologize. I shouldn’t have been so rude to you. However, this matter is separate. I was wrong just now, but I will still have to make you pay your debt for killing disciples of my Mechanism Sect. Prepare yourself, because once you leave the Dongfang family, I, Zhao Wuji, will cut off your head.”

Although it was an apology, his position was clear. This apology was just giving face to Dongfang Yuyang.

He wouldn’t attack Long Chen here. But as soon as Long Chen left the Dongfang family, Zhao Wuji would have no more misgivings. This way, he was giving the Dongfang family face and preserving his own face. It was also his challenge to Long Chen, which Long Chen couldn’t refuse.

As long as Long Chen had the slightest dignity, he would have to accept this challenge. Otherwise, his reputation would plummet. It could be said that this move of Zhao Wuji’s was quite brilliant.

All the experts that had been drawn over looked at Long Chen, only to see him smiling. “The world is already filled with my enemies. Adding you in or not doesn’t matter. If you want to fight, I’ll accompany you.”

“Good. I was worried you would hide in the Dongfang family’s residence for a lifetime. Let us have our fight when the time comes!” sneered Zhao Wuji.

Seeing Long Chen and Zhao Wuji agree to have a fight so quickly, the experts present couldn’t help being a bit surprised. This was a battle between two top geniuses from the ancient era and the current era. One of them might fall.

As Long Chen was an expert from this declined era, people felt that the infamous Zhao Wuji had better odds of winning. Many people had already seen Long Chen’s trump cards, and they knew of his background. In comparison, the Mechanism Sect might be a tumor in the cultivation world, but it had existed for countless years.

“Long Chen, you shouldn’t agree to fight him. You can’t imagine just how terrifying he is.” Nangong Zuiyue sent him a message via divine sense.

“Long Chen, you’re being too hot-headed. Although this person is trash, he’s sinister and powerful. Even we wouldn’t want to fight him.” Beitang Rushuang also sent him a message.

However, Long Chen’s answer had come too quickly for them to stop. Long Chen simply smiled, not feeling any pressure.

Long Chen placed the pill furnace on the ground. Looking at Zhao Wuji, he said, “Didn’t you say that this pill furnace was a garbage furnace? Actually, I really pity you. Young people are really blind. I’ll let you see what a true treasure is, and just how blind you are.”

After saying that, Long Chen reached for the lid. Everyone’s gazes locked onto his hand.
