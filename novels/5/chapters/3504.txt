Chapter 3493

Long Chen was turned into an ice sculpture. Furthermore, a transparent aura flowed on top of this ice, and it was clearly that of a raging hot flame.

The flames burned the dome of the heavens. At first, the giant mountain was encased in ice, but the next moment, the freezing cold turned into a burning heat like lava. Ice and fire mixed. As a result, the earth disintegrated and the void twisted.

In just the blink of an eye, Long Chen’s mountain turned into nothingness. It was completely gone. There was no more ice, no more fire.

It was like everything had just been a dream. Long Chen couldn’t help sucking in a cold gasp of air. He simply used the method that Bai Fang had taught him to draw out a trace of the Ice Soul’s power. That trace of power was less than one percent of its max power, but it was already so terrifying.

If Long Chen hadn’t had Huo Linger protect him, then caught off-guard, this trace of power could very likely have caused serious wounds to him.

Even with Huo Linger’s protection, Long Chen felt pain throughout his body. It wasn’t just pain. With cold and hot mixing, it felt like his body would explode.

The Ice Soul Divine Flame possessed the contrasting forces of utmost cold and utmost heat. The flames outside were hot, while the core of the flame was cold. It was a flame that had exceeded the scope of common sense.

Moreover, it had no color and was transparent. But its power was so terrifying that it far surpassed Long Chen’s expectations.

“The Ice Soul Divine Flame is ranked even higher than the Heavenly Rainbow Flame. As expected, it lives up to its reputation. This is just a single rune of it, but it possesses the power to destroy heaven and earth.” Based on Long Chen’s estimation, this was not the true Ice Soul Divine Flame. It was a rune of the Ice Soul Divine Flame that had been sealed inside a piece of jade.

Long Chen had met the Heavenly Rainbow Fairy and had also seen how terrifying the Heavenly Rainbow Flame was in her memories. If this Ice Soul Divine Flame was ranked above the Heavenly Rainbow Flame, then it had to be even stronger.

However, even Bai Fang didn’t know the origins of this rune. He only knew how to activate it. Without the activation method, if it was forcibly opened, this rune would instantly detonate. Then no one could obtain it.

“Big brother Long Chen, give it to me. Through that test just now, I found that it doesn’t reject me. Let me slowly commune with it and see if I can merge with it,” said Huo Linger.

Before activating the divine jade, Long Chen had told Huo Linger to prepare herself. For her to say that she wasn’t rejected by the Ice Soul, he was excited.

If Huo Linger could control this rune and condense the Ice Soul power, then would he have to fear a third Heavenstage World King?

“Huo Linger, commune with it slowly. There’s no rush to merge with it. I still urgently need you,” said Long Chen.

Huo Linger wasn’t just helping him during battle. She had to be there for refining pills. If Huo Linger fell into slumber due to absorbing the Ice Soul Divine Flame, Long Chen would be affected in terms of both battle and cultivation.

Right now, his situation was not favorable, so he had no choice but to be careful. One wrong step and he would lose his life. He didn’t dare to be careless.

Huo Linger obediently nodded. After taking the Ice Soul Divine Jade, she returned to the primal chaos space.

The Ice Soul Divine Jade had been activated and Huo Linger could slowly absorb it. Although it was just a single rune of the Ice Soul Divine Flame, it was still enough to completely transform Huo Linger. As long as she learned how to use this rune, her combat power would soar to a level that even Long Chen couldn’t estimate. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

Before this, when he was researching the Lightning Flames Devour the Heavens, he encountered a problem. That was that Huo Linger’s power was clearly lower than Lei Linger’s.

Moreover, Lei Linger‘s control over her own power wasn’t perfect enough, resulting in him not making any headway with the Lightning Flames Devour the Heavens.

If Huo Linger merged with this rune, he trusted that with her powerful control, she would be able to strike a balance. Then perhaps the true Lightning Flames Devour the Heavens could be unleashed.

This Ice Soul Divine Flame rune’s origins had to be extraordinary. That was the feeling that Long Chen got. Regretfully, the Bai family had declined, and other than the activation method, they hadn’t managed to preserve anything else about it.

In any case though, reclaiming the Ice Soul Divine Jade could comfort the spirits of Bai Fang and Bai Rui.

As for the Soaring Dragon Company that had caused their deaths, he was in no rush to deal with them. He knew that they were definitely searching through the world for him.

“Haha, I’m rich!”

Only now did Long Chen have an opportunity to open the Soaring Dragon Company’s treasury. After checking carefully, he cried out in excitement.

“No wonder people say that no one gets rich without unscrupulous money. As expected, robbing others really is the quickest shortcut to getting rich.”

Long Chen looked at the endless treasures within the treasury and was wild with delight. There were medicinal ingredients, pills, ancient tomes, divine weapons, and all kinds of treasures. They were endless.

This iron case was its own space and it was filled with treasures. They were all organized very clearly.

“Damn, they really have a full collection. They have every ingredient to refine the Violet Tower Pill.”

Long Chen first checked the ingredients and found that they had a complete collection. Even the rare ingredients of the Violet Tower Pill were present in decent quantities. No wonder the Soaring Dragon Company was said to be an existence that could challenge the Huayun Trading Company. Only after looking in their treasury did he understand just how frightening their wealth was.

All kinds of cultivation techniques and secret tomes were present, but Long Chen didn’t even bother flipping through them. He couldn’t bite off more than he could chew. He just had to focus on the Nine Star Hegemon Body Art.

“This weapon!”

Long Chen took out a halberd and gasped. This weapon had ancient runes carved into it, and they gave him a sense of immense pressure.

This weapon seemed to have an ancient desolate beast sealed inside of it. Once its runes were activated, it would unleash terrifying power.

“This is probably a weapon specific to powerful World Kings, a World Domain divine item. Once such a divine weapon is activated at full power, it can destroy an entire domain. I wonder if it’s true.”

Long Chen stared at the halberd with his heart pounding wildly. If that dark-faced Yu Shu had been wielding such a terrifying halberd, would Long Chen still have been a match for him?

Long Chen carefully looked at where he had found this weapon. There were over ten thousand divine weapons, with the majority being King items. Furthermore, they were top grade King items. There were also some rusty weapons whose item-spirits had died. But many runes carved onto them were still clear. Long Chen estimated that some of these runes had research value, which was why they were kept.

As for World Domain divine items, there were three. One was the halberd in his hand, the other one was a warhammer, and the last one was a shield.

Regretfully, only a powerful World King could unleash their potential. It was said that they possessed World Domain energy, and only such a power could activate a World Domain divine item.

The discovery of the World Domain divine items made Long Chen’s heart grow a bit heavy. Now that he had arrived in the Violet Flame Heaven, he experienced just how different the cultivators here were compared to the Darklight Heaven. Their resources were far more powerful.

Suddenly, a rumbling sound came from behind him. Long Chen was startled. He then turned to see the Minghong Saber quivering and the sheath’s runes flickering. A powerful aura was undulating.

“Could it be…?!” Long Chen was delighted.
