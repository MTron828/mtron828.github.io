Chapter 2212 The Remains Return to Haunt

Long Chen frowned. Just who was so arrogant? Long Chen pulled back Long Xiaoyu, avoiding those people.

What surprised Long Chen was that these people were actually wearing the robes of the Grand Han Ancient Nation. Most of them had reached the peak of the Life Star realm.

Behind them was a group of old people in gray robes. There was golden embroidery around their sleeves and a cloud pattern on the front of their robes. These elders were all Netherpassage experts.

“Hold it! You dare to be rude to miss Xiaoyu!?” The guards got angry at their disregard for Long Xiaoyu’s safety and immediately raised their spears.

“Which little fly dares to block my path? Scram.”

From the Grand Han’s group of experts, a young man with a violet-gold crown snorted. It was just a snort, but it contained a powerful spiritual pressure.

These guards were only at the Foundation Forging realm. As a result, this snort instantly knocked them back. Blood poured out of their seven orifices.

“Experts with awakened Spirit Blood?” Now Long Chen was even more surprised. That person’s Spirit Blood was awakened. But he didn’t recall seeing this person in front of the Yin Yang World.

“Courting death!” Dong Mingyu’s expression became cold, but Long Chen pulled her back. The guards were only knocked unconscious, and there was no danger to their lives. He wanted to see just what these people were doing.

That man with the crown only targeted the guards and hadn’t even glanced at anyone else. Just like that, he barged in.

He hadn’t noticed Long Chen or Dong Mingyu, making Long Chen sneer. Although the two of them had disguised themselves, any real expert’s sharp intuition would have been able to sense them.

Just from this, it was possible to tell that although his Spirit Blood was awakened, his true combat power could only be called average. He was a far cry from Tian Xiezi or Kun Pengzi.

Countless experts began to rush over after hearing the disturbance. However, the crowned man only snorted and charged through anyone in his way.

It was possible to directly fly or jump to the top of the Heavenly Cloud Platform, but these people refused to. They charged their way up.

Long Chen pulled Long Xiaoyu and Dong Mingyu behind him, keeping a medium distance behind this group. There was constant shouting as people tried to stop them, but they didn’t have the ability to.

They quickly arrived at the top of the Heavenly Cloud Platform. As a result, the performance on the grand stage had stopped because of these people. The performers were staring at them in surprise.

The tens of thousands of people were all startled by this interruption. They were mostly descendants of the officials in the Grand Xia, as only youngsters were participating in the Lantern Festival.

“Who are you to dare to cause trouble here?” shouted someone from the stage. The speaker was one of the Grand Xia’s princes, Xia Yunchong. Beside him was the crown prince, Xia Yunfeng. Xia Youluo was also present.

Xia Yunchong and Xia Youluo both had angry expressions. This was a slap in the Grand Xia’s face.

“Who are we? Are you blind? Don’t you even recognize the robes of the Grand Han’s imperial family? The Grand Xia, Grand Chu, and Grand Zhou used despicable methods to throw my nation into chaos and slaughter our commoners. Today, I, Han Zijun, have come to demand an explanation from the Grand Xia. If you don’t give me a satisfactory explanation, I will destroy your capital city.” The crowned man sneered.

“Big words. With just you?” Xia Yunchong furiously walked forward. Brushing past Xia Yunfeng that was holding him back, he smashed a fist at the crowned man. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

This fist had all Xia Yunchong’s power concentrated in one spot. It wouldn’t harm anyone other than the crowned man.

At this time, Xia Yunchong’s cultivation base had reached the eighth Heavenstage of Life Star and adding on his Undefeatable Dao, his power was shocking.

“An ant dares to fight against a dragon?” The crowned man who had called himself Han Zijun looked down on Xia Yunchong disdainfully. He raised a hand.

Xia Yunchong’s fierce fist was caught by Han Zijun’s hand. After that, Xia Yunchong froze as he realized that his opponent’s power far surpassed his. He couldn’t even pull back his fist.

“Scram!” Han Zijun waved his hand, sending Xia Yunchong flying toward the stage. If he struck it, the stage would explode, and the performers would definitely be killed.

Nine dragon images appeared behind Xia Yunchong, and he forcibly stabilized himself in the air.

“Hmph, you even extracted the dragon vein energy of my Grand Han. Today, no matter what, I’ll be taking it back with interest.” Han Zijun wasn’t just looking at Xia Yunchong. His gaze encompassed the princes from the Grand Zhou and Grand Chu. This Lantern Festival was a grand occasion, so princes from the Grand Zhou and Grand Chu had been invited. This Han Zijun had come prepared.

All the experts’ expressions changed. Some of them began to run.

“Don’t move! Otherwise, you’ll die,” shouted Han Zijun. Those runners instantly came to a terrified stop.

“Bastard, if you have the guts, then let’s fight outside the city!” roared Xia Yunchong furiously, and his manifestation rumbled behind him. The nine dragons connected with their dragon vein, the karmic luck of the Grand Xia.

However, this was the capital of the Grand Xia. If he fought here all out, then countless commoners would die.

“An ant who hasn’t even awakened their Spirit Blood isn’t qualified to fight me. Emperor of the Grand Xia, get the hell out here. If you don’t give me an explanation, then I, Han Zijun, will destroy your capital city!” shouted Han Zijun, his voice resounding through the city, causing countless commoners to turn pale. In their fright, they began to flee.

Countless hearts tightened. In their panic, the crying of children could be heard.

“Hmph, big words. I want to see if you really have that ability.”

The emperor of the Grand Xia, Xia Yuyang, appeared. Beside him was the same white-haired elder, Xia Yunchong’s master. At the same time, other experts of the Grand Xia arrived, surrounding the Heavenly Cloud Platform.

Xia Yuyang’s bearing was as steady as when Long Chen had first met him. He looked at Han Zijun coldly. “Your Grand Han’s evil actions have consequences, and they are your own responsibility. Don’t blame the gods or other people.”

“Bullshit. It was your three nations that envied my Grand Han’s culture and foundation. Fearing our power, you set up a sinister scheme to harm us. You invaded our great nation, stole our resources, and extracted the karmic luck of our dragon vein. The most shameless people in the world are you. All the Grand Xia’s legacies were stolen from my Grand Han. Who knows what unimaginable crimes you thieves have done without people knowing!” shouted Han Zijun.

Hearing this, Long Chen nodded, surprising Dong Mingyu. “Big brother Long Chen, do you approve of his words?”

Long Chen shook his head. “No, I’m just amazed that someone could be so shameless. Only the Grand Han’s people have the bravery to say such shameless things. Other people simply can’t learn this skill. Because of it, I can definitely confirm that he comes from the Grand Han. There’s no way to imitate this shamelessness. The difficulty of such a thing is on the same level as defying the heavens.”

Before this, Long Chen had suspected that someone was disguising themselves as being from the Grand Han to cause trouble. But after hearing this, Long Chen was sure they were from the Grand Han.

It was just that he was curious how that was possible. In the Four Nations Ancient Remnant, he had slain the Grand Han’s princes. That had dealt a serious blow to the Grand Han.

Then the Grand Han had held the Dragon Slaughtering Convention. That battle had destroyed the capital of the Grand Han, and in their injured state, the imperial family collapsed, ushering in a new age for the Grand Han.

There had been no need for anyone else to interfere. They had directly fallen into chaos with a never-ending battle inside their own borders. As for the commoners, there was no way for them to live a peaceful life.

“What absurd lies. The Grand Han’s imperial family held the Dragon Slaughtering Convention despite the opposition from the commoners, which resulted in your capital being destroyed, infuriating your commoners. You simply disintegrated. Not a single soldier from the Grand Xia, Grand Chu, or Grand Zhou was mobilized. Furthermore, your dragon vein was destroyed by yourselves when you fought there. The dragon vein qi merged back into the world and was naturally absorbed by the other three dragon veins inside the ancient nations. These are all the results of the Han imperial family’s decisions. For you to blame others now, your Grand Han really is shameless. The three great nations even carved out an area for refugees fleeing your Grand Han to escape the bitterness of war. We’ve already been merciful, and yet you have the face to say such things?” sneered Xia Yuyang.

As he shouted, he spoke spiritually to the elder beside him. “I already sent people to the Wine God Palace for assistance. Why is there no reply?”

From the moment Han Zijun had appeared, Xia Yuyang had known that things were bad. The other side had come prepared, and the current Grand Xia was unable to handle such an existence, so he had asked for help from the Wine God Palace.

According to reason, even if the Wine God Palace refused to send help, they should have sent a reply. But there was no movement from them, so Xia Yuyang could only do his best to stall.

“The Wine God Palace just sent a reply, telling us not to worry,” said the white-haired elder.

Hearing that, Xia Yuyang was much more at ease. His confidence grew.

“You’re the one making up lies. You were merciful? You set up a place for refugees? What a joke! Just listen to the heartfelt cries of those refugees!” shouted Han Zijun.

Suddenly, a flying boat appeared in the sky. There were countless commoners of the Grand Han on top, their clothes in tatters and their faces covered in filth. They began to cry out, pointing at Xia Yuyang.

“You bastards, you treated us as slaves, using us for constant labor! Many of us were starved to death! You beasts, we wish we could treat you the way you treated us...”

As they began to shout, everyone in the Grand Xia’s capital began to grow furious, icy killing intent appearing in their eyes.
