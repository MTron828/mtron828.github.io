Chapter 4577 Poison Dragon Race

Long Chen followed the white dragon race forward. From them, he learned that this place was called the dragon cemetery because millions of Ten Thousand Dragon Nests were buried here.

According to the white dragon race’s records, an ancient and terrifying battle once erupted at this very location, resulting in the complete devastation of the old world.

Aside from the dragon cemetery, there were also other burial grounds scattered throughout the area. However, because they were all from the dragon race, they immediately came here.

All the dragon domain’s experts had a detailed map of the dragon cemetery, which recorded the shortest route to their own inheritance lands.

According to Bai Yingxue, the dragon cemetery had existed here for countless years. At first, these Ten Thousand Dragon Nests brimmed with vitality. However, without the support of more dragon experts, the Ten Thousand Dragon Nests started to degrade. As the ones in the outer regions were all comparatively weaker, they were the first to succumb to decay.

Luckily, the Sovereign scale continued to support the Ten Thousand Dragon Nests at the core region, supplying them with a powerful lifeforce, including that of the white dragon race.

Because of it, the Ten Thousand Dragon Nest of the white dragon race could preserve their ancestral dragon reverse scale very well. However, this also posed a significant problem. Because the scale was perfectly preserved, its power was absolutely terrifying, thwarting the white dragon race’s attempt to reclaim it for countless years.

In truth, the white dragon race wasn’t alone in this struggle. The other dragon races were also in a similar position. After all, taking their ancestral reverse scale not only required facing the reverse scale’s sacred energy but also the power of the entire Ten Thousand Dragon Nest.

These Ten Thousand Dragon Nests couldn’t be compared to the one Long Chen had taken before, as each of them contained their ancestral dragon’s reverse scale.

An ancestral dragon was the progenitor of a whole new branch within the dragon race. In human terms, they could be likened to the founders of a first-rate sect.

The dragon race relied heavily on their bloodline inheritance, but the ancestral dragon had the ability to create a new branch on top of the foundation of their original bloodline and divine abilities. Such an extraordinary being might emerge only once in a million years within the dragon race.

Their power, talent, and bloodline were beyond comprehension. Even after countless years had passed, and their reverse scales had weakened to less than a tenth of their original power, attempting to control the reverse scale of such a being was as difficult as ascending the heavens.

This mission indeed discouraged countless young members of the dragon race. Theoretically, due to their shared lineage and the diminished energy of the dragon scale, the scale’s resistance was at its lowest. They should be able to subdue the dragon scale if they passed the basic test.

Despite that, it remained an insurmountable challenge even after countless years, so even Bai Yingxue doubted the likelihood of them getting their ancestral dragon’s reverse scale. However, since the dragon cemetery had opened, she naturally had to give it a shot.

According to Bai Yingxue, the white dragon race’s ancestral dragon reverse scale possessed a sacred energy capable of purifying a dragon’s bloodline.

Hence, even if she couldn’t subdue the dragon scale, she could undergo bloodline purification with it. While this process wouldn’t result in a complete transformation of the body, it could significantly enhance a person’s strength. It might even awaken the user’s dormant ancient divine abilities.

However, even after undergoing the purification process, the task of subduing the dragon scale and returning it to their branch remained nearly impossible.

If they could bring that reverse scale back to their branch, everyone there—regardless of age or cultivation base—would be able to receive the baptism of its dragon blood, which could boost their entire race’s bloodline purity.

If that happened, the future generations would be able to awaken stronger bloodlines, forming a positive feedback loop. Something like this could revive an entire race. This was why all the dragon races were going all-out to obtain their ancestral dragon reverse scale. After all, it was related to the rise and fall of their entire branch.

“Brother Long, you are a human, but I can sense a powerful Sovereign qi in your bloodline. If you trust me, you can follow us to the white dragon race’s dragon nest. After undergoing our ancestral dragon’s sacred energy baptism, perhaps you can awaken your slumbering Sovereign qi,” said Bai Yingxue.

Looking at Bai Yingxue’s pure eyes, Long Chen couldn’t help sighing inside. He hadn’t expected a branch of the dragon race to be as kind as the Spirit race.

“Of course I trust you. I’m indebted to you for looking after me, so I’ll thicken my face and follow along. Thank you.” Long Chen cupped his fists.

Bai Yingxue smiled at his response. “Brother Long is too courteous. You must be a major figure in the human race, or you wouldn’t have such Sovereign qi. Traveling with Brother Long also makes us feel much safer, so I should be the one thanking you for accompanying us.”

“Hahaha, well said, well said,” Long Chen laughed. This Bai Yingxue seemed gentle and refined at the first glance, but surprisingly, she was also straightforward and heroic.

Perhaps the dragon race’s bloodline made Bai Yingxue disdain lying. She invited Long Chen partially because she wanted to see if the white dragon race’s ancestral dragon reverse scale could help Long Chen get stronger.

The moment Long Chen arrived, all the experts of the white dragon race detected a faint trace of Sovereign qi, seemingly present yet elusive. As they possessed the keenest senses among all dragon races, not a single one of them doubted Long Chen, nor did they harbor any suspicion toward him.

This point was quite similar to Long Chen. Long Chen also relied on feeling when dealing with people. In all these years, his senses had never deceived him.

For Long Chen, accompanying them was a mutually beneficial relationship.

Just as they were rapidly progressing, a group of experts brushed past them inside the channel. The moment they came into contact with each other, Long Chen detected a fishy smell in the air.

“Poison dragon race?”

Long Chen was startled to see these experts exuding an extremely toxic substance. As an alchemist, he was extremely sensitive to such a thing. Although these people didn’t intentionally expose their identity, Long Chen’s nose was just out of this world.

“Eh?”

These experts stared at Long Chen oddly after seeing him together with the white dragon race. However, they didn’t provoke him. No one knew if it was because of the white dragon race’s reputation or if they were simply in a rush, but despite recognizing Long Chen’s identity as a human, they didn’t do anything drastic.

Eventually, everyone reached the core of another Ten Thousand Dragon Nest. Suddenly, a rumbling sound echoed, and a figure burst forth like a lightning bolt, heading straight toward the white dragon race. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

This figure moved with incredible speed, catching everyone off guard. By the time they reacted, it was already standing in front of Bai Yingxue. Just as she prepared to react, a hand swiftly intercepted the figure, causing it to spew out a mouthful of blood.
