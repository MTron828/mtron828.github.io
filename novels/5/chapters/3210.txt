Chapter 3199 Seventh Star - Violet Tower

The whirlpool was right below his Dantian, corresponding exactly with the Nethergate Star above his Dantian.

However, it wasn’t a star yet but just a tiny whirlpool. Originally, this location was empty, but after Long Chen had advanced to the Four Peak realm, this whirlpool appeared.

“Violet Tower Star.”

A name appeared in Long Chen’s mind as soon as he saw the whirlpool, along with a complicated pill formula.

“The Violet Tower Pill’s main ingredient is the Devil Eye Water Lily? That’s a lifeform of the Undying race!”

Although he was mentally prepared when he read through the pill formula, his heart sank when he saw the names of the ingredients.

The Devil Eye Water Lily was a terrifying existence of the Undying race. Its position was only second to the Undying Willow. It was said that when its devil eye opened, all spirits had to submit.

Furthermore, the Devil Eye Water Lily only existed in the crack between the devil world and the Undying world. Long Chen had read through many books but only knew its name. He didn’t even know what it looked like.

If he wanted to obtain the Devil Eye Water Lily, he would have to set foot into that terrifying crack. There was no way to describe just how far away that was from the Heavenly Swell Domain.

There were also other difficult ingredients to gather. The eye of the devil dragon, the fang of the bloodbat, the gall of the deep sea soaring serpent… Furthermore, these lifeforms had to have reached the fourth rank. In other words, the level of Divine Lords.

“The Violet Tower Pill is a fourth tier medicinal pill. In other words, I have to become a Divine Lord before condensing the seventh star.”

Long Chen had condensed the sixth star a bit too early, resulting in a deviation from the original path. Although he had managed to condense the Six Star Battle Armor, it had never reached its original potential.

After igniting his divine flames, he found that this deviation was definitely not a good thing. His foundation with the Nine Star Hegemon Body Art was unstable, so he didn’t want to take any further risks with it.

“Fortunately, there’s still enough time. I can take this slowly.”

Long Chen comforted himself. He had just advanced to the Four Peak realm, but the cyclone of the seventh star had appeared. It should be the preparation for the seventh star.

Such a thing had never occurred before. This made him feel like the seventh star was different from the previous six stars. The cyclone appeared before he consumed any pills, and it gave off a domineering feeling of refusing to wait.

Furthermore, he also noticed a cyclone covering the Fengfu, Alioth, Life Fate, Enlightenment Palace, Divine Gate, and Nethergate Stars.

Long Chen suddenly thought of how when he had forcibly tried to absorb the black sword’s power. Back then, the Six Star Battle Armor automatically appeared and unleashed its divine might. That wave of power shattered all the lightning swords other than the black swords.

Now that he thought back to it, he wondered if these cyclones were related to that. The Nine Star Hegemon Body Art was growing stranger. Even he, as the master, was completely befuddled.

The cyclones seemed to bring some kind of mysterious energy into the stars as they revolved. This strange energy was connected to the world, but it was an unclear feeling.

Long Chen studied them for a long time but didn’t receive any answers. Hence, he simply gave up on finding out anything more about this change. He looked around at the rest of his body, which had been tempered by the lightning and was even stronger.

He struck his own chest, and it shook the room. It was like the collision of two Treasure items.

“The true dragon essence blood had fully merged with my body thanks to the tribulation. This body of mine probably isn’t much inferior to an actual true dragon!”

Sensing the surging power within him, Long Chen felt a wave of emotion. He liked this feeling of explosive power.

After that, he checked the primal chaos space. All the Wood Foundation Divine Trees and the precious medicinal herbs were withered. He had sucked up all their energy during the tribulation, and it would take another ocean of corpses to revive them. He wasn’t able to get so many in a short time, so he would take this slowly.

At this time, Qin Feng, Bai Xiaole, Mu Qingyun, Luo Bing, Luo Ning, Zhong Ling, Zhong Xiu, and the others came in. They had all advanced to the Four Peak realm, and their realms were very steady. Some of them had even reached the fourth Heavenstage.

Seeing that Long Chen was awake and fine, they were jubilant. Most of them hadn’t seen his tribulation, but the rumors spreading had reached them. His tribulation had killed so many experts and destroyed the Bloodkill Hall’s presence in this domain. Even Enpuda’s divine statue was broken. That was enough to tell them just how terrifying his tribulation was.

When Long Chen returned, he was already on his last breaths, his body on the verge of collapse. It was truly frightening.

Just now, Bai Xiaole’s mother spread the word that Long Chen had woken up, so they all came running in to see him.

Long Chen saw everyone here except Li Cai. Startled, he had a bad feeling.

“Did Li Cai… not pass the trial?”

As soon as Long Chen asked this, everyone’s smile vanished. An expression of grief and hatred appeared on their faces.

Qin Feng was the one who took a deep breath and did his best to calmly say, “Boss, we didn’t tell you about this matter. Li Cai passed the trial, but… just before you came out of seclusion, the Bloodkill Hall launched another sneak attack, and he was killed by them. We didn’t inform you of this matter in order to not disturb you at that time.”

Long Chen fell silent. He recalled that just before he came out of seclusion, the Bloodkill Hall had organized another attack. That time, they charged into the inner academy and managed to kill some disciples before being slaughtered.

He hadn’t thought that Li Cai would be amongst those that were killed. Just as Li Cai came out of the trial, he was killed by the Bloodkill Hall.

Li Cai had been willing to risk his life to join the Dragonblood Legion. He had stepped into an incredibly difficult trial and passed, only to be killed.

“Boss, don’t feel bad. You destroyed the Bloodkill Hall and killed so many of their experts. He can rest in peace,” said Qin Feng.

Long Chen sighed and shook his head. “In the future, our Dragonblood Legion will no longer recruit anyone. Remember this.”

“Boss…” Qin Feng was startled.

“Listen to me. This matter is cursed,” said Long Chen.

Qin Feng was shocked. He pondered over his words and seemed to understand. Was this due to karma? If Li Cai hadn’t wanted to join the Dragonblood Legion, he wouldn’t have died?

On the Martial Heaven Continent, he had said that he was an inauspicious person. Wherever he went, mountains of corpses and seas of blood followed. Those whose lives weren’t tough enough would die sooner rather than later if they followed him.

Now that he thought about it, did Li Cai encounter this calamity because of this? His life wasn’t tough enough, so it resulted in this when he tried to join? Long Chen had previously rejected Li Cai, but seeing his tough character and loyalty, even Qin Feng vouched for him. Unexpectedly, it only harmed him, so Qin Feng felt remorse.

“Let’s go. Take a trip with me.” Long Chen patted Qin Feng’s shoulder comfortingly. He knew what his brother was thinking.

“Go where?”

“We’re going to the Bloodkill Hall. There’s still one more matter for me to do,” said Long Chen. He left the High Firmament Academy with all of them.
