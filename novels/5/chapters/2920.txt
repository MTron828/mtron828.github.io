Chapter 2909 Mu Qingyun Admits Defeat?

Following Tang Yaochen’s hand seals, runes lit up throughout the battlefield, and space began to twist.

“Tang Yaochen wants to send Long Chen back to the start again!”

“He just got back! If he’s sent back out, everything will be long over by the time he returns.”

“Chu Kuang wants to anger Long Chen to death. He wants him to powerlessly watch as Mu Qingyun and the others are humiliated and killed.”

The disciples outside felt profound powerlessness when they saw these spatial runes. Chu Kuang was incredibly sinister. His schemes came one after another, leading people to despair.

Seeing Long Chen be enveloped by those runes, people sighed. Despite Long Chen’s power, Chu Kuang still had him in the palm of his hand. Chu Kuang had power, wealth, and powerful background. How were other people supposed to fight him?

Just as everyone thought that Long Chen was about to be transported out again, a divine ring appeared behind him.

BOOM!

Those runes wrapping around Long Chen were instantly blown apart by a seven-colored divine ring. Their fragments blew through the air, revealing Long Chen within.

“What?!”

“The transportation formation was broken?”

“Heavens, what cultivation technique is that rainbow ring?!”

The rainbow divine ring behind Long Chen raged, unleashing explosive power that shook the land and sky.

“Brother San!” Mu Qingyun cried out. Now, this girl that had faced death without fear choked up.

“Good job. You’ve won face for your brother San. You should feel proud. The fighting of the martial path is no game, and the rules given are only obeyed by fools. The strong are always above the rules. Don’t complain as every person can be above the rules, including you. It just means that the current you is still not strong enough,” comforted Long Chen.

The Unfettered Alliance’s disciples drew back. As for the Prime Glory Alliance, they retreated back to their own camp. Both sides stared at each other.

“Boss San… I… sorry. I’ve made you lose face.” Li Cai was helped up by others. His body felt like it was falling apart, but he forced himself to meet Long Chen directly. He was filled with shame.

Before the battle started, they were filled with confidence, to the point of thinking about how to oppress Chu Kuang and the others. Now, they had only verified why Long Chen had called them naive.

They were truly naive. They were practically unable to bear a single blow from Chu Kuang’s powerful lineup. Thinking of how overconfident they had been, they had an urge to slam their heads into the ground and kill themselves. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

“You did well. At the important moment, you were all real men. I am proud of all of you.” Long Chen gave Li Cai a medicinal pill. It couldn’t instantly heal him, but it would at least take away some of the pain.

“Brother San, we have to admit defeat. I don’t want more of my brothers and sisters to sacrifice their lives for nothing,” said Mu Qingyun bitterly. She looked at the corpses on the ground and wept.

The people she had laughed and joked with were now lying on the ground. They would never get up again. Hence, her heart was breaking.

She didn’t want to see more of them die. The other side was too strong, and they didn’t have a single chance. Most of all, she didn’t want Long Chen to jump into a death trap.

Chu Kuang had clearly laid down a trap for Long Chen. If he jumped in, he would definitely die.

In the face of death, Mu Qingyun’s wits grew sharper. She could already tell that Chu Kuang’s ultimate goal was actually Long Chen. He was insulting and tormenting them just to provoke Long Chen, making him charge forward recklessly instead of admitting defeat. That way, he could freely kill Long Chen.

“No! We won’t admit defeat!”

“I’d rather die here than lower my head to these pieces of trash.”

“I’ll kill them. I’ve already gotten two, so I’ve profited. I can drag down a few more with me.”

“Plants live one lifetime. Humans live one lifetime. Boss San has said that cultivation is to live with dignity. If we can’t even have our dignity, what’s the point of living? We already risked our lives today, and we’ll continue to use our lives as evidence of our Unfettered Alliance’s hot blood and unbending dignity.”

The Unfettered Alliance’s disciples instantly cried out when Mu Qingyun suggested that they gave up. The Prime Glory Alliance had gone too far, and someone had to make them pay a price. Hence, these disciples would rather die here than unwillingly live the rest of their lives, drifting meaninglessly.

Over seventy members of the Unfettered Alliance were lying on the ground, dead. Hence, the others no longer felt fear; they only felt hatred. They had to kill.

“Hahaha, a group of ants also dares to be arrogant? Then come. If you have guts, don’t kneel and beg for mercy in a bit,” sneered the opposing experts of the Prime Glory Alliance.

Over twice the number of people had died from the Prime Glory Alliance. Also, some of them had shouted that they admitted defeat during a moment of danger and were transported out.

Other than the hundred people inside the barrier lighting the lamps, Chu Kuang’s side had less than a hundred people left.

However, these hundred were the true experts of the group, and they weren’t afraid of the Unfettered Alliance’s disciples at all. These experts were just waiting for Long Chen and the others to send themselves to their deaths, so they intentionally provoked them.

“Brother San…” Mu Qingyun looked at Long Chen, too emotional to know what to do.

Long Chen patted her shoulder softly. “Leave it to me. Just protect yourselves. Some enmities can only be repaid with blood. There is no other path.”

Long Chen then left Mu Qingyun in the care of another female disciple. He walked forward, and the rest of the Unfettered Alliance’s disciples immediately followed, clenching their weapons tightly. They were like a pack of wolves. As long as Long Chen said the word, they would charge.

The craziness of these disciples was one part thanks to Long Chen’s teachings, while the other part was thanks to Chu Kuang. He had repeatedly insulted them, and Devil Eye Yang Fang had even tried to insult Mu Qingyun, the goddess of their hearts. Because of this, they no longer cared about their lives if they could get their vengeance.

“I didn’t expect you to have some skill. You didn’t fall for it,” sneered Tang Yaochen from the rear.

According to the original plan, Long Chen should have been sent out again and had to witness the Unfettered Alliance be wiped out. That would drive him crazy.

That was the mission that Chu Kuang had given Tang Yaochen, but unexpectedly, Long Chen had broken free of the bindings of his formation, so he was rather incensed.

“No one can use the same move in front of me twice,” said Long Chen coldly.

“It’s Long Chen, right? You’re very arrogant. I heard that your power is extremely strong. Try and receive a single attack from me!”

Seeing Long Chen draw everyone’s attention like a ruler, Yuan Xinghui was extremely displeased. He didn’t have the patience for Tang Yaochen to waste words with Long Chen, and he directly smashed his rod at Long Chen.
