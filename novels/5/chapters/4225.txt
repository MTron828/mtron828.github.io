Chapter 4214 Will You Kill Him Or Will I?

“Die!”

Xu Yifeng suddenly shot into motion. His violet sea ignited, and an enormous claw reached out of his manifestation.

BOOM!

As the claw fell, it smashed into where Long Chen had been, creating a giant pit. Due to the impact, a wave rose out of the land like a meteorite falling into a lake, and countless bricks went flying in every direction.

When these bricks struck the barrier, they exploded, causing tiny ripples to appear in the barrier.

As for the experts on the martial stage, they cried out and blocked the bricks flying at them. After all, the bricks were tougher than World Domain divine items, and for the majority of people, they could be fatal.

Unfortunately, countless experts were unable to dodge the bricks and had to face them directly. As a result, some were blown apart by these bricks.

The weaker experts behind the Dragonblood Legion cried out, but the next moment, the earth in front of them rose, being conjured into a giant wall of earth.

The wall shuddered upon the impact of those flying bricks, but it still perfectly blocked all of them.

After that, it merged back into the earth as if it had never appeared. Those people that Long Chen had saved were shocked. They didn’t even know who had done this.

On the other hand, the Dragonblood warriors were excited. They naturally knew that it was Li Qi and Song Mingyuan’s work. However, neither of them had moved a single finger, yet they still effortlessly blocked this attack.

After they all were separated, the two of them dedicated themselves tirelessly to their cultivation, not daring to slack off in the slightest because they knew that their boss had to be working even harder. Now that the four captains were gathered, Li Qi and Song Mingyuan were able to shock everyone with a casual move. As fellow Dragonblood warriors, they were incredibly proud.

Compared to the Dragonblood Legion’s side, the others were not so fortunate. Although this was nothing to peak experts, not everyone was so powerful.

Furthermore, not everyone was like the Dragonblood Legion and looking out for others. The human race was closest to the battlefield, and after that wave of flying bricks, at least thousands of unlucky souls died.

However, the lives of the weak were viewed as highly as blades of grass; no one paid them any attention. Everyone’s eyes were on the battlefield.

They stared at where Long Chen had been, looking at the giant hole and an enormous claw embedded into it.

“Did he die?”

No one could see where he was. Xu Yifeng’s attack had truly been fast and without warning. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

“No, he’s not dead. Look up!”

Following that person’s gaze, they saw Long Chen in the sky, his starry sea shining in his divine ring. With his Kunpeng wings lightly flapped, he looked like a divine warrior of the starry sky, overlooking all others. That appearance was indescribably domineering and aloof.

“What speed! He is even capable of dodging such an attack.”

From high above, Long Chen coldly looked down at Xu Yifeng. “Your Xu family really is a pack of fools. Just how noble is the Violet Blood race? But you actually chose to stain your blood. Unable to awaken its power on your own, you actually resorted to absorbing the devil qi. However, violet blood rejects devil qi, causing it to ignite. Although it unleashes great power, you are destroying the core of the violet blood, causing its purity to plummet. It’s like putting the cart in front of the horse, drinking poison to quench your thirst. For a temporary gain, you’ve lost the true treasure. Most importantly, this action is no different than tarnishing the glory of your ancestors. You have already betrayed the Violet Blood race.”

“Bullshit!” Xu Yifeng roared, causing the earth to explode as he withdrew his claw from the martial stage. "What gives you the audacity to criticize my Violet Blood race?"

“He really does have the qualifications, this I guarantee.”

Just then, a voice rang out from the human race’s side. It wasn’t loud, but it entered everyone’s ears clearly, both within the martial stage and outside. It was like it was the voice of heaven and earth, forming a resonance with the Heavenly Daos.

Countless people were shocked, including all the innate Heaven Venerates. This kind of resonance with the Heavenly Daos was something only Eternal experts could accomplish.

Only when one could control the power of the ten thousand Daos, grasp the secrets of eternal life, and possess longevity as long as the heavens, could they cause heaven and earth to resonate with their voice.

However, upon hearing this voice, Long Chen’s face didn’t even twitch. Without looking back, he already knew who the speaker was.

On the other hand, Xu Yifeng was shocked and enraged by it. He then looked toward the crowd to see an icily arrogant man looking at him disdainfully.

“Heavenly Divinity race, Long clan?”

When Xu Yifeng saw the marks on this person’s robes, he narrowed his eyes.

“What? Does your Long clan wish to fight my Xu family?”

Everyone’s focus transferred from Long Chen and Xu Yifeng to that man. When Guo Ran and the others saw him, they couldn’t help but let out startled cries.

“Long Aotian!”

That person was precisely Long Aotian.

Today’s Long Aotian was wearing robes with a golden dragon mark on his sleeves and collar. That was the mark of the Eternal clan, a member of the Heavenly Divinity race, the Long clan.

Hundreds of thousands of Long clan disciples stood with Long Aotian, each emanating remarkable auras. Among them were several individuals whose mere gaze sent shivers down one's spine; they were true experts among experts.

Long Aotian sneered at Xu Yifeng, “Your Xu family is a pack of idiots. Can your people even be compared to my Long clan? Are you trying to gild your own face?”

“You…!” Xu Yifeng was enraged. Their Xu family had no enmity with the Long clan, and he didn’t even know Long Aotian. Thus, Long Aotian must be harboring ill intentions by targeting him at this moment.

The Xu family’s disciples were seething with anger as well, including the ones outside the barrier. The Long clan was suddenly targeting them? Just what were they trying to do?

“Ah, don’t misunderstand. Your Xu family has been crippled, and your violet blood has been ruined. Don’t even think of coming into contact with higher level divine abilities of the Violet Blood race in this lifetime.”

After saying that, Long Aotian turned to Long Chen. “So? I’ve been waiting a long time. Rather than wasting so much time, why don’t you directly kill this idiot? Let us resolve our enmities. If you feel like killing him would take too much effort and you would be at a disadvantage against me then, that’s fine too. I can help you kill him.”

Countless people stared at Long Aotian in shock. Some couldn’t even believe their own ears.
