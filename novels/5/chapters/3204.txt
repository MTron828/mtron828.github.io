Chapter 3193 Accompanying to the End


Long Chen slaughtered the attacking lifeforms with his lightning blade. At this moment, the millions of lightning dragons were no longer holding back. They grew larger and began to devour the lightning lifeforms.
 
Those lifeforms didn’t have their own wills. All they wanted was to kill Long Chen. However, they didn’t know how to attack Lei Long because it was also a lightning spirit. They only struggled but didn’t fight back against Lei Long.
 
As a result, Lei Long had an immense advantage over them and crazily slaughtered them.
 
Countless lightning lifeforms kept on descending, but the lightning dragons were devouring them. By the time they got through, only a few managed to reach Long Chen, and he was able to kill them easily. Everything was under control. He even had the space to antagonize Enpuda.
 


When Enpuda’s divine statue opened its eyes, his god aura unfurled. His divine spirit had been summoned by the call of those Divine Lords, which allowed him to possess this statue.
 
“Long Chen, you are courting death!”
 
When Enpuda saw the destruction before him, he was shocked and enraged. The Bloodkill Hall’s elite troops had been wiped out, with only a few people persevering.
 
The most unendurable thing was that his divine statue had two splashes of urine on its head. This was an unbelievable humiliation to him.
 
As a result of his fury, his divine might was unleashed. The will of a World King raged, and it caused the heavenly tribulation to shudder. As a result, an even stronger and more terrifying heavenly pressure crashed down.
 
All those Primal Divine Lords coughed up blood, cracks covering their entire bodies. It was the same for Qin Feng.

 
This sudden heavenly might had nothing to do with the lightning. It was something that directly targeted the will, so Qin Feng felt like he might collapse at any moment.
 
Even Enpuda’s statue became covered in countless cracks. The might of the heavens would not allow anyone to provoke it, not even a World King.
 
“You’re the one courting death. I told you not to provoke me, but it seems that you didn’t hear me clearly. You want to play this game with me? Don’t think that you have the advantage because you have lived for countless years. When it comes to these kinds of tricks, Boss Long San is the true ancestor. If you want to play, I’ll accompany you to the end. You think you’re a badass? Just try to be badass this time too. Do you still want your divine inheritance? Do you still care about these chess pieces?” sneered Long Chen fearlessly.
 
Everything happening right now seemed to be within Long Chen’s expectations. The academy’s experts sighed in the distance. When this fellow wanted to, he could calculate things perfectly.
 
“Enpuda is caught now. If he dares to use his divine energy, it will be considered going against the heavenly tribulation. The wrath of the heavens will not only kill those Primal Divine Lords, but it will also destroy his divine spirit and statue. That will wipe out all the accumulated karmic luck he has built up for tens of thousands of years in the Heavenly Swell Domain. Furthermore, most terrifying of all, attempting to kill Long Chen in his tribulation would be considered a disruption of the tribulation. The karma will definitely be recorded by the tribulation. Unless he isn’t planning on undergoing another tribulation again in this lifetime, the karma will be settled the next time he advances. It will very likely take his life. This young fellow is truly skilled,” praised an institute head.
 
Toward the end, he didn’t mention Long Chen’s name specifically to avoid karma. However, everyone knew that he was talking about him.
 
Enpuda was a World King, a large figure even when counting the Immortal World as a whole. However, he had been bullied by a junior like Long Chen to the point that he didn’t even dare to retaliate.
 
If the positions were switched and they were the ones in Enpuda’s position, they also wouldn’t dare to do anything. After all, there was a danger of losingRE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com
