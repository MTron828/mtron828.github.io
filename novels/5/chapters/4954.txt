At this moment, Fang Liude’s expression changed, and he hastily commanded the demonic bird to dodge.

The battle chariot whistled right over their heads. If they had been the slightest bit slower, they would have been struck.

Everyone was startled and enraged, but they were also powerless. On the other hand, Long Chen remained unfazed. If they had been hit, he’d have blasted the chariot apart with his fist.T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

“The Long clan’s disciples really are hateful. They clearly saw us but still charged over to embarrass us,” raged Yu Ying.

“There’s nothing we can do. They’re skilled at reincarnating somewhere good, while we weren’t. People can curse the Long clan’s disciples for being arrogant, but in the end, their hatred isn’t toward their arrogance. They hate themselves for not being born as disciples of the Long clan,” sighed Fang Liude.

Arrogance wasn’t inherently hateful. People just hated someone who could act more arrogant than them. If they had the chance, they would also want to act that arrogant.

“Don’t be angry. Pitiful people have hateful parts, and the opposite is also true. Hateful people also have pitiful parts,” said Long Chen with a smile.

“What are you talking about?” asked the archer who had gotten close to Long Chen. He scratched his head, not comprehending.

For a moment, Long Chen didn’t know how to explain it. He wanted to say that while the arrogant pricks looked wildly arrogant, the truth was that they were also bullied by others.

There was always someone stronger than them, so they had nowhere to vent their feelings other than on those weaker than them.

However, if Long Chen explained it like that, it would definitely be hurtful. After all, these mercenaries were close to the bottom of the food chain and would always be bullied.

In the end, Long Chen forced himself to explain differently. “I meant the strong always face people stronger than them, and evil people are also dealt with by more evil people. In this case, those pricks will encounter more arrogant people, and sooner or later, they’ll kick a tough nail. If their luck is bad, they’ll be forced to reincarnate, and I don’t believe they’ll be lucky enough to reincarnate somewhere so good again.”

This explanation made them all laugh. Normally, these mercenaries didn’t talk so much, either completing missions or cultivating. It was their first time meeting someone so humorous. Long Chen’s very existence improved their mood.

“It’s a good thing they’re not going in our direction. Otherwise, I’d just give up on this mission. In any case, our luck isn’t that bad this time,” said Fang Liude.

“Long Chen, can I ask you a few questions? If you don’t want to answer, feel free not to,” remarked Yu Ying. She had wanted to speak several times before this but had stopped herself every time.

Long Chen saw Brother Song tighten his hold on Yu Ying’s hand and smiled. This Brother Song was quite interesting. It seemed that he knew what Yu Ying wanted to ask. He wanted to stop her but couldn’t.

“It’s fine. Go ahead and ask.”

“Are you a disciple of a noble clan?”

The others’ ears perked up as they also wanted to know this. Someone like Long Chen couldn’t possibly have an ordinary background, but it wasn’t their place to ask. Since Yu Ying couldn’t hold back though, they all listened intently.

“I suppose so. What about it though? I’ve never obtained anything good from my so-called noble clan.” Long Chen spoke frankly. The Heavenly Desolation Long clan definitely could count as a noble clan. After all, their inheritance stretched back far into ancient eras.

“Were you forced out by them? Did you run away? Or do you want to go through trials to prove yourself?” asked Yu Ying.

In their eyes, someone born in superior conditions wouldn’t muddle with people like them unless they were forced out, never received any recognition, or wanted to prove themselves.

After all, sanctimonious elders often scolded their disciples, saying, “With your conduct, you wouldn’t survive three days outside.” Those words were hurtful and spurred countless individuals to prove themselves. As a result, many ran away to seek adventure, and in truth, many didn’t even last a day.

When Yu Ying saw Long Chen, she perceived him as a pitiful young master driven away from his home. It was only here that he saw the cruelty of the world and felt powerless. Well, people said first impressions were the strongest.

Long Chen shook his head. “It’s none of those. I—”

Just then, there was a loud explosive sound, and the void shuddered. They then saw a giant divine bird flying over.

Although it was far from them, its terrifying pressure still crashed down upon them. Their own demonic bird was so terrified that it dove into the forest.

Fang Liude tried to control it several times and was barely able to calm it down enough. With everyone jumping in fright, they completely forgot about Long Chen’s response.

“We’re not far from our target. Let’s keep ourselves hidden on foot!” instructed Fang Liude.

Everyone nodded. For them, that divine bird was very terrifying. Fortunately, they were far away from it. If they were closer, they would be doomed.

Long Chen didn’t really care about a single Heaven Saint bird, but it was a terrifying existence to Fang Liude and the others. They didn’t dare to face a Heaven Saint divine bird directly.

After continuing onward for a bit, they quickly heard the sound of the tide. After walking a bit further, they arrived at the top of a tall mountain. From there, Long Chen saw an endless sea with water as black as ink.

The Devil Sea. The Fiend Sea. Long Chen had encountered it many times, but every time he saw that ink-like water, he felt a chilling sensation, as if a pair of eyes were silently watching him from its depths.

He suddenly recalled an instance when, during an advancement, a trace of his essence blood was absorbed by the Fiend Sea. At the time, he had been about to resist, but the dragon expert had stopped him, instructing him to let the Fiend Sea absorb his blood and be stained by his karma. Even now, Long Chen didn’t understand why.

This Devil Sea was different from the ones Long Chen had previously encountered. The Devil Seas he had seen before were calm, with almost no ripples or waves, resembling pools of dead water.

However, here, the Devil Sea was unleashing ferocious waves that crashed against the rocks, sending black seawater spraying through the air. A disgusting stench hung in the air.

As soon as they arrived here, Long Chen noticed several medicinal ingredients in the area. However, Fang Liude and the others didn’t even look at them. It seemed that these ingredients were not worth anything here, but these ingredients were rather precious outside the Sovereign Emperor Heaven. In any case, Long Chen already had them in the primal chaos space, so he didn’t bother with them.

However, their existence invigorated him. It seemed that there really were countless medicinal ingredients here ripe for the picking. Coming here had been the right choice.

Everyone paused momentarily to rest. After a brief respite, they headed towards a depression in the ground. As they approached, a low roar shook their ears.
