Chapter 4368 Eternal Battle

BOOM!

The Seven Peak Sword slashed through the air, and the devil race’s Eternal expert raised a devil blade. When these two divine weapons clashed, Long Chen’s Seven Peak Sword exploded.Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

The Seven Peak Sword, in essence, was Long Chen’s bloodline divine ability. Although it was normally able to block Eternal divine weapons, it couldn’t beat them after the true potential of these weapons manifested in the hands of Eternal experts. In the end, Long Chen’s Seven Peak Sword fell short of a true Eternal divine weapon.

However, when the Seven Peak sword exploded, the devil Eternal expert was also forced back, his arm going numb.

When the Seven Peak Sword in Long Chen’s right hand exploded, a seven-color spear appeared in his left hand, and Long Chen stabbed it at the Eternal expert.

“What?!”

That Eternal expert was taken aback. He hadn’t expected Long Chen to not need any adjustment period after unleashing such a powerful blow. In other words, he was capable of unleashing powerful attacks like this without accumulating any energy.

What the Eternal expert didn’t know was that Long Chen’s current physical body had been strengthened to the point where even Long Chen didn’t know how strong it was.

Previously, the dissonance between his power and body had forced Long Chen to meticulously calculate the strain on his body with every attack. However, he was now entirely capable of using his power. What were considered big moves before could now be freely unleashed without hesitation.

The Eternal expert's hurried attempt to block led to the spear penetrating his chest, creating a sizable hole in his body.

At this time, a giant claw slammed down at Long Chen. Another Eternal expert emerged, and even before the attack landed, the Heavenly Daos themselves already started to crumble. This was the full force of an Eternal expert.

“Split the Heavens 1!”

Seeing this scene, Long Chen knew that he couldn’t continue pursuing that devil expert. The Seven Peak Sword once more condensed in his hand, and he swung it at the giant claw.

BOOM!

Long Chen’s Seven Peak Sword exploded, knocking away the enormous claw. Blood then sprayed out of it. This claw that was comparable to an Eternal divine weapon was injured.

Having repelled the claw, Long Chen was about to hunt down the injured devil expert when he found that the latter was already running.

“You think that you can run? You’re overthinking things.”

Guo Ran raised a crossbow that was even bigger than he was. Following that, Long Chen barely saw a streak of light before that devil expert’s head suddenly exploded.

“Boss has said that the Great Desolate World will be flipped on its head today. Where do you think you’re going to run today?” sneered Guo Ran, his voice ringing throughout the entire battlefield.

That metallic voice contained no emotion, terrorizing everyone around. The fact that Guo Ran had just killed an Eternal expert in one blow was even more terrifying.

It had to be said that Guo Ran was skilled in grasping the right timing. Gravely wounded by Long Chen, the Eternal expert experienced a drastic decline in his spiritual perception. Completely absorbed in his escape, he became an easy target for Guo Ran, who seized the right moment to eliminate him.

However, outsiders didn’t comprehend that. Seeing Guo Ran kill an Eternal expert in one blow, they placed him in the same power rank as Long Chen. At the very least, the Great Desolate World’s experts felt that this was Guo Ran’s true power.

“Kill!”

Long Chen’s Kunpeng wings quivered as he shot into the air. The Seven Peak Spear tore through the clouds, and a scream echoed from above as blood cascaded down. Soon after, a devil bird’s figure materialized.

The Eternal expert who had earlier assaulted Long Chen was now impaled by the spear, his divine feathers scattering in a frenzied whirlwind. Eternal blood rained upon the world, and Long Chen charged straight to the source of the Eternal blood.

“Kill them!” The Eternal experts from the Great Desolate World roared in fury. Their rage was genuine. Millions of years back, the human race had been formidable, yet these creatures had ultimately vanquished them.

Now, after millions of years, a group of brats from the human race actually dared to come to their world, proclaiming their desire to annihilate them. It was an absolute insult for them.

More and more Eternal experts came charging in, flocking around Long Chen. They clearly understood the principle of taking down the king first. As long as they killed Long Chen, the human race’s morale would plummet to rock bottom.

Long Chen was wielding the Seven Peak Spear in his left hand and the Seven Peak Sword in his right. Surrounded by Eternal experts, there was nowhere for him to go.

While Long Chen was confident in himself, if he was surrounded by hundreds of Eternal experts, he would still meet his end. However, he was still fearless. From the mortal world to the immortal world, the thing he feared the least was a group battle. These Eternal experts might be powerful, but they had no skill in working together. Also, their combat experience was extremely average.

Long Chen was incredibly fast as he avoided the attack of a devil expert, causing it to strike another expert’s attack. With their attacks clashing, both of them received a backlash from the other’s power. In an instant, Long Chen’s Seven Peak Sword and Seven Peak Sword left his hands, piercing their bodies.

“Explode!”

Following that, Long Chen’s divine weapons exploded in their bodies, causing two Eternal experts to instantly hack up blood, half of their bodies gone. Although they didn’t immediately die, they were severely wounded.

Long Chen spread his hands, and the Seven Peak Spear and Seven Peak Sword appeared once more. His divine ability allowed him to summon weapons comparable to Eternal divine weapons limitlessly, as long as his seven-color Supreme Blood did not run out.

Even when surrounded by so many Eternal experts, Long Chen fought crazily. Occasionally, he would severely wound an Eternal expert.

However, there were so many of them that anyone injured would be instantly replaced, leaving no gap to exploit. In the midst of this relentless assault, a beam of Sword Qi cut through the void. Unable to evade in time, an Eternal expert was pierced through the head. He stiffened before plummeting to the ground.

“It’s that sword cultivator! Kill him together!”

“Sword cultivators have weak defenses! As long as we reach him, he’ll definitely die!” shouted an expert of the Great Desolate World.

The power of sword cultivators was known to all, but their weakness was obvious as well. Yue Zifeng possessed unparalleled killing prowess, but if any attacks managed to reach him—even a seemingly ordinary strike—it could prove fatal.

With Yue Zifeng’s appearance, a small portion of the experts surrounding Long Chen went to deal with him. They didn’t want to give Yue Zifeng any chance to show off.

“Heaven Earth Spirit!”

Just as those Eternal experts were about to reach Yue Zifeng, the entire Great Desolate World quivered. After that, the earth rose, and two giant earthen giants blocked their path.

Li Qi and Song Mingyuan stood on the top of the giants’ heads. When they formed hand seals, the earth giants mirrored them. After that, two enormous hands slammed onto the ground.

An enormous earthen wall rose out of the ground, adorned with countless flowing runes reminiscent of metal attributes. It was like an iron wall.

The appearance of this wall caught the charging experts off guard. Unable to halt their momentum, they collided with the wall, abruptly halting their advance toward Yue Zifeng.

They blasted through this thick wall, yet they did so rather wretchedly. Quite a few of them were bleeding, as the wall that Li Qi and Song Mingyuan had summoned was exceptionally hard. Even Eternal experts were momentarily dazed by the impact of charging through it.

“There’s such a good thing too? Kill!”

Upon seeing this, Guo Ran excitedly took out his giant crossbow again and shot a torrent of arrows.
