Chapter 2378 No Choice But to Save Them

Translator: BornToBe

The warriors of the eighth legion quickly set up their constructions. Once it was complete, the underground formation would turn their camp into a powerful stronghold once more.

They were well prepared, quickly setting up everything. One giant building after another was built.

As they did that, the demonic beasts on the battlefield didn’t even look at them. They were still busy assaulting Ye Lingfeng and the others in a crazy assault.

“Is this the effect of the bewitching medicine?” Shen Chengfeng suddenly came to a realization.

“Yes, it definitely is. After all, they aren’t humans, so it’s easy to stimulate their desires. They’re so crazy that they’re even killing some of their comrades. Do the divine families not know this?” asked Long Chen.

Shen Chengfeng shook his head. “Perhaps the senior generation might know more about it, but I never knew. Even if I did, it wouldn’t matter. Wouldn’t using that medicine against them just be conning myself?”

“That’s not entirely true. In this berserk state, they’ll follow you wherever you lead them. As long as you have a trap set up, the demonic beasts will come charging in. It can greatly increase your efficiency. You get to decide how to best use the tools at your disposal,” said Long Chen.

“Reporting, the formation platforms have been built! Are the defenses to be set up?” reported one warrior.

The thirty-six formation platforms were the connections to the underground formation. It could summon a powerful barrier that would prove that they had taken back their camp.

Shen Chengfeng was about to give the order to activate it when he looked toward Long Chen. “Brother Long, are we activating it?”

Long Chen shook his head. “Not yet. Activating the formation first will make it more time consuming to set up the other formation platforms. There’s no threat to us yet, so we should get the most out of it. Set up the offensive formation platforms. There are the arrow towers and such that need to be set up. Just have the necessary people standing by to activate the defensive formation at a moment’s notice.”

Shen Chengfeng nodded and had that warrior follow those instructions. In just these few days, he had learned many things from Long Chen.

“Long Chen, Shen Chengfeng, neither one of you will have a good death!”

Suddenly, a hoarse and hysterical voice rang out from within the crazed roaring of the demonic beasts.

“It seems that he’s cursing us.” Long Chen shrugged.

“Reporting to the commander, a portion of the offensive platforms has also been set up.” Another warrior came running over.

Long Chen smiled. While the formation wasn’t active, it was very quick to set up the formation platforms.

“Activate it.”

The earth trembled and one platform after another lit up. A light blue curtain of light gradually condensed in the sky.

It started off frail-looking, as if it might tear with the slightest touch, but as the energy of the platforms entered it, it quickly strengthened. Following that, countless runes began to appear within it, strengthening it even further.

The grand formation had been summoned. Shen Chengfeng finally felt a weight fall off his shoulders. All the Heavenly Dragon warriors cheered.

“What are you shouting for? If you want to celebrate, then go all-out! Brothers, start the drums and gongs. Light the firecrackers and sing!” Long Chen waved his hand. Only at that moment did Shen Chengfeng understand why Long Chen had wanted those things.

A loud clamor began to ring out of the camp. It was like beating the drums and making noise was unburdening them of their resentment.

“Damn!” Long Chen felt his ears and soul shaking. These fellows really knew how to make noise. It was so bad that he himself was in pain.

However, the warriors were immersed in their delight and almost seemed to be competing with each other to see who could make the most noise. Some drums and gongs were broken in their excitement from a bad hit.

Even if they didn’t have an instrument, they would start banging their weapons together.

Shen Chengfeng shouted, “Is there a need for us to suffer like this?”

However, he couldn’t even hear himself.

“What did you say?” transmitted Long Chen.

Shen Chengfeng repeated himself through a spiritual transmission.

“Of course. Those fellows will definitely be feeling ten times worse than us.” Long Chen snickered.

“This really is tough to endure,” grumbled Shen Chengfeng.

“Well, we’re not professional musicians. As long as it makes them happy, even farting can become beautiful.”

As the eighth legion unleashed a clamor, Ye Lingfeng almost coughed up blood. Long Chen had used him to reclaim the eighth legion’s camp without spilling a drop of blood.

He saw that the formation had been set up. The clamor coming from their celebration wasn’t even drowned out by the roars of the demonic beasts. As a result, he really coughed up a mouthful of blood.

“Long Chen, if I don’t tear your corpse to pieces, I won’t be surnamed Ye!” roared Ye Lingfeng. His hatred for Long Chen had reached an indescribable level.

“Commander, the demonic beasts are attacking too fiercely. The energy of the Divine Dragon Tyrant Crossbow will only last for half an incense stick’s worth of time. Our reinforcements are still in our way… It doesn’t seem like they’ll make it…,” said the vice commander.

Although they had been a bit panicked at the beginning, they had calmed back down after the distress signal had been sent out and they received a reply.

The thing that had caught them off guard was how fierce these demonic beasts were. They were charging forward so recklessly that they were rapidly draining the third legion’s energy reserves. Even a Heaven Elder would be unable to endure such a terrifying assault.

“Commander, our only option is to beg Long Chen for help,” said that vice commander.

“You’re dreaming! I’d rather die!” roared Ye Lingfeng.

“Commander, as long as people are alive, they have a chance at vengeance,” replied the vice commander. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Ye Lingfeng ground his teeth. Seeing the endless army of demonic beasts as well as the runes of the Divine Dragon Tyrant Crossbow starting to fade, he smashed his fist against the ground.

“Long Chen, I have something to say to you!” shouted Ye Lingfeng, transmitting his voice far into the distance.

However, even after shouting three times, he didn’t receive a reply. This made him feel so angry that his face turned purple.

“They want us to die.” Ye Lingfeng’s teeth almost broke from how hard he was grinding them.

“No, they can’t. They clearly have the power to save us. If they refuse to help, that would go against the rules of the divine families. Shen Chengfeng and the others would be executed, with only the regular warriors getting off with stern punishment. They wouldn’t dare to do that. Long Chen is intentionally making noise to drown out our requests for aid. That way, he has an excuse to ignore us. We have to use a distress signal so that he has no excuse,” said the vice commander.

“Fine, release the distress signal.”

An arrow shot out toward the camp, but the distance between them was too great. It exploded midway, unleashing a dazzle of light.

Long Chen waved his hand to get the warriors to quieten down, but they seemed to be enraptured in their noise-making. Only when the people beside them kicked them did they stop.

When everyone stopped, Shen Chengfeng sighed with relief. He suddenly felt that having the world be quiet was an exceptionally wonderful thing. If this had continued, he probably would have vomited.

“Long Chen, we are surrounded by danger. Do you dare to just watch without helping?!” roared Ye Lingfeng.

“This is how he begs for help?” Long Chen’s expression became odd.

“These are the rules of the divine families. If you have the power to help but just watch, the leaders will be executed, while the others will be expelled. Even if Ye Lingfeng remains this arrogant, we have no choice,” said Shen Chengfeng.

“What about when they were conning you? Since they dared to do that, it meant that they were confident in escaping from the consequences. All rules have loopholes within them. Just listen to me and I guarantee that there won’t be any mishaps,” said Long Chen. He then shouted toward the battlefield. “Ye Lingfeng, are you begging me for help? It seems that your attitude doesn’t fit that.”

“Long Chen, don’t give me that crap! If we die, you’ll also meet a miserable fate!” roared Ye Lingfeng.

“Fine, you’ve won. We’ll save you right now. Brothers, fire your arrows!”

Long Chen waved his hand. A rain of arrows fell that made Ye Lingfeng tremble with rage.

“Long Chen, you go too far!”
