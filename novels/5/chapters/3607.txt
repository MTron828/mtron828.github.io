Chapter 3596

Gu Yi’s words shook everyone. The only one whose expression didn’t change was Xue Yifan. It was as if he already knew about it long ago.

“Bastard, you traitor! You’re the one who caused the death of my second brother! Die!”

A streak of light flew toward Gu Yi. It was a golden arrow unleashed with maximum speed, and it arrived in front of Gu Yi almost as soon as it was unleashed.

Fortunately, Guo Ran was prepared and swung his saber, shattering the arrow.

“Is he also one of the spies?” asked Guo Ran. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

“Yes!”

Gu Yi directly replied in the affirmative. Only when he answered the questions did the soul burning fire settle.

When this person's attack failed, he suddenly grabbed an elder and pointed his weapon at the elder’s head, shouting, “I’m innocent! This is clearly Gu Yi slandering others! Don’t force me!”

Despite saying that he was innocent, all his actions proved that he was a traitor.

The entire crowd tensed. Every person summoned their armor.

At this moment, Long Chen also put away his flame technique. He couldn’t be bothered to keep it up. Just looking at the dean’s current expression, he knew that the dean had known this long in advance, and that everything was within his control.

Just as the dean had previously said, he had laid the road for Guo Ran, just waiting for Guo Ran to erupt and walk down it. Guo Ran was supposed to be the hero saving the Alldevil Star-Field from calamity, but Long Chen’s arrival caused the plan to change. As expected, wise people had terrifying restraints.

Suddenly, the traitor that had captured an elder stiffened. His battle armor slowly fell from his body, and he found himself unable to move. “What… what is going on?!” he cried out in terror.

At this moment, the dean finally stood up. Looking at that person, he said, “Yu Qingquan, one hundred and ninety-seven years ago, you met a woman and were seduced by her beauty. You were willing to become her captive. Afterward, she revealed her origins, informing you that she was a descendant of the Luo clan, Luo Min, and that the Luo clan was going to do some heaven-shaking matter. At that time, you were afraid because you realized that she only approached you as a spy. However, you did not manage to resist her allure. After that, the Luo clan’s promises to you swayed your heart, and you became a pawn of the Luo clan within my Heavenly Dragon Divine Armor College. It was only three years after you became a pawn that you noticed that it wasn’t just you. Even within the assembly, there are three people bought by the Luo clan. Am I right?”

The man called Yu Qingquan was shocked. This was all top secret. Even he himself didn’t remember the exact timing, but Xue Yifan was not the slightest bit off.

“Yu Qingquan, how dare you?! I call you brother, but you betray us! Tell us, do you even have a conscience?!” roared a late stage World King.

Yu Qingquan seemed to instantly age for decades. He knelt on the ground and knew that it was over for him.

“Whoever is a spy, step forward yourselves. Don’t force me to name you one by one. Don’t hold onto wishful thinking and bluff your way out. I will only give you one chance. Whether or not you can grasp it is up to yourselves,” said Xue Yifan, looking over at everyone.

“Ah, fine, fine. Youngsters must be wary of fighting, middle-aged people must be wary of perversion, and old people must be wary of greed. As expected, the words of the ancients do not deceive me. I hoped to bring my family to glory, but instead I will go down in history for my infamy. Haha, I have let down my ancestors!”

An Assembly Elder suddenly laughed miserably. After that, he struck his own head, killing himself.

His corpse then fell to the ground. A light breeze blew, blowing up some dust and dirt, giving this world a mournful touch.

Quite a few people lowered their heads and stepped forward. Seeing those people, everyone was stunned. There were hundreds of them.

They had never dreamed that a glorious power like the Heavenly Dragon Divine Armor College would be infiltrated to such an extent.

Furthermore, these people all possessed certain power within the college. They were powerful figures in their own right. Only people like this had value to the Luo clan.

After an incense stick’s worth of time, there were three hundred and forty-seven people to step forward. Seeing so many spies amongst them, the Heavenly Dragon Divine Armor College’s experts felt a chill. Their hearts were cold, as were their backs.

Tu Hu, Xie Qianqian, and the others’ jaws dropped. They were unable to believe it. There were several elders amongst these people that they were familiar with. For them to admit to being spies now, these people felt like they were in a nightmare.

“No one else? I’ll give you another incense stick’s worth of time. This is your last chance.” Xue Yifan looked over everyone once more before indifferently closing his eyes.

After that, no one else stepped forward. Time passed bit by bit, and the millions and millions of experts didn’t make a sound. There was only the sound of nervous heartbeats and breathing.

“So the dean is actually so amazing that everything is within his control.” Guo Ran stood beside Long Chen with an admiring expression.

When that incense stick’s worth of time passed, Xue Yifan slowly opened his eyes and sighed. “Everyone’s fate is their own. I gave you your chance, but you didn’t cherish it. Don’t blame me then.”

Xue Yifan formed hand seals. Suddenly, terrified cries rang out within the crowd. The armor that certain people were wearing began to contract on their owners until they were crushed into head-sized clumps of metal.

“What?!”

This scene horrified people. Over ten battle armors had destroyed themselves? That was an alarming sight for them. It dumbfounded people.

Xue Yifan shook his head. “At such a time, instead of thinking of repentance, you were still hoping to muddle your way through. It is clear just how blinded by greed you are. There is no saving you. Every single one of you, every time you encounter the Luo clan, every time you do any exchange with them, I am aware of it. When people get old, they lose interest in most things, but gossip and talking are always interesting. Without keeping a grasp on that, I would be failing in my duty.”

Xue Yifan’s words fell in every single person’s ears. At this moment, no one dared to continue underestimating this ever-amicable dean who always seemed absent-minded. Only now did they realize what a terrifying existence he was.

“For the rest of you that have stepped forward, congratulations, you saved your lives. Take off their armor and hand them to the discipline hall.”

Dozens of people came forward, taking those people’s armor. What shocked people was that these people were all late stage World Kings, and no one else recognized them. Now, they felt that the dean was even more unfathomable.

“Starting today, dean Guo Ran has full authority within the Heavenly Dragon Divine Armor College. I formally announce that the Heavenly Dragon Divine Armor College is entering a state of war. Anyone who questions dean Guo Ran’s decisions will be punished to the harshest degree.”

After saying that, Xue Yifan turned and left, leaving behind countless experts staring in shock at Guo Ran. The heavens of the Heavenly Dragon Divine Armor College had just changed.
