Chapter 4665 A Chaotic Battle Begins

The void split apart, revealing a flying boat. It wasn’t flying directly forward, but instead, it suddenly vanished and reappeared. After a few flashes, it appeared in the core region.

The sudden appearance of the flying boat startled the surrounding experts, leaving them awestruck by its incredible speed. In the blink of an eye, it transitioned from a mere speck in the distance to hovering directly before them, leaving no time for them to react.

“Hahaha, we’re finally here! It seems that the real show hasn’t started yet... ugh!” Guo Ran jumped off the flying boat excitedly and then vomited.

The others also had unsightly expressions as they jumped off, and some were starting to vomit as well.

After Long Chen left them, the Dragonblood warriors immediately started consolidating their cultivation bases. Once they finished, their auras stopped leaking, a sign that they had adapted to their new power. After that, they immediately followed the markers Long Chen left behind.

In order to save time, Xia Chen used the most explosive method of movement of the flying boat, akin to traversing through time itself. It was as if time paused for a moment before propelling them forward with incredible speed. The experience was akin to consecutive teleportations mixed with flying. Despite its swiftness, the intense acceleration of this travel method left them feeling airsick.

In truth, this technique was one of Xia Chen’s life-saving methods for evading danger, and it came with a heavy burden that could crush those who misused it.

During their battle against the Celestial race, the chaotic circumstances prevented them from utilizing the flying boat. This time, Xia Chen had unleashed this move, but the burden it posed on everyone was even greater than he had expected. Nonetheless, its astonishing speed allowed them to complete a journey that took Long Chen several hours in a mere four hours.

“It’s the Dragonblood Legion! Those perverts are not dead yet!”

When Guo Ran and the others arrived, many experts immediately recognized them. These individuals had been involved in the assault on the Dragonblood Legion, so their hearts brimmed with rage and hatred.

“Shut your mouth, you’re the pervert! Your entire lineage is tainted with perversion!” Guo Ran spat out furiously, his words aimed at one of the accusers. The Celestial race had schemed against the Spirit race, yet now they sought to pin the blame on the Dragonblood Legion.

“Guo Ran, calm down. Just watch boss.” Xia Chen immediately grabbed Guo Ran, afraid of him launching an attack and ruining Long Chen’s plans.

“Attack together! We’ll wipe out these shameless perverts!”

While Xia Chen held Guo Ran back, experts of the various races flooded toward the Dragonblood Legion, seemingly intent on wiping them out.

What enraged the Dragonblood Legion was that many of these attackers had no enmity with them but still joined in on the assault.

“Brothers!” Just then, Long Chen’s voice rang out above the booming thunder. “Everything they say is just an excuse. They fear me, so they strike at you to divert my attention. Our Dragonblood Legion may not be saints, nor do we aspire to be. All we seek is to live with dignity. Should anyone seek to kill us, we make them pay a bloody price. We don’t bully others, but we refuse to be bullied. If they want to die so badly, don’t hold back! Teach them what respect is! Show them the true meaning of fear!”

Long Chen’s voice resonated like a divine decree, surpassing even the tumultuous tribulation, penetrating not only people’s ears but also their very souls. Within the ranks of the Dragonblood Legion, Long Chen’s voice set their blood ablaze with renewed fervor.

“Kill anyone who raises a weapon against you! Show this world the power of the number one legion!”

The Dragonblood Legion erupted, their blood boiling with such power that it felt like they would explode if they didn’t unleash it.

Guo Ran roared, “Brothers, it’s time to carve your name into history! The name of the Dragonblood Legion will resound throughout every corner of this world!”

“Kill!” The rallying cry thundered from the lips of the Dragonblood warriors. Facing enemies numbering in the tens of millions, they harbored no trace of fear, only an overwhelming surge of killing intent. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

These Dragonblood warriors had suffered day and night after ascending to the immortal world, all to one day gather again as the Dragonblood Legion and follow their boss in battle.

Now, they finally had that chance. Confronted by the heavenly geniuses of the various races who came from every direction, an emotion that they had suppressed in their hearts for a long time erupted.

“Dragon Blood Battle Armor!” the Dragonblood warriors roared in unison. Over seven thousand voices merged, along with the roaring of dragons, causing heaven and earth to shudder.

The Dragonblood warriors became enveloped in blood-colored scales, their auras transforming into something sacred and majestic. In this form, they were truly fit to be called Dragonblood warriors.

As enemies crashed down upon them from every direction, flesh and blood flew through the air. In an instant, countless experts were torn apart by the Dragonblood Legion.

Many weapons slashed onto the Dragonblood warriors but were unable to penetrate their scales. In fact, they could shatter these weapons with a single punch.

“What?!”

These experts were horrified to find that Long Chen’s subordinates were also able to block a Saint weapon barehanded.

Some Dragonblood warriors would simply grab someone else’s weapon if they took a liking to it. With weapons in their hands, they were like tigers with wings. One slash of their sword caused a mass of experts to fall.

“Heroes of the other races, don’t just watch. The Dragonblood Legion is overflowing with evil. All of them need to be eradicated from this world. Attack together and purify this world!” Luo Changsheng’s mesmerizing voice echoed once more, commanding the masses with his bewitching art.

In the distance, more experts were also rushing over, but they had to go around the tribulation to get to the Dragonblood Legion. The tribulation’s range was so huge that they were unable to go around in an instant, and they definitely didn’t have the guts to take a shortcut and barge straight through the tribulation.

“Careful, the Dragonblood Legion has a sword cultivator named Yue Zifeng! He calls himself the world’s number one sword cultivator, and although I beat him, he really is powerful! I wonder if anyone has the power to beat him and seize the title of the world’s number one sword cultivator for themselves?” shouted Luo Changsheng.

“Yue Zifeng, come out and fight if you have any guts!”

It went without saying that Luo Changsheng’s bewitching art was truly powerful. As soon as he said this, people started to challenge Yue Zifeng.

Yue Zifeng stood at the core of the Dragonblood Legion, his gaze apathetic. His sword was still sheathed, and he didn’t seem to have any intention of drawing it.

He just gazed at Luo Changsheng with indifference. When Luo Changsheng met his eyes, a tremor ran through him; Yue Zifeng was like a different person, immune to the effects of Luo Changsheng’s bewitching art.

Given their previous encounter, Yue Zifeng should have been plagued by inner turmoil, yet he was frighteningly calm. His mental realm wasn’t affected at all.

“If you manage to survive an encounter with our boss, I might consider a rematch,” Yue Zifeng remarked with a shake of his head, eliciting shock from the onlookers. “Though I doubt you'll even make it that far.”
