Chapter 4409 Who Let You Talk?

Pow!

Long Chen’s palm firmly slapped Netherdragon Tianye’s face. Although the latter was a peerless heavenly genius with immense combat experience, he had never encountered such a technique before.

Long Chen’s divine slap was as quick as lightning and had been refined to the point of reaching a level of natural perfection. Netherdragon Tianye couldn’t possibly react to such an almighty slap.

As long as an opposing expert was in range, this technique was almost impossible to dodge. It had nothing to do with cultivation base, talent, or combat experience.

Even Long Chen was unaware when he had honed this technique to its current level; it now boasted a one-hundred percent hit rate.

Because it lacked any killing intent, his opponents were unable to sense any danger from it and thus would not instinctively dodge. This move could be described as the cultivation world’s most shameless and scoundrel-like technique.

While its killing power was not high, its humiliating effect was extremely potent. It was super effective for the arrogant individuals born into noble backgrounds, or those who perceived themselves as superior to everyone else.

BOOM!

Netherdragon Tianye was sent flying by this slap, crashing through multiple mountains and creating a billowing cloud of dust. The onlookers, both allies and adversaries, were left in astonishment. Long Chen's act of slapping Netherdragon Tianye resembled an adult slapping a child.

“DIE!”

Netherdragon Tianye’s furious roar reverberated from within the cloud of dust, and the earth exploded with black qi. When a giant dragon claw came out of this black qi, an air of death filled this world. This claw resembled the hand of the grim reaper itself.

“Nether Dragon Ghost Claw!”

Previously, Netherdragon Tianye had just been testing Long Chen, wanting to humiliate Long Chen and make him die in despair.

However, that slap fully ignited his wrath, and he instantly unleashed one of his killer moves.

“Cloud Dragon Immolation Claw!” Long Chen also shouted, and the vibrant cry of a dragon resonated once again. A dragon claw then materialized, extending from his manifestation.

BOOM!

When the two dragon claws clashed, all sounds in heaven and earth were sucked away. Following the silence, a massive explosion reverberated, plunging the world into darkness. The earth then fractured, and cracks marred the sky in the aftermath of this world-shaking collision.

“Die!”

Within a torrent of astral winds, Netherdragon Tianye came flying out, delivering a punch toward Long Chen. He initiated the attack in front of Long Chen, but just as his fist was about to connect, he somehow appeared behind Long Chen.

BOOM!

Without looking back, Long Chen unleashed a fist behind him. In a burst of explosive exchange, he skillfully harnessed the counterforce to deliver a powerful kick.

BOOM!

The void twisted, collapsing in front of Long Chen’s kick. However, Netherdragon Tianye’s body was nothing more than an afterimage.

“You insolent trash! To dare defile the name of the great nether dragon race, I won’t end your life directly! I will make you suffer a life worse than death!” Netherdragon Tianye roared. Suddenly, millions of his afterimages appeared throughout heaven and earth, enclosing Long Chen in a daunting circle.

The two engaged in a fierce brawl, their fists colliding amid streaks of lightning cutting through the air. Their intense auras instilled fear even in Eternal experts. Long Chen’s fists danced as he fought Netherdragon Tianye head-on.

Their fight shook even heaven and earth. After a while, the Eternal experts were shocked that they were unable to harness much Heavenly Dao energy, as most of it was absorbed by the two of them.

Despite such an intense barrage of exchanges, neither combatant displayed any signs of weakening. The experts around had initially expected their stamina to falter within minutes given the intensity of the battle. However, after a while, their auras not only persisted but grew even more formidable. Their Blood Qi raged like vast seas.

Long Chen's gaze sharpened with each passing moment, and his battle will was burning strongly. Finally, he found a good opponent to train with.

Netherdragon Tianye was monstrous. This was Long Chen’s first time encountering someone against whom he could unleash the Dragon King Battle Armor at full power. Hence, he was brimming with joy. This bloody clash of pure power was something that he hadn’t experienced in many years. The ability to fight to his heart's content ignited a fervor within him, setting his heart ablaze. As the battle intensified, Long Chen's power soared to new heights, and the precision of his attacks reached unprecedented levels.

Experts required robust challenges to serve as whetstones for tempering. Furthermore, the whetstones of an expert had to possess sufficient strength; otherwise, there would be no meaningful tempering effect.

In this case, an expert who could pose a fatal threat to Long Chen was the best whetstone, just like Netherdragon Tianye provided Long Chen with the much-needed pressure. This intense pressure triggered a second awakening of his dragon blood, allowing his techniques to grow more proficient with each passing moment.

When it came to the Dragon Soul Body Forging Art, Long Chen could only navigate through the technique on his own. The mysterious dragon expert had only been able to impart the most fundamental aspects, leaving the rest for Long Chen to discern. According to the dragon expert, the more it taught, the less Long Chen would truly understand.

After all, true mastery required personal comprehension, and now, with an ideal practice partner, especially one from the dragon race like Netherdragon Tianye, Long Chen’s dragon blood was evolving.

At first, Long Chen was at a slight disadvantage under Netherdragon Tianye’s assault, and his techniques were unable to flow smoothly. But now, they were fighting equally.ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

Their battle was so intense that no one dared to approach them. Rubble simply flew about, carried by violent astral winds.

Netherdragon Tianye hadn’t expected Long Chen to be able to survive this assault, but he wasn’t intimidated. “I didn’t expect you to have some skill. But it’s still not enough. You will soon-”

Pow!

Just as he was sneering, Long Chen’s hand struck like lightning, slapping him in the face and interrupting him.

“Who let you talk?” sneered Long Chen.

This was a straightforward confrontation of sheer brute power. While Long Chen was slightly weaker on the surface, this didn’t signify that he didn’t have a chance to deal a serious blow to his opponent. Long Chen was only fighting this way to elevate the power of his dragon blood.

However, this fellow actually thought that he had taken control of the battle and figured out Long Chen’s full power. He was even willing to split his attention to mock Long Chen.

“You fucker!” Netherdragon Tianye’s anger, which had gradually settled down, flared up once more. His face twisted with fury, and he seemed to have gone insane.

BOOM!

His manifestation erupted, giving rise to a colossal dark nether dragon that bellowed with ferocity. Opening its maw, the creature unleashed a black sphere hurtling toward Long Chen.

“A dragon Neidan?!”

Long Chen jumped in shock. The dragon race had Neidans? How come he had never heard of such a thing? Weren't Neidans supposed to be exclusive to demonic beasts?

Long Chen instantly felt space solidify around him; he had been locked down. This dragon Neidan then shot toward Long Chen, who could only raise his arms in a desperate attempt to block. It was like a star colliding with him, causing flesh and blood to explode.

BOOM!

A bottomless hole was pierced into the ground, and Long Chen’s figure was gone.
