Chapter 4531 Desolate Beast Race

“The damn desolate beast race really knows how to pick the right timing! Mixed beast race, hear my orders! Give up the outer defense line and retreat to the inner ring! Shrink the battle lines and focus on defense!”

When Long Chen followed Feng You and the others out of the palace, they saw a chaotic scene all around them.

“What’s going on?” asked Long Chen.

“It’s another one of our enemies. The desolate beast race has launched an attack as well. They must know about our recent clash with the Heavenly Corrupt Sect and are seizing the opportunity, thinking we’re still recovering,” explained Feng You with irritation.

The void split apart in the distance, revealing two enormous figures that charged into the sky. Due to how fast they were, Long Chen couldn’t see their appearances clearly.

However, based on their auras, Long Chen knew that two Sage Kings were clashing, and one of them was the mixed beast race’s Sage King.

“Long Chen, I’m going to deal with the desolate beast race’s main force here. I might not have the power to protect you, so you can either stay here or participate in the battle. Just make sure that you’re safe,” said Feng You.

“I’ll be fine. Just do what you have to do. I’ll watch from over here,” answered Long Chen.

Feng You nodded. With a fierce shout, she dashed forward, displaying a pair of blood-red fiery wings on her back.

With her leading the way, the mixed beast race’s experts launched their counterattack. As their leader of the junior generation made her move, everyone else did as well.

Long Chen followed from the rear and saw the fringes of the battlefield. Following Feng You’s orders, a large batch of the mixed beast race’s experts fell back and shrank the battle lines.

Very quickly, Long Chen saw the desolate beast race. Their auras were a bit similar to those of the mixed beast race, but they possessed a strange desolate qi, a sign that they were all extremely ancient species.

The desolate beast race consisted of all kinds of existences: some flew in the sky, others ran on the ground, swam in the water, and even climbed on the cliffs. Every conceivable form of existence seemed to be present. They were massive, and their sheer numbers were staggering as they crashed down upon the defenses of the mixed beast race.

Due to the fact that the mixed beast race had just undergone a bloody battle, they found themselves at an instant disadvantage and were forced to retreat further and further. When one of them fell in battle, the desolate beasts would directly devour their body. The scene was incredibly bloody.

“Die!”

Seeing her people being slain like this, Feng You was incensed. With her golden spear, she tore open a hole in their line of offense.

“Damn, this girl’s pretty violent!”

From the rear, Long Chen saw it clearly. That one attack from her had wiped out many enemies, including dozens of Eternal experts and even one Saint.

“Fall back! Leave this area to me!” shouted Feng You.

Just as she said this, two golden figures shot toward her, smashing bone clubs at her.

Long Chen jumped in shock. The two creatures were monkeys with golden fur, standing at less than five feet tall and appearing extremely skinny. They didn’t seem threatening at all. However, the world was enveloped in powerful Doyen energy upon their arrival.

“How can these two monkeys be so powerful?” Long Chen exclaimed in astonishment.

When their demonic qi erupted, their auras were only the slightest bit weaker than Xie Fei’s. However, when the two of them joined forces, their attacks were incomparably sharp.

BOOM!

The two monkeys and Feng You exchanged blows, producing golden divine light that blinded people. As their vision cleared, they witnessed the three combatants engaging in a fierce battle. Two bone clubs and a golden spear collided repeatedly, causing the world to flicker with each clash.

“I really was a frog at the bottom of a well before. Such small monkeys are actually capable of unleashing such immense power.”

The two monkeys looked so weak that a single slap could kill them, but their power was actually so monstrous.

Furthermore, their bone clubs didn’t seem to be natural objects. They were pure white like jade, but due to the golden runes covering them, they looked like gold-inlaid jade, and their auras were actually greater than those of an ordinary Saint item.

On the battlefield, the two monkeys could cooperate perfectly, while Feng You seemed to be very familiar with them. As a result, both sides were evenly matched.

“Kill!” DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

At this moment, the rest of the mixed beast race’s experts let out a furious cry and surged forward. In response, an endless tide of golden monkeys surged from behind the two monkeys.

These golden monkeys were different from the rest of the desolate beasts, as they held weapons in their hands and possessed immense power. The moment they clashed with the mixed beast race’s experts, an intense, bloody battle erupted.

In this chaotic battle, experts constantly fell on both sides, soaking the ground with their blood.

“These golden monkeys have an ancient bloodline and can actually direct this group of desolate beasts. In order to end this battle, they have to deal with those monkeys first.” Long Chen quickly realized that the golden monkeys were leading the desolate beasts.

Long Chen realized that their origins were somewhat special, but he couldn’t place where they came from. Clearly, their origins surpassed the scope of his knowledge.

While Long Chen was studying the golden monkeys, a Saint-level spotted tiger turned its attention to him. It was an enormous entity. It then opened its mouth and inhaled, sucking Long Chen into its mouth.

Just as Long Chen approached, he thrust the blood-colored saber to the top of the tiger’s mouth. Initially, Long Chen thought that this attack would pierce straight through its head and destroy its crystal core, killing it.

To his surprise, an unknown force somehow stopped his saber from penetrating any deeper after it pierced the tiger’s flesh, causing Long Chen to jump in fright. If he failed to kill it now, it would devour him, and then it would really be dangerous.

However, an even more stunning development unfolded. His saber quivered, and the spotted tiger let out a crazed roar, desperately struggling to shake off the saber as if its life depended on it.

Nevertheless, despite all its efforts, the saber didn’t budge. Long Chen was shocked to find the flesh around the saber starting to wither. Following that, the enormous spotted tiger quickly transformed into a desiccated corpse.

Only after draining every drop of its blood did the saber leave its lifeless body. Another sinister rune then lit up on the saber’s blade, and it let out a heaven-shaking saber cry.

“Damn, it can actually absorb blood like this as well.”

Gazing at the blood-stained saber, Long Chen couldn’t help but inhale sharply, feeling a chill run down his spine.
