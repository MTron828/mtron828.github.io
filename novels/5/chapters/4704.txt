Chapter 4693 Sovereign Blood Devil Submission

BOOM!

A brilliant dragon cry echoed, accompanied by an explosive sound that rent heaven and earth asunder. Wu Hun came to a staggering halt as the wild qi waves struck him. With an expression of disbelief, he looked in Long Chen’s direction.

However, Long Chen had vanished, replaced by a scarlet world with surging blood-colored qi waves in the air.

Amidst the scarlet qi waves, a blazing red sun slowly emerged, its searing heat and wild aura radiating outward. The moment it appeared, a wailing sound echoed through the air, as if the world was recoiling in fear.

The void endured a relentless cycle of fracture and healing, with each fracture unveiling a spectacle akin to the end of the world.

At the core of these rifts lay a divine ring, within which lurked a giant dragon. It was so big that the spectators could only see a few of its scales, not its true body.

As the dragon unleashed its deafening roar, its reverberation pierced through the world and struck people in the depths of their souls, stirring the most primal fear within them.

Long Chen slowly emerged at the center of the divine ring; his gleaming dragon scales bathed the entire world in a scarlet light. Before long, the blood-colored light started to thicken, deepening into a dark crimson.

Long Chen had summoned the Scarlet Dragon Battle Armor, yet what shocked Guo Ran and the others was the sudden appearance of the blood-colored cloak behind him.

Fluttering in the wind with a haunting sound, the cloak seemed imbued with a life of its own, and it exuded an aura of primal hunger, as if it thirsted for blood, battle, and slaughter.

“This is boss’s strongest battle armor?” Guo Ran murmured to himself, his eyes widening as he saw this scene. It was only a single addition of a cloak, yet it lent him an air of unparalleled dominance and might. Now, he indeed looked like an indisputable battle god.

Everyone on the battlefield was stunned speechless by Long Chen’s appearance, the endless dragon qi, and his dragon might.

With a deliberate movement, Long Chen extended his hand and clenched his fist, drawing out creaking and rumbling sounds. Only then did Long Chen comprehend the arduous journey of the mysterious dragon expert. Finally, he had reached the realm that the dragon expert had expected from him.

“If you knew I was a vengeful person but still continued to provoke me, I can only call you an idiot. You should have only targeted me and not harmed those I wish to protect. That will only make me angry, and when I’m angry, even I am afraid of myself.” Long Chen’s voice was hoarse, each word dripping with bloodlust.

In fact, Long Chen’s voice was quivering, not due to fear but rather anger. He couldn’t hold himself back anymore.

“What nonsense. You want to protect them? Then just watch as I kill them one by one while you’re powerless! Do you think you are the only one with trump cards?” exclaimed Wu Hun. After recovering from his shock, he suddenly vanished.

Buzz.

Space contorted within the ranks of the Dragonblood Legion, causing Guo Ran and the others to feel shocked. Wu Hun’s ability to breach space and appear among them left them dumbfounded. After all, the Dragonblood warriors were still exhausted, and Long Chen wouldn’t be able to go all out if he had to fight while worrying about them.

“Hahaha, die!”

Using the Three-Headed Heaven Devouring Beast race’s divine ability, Wu Hun broke through space and appeared amongst the Dragonblood Legion. As he thought that he was now in an unbeatable position, his fist descended upon one of the Dragonblood warriors.

However, he withheld his full power because he needed to keep enough of the Dragonblood Legion alive to make Long Chen afraid of going all-out. Also, he enjoyed the thought of killing the Dragonblood warriors one by one.

“Fuck off!”

Despite knowing that he wasn’t a match for Wu Hun, the Dragonblood warrior focused the remnants of his strength into his sword and launched a desperate, suicidal assault against him.

To everyone’s surprise, this slash cleanly sliced Wu Hun’s fist in two, and his blood flew through the air.

“What?!”

Even that Dragonblood warrior was stunned. He had thought that he was definitely dead, but he actually managed to injure Wu Hun.

At this moment, he sensed a warm current coming from his back. Turning around, he saw Long Chen’s hand pressed against his back. It became clear to him that Long Chen had bolstered the power of his slash. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

“Boss!”

Pow!

Just then, Long Chen darted forward like a phantom and appeared in front of that Dragonblood warrior. His hand surged forward, delivering a powerful slap directly toward the face of the still-stunned Wu Hun.

Long Chen’s movements were quick as lightning and fluid as water. Before Wu Hun could even react, Long Chen had propelled him forcefully out of the midst of the Dragonblood Legion.

BOOM!

The moment Wu Hun was outside of the Dragonblood Legion, divine light expanded out of Long Chen’s arm and crushed Wu Hun’s head, along with the void in the surroundings. The power behind Long Chen’s attack wreaked havoc on the laws of space, causing the hole in the void to expand instead of healing.

After blowing up Wu Hun’s head, Long Chen stomped toward Wu Hun, but unexpectedly, even after losing his head, Wu Hun could still dodge it.

“He’s still not dead yet?” The Dragonblood warriors cried out in shock.

Both of them directly vanished from sight. But all of a sudden, the void in the distance broke, revealing two of them.

Seizing Wu Hun by his robust neck, Long Chen swiftly ripped off his newly regenerated head.

“AH!”

Wu Hun’s scream of pain was abruptly cut short as Long Chen threw his severed head into the air and crushed it with a powerful kick.

After blowing up Wu Hun’s head, Long Chen’s claws tore the void, forcibly ripping Wu Hun’s headless body out of it.

His agonizing cries echoed out again as Long Chen tore off one of his legs. Three-colored blood sprayed through the air, but to Long Chen’s dismay, the blood directly transformed into wisps of smoke and returned to Wu Hun. His severed limb swiftly regenerated before them.

“In this world, no one can kill the great Three-Headed race! You can’t kill me, but I can kill your brothers at any time!” Wu Hun’s defiant roar echoed amidst Long Chen’s relentless onslaught. Somehow, he still tried to taunt Long Chen.

“In this world, there is no one that I cannot kill. Why don’t you try out this move of mine?”

Just then, Long Chen’s voice grew sinister as he brought his hands crashing together, unleashing a barrage of blood-colored chains from behind him.
