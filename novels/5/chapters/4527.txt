Chapter 4516 Corrupt Path Reappears

The whistling arrow relied on sound to alert others, so it rapidly tore through the air, unleashing a screeching sound that spread far into the distance.

This kind of whistling arrow would unleash a soundwave that roared like a tsunami. Even if you couldn’t see it, you could easily tell where it was coming from.

It was different from those cloud-piercing or explosive arrows. A whistling arrow was much more practical in a complicated terrain.

Long Chen was a great distance away when he first heard it. As he rushed closer, he quickly saw another arrow tearing through the sky. This time, he saw the arrow’s appearance.

After that, he started to hear the sounds of intense clashes, and qi waves buffeted him, indicating that someone was fighting. Furthermore, it seemed to be an intense fight.

“Die, you damn invaders!” A furious roar echoed through the air as a group of black-robed experts, bearing strange marks on their sleeves and collars, were attacking two people.

To Long Chen’s surprise, these two people turned out to be powerful Doyens. Under the assault of these black-robed experts, they were doing their best to escape, leaving the ground stained crimson with blood.

“It’s the Blood race!”

Long Chen sensed a powerful bloodline power from these two people. Its aura was dislikable, and he was all too familiar with it.

Seeing that they were from the Blood race, Long Chen had no desire to interfere. After all, the Blood race was the human race’s mortal enemy, and Long Chen himself had a deep enmity with them. He had killed so many of them that they had long since reached the point of being like water and fire.

These two Doyens were very powerful, matching Netherdragon Tianzhao’s strength from back then. Surrounded by these black-robed experts, they charged left and right, trying to break free. The ground bore witness to the aftermath, strewn with the lifeless bodies of their enemies. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

However, these black-robed experts were not weak either. Although none of them could match the two of them, they had a numbers advantage. The duo found themselves ensnared, unable to break free.

Adding to their predicament, a barrage of whistling arrows was launched, and more black-robed experts emerged from every direction. At first, they were only in the hundreds, but their ranks swiftly swelled to thousands.

As more of them gathered here, the two Doyens quickly reached their limits, engaged in a desperate battle for survival with their backs pressed against each other. They were already powerless to escape their blockade. It was merely a matter of time before they succumbed.

“Bastards! We didn’t have any problem with you! Why are you doing this?!” roared one of the two.

“No enmity? You are invaders! You’ve come to the world of the ninth heaven to take our resources! You are thieves, beggars!” cursed one of the black-robed experts.

Hidden in the dark, Long Chen was struck by a sudden sense of familiarity. This expert’s voice carried a distinctive aura—sinister in both tone and pitch. Long Chen felt an unsettling déjà vu, as if he had encountered this sensation before, yet struggled to place it immediately.

It seemed that they were the natives of this world, and they disliked outsiders like Long Chen and the two Doyens. They viewed them as invaders who had come to take their resources.

“Stop resisting! We will leave you to the sect master to deal with! Whether you live or die will be up to your luck. But if you’re just going to be stubborn, death is all that awaits you.”

This person was quite strong amongst the black-robed experts. He was only a level weaker than these two Blood race experts and seemed to possess a high status here. He had been directing the battle from the start.

“Really?”

Hearing that there was a chance at survival, the two of them were enticed. Although the two of them had killed quite a few of the natives, if they submitted, perhaps the other side would draw them into their camp due to their immense potential.

Even if they had to become slaves, that was better than dying right here and now.

“Of course. My Heavenly Corrupt Sect always keeps its word,” said that black-robed expert arrogantly.

Hearing this, Long Chen was taken aback and instantly realized why he found them familiar. Countless scenes flashed in his mind.

“Heavenly Corrupt Sect? So they’re all from the Corrupt path, and they all have the Corrupt God’s aura on them.”

No wonder Long Chen struggled to pinpoint where he had previously sensed this aura. These individuals were practitioners of the Corrupt path, mortal enemies from his days on the Martial Heaven Continent. However, since entering the immortal world, he had never encountered any of them.

He had assumed that the Corrupt God’s legacy was limited to the mortal world. Yet, now he encountered the Corrupt God’s legacy in this place. Furthermore, he also felt like he had heard the name of the Heavenly Corrupt Sect.

In other words, the Heavenly Corrupt Sect was not such a simple sect. Long Chen couldn’t help but wonder if a more formidable Corrupt God lurked within the vast expanse of the nine heavens and ten lands. The revelation stirred a profound unease within his heart.

“Alright, we-”

Just as the Blood race’s experts submitted, that Corrupt expert suddenly unleashed a ray of black light from his hand that stabbed the head of one of the Blood race experts.

“AH!”

It was a black claw the size of a chicken egg. When it pierced that person’s head, he screamed in immense pain.

“You don’t keep your word!” the other Blood expert shouted, but without his comrade’s support, he succumbed in just a few moves. One sword severed his head from his body, while another razor-sharp blade penetrated his skull.

Even after all of this, they didn’t immediately die. They kept screaming as if enduring unimaginable pain.

“The same methods and the same flavor.” Long Chen sneered. The Corrupt path’s people always used these despicable methods. They would torture people until they could refine their souls into berserk resentful spirits.

After that, they would seal those resentful spirits in their weapons, enhancing their weapons. Furthermore, the lingering resentment within the weapons would affect their opponent’s minds during combat. If struck by one of those weapons, even if it was just a graze, their opponent would be infected by the resentment.

This poison had almost no cure. Once struck by such a weapon, the consequences were dire, and death was an inevitable outcome.

“I curse you! You won’t have a good life!”

When the two heads started to wither, the Corrupt weapons shone with a strange light. They were like fiends eating their fill.

“Bastards, it’s been a month since you entered, but we only found your tracks now. Alert the sect master. If the invaders have been here for so long, it means that the Void Spirit World is about to open. Our Heavenly Corrupt Sect must seize this chance.”

The Corrupt leader pulled out the black claw. Clearly, he had done a soulsearch and gained access to the knowledge of the two Blood experts.

“I trust that other powers have long since started hunting for the invaders. However, they are too crafty and didn’t leak any information. Since we learned of their existence too late, we’ll have to hurry up,” conveyed another expert of the Heavenly Corrupt Sect.

“Even if you hurry, it’s already too late!”

Just then a voice rang out, causing the expressions of the Heavenly Corrupt Sect’s people to change. They searched for the source of the sound, only to find a man clad in black robes. He wore a warm smile and greeted them with a friendly wave.
