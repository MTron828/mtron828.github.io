Chapter 4451 Then I Won’t Stand on Courtesy

Long Chen and Netherdragon Tianzhao collided once more, and this time, the collision was greater than ever.

Following that, the entire world twisted. The stars and the vortex in the sky entwined, creating a chaotic fusion. A sense of disorientation enveloped everyone as if their vision had been stripped away. These people were all experts, so they knew that Long Chen and Netherdragon Tianzhao were entering the climax of their fight.

Through numerous tests and exchanges, both had proven equally matched in technique and combat experience. Growing impatient, they came to the conclusion that the only way to win was through ultimate power.

This wasn’t a battle of finesse or technique; it was a relentless struggle to determine whose power stood supreme.

BOOM!

There was another explosive sound. From within the chaotic storm of broken Grand Dao runes, a figure came wretchedly flying out.

“It’s Netherdragon Tianzhao!”

“Did Netherdragon Tianzhao lose?!”

Just then, Long Chen also came charging out, pursuing Netherdragon Tianzhao. In their third round of battle, Netherdragon Tianzhao was sent flying. That proved that in terms of pure power, he was slightly weaker than Long Chen.

This result left people dumbfounded. Although they had known that there would be a decisive battle today, most people had felt that Netherdragon Tianzhao’s odds of victory were higher.

However, he turned out to be the loser. Even after using his Doyen power, he was still sent flying; this signified that he was inferior to Long Chen.

Witnessing this, the Dragonblood Legion let out heaven-shaking roars. If Long Chen won in terms of pure power, then Long Chen would definitely win this battle. Their boss was always unrivaled.

“Not good!”DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

Suddenly, Ye Ling let out a startled cry.

Just as people thought that Long Chen would keep pressing Netherdragon Tianzhao, a stunning turn of events unfolded. Blood splattered through the air.

Long Chen was suddenly retreating, his golden blood spraying in all directions. They saw a gaping wound on his chest, its depth revealing the bare bones underneath.

Turning their gaze to Netherdragon Tianzhao, they noticed him wielding a strange spear. The spearhead was unusually large, nearly half the length of the entire weapon.

This pitch-black spear flickered with draconic runes, casting an ominous glow. When it appeared, a malevolent aura enveloped the world, sending temperatures plummeting and inducing shivers among the onlookers.

This was a terrifying divine weapon. It exuded an air of bloodthirst, resembling a savage beast driven by an insatiable urge to kill.

“If your reactions had been even slightly slower, you’d be in two pieces now,” declared Netherdragon Tianzhao, glaring at Long Chen with icy killing intent.

He was genuinely furious, as his entire life had been dedicated to the pursuit of battle. Countless times, he had tricked the vigilant gaze of the nether dragon race to embark on perilous adventures alone, so the bulk of his achievements came from willingly risking his life in such endeavors. This was also the reason why, among the two brothers, he was regarded more favorably. After all, true experts could not be greenhouse flowers raised within the safety of their homes.

Throughout his existence, defeat had been a foreign concept to him. Whether it was fighting across realms or against multiple opponents, regardless of the disadvantageous circumstances, he had never lost.

Yet, on this day, he found himself defeated thrice over. In the domain battle, he suffered defeat. In the contest of the dragon race's divine abilities, he was vanquished. In the end, even in the unfettered clash of pure power, he succumbed to Long Chen.

This was an absolutely merciless blow to his confidence, and he could not accept it. Just now, had he not used this divine weapon of the nether dragon race, he would have fallen to Long Chen’s tempest of attacks.

Originally, they had been fighting barehanded. For him to abruptly take out an inherited divine weapon to save his life, especially given his prideful nature, was an unacceptable humiliation.

“What kind of weapon is that?!” exclaimed Guo Ran. Just by looking at it, he could tell that it was no ordinary weapon.

“It’s a Saint weapon. It is merged with a Saint’s soul, so it is innately capable of unleashing a Saint-level attack. In this kind of situation, Long Chen will definitely lose! Have him run!” warned Ye Ling.

As the name implied, it was a weapon for Saints, and only someone with Saint power could use it. However, Netherdragon Tianzhao’s Saint weapon was fused with a Saint soul. Thus, even though he wasn’t a Saint, he was still able to unleash its power, making this attack almost equivalent to the full-power attack of a Saint.

Ye Ling was well aware that Long Chen was a peak expert with great pride, so she knew that she alone couldn’t convince Long Chen to retreat. However, if everyone were to tell him just how unfair this fight was, even if he did run, it wouldn’t affect his prestige.

“Time for you to die, you damn ant-like human! You aren’t qualified to be mentioned in the same breath as me!” Netherdragon Tianzhao roared, his face contorting with fury. Unable to accept his defeat, he spiraled into madness.

“Nether Dragon Heavenly Wrath!”

As the spear descended, a black dragon materialized behind Netherdragon Tianzhao. In an instant, this spectral image seamlessly fused with the spear, and a roar resonated, seemingly coming from ancient times. The draconic runes on the spear seemed to come to life.

A profound silence enveloped the world, as if the only existence in this reality was that very spear. It stood as a supreme force. These experts were suddenly shocked to find that they were rendered immobile, stripped of even the ability to think.

While unaware of what kind of weapon that spear was, they knew that it was an attack that no one could block.

The race leader of the nether dragon race let out a sigh when he saw Netherdragon Tianzhao take out this spear. In the end, things had still progressed to this point, and this was not what he had expected.

Long Chen was too powerful. Although the race leader was a bit unwilling, he had no choice but to let Netherdragon Tianzhao kill Long Chen. Even if it meant sacrificing Long Chen’s secrets, they had to maintain Netherdragon Tianzhao’s sharpness. If Netherdragon Tianzhao could not kill Long Chen right here and now, he would face a setback he would probably never recover from.

“Everyone saw it. He was the one to take out a weapon first, so I won’t stand on courtesy,” Long Chen declared, showing no fear in the face of the formidable Saint weapon. Instead, an air of excitement surrounded him. Much to the astonishment of onlookers, he produced a bronze cauldron.

In a dramatic turn of events, the Saint weapon collided with the cauldron and, just like that, it exploded before the eyes of the stunned crowd.
