Chapter 3304 Flames of Fury Ignite

“Boss Long, we were wrong! If we had known you would be coming, we wouldn’t have dared to offend you even if it cost us our lives!”

Over ten Divine Lords were kneeling on the ground, and their leader was weeping bitterly.

Those Divine Lords had been trying to rob them. But after a quick beating from Qin Feng, Qi Yu, and Xu Zixiong, they were kneeling and begging for mercy.

Also, when they saw Long Chen walk off of the flying boat, their souls almost fled their bodies in terror. It was like seeing a Yama King. They instantly cried out, weeping. All they wanted was for Long Chen to not kill them.

Bai Shishi was surprised by this reaction. Was Long Chen’s fame really so great? It had even reached the Heavenly Rainbow Domain?

Even Long Chen was surprised. Their terrified expressions didn’t seem to be fake.

“Are you afraid of me?” asked Long Chen.

“No, not afraid, worshipful! Yes, we fervently worship you! Every day, we dream, every night we cry to follow your side-!”

“Stop. If you don’t give me a real answer, I’ll cut off your head,” said Long Chen coldly. This fellow was treating him like a three-year-old child. What kind of bullshit was this? It was practically an insult to his intelligence.Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

“We really do admire you. Practically everyone in the nearby domains knows your name,” said that person hastily.

“How did you come to know of it?” asked Long Chen.

“In the Yuhua Palace, you killed their top heavenly genius, Jiang Baihe. He was a terrifying underworld ghost seed. News of this has spread far and wide.”

Bai Shishi and the others nodded when they heard this answer. So it was due to the matter of the underworld ghost seed. That was understandable. The implications of an underworld ghost seed were immense. It would be best if word of it spread as far as possible. As a result, Long Chen’s name would also spread.

“But get to the point. Why are you afraid of me?” asked Long Chen, his expression not changing.

Terrified, that person finally said the reason, and it made Bai Shishi and the others’ expressions change. Raging killing intent then exploded out of all of them.

When Jiang Baihe was killed by Long Chen and the news of the underworld ghost seed spread, a rumor also spread with it. That was that Long Chen was very likely another underworld ghost seed.

It was said that individual underworld ghost seeds were independent and could kill each other for power. When Long Chen went to the Yuhua Palace, he immediately caused a fight with Jiang Baihe. His intention was clear from the start, so people couldn’t help but question his motives.

As a result of this rumor, countless people suspected him of being an underworld ghost seed as well. This rumor had long since spread to the streets. But during this time, Long Chen was in the Vile Dragon Domain, a rather isolated space. Thus, he hadn’t heard these rumors.

This news made Xu Zixiong curse, “Do these idiots have crap instead of brains?! They’ll believe such nonsense?!”

“Just who was harming boss?! I’ll kill them!” Qin Feng clenched his teeth.

“It was definitely Jiang Weizhong. He is unwilling to just let his Jiang family’s heavenly genius die at boss’s hands. Since he doesn’t dare to find boss for revenge himself, he spread this rumor. The High Firmament Academy is against Lord Brahma, so anyone affiliated with Lord Brahma will automatically believe this rumor and push it on. As long as people start pointing their weapons at boss, when boss counterattacks, it will turn into a bloodbath. Then countless people will say that he is an underworld ghost seed killing people of the immortal world. Through this, what is false will become true,” said Qi Yu darkly.

Qi Yu knew Jiang Weizhong better than the others. He was very petty and stubborn. This kind of thing was definitely in line with his style. They had all seen the hatred and rancor in his eyes when they left.

“Then isn’t Long Chen going to become everyone’s target?” asked Bai Shishi, a bad feeling rising in her heart.

Countless heavenly geniuses were now flocking to the Heavenly Rainbow Domain. The top experts of the nearby domains were all here. As these prideful experts were like bulls in heat, it was all too easy for them to start fighting each other.

If Long Chen appeared, it would definitely cause countless waves. Countless people would challenge Long Chen under the guise of righteousness. With Long Chen’s temper, would he possibly indulge them?

Long Chen would definitely slaughter those fools, but that would simply be jumping into their trap. Thinking of that, Bai Shishi couldn’t help shivering. This was a malicious plot with no antidote. Jiang Weizhong was truly sinister.

“No, don’t call it being everyone’s target. It’s only natural that Boss Long San becomes the focal point no matter where he goes. I very much enjoy that feeling. I passed through the mortal world just like that. I’m not afraid of death. If they want to come, then let them come. The immortal world’s principles weren’t born through talking, but through killing. Once I kill them to the point where they’re afraid, then what I say will be what’s right. No one can retort.” Long Chen was also furious inside. But since this had happened, just being angry was useless. Long Chen wasn’t afraid of any scheme.

This malicious scheme, which turned him into the target of countless people, actually made his battle intent rise. He wouldn’t bother to explain himself, as there was nothing that his saber couldn’t resolve. If there was something like that, then he would use two sabers.

“Boss Long, we have the utmost confidence in you. How could you be an underworld ghost seed? The oldest academy of the world, the High Firmament Academy, couldn’t possibly have misjudged you, especially considering your fame. It’s absolutely impossible. We’ll definitely join forces with our friends to help you right your name. Those people that are ruining your name are absolutely immoral!” cried out the bandit ringleader. He swore solemnly, patting his chest. His powerful desire to live was clearly shown at the moment.

Bai Shishi looked at that person. He didn’t look to be a good fellow. If such a fierce and ominous fellow were to help testify for Long Chen, it would probably have the opposite effect.

These people were rogue cultivators. The phenomena in the Heavenly Rainbow Domain had drawn countless people over, and they had also come to take advantage of it. Of course, any majestic flying boats or majestic steeds were too intimidating for them to even get close to.

However, Bai Shishi’s flying boat was old and broken, so they had set their sights on them. But they hadn’t expected to run into a Yama King. They all wanted to cry and blame their terrible luck. Just as they thought that they would finally have some meat to eat, they didn’t even know if they would be keeping their lives.

“Boss, the Yuhua Palace will definitely come this time. If we encounter Jiang Weizhong, let’s cut off his head, killing the chicken to warn the monkeys!” said Bai Xiaole hatefully. Everyone in the group felt that the current Bai Xiaole was no longer the old Bai Xiaole who was afraid of every little thing. He finally had a bit of the flavor of a man.

“A dancing clown like that doesn’t need our attention. If he does run into me, then he can only blame his own fate for being so short. If he doesn’t, then I won’t waste the time and effort looking for him. Now that we’ve come to the Heavenly Rainbow Domain, the first thing to do is to show the people of the Heavenly Rainbow Domain just who Boss Long San is.”

Long Chen looked at the people kneeling on the ground. “Bring me to the Bloodkill Hall of your Heavenly Rainbow Domain. If you make up for your mistake with this, I won’t punish you for this matter.”
