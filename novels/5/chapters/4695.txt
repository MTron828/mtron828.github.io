Chapter 4684 Desperate Counterattack

Long Chen exerted his full power to withstand the attack of the Warrior of the Starry Sky, but at that critical moment, a sneak attacker seized the opportunity to strike him.

With impeccable timing and precision, he executed the attack perfectly, catching Long Chen unaware until the very last moment.

At the moment of the attack, Ying Tian’s gloomy and cold eyes appeared in Long Chen’s mind. Those eyes were like those of a devil.

It went without saying that Ying Tian was truly patient. He had been in the heavenly tribulation all this time, hiding without revealing the slightest killing intent toward Long Chen to avoid being sensed.

Although Long Chen narrowly avoided the killing blow in the end, the distraction resulted in him not being able to match the power of the Warrior of the Starry Sky.

Long Chen felt like he was on the verge of exploding, seething with rage. In his gamble for survival, he had overlooked the presence of this formidable assassin

BOOM!

Light erupted along the whale spine, but instead of engulfing Long Chen, the formidable energy surged forth from its tip. Suddenly, the focus of the attack shifted to the left side of Long Chen’s head.

Blood sprayed as the attack found its mark, revealing the presence of Ying Tian, the top expert of the Lifehunter race. His expression twisted into one of shock as half of his body was obliterated by the devastating force.

Ying Tian struggled to comprehend how Long Chen could defy the heavens and harness the power of the Warrior of the Starry Sky to launch a devastating counterattack against him.

As the Lifehunter race’s apex assassin, his experience in assassinations was unparalleled. In his assessment, Long Chen should have been doomed no matter what. Yet, when Long Chen unexpectedly retaliated, Ying Tian’s assassin reflexes compelled him to dodge, narrowly saving his life.

Just like Long Chen had managed to evade his attack but still suffered injury, Ying Tian found himself wounded as well. Half of his body was destroyed.

Without time for further contemplation, Ying Tian swayed and faded into the void like a phantom.

Just then, Long Chen escaped the scope of the whale spine and unleashed a powerful fist precisely where Ying Tian had stood moments before.

BOOM!

The impact caused the void to erupt in a violent explosion, revealing a faint figure fleeing amidst the shattered spatial fragments. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Long Chen seethed with rage. He knew he had missed his chance by a hair’s breadth. If only he had been a fraction faster, his punch would have struck, sealing Ying Tian’s fate.

Finally, the experts recovered from their shock. After all, Ying Tian’s assassination attempt had been all too sudden, and by the time they reacted, it was already over.

Long Chen or Ying Tian had just walked by the gates of hell just now, but the entire process actually happened in the blink of an eye.

Long Chen suddenly blinked away, and the whale spine stabbed right where he had been. The Warrior of the Starry Sky’s attacks were relentless like always.

The hole in Long Chen’s chest seemed very frightening, and it was healing very slowly as the destructive energy of the Warrior of the Starry Sky messed with his regenerative power.

Long Chen’s expression was gloomy as he reflected on the assassination attempt, and it caused him to tremble in cold sweat. Had Lei Linger not been absorbing the power of the Warrior of the Starry Sky, which allowed her to divert the deadly thrust of the whale spine, Long Chen knew he would have perished without question.

“I may not have succeeded, but now you’re left with only half your life. Let's see how you fare against the mightiest warrior beneath the starry sky.” Ying Tian’s slimy voice echoed once more.

Long Chen tensed at his voice, noting the absence of any signs of severe injury in it. Moreover, his voice seemed to emanate from all directions, making it impossible for Long Chen to pinpoint his exact location.

“The strongest warrior beneath the starry sky? Is he talking about...?”

“A Warrior of the Starry Sky?”

Disbelief rippled through the crowd as the concept of Warriors of the Starry Sky had long been dismissed as mere myth—a cautionary tale spun by storytellers to remind everyone that there was always someone stronger.

Amongst these experts, only those hailing from the most illustrious lineages had ever heard of Warriors of the Starry Sky.

“No wonder he could kill a nine star heir in one move! How terrifying!”

Since the nine star heirs were the strongest warriors of the nine heavens and ten lands, the only ones who could destroy them were the mythical Warriors of the Starry Sky.

Looking at the Warrior of the Starry Sky, everyone was shocked, unable to comprehend how such a terrifying existence ended up manifesting within Long Chen’s heavenly tribulation. He even slew a nine star heir in a single strike.

In truth, the nine star heir was restricted to the same realm as Long Chen, as he was an existence within the laws of heavenly tribulation.

Yet, the Warrior of the Starry Sky clearly transcended the scope of the heavenly tribulation’s laws. It was blatant cheating, and Long Chen could only silently complain as he dodged with all his power.

Ying Tian’s taunt ignited the fierce rage within Long Chen. Had it not been for his interference, by working together with Lei Linger, Long Chen had been quite certain that he could deal a serious blow to the Warrior of the Starry Sky, or at least, suppress the latter’s cultivation base to the same realm as his.

As long as they were in the same realm, even without a proper weapon, Long Chen was confident that he could handle the Warrior of the Starry Sky. However, this had been ruined by Ying Tian.

Ripples spread through the void as Long Chen repeatedly struck the air. He seemed to have gone mad as he tried to force Ying Tian out of the void.

“Hehe, how amusing to witness the mighty Long Chen reduced to a madman. I shall relish every moment as you stumble toward your inevitable death,” sneered Ying Tian.

He was like a stealthy leopard stalking its prey under the cover of night, waiting for its target’s death. His voice was particularly enraging yet also frightening.

Outside, the Dragonblood warriors grew increasingly anxious. After all, the Lifehunter race was renowned for their unfathomable abilities, and the lurking presence of such an assassin put immense pressure on Long Chen, multiplying the danger manifold.

“Let me deal with him.”

Yue Zifeng’s expression darkened as he was about to go into the tribulation regardless of the consequences. He was aware that the only ones capable of dealing with Ying Tian were him and Long Chen. However, Long Chen had to deal with the Warrior of the Starry Sky and also remain wary of Luo Changsheng and the others.

“Zifeng, you can’t!”

The others cried out. If Yue Zifeng went there, the tribulation would just end him before he could even attack Ying Tian.

BOOM!

Just then, an explosive sound rang out within the tribulation. After going through the void repeatedly, Long Chen suddenly forced a figure out.

“Boss has succeeded!”

The Dragonblood warriors cheered upon seeing Ying Tian be forced out.

Just as Ying Tian was out, the whale spine whipped straight toward him.
