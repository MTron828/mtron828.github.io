Chapter 3899 Mysterious Staff

The Pill Fairy intercepted the advancing force on one side, while the golden war goddess stood resolute, preventing their advance on the other side.

In another direction, this juvenile-looking youth unleashed a single pupil art, causing all the experts in that vicinity to seemingly evaporate into thin air. The battlefield, once teeming with enemies, instantly felt emptier.

Three people unleashed three attacks to stop the enemies on three sides. Although there was still a large group of experts that got through, the Dragonblood warriors were fearless. As long as those experts weren’t concentrated together, it was manageable.

However, despite the arrival of these three, the powerful experts were not dissuaded. Every time they looked at the dragon scale, their eyes reddened and they charged forward recklessly. The Dragonblood Legion had to go all-out to stop them.

“I am Guo Ran. Junior brother, you are…?” asked Guo Ran.

“Hahaha, I’m Bai Xiaole! This is my big sister Bai Shishi. We all follow boss Long Chen!” Bai Xiaole turned back to Guo Ran after using his pupil art.

“I follow myself. Don’t spout nonsense.” This woman was Bai Shishi. She had gone with Bai Xiaole to a treasure land where metal qi gathered, and it was just what Bai Shishi needed.

Originally, Bai Xiaole was thinking of looking around more to see if there was a place more suitable for him to condense a Heavenly Dao Crown, but Bai Shishi wanted to go into seclusion, so he had to stand guard over her.

After that, when the huge disturbance erupted, Bai Xiaole used his Three Flower Pupils to see what was going on there and immediately wanted to rush over.

However, Bai Shishi was at a critical juncture, so he couldn’t leave alone. When Bai Shishi finished, the two immediately charged over. They only coincidentally arrived together with the Pill Fairy to resolve the trouble.

Bai Xiaole stuck out his tongue. “Ignore her. In any case, we’re all on the same side. What is going on with boss?” Bai Xiaole waved his hand to Long Chen who was encased in a dragon scale egg.

“Boss Long Chen is currently absorbing the true dragon runes inside the dragon scale. He has already finished the first, and there are seven more. We have to stand guard until he’s done,” said Guo Ran.

Amidst the rumbling, Bai Shishi and the Pill Fairy began fighting off those countless experts. One was in control of the Heavenly Rainbow Flame, and the other was in control of sharp metal energy. Neither of them was afraid of fighting groups. They had huge area-of-effect attacks that completely stopped their enemies, relieving the pressure on the Dragonblood Legion.

From their positions, they were affecting the entire battlefield. The ones who went past them also didn’t dare to go all-out for fear of those two collapsing on them. Then they would be pincered and truly doomed.

With Yu Qingxuan and Bai Shishi joining in, the tempo of the battlefield slowed down. In this situation, the Dragonblood Legion’s formation was extremely effective.

Even with endless enemies, as long as they didn’t concentrate all their attacks on the Dragonblood warriors at once, there was nothing to be afraid of.

As the Dragonblood Legion unleashed their killing formation, a mesmerizing display of divine light danced around them. In the next instant, Sword Qi erupted like a tempest, accompanied by resounding dragon cries that reverberated through the battlefield. The Dragonblood warriors, fully harnessing the power of their dragon blood energy, experienced a profound resonance within their bloodlines, elevating their collective coordination to an unprecedented level.

Over twenty-seven hundred Dragonblood warriors were stopping an endless tide of experts on the level of city lords. The full might of all twenty-seven hundred of them merged perfectly, and after forcibly stopping the first wave, they took command of the tempo and counterattacked.

Their slaughter formation was like saw blades for flesh. Countless experts were directly blasted apart by their brute power, and countless fragments of divine weapons flew through the air. However, those weapons belonged to both their enemies and the Dragonblood warriors.

After their weapons exploded, the Dragonblood warriors switched to whatever weapon they could grab.

“Fuck, if my brothers could use the divine weapons that I forged, these fellows would be worthless against them!” Seeing the Dragonblood warriors using random weapons, Guo Ran felt terrible inside.

Some of the Dragonblood warriors were using swords and sabers. However, some of those sabers were already broken, and some warriors were even more pitiful. One in particular was only using half a rounded mace as a weapon.

Now, the Dragonblood Legion was like a group of impoverished bandits. They were using whatever they could get their hands on. Their weapons didn’t suit them, causing their combat potential to be much lower than it could be. That made Guo Ran, as the general, feel extremely bad.

Every single Dragonblood warrior was an elite trained through countless battles, the killing gods of the battlefield. Even in the immortal world where there were countless heavenly geniuses and Supremes, their light was not covered.

It didn’t matter what opponent they faced. The Dragonblood warriors were always the bravest, craziest wolves. They didn’t know fear and never ran away from a fight.

Even without suitable weapons, they still maintained their complete formation, crazily slaughtering their enemies. As a result, crimson blood rained down from the heavens.

Luckily, without powerful weapons, they still had the powerful Dragon Blood Battle Armor, which invoked a potent dragon blood domain.

Within this domain, their power flowed easily as if an invisible dragon was swimming around them protectively. Even after fighting for so long, instead of succumbing to fatigue, they only grew fiercer, as if their power was inexhaustible.

“Gather up and kill those two women before charging again! Don’t waste time with a battle of attrition!” After seeing that they were unable to break through the Dragonblood Legion’s formation even after attacking for a long time, someone gave an order.

The skilled experts could see that the Dragonblood Legion’s formation could only be destroyed if they launched an instantaneous attack that overwhelmed them. Otherwise, they would just be sending themselves to their deaths.

Just then, a huge group of powerful experts appeared in the distance, akin to a black cloud coming their way. There were hundreds of thousands of them.

“Those are…!”

Xia Chen was surprised when he saw them. Those were the people that Bai Xiaole had made vanish.

“Sorry, I can’t kill so many of them at once, so I can only use the spatial energy of my pupil art to transport them away. Furthermore, I can’t send them too far. They’ve come back,” said Bai Xiaole apologetically.

“Pupil art?! You know pupil arts?! Aiya, this thing is for you then!” Guo Ran slapped his leg and suddenly took out a staff, handing it to Bai Xiaole. “Boss said that he was saving this for a brother who knew pupil arts. He must have meant you.”

This staff was none other than the artifact left behind by the Heavenly Eye elder. Prior to his departure, the elder had bestowed two invaluable treasures upon them: his Six Dao Heavenly Eye and this remarkable staff.

Bai Xiaole reached out and touched it. The moment he did so, the entire staff transformed into runes, which then flowed and formed a spatial gate.

As the spatial gate opened, a pair of giant eyes appeared within it. The moment those eyes manifested, an icy chill permeated the air, causing a bone-deep coldness that seemed capable of freezing one's very soul to appear.Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Brat, you wish to form a contract with me?”

As the master of those eyes spoke, its voice shook the nine heavens, changing the very color of the sky.
