Chapter 4887 World Shaking Clash

Finally feeling afraid, Huo Qianwu strengthened her defense. She was unaware that against someone like Long Chen, defending was like taking the first step toward defeat.

Thanks to the Split the Heavens runes on Evilmoon, Long Chen could unleash Split the Heavens at will and even launch their merged slash almost instantly.

Back then, Evilmoon had helped Long Chen with the creation of the runes. One reason was to reduce the time for the dragon blood energy accumulation, while another reason was so that once it could control its own power, these runes would be the bridge for its power to merge with Long Chen’s.

Unfortunately, for the greatest power, they could only accumulate power one slash at a time. This was exceedingly difficult in a clash against experts, as the opponent would easily notice the buildup and interrupt it.

Nevertheless, if the opponent failed to interrupt, the power of this technique would far surpass that of an attack unleashed simply by activating the runes.

When Long Chen finished channeling all seven slashes, every drop of his dragon blood power was absorbed by Evilmoon. After that, Evilmoon’s dragon runes lit up, and a strange flame blazed out of it.

While the vice hall master had shouted out a warning, he was too late. Huo Qianwu’s soul quivered with terror as an intense sensation of impending death made her hair stand on end.

It was her first time feeling the true sensation of death. Even when Long Chen’s saber had cut her throat, she hadn’t experienced such a feeling.

“Heavenly Fate Cycle, Heaven Earth Lock!”

Forming hand seals, Huo Qianwu moved the Heavenly Fate Disk in front of her to turn it into a giant shield.

At the same time, the Blaze Dragon Bone Whip transformed into a blaze dragon diagram and appeared on top of the Heavenly Fate Disk. Meanwhile, the Thousand Phoenix Feather Dress emitted a thousand rays of divine light that illuminated the Heavenly Fate Disk.

Under the threat of death, Huo Qianwu unleashed all her power, no longer holding back in the slightest. She operated the two Heaven Saint divine weapons and Heavenly Fate Disk to their fullest.

BOOM!

When Evilmoon collided with the Heavenly Fate Disk, a black spot appeared at the point of contact, rapidly expanding into a black hole that devoured all colors from the world.

Darkness spread, accompanied by a heaven-shaking explosion. The black domain then struck the barrier of the mountain, causing it to bulge.

The experts outside the barrier were horrified and hastily fled. Even the vice hall master and Xing Wujiang retreated, unwilling to be touched by the encroaching darkness.

Moreover, the barrier possessed terrifying curse energy that would instantly afflict those above the Divine Venerate realm upon contact. Even Heaven Saints wouldn’t necessarily survive it.

Once they retreated, their gazes remained locked on the battlefield. As the darkness slowly faded, they saw two figures flying back. Both Long Chen and Huo Qianwu spat out blood, injured in this exchange.

“Heavens, is Long Chen a monster? He’s actually able to press a Heavenly Chosen to this extent!”

People were amazed, unable to believe this result. After all, Long Chen’s opponent was a Heavenly Chosen, an unrivaled existence beneath the heavens.

“Truly heaven-defying!”

Even most of the Heaven Saints were shocked. The stronger they were, the more they understood just how terrifying a Heavenly Chosen was.

“The Heavenly Fate Disk is damaged...!” Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“Impossible!”

When they looked at Huo Qianwu’s Heavenly Fate Disk, they saw that not only had it lost its light, but it was even cracked.

“A Heavenly Fate Disk represents the laws of heaven and earth, the karmic luck of the heavens, and the function of the ten thousand Daos! How could it crack?!”

The shocked vice hall master suddenly shouted, “Qianwu, run! The weapon in his hand definitely isn’t ordinary!”

“You forgot to pierce the barrier first. She can’t hear you,” mocked Xing Wujiang.

After enduring the last collision, the barrier was as thin as a cicada’s wing. However, as long as it wasn’t broken, no voice could possibly go in.

At this moment, many experts hastily retreated from the deformed barrier. If the vice hall master were to pierce it again, it might even explode, and all of them would be wiped out of existence.

Indeed, the vice hall master raised his hand, but he halted midway. If the barrier really did explode, even Long Chen and Huo Qianwu would also die. Hence, he decided not to do it.

Within the barrier, Long Chen and Huo Qianwu hacked up blood again, their auras plummeting. Unable to maintain the Dragon Blood Battle Armor any longer, he transformed back to his usual appearance. Meanwhile, Huo Qianwu’s Heavenly Fate Disk creaked, on the verge of shattering. Hastily forming hand seals, she caused it to become illusory and return behind her.

“Now you’re out of energy. As I said, I’m the ultimate victor,” said Huo Qianwu. Wiping off some blood, she retrieved the Blaze Dragon Bone Whip and looked at Long Chen coldly as she started walking toward him.

“Are they going to keep fighting?!”

Facing Huo Qianwu, Long Chen lazily brought Evilmoon back to his shoulder and said, “That plate of yours is pretty tough. It didn’t break, but I feel like it’ll break with one more attack. I’m curious, if that plate breaks, will you still be a Heavenly Chosen?”

Long Chen wasn’t the only one curious as everyone else wondered the same thing. Other than the Flame Divine Hall’s people, the others hadn’t seen a Heavenly Fate Disk before. They were curious about what would happen if it was destroyed.

“I’m also curious, but I don’t think you have that ability,” sneered Huo Qianwu. She suddenly quickened her footsteps and remarked, “Although I don’t have much energy left, the Blaze Dragon Bone Whip and Thousand Phoenix Feather Dress still have some. It’s enough to kill you.”

The Blaze Dragon Bone Whip rose, accompanied by a resounding dragon cry. Flames soared as the whip pierced toward Long Chen like a spear. Suddenly, a hand covered in stars firmly caught the whip in its grasp.
