Chapter 3743 Luo Tribe

Long Chen saw three Divine Lords with overflowing Blood Qi fighting a group of World Kings. Amongst them was also a half-step Divine Venerate.

The three of them were actually crushing their opponents. There were already dozens of corpses on the ground, all World Kings.

In the distance, Long Chen saw the ruins of a city. There were thousands of people inside with terrified expressions, and a group of Immortal Kings were guarding it. They wished to join the battle in front of them, but they were too weak.

“My tribe has no enmity with you! Why must you force us to this extent?!” roared the half-step Divine Venerate as he barely managed to block one of the three.

This person that he was blocking was a Supreme heavenly genius. His Blood Qi was overflowing, and he gave off immense pressure. His aura contained a wild aura. He was actually from the demonic beast race.

“No enmity? Do I need enmity to kill your human race? You inferior humans, you never should have been born in this world.” That demonic beast sneered and unleashed a punch on the elder’s weapon.

With an explosive sound, he actually faced a divine weapon barehanded, and his golden palm wasn’t damaged in the slightest. Instead, it was the elder who was knocked back. This hand of his was his Supreme Bone.

“I’ll go all-out against you!” The elder’s Blood Qi was shaken, and he roared, directly igniting the flame of his life to raise his combat power.

“What are you going to use to go all-out?” The demonic beast sneered and extended his hand. A golden rune then appeared on his palm, and his wild aura instantly grew by several times.

All of a sudden, a black light flickered and blood splashed. That man’s hand was cut off. Following that, a black-robed man appeared and grabbed that hand.

It was Long Chen. With a strike of his black dagger, he cut off that person’s hand. When Long Chen grabbed it, it suddenly transformed into a giant bear paw.

“Tch, this thing is useless.” Seeing it turn into a bear palm, Long Chen couldn’t help being disappointed. He tossed it into the primal chaos space.

Golden light was exploding from the bear paw just as he tossed it into the primal chaos space. It tried to escape Long Chen’s hold, but the moment it entered the primal chaos space, the demonic beast roared in pain.

His Supreme Bone aura instantly vanished. Having lost his Supreme Bone, the demonic beast instantly grew listless.

“Die!”

The elder who was igniting his own life energy suddenly swung his sword, and his opponent didn’t even have the ability to resist. He was blown apart. A Supreme expert who lost their Supreme Bone had essentially lost half of their life. He could only watch as death descended upon him.

The other two Divine Lords were horrified. Their Blood Qi erupted, and they immediately turned to flee. Seeing this, those World Kings tried to stop them but were unable to block them.

The two Divine Lords transformed into their true forms. They were both scaled eagles. Their wings shook, and they immediately appeared far into the distance.

Suddenly, a saber-image descended from the heavens, turning those two giant figures instantly into dust.

When people looked back, they saw Long Chen slowly sheathing his saber as if he had just done something completely insignificant.

This saber attack of his was silent and came without any warning. By the time they reacted, it was already over.

“Many thanks for saving us. My Luo tribe will be forever grateful.” The half-step Divine Venerate cupped his fists to Long Chen.

If it weren’t for Long Chen, even if he threw away this life of his, it was unknown if he could defeat this Supreme expert. If he lost, then all his people behind him would also die miserable deaths.

“The Luo tribe?”[1]

Long Chen was about to say some courteous words when he heard the elder say that they were from the Luo tribe. He suddenly had a thought and looked at the fallen expert. Waving his hand, drops of fresh blood flew into his hand. Looking at this fresh blood, he saw the slightest trace of violet qi. He was shocked.

When they saw this expression, these people’s expressions all changed. They clenched their weapons nervously.

Even the half-step Divine Venerate’s expression changed. Although he did his best to keep his expression a bit more natural, he was unable to cover up his panic.

“You’re from the Violet Blood race? Not bad.”

The elder sighed inside when he saw that Long Chen recognized their status. Quibbling was meaningless. He could only admit to it.

“You don’t need to be nervous. Technically, I am also from the Violet Blood race. I suppose that I’ve encountered my own people today,” said Long Chen with a slight smile.

Despite Long Chen saying this, the people in front of him remained extremely vigilant against him.

“Your bloodline has almost regressed to the point of vanishing. If this continues, it won’t be more than three generations before you completely lose the inheritance of the Violet Blood race. All Divine Lord disciples, come out!” shouted Long Chen to the city.

Those people looked at Long Chen and then at the elder. The elder was also nervous. He couldn’t sense the slightest violet blood energy in Long Chen’s body. However, Long Chen was able to cut off the Supreme Bone of a Supreme expert and slay the other two in one attack. It was clearly easy for him to kill all of them if he so wished.

The elder nodded to those people. Over three hundred Divine Lords walked out of the ruined city.Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

Long Chen then plucked a lot of Heavenly Dao Fruit from the Heavenly Dao Tree and distributed them.

These disciples didn’t quite dare to eat them, and when they looked at the elder, they saw that he also had a distrusting expression. He didn’t know if he should have the disciples eat them or not.

When Long Chen handed the fruit to a young maiden, seeing her terror, Long Chen couldn’t help rubbing her head comfortingly. “Don’t be afraid. Big brother is helping you.”

This smile was quite infectious. This young maiden actually obediently nodded and directly consumed the fruit. As a result, the others all jumped.

She had just eaten the fruit when her Blood Qi appeared around her body, forming a faint violet qi aura. When this violet qi appeared, everyone was filled with disbelief.

“Violet qi revival! Her violet qi has awoken!”

The half-step Divine Venerate was overjoyed. He stared at her in disbelief.

Long Chen also continued to look at her. Regretfully, no violet runes appeared in her eyes, so it could only be said that her violet blood was too sparse. Even the Heavenly Dao Fruit was only able to help her to this extent.

After seeing her change, the other disciples also consumed the Heavenly Dao Fruit. Every single one of them became surrounded by violet qi. At this moment, the Luo tribe’s experts were filled with disbelief. They felt like they were dreaming.

“Senior, can we talk?” The half-step Divine Venerate suddenly bowed to Long Chen respectfully.
