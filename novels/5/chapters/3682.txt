Chapter 3671

When the lightning spear appeared, this entire space became a lightning sea. Chen Ming was shocked. He was instantly locked down by this lightning sea.

“So you’re the one who stole the lightning sea!”

Chen Ming was shocked and enraged. He finally understood that the lightning sea’s disappearance and the destruction of the Star Peering Heavenly Mirror were done entirely by Long Chen.

“Palace master, bestow upon me your divine protection! Protect your most loyal servant!”

Chen Ming howled and swept his sword out. Faith energy gathered, forming a white battle armor around his body. This battle armor was made entirely out of faith energy.

BOOM!

Touching it, Lei Linger’s spear quivered and countless lightning runes exploded. Chen Ming then screamed as his arms were blown apart. His sword went flying.

But surprisingly, the faith battle armor that he was wearing was completely undamaged. Just as he said, only another faith energy could destroy this faith energy. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

Of course, just because the battle armor was fine didn’t mean that the wearer was fine. He was seriously injured inside the battle armor. He hacked up three mouthfuls of blood that contained fragments of his insides. Clearly, this armor composed of faith energy was not capable of fully blocking Lei Linger’s power.

After Lei Linger’s attack, Guo Ran’s fist smashed into Chen Ming’s back. Chen Ming then grunted. His spine was broken and his body curled, the back of his head almost touching his ankle.

The next moment, Chen Ming let out a miserable shriek. Perhaps it was because Guo Ran had struck him in some weak spot, or perhaps the power of the Supreme Bone was invading his body. In any case, he seemed to be in unbearable pain. After receiving consecutive serious wounds, the divine statue that he had summoned began to fluctuate, occasionally growing dim. Its aura was unstable.

“Keep beating him up, and Liao Bencang can’t descend! Attack fast, not powerfully!” shouted Xia Chen. He flung out a Heaven Shaking Talisman, and it exploded on Chen Ming’s body.

Lei Linger, Guo Ran, and Xia Chen repeatedly attacked. Although Chen Ming had his protective armor, he was unable to stop their attacks. The three of them didn’t give him any breathing room.

Chen Ming was hacking up blood, not having any power to retaliate. As for the countless assassins of the Nine Underworld Island, they were all dead. He was the only one to survive thanks to his faith energy. He had no helpers.

“Just wait… when the palace master descends… all of you will die miserable deaths!”

Under the crazy assault from Guo Ran and the others, Chen Ming could only let himself be beaten. He had no room to retaliate or flee.

Right now, he was entirely relying on his protective faith armor to survive. He was also igniting his longevity just to hold on. But even then, he wouldn’t be able to last.

Unfortunately, he couldn’t do anything else. If he did let Long Chen and the others leave, he would still die a miserable death. It just wouldn’t be at the hands of Long Chen and the others. Hence, he had to stop them.

As Lei Linger, Guo Ran, and Xia Chen attacked Chen Ming. Long Chen activated the seven-color divine ring, focusing on recovering as quickly as possible.

Faith energy was an ephemeral kind of energy. Even if Long Chen joined in, it would be meaningless. It was enough for the three of them to stall Chen Ming.

When an incense stick’s worth of time passed, Long Chen’s body was fully recovered. Before the breakthrough, such wounds would take at least a few days to heal. But after the Violet Tower Star appeared, the seven-color divine ring was able to grasp the power of heaven and earth to heal his body. Adding on the primal chaos space’s healing powers, he rapidly recovered.

The primal chaos space healed his physical body, while the outer world’s energy helped him repair the damage to his soul and mind. Thanks to both aspects, his recovery speed was astonishing.

Guo Ran, Xia Chen, and Lei Linger were still crazily attacking Chen Ming. After fighting for so long, they found that this faith armor was able to absorb and reflect a portion of their power. But at the same time, there was another portion that injured Chen Ming who was inside the armor.

A stronger attack wasn’t very useful. After a certain limit, the damage was capped and any further power was wasted. Hence, the three of them maintained a rapid attack pace.

Chen Ming was already at his limit at this time. He originally looked to be forty, but now his hair had turned white, and his face was covered in wrinkles. His Blood Qi also withered, signs that the fire of his soul was about to extinguish.

However, he was tenacious. He ended up attaching a part of his Spiritual Strength to the divine statue. By extracting that bit of Spiritual Strength slowly, he was able to just barely endure.

At this moment, Long Chen charged into the sky with his dagger and cut the streams of white light coming out of the sea. The dagger quivered. This net of light seemed to be like cotton, and it was impossible to cut through it. It simply bent.

As expected, there was nothing in this world that was absolutely unrivaled. At the very least, this dagger was unable to damage this net of faith. Faith was truly a mysterious thing. Even Long Chen was unable to explain this kind of power.

BANG!

Guo Ran’s fist smashed into Chen Ming’s body. However, this time, it didn’t cause any explosive sound. Instead, it let out a muffled grunt.

BOOM!

Chen Ming along with his faith armor exploded. Guo Ran and Xia Chen cheered. With Chen Ming’s death, the statue and heavenly net would vanish.

This was Xia Chen and Guo Ran’s first time encountering faith energy, and they hadn’t expected it to be so powerful. A late stage World King servant had managed to exhaust them just to kill him. If it was Liao Bencang instead, just how powerful would he be?

Just then, even as Chen Ming died, the divine statue was lighting up. Cracks covered it.

“Haha, success!” Xia Chen and Guo Ran both thought that it was about to shatter. However, the scene that they were expecting never occurred. The statue’s surface began to fall off chunk by chunk, and it began to reveal a figure beneath it.

“Starry Sea Births Violet Qi!”

Long Chen shouted and instantly shot through the air, slashing the Minghong Saber at the statue. He didn’t even have time to communicate with Xia Chen and Guo Ran.

BOOM!

Long Chen’s saber landed right on the statue’s head. After that, fragments of the statue flew out in every direction.

Xia Chen and Guo Ran’s expressions suddenly changed. Even as the fragments flew out, they saw a hand grab the Minghong Saber.

They then saw a figure. When they saw his face, the two of them cried out in shock.

“Liao Bencang!”

Liao Bencang still managed to arrive somehow. However, he couldn’t arrive in time to save Chen Ming.

A divine radiance shone behind Liao Bencang’s head, and the world’s faith energy prostrated itself toward him. He seemed to be the ruler of this world, an existence that no one could even think of defying.

Right now, Liao Bencang’s expression was ashen and his gaze was locked onto Long Chen hatefully. His killing intent rose. “You little bastards, you dare to destroy my Star Peering Heavenly Mirror and kill my followers. Today, I will make you beg for death.”

Rumbling rang out and a giant figure slowly rose out of the sea.
