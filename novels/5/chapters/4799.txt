Chapter 4788 Protector Divine Beast

What Long Zhantian tossed out initially fit in his palm, but as it left his hand, it swelled to the size of a mountain. The object then crashed into the ground, rolling a bit before coming to a stop. At this moment, everyone saw what it was.

At the sight of it, killing intent exploded out of the Celestial race’s Heaven Saint.

“Long Zhantian, you’ve gone too far!” Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

He was quivering with so much rage that his voice became hoarse. This object was a head, precisely an enormous fox’s head with gleaming sharp teeth. Though lifeless, its eyes still gave off an ominous air, causing Long Chen’s soul to tremble as if under its gaze. Cold sweat dripped down his back.

Although it was just a head, its presence instilled terror in everyone’s heart. Its aura appeared no less formidable than that of the Heaven Saint.

“Isn’t that... the Celestial race’s divine beast protector, the Heavenly Demon Divine Fox?!”

“What?! Isn’t it a Heaven Saint?!”

“A Heaven Saint divine beast is dead? How?”

People stared at Long Zhantian, as well as Long Chen. This father-son pair was absolutely terrifying.

Long Chen had swept through the crowd, slaying Mortal Saints and Earth Saints and then smashing apart the weapon of a Heaven Saint. Just how domineering was that?

Meanwhile, his father had managed to scare off a Heaven Saint and even tossed out the head of a Heaven Saint divine beast. These two men were constantly challenging the scopes of people’s imagination.

“Little Nine, are you angry?” probed Bai Xiaole upon seeing the fox head.

Little Nine crossed its arms in front of its chest. With a hint of disdain in its tone, it replied, “What does it have to do with me? The fox race is huge, and the Heavenly Demon Divine Fox race has nothing to do with the Violet Pupil Nine Tail Fox race.”

Bai Xiaole relaxed a bit upon hearing that.

“I’m going too far? You guys were the ones who sent it to track me. While people may say that Heavenly Demon Divine Fox’s aura-concealing arts are one of the best in the nine heavens, do you really believe it’s undetectable?” stated Long Zhantian indifferently.

“If you were willing to let it secretly track me, you should be prepared for the consequences. Actually, you should thank me. At the very least, I’m giving you back its head.”

The Heaven Saint swiftly waved his hand and grabbed the head, his expression dark. He demanded, “Where is its crystal core?!”

“Aren’t you being too childish? Giving you the head is me being generous. Now you want the crystal core as well? Don’t you think it’s ridiculous?” Long Zhantian was speechless.

The Heaven Saint seethed with rage over the lost crystal core, yet beneath the anger, there was an obvious hint of fear and unease.

This Heavenly Demon Divine Fox was one of the Celestial race’s four divine beast protectors. These beings remained shrouded in secrecy, their existence known only through whispers and legends, never confirmed by sight.

Amongst the four of them, the Heavenly Demon Divine Fox possessed a unique divine ability to conceal its aura, and it was also proficient in soul arts. It had once helped the Celestial race assassinate over ten Heaven Saints successfully. It was said that its victims never saw it or sensed its approach before their demise.

In essence, the Heavenly Demon Divine Fox was the Celestial race's secret trump card.

The Celestial race had decided that Long Chen had to die ever since he killed Luo Changsheng in the Void Spirit World. After researching for a bit, they found that he was the son of the Long clan’s fourth Heavenly Sage, so they immediately decided that Long Zhantian had to die as well.

However, Long Zhantian had caused an uproar as soon as he entered the Long clan. Relying on his broadsword, he slaughtered his way to become one of the Heavenly Sages. The Celestial race was also rather afraid of him.

Because of this, despite wanting him dead, they were extremely cautious. They needed a detailed plan before making any moves. Thus, they sent the Heavenly Demon Divine Fox that was specialized in hiding its aura to trail him.

The Celestial was always cautious. Before assassinating someone, they would always figure out their target’s trump cards. Before being fully confident, they wouldn’t make a move.

Just yesterday, the Heavenly Demon Divine Fox sent back word that Long Zhantian had left the Long clan and entered the chaos region.

It was due to this that the Celestial race had dared to attack Long Chen so brazenly, but now a clone of Long Zhantian appeared with the Heavenly Demon Divine Fox’s head. This was an unacceptable result for the Celestial race.

The demon race had demon cores and crystal cores. While the Heavenly Demon Divine Fox’s demon core was a condensation of its life’s energy and was of incalculable value, it wasn’t the most important thing to the Celestial race.

The most important thing was the crystal core, which contained its divine ability runes and its memories. In other words, contained within were the Celestial race’s most important secrets.

Although the Heavenly Daos would take back most of the divine energy of a Heaven Saint when they died, resulting in those memories crumbling, some special secret arts were capable of reconstructing them through the broken fragments, and that was what the Celestial race was most afraid of.

If their secrets were exposed, then it might lead to the extinction of the entire Celestial race. That was why this Heaven Saint’s expression was so shitty.

“Don’t worry, I’m not interested in the Celestial race’s secrets, nor do I have time to study that crystal core. I already fed both cores to my steed,” said Long Zhantian indifferently.

“Do you think I’ll believe your lies?!” shouted the Celestial race’s Heaven Saint.

“If you don’t believe me, that’s your problem. If I cut off your head and give it to the others in the Celestial race, perhaps they’ll believe me,” replied Long Zhantian with a slight smile.

“You...!” The Heaven Saint roared, “You’re nothing more than a clone! Do you think that you can be arrogant?!”

“I believe I can!”

All of a sudden, Long Zhantian took a single step forward and appeared right in front of the Heaven Saint, his finger pointing at the Heaven Saint’s head.
