Chapter 4435 I’m Your Daddy

This elder was the race leader of the nether dragons and also their strongest expert, wielding absolute authority within their race.

His voice was filled with power and unquestionable might, causing the hearts of countless experts to tremble as it reverberated. A wave of dizziness swept over them, nearly compelling them to kneel.

This was the might of a Saint. As the difference in power was too great, it sparked something like an innate subservience in the hearts of the weaker experts.

Even Eternal experts found themselves affected by this pressure. His voice filled their minds, stirring a desire from the depths of their souls to revere him.

However, in front of this almighty expert, Long Chen simply sneered. This old bastard already knew the answer to this question, so why bother asking?

Long Chen had killed his son, but he acted like he didn’t recognize Long Chen? Long Chen actually shook his head.

“I’m not Long Chen. I’m your daddy.”

This audacious retort left everyone stunned. Long Chen’s arrogance was really off the chart.

Even in front of a terrifying Saint, he dared to be so brazen. Did he not value his life any longer? With a single thought, this elder could reduce him to ashes.

Long Chen’s response injected an unexpected twist into the tense atmosphere. Countless experts were taken aback, and while some found it amusing, no one dared to laugh. In an instant, the nether dragon race leader’s expression visibly darkened.

“Ignorant brat, do you know who you are speaking to? Even the Dean of your High Firmament Academy wouldn’t dare to speak to this Saint like that!” shouted the nether dragon race’s leader.

“I am a Dean of the High Firmament Academy, and I’m speaking to you like this, am I not? Is there a problem? This is a battle between me and Netherdragon Tianzhao. What are you doing here? Do you teach seniors beating up juniors in your family? If I beat Netherdragon Tianzhao, will you take his place? What if I beat you too? Will your dad come out of his grave?” asked Long Chen lightly.

“Shut your mouth, you dumb brat!” the nether dragon race leader roared.

Following his roar, the void exploded and countless spatial fragments flew about. His projected soundwave then surged toward Long Chen.

Long Chen’s hair and clothes billowed backward, but he stood unwavering, not even batting an eye. He just stared at the nether dragon race leader coldly.

On the other hand, the soundwave blasted through the ears of Guo Ran and the others, piercing their souls. Its violent pressure attacked their wills, trying to force them to submit.

Luckily, every warrior in the Dragonblood Legion possessed a powerful will. Even as this soundwave tried to bend them, they stood tall like immobile mountains.

This one roar contained no physical attack, purely filled with an explosion of the will. As a result, those with weaker wills were directly compelled to submit. This was the overwhelming pressure of a Saint.𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

A Saint’s will was formless yet strong enough to make the Heavenly Daos collapse. However, it was unable to shake Long Chen’s iron will.

The soundwave passed through this entire area, causing the surrounding experts to cover their ears in agony.

People with weaker wills couldn’t help but kneel to alleviate the pain. After all, submitting would make the nether dragon race leader’s will stop attacking them.

Tens of thousands of experts directly dropped to their knees. While they were excellent figures with immense power within the junior generation, raw talent alone couldn’t turn them into true experts. They just had not suffered enough setbacks in this lifetime to temper their wills.

These experts were pale and embarrassed, wanting to find a hole to hide in. This one roar had stripped them of their dignity. Now, they even felt like they didn’t have the qualifications to continue watching from here.

This earth-shattering roar was felt by all of them. Therefore, when they observed Long Chen’s indifferent demeanor, they were especially astonished. After all, the primary focus of this soundwave had been on him. By the time it reached those on the outer edges, its intensity had already diminished. Yet, even budding Doyens were left with splitting headaches.

Based on that, Long Chen’s will had to be terrifyingly powerful. Furthermore, he wasn’t the only one. As the onlookers glanced at the Dragonblood Legion, there was a new hint of horror in their eyes.

Amongst the Dragonblood Legion, only one seemed somewhat affected—Little Crane. She now had a tense expression and was cradled by one of the maidens of the rainbow crane race.

Unaffected by this roar, the three maidens were calmly standing at the rear.

“Reality tells us that powerful throats are useless. Otherwise, donkeys would rule the world.” Long Chen shrugged.

“You…!” The nether dragon race leader seemed on the verge of spitting up blood upon hearing this audacious insult. His powerful roar had failed to subdue Long Chen, and he was insulted instead.

“Brat, I’m only talking so nicely to you due to your great talent. Although you accidentally killed my son, if you turn over a new leaf and sincerely swear loyalty to my nether dragon race, I am willing to give you a new chance.”

Hearing this offer, numerous people were shocked. When did the nether dragon race become so easy to talk to? The race leader’s son had been slain, and yet he was still willing to compromise?

“What do you mean, a new chance? I haven’t missed any chances. As for turning over a new leaf… did you have a concussion? It was no accident that I killed Netherdragon Tianye. I acted with a clear purpose. Furthermore, your entire nether dragon race will accompany him soon, so you don’t need to waste your saliva,” responded Long Chen with indifference.

Gasps resounded amongst the crowd. Was he out of his mind?

To openly declare his intention to annihilate the entire nether dragon race—such audacity! In the minds of the onlookers, even the High Firmament Academy wouldn't dare utter such words, so Long Chen had to be insane.

Just how powerful was the nether dragon race? Their genius was the world’s first publicly acclaimed awakened Doyen, and this showed that their race’s karmic luck had also awakened. Their future was filled with prosperity.

However, Long Chen, a little World King, actually dared to challenge such a formidable power? Despite being surrounded by numerous halos of light, Long Chen still seemed like a praying mantis attempting to halt a carriage.

“Since I gave you a chance and you won’t cherish it, fine. I have a question for you. What’s the origin of your dragon blood?” The race leader’s expression suddenly grew sinister.
