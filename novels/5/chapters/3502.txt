Chapter 3491

Lightning and flames mixed to form a violet-red lotus. That lotus then exploded as soon as it appeared.

Although Long Chen fled the core instantly, his golden dragon scales were still blasted apart by that terrifying power. He was left a bloody pulp.

Lightning Flames Devour the Heavens. This was a new ultimate move that Long Chen had just started researching. It was based on the same principle as Double Dragon Destruction. However, this time, he was mixing the World Extermination Flame Lotus and the World Extermination Lightning Radiance.

However, even if Lei Linger and Huo Linger were familiar with each other, and they both possessed the destructive aspect in ample amounts, their elements were completely different. Long Chen couldn’t merge them in an attack.

Before this, the Double Dragon Destruction had both of their powers erupt right at the last moment. The power was great, but it was entirely a simple addition of one plus one being two.

However, Long Chen found that if he could use his own power to merge both of their energies, then even if it was just a temporary balance, such an attack would unleash many times the power of the Double Dragon Destruction.

He had yet to fully research this technique and wasn’t able to fully control it. However, in front of so many World Kings, his fury made him not care about all that. He directly unleashed the Lightning Flames Devour the Heavens.

As a result, divine light devoured the heavens, while endless flames and lightning weaved together. People saw a giant lotus spread, devouring everyone on the battlefield.

Long Chen was blasted out like a shooting star. All his scales were destroyed, and his body was a bloody mess.

As for the other World Kings, they didn’t have bodies as powerful as Long Chen’s. Their physical bodies were instantly destroyed, leaving behind only their Yuan Spirits.

That dark-faced World King also hacked up blood. Although his armor had protected his life, its runes had fully dimmed. Even this priceless battle armor was badly damaged.

Of over a hundred World Kings, only the dark-faced third Heavenstage World King survived with his physical body intact. The others were left with only their Yuan Spirits floating in the air.

Everyone was stupefied. Just how was a little Divine Lord capable of unleashing such terrifying power?

At this moment, Long Chen felt like his body would collapse. His bones were covered in cracks, and pain came from every part of him. Due to not being able to control the power, Long Chen had endured essentially the same amount of force as that third Heavenstage World King.

However, in just an instant, his physical body healed and the broken golden scales appeared once more.

“What?!”

Seeing that Long Chen’s body went from being on the verge of collapse to fully healed in an instant, everyone was shocked. Such terrifying wounds were instantly healed? Did he possess an undying body?

Long Chen took a deep breath. Now, he sensed that he didn’t even have half of his spiritual yuan after that attack. Furthermore, his 108,000 stars had used up quite a bit of energy to resist the backlash. Overall, his current power was around forty percent of his peak.

Long Chen suddenly stamped in the air, shooting toward that third Heavenstage World King like a bolt of lightning. His saber slashed down.

“He can still fight?!”

Startled cries rang out. Even after unleashing such a terrifying attack and suffering such terrible wounds, his attacks were still so sharp. That berserk will of his hadn’t weakened in the slightest.

BOOM!

That third Heavenstage World King couldn’t dodge. As a result, he raised his arms to receive Long Chen’s attack, and the armor on his arms finally reached its limit and broke apart. His arms were left a bloody pulp.

Long Chen’s qi and blood flipped inside of him, but his killing intent did not diminish. He continued to lock onto that third Heavenstage World King, seemingly unwilling to stop until the other party was dead.

As for the other World Kings, they only had their Yuan Spirits. Although Yuan Spirits could still fight, they were terrified. If their fragile Yuan Spirits were also destroyed, they would truly be dead. Long Chen’s attack had not just destroyed their physical bodies, but it had also destroyed their confidence.

The third Heavenstage World King, with his armor destroyed, had his expression completely change. Contrary to other World Kings, his cultivation base was connected to his armor. Having lost his battle armor, he was like a tiger that had just lost its teeth.

He suddenly spat out a mouthful of blood into his hand. After forming a seal in the air, his body transformed into a blood-colored streak of light that fled away.

“Blood evasion art?! He ran away?!” Inconceivable expressions appeared on many people’s faces. A grand third Heavenstage World King, an overlord existence of the Evergreen Prefecture, had actually used the blood evasion art to flee? This signified that he had been defeated by a Divine Lord!

“So what if you use blood evasion? Can you run faster than me?” Long Chen sneered. Although he was also spent, he believed he could last longer. Furthermore, in terms of speed, it was nothing difficult to catch up to the elder.

Just as lightning wings appeared on his back and he prepared to chase, his expression changed. His wings then flapped, and he transformed into a Lightning Falcon that fled in the opposite direction. He had also run.

For a moment, everyone was simply dumbfounded. What was going on?

Just as they were stunned, the void rumbled. Spatial gates then appeared one after another. Countless figures showed up. Those people all had powerful auras, and there were even two more third Heavenstage World Kings.

Now everyone understood. This black-robed youngster had definitely sensed something, which was why he had fled.

Although he had fled, no one looked down on him. Instead, they felt even greater admiration for him due to his sharp senses. He had exhausted himself. If he still didn’t flee, he would simply be a fool.

When these World Kings arrived and saw the destroyed Soaring Dragon Company, their expressions sank. Fury exploded out of them. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

Just then, the dark-faced World King who had used blood evasion to flee returned. His face was already dark originally, but now it was even darker.

If he hadn’t fled and had lasted another breath’s time, perhaps they would have been able to capture that black-robed youth together.

However, by fleeing, it was like he was telling everyone here that he had lost. He had lost all his face, as well as caused failure this time. He was so furious that his eyes turned green with rage.

“Senior Yu Shu, what happened here?!”

Both of the third Heavenstage World Kings that had just arrived felt a mix of shock and fury. Just how glorious was the Soaring Dragon Company? Who dared to provoke them like this?

“Senior Yu Shu, what power was the other side from? How many people did they bring?” asked the other World King. Based on his estimate, some power must have come out in full force to be able to cause such destruction.

“Uh…”

The dark-faced elder was speechless. He couldn’t say that this was all done by a young Divine Lord. Although he knew that they would learn of it sooner or later, as there were countless eyes that had witnessed it, he still couldn’t bring himself to say it with his own mouth.

“I’ll explain it in detail to you when we get back. Inform the higher-ups! Release a bounty for the capture of… What did that little fellow call himself?” asked the dark-faced elder.

One of the World Kings beside him who only had a Yuan Spirit left hastily said, “He called himself Boss Long San.”

“Yes! Announce a bounty for Boss Long San!” shouted that dark-faced World King through clenched teeth.

As a result, the name of Boss Long San quickly spread throughout every corner of the Violet Flame Heaven.
