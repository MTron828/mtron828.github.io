Chapter 3751 Speak With Power

Upon entering the city, Long Chen saw countless fearful gazes looking at him. No one dared to challenge him again, and they all distanced themselves from him.

Wherever Long Chen went, people fled. Long Chen was like a demon spreading disease. No one dared to even get somewhat close to him.

In truth, they weren’t afraid of Long Chen. They were afraid of the one behind him. Bing Po had terrified everyone.

Although Bing Po had her core energy extracted for millions and millions of years, she was still the Ice Soul Divine Flame, an existence that ranked eighth on the Heavenly Flame Ranking. At her peak, a single thought could destroy heaven and earth. The haughtiness that stemmed from deep within her soul was enough to suppress everyone.

As long as a Divine Venerate didn’t attack, no one would be able to tell that it was a bluff. As for those young heavenly geniuses, they didn’t even dare to look at her. In all his years of fighting, it was Long Chen’s first time being able to rely on such a powerful backer to terrify everyone around him.

However, Long Chen’s expression remained ugly. It looked like he was about to start killing at any moment.

The arrival of Bing Po shook everyone. Even Divine Venerates didn’t dare to attack Long Chen, let alone the others.

Once Long Chen entered Seven Star City, over ten gazes locked onto Bing Po. Those people were all Divine Venerates, but even they had fearful expressions.

Seeing that Long Chen wasn’t doing anything extreme, they just hid in the dark. Amongst these Divine Venerates, the human ones felt the most uneasy, afraid that Long Chen would cause a ruckus here and start killing. Then this city would be destroyed.

However, they felt blessed that while Long Chen’s expression was frighteningly dark, nothing crazy happened. Countless experts secretly implored their disciples not to provoke him.

“Why are you so angry?” asked Bing Po.

“Because these people have forgotten history. They’ve forgotten the human race’s enmity, how our ancestors died miserable deaths. Now, they’re colluding with the people who killed their ancestors, fawning over them, practically being servants. How can I not be enraged?” demanded Long Chen.

Long Chen firmly believed that what he had seen in the Violet Flame Heaven was all true. That had been a glance into history.

Furthermore, on the Martial Heaven Continent, Long Chen had also suffered the oppression and killing of the devil race, Blood race, beast race, Corrupt path, and other powers. The human race’s history was a humiliating history of blood.

Thus, Long Chen particularly hated those races. And yet, the most hateful thing in this world was traitors.

Although Long Chen had seen many traitors of the human race, when Long Chen entered the three thousand worlds, his hatred grew even more intense. He had a strong urge to kill all of them.

Regretfully, his power was limited. It wasn’t enough to defeat Divine Venerates. Otherwise, he would have destroyed Seven Star City.

“This is the strong point of your human race, as well as the weak point. Other races have their ancient enmities carved into their bones, into their souls. But your human race’s memories are not inherited. You need to study your past to learn it. The good thing is that you don’t have to live with the heavy burden of ancient enmities. That makes life a bit easier, a bit happier. But the bad thing is that once the scar heals, history constantly replays in a cycle. It’s as if the human race can never break free from this cycle. That is the fatal weakness of your human race. As long as this cycle isn’t broken, your human race will always remain below average amongst the ten thousand races. It doesn’t matter how strong or glorious your human race once was. It doesn’t matter what kind of height you once stood at. Without breaking this cycle, any glorious era is nothing more than a flash that cannot last. After the battle of the immemorial era, the human race fully declined. You not only lost your faith but also your dignity. In the current era, there are not many hearts with self-respect. If you want to find the human race’s dignity again, it will be difficult, very difficult,” said Bing Po calmly.

“Difficult isn’t impossible. Accomplishing something difficult is to be treasured. As long as I don’t die, I will break these rules of the world and create a world that I want,” said Long Chen with firm determination.

“Why are you so attached to this?” asked Bing Po.

Long Chen suddenly paused and looked at Bing Po, staring into her eyes.

“If I have never seen the light, I would be able to endure living in the dark. But now that I’ve seen it, I can no longer tolerate this world’s chaos. Once the entire world is dark, a speck of light is a blasphemy. In the past, I’ve also asked myself about it. Why do I not fit into this world? Am I the one that is wrong, or is it this world that is wrong? My inner heart was split, entering a state of self-question. Fortunately, I encountered Aunt Gong. She made my heart stable and solid. She bestowed the golden lotus on me, illuminating my path forward. I now understand that I am not wrong. The world is not wrong either. If neither of us is wrong, then the only thing to do is to use power to speak.”

Bing Po looked into Long Chen’s eyes. Those gemstone-like eyes of his rippled ever so slightly. She then nodded and didn’t reply.

It was unknown if she agreed with Long Chen or simply felt that he deserved praise for his bravery. It was an unfathomable feeling.

Once Long Chen was in the city, quite a few people hid themselves in fear. However, seeing that Long Chen did not seem to wish for trouble despite his dark expression, people gradually calmed down. The city once more settled down and grew lively.

Long Chen arrived at the center of the city. This was the marketplace. Since no one dared to attack Long Chen, Bing Po returned to the primal chaos space. She was worried that someone would notice a clue if she stayed out too long.

Seven Star City was large. The native experts and the experts from outside gathered here. Hence, there were many treasures that could be bought here.

However, people were mostly trading items here. They rarely used money. They simply used anything they didn’t need to trade for things that they did need.

Long Chen used some medicinal pills to trade for fire attribute spirit stones to help Bing Po recover. For Bing Po to help him out by scaring off a group of Divine Venerates, Long Chen naturally couldn’t let her lose out. He bought some ores to compensate her.

Regretfully, there weren’t that many fire attribute treasures available. While Long Chen’s medicinal pills were very rare treasures that made many people greedy, other than fire attribute treasures, Long Chen didn’t want anything that they had.

Long Chen bought a few more maps. They were around the same as the map that the Luo tribe had given him. However, the Luo tribe’s map could be considered older. Some markers were no longer accurate, and some territories had changed hands. There were also more taboo areas.

Long Chen then paid hundreds of thousands of immortal king crystals to get a complete set of information, which contained news of the major powers of the three thousand worlds. It told him their power level, how many experts they had, and the strengths and weaknesses of their heavenly geniuses. This way, Long Chen would have at least some understanding of the three thousand worlds. A few hundred thousand immortal king crystals was definitely worth it.

BOOM!

Suddenly, an explosion came from outside the city. Everyone was startled.

“People are fighting again?!”

The people in the city rushed out, including Long Chen. He saw around eighty corpses on the ground, as well as a long-haired man whose sword was stained with blood. Killing intent erupted from his eyes, and lightning runes revolved around his body.

When Long Chen saw this man, he was overjoyed.Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates
