Chapter 2630 Depths of the Devil Sea

The Horned King’s expression didn’t even twitch after being slapped by Long Chen.

Long Chen nodded. Meng Qi’s soul arts were truly amazing. The Horned King’s soul was now under his control.

“Big sister Meng Qi really is amazing,” Dong Mingyu couldn’t help praising.

Most importantly, Meng Qi had never had a master to guide her. She had relied on her own power and comprehension, gathering ancient tomes and advancing step by step to her current height. There was no particularly powerful expert on the Martial Heaven Continent skilled in soul arts that could teach her. Hence, she could be considered a true genius.

“Mingyu, you don’t need that body any longer. Hide yourself in the void and just follow behind me,” said Long Chen.

Dong Mingyu nodded and returned to her normal appearance. Activating her concealing arts, she vanished.

The Horned King suddenly smashed his hand onto Dong Mingyu’s disguise, destroying it. “What treasure?! You dare to cheat me?!” Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Your majesty, spare me! This truly is a treasure!” cried out Long Chen.

“Shut up! If it weren’t for the information that you brought back and that you still have some use, I’d have killed you as well!” shouted the Horned King.

In truth, Long Chen was just shouting like this for the two guards to hear.

After that, the Horned King furiously charged out. The two guards were silent out of fear.

“You two, clean up my cave,” barked the Horned King.

The two guards immediately ran in to gather the destroyed body. This way, there was no mistake with how three of them had turned into two.

Controlling the Horned King, they quickly descended the island. Originally, Long Chen had wanted to sneak his way into the core of the devil race, but upon learning how many powerful existences they had, he decided against it.

From the Horned King’s memories, Long Chen now knew that this black sea had the entrance to the devil world. The entrance was at the bottom of the sea.

The devil world’s aura was constantly entering from there, and this was what aided their cultivation. At the same time, this black sea emitted the devil world’s laws, allowing those laws to enter the Martial Heaven Continent.

This Horned King’s power was not equal to that of Long Aotian, Feng Fei, and the others. However, he was only a tiny bit weaker. He could be considered an expert on that level.

However, even he was nothing more than one of the Alldevil Heavenwalker’s Kings, similar to the Blood Fiend Devil Lord’s eight guards. They were all peak geniuses but suppressed by one person. The light from the Blood Fiend Devil Lord and the Alldevil Heavenwalker was so great that even geniuses like them lost their splendor in front of the two of them.

Even though they were subordinates, they still had high positions, so they knew some important secrets. Hence, Long Chen was bringing the Horned King to one of those secret spots.

The transportation formation activated and Long Chen arrived at the peak of a mountain. Long Chen was familiar with this place. This was where he, Chang Hao, and Bao Buping had come to last time.

There were many divine items chained here. At this moment, Long Chen arrived at the place where the Heaven Splitting Divine Tablet had been, but it was already gone.

“Based on the aura, the chain was broken a long time ago. The Heaven Splitting Divine Tablet escaped its bindings not long after we left back then. But why hasn’t it returned?” Long Chen looked at the chain, muttering to himself as he saw the dim runes and accumulated dust.

“Did the Heaven Splitting Divine Tablet notice something and choose to stay behind?” wondered Dong Mingyu.

Long Chen nodded. “That sounds like the most likely possibility. The Heaven Splitting Divine Tablet knows how much the Heaven Splitting Battle Sect needs it, so it must have a reason for not returning.”

There were no signs of battle. It seemed that the Heaven Splitting Divine Tablet really had escaped stealthily. That was one weight off of his shoulders.

However, where had it gone? Now, Long Chen had no choice but to slip away, returning to the devil sea.

Using the Horned King’s status, he used the transportation formation and arrived at the bottom of the devil sea. He had the Horned King get rid of a few guards before he reached the depths.

Although the Horned King’s status was high, this region was forbidden to him, so even he wasn’t permitted down. It seemed that the devil race had many secrets here. However, they only had a few guards warning people away because it had been tens of thousands of years since anyone had dared to enter this region.

Long Chen and the Horned King descended deeper. At this moment, Long Chen started to regret it. The devil qi here was too strong, so Dong Mingyu was unable to stay concealed. Moreover, the disguise had been destroyed, and making a new one would take too long.

Right now, darkness stretched around them. The water was condensed from pure devil qi, and it matched this place that was like a bottomless abyss. Everything was deathly silent as if they would keep sinking forever.

“Big brother Long Chen, are you going to sneak into the devil world?” asked Dong Mingyu.

“Yes, I want to take a look. It would be best if we could shut the opening. Although there’s not much of a chance, I feel unwilling to leave without taking a look,” replied Long Chen.

Even the Horned King could not be sure that the entrance to the devil world was at the bottom of this devil sea because he had been born on Devil Spirit Mountain. It was just a legend.

Long Chen knew nothing about the devil world, so he was very curious.

“Oh? There’s a chain.” Dong Mingyu suddenly pointed. They could vaguely see something within the darkness.

Long Chen switched to the Horned King’s vision. Only then was he vaguely able to see a chain-like entity.

“Mingyu, how can you see so far?” asked Long Chen.

“It wasn’t my sight. I felt it. The chain has a strong murderous aura,” explained Dong Mingyu.

Long Chen moved closer, eventually seeing that it was a gigantic chain with runes twinkling on it. As he got closer, he also sensed the strong murderous aura.

Suddenly, the bronze fragment in the primal chaos space shuddered, as if resonating.

“Long Chen, is it you?”

Just at this moment, a voice rang out in the depths of his soul, making Long Chen jump. That was the voice of the Heaven Splitting Divine Tablet.

“Quick, come down. Thank goodness you’re here!” The Heaven Splitting Divine Tablet’s voice was emotional.

Long Chen followed the chain down. Eventually, he saw a gigantic object that made his heart pound.

“This is…”
