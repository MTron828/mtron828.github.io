Chapter 2614 Master of the World

“Junior brother, I really like you.” Sovereign Han Wei smiled at Long Chen.

Long Chen gulped hard while sweat dripped down his back. Was this really a Sovereign?

“Back then, I got Sovereign Mo Li’s favor and received the burden. After that, I accomplished my mission and ended up waiting until Zi Yang appeared. That little Zi Yang was far too feeble for me to like, but there was no way around it. He was that era’s son of the heavens, so I could only pass the burden to him. Hehe, I didn’t expect to finally meet you. It really is excellent. Although you haven’t killed as many people as me, it’s fine. As long as you continue working hard, with your potential and aptitude, and considering that you were born in the right era, you will definitely surpass me in the future.” Sovereign Han Wei laughed delightedly.

“Why aren’t you saying anything?” asked Sovereign Han Wei after Long Chen didn’t reply.

What could he possibly say? Long Chen was speechless. Sovereign Han Wei’s style was completely different from the other four Sovereigns, so Long Chen was completely caught off guard by the lack of earnestness and peace.

“Big sister, I’m very happy to see you. Now that I’ve seen all five Sovereigns, I’m too moved to know what to say,” said Long Chen.

“Don’t even mention those four. The two of us are different from them. They all wear white. I wear violet. Hehe, you’re even more amazing. You wear black. Men should definitely wear black. It makes them appear more mysterious and handsome, don’t you think? They can kill and not stain their clothes. Using kindness to redeem sinners? Love everyone in the world? Guide through inaction? What nonsense. Bad people should be killed. Who has so much time to guide them? While guiding them, they continue to do harm to the good people. What sins have the good people done to deserve that? Who will protect them? To be good to bad people is to be cruel to good people. The good people don’t need any guidance, while bad people waste other people’s time to teach them. Then who would bother being a good person?

“When everyone decides it’s no longer worth it to be a good person, the world will fall into complete chaos. Then all their principles about redeeming sinners will collapse. At that time, there will no longer be a point to new Sovereigns because the entire world will implode on itself. Isn’t the point of risking our lives cultivating to get stronger so that when bad people bully us, we can fight back? But once we’re stronger, we have to guide them to the right path? Tch, who has that time? My responsibility is to protect the good people. Bad people? If I see them, I’ll kill them. As for those who are neither, if they stand on the good side, I’ll protect them. If they stand on the opposing side, I’ll kill them. I definitely won’t have mercy on them.” Han Wei’s expression grew serious. Her killing intent caused this entire space to twist.

Just standing there, Long Chen involuntarily trembled. Goosebumps rose on his skin, and his soul twinged in pain.

However, at the same time, for some reason, his blood began to heat up.

“Big sister, your words are too correct!” exclaimed Long Chen.

This thinking was identical to his own. Long Chen had finally found a practical soul mate.

Although he also admired Yun Shang, Qing Xu, Mo Li, and Zi Yang’s love for all lives, he could not do the same.

However, Han Wei’s words were practically his own. Through all his years on the Martial Heaven Continent, this was his first time encountering someone with the same thinking as his own. Furthermore, this person was actually a Sovereign.

“Hehe, we’re people from the same path. Regretfully, I’m already dead. Otherwise, I would definitely marry you,” Han Wei laughed.

This sudden turn caused Long Chen to blush. But there was also some pain.

Sovereign Han Wei had dominated an era. No, she was someone who had lived two lifetimes. She had dominated two eras but had been lonely through both lives, so she was also a pitiful person.

“Big sister, didn’t you reincarnate once? Why would you end up actually dying? Why didn’t you reincarnate once more?” asked Long Chen.

Sovereign Han Wei smiled brightly. She teased, “Did you take me seriously? You really want to marry me?”

Long Chen was embarrassed again. But at this moment, Sovereign Han Wei reached out and straightened his robes, wiping away the bloodstains and dust on his clothes.

“Once you grow up, you’ll understand. Sometimes, when responsibility comes before you, you must sacrifice some things. Sometimes those things include your life. That is because this sacrifice can gain you things that are even more important. Life is slow. Being alone is alright, and being lonely is fine. But we have to live the way we won’t regret. We will not lower our heads to fate.” A trace of warmth appeared on Sovereign Han Wei’s face. She was just like a big sister giving instructions to a little brother about to set off on a long journey.

“Hehe, I’m really happy to see you. Regretfully, I can’t help you with anything, but I know that you’re powerful. You will definitely be stronger than the five of us. This world is yours. You are the master of this world, and only you can break it. As the five of us were unable to break this death board, we passed this down to you. Now the karma of all five of us has accumulated onto you, and the path to a true expert has been opened for you.” Sovereign Han Wei gently held Long Chen’s face, her eyes full of anticipation.

“Big sister…”

Long Chen was overwhelmed. The five Sovereigns had passed things down to him? He was supposed to pick up their duty just like this? Long Chen felt a bit of panic.

“This generation’s master of the Southern Sea Zither can be considered a continuation of my life. You have to treat her properly. Have confidence in her.” After saying that, Sovereign Han Wei gently kissed Long Chen’s forehead.

After that, the surrounding space vanished, and the roaring of the demonic beasts pounded in his ears once more.

It was like everything that had happened was just an illusion. The Sovereign seal still hung in the air, and the zither music was still there.

However, now Long Chen felt a closeness to the Sovereign seal. He knew that it wasn’t an illusion.

Through the Sovereign seal, he saw that the other side was packed with terrifying demonic beasts, and he could even sense terrifying auras.

Several of them had boundless auras, and they were existences that Long Chen couldn’t beat. Although he had killed quite a few thirteenth rank demonic beasts, compared to these fellow thirteenth rank demonic beasts, the difference was as great as heaven and earth.

Long Chen then realized that the thirteenth rank demonic beasts that could pass through the Sovereign seal were the weakest of all thirteenth rank demonic beasts. The more powerful ones were still repulsed by the Sovereign seal.

“Big sister, I will not fail to live up to your expectations!” Long Chen swore to himself as he looked at the seal condensed of Sovereign Han Wei’s blood.

He had now come into contact with all five Sovereigns, but the only one that had left an unforgettable mark on his soul was Sovereign Han Wei.

She was different from the other Sovereigns because her thinking was the same as his. It was his first time feeling like he had a soul mate, but this soul mate had died tens of thousands of years ago. Due to this, he was filled with sadness but also a fighting spirit to continue her legacy.

Long Chen had originally felt a bit lost before because he was unable to imitate the other four Sovereigns. But upon seeing Sovereign Han Wei, he saw a new path before him. He was no longer lost as Sovereign Han Wei had become the light to guide his path.

At this moment, countless demonic beasts charged at Long Chen, and amongst them were quite a few demon kings. Meanwhile, the supreme experts of the demon race watched from the other side of the Sovereign seal. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

“Evilmoon, let’s eliminate these demon kings as food for Wilde,” said Long Chen.

“I’m enough. You just cooperate with me. The divine families are keeping an eye on you, so don’t expose your trump cards. Other than that, you’ve been affected by Sovereign Han Wei’s killing intent. You have to control yourself,” warned Evilmoon.

There were almost no recordings of Sovereign Han Wei on the Martial Heaven Continent, and only some records of her former life existed, as the ninth divine emissary that had walked the Dao of Slaughter.

However, even that matter was a secret only known to the Illusive Music Immortal Palace.

Sovereign Han Wei’s killing intent was incredibly heavy. It was unknown just how many lifeforms she had killed to the point that even Long Chen couldn’t endure her killing intent. If she had wanted to kill him, just releasing that killing intent was enough to wipe him out. That was how terrifying Sovereign Han Wei was.

Suddenly, Evilmoon’s runes lit up. When black qi filled the air, Long Chen’s divine ring shuddered and the Six Star Battle Armor appeared.

With a single slash, a demon king was cut in two. Blood and guts rained down. The power of this attack continued to slaughter a mass of demonic beasts behind the demon king.

After that, Evilmoon danced through the air, slaughtering the demonic beasts. Even the demon kings were unable to endure a single swing.

Just as Long Chen was killing demon kings in front of the Sovereign seal, a group of people gathered within a secret palace of the divine families. Those people were all higher-ups of the divine families, and they stared in shock at a giant cauldron.

The scene of Long Chen slaughtering the demon kings as easily as slicing melons was playing within the cauldron.

“When did Long Chen become this powerful?” exclaimed one of them. Those were all demon kings, and although they couldn’t beat the Sovereign sprouts, they were still on the same level. Even a Sovereign sprout would take some effort to kill them.

However, Long Chen was easily slaughtering them as they attacked him with numbers. As for the ordinary demonic beasts, he couldn’t even be bothered to kill them.

“It’s his weapon. It’s too sharp. Not even the protective divine light of the demon kings can block it. Just what is the origin of that saber?” The Heaven Executioner frowned.

“Aotian, Feng Fei, Wuchen, Liangchen, go lead the disciples over. Cut off the path of retreat for those demonic beasts. We’ll use this chance to wipe out the demonic beasts from our side of the battlefield and shock the demonic beast race. Remember, we’re just being extras this time. Don’t expose your trump cards,” said the Lord Venerate.

“Yes!”

Long Aotian, Ye Liangchen, Feng Fei, and Jiang Wuchen immediately vanished from the palace.
