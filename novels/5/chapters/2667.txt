Chapter 2656 Messy Battle

“Even at this time, they’re still fighting amongst themselves.” Hu Feng was startled. On their side, everyone was using up all their power just to block these terrifying lifeforms. But Long Chen’s side was still fighting amongst themselves as those lifeforms crashed upon them.

“Long Chen lives for battle. Not fighting with so many people there isn’t his style,” said Mo Nian calmly.

“Mo Nian, can you help out? How long do you plan to laze about?” raged Beitang Rushuang.

Mo Nian was silently hiding amongst them, not doing anything. Now he was even in the mood to provide commentary.

“Am I not simply holding back my power for if Long Chen needs me? It’ll be tough on you for now,” snickered Mo Nian.

“You’re saving your power? Are you being serious?” Beitang Rushuang eyed Mo Nian doubtingly.

“Are you trying to hurt my feelings? Are you questioning my power?” Mo Nian patted his chest.

“You’re wrong. I’m not questioning it. I’ve never believed in it from the start. All you know how to do is flap your gums all day. You don’t give me any sense of reliability,” said Beitang Rushuang disdainfully.

Mo Nian didn’t get mad and just chortled, “I can’t blame you for not believing it. After all, I’m a very low-key person. The Martial Heaven Continent has long since forgotten my great name. However, the main character always comes at the last moment. Everything before that is just child’s play. Wait and see. I, Mo Nian, will soon be a blazing sun that will illuminate this world. The darkness will be driven away by my power-”

“Shut up and get to work! I’ll kick you out right now!” roared Beitang Rushuang. This fellow only knew how to talk big, but he was simply hiding amongst their midst.

“Fine, fine!” Mo Nian helplessly joined in. His addition instantly revealed the pressure on Ximen Tianxiong.

As the battlefield on Mo Nian’s side lightened, the core of the lightning tribulation had turned into chaos. Within the exploding lightning, Long Chen was like a dragon in a chaotic battle.

Ye Liangchen and Jiang Wuchen had joined forces against the Alldevil Heavenwalker. The Alldevil Heavenwalker sneered. He was about to mock them for already being defeated when Ye Liangchen raised his sword. Waves of divine light slashed down on him like flying stars.

With a single sword, countless lifeforms were slashed apart. The Alldevil Heavenwalker’s heart shook. Devil qi exploded out of him.

BOOM!

When the Alldevil Heavenwalker’s devil qi was shattered by Ye Liangchen’s sword, Ye Liangchen sneered, “When I fought you last time, my Spirit Bone was still in slumber. I couldn’t activate my full manifestation. Today, I’ll let you experience the true Stars Illuminate the Cosmos.”

Ye Liangchen was surrounded by star-light. His manifestation was already present behind him as if he was in control of a whole starry sky.

“He’s mine!”

A furious roar rang out. A giant ax swung through the air at the Alldevil Heavenwalker. Jiang Wuchen was also attacking.

He had summoned his manifestation, and there was an ape king roaring inside it. Right now, countless chains made out of runes were connecting Jiang Wuchen to his manifestation, and his ax tore through the heavens.

“When the Spirit Bone awakens, the essence, qi, and spirit become one. Even without undergoing the full tribulation, you can already control the power of the Heaven Merging.”

Some of the Heaven Merging experts watching sighed. When the Spirit Blood, Spirit Root, and Spirit Bone were fully awakened, they became one, not only with each other but with the Dao as well. Their manifestations were fully activated, allowing them to unleash unprecedented power.

At this moment, the Alldevil Heavenwalker summoned a giant shield. Devil qi swirled around it. However, when Jiang Wuchen’s ax smashed into it, the shield exploded and the Alldevil Heavenwalker was blown back.

“Good!”

The experts of the divine families that were watching from a distance cheered. Jiang Wuchen had finally won back some face. The Jiang family’s people in particular sighed with relief.

His defeat last time had placed the Jiang family under immense pressure. Now that Jiang Wuchen had displayed his terrifying power, they were no longer being crushed under that pressure.

“Even if your Spirit Bones have awakened, so what? I could beat you once, and I can beat you again.” The Alldevil Heavenwalker roared, devil qi exploding out of him. He was like a devil king reborn.

“Big words! Face your death!” shouted Jiang Wuchen, once more swinging his ax.

Ye Liangchen also attacked. Having been defeated last time, as long as he could slay the Alldevil Heavenwalker, he would finally be able to retrieve the face that he had lost.

Seeing them, the Alldevil Heavenwalker sneered. He formed hand seals, and devil qi condensed into chains. They were like whips streaking through the air, leaving cracks in the void. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

With divine items in hand, Ye Liangchen and Jiang Wuchen fought an intense battle against the Alldevil Heavenwalker. Exploding divine light filled the air around them.

As the three of them fought, Long Chen fought against the Nine-Headed Lion. With lightning flickering on top of his dragon scales, he unleashed a punch that caused the void to explode. A mass of ripples spread and annihilated the surrounding lightning lifeforms.

The Nine-Headed Lion was incredibly powerful. His body also had thunderforce, and that thunderforce was no weaker than Long Chen’s.

That thunderforce also stemmed from the heavenly tribulation lightning of a world, so these two kinds of heavenly tribulation lightning repeatedly clashed. Space was in constant fluctuation.

As Long Chen fought with his fists, his dragon scales were like whirlpools sucking in the surrounding lightning. He could clearly feel Lei Long’s aura soaring inside of him. Its body was transforming multiple times.

Lei Long was coiled within Long Chen’s body, absorbing the lightning pouring in from the outside world. It had entered a strange state, as if it was undergoing a metamorphosis.

Huo Linger had taken on the form of a fire dragon and was resting beside Lei Long, protecting it. Long Chen noticed Huo Linger absorbing lightning as well, but not pure lightning. She was absorbing the laws of the worlds.

Those laws weren’t useful to Lei Long, so Huo Linger was using her flames to refine those laws until the lightning grew even purer.

As Long Chen fought the Nine-Headed Lion, the dragon woman, Ye Ming, and the Blood Fiend Devil Lord chose to just sit to the side. They didn’t directly attack. As for Long Aotian, he was also standing there coldly. No one knew what he was thinking.

Feng Fei looked at Long Aotian and hesitated. Her manifestation appeared behind her. She was just about to go help Long Chen when he sent her another spiritual message.

“Don’t join in. Save your energy to run.”
