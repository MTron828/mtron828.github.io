Chapter 2420 Competition of Spiritual Strength

Translator: BornToBe

A demon heart eruption.

That was the technique that the Demon Moon Furnace had just used, and it was the first time that the Demon Moon Furnace had ever employed its ability to kill for Long Chen.

The fact that Feng Fei was able to tell what this technique was surprised Long Chen. As expected, she really was knowledgeable.

Her fighting spirit had been ignited with the appearance of the Demon Moon Furnace. However, Long Chen shook his head. “I don’t have a reason to fight you. It would be best if you didn’t make trouble for no reason. I don’t want to be played for a fool by others.”

No matter if he won or lost, as long as he ended up in a fight with Feng Fei, it would be falling for Di Long’s plot. By fighting with a figure as powerful as Feng Fei, he would have to expose his trump cards.

“That’s not up to you.” Feng Fei stepped forward. No manifestation appeared; no aura erupted. But with a simple wave of her hand, the void twisted. The location that Long Chen was in collapsed.

Up, down, front, back, left, right, there was nowhere to run. This simple wave of her hand was like a dome covering Long Chen, forcing him to receive her attack.

Long Chen was infuriated. This Feng Fei really did have something wrong with her brain. Even though she was clearly being used, she was still doing it.

Long Chen also snorted and waved his hand. Just the same as her, he didn’t summon his divine ring or battle armor. It was a simple exchange of palms.

However, as he unleashed his palm, the Divine Gate within his mind-sea opened and Spiritual Strength exploded forth. Feng Fei had used her powerful Spiritual Strength to twist the laws of space, so Long Chen returned the blow with his own Spiritual Strength.

When their two palms intersected, there was no massive explosion. Instead, a tempest of soul energy erupted.

Screams rang out. The closest experts felt like their souls would be torn apart.

Di Long, Di Feng, and the other experts of the ancient family alliance were all startled. They hadn’t expected the two of them to instantly start competing in Spiritual Strength. The stronger experts protected the weaker ones, dragging them back until they were far enough away.

The spiritual tempest created strange spatial abnormalities. Startled cries rang out. They were all shocked to see a formless power like Spiritual Strength damage the void to such an extent.

Spiritual Strength was formless. It was difficult for it to cause damage to physical objects that didn’t possess souls. But with Long Chen and Feng Fei’s palms still connected, the people saw wild vortexes of power raging behind the two of them. Those vortexes seemed to contain sharp blades that were cutting through the void. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

Everyone present was a powerful expert in their own right, but they had never seen such powerful Spiritual Strength. They continued to retreat, because even at this distance, they still felt sharp pain in their souls.

The spiritual tempest continued to spread. Heaven and earth changed color.

“You refuse to fight with me and want to compete in just Spiritual Strength, but you didn’t realize that Spiritual Strength is my strongest area. I’d advise you to go for a real fight, or you won’t have the slightest chance of winning,” said Feng Fei like an arrogant phoenix.

“Spiritual Strength is your strongest area? Then let’s compete in it,” snorted Long Chen.

Long Chen didn’t want to have a real fight with her, but this foolish woman was forcing him to. Since Feng Fei had said that her Spiritual Strength was her strongest aspect, Long Chen used words to trap her into just competing with Spiritual Strength. That way, he wouldn’t need to reveal more trump cards.

“Fool. Did you think being an alchemist would give you an advantage? Since you’re so arrogant, don’t blame me if you die.” Feng Fei was angered by his indifference. She suddenly retreated.

As she fell back, she quickly formed seventeen hand seals in one breath. Heaven and earth quivered.

A giant illusory figure slowly condensed. A phoenix cry rang out, shaking people’s ears. Even after having retreated to a great distance, the ancient family alliance’s experts felt like their souls would be crushed.

Feng Fei had condensed a giant phoenix. It looked alive, with its divine radiance filling the world. With a flap of its wings, the laws of heaven and earth shook.

“What is that?!”

The phoenix’s wild aura was even more frightening than the aura of a fourth step Netherpassage expert. However, it didn’t have any of the aura of a Magical Beast or Xuan Beast.

“Summon your life soul beast. We’ll finish this in one move.” Feng Fei floated into the sky, her phoenix behind her. It illuminated her in a peerlessly beautiful light, but her voice was chilling.

“My life soul beast?” Long Chen suddenly recalled Meng Qi mentioning that there was a method to condense a soul beast within the Myriad Spirit Diagram.

However, condensing a soul beast required a powerful beast soul. The higher the quality of the beast soul, the stronger the soul beast that could be condensed.

Meng Qi had never found a suitable beast soul, so she had never condensed a soul beast. Condensing a soul beast required a huge amount of soul energy, and a life soul beast required ripping away a portion of the body’s soul seed to condense it.

A person could only have a single life soul beast. It was both a tool for battle as well as an assistance to cultivation.

Due to possessing the Nine Lotus Soul Condensing Pill, Meng Qi had never thought of condensing a soul beast. However, the Nine Lotus Soul Condensing Pill wasn’t for battle.

Seeing this terrifying soul beast, Long Chen’s heart sank. His soul energy was powerful, but he had never spent his time practicing soul arts, let alone condensing a soul beast.

“Beating you doesn’t require me taking out my life soul beast. If you have the ability, force it out.” Long Chen thickened his face to boast.

Feng Fei was further enraged. Long Chen was actually looking down on her. Her gaze turned cold, and her hand seals changed.

The phoenix behind her let out a sharp cry and charged at Long Chen.

Wherever the phoenix passed, a vortex of collapsed space was left behind. Despite clearly being condensed of Spiritual Strength, it was no different than if it was alive. It possessed its own killing intent that filled the air.

“As expected of senior Feng Fei. This spiritual attack is practically impossible to block. Feng-er, if you were facing her, could you receive this blow?” Di Long transmitted to Di Feng.

“If it was before, I definitely wouldn’t be able to block it. However, now I’ve fully awakened my Blood Emperor bloodline and merged with the Blood Emperor’s soul. With the Blood Emperor’s soul assisting me, I should have no problem against this move,” said Di Feng with a smile.

“Good. Remember, you can’t expose your current power. Once you enter the Star Field Divine World and can control Samsara power, the Emperor’s power will be fully within your grasp. At that time, Long Chen will be nothing, but for now you must endure. Long Chen is no longer your target. Your targets are those like Feng Fei. The divine families are using us, but hehe, why can’t we use them as well? You just need to keep sucking up to that mother of yours. Sooner or later, the Ye family will be ours to control, understood? I married that idiot woman and endured so much over the years just to assist you. Don’t disappoint me,” said Di Long.

“Father, don’t worry. Your child won’t disappoint you,” promised Di Feng.

BOOM!

Just at that moment, an explosion interrupted their silent conversation. A giant pill furnace had appeared to block the phoenix.

That was the Demon Moon Furnace, however, it was not its true body. It was something condensed of Long Chen’s Spiritual Strength.

Long Chen had been hesitating over what form he should use to block, and so he had randomly decided on the form of the Demon Moon Furnace.

Unexpectedly, when he used his Spiritual Strength to imitate the Demon Moon Furnace, the actual Demon Moon Furnace lit up and assisted.

“Big brother Long Chen, I don’t really understand this technique. At best, I can give you twenty percent of my power,” said Ling-er apologetically.

The Demon Moon Furnace had gone through countless masters, and she remembered a bit about every master.

She had encountered someone who had used this kind of technique. After flipping through countless memories, she had only found this one way to assist Long Chen. But that master’s soul arts were not that powerful.

“Ling-er, well done. That’s amazing,” praised Long Chen. With twenty percent of the Demon Moon Furnace’s power, that could make his Spiritual Strength many times more solid.

Long Chen was not skilled in fighting with Spiritual Strength. Summoning his soul outside his body was different from refining pills. It was a completely different style that he had not practiced before.

With Ling-er's assistance keeping the form that he had summoned stable, Long Chen just needed to fully display his Spiritual Strength. He was confident that his own Spiritual Strength would not lose to anyone.

“Your Spiritual Strength is this loose, and you dare to be so arrogant?” Feng Fei snorted. Energy suddenly poured out of her and into the phoenix’s head.

The phoenix’s eyes began to glow. Golden light shot out of them.

Two cracks appeared within the pill furnace that Long Chen had summoned. Following that, the entire thing crumbled.
