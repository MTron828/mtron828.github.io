Chapter 3886 Respectfully Sending You On Your Way

Following Xia Chen’s orders, over twenty-seven hundred Dragonblood warriors switched from an absolute defense formation to a killing formation.

It was like a closed flower was instantly blooming. Each the inside, the middle, and the outside had nine hundred Dragonblood warriors, moving back and forth. They were like giant gears spinning, grinding down the Blood race’s experts.

The Dragonblood warriors moved through the battlefield at high speed. Like spinning saw blades, they tore through their enemies.

It was the same formation and the same people as before. However, after undergoing through their new life in the immortal world, these Dragonblood warriors were no longer the same.

They had experienced trials and pain during this time. Hence, their light was sharper, stronger, and more ruthless than ever. They had even more confidence in themselves now.

The Blood race had been planning on using their number superiority to instantly crush them. But in the blink of an eye, hundreds of them died. In front of the Dragonblood Legion, they were weaker than sheep and could only be slaughtered.

“Run!”

In just a moment, someone realized that things were different from their expectations. They were simply dying on contact. This offensive formation was sharp and unbreakable, something that they couldn’t suppress with mere numbers.

“Save me!”

“No-!”

“I don’t want to die!”Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

However, just as they wanted to retreat, they found that there was no leaving once they were in. The surrounding space twisted and the currents outside refused to allow them to escape.

Most terrifying of all were the Dragonblood warriors. Like three coiling dragons, they dominated this space. Every group of nine hundred Dragonblood warriors was its own force, and touching a single one of them was equivalent to touching the combined force of nine hundred Dragonblood warriors. That power made their enemies despair.

The Blood race’s army could only cry, already despairing without any ability to resist at all. They could only watch as they were mercilessly slain.

Only the Blood race experts that had yet to charge into their midst were unaffected by the invisible flows of space. They could flee, but the rest were slain in just a few breaths’ time.

Millions of experts were crushed in the blink of an eye, and only over a hundred thousand survived. Right now, the Blood race’s experts were dumbfounded and terrified. Their current enemies were definitely not humans, but rather devils, monsters, or death reapers.

After their offensive formation did its part, all the Dragonblood warriors, as well as Xia Chen and Guo Ran, were incredibly excited. Their blood was boiling with excitement as they had found again the old feeling of fighting together to their heart’s content.

For over a year, they had been fighting for themselves. Now, they had all grown stronger, and this newfound strength combined them into a solid, unyielding rope. Even they were amazed and afraid of their new power.

The proudest and most emotional of them all was Xia Chen. Just now, he had just divided the Dragonblood warriors into new groups and subdivisions. He then distributed new runes to them and told them to get accustomed to their new positions and the people beside them.

Unfortunately, the Blood race’s experts immediately came, and they didn’t have any time to practice. But in an instant, they could showcase a staggering level of synergy within their newly formed teams. This achievement filled Xia Chen with an immense sense of pride.

Clearly, the Dragonblood warriors were capable of tacitly working together on a profound level. It was as if this synergy had been branded into their blood and souls. A mere gesture or glance could convey unspoken thoughts among them. This tacit cooperation was something that had been tempered through countless life-and-death battles on the Martial Heaven Continent. It was something that would never fade away.

Just as the Dragonblood warriors drove off the Blood race’s army, countless powerful auras emerged, coming from every direction, signifying the arrival of more city lords. Just based on the auras that they could sense, there were at least dozens of them.

“Hahaha, the ancestral dragon scale! A little human wishes to consume the ancestral dragon scale? Don’t fantasize like that! This treasure isn’t something that you can touch.”

A boisterous laughter echoed from a member of the beast race, his entire body enveloped in scales with eagle-like wings sprouting from his back. Notably, a long tail, several times the length of his body, extended from his hip region. That thin tail was like a whip, but its tip was a silver-gray bone spur that gave off a chilling sharp light.

This was a lifeform that they had not seen before. His body gave off an immemorial aura, and there were countless demonic beasts behind him.

“The inferior human race thinks they can touch a sacred object? Hehe, humans really do have the greediest hearts. But you’ll have to spit out whatever you swallowed.”

Another commanding voice rang out from an enormous terrifying expert. His bronze skin was covered in runes and his voice was like a drum, capable of shaking people’s souls.

One expert after another appeared, each possessing auras on par with the lord of Silver Moon City and the Blood race’s elder. In fact, some of their auras surpassed the two of them. It was unbelievable that dozens of experts on this level would appear at once.

Their attention was drawn toward the immemorial dragon corpses, yet their eyes were ultimately fixated on the dragon scale eggshell enclosing Long Chen. Each of them harbored a fervent desire to possess it.

These people all came from different powers and races. But they all knew that their primary objective was to break that golden eggshell around Long Chen.

“Bastards!”

Seeing so many terrifying experts appear at once, Gu Yang, Li Qi, Song Mingyuan, and the others hastily pulled back and prepared to face them.

“How laughable!” Seeing this scene, that unknown lifeform with the long tail sneered. His tail then whipped through the air in a strange arc at Gu Yang.

BOOM!

With a forceful stomp, Gu Yang created two ripples in the void. The world trembled as a result, and in this exchange, that unknown lifeform was blown far into the distance by Gu Yang.

“So the human race actually produced someone on this level? But it means nothing as I will not give you any chance to grow. All of you will die today!”

Another powerful expert charged forward, immediately launching a sharp killing blow right at the start.

“You’re the ones who are going to die! Once boss comes out, not one of you will live to escape!” roared Gu Yang while stabbing his spear forward.

BANG!

Due to just having fought off the other lifeform, Gu Yang was at a disadvantage here. This time, he was the one blown back.

“Heaven Earth Spirit, Shield Heaven and Earth!”

All of a sudden, the earth rippled under the command of Li Qi and Song Mingyuan. With great coordination, they quickly summoned a thick earthen wall, effectively blocking those experts outside.

BOOM!

However, that wall was forcibly blown apart.

“They’re not going to give us time to strengthen it!” shouted Song Mingyuan.

Before the earth wall’s power was fully condensed, it was already shattered. It couldn’t block the attacks of this many experts.

“Inferior human race, priceless treasures aren’t something that you can touch!” As the earth wall shattered, a figure flew through, seemingly teleporting right before the Dragonblood warriors. Wearing a fierce smile, he swiftly formed hand seals, causing blood-red light to condense in his hands. A horrifying pressure quickly spread from his body, infecting the surroundings.

“Inferior? Are you talking about yourself?”

An icy voice rang out at this moment, accompanied by a sword that slashed through the air.

Just like that, Sword Qi sliced through this figure from the crown of his head to his crotch, cleaving his body in two. A subtle quiver coursed through his now divided body, his expression contorting into one of sheer terror. Following that, his body slowly fell apart, two halves falling to the ground. Even the light that he had just condensed in his hand was perfectly split in two like a neatly cut-up fruit.

As his body and divine light were impeccably severed in two, the true form of a handsome man was revealed on the other side. With starry, cold eyes, he stood resolute, his presence exuding an air of icy detachment.

“Long Chen’s subordinate, the Dragonblood Legion’s fourth captain, Yue Zifeng, is here to respectfully send you on your way.”

After saying that, Yue Zifeng stepped forward. His sword slashed toward another city lord-level expert who had just charged forward.
