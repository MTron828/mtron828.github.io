Chapter 2086 Tian Xiezi

Long Chen came out of the alchemy room, still immersed in his pride and excitement from evolving the World Annihilation Flame Lotus

“What, did you find some money?” Coincidentally, Beitang Rushuang came out of another private room at the same time. Seeing his bright smile, she couldn’t help being speechless. Just how did someone who didn’t know how to conceal his emotions become an expert?

“Hehe, it’s even better than money. I’ve developed my own supreme move. If anyone tries to mess with me again, I’ll beat them until even their grandmas won’t recognize them.” Long Chen chortled, pleased with himself.

The advancement of the World Annihilation Flame Lotus marked a new milestone on his cultivation path. Throughout history, only the most astonishing and amazing of experts had managed to create their own powerful techniques. Their names were recorded within history. That was an honor only a few could receive.

Long Chen was extremely confident in the World Annihilation Flame Lotus. Although it was still incomplete, he was sure that he would be able to bring it to the level where it could shake the world.

“Keep bragging. If I ever believe you again, I’ll admit defeat.” Beitang Rushuang rolled her eyes. Who knew whether this fellow ever said one word of truth amongst his bragging?

The two of them walked together into the auction room, and they could see a few people who had arrived before them. The room had been rearranged with new seats, but after his last experience, Long Chen immediately asked for a seat near the back this time.

“Brother Long, long time no see.”

One scholarly man immediately stood up upon seeing Long Chen and waved.

“Hu Feng, haha, you’ve come as well!” Long Chen was a bit surprised. He finally saw a familiar face.

“You are the heir of the Gambling Heavenly Dao?” Beitang Rushuang was startled. The heirs of the Gambling Heavenly Dao had all been famous throughout history. Their origins were mysterious, but they were incredibly powerful.

“This little one is the twenty-seventh generation heir, Hu Feng. Greetings, fairy Rushuang.” Hu Feng bowed slightly to Beitang Rushuang, speaking humbly.

Beitang Rushuang returned the etiquette, curiously asking, “You two are friends?”

“I’ve known brother Long for a long time. It can be said that he’s my idol.” Hu Feng smiled.

Beitang Rushuang looked at Long Chen strangely. “It seems you must have some good points for you to have friends.”

Long Chen’s expression twitched, but he didn’t reply. How could he not have any friends? Was everyone in this world his enemy? Hu Feng merely smiled and returned to his seat.

Long Chen saw many new faces, but now wasn’t the time to ask Beitang Rushuang about them. He walked over to his seat and found that Nangong Zuiyue had been waiting for them.

“It’s been three days, but fairy Zuiyue’s beauty has only grown with time,” said Long Chen.

Nangong Zuiyue really didn’t know how to reply to Long Chen. His praise lacked any sincerity due to how exaggerated he made it, but it was intentional.

“After three days, mister Long Chen seems happier than ever. You must have made great gains.”

“You noticed?” exclaimed Long Chen.

“With how obvious you are, even a blind person would have seen it,” snorted Beitang Rushuang as she sat down.

Nangong Zuiyue smiled. “This is your special trait. A clear heart without any inhibitions can be taken as a kind of realm.”

“Hmph, for someone to bring shamelessness to such a level, this realm will never be surpassed,” said Beitang Rushuang as she picked up a grape.

Long Chen laughed and sat down as well. He quietly watched more people walk in.

“The Dongfang family is truly powerful. They were able to pull in so many experts. Their influence is amazing.” Nangong Zuiyue sighed.

Long Chen wanted to ask which of the four everlasting families was strongest, but this definitely wasn’t the right place to ask it.

“Long Chen!”

A happily surprised cry rang out. Long Chen turned to see Ye Lingshan.

Long Chen immediately stood up and introduced her to Beitang Rushuang and Nangong Zuiyue. Ye Lingshan almost couldn’t believe her eyes.

She had long since made a list of the heroes of the ancient era, noting their special characters. Seeing Nangong Zuiyue and Beitang Rushuang sitting together very amicably together with Long Chen, she was stunned.

“The Martial Heaven Alliance’s Ye Lingshan greets fairy Zuiyue and fairy Rushuang.” Ye Lingshan hastily bowed.

She had seen many of the monsters of the ancient era on her way here. All of them were powerful enough to make her heart shake. She felt like she had been at the bottom of a well before.

Fortunately, her master had been wise enough to make her solidify her foundation after awakening her manifestation. Her aura was strong and condensed. If she hadn’t awakened her manifestation before coming here, she would have been a laughingstock. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

Nangong Zuiyue and Beitang Rushuang returned Ye Lingshan’s bow. Ye Lingshan clearly looked up to the two of them and spoke with honorifics toward them.

Nangong Zuiyue comforted her and told her that there was no need to be so courteous. They could just call each other sisters. The feeling of distance between them was quickly shortened.

“You only got here today?” asked Long Chen.

“I arrived yesterday. Dongfang Yuyang led me around the city for the first day. To tell the truth, the foundation of the everlasting families is quite frightening.” Ye Lingshan couldn’t help sighing. Her eyes had been opened to the world. She had seen things that she hadn’t even heard of before. Compared to the everlasting families, the Martial Heaven Alliance was poor.

“He strolled around with you for a day? Is he trying to seduce you?” questioned Long Chen.

“Nonsense. Dongfang Yuyang isn’t like that. Your way of thinking is just too dirty,” rebuked Ye Lingshan.

Long Chen asked her about the current state of the Martial Heaven Alliance and was told that everything was going well. The entire world was keeping track of the goings on of this gathering, and things were peaceful outside.

“Tian Xiezi has come.”

Suddenly, Ye Lingshan pointed toward a newcomer by the door. It was a tall and slender man with a scholar’s band on his head. He held a white paper fan in his hand. It was clearly a scholarly decoration, but the fan had images of mountains of corpses and seas of blood on it.

The evil air around him was apparent. There were also some flickering blood runes within his eyes. When they opened and closed, a devilish light glinted, making people shiver.

“Xie Tianzi is the Corrupt Emperor’s descendant. The Corrupt Emperor was suppressed by the Sovereign of his generation for a lifetime. It’s said that Xie Tianzi inherited the Corrupt Emperor’s supreme techniques and can be considered his heir. He’s extremely dangerous,” warned Beitang Rushuang gravely.

Long Chen looked at Xie Tianzi, knowing that they were fated to be enemies. They were on opposite sides, and one of them would have to die.

Xie Tianzi’s gaze swept through the room. He immediately saw Long Chen and Ye Lingshan. A devilish smile appeared on his face. He didn’t speak, instead swiping his white fan across his neck in a throat-cutting gesture.

Long Chen replied with a smile and a raised fist with the middle finger sticking up.

The blood runes in Xie Tianzi’s eyes began to spin. It was like being stared at by death.

“Don’t look right at him. His eyes possess a divine ability to steal people’s souls,” warned Nangong Zuiyue.

Just at that moment, Ye Lingshan felt the space around her begin to twist. It was like the world was spinning, and she felt like she might puke. After hearing Nangong Zuiyue’s warning, she hastily focused herself on blocking. With just a glance, Xie Tianzi had caused such a reaction. Furthermore, his main target was Long Chen, not Ye Lingshan, but she was still affected.

Long Chen looked right back at Xie Tianzi. This was a spiritual clash, as well as a clash of wills.

The space between the two of them wildly twisted. The blood runes filled Xie Tianzi’s eyes and transformed into one strange image after another. There were wild beasts roaring, sinister ghosts wailing, and despite there clearly being no sound, it felt like they could hear the wailing in their souls.

One star after another appeared in Long Chen’s. In the end, five stars shone brightly. That was the mark of the Five Star Battle Armor.

However, this time Long Chen hadn’t summoned it outside. It was purely a mental clash.

This kind of clash was no less dangerous than a battle with blades. Whoever lost would receive a grievous blow to their Dao-heart. If they fought for real, the odds of losing would be many times greater.

The entire room was tense as the other experts simply watched. No one said anything or attempted to stop them.

Nangong Zuiyue and Beitang Rushuang looked at Long Chen. An invisible wind made his robes flutter. He appeared calm with his hands clasped behind his back, and his expression was icy. That imposing figure he cut made him seem like a completely different person.

The two ladies were both supreme experts and saw that Long Chen was on the defensive. However, he was like a steady boulder. His grand Spiritual Strength shocked them, but then they recalled that he was an alchemist.

“Move aside!”

Tian Xiezi’s smile grew as they continued staring at each other. He was about to make another move when an icy voice rang out, one that felt like it was about to freeze people’s souls.
