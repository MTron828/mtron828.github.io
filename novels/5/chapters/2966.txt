Chapter 2955 Boss Long San Returns a Gift

Although Luo Bing had guessed that the Chu family’s people would come to disturb their celebration, she hadn’t expected them to go so far. Hence, she quivered with rage.

Long Chen was also surprised. The Chu family’s people really were the epitome of using any means necessary, even such a despicable trick. Their shamelessness had reached a rather frightening level, so Long Chen silently raised his level of guard. It seemed that he had underestimated Chu Yang.

Everyone from the Luo family was enraged by Chu Yang’s arrival. He was intentionally insulting them.

Long Chen then stepped forward to face Chu Yang and smiled, replying to his words. “Oh, the great head of the Chu Alliance is so courteous. Have you dug out your ancestor for us? That truly is a big gift.”

Chu Yang’s satisfied smile stiffened.

“What are you standing around for? Hurry up and open it. Please, bring out your father and mother. If they stay stuffed in there for too long, that would be bad. If they end up suffocating, then this happy day would end up on a bad note. Your Chu family wouldn’t do such an insulting thing to your ancestors, right? If that was the case, quite a few people would probably go to your Chu family to send gifts as well.” Long Chen pointed at the coffin solemnly.

Luo Bing and Luo Ning’s quivering rage was precisely what Chu Yang wanted. But Long Chen had turned things around. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

Chu Yang had brought people with crap in their hands to disgust others, but before they managed to throw it onto others, they ended up smearing it all over themselves.

Seeing his unsightly expression, it seemed that he wanted to strike back but wasn’t able to think of any suitable words. Luo Bing and the others were delighted by this. The power of Long Chen’s tongue was not inferior to his fists.

After a moment, Chu Yang suddenly smiled. “I think that you’ve misunderstood. This coffin is just a gift with no other intentions. It’s a wish of good wealth and promotion-”

Just at that moment, Long Chen slapped him. Seeing this, Chu Yang instinctively stepped back but still didn’t manage to avoid being struck in the face.

He was then sent flying, tumbling several times before landing. Once he was lying on the ground, everyone clearly saw a large handprint on his face, and that handprint was black as ink. It was as if his face had been burned.

Long Chen was startled inside. Chu Yang was truly powerful. He had instantly sensed when Long Chen was slapping. Since coming to the immortal world, Chu Yang was the first person capable of even thinking of dodging when Long Chen tried to slap them. This person’s sense of danger was alarming.

Lei Long was still in slumber after absorbing the heavenly tribulation lightning of the immortal world. However, due to how often they had cooperated, thunderforce had automatically appeared on his palm. Originally, he had thought that this slap would be able to injure Chu Yang, but all he managed to do was leave a handprint. Chu Yang wasn’t injured at all.

The instant Long Chen’s palm contacted his face, Long Chen sensed a strange divine energy fluctuation within Chu Yang’s body that protected him. Most of his attack’s power was blocked by this mysterious energy.

All the experts present were shocked. How could a fight break out here? It was far too sudden.

As for the experts of the Luo family, they stared at Long Chen in shock. He was truly domineering. His face didn’t even twitch after slapping Chu Yang.

Long Chen politely cupped his fists and smiled. “A face slap is a gift with no other intentions. It’s a wish of good wealth and promotion. Brother Chu, I’ve taken your coffin. This little return gift of mine isn’t much, but please accept it.”

Only then did the Chu family’s disciples react. They all took out their weapons, raging with killing intent. As long as Chu Yang gave the order, they would instantly hack Long Chen to death.

Mu Qingyun and the others also took out their weapons, and the auras of the Unfettered Alliance and Luo Gate’s disciples erupted. Even Luo Qifeng and the others gasped their weapons, ready for battle. They surrounded the Chu family’s forces.

The Unfettered Alliance and Luo Gate had over eight hundred disciples together. They had an absolute number advantage over the small group of just over ten people that Chu Yang had brought.

“Hey, what are you doing? Put away your weapons. Is this how you treat guests? You don’t have any manners,” scolded Long Chen.

Long Chen completely ignored the other experts that Chu Yang had brought. Acting as if they didn’t even exist, he walked past them to Chu Yang.

Chu Yang’s expression was dark. Icy killing intent flickered in his eyes, but he seemed to be restraining himself.

When Long Chen walked right up to him, he involuntarily retreated. He had been careless this time. Anything within ten steps of Long Chen was his face-slapping range. Within that range, no one was incapable of dodging his ghostly divine face-slapping art.

The reason for that was because of his temporary advantage. Seeing Luo Bing and the others quivering in rage had lowered his guard toward Long Chen.

Long Chen smiled. “Don’t look so scared. For you to come bearing gifts for us means that you’re our guest. You gave us such a fine coffin as a gift. I’ve returned a face-slap as your gift. Aren’t we even?”

Chu Yang’s killing intent intensified, and runes began to appear on his face. The handprint on his face quickly faded.

Once it was gone, Chu Yang suddenly laughed. “That’s right. We’ve given our gifts. We should be more friendly in the future.”

Chu Yang patted Long Chen on the shoulder. As for Long Chen, he also patted Chu Yang’s shoulder. Everyone watching was dumbfounded, almost unable to believe their eyes.

If they didn’t see how Long Chen had slapped Chu Yang, they would actually think that they were good brothers. For a moment, everyone just looked at each other blankly.

In a quiet voice that only the two of them could hear, Chu Yang’s voice hissed out.

“Brat, this is the first time that I’ve been so humiliated by someone. Are you prepared to feel my wrath?”

“Brat, I don’t know how many people I’ve slapped in this life. There’s no need to mind. It might be a bit uncomfortable the first time, but you’ll slowly get used to it. Youngster, go slowly. Don’t rush,” consoled Long Chen.

“Do you believe me when I say that at this distance, your life is in my hands? As long as I will it, you will die. No one in this world can save you,” said Chu Yang, his gaze growing frighteningly sharp.
