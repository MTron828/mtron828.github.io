Chapter 2601 Visiting the Grand Xia

𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

Explosions rang throughout Resentful Death City, and one resentful spirit after another exploded. Those were the human race’s experts that had been infected by the aura of this place.

At this moment, a cauldron appeared in Sovereign Zi Yang’s violet sun. After that, specks of light flew out of the exploded resentful spirits and entered the cauldron.

“Under my name as Zi Yang, I order the cycle of reincarnation to allow the souls of those from the Martial Heaven Continent that fought alongside me to return home. Let them pass through the sea of bitterness…” Sovereign Zi Yang began to chant a sutra.

From those specks of light, Long Chen sensed sincere emotions. They were like lost souls returning home. In truth, only a portion of their souls still remained here, controlled by the laws, and now Sovereign Zi Yang had broken their physical bodies, allowing their souls to escape the chains. They then returned to the Heavenly Daos.

Although they were already dead, their souls still contained yearning for the Martial Heaven Continent. They longed to go back. Even if they were already dead, they wished for their souls to be buried in the Martial Heaven Continent.

Upon seeing this scene, any regret that Long Chen had felt about using up this trump card faded. These souls were his seniors, and they had fought to the death to protect the Martial Heaven Continent. Everyone from the Martial Heaven Continent was in their debt. Without their bloody sacrifice, perhaps the Martial Heaven Continent would already be destroyed. So, to bring peace to these heroes was worth it.

“Hahaha, foolish Zi Yang, you did this just for this group of trash?” The elder of the Death Spirit race laughed contemptuously.”

“What are you laughing at?!” Long Chen furiously swung Evilmoon at the cane.

BOOM!

Long Chen was blown back, and his hand was bleeding, but killing intent blazed inside of him. He was just about to summon the Six Star Battle Armor when Sovereign Zi Yang stopped him.

“Long Chen, don’t be impetuous. He is locked within the bone cane. Unless you have one of the five supreme divine items, you can’t touch him. But he also can’t attack anyone either.”

“Old bastard, just wait.” Long Chen ground his teeth furiously. He regretted showing his anger, but this elder truly infuriated him.

Long Chen rarely admired anyone, but those that he admired were viewed as heroes in his heart. However, this elder was insulting those heroes, calling them trash.

Looking at the flames of fury soaring out of Long Chen, Sovereign Zi Yang laughed. If it was anyone else, they would only feel fear against such a terrifying existence. But Long Chen felt anger and hatred for him. This was a true fearless expert.

“Little brat, you dare to say such a thing? When Ye Ming inherits the death spirit energy, he will reach the path to Sovereignty on the Martial Heaven Continent. As for you, you will become nothing more than one of the resentful spirits beneath him, hahaha!” laughed the Death Spirit race elder.

“Him? Are you trying to make me laugh to death? Ignoring whether or not he can become Sovereign, I’d kill him nonetheless,” sneered Long Chen.

“He’s intentionally provoking you,” said Sovereign Zi Yang, pulling Long Chen out of Resentful Death City and back into the Sovereign seal.

“I know, but he really is infuriating,” said Long Chen. He also knew that the elder was trying to leave a shadow in his heart to make it harder for him to advance. If Long Chen ended up with a heart-devil, he would have fallen for his plot.

It went without saying that this elder, who had lived for countless years, was a crafty old fox. He instantly saw through Long Chen’s weakness, and Long Chen really cooperated with him. With just a test, Long Chen blew up in anger.

Sovereign Zi Yang shook his head slightly, seemingly speechless toward Long Chen’s temper. If he knew the other side was doing it intentionally, why fall for it? He had never seen such a person.

Suddenly, space quivered, and tens of thousands of divine items appeared before Long Chen. Some of them were already rusted and broken, and some were stained with blood. The fact that divine items would rust was a testament to how powerful the blood staining them was to be able to corrode even divine items.

If they were just rusted, then that was fine. But many of them were broken and essentially scrap metal. Yet, Sovereign Zi Yang had still brought them back.

“Their corpses have been turned into that state, so I trust that their descendants wouldn’t want to see them in such an insulting state. However, these weapons are a testament to their bravery. I will definitely pass them to their descendants as proof that their ancestors were peerless heroes,” said Long Chen solemnly.

Sovereign Zi Yang said, “Little brother, I can’t quite understand you. You are different from us, and perhaps that is why we were protectors, but you are the gamebreaker. I leave the Martial Heaven Continent to you then. Like I said before, when the responsibility comes, you will understand what it means to be duty bound. Goodbye.”

After Sovereign Zi Yang patted Long Chen’s shoulder, he slowly faded along with the aura of a Sovereign. The beautiful violet light was then replaced with darkness.

As the Sovereign seal also faded away, Long Chen was overwhelmed with sadness and frustration. Sovereign Zi Yang, a hero of a generation, had also died. He was unable to accept this reality.

When the Sovereign seal vanished, the endless resentful spirits within Resentful Death City were released of the pressure holding them back. They began to roar.

Long Chen’s heart shuddered. He then ran through the channel back into the Corrupt God Cemetery and went straight to the Martial Heaven Continent.

Looking back at the entrance to the Corrupt God Cemetery, he felt like it was a dream. He had actually met Sovereign Zi Yang. If that news spread, it would shake the continent.

However, this secret could not be spoken. What if someone asked what pointers the Sovereign gave? What if they asked where the Sovereigns were?

Was he supposed to say that the Sovereigns were already dead and that he was somehow supposed to save the world?

“Senior apprentice-brother Long Chen, are you alright?!”

The disciples immediately shouted in relief when they saw Long Chen return. They had been nervous the entire time, but he really had come back safe and sound.

Seeing their concerned expressions, Long Chen couldn’t help recalling Sovereign Zi Yang’s final words: when the responsibility comes, you will understand what it means to be duty bound.

“I’m fine. Don’t worry,“ said Long Chen as he patted the shoulder of one warrior.

It was just a casual action, but it made that warrior indescribably moved. In his heart, Long Chen was on the same level as a god.

After that, Long Chen waved at those warriors and stepped onto his flying boat, flying to a nearby city. Right now, the people living in it looked listless. The old sights of people clamoring on the streets were gone.

As the dark era had descended, everyone was anxious, especially the commoners. They didn’t have the power to resist whatever came to be, so they could only entrust their hopes to the experts of this world.

Coupled with the fact that the Sovereign had yet to appear, this was the worst news that made people feel despair.

Although the Martial Heaven Alliance was now fully united, with them having the support of the High Priest, Daoist Heavenly Feather, and the Illusive Music Immortal Palace’s Music Master, they were facing various terrifying danger zones like the Yin Yang World, Devil Spirit Mountain, and Resentful Death City on their own.

As for the divine families, the Corrupt path, the ancient family alliance, Pill Valley, and the sea demons, they were enemies with Long Chen. Because of their conflict, the continent was in danger of breaking apart from the inside before any outsiders even came.

The experts of the cultivation world, especially those of the Martial Heaven Alliance, had high hopes for Long Chen. Unfortunately, the commoners didn’t have that understanding of the cultivation world. All they knew was that the Sovereign was the savior of the world, and there were no signs of anyone setting foot on that path.

Because of it, while the Martial Heaven Alliance’s experts were still active and had some positivity, the commoners were shivering in terror every day.

In the city, Long Chen stepped onto the transportation formation, and after several transfers, he appeared in the Grand Xia’s capital. What he didn’t expect was that here, the city was still as lively as ever. It seemed that people weren’t affected at all.

“Greetings, Great General!”

When Long Chen appeared, the warriors guarding the transportation formation immediately bowed to him.

Long Chen smiled. Back when he had fled to the Grand Xia, the Grand Xia had taken him in. After that, he had been given the title of the National Protector, Great General Long Chen, and had received the emissaries from the Grand Han Ancient Nation.

At that time, quite a few interesting things occurred. Now that he thought back to it, he cherished those memories and also found it a bit funny.

He, the so-called National Protector, didn’t seem to have any actual responsibilities. It seemed that his work in this post hadn’t lasted more than a few days. Anyway, the Grand Xia hadn’t given him any pay as a soldier either, so it could be considered that both sides were even.

After Long Chen greeted those warriors, he set off for the Wine God Palace. However, on his way, he ended up drawing the attention of countless people, especially youngsters.

In the Grand Xia, Long Chen was exceptionally well-known. What had occurred in the Grand Xia back then had been recorded as stories and legends for the commoners. Therefore, it could be said that Long Chen had managed to push the storytelling profession in the Grand Xia to its peak.

Some wine and tea houses even hired storytellers to show how high class they were. Moreover, portraits of Long Chen were selling very well. As a result, when Long Chen walked through the streets, he drew out countless startled cries.

“Excuse me! That’s my big brother!” Suddenly, a group of people squeezed through the crowd, and a young girl’s voice rang out.
