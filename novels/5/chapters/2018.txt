Last time, when Long Chen had entered Pill Valley, he had gone through the transportation formation. However, as there were just too many people this time, they ended up flying through the air.

They were flying through a long canyon. There were eighty-one wonders and three hundred and sixty turns, each showing different beautiful scenery. This entire canyon represented a kind of realm in alchemy. When Long Chen had first come to Pill Valley, Elder Zhao Xiang had explained it to him in detail.

Now that he was flying through this canyon once more, he felt a completely different feeling. As for the other experts, they curiously looked at the canyon, finally understanding where Pill Valley’s name came from.

“Everyone, take note of the two statues at the end. You must pay respects to our gods, Lord Brahma and Fallen Daynight. Although everyone has different faiths, you cannot do anything to blaspheme our gods. There is no need to kowtow, but an insult to them would be an insult to Pill Valley, turning you into Pill Valley’s mortal enemy. Take note!” shouted the elder leading the path.

These disciples came from various powers, and they had their own beliefs. Some of them believed in gods, and for some of them, there hadn’t been the slightest communication to their gods in countless years, and even any inheritance left behind had been fractured and was gone.

However, many people were still extremely devout to their beliefs. They had unswerving loyalty to them, so they definitely wouldn’t kowtow to any other gods. That would be a betrayal.

Sometimes, faith was very interesting. Many gods taught their followers that they were the one true god, while others were just false gods and their followers had to scoff at those false gods.

That was why this elder of Pill Valley was first warning everyone. If anyone spat on their gods, they would definitely be slaughtered.

“Blaspheming their gods? Does peeing count?” Long Chen suddenly smiled derisively. He looked at the two statues and couldn’t help thinking of what he had done to them back then. It was just regretful that he didn’t leave behind a sign of what he had done, or Pill Valley would have definitely gone insane.

Pill Valley’s experts all knelt down reverently once they arrived at the statues. As for the other disciples, some bowed, while others just silently stared without doing anything. They had their own faiths and couldn’t revere other gods. The people from the Corrupt path, the Bloodkill Hall, and even the Xuan Beasts all didn’t bow.

The Corrupt path had their Corrupt God, the Bloodkill Hall had their Killing God, and while the Xuan Beasts had no god they believed in, their faith lay in the Peng Emperor.

Of course, many others didn’t move either as they worshiped their own gods. Long Chen was amongst them, and this wasn’t conspicuous at all.

After kneeling to his gods, that elder continued leading people into Pill Valley. For some reason, Long Chen’s heart tensed up. If he entered the gates of Pill Valley and was exposed, he might never be able to leave. That was definitely courting death. There were already thousands of Pill Valley’s experts gathered here.

Pill Valley’s grand formation activated. Divine light suddenly spread from the two statues, enveloping everyone.

“No need to panic. To prevent any spies of the Martial Heaven Alliance from entering, we’re starting the examination to make sure that you’re who you say you are. All you need to do is take out your tablets!” said the elder.

Hearing that, everyone relaxed slightly, and only Long Chen’s heartbeat quickened. However, thinking about it, he was already prepared for this. He wasn’t afraid of being investigated.

“Who are you?!”

As the geniuses were investigated one by one, an Elder of Pill Valley suddenly shouted. A ray of light fell from the great formation, enveloping a man who was pale with fright.

The man could only sigh, “I’m just a nameless rogue cultivator. I’m not strong or talented enough to enter Pill Valley’s eyes. Someone mocked me while I was traveling, and we ended up in a fight. I ended up killing him and taking his token, hoping I could change my fate. I didn’t think I’d be so easily exposed. Well, fine, I can only accept whether you want to kill or plunder me.”

Someone really had tried to sneak their way in? Quite a few experts were startled. As for Long Chen, looking at that man, a slight smile suddenly appeared on his face.

“Since you want to defy the fate the heavens gave you, why not openly come to my Pill Valley? We’ve long since announced that as long as you draw a clear line between yourself and the Martial Heaven Alliance, even if you don’t stand on Pill Valley’s side, you can still enter the Brahma secret realm,” shouted the Elder.

That man bitterly smiled. “But I’m just a rogue cultivator. None of the major powers care about me. How could I be qualified to be invited?” Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

To come to Pill Valley for the Brahma secret realm required an invitation card. The various sects and powers had first applied for invitations with Pill Valley, and then once Pill Valley had confirmed things, they had sent out the tablets.

As for rogue cultivators, they weren’t viewed importantly normally. They had no sects, so how could they obtain the tablets?

“However, this isn’t an excuse for you to sneak into Pill Valley. According to Pill Valley’s rules, you will be killed...” The man immediately turned pale white, but the elder continued, “However, as a rogue cultivator, making something of yourself isn’t easy. To be kind, we will give you a way in. You can enter the Brahma secret realm, but you need to swear before the gods to devote yourself to the lives of the continent and not associate with the Martial Heaven Alliance. Can you do that?”

Fuck, so it was actually a play. Long Chen sneered inside.

That man was delighted and hastily knelt on the ground, swearing to be absolutely loyal to Pill Valley in the future.

The elder nodded and announced, “If there are others like him present, I’d advise you to come out and admit it sooner rather than later. Pill Valley is always kind to others, so we won’t kill you. If you stand out now, we can let bygones be bygones. But if anyone tries to sneak in still, the only thing for you will be death. Does anyone dare to blaspheme the might of the gods?”

The statues of Lord Brahma and Fallen Daynight were right there, giving off endless pressure. Thunder rumbled with the elder’s final words.

“The might of gods my ass. Who are they conning? If I hadn’t pissed on their heads before, I might even believe it.” Long Chen’s lip curled.

However, over ten experts slowly walked out of the crowd due to the elder’s words, apologizing.

The elder didn’t get angry. Instead, he had them stand to the side, saying that someone would come to register them.

“Idiots. Once the rest of us go in, they’ll show you their true face.” Long Chen sighed. The first person was definitely an actor arranged by Pill Valley. He might have looked terrified, but his heartbeat hadn’t changed at all. Such a poor performance was actually able to dupe people? Long Chen was speechless.

This world truly had many idiots. It seemed that there weren’t enough conners. Hence, Long Chen couldn’t understand how they had managed to live for so long. It was definitely a miracle.

“I’ll give you a single breath’s time. If you still don’t come out and we find out you’re lying, it will be viewed as a blasphemy to the gods. The only thing remaining for you will be death. I’m not afraid of telling you this: based on the information we’ve received, Long Chen has already snuck amongst your midst. Today, we want to make sure that there’s no way he can leave.” The elder smiled confidently.

Hearing this, Long Chen’s heart skipped a beat. Had he really fallen for a trap?

Just at this moment, a startled cry rang out from a woman, and Long Chen recognized her as Qi Xuan. Her big sister, Qi Fengxue, was beside her. They came from the Heaven Reaching Ancient Castle.

Qi Xuan had jumped in shock at the elder’s words, drawing countless gazes. Qi Fengxue pulled her over, and Qi Xuan acted like she had made a mistake, lowering her head and not daring to look at the others.

Seeing Qi Xuan, Long Chen’s heart warmed. This girl was naive and pure. She was like a child.

He had once traveled with her for some time, and she had always remembered that favor. The reason she had cried out was because she was worried for him.

After that brief disturbance, the elder’s gaze rapidly roved around the crowd. “Let’s continue!”

More geniuses began to step forward to test their identity. However, there was now a heavy atmosphere.

Some of them were looking around sharply, looking like they were intent on finding Long Chen amongst the crowd.

A tall tree attracts wind. Long Chen was that tall tree. He was given the name of the number one figure of the junior generation. He was viewed with envy by countless experts, and they refused to accept that he was superior to them. They wanted to take his place.

Several people hoped to be able to personally end Long Chen’s undefeatable legend. However, even as their gazes roved around, Long Chen acted indifferently, simply slowly walking forward.

Suddenly, the formation shook. A Life Star disciple was blasted apart by a ray of divine light just as he took out his tablet.

“Hmph, I gave you a chance just now, but you didn’t cherish it, still wanting to sneak in. Fool,” sneered the elder.

That disciple had clearly been an imposter. He had been seen through and killed by the formation.

This formation was linked to the two divine statues. The divine might that had descended just now made people’s hair stand on end. That kind of power was absolutely terrifying.

The few experts that had been dissatisfied with Pill Valley’s stringent verification process finally shut their mouths and obediently followed instructions.

Over a million experts slowly went through. Finally, it was Long Chen’s turn. Long Chen handed his tablet to one of the Elders in charge of the investigation.

Suddenly, the void rumbled and the formation activated once more.
