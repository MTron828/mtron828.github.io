Chapter 4280: Do Not Chase Cornered Enemies

Ye Wuchen was slain without having the slightest chance to resist. A generation’s genius died just like that.

Long Aotian was crippled, Lian Wuying’s condition was unknown, and now Ye Wuchen was slain in one blow. Somehow, even peak heavenly geniuses appeared extremely weak in front of Long Chen.

“Long Chen, the Ye clan can no longer exist underneath the same heavens as you!”

The Ye clan’s experts roared furiously, but they were not attacking Long Chen and were just watching.

After all, the Ye clan was one of the human race’s eight great Eternal clans. Just like the Long clan, they represented the human race, and so they couldn’t attack Long Chen at this time.

When Long Aotian and Ye Wuchen attacked Long Chen, it could be regarded as a competition to get more karmic luck, which was an integral aspect of the martial path. Even if some people felt that they were going too far, they were in no position to criticize them.

However, it was different for the senior experts. If they were to attack, it would not be part of the struggle of the martial path. It would be slaughtering their own race, and they would be denounced.

This was also the reason why that human race’s half-step Eternal expert had worn a mask to cover his face before attacking Long Chen.

The Ye clan’s camp was rather far from the battlefield, and they neither attacked nor assisted Long Chen. As a result, they were in no position to save Ye Wuchen once he was in danger.

“Don’t offend me, or you won’t even get a chance to beg for mercy.” Long Chen snorted and swung the Seven Peak Sword, pointing it at Zhao Xingtian.

Zhao Xingtian’s soul almost fled out of his body. No longer caring about face, he turned and fled like a stray dog. That was quite the wretched appearance.

With Zhao Xingtian making a hasty retreat, the Zhao clan’s experts followed suit. In fact, most of the Eternal clans, including the Long and Ye clans, also chose to depart from the scene.

Long Chen then pointed his sword at the heavens, causing countless experts to flee in terror. Once the human race’s experts had fled, the other races also retreated, fully terrified of Long Chen.

“Long Chen, don’t let them escape! Kill them. Don’t worry, even if you’re out of energy later, your big bro will lift you up. I don’t dare to say anything else, but if I want to bring you away, not even an Eternal expert would be able to stop me,” transmitted Mo Nian.

“Do you think that I don’t want to kill them? I’m already out of energy. Think of a way to run soon,” responded Long Chen irritably.

In truth, Long Chen had long since run out of energy. If it hadn’t been for Long Aotian essentially delivering himself on a silver platter, Long Chen would have fainted long ago.

Long Chen had saved the Purgatory Eyes just for Long Aotian. After reclaiming his Spirit Blood, Spirit Root, and Spirit Bone, Long Chen found that he was in far too weak of a state. As a result, he had only managed to merge with his seven-color Supreme Blood.

He didn’t even have the energy to assimilate with his violet blood, as merging with the seven-color Supreme Blood had used up a huge amount of his Spiritual Strength. Also, with his energy reserves, he had barely managed to do that and still couldn’t fully control it.

If it wasn’t because the seven-color Supreme Blood originally belonged to him, there was no way he would be able to control its immense power.

However, that was already his limit. After killing Ye Wuchen, he was out of energy and could only put on a tough appearance.

In fact, due to his exhausted soul, whether or not he could maintain his current condition was already difficult to say.

“Damn, no way!” Mo Nian was startled. Long Chen’s powerful aura had even tricked him. He had thought that Long Chen had managed to undergo a phoenix-like rebirth upon merging back with his Spirit Blood, Spirit Root, and Spirit Bone.

Unexpectedly, his current appearance was fake, and no one had noticed this. They were all too terrified by Long Chen to even see through any clues.

“To tell you the truth, although I managed to reclaim what is mine, I only have half of my energy left. If you want to kill me, just come. I want to see just how many of you I can drag down with me. Long Aotian, Lian Wuying, and Ye Wuchen, if I can kill another hundred geniuses like them, I suppose leaving my life behind would still be worth it,” announced Long Chen.

These words horrified countless people. If Long Chen had said that he was in his peak condition, perhaps some of them would still have enough wits to doubt him. But by saying that he only had half a tank left, people had no choice but to believe him. With his terrifying killing power, who knew just how many people he could drag down with him?

Even half-step Eternals were slain by him, so who could stop him? Even if all the experts here were to charge forward together, they might not be enough to exhaust Long Chen.

Even if they could kill Long Chen, most of them would likely die in the process. While everyone harbored a desire to capitalize on the situation, no one was willing to make the first move. Those who dared to do so would be the first to die.

Their desire to kill Long Chen stemmed from various reasons. On one hand, they didn’t want a peak expert to rise within the human race, and on the other, they wanted to test their luck and seize the karmic luck bead.

Thus, when they had flocked over before, they had viewed Long Chen as a flab of fat meat that their mouths watered over. But now, they knew that in front of Long Chen, they were the prey.

“Brothers, it’s our turn to kill, to avenge our fallen brothers and sisters!”

Seeing that the enemy experts had retreated and paused at a certain range as if hesitating, Mo Nian suddenly raised his arms and shouted. He then raised his bow and shot toward those experts.

The experts on the Dragonblood Legion’s side were baffled. Avenge their fallen brothers and sisters? Up to now, although they had many injuries, it didn’t seem that anyone was slain, right?

However, with Mo Nian taking the lead, they began to raise their own weapons and roared, charging over with Mo Nian.

When the Dragonblood Legion came charging over with their weapons raised, those experts’ expressions finally changed, and they fled for their lives.

“Do not chase cornered enemies!”

At this moment, Long Chen acted as if victory was already in grasp and shouted for everyone to stop chasing.

“Why? Why not kill them all?! The blood of our brothers and sisters cannot be spilled for nothing!” roared Mo Nian. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

Long Chen almost broke character. This fellow’s acting skills were definitely not inferior to his graverobbing abilities.

However, Long Chen couldn’t break character now. Acting solemn, he replied, “They’re nothing more than a group of ants. Killing them is meaningless.”

Long Chen beckoned, and the Dragonblood warriors flew away with Long Chen, pulling away from the battlefield.

Once they were away, they would no longer be affected by the ripples of the battle between half-step Eternals. Either Xia Chen or Bai Xiaole could use a formation or pupil art to transport them away instantly.

After that, they really would be the fish that had leaped over the sea and become a flying bird. Long Chen’s heart was filled with anticipation.

However, he didn’t dare to retreat too fast, as that would make some people think that he was just scaring them. If any half-step Eternal experts were to test him, he would be fully exposed.

Hence, Long Chen was comforted to see that as they slowly left, no experts pursued them. Long Chen finally sighed with relief.

As soon as he did, he felt like the world was spinning around him, a clear sign of his soul being overdrafted. However, he kept his act up, forcing himself not to collapse.

He didn’t even let Meng Qi help him, or that would also expose him. Just as Long Chen was bitterly enduring and had reached the edge of the battlefield, space twisted.

Three figures appeared in front of them at once. When they appeared, Long Chen sighed inside.

“Not good.”
