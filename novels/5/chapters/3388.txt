Chapter 3377 Sudden Change

The grand formation was activated to its maximum power, and countless runes condensed. After that, a mighty aura rose.

Long Chen himself was shocked. The elder that he had slapped had been pierced in the chest by this strange lifeform.

That lifeform’s sharp claws gleamed coldly, and its body was somewhat similar to a human. However, its clothes were worn and torn, and the flesh within those clothes was already rotting. It emitted surges of black qi, like some ancient corpse that had crawled out of a tomb.

“The Ghost Dao’s aura!”

Long Chen was shocked. At this moment, more lifeforms were appearing, and their auras were identical to the lifeforms he had encountered on the Ghost Ship. Ghost qi swirled around them. Just looking at that ghost qi gave people a piercing pain in their souls. It was as if they could smell the scent of death and decay.

The void then exploded and countless lifeforms began to appear like a flood. As for the slapped elder, he screamed and was devoured by those lifeforms.

Countless lifeforms of the Ghost Dao charged the city and smashed into the formation, exploding and transforming into corrosive dust. Despite that, they continued to pour out, with more coming behind them. It was as if they were crazy.

Behind this army of the Ghost Dao, Long Chen saw a long spatial crack. Their army was pouring out of there.

They were crazily attacking the formation, simply throwing their numbers at it. Ear-piercing cries split the air. Just watching their crazy appearance gave Long Chen the chills.

“Fuck, what is going on?!” shouted Long Chen.

“Junior brother, we have encountered the hunters of the Ghost Dao. The grand formation won’t last that long. Hurry and beg your master for aid. Otherwise, we’ll all die!” One of the gods practically begged Long Chen. He was their only hope.

The hunters of the Ghost Dao were like leopards from the ghost world. They roamed the edges between the Netherworld and the ghost world. In packs, they waited for the barriers between worlds to rub against each other and then tore through the void to hunt.

They cultivated through devouring the Netherworld’s lifeforms. Furthermore, smelling the scent of the Netherworld’s lifeforms drove them crazy with greed. They would become completely unafraid of death.

Although their individual power wasn’t very strong, they had terrifyingly sharp claws and teeth. Once wounded, the invasion of ghost qi was something that even gods couldn’t endure.

As more of them poured out, the formation was visibly starting to dim. Although countless Ghost Dao lifeforms had been destroyed by the formation, it didn’t stop the rest from charging forward crazily. They were truly unafraid of death.

Long Chen looked at these Ghost Dao hunters. Some were humanoid, and some had beast form. They came in all kinds of forms. Their eyes already dried up, but they still stared at them like bloodthirsty beasts that had been starving for countless years. The urgent desire to quench their thirst was so powerful that others were terrified just watching them.

“Junior brother, don’t hesitate! Once the city is broken into, we’ll all die! What else are you waiting for?” Those gods all shouted in a panic when they saw Long Chen just staring at those lifeforms thoughtfully.

“Do I need you to tell me that? I’ve already asked my master for aid. I trust that it won’t be long before that help arrives. No need to worry,” said Long Chen.

Hearing that, the five of them seemed to feel much more at ease. Long Chen had now become their only hope. In order to buy more time, the five of them spread their arms. Divine light flowed out of their hands and into the formation. They used their own Nethergod energy to support the formation.

With their support, the formation brightened. Countless lifeforms crashed into it and died. It seemed that they could still endure for a while.

As for Long Chen, he was extremely worried. What if Leng Yueyan and the others had encountered these lifeforms as well? He was currently isolated from the rest of the world by the formation. He had no way of communicating with them here, and he could not think of any good ideas.

Suddenly, two of the experts coughed up blood. Their auras plummeted and their expressions completely changed.

“Not good! The divine cores in our domains have been broken!” The two of them shouted in shock and fury, as well as terror.

It seemed that Leng Yueyan and Ming Cangyue had made their move at the same time, crushing them at the same time. That meant that things on those two sides were going according to plan. They hadn’t encountered an attack from the Ghost Dao.

“Don’t panic! Perhaps your territories were also sneak attacked. Hold on. My master will quickly save us!” shouted Long Chen.

Having lost their divine cores, those two were severely weakened. Their auras dropped by more than thirty percent.

Hearing that, the two of them didn’t overthink it. Right now, protecting their lives was more important. They continued supporting the grand formation.

They were anxious, but Long Chen was even more anxious. If Leng Yueyan and the others continued according to the plan, they would soon reach this place.

When they saw that he was trapped, they would definitely go all-out to save him. Eyeing this endless army, he shook his head.

The aura coming from these lifeforms could not be judged according to the realms of the human race. They seemed to simply be corpses. Supposedly, they must have been very terrifying lifeforms when they were alive.

Right now, they were a little more than skin and bones. Some didn’t possess the slightest trace of blood and were essentially skeletons. Those that did possess some flesh clearly had slightly stronger auras.

As for that lifeform that had struck the slain elder, it seemed to possess a certain intelligence. It didn’t charge the formation. It was constantly howling, ordering the other lifeforms to attack.

Through his examination, he also noticed that the ones that had devoured the elder seemed to have a bit more Blood Qi energy. That showed why these lifeforms would go so crazy for the Netherworld’s experts. After devouring them, they would be nourished by their flesh, and their own bodies would regain some flesh, making them stronger.

At this moment, another elder coughed up blood. His divine core was also broken. Leng Yueyan and Ming Cangyue had attacked the next two targets.

The other divine core had to belong to that elder that had been consumed. Now Long Chen was even more anxious.DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

Just then, the formation began to shudder. Countless cracks appeared on it.

“Hold on! You must hold on! My master will quickly arrive!” shouted Long Chen.

But they were truly unable to. One of the lifeforms suddenly bit down on the barrier, striking it right at its weakest spot and tearing open a hole.

Countless lifeforms came flying into the barrier. The city’s experts cried out.

BOOM!

Just then, the barrier shattered. The flood of Ghost Dao lifeforms howled and flooded over them from all directions.
