Chapter 2666 Heaven String, Earth String

Sovereign Han Wei’s five-string Heavenly Dao zither was destroyed just like this. Where did the Nine-Headed Lion get this power from?

“What dogshit Sovereign, you’re only at this level!” sneered the Nine-Headed Lion. He then unleashed a second punch at Sovereign Han Wei.

“He’s using the power of his world to fight Sovereign Han Wei!” A startled cry rang out from a sharp observer. The power being unleashed by the Nine-Headed Lion was completely foreign. It was not part of the Martial Heaven Continent.

After the five-string zither was destroyed, Sovereign Han Wei’s expression finally turned cold. Killing intent exploded within her.

“You dare to interfere in my transmission of the Dao? You’ve lived for nothing.”

Sovereign Han Wei then clapped her hands, and violet qi exploded. Right away, the five-string Heavenly Dao zither reappeared with another string added to it. As that string manifested, the entire Martial Heaven Sea-Ring shuddered, and people could feel the power of the earth gathering.

After that, yet another string formed and the Heavenly Daos rumbled. Everyone could feel the might of the heavens descending, merging with the power of the earth.

The five strings became seven strings. In that instant, the entire world seemed to have merged into one body. The seven-string zither represented the heavens, the earth, and everything in between.

Sovereign Han Wei’s hands rested upon the zither strings, causing heaven and earth to quiver. After that, the Martial Heaven Sea-Ring beneath their feet exploded, unleashing pillars of water into the heavens.

Long Chen’s heart pounded. Although he hadn’t studied the Music Dao, with how long he had known Zi Yan, he had some understanding of it. Legend had it that the zither was the first musical instrument ever born. The five-string zither was the most primitive zither.

The five-string zither had five notes, which represented the five elements, metal, wood, water, fire, and earth.

The person who created this zither was called the Zither Ancestor, someone who had managed to condense the music of heaven and earth into an instrument. As music filled the world, emotions began to sublimate. The Dao of Music was born at this time.

While some said that the zither was the earliest musical instrument, others argued that the bell came first. However, the ancient records about the bell showed that it was always used in battle, something to push people to fight and transmit orders on the battlefield. It was filled with the feel of slaughter and bloodiness. As a result, the other side argued it should not be viewed as a musical instrument.

Since that was the case, all those who cultivated the Music Dao revered the zither as the first musical instrument. The five-string zither had continued in that state for who knew how long until a grandmaster of the Music Dao one day comprehended the essence of heaven and earth and added another string to the zither, turning it into the six-string zither.

After obtaining another note, the six-string zither was more mellow and well-rounded. It contained endless variations and thrumming vitality. It was like spring had returned to the earth, nourishing all life. All in all, the appearance of the six-string zither enriched the Music Dao and brought forth countless streams of thought.

After another unknown number of years, another grandmaster appeared, adding another string, turning it into the seven-string zither.

The addition of this string caused the zither music to change once more. At that moment, music resonated throughout heaven and earth, and this resonance allowed one to control the Dao. By using the Music Dao to reach the Heavenly Daos, it opened a gate to becoming one with the heavens. Cultivators could then live as long as the heavens and earth, becoming immortal.

After that invention, countless geniuses of the Music Dao appeared. They were like budding leaves, and all kinds of instruments followed, all manifesting their own Daos.

However, no matter how startling the geniuses were, they were never able to add another string to the seven-string zither. As a result, the seven-string zither became settled, with no one capable of changing it.

It was only when the third generation Zither Ancestor added the third string that it was understood that the first five strings represented the five elements, the five phases of philosophy, the five organs, the five virtues, the five spiritual beasts, etc. They contained the principles of the foundation of the world. The string that the second generation Zither Ancestor added was called the earth string. It contained all things within the earth. With this string, all things had a foundation, giving the music even greater spirituality. As for the third generation Zither Ancestor, the string that they added was called the heaven string. It was what correlated with the earth string. If the earth gave rise to all life, then it was the laws of the Heavenly Daos that added restrictions, balancing it. Only then could each individual give birth to their own Daos.

The heaven string and the earth string complemented each other, while the five strings evolved within their parallels. From then on, there was no start nor end, no outside and inside. There was simply the Dao.

As a result, no one else, no matter how talented, was capable of changing this seven-string zither. It was the ultimate form of the zither.

When Sovereign Han Wei’s seven-string zither appeared, it caused the heavens, the earth, and all Daos in between to resonate. These seven strings represented the entire world.

As Sovereign Han Wei’s hand touched the sixth string, the earth string, the Martial Heaven Sea-Ring exploded. After that, a blade of space slashed out from down below, cutting apart the Martial Heaven Sea-Ring to strike the Nine-Headed Lion.

Seeing this scene, the Nine-Headed Lion roared and smashed his fist downward. However, he was like a bug striking a heavenly blade.

The chains covering his body shattered, and he coughed up a mouthful of blood, his body badly mangled.

Just at this moment, the heaven string twanged. An invisible blade sliced apart the heavens toward the Nine-Headed Lion.

Right now, the Nine-Headed Lion’s soul almost fled out of terror. His World Divine Chains had been broken, and he had no time to restore them. If he was struck by the heavenly blade, not even a hundred lives would be enough.

Just as he felt regret about deciding to target Sovereign Han Wei instead of properly fighting Long Chen, the void rumbled.

A giant heavenly gate opened. However, this was not the heavenly gate of the tribulation but a different gate. Right now, the energy of a completely different world poured out of it, surging toward the Nine-Headed Lion.

BOOM!

The heavenly blade struck the Nine-Headed Lion, and he smashed into the sea like a meteorite. Countless corpses flew out of the sea from the impact.

Those corpses belonged to the sea demon race. Sovereign Han Wei’s earth string attack had destroyed quite a few formations that the sea demon race had set up at the depths of the sea.

These layers of defenses had been set up by the sea demon experts to block Long Chen’s tribulation. They were on high alert to prevent him from attacking.

However, they hadn’t expected Sovereign Han Wei’s attack to end up implicating them. Anything that blade of the earth had passed was destroyed.

Furthermore, the heavenly blade continued to cleave the Martial Heaven Sea-Ring after striking the Nine-Headed Lion, killing even more experts of the sea demon race. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

At this moment, Gu Yang and the others sent people to gather those corpses. Long Chen had previously told them that he needed a large number of corpses. Hence, all the disciples of the Martial Heaven Alliance were mobilized.

Suddenly, the sea exploded and the Nine-Headed Lion reappeared. His eyes were scarlet and he was covered in blood. However, his World Divine Chains had condensed once more, and his aura was even stronger than before.

At that critical moment, he had had no choice but to open the gate to his world to support his World Divine Chains. Otherwise, Sovereign Han Wei’s attack would have taken his life.

When he flew out of the sea, he looked at Sovereign Han Wei and then at Long Chen. After that, with a furious roar, he charged at Long Chen. It seemed that of the two, he felt that Long Chen was a bit easier.

“Fuck, you’re treating me as a soft persimmon?” Long Chen’s fury instantly exploded.
