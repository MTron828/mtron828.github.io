Chapter 3851 Dual Blood

This punch shocked everyone. Before this, no matter what Long Chen did, he was unable to cause any substantial wounds to Long Aotian.

However, this time, he managed to make Long Aotian hack up blood. But they were unable to sense any change in his aura.

All they saw was nine hundred and ninety-nine stars appear on his fist. In fact, when they appeared, everyone vaguely sensed that Long Chen’s aura seemed to weaken slightly.

In truth, when Long Chen drew the power of the stars into his body, he was using the astral energy that existed beyond the heavens. This power wasn’t Long Chen’s power, so he could only use it. He was unable to reach the level of absolute control.

When this power was concentrated to the peak, even Long Chen couldn’t control it, and Long Aotian’s dark energy was unable to devour it.

Thus, Long Chen’s fist solidly struck Long Aotian. His arms were broken and he hacked up blood. Cracks appeared in the space behind him. This punch seemed to almost cause heaven and earth to explode.

This one punch instantly reversed the tides. However, seeing Long Aotian coughing up blood, Long Chen’s heart pounded wildly.

“Violet blood?!”Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

The blood that Long Aotian hacked up was actually violet. The violet was a bit illusory, seemingly spiritual. There seemed to be invisible runes flowing within it.

When this violet blood was spat out, it transformed into illusory violet qi that enveloped Long Aotian and slowly merged back into his body.

“Violet Blood race?! Impossible! Other than seven-color Supreme Blood, he also possesses the Supreme Blood of the Violet Blood race?!” exclaimed Yin Changsheng.

The moment this violet blood appeared, a Supreme qi filled the air. That aura was not at all weaker than the aura of his seven-color Supreme Blood. A single person possessing two kinds of Supreme Blood? How could that be?

It wasn’t just Yin Changsheng and the others. Even Yue Xiaoqian and the others couldn’t believe their eyes. Just what kind of heaven-defying opportunities had Long Aotian encountered in the immortal world to come to possess violet blood?

It had to be known that the only ones in this world with violet essence blood were the members of the Violet Blood race. No other race possessed this attribute.

The Violet Blood race was one of the strongest races during the human race’s peak. It was on par with the Jiuli and Heavenly Eye races. They were existences that suppressed all other races. After all, the Violet Blood race was one of the human race’s most ancient, most powerful bloodlines. Its fame was unmatched.

Long Chen was also glaring at that violet blood, his eyes full of hatred. He knew that this violet blood was his. More accurately, it came from his mother.

If his Supreme Blood came from his father, then this violet blood came from his mother. He hadn’t expected this violet blood to also awaken within Long Aotian’s body.

This all should have been his. They were the gifts his father and mother had left for him, but these gifts were what caused their family of three to be separated. Seeing this violet blood caused him to think of his mother. How could he not be enraged?

“AHH!”

Long Chen let out a roar. It was like the roar of a wounded beast. It shattered Grand Dao runes, causing them to fall from the sky like rain.

Long Chen was furious. He thought of his father. He thought of his mother. He thought of how he had grown up without them. Because of this, his killing intent caused even the laws of the Heavenly Daos to change. At that moment, he was like a god of slaughter that had come from the depths of hell.

“Are you angry? Hahaha!” Long Aotian laughed when he saw black marks appear in Long Chen’s murderous eyes. The angrier Long Chen was, the happier he became.

“Your current expression is very satisfying. I didn’t misjudge. This violet blood is also your Supreme Blood. You are the rarest dual Supreme Blood possessor. The Long clan’s patriarchs even said that my violet blood’s purity has reached the pinnacle. That is why even though my seven-color Supreme Blood is so powerful, it does not manage to assimilate my violet blood. Both of them complement each other to give off unimaginable power. It is precisely due to this that awakening my dual Supreme Bloods is thousands of times more difficult than others. Even the Long clan was only able to help me reach this extent after exhausting all their resources. To fully awaken my dual Supreme Blood will require a huge amount of primal chaos qi, which is why I came here. But I really am fortunate to listen to the patriarchs’ arrangements. Do you know? At the same time as the three thousand worlds opened, the Heavenly Origin World also opened. That is also an ancient desolate world with primal chaos qi. The Long clan’s immemorial ruins are located there, and the Long clan’s inheritance can also be obtained there. But the patriarchs were worried that there wasn’t enough primal chaos qi there to activate my Spirit Blood, Spirit Root, and Spirit Bone, so they made me come here. Now thinking about it, it really is the workings of fate. The heavens want me to kill you to avenge my father and mother.” Long Aotian smiled. That smile was twisted with killing intent.

“No, you’re wrong. This is the heavens telling me to take back what is mine.” Long Chen clenched his teeth. No longer wasting more words, he charged at Long Aotian.

There was no flashiness; it was simple and direct. Another fist smashed down, and it could not be simpler. It was entirely a competition of power.

“Violet Blood Dyes the Heavens, Limitless Magical Power!” Long Aotian raised his head and roared. After that, a pair of violet wings suddenly appeared on his back. They were made entirely of his essence blood. The moment that they appeared, divine light turned this world violet.

Within this violet world was also a black and white world, and in front of this black and white world was Long Aotian’s five-colored figure. Three kinds of forces layered on top of each other, so beautiful divine light flew about. Long Aotian was like a divine bird cutting through the void toward Long Chen.

“This is my strongest state. I will teach you what true power is!” Long Aotian laughed arrogantly.

BOOM!

Heaven and earth were torn apart, while the stars in the sky shook. Long Chen and Long Aotian were both blown back.

“Heavens, the Heavenly Boundary Line!!!”

A startled cry rang out. This collision actually caused cracks to appear in the Heavenly Boundary Line.

Both of them were even with this exchange; neither was able to suppress the other. The two had just been blown back when they once more crashed toward each other.

“DIE!”

The two of them both shouted, and the void beneath their feet exploded. They crashed together like stars.

Both of them had scarlet eyes as they fought, creating a chaotic zone around them. In this zone, the light of the stars quivered, and Blood Qi gushed out. The two of them were surrounded by a giant domain of death.

“What kind of power is this?!”

The Sacred Pill Hall and the devil race’s experts were completely horrified by what they were seeing. They had unleashed all their power to defend against these astral winds, but still felt waves of pressure crashing down on them. It felt like they might be crushed at any moment.

All of them were Supreme experts, but they were more like ants here. This was an immense blow to their ego.

“Not good, Long Chen is enraged! He’s going all-out now! Victory or defeat will be decided soon. We don’t have much time. We have to quicken the pace!”

Seeing the Heavenly Boundary Line rumbling and cracking, Mo Nian had a bad feeling. He hastily sent the Thousand Illusion Spirit Coffin toward the next coffin just as silently as they had with the first.
