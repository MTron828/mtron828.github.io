Chapter 2606 The Evil Hand

Long Chen had Evilmoon stabbing through the elder of the divine families’ chest. Right now, black runes lit up on top of Evilmoon, filled with explosive power ready to be unleashed at any moment.

Even if that elder was a Heaven Merging expert, his life was still in Long Chen’s hands.

Seven other elders were just a few feet away from Long Chen, but they came to a sudden stop, not daring to attack.

Although they detested Long Chen, they knew that he was a madman. He had even killed a Sovereign sprout, so he wouldn’t be afraid of killing one of their Heaven Merging Elders.

In fact, this Elder belonged to the Zhao family, so he naturally hated Long Chen to the bone. Their side had been extremely unwilling from the start to have Long Chen be invited here to chat.

However, he had never dreamed that Long Chen would be able to ignore their bloodline pressure with the Azure Dragon Battle Armor. He was also the unlucky one to be standing closest to Long Chen.

“Scram!” Long Chen barked at the other elders. He then spun the unlucky elder around, forcing those elders back.

“Long Chen, hurry and release Elder Zhao Xing!” roared those elders.

In response, Long Chen slapped the elder in his hand thirty-six times, and this happened in the blink of an eye. No one else was capable of face-slapping someone so smoothly, not even a Sovereign.

After all the slaps, that Elder fell unconscious, and his head was no longer in a proper form. His face was no longer recognizable.

On the other hand, Long Chen’s killing intent was soaring. Calling him a half-breed was insulting his parents. After finishing his slaps, rather than sating his fury, Evilmoon’s light suddenly grew.

“Stop!”

The various elders had thought that things would turn to negotiations once Long Chen’s slaps were done, but Long Chen was going completely off conventional reasoning. He was going to kill his hostage.

Suddenly, space twisted. Just as Evilmoon’s power erupted, the elder vanished.

Everyone was startled and turned to the front of the plaza to see a new group of people. Their leader was a square-faced middle-aged man in violet-gold robes. He wore a crown and a jade belt. Divine runes flickered within his eyes whenever he blinked.

When he arrived, it felt like spacetime had been taken control over. It was as if all fluctuations within heaven and earth existed only for him. The world’s laws seemed to revolve around him.

This was a terrifying expert that could not be described with simple words. He was holding the Elder that Long Chen had been about to kill.

“Greetings, Lord Venerate!”

All the elders bowed toward him. This was the divine families’ Lord Venerate.

Beside him were a few dozen people who had come with him. Amongst them were Feng Fei, Long Aotian, Ye Liangchen, and Jiang Wuchen.

At this moment, Feng Fei was looking at Long Chen expressionlessly. It wasn’t an expression of hatred, nor was it one of friendliness. She was still the same arrogant Feng Fei.

As for Long Aotian, he was rather cold, simply staring at Long Chen indifferently. His expression didn’t reveal anything, but there was an iciness in his eyes. Long Chen’s actions last time had been extremely unsatisfactory to him. He had been sent to help Long Chen, but Long Chen had treated him as an enemy.

Furthermore, for some reason, Long Aotian felt uneasy when it came to Long Chen, and this made him dislike Long Chen even more. Although the Long family wished for him to have a good relationship with Long Chen and pull him to their side, Long Aotian was extremely displeased with those orders, especially considering that Long Chen had cost the divine families their face.

However, since Long Aotian stood on the side of the Long family, he couldn’t push Long Chen away. So he didn’t display kindness or malice toward Long Chen. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

As for Ye Liangchen and Jiang Wuchen, their gazes were as sharp as swords. They were clearly overflowing with hostility toward Long Chen, especially Ye Liangchen who didn’t bother to conceal his killing intent.

Last time, he hadn’t been able to unleash his full power, allowing Long Chen to take the spotlight. That battle had allowed Long Chen’s fame to soar.

Experts always trampled over other people’s corpses and dignity to advance. But no one was willing to be someone else’s stepping stone, especially not people like Ye Liangchen and Jiang Wuchen.

For Ye Liangchen in particular, being trapped by Huo Linger and not even managing to have a direct clash against Long Chen was a humiliation. In the outside world, it appeared as if he and Jiang Wuchen had joined hands and still hadn’t managed to match Long Chen. That drove him crazy.

The Ye family had gone all-out to force the Martial Heaven Alliance to pay, but the Lord Saint had suppressed things, so Ye Liangchen had no other choice but to temporarily suppress his anger.

“Heaven Executioner, this person has violated the divine families’ taboos and lost our face. You should know what to do,” said the Lord Venerate. His voice was deep and powerful.

“Disciple understands. I will immediately activate the execution coffin.” A person behind the Lord Venerate stepped up.

This person’s skin was pale, and his voice was soft, almost like a woman’s. Moreover, his body was slender, and his aura was also on the Yin side. As soon as he spoke, Long Chen trembled. He stared in shock at that man.

The man was reaching out to grab the Elder when he sensed Long Chen’s reaction, so he turned to look at him. His gaze was sinister like a viper’s.

Furthermore, his aura was completely bizarre. He was like a spirit from the underworld coming to reap people’s lives.

Long Chen’s heart pounded wildly. It was him, definitely him. This voice and his slender hands were identical. Long Chen had seen that pair of cruel hands take away his Spirit Blood, Spirit Root, and Spirit Bone. He had seen it in Future Lake back then, and he would never be able to forget it.

“Long Chen, calm down!” Evilmoon’s voice resounded through Long Chen’s mind, waking him up from his shock and fury.

“What? Do you know me?” asked the strange man.

Long Chen suppressed his fury and coldly said, “Yes, of course I know the divine families’ executioner. I’ve long since heard that you are a bloody and merciless killer. Ye Yaochen brought you up when I was in front of the Yin Yang World. However, I didn’t expect that this existence which inspires terror in people was actually someone who was not a man or woman.”

At this moment, every expert present sucked in a cold gasp of air. They stared at the Heaven Executioner, waiting for his reaction.

The Heaven Executioner. This wasn’t a name but a title. It was the highest level of authority within the divine families’ law enforcement division.

The Heaven Executioner was an existence almost all members of the divine families were terrified of. He was called cold-blooded, merciless, and incomparably cruel because he had an almost perverted desire for torture. All those who had fallen into his hands regretted being born in this world.

The Heaven Executioner had strange desires when it came to the human body, especially to those with special abilities. It was said that his private room was filled with people’s organs. Those people that the divine families had executed were all ‘studied’ by him.

Other than a few people that could be counted, everyone in the divine families was afraid of this fiendish existence. Hence, for Long Chen to call him not a man or woman stunned them all. At the same time, quite a few people felt some admiration that he would dare to say the words that they did not dare to say.

“Little fellow, I’m very interested in you.”

The Heaven Executioner smiled. He whisked away the Elder and vanished.

“Lord Venerate, Elder Zhao Xing was simply overwhelmed by a moment of anger. His words were a bit emotional. But Long Chen…” The Zhao family head immediately spoke up for Elder Zhao Xing’s mercy. In fact, even the family heads couldn’t offend the Heaven Executioner, because being targeted by him was frightening. Their fear for him even surpassed their fear for the Lord Venerate. Therefore, the Zhao family head only spoke up once the Heaven Executioner was gone. As for the execution coffin, it was the divine families’ most humane death sentence. A person would have their soul slowly extinguished inside. They would fall unconscious and not feel the slightest pain.

“Elder Zhao Xing ignored the orders of the Lord Saint. Death is too easy for him. The ones who previously insulted Long Chen can go see the Heaven Executioner themselves for the flogging punishment.” The Lord Venerate waved his hand, disregarding the Zhao family head’s pleading.

The people who had previously insulted Long Chen all turned ashen. They didn’t dare to say anything though, so they left without another word.

The other Elders’ expressions also changed. The Lord Venerate was truly enraged. He had killed one Elder and punished dozens of others. Hence, everyone was silent.

Quite a few people rejoiced that they hadn’t said anything. As expected, calamity came from the mouth.

At this moment, the Zhao family head’s expression was ugly, but she could only sit back down. She then glared at Long Chen with rancor that almost turned solid.

“Do you have any complaints about how I handled things?” The Lord Venerate turned to Long Chen, speaking surprisingly politely. This shocked everyone.

Long Chen put away Evilmoon and smiled. “Nice job. First a show of might, and then killing the chicken to warn the monkey. Not only that, you’re also killing two birds with one stone. How could I have any complaints?”

How could Long Chen not see through the Lord Venerate’s intentions? The Lord Venerate had to have been here from the start. Why had he waited until Long Chen had been about to kill that elder?

It was because if Long Chen killed him, it would lose the face of the divine families. But by doing it himself, he gave a show of power, not to Long Chen, but to the other Elders of the divine families. Essentially, he had also used Long Chen.

The Long family’s Deputy Elder shook his head. Long Chen was still too young. How could he directly say such words? Was this not provoking the Lord Venerate?

However, unexpectedly, the Lord Venerate smiled. “As long as you can see my sincerity, then it's fine. Why don’t we have a proper conversation now?”
