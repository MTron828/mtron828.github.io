Chapter 3216 Immortal King Zichuan

When Long Chen stepped onto the ninety-first stair, he felt heaven and earth twisting around him, and even the scenery around him vanished from sight. Everything around him was in chaos. He felt wild winds and flickering lightning.

“This is Heavenly Dao energy?”

Long Chen hadn’t expected this. The Honing Heavenly Staircase was actually controlling Heavenly Dao energy. Its heavenly might was not much inferior to his own heavenly tribulation.

Furthermore, this heavenly might was tearing at his body, grinding away at his will and corroding his soul, trying to make him admit defeat.

The moment he stepped foot on this stair, he felt as if he had turned transparent. Foreign power pierced through his body, while his flesh and soul were undergoing a painful grinding. The more he resisted, the greater that power.

However, Long Chen’s will was firm. He ignored this pain and continued climbing.

With every step he took, the Honing Heavenly Staircase shuddered. It was as if the world was rocking with it. In the distance, the Luo family’s experts watched nervously.

“The ninety-fifth stair.”

Luo Xue clenched her fists tightly. Long Chen had gone so far. He was only a bit off from the top. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

Long Chen’s dragon scales were now glowing. Waves of dragon might came from them, and a dragon roar rang out, mixing with the roaring of the Heavenly Daos.

At some point, black clouds roiling with lightning had appeared in the sky. The might of the heavens shook people’s souls.

“I heard that starting at the ninetieth step, the Heavenly Daos becomes the whetstone that grinds and polishes you, allowing you to unleash your sharpness. Regretfully, other than the family head, no one else has reached there. The family head has never mentioned what happened on the Honing Heavenly Staircase either,” said one of the Luo family’s Elders.

Only when Long Chen reached that level did they understand that the true honing started with the last final steps. As for them, they weren’t even qualified to come into contact with that honing.

In front of that heavenly might, people had to bend down and cower. Who had the guts to resist the heavens? Even if you had the guts, you needed a strong enough physical body. After all, you could have guts but not the conditions to back it up.

Just as the Luo family’s experts were discussing it, Long Chen once more pressed onwards, climbing two steps in one go and reaching the ninety-seventh stair.

Just then, the scenery changed once more. In front of Long Chen appeared a waterfall dashing down upon him.

Long Chen’s body shook as this waterfall contained the power of the ten thousand Daos. Traces of blood began to leak out of his dragon scales.

“This Honing Heavenly Staircase really is something good.” Long Chen was surprised as he sensed this power. As expected, every single major power possessed its own treasures. There was no way to estimate the value of this divine item. If he had come here earlier, then his last tribulation might not have been so dangerous.

This item was the best thing for tempering a person’s will. It could be considered one of the fastest paths to make a person stronger.

BOOM!

On the ninety-eighth step, lightning fell on Long Chen’s body, and the immense power popped all over his scales. At this moment, space began to solidify, time turned slow, and sound became ephemeral.

Long Chen could hear his bones creaking. Whether it was the pressure of the mind or the flesh, it had doubled. Without the Golden Dragon Battle Armor, his body would probably have been flattened.

Long Chen took a deep breath and stepped toward the ninety-ninth step. Long Chen grunted. The space above him collapsed, and he was almost crushed.

Now it was as if the entire cosmos was above his head, trying to crush him and take his life.

Long Chen frowned and roared. His hair flew in the wild wind as all his power erupted. Cracks appeared in the space above him.

BOOM!

At this moment, the void exploded, transforming into fragments of spacetime. Long Chen then coughed up a mouthful of blood, cracks covering his entire body.

After that, the pressure was gone, and Long Chen looked behind him, smiling. He had finally succeeded.

“Success!”

Bai Xiaole cheered. Luo Bing, Luo Xue, and the others also shouted excitedly. After so many years, someone had finally ascended the Honing Heavenly Staircase. Long Chen didn’t disappoint them.

At the top, Long Chen saw another staircase, startling him. Was there more?

However, when he stepped foot onto it, he found that it was nothing more than an ordinary staircase. It continued to a stone house. Within this barren mountaintop, there was only a single, lonely, exceedingly simple stone hut.

There was a stone stele in front of it with various weapons stabbed into it. Only the handles were exposed, so it wasn’t possible to tell what sort of weapons they were.

There was also a figure sitting on top of the stele. His back was facing Long Chen, as straight as a javelin. His hair reached his shoulders, and each strand was perfectly straight like steel wires. He was like a mountain, immovable.

He was the family head of the Luo family, the one who had saved the Luo family from a crisis. He was the only supreme master of the Luo family, the legendary figure, Luo Zichuan.

Staring at his back, Long Chen felt his heart quickening. Despite this person not releasing any aura, he gave Long Chen a sense of pressure that was even greater than what he had sensed from Enpuda.

He didn’t know if it was because this person was his grandfather, causing him to be nervous. Only through his mouth could he learn about his mother’s whereabouts.

“You should not have come!”

Luo Zichuan spoke, his voice flat and cold. It wasn’t aloof and out of touch with reality, but it still gave off a feeling that made others not dare to defy him. It was as if his voice was a divine edict that could not be defied.

“Why not?” Long Chen took a deep breath and did his best to keep his voice calm.

Luo Zichuan slowly turned and Long Chen finally saw his face. He looked to be in his forties and was very handsome. The most handsome man that Long Chen had ever met was young master Changchuan, but this Luo Zichuan was not inferior to him at all.

The most unforgettable thing about him was his pair of violet eyes. They were like amethysts, and divine light was present deep within those eyes. It was as if stars were flowing within them.

When those eyes stared at him, Long Chen’s body shuddered. He felt like all his secrets were exposed in front of them. These eyes could see through a person’s heart and soul. Hence, Long Chen turned ice-cold. It was as if he was stripped and thrown into a land of ice and snow.

Luo Zichuan’s eyes contained a dark killing intent. He said, “Because I will kill you. Outsiders cannot be permitted to stain the Luo family’s bloodline.”
