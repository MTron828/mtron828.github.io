Chapter 4350: Controlled Heavenly Tribulation

Long Chen's Seven Peak Sword slashed through the air with deadly precision, severing the head of the nine-star heir. The detached head then flew into the air before erupting into a burst of thunderforce.

However, what shocked Long Chen was that even after losing his head, the nine star heir didn’t die. While his aura had weakened a bit, he still had the strength to deliver a punch toward Long Chen.

“He’s weakening while I’m growing stronger. This is what I have to do!” Long Chen’s confidence doubled after this unexpected turn of events. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

In the midst of this realization, the Earth Cauldron smashed toward Long Chen. While aware of the impending danger, Long Chen hesitated to use his father’s copy as a shield. After all, the Earth Cauldron was too terrifying, and it possessed the power to destroy his father’s copy.

BOOM!

Despite doing his best to dodge, Long Chen found himself unable to escape the impending collision. Without any alternative left, he summoned the real Earth Cauldron. However, each clash between the two cauldrons left Long Chen dazed, his ears echoing with a persistent ring.

This time, however, Long Chen had learned a valuable lesson. Even though he was still forced to block it, he swiftly transitioned into an absolute defense stance, aiming to mitigate as much of the damage as possible.

Furthermore, with every collision, Long Chen’s Earth Cauldron remained unharmed, but the duplicated cauldron would spew out some lightning runes. These runes were incredibly powerful, and as Long Chen absorbed them, his Spirit Blood, Spirit Root, Spirit Bone, dragon tendons, bloodline, and soul exhibited signs of intense agitation.

It was like he was a furnace that needed to be heated to a certain level to merge all his powers, and the thunderforce served as the fuel necessary to raise the heat. Only after he had absorbed enough fuel would he reach a state of complete fusion—his strongest state.

As time elapsed, Long Chen repeatedly used his father’s copy to mount a joint attack against Wu Tian and the nine star heir. Eventually, the nine-star heir succumbed, shattering under the impact of Long Chen's blow.

Cheers erupted from the Dragonblood warriors and the others, while a mix of tears and relief streamed down the faces of Yu Qingxuan and Bai Shishi.

Both of them had been worried the entire time, fearing that one slip would spell Long Chen’s demise. For them, the feeling of being powerless while consumed by such worry was more excruciating than death itself.

As Long Chen vanquished the nine star heir, he seized the opportunity to absorb the thunderforce around. In an instant, rainbow flames enveloped Long Chen, casting a myriad of colors across the entire world, and his Blood Qi erupted in a spectacular display.

Long Chen’s seven-color Supreme Blood was boiling as it was the first to ignite. The boiling seven-color Supreme Blood then circulated through him, filling him with power.

Long Chen grew fearless. At this moment, it felt like everything within heaven and earth was under his control.

Once more, Long Chen condensed the Seven Peak Sword. This time, a blood-like energy surged within the core of the sword, adding a crimson aura to its blade.

BOOM!

Long Chen’s Seven Peak Sword slammed into Wu Tian’s spear, but this time, his Sword didn’t shatter.

Long Chen looked at his father, a warm feeling flowing within his heart.

“Dad really is a peerless genius. He calculated this step as well. The heavenly tribulation wanted to use him, but he turned the tables on it. Without his help, I would probably have died here.”

Long Zhantian had managed to buy Long Chen some crucial time. If it hadn’t been for him, Long Chen wouldn’t have had the chance to absorb the thunderforce and grow.

“Last time, the nine star heir let me pass, and this time, I had my father’s help. What about next time? Can it be that I, Long Chen, have to depend on others to save my life? No, I have to get stronger, strong enough to protect myself.” Long Chen’s heart suddenly shuddered.

This heavenly tribulation had almost taken his life. In the future, he knew he would accumulate even more karma, and the heavenly tribulation would only intensify. Thus, he had to get much stronger than he was now.

The nine star heir had lent him a hand last time, and now his father also came to his aide, causing a dent in his pride.

In the Martial Heaven Continent, he had always defied the heavens to reach his position. In his weakest moments, he had never asked for anyone’s help. But today, even as he grew stronger than ever, he found himself reliant on others for survival. This realization pierced his heart.

“Dad, thank you. However, your son will walk his own path now. No matter how thorny this path is, I will still walk it to the end. Please trust me, because I am your son.”

BOOM!

Long Chen swung the Seven Peak Sword at Long Zhantian, targeting a weak spot that Long Zhantian had intentionally left open for him. From the beginning, Long Chen was capable of exploiting Long Zhantian’s rigid movements to destroy him, but he had refrained from doing so.

Long Zhantian exploded. However, just before that happened, his mouth seemed to curl up ever so slightly as if forming a smile. He then transformed into a mass of lightning runes.

“Dad, your child has grown up. Forgive my rudeness.” Long Chen bowed deeply toward Long Zhantian’s departing figure.

At this moment, Wu Tian’s copy launched an attack, and a spear pierced through the air. The replicated Wu Tian continued to employ the same move, not transitioning to a second move.

Long Chen knew that this was because the real Wu Tian had used this move to pierce the wall of the heavens to send him to the nine heavens. As a result, only this one move was replicated by the Heavenly Daos.

Back then, Long Chen hadn’t known what realm Wu Tian was in. He had only speculated that the latter might be in the World King realm or perhaps the Divine Venerate realm. However, now he understood that Wu Tian’s power transcended the confines of mere realms.

After all, even an Eternal expert was unable to pierce the walls between worlds to transport people through.

Furthermore, the replicated Wu Tian had, at most, eighty percent of real Wu Tian’s power. The heavenly tribulation was only able to replicate Wu Tian’s destructive power but not his core energy.

“Big Brother Wu Tian, wait for me. Your little brother will definitely find you. When we two brothers meet again, we’ll drink until we drown the underworld!”

With the Seven Peak Sword in hand, Long Chen struck Wu Tian’s copy seven times, pushing him to his limit until he finally exploded.

Wu Tian’s copy was powerful, but Long Chen had used him to block the black dagger several times, depleting a lot of his energy. He now succumbed to Long Chen’s tactics.

After Long Chen absorbed Wu Tian’s lightning runes, his aura soared once more. Something inside of him rumbled as though lightning was flowing through his veins. The thunderous sound also carried a dragon's cry within its echoes.

“Still missing a bit.”

Long Chen shifted his attention to the black dagger and the Earth Cauldron. The decisive moment had come, signifying the start of a bitter fight.

With renewed determination, Long Chen lunged toward the black dagger. After all, its aura was a bit weaker than that of the Earth Cauldron. However, the moment Long Chen shot at it, something stopped him right in his tracks.

BOOM!

The black dagger actually exploded. However, its runes didn’t flow toward Long Chen; instead, they flowed into the Earth Cauldron. In a sudden surge, the Earth Cauldron grew, covering all of heaven and earth. Long Chen then felt the fabric of space warp, and before he knew it, he found himself within the confines of the Earth Cauldron.

Following that, the earth split open, and the ten thousand Daos were torn apart. Flames danced around the Earth Cauldron, leaving onlookers in awe and shock.

“Something’s wrong. This heavenly tribulation seems to be under someone’s control,” Long Chen declared, his gaze piercing. A sense of alarm and fury then surged within him—a premonition of impending danger.
