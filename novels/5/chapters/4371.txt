Chapter 4360 Dragon Elephant Race

Looking into the distance, Long Chen’s gaze seemed to pierce the void. A disdainful sneer hung on his face.

However, Long Chen saw no one. Instead, that space he was staring at was a mirror that was reflecting the surroundings, making it impossible for others to detect it.

This was a spying formation. Despite not being a formation master, after advancing to the World King realm, Long Chen could detect it as his spiritual perception had elevated to an unprecedented peak. His perception was greater than ever.

Staring at the formation, Long Chen knew that some experts were secretly watching everything going on here.

For them, the martial stage set up in front of the Starry River Sect was simply a test. They wanted to see if Long Chen would appear. Also, this bunch of Eternal experts were nothing more than their lackeys and should be considered the weakest of all the Eternal experts.

It was precisely because they were so weak that they dared to be so reckless. They all knew the palace master was a prideful existence and would disdain killing weaklings like them.

Back then, if those people hadn’t come to the High Firmament Academy with such a provoking attitude, the palace master wouldn’t have wanted to kill them either. Because they knew this, they dared to wantonly strut around the Starry River Sect.

However, they also knew that they were testing the ground on the border of death. Afraid of the palace master suddenly showing up, they had only been watching. However, it came at a price. When Long Chen came, they were thrown into chaos, and several of them had died without even having a chance to run.

“What Eight Great Kings and Six Great Lords? They are less than dogshit,” sneered Long Chen.

This formation was set up by the traitors of the human races so that the two invading worlds could keep an eye on what was happening here. Hiding in their own world as they watched everything, they clearly didn’t have the guts to directly face Long Chen.

Suddenly, the void in the distance twisted. As the hidden mirror materialized, a large figure also appeared. It was an extremely muscular bald man whose veins wriggled beneath his skin like tiny serpents.

“Inferior human race! How dare you say such arrogant words?!” shouted that bald man.

His voice wasn’t loud as it came from within the mirror. However, it was vaguely possible to hear a mix of dragon cry and elephant trumpet.

“So, it’s the Dragon Elephant race,” Long Chen sneered at the figure in the mirror. He recognized this race.Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Dragon Elephant race?”

Startled cries came from the crowd. It was an extremely ancient species whose history could be traced back to the primal chaos era. They were famous even within that era.

Descending from the true dragon race and the Heavenly Elephant race, they were the earliest example of a merger between the dragon race and other races.

The Dragon Elephant race inherited the strongest divine abilities of the dragon race and elephant race, getting the strongest aspects of both sides. As a result, this species was the closest to perfection of all mixed dragon races.

Some people even said that the Dragon Elephant race had reached an unprecedented step in evolution and would possibly transcend the dragon race.

However, in the end, they were simply a legendary existence, and only stories about them existed within the nine heavens. No one in recent histories had seen them, so many people felt like they had gone extinct in the primal chaos battle.

For Long Chen to say that this person was from the Dragon Elephant race, it shocked countless people. Did this legendary race actually appear here?

“Interesting. However, I want to know when the great Dragon Elephant race became cowering tortoises. If you want to challenge me, then just come at me. To use such lowlife methods, are you not afraid of ruining your ancestors’ reputation?” asked Long Chen lightly.

“Lowlife methods? Hmph, well said. This lowlife method was made by your human race who said that you all are too deceitful and untrustworthy. If our Six Great Lords were to come, the guy from the barbarian dragon race would pay any price to kill them. That was why the cowards went with this lowlife plan, telling us to just patiently watch for your reaction,” sneered that Dragon Elephant expert.

Hearing that, the human experts present were incensed. These traitors were really shameless. They even helped their enemies strategize against their own race.

“If the human race is a lowlife bunch and you are listening to their directions, what does that make you? Trashlife?”

At this moment, Bai Xiaole’s voice rang out along with an explosion. A giant bull corpse then fell from the sky and smashed into the ground.

Bai Xiaole had just returned from hunting down his prey, successfully slaying the fleeing Immemorial Horned Python Bull. Its head and crystal core lay severed. At a glance, everyone could tell that the corpse had been thoroughly ravaged.

When the Immemorial Horned Python Bull’s corpse landed on the ground, countless people cried out in shock and stared at Bai Xiaole. The Violet Pupil Nine Tail Fox was cutely squatting on Bai Xiaole’s shoulder once more, looking adorable and completely harmless. No one dared to imagine just how fierce this adorable little fellow had been just before this.

Bai Xiaole had returned victorious. Although he acted calm, there was no way to hide the excitement in his eyes.

Clearly, he wanted to pretend to be low-key, yet he was afraid of being low-key. His expression was extremely funny.

However, Bai Xiaole’s display today was indeed shocking. His power when merging with the Violet Pupil Nine Tail Fox was truly terrifying, and the Immemorial Horned Python Bull had no ability to retaliate against him.

“A Violet Pupil Nine Tail Fox? Hmph, you aren’t qualified to be arrogant in front of my Dragon Elephant race,” sneered that expert.

“Then stop cowering like a tortoise! Come out and fight!” This time, the speaker was not Bai Xiaole but the Violet Pupil Nine Tail Fox on his shoulder. Its eyes were still full of a savage desire.

Outsiders might not know, but in truth, the Violet Pupil Nine Tail Fox and the Dragon Elephant races were born at different eras. The Dragon Elephant race was a bit older, but that didn’t necessarily mean that the Violet Pupil Nine Tail Fox was weaker.

Battles had erupted between the two races. Unlike the human race, the demonic beast races did not document their history in words; instead, it was woven into their bloodline and souls.

As a result, it was very easy for demonic beasts to remember any grudges. As long as they looked at someone and found the other party displeasing, they knew there had to be some enmity between their two races. When the Violet Pupil Nine Tail Fox looked at the Dragon Elephant expert, hatred flared in its eyes.

“Hmph, if you really have the guts, you can come to my Great Desolate World,” sneered that Dragon Elephant expert.

Bai Xiaole sneered at him. If they entered their territory, wouldn’t everything be under their control? He was about to retort when Long Chen suddenly said, “Hurry up and finish the battle here. The next battle will be in the Great Desolate World!”

“What?!”

Every expert present jumped in shock.
