Chapter 5043 Swallow the Heavens, Refine the Earth

Long Chen formed hand seals, and divine light flowed around him. The Earth Cauldron floated above his head, slowly revolving. The qi of a Grand Dao swirled around Long Chen.

The Earth Cauldron said, “All Grand Daos beneath the heavens lead to the same destination. Whether refining pills or refining the body, they ultimately converge. In the past, you devoured medicinal pills using the dragon race’s Swallow the Heavens, Devour the Earth. This divine ability is domineering, but it merely swallows everything without consideration—”

“Bullshit!”

Evilmoon immediately cursed the Earth Cauldron when it heard this.

“Evilmoon!” Long Chen scolded Evilmoon. When did Evilmoon get so sensitive? That was nothing more than a simple evaluation.

Evilmoon fell silent but was clearly irritated.

Swallow the Heavens, Devour the Earth was a technique Evilmoon had taught Long Chen. It was a secret art of the dark evil dragon race, so Evilmoon was naturally unhappy when someone criticized it.

The Earth Cauldron nonchalantly continued, “There is a difference between swallowing and refining, much like there is between a Divine Venerate Pill and the ingredients used to refine it. If consuming the ingredients provided the same effect as the pill itself, why would we even refine the pill?”

Long Chen nodded at this insight. Evilmoon also seemed to find it reasonable and didn’t argue.

“Since you are on the verge of entering the Eternal realm, your cultivation style needs some adjustments. This adjustment will build upon the foundation of Swallow the Heavens, Devour the Earth. You possess dragon blood and cultivate the Dragon Soul Body Forging Art. Most importantly, your Sovereign Blood Seal is on the brink of awakening. You are already qualified to make these modifications,” said the Earth Cauldron.

“What kind of modifications?” asked Long Chen.

“Use your body as the furnace and your blood as the flame. Refine all the energy that enters your body. This doesn’t just refer to the energy of medicinal pills but also invading energies.”

“This is why you let the patriarch’s energy enter my body?”

“Correct. This is a kind of trial. If you refine it incorrectly, you won’t be able to harness this powerful heaven vein dragon qi. Prepare yourself and listen to my mnemonic. My body is the furnace that can hold all things. My blood is the flame that refines the corporeal and incorporeal. My bones are the fuel...”

As the Earth Cauldron’s voice resonated throughout Long Chen’s mind, one rune after another lit up on the Earth Cauldron. Dragon scales appeared on Long Chen’s body as the Earth Cauldron’s runes were projected onto him.

Long Chen instantly felt like there was a fire in his chest. Although his dragon blood power was almost exhausted, this fire let it rapidly recover.

Long Chen was startled, but soon realized that his dragon blood power wasn’t dissipating outwardly but was instead burning within him. It was a miraculous method of cultivation and recovery simultaneously.

The body served as the furnace, the blood as the flame, the bones as the fuel, the meridians as the guide, and his Spiritual Strength controlled everything. This was an entirely new refinement style that Long Chen had never encountered before.

Despite initially groping in the dark, Long Chen had the Pill Sovereign memories in his soul. His strength enabled him to endure and, with guidance from the Earth Cauldron, he quickly grasped the technique.

Three clumps of energy quivered within Long Chen’s body. His dragon blood flame gathered them, causing them to feel a bit uneasy and start resisting.

However, thanks to the Earth Cauldron’s control, their power was limited. Long Chen’s dragon blood flame quickly condensed into a translucent pill furnace around them.

This translucent pill furnace had three feet and two handles and was covered in blood-colored scales, appearing frail. The three heaven vein dragon qi repeatedly deformed it, as if they would break free at any moment.

However, its appearance did not reflect its true strength; it was incredibly tough. At one point, a surge of dragon qi attempted to burst out, forming a protruding point several times longer than the furnace itself, yet it couldn’t escape.

“Not bad. You’ve grasped the essence quickly,” praised the Earth Cauldron.

The modification that the Earth Cauldron was implementing was a new concept. While it seemed extremely feasible, altering a divine ability was unimaginably difficult.

Nevertheless, as soon as Long Chen understood the concept, he swiftly went for it. Within just an hour, the embryonic pill furnace took shape.

It was even better than the Earth Cauldron had anticipated. Long Chen was already halfway to success.

As time passed, the pill furnace started to really take shape. Although it still contorted under the impact of the three dragon qis, the deformations were less severe.

What delighted Long Chen was that as the pill furnace grew stronger, he clearly sensed the three dragon qi’s energy being absorbed by the pill furnace when they crashed into it. They started to nourish and fortify the pill furnace.

Six hours later, the pill furnace was fully formed—solid and robust. The three dragon qi were starting to weaken.

Another hour passed, and the pill furnace trembled. Instantly, all the dragon qi energy melted into it. Long Chen felt pure energy spread throughout every bone, going from the bottom of his feet all the way to the top of his head.

Long Chen’s nearly exhausted and battered body instantly recovered to over seventy percent. Previously, Long Chen had been in the great circle of the Divine Venerate realm, but now, he felt that his great circle had become even more perfect.

“It’s that powerful?” Long Chen was overjoyed. The technique that the Earth Cauldron taught him was incredible. His severe wounds, which would have taken several days to heal with the primal chaos space’s aid, now mended instantly. It was almost unbelievable.

“This was something that the majority of orthodox pill cultivators practiced in ancient times. They had two furnaces: one external for refining pills and one internal for refining the body. Unfortunately, due to the downfall of a certain person, this kind of cultivation method gradually disappeared,” lamented the Earth Cauldron

Long Chen barely heard its sigh. He was looking at the pill furnace within his Dantian. With a thought, this pill furnace transformed into millions of runes that merged into his dragon blood.

As the dragon blood assimilated the runes, Long Chen delightedly sensed most of his vitality restored. He would soon be capable of unleashing the God Slaying Cross again. He almost shouted in excitement.

“This technique was based on the dragon race’s Swallow the Heavens, Devour the Earth divine ability. You can call it the Swallow the Heavens, Refine the Earth divine ability,” stated the Earth Cauldron.

“Swallow the Heavens, Refine the Earth... yes, it’s not bad.” Evilmoon finally spoke again, sounding quite satisfied with this name. Changing just one word was acceptable to it. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

“Hehe, then there’s no time to waste. I’m going to move out right now. The next target is the Brahma Pill Valley!” Long Chen chuckled darkly, a sense of heroism filling him.
