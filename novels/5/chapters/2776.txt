Chapter 2765 The Power of Wealth

Ma Ruyun laughed. “Doing business mostly relies on the mouth. If I shut my mouth, how can I do business? For my new client, let me introduce our business. From the services we provide to our marketing, everything is under our domain. I don’t discriminate between young and old, so I feel like I should give you a detailed introduction to our Major World Golden Coin.”

The devil race’s Emperor was so infuriated that he burst into curses. Unexpectedly, his ability in cursing was not inferior to his cultivation base. He managed to curse Ma Ruyun’s entire family, male and female, all the way back to eighteen generations. Moreover, not one of his curses repeated itself. He stunned everyone.

What people were unaware of was that Ma Ruyun’s seemingly nonchalant presentation was a kind of warfare against the heart.

The golden light of the Major World Golden Coin blinded the eyes. To the trapped Emperor, Ma Ruyun’s voice was like a devil’s curse.

His cursing could be considered a kind of counterattack, comforting him both physically and mentally. Hence, this cursing displayed his overwhelming talent in this regard, which stunned the Martial Heaven Continent’s experts. Even a grand Emperor could curse like a shrew on the streets. This completely toppled their understanding of experts.

Ma Ruyun continued to give an explanation about the true essence of a businessman, and his expression remained unchanged the entire time. His voice was incredibly sincere.

“This Major World Golden Coin was created by the Wealth God. The outside is round, while the inside is square. It contains the essence of heaven and earth. The outer roundness is primal chaos, while the inner square is the four divisions of the night sky. It corroborates the Heavenly Daos. The outer circle is for material matters, while the inner square is for matters of the heart, corroborating the Human Dao. The Dao of the heavens has voids to fill but nothing to fill them with. The Human Dao doesn’t have as many voids, and there’s plenty of stuff to fill them with. When your hands are rich, you fill them more and more. When your hands are impoverished, they empty more and more…”

Ma Ruyun’s voice continued to ring out. At this time, the commoners protected at the core of the continent were drawn out of their chaotic frenzy. His voice entered their souls. They thought that he was speaking the words of truth. Whatever you already had, the heavens would give you more of. Whatever you lacked, the heavens would take away from you.

Hence, these people who had thrown themselves into a frenzy for the golden coins in the air gradually regained their minds. They began to listen intently.

“As a result, the wealthy prosper, while the poor remain penniless. But the Heavenly Daos are in constant motion. The wheel turns, and nothing is set in stone. The Major World Golden Coin’s round exterior is the attitude one must have when facing the world. A person must be round, slick, and smooth, not injuring others, allowing for easy communication. You’ll gain more than others…”

“Fuck, fuck, fuck, shut up!” the devil race’s Emperor roared, but his voice was drowned out by the sound of coins tinkling against each other.

That metallic ringing was extremely clear. It was a pleasing sound to everyone else, but it seemed to be a torture to the devil race’s Emperor.

Ma Ruyun continued, “As for the interior square, it indicates that there must be rules, laws, and limits, a bottom line. Roundness must not lead to a blind submission. It cannot lead to constantly yielding or simply resigning yourself to struggles. When someone touches something in your heart, you must fight back. The square is the bottom line as a person. All things must have limits. This inner square is also where the faith of everyone in the Huayun Sect resides. We will not be overbearing or servile to others. We will not be scared or panic no matter what happens. We will remain unflustered even in the face of beckoning wealth, because wealth is a double-edged sword. It is the milestone that encourages people but also the epitaph of countless people. That is because it can cause a person to inflate limitlessly. Without the square in the heart to control oneself, desire grows and grows until it consumes the entire person, making them do crazy things…”

“Shut up! You…!”

The devil race’s Emperor suddenly coughed up a mouthful of black blood. His eyes turned red as if he had gone insane.

All of a sudden, his expression changed, and he gave up on fighting. He let go of his devil sword as his body began to inflate. He then formed hand seals in a panic, seemingly trying to control himself.

“The Devil Dao is the opposite. The outside is square, while the inside is round. Strong in appearance, but weak in reality. It contains only fear, but not kindness. With such a heart, how can you resist the lure of wealth? I told you that you were already defeated, but you didn’t believe it.” Ma Ruyun shook his head.

The devil race’s Emperor suddenly inflated like a balloon, causing everyone to jump. They thought that he was activating some powerful technique at first, but then they found that his expression was not very good. His body quivered.

“You slaughter other lifeforms and take their wealth. But you never create your own wealth. You only know how to kill and take. Now that the Major World Golden Coin has appeared here, you can have as much wealth as you want. Take as much as you want. Limitless wealth can materialize your dreams. Wealth can create your own world, a world that you want. Wealth can allow you to stand above all others…” Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

Ma Ruyun’s voice was like a hypnotic spell but also like the voice of a devil in the ears of the devil race’s Emperor. As time passed, the power of the Major World Golden Coin grew.

This divine item was a peculiar one. It drew out the deepest desire for wealth within a person’s heart.

The devil race slaughtered and plundered, all for wealth, and it made them stronger. Being stronger allowed them to plunder more wealth.

However, the Major World Golden Coin’s power terrified the Emperor. It was causing him to inflate rapidly.

At this moment, more rays of golden light flew out of the Major World Golden Coin. Various illusions started to appear. There were mountains of gold, silver mines, and even naked beautiful women of the devil race.

“What is that?!”

“Sect master Ma has used a divine art on the devil race’s Emperor. He said so much in order to avoid affecting the ordinary people, allowing them to be mentally prepared before launching the real attack,” said an elder.

While it seemed that Ma Ruyun had simply spouted a bunch of nonsense, it had actually been to save everyone, allowing them to get used to it. Otherwise, if he had launched an all-out attack from the start, perhaps all the commoners would have been consumed.

BOOM!

The devil race’s Emperor’s body once more expanded. Cracks appeared all over his body as if he was about to burst.

“... Of course, wealth can also easily destroy yourself,” said Ma Ruyun indifferently.

The devil race’s Emperor was on the verge of exploding. On the other hand, the people who had been willing to risk their lives for the golden coins were no longer so infatuated. Everyone said that profit was a blade, but they had always ignored that saying. Today though, they were finally scared by that blade. Even an Emperor was about to die to it.

The devil race’s Emperor was covered in cracks, and his body had reached its limit. Some people covered their ears and ducked their heads to avoid seeing the explosion.
