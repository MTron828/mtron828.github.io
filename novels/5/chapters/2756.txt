Chapter 2745 Trial

Long Chen didn’t even look back. The power of the stars in his divine ring flowed out, and he caught the golden hand that appeared. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

With a cold snort, Long Chen reached and grabbed the golden hand with his hand, dragging its master out of the void.

BOOM!

Startled cries rang out from the divine families’ experts when they saw the Lord Saint be pulled out. Long Chen then smashed him to the ground, causing the entire palace to shake.

The Lord Saint had rushed over immediately and had chosen to launch a sneak attack with almost no hesitation. However, he hadn’t expected that the current Long Chen was no longer the old Long Chen. He was instantly caught. Only at that time did he realize that Long Chen’s realm had shockingly risen to the ninth Heavenstage.

At this moment, the Lord Saint made the prompt decision to cut off his own arm to escape Long Chen’s grasp. He rolled away. Although it wasn’t dignified, his years of experience told him that any hesitation would be fatal.

Just as he was preparing to withdraw, a lightning spear pierced through his body, and a small figure appeared behind the Lord Saint. Lei Linger stared at him icily, raising him into the air.

Countless experts now filled this palace. Their weapons were drawn, but no one dared to make a move.

Their Lord Saint had been instantly captured by Long Chen. They were dumbfounded.

Long Chen turned to stare at the horrified Lord Saint. With a mocking smile, he said, “There was a path to heaven and no doors to hell, yet you still jumped in yourself. You threw yourself into my hands. Were you a victim to your own intelligence, or is this to say that you finally grew a conscience and came to atone for your sins?”

Everything was going smoother than he had expected. Long Chen had thought that it would take more than ten exchanges before he had a chance to capture the Lord Saint.

If it weren’t for Long Zhantian being too softhearted and being sneak attacked, he might not have lost to people like this.

This Lord Saint was truly stupid. In order to cut off his own arm, he had to weaken his physical body to the point that it could be cut off. Considering just how powerful his physical body was, how could an arm be cut off just by willing it? Thus, when his arm was cut off, his body was in its weakest state.

He had only been on guard against Long Chen but not against Lei Linger who had merged with the void. As a result, the instant he cut off his arm, Lei Linger struck, easily capturing him.

“I didn’t think that you would be able to escape,” sighed the Lord Saint. Even with his life in Long Chen’s hands, he was surprisingly calm.

“There are more things that you didn’t think of. If you weren’t so greedy for my secrets and instead directly killed me, this result wouldn’t have occurred.” Long Chen smiled indifferently.

“You are, after all, Long Zhantian’s son, a member of my Long family. How could I really kill you?” said the Lord Saint.

Hearing this, Long Chen slapped him in the face. As a result, blood flowed down his face.

“Long Chen!”

The divine families’ experts were infuriated, and three Saints appeared in their midst.

“Do you want to come over and try it? I’ll immediately kill the two of them.” Long Chen snorted coldly.

Those experts instantly became cowardly. They glared at Long Chen, clenching their weapons. Moreover, they were so furious that it looked like they were just a bit away from charging over and killing him.

Seeing that they didn’t dare to make any rash movements, Long Chen took out a spear and tossed it to the side.

“AH!”

In the distance, Long Aotian’s mother screamed. She had been preparing to charge out, but this spear from Long Chen nailed her to a stone pillar, making her unable to move.

Only then did Long Chen return his focus to the Lord Saint. “Do you know why I hit you?”

The Lord Saint smiled and indifferently said, “If you want to kill me, then kill me. After all, I couldn’t protect your father that year either. If you kill me, I can die without regrets.”

Long Chen slapped him once more, making the other half of his face just as bloody as the first half.

The divine families’ experts burst into furious roars. The Lord Saint was the leader of the divine families, so these slaps were slaps in the face of the divine families, the greatest humiliation.

However, with his life in Long Chen’s hands, they didn’t dare to move. They secretly began gathering people, completely locking down this location, as well as alerting the other worlds.

Most importantly, people had gone to report this to Long Aotian. Although he was in seclusion, if he happened to come out, he could still come. However, no one dared to charge into his seclusion room. If he was startled out of his cultivation state, then a light backlash would be being injured by the Heavenly Daos. A heavy backlash would be death.

Although they were panicked, they were still thinking of ways to stall Long Chen. It would be best if they could keep him here until Long Aotian came out, or perhaps until another expert on Long Aotian’s level came.

After finishing his slap, Long Chen said, “Hitting you has nothing to do with my father. He didn’t kill you because he had his reasons, but I have no such reasons. I hit you because I’m testing just how thick your face is. This impervious skin could make an excellent shield. My father was probably tricked by your hypocritical act precisely due to how thick this skin is. My father spared your life back then, yet you still acted like this to me. That’s enough to testify to your character. Now you continue acting so fake in front of me. I’m very curious, just what is your skin made out of? Perhaps my father had some fond memories of you due to growing up within the divine families, but I don’t. I have no such feelings, only a bone-deep hatred. This act of yours is useless against me. It would be best if you didn’t make me so disgusted with this act. Don’t force me to use the Heaven Executioner’s techniques on you. My father might have been a gentleman, but I, Long Chen, am not. You’re under my trial. It would be best if you were more honest, or I guarantee that death will become a luxury for you.”

The Lord Saint gradually showed some fear at this. Long Chen was not Long Zhantian. The same stratagem from back then could not be used again.

“I saved your father’s life back then. If it weren’t for me…” said the Lord Saint darkly.

“Shut up. My father only spared you due to a little favor between you. That has long since been repaid!” shouted Long Chen.

Suddenly, the void shuttered and the laws of the Heavenly Daos split open. A figure descended from the sky, and a spear spread a supreme heavenly might around this world, locking onto Long Chen.

“Long Aotian, you’ve finally arrived? I’ve been waiting a long time for you.” Long Chen smiled. That faint smile was very icy, very dangerous.
