Chapter 3871 A Shine that Illuminates Past and Present

It had been over a year, but Li Qi and Song Mingyuan still looked the same as ever, except for the additional weariness to their faces. Clearly, they had matured a great deal compared to when they were on the Martial Heaven Continent.

Both of them had immortal qi curling around them and shocking auras. After they arrived, the earth quivered according to a certain rhythm as if welcoming them.Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

The two of them had grown even stronger. They exuded the air of peak experts. However, these two peak experts couldn’t stop themselves from spilling hot tears when they saw Long Chen.

“Boss!”

The two of them had no words. After that, the three of them embraced tightly as if afraid that this was all a dream, as if as soon as they let go, they would wake from this dream.

“Good brothers, don’t cry. We have important matters to deal with.” Long Chen wiped away his own tears from the corner of his eyes and patted them on the shoulder.

Long Chen was delighted by how powerful they were. It wasn’t just their physical bodies that were powerful, but their profound earth energy made them seem linked to the earth, as if they had roots in the earth. That kind of heavy feeling was amazing.

However, he had no time to ask them about their current state. He said, “I’ll give you the dragon blood activation rune. Prepare yourselves to receive the baptism of dragon blood.”

A dragon-shaped rune appeared on each of Long Chen’s hands. He then pressed them on their foreheads.

Both of their bodies quivered and this dragon-shaped rune lit up. Following that, the dragon scale lit up, and dragon qi poured into their bodies.

Suddenly, they both coughed up blood. Long Chen jumped in shock. “Senior, what’s going on?”

“They cannot endure the impact of the true dragon’s will. If you forcibly draw my dragon blood into their bodies, even if their bodies don’t directly explode, their wills will crumble, turning them into madmen. Thus, activating the true dragon rune is already their limit. You cannot force things. Have them absorb the essence blood of other dragon kings. With the true dragon rune, they will not be rejected by those dragon king corpses. They’ll have a much easier time absorbing their blood,” said the dragon expert.

Long Chen saw Li Qi and Song Mingyuan’s pained expressions. However, neither of them made a sound. They clenched their teeth hard.

There was no way for them to do this. Originally, Long Chen was hoping for them to absorb at least a trace of this essence blood, but it seemed he had been dreaming. It was impossible. This dragon scale’s energy could only be absorbed by him. All he could do was help them receive the true dragon rune.

“Li Qi, Mingyuan, you’ve been branded with the true dragon rune. There are eighteen immemorial dragon kings in the surroundings. Pick one that suits you and absorb its dragon king essence blood to increase the power of your physical body and bloodline power,” said Long Chen.

“Can we really absorb their essence blood?” Li Qi and Song Mingyuan had seen two terrifying dragon kings on their way here. Just their auras alone were suffocating. Hence, they didn’t quite dare to believe their ears.

“Go. Time is pressing. Absorb as much as you can. You’ll only have this one chance.” Long Chen urged them on.

The two of them then nodded and rushed toward one of the immemorial dragon kings. As the dragon expert said, with the true dragon rune, they easily went to the top of the dragon king’s head.

When they activated the Dragon Blood Body Tempering Art, blood oozed out of their bodies, but golden blood also flowed into them. Their essence blood was being switched.

The two of them were earth element cultivators, and their Spirit Roots had been changed by an earth element treasure that Long Chen had given them. Luckily, absorbing the true dragon essence blood wouldn’t destroy this attribute. On the contrary, earth cultivators were all in possession of the thick power of the earth. That immense power would only be further supported by a stronger physical body.

The two of them quickly benefited. With this dragon king essence blood, their bodies were completely transforming. The two of them almost cried out excitedly. Following their boss truly was a blessing.

Suddenly, the world quivered and a ray of light illuminated heaven and earth. It was only once the source of this light got closer that Long Chen could see a glossy bald head reflecting the divine light of heaven and earth. It appeared exceptionally dazzling.

“Gu Yang!”

Long Chen, Li Qi, and Song Mingyuan cried out at the same time.

This bright head whose light could stretch through past and present could only belong to one person. Who else could possibly be so dazzling?

“Boss!”

The first captain of the Dragonblood Legion, Gu Yang. It was only once he got close that they could see his face through the shine. The current Gu Yang was even more muscular than before. It looked like tiny serpents were wriggling beneath his skin. The power of his physical body was on the verge of exploding, and he gave off immense pressure.

“First captain of the Dragonblood Legion, Gu Yang, reporting to boss!” Gu Yang actually knelt on the ground toward Long Chen.

Long Chen immediately lifted him up, his eyes red. “What nonsense are you spouting? When did us brothers ever deal with such things?”

Long Chen patted Gu Yang’s shoulder. The resulting sound was like he had struck an iron wall. Gu Yang’s physical body was incredibly powerful. He had obviously run into his own fortuitous encounters.

“Alright, now isn’t the time to celebrate. Absorb the essence blood of the immemorial dragon kings. After that, come guard me. I also want to absorb some.” Long Chen gave Gu Yang the true dragon rune and had him go as well.

Gu Yang originally had many words to say, but now wasn’t the time to talk. He then found a nearby dragon corpse and started absorbing its essence blood.

“Boss!”

“Boss!”

One Dragonblood warrior after another came, coming from every direction. When they saw Long Chen, Gu Yang, Li Qi, and Song Mingyuan, they all wept, their voices hoarse.

Long Chen had no time to catch up with all of them. He gave each of them the true dragon rune and had them quickly absorb the dragon king essence blood.

Some of the Dragonblood warriors simply didn’t possess enough talent and relied entirely on their toughness to enter the three thousand worlds. Some were not even thinking about leaving this place alive.

A few of them couldn’t even count as Primals. Seeing this, Long Chen was aggrieved and hastily took out Heavenly Dao Fruits for them. First, they became Supremes, and then they absorbed the dragon blood energy.

“Damn, Long Chen, it seems that my business was small compared to yours!”

Space quivered and Mo Nian, Xia Chen, and Guo Ran also arrived. They were stunned by the dragon scale beneath Long Chen’s feet and the surrounding immemorial dragon kings.

“It’s a good thing that you’re here! Guard me, I’m going to absorb the dragon blood!” Long Chen was delighted by Mo Nian’s arrival.

He didn’t even wait for a reply. He directly condensed a large batch of true dragon runes and handed them to Mo Nian for him to distribute to the Dragonblood warriors who would arrive later.

Long Chen had long since grown impatient. He then sat down on the dragon scale and formed hand seals.

The next moment, the golden dragon scale quivered and countless runes lit up on it. Golden liquid flowed into Long Chen.
