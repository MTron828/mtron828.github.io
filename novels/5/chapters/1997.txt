This powerful attack could not be received by just anyone. Of everyone present, only some of the peak experts could receive it. Hence, the people who cared about Long Chen felt their hearts clench.

Ignoring the might of the Fantasy Star Sword, Long Chen only focused on the blood on his finger.

That was a drop of his purest essence blood, merging with Evilmoon. As a result, a character slowly appeared on Evilmoon, and it began to shake intensely. It was like an evil beast was trying to break free.

Long Chen drew over the character with his blood, and it slowly revealed itself to be an immortal character: Shang.

Golden light blossomed as a divine and indomitable will spread. This divine aura caused the Life Star experts to involuntarily kneel on the ground. Even some Netherpassage experts began to kneel.

“This is... a Sovereign’s aura!” Daoist Heavenly Feather was stunned.

Sovereigns were unrivaled existences on the Martial Heaven Continent. They were leaders, rulers, and heroes who had come to the world to bring peace to chaos, allowing the Martial Heaven Continent to escape its destruction.

Each Sovereign had been an amazing figure with no equal. They were viewed as protective gods. For a Sovereign’s aura to appear here, they all knelt down in worship.

“Is this really a Sovereign’s aura? How can Long Chen release such a thing? Is he the reincarnation of a Sovereign?”

People shuddered. They didn’t want to show disrespect to a Sovereign, but they suspected that this was one of Long Chen’s tricks. They didn’t really believe that he was the reincarnation of a Sovereign because all the past generations of Sovereigns wore white robes, while Long Chen always liked to wear black.

Evilmoon shook. Long Chen finally finished writing the Shang character, which was the seal that Sovereign Yun Shang had left on Evilmoon.

“Using my blood and soul, let gods and devils in heaven and earth hear my oath. My name is Long Chen, and I call upon the laws of the world to break Sovereign Yun Shang’s seal!”

Long Chen’s voice resounded through heaven and earth. The world shook as if it was responding to Long Chen.

At that moment, Long Chen seemed to be the master of this world. His word was law, and even the Heavenly Daos didn’t dare to go against him. This mnemonic was the method to undo the seal that Yun Shang had left him.

The Shang character grew brighter and brighter until it was blinding, and then it exploded. Once the Sovereign seal was undone, an evil, domineering, bloodthirsty, and ruthless aura soared.

“Hahaha, I, Evilmoon, am finally free!”

Evilmoon laughed wildly. The earth shook uneasily, and everyone’s expressions changed. That evil and sinister aura was hair-raising. It seemed that Long Chen had just unleashed some monster.

“Stop laughing and get to work, or I’ll be killed!” shouted Long Chen. At this time, Ji Wuming finally launched the attack he had been lazily brewing.

“Kill him!”

Evilmoon attacked on its own. A giant black blade slashed through the air, meeting Ji Wuming’s Fantasy Star Sword.

BOOM!

These two peak divine items smashed together, causing a heaven-shaking explosion. Black light exploded, and the earth was torn asunder.

Ji Wuming coughed up a mouthful of blood and flew back, shocked. Evilmoon had actually relied on its own power to block his attack.

As for Evilmoon, it was blown into the distance. Even once Long Chen caught it, he ended up being dragged away by its momentum.

“Have you made some mistake? Didn’t you say that you were some amazing existence that could kill him like killing a chicken? Don’t tell me that it was all bragging!” raged Long Chen.

“Shut up! I’ve been sealed for too long, and that bastard Yun Shang exhausted all my power, not leaving me with anything. Otherwise, I’d have killed this idiot! And he’s using the power of karmic luck to boost himself. He’s absorbing the very energy of the Martial Heaven Continent, while I’m relying on myself, so being able to draw is already decent. Also, let me remind you that our agreement has come to an end now that my seal is undone. For me to help you now is a favor, understood? Learn how to be grateful!” Evilmoon also raged.

“Grateful my ass, he’s coming back!”

Long Chen swung Evilmoon, activating his world energy. He found that Evilmoon was too unreliable, always saying that it could subdue the entire world if its seal was undone. Long Chen had thought that once he undid its seal, he could just sit back and clean up the battlefield. But in reality, this bastard had just been saying some big words. It hadn’t recovered its former energy.

“Split the Heavens 7!”

Long Chen directly used his strongest attack. The two dragon marks on Evilmoon lit up, and a dragon cry rang out. However, what surprised Long Chen was that it was a double dragon roar.

One dragon roar came from Evilmoon, while another roar came from within Long Chen’s body. Evilmoon was actually forming a resonance with the Azure Dragon Battle Armor.

BOOM!

Evilmoon collided with the Fantasy Star Sword once more. This time the clash was even more violent, and even the Dragonblood Legion was affected by the shockwaves.

However, their battle had already ended. The Unfettered Allseer was pierced through with willow branches and was in Liu Ruyan’s hands. It was unknown whether he was alive or dead.

The Dragonblood warriors hastily retreated in the face of their collision, directly going to Qu Jianying’s side.

Qu Jianying, the old man, and the others were all stunned that the Dragonblood Legion had managed to handle the Unfettered Allseer. Their power had truly surpassed their expectations.

One saber-image after another came slashing out at Ji Wuming. He was actually forced to retreat time and time again.

“Hehe, boss really is the boss. No matter how much stronger we get, we can only barely manage to see his back,” sighed Guo Ran. Their advancement had made them feel like they had finally shortened the distance between themselves and Long Chen, but now they found that while they had gotten stronger, Long Chen had gotten even stronger.

The Martial Heaven Alliance’s elders sighed in amazement. Everyone in the Dragonblood Legion was a monster, but these monsters all worshipped Long Chen, an even greater monster.

Based on the fact that Long Chen had broken Sovereign Yun Shang’s seal, they guessed that Long Chen had some kind of connection to Sovereign Yun Shang. Otherwise, no one in this world was capable of undoing a Sovereign’s seal.

If Sovereign seals were so easy to undo, then the devil race from Devil Spirit Mountain would have already attacked, and the Yin Yang World’s Blood race would also have invaded them.

The Sovereigns were supreme existences. Let alone a Life Star disciple like Long Chen, even an existence greater than a peak Netherpassage expert wouldn’t be anything in front of a Sovereign. They were all ants in comparison to the Sovereigns.

For Long Chen to actually have such a connection with a Sovereign, just how heaven-defying did his luck have to be? That kind of opportunity was enough to drive people crazy with envy.

BOOM!

The earth shook intensely. Long Chen and Ji Wuming had vanished from sight.

As the ground continued to shake, lava and giant boulders began flying out of the ground. The two of them had actually taken their fight underground.

“Long Chen, it’s not worth it for you to fight like this. How many years has Heavenly Fate Island been accumulating karmic luck? He’s not using up much of his own energy at all. As long as you wait a few days, most of his karmic luck will have run out. Killing him then will be easy!” shouted Evilmoon. They were at a disadvantage in this kind of fight.

Heavenly Fate Island had only just been destroyed, its karmic luck was currently dissipating rapidly. Although it had been gathered over tens and even hundreds of thousands of years, it would only take a few days for half of it to run out. Then in the following months, the remaining half would completely vanish. At that time, the Fantasy Star Sword would crumble.

Today, the Fantasy Star Sword still possessed ninety percent of Heavenly Fate Island’s karmic luck. Tomorrow, it would only have seventy. The next day, it would only have sixty. It would rapidly fade away. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

Fighting today was completely benefiting the other side.

“Can you have some face? What happened to your integrity? Is this the dignity of the dark evil dragon race? You showed off so much but you want to just run? You might not care about your face, but what about mine?” demanded Long Chen.

Evilmoon was embarrassed and angered. Although its seal was undone, it had none of its core energy. It hadn’t expected Yun Shang to not leave him with the slightest bit of it. Evilmoon also didn’t want the first show of its power to end on such a lackluster note, but what else could be done?

BOOM!

The ground exploded as Long Chen and Ji Wuming flew back into the sky. Evilmoon’s black saber-images filled the sky, fighting against the starry sky unleashed by the Fantasy Star Sword. Each attack caused a world-shaking collision, showing people what a world-shaking battle truly was.

This world-shaking battle wasn’t being fought by two people in the same realm. No, it was a Life Star expert fighting across realms against a Netherpassage expert. People couldn’t help looking back at Xie Luo and the others.

Of the experts that had besieged Long Chen, only Xie Luo, Di Feng, and Yan Wei were left. However, they felt hopeless as they watched Long Chen fight Ji Wuming. Long Chen was like a giant mountain blocking their path. Let alone conquering this mountain, they weren’t even qualified to look up at it.

The battle continued. Eventually, Ji Wuming laughed upon noticing that after two hours of fighting, Long Chen’s aura was starting to fall.

“Hahaha, Long Chen, I have Heavenly Fate Island’s karmic luck supporting me! What are you going to use to fight me?!”
