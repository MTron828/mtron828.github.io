Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

The lean man was originally very pleased to see the furious expressions of the white dragon race’s experts. But at that moment, a lazy voice that dumbfounded everyone echoed out.

The lean man’s smile vanished, replaced with an icy cold. He shouted, “Who’s there? Get out here!”

“Youngster, don’t be too arrogant, or you’ll pay a frightening price for it.”

Following that, a black-robed man slowly walked out of the channel. All the experts from the Netherdragon race and the white dragon race stared at him.

Long Chen hadn’t planned on showing himself. However, when this fellow mentioned Netherdragon Tianzhao, his interest was piqued.

Last time, Netherdragon Tianzhao had offered himself to the Nether Emperor to escape from Long Chen. However, due to the karmic ties between Long Chen and the Nether Emperor, he had a feeling that Netherdragon Tianzhao would get in his way again.

However, after so much time had passed, he had almost forgotten Netherdragon Tianzhao’s name. For someone to suddenly bring the name up now, he had to investigate it.

“Who are you?” shouted the lean man once more.

Long Chen was hiding his aura even more deeply than the white-robed woman, so the lean man didn’t dare to make any rash moves.

“Do you think you’re qualified to ask who I am? Go back and call out Netherdragon Tianzhao!” declared Long Chen lightly.

“Courting death!” The lean man’s Blood Qi surged, accompanied by the roar of a dragon. A black Netherdragon materialized behind him, and he vanished into thin air.

Suddenly, an explosive noise ruptured the void. The onlookers barely had time to comprehend what had occurred before a figure hurtled through the air, crashing into the central throne of the vast hall like a shooting star. The tremendous force shattered the throne to pieces.

As the dust settled, a wretched figure emerged from the wreckage, leaving both the Netherdragon and white dragon race experts stunned by the sudden turn of events.

The white-robed woman was filled with shock. The events had unfolded so rapidly that others couldn’t comprehend what had happened, but she had witnessed it all. The lean man was extremely cunning; he had summoned his manifestation as a diversion. Just as it drew everyone’s attention away, he utilized a secret art to appear in front of Long Chen.

Meanwhile, Long Chen had initiated his attack even before the manifestation had fully formed. By the time his right arm was midway through its swing, the lean man suddenly materialized.

As if entirely by coincidence, Long Chen’s hand struck the lean man squarely in the face. It seemed as though the lean man was orchestrating with Long Chen to execute the perfect slap.

Other than the white-robed woman, no one else saw it because the lean man’s manifestation had drawn away all of their attention. In other words, this move would be effective against everyone here other than Long Chen and the white-robed woman.

“Little trash, playing sneak attacks? Doesn’t your face hurt?” asked Long Chen casually.

In truth, Long Chen was a bit surprised by the outcome. While he hadn’t coordinated with Lei Linger, this slap should have been enough to blast the lean man’s face apart.

However, he had underestimated this fellow’s constitution. Instead of causing severe damage, the slap merely left a handprint, and the lean man’s face only swelled slightly. His defenses were extremely tough.

Still reeling from the impact, the lean man struggled to fully comprehend what had just happened. His vision had momentarily blurred, leaving him feeling disoriented as the world spun around him.

Crawling out of the wreckage, he was met with the shocked gazes of the onlookers. Immediately, a burning sensation radiated from his face, and his head throbbed with pain.

“You damn bastard, die!”

He directly exploded with rage as he had never suffered such humiliation before.

BOOM!

As the lean man’s Blood Qi ignited, his aura grew explosively, causing the entire Ten Thousand Dragon Nest to tremble as if on the verge of collapse.

Within the lean man’s manifestation, a colossal dragon head materialized, its jaws gaping wide as it spat out a black sword toward Long Chen. The lean man’s face immediately turned pale after he had unleashed this move.

The giant sword carried with it an apocalyptic aura. In his fury, the lean man had unleashed his strongest attack.

In response, Long Chen’s saber appeared in his hand, its blade layered with twinkling stars. With a decisive motion, he brought the saber down in a swift slash.

BOOM!

A saber-image directly tore through the Ten Thousand Dragon Nest and struck the black sword, blasting it apart before continuing toward the lean man.

“What?!”

Thick terror gripped the lean man as he saw Long Chen easily cleave through his strongest attack. He had never envisioned that someone could overpower him in such a manner. Moreover, the attack continued its trajectory toward him, leaving him with no time to react.

In an instant, the attack passed through him, rendering him motionless and still.

The next moment, the Ten Thousand Dragon Nest quivered, and in front of everyone’s shocked gazes, it slowly split apart.

“He sliced the Ten Thousand Dragon Nest apart...!” The white dragon race’s experts were taken aback.

The lean man slowly followed the fate of the nest, splitting into two from top to bottom at the same time

Having long lost its energy and weakened over time, the Ten Thousand Dragon Nest couldn’t withstand the force of Long Chen’s attack. As Long Chen’s strike tore through it, the entire nest crumbled, engulfing the surroundings in a cloud of dust. The experts of the Netherdragon race looked on in horror at the destruction unfolding before them.

They wanted to run, yet their pride held them rooted in place. They wanted to fight, yet their instincts screamed at them that it was folly. Thus, they remained frozen in their original positions, too stunned to take any action.

After the nest collapsed, the world became calm once again. All the Netherdragon race and the white dragon race’s experts stared at Long Chen.

Slowly sheathing his saber, Long Chen looked at the lean man’s corpse and said, “I wasn’t planning on killing you. In fact, I disdained doing so. But you just had to have a dirty mouth. It’s dislikable.”

Long Chen had only planned on teaching him a lesson and obtaining information from his mouth to see if their Netherdragon Tianzhao was the one he knew.

Unfortunately, this fellow’s mouth just had to be so filthy; his words brought about his own downfall. With Long Chen’s astral energy infused into the blood-colored saber, there was virtually nothing it couldn’t break. Although it was unable to contain his entire astral energy, even a fraction of it was enough to kill the lean man.

After executing this slash, Long Chen felt pleasantly surprised. He hadn’t expected the saber to rapidly adapt to his astral energy, so the power of this blow exceeded his expectations.

At this moment, Long Chen turned to look at the Netherdragon race’s people and pointed to one of them.

“Have you ever seen Netherdragon Tianzhao?”

That unlucky guy quivered, but clenching his teeth, he forced himself to say, “I haven’t had such fortune.”

“Then scram! If you see Netherdragon Tianzhao, tell him that Long Chen told him to scrub the filth off his neck and wait. I don’t want his nasty shit staining my saber!”

Instantly, the experts of the Netherdragon race relaxed, their tension dissipating as they started to retreat. After all, Long Chen had no intention of pursuing them. Once they were sufficiently distant, they fled for their lives.

As they departed, Long Chen also planned on leaving when the white-robed woman said, “Friend, please wait!”
