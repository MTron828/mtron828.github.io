Chapter 3897 Silence of the Night

Faith energy covered the world, instantly devouring Dong Mingyu. At that moment, Dong Mingyu raised her dagger.

To their astonishment, Ji Wuming's dagger materialized right before Dong Mingyu, despite him still standing in his original position.

It was only when their daggers collided that Ji Wuming's figure revealed itself, appearing before Dong Mingyu from nowhere.

“Time domain?!” An expert cried out in shock. Within the faith energy domain, Ji Wuming’s time domain started to show its power. When he attacked, he was a hair faster than what people saw.

In other words, there was a delay between his actions and what others actually saw, posing a lethal threat to an ordinary expert. It stood as an inviolable law, an unstoppable force beyond anyone's control.

However, Dong Mingyu was somehow able to accurately stop an attack that surpassed time.

“You have two Supreme Bones capable of controlling time and space. But it’s too bad that your control is merely superficial. The profundities of time and space are something that you cannot grasp. Did you think disturbing spatial and temporal fluctuations would count as full control? You’re wrong. Time and space are relative concepts. It would work against laymen, but against assassins, with our sharp senses, we can grasp the changes to the flow of time and space. Thus, your time and space energy is useless against me. I can fully grasp the fluctuations of your control. If spacetime is water, then I am a fish. If the water flows calmly, that’s nice. If it starts growing chaotic, that’s fine with me too. I will simply adapt. Did you think you could use water to drown a fish?” asked Dong Mingyu indifferently.

“What nonsense. As long as the water current is chaotic enough, how will a little fish resist the flow? You will be crushed by the water pressure!” retorted Ji Wuming darkly.

“That’s correct. But with your crude control over spacetime, you are unable to harm me. Since the quality is lacking, you are trying to use quantity to win. But that is a fantasy like a fish climbing a tree.” Dong Mingyu shook her head.

“Cut the crap! We’ll see the truth right now!” Ji Wuming shouted furiously. All of a sudden, he vanished.

Dong Mingyu only snorted in response. Without even looking back, Dong Mingyu swiftly altered her grip on the dagger, clutching it in a reversed position, and swiftly swung it backward.

As a result, her dagger accurately and perfectly blocked Ji Wuming’s ephemeral attack. The effortless manner in which she accomplished this left onlookers astounded.

Ji Wuming’s body flickered and vanished. He unleashed dozens of attacks in a row. However, Dong Mingyu’s body didn’t even move. Like a beautiful dance, she blocked all of Ji Wuming’s attacks with her dagger.

The sound of daggers clashing was like a beautiful melody. But everyone knew that it was an overture of death where one mistake would be fatal.

Dong Mingyu appeared graceful as her dagger danced around her. Her moves were all clearly seen by everyone. However, Ji Wuming was striking like lightning and retreating like a phantom, leaving behind countless afterimages. He was fierce and sharp.

From a distance, it looked like a fairy was fighting an invisible devil. Every attack was fatally dangerous, causing the hearts of the spectators to race with intensity.

“It’s already been eighty-one moves. My master shouldn’t blame me if I kill you now.”

Dong Mingyu’s gaze suddenly turned cold. When she finally made her real move, an unknown black energy began to spread from her body.

The next moment, Ji Wuming’s dagger quivered as if drawn by some terrifying force. His dagger’s immense power dissipated like a clay ox falling into the ocean, vanishing without a trace. At the same time, his body contorted as it was pulled by an unseen force. Without hesitation, he unleashed his spatial energy to flee.

Even though he immediately retreated, he felt a sharp pain in his neck. He had been cut once again.

Ji Wuming was shocked, but even more, he was incensed. This was his third time having his throat cut, an absolutely unbearable humiliation to a peak assassin like him.

However, before he could even do anything in his rage, Dong Mingyu’s dagger fell on him again. Dagger-images filled the sky, piercing toward him like a tempest.

Ji Wuming hastily blocked, but Dong Mingyu’s attacks were too fast. Some were fakes, while some were fatally powerful. There were several times that Ji Wuming was injured when he tried to block a fake.

At this moment, there was no time for him to counterattack. He could only rely on his instincts to block and stay alive. In just a moment, he was covered in blood.

However, it went without saying that Ji Wuming was powerful. Every time, he managed to avoid getting struck in a vital spot. Although he was repeatedly injured, they weren’t serious injuries.

“Faith energy condensed into armor? An assassin wearing armor? Master is right, your Bloodkill Hall is a disgrace to the assassin world. The Nine Underworld Hall is much stronger than you,” said Dong Mingyu coldly as she attacked.

There were several times when Dong Mingyu’s attacks almost left serious injuries, but an invisible armor would draw the dagger away from his vitals.Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Thus, Ji Wuming looked to be badly wounded, but those injuries were unable to pose any substantial damage to him. This invisible faith armor was his life-protecting trump card.

“Bullshit! Assassins are willing to use any means necessary for their goal, and the goal of an assassin can only be one thing! That is to eliminate their target! No matter how great your assassination arts are, if you can’t kill your target, you are still nothing more than useless trash!” shouted Ji Wuming furiously.

“Assassins are assassins, not rogues. If you are an assassin, you must have an assassin’s professionality and integrity. Assassins must have their own rules and bottom lines, or they will be no more than coarse butchers. You have no faith, yet you gather faith energy. You are a conman. Your master Enpuda is the greatest conman of all, tricking followers into giving him their faith energy to strengthen himself. While using rules to bind his followers, he follows no rules himself. He is shameless to the peak. That is why your master is called the Base Killing God,” sneered Dong Mingyu.

“Tch, what do you know?! What nonsense!” raged Ji Wuming. He respected Enpuda the most, and these insults were even more infuriating than when she insulted him.

“Nonsense? Haha, you must not know. My life was almost ruined by him, as the old me was one of his followers. I believed in that sanctimonious fellow and almost brought about my own demise. Fortunately, big brother Long Chen used his kindness to rouse me from his con. He opened a window for me that let me see the light. At that time, I swore to destroy the Bloodkill Hall so that its poison would never harm anyone again. Today will be my first step. I’ll use your head as a challenge to Enpuda.”

Dong Mingyu's voice grew increasingly frigid, accompanied by a deepening density of her killing intent. Suddenly, she swiftly formed one-handed seals, an ominous sign of impending danger.

“Silence of the Night!”

In an instant, this world became covered in darkness. Within this darkness, an eerie and absolute silence prevailed, stifling any semblance of sound.
