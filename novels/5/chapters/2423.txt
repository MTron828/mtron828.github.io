Chapter 2413 Heaven Swallowing Sun Hunting

Translator: BornToBe

The sword was translucent and had multicolored light flowing within it. Bursts of divine pressure exuded from it, stabbing their souls.

This sword was just lying there. If it was actually used to fight, wouldn’t its power directly shatter a person’s soul even before it struck?

“What gold? It’s not like you use swords,” said Long Chen. This sword was definitely a priceless treasure, but with their power, it would be a fool’s dream to take it. They were unable to even approach it.

“Hehe, since it’s a priceless treasure, it definitely has destiny with me. There’s a divine pool as well over there.” Mo Nian was delighted and seemed confident that it would be his.

Behind the platform with the sword was a divine pool. Dark red liquid that looked like blood filled it. There were strange ripples within the pool.

One scene after another appeared within it. Looking closely, Long Chen said, “This is Hong Yaoyang’s tomb. He buried his past life here.”

All the images that were appearing within the pool contained Hong Yaoyang. They were scenes of his cultivation, or his past battles, as well as some childhood memories.

“It seems that the legends are true. When you become a god, you have to leave behind your past to start a new beginning. But no one is willing to erase their memories, so they bury them. Long Chen, this pool definitely contains Hong Yaoyang’s experience in reaching godhood. You should take it. Then you’ll have his experience and will be able to cultivate far easier. You won’t have a single bottleneck,” said Mo Nian.

“Are you an idiot? Your cultivation path will definitely be affected by him if you absorb it. Walking another person’s path isn’t a good thing,” said Long Chen.

Although it would allow a person’s cultivation path to become flat and easy to traverse, another person’s path would sooner or later reach an end. Long Chen’s goal wasn’t just to become a god. Furthermore, to tell the truth, he disdained touching Hong Yaoyang’s legacy.

“You’re the idiot. Once you become a god, you’ll bury your past anyway. Then you won’t be affected at all,” said Mo Nian.

Long Chen shook his head. “My path is different from others. I definitely don’t want this fellow’s inheritance.”

“You’re the one who said that, so don’t say that I don’t give you good stuff first,” chortled Mo Nian.

Long Chen frowned. “Don’t tell me that you’re really going to take his inheritance? I’m telling you, it’s too dangerous.”

Long Chen had thought that Mo Nian was just joking at first, but now it seemed that he was serious. If he really did this, he wouldn’t have a chance to regret it.

“Hehe, who do you think I am? Do you think I’d do something so foolish? After my years of graverobbing- archaeology, do you think all my experience is for naught? As long as I absorb his inheritance, everything of his will be mine, and everything that is mine will remain mine. They won’t get mixed together at all. Furthermore, when I don’t want his things, I can directly erase them.” Mo Nian patted his chest confidently.

“Fine, since you’re so confident, go ahead. Do you need me to do anything?” asked Long Chen.

Mo Nian thought about it. “That’s a problem. The pool, sword, and husk are all treasures. The pool contains his experience in attaining godhood and can assist me in becoming a god. The sword contains endless divine energy that can help the Five Element Sun Hunting Bow progress. The husk contains the full inheritance of that fellow, including his cultivation technique and magical arts. They’re all important. But they’re definitely linked to Hong Yaoyang’s true body. Once we touch them, he’ll definitely sense it. Most likely, the divine pool is the only thing that can be absorbed without him instantly sensing it. I can’t think of anything about the rest. We’re in a rush, so I’ll absorb the blood pool and we’ll head out,” sighed Mo Nian. He was very unwilling to just leave these treasures.

“Wait, you said that your Five Element Sun Hunting Bow can absorb the divine energy of the sword? Are you telling the truth?” asked Long Chen suddenly.

Based on what he knew, Mo Nian’s Five Element Sun Hunting Bow might be powerful, but it hadn’t reached the point of being able to take power from that sword. After all, that sword was incredibly strong. It contained Hong Yaoyang’s full power from before he became a god.

Although Hong Yaoyang hadn’t been a god at that time, his divine item had been marked by him as a god. Ignoring whether or not the Five Element Sun Hunting Bow was even capable of taking energy from it, even if it could absorb the energy, wouldn’t it directly explode?

“Are you looking down on me? Just take a look at this.” Mo Nian waved his hand, summoning a three-inch-long translucent bow. If Long Chen didn’t recall how the Five Element Sun Hunting Bow looked, he wouldn’t have recognized it.

At this moment, it was very small, but there were nine holes on it with whirlpools on top of them absorbing energy.

“Since we’re brothers, I’ll share this secret with you. Even within the Mo family, no one but me knows this. The two ancestors of the Mo family had a grand plan called the Heaven Swallowing Project. Their goal was to transform the Five Element Sun Hunting Bow into the Heaven Swallowing Sun Hunting Bow. Through my years of archaeology, I’ve started to turn it into the shape of the Heaven Swallowing Sun Hunting Bow. These nine whirlpools exist to absorb all kinds of divine energy. Anything that would be favorable to its transformation will be automatically sucked in. If it wouldn’t help, it’s rejected. Let me put it to you this way: as long as I have the right resources, I can allow the Heaven Swallowing Sun Hunting Bow to grow without limit,” said Mo Nian proudly.

Long Chen was really shocked now. The Mo family’s ancestors had truly come up with a great plan.

“To sum up, I’ll be getting stronger and stronger, but don’t worry, I’ll look after you. I’ll be toying with the people who have offended us every day in the future,” said Mo Nian. “I’m going to absorb the pool. Then let’s head out.”

“Wait a minute,” said Long Chen suddenly.

“What is it?”

“Since you have that ability, let’s get it all.”

“I want to as well, but it’s not possible. We don’t have time for anything complicated either.”

If they had enough time, they could study the runes around this place and think of a way to cut off their connection or screen off this place, but they didn’t have enough time. They had to return for the Star Field Divine World.

“I will think of a way to hold back Hong Yaoyang so you have enough time to absorb it all. I’ll also leave the Heaven Flipping Seal with you so we can stay in touch. Ling-er will come with me,” said Long Chen.

He needed the Demon Moon Furnace with him, but then he wouldn’t be able to stay in touch with Mo Nian. He needed a divine item standing guard over Mo Nian’s astral space in order to stay connected. Furthermore, that divine item needed to be linked to his own soul as well. With Evilmoon guarding his true body, the Heaven Flipping Seal was the best option.

“You, hold back Hong Yaoyang? Are you crazy?” demanded Mo Nian. That was the god of this world.

“I estimate that I can stall him for two hours. Work hard to take everything as fast as possible,” said Long Chen.

“You sound serious.” Mo Nian couldn’t believe his ears.

“Of course. Don’t absorb the pool for now. When I’m ready, I’ll give you the signal through the Heaven Flipping Seal.”

Long Chen flew off, leaving a bewildered Mo Nian. He felt like Long Chen was about to do something crazy.

Going out through the way that they had come in, Long Chen didn’t see anything odd. He was about to fly out when he sensed something and hastily hid.

A group of armored warriors flew through the air right above him. They flew into a spatial channel, which was where the Netherpassage Path was according to Mo Nian. It was unknown if they were sent to hunt him down as well. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“It seems that those are the Nether warriors that Mo Nian mentioned. They’re comparable to third step Netherpassage experts. It seems that Mo Nian really has some ability to be able to survive after being hunted down by them.” Long Chen nodded in admiration upon sensing their power.

The current Mo Nian had yet to pass his tribulation. He was still stuck in the Life Star realm. For him to stay alive and be able to probe the tomb of a Nethergod in this state showed that he was definitely a marvel.

Once they were gone, Long Chen waited a bit longer and came out again. Closing his eyes and sensing the world, he smiled. If this was the Netherworld, then the karmic hell flames were definitely present. He sensed their fluctuations.

He began rushing over in that direction, using the Celestial Lightning Body Blink at full power to speed away. After an incense stick’s worth of time, he stopped in front of an ancient pagoda. The pagoda only had one level, but it was unleashing an incredibly evil air. That air was something Long Chen was familiar with because he had entered it before.

This was Purgatory. From the outside, it looked like a pagoda. When he had escaped from Purgatory back then, he hadn’t managed to see this form of it.

“Leng Yueyan said that the karmic hell flames were within Purgatory. It seems that this is the place.”

Long Chen took a deep breath. He clasped his hands together and began to chant. The sound of a sacred scripture began to ring out.
