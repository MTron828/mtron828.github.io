Chapter 3467 The Second Form of Split the Heavens

Enpuda himself was dumbfounded, not knowing what was going on. It had clearly been a flawless plan, but it had suddenly taken an incomprehensible turn.

Five World King experts wielding divine weapons of the Netherworld that had death qi whirling around them attacked Enpuda and Liao Bencang, sending them stumbling back.

BOOM!

In the distance, Long Chen and the Nine Underworld Luocha once more clashed. Long Chen no longer had any misgivings. There was nothing he needed to hold back now. After this attack, a flame lotus appeared in his left hand.

“World Extermination Flame Lotus!”

The flame lotus flew at the Nine Underworld Luocha. In return, the Luocha image behind her clasped its hands together, and they formed a giant shield in front of her.

“Luocha Guard!” the Nine Underworld Luocha shouted, and countless runes appeared on the Luocha’s hands, forming a layer around her.

BOOM!

The World Extermination Flame Lotus smashed into the clasped hands. Flames and runes weaved together and exploded at the same time.

“Split the Heavens 2!” Long Chen shouted, unleashing another heavenly saber at her.

The Nine Underworld Luocha was shocked. Only now did she realize that Long Chen’s flame lotus had been nothing more than something to draw her vision. It concealed the true killing blow.

Long Chen’s techniques came too quickly. Now, it was already too late for her to unleash the Luocha Soul Extermination Stab, so she clenched her teeth. The spots on her face suddenly quivered and seemed to come to life.

“Blood Soul Sacrifice, Luocha Possession!”

Following that, her flesh withered in an instant. She was like a skeleton covered in a layer of skin now. But the Luocha manifestation behind her instantly solidified as if it now possessed a body of flesh and blood.

She merged into her manifestation, transforming into the Luocha. She had completely finished the Luocha Possession.

The current her had multiplied in power, and countless runes flowed within her body.

BOOM!

When Long Chen’s saber fell, the Nine Underworld Luocha received his attack with her dagger. The two divine weapons struck each other, and a half sphere of energy exploded out of both of them. Two opposing forces crashed against each other.

Long Chen felt like a sea was flipping inside of him, so he coughed up a mouthful of blood. In the Luocha Possession, she actually possessed the power of time. Because of it, Long Chen was injured.

However, the Nine Underworld Luocha didn’t fare better. Long Chen had unleashed a full-power attack, while she had been forced to make a hasty defense. Now, blood was pouring out of her seven orifices.

“Damnable bastard, I am from the great Luocha race! You dare to injure me!? I will tear your corpse into ten thousand pieces!” The Nine Underworld Luocha shrieked. As if possessed by a ghoul, she charged at Long Chen.

“A little Luocha race dares to call itself great? Today, I will beat you into a paste.” Long Chen wiped the blood off of his mouth. His injuries instantly healed. With the Wood Foundation Divine Trees, he wasn’t afraid of being injured.nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

“Split the Heavens 2!”

Long Chen once more raised his saber, unleashing his simplest, most direct attack. He had no need for flashy techniques. This was a clash of power, of who was stronger.

“Luocha Soul Extermination Stab!” the Nine Underworld Luocha roared.

Both of them unleashed their strongest attacks again. The Nine Underworld Luocha’s eyes were red. Long Chen wanted a direct clash, and she also wanted a direct clash.

Both of them had the utmost confidence in their power. One was a terrifying nine star heir, while the other was a heavenly genius of the Nine Underworld Hall that had received the inheritance of the Luocha race. They both believed that they were the strongest.

BOOM!

BOOM!

BOOM!

Everyone was amazed and horrified to see Long Chen and the Nine Underworld Luocha clash three times with their strongest attacks. They used their ultimate moves as if they were free.

Every attack caused the stars to quiver and the world to shake. It was truly a heaven-shaking battle.

Seeing this, the disciples inside the academy all felt their blood heating up. Long Chen was their unbeatable god. His divine power seemed boundless, and his confidence and arrogance made them feel reverent.

After three all-out clashes, Long Chen’s arm was numb. He didn’t know how many times his internal organs had been destroyed and healed, but he still wasn’t afraid. Instead, his battle intent continued to pour out of him. Facing a powerful opponent only made him feel more excited.

As for the Nine Underworld Luocha, she was also injured. More blood was pouring out of her seven orifices. Furthermore, this blood was black. Cracks had even appeared on her forehead.

“Split the Heavens…”

Long Chen once more raised his saber, causing the Nine Underworld Luocha’s expression to change. Long Chen’s power seemed limitless. He was practically a monster. On the other hand, her Luocha Possession had already reached its limit.

As her cultivation base wasn’t high enough, she was still unable to fully merge with her Luocha manifestation. She could only sacrifice her flesh to temporarily merge with it.

However, this state could not be maintained for long. Once time was up, she wouldn’t even be able to keep up her manifestation. If her manifestation was broken, her sacrificed flesh would never return, and that would be a fatal blow to her.

“So your life is tough. Once I finish merging with the Luocha, I will come take your life.” The Nine Underworld Luocha snorted and suddenly formed hand seals.

However, just then, Long Chen appeared in front of her and swung his saber, cutting off her hands.

“I knew that you wouldn’t be able to beat me. You want to run? Leave your life behind first,” sneered Long Chen.

A huge saber-image had appeared just then, but now he was suddenly attacking normally, with such speed that it practically toppled people’s understanding.

It had to be known that normally, once an ultimate attack was brewing, it couldn’t be pulled back. That would essentially be attacking themselves with their power. So, at this moment, Long Chen had completely gone against the common sense of the Martial Dao.

In truth, after three all-out attacks, he could clearly sense that she had reached her limit. That was why Long Chen had only acted out the fourth attack to scare her.

Just as Long Chen expected, the Nine Underworld Luocha didn’t dare to fight him again. She was forming hand seals to flee, and she needed to gather her mental energy to escape from the lock of his saber.

As a result of the distraction, she hadn’t expected Long Chen to switch techniques and cut off her hands.

Long Chen originally wanted to cut off her head, but such an attack would definitely be instantly sensed by her and might lead to failure. Thus, to be safe, he first cut off her hands, making it so that she couldn’t form hand seals temporarily.

BOOM!

After cutting off her hands, his saber struck like lightning, piercing toward her head. A divine shield appeared before her.

The Nine Underworld Luocha was terrified. The Luocha manifestation behind her had vanished, condensing into a fist-sized shield in front of her head.

Long Chen’s saber quivered and that shield began to crack. Having lost her hands, the Nine Underworld Luocha could only use her will to control her power. She was unable to concentrate all her energy. Feeling terrified, she cried out, “Hall master, save me!”

BOOM!

That shield finally broke apart. Long Chen’s saber pierced through it and her head.

However, when he stabbed her head, he suddenly sensed something wrong. This wasn’t the feeling of stabbing flesh.

“A substitution art?”

Long Chen was startled. He didn’t have time to pull back his saber. So, a lightning spear appeared in his left hand, and he stabbed it downward to his left.

BOOM!

As a result, the void collapsed and the Nine Underworld Luocha’s figure reappeared. However, half her body was gone, and she let out a miserable shriek. Having lost the protection of her Luocha manifestation, she appeared incredibly weak.

“Die!”

Long Chen then swung that puppet that looked identical to the Nine Underworld Luocha off of his saber and swung his saber at her.

Just then, a blood-colored dagger pierced through the air. A chilling killing intent made Long Chen’s back feel icy cold.
