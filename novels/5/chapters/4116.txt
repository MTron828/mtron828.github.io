Chapter 4105 Dropping Jaws

Long Chen and his companions trailed behind Xu Changchuan. They hadn't traveled a great distance before they encountered another gate. This gateway was teeming with countless creatures that exuded an ominous black aura as they surged forth.

Fortunately, in front of the gates, countless experts of the Fullmoon race were slaughtering the creatures with sharp blades as they came out.

These creatures possessed two legs and four arms, standing at a towering height of over three meters. Their large heads bore an uncanny resemblance to a fusion of a bull and a donkey, featuring prominent horns that jutted out horizontally rather than pointing upwards.

Moreover, they gave off powerful energy fluctuations, placing them at around the human race‚Äôs World King realm. Their sharp claws curved like hooks, while their muscular bodies exuded a daunting presence. Even a mere swipe of the claws would cause an ear-piercing sonic boom.

‚ÄúWhat powerful physical bodies.‚Äù

Guo Ran and the others were shocked. These creatures were actually much stronger than average World Kings. Most terrifying of all, they came out in an unending stream from the gate. With millions of them already out, just who knew how many were still behind the gate?

The Fullmoon race‚Äôs experts slaughtered these creatures with all their power, but they were slowly forced back. After all, without a Heaven Venerate standing guard over this place, they were at a disadvantage.

‚ÄúBrother Long, can you help?‚Äù shouted Xu Changchuan. He was already charging toward the vanguard.

In truth, there was no need for him to shout. Guo Ran and the others were already flying over. They had never seen these lifeforms before, and it just so happened that they wanted to experience their power.

As soon as the Dragonblood warriors entered the battlefield, they were like a sharp blade stabbing into their ranks. When their swords danced, those powerful dark creatures were instantly hacked apart. As a result, black blood rained down, dyeing the ground.

The Dragonblood warriors didn‚Äôt even need to work together. They all fought on their own, slaughtering these creatures, akin to tigers pouncing on a pack of sheep. They were even more ferocious, even more violent than these dark creatures, as every slash of their swords slew their enemies.

‚ÄúWhat‚Ä¶?‚Äù

Xu Changchuan was in the midst of preparing one of his powerful moves when he saw the Dragonblood warriors tear through the enemies. He was stunned.

He knew that Long Chen was powerful, but he didn‚Äôt expect that every single one of his subordinates was also so powerful.

As soon as they joined the battlefield, they stopped the tide of dark creatures. They used violence against violence, with no other technique to speak of.

Just over four hundred Dragonblood warriors formed an arc around the gate, and the battlefield was emptied in an instant. Xu Changchuan and the rest of the Fullmoon race‚Äôs experts were dumbfounded.

The people in front of them were merely Immortal Kings, but World King dark creatures were slaughtered like blasting through rotten wood. They had never seen such a thing before.

With each strike from the Dragonblood warriors, significant casualties were inflicted upon the enemy ranks. Despite the relentless attacks, the Dragonblood warriors moved with a sense of ease through the chaos of battle. The situation appeared perilous, yet any impending threat seemed to vanish just before it could materialize.

Looking at their stunned expressions, Long Chen felt a burst of pride inside of him. Even in the immortal world, the Dragonblood warriors could form an unrivaled legion.

With the alarm sounding, Heaven Venerates quickly appeared. However, when they arrived, they were also dumbfounded.

They saw the Dragonblood Legion completely surrounding the gate, their battle line gradually shrinking until they completely clogged the gate. This shocking efficiency amazed even the Heaven Venerates.

‚ÄúThis really is a good place. If the enemies were a bit stronger and their numbers could be controlled, it would be even better,‚Äù said Xia Chen.

The Dragonblood warriors recently lacked decent opponents, so they could only train by exchanging pointers themselves. But that had a limited effect. After all, the Dragonblood warriors couldn‚Äôt possibly use their killer blows against each other. Thus, they rarely fought each other in combat, in order to not forget the true meaning of battle was to kill as efficiently as possible.

When it came to the Dragonblood warriors, perhaps their actual talent wasn‚Äôt the greatest, but the trump card that allowed them to fight across realms was their immense combat experience. The moment they exchanged blows with their enemies, they could instantly see through the weaknesses of their enemies and kill them in one blow.

After all, every Dragonblood warrior had followed Long Chen out of mountains of corpses and seas of blood, so they were completely fearless toward death and group battles. It was like they were born for battle. Only in combat could they understand the true essence of life.

Furthermore, fighting strong foes and evil lifeforms fueled their love for combat and improved their fighting skills. Surprisingly, Long Chen hadn‚Äôt given the Dragonblood warriors that many pointers; he only provided them with medicinal pills and wealth.

It was normally Xia Chen and Guo Ran who trained them in formations and group battles. As for each individual‚Äôs skills, they had to rely on themselves to grasp their own specialties. Thus, every person in the Dragonblood Legion had their own fighting styles and paths.VIss·ªãT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).ùò§ùëúùìÇ for the best novel reading experience

Perhaps that was precisely what allowed them to work together to make up for each other‚Äôs shortcomings and play off each other‚Äôs strengths. Presently, what they precisely needed was to accumulate more individual experience. When attacks came from every direction, the pressure would give them insights and let them grow. Otherwise, there wasn‚Äôt any meaning behind it.

For the Dragonblood Legion, this kind of battle was no different than a meal. But the Fullmoon race‚Äôs experts were utterly amazed, their jaws agape. They had never seen such a tough legion before.

In just an incense stick‚Äôs worth of time, the Dragonblood Legion had forced the tide back to the spatial gate, leaving the ground littered with corpses. No one knew just how many dark creatures they had slain.

In the end, the spatial gate stopped quivering, and no more dark creatures came out. A few breaths later, all the dark creatures were slain.

The Dragonblood warriors then sheathed their swords, their movements perfectly in unison. At the same time, their explosive auras vanished and they returned to their normal appearances. All of them were calm as if nothing had happened.

There wasn‚Äôt the slightest nervousness nor the slightest excitement. It was like this had been entirely insignificant.

‚ÄúHow was it?‚Äù asked Long Chen.

Guo Ran said, ‚ÄúThese dark creatures only have violence in their heads, so their intelligence is extremely low. Also, they don‚Äôt know fear and only attack based on their instincts. Their bodies are very strange though. Their skulls are tough, while their horns and claws are comparable to World Domain divine items. But their necks, armpits, and knees are fatal weak spots. They have high offense and low defense. To sum it up, they‚Äôre excellent training partners.‚Äù

Guo Ran was also moved. If they could gather the Dragonblood Legion in such a place, then having these creatures to train with would let them rapidly improve.

The Dragonblood warriors were now at the late stage Immortal King realm, so their rate of growth had slowed down, along with their absorption of medicinal pills. After all, without high level battles to stimulate themselves, they couldn‚Äôt advance that quickly.

‚ÄúBrother Long, if you like this place, we can give you this world.‚Äù

When Xu Changchuan heard their conversation, he was pleasantly surprised and made a shocking offer.
