Chapter 3603

Guo Ran and the others charged toward Clear Rain City. Seeing them, those devil beasts that were attacking the formation actually retreated. They just abandoned the battered city.

Hence, Guo Ran and the others effortlessly entered the city.

“Traitors appeared in our Clear Rain City. They were the ones who sent out the distress signal. There’s already no way to protect this city, and now we’ve also implicated you. I… I…” The city lord was filled with shame and guilt.

“Senior, don’t blame yourself. Even our own Heavenly Dragon Divine Armor College produced hundreds of traitors. It’s not something to be ashamed of. Furthermore, no matter what kind of situation you’re in, sending out that distress signal was the right choice. We are all part of the human race. If you don’t ask for aid from us, who will you ask? Don’t talk about implicating anyone. As long as there is the slightest hope, we will still fight to the death together, for nothing else other than the fact that we also have the blood of the human race flowing within our bodies,” comforted Long Chen.

Although he had only met this city lord once before, Long Chen could tell he was someone responsible and diligent.

He was the one who had noticed the huge trap set up around the city. He had realized that they were planning on using Clear Rain City as bait, so any reinforcements would be sending themselves to their deaths.

The urgent distress signal was then sent out by traitors within the city. By the time the city lord found out, it was too late. He wanted to tell everyone not to fall for it, but the communication formations were already broken by those traitors, making him unable to send out word.

Most hateful of all, those traitors also broke the other formations within the city. Although they were all slain in the end, they still dealt a mortal blow to the city.

Even when all the experts of the city were fighting with all their power, they were using up half a year’s worth of resources in just an incense stick’s worth of time. Those experts all knew that they were definitely dead and could only hope to bring down as many enemies as they could with them.

When they had already given up hope, the Heavenly Dragon Divine Armor College’s battleships appeared. The city lord was gratified but also sad about that.

“City lord, you should rest. The warriors of the Clear Rain City have fought the first half of this battle bravely. Leave this next half to my Heavenly Dragon Divine Armor College. We will get revenge for those fallen warriors so that they can rest in peace,” said Guo Ran. He then shouted, “Defensive battleships, set up the formation!”

Of the three hundred battleships, one hundred of them separated from the group. Their runes lit up and connected, forming a giant barrier around Clear Rain City.

Xie Liuer, Leng Hui, and the others were surprised by this. They had simply assumed that all three hundred battleships were offensive ones.

Defensive battleships were mobile fortresses with almost unbreakable defenses. They were normally used to provide cover or protect other battleships in battle.

Moreover, the defensive barrier created by a hundred of these battleships was dozens of times stronger than Clear Rain City’s defensive barrier. As a result, the city that was on the verge of collapse instantly became an impenetrable stronghold.

“Dean Guo Ran truly is wise and farsighted. Your vision has instantly resolved the most pressing matter, and we can fight freely,” praised Xie Liuer.

“After living for so many years, have you not learned anything? If you do this again, I really will get angry.” Guo Ran glared at Xie Liuer.

Xie Liuer once more realized that she had misspoken. This was all Long Chen’s preparations. Her praise of Guo Ran was viewed as a mockery by Guo Ran.

Just then, countless spatial gates opened, and an army of devil beasts came flooding out. The world lost its original color as the army of devil beasts filled all of heaven and earth.

“Stop wasting time talking. Ignore the devil beasts and find the hidden battleships!” barked Long Chen.

Guo Ran had long since taken out a compass with a quivering golden needle. It quickly pointed and stopped in a certain direction.

“Found them. Everyone, charge!”

Guo Ran smiled delightedly. Putting away the compass, he took the lead, charging out like a black shooting star. As soon as Guo Ran moved, Xie Liuer, Leng Hui, Xie Qianqian, Tu Hu, and the others immediately followed. Following them were the three hundred starry river warriors, as well as the two hundred battleships. They all charged toward one mountain.

“Split the Heavens 1!”

Guo Ran roared and his battle armor lit up. A giant saber-image then soared into the sky and slashed into the mountain.

BOOM!

The giant mountain exploded and the immense power even caused the entire world to tremble. The spatial gates were shaking. The power of this blow was enough to shatter the heavens.

When the mountain crumbled, black battleships came tumbling out of the dirt. Dirt and rubble flew in every direction.

Guo Ran’s attack was truly stunning. Seeing it, Clear Rain City’s experts were invigorated. This was not just a display of absolute power but also a release of their rage.

This attack forced out the black battleships hidden underground. The reason Guo Ran was able to find them was all thanks to the special compass that Xue Yifan had given him. Just as Long Chen had said, the old dean had long since paved the road for him.

Those battleships were hidden underground and had a formation to cover up their auras. They had not expected someone to be able to find them. Since that was the case, their defensive runes were not activated, and they were badly battered by this attack.

“Kill!”

Xie Liuer, Leng Hui, Xie Qianqian, Tu Hu, and the others had long since been waiting for them and immediately attacked them as they were tumbling through the air.

One attack after another smashed into those battleships. Explosions rang out. Countless cracks and holes appeared in them.

Battleships had shocking defensive powers, and most people had difficulty damaging them in normal times. However, these battleships were not in a combat state. With their runes not activated, everyone’s attacks immediately caused a great deal of damage to them.

Furthermore, Xie Qianqian and the others were professionals. Their attacks were targeting the weakest areas of the battleships. Once the runes there were broken, the battleship’s power would plummet.

There were over four hundred of those hidden battleships. Without even having a chance to summon their power, those battleships were already severely damaged. Some of them were so badly damaged that there was no longer any way for them to activate their defensive power.

BOOM!

Suddenly, a giant hole appeared in one of the battleships. A black figure came flying out of that hole. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

It was Guo Ran. With his Devil Dragon Battle Armor’s sharpness, he accurately pierced through a weak spot in a battleship. With that, it was fully crippled. On his own, he had forcibly ruined a high level battleship, so the Heavenly Dragon Divine Armor College and Clear Rain City’s experts let out a burst of cheers. Their morale reached an unprecedented height.

BOOM!

Guo Ran suddenly raised his saber, and the battleship that he had pierced through exploded. Amidst the raging flames, Guo Ran’s voice rang out clearly.

“Offensive battleships, crush the enemy ships!”

Just at this moment, the Heavenly Dragon Divine Armor College’s battleships entered the perfect firing range. Rays of divine light shot out, and a wave of light drowned the entire world.
