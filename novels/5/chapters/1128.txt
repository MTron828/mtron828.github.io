Chapter 1129 The Plan for Fostering

Translator: BornToBe

All of them jumped in fright. Guo Ran had actually been directly pulled into the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow’s stomach by some strange force. It was too fast for anyone to react. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

Guo Ran didn’t even understand what was going on before he landed in its stomach.

“Cloud, spit him out!” cried Meng Qi.

The Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow opened its mouth and spat out Guo Ran. Right now, he was covered in his armor.

“Cloud, you can’t act like this! You have to differentiate between friends and enemies,” chided Meng Qi.

The Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow let out a few chirps that sounded wronged. That stunned Long Chen and Tang Wan-er. How did this hatchling already possess such high intelligence?

Meng Qi listened carefully for a long time and couldn’t help but break into a smile. “Cloud says that Guo Ran said it was ugly, so Guo Ran’s a bad person.”

Guo Ran was pale. Just now, when he had been swallowed into its stomach, he had felt a strange force, and he had instinctively summoned his armor.

Several thin cracks had appeared on his armor. Those lines were very thin, as if strings had cut into it.

Guo Ran’s armor was made of material on the level of King items. It was incredibly hard, and weapons had difficulty causing any damage to it. It was unknown what kind of force had caused these marks.

If it had instead been a body of flesh and blood, how could it endure such power? Wouldn’t it be instantly torn through? Just thinking about it made Guo Ran’s expression change. Just now, he had walked past the gates of hell.

The Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow once more chirped a few times, and Meng Qi laughed. “Cloud says that it was just trying to scare you as a punishment for calling it ugly. It wasn’t really trying to eat you.”

Long Chen looked at the marks on Guo Ran’s armor and couldn’t help being shocked. The Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow had only just been born, but it already possessed such terrifying power. It was truly worthy of being a legendary existence.

“Cloud is able to speak to you already?” asked Long Chen.

“Our souls are connected. If it wants to express something, I can understand it. The translation won’t be one hundred percent right, but there won’t be any big deviations. As a Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow, it possesses its innate skills even though it just hatched. Any flesh swallowed by it will be cut into pieces by the strands of energy within it. It possesses spatial energy and an innate devouring ability, so even huge Magical Beasts can be swallowed in one gulp. As for a matured Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow, it could gulp down all lifeforms within a thousand miles just by opening its mouth. That was what earned it the name Heaven Swallowing.”

Meng Qi gently patted its head as she explained. The Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow seemed to enjoy Meng Qi’s pampering.

“Isn’t that a bit too fierce? It doesn’t even have fea- I mean, it’s already so strong after just being born.” Guo Ran clearly hadn’t recognized what it was, or he wouldn’t have ended up in his previous plight.

The Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow was just a hatchling right now, and it truly did look a bit ugly. It looked like it would take a while for it to grow feathers.

As an ancient beast with a terrifying inheritance, the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow’s growth speed wasn’t very fast. It also required plenty of resources.

“Long Chen, this little one might make us poor again...” said Meng Qi worriedly.

The Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow chirped a few times, embarrassing Meng Qi. Its intelligence was truly high, and it basically understood her words. It said that it could eat a bit less.

That made her feel warm and ashamed. Back then, that powerful tenth rank Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow had given her one of her children, only because she had been helpless.

The Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow would require an ocean’s worth of resources once it was born. Normally, the mother would use its own essence blood as feed.

But that tenth rank Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow had been injured, and she didn’t have enough essence blood to raise both children. She had had no choice but to sacrifice one.

Now, after a moment of excitement, Meng Qi realized a serious problem. This little one was in an extremely hungry state right now.

That was very likely because the mother had already decided to abandon it, and so she hadn’t spent enough of her essence blood on it after a while. That led to an innate deficiency that made it feel exceptionally hungry now that it was born.

This wasn’t true hunger, but the result of being deficient in some kind of energy. It would need more resources to make up for its innate weakness.

Now it was incredibly hungry, so hungry that even Meng Qi felt unwell. She hadn’t expected its appetite to be so great. The food she had prepared wasn’t even close to enough.

She took out a few more food balls. Those were originally stock for the future, but she couldn’t bear to see it so hungry.

The Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow surprisingly didn’t eat the food balls. That made Meng Qi even more ashamed. As a Beast Tamer, she wasn’t even able to raise a housepet.

“Don’t worry and eat it. I’ll handle the rest and won’t let you starve.” Long Chen comforted Cloud. If he couldn’t even raise such a little fellow, what kind of man would he be?

Unexpectedly, Cloud ran over to Long Chen’s side and rubbed its head against Long Chen happily.

“Cloud says that it remembers your aura, and that you’re a good person. But Guo Ran is bad, so don’t stay with him,” laughed Meng Qi.

Guo Ran rolled his eyes. Wasn’t his only offense not praising it? Was it worth sowing dissension?

Long Chen was startled. He supposed it only made sense that you couldn’t judge such an ancient species with common sense. If it remembered his aura, that meant it had memories from when it was just an egg.

Cloud devoured several more beast balls. However, it didn’t treat Tang Wan-er very enthusiastically. To it, Tang Wan-er was still an outsider.

But Tang Wan-er very much adored it, constantly stroking it, and Cloud didn’t refuse. Guo Ran went to try to repair their awkward relationship, and as a result, Cloud simply opened its mouth and he fled in terror, vanishing like a wisp of smoke while Meng Qi and Tang Wan-er laughed.

“Whatever it needs, get it with points. Money isn’t a problem. Letting it grow up healthy is the most important point, and it’s the only way to pay back senior’s trust,” said Long Chen to Meng Qi.

“But Cloud’s body is extremely deficient in many areas. It’ll require plenty of adjustments and resources to fix,” said Meng Qi.

“How much?”

Meng Qi hesitated for a moment and then clenched her teeth. “At a rough estimate, using the best resources, it will probably require five billion points.”

Although they had long since been prepared, Long Chen and Tang Wan-er both jumped in shock.

“Wan-er, how many points do we have now?” asked Long Chen.

“A few days ago, sister Qing Yu said that we had four billion and eight hundred million points, because the majority of our points were already distributed to each individual. If we don’t have enough, we can ask them to pool their points again,” said Tang Wan-er.

Although they had obtained over ten billion points in that battle, the Dragonblood Legion had equipped themselves with the best weapons and were training in the best training rooms. They naturally burned their points quickly.

Ten billion points was a shocking amount, but when distributed, it wasn’t even a million points each. That wasn’t enough to even get a King item.

Guo Ran was also a big money spender. Although the material for his forging had been sent by Zheng Wenlong, just the process of forging things required all kinds of supplementary materials such as inscriptions or divine extracts.

“Long Chen, will this affect the entire Dragonblood Legion’s development?” asked Meng Qi worriedly.

“Foolish wife, Cloud is our companion and also a member of the Dragonblood Legion. Its power is the Dragonblood Legion’s power. Even if it’s just for the sake of our future, we need Cloud to grow up healthy. Don’t worry, although it’ll be a bit tight, I think with a bit of adjustment, it won’t affect our progress.” Long Chen smiled.

Meng Qi blushed upon being called wife and she glared at Long Chen. But that made her feel warm.

“How are we supposed to adjust?” asked Meng Qi.

“Right now, each member of the Dragonblood Legion has quite a few points. It should be enough for them in the short term, so we won’t need to give any more for a while. As for the points that we have, although it’s not enough, there are other options. Divide the required resources into things that have to be bought with points in the sect, and things that we can get on our own.

“For example, I can get you precious medicines, and we can get some of the Magical Beast flesh, crystal cores, and bones on our own. Our disciples can occasionally go out for tempering, which will benefit their cultivation bases, and we’ll profit. We can even issue missions to get those things, which should be cheaper. Furthermore, I’m still getting points from selling medicinal pills to the outer sect. So there’s no need to worry about it right now,” said Long Chen.

“Long Chen, you really are amazing!” Meng Qi and Tang Wan-er excitedly hugged Long Chen, one on the left and one on the right. They even gave him a kiss each. Just as Long Chen was enjoying the feeling, another mouth came over.

“Hey, you’re too late. Let me kiss you instead!” Cloud actually learned from Meng Qi and Tang Wan-er’s examples. Long Chen hastily went up to hug and kissed it instead. He was afraid of being accidentally swallowed into its stomach.

Tang Wan-er and Meng Qi laughed. Cloud was truly adorable. The two of them continued to play with it, while Long Chen walked toward a depressed Guo Ran who was sitting on a distant boulder.
