Chapter 2163 Corrupt God Ancient Tower

A black-robed figure appeared like a devil from hell. His face was originally handsome, but now it appeared frighteningly dark.

“Senior apprentice-brother Long Chen!”

Seeing that devil-like figure, countless disciples of the Xuantian Dao Sect cheered through their tears. With Long Chen present, the Xuantian Dao Sect could be saved.

Hua Shiyu, Mu Qingxuan, and the others also cheered. Long Chen’s arrival filled them with energy.

“Long... Long Chen!” Xie Luo’s hair stood on end. He shivered, a sudden chill overcoming him.

“You’re right, it’s time to finish things.” Long Chen’s voice was spat out from the cracks between his teeth. He slammed Xie Luo’s spear back at him, causing Xie Luo to cough up a mouthful of blood.

Xie Luo was shocked and horrified. He was no longer his old self. Since Tian Xiezi had come out, he could only serve as his attendant. Although later Tian Xiezi had given him some pointers, allowing his power to soar, he had lost so many times to Long Chen, and his heart was full of terror toward him.

Now that Long Chen appeared like a devil, Xie Luo didn’t even have the courage to fight. He directly turned tail and fled.

Xie Luo hadn’t gotten far when Long Chen threw a lightning spear at him like a shooting star. The spear pierced through his body, and the immense power behind it made his body explode. Just like that, Xie Luo was killed.

The spear continued after flying through him, flying until it struck one of the Corrupt path’s experts that was fighting Hua Shiyu. That expert hastily blocked, but his divine item exploded on contact with the spear, and his physical body was torn apart. Only his Yuan Spirit flew out, but it was quickly cut down by Hua Shiyu’s sword.

Long Chen was like a tempest, slaying the top experts of the Corrupt path present one by one with Evilmoon. Not one of them was able to block a single attack from Long Chen. In an instant, nineteen of the Corrupt path’s top experts were killed. It didn’t matter if it was an awakened Empyrean or an old Netherpassage monster, they were all killed in one blow.

The balance of the battlefield instantly shifted to their side. The Xuantian Dao Sect’s morale soared thanks to Long Chen’s arrival, and the disciples launched a fierce counterattack.

“Tian Xiezi, since you want to die so much, I’ll kill you right here!” Long Chen charged through the battlefield, going for Tian Xiezi. He howled furiously, crazy with rage. “Split the Heavens 8!”

Tian Xiezi snorted and smashed a fist at Evilmoon. A powerful explosion erupted, unleashing a wave of divine light.

Long Chen’s arm trembled. He suddenly realized that Tian Xiezi was wearing translucent gloves. Without looking closely, they were unnoticeable. Long Chen vaguely saw divine runes on them. An ancient and evil aura came from them.

Those gloves were Tian Xiezi’s priceless treasure, something left behind by the second generation Corrupt God.

The second generation Corrupt God had been a body cultivator. He hadn’t used any weapons. With just his hands, he could tear the heavens apart and had destroyed countless divine weapons.

The skin of his hands had been left behind when he had ascended, and Tian Xiezi had taken control of them. Ever since he had made this pair of gloves with them, he had never encountered anyone capable of blocking his fist.

However, Long Chen’s attack had caused his blood to flip within him. There was also a sharp pain coming from his hand. Now he knew just how terrifying Long Chen’s power was. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

Rumbling rang out. The Corrupt God Ancient Tower shuddered as at this moment, Li Tianxuan took the chance to counterattack with the Xuantian Tower.

Tian Xiezi’s expression changed. Due to the distraction, his control over the Corrupt God Ancient Tower had fallen. At this moment, Long Chen’s second attack arrived.

BOOM!

Tian Xiezi once more blocked Long Chen, and as a result, the Corrupt God Ancient Tower shuddered intensely and was blown back by the Xuantian Tower.

Tian Xiezi coughed up a mouthful of blood. He needed to block Long Chen’s attacks and control the Corrupt God Ancient Tower, but the distraction allowed the Xuantian Tower to injure him.

The Xuantian Tower was currently burning up karmic luck to unleash immense power. The two sides had been equally matched at first, but Long Chen’s arrival immediately put Tian Xiezi at a disadvantage.

Tian Xiezi was furious. If it weren’t for Long Chen, then he was confident he could destroy the Xuantian Dao Sect within another incense stick’s worth of time. Without the Xuantian Tower, he would also be confident in killing Long Chen. But in this state, he was stuck.

He glanced at the battlefield. Long Chen had killed nineteen of the Corrupt path’s top experts, instantly putting the Corrupt path’s side at a disadvantage. The disciples of the Xuantian Dao Sect were also fighting like madmen, wanting to kill their enemies even if they had to die themselves.

If this continued, even if they could still fight, it would be meaningless. There was no way the forces he had brought would be able to destroy the Xuantian Dao Sect within the next few minutes. After that, reinforcements from the Martial Heaven Alliance would arrive. By that time, they wouldn’t even have a chance to retreat.

“Count yourselves lucky this time.” Tian Xiezi suddenly vanished into the Corrupt God Ancient Tower. Pillars of light shot out of it, landing on the bodies of the Corrupt path’s experts.

Those experts vanished, sucked into the Corrupt God Ancient Tower. However, only just over ten thousand of them were taken in. Those were the elite disciples and powerful Empyreans.

As for the other disciples and old Netherpassage elders, they were abandoned.

“Long Chen, I’ll take your life next time.” Tian Xiezi’s voice rang out from within the Corrupt God Ancient Tower. The tower then tore through the void and vanished. Not even the Xuantian Tower could stop it.

“Kill these bastards from the Corrupt path! Avenge your fellow disciples!” Wang Zhen and the others went crazy, slaughtering the leftovers who were starting to flee.

“Kill!” The Xuantian Dao Sect’s disciples roared and crashed down on those experts.

“Long Chen, hurry and assist the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow race. They should be the true focus of this attack,” said Li Tianxuan.

Long Chen had come and saved them at this critical time, but that didn’t mean that things were over. If even the Xuantian Dao Sect had faced such a powerful attack, then the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow race was definitely in danger.

“The transportation formation has been broken, so I can only run over. Xuan Master, I’ll leave this place to you.” Long Chen found that the spatial energy in the surroundings had been thrown into chaos by the Corrupt God Ancient Tower. Summoning his lightning wings, Long Chen rushed off.

Once Long Chen left, Li Tianxuan immediately called back the disciples, not permitting them to chase the Corrupt experts. If they went any further and got scattered, there might be trouble. Who knew what backups their enemies had?

The Xuantian Tower returned to its original location, and the grand formation was immediately activated.

“I’ve gotten old and useless.” The patriarch sighed heavily as he saw the corpses of the Xuantian Dao Sect’s disciples littering the ground.

If he had not activated the Xuantian Tower for offense and sent it out to crush the bait that had been offered, then even Tian Xiezi with the Corrupt God Ancient Tower wouldn’t have been able to do anything to them for a while. If the Xuantian Tower had been united with the grand formation and focused entirely on defense, they would have been safe.

Even if their other formations were broken, the grand formation had the ability to send the Xuantian Dao Sect directly to the Spirit World. There definitely wouldn’t have been such casualties then.

Although Li Tianxuan had said that he might have done the same, the patriarch knew that this was just to comfort him. With Li Tianxuan’s intelligence, he definitely wouldn’t have so easily used the Xuantian Tower, so the patriarch felt immense guilt for the fallen disciples.

Li Tianxuan shook his head. “Master, don’t be so stubborn. There are many things that were already set in stone as soon as Long Chen joined the Xuantian Dao Sect. We are powerless to change things. The only one who can change things is Long Chen. Do you think that Tian Xiezi wouldn’t be able to do something if you didn’t send out the Xuantian Tower? Are you sure they didn’t have other ways of slipping in? Since Tian Xiezi came here, he definitely had more trump cards than just the Corrupt God Ancient Tower. Furthermore, there will always be more tribulations just like this. Due to Long Chen, we have thousands of times the number of elite disciples as we had before. This battle can be viewed as a battle to temper the survivors. It also washed out the weak. The competition on the martial path is just that cruel. Death only means that your own life wasn’t tough enough. When I first saw Long Chen, I knew that the Xuantian Dao Sect’s fate would be one with his and that things would not be calm. So whether it’s good or bad, it was my decision, not yours. I bet the Xuantian Dao Sect’s fate on Long Chen. If you blame yourself for this, it will only make me feel bad.”

“Fine, I can’t beat you in an argument. But you are the disciple I am most pleased with in this life. You are my pride. I support all your decisions.” The patriarch sighed and patted Li Tianxuan on the shoulder before leaving.

“Many thanks, master.”

Li Tianxuan took a deep breath. When there was a fork in the road, there was no way of telling which path was right until the very end.

Li Tianxuan looked in the direction where Long Chen had gone. He had a premonition that this time, Long Chen was going to change the very face of the Martial Heaven Continent. “Long Chen, I also support you. Do your best to display the brilliance of a Heaven-Defier.”
