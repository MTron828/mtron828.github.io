Chapter 1576 Qu Jianying’s Warning

Translator: BornToBe

Once Pill Valley’s people retreated, everyone was left dumbfounded. The Corrupt experts were especially pale. Pill Valley had actually abandoned them.

In the face of the terrifying head of the Martial Heaven Alliance, the Corrupt elder’s expression was unsightly. The two were mortal enemies. However, without the blood gourd, he couldn’t even run from her.

“People from the Corrupt path, listen well. Tell that old ghost Xie Wentian to grow a brain and not be used by others. If he wants to cooperate with others, then with his little bit of intelligence, even his bones will be swallowed by others without leaving the slightest trace. Take your people and scram!” shouted Qu Jianying.

The reason why Qu Jianying sat in the highest position of power in the Martial Heaven Alliance wasn’t just because of her martial power. It was also because of her intelligence.

She knew that Pill Valley was using the Corrupt path as a weapon. Although she had only just come out of seclusion, she had already figured out some of Pill Valley’s schemes.

First, the Pill Valley had used the ‘carrot and stick’ approach to try and control the Corrupt path. Thereafter, their hands stretched into the interior of the Martial Heaven Alliance, and it let them gain control of many sects.

The sects that refused to listen to them ended up attacked by the Corrupt path. Alone and without reinforcements, they were destroyed. The Corrupt path had been Pill Valley’s tool to draw more Righteous sects under their wing.

These particular Corrupt experts were wholly insignificant to Qu Jianying. The blood gourd had already been destroyed by Long Chen, so there wasn’t much difference between killing them and not killing them.

However, by releasing them, it was possible to send a warning to the Corrupt path. Although it might not stop the Corrupt path from working with Pill Valley, they wouldn’t end up becoming Pill Valley’s dogs in the future. That was her only goal. Even if she had to release these people, it was worth it in the long run.

The Corrupt experts had not expected Qu Jianying to let them off. They bowed slightly toward her before leaving.

Although Qu Jianying was their enemy, the Corrupt path did not conceal their worship for the strong. Even if it was an enemy, as long as it was a powerful enemy, they would be respected.

Once the Corrupt experts had left, Qu Jianying’s gaze swept across the ancient races. She smiled coldly. “I heard the ancient races have become quite arrogant during my seclusion. You’re complaining that your territory isn’t large enough and you want to expand? How about my Martial Heaven Alliance just gives you half our territory so that each member of the ancient races has their own mountain? How does that sound?”

During these past few years, the ancient races had been rapidly expanding their territory, not satisfied with what they had.

Some smaller sects had been driven away by them, while some stronger sects had disbanded thanks to Pill Valley’s coordination.

Only some tough sects who didn’t bend to the carrot or the stick had gone against the ancient races despite Pill Valley’s ‘mediation’. After all, no one wanted to leave their home.

As a result, those sects were suddenly attacked by the Corrupt path, while the reinforcements from other sects were ‘one step too late’ to help. Those sects were either destroyed or had their cores so badly damaged that they were forced to disband.

Now that Qu Jianying had brought this up, those ancient race experts’ expressions sank. Saying that they would each have a mountain was clearly mocking them for having few people but being extremely greedy.

However, even their powerful Life Star experts were intimidated by Qu Jianying and didn’t dare to even let out a fart.

“Don’t think that with the support of the Xuan Beasts and the favor of Pill Valley that you can do whatever you want. Pill Valley won’t help you unless it benefits them as well, and the Xuan Beasts have never publicly expressed any opinion of you. Don’t think you have so much support. Speaking of which, go tell the Xuan Beasts that Hu Xiaolin was slain by my disciple. If they want to find someone for revenge, they can find me,” said Qu Jianying.

Long Chen was startled. Hadn’t Qu Jianying just arrived? How did she seem to know about everything?

“You’re underestimating the Life and Death Dao. Netherpassage experts that have gone through the Nethergate can randomly examine other people’s souls. Only a few people can avoid her probing,” explained Li Tianxuan upon seeing his shock.

Long Chen’s heart shook. The Netherpassage realm was even more terrifying than he had imagined. So she was actually able to peer into other people’s memories without them even being aware. That was beyond his current comprehension.

At the start, Long Chen hadn’t felt that the valley master was so powerful. However, as he learned more and more about her level, Long Chen realized he had been too foolish. The Netherpassage realm wasn’t something that he could currently comprehend.

“Little fellows from the ancient family alliance, remember that you’re allied with the Righteous path. Don’t let others intentionally cause conflict amongst us. Of course, I’m not saying this because I’m afraid of you. I just want to make things clear. Cooperation should be sincere. If we can’t cooperate, then we can break up. It doesn’t matter. But the Martial Heaven Alliance’s cooperation with the ancient family alliance is based on both our interests. Although we’ve received your help, you’ve also obtained a generous return. Now that I, Qu Jianying, have come out of seclusion, the decisions of the Martial Heaven Alliance are decided by me. Go ask Di Long if he wants to end this cooperation or not.” After telling off the ancient races, Qu Jianying turned to the ancient family alliance.

“Yes, disciple will definitely transmit your words. However, Long Chen’s actions in the Spirit World, don’t you think they merit... an explanation?” An elder from the ancient family alliance walked out, neither arrogant nor subservient.

It seemed that he had a certain level of status in the ancient family alliance. He had some skill with words. Originally, he was going to say that Long Chen’s actions merited compensation, but he had changed it to an explanation at the last moment.

Curiously, Qu Jianying did not get angry. Instead, she amicably said, “There are many things that you don’t know. That means you haven’t been bought by Pill Valley. That’s why it’s best that you do not learn a few things. As for Long Chen’s actions in the Spirit World, he has his own reasons for those. If you want an explanation, then Long Chen, give them their explanation.”

Qu Jianying beckoned to Long Chen, startling him. He took out Evilmoon again, and the space behind him shook as he prepared to summon his divine ring again.

“Brat, I wasn’t telling you to fight! Explain the reasons for your actions.” Qu Jianying’s face instantly darkened. Long Chen was too battle-hungry.

“Oh, that kind of explanation!” said Long Chen apologetically. He had misunderstood her meaning. He had thought she wanted him to beat them. He hesitated. “Can I really?”

Qu Jianying looked into the distance as if she hadn’t heard him. When he looked at the old man, the old man went to greet the old patriarch. No one looked at him.

“What the fuck is this? They don’t want to tell the secrets, so they’re making me do it?” wondered Long Chen. This was clearly a trap. However, he could only leap into it.

The neutral camp’s people were looking at him with anticipation. This was the secret that they wanted to know the most right now. Even Zi Yan was looking at him. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

“This relates to ancient secrets. Since I didn’t participate in the ancient wars, what I’m about to say merely represents my single viewpoint. Whether or not you believe it is up to you.” Long Chen’s gaze swept over everyone. He gravely said, “The human race is greatly indebted to the Spirit World. The reason I protected the Spirit World was twofold. One was as thanks for a favor, while one was making up for the human race’s debt to them.”

An uproar exploded amongst the crowd. For countless years, the only stories of the Spirit World were that they were despicable traitors.

Now that they heard the exact opposite, many people were unable to accept this information.

“That’s impossible. Long Chen, you’re definitely making up nonsense!” roared an ancient race junior-generation expert who had survived the massacre.

Long Chen shrugged. “I already said it’s up to you if you want to believe me. Don’t ask me to bring out any proof, because such a thing is absolutely meaningless. I always act according to my heart, and I do whatever I want. I disdain lying and making up excuses for my actions. If you want to take revenge against me, then come. I will definitely accompany you to the end. But remember this: if you have an issue with me, come at me. If anyone dares to touch the people by my side, then they’ll have touched my reverse scale, which will anger me. When I get angry, even I don’t know what I’ll do, so it’d be best if you were more reserved.”

After Long Chen said this, killing intent ignited in his eyes once more. The flames of fury in his heart were once more set aflame.

Even Long Chen didn’t know why his temper had grown more berserk. He was easier to anger now. He didn’t know if it was caused by Evilmoon or not.

He had once tried to probe Evilmoon about this issue, but Evilmoon had immediately retorted angrily that he was like this from the start. It had nothing to do with the issue.

At this point, Long Chen had clearly killed so many people. He had killed the main instigators, and he couldn’t even keep count of how many heavenly geniuses he had slain.

However, whenever he thought of how his opponents had dared to target his parents and torture Cloud, his killing intent immediately surged, and he wanted to kill them all.

As soon as Long Chen’s killing intent was released, that disciple didn’t dare to make another sound. He felt himself be locked down by an air of death.

The experts around him vanished, leaving him to face Long Chen alone. Even that many experts together were unable to feel safe in front of him.

They sensed a terrifying pressure from Long Chen that was on the same level as the pressure from Netherpassage experts. It had felt like whether they would live or die was based on a single whim from Long Chen.

“I trust Long Chen. Don’t ask me why. Trust is trust!” A rank nine Celestial suddenly came out in support of Long Chen.

“I also trust him. I trust his character. He definitely wouldn’t lie.”

“I believed in Long Chen from the start. I never doubted him...”

Following one person taking the lead, more and more experts from the neutral camp came out in support of Long Chen.

The main reason why they had stood in the neutral camp was more or less because they had some feelings of worship toward Long Chen.

Otherwise, they’d have long since yielded to the pressure of their families or sects to join Pill Valley’s camp. They didn’t want to submit to Pill Valley, but they also didn’t dare to directly support Long Chen. Just choosing the neutral camp could barely count as silent support for Long Chen.

Now that Long Chen had explained the truth about the Spirit World, almost all the neutral camp’s experts chose to believe him.

That was because Long Chen was an extremely trustworthy person. He never lied. With other powerful figures of high status also supporting him, there was even less chance that he was lying.

“Can I ask if the Dragonblood Legion is still accepting new members?”

Suddenly, a person cried out nervously and excitedly. Countless disciples immediately went silent, holding their breaths with anticipation.
