Chapter 3745 New Discovery

A map of the three thousand worlds? Long Chen was delighted. That was precisely what he had needed the most.

“The territories of the powerful races, some blessed lands, treasure lands, taboo areas, danger zones, and other things are recorded on this map. However, our map isn’t that detailed. It should only be used as a reference. These locations are too far from us, and we are unable to personally confirm things. We also don’t know if these regions have changed since we last heard of them. In any case, don’t take the map to be perfect. Hopefully, it can help you a bit,” said the elder.

“This is already perfect. A map is truly important to me. Otherwise, I’d be flying around like a headless fly.” Long Chen smiled brightly.

At this time, the injured people were starting to be able to stand. They all bowed to Long Chen and thanked him for saving their lives.

The majority of these people were World Kings, the main force of the Luo tribe. Once they were fully recovered, they should have some ability to protect themselves.

Now, they were in a rush to get on their way. Originally, they had only rested here because they had no way to continue traveling. These people had no choice but to rest, or they would die.

“Wait a moment.”

Long Chen took out a pile of Heavenly Dao Fruits. There were hundreds of thousands of them. When they saw the fruits, these people of the Luo tribe were completely stunned.

It had to be known that these were practically divine fruits to them, something that could raise the density of their violet blood. It was a heaven-defying treasure.

Just the few thousand fruits that Long Chen had taken out before were enough to make them endlessly grateful. Now that Long Chen took out more, they felt like they were dreaming.

“Bring these fruits with you. If you are on the verge of a large battle, use them well. There are also some medicinal pills and talismans here. They can save your lives in a moment of crisis.”

Long Chen then took out talismans and pills. Since he couldn’t accompany them, he could only provide them with these things.

The Heavenly Dao Fruits he gave them were almost his full stock, but he didn’t mind. What he wanted now wasn’t regular Heavenly Dao Fruit but the Supreme fruit.

There would definitely be endless battles erupting in the three thousand worlds, so he would only get more Heavenly Dao Fruit. Hence, other than a few hundred Heaven tier Heavenly Dao Fruit, he gave all Earth, Spirit, and Mortal tier fruit to them.

He also told them which fruit was best. The best should be saved for the strongest ones with the purest bloodlines. That would let them ascend to another level.

The Luo tribe’s people didn’t even know how to express their gratitude. They thanked Long Chen repeatedly before leaving with their people.

Once they were gone, Long Chen secretly followed them for a while. Seeing that no one was following them, he relaxed.

Long Chen looked at the barren Heavenly Dao Tree. There was only a single fruit emitting a Supreme aura. Feeling startled, Long Chen looked for the bear paw that he had thrown in before.𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

As a result, he found that it was gone. He asked Lei Linger and found that after he had tossed it into the primal chaos space, it instantly corroded and vanished.

“Can it be that Supreme Bones cannot be absorbed by the primal chaos space? The Supreme qi is the bridge that connects the Heavenly Daos and the Human Dao. Once in the primal chaos space, it is isolated from the Heavenly Daos. Having lost its connection to its master, it simply rotted.” Long Chen nodded with comprehension.

“Too bad. Such a good Supreme Bone was wasted,” muttered Long Chen a bit regretfully.

However, thinking about it, it seemed that there really was no way to connect a bear paw to another person’s bones. Could someone really fight with a hand that was even bigger than their body?

Long Chen then plucked that Supreme fruit. When he saw a tiny bear paw mark on it, he was delighted.

“Could it be…?”

Long Chen instantly thought of a certain possibility. Would whoever consumed this fruit have their palm transform into a Supreme Bone?

If that was true, then the Heavenly Dao Tree was truly heaven-defying. If Long Chen had known this before, Guo Ran wouldn’t have had to suffer so much pain just to connect that arm to his body.

“No, the aura is wrong. Although it has the Supreme aura, it’s much weaker compared to when it was attached to a body. Furthermore, when Guo Ran attached his Supreme Bone, its power didn’t diminish in the slightest. Perhaps the method that Guo Ran used is better.”

Long Chen carefully sensed the Supreme fruit’s aura. Compared to the previous bear paw, its aura was about thirty percent weaker. A portion of the energy had vanished. He didn’t know if it was absorbed by the Heavenly Dao Tree or if its energy was lost in the conversion.

Long Chen looked at the Heavenly Dao Tree. He didn’t know, but he found that its aura had undergone some kind of silent transformation. And yet, he was unable to say what part was different.

Looking at the Supreme fruit in his hand, Long Chen shook his head. “Who cares? In the future, the Dragonblood Legion will definitely be a Supreme Legion! Just watch how we dominate the world!”

Long Chen put away the Supreme fruit and took out the map. He was on the edge of the scorched land area and saw that the center of this scorched land area was marked as taboo. The mark of the Sacred Pill Hall was on it.

In other words, that scorched land was well known to be taboo land owned by the Sacred Pill Hall. Others were not permitted to approach it.

Long Chen then looked at the surroundings on the map and couldn’t help laughing. In order to throw off any enemies on his back, he had undergone several random transportations, which ended up bringing him in an arc around the scorched land.

However, he supposed that this could be considered fortunate. It was only due to this that he had ended up running into the Luo tribe. The mark on the map indicated that this was a pile of ruins. There were several ruins here, and no lifeforms occupied them.

Looking even further, he found that the closest human settlement was close to a day’s travel away. He would also need to cross a large river marked with danger and a beast warning. This was most likely the territory of a beast race. If he wanted to cross it, it might be a bit difficult.

However, he was in a rush for time, so he couldn’t bother about that. He had to find a human settlement.

“It’s too bad. If I knew that transportation talismans are so useful, I’d have asked for some more.” Long Chen counted and found that he had fewer than a hundred transportation talismans left. He couldn’t help being vexed.

Before this, he had never really used talismans. But now, he understood just how convenient they were. With them, he had traveled so far without the slightest effort, and he was able to maintain his peak condition at all times, as well as being harder to notice.

Unfortunately, he wasn’t Xia Chen. Xia Chen was able to make more if he was out of stock. Because of this, Long Chen decided to leave these talismans for when he urgently needed them.

Long Chen transformed into a giant Lightning Falcon and flew toward the city.

Half a day later, Long Chen reached the riverside marked on the map and saw countless demonic beasts gathered there. After Long Chen’s gaze roved around them, he suddenly flew directly toward their direction.
