Chapter 4902: Violet Crystal Heavenly Eye

The middle-aged man was holding a violet crystal, which was his remaining eye.

“Friend, you must accept it,” said the middle-aged man, his figure starting to grow illusory as he had lost his final eye.

“Senior, your eye still has some power left in it. You can use that power to try to reincarnate! Even if it’s only a slight chance, it’s better than having no chance!” urged Long Chen.

Originally, this man had planned to drag down those eight corpses with him using his eye’s power. However, due to only helping Long Chen move the corpses, this eye still had some power left. He had condensed all of his energy into this eye and given it to Long Chen to thank him.

However, how could Long Chen accept it? Long Chen hoped the middle-aged man would use this final bit of energy to fight against the Heavenly Daos and reincarnate. Although the chances of success were low, without gambling, how could he know the final result?

“Thank you for thinking of me. However, this world no longer has anything binding me to it.”

“What about your wife and children?”

“They are no longer present. I used the Reincarnation Eye and didn’t find the slightest trace of their karma. They were killed long ago and couldn’t enter the cycle of reincarnation,” replied the middle-aged man.

“How can that be?! Who killed them?!” Long Chen clenched his teeth, his killing intent raging. He couldn’t accept this result.

“That isn’t important. What is important is that I wasn’t able to protect them, so let me pass away in peace.” The middle-aged man then looked at Long Chen apologetically and said, “After I used the Reincarnation Eye, the little bit of energy in my eye has been reduced to almost nothing. It is no longer able to help you fight your enemies. However, if you use your violet blood to nourish it, it will let you see many things you were unable to see. I’m very happy to leave it in your hands. Even though I’m already gone, my power will continue to influence the future of this world.”

The moment the middle-aged man pressed the violet eye into Long Chen’s hand, Long Chen’s heart shook. He realized that this senior of the Heavenly Eye race no longer had any desire to live, having no more family to protect. Long Chen couldn’t help but sigh sorrowfully.

A grand pre-Emperor expert was unable to protect his own wife and children. Just how sorrowful was that?

“Senior, do you have any final wishes?” asked Long Chen in a solemn tone. He swore to himself to accomplish whatever the middle-aged man said.

The middle-aged man smiled and shook his head. “When I used the Reincarnation Eye, I might not have seen my wife and children, but I did sense fluctuations of the Heavenly Eye race. The Heavenly Eye race’s bloodline has been passed down. I have no regrets. Friend, thank you for freeing me. Perhaps I was born in the wrong era. I dislike the competition of the martial path… the bloodshed and the killing. Many times, I wished to be a normal person, have a family, grow old, and pass away peacefully. I hope that one day, this eye of mine can see a peaceful world. That would be my final wish.”

Long Chen swore, “Don’t worry, as long as I am alive, I will one day flip this dirty world and rebuild its order. At that time, the heavens will be azure blue, and the water will be clear. People will definitely be happy.”

“I believe you can do it.”

The middle-aged man smiled and waved at Long Chen. Just as he did, he transformed into countless crystalline motes that slowly flew away in the wind.

Seeing this senior gone, Long Chen was unable to calm his heart for a long time. He had fought countless battles and met countless people. However, he rarely met someone like this middle-aged man. He simply wished to live a peaceful life with his family. It was an incredibly simple desire, but it was something even a pre-Emperor was unable to turn into reality.

Thinking of this, Long Chen wondered… just how difficult would it be for him to create a peaceful world with his women and hot-blooded brothers? In this troubled world, not even a pre-Emperor of the Heavenly Eye race could be safe. Hence, what could a little Divine Venerate like him do?

The more Long Chen thought about it, the more depressed he got. All of a sudden, he raised his head and let out a powerful roar. It was like surging thunder shaking heaven and earth, changing the very color of the sky.Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

This roar was filled with sadness, anger, killing intent, unwillingness, and other negative emotions, which then formed a destructive will that stretched out in every direction. The earth collapsed, and the grassland in the distance was destroyed. Long Chen resembled a devil king emerging from hell, his killing intent shaking the world.

No one knew how long it took for his roar to subside. However, the surrounding space still quivered, and the disrupted laws of heaven and earth struggled to heal.

After releasing this roar, Long Chen felt much lighter. If he didn’t release his pent-up anger, he might really go crazy.

Even a mighty pre-Emperor had met such a tragic fate. This filled Long Chen with anger, as well as sorrow and helplessness.

“Why is living the way you want so difficult?!” raged Long Chen.

“Do you remember a certain medicine called the Infinite Eight Bitters Root?” At this time, the Earth Cauldron’s voice rang out.

“To be born, to grow old, to get sick, to die, to part with loved ones, encountering what we hate, wanting something unattainable, and the five negative skandhas…” murmured Long Chen. He naturally remembered, but he shook his head. “I can accept the fact that all people are born, grow old, get sick, and die. That’s simply life. But why must loved ones be parted? Who started this? If a desire is so simple, why can’t it be attained? As for the five skandhas, so what? Greed, anger, love, desire, idiocy—as long as we don’t affect others, why can’t I do whatever I want? If I want to be an idiot, I can be an idiot. Just who made the endless suffering of this world? Who controls the workings of the ten thousand Daos? Just who is shrouding people’s hearts?”

Long Chen’s voice grew more and more impassioned as he spoke until it became a powerful roar. His barely calmed emotions boiled over once again.

“Not bad. You’ve grasped the important point so quickly,” said the Earth Cauldron with a hint of praise.

Long Chen was startled. “Are you saying that…?”

“The closer you get to the truth, the more careful you have to be. You should hurry up and increase your power!” answered the Earth Cauldron.

Long Chen instantly calmed down. For the Earth Cauldron to suddenly bring up the Infinite Eight Bitters Root, it was clearly trying to make a point. Were the eight bitternesses really under someone’s control?

Long Chen slowly lowered his head and looked at the violet crystal eye in his hand. He then raised it to his own eye.

Buzz.

The violet crystal eye quivered slightly. Following that, Long Chen saw a scene that made him cry out in shock.
