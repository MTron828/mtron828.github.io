Chapter 2912 Long Chen Erupts

Although Xiang Kejie was wrapped in flames and his spear was incredibly powerful, Long Chen just casually shoved the spear into Xiang Kejie’s body. As a result, the flames around his body vanished in an instant, revealing his bare body.

Everyone clearly saw the spear piercing through his chest. The next moment, Xiang Kejie looked down in disbelief.

Just before this, he had been forcing Long Chen to repeatedly dodge, clearly having the advantage. But now he was defeated in a single move. Hence, fear swarmed over his face.

“I admit-”

Just as he was about to admit defeat, the spear quivered, and he exploded before he could say the final word.

Within the formation, as long as you said the words ‘I admit defeat’, you would be sent out. This rule had been modified over the years, because some people had taken advantage of it, tricking opponents into saying words that included this phrase, resulting in them being transported out and losing what should have been a sure win for them. In order to patch this flaw, you would only be sent out if you said ‘I admit defeat’ with nothing before or after.

Xiang Kejie wished to admit defeat, but would Long Chen give him that chance? If Long Chen didn’t kill them all, how could he face those disciples that had died?

After killing Xiang Kejie, Long Chen didn’t wait for the others to recover from their shock. He swept the spear out. The dragon-shaped mark then lit up, and a dragon cry could faintly be heard.

The experts surrounding Long Chen were instantly devoured by flames. The Immortal Institute’s Gu Fei had just recovered some energy and came charging back, but he stopped in his tracks when he saw Long Chen slay Xiang Kejie. However, before he could run, the flames swept him up.

“AH!”

Gu Fei and the others screamed, trying to flee, but they could only see fire. On the other hand, the spectators saw some blurry figures moving toward the outer edge of the formation before they slowly faded.

That sight shocked the experts outside. It seemed that this spear possessed even greater power in Long Chen’s hands.

“Heavenly Flame, Scarlet Spirit Flame!”

Some flame cultivators shouted in shock as they recognized the flame Long Chen was using. Long Chen was actually capable of controlling a Heavenly Flame. Furthermore, it did not seem to be limited to the power of a Heavenly Flame seed.

During this time, Huo Long had been constantly absorbing the power of the companion ore, so its power now soared to a terrifying level.

Li Chengbei was appalled. Other than him, everyone else attacking Long Chen was killed, so he immediately ordered his divine bird to flee.

The divine bird then spread its wings and instantly appeared hundreds of meters away. Just as Li Chengbei thought that he had escaped this calamity, a flame spear shot out like a meteor, piercing through the divine bird and Li Chengbei who was on its back.

The immense power of the spear blasted apart the soul beast and Li Chengbei.

Directly after, the spear actually spun in the air and flew back into Long Chen’s hand as if he was its owner.

At this moment, Mu Qingyun and the others were shocked and delighted to see how powerful Long Chen was. He was practically unrivaled. He had killed over ten of the Prime Glory Alliance’s top experts in an instant.

Seeing this, the other disciples of the Prime Glory Alliance were terrified by Long Chen’s power. They had never seen such a terrifying enemy.

Long Chen then pointed his spear at Chu Kuang. “By using a bunch of ants to test my power, are you looking down on me?”

“Ants?

The disciples outside roared inside. If these people were ants, then what were they?

It had to be known that Gu Fei, Li Chengbei, Xiang Kejie, Devil Eye Yang Fang, Yuan Xinghui, and the others were all existences that the rest of the outer academy’s disciples could only look up to. In fact, they felt like they could spend a lifetime without being qualified to stand alongside these dead experts.

However, such amazing figures were called ants by Long Chen. How were the rest of them supposed to live now?

Chu Kuang nodded at Long Chen. “Not bad. It seems that you’ve progressed once more after our last encounter. You must be very confident, right? But I always like beating people who are very confident.”

Chu Kuang grabbed his clothes and suddenly tore them off. Underneath his disciple robes, he revealed a skintight body armor.

This body armor seemed to be made from golden silk and silver threads. Every single thread was covered in runes.

Inscribing runes required a powerful medium, or it wouldn’t be able to endure the power of the rune. For every thread to be able to have so many runes inscribed onto it signified that the material was incredibly precious.

The full body armor was made of thousands and thousands of threads. Then the value of this body armor had to be enough to suffocate others. Although they didn’t know what level of treasure it was, everyone knew it was definitely priceless.

“This bastard really has too much money,” cursed Luo Ning.

Although the Luo family’s wealth was not inferior to the Chu family’s, even the family’s top experts couldn’t occupy so much of the family’s resources alone.

However, Chu Kuang was different. It was rumored that he was from the main bloodline, and more precisely, the bloodline of the family head. Hence, with his immense talent, he had been picked out to be the future family head and raised with the full might of the Chu family. That was why his financial power was unimaginable.

Even though so many people had died, Chu Kuang still acted as if victory was in his grasp. He patted his armor. “Do you see? This is the Five Element Spirit Gathering Armor. It automatically absorbs the energy of the five elements in the surroundings for me, giving me an unending stream of power. Furthermore, this armor was specifically made for the Chu family’s main bloodline, so it also purifies and strengthens my bloodline. Let me tell you some bad news. With this Five Element Spirit Gathering Armor, even without advancing to the Divine Flame realm, I can already use the power of the Divine Flame realm. I can easily unleash my divine abilities.”

Long Chen shook his head. “Then let me tell you some bad news. You won’t get to see tomorrow’s sun because you’ve managed to infuriate me. Today, I will probably have to unleash my full power. Let me tell you, whenever I use my full power, even I get afraid.”

“Hahahaha!” Chu Kaung laughed disdainfully. “What a huge joke. You’re still bragging now? If you really had that ability, then back in the lava cave, when you, Luo Bing, and Luo Ning were surrounding me, wouldn’t you have unleashed your power to kill me? Why would you give up your only chance to kill me?”

Hearing this, everyone was startled. If all three of them had really surrounded Chu Kuang and he had still escaped unscathed, then Long Chen alone couldn’t possibly beat him, right?

Long Chen smiled. “You must be very curious about that. Why did I only dodge when you activated your ancestral bloodline last time? Fine, I’ll tell this secret to everyone. It’s because of this.”
