Chapter 4742 News of Long Zhantian

“He is unable to unleash his full power against you for two reasons. One is because of the nightmares he had as a child. That ghost entity you have on you causes him an innate fear. The other reason is because you are his father. He can’t use his full power on you for fear of injuring you or even killing you,” explained Long Chen solemnly.

“If Xiaole really hated you, he could have sealed his memories and then merged with Little Nine. After all, Little Nine didn’t know you back then. With the Violet Pupil Nine Tail Fox’s ferocity, it would immediately unleash its strongest killing techniques. Despite any bond Little Nine may have formed with us, its innate instincts prevent it from divulging its true trump cards. Even Xiaole may not be aware of them. Hence, Xiaole and Little Nine have always been the Dragonblood Legion’s hidden trump cards. Their true power remains a mystery.”

Hearing this, Bai Zhantang laughed proudly. Although he didn’t believe that Bai Xiaole could defeat him, the fact that Bai Xiaole hadn’t carried out the ultimate merger with Little Nine showed that he still cared about Bai Zhantang as a father. This realization brought him immense joy.

He could count as accomplishing the mission that his two wives had entrusted to him, so he instantly felt much more relaxed.

“Although I’ve never liked you, you do have some good qualities.” Bai Zhantang praised Long Chen for the first time, catching Long Chen off guard. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“I’m glad to hear it. If we’re done talking about the familial matter, we should talk about the official one. Can you tell me what’s going on in the Sovereign Emperor Heaven?” asked Long Chen.

Previously, Bai Zhantang had been too worried about Bai Shishi and Bai Xiaole, so there was no way he could talk about official matters. It was because Long Chen saw this that he comforted Bai Shishi first before finding Bai Zhantang.

Suddenly, Bai Zhantang grew serious and said, “In truth, the situation over there bodes ill. Apart from the severe erosion of our foundation, our territory has been overrun by countless devil creatures from beyond the heavens. While devil creatures are scattered in other areas, a powerful army consisting of dozens of races is guarding that particular area. As a result, our scouts were only able to venture as far as the outer edges.”

“If your scouts only reached the outer edges, how can you be certain that our foundation is severely corroded?” Long Chen inquired.

“Because we brought the academy’s karmic luck flame seed, and its reaction was extremely weak. According to the dean, those devil creatures likely possess a method to corrode our foundation.”

“But I thought devil creatures lacked intelligence? They shouldn't comprehend such matters,” Long Chen remarked.

“In theory, you are correct. That’s why the dean felt that something was wrong and did not permit us to launch a direct assault. He is afraid of a trap.”

“A trap?” Long Chen was startled. If there really was a trap, then just how long had the enemies been lying in wait?

“The dean warned that the worst-case scenario involves them summoning reinforcements to ambush us from behind during our attack, potentially leading to our complete annihilation,” Bai Zhantang explained.

“Have the enemies in the Sovereign Emperor Heaven detected our presence?" Long Chen inquired.

“The Sovereign Emperor Heaven might be enormous, but there are only a few places the human race can occupy. Not even the slightest breeze escapes their gaze. As a result, we are moving openly, while they are lying in wait in the dark, forcing us to act with reservation. We can only wait until everyone enters the Sovereign Emperor Heaven. The dean said...” Bai Zhantang suddenly paused here and eyed Long Chen before continuing, “He said that he wanted to hear your opinion.”

“My opinion?”

Long Chen was baffled but continued, “The situation is rather complex. Pull on one hair, and the whole body moves. The opportunity that the dean and the others are waiting for has probably not appeared yet.”

Bai Zhantang stared at him. “The dean said something similar. He said that the board isn’t clear yet, and it’s too dangerous to make any rash moves. He is waiting for something to change.”

“Then have they encountered any danger while setting up a temporary garrison?” asked Long Chen.

“Not really. However, a few factions came to pay their respects to us. The dean dealt with them, and he didn’t tell me what they talked about. However, based on their arrogant appearances, I feel like they came to probe us. One of them even intentionally caused trouble, so I punched him in the face. I was going to kill all of them, but Xiaole’s mother stopped me. After that, the dean refused to let me see any guests. A couple of days ago, a crack appeared in the chaotic sea of stars, and the starry sea heavenly path emerged. Seeing that I had nothing to do, they had me come back here,” replied Bai Zhantang irritably.

With Bai Zhantang’s explosive temper, he wasn’t suited to sitting still and waiting. He also didn’t like lying, so he directly spat out exactly what had happened, not even covering up the parts that didn’t show him in a good light.

“Speaking of which, I recall you have some relationship with the Heavenly Desolation Long clan, right?” asked Bai Zhantang suddenly.

“I suppose we do have a slight relationship.”

“The Heavenly Desolation Long clan has produced another major figure called Long Zhantian.”

Hearing that, Long Chen jumped up. “That’s my father’s name.”

Back then, Long Zhantian had stayed in the academy for a few days. However, he had not interacted with the others before he went on his own. As a result, Bai Zhantang had not met him, nor did he know his name.

Bai Zhantang was surprised to hear this and asked, “That person is your father?”

“It’s very likely. My father indeed went to the Sovereign Emperor Heaven. When he left—”

Bai Zhantang slapped his leg in realization. “I remember! The timing of your father's departure and the appearance of that fellow from the Long clan perfectly match.”

“I’m sorry, at that time, my father was...” Long Chen was a bit embarrassed. Back then, Long Chen hadn't introduced Long Zhantian to others partly because his father was still recovering and needed rest, and partly because of the trauma Long Zhantian had endured during his years of imprisonment. Long Chen knew firsthand the immense suffering his father had endured and feared that people would look at his father like he was crazy. Such scrutiny would only inflict more pain on his father.

Based on etiquette though, Long Zhantian and Bai Zhantang would be relatives by marriage in the future. So, for Long Zhantian to leave without saying goodbye to Bai Zhantang and his wives was definitely rude.

“I heard about what happened to your father. He is a real man, so don’t bother with those useless formalities.” Bai Zhantang waved his hand and rubbed his chin. “So you’re saying that this new major figure is your father?”

Long Chen nodded. He then told Bai Zhantang about how the Heavenly Desolation Long clan had sent people over as well. Apparently, his father truly was in the Long clan. When Bai Zhantang heard this, his eyes widened.

“Now I understand.”
