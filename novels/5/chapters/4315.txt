Chapter 4304 Enemies Gather

“Damn, there really are quite a few people here!”

Long Chen’s group of three snuck their way back to the Sage King Prefecture and found a gathering of many experts. Most of them were at the core of the battlefield, sitting with their eyes closed in meditation.

“It seems that they came for the leftover fighting will and broken laws from the battlefield.”

An immense battle had just been fought here, leaving twisted and chaotic places in some areas. The fighting will of experts lingered in the air, and remnants of some broken laws occasionally offered glimpses into the events of the past

Numerous cultivators were borrowing the leftover wills of experts from the battlefield to temper their own wills. It was as if they were actively engaging in that battle, but without any danger involved.

When the three of them arrived, countless experts cried out in shock, and many non-humans directly ran away. However, many of them stood their ground and just stared at Long Chen calmly, aware that with Long Chen’s status, he would disdain killing them. In any case, if he really did want to, they wouldn’t be able to get away anyway.ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

“Senior Long Chen!”

Some human experts greeted him with excitement, their eyes filled with admiration and reverence. In the previous battle, Long Chen had fought off the enemy races and swept through their geniuses, rekindling a radiance within the human race that had long since faded into history.

As a result, Long Chen’s reputation was now unrivaled within the human race, and no heavenly geniuses could stand on par with him. It wasn’t that they weren’t outstanding; rather, it was Long Chen who was too powerful. His sudden rise simply eclipsed the luster of countless geniuses.

After all, no matter how bright the star, it couldn’t compare to the bright moon. Thus, when Long Chen arrived, the human race’s experts were instantly excited.

Long Chen nodded to them, his gesture serving as a form of greeting. As for the other race’s experts, they immediately cleared a path for him.

As the three of them ventured deeper, they saw more and more experts from various hostile races. Strangely, despite their unfriendly relations with one another, they all appeared to mind their own business here. No one was fighting.

“Why are there so many new World Kings here? Could they not wait any longer to advance?” Guo Ran saw quite a few new World Kings with unsteady auras. From this, it was evident that they had not been able to control their realms and had just advanced.

“Not everyone can control their realms so well. I think some people with weaker foundations were stimulated by the influx of primal chaos qi and simply broke through. They couldn’t even suppress it,” said Long Chen.

The stronger the person, the greater their control over their realm. But regrettably, not many people could exercise such precise control.

Unfortunately, making their breakthroughs now was detrimental to them. It was because the primal chaos qi in this world was in the midst of rising, so each day of delay presented a slightly greater benefit.

Thus, every Immortal King was suppressing their realms, and the top experts were all planning on making their breakthroughs only once the primal chaos qi’s density stopped increasing.

Long Chen’s group of three delved further under the scrutiny of countless experts and reached the location where the Sage King martial stage had previously stood.

The martial stage was gone, and in its place lay an enormous gate from which primal chaos qi was crazily pouring out of the slight crack.

While the primal chaos qi right outside the gate was extremely dense, it was unsuitable for direct absorption. After all, it still possessed the concentrated power of laws, and if it was directly absorbed, it would be extremely harmful to the body. It could only be steadily absorbed once it had dispersed and was in a tranquil state. In its current form, the primal chaos qi could only be looked at.

“Scram! Anyone near the gate will be executed!” Just as Long Chen arrived and stirred up some commotion, a chilling command resonated from the vicinity of the gate.

“It’s the devil race. What are they doing?”

Guo Ran was startled. There was a group of the devil race’s experts around the gate, and they were blocking others from getting close.

“Reporting to senior Long Chen, the devil experts are communicating with the devil race on the other side of the gate. They seem to have a way to communicate with each other. It has been several days, and they’re not letting anyone else get close,” said someone from the human race.

“They’re communicating?” Long Chen exclaimed, clearly surprised by this revelation.

“Most likely. We can hear devil sounds coming from the crack even at a distance, and hundreds of thousands of the devil race’s Triple Supremes are listening intently nearby. Speaking of which, senior Long Chen, how many people did you bring this time?” asked that person.

“Just the three of us.”

“Three?” That person was shocked. “Senior Long Chen, you have to flee! The devil race has over ten half-step Eternals standing guard over this place! You have to run before they notice you!”

“Over ten half-step Eternals?”

Both Guo Ran and Xia Chen were shocked by the sudden turn of events. What in the world was the devil race planning?

At that very moment, the void ruptured, and a malevolent devil energy enshrouded the entire area, causing the human expert's face to contort. He was on the brink of fleeing when Guo Ran grabbed him.

“Don’t run. We’ve been locked down. If you leave, you’ll die,” said Guo Ran. A barrier of the Devil race slowly appeared in the air, sealing this space.

“Hahaha, there was a path to the heavens, but you didn’t take it. Instead, you dug a hole straight to hell. Long Chen, you really are brazen! Let’s see how you escape now!” Devil experts began to manifest in the skies one after another, emanating dread-inducing auras.

Sixteen half-step Eternal experts surrounded Long Chen and the others. One of them in particular glared at Long Chen darkly, his eyes full of icy killing intent.

“How laughable. Weren't you the one fleeing the last time we crossed paths?”

Long Chen sneered. Suddenly, he cocked his head toward that elder and pointed. “Hey, you look familiar. Do I know you?”

“Of course, you know me! You bastard, trash, scammer! Return my treasures!” That expert’s face twisted with fury.

It dawned on Long Chen that this was the very devil expert to whom he had auctioned the Heaven Earth Cauldron.

Back then, this elder had handed over fifty-eight Eternal corpses and seven Eternal divine weapons, three of which belonged to the human race. Yet, all he had received in return was a counterfeit.

During the Sage King Convention, he had been biding his time, eagerly awaiting an opportunity to exact revenge on Long Chen. However, that chance had never presented itself. Now, with Long Chen's return, his anger surged, prompting him to summon all the devil experts in the surroundings.

Without further ado, a devil sword radiating a bone-chilling light streaked toward Long Chen, enveloped in a burst of devil energy. The half-step Eternal expert was channeling his full power.

“It seems that you’re holding quite the grudge. How about I let you hit me once in return?”

Long Chen smiled and turned his head ever so slightly, allowing that sword to directly strike his shoulder.

BOOM!

A qi wave exploded, and countless experts stared at Long Chen in horror.

“How… how is that possible?!”
