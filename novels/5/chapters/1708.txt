Chapter 1703 There’s Piss, You Want It?

Translator: BornToBe

Guo Ran flew through the air, unleashing a constant rain of black water.

Even the Empyrean Winged Blood Devils were unable to do anything to the black rain. No matter what divine abilities they unleashed, no matter how they summoned winds to blow the water away, the rain would ignore their attacks and land on their bodies. Countless Empyrean Winged Blood Devils died, wailing without the slightest ability to resist.

Guo Ran felt like flowers were blooming inside his heart. His gratitude toward Long Chen came in an unending stream.

Long Chen had given him all the death spirit water he had brought out of the Netherworld. This kind of efficient killing was better than any other move.

This was a safe, fast, painless, high-end, imposing, and superior killing art. Long Chen had given Guo Ran the ability to show off like this. How could Guo Ran not be grateful? He almost shed tears of gratitude.

Guo Ran caused chaos amongst the Empyrean Winged Blood Devils wherever he went. They tried to dodge, but there was black rain everywhere. Nowhere was safe.

“Kill him! Once his defenses are broken, he won’t be able to handle the black water either!” From the other side of the gate came a roar.

The roar came from a group of Empyrean Winged Blood Devils, but their cultivation bases were too high to pass through the channel. They could only stand and watch.

No more Empyrean Winged Blood Devils were charging through the gate, as they all saw that they were unable to do anything to Guo Ran. The number of devils that went through would become the number of devils who died.

Nothing could be done. Their strongest fighter, the long-haired man, was completely entangled with Long Chen and couldn’t target Guo Ran.

However, the seniors of the Empyrean Winged Blood Devils had keen eyesight, and they saw a porcelain luster coming from Guo Ran’s body. That was what was protecting his armor.

Obviously, without that layer of protection, even Guo Ran wouldn’t be able to endure the black water. So right now, the main point was whether or not they could break that defense.

“Come at me! Let’s see if you can break it!” Guo Ran sneered at a mass of Empyrean Winged Blood Devils that charged at him regardless of the danger. He suddenly took out a cannon.

BOOM!

A water ball shot out of the cannon and exploded amongst the Empyrean Winged Blood Devils.

“AHH!” Hundreds of Empyrean Winged Blood Devils were devoured by the black water and instantly killed.

“Come, come!”

Another cannon appeared in Guo Ran’s other hand. He shot at some Empyrean Winged Blood Devils that were hiding in the distance.

Black water exploded in that area. There was nowhere to dodge or run. Anything in this region was within Guo Ran’s reach.

The current Guo Ran was like the reincarnation of a war god, slaughtering those Empyrean Winged Blood Devils until they were like chickens and dogs.

A portion of the Empyrean Winged Blood Devils were smart and tried to attack the Dao Sect’s disciples. Guo Ran wouldn’t dare to shoot in that direction.

However, as soon as they got close, Meng Qi would form a hand seal, and her manifestation would unleash a powerful spiritual attack. After that, the Empyrean Winged Blood Devils would feel a burst of pain in their souls, causing a brief bout of dizziness.

In that single moment, sharp wooden stakes and earthen spears would fly out of the ground, striking them with such power that their bodies exploded.

With Meng Qi, Chu Yao, Liu Ruyan, Li Qi, and Song Mingyuan joining hands, none of those Empyrean Winged Blood Devils could get close.

The Xuantian Dao Sect’s disciples cheered. Before this, Meng Qi and the others had already appeared so terrifying, but now these disciples saw that they had yet to reveal their true power.

Tens of thousands of Empyrean Winged Blood Devils were dead or dying. Adding on the sight of Meng Qi and the others using their full power for the first time, the disciples felt their blood blazing within them. The Dragonblood Legion was full of monsters. Each of them was so powerful that it sparked disbelief.

Guo Ran was unleashing a rain of black water that was annihilating countless Empyrean Winged Blood Devils, while Meng Qi and the others revealed a stunning combination attack. This showed the disciples what true experts were. They felt immense veneration and admiration toward each member of the Dragonblood Legion. Each of them was a real warrior.

“Haha, I, Guo Ran, will bring a stop to the wild ambitions of you evil creatures! Little ants, remember the name of Guo Ran! This godly name requires no title or nickname, yet it is like a blazing sun, an ear-splitting name that will resound through the ages! In front of me, Guo Ran, you can only crawl beneath my feet. Tremble before me, weep your tears- ah!”

Guo Ran was in the midst of unleashing his rain of black water, feeling like he was growing more and more badass. However, just as he was bragging wildly, his expression changed. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

The moment he tried to shoot his cannon again, it was no longer a water ball that flew out. Instead, it was a tiny little trickle that dribbled out. When he tried again, instead of a black water ball, the cannon exploded. That sound was similar to a fart.

Guo Ran’s bragging came to a sudden stop. The Dragonblood warriors and the Empyrean Winged Blood Devils all looked at him.

“What are you looking at? Do you think I’m out of stock? Hmph, I’m telling you that I have plenty more where that came from! Do you dare to come and test me?!” raged Guo Ran upon seeing the Empyrean Winged Blood Devils looking at him eagerly.

Guo Ran’s attempt at intimidation resulted in all the surviving Empyrean Winged Blood Devils on the battlefield charging at him. They didn’t fall for his bluff at all.

“Fuck, I’m telling you that I still have plenty left! You’ll regret it in a bit!” shouted Guo Ran severely.

“Die! Who do you think you’re trying to fool?!”

The Empyrean Winged Blood Devils slashed their bone swords at Guo Ran, and he hastily switched out armaments, summoning his strongest armor and switching to his golden sabers.

BOOM!

The first Empyrean Winged Blood Devil was sent flying by Guo Ran. With his golden armor, Guo Ran’s power was even greater than Gu Yang’s. If it weren’t for the fact that he couldn’t use his golden armor to unleash magical arts, his combat power would be even greater.

Seeing the first Empyrean Winged Blood Devil was sent flying, the others confirmed that Guo Ran was out of the black water. They surrounded him.

“Bastards, just wait a moment! I really do have plenty of stock left. If you scram now, it won’t be too late. Otherwise, don’t blame me for not warning you!” shouted Guo Ran.

“Do you think we’re idiots?!”

The Empyrean Winged Blood Devils roared angrily. They naturally wouldn’t believe such a lie. They attacked Guo Ran, not giving him a chance to breathe.

“Guo Ran, don’t panic. I’ll save you!” shouted Long Chen, forcing away the long-haired man and flying toward Guo Ran.

“Keep dreaming! Bloodlight Barrier!”

The long-haired man suddenly unleashed ten thousand runes from his wings. They connected, forming a giant net that blocked Long Chen.

Long Chen slashed his saber at it, but the net’s runes lit up and bent along with his attack. It was too flexible and tough for him to break.

“The Bloodlight Barrier is one of my Empyrean Winged Blood Devil race’s top divine abilities. Why don’t you see if you can destroy it?” laughed the long-haired man.

Long Chen repeatedly slashed his saber without being able to break it. He could only fall back. If he didn’t, the net would trap him.

“Guo Ran, don’t panic. Once I kill this fellow, I’ll come save you,” shouted Long Chen, once more attacking the long-haired man.

Since Long Chen was unable to help him, Guo Ran fell into desperate straits. Meng Qi and the others were about to go help when a horde of Empyrean Winged Blood Devils poured out of the spatial gate.

“Don’t worry about me. Defend!” shouted Guo Ran. He suddenly flew into the air. Unable to block so many Empyrean Winged Blood Devils, he switched to running.

“Idiot, the sky belongs to the Empyrean Winged Blood Devils race!”

The huge Empyrean Winged Blood Devil army chased after Guo Ran. After all, they hated him to the bone and wanted him dead now.

The senior Empyrean Winged Blood Devils on the other side of the gate were giving out orders, telling the ones capable of getting through the channel to charge and eliminate their enemies.

In less than an incense stick’s worth of time, the entire battlefield was filled with Empyrean Winged Blood Devils. They were on the ground, they were in the air, their numbers were simply incalculable. They unleashed berserk attacks.

“Hey, wait a moment and listen to me! We’re all civilized, so what’s the point of fighting? Why not sit down and amicably drink a few cups of tea?”

Guo Ran was like a golden shooting star as he pushed his speed to its peak, weaving back and forth through the Empyrean Winged Blood Devils. They were unable to catch him.

“The only thing we want to drink is your blood!”

“Using my boss’s words, there’s no blood, but there’s piss. Do you want it?” laughed Guo Ran.

“Die!”

Countless Empyrean Winged Blood Devils roared furiously. The majority of them were chasing Guo Ran, while another portion was fighting with the Dragonblood Legion. The pressure on that side was starting to grow too intense.

Meng Qi, Chu Yao, Tang Wan-er, Li Qi, Song Mingyuan, Gu Yang, Yue Zifeng, and the others were fighting all out. Other than Yue Zifeng, they had all summoned their manifestations. Liu Ruyan in particular was ferocious. In the body of an Undying Willow, her leaves were like celestial spears raining down on the Empyrean Winged Blood Devils.

This was the true battle. More and more Empyrean Winged Blood Devils appeared, crashing down on their defensive lines wave after wave.

“That’s about enough. Guo Ran, go ahead!” Long Chen’s originally panicked expression suddenly vanished.

The Empyrean Winged Blood Devils, as well as the old fellows on the other side of the gate, all stiffened.
