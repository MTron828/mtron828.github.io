Chapter 3945 Yu Qianxue

This woman sitting in front of him was not at all shorter than the men. Once she stood up, she would probably be rather tall. Her beauty possessed a natural allure, yet it was accompanied by an icy arrogance reflected in her high nose and thin lips. From Long Chen’s experience, this woman must be a thorny rose. He doubted that they would get along.

On her forehead was the mark of a six-petal plum blossom, which seemed to contain boundless flame energy. The moment their eyes locked, it felt like that flower was also looking at Long Chen. After that, the plum blossom’s flame energy swirled, as if it might lock onto Long Chen at any moment.

This woman was a terrifying expert, one of the ones that Long Chen sensed at the very start when he arrived. She gave him a sense of heavy pressure.

Long Chen didn’t know what she wanted, so he indifferently said, “Did you have any advice?”

The woman icily said, “No advice. I heard about you in the Jiuli immortal realm. I encountered a group of powerful wood cultivators inside and invited them to join me. But they said that they belonged to the Dragonblood Legion and couldn’t join any other power. They were only loyal to their boss. So, I asked them who their boss was, and they told me that it was Long Chen and even showed me an image of you to ask me if I knew you.”

Long Chen’s heart pounded hard. A group of powerful wood cultivators that belonged to the Dragonblood Legion? Was that not the healing warriors of the Dragonblood Legion?”

Long Chen hastily asked, “Where are they now?”

“They were hunted down by the Violet Thunderclap Empire’s Weng Tianhui in the Jiuli immortal realm. I saved them and forced Weng Tianhui away…”

“Then many thanks.” Long Chen immediately cupped his fists to her in gratitude.

“You don’t need to thank me. They were a group of eighteen people, and three of them were heavily injured by Weng Tianhui. I invited them to join the Vermilion Bird Empire, but they refused, so there was no need for me to use a secret art to heal them. From how I saw it, the three of them didn’t have much chance of survival,” said the woman emotionlessly.

Hearing that they were severely injured, Long Chen was enraged. He hadn’t expected the Violet Thunderclap Empire to be causing trouble in other places as well.

“You can say that I am contemptible. Whether it was Weng Tianhui or myself, we only cared about their precious wood attribute talent. Weng Tianhui was using force, while I was softer. But while the methods were different, our goals were no different.” The woman stared at Long Chen.

Long Chen shook his head. “No matter how you put it, you helped save my sisters. I will remember this favor. If I have a chance, I will repay you.”

Although this woman hadn’t healed them, Long Chen didn’t blame her. The healing warriors all had powerful self-recovery abilities. If they were so seriously injured, then for this woman to heal them would definitely come at a price.

In a secret realm, there were countless dangers and opportunities. If they refused to join her side, then this woman naturally had no responsibility to take such risks for them.

“To tell the truth, I really don’t like you. If it weren’t for you, I would have a group of powerful wood cultivators under my wing. That would strengthen my side and give me a trump card in the fight for supremacy. This failure is your fault.” The woman eyed Long Chen with a hint of anger.

“What kind of logic is that?” Long Chen was dumbfounded. Whose line of thought would end up like that? Wasn’t that completely unreasonable?

“This is my logic. Those wood cultivators were incredibly important to me. Something that I, Yu Qianxue, have set my sights on won’t be renounced so easily. So…”

“What do you want? You want to hit me?” Long Chen’s guard instantly went up when he saw this woman’s unfriendly expression.

“We will gamble on the martial stage. One fight to determine victory and defeat. If you lose, you and your Dragonblood Legion will fall under my camp,” said Yu Qianxue.

“Damn, what an appetite!”

Long Chen stared at her in disbelief. This beautiful and arrogant woman was quite greedy. He had so many brothers and sisters. If he lost, would they all have to listen to her in the future?

Long Chen shook his head. Although this woman was powerful, she was definitely crazy. The way she viewed things and her way of thinking was completely ridiculous. She was beautiful, but it was a pity that she was an idiot.

Long Chen was about to reply when the man who had given up his seat for Long Chen asked with great curiosity, “What about if you lose?”

“I won’t lose.”Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

Yu Qianxue spoke confidently with great decisiveness.

“You can’t say anything for sure. What if you do lose?” asked the man with a chortle.

Yu Qianxue coldly snorted. “If I lose, I’ll marry him and everything I have will be his.”

This reply stunned everyone present. That was crazy, wasn’t it? Was this a fight for marriage?

It had to be known that this icy beauty was a princess of the Vermilion Bird Empire. Just how grand was her status? How could this one sentence decide her marriage?

People then looked from Yu Qianxue to this handsome man in black robes, curiously guessing what background he had. Why had they never heard of such a person before?

Furthermore, from Yu Qianxue’s words, she had never seen Long Chen either. She had only ever heard of him, not having much understanding of him. Wasn’t it too crazy for her to gamble like this?

The other imperial disciples were shocked by Yu Qianxue’s words and stared at her in disbelief. It had to be known that based on their understanding of her, she was incredibly arrogant. Even other princes and princesses were usually ignored by her. Thus, they were dumbfounded that she would suddenly act like this today.

Were those eighteen wood cultivators really such amazing geniuses? Could they make princess Yu Qianxue not care about the face of the imperial family and gamble with Long Chen?

“You are a princess?” asked Long Chen.

“Yes. You are speaking to the genuine princess Qianxue of the Vermilion Bird Empire,” said the man beside Long Chen. He seemed excited just like a child and patted Long Chen’s shoulder with encouragement. “Hehe, brother, your chance has come. Gamble, and a small knife can become a battle-ax, a small spoon can become a giant wok!”

Only then did Long Chen come to realize that even the people in the third row must have extraordinary statuses. To dare say such a thing to a princess, perhaps they were all on the same level as princes and princesses.

“This is fair, no? You lose, and everything you have is mine. I lose, and everything I have is yours. Do you dare to fight?” Yu Qianxue looked at Long Chen.

As for Liao Yuhuang and the others on the stage, they were originally going to keep playing, but they stopped because of Yu Qianxue, seeming very interested in their gamble.

What kind of dramatic nonsense was this? Long Chen was speechless. He had come to marry a princess, yes, but it wasn’t this madwoman.

“Sorry, I’m not interested in this gamble. I feel like I shouldn’t be sitting here, so I won’t disturb you all any longer.” Long Chen rose to leave.

“Brother Long, please wait.”

Just then, the yellow-robed woman with the flute spoke.
