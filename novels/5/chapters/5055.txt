Chapter 5044 Violet Lightning Divine Phoenix

The Brahma Pill Valley... a name that resonated throughout the Sovereign Emperor Heaven. All cultivators, regardless of race, knew of it. It was the strongest human faction, occupying the best land and resources.

Although the Sovereign Emperor Heaven was incredibly vast, the majority of its land was not habitable. As a result, the space for cultivators to move around was not that large, and places with abundant spiritual qi were fiercely contested by major factions, for example, the Heavenly Desolation Domain. The Long clan had spent countless years in bloody combat to maintain control over it.

Furthermore, while the Heavenly Desolation Domain was large, it bordered the devil sea, and its environment was far from ideal. Still, countless factions wanted to occupy it.

However, amidst all this fighting for the limited habitable land, there were certain regions with shocking wealth, abundant spiritual qi, and countless resources that no one dared to even touch. These were the Eight Brahma Domains, vast territories under the command of Brahma Pill Valley. Every single one of them was several times larger than the Heavenly Desolation Domain.

Because of the existence of the Brahma Pill Valley, the Eight Brahma Domains were the places with the best living conditions for the human race within the Sovereign Emperor Heaven. They were also considered the core of the Sovereign Emperor Heaven.

Among the eight domains, two stood out as particularly special: the Brahma Domain and the Daynight Domain. These two domains were backed by the names of Divine Venerate Brahma and Divine Venerate Fallen Daynight respectively.

While the other six domains permitted the entrance of outsiders, the Brahma Domain and the Daynight Domain only allowed their most loyal followers to enter, not even their ordinary followers.

As for the Heavenly Flame Devil Domain, it was not one of the eight domains but an area in the Glacial Heaven Domain.

Long Chen asked around as he traveled. After learning where the Glacial Heaven Domain was, he immediately started flying in that direction.

Just how should I sneak in?

Ad

wondered Long Chen as he flew.

After all, Long Chen had just killed so many experts of the Brahma Pill Valley. Although the news of this might not reach them immediately, the Brahma Pill Valley was definitely aware of their deaths.

If he were to just swagger inside, the odds of him being recognized were extremely high. Furthermore, they might even be prepared for him. To counter this, Long Chen had told Qin Feng to disguise someone as him upon returning to the academy, creating the illusion that he had returned there. However, given the academy’s distance and the number of people Qin Feng was bringing, it was unlikely they would arrive that fast.

If, by the time Long Chen reached the Glacial Heaven Domain, the news from Qin Feng’s side hadn’t reached the Brahma Pill Valley, Long Chen’s strategy would be futile.

Long Chen sat in his flying boat, navigating through the air. Suddenly, the void rumbled, and a powerful current blew by him, causing his flying boat to tumble and almost crash into a mountain. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

Enraged, Long Chen looked up to see a battleship hundreds of times larger than his flying boat speeding past. Laughter echoed from the ship’s deck, clearly mocking Long Chen’s miserable appearance. Long Chen spotted a giant blue falcon on the battleship and sensed the Blood Qi of the demon race.

He realized they were probably going to the Glacial Heaven Domain, perhaps with the same goal: the Heavenly Flame Devil Domain.

I forgot. Considering how enormous the Brahma Pill Valley is, they must have followers from many races. This time, whatever happens in the Heavenly Flame Devil Domain might be really big. This thought immediately made him forget about those people.

But wait, the more people there are, the easier it’ll be to sneak in. What is there to worry about? Long Chen instantly felt much more at ease after thinking of that.

As Long Chen expected, more battleships and flying boats whistled past him, all going in the same direction. In comparison to those groups, Long Chen’s small flying boat looked incredibly insignificant.

Long Chen wasn’t flying too quickly and was continuously passed by others. In any case, he was in no rush; he wanted to assess the situation first to find the best way to sneak in.

“Mo Nian is probably on the move as well. I wonder how he’s going to sneak in?” wondered Long Chen aloud, feeling very curious.

But then, based on his understanding of Mo Nian, this was his specialty. He would easily slip in.

Taking out the shovel again, Long Chen re-examined it. Other than the inscription “The Killer: Daddy Mo” and an arrogant smiley face, there was nothing else. In other words, Mo Nian hadn’t anticipated this token falling into Long Chen’s hands; otherwise, he would have left behind a hidden message.

The shovel had likely been in the Brahma Pill Valley’s possession for a while. In other words, after they parted ways, Mo Nian had been quite diligent with his “archeology”.

Wise people always said that ten years wasn’t too late for revenge, but Mo Nian’s vengeance always came quickly. Thinking of Xing Wujiang’s death, Long Chen’s hatred flared. He was determined to settle his debts with the Brahma Pill Valley this time. Even if he couldn’t crush them, he’d at least make them pay the price.

More and more people shot past him. It seemed that the owners of the battleships and flying boats were intentionally showing off. They had their speed on max, creating the loudest spatial-tearing sounds as they flew. Each one left behind long marks in the void and loud echoes to announce their power.

“They’ve never been put in their place,” Long Chen sneered as they flew past him. A master like Xia Chen could easily set up a barrier around them if they wanted to, and with these people’s speed, they wouldn’t be able to react in time.

An impact of that level would even severely wound Heavenly Chosens and crush weaklings like them into flatbread.

It was a show of how little sense of danger these people had. In search of some stimulation, these people actively courted death in a flashy way.

In any case, the opening of the Heavenly Flame Devil Domain was a huge gathering of monstrous heavenly geniuses. Those deemed monstrous heavenly geniuses often possessed an arrogance that matched their power. In their minds, if they didn’t flaunt their abilities a bit, wouldn’t it be a waste of their talent?

Suddenly, a heaven-shaking bird cry pierced the air, and Long Chen felt the world darken as an enormous bird shot through the air, unleashing astral winds so intense that Long Chen’s flying boat tumbled through the air. He almost lost control of it.

“That’s...!”

Upon seeing that figure, Long Chen cried out in shock. “The Violet Lightning Divine Phoenix!”

The Violet Lightning Divine Phoenix was a species from the primal chaos era, its veins coursing with a primal chaos bloodline. It was an existence that existed only in legend, yet here it was before Long Chen.

As Long Chen gazed at the Violet Lightning Divine Phoenix, his flying boat suddenly quivered. An enormous figure hurtled toward him.

“Courting death!” Long Chen’s anger erupted.
