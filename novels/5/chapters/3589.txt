Chapter 3578

Long Chen’s slap was clean, and his movements were absolutely perfect. His speed didn’t seem fast, and yet it swung out so naturally in an easy flow.

This simple slap was something that the late stage World King deputy dean was unable to avoid. He simply stood there as Long Chen’s hand slapped him in the face, sending him flying back.

Everyone cried out in shock, and the people behind this deputy dean hastily helped him stabilize himself. Everyone was dumbfounded.

“The same familiar move, the same familiar flavor! Boss really is the boss. This move is just as amazing as back in the day.” Guo Ran was the first to cheer when Long Chen slapped the deputy dean’s face. He had a very pleased expression.

This slap was so refreshing to Guo Ran. He was like someone dying of thirst being given a big gulp of ice water. He felt all his grievances being released. If he had a chance, he also wanted to stamp on this old fellow a few times.

This old fellow was precisely the greatest backer of those three hero snakes. They often used his authority to pressure Guo Ran, making Guo Ran not dare to say anything.

It could be said that in the entire Heavenly Dragon Divine Armor College, the person that Guo Ran hated the most was this old fellow whose face needed a beating.

He had dreamed countless times of slapping his irritating face just like this, and now Long Chen had realized his dream.

After the deputy dean had been slapped in the face, people still didn’t dare to believe their eyes. At that moment, space seemed to freeze. Everyone was deathly silent.

“Little brute-!”

The deputy dean had blood flowing out of the corner of his mouth. After being supported up by others, he was absolutely enraged. In all his life, no one had ever treated him like this.

Pow!

As a result of his curse, a hand accompanied by a whistling wind once more slapped his face, this time slapping the other cheek.

BOOM!

Astral winds directly blew away the other elders with him this time. They tumbled back, all of them coughing up blood.

The Heavenly Dragon Divine Armor College’s experts weren’t powerful physically. Within the same realm, at most, they possessed half the power of the outside world’s experts or perhaps even less.

Their power stemmed from their battle armor. Without their battle armor on, these late stage World Kings were even weaker than mid stage World Kings of the outside world.

In other words, if Long Chen didn’t have mercy, his slap would directly end this old fellow’s life.

“Kill them!” The elder roared furiously. Half of his face already caved in and his head was hanging oddly. This slap had almost crushed his head. Feeling shocked and enraged, he directly summoned his battle armor.

The other elders summoned their battle armors as well. Once they had the support of their battle armors, their auras instantly grew several times. Killing intent filled the air.

Seeing this scene, Xie Qianqian was dumbfounded with fright. She had never expected Long Chen to be so tyrannical, even daring to beat the deputy dean. Seeing the deputy dean charging over so furiously, she actually had no idea what to do.

Theoretically, as a disciple of the college, she had to stand on their side. But to have her be enemies with Long Chen was impossible. Hence, she was dumbstruck.

“Those who want to die, come.” Long Chen snorted and slowly moved his hand to the Minghong Saber on his back. His sharp killing intent began to slowly rise.

He came to save Xie Qianqian, but then he found Guo Ran. After knowing that Guo Ran had suffered so much here, Long Chen’s anger also flared.

He understood Guo Ran far too well. He was a typical silly but nice person. He liked to stand out, but he definitely didn’t like to offend people. It was the opposite; he was actually someone very easy to get along with.

Just from Guo Ran’s sobbing appearance just now, Long Chen knew how deep his grievances were here.

As for these unreasonable people, they were actually still fighting amongst themselves with their deaths almost at hand from the devil beasts. Upon thinking of this, Long Chen’s anger almost went out of control. He would vent for Guo Ran. If they didn’t recognize kindness, he wouldn’t hesitate to send them on their way.

The deputy dean completely ignored Long Chen’s warning and shot straight toward him. Long Chen’s hand tightened around the Minghong Saber.

“Stop!”

Just then, a voice rang out. It wasn’t loud and actually very gentle. But other than Long Chen, everyone else was dumbstruck. The deputy dean and the others instantly froze.

“It’s the dean,” Guo Ran whispered to Long Chen. At the very least, he had respect for this dean.

After that, the void shuddered slightly, and an elder appeared in front of everyone, one who appeared refined and scholarly. As a result, everyone hastily bowed. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

“Greetings, dean!”

The elder had an amicable smile on his face. It appeared as if he would never get angry, and he gave off a very comfortable feeling.

The elder waved his hand to indicate that there was no need to bow. After that, he looked at Long Chen.

“May I ask if you are the High Firmament Academy’s great dean?”

When the elder said this, everyone, including Guo Ran, was shocked. Although they didn’t have much understanding of the High Firmament Academy, the name of the nine heavens and ten lands’ oldest academy was known to all.

“This little one is merely the dean of the seventh branch academy. I cannot accept being called the great dean of the High Firmament Academy.” Long Chen cupped his fists slightly.

“Even the dean of a branch academy is an illustrious position. It’s not something that our Heavenly Dragon Divine Armor College can compare to. I am Xue Yifan. Please forgive me for failing to immediately greet you when you arrived.” This dean directly told Long Chen his name and bowed to him using the etiquette of two people of the same seniority.

This surprised Long Chen. He hadn’t expected the dean to be quite amiable. He didn’t put on airs, but then why were all the disciples beneath him so arrogant? It was incomprehensible.

Long Chen returned the bow. “Dean is too courteous. I heard that the Alldevil Star-Field was in crisis, so I wanted to help an old friend leave…”

Only then did Xie Qianqian realize that Long Chen had come here to save her. He hadn’t even known that Guo Ran was here as well. Hence, she couldn’t help being moved.

Long Chen continued, “However, I didn’t expect one of my brothers to be here as well. As a result, I thickened my face and came to your home to pay respects. But I didn’t think that the Heavenly Dragon Divine Armor College was so powerful! Even with powerful enemies surrounding them, they aren’t nervous at all! It seems that fighting amongst yourselves is truly joyful. My worries were for nothing. If the human race has such a strong will to fight, then a little Alldevil race isn’t worth worrying about. Thus, I hope I can leave with my brother and friend. In any case, you’re already so powerful that I’m sure you won’t miss a few people.”

Only a fool would not understand Long Chen’s sarcasm. The Alldevil Star-Field was already in crisis, and they were still so bored that they fought amongst themselves?

“You killed our people! Why should we let you leave?! A declined academy that has long since fallen into third-rank powers doesn’t give you any qualifications to be arrogant! Today, you won’t be bringing anyone away. As for yourself, you won’t be leaving either!” shouted one elder furiously.

“Old thing, shut your mouth. Who do you think you are to be qualified to talk to my boss? I’ve endured a long time already, and if you keep yapping, I’ll directly kill you!” shouted Guo Ran, pointing and cursing at that elder.

“You…!”

“That’s enough, this matter ends here. Dean Long Chen, if you don’t mind, why not come sit for a while in my college?” invited Xue Yifan.

Long Chen couldn’t help asking, “Is there a need for such a thing?”

“But of course.” Xue Yifan smiled. That smile contained a certain wisdom that was difficult to describe. It made him seem unfathomable, and even Long Chen’s curiosity was piqued.

“Then I am afraid I have to disturb you.”

Long Chen didn’t decline in the end. He also wanted to see just what medicine was in this old dean’s gourd. With Guo Ran and the others, he entered the Heavenly Dragon Divine Armor College.
