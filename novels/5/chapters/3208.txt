Chapter 3197 Sowing a Seed

Long Chen was startled. That was the voice of the dragon expert.

“Senior…!”

“Plant a seed in the spring, reap the harvest in the autumn.” The voice rang out once more before its presence disappeared.

After that, no matter how Long Chen called out, no response came back. Long Chen had many questions about how the others were doing, but those questions were left unanswered.

Long Chen felt his blood soul energy being drawn by that energy. It was like a little thief. However, as long as he wished to, he could resist.

Ultimately, he chose to listen to the dragon expert and act as if he hadn’t sensed anything. Fortunately, it didn’t extract much of his blood soul energy. It just left him with a wave of weakness and dizziness.

He could feel that blood soul energy being wrapped up by some mysterious energy and sent far, far away. It then vanished from his senses. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

In a dark place that Long Chen couldn’t see, there was a giant blood sea containing endless energy.

Another drop of light appeared and entered the blood sea. That was Long Chen’s blood soul energy.

His blood soul energy entered the blood sea. After that, an invisible energy slowly merged into the blood sea, silently leaving its own strange mark. That mark belonged to Long Chen…

Long Chen was already exhausted from his fight against the seven swords. Hence, when his blood soul energy was extracted, his vision turned dark, and he finally couldn’t endure any longer. He then fell unconscious, falling from the sky.

A pair of gentle arms caught Long Chen. Looking at the bloody and exhausted Long Chen. For some reason, Bai Shishi felt some indistinct stinging pain in her heart.

She now knew where Long Chen’s strength came from. His path was rugged, bumpy, and covered in thorns. Behind his power lay an unknown amount of blood, sweat, and tears.

Compared to Long Chen, she felt like she had paid very little. She had put in effort of course, but compared to Long Chen, it couldn’t amount to anything. It made her feel ashamed.

Suddenly, she turned red. She realized that she was holding Long Chen, and it was inappropriate. She hastily handed him off to the Pill Institute’s head.

“I truly didn’t expect that such a terrifying heavenly tribulation would exist in this world. The experts from outside the domain plus the assassins of the Heavenly Swell Domain’s Bloodkill Hall were all slain. Even Enpuda was powerless,” sighed an institute head.

The Bloodkill Hall’s presence was gone from this domain, and even Enpuda’s divine statue was shattered. His faith energy had been exhausted by the tribulation, so the statue was unable to remain intact.

With the statue destroyed, his inheritance in the Heavenly Swell Domain had been pulled out by the roots. The efforts of tens of thousands of years were destroyed by a single heavenly tribulation. If Enpuda wanted to spread his Bloodkill Hall here again, he had no choice but to start over.

Without the faith energy of this divine statue, he could no longer manifest himself in the Heavenly Swell Domain. It could be said that he had suffered a huge defeat this time.

“However, it’s unknown if the Bloodkill Hall will once more come back and launch an attack on the High Firmament Academy,” said Bai Xiaole’s mother.

This time, Long Chen had destroyed Enpuda’s inheritance in the Heavenly Swell Domain. This enmity was even greater than killing Gui Yun, so there was no way Enpuda would simply accept this.

“If he dares to come to us, can we not just strike back? I’ll directly bring people outside the Heavenly Swell Domain and slaughter the Bloodkill Hall’s branches. If I can’t beat Enpuda, I can at least kill his followers with no problem,” snorted Bai Zhantang.

“No need to worry. This time, Enpuda was simply testing the High Firmament Academy, and it was most likely incited by Lord Brahma. Moreover, it isn’t convenient for our academy to reveal too much of our power due to certain factors. Fortunately, Long Chen has resolved things here. Lord Brahma is very cautious. He never does anything he isn’t assured of, so he won’t make any rash moves before figuring out our bottom line. He is someone with immense restraint. Having endured for so many years, he won’t let his emotions get the best of him now. Anyway, there’s no need for everyone to be worrying so much for nothing. Let’s return.” The dean ordered everyone to go back to the academy.

They looked back at the devastation one last time and then at the unconscious Long Chen. They finally left.

A while after they were all gone, figures appeared in the distance, flying over. When they saw the wreckage of the Bloodkill Hall as well as the remnant destructive energy in the air, they didn’t even dare to get close.

The smell of blood still hung in the air. That was enough to tell them that countless people had died. Those corpses were all from some supreme experts.

These experts were drawn over by the disturbance. Unfortunately, they had come too late to witness anything.

However, the wreckage alone was unbelievable for them. The Bloodkill Hall was destroyed just like this? Even after gathering so many experts, they were unable to escape their fates of being wiped out.

The experts didn’t dare to stay here for too long. After a brief look, they returned to the sects to report the news. Hence, this information rapidly spread.

The High Firmament Academy didn’t bother concealing the matter of Long Chen undergoing his tribulation. On this very day, hundreds of sects in the Heavenly Swell Domain disbanded.

Long Chen had said that the day he ascended to the Four Peak realm would be the day that his retaliation started. Any sects that had attacked him at the end of the Nine Prefecture Convention would either have to disband or have him visit their door.

Many sects had been waiting to see how the wind blew. When the Bloodkill Hall had sent out the call for them to join forces against their common enemy, they had grouped up to launch a sneak attack against the High Firmament Academy.

Now, most of their peak experts had been killed by Long Chen’s heavenly tribulation, so the survivors instantly panicked. Some of these sects had lost their leaders, and their people began to kill each other to fight over the sects’ treasures.

All the sects that had participated in the attacks against the High Firmament Academy disbanded. Some sects even attacked them at this time, stealing their resources, mines, and spirit fields. They took advantage of this time to expand their territory.

However, it was dangerous to expand like this. Who knew if the Bloodkill Hall would return and attack them? But when profit was lying right in front of them, it was difficult for these people to retain their rationality.

The chaos lasted half a month, and hundreds of sects collapsed. Some of them hadn’t attacked the High Firmament Academy, but as they had a history of grievance with the academy, they disbanded as well.

Perhaps they were just afraid of the worst-case scenario. Long Chen had terrified them. Wanting to live, they didn’t have any wild thoughts of anything else.

After this chaos, no one in the Heavenly Swell Domain dared to mention restoring the name of the domain to the Dao Dawn Domain. All eyes within the Heavenly Swell Domain were on the High Firmament Academy. They all wanted to see what their next move was, or perhaps it should be said what Long Chen wanted to do next.

On this day, Long Chen finally woke up after sleeping for half a month. As soon as he opened his eyes, sharp pain wracked his left eye and blood poured out of it. He hastily shut his eyes.

“Child, you have guts. You actually sealed such a terrifying thing in your eye.”

Bai Xiaole’s mother was standing in front of him. She shook her head and sighed.
