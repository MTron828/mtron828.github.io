Chapter 4175 I’ll Take Charge

Just as Long Chen expected, the Soaring Dragon Company had occupied one of the ruins in the Sage King Convention and constructed a giant auction hall on it.

In order to attend this auction, not only did you need to buy a ticket, but you also had to deposit a certain amount of money with the Soaring Dragon Company. If you deposited enough money, you could even save on the ticket price.

However, the money that you deposited could not be withdrawn except through buying the wares of the Soaring Dragon Company.

For an ordinary person to get a ticket, especially for the rogue cultivators with no sect backing them, not only did they need to buy a ticket, but they also had to pay a down payment for the Soaring Dragon Company’s goods.

To put it frankly, they were binding these people to their business. When Long Chen arrived, he saw quite a lot of people cursing the Soaring Dragon Company for being immoral.

That was because when they bought the tickets, the Soaring Dragon Company didn’t mention anything about the deposit. As for a refund for the tickets, the Soaring Dragon Company said that the place to do refunds was in the Darklight Heaven. If they wanted a refund, fine, they could go to the Darklight Heaven.

This enraged countless people. How was this doing business? This was clearly robbing them. It was vicious and greedy.T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

Who would run all the way to the Darklight Heaven just to get a refund? The price to cross heavens was far greater. This was clearly a con.

However, these people had no background, so they could only accept defeat and curse in order to express this dissatisfaction. But they knew that they couldn’t beat the Soaring Dragon Company.

Furthermore, there were so many people here. How did they dare to cause too big of a fuss? Who knew whether the Soaring Dragon Company would simply make them disappear?

Just before this, the loudest complainers among the crowd had their heads silently severed. However, people didn’t even see what the killers looked like.

Even so, they knew that it had to be the Shadow race’s assassins, as only they possessed such terrifying methods.

Many people left furiously after that, but others could only clench their teeth and pay the additional entry fee to get in.

Hearing those curses, Long Chen couldn’t help scoffing at the Soaring Dragon Company’s methods. This was why he gave them the straightforward label of “unscrupulous businessmen”.

“And how exactly are you any better than us? We’re holding the auction, and you have the audacity to demand a commission fee from us! Why don’t you look in the mirror before judging others? If we didn’t charge this much, how could we pay your fee? Even if the Heaven Earth Cauldron does fetch an exorbitant price, we still have to part with ten percent of it to you. Furthermore, the Soaring Dragon Company has poured millions into hosting this event. Given that, who's to say whether we'll end up in the red after you've taken your cut? What right do you have to mock us?” sneered the elder from the Soaring Dragon Company after hearing Long Chen’s insult.

In fact, this elder was particularly enraged. When had they ever been forced to hold such an auction? There was no precedent, as it was practically bullying.

“I didn’t expect that you knew how to talk so well. Not bad. You’re right, we’re birds of the same flock. We shouldn’t despise each other.” Long Chen nodded.

“Hmph.” The elder snorted and said, “At least you know that you’re not clean either.”

“However, if you don’t have the ability, don’t try to force it. If you try to do it anyway, don’t start crying later on. Who are you showing that ugly face of yours to? Are you hoping for me to make it up for you?” said Long Chen lightly.

“You…!”

“What you? I’m now the VIP of your Soaring Dragon Company. Without me, this auction will be a failure. If I back out, how will you appease everyone’s fury? It would be strange if these people didn’t tear you apart. So, if you’re angry, you better endure it. If you have a fart, you better hold it in. Even if I slap you, you have to take it. The reason I don’t is only because I don’t want to dirty my hands. You should start seeing things more clearly from now on,” said Long Chen calmly.

The elder quivered with rage, but he didn’t dare to retort. Just as Long Chen said, if he were to slap this elder, he wouldn’t dare to retaliate. The elder would only be able to clench his teeth and endure it.

Seeing Long Chen chide an innate Heaven Venerate like chiding a dog, Mu Qingyun, Zhong Ling, Zhong Xiu, and the others almost laughed. After being apart for so long, Long Chen’s domineering nature had not changed at all.

Even in the Nirvana Overflow Heaven, amid the gathering of heavenly geniuses in the Sage King Convention, Long Chen was still the most domineering person. No one could compete with his light.

The sensation was both familiar and comforting to them; being in Long Chen's presence always stirred something within them.

Long Chen and the others had their own exclusive passageway, granting them direct access to the inner area. Of course, no one dared to demand tickets from them or cause any trouble.

Here, Long Chen saw that this place was bigger than it appeared on the outside. There was easily a space of a million miles here.

At the center was a giant platform, the auction stage, and there were extravagant private rooms set up around it. Naturally, those were prepared for people with the highest status and wealth.

Outside those private rooms were some booths, split into three levels: high, middle, and low. The high-level booths had beautiful attendants looking after them.

The middle-level booths also had attendants to pour tea for them, but it wasn’t a one-on-one service, more like a person handling many booths. As for the low-level booths, other than having a bit more space, there was nothing special there.

Behind them were just lines of chairs. The further back you went, the more packed they were. Clearly, those people were only here to watch the show. The Soaring Dragon Company was planning on selling high-end items for this auction, and people on this level wouldn’t be able to purchase those.

To put it frankly, the people in this region simply had their money taken by the Soaring Dragon Company, and afterward, they had nothing of value for the Soaring Dragon Company to squeeze out of anymore.

Those with true power wouldn’t sit with people like them. The rich would pay a high price for the booths and private rooms.

By the time Long Chen arrived, the auction had already started. But before the items actually appeared, there were displays of singing and dancing and other events to warm up the room. After all, it would be too abrupt to instantly jump into auctioning things.

Countless gazes instantly turned toward Long Chen when he walked in, causing him to become the focal point.

After that, countless waves of divine sense reached out from the experts in the private rooms, wantonly scanning Long Chen.

“Boss!”

Just then, Xia Chen and Guo Ran walked in from another passageway. They actually arrived at this moment.

Seeing them, Long Chen was instantly put at ease. Guo Ran then gave him a signal that everything was handled.

Since everything was handled, Long Chen couldn’t be bothered wasting more time. He directly walked over to the stage where the dancers were performing.

“Long Chen, your private room is over there!” The elder hastily got in his way.

“I’m here to auction my item, so why would I go into a room? Once the auction is done, I still have other things to deal with.” Long Chen pushed the elder aside.

Hearing this, the elder was shocked and enraged. “Are you joking?! The auction is going to last for seven days, and your Heaven Earth Cauldron is the ultimate final item! Here, you have to obey the rules!”

Pow!

Long Chen suddenly slapped the elder in the face. Seeing this scene, the dancers let out startled cries and dodged as the elder came tumbling past them.

That innate Heaven Venerate tumbled across the stage and fell to the other side.

As a result, the dancing and music came to a halt. Everything became silent.

Long Chen then walked to the center of the stage, his gaze sweeping over everyone.

“I am Long Chen. Today, let me take charge of this auction.”
