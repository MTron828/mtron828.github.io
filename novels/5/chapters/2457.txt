Chapter 2447 Sea Demons Block the Way

Translator: BornToBe

“This time, I’ll have to trouble you,” said Long Chen to the Moon and Star Refining Furnace. “I want to refine the Nethergate Pills and hopefully ones on the level of giant pills.

“I’ve been waiting,” responded the Moon and Star Refining Furnace. Its voice was ancient and steady like an elder that had experienced the totality of life.

“Big brother Long Chen, why can’t I refine them?” asked Ling-er dejectedly.

“Not all pills can be refined into demon pills. The Nethergate Pill isn’t suited for it, or I wouldn’t forget about you,” comforted Long Chen.

While Ling-er was quite childish and competitive, the Moon and Star Refining Furnace was unflustered. Even though Long Chen had been using the Demon Moon Furnace this entire time to refine pills, allowing it to recover quickly, the Moon and Star Refining Furnace had not said anything or expressed any displeasure, despite refining pills being the only way for it to recover.

Ling-er pouted and returned to the primal chaos space. Long Chen shook his head.

“Evilmoon, I’m pressed for time, so you fly us over. I have to get accustomed to the laws of this place,” said Long Chen. Refining a giant pill was much more complicated and required absorbing the laws of heaven and earth, or the chances of failure would skyrocket.

The Moon and Star Refining Furnace already knew the method to refine the Nethergate Pill. Huo Linger was also clear on it and didn’t need any instruction.

The only thing to do was to let the Moon and Star Refining Furnace get used to the outside world’s laws and for Huo Linger to get used to her new power.

Long Chen held onto the Moon and Star Refining Furnace as they sped through the air. Its runes lit up, absorbing the energy of heaven and earth. Huo Linger returned to the primal chaos space to condense her new power.

After transforming, Huo Linger’s body now had some runes that she didn’t understand. She had to get used to her new power.

The current Huo Linger was many times stronger than the old Huo Long. However, while powerful flame energy was simple to use in battle, it was different when it came to refining pills.

After two hours, the Moon and Star Refining Furnace returned to the primal chaos space and began to refine pills. Long Chen left a stream of energy open between the primal chaos space and the outside world so that the outside world’s energy could be absorbed.

The Moon and Star Refining Furnace and Huo Linger slowly started to refine pills, but just as Long Chen had anticipated, Huo Linger’s new flame energy was too powerful for her to control. There were several failures, resulting in Huo Linger starting to feel agitated. However, the Moon and Star Refining Furnace was extremely steady, teaching her how to control her flame energy bit by bit. It was very patient.

Long Chen nodded. This matter could not be rushed. With the Moon and Star Refining Furnace guiding Huo Linger, it shouldn’t be too long until she got used to things. After comforting her a bit, he was about to focus on the outside world again when Ling-er ran over to cause trouble, saying that since Huo Linger couldn’t refine the Nethergate Pill, it was better that she helped her refine pills. With a glare from Long Chen, she fell silent.

The Moon and Star Refining Furnace had said that even if the refinement was a failure, the experience from the process was beneficial. This girl Ling-er clearly didn’t understand such things.

Long Chen left refining the Nethergate Pill up to them. After six hours, he reached another group of the Dragonblood warriors. However, they weren’t leading the people from the Martial Heaven Alliance, but the Xuan Beasts.

“Boss!” Long Chen’s arrival delighted the Dragonblood warriors. They were already in the midst of joining forces with another group. That group had sent out a signal for them to come over.

“Let’s talk on the way.” Running into the Xuan Beasts was a happy surprise. This group had both the Dragonblood warriors and the non-flying Xuan Beasts on the back of the flying Xuan Beasts. They were extremely fast.

They said that they hadn’t encountered any dangers. They did fly over some kind of race’s territory once and were attacked, but they had simply run off without taking any casualties.

There had been some powerful beasts as well, but due to their numbers, those beasts only roared angrily when they passed by and didn’t attack. Those beasts didn’t seem to have anything valuable in their territory, so there was no point in attacking them either.

This group had received the distress signal and had been moving over there only for Long Chen to send word that things were over, so they had chosen to link up with another group of Dragonblood warriors.

That group had also sent out a request for assistance, but that wasn’t an urgent distress call. It was just a call for reinforcements, most likely indicating that they had found something good but felt that they didn’t have the power to obtain it on their own.

Long Chen nodded. After splitting into so many groups, some of them had to encounter something good. But it was unknown what they had encountered.

As they flew through the air, Long Chen continued to investigate the situation of the other groups. He found that other than these two groups that were in the midst of linking up together, the others had at least managed to join forces into groups of two. The biggest group now had seven squads.

That relieved Long Chen. Once they joined forces, the danger levels dropped. In truth, Long Chen had also been somewhat worried about splitting the Dragonblood Legion, as it would be dangerous if they encountered experts on the level of Tian Xiezi or Di Feng.

The Xuan beasts were extremely fast. They almost arrived at their target in just over an hour. Long Chen also saw several other groups approaching that area.

Suddenly, dinging sounds rang out. Long Chen and the other squad leader’s compasses were ringing.

“Not good! The request for reinforcements has become a distress signal!”

That meant that they had been attacked. Long Chen immediately summoned his lightning wings, speeding off on his own.

Long Chen quickly saw a group of countless giant figures. His gaze turned cold.

“The sea demon race.”

The sea demon race mostly didn’t like to transform into human form. They liked to keep their giant bodies and look down on others. Many of them would put on a half-human and half-demon form.

Long Chen saw hundreds of thousands of sea demons attacking the group of the Martial Heaven Alliance’s disciples. Their leader was precisely the young king of the Six Horn Sea Serpent race that Long Chen had previously defeated.

His aura had grown much more powerful during this time. He was more muscular, and his six horns were shining with divine light. It was like he had a halo.

He coldly smiled as he watched the sea demons attack the Dragonblood warriors and the Martial Heaven Alliance’s disciples. “Right now, you have two options. Either scram, or die.”

“Why waste words with them? Let’s directly kill them,” said another expert behind him. He had scale armor draped over him and a whip in his hand.

“Exactly. Have you forgotten what Long Chen did to our sea demon race? As long as we kill them all and make sure there are no witnesses, no one will know that we did this. Even if people suspect, so what? The Ye family has said that as long as there’s no proof, no one can touch us. This is our best opportunity for revenge,” said another sea demon expert. This one had a metallic luster to his entire body.

“Kill them all!”

The sea demons roared together, killing intent raging in their eyes. There were at least three hundred thousand of them. They were entirely capable of crushing the disciples of the Martial Heaven Alliance.

The sea demon race had always been warlike and had never had a good relationship with the creatures of the land. Long Chen in particular had humiliated them twice, and this opportunity to vent was rare.

Seeing so many of them roaring together, the Martial Heaven Alliance’s disciples were infuriated. They had no choice but to put everything on the line at this moment. There was no chance of them getting out with their own power.

Amongst them, the squad leader of the Dragonblood warriors sneered, “You really have forgotten your lesson. You were forced to flee like a dog during the qi flow eruption, and then later my boss went to the Martial Heaven Sea-Ring and made you beg for forgiveness. You think you can bully us because you have numbers now? I guarantee that if you dare to touch us, even if we all die here, my boss will turn the Martial Heaven Sea-Ring into a sea of death.” Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“You’re trying to scare us? Long Chen has offended so many people. He’s like a rat being hunted down. He could die at any time. Let’s not hesitate any longer and kill them right now. They are insulting us like this,” sneered the armored sea demon expert.

The young king of the Six Horn Sea Serpent was still hesitating though. However, he then smiled cruelly. “Do you really think that Long Chen is a god and that we don’t dare to kill you? I’ll send you to hell for now, but don’t worry, because I’ll quickly send Long Chen along as well.” He waved his hand. “Kill them all!”

The sea demons roared and charged forward like a furious tide.

“Die!” The armored sea demon expert smiled and charged toward the Dragonblood warriors.

When he unleashed a punch, his aura shocked the Dragonblood warriors. He was actually another peak expert that they had never seen before.

BOOM!

In the very first exchange, the ground beneath the Dragonblood warriors crumbled, and in unison, they coughed up a mouthful of blood.

“Idiots, not even your boss is necessarily a match for me. As for you? You think you can block me? Die!” The armored sea demon sneered, once more unleashing a punch. This time, an image of a giant scorpion appeared behind him.

The Dragonblood warriors’ armor lit up as they joined forces again to block this attack. Before the punch landed though, a sneer rang out.

“A little crab dares to run rampant in front of me, Long Chen?”
