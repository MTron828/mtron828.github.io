Chapter 4087 Shadow Assassins

Yu Qingxuan jumped in shock, not knowing what had just happened. Just as she was about to ask whether Long Chen was seeing things, her expression suddenly changed when she noticed the tree’s shadow moving on its own.

The tree’s shadow swayed, and with a rustling sound, a black figure shot up the tree.

When a gust of wind pierced the tree, an abrupt explosion-like noise rang out, drawing the attention of the Huayun Trading Company’s people. Following that, the sound of an alarm rang out and multiple grand formations activated.

Long Chen arrived at the bottom of the tree, looking at it. This tree was so large that it would take several people to wrap their arms around its trunk. From its surface, droplets of blood fell steadily.

Long Chen then rubbed the blood between his fingers and sniffed it.

“This aura is dark, and the blood is cold. Hmm, the fluctuations are strange…” Long Chen solemnly examined the blood on his fingers. Even as he spoke, the blood grew lighter and lighter, its red color slowly fading until it was like pure water. In the end, that water also evaporated as if it had never existed.

“What kind of lifeform is that?”

Yu Qingxuan walked over as well, stunned. She actually hadn’t sensed it at all. How frightening.

“It should be an assassin from the Shadow race.”

“Mister Long Chen!”

At this moment, the guild master also rushed over and examined the scene gravely.

“The evil spirit race’s shadow spirit race?” asked Long Chen, his expression changing.

“Yes. The Shadow race specializes in assassination arts. Their natural talent allows them to freely switch between bodies of shadows and bodies of flesh and blood. Due to this, they can kill people and then vanish without a trace. Fortunately, mister Long Chen could see through their camouflage, or it would have been dangerous.”

In terms of actual power, the Shadow race wasn’t very strong. But their camouflage and assassination arts could not be guarded against. As a result, even Heaven Venerates might be killed by an Immortal King from the Shadow race.

“I didn’t really manage to see through their camouflage. I sensed it when they tried to get close to me. But then, I couldn’t lock down their position. It was when they moved into the shadows that Qingxuan’s hairpin reflected light and exposed their position,” said Long Chen.

At first, Long Chen had only sensed that someone was present but had been unable to tell their exact location. At that time, he was quite shaken, as he knew that he had encountered a master of disguise.

Originally, he had thought that the other side was hidden within the void. But no matter how he tried, he was unable to sense any spatial fluctuations. It was when Yu Qingxuan turned her head that the sunlight reflected off of her hairpin.

That light flashed by the tree’s shadow, only to mysteriously vanish, so Long Chen almost instinctively attacked.

Long Chen’s reaction speed was quite fast, but the enemy still managed to escape, not exposing their appearance at all.Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

“We have no enmity with the Shadow race, so why would they target us?” asked Yu Qingxuan.

“The Soaring Dragon Company must have asked them to. After all, the Shadow race has a close relationship with the Soaring Dragon Company. Some problems that the Soaring Dragon Company finds inconvenient to settle will be handled by the Shadow race. Sometimes, when a power offends the Soaring Dragon Company, their leaders will be assassinated by the Shadow race not too long after that. Their relationship is no secret in the Nirvana Overflow Heaven. The Shadow race are assassins that the Soaring Dragon Company hires to wipe away any blockades stopping their growth. For now, I will increase the defenses around here. You should stay here for some time,” said the guild master.

Long Chen smiled and said, “Guild master, you don’t need to bother with it too much. I have experience dealing with assassins. So, if the Soaring Dragon Company wishes to play, I’ll accompany them.”

The guild master wanted to convince him, but Long Chen simply brought Yu Qingxuan away into seclusion. Seeing him go into seclusion, the guild master sighed with relief.

He thought that Long Chen had said some tough words for face, but in reality, he was still keeping his distance from the Shadow race.

“Long Chen, you don’t need to face them directly. Instead, you should take this time to increase your cultivation base,” advised Yu Qingxuan. She knew Long Chen’s temper, so she didn’t want him to spend so much energy on dealing with the Shadow race.

Long Chen said, “The main thing is that my cultivation path is different from everyone else’s. It just so happens that I have nothing else to do at this time, and I was even thinking about how I could deal with them. After all, you can dodge them temporarily but not forever. I’ll have to face them sooner or later. Don’t worry, I won’t do anything I’m not confident about. You can focus on your alchemy in peace. Once I’ve settled down enough, I’ll make some minor adjustments.”

Since Long Chen had said this, Yu Qingxuan didn’t pester him and entered her own alchemy room.

As for Long Chen, he entered a cultivation room. Once the formation was activated, he asked, “Senior, I’ve waited a long time. It’s about enough, right? If I keep waiting, I feel like I’m going to rust.”

“You really lack patience. Fine, the Dragon Soul Body Forging Art’s foundation has been ninety-nine percent complete. If you start merging with the laws of the Nirvana Overflow Heaven at this time, it won’t affect the foundation. You can start,” said the dragon expert, feeling a bit helpless.

Based on its plan, Long Chen should keep resting for about a month to see how the Dragon Soul Body Forging Art settled.

It had to be known that Long Chen’s Dragon Soul Body Forging Art was in its most foundational stage. It was also the most important stage, so there couldn’t be the slightest flaw.

As soon as there was a flaw in the foundation, there was no fixing it without tearing the whole thing down, which meant that Long Chen’s future with the Dragon Soul Body Forging Art would be limited.

Although Long Chen’s display had surpassed the dragon expert’s expectations, in order to be safe, it was best to keep waiting a while longer on the off chance that there were some adjustments that needed to be done.

However, Long Chen was also unable to settle himself without cultivating after all this time. Even his emotions grew a bit unstable. If he were to wait another month while doing nothing, he might go crazy.

In the end, the dragon expert belonged to the dragon race and possessed an unimaginable lifespan. A month? That was nothing to it. But the human race’s nature was frantic.

Although the dragon expert had never fully experienced what it meant to be human, it did understand Long Chen’s character. Perhaps if it told Long Chen to keep waiting, he would rebel, so it helplessly agreed.

With the dragon expert’s approval, Long Chen smiled and began to form hand seals.

The next moment, a seven-colored divine ring appeared. With the support of many formations, Heavenly Dao energy was sucked inside of the divine ring, and the laws of the Nirvana Overflow Heaven flowed into Long Chen’s body.

Long Chen absorbed it all, not rejecting anything. The spiritual qi of heaven and earth poured into his body. As a result, his sealed cultivation base finally loosened.

“Hehe, it’s time to exercise my fists in the Nirvana Overflow Heaven. Boss Long San is about to rise once more!”
