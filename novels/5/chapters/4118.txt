Chapter 4107 Dark Gate

Tribulation clouds gathered and thundered, their lightning locking onto the medicinal pills in Yu Qingxuan’s pill furnace.

When the lid opened, a brilliant golden light shot into the sky, and lightning struck in response. However, a giant lightning dragon devoured this lightning, preventing it from reaching the pill furnace.

“Golden pill… Starry Radiance Moon Divine Pills that have reached the golden pill level…” Seeing this scene, the Fullmoon race’s leader was shaken, his voice quivering. Even some of the senior members of the race had wet eyes.

Perhaps the junior generation didn’t quite understand anything about medicinal pills. After all, they normally only had spirit pills available, so they didn’t know what kind of difference would occur if they were to consume golden pills.

“Three top grade golden pills, the rest being top grade treasure pills. Their quality is outstanding, surpassing my normal refinement. The Silver Moon World really is a treasure land for refining pills,” said Yu Qingxuan with a delighted smile.

When refining pills here, there was abundant spiritual qi and the complete Heavenly Daos. As a result, she was like a fish in water when it came to refining pills here.

“Race leader, please check them.” Long Chen took the pills from Yu Qingxuan’s hands and offered them to the race leader.

The race leader reverently accepted the pills with both hands. Sensing the energy inside them, he quivered. The medicinal energy fluctuations were millions of times greater than the normal medicinal pills that they had.

The other experts of the Fullmoon race passed the pills around. Sensing their energy, none of them could conceal their excitement.

“Long Chen, if you can provide a large supply of Starry Radiance Moon Divine Pills, my Fullmoon race will be your most faithful ally. As long as it is not against the ancestral teachings, my Fullmoon race will do anything for you,” promised the race leader seriously.

He had no choice but to be serious. The Fullmoon race had been jammed for countless years due to a lack of medicinal pills and declined from their glorious peak. Now that he saw hope to reclaim that peak, he had to grasp this chance.

“Race leader, refining pills is nothing for us. In the future, just leave the Fullmoon race’s supply of medicinal pills to me,” said Long Chen.

In truth, Long Chen was also overjoyed inside. With the support of the Fullmoon race, he truly had found a foothold in the Nirvana Overflow Heaven.

“Race leader this, race leader that, it sounds so estranged. My name is Xu Jianxiong. You can just call me Uncle Xiong. Starting today, we are one family. Your matters are the matters of the entire Fullmoon race.” Xu Jianxiong patted his chest.

“Many thanks, Uncle Xiong.” Long Chen cupped his fists.

Seeing Long Chen accept this, Xu Jianxiong laughed heartily. “Hahaha, since we’re family, there’s no need for thanks. That would make us seem like strangers.”

As the race leader, Xu Jianxiong was naturally a level higher than others at judging people. Although he still didn’t understand Long Chen completely, just two days of observation let him know about Long Chen’s general character.

Long Chen was extremely prideful and cared deeply about promises, so he would not owe favors easily. It might not be easy to become friends with such a person, but once you did, you would be lifelong comrades with them.

Long Chen’s impression of the Fullmoon race wasn’t bad either. Most importantly, if Lord Brahma was trying to infiltrate them, it showed that they definitely weren’t on his side, making them very reliable and trustworthy.

The Fullmoon race celebrated over the matter of the pills. With a steady supply of medicinal pills, the Fullmoon race would be able to rapidly rise.

“Uncle Xiong, this matter must be kept an absolute secret…” said Long Chen.

“Don’t worry, I have transmitted this matter to the ancestral spirit totem! No one inside the Fullmoon race will be able to speak of this secret. Not even a soulsearch will be able to discover it,” guaranteed Uncle Xiong.

Long Chen was startled. It seemed that other powers also had similar methods to protect their secrets. No wonder he often got nothing with his soulsearches.

“Long Chen, I heard that you don’t want one of the three worlds that we fought for, so here is the area that our Fullmoon race has control over. Why don’t you see where you would like to start your own world?” Uncle Xiong directly took out a map. Now, he was even more impatient than Long Chen.

He hoped for Long Chen to be able to peacefully stay in the Fullmoon race and refine pills for them. After all, the Fullmoon race was in urgent need of many medicinal pills.

The sooner the supply of medicinal pills started, the sooner their people could consume them and start growing. They were in a race against time, and this related to the very future of the Fullmoon race.

Long Chen saw a black river running through the map. This was the map of the life-forbidden area, and the Fullmoon race only occupied one part of it.

To use the Fullmoon race’s words, they were defending this area in order to fulfill their promise. Thus, this area had special marks on them. Only they were in control of this region.

This region had over a hundred silver moon marks throughout it. However, only three of those marks were bright. In other words, those were the three worlds that they controlled. The rest were uncharted territories.

“Uncle Xiong, this moon is bigger than the others. Is it a special location?” asked Long Chen, pointing at one moon mark.

When Long Chen pointed at that one, Uncle Xiong and the others’ expressions changed slightly. “Don’t think about that place. That world is where my Fullmoon race’s ancestors sacrificed their lives in order to seal it. If the seal is broken, the dark world gate will open, and it won’t just be the Fullmoon race that is instantly destroyed. Perhaps all the nine heavens and ten lands will be doomed as well.”

“What? Is it that serious?” Long Chen couldn’t help gasping.

“Legend has it that the great primal chaos battle was fought precisely because someone opened the dark gate. That half crippled the nine heavens and ten lands. Now, the Heavenly Daos are incomplete, and the ten thousand races have declined. If the dark gate is opened again, without the power we had in the primal chaos era, we will be instantly wiped out,” said Xu Jianxiong gravely.

“Does the Fullmoon race defend the life-forbidden area precisely to guard this sealed world?” asked Long Chen.

“Yes.”

“Then is Lord Brahma not worried about you being pressed too far and directly launching a suicidal blow by opening this gate, dragging everyone down with you?” asked Long Chen.

“He is not afraid of that. He knows that our Fullmoon race will carry out our promise even in death,” sighed Xu Jianxiong angrily and helplessly.Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

Long Chen wished to ask just what exactly was the promise, but that was very likely a secret of the Fullmoon race. It was better not to ask. However, for the Fullmoon race to guard this place generation after generation for one promise was admirable.

Long Chen’s gaze swept over the map, looking at all the moon marks. All of a sudden, his eyes suddenly brightened and he pointed.

“What about this place?”

Xu Jianxiong and the others had strange expressions when they saw where he was pointing. Xu Jianxiong sighed.

“You should pick somewhere else. Even if I gather the entire race’s power, we can’t take that spot.”
