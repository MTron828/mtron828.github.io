Chapter 2367 I Want Bull Balls

Translator: BornToBe

“Courting death!”

Those Titan Blood Bull demons roared furiously. A few of them wanted to fight, but the one that seemed to be their leader shouted, “The human race is crafty! Don’t get into the range of their arrow towers. If we stay here, he won’t necessarily dare to come over.”

However, he had barely said this before Evilmoon stabbed into the sky. A giant saber-image slashed toward them.

BOOM! Over ten of them blocked together, resulting in them being blown back miserably.

“What power!” Shen Chengfeng had been keeping an eye the entire time and was startled. Long Chen only had his divine ring out. His battle armor had yet to make an appearance.

Despite that, he was able to force back over ten of the Titan Blood Bull demons, each of whom had extremely powerful physical bodies. Having fought with them for so many years, the Heavenly Dragon warriors were well aware that competing with them in power was suicide.

Seeing Long Chen really did dare to come into their territory, those demonic beasts roared. They actually surrounded him, trapping him in their midst.

“Foolish little human, you won’t be able to escape even if you grow wings. Don’t even think about drawing us into the range of the arrow towers. Now that you’ve used yourself as bait, don’t think about escaping alive, hahaha- AH!” One of the demonic beasts was in the midst of laughing when he suddenly let out a shriek.

Long Chen was holding a round leathery object bigger than a house. It looked similar to a giant coconut.

“Damn, what big balls.” In that moment of carelessness, Long Chen had suddenly struck, cutting off that demon’s balls.

Only now that he was holding one did he realize just how powerful the essence blood inside it was. It was like raging lava. It was definitely the correct aura based on his Pill Sovereign memories.

Now he finally believed that their bezoar wasn’t part of their digestive tract. The world really was full of marvels.

The demon that Long Chen had struck fell from the sky and wailed on the ground, constantly rolling about and holding the wound. Cutting off their balls was apparently so painful that it made them lose their ability to fight.

“Blood Bull Press!”

Suddenly, their leader gave an order that caused all of the Titan Blood Bull demons to join forces. Their Blood Qi erupted, forming a giant sphere compressing on Long Chen.

Long Chen’s hair suddenly stood on end. The pressure was causing space to crumble and collapse. This unified attack contained all their power and was definitely enough to crush him.

He immediately formed hand seals, and golden light appeared behind him. Seventy-two sharp golden dragon teeth appeared, shooting out at seventy-two different targets.

Ever since obtaining the golden dragon teeth, he had rarely used them. Although they were incredibly sharp, they were easily damaged against powerful divine items. Once broken, they would lose their sharp nature. Without that, they were essentially useless.

Long Chen hadn’t used them in combat because it would be too painful to his heart to have them broken. But against these enemies with no divine items to protect them, he could finally use the teeth.

The dragon teeth instantly pierced their defenses, and their aim was naturally their balls. They were instantly pierced.

To increase the teeth’s sharpness, Long Chen made them shrink to a foot in length. In that state, they could easily pierce the bull demons’ tough hides, especially around their balls. Miserable shrieks rang out as seventy-two bull demons fell to the ground. The sphere compressing him instantly fell out of balance.

The others quickly stabilized it, causing the space inside to once more crumble. However, Long Chen had already flown out of the opening.

He shot through their midst. Of course, he wouldn’t go for free. Evilmoon smoothly swept out, cutting off a dozen balls.

Those powerful demonic beasts fell to the ground, wailing. Their leader was infuriated. “Reduce your sizes!”

Their huge bodies allowed them to unleash their greatest power, but now it was a disadvantageous thing. It was like a group of giants trying to swat a fly. Furthermore, Long Chen had found a way to break their combination technique, and without being able to catch him off guard again, they had to switch tactics.

Thousands of bull demons quickly shrank down until they were only three meters tall. Holding bone spears, they shot at Long Chen.

“Battle armor!” Stars appeared in Long Chen’s eyes, and Evilmoon danced through the air.

The closest bull demon was killed with one slash. A head soared into the air before being blown apart by a kick from Long Chen.

This was the first one he killed. Previously, he had only cut off their balls, making them temporarily lose the ability to fight.

The strange thing was that after a certain amount of time, their balls would regrow. Their lifeforce was quite amazing.

However, a head wouldn’t regrow after it was blown apart. The first death of their comrades made these bull demons go berserk.

“Die!” Their leader roared and charged past its subordinates, striking Long Chen on its own.

Long Chen blocked its spear with Evilmoon. He felt his blood flip inside of him and was knocked back.

As Long Chen fell back, a dozen bone spears pierced toward him. He dodged repeatedly, but one pierced his shoulder blade, causing sharp pain to suddenly wrack his upper body.

Long Chen swung his blade, cutting the one who had struck him in half. Blood burst out of his shoulder. That blood seemed to stimulate the bull demons, and they charged over.

Long Chen roared and began to fight with his life on the line, but he was quickly submerged by their numbers.

“Commander, they’ve entered our shooting range. Long Chen needs our help!” One of the vice commanders sent a message to Shen Chengfeng.

In their rage, the bull demons had ended up being drawn closer to the battlefield without even realizing it. They had just entered the edge of their range.

“Not yet.” Shen Chengfeng shook his head, continuing to keep an eye as he fought.

“Long Chen is in crisis! We can’t wait!” cried the vice commander.

“What do you know? Shut up!” Shen Chengfeng roared back.

Long Chen had yet to even summon his white dragon scales. Hence, it was clear that he hadn’t used his full power, and his vice commander couldn’t even see that.

In the distance, Long Chen tried to charge through the blockade of the bull demons multiple times, but was unable to get past them. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

Long Chen was covered in blood. During this time, he had managed to kill a dozen of them.

“What a monster.” Shen Chengfeng couldn’t help feeling amazed. Long Chen not only had the power to kill a few of the bull demons while surrounded by thousands of them, but he was clearly constantly antagonizing them to make them lose their minds even more.

“Commander, they’ve fully entered our attack range. This is the best chance,” said the vice commander who had just been scolded. He couldn’t help it.

Shen Chengfeng shook his head. “The time is not fully ripe yet. Long Chen is allowing himself to be injured to draw them over. That’s definitely not just to kill a few of them. He’s putting in this much effort to get them all. If we attack now, one wave of attacks will only kill a third of them, and they’ll be gone by the second wave. Just keep an eye. When Long Chen gives the signal or the bull demons realize something is off, unleash the arrows.”

“Kill them all?” The vice commander was startled. “Heavens, if that works, wouldn’t we have profited even counting the loss of the arrow towers?!”

“Stay calm. Long Chen always likes to play big. Hehe, that’s why I’m the happiest of all that he’s come here. Damn, he’s really starting to go big.” Shen Chengfeng suddenly saw Long Chen summon a domain of flames. The golden flames filled the battlefield. It looked like he couldn’t hold on much longer.

The bull demons had gone berserk. He had repeatedly killed their comrades, but every time they were about to kill him, he would manage to slip away by just the slightest bit, driving them crazy.

The flames set them on fire but didn’t scare them. Instead, it made them think that Long Chen was on his last legs.

They were unaware that the flames were blocking their vision and sense of direction. They were getting closer to the center of the battlefield.

The flames also drowned out sounds. Some of the demonic beasts tried to warn them, but they were unable to hear them.

“Shen Chengfeng, it’s your turn. I don’t want anything but the balls.”

Long Chen suddenly shouted. Thunder rumbled, and Long Chen suddenly shot into the sky, leaving the battlefield.

“Fire!”

Shen Chengfeng gave the order immediately. Rays of divine light shot out of the arrow towers, shooting through the Titan Blood Bull demons.
