Chapter 3685 Seven Treasure Colored Glass Tree

The Tea Divine School’s patriarch took out a palm-sized flower pot with a sapling growing inside it. Although it was only three inches tall, the sapling was extremely elegant.

The leaves on the sapling had seven colors: red, orange, yellow, green, azure, blue, and violet. When Long Chen saw this little sapling, he almost lost his composure and shouted.

This was a tree from the primal chaos era, the Seven Treasure Colored Glass Tree. It was also called the Seven Treasure Ingenuity Tree, the Tree of Wisdom, and the Bodhi Tree. This kind of tree existed only in legend. Ever since the desolate battle, no one had seen one.

As for Long Chen, the only reason he could recognize it was because he had read about it in a damaged ancient tome.

Its seven-colored leaves represented seven kinds of energy: metal, wood, water, fire, earth, wind, and lightning. It had exactly the same energies and colors as Long Chen’s seven-colored divine ring.

Thus, when Long Chen saw this Seven Treasure Colored Glass Tree, he was so shocked that he couldn’t contain himself.

“Seven Color Qilin Tree? I didn’t expect you to have such a treasure!” said Long Chen.

He naturally wouldn’t tell the patriarch that this was the Seven Treasure Colored Glass Tree. If the latter were to know of it, then this fellow wouldn’t hand it over even if he was beaten to death.

However, Long Chen was overthinking it. People who knew of the Seven Treasure Colored Glass Tree were as rare as a phoenix feather or a qilin horn. Even if he told the patriarch what it was, he wouldn’t know just how rare it was.

This time, Long Chen didn’t speak spiritually. He directly spoke to the patriarch.

“Haha, junior brother’s vision is sharp. You instantly recognized the Seven Color Qilin Tree. This old man admires your vision.” The patriarch laughed. What shocked everyone was that he actually called Long Chen brother after being so angry just now.

People looked at each other, not knowing if they had gone crazy or something had happened. Why did his attitude change so quickly? They weren’t able to keep up.

However, hearing the name of the Seven Color Qilin Tree, countless people’s hearts shook. Some of the older generation’s experts had heard of this name.

“You’re too courteous. The Seven Color Qilin Tree is an ancient species. It is the companion tree of the auspicious beast, the qilin. It is also a symbol of prosperity. There was an ancient saying: the seven-color tree in the home attracts the qilin. Auspicious light shines, illuminating the home,” said Long Chen. 

“Legend has it that the Seven Color Qilin Tree will shine with divine light upon reaching a height of thirty thousand meters, forming a rainbow auspicious cloud that draws the qilin. Your luck really is envious.”

Seeing that Long Chen didn’t expose him, the patriarch was delighted. That meant that there was still room to talk. He courteously said, “To tell the truth, the reason that I’m so lucky to obtain it is thanks to the Tea Saint’s blessing. This Seven Color Qilin Tree was precisely given to me by the Tea Saint.”

“So that’s the case! Then I’ve been rude to sir. So you really do have a relationship with the Tea Saint.” Long Chen cupped his fists.Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

“No need to call me sir. I’m not wiser than you despite my extra years. I’ll call you brother Long Chen, and I am Jiang Wuxin. You can call me old brother Wuxin,” said the patriarch with a laugh.

“Haha, alright, old brother Wuxin, how about we sit and discuss the Dao?” Long Chen extended his hand.

“That would be good!” The patriarch smiled and sat on the Dao discussion stage. The surrounding people were all staring at them blankly. This sudden change was out of nowhere.

“Brother Long Chen, you’ve now seen your old brother’s sincerity. This Seven Color Qilin Tree is a priceless treasure. Let me put it to you this way: when I encountered the Tea Saint back in the day, I was a little brat with only average aptitude. I didn’t even have the potential to awaken a primal bloodline. Due to being squeezed out, I was forced to leave my family. Later on, it was this Seven Color Qilin Tree that caused my talent to undergo a heaven-toppling transformation. I awakened a primal bloodline that very day. After that, my cultivation base continued to make breakthrough after breakthrough. In three thousand years, I became a half-step Divine Venerate. If you don’t believe me, I can once more swear on my soul,” said the patriarch while sipping tea. He spoke spiritually, but on the surface, he appeared to be completely focused on the tea. There were no clues for outsiders to spot.

Long Chen smiled. “No need. I trust you. However, you still haven’t mentioned the important things. For example, why is it that you could become a half-step Divine Venerate in three thousand years, but now your cultivation base has stagnated for hundreds of thousands of years? Or why is the Seven Color Qilin Tree said to unleash auspicious light that draws the qilin after reaching a height of thirty thousand meters, but this particular tree hasn’t grown at all after so many years? Don’t tell me that when the Tea Saint gave you this Seven Color Qilin Tree, it was only the size of a grain of rice.”

“Well… in truth…”

“Don’t lie, or I will have you swear on it,” said Long Chen lightly. He took a sip of the new tea that the patriarch had poured. He closed his eyes and seemed to immerse himself in it.

“Alright. There are three reasons why I am willing to endure the pain of parting with the Seven Color Qilin Tree. The first is that it was only able to make me grow faster but was ineffective on others. Furthermore, at my current realm, it is no longer able to help me at all. The second is that when the Tea Saint gave me the Seven Color Qilin Tree, it was already this big. No matter what I did to help, there has been no growth even after hundreds of thousands of years. The third reason is that the Tea Saint didn’t even tell me its name when he gave it to me. He only told me to look after it and exchange it for what I need in the future. Brother Long Chen, I am telling the truth. I am filled with respect for the Tea Saint. Everything that I have was bestowed upon me by him. He is the reason why I created the Tea Divine School. I want the entire world to know his name. In truth, other than giving me this Seven Color Qilin Tree, the Tea Saint didn’t say anything else to me. I later secretly gathered the remnants of the Tea Scripture and then created the Tea Divine School. I came to challenge the Wine God Palace in order to increase our fame, but my heart isn’t bad. That’s why I am hoping that you can transmit the complete Tea Scripture to me, and I will give you the Seven Color Qilin Tree. If that’s not enough, just tell me what you want. As long as I have it, I won’t even hesitate,” said the patriarch sincerely.

Long Chen hadn’t expected this fellow to be so willing to take a beating. It seemed that he knew what gratitude was.

However, did his meeting with the Tea Saint mean nothing more than being entrusted to look after the Seven Treasure Colored Glass Tree? Furthermore, he was told to exchange it for what he needed. Just what was the meaning behind that?

Seeing that Long Chen still had his eyes closed in thought, the patriarch also closed his eyes, not daring to disturb him. But he was slightly nervous. It was as if he was waiting for Long Chen’s judgment. Clearly, he wasn’t an expert negotiator. He completely exposed his weak points and was practically asking to be bullied.

“No problem. I can transmit the first, second, and third parts of the Tea Scripture to you,” said Long Chen.

“Many thanks! Many thanks!”

The patriarch gratefully handed over the Seven Treasure Colored Glass Tree to Long Chen. Long Chen then reached out and received it.

But all of a sudden, the Seven Treasure Colored Glass Tree quivered and rainbow divine light shot out of it, illuminating the sky. Heaven and earth instantly became covered in a rainbow divine radiance.
