Chapter 4076 The Sound of Courting Death

Looking at Long Chen’s furious expression, Guo Ran and the others felt helpless. “Now it’s going to be over before it even starts. We won’t even get to do anything.”

“This bastard, why is his mouth so wretched? We missed such a good opportunity,” grumbled the Dragonblood warriors.

To dare to curse their boss’s woman, it would be strange if their boss didn’t do this. It was indeed a rare chance for the Dragonblood warriors to test themselves against a Heaven Venerate, but now that things had reached this point, they didn’t dare to fight over him with their boss. Thus, they could only curse this fellow for having a bad mouth.

At this moment, a pair of golden Kunpeng wings appeared on Long Chen’s back, and his figure instantly vanished.

Seeing this scene, the Ninth Elder was shocked. As a Heaven Venerate, he controlled heaven and earth, as they were under his command. So in theory, no one could conceal themselves around him.

However, Long Chen disappeared without a trace, leaving everyone unable to locate him. The Ninth Elder's initial assumption was that Long Chen hadn't concealed himself, but that his speed was so astonishing that even his divine sense couldn't keep up with it.

All of a sudden, with a roar, he smashed his spear in front of him.

BOOM!

The Minghong Saber suddenly materialized, colliding with the spear. It was only after the impact that the distinct sound of the saber being drawn from its sheath echoed.

“What speed!” Guo Ran and the others were genuinely shocked. The sound only came after the strike, and what they were seeing before them twisted, a sign that time and space were affected by the blow.

The Ninth Elder had relied on his years of combat experience to block Long Chen’s attack. However, blood still sprayed out of his mouth from the blow.ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

Pow!

Suddenly, a figure flashed and the Ninth Elder spun through the air, yellow teeth tumbling out of his mouth.

They couldn’t see the movements, but they heard the same familiar sound, the same familiar results. Guo Ran and the others knew that the Ninth Elder had just been slapped in the face.

“Boss’s speed is amazing!” exclaimed Xia Chen.

In the Vermilion Bird Empire, Long Chen had also displayed these Kunpeng wings. However, his current speed was incomparable to that time.

The runes of the Kunpeng wings needed to merge with their master bit by bit. Moreover, the wings grew along with their master. Because of this aspect, the Kunpeng race’s audacity to challenge the dragon race was not unbased. They truly did possess that power.

These wings from Kun Tu possessed an astonishing might. However, when Long Chen first obtained them, they still weren’t fully matured, and only a very small portion of the runes had been activated.

So, although Long Chen had gained more Kunpeng wings from the World King realm and the Divine Venerate realm, he was still using this set. Once he fully activated all its wings, he would then refine the next set.

While refining pills on the Ghost Ship, he didn’t know if it was due to the Earth Cauldron’s influence, but these Kunpeng wings actually began to actively merge with him rather than just passively be refined. By the time they reached the shore, the wings were already merged with him, and Long Chen could unleash the true power of these Kunpeng wings.

It had to be known that even a Divine Venerate Kunpeng would at most be able to use a portion of Immortal King wings and couldn’t fully merge with them. After all, they were a special race, and with every realm they advanced, more innate runes would appear on their body.

However, the majority of those runes could not be activated. Every progress would be based on each individual’s talent and bloodline.

That was different from other races. Other races would naturally manifest their innate runes once their growth reached a certain point, and then they would be able to unleash those divine abilities. At most, it would only take some extra training.

However, for the Kunpeng race, they would get some extra runes when they reached the Immortal King realm and then more when they reached the World King realm. But whether or not those runes could be used depended on each individual’s talent. In the Kunpeng race, there was no one capable of activating all of those runes. Being able to activate half of them was the mark of a peerless genius.

Kun Tu was viewed highly in the Kunpeng race, even though he had only been able to activate forty percent of the runes on his wings and only thirty percent of the runes on his body. As for his spiritual runes, he only managed to activate twenty percent.

Although it seemed as if these runes weren’t that useful as a result, there was a legend within the Kunpeng race. Every now and then, a peerless genius would appear and activate all their runes, sweeping through the nine heavens. Regretfully, such a legendary being stayed legend in the end. Even after countless years, this figure never appeared.

Long Chen naturally didn’t know about these legends or this information. All he knew was that now, these wings were very useful. With the runes on his wings fully activated, his speed reached a kind of limit.

The Ninth Elder still spun through the air. Suddenly, everyone heard an identical sound as before, and he spun in the opposite direction.

Due to his momentum, his upper body was moving in a different direction than his lower body, causing his body to twist like dough.

These two slaps left the Ninth Elder dazed, his head blank. He couldn’t tell the north from the south apart.

Long Chen repeatedly slapped him like it was free, his afterimages flickering around the Ninth Elder. He cursed, “Who let you be so arrogant, who let you speak so wretchedly, who let you repay kindness with enmity, you…”

The Ninth Elder was being spun around like a gyroscope, but he remained perfectly within Long Chen’s control. Long Chen slapped him over ten times, and then the Ninth Elder fell completely silent.

“He couldn’t be dead, right?!”

Xia Chen and the others were stunned.

“No, I don’t think he died, just fainted. Boss’s slaps never kill,” said Guo Ran.

As expected, the Ninth Elder woke up just as Guo Ran said this. But then he was slapped unconscious again.

Suddenly, Long Chen retreated and the Ninth Elder continued to spin in the air. When the spin finally slowed down, Guo Ran and the others let out startled cries.

“Is that really him?”

They could no longer recognize him, as his face was swollen like a pig’s, almost wider than his shoulders. His face had completely deformed and swollen to the very limit, looking like it might burst at any moment.

For his thin shoulders to be carrying such a huge head, it was a shocking and comical sight. Guo Ran and the others’ eyes had been opened to the world. This had to be the very limit, no?

“Boss, your power and control have reached the pinnacle! Any more and you would have made his head burst! You are definitely unrivaled!” praised Guo Ran after closely examining the Ninth Elder’s face.

“All of you, just wait!” The Ninth Elder’s mind only cleared up after hearing Guo Ran. Looking at his own wretched appearance, he quivered with rage, and tears leaked out of his eyes.

A grand Heaven Venerate had actually been beaten to the point of crying. Guo Ran and the others couldn’t believe this. Long Chen had really broadened their horizons.

“Run!”

Just then, a terrified cry rang out from Uncle Tree’s side, and the Seventh Elder and Eighth Elder were actually running away. It was unknown what technique Uncle Tree had used to scare them off.

The two of them had just turned and started running when countless branches of the locust tree pierced down, tearing through their bodies like sharp swords.
