Chapter 2942 Earth Master Status Plate

Six hours later, Long Chen left with a new status plate. He Ziyu stared at a starry medicinal pill in his hand with a blank expression.

“What a monster.” An elder appeared beside He Ziyu.

“Institute head, why have you come?” He Ziyu jumped in shock and hastily greeted him.

This elder was the one in charge of the Pill Institute. He then received the medicinal pill in He Ziyu’s hands and stared at it.

“I was drawn over by the aura of a treasure pill.”

“At such a young age, Long Chen couldn’t possibly refine such a pill. I don’t understand. Let alone disciples, even Elders that have been cultivating the Pill Dao for centuries can’t refine a furnace of treasure pills so easily.” He Ziyu shook his head.

In the immortal world, other than the standard grades for medicinal pills, there were also three classifications representing three different levels.

The five grades were low, middle, high, top, and peerless grade. Outside of these five grades were three additional classifications, spirit pills, treasure pills, and golden pills.

Spirit pills were the most commonly seen. As long as a pill contained enough spiritual qi, it was considered a spirit pill.

However, a treasure pill had transcended the limit of a spirit pill. It contained laws in addition to spiritual qi, causing it to undergo a fundamental change. This was no longer a matter of a person’s alchemy technique because it also required an extremely deep understanding of the Immortal Dao’s laws.

Alchemists that had bitterly cultivated for hundreds of years might still not be able to reach this level. Even if they could, their chances of refining treasure pills were definitely less than one in a thousand.

When he saw Long Chen refine a furnace of treasure pills, He Ziyu was simply too stunned to react. This shock could not be described with words.

Even as Long Chen left, he simply stood there, dumbfounded. He had no idea how Long Chen had done this.

“If it was just a matter of technique, that would be one thing. But comprehension of the Heavenly Daos is another matter. How can Long Chen possess such a profound realm? While refining, he became one with the Dao. Institute head, can you please tell me the answer? Long Chen, is he…” asked He Ziyu.

“No, there was no forceful rebirth. His spiritual fluctuations are still young, and this can easily be sensed. Furthermore, our academy’s formation isn’t for nothing. Plenty of old ghosts had snatched the bodies of our disciples and tried to steal the academy’s treasures, but weren’t they all easily captured? Long Chen is not possessed. But as to how he did it, it’s not important. There’s no need to investigate this to the end. Just act like you don’t know. What level of status plate did you give him for this?” asked the institute head.

“With his power, he could challenge the Heaven-rank instructor exam. But after the refinement, he said that he was out of Spiritual Strength and didn’t want to continue refining. In truth, he had at least eighty percent of his Spiritual Strength left. He just refused to continue. If he had, I feel like he would very likely pass the Heaven-rank exam. But since he didn’t, I could only give him an Earth Master status plate,” said He Ziyu.

“That little fellow knows how to be cautious. To have power but not be overly arrogant is a good thing. When it comes to Long Chen, help him out as much as possible as long as it doesn’t break the academy’s rules.”

“Yes.” He Ziyu nodded.

The Institute head looked toward a divine statue in the examination hall. The statue was worn down, but there was a flower in its hand. At this moment, a strange light appeared in the institute head’s eyes, and a smile slowly crept over his face.

…

“Huo Long, Moon Refiner, how could you two be so exaggerated just now?! How did you refine treasure pills?!” grumbled Long Chen.

Even Long Chen was stunned by the treasure pills he had refined this time. At that time, he had acted like he didn’t recognize them as treasure pills, but he knew that this act was meaningless. It couldn’t escape He Ziyu’s eyes.

With his current power, he had refined treasure pills, and at the one-star grade at that. If this information spread, it would shake the entire Pill Institute. He didn’t want to become a focal point. At that time, who knew how much trouble would come for him?

After talking to them, he learned that Huo Long had finished absorbing the energy of the companion ore, and its power had soared.

As for the Moon and Star Refining Furnace, while it was refining in that room, it had sensed a strange energy entering its body. That energy seemed to come from the statue, resulting in the treasure pills.

Long Chen was startled by that. According to what he knew, it was the statue of the founder of the Pill Institute. Long Chen had immediately noticed the Jewel Blood Jade Orchid in its hand, but he hadn’t had a chance to ask about it.

In any case, with his status, he wasn’t qualified to ask about some important matters. Also, he hadn’t found anything in the outer academy’s Divine Scripture Pavilion regarding the Pill Institute’s founder. Perhaps he might find something in the inner academy.

“Well, I got the Earth Master status plate. Hehe, there’s also a large reward for this. Not bad.”

Long Chen then went to the inner academy’s medicinal fields. After that, he found one of the supervisors and showed him his status plate. He even said some frightening words, saying that information about them selfishly keeping some plants and trading them had already spread.

It had to be known that working in the medicinal fields was lucrative not because of the pay, but because of the extra plants that were secretly grown. Unfortunately, the money didn’t just enter their own pocket. Seeing an Earth Master come to find trouble for him, this person was clear that this Earth Master was asking for money.

Everyone knew the unspoken rules of the medicinal fields. The ones down below didn’t report it, and the ones high up didn’t investigate it. If they did come to ‘investigate’, then they were really coming for their share of the profits.

However, Long Chen directly refused his bribe, causing this person to quiver in fear. He didn’t want money? Then did he want his life?

Long Chen directly said that he came because he wanted them to hold themselves back a bit. They couldn’t keep going over the top because the higher-ups had caught wind of this. If they didn’t start holding back more, they would be truly caught and punished.

When Long Chen actually warned him so nicely, he instantly realized that Long Chen was on their side. Otherwise, he wouldn’t be acting like this. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

After a round of scolding, Long Chen asked for what he came for. Very quickly, three of every plant within the medicinal fields landed in Long Chen’s primal chaos space.

There were tens of thousands of different plants, and he gained them just like that. Feeling satisfied, Long Chen left, leaving a group of supervisors that were filled with gratitude toward him.

As an Earth-rank instructor, Long Chen was entitled to a high level immortal cave in the Pill Institute. It was a hundred times better than his current immortal cave.

However, he couldn’t live there because the Pill Institute was independent. If he was there, then if Mu Qingyun and the others wanted to find him, they would have to go through a long process instead of directly going to him. If there was something urgent, it would be troublesome.

Ultimately, Long Chen returned to his immortal cave in the God Institute. He began planting the new medicinal ingredients he had gained, organizing them in a way that it would be easy to find them afterward.

In the outer academy, he had only come into contact with first tier medicinal ingredients. Hence, the pills that could be refined from them were also only first tier, usable by Mortal Transcendence disciples.

In the inner academy, he had obtained second and third tier ingredients, allowing him to refine pills for the Divine Flame realm and the Four Peak realm. He essentially no longer needed to worry about medicinal ingredients for these realms.

After Long Chen finished planting everything, the tablet on his waist suddenly began to flash.

“Damn, I’m fifth in line now!”

Long Chen was startled and hastily ran off. So much time had passed without him realizing it. If he missed it, he would have to queue again.

Long Chen then rushed out of his immortal cave. Just a moment afterward, a different figure vanished from the shadow of a tree.
