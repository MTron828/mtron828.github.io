Chapter 4184: I Want This Fox

As Long Chen’s sword shook the heavens, a lightning arc flashed, causing the very Heavenly Daos to quiver. This lightning sword contained all of Lei Linger’s power.

Only Lei Linger’s heavenly tribulation lightning could restrict this Ghost Dao lifeform. Whether he was a corpse or an illusory body, he couldn’t withstand the power of the thunderforce.

Having almost been conned to death, Long Chen was enraged, so he showed no mercy with this attack.

Facing such a furious thunderforce, this lifeform was filled with terror. On the surface, he seemed to be able to avoid everyone’s attack effortlessly. However, in truth, a portion of their attacks still reached him.

Out of all those attacks, it was Mu Qingyun’s sword that caused him the greatest harm, striking his core. Although he pretended to be fine, he had actually taken an internal wound and was trying to recover.

Now, Long Chen’s consecutive attacks exacerbated his injuries, giving him no time to recuperate, just like how he hadn’t given Long Chen any time either.

This Ghost Dao lifeform then let out a furious roar and stabbed his bone dagger forward with all his power. Behind him, black qi burst into existence, condensing into eight giant tentacles.

BOOM!

When Long Chen’s sword struck the white dagger, bolts of lightning exploded, crashing out like water breaking free from a dam.

The Ghost Dao expert’s eight black tentacles were entangled with lightning and actually drew Long Chen’s thunderforce into the space behind him.

Knowing that he couldn’t endure such a terrifying thunderforce, the Ghost Dao expert had to use his full power just to displace Long Chen’s thunderforce.

However, Long Chen’s thunderforce was extremely tough. Even after using one of his divine abilities, the Ghost Dao expert was unable to fully shed the thunderforce. As a result, his tentacles began to explode one after another.

Finally, his true body was unable to endure this attack anymore and exploded. The air was shrouded in black qi before it gradually dissipated.

“Long Chen, you bullied me with numbers this time! Just wait, I, Gui Xuan, will not let you off! Wash your neck and wait for me!” His furious roar could be heard from the dispersing black qi.

When the black qi vanished, his aura was gone without a trace.

“How can this be?! My formation is unable to stop him!” exclaimed Xia Chen. The moment Long Chen attacked, Xia Chen immediately set up a grand formation just to prevent the Ghost Dao lifeform from fleeing. However, the latter left without even touching the formation and just silently vanished.

Everyone’s expression also changed. They had never encountered such a terrifying lifeform before.

“Big brother Long Chen, if you had let me attack, he wouldn’t have been able to escape,” said Huo Linger, her voice ringing out in Long Chen’s mind. She was unhappy. She had wanted to attack, but Long Chen hadn’t let her.

“There’s no need to expose too much power. After all, the Sage King Convention will have many monsters just like him. Don’t worry, you’ll have your chance,” consoled Long Chen.

Seeing that Bai Shishi and the others still had stunned expressions, Long Chen knew that this fellow called Gui Xuan had given them quite a significant blow.

“Don’t be dejected. The reason you were unable to cause him significant damage is because the Ghost Dao’s lifeforms are just too special. But don’t mind too much. They are too mysterious, and we don’t understand them, so we don’t know their weaknesses. Once we learn their weak points, it’ll be easy to deal with them. Qingyun, that sword strike of yours was very beautiful, and you managed to harm his source. If it weren’t for your attack, I wouldn’t have been able to beat him so easily,” said Long Chen, praising Mu Qingyun in the end.

“Really?” Mu Qingyun was delighted.

Originally, Mu Qingyun had been quite confident this time for the Sage King Convention. She believed it was an opportunity to challenge various experts and enhance her comprehension of the Sword Dao. Little did she anticipate that her all-out strike to someone's head would be ineffective, and this dealt a severe blow to her confidence.

Fortunately, Long Chen’s encouragement instantly revitalized her. His approval was the greatest encouragement to her.

“Of course, it’s true. However, your sword strike was off,” said Long Chen.

“How was it off?” asked Mu Qingyun. Everyone was confused by this statement. Mu Qingyun’s sword had accurately struck that lifeform in the head; it had been perfect.

“It was your heart that was off.” Long Chen smiled. “A sword cultivator must not only possess confidence in their sword but also in their techniques and themselves. A true sword cultivator doesn’t need to intentionally aim for someone’s vital parts. As soon as you intentionally search for weaknesses in your opponent, your Sword Dao’s will weaken a great deal. It is because you are afraid that you can’t kill your opponent that you aim for their vital parts. However, this subconscious thought causes the will of your Sword Dao to fade. That is why your attack only injured him but failed to end him.”

Mu Qingyun immediately grasped the wisdom in Long Chen's words and felt a deep admiration for him. His insight remained as keen as ever, and these simple words served as enlightenment to her. It seemed that being with him, it would be hard not to constantly advance.

“Big Sister Qingyun, you’re amazing!” Bai Xiaole couldn’t help praising her. He always felt great admiration for Mu Qingyun.

“Xiaole, how are your pupil arts so weak?” Long Chen turned and frowned at Bai Xiaole.

Bai Xiaole’s pupil art covered a huge range and contracted very fast. Even the Ghost Dao lifeform, with his fast reactions, was caught by it. That meant that this technique was very powerful.

However, despite being bound, the Ghost Dao lifeform still managed to easily escape. Long Chen didn’t know where the problem lay.

“Of course, he’s weak! This idiot could die of idiocy! Do you know how many months he took just to learn this one technique!? He didn’t even learn it properly! Long Chen, you’ve really conned me!”

Just then, a furious roar rang out, and a fox with violet eyes appeared on Bai Xiaole’s shoulder.

It was precisely the Violet Pupil Nine Tail Fox that Bai Xiaole had summoned back then.

Now, it was glaring at Long Chen so much that flames almost burst out of its head.

“You… you’re… What happened to you? How did you become so weak?” Long Chen almost couldn’t believe his eyes. Back in the three thousand worlds, this fox’s aura had been so terrifying. But now, it was only in the Immortal King realm.

“You have the face to speak?! Isn’t it all because of you?! After merging with this fellow, all my power was absorbed by him! Most hateful of all, this fellow is too stupid! He’s unable to use his pupil arts in unison with me. I’m really going to die of rage one day!” roared the Violet Pupil Nine Tail Fox.

Despite being cursed at, Bai Xiaole didn’t say a word. After all, forming a contract with this fox had bestowed upon Bai Xiaole a significant advantage. In contrast, the Violet Pupil Nine Tail Fox had endured immense suffering. Thus, Bai Xiaole bore the curses without protest.

“Wow, what a cute fox! I want this fox.”

Just as the Violet Pupil Nine Tail Fox was venting its anger, a group of people in the distance surrounded Long Chen and the others.
