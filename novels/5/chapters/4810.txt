Chapter 4799 Devils From Beyond the Heavens

The mixed beast alliance left, but the one whom Long Chen had struck down had to be dragged away by an elder.

“Those idiots don’t know that if it weren’t for Feng You, none of them would have lived past today,” Guo Ran snorted disdainfully once the mixed beast alliance left.

“Long Chen, Feng You will suffer for that slap,” sighed Yu Qingxuan.

Everyone could see that while Feng You’s talent and aptitude could be considered outstanding, the mixed beast alliance’s Heaven Saint didn’t seem to care that much about her and still ordered her around.

Those disciples who had come with the mixed beast elder exuded auras native to the Sovereign Emperor Heaven, indicating that they possessed a natural advantage in this realm. However, they let this little advantage cloud their minds.

For example, the fellow who had provoked Long Chen. He hadn’t even grasped just how strong Long Chen was before provoking him and even stepping forward to attack. From this, it could be seen just how much the native experts looked down on the newcomers.

“There’s no way around it. I’m rather selfish, and it’s not possible for me to just swallow their bullshit. Not killing him right there was already me giving Feng You face,” said Long Chen as he shook his head.

“Dean Long Chen, you might have tried to dissolve the situation peacefully, but your efforts are futile. The mixed beast alliance intentionally followed us here to be a bully, so they must have a backer behind them. That girl will likely become your enemy in the future. You should be prepared,” explained Bai Letian.

“It’s up to her. If we really meet each other on the battlefield once more, there will be nothing I can do,” sighed Long Chen. How could he not tell the mixed beast alliance’s intentions? He could already imagine how Feng You would be bullied and squeezed out in the mixed beast alliance once she arrived. After all, he had experienced such a thing far too many times.

These native experts definitely looked down on them. Furthermore, every powerful faction had to have intense competition between its disciples, and they encouraged this competition. As long as it didn’t result in large-scale massacres, they would allow them to fight it out.

It was through this competition that they could see who had the greatest potential in the future. After all, no matter how large the faction was, they had a limited amount of resources.

Just as the finest steel was reserved for the blade's edge to prevent wastage, geniuses were cultivated under intense pressure, akin to poison bugs in a jar. Through this intense competition, the allocation of resources would be decided.

The higher-ups would always encourage this competition through various martial assemblies and fighting ranks. So, when the inherent disdain the natives felt for newcomers was added in...

Even without Long Chen, Feng You and the others wouldn’t have a good time. Of course, this slap had only made things worse for her, but there was nothing Long Chen could do. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

In any case, he had said what he wanted to, so whatever decision she made would be up to her.

With no outsiders present, Bai Letian coordinated arrangements for the academy's disciples and their guests to settle in. The site lay in ruins, still bearing the lingering pressure of Heaven Saints. Most found this pressure stifling, so the High Firmament Academy was forced to move their temporary camp.

About half a day’s journey, they found a suitable location to rest. Luckily, the Sovereign Emperor Heaven brimmed with dense spiritual qi, and the laws of the Heavenly Daos were omnipresent.

In this place, even without intentionally cultivating, one would quickly grow closer to heaven and earth. The harmonious fusion of heaven and earth's laws occurred effortlessly within them.

Within a newly established hall, Long Chen, Bai Letian, Bai Zhantang, Bai Shishi’s mother, Bai Xiaole’s mother, and the Heaven, Earth, Wind, and Lightning Elders were seated together.

Bai Letian solemnly said, “Dean Long Chen, Vice Palace Master Zhantang has briefly explained our situation here to you. However, we have gained a deeper understanding of this place while he was gone, and things are more dire than we expected.”

“What did you discover?” asked Long Chen.

“The Sovereign Emperor Heaven has the High Firmament Academy’s number one branch, historically its strongest. Its fate relates to the rise and fall of the academy as a whole. Despite bracing ourselves for the worst-case scenarios, we didn’t expect our enemies to be so vicious. They actually drew devils from beyond the heavens to suppress us.”

Before Bai Zhantang left, Bai Letian and the others had only probed the outer regions of the academy. Although the situation was serious and there were countless devils around, the High Firmament Divine Sword alone should have sufficed to handle them.

Bai Xiaole’s mother then explained. “They are devils that do not belong to the nine heavens and ten lands, and they are not restricted by the laws of the three worlds and Six Daos. They are species from beyond the heavens that have stayed ever since the primal chaos battle. Based on our understanding, they have the aura of the devil race on them and should have the same ancestors as the devil race. However, they also have a special aura. They possess mysterious powers that exceed the laws of this world, and some of those powers are simply incomprehensible to us. For example, they possess the ability to devour and corrode karmic luck. That is what we are most worried about right now.”

“Devour and corrode karmic luck?!” Bai Zhantang’s expression grew exceedingly ugly when he heard that.

Long Chen finally understood the real problem. This special ability was the bane of the High Firmament Academy.

“Did someone intentionally draw them over?” asked Long Chen.

Bai Letian nodded.

“Who?”

“The Brahma Pill Valley.”

Hearing that, Long Chen felt like he was struck by a bolt of lightning, and he clenched his fists without realizing it.

“Lord Brahma?!”
