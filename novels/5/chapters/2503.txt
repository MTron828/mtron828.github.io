Chapter 2493 Two Paths

Long Chen paused and turned back.

The white-robed man said, “This ship has countless opportunities on it, as well as countless dangers. The Ghost Ship has temporarily lost its direction and is trapped within the dragon nest. But once it breaks out of the dragon nest, it will find its original path. The Star Field Divine World is just one of its temporary stops. Before it breaks the dragon nest, we must reach the aft of the ship. Otherwise, we’ll be dragged away by the Ghost Ship to unknown worlds. At that time, the barrier separating the Ghost Ship from the outside will strengthen in order to pass through the wall between worlds. If you were still here by then, you would be trapped here and die of old age.”

Long Chen’s expression changed. Mo Nian and the others were unaware of this. If they wasted too much time, they wouldn’t return.

“You don’t need to worry about them. They are walking normal paths. Even if they don’t reach the end, when the dragon nest breaks, they will see the end anyway. The reason I have called you is because there are two particularly special places on the ship. I’m asking if you want to go there or not,” said the white-robed man.

“Are they very dangerous?”

The white-robed man nodded. “One of them was left to me by Sovereign Yun Shang. He told me to go there. As for the other one… Sovereign Yun Shang told me not to go there under any circumstances.”

Long Chen’s heart pounded. “Are you…”

The strange divine light shrouding the white-robed man’s face suddenly faded.

“You!” Long Chen jumped in shock. This person was clearly Sovereign Yun Shang. It was only their eyes that were slightly different.

“I am Sovereign Yun Shang’s son, Yun Tian. Greetings, brother Long.” The white-robed man smiled and cupped his fists at Long Chen. Even the graceful way he acted was identical to Sovereign Yun Shang.

“Greetings, brother Yun. I didn’t expect Sovereign Yun Shang to have a son. This is wonderful news for the Martial Heaven Continent,” said Long Chen.

Long Chen was full of questions. Although he had suspected that this person was Sovereign Yun Shang’s descendant, he hadn’t thought that it was possible for him to be his son. His appearance, his mannerisms, even the nobility revealed with each of his movements was similar. Long Chen didn’t doubt that he was related to Sovereign Yun Shang in the slightest.

“Brother Long, have you seen Sovereign Yun Shang?” asked Yun Tian. Curiously, despite calling himself his son, he didn’t call Sovereign Yun Shang his father.

Long Chen nodded, explaining how he had encountered Sovereign Yun Shang in the Spirit World.

“So that’s the case.” Yun Tian nodded. Seeing his confusion, Yun Tian explained, “Now I finally understand why what Sovereign Yun Shang left for me ended up taken by you. Back then, Sovereign Yun Shang left not just Dragonbone Evilmoon but also the evil dragon soul essence for you. But you only obtained one, while the evil dragon soul essence was taken by someone else. That has caused all the following karma to become distorted. It is no longer within Sovereign Yun Shang’s control. However, the amount of essence blood within the blood essence stone is enough for me to awaken the dormant Sovereign blood in my body, so you don’t need to feel guilty over it. If such a distortion had not occurred, I would follow Sovereign Yun Shang’s instructions and choose the path that he left for me. But now, I feel that the Sovereign’s calculations have gone astray. Following his instructions will probably only cause greater problems. So I wish to discuss with you what paths to take. These two paths are both filled with dangers, especially the other path. What do you think?”

Long Chen said, “You should take the path that the Sovereign left for you. Because I am always someone outside of others’ plans, I will walk the other path.”

This second path had to be even more dangerous due to Sovereign Yun Shang’s warning. But based on Long Chen’s experience, the more dangerous it was, the greater the possible rewards would be.

Yun Tian pondered this. ”You obtained the dragon king blood essence stone first, and the karma has been distorted. Perhaps karma has deviated toward you. You should walk the path Sovereign Yun Shang indicated.”

Yun Tian was caught in a difficult position. The Sovereign’s calculations had gone amiss. If they continued to make the wrong choice, things would only grow worse.

“Ah, this is a simple decision to make. I have a coin here. We can flip it. The front side represents me, and the back represents you. This can decide which one of us walks the path that Sovereign Yun Shang indicated. Why not let the heavens decide?” suggested Long Chen.

“This idea is not bad.” Yun Tian’s eyes brightened.

Long Chen smiled and flipped a coin. It landed on the ground, bounced a few times, and lay there.

“As expected.”

Long Chen was prepared. His luck was constant and had never followed him before. It landed backside up.

“The heavens have left the other path to me,” said Long Chen.

After confirming that Long Chen hadn’t cheated, Yun Tian nodded. He solemnly said, “Alright, then go to the left. I will take the right. Let’s both live to see each other once more.”

Yun Tian walked to the right, and with one step, he vanished.

Everyone else had stepped forward without realizing that there were two completely different paths to the left and right.

“We all have to work hard to survive. Even the path that Sovereign Yun Shang indicated probably isn’t an easy one,” muttered Long Chen to himself. He stepped to the left.

The surroundings instantly changed. The ship was still a ship with the same structure, but everything else had changed.

“Kill!”

A fierce cry rang out followed by a cold Sword Qi slashing toward Long Chen. Long Chen hastily dodged, only to find that the Sword Qi continued to slash toward him.

The Sword Qi passed straight through his body without causing any damage. It seemed that he was in an illusory world that he was not part of but could see.

The Sword Qi hadn’t struck him but an expert behind him. That expert exploded.

Long Chen could smell the scent of blood. He could feel the warm blood dripping down his body.

Long Chen realized that he was in the middle of a battlefield. There were two groups of people killing each other on the Ghost Ship.

He was unable to see the original crew members. There were only two groups of experts fighting. Standing there, he saw them crazily attacking each other.

He observed them closely. Their fighting style was completely different from the Martial Heaven Continent’s. Their fighting style was like those of mortals who didn’t know how to cultivate, but a casual blow from them still contained immense power. Long Chen was unable to tell where this power came from.

Their chaotic battle continued. They were both charging toward the central tower that was located between two giant masts. It didn’t make sense how it could tower out of the ship so high, but the reality was that it did.

After watching for a while, Long Chen only managed to grasp that little bit of information. He shook his head. His time was precious, and since he couldn’t tell anything else from this scene, he took another step.

Those people vanished but the battlefield remained. Now, it was a different group fighting. He also saw that the surroundings had changed.

Before this, the Ghost Ship had been passing through the chaotic flow of space, leaving everything in darkness. But now, the surroundings were speckled with stars. The Ghost Ship was passing through the starry sky.

The starry sky was peaceful, but there was a cruel slaughter occurring on the ship. Long Chen saw the original crew members from the start, but now they were being killed.

It was like a ship that was being plundered by pirates. The pirates killed any of the crew members that they saw without the slightest mercy.

The crew members were quickly slaughtered. Meanwhile, the pirates laughed and charged toward the same tower. After they reached it, the world grew silent once more. After entering the tower, not one came out.

Long Chen stepped forward once more. He saw a bloody battle again.

This time it wasn’t just humans he saw. He saw a race of beasts with human heads and fierce monsters with dark auras around them. There were various races fighting each other. Their target was once more the tower.

“It seems that they all want to get the tower. But when I got onto the Ghost Ship, the tower wasn’t there.”

Long Chen started to grow uneasy. He had a premonition that he was gradually approaching somewhere extremely dangerous.

Long Chen continued stepping forward, and the scenes continued to change. The wood of the Ghost Ship grew redder and redder from blood. Its aura also grew more ominous.

At first, the Ghost Ship’s aura had been quite peaceful, but as he continued to advance through the scenes, the atmosphere grew darker. Long Chen felt like he was walking toward the gates of hell. Actually, this aura was even more frightening than hell.

Without even realizing it, Long Chen started to get goosebumps all along his neck. His nerves tightened.

“This really is a damnable place. I don’t feel like my guts are small, so why am I trembling?” Long Chen involuntarily gulped. There was something terrifying up ahead.

“Fuck, I have to see what it is.”

Long Chen clenched his teeth. With a deep breath, he continued forward. With every step, he saw more blood.

There were all kinds of races that he had never seen before appearing. Their attack styles and techniques were foreign to him, but their power was truly stunning.

The scent of blood grew stronger, and a chill pervaded his body. His entire body ached.

Suddenly, Long Chen dodged. A cold light flew over his head, leaving a line of blood on his forehead.

Evilmoon appeared in his hand, and he slashed it at the lifeform in front of him.
