Chapter 3787 Power of Four Stars

“Closer and closer.”

An ancient voice rang out within the darkness.

“What is getting closer and closer?” asked Long Chen.

This was the same mysterious voice that appeared every time he descended into darkness.

“Distance… danger… truth… hope…”

That mysterious voice grew indistinct. Long Chen barely heard a few words, but he suddenly woke up.

“Boss!”

Jiang Lei cried out in delight when he saw Long Chen wake up.

Long Chen found that other than Jiang Lei, the kindly elder was present as well. He was the leader of the Spirit race within the three thousand worlds.Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

“Many thanks for saving me, senior.” Long Chen hastily rose and bowed.

“Nothing more than waving a hand. My power is limited, and I could not fully heal your injuries. You will need to rest a few days,” said the elder before leaving.

Only then did Long Chen notice violet qi raging within his body, and endless stars circulating. Raising his hand, he felt explosive power flowing within him. It felt like a single wave of his hand could break the dome of the heavens.

“This is the power I should possess after becoming an Immortal King!”

Long Chen now felt that his power had increased by over ten times compared to when he underwent tribulation. It had been a long time since he felt his power growing so explosively.

The most shocking thing to him was that there was now a green layer of energy on top of his meridians that was slowly healing the tears.

“You have to thank that little fellow. He sacrificed his own longevity to split some of his source divine elixir to help you recover. Otherwise, your injuries wouldn’t heal without at least a month. Most importantly, his Immemorial Spirit Wisteria race has a certain affinity with your violet qi. At the same time as he helped you recover, he once more widened your meridians. With this, your meridians are finally tough enough and can endure the necessary power. Your meridians are now even a bit stronger than I anticipated,” said the dragon expert.

Long Chen was startled. He was befuddled as to why the Spirit race’s leader would go so far for him. He was grateful but also felt guilty and uneasy.

However, for such a great favor, just a simple thanks was meaningless. He promised himself that he would repay the Spirit race.

“Senior, how many places are there to undergo tribulation within the three thousand worlds? Why is it that I didn’t see many humans in the Heavenly River Blood Sea?” asked Long Chen. He was originally hoping to find a few Dragonblood warriors there to undergo tribulation with. But he didn’t encounter a single one.

“There are over ten places like the Heavenly River Blood Sea in the three thousand worlds. As for slightly inferior places, there are countless. In truth, the Heavenly River Blood Sea isn’t suitable for the human race to undergo tribulation, so naturally not many humans would take the risk of going. I only had you go as preparation for the dragon scale. The others definitely went to other places,” said the dragon expert.

Only then did Long Chen relax about the Dragonblood warriors. If that was the case, he could definitely still find the others. Otherwise, the Supreme Heavenly Dao Fruits on the Heavenly Dao Tree would go to waste.

Currently, he had over ten thousand of them. However, the number was a bit odd. During the tribulation, there were tens of thousands of Supreme heavenly geniuses who died.

However, Long Chen barely had over ten thousand. He didn’t know if it was because they had been too far for the Heavenly Dao Tree to sense them when they died, or if only a portion could be absorbed by the Heavenly Dao Tree.

Long Chen continued to recover. Thanks to the Spirit race’s leader helping him, his recovery was extremely quick. In a single day, his meridians were fully healed.

As for Jiang Lei, his power had also grown explosively. Using the approach that Long Chen gave him, he no longer had such powerful Blood Qi. Instead, the thunderforce in his Dantian had replaced the Blood Qi flowing through his meridians.

Jiang Lei had benefited from the nine star heirs just like Long Chen, and his meridians were over ten times wider and filled with thunderforce. At this moment, lightning runes flickered in his eyes. His aura was astonishing. He was a truly terrifying lightning cultivator now.

Jiang Lei was incredibly excited by this. By himself, all of his work had still left him below average within the cultivation world. But in just a few days with Long Chen, he had soared to the peak. Although he might not say that he was unrivaled, only very few people could match him within the same realm.

After they recovered, Long Chen bade farewell to the Spirit race’s leader. Now that he had recovered, he should search for his comrades. It would be best to distribute the Supreme Heavenly Dao Fruits now, or once the three thousand worlds closed, there would no longer be such a chance.

As for the Spirit race leader’s help, Long Chen didn’t say thanks. He simply said that the Spirit race’s matters were his matters, and if they ever needed any help, just ask.

At the time he was leaving, he found that the Spirit race’s experts had also vanished. He didn’t know if they had also gone to undergo tribulations or if they had simply left. He didn’t ask.

“Seven Star Battle Armor! FengFu Star! Alioth Star! Life Fate Star! Enlightenment Palace Star!”

Within a desolate wilderness, Long Chen’s seven-color divine ring revolved. One star after another lit up, and every star caused his aura to grow crazily.

When he summoned four stars, the world began to quiver. The explosive power caused huge spatial distortions. The seven-star divine ring’s light was like a sword piercing the heavens. It was a shocking scene.

“It’s been three days. Four stars is the limit. If I activate five stars, I’ll need to release some of my aura.”

Long Chen had seven stars flowing within his divine ring, but only four stars were lit. The other three were dim.

“However, even just four stars is no weaker than the complete Six Star Battle Armor from the past.” After sensing the immense power in his body, Long Chen smiled.

The dragon expert was right. The Seven Star Battle Armor was too powerful. Without powerful meridians, he couldn’t control it.

However, even now that his meridians were strengthened, it still wasn’t enough to summon the complete Seven Star Battle Armor. He couldn’t even summon the fifth star.

His body had yet to adapt to this unprecedented power. Forcibly activating it would cause some of his power to be wasted, leaking into the world. If that was the case, although it would give off a frightening explosive aura, its power wasn’t concentrated. There wasn’t much point to that.

It was just like the current of a river. The flow was limited normally. But once the dam was released, there would be a flood that could shatter mountains. The destructive powers between the two were completely different.

“Hehe, it should be ten to fifteen days. Then my body will adapt to this new power. By then, will I need to fear those animals?” Long Chen laughed. He had completely transformed and was no longer afraid of anyone.

Two days later, Long Chen and Jiang Lei arrived at a large human city. Just as they reached the city gates, they heard someone beating drums and gongs, as well as shouting.

“The limitless palace in front of the limitless mountain, the limitless trees before the limitless gate, the dreams of heavenly geniuses vanish without a trace as soon as they encounter Mo Nian!”

“Oh?”
