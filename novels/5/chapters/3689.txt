Chapter 3678 Heavenly Talisman Refines the Heart

“Junior brother Guo Ran greets big brother! Big brother, I’ve long since heard about your great name!” Guo Ran was extremely emotional to see Xia Guhong, a hero whose name had shaken the world.

It had to be known that Xia Guhong was a peerless hero in the Alldevil Star-Field, a figure of legends and miracles. How could Guo Ran not be emotional to meet him?

Guo Ran had only worshiped a few figures in this lifetime, and Xia Guhong was one of them. Most exciting of all was that this legendary figure was actually his boss’s brother. Then wouldn’t that mean that he was also his brother? That was a huge honor for him!

If the Alldevil Star-Field’s people were to learn that he was brothers with Xia Guhong, wouldn’t they view him like a god? Just how glorious would that be?

“Can you have some face? When you ascended to the Alldevil Star-Field, you were already this old. Just how long has it been?” demanded Long Chen.

“You can’t put it that way. After ascending, I feel like his face grew even bigger than before,” supplemented Xia Chen.

“Hahaha!” Xia Guhong laughed. “It’s rare to have such good brothers. Come and drink some wine!”

“Hehe, many thanks, big brother!” Guo Ran was delighted to be called brother by Xia Guhong. That was essentially recognizing them, so he was overjoyed.

Xia Chen respectfully bowed toward Xia Guhong and called him big brother before entering his little hut.

The four of them sat down. Xia Guhong then appraised Xia Chen and nodded, a trace of admiration appearing in his eyes.

“Not bad, not bad. Your soul energy is flawless. You’ve already entered a state of natural being. I have only met less than a handful of masters on the Talisman Dao who could reach this step at such a young age. What level of Heavenly Talisman Refines the Heart have you reached?”

As soon as Xia Guhong asked him that, Xia Chen felt even greater veneration for him. It had to be known that even within the Heavenly Talisman Star-Field, not many people knew of Heavenly Talisman Refines the Heart. Even Gongsun Xuan was unaware of it.

It was a kind of mental realm. There were a total of nine levels, and this realm was differentiated by the Heavenly Daos. Only someone whose mental realm had reached that level would understand it.

Heavenly Talisman Refines the Heart was an inexplicable law of the Heavenly Daos. If you reached it, you would naturally understand. If you didn’t reach it, explaining it would have no meaning.

For Xia Guhong to mention it meant that he had also reached that realm. Although he wasn’t a talisman cultivator, this was what it meant for all ten thousand Daos to reach the same place. The height that he had reached allowed him to see more things.

“Junior brother is foolish. Currently, I am only at the third level. I have not managed to pass the fourth level,” said Xia Chen shamefully.

Xia Guhong looked at him and suddenly laughed. “You haven’t done Heavenly Talisman Refines the Heart recently, have you?”

“Yes. Junior brother’s mind has not been calm lately, so I haven’t tried it.” Xia Chen nodded.

“If you try, you will find that you can easily pass. You have passed that emotional obstacle, and you have seen through it clearly. The fourth level can be easily passed,” said Xia Guhong.

For Xia Guhong to say this, even Long Chen was stunned. Xia Guhong’s sharp vision seemed to be able to see through everything.

“Many thanks for the reminder, big brother! Junior brother will try it later!” Xia Chen was amazed. As expected of a legendary figure, his perception was absolutely terrifying. Nothing could be concealed from him.

“Big brother, you’re so godly! Can you read this junior brother’s fate? Will junior brother soon rise and stand out above all others?” Seeing Xia Guhong turn to him, Guo Ran immediately smiled brightly.

Xia Guhong smiled. “You are a slacker, and you always think of taking shortcuts. It is fated that you will have difficulty ever standing out. However, you are quite smart. Knowing that you are a vine, you wrapped yourself around a large tree with limitless potential. You will rise with the tree. As long as you continue to follow the tree, you will also see the same scenery, the light and warmth. With the smallest price, you will obtain the greatest glory.”

“Hehe, big brother, you really are amazing! You instantly saw through junior brother’s thoughts!” Guo Ran laughed mischievously. He didn’t feel any sense of shame. He was pleased with himself, treating these words as praise.

“That’s because I also had a junior brother like you by my side back in the day,” sighed Xia Guhong.

“Where is he now? Is he seeing endless scenes of glory?” asked Guo Ran.

“No. He can no longer see anything. In order to save his big sister, he died at the hands of the Alldevil race. That year, he was only nineteen.” Xia Guhong seemed to sink into his memories, pain appearing in his eyes.

“Are you talking about the Demon Forging Genius Luo Zijun? Luo Qingying’s little brother?” asked Guo Ran, feeling startled.

“Correct. Him. Someone whose forging talent was not at all inferior to Qingying, but refused to put in the effort. He spent all day studying odd things, pursuing some dream of instantly ascending to the heavens in one go. He really was similar to you.” Xia Guhong looked at Guo Ran. Only then did Xia Chen and Long Chen learn that Luo Qingying had a little brother, and that he was Xia Guhong’s brother-in-law.

“Big brother, I’m sorry!” Guo Ran instantly felt embarrassed to have dragged out something so painful to Xia Guhong.

Xia Guhong shook his head. “It’s fine. Everything is in the past. Furthermore, you’ve all done very well. You killed the Alldevil race and sealed the channel. Things that we were unable to accomplish back in the day were accomplished by you. That means that you’re even stronger than us from back then.”Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

“Big brother, you know of it?” Long Chen was surprised. The Alldevil Star-Field was still locked in seclusion, no?

“The Alldevil Star-Field is a place that hurt my heart. I naturally will keep an eye on it. To tell the truth, whenever I looked at it, I wanted to see how those fools destroy themselves. But you led the human race to victory. Now, I understand why Qingying didn’t let me avenge her. I thought that it was for her family, but now I know. It was for me. She knew that my fury would not just befall the Luo clan. I would also kill the people who condemned me, leading the human race of the Alldevil Star-Field to destruction. Perhaps back then, my actions were understandable, repaying enmity with enmity, kindness with kindness. But my actions were unable to hold up to the passage of time. When it comes to vision, I’m far from reaching Qingying’s level. She sees further than me. She didn’t let me avenge her for the human race and for myself. The reason I can understand now is because of you, Long Chen. I now understand what Qingying was thinking. Long Chen, you are more outstanding than me.” Xia Guhong looked at Long Chen.

Long Chen shook his head with a bitter smile. “In your eyes, you think that my actions are correct. But perhaps thousands or tens of thousands of years in the future, these actions will no longer be considered correct. Big brother, you overestimate me. To tell the truth, I just do whatever I feel like. As for right or wrong, I’ll leave it to others and history to judge. I’m just going to worry about myself.”

For Xia Guhong to praise him like this, Long Chen was feeling ashamed. How were his actions based on farsight? It was still the same old thing. Look indifferently on life and death, and just fight whoever tried to block him. Who cared about right or wrong?

“That’s right, big brother. Wasn’t there something urgent you were looking for me for?” asked Long Chen.

Xia Guhong then turned serious and nodded.

“The great prophet has prophesied that in one month, the entrance to the three thousand worlds will open. This is a rare golden age that appears only once every million years. You cannot miss it.”
