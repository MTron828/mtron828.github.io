Chapter 2943 Brazen Plot

“Good, I made it on time.” Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

Long Chen managed to arrive at the entrance to the divine flame spirit pool just as it was his turn. He then sighed with relief.

After he handed over his tablet, a passage appeared before him. As soon as he stepped in, a wave of fiery heat washed over him, making him feel like he was immersed in lava.

This fiery heat contained the pure source energy of the world. As soon as it touched him, his blood began to flow faster within him, and it activated his nerves.

It was as if every drop of blood within him was jumping, as if every pore on his body was open, greedily absorbing the energy here.

“It truly is a precious land. No wonder so many people work so hard just to come here.” Long Chen could feel the energy here pouring into him. It was as if just breathing in this air was making him stronger.

After entering the passageway, he saw countless formations around him. He then seemed to see many pools with immortal qi gushing within them, but he wasn’t able to see them clearly before they vanished from his vision.

Someone led the way for him. After a long path, they arrived at the end of the passageway. There was a door here.

“This is the divine flame spirit pool. Remember, every individual has a limit to how much of the spirit pool’s essence they can absorb. If you absorb too much, you might lose your life,” warned the person leading him.

Many disciples wanted to activate more of their potential, and so they absorbed more and more of the spirit pool’s essence. However, by doing so, they surpassed the limits of their bodies and lost their lives, usually by body explosion. Such a thing was not all that rare.

Hearing this piece of information, Long Chen nodded and thanked that person. Once Long Chen entered, that person took out a formation disc and pressed on it. A sluice gate then slammed down, blocking more water from flowing into the pool.

Just as that person finished this and was about to leave, he sensed something strange behind him. As he turned back, something struck the back of his neck, and he fell unconscious.

The one who had struck him was a figure cloaked in mist. It was as if this person lacked a solid body. This figure then reached out and grabbed the formation disc. Looking at it, that figure showed a faint smile.

…

When Long Chen entered, the door closed behind him. There was a pool of water within this thirty-meter room, and mist began to rise out of it as the energy of heaven and earth gushed in.

Long Chen found that this room was a sealed place. With the door closed, he didn’t need to worry about others peeping on him. Hence, he directly took off his clothes and jumped into the water.

Long Chen let out a startled cry when he entered the water. He felt all his pores fully open and crazily absorb the energy inside the pool.

His body was like parched land absorbing all the rainwater it could. At this moment, he felt incomparably relaxed, as if he was floating in the clouds. As his body slowly changed, his 108,000 stars slowly activated.

Long Chen could vaguely feel his stars also absorbing this energy as his body absorbed it.

However, his body seemed to have priority. His 108,000 stars were only absorbing a very small portion. It seemed that the body would become full before it was the stars’ turn.

“The source energy of heaven and earth. It couldn’t be…”

Long Chen’s heart suddenly shook. His 108,000 stars had been condensed in the mortal world. Now that they were in the immortal world, they also needed to go through mortal transcendence. As his body underwent mortal transcendence, did his 108,000 stars also have to undergo mortal transcendence?

If that was the case, just how much energy would it require? Would it break the upper limit of the divine pool? If his 108,000 stars failed to absorb enough energy for mortal transcendence and he directly leaped to the Divine Flame realm, would they never be able to go through their mortal transcendence?

Upon thinking of that, Long Chen’s expression changed. He had forgotten about his 108,000 stars and been in too much of a rush. He had to first think of a way to change his 108,000 stars before condensing his divine flame.

“Senior brother, my body suddenly feels off! Let me out! I give up on this tempering!” Long Chen suddenly jumped out and pounded on the door.

This was no joke. His 108,000 stars were the foundation of his power. If a problem occurred, it would gravely impact his future potential.

However, he was shocked to find that even as the door rumbled, there was no reaction from outside.

“Hey, is anyone there?! Let me out! I’m going to die!” shouted Long Chen. At this time, he didn’t care about face.

“Little brat, you’re quite vigilant. You actually know that you’re going to die?” A sly voice suddenly rang out from outside the door. When Long Chen heard this voice, he was enraged.

“Old dog, it’s you?!”

This voice belonged to one of the former three heads of the Discipline Institute. It was the other magistrate besides Chu Huairen, and Long Chen actually still didn’t know his name.

“Brat, even if you break your throat shouting, it’s useless. This place has a formation around it. I can see you, but you can’t see me. Your voice can also only be heard by me. No matter how you shout and beg to be saved, no one will come,” said the elder.

“Old dog, you dare to harm me here. Are you not afraid of the academy investigating and executing you afterward?!” raged Long Chen.

As he shouted, he examined his surroundings, hoping to find somewhere he could break out of.

“Don’t waste your effort. This is a sealed place. The bottom of the divine pool is an earthen vein that leads to the source of the world. There is a sluice gate that you cannot pass through. Even if you did, the energy at the source of the world would kill even someone like me, let alone you. Brat, I’m honored to be able to hold your execution and watch as you die in despair. As for the investigation of the academy, don’t worry, I’ll shift all the blame to that unlucky fellow. I’ll transplant some of the memories of killing you into his soul. When the academy does a soulsearch, the ‘truth’ will come out,” laughed the elder.

Just at this moment, Long Chen felt a wild surge of energy gushing out from the bottom of the divine pool. The source energy of the world had increased several times.

At this moment, Long Chen instantly thought of a possibility and was overjoyed. But he acted terrified. “Old ghost, what are you doing?!”

“Hehe, I’m strengthening the flow of source energy so you blow up. What? Are you afraid?” laughed the elder.

Long Chen had been curious about how he had been schemed against without sensing anything. Now it seemed that this scheme posed no danger to him, which was why he hadn’t sensed it.

“Old ghost, I won’t let you do as you please!” Long Chen roared and sat outside the lake, seemingly ready to fight back.

“Idiot, do you think that you can endure it?”

The elder sneered and patted the formation disc. After that, the water rapidly rose until it filled this entire space.
