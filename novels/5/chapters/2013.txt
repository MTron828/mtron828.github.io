“Out of the way, out of the way! Are you blind?”

Long Chen sent the carriage barreling through the air in a domineering fashion, forcing aside the other experts. They angrily cursed him, but then Long Chen also got angry, cursing back, “Are you looking to die? Who dares to block the path of Man Batian? Come out and I’ll make sure your deaths are quick!”

When those disciples heard that name, their hearts shook. Although Man Batian’s fame wasn’t too great at this point, quite a few people had heard it. He was a vicious character and completely unreasonable. He would kill people at the slightest anger, hence, they had no desire to draw his ire.

Those people didn’t say a word, simply allowing Long Chen’s carriage to pass by. Only once he was gone did they start cursing him.

“Fuck, this feeling really is nice.”

Long Chen laughed. Although these people weren’t all his enemies, they definitely couldn’t be counted as friends.

“However, it seems that people like him don’t live too long!” Long Chen rubbed the rod in his hand. This had been Man Batian’s divine item. It had actually been refined from a barbarian dragon’s horn and could be activated with the strength of dragon blood. If someone else obtained it, they wouldn’t be able to use it. However, Long Chen possessed azure dragon essence blood, and the barbarian dragon wasn’t worth anything in front of the azure dragon.

“Hehe, I didn’t think things would go so smoothly. So even the heavens are blind sometimes?” Long Chen had a tablet on his waist. It had Pill Valley’s mark, and this mark had blood runes within it.

Through a soulsearch, Long Chen learned that this tablet was a way for Pill Valley to avoid others entering the Brahma secret realm. People were given two tablets. One was given back to Pill Valley after being bound with blood. Upon arriving at Pill Valley, they would check the tablets to see that their blood matched.

For someone else, wanting to sneak in like this would be courting death. But when Long Chen had slain Man Batian, he had Evilmoon extract a portion of Man Batian’s essence blood and soul. That way, even when he was examined, he could pass through easily.

It seemed that things in his life rarely went this smoothly, so Long Chen felt quite refreshed. Of course, part of that was how arrogant he could act as he blasted through the people in his path.

On his way, he ‘accidentally’ killed a few experts from the Corrupt path and Xuan Beasts by crashing into them. In the face of other people’s furious roar, he simply cursed them back and scared them away.

However, the thing that surprised him was that on his way, he sensed several powerful auras that were no weaker than Huo Lieyun and True Immortal Jiaoqi back when they had been alive.

“What is going on? How could so many powerful experts have appeared?” Long Chen couldn’t help frowning. Those experts belonged to various powers, including the ancient races, the Corrupt path, the ancient family alliance, and the Xuan Beasts. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

He also sensed a familiar air as he flew. It was the air of the Bloodkill Hall’s assassins. Their auras had been memorized by the Nine Star Hegemon Body Art, and he would sense them as soon as he was close.

However, he could only sense their general existence. He couldn’t pinpoint their exact location, meaning that the Bloodkill Hall actually had more skillful assassins aside from their three divine emissaries. Or, did this indicate that their Dong Mingyu had come?

“Fuck, how did so many unknown experts suddenly appear? Did I end up jumping into a den of wolves?”

The closer he got to Pill Valley, the more people he saw. Many of them were lone travelers with shocking auras.

One man had a grand aura. With each step, space twisted and he would reappear hundreds of miles away. It seemed he was currently practicing some kind of cultivation art.

There was another person enveloped with divine light, and it was impossible to see his face. Sword-light formed a ring behind him. The Sword Qi around him was oppressive. Just looking at him gave people a stabbing pain.

There was also someone like Long Chen being pulled by a twelfth rank Magical Beast while sitting in a carriage. The carriage blocked their aura, but when they looked over, Long Chen felt a sensation of danger.

“There’s no need to be so shocked. Just from Man Batian’s memories, you can see that there are still many sects hidden within the Martial Heaven Continent. However, they’re more low-key and haven’t revealed themselves. They’ve been secretly developing for thousands or even tens of thousands of years. They’ve avoided having to fight with others, lying in wait precisely for the current great era to come. A world naturally goes through periods of prosperity and decline. Spring goes and winter comes. When the winter comes, lifeforms hibernate so that they can come back out in spring. The Martial Heaven Continent definitely isn’t as simple as what you see. If I hadn’t felt that this place looked weak, I also wouldn’t have come here, and then I wouldn’t have encountered Yun Shang,” said Evilmoon hatefully.

After killing Evilmoon, Yun Shang had reforged its body and soul into a weapon, resulting in Yun Shang giving it the name of Dragonbone Evilmoon.

“Being with me will let you make your comeback,” guaranteed Long Chen.

“Tch, you don’t even know how you’re going to advance any further. If you don’t figure out a way, it won’t be long before you’re crushed. Just seeing your 108,000 astral spaces, I’ve given up any hope. Your cultivation technique is too monstrous.” Evilmoon didn’t have any hope for Long Chen. The Nine Star Hegemon Body Art was too difficult. However, it then suddenly said, “Actually, I do have a method for you to rapidly grow stronger without medicinal pills.”

“Really? Don’t con me.” Long Chen was delighted. Perhaps the dark evil dragon race had some divine ability that could help him.

“It’s to eat. You can eat just like Wilde, absorbing their energy with Swallow the Heavens, Devour the Earth.”

“You want me to constantly eat Magical Beasts?” Long Chen hesitated. If he couldn’t find medicinal pills, then perhaps this was his only choice.

“No, for you, eating Magical Beasts is useless.”

“Then... you want me to eat people?!”

“Yes. Swallow the Heavens, Devour the Earth was originally a technique for absorbing energy from the same source as the user. After being devoured, it will strip them of their energy and merge that energy with yours. That’s the only way for you to absorb the energy of their Yuan Spirit, essence blood, and soul-”

“Stop. That’s definitely impossible.” Long Chen interrupted Evilmoon. Eating Magical Beasts was one thing. If he had no other choice, he could accept it. But eating people was definitely unacceptable.

“You’re a hypocrite. What difference is there between killing people and eating people? The evil dragon race relies on eating each other to get stronger and survive, but your human race kills each other not because you need to but simply to satisfy your desires. Although a portion are killed due to crisis or imminent danger, the majority are only killed to satisfy your desire to subdue others. The human race kills many times more of its fellow humans than my evil dragon race eats each other,” snorted Evilmoon.

“Alright, don’t try to talk philosophy with me. I can’t accept that condition. As for why, I don’t know either, but if you really need a reason, call it instinct. As a human, I will kill to protect my family, but I won’t go devouring humans. It’s impossible.”

Long Chen shook his head, not letting Evilmoon continue this topic. Long Chen respected Evilmoon, and he knew it had good intentions, but that wasn’t something he could accept.

BOOM!

Just as they were speaking, Long Chen’s carriage shook intensely. His golden bull had actually been killed by a single punch from someone.

Startled, Long Chen looked out to see someone from the Xuan Beasts blocking his path.

That person’s entire body was covered in black fur. He also had a rod in his hand, and he pointed it at the carriage.

“Man Batian, come out and face your death!”

The disturbance here drew over many of the surrounding experts.

“The Xuan Beasts’ Xiong Tianba!” Someone let out a startled cry upon recognizing this black-furred expert.

One of the ancient family alliance’s experts said, “This Xiong Tianba is the descendant of the Great Earthen Bear King race. Legend is that the Great Earthen Bear race was so powerful in the ancient era that they were given the name of king. Their power is limitless.”

“Really? Then whose power would be greater, his or True Immortal Jiaoqi?”

That ancient family alliance expert didn’t know how to reply to that. There was no way to compare. All he knew of the Great Earthen Bear King race’s power was limited to historical records.

Someone from the ancient races said, “If the two of them were to actually fight, they should be equally matched. But in terms of pure power, this Xiong Tianba should have an edge. True Immortal Jiaoqi relied on the power of his bloodline which can be used up in the end, but Xiong Tianba’s power comes from the earth. As long as he is on the ground, his energy will never run out.”

“If he’s so powerful, why haven’t I ever heard of him?”

“Hmph, do you think that the great Xuan Beasts are like the human race, announcing themselves to the world as soon as they have the slightest bit of power? They knew how to be low-key.”

That ancient race expert’s sneer immediately caused quite a few expressions to sink.
