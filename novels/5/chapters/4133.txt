Chapter 4122: Terrifying Seven Star Battle Armor

“After all, the Nine Star Hegemon Body Art is a cultivation technique of your human race. Your Spirit Blood, Spirit Root, and Spirit Bone are not present. That’s why at present, this is your limit for the merger. If you want to fully merge them, you must first reclaim your Spirit Root, Spirit Bone, and Spirit Blood!” said the dragon expert.

Long Chen nodded. “That seems to be the case. A fifty percent merger is the limit, and any further efforts are meaningless. Let me see if I can summon the new Seven Star Battle Armor like this.”

After Long Chen formed hand seals, the six-star diagram appeared once more. The seventh star, the Violet Tower Star, slowly moved to the center of the six stars.

Long Chen tensed. If this was a failure again, then he had no idea what else he could do.

Just as Long Chen was holding his breath, the seventh star reached the center of the six stars. The next moment, all seven stars quivered.

Violent power then erupted from the seven stars, sending shockwaves that reverberated through the skies and land, accompanied by deafening detonations.

That terrifying power was not under Long Chen’s control. It directly ran rampant in every direction, like trillions of wild horses throwing off the reins and charging in different directions.

However, Long Chen’s expression was calm; this was entirely within expectations. After all, he had also encountered such a phenomenon while cultivating the Dragon Soul Body Forging Art.

Currently, he needed to look both left and right at the same time. He had to split his mind to control the power of both three-star triangles.

Furthermore, the most important part wasn’t those three-star triangles but the core of the seven star diagram.

The Violet Tower Star was constantly quivering. It was the core of the seven stars, and only when he got it under control could he master the true power of the seven stars.

With no other way, Long Chen's mind went into the Violet Tower Star. Using it as the foundation, he stabilized the six stars.

Cracks continued to spread throughout the void. However, they were slowly shrinking, showing that Long Chen was gradually gaining control.

Time passed bit by bit. One hour, two hours, four hours… It was in the twelfth hour that the seven star diagram finally stabilized itself in the air.

The two three-star triangles had merged into the six star diagram, the original Six Star Battle Armor. But now, there was another central point.

“Success!”

When Long Chen saw the complete seven star diagram, he raised his head and roared with excitement. He had finally finished the arrangement of the seven star diagram.

When Long Chen’s divine ring spun, the seven stars shone brightly. Standing in the air, he was like the heavenly ruler. As for the Violet Tower Star at the center, it was like a sacred and noble image, its light giving Long Chen a supreme appearance.

After that burst of excitement, Long Chen took a deep breath and clenched his fist. He adjusted himself so that he would be in peak condition.

“It’s time! Seven Star Battle Armor!”

With a resounding roar, the divine ring shook, causing the six stars to burst forth in luminance. Each star then shot a ray of light at the Violet Tower Star in the center. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

When the six rays of light converged in the Violet Tower Star, the starry sea behind Long Chen shook. Swiftly, the violet qi within the starry sea ignited, ablaze in an instant.

As the starry sea burned brightly, its astral energy surged toward the Violet Tower Star. In return, the Violet Tower Star channeled this astral energy toward the six stars.

BOOM!

As the seven stars merged, the impact caused Long Chen’s body to shudder, while his hair and robes fluttered. A pillar of seven-colored light then soared into the heavens, shattering the dome of the heavens.

At this moment, the entire Linglong World was dyed in seven colors. Slowly, Long Chen raised his hands, and astral light flowed around them.

All he did was slowly raise his arms, but space already quivered intensely, causing countless cracks to spread in every direction.

Long Chen felt like he was covered in the thinnest layer of ice, and the slightest movement from him could cause the ice to shatter. It felt like he could break spatial walls with a light quiver.

“What terrifying power. It’s enough to destroy an entire world.” Long Chen looked at his hands excitedly, feeling endless power raging within him. It was to the extent that he didn’t even dare to unleash a punch, because he had a feeling that if he did, it would shatter heaven and earth, breaking the Linglong World.

“Truly worthy of being the Nine Star Hegemon Body Art. You already possess such terrifying power. If you reclaim your Spirit Blood, Spirit Bone, and Spirit Root, then fully merge the Dragon Soul Body Forging Art and the Nine Star Hegemon Body Art, its power will be ten times greater,” said the dragon expert emotionally.

“Ten times stronger?!” Long Chen didn’t dare to believe it himself.

“That is a conservative estimate. After all, you have only merged with a portion of the dragon runes, so your Seven Star Battle Armor’s power is limited. Even so, it’s still astonishing. Furthermore, you are only at the ninth Heavenstage. When you reach the great circle of the Immortal King realm, the Seven Star Battle Armor’s power will definitely rise. You now have the power to protect yourself,” said the dragon expert.

“Hahaha, good! Then I can run rampant in the future!” Long Chen laughed.

Only with immense power did Long Chen feel safe. However, the dragon expert also gave Long Chen a blow to that new confidence.

Long Chen’s new Seven Star Battle Armor might possess the power to destroy heaven and earth, but there was still a certain amount of friction and rejection with the Heavenly Daos. In this state, a great deal of his power was dissipating, and he could not maintain it for long.

However, Long Chen wasn’t worried. Other than the Seven Star Battle Armor, he also had the Dragon King Battle Armor, another reliable skill. He could simply use the Dragon King Battle Armor normally.

Even without using the Seven Star Battle Armor, Long Chen felt that he would have no rival in the same realm. Thus, the dragon expert’s warning was somewhat superfluous.

After condensing the Seven Star Battle Armor, Long Chen spent two more days in the Linglong World, adjusting his condition and further perfecting the Seven Star Battle Armor.

At this time, Xia Chen and Guo Ran returned with the Dragonblood warriors. To Long Chen’s surprise, the two of them had managed to plunder thirty-seven branches of the Soaring Dragon Company, a feat that amazed even Long Chen. Their talent in plundering was perhaps not inferior to their talent in cultivation!

After Xia Chen and Guo Ran returned, they immediately got to work, constructing a grand formation around the gate and setting up all kinds of traps. They then invited experts from the Fullmoon race to watch and told them how to use the formations.

After all, the Sage King Convention was about to start, and all the Dragonblood warriors would be going to test their luck. While rankings held some significance, the real allure lay in the opportunity to fight with true experts: an occasion too precious to let slip by.

Just like that, they worked hard for the majority of the month before Xia Chen finished. Now, even if a dark domain lord came here, the Fullmoon race could activate the mechanisms to easily slay it.

As for the cost, there was no need to worry. After plundering so much, the resources could hang on for a long time. Furthermore, if the resources were used up, Guo Ran could always go out to restock at any time.

“It’s about time. Brothers, let’s go. The Sage King Convention awaits us!”

Long Chen shouted heroically, and the Dragonblood warriors responded with their own excited roars, as they had been looking forward to this moment for a long time. Long Chen then led them to the Silver Moon World. However, when they arrived, Long Chen and the others realized that something was wrong. There were a group of unexpected guests there.
