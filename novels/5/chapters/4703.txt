Chapter 4692 Torn Alive

Arcs of lightning crackled and danced across Long Chen’s skin, as the aura of a Divine Venerate surged chaotically around him.

The Heaven Earth Cauldron enveloping him had broken down, transforming into lightning runes. Fortunately, Long Chen managed to break free from its bindings in the nick of time.

After the Heaven Earth Cauldron was gone, the divine pressure of the heavenly tribulation gradually faded. All that remained were countless lightning dragons greedily devouring the lightning runes.

Now, Long Chen looked like a killing god who had just emerged from the depths of hell. His eyes bore into the souls of onlookers like black holes, capable of consuming heaven and earth. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“You dared to bully my brothers and injure my women. Do you know what kind of price you’ll have to pay?”

Long Chen's voice sliced through the air like icy daggers, sending shivers down the spines of all who heard it.

Wu Hun struggled desperately to free his fist from Long Chen's grasp, but Long Chen's grip was unyielding. His fingers were like dragon claws digging into Wu Hun’s flesh. Hence, despite his desperate efforts, Wu Hun was unable to break free from the vise-like hold.

Blood slowly dripped out of Wu Hun’s fist where Long Chen’s claws had punctured his flesh. Yet, before the blood could even touch the ground, it transformed into ethereal light, drawn back into Wu Hun by some unseen force.

“That’s...”

Although they didn’t know Wu Hun’s background, nor had they heard of the Three-Headed Heaven Devouring Beast race, they had personally witnessed Gu Yang’s Saint weapon unable to even pierce his facial skin. Hence, they knew how tough his body was.

However, Long Chen could block Wu Hun’s attack, and his fingers could even break Wu Hun’s defenses. Now, everyone had one question in their mind: just how formidable had Long Chen become?

Quivering with a mix of rage and disbelief, Wu Hun could only stand in silence. He hadn’t expected Long Chen to finish his tribulation so quickly, nor had he anticipated Long Chen to be so strong now.

“The Three-Headed Heaven Devouring Beast truly is of a noble bloodline, but such prestige is reserved solely for the pure-blooded members of their race. A half-breed traitor like yourself isn’t included.” Long Chen’s voice hissed in contempt through clenched teeth.

“Die!” Wu Hun’s face instantly twisted with rage. Each syllable felt like a poison arrow piercing his heart, fueling his murderous intent to a boiling point. With a primal roar, he unleashed his wrath and threw another ferocious fist toward Long Chen.

In response, Long Chen took a step back to avoid Wu Hun’s fist and launched a kick into Wu Hun’s armpit.

There was no technique to speak of behind this move. However, due to Long Chen’s hand sealing Wu Hun’s arm, Wu Hun had no way to dodge this attack.

BOOM!

Three-colored blood exploded as Long Chen forcibly tore Wu Hun’s arm off.

Even Wu Hun couldn’t endure the pain and let out a wretched scream.

“AH!”

For someone with a physical body as strong as Wu Hun’s, the pain of having an arm torn off was indescribable. It was an unacceptable humiliation as well.

Wu Hun’s torn-off arm transformed into smoke in Long Chen’s hands and returned to Wu Hun. In a second, his arm regrew.

This sight stunned everyone. Wu Hun had not been exaggerating at all. Even after suffering a stab through the head and a torn arm, he was still in good condition. He truly possessed an undying body.

“You damn bastard, who do you think you are to judge me?! I possess an undying, indestructible body! Other than the ten great primal chaos divine items, nothing can harm me! I know that you have the Earth Cauldron, but so what?! Of the Heaven Cauldron and Earth Cauldron, you only have the Earth Cauldron! It can’t kill me! If you have guts, just try to take it out!” shouted Wu Hun.

This revelation startled countless experts. The majority of them only knew of the Heaven Earth Cauldron, not that they were actually two cauldrons.

Only a few of them knew the secret behind the two cauldrons: the Heaven Cauldron was the killing weapon, while the Earth Cauldron gave rise to life. The two were opposites. If what Wu Hun said was true, and Long Chen only had the Earth Cauldron, then there was nothing he had to be afraid of.

“Only the true Three-Headed Heaven Devouring Beast possesses an undying body. Half-breed, I don’t believe that I can’t kill you.”

Long Chen suddenly appeared beside Wu Hun. Moving as swiftly as lightning, he sent a fist toward Wu Hun’s head.

To everyone’s astonishment, Wu Hun didn’t dodge but instead absorbed all the three-colored light around him. After that, a face appeared on both sides of his head.

Wu Hun’s aura instantly surged, and he deflected Long Chen’s fist with only his aura.

“What?!”

Both friend and foe jumped in shock when they saw this. Until this moment, Wu Hun had concealed the extent of his true strength, catching everyone off guard with his formidable prowess.

“You ants, how dare you judge the great Three-Headed race!? Who gave you that courage?! Did you think I tried to kill your companions to stop you from passing tribulation?! You’re wrong! I’m killing them so you won’t run away when I show you my ultimate form!”

Three heads now appeared on Wu Hun’s shoulders, and he finally looked a bit similar to Wu Tian.

Other than his central head, the other two heads were illusory. However, when all three heads appeared, his aura shook the very world.

These three heads could devour the heavens, the earth, and all things in between. In its domain, all things were but sustenance for its insatiable appetite. Once born, these creatures knew no death, perpetually consuming and growing. Such was the nature of the Three-Headed Heaven Devouring Beast.

“Boss!”

Seeing this scene, Guo Ran and the others were horrified. Wu Hun’s true power was beyond everyone’s expectations.

Just as they thought that Long Chen would instantly crush Wu Hun, they realized that Wu Hun had not revealed his true power all this time.

“I know that you’re a vengeful person. If I were to just attack you, you’d just run away. But if I were to kill your companions, you’d definitely come at me no matter what. So I think I’ll kill a few of them first!” Wu Hun’s three heads shouted at the same time, killing intent exploding out of him.

He shot toward the Dragonblood Legion, leaving behind afterimages in his wake. In response, a thunderous roar split the air like the voice of a dragon god.

“Scarlet Dragon Battle Armor!”
