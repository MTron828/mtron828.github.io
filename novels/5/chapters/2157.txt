Chapter 2147 Sovereign Mo Li

Long Chen’s saber missed. There was no one in the direction he was being pulled.

Shocked, Long Chen was about to unleash all his power to face some mysterious opponent, only to find that he had been pulled into a strange space.

From this strange space, he could see the tranquil state of the Martial Heaven Continent and also the countless experts of the Blood race in the Yin Yang World attacking the seal.

Most shocking of all, when he turned back, he saw a white-robed handsome man quietly looking at him.

“Sovereign!”

Long Chen couldn’t help letting out a cry. He didn’t recognize this person, but he sensed the same Sovereign air as he had from Sovereign Yun Shang. That was something that made people feel an urge to kneel in worship instinctively.

He was standing right there, and yet he also seemed to be looking at him through endless time and space. The river of time seemed to flow within his eyes, and he suddenly smiled.

“Black clothes. Interesting.” The white-robed man’s voice was very gentle.

“This little one is Long Chen. Greetings, Sovereign.” Long Chen hastily cupped his fists. He was actually talking with another Sovereign. He would be able to brag even more in the future.

“Hahaha,” the man suddenly laughed openly. Long Chen felt like his thoughts had been read and was embarrassed. The man walked forward and warmly patted his shoulder. “Junior brother Long Chen, you’re very interesting. It’s my first time seeing someone as amusing as you.”

Being called brother by a Sovereign, even Long Chen felt overwhelmed. However, he found that he couldn’t feel the Sovereign’s hand on his shoulder. It seemed that they weren’t in the same spacetime.

“Sovereign, you...” For some reason, Long Chen started to feel sad.

“Don’t call me Sovereign. I can’t accept it. After being blessed by the Martial Heaven Continent, I was unable to change the board, letting down the countless lives of the continent. My name is Mo Li, and you can call me by my name, or if you like, you can also call me big brother Mo Li.”

Hearing his name, Long Chen finally learned that he was talking to the third Sovereign from human history, Sovereign Mo Li.

Sovereign Mo Li actually wanted Long Chen to call him big brother. If others learned that, it would drive them crazy with envy.

“Big... Sovereign.” Long Chen tried, but he couldn’t make himself call him big brother. He felt like that was a blasphemy to the Sovereigns.

“It’s fine, you can get used to it later. From you, I see a different future. Although I can’t see the final result, I can see hope. Junior brother, I’m very happy to have seen you. Perhaps what I failed to accomplish, you can do,” said Sovereign Mo Li.

“Sovereign Mo Li... you shouldn’t raise me up like that. I’ll probably never be able to reach the height that you and Sovereign Yun Shang reached. You were unrivaled, with no opponents in the entire world, while I am surrounded by enemies throughout the world,” said Long Chen with a bitter smile. Sovereign Yun Shang had also once said something similar to him.

“Having no opponents in the world is good, but being surrounded by enemies throughout the world is fine too. That’s not important. What’s important is the result. We were unrivaled, but we weren’t able to accomplish our goals. Perhaps being surrounded by enemies in the world might accomplish something new,” said Sovereign Mo Li.

Just at this moment, this space shivered. Long Chen looked in the distance to see that hundreds of thousands of the Blood race’s experts had unleashed a simultaneous attack.

At the same time, Long Chen realized where he was. He was within the Sovereign seal.

Sovereign Mo Li looked at the Blood race’s experts and indifferently said, “Heaven and earth are like a board. Whether you are in or outside the board, once you are absorbed within, you become nothing more than a game piece. Why be so emotional?”

Sovereign Mo Li seemed to be giving him some pointers, but Long Chen didn’t understand. He asked, “Sovereign Mo Li, what’s the origin of this Blood race? Back when you reached your peak, why didn’t you wipe them out?”

Sovereign Mo Li smiled and looked at him. “Because I didn’t have that power.”

“I don’t believe you.”

“Hahaha...!” Sovereign Mo Li was startled at first and then laughed. “You really are interesting. It’s just a pity that we weren’t born in the same generation. It is the truth. Sovereign Yun Shang was unable to find the key to resolving the problem. He handed the problem to Sovereign Qing Xu, and Sovereign Qing Xu left the problem to me. I also couldn’t find the key, so I could only leave it for the person after me. All the way to now, the problem has yet to be resolved. So I can’t accept being called Sovereign by you. None of us were able to accomplish our mission.”

“Is it really such a difficult problem?” Long Chen was befuddled. If even the Sovereigns were unable to resolve things, then did that mean that the Blood race had even more terrifying existences within them?

“Once you reach that moment, perhaps you will understand. Different people can see the same problem in different ways. There was a lock, but five keys were unable to open it. We’re waiting for the next key,” said Mo Li, looking at Long Chen expectantly.

“Don’t look at me. I’m definitely not that key, and I don’t have the kind of nobility of the Sovereigns that cared about others. If others refuse to acknowledge me, then I’m not going to risk my life for them.” Long Chen hastily shook his hand.

The successive generations of Sovereigns had managed to win over the whole world to face the enemies from outside the continent. They had protected the entire Martial Heaven Continent and all life on it.

It could be said that the Sovereigns were the protective gods of the Martial Heaven Continent. Even the Corrupt path, the ancient races, and the Xuan Beasts didn’t dare to be the slightest bit disrespectful to the Sovereigns.

Even the geniuses of the everlasting families like Nangong Zuiyue and Beitang Rushuang worshipped the Sovereigns. That was how supreme their existence was.

They had not just protected the human race, but all life on the continent. In this world, the only ones capable of obtaining the approval of all races were the Sovereigns.

Although there were the three Emperors below the five Sovereigns, although it was said that the three of them possessed the power to challenge the Sovereigns, it was only a nod toward their power. Even the Emperors were unable to be like the Sovereigns, gaining the approval of all the lifeforms on the continent. They only gained the approval of a portion. That was the difference.

Long Chen could never become an existence like the Sovereigns, nor did he want to. He had seen Sovereign Yun Shang, and now he had seen Sovereign Mo Li. He knew he lacked the heart of the Sovereigns.

If someone messed with him, he might let them mess around if they weren’t ugly. But if he found them displeasing, he would send them flying with a slap. He wanted to live a life of freedom, and he would offer up his life for the people who loved him, but as for others? What did they have to do with him?

Sovereign Mo Li smiled and didn’t retort. He said, “Up to you. Every person has their own path. There is no right or wrong, only different conclusions. My seal has remained up until now, so it can count as having finished its mission. To be able to see you has made me very happy, but my power is running out. Do you have anything else you want to talk about?”

Long Chen was startled. Sovereign Mo Li was about to dissipate? He hastily asked, “Sovereign Mo Li, do you have any techniques you can teach me?”

If he could learn the techniques of the Sovereigns, then that would really be amazing. It was said that every Sovereign had created their own unique heaven-shaking divine art. But nothing about them had been transmitted down.

Sovereign Mo Li shook his head. “My techniques are only usable by myself. You are the same. You already have a technique on this level, and although it’s not fully developed, it will reach perfection sooner or later. If someone else wanted to learn that technique, do you think you could teach it to them?”

He already had a technique on that level? Long Chen suddenly thought of the World Extermination Flame Lotus. Would it possess the same level of power as a Sovereign’s technique once it was perfected?

“Sovereign Mo Li, do you know the origins of the Nine Star Hegemon Body Art?” asked Long Chen quickly. Sovereign Mo Li’s body was starting to fade.

“I do.”

“Then can you tell me?”

“I cannot.”

“Why?”

“I am not qualified.”

Sovereign Mo Li faded away after that. Long Chen’s expression was lifeless. Even a Sovereign was not qualified to speak of it? Was it really so exaggerated?

Long Chen found himself outside the Sovereign seal once more. He was staring into the mist ahead of him, only vaguely able to see the Sovereign seal within. It was like everything had been an illusion.

Long Chen was silent as waves battered his heart. Just what kind of origins did the Nine Star Hegemon Body Art have that even a Sovereign was unwilling to expose any of it?

Long Chen looked at the Sovereign seal and the Blood race’s experts that were attacking it.

“A single seal was able to suppress the Blood race for who knows how many millennia. The Sovereigns were truly existences that could only be looked up to.” Long Chen sighed. He had now seen three of the five Sovereigns, but rather than feeling delight at that, he was growing more worried.

“Someone’s come.”

Long Chen had taken a few steps in preparation to leave when he suddenly felt a sense of danger. Looking around, he immediately vanished.
