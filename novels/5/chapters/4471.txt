Chapter 4460 Fighting a Saint

An enormous black hole appeared in the void, directed toward the Ten Thousand Dragon Nest. A portion of the nest had been drawn to it.

“He’s trying to take the Ten Thousand Dragon Nest?!” Shocked exclamations reverberated as the audacity of this crazy idea left them stunned.

The first requirement to put something into another space was to have the power to lift it. Now, they understood why Long Chen had put so much effort. It wasn’t to use it to attack people but to put it away.

They were all dumbfounded because not even a Saint could possibly snatch the Ten Thousand Dragon Nest like this. Whether it was an astral space, a spiritual space, or any other space, they would directly explode if the Ten Thousand Dragon Nest entered it.

However, when the majority of the Ten Thousand Dragon Nest had been sucked into the black hole, people finally believed that Long Chen was intent on taking it away.

“Kill!”

Finally, the experts of the nether dragon race went crazy, and their sneers became terror. If the Ten Thousand Dragon Nest was taken away, their nether dragon race would be doomed. Without it, it would be as if their cultivation bases were crippled, and they would have to start over to build a new one.

With furious roars, they charged at Long Chen crazily, but they forgot the existence of the Dragonblood warriors.

Like an impregnable iron wall, they effortlessly intercepted the oncoming nether dragon experts. When their focus switched to defense, the nether dragon experts found that they were unable to shake the defense in the slightest.

Now reduced to less than a tenth of their initial numbers, the nether dragon experts appeared notably weak against the might of the Dragonblood Legion. They could only watch as the Ten Thousand Dragon Nest was taken away.

“Patriarch, you must come out! Otherwise, our nether dragon race will be doomed!” wailed an expert of the nether dragon race.

“Friends of the various worlds, please help our nether dragon race! We will definitely remember your favor!” shouted the vice race leader.

However, this time, no one came to their assistance. Their earlier involvement had been motivated by potential benefits: gaining favor from the nether dragon race, acquiring Long Chen’s treasures, and eliminating a potential threat from the human race. However, Long Chen’s power had broken their courage. Many of them had met miserable ends at the hands of Long Chen and the Dragonblood Legion.

Although there were still plenty of them, the strongest amongst them had mostly been slain by Long Chen. Hence, joining the fray now posed too great of a risk for them.

At this moment, the nether dragon race leader was sealed. Their awakened Doyen was beaten like a dog by Long Chen and was left in an uncertain state of life and death. Moreover, the nether dragon race’s elites had been annihilated, with less than a tenth of the original numbers remaining. Even the Ten Thousand Dragon Nest that they relied upon was being taken away. Now, the nether dragon race was not in any position to make a deal.

As a result, any promises made by the nether dragon race held little value. No one was willing to undertake the risk for the sake of their friendship.

The Ten Thousand Dragon Nest continued to be devoured, flickering and flashing as if trying to resist. However, without the nether dragon race leader, it was unable to unleash its power.

The Ten Thousand Dragon Nest was like a powerful beast caught in a cage. Despite all of its power, it couldn’t unleash it and could only be devoured.

“No!”

The nether dragon experts let out heart-rending cries. That was the foundation of the nether dragon race and their hope for the future. Without the Ten Thousand Dragon Nest, the entire nether dragon race would be doomed.

BOOM! BOOM!

Two simultaneous explosive sounds reverberated through the air. Ye Ling’s seal had finally reached its limit and exploded, while the Ten Thousand Dragon Nest was fully absorbed, causing the black hole to close.

“Hand over the Ten Thousand Dragon Nest!” the nether dragon race leader roared furiously. Despite being confined within the seal, he had observed everything transpiring with perfect clarity. As a result, his emotions had already spiraled into madness.

With his son’s fate unknown, his elites decimated, and the very foundation of their race seized, how could he not be going crazy?

“Guo Ran!”

Once the nether dragon race leader appeared, Long Chen didn’t hesitate.

Guo Ran instantly understood and appeared in front of Long Chen in a flash.

Long Chen pressed a hand on Guo Ran’s back. Following that, Gu Yang, Xia Chen, Li Qi, Song Mingyuan, and all the other Dragonblood warriors, other than Yue Zifeng, placed a hand on the back of the person in front of them.

Buzz.

Long Chen’s dragon blood energy erupted, flowing into Guo Ran’s armor like a tsunami. The rest of the Dragonblood warriors also concentrated all of their power onto Guo Ran. The next moment, Guo Ran’s armor lit up like a blazing sun.Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

All his runes, including the Jiuli immortal characters, lit up at once. He then crossed his sabers in front of him and pointed them at the nether dragon race leader.

“Dragonblood Cross Slash!”

This attack, containing all of the Dragonblood Legion’s power, smashed toward the nether dragon race leader.

“Die!” The nether dragon race leader roared and unleashed a single punch empowered by the force of a Saint.

BOOM!

Long Chen and the others were sent hurtling through the air. To their surprise, their combined might was unable to overcome the blow of a Saint.

However, the nether dragon race leader’s arm now resembled a bloody pulp. It had lost all sensation, rendering him unable to raise it.

Shock rippled through the onlookers. The fact that Long Chen and the others could inflict such damage on a Saint was almost unbelievable.

“Hand over the Ten Thousand Dragon Nest!” the nether dragon race leader bellowed. His right hand no longer listened to him, so his left hand reached for Long Chen.

Somehow, the Dragonblood warriors found that they were unable to move. Even Long Chen was taken aback, not expecting a true Saint to possess such overwhelming strength. Their combined power was unable to deal a serious injury to him.

As the nether dragon race leader closed in on Long Chen, the only recourse available to him was to take out the Earth Cauldron.

However, the Earth Cauldron was only capable of passive defense. While Long Chen wasn’t worried about blocking other divine weapons with it, an actual Saint’s attack could just pass through the Earth Cauldron and kill him.

With things having developed to this point, this was all Long Chen could do. Just as he was about to take out the Earth Cauldron, a figure descended from the heavens and appeared in front of Long Chen.

Seeing that unshakeable figure, Long Chen let out a delighted cry. “Palace master!”

Long Chen hadn’t expected the palace master to come save him at this critical moment.

The palace master then unleashed his own claw at the nether dragon race leader, his movements mirroring his opponent’s.

BOOM!

A powerful explosion shook the world. Long Chen and the others didn’t even get to see what happened before being blown away by terrifying astral winds.
