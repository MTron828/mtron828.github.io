Chapter 3352 Trap

“What happened?” asked Long Chen.

“Lately, some rumors have been running rampant due to certain people promoting them. The news of you being an underworld ghost seed has spread far and wide…” said Heaven Master Yun Yang.

Long Chen brushed it off. “Does Enpuda have no other ideas? This kind of rumor can simply be ignored.”

Long Chen knew that his heart-devil that erupted in the battle of the Heavenly Rainbow Domain and the sinister dark energy that came from his Purgatory Eyes further promoted the rumor that he was an underworld ghost seed.

With Jiang Weizhong starting the rumor and the support of countless powers behind it, quite a few people started to agree with the rumor.

The dark energy that Long Chen had displayed was the greatest proof. Explaining it was meaningless, so only time would tell.

“However, Enpuda’s scheme does not stop there…” Heaven Master Yun Yang shook his head gravely.

Heaven Master Dong Ming continued, “Due to the rumors growing more popular, the Heavenly Rainbow Domain’s experts are refuting it for you. Some people then said that these experts have been tricked by you. Even the Heavenly Rainbow Fairy was tricked by you according to them. However, due to the schemers dragging in the name of the Heavenly Rainbow Fairy, the Heavenly Rainbow Domain’s experts were infuriated, and several clashes occurred. A few Immortal Kings of the Heavenly Rainbow Domain have been slain. Just yesterday, they lost seventeen experts on the level of sect leaders…”

BANG!

Long Chen slammed his hand on the table, ashen with rage. Fortunately, the table was solid enough that it didn’t break.

“Courting death!”

Long Chen was enraged. He had underestimated the shamelessness of the Nine Underworld Hall and the Bloodkill Hall. They were borrowing these rumors to kill the chicken to warn the monkey. The Heavenly Rainbow Domain’s experts had become their target.

Using these bloody methods, they would make anyone who spoke against their rumors shut their mouths, which then allowed them to successfully turn white into black, false into true.

“Long Chen, this is very likely a trap for you,” said Bai Shishi when she saw how enraged Long Chen was.

“It’s not likely, it definitely is. They can’t touch the seventh branch academy, so they have to force me out. Prepare to move out. We’re going to the Heavenly Rainbow Domain,” said Long Chen.

“You’re going to go even though it’s a trap?!” exclaimed Bai Shishi.

“Even if it’s a trap, I have to go. Killing a portion of the Heavenly Rainbow Domain’s experts is just their first step. Their next step is to start a large-scale slaughter of the Heavenly Rainbow Domain’s experts. If they still don’t force me out, they’ll just keep killing. If I still don’t come out, they’ll say that I watched as the Heavenly Rainbow Domain’s experts died without saving them. Clearly, I must have a guilty conscience over being an ‘underworld ghost seed’. Eventually, the entire academy will be dragged into it due to harboring me, an underworld ghost seed. How can I not go?” said Long Chen.

“This… this trap is so evil!” Bai Shishi’s expression changed. She hadn’t considered this far. But now that Long Chen said this, she felt cold sweat on her back.Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

“Dean, this matter is too dangerous. We should report it to the main academy,” said an experienced elder.

“Our seventh branch academy is an independent force. We need to rely on ourselves to handle most things. After I leave, don’t worry about wasting resources. Activate the formation to its full power and hunker down to avoid them luring a tiger from the mountain in order to destroy the mountain.”

After saying that, Long Chen directly left with Bai Shishi, Bai Xiaole, Qin Feng, Qi Yu, and Xu Zixiong.

They stepped into the transportation formation and space shuddered intensely. They were directly sent to the Heavenly Rainbow Domain. However, there was no corresponding transportation formation in the Heavenly Rainbow Domain connecting to the seventh branch academy. This transportation formation had simply sent them in the right direction. With no fixed node, although they managed to reach the Heavenly Rainbow Domain, their exact location could not be accurately controlled.

The capital was still quite far. This time, they saw no auspicious rainbow light in the Heavenly Rainbow Domain. This entire domain seemed to have become dark, and there was also a strange murderous aura hanging within the air.

A golden war chariot rumbled through the air. This was Bai Shishi’s special chariot. Originally, this chariot was only lent to Bai Shishi, and it was under the academy’s control.

This golden war chariot was actually a King item. The academy permitted Bai Shishi to use it partially because Bai Shishi paid a high rent and also due to some secret special treatment.

This golden war chariot silently assisted Bai Shishi’s cultivation, but she was entirely unaware of it. She only liked it because it raised her core energy.

Before Bai Shishi’s mother departed, she had formally gifted the golden war chariot to her daughter. It was now her personal item and could be freely used.

The golden war chariot rumbled through the air like a golden shooting star. They quickly saw the city in the distance.

However, when they saw the city, killing intent exploded out of Long Chen’s eyes. Even Qin Feng, Qi Yu, and the others clenched their weapons tightly.

The once glorious city was now in a wretched state. Many of its tall buildings were destroyed, with desolation and ruins as far as the eye could see. Such a perfect city was practically in ruins. The new statue had also been smashed, and there was blood on the ground.

Long Chen was one step too late. A great battle had just occurred here. Although the corpses had been taken away, the bloodstains had yet to dry.

The golden war chariot descended upon the city with no formation stopping them. The formation had clearly been destroyed.

Within the city, they heard countless cries of agony and curses of hatred. Just a few hours ago, countless assassins had flooded the ancient city, killing their top experts. When they managed to launch a counterattack, they weren’t even able to grasp their opponent’s shadow. They could only watch as their own sect leaders and sect masters were killed by black-robed assassins. They could only witness the new statue of their goddess being destroyed. They were powerless to do anything, so countless people roared like beasts. They couldn’t even find their enemies.

They were filled with hatred. They knew that these people had to have come from the Nine Underworld Hall and the Bloodkill Hall. They wanted revenge.

When they saw Long Chen step out of the golden war chariot, countless experts knelt toward him.

“Dean Long Chen, you must get vengeance for us! Our elders, they… they…”

These experts were unable to even speak clearly through their sobbing. Countless people of virtue and great reputation, the elders that they loved, they were all killed and these people were powerless to stop it.

“This started because of me. I will definitely give the Heavenly Rainbow Domain an explanation.” Long Chen’s killing intent exploded. It seemed that he had underestimated Enpuda.

Or perhaps it should be said that he had underestimated just how despicable the Nine Underworld Hall and the Bloodkill Hall could be, as well as just how big their guts were. They truly did use any means necessary to achieve their goals, having no misgivings.

“Shameless things, come out and face your death!”

Long Chen suddenly roared. Like a god roaring, his voice was the only thing filling the nine heavens.

“Come out and face your death!”

“Come out and face your death!”

“Come out and face your death!”

His voice echoed, resounding with killing intent, but no one responded. Long Chen suddenly moved, unleashing a punch on nothing but air.

As a result, space collapsed and a qi wave erupted like a furious dragon. In the distance, space exploded. A figure that was hacking up blood was forced out of the void.
