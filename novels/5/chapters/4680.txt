Chapter 4669 Golden Bone Claw

Long Chen stood in the air, appearing unspeakably aloof, as if he was the heavenly emperor looking down at mortals who could only kowtow beneath his feet.

“Hahahaha!” Luo Changsheng laughed. “I have always been concealing my weapon, and not even my long-serving subordinates have laid eyes on it. Do you think you can get me to take it out just like that? What a joke!”

When Luo Changsheng said this, a hint of anticipation swept across the faces of the Celestial race’s experts. Indeed, they had never seen his weapon before.

The reason for this was quite shocking: those who had seen his weapon met their end right after. It was rumored that the instant Luo Changsheng unveiled his weapon, everyone in his surroundings would die. Hence, his subordinates also wanted to know about his weapon.

“How foolish. I’m warning you out of the kindness of my heart. I want to kill you, but I’m worried that you’ll die at its hands,” sneered Long Chen.

“Keep acting mysterious!” retorted Luo Changsheng. He didn’t know what “it” was, but he couldn’t stand Long Chen’s attitude. He said, “With death at hand, you still dare to spout such nonsense! I don’t know if I should admire your courage or your stupidity!”

At this moment, the heavenly tribulation thundered furiously, and countless Grand Dao runes flew around, multiplying the pressure of the tribulation instantly.

“This aura...”

The Dragonblood warriors’ eyes widened when they sensed this pressure. Following that, they heard a resplendent dragon cry echo throughout the world.

“Boss...”

All the Dragonblood warriors shifted their gaze from their enemies to Long Chen; their hearts clenched.

BOOM!

The tribulation cloud blew apart, revealing a giant dragon head. It then opened its mouth and shot a sphere of light at Long Chen.

This sphere almost encapsulated the entire tribulation land, so no one undergoing the tribulation could dodge it.

The expressions of Luo Changsheng, Yin Jiushang, Netherdragon Tianzhao, Yu Zihao, Yan Tianhua, and the others changed, as they felt an intense sensation of death from this attack.

Yan Tianhua’s bone whip curled around the top of his head, forming a circular umbrella protecting him. Meanwhile, Yu Zihao waved his hand, summoning a divine diagram that enveloped him. Beside him, Fallen Daynight’s disciple took out a pill cauldron, and its divine light surrounded him.

Yin Jiushang directly hid inside his bronze chariot, opting to forgo his white bone horse. Meanwhile, facing Long Chen directly, Luo Changsheng swiftly formed hand seals, summoning forth a giant hand that enveloped him.

Gleaming in golden hue, this hand bore no flesh and looked more like a claw than a hand. Dense runes covered the golden bone claw, which exuded an ancient and desolate aura, along with a sinister bloodthirst that made people’s souls quiver. This was a terrifying weapon that could suck up a person’s blood and soul.

Luo Changsheng had finally revealed his weapon, seemingly swallowing his own pride in the process. The others within the tribulation also took out their own divine weapons to protect themselves.

BOOM!

With an explosive sound, that sphere of light crashed into the ground, with Long Chen at its center. The impact resembled the force of a sledgehammer striking a mosquito, causing a burst of blood mist to erupt from Long Chen.

“Boss!”

The Dragonblood warriors turned pale at the sight, unable to comprehend why their boss hadn’t defended against the attack.

This was an absolutely terrifying attack that could have annihilated the Dragonblood Legion if not for the combined efforts of Bai Xiaole and the Violet Pupil Nine Tail Fox, with Long Chen’s timely reminder. Yet, when the attack targeted Long Chen himself, he made no effort to defend himself.

After this attack, Long Chen coughed up blood, his torn flesh and protruding bones shocking the onlookers. He looked extremely gruesome.

“Long Chen!”

Bai Shishi and Yu Qingxuan cried out when they saw him like this. Tears streamed down their faces as they wished they could bear the pain in his place.

The other experts, no longer displaying their previous arrogance, dispersed their defenses. Fear was evident in their eyes.

This powerful attack would have been enough to kill any of them. Their survival this time wasn’t solely thanks to their formidable divine weapons, but rather because all of them had jointly withstood a portion of this powerful attack. If faced alone, even with their divine weapons, they would have been overwhelmed and crushed by the attack.

“Hahaha, this idiot really called down a terrifying heavenly tribulation that he can’t handle himself!” Fallen Daynight’s disciple laughed upon seeing Long Chen in his terrible condition.

However, Long Chen seemed indifferent, not caring about his wounds in the slightest. He just stood there silently while maintaining his arrogant air.

Long Chen almost crumbled under that devastating attack, but he endured it. His flesh started to regenerate slowly, consuming the lightning runes left behind by the devastating attack. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Seeing this scene, Luo Changsheng’s pupils contracted as he was the first to notice what was happening. Long Chen was harnessing the power of the heavenly tribulation to reconstruct his body, and his new flesh was even stronger than before.

“Shameless pervert, the heavens will not permit such evil to exist, and neither will we! Today, I, Luo Changsheng, will take the place of the heavens to end your foul existence!” Luo Changsheng shouted righteously. As he waved his hand, a golden chain appeared it, and he sent the golden bone claw smashing toward Long Chen.

Taking advantage of Long Chen’s severe injuries, Luo Changsheng wasted no time in launching another attack.

“Despicable!” shouted the Dragonblood warriors. Indeed, Luo Changsheng was the most hateful person here—the very embodiment of a sanctimonious hypocrite.

However, Long Chen merely snorted in contempt at Luo Changsheng’s attack. With a swift hand seal, his divine ring appeared, and a blood-colored dragon claw extended out of it.

“Cloud Dragon Immolation Claw!"
