Chapter 3819 Core of the Heavenly Tomb

When Yue Xiaoqian formed hand seals, runes flowed out of her hands. After that, vast water element fluctuations appeared, and Yue Xiaoqian’s body actually became surrounded by Water Qi.

“Xiaoqian… When did you become a water element cultivator?” Long Chen stared at her in shock.

Long Chen’s impression was that the original devil race’s energy was not spiritual yuan or spiritual qi. It was simply original devil energy and was completely different from other energy. Also, he had never heard of Yue Xiaoqian being able to control water element energy.

Yue Xiaoqian smiled. “In the mortal world, the original devil race’s disciples must focus on cultivating original devil energy as a solid foundation. After ascending and igniting my divine flame, my energy underwent a second awakening. Turns out, my latent talent was in water, so now I can control water element energy.”

“Then why didn’t I see you use any water element energy when you fought Shi Yang? Were you still holding back?” asked Long Chen.

“No. Both my original devil energy and water element energy come from the same source. I can freely transform one into the other. But the water element had no effect on Shi Yang, so I only used the original devil energy to suppress him,” explained Yue Xiaoqian.

As she formed hand seals, the Water Qi in the air grew denser. Finally, the black water in the swamp slowly flowed up.

Yue Xiaoqian’s hand seals then changed and the water energy around her flowed into the black water. When the two met, Water Qi exploded.

“It even corrodes other water?!” They were all shocked by this reaction. Water and water should be able to mix, no?

However, when Yue Xiaoqian’s water energy met this black water, it was like landing on red-hot steel. A disgusting stench then appeared, causing Guo Ran to instantly feel dizzy and almost collapse.

“Close your pores!”

Long Chen shouted. This resulting explosion was toxic. If they only absorbed a small amount, it wouldn’t be fatal. But who knew whether it would continue to harm the body? It was better to be careful.

“How terrifying. Just inhaling a little bit of its vapor was enough to make me pass out.” Guo Ran was gobsmacked.

This vapor was not just the black water but also the result of Yue Xiaoqian’s water energy being evaporated. It was only contaminated with the slightest trace of the black water’s energy but already possessed such a terrifying effect. If someone were to consume the black water directly, then not even ten thousand lives would be enough to survive it.

At this moment, Yue Xiaoqian’s water energy twisted, and countless runes condensed into the form of a water dragon. It devoured a portion of the black water, turning it into a foot-wide sphere in its mouth.

A translucent membrane appeared around the black sphere of water. There were countless runes flowing within this thin membrane that tightly sealed the black water.

When this sphere of black water floated toward Guo Ran, he was too afraid to touch it. “Big sister Qingxuan, this water film of yours is secure, right?”

“Don’t worry. It’s very sturdy.” Yue Xiaoqian smiled.

Just as Guo Ran reached out to touch it, the water sphere suddenly smashed into the ground. As a result, Guo Ran screamed in fright and jumped into the sky.

However, the water sphere simply bounced back up. It bounced a few more times before just lying on the ground. Nothing happened. Looking at Guo Ran’s terrified appearance, Mo Nian and Long Chen couldn’t help laughing. Yue Xiaoqian also hadn’t expected Guo Ran to be that terrified, so she felt a bit bad.

“Damn. That’s amazing! I’m not worried anymore!” Guo Ran didn’t get angry. He excitedly held the black sphere of water.Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

“When we get back, you and Xia Chen can place a detonation talisman on it. Then you can use it as a trump card,” said Yue Xiaoqian. She continued working.

One sphere after another was extracted out of the black swamp. After two hours, over a hundred thousand such spheres had appeared. The smaller ones were only a foot thick, while the bigger ones were over ten meters.

After all, Yue Xiaoqian was being cautious and improvising. She gradually gained greater control over these water spheres.

With over a hundred thousand spheres of water gathered, the swamp was completely emptied.

Originally, Long Chen was planning on turning the primal chaos space’s black soil into receptacles for this water. However, it was much more convenient for Yue Xiaoqian to do it.

This black water looked like water, but it was actually sticky stomach acid with a terrifying corrosion ability. It was fatally toxic.

Gathering it all was equivalent to gaining a terrifying trump card. Even against an army of Supreme experts, once this black water was released, large masses of them would be annihilated.

“Such a terrifying existence also died here. Just how disastrous was the battle from back then?” After the metal mountains and black water were all gathered, looking at this empty spacious world, Mo Nian couldn’t help sighing.

This was the Heaven Swallowing Toad’s stomach. Even though it had died countless years ago, this space was still stable. From this, it could be seen just how powerful it was.

“The immemorial era’s lifeforms were nourished by primal chaos qi. Their power isn’t something that we can imagine.” Long Chen sighed along with him.

After entering the three thousand worlds, he was amazed by what he saw. He had never imagined that this world had such terrifying lifeforms. Compared to them, he was still too little.

“Let’s go. We can’t stay for too long, or Xia Chen will worry,” said Yue Xiaoqian. She was now slightly pale after gathering all the black water. That thing clearly wasn’t easy to gather.

Everyone nodded. When Guo Ran first entered this place, he had already made a marker. That was the spatial node. However, when he attacked that spatial node, he awkwardly found that no matter what he did, he was unable to break the space here.

At this moment, Yue Xiaoqian lightly swiped her finger through the air. A sharp light then came from the Fullmoon Divine Rhinoceros Horn, and a large cut appeared in the void, revealing the outside world.

“Amazing.”

This Fullmoon Divine Rhinoceros Horn was truly a divine item. Originally, Long Chen was planning on using the black dagger to break through the space here, but now there was no need to do that.

The four of them walked out of the spatial crack and saw Xia Chen in the midst of delicately gathering the teeth of the Heaven Swallowing Toad.

“How were your gains?” asked Xia Chen happily when he saw them come out safe and sound.

“Based on my luck, we naturally had huge gains! It seems that you didn’t do badly either!” Seeing Xia Chen arranging the teeth according to a certain pattern, it seemed that he had discovered something.

“Hehe, I picked up a treasure this time. A full seventy-two teeth, with every single one of them being comparable to a top grade World Domain divine item. Furthermore, they have natural formation marks. I’ve just started studying them, but they’re amazing. I feel like this set of teeth is not at all weaker than the Fullmoon Divine Rhinoceros Horn that big sister Xiaoqian found. Brother, I’m sorry, but although you discovered this thing, it’s going to me!” said Xia Chen excitedly.

Guo Ran laughed as he had gained even more. There were the metal mountains and the black acid water. When he was about to show them off to Xia Chen, Long Chen interrupted them.

“Let’s keep going. There are treasures all over. It’s a rare opportunity, so don’t waste time. There should be even more treasures deeper in.”

They continued going deeper into the heavenly tomb. However, as they continued onwards, they found no more skeletons. Strangely, it was only an endless barren wasteland.

They spent a whole day walking through this wasteland. If it weren’t for the hairpin still pointing them in one direction and the map that Mo Nian was making, they might have thought that they were going the wrong way.

Suddenly, Long Chen and Mo Nian paused. In front of them was a giant cave. This entire cave was composed of endless bones, emitting death qi from the inside.

“It seems that this is the true heavenly tomb.” Eyeing this cave, Mo Nian’s expression grew serious.
