Chapter 4292: Enraged Long Chen

This Long clan’s elder actually used Long Zhantian to threaten Long Chen, causing Long Chen to instantly explode. In all his years of fighting, Long Chen had never done anything like completely wiping out an entire family or race, but this threat caused him to lose all his rationality. If they dared to harm Long Zhantian, Long Chen would dare to destroy the entire Long clan.

“Big words! Do you think that this is a place where you can run rampant!?” shouted the patriarch.

“Do you want to try me?” Long Chen clenched his teeth, his expression dark.

“Kneel!”

The patriarch shouted, causing the entire Long clan to quiver. When all the buildings lit up, he blazed with divine light, and his aura climbed crazily.

He was innately a half-step Eternal, but due to this divine light, his aura was gradually boosted to the point where he seemed to be a true Eternal expert.

The ground beneath Long Chen’s feet shattered, as if an entire world was pressing down on him. Long Chen’s bones then creaked as though they would explode.

However, Long Chen didn’t budge and just looked at the patriarch icily. That terrifying pressure was unable to crush him.

“Using ancestral energy to become an Eternal? How boring.”

The palace master let out a single snort. With a slash of his sword, heaven and earth split apart, and the entire Long clan, the entire Arrogant Dragon Prefecture, was cut in half by this one slash of his sword.

As a result, countless buildings in the Long clan exploded, and a bottomless ditch appeared in the ground. The entire Arrogant Dragon Prefecture was cut open by one stroke of the palace master’s sword.

“The High Firmament Divine Sword!”

Blood suddenly sprayed out of the patriarch’s mouth, and the Long clan’s experts cried out in shock.

“The dean overestimated you. I thought that with your ancestral power, you would be able to become a true Eternal expert for at least a short time. I thought that I’d see the true power of an Eternal expert. But you’ve disappointed me. Does this mean that you wasted all of your resources on Long Aotian? You even used up your ancestral power?” asked the palace master coldly.

The truth was just as the palace master said. In order to nourish Long Aotian’s Spirit Blood, Spirit Root, and Spirit Bone, the Long clan had not only used an enormous amount of resources, but in order to be sure of success, they had even sacrificed their ancestral power to help Long Aotian awaken Long Zhantian’s seven-color Supreme Blood.

Also, because Long Aotian had only been in the Immortal King realm, activating his seven-color Supreme Blood had been very difficult. As a result, they had used up quite a bit of their ancestral power.

It was due to this that the patriarch could no longer reach his strongest state with the formation’s assistance. From this, it could be said that Long Aotian alone had pushed the Long clan to the point of bankruptcy. The Long clan had invested far too much in him, placing all their hopes on him. That was why they were unwilling to suddenly switch to Long Chen.

“What is the High Firmament Academy scheming?! Are you really planning on becoming mortal enemies with my Long clan?! You even mobilized the High Firmament Divine Sword!” raged the patriarch.

“It’s useless for you to shout at me. Long Chen is a branch dean of the High Firmament Academy, and I am part of the Battle God Palace. I do not interfere in matters of the academy. I am here only because I owe Long Chen a debt. Furthermore, I also wanted to see the power of an Eternal expert, so I came as Long Chen’s bodyguard. In order to repay his favor, I will do anything that Long Chen asks of me. That would include killing every person here.” The palace master suddenly smiled, revealing his teeth that flickered with a cold light. He was like a bloodthirsty beast.

“I’ll only say it once. Hand over my father, or everyone in the Long clan will die,” said Long Chen darkly.

His divine sense had swept through the Long clan, revealing Long Aotian's condition as he lay in an underground chamber like a lifeless dog. However, Long Chen did not sense his father's presence. It was possible that his father wasn't present, or he might have been concealed by a series of formations.

After all, his seven-color Supreme Blood came from his father, and it possessed a powerful bloodline resonance. Given that Long Chen could detect the residual aura in Long Aotian's body but couldn't locate his father, he was perplexed.

Everyone’s expression changed when Long Chen said this; they were enraged. Their Heavenly Divinity race, the Eternal Long clan, was actually being threatened with annihilation?

However, with Long Chen exuding overflowing killing intent and thinking of what he had done before, they knew that this fellow dared to follow through with this threat.

Long Chen stood there, glaring at the patriarch, awaiting his response.

Long Chen’s gaze was cold and firm. Although he came from the Long clan, he also hated the Long clan. He hated this tyrannical clan that lacked any emotion and only cared about profit.

Long Chen knew that such a profit-driven clan would be forced to compromise once he bared his fangs at them.

At this moment, the air seemed to solidify with tension, causing the Long clan’s experts to not dare to make a sound. It was so quiet that it was possible to hear a pin dropping.

“Someone, bring Long Zhantian here!” The family head ultimately shouted his order. As he said this, he cast a glance at the elder beside him.

This was precisely the elder that had called Long Chen a traitor and told him to hand over his Spirit Blood, Spirit Root, and Spirit Bone.

Long Chen narrowed his eyes and then demanded, “Why him?”

“Only he can enter that place. Is there a problem?” demanded the patriarch.

“It would be best if you didn’t play any games. Otherwise, I have ten thousand ways to make you live a life worse than death,” said Long Chen sinisterly.

Considering who Long Chen was, he instantly saw that something was wrong, but there was nothing he could do. His father was in their hands.

Long Chen could only warn them. He might be unafraid of anything else, but he was afraid of something happening to his father.

“Don’t judge a noble by the standards of a petty little person. Your father has always been well in the Long clan,” sneered that elder of the Long clan. He was also a half-step Eternal, but his Blood Qi had already regressed, leaving him much weaker than average half-step Eternals.

Once this elder left, the atmosphere grew tense once again. No one dared to utter a word or even make a movement. They remained frozen, resembling statues.

An hour passed before that elder returned, and this time, he wasn’t alone. There was an entire group of people with him. Among them, four people were carrying a bed, and on that bed lay an emaciated figure.

When Long Chen saw that, he clenched his fists. The individual on the bed was skin and bones, with a pale face and an extremely feeble aura. He appeared like a beggar on the brink of starvation.

What was most striking was that he was only in the Divine Flame realm. Despite wearing luxurious clothing, it was evident that the attire did not suit the rest of his condition. It seemed as though they had just dressed him in these garments, which were clearly not his own.

However, when he was brought over to Long Chen, Long Chen instantly felt a bloodline resonance that made tears well up in his eyes. This person was his biological father.

“Alright, Long Zhantian has been brought out. You can scram.” The elder impatiently shooed him.

All of a sudden, Long Chen appeared like a phantom in front of that elder. The moment Long Chen moved, the patriarch shouted and prepared to attack.

However, a sword suddenly pointed at him, making him stay still. The palace master coldly said, “Are you forcing me to start a slaughter?”

Long Chen’s hand slapped that elder’s lean face, and the immense power sent him tumbling. Half of his face caved in.

“I already warned you not to play any games! Since you don’t believe me, you will see what happens!” Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

Long Chen roared and grabbed that elder’s shoulders.

PFFT!

That elder was forcibly ripped in two by Long Chen, his blood spraying through the air.
