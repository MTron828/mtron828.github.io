Chapter 4805 Fighting the Heart-Devil

BOOM!

The white-robed Long Chen’s aura erupted, accompanied by a resounding dragon cry that echoed through the air. Dragon scales materialized, enveloping him in a protective layer.

However, his Dragon Blood Battle Armor was different from Long Chen’s. His scales were pure white, like flawless jade, untouched by the slightest blemish. A billowing white cloak trailed behind him as he advanced, his dragon blood power erupting like a volcano. With a single step, he appeared in front of Long Chen like a phantom, hurtling a fist at him.

“Scarlet Dragon Battle Armor!”

Long Chen didn’t dare to tarry. With a roar, he summoned his Scarlet Dragon Battle Armor and unleashed a fist as well.

BOOM!

Two dragon cries rang out. In the end, the impact forced Long Chen back three steps, leaving him staring at his heart-devil in disbelief. His heart-devil was standing there like a boulder, not budging an inch.

Looking at his shocked expression, his heart-devil coldly said, “Don’t you think it’s strange? You’re in control of this body, so you should be stronger than me. At the very least, we should be evenly matched.”

Long Chen didn’t respond. He knew that his heart-devil’s words were aimed at the weakest part of his heart. However, he was truly unable to comprehend this.

“You haven’t comprehended the essence of the Dragon Soul Body Forging Art. The dragon race’s divine abilities are based on the foundation of an undefeatable will. They never hesitate. Once they are set on something, they move toward it relentlessly. They do not shirk. They do not look behind them. The Forging part refers to forging the body, forging the soul, as well as forging the will through losses and successes. In this world, no one can guarantee that they will never make mistakes. Thus, making mistakes isn’t frightening. What’s frightening is not having the courage to make mistakes. But you are so afraid of doing something wrong that you’re like a tortoise hiding in its shell. Do you think you’re fit to cultivate the Dragon Soul Body Forging Art?” The white-robed Long Chen’s voice filled with indignation. All of a sudden, he spun toward Long Chen.

“Shit!” Long Chen was shocked. This was the Divine Dragon Tail Pendulum, but he hadn’t sensed any Blood Qi fluctuations before the white-robed Long Chen unleashed this attack. It was only once his leg swung out and a dragon cry rang out that Long Chen realized it. A giant dragon tail then whipped toward Long Chen, but he didn’t have the time to unleash the same move.

BOOM!

Long Chen was sent flying from the dragon tail and spat out a mouthful of blood. He felt like his bones were about to break.

Long Chen was shocked inside. He was well aware that this attack required using dragon blood power. However, the white-robed Long Chen hadn’t shown any signs of drawing out his dragon blood power before using this move; his dragon blood power simply followed his will.

The power and speed of this Divine Dragon Tail Pendulum surpassed Long Chen’s. Furthermore, the white-robed Long Chen unleashed it with no warning at all. Without his own dragon blood power protecting him, Long Chen might have been crushed flat by this one move.

“Cloud Dragon Immolation Claw!” Long Chen roared, not daring to stay on the defense. He had to take back the initiative.

BOOM!

However, Long Chen’s dragon claw was blasted apart by a simple punch.

“The Cloud Dragon Immolation Claw. The ‘immolation’ does not mean to save; it means to sacrifice. You must sacrifice blood and lives for it. This technique is not meant to nourish or teach but to slaughter. If it is unleashed, it cannot stop until it sees blood. With no desire to slaughter, how could you possibly understand the true essence of this technique?” scolded the white-robed Long Chen as he unleashed another fist.

This fist suddenly transformed into a claw as it reached Long Chen, and five fingers tore into Long Chen’s abdomen. Long Chen’s tough defenses were like paper in front of that dragon claw, and he was once more sent flying, a chunk of his flesh ripped out of his abdomen.

“Now do you understand? You are a foolish coward, and you aren’t qualified to control this body. If I were in control, I would have slaughtered everyone in front of the gate to the ninth heaven. I wouldn’t just say some shitty words that only a child would be scared of,” cursed the white-robed Long Chen.

At this moment, the bloody hole in Long Chen’s abdomen healed. The wound was quickly gone, and the shattered dragon scales also regrew. Despite all the fights and the wounds, Long Chen’s aura didn’t change at all, as if nothing had happened here.

Long Chen looked at his heart-devil and said, “You are strong, but you can’t beat me. With your rapidly falling power, you won’t outlast me.”

“Hahahahaha!” The white-robed Long Chen raised his head and laughed. “I can’t beat you? You really are more naive than I thought! Have you still not noticed?”

Long Chen stared at his heart-devil, his expression suddenly changing. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

“You’ve really disappointed me. If I didn’t warn you, you wouldn’t notice that I am nothing more than a clone,” grumbled the white-robed Long Chen while shaking his head.

“Where is your real body?!” demanded Long Chen.

“Have you forgotten? I told you that I left the Earth Cauldron to do something important.”

Long Chen’s heart sank. This terrifying heart-devil was nothing more than a clone, and his real body had gone who knows where.

“Can you tell me what you’re doing?”

With a smile on his face, the white-robed Long Chen replied, “Of course I could. After all, I’m not like you. I truly believe that trashy schemes are worthless in front of absolute power. I am constructing an energy system that belongs to me, and when this system is complete, I will possess the power to destroy the world. You don’t have that much time left. When I return, you will sink into eternal slumber. But don’t worry, I will make sure to send the image of the world being destroyed to your soul.”

Suddenly, the white-robed Long Chen vanished, leaving raging thunder and flickering lightning behind. Huo Linger and Lei Linger continued to swirl around Long Chen, helping him merge with the Heavenly Daos.

Everything that had happened just now seemed like a dream, but Long Chen knew that it was real.

“There really isn’t much time left. I can’t keep going like this. I need to get stronger.”

Long Chen suddenly raised his head. With a roar, he soared into the sky like a Kunpeng.
