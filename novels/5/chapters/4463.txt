Chapter 4452 Unrivaled Heaven Earth Cauldron

“What?!” Shocked cries rang out, and the eyes of the nether dragon experts almost flew out of their sockets.

The race leader himself was completely stunned, disbelief clouding his eyes.

The spear in Netherdragon Tianzhao’s hands was their ancestral treasure, housing the soul of a nether dragon Saint from generations past. Its power was truly extraordinary.

This was why the race leader was not worried about Netherdragon Tianzhao losing to Long Chen. He was fully confident in the outcome of this battle.

However, this Saint spear somehow exploded upon contact with the bronze cauldron, disintegrating into powder. The turn of events left everyone in a state of shock.

“Could it be…?”

“Are the rumors true?”

“Does Long Chen really possess the primal chaos divine item, the Heaven Earth Cauldron?”DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

People looked at that cauldron in disbelief. Despite Long Chen’s initial claim that he possessed the Heaven Earth Cauldron and was selling it, later revelations exposed it as a con. After that, Long Chen earned himself the title of a grand conman.

Even when Long Chen insisted that the Heaven Earth Cauldron was in his hands and was up for sale to the highest bidder, after the debacle with the Soaring Dragon Company, who would be foolish enough to fall for it a second time?

Also, who in their right mind would publicly claim that they had found the Heaven Earth Cauldron if they really had it? They would need to have something wrong with their head.

The nether dragon race, like everyone else, had heard of this incident and dismissed it as a con.

However, in a stunning turn of events, the nether dragon race’s Saint weapon was obliterated upon contact with that bronze cauldron. A formidable Saint weapon vanished into nothingness, while the bronze cauldron remained unscathed, without even the slightest mark on its surface.

“Is that the real Heaven Earth Cauldron?”

People looked at the bronze cauldron in bewilderment. If it wasn’t the Heaven Earth Cauldron, how could it effortlessly obliterate a formidable Saint weapon without sustaining the slightest damage? The question lingered in the minds of those witnessing the inexplicable feat.

BOOM!

Just as everyone was shocked by the appearance of the Heaven Earth Cauldron, Long Chen transformed into a bolt of lightning, hurtling toward Netherdragon Tianzhao. In the blink of an eye, he sent a kick into Netherdragon Tianzhao’s chest while the latter was still stunned.

Netherdragon Tianzhao reacted quite quickly, sidestepping and stamping on the air to retreat. He successfully dodged Long Chen’s follow-up attack.

However, the moment he dodged, Long Chen’s figure swayed. This kick was actually a feint. Seeing this, Netherdragon Tianzhao instantly had a bad feeling, knowing that the real attack had yet to come.

As he rapidly fell back, a figure suddenly appeared, causing his head to buzz. Long Chen had astutely anticipated his movements and positioned himself along the retreat path.

BOOM!

Long Chen’s fist collided directly with him. Netherdragon Tianzhao, in his hasty retreat, had essentially exposed his back to Long Chen. The resonating sound of bones breaking filled the air as Netherdragon Tianzhao spat out a mouthful of blood. His spine was shattered by Long Chen's force, causing him to almost bend in two.

BOOM!

Netherdragon Tianzhao suddenly transformed into an enormous nether dragon. Unable to move half of his body anymore, his giant dragon head turned back. Opening his mouth, he shot a black sphere toward Long Chen.

Long Chen, however, didn't attempt to dodge. With a casual wave of his hand, he caught the sphere. He then sneered. “You’ve already used up your dragon blood energy, yet you persist in using the dragon race’s divine abilities? Who are you trying to trick?”

With a forceful push of his hand, Long Chen directed the black sphere back into Netherdragon Tianzhao's open mouth.

BOOM!

The sphere detonated inside Netherdragon Tianzhao's mouth, eliciting a miserable scream from him.

In their previous clash over the dragon race's divine abilities, he had depleted the power of his dragon blood and had to resort to his Doyen power.

Now, with his dragon blood energy still unrecovered, his divine abilities were severely weakened. Moreover, once the sphere left his control, it should have exploded upon reaching Long Chen. However, Long Chen managed to intercept and manipulate it, erasing the feeble Spiritual Strength it carried and replacing it with his own. He then pushed it back into Netherdragon Tianzhao's mouth and triggered the detonation.

Suffering injury from his own technique was not only physically painful for Netherdragon Tianzhao but also dealt a blow to his mental state.

Utilizing his Kunpeng wings, Long Chen shot after Netherdragon Tianzhao once more. However, a sudden sense of alarm gripped him. With a quiver of his Kunpeng wings, he swiftly changed the direction of his flight.

At that very moment, a divine light pierced through the air. Had Long Chen continued on his initial trajectory, he would have been struck by that light.

“How shameless. You claimed you wouldn’t interfere before this, yet you are swallowing your own spit now. Is this the pride of the great nether dragon race? Hahaha, truly great,” sneered Long Chen.

As expected, at the critical moment, the nether dragon race leader finally intervened. After all, he couldn’t just watch as his son was slain.

Previously, the race leader refrained from intervening because he believed Netherdragon Tianzhao would emerge victorious. However, with Netherdragon Tianzhao’s repeated defeats, the race leader found himself powerless to resist any longer. He had no choice but to step in.

Long Chen’s words were like poison arrows, stabbing into the race leader’s ears. The so-called great nether dragon race had been turned into a joke, and this was no different from slapping him in the face.

When the nether dragon race arrived in full force, Long Chen had repeatedly asked them if they were here to use numbers and seniority to gang up on a junior. At the time, the nether dragon race had replied explicitly and loudly.

Now, the situation had taken a sharp turn, transforming into a resounding slap in the face. However, there was no avoiding it. While the face of the nether dragon race was important, Netherdragon Tianzhao’s life took precedence.

“Damn human, you’ve humiliated my nether dragon race multiple times. Do you really think I can’t kill you?!” roared the race leader, and he shot toward Long Chen just like that.

The nether dragon race leader’s personal assault on Long Chen left the onlookers in shock. If he wanted to save his son, it was indeed shameless but only natural. However, attacking Long Chen was simply ridiculous. An almighty Saint was targeting a little World King—did the nether dragon race no longer care about their reputation anymore?

“I already knew you were shameless. The word of a traitor simply can’t be trusted.”

Long Chen had anticipated that the nether dragon race would not sit by when he was about to kill Netherdragon Tianzhao. However, he had assumed they would only attempt to prevent him, not launch a direct attack.

Even if the nether dragon race wanted to kill him, one would expect them to handle it discreetly, rather than openly and brazenly. What about the preservation of their future and reputation?

It seemed that Long Chen had underestimated the extent of the nether dragon race’s shamelessness. Not caring about shame, their race leader directly tried to kill him.

Facing a formidable Saint head-on was an impossible task, especially in Long Chen's current state after a prolonged all-out battle. Clenching his teeth, Long Chen was about to run and settle things later, when he heard a buzz.

The sky illuminated with sacred light as a hand descended, and a snow-white shield intercepted the nether dragon race leader.

“Race leader Ye Ling?”

Long Chen was both shocked and delighted when he recognized who had come to his rescue.
