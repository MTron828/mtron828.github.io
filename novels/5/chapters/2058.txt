Ye Lingshan was also infuriated. Why was Long Chen set on insulting the people of the Dongfang family? By saying that this gift could bite, he was saying that they shouldn’t randomly accept other people’s things for fear that they would be bitten.

He indicated that the Dongfang family was not sincere. That was extremely rude. Let alone an everlasting family, even a normal sect wouldn’t accept being insulted like this.

“Stop messing around! Let’s see what’s inside.” Ye Lingshan glared at Long Chen. Afraid of anything more happening, she immediately opened the jade case.

A burst of light instantly erupted from within, making everyone jump. Ye Lingshan suddenly felt a sharp pain on her wrist. Something had bitten her, causing her to bleed.

All of a sudden, a ray of light shot out from within. Long Chen was about to grab it when Dongfang Yuyang waved his hand, and light condensed into a prison around that object.

Once trapped, people realized it was actually a jade white snow marten. It was a foot long, and white light continued to shine out of it. They couldn’t sense its aura, so they didn’t know what level of beast it was.

So there really was danger of being bitten. Qu Jianying and the disciples of the Dongfang family stared at Long Chen in shock. Long Chen had actually known what was inside.

That little snow marten suddenly smashed itself into Dongfang Yuyang’s prison, causing it to shake. The Heavenly Daos began to rumble. Its power did not lose out to an ordinary Empyrean.

“Return to your original form.” Dongfang Yuyang smiled and waved his hand. His prison forcibly compressed the snow marten.

A strange cry came from the snow marten, and it suddenly transformed into a medicinal pill. A vague image of a snow marten could be seen jumping within the pill.

“I didn’t expect the family head to actually send a precious eleventh tier medicinal pill.” Dongfang Yuyang passed the medicinal pill to Ye Lingshan.

Ye Lingshan received it. Sensing the thrumming power within it, she was stunned. This medicinal pill actually contained a shocking amount of power.

That amount of power was enough to kill an ordinary expert if it was consumed.

An eleventh tier medicinal pill was just a legend on the continent. Rumor was that all eleventh tier medicinal pills were terrifying.

“This gift is too precious. Please transmit our thanks to your family head,” said Qu Jianying.

Even for Qu Jianying, this was her first time seeing an eleventh tier medicinal pill. Such a pill was extremely precious. The Dongfang family clearly had a high opinion of the Martial Heaven Alliance, elating Qu Jianying.

“Brother Long, you actually knew what was inside? Amazing. I heard you’re also an amazing alchemist?” asked Dongfang Yuyang.

This eleventh tier medicinal pill had been sealed inside the case and isolated by a formation to make it impossible to sense it. But Long Chen had actually known from the start. Most shocking of all, he had even known that it would bite.

“I wouldn’t dare to accept such praise. It can only be said that I have some skill in that regard. This is a Star Expansion Snow Dragon Pill. The two main ingredients are the Strange Caltrop Snow Marten’s crystal core and the Rock Piercing Earth Dragon’s marrow. The Strange Caltrop Snow Marten is especially ferocious. Anything that approaches its territory will immediately face an attack, even if it’s stronger. This pill contains its will, so it’s natural that as soon as it’s open, it will bite people. There’s no suspense at all about that. I even warned you, but you refused to listen, so you can’t blame me.” Long Chen shrugged helplessly.

Ye Lingshan had managed to stop the bleeding, but there was some strange energy on the wound that gave her a fiery stinging pain. Her Heavenly Dao energy was unable to immediately heal it.

“If you clearly knew, why didn’t you help?” demanded Ye Lingshan angrily.

“I’m also afraid of being bitten,” said Long Chen innocently.

Ye Lingshan glared at him. He had definitely done this on purpose and was now acting like this was the result of not listening to a good person. He was definitely evil.

“What’s the effect of this Star Expansion Snow Dragon Pill?” asked Qu Jianying.

Even Qu Jianying was curious about eleventh tier medicinal pills. Based on the envious expressions of these disciples from the Dongfang family, this pill had to be something precious even within the Dongfang family.

“The Star Expansion Snow Dragon Pill is pretty good. This is a top tier pill that had gone through the baptism of heavenly lightning and given birth to its own spirit. The formation on the jade case has expelled its impurities and increased its medicinal effect. This pill has at least ten thousand years of history. The Star Expansion Snow Dragon Pill has the effect of allowing one’s astral space to grow a second time. If used perfectly, it’s possible to increase one’s astral space by thirty percent. As for what a thirty percent increase means, I’m sure I don’t need to elaborate further,” said Long Chen.

When it came to his knowledge about eleventh tier medicinal pills, Long Chen had obtained quite a bit of it from the Brahma Divine Palace’s inheritance orb. But that only made up for a portion of his knowledge.

After he had seen that beautiful woman in the divine spring, he gained a mass of new information. Even he wasn’t aware of some of the information he had gotten then.

It was because of that information that Long Chen could deduce what pill was inside the case even though it was fully sealed, and why he knew that once it was opened, it would definitely bite.

“This gift is too precious. Please pass on my sincerest gratitude,” said Qu Jianying once more. This gift was perfect for Ye Lingshan. To expand one’s astral space by thirty percent was a heaven-defying ability.

“Alliance head is too courteous. Although the Dongfang family has been in seclusion for many years, we had a deep relationship with the Martial Heaven Alliance. As the descendants of that generation, we have to uphold their will. I heard that the current Martial Heaven Continent has started to grow chaotic due to the various races growing arrogant with the coming of the great era. My family head sent me to say that the Martial Heaven Alliance is part of our family as well, and no matter what happens, we will stand beside the Martial Heaven Alliance,” said Dongfang Yuyang.

Hearing that, Qu Jianying was moved inside. For an everlasting family to stand beside the Martial Heaven Alliance meant that they had gained a very dependable ally.

As for the various races that Dongfang Yuyang mentioned, that was referring to the ancient races and the Xuan Beasts. Clearly, the Dongfang family was not ambiguous about what race they stood by.

“I came here to pay our respects to the alliance, but I also have to beg the alliance head for help,” said Dongfang Yuyang.

“Oh? Please, ask away,” said Qu Jianying.

“The Dongfang, Ximen, Nangong, and Beitang families have joined together with some ancient sects and powers to hold a gathering of past and present heroes on the first day of the upcoming month. The goal is to have the various geniuses have a chance to get to know each other. With the great era present, we should familiarize ourselves with each other. Every major power can send their most outstanding genius to attend. Naturally, the Martial Heaven Alliance can send sister Ye Lingshan as a representative. As for brother Long, he’s not just a supreme expert but also the founder of the Dragonblood Legion. He has to attend. These are two invitation cards.”

Dongfang Yuyang handed the two invitation cards over. “What I ask is for the alliance head to help us announce this matter. Our four everlasting families still have some face, so those who know us will definitely come. But if the information does not reach people, many old friends won’t be aware of this matter.”

“Don’t worry, I will make sure that this information is spread throughout every corner of the continent in less than a day,” said Qu Jianying. This was a minor matter for her.

“Then many thanks. Sister Lingshan, brother Long, you two definitely have to come. If you don’t, then it won’t be as fun,” said Dongfang Yuyang.

Ye Lingshan was startled to find that the invitation card was made of immortal gold. It was both tough and flexible. It was unknown which craftsman was capable of combining such contradictory properties into something so beautiful.

At first, the invitation card was blank, but once Dongfang Yuyang handed them over, Ye Lingshan and Long Chen’s names appeared on top of them.

For this kind of immortal gold, even a divine item wouldn’t be able to leave a scratch unless it was wielded by a supreme expert. But Dongfang Yuyang was able to brand their names onto it without blinking, and Ye Lingshan hadn’t even noticed how he had done it. She couldn’t help feeling a sincere admiration for the geniuses of the ancient era.

Ye Lingshan received her invitation card and thanked him. After all, to be able to attend a gathering with the geniuses of the ancient era was a great honor and a good opportunity.

However, when Dongfang Yuyang offered his invitation card to Long Chen, the latter shook his head. “Thank you for your kindness, but to tell the truth, I don’t really want to go. I have too many enemies, and my temper isn’t good. If I can’t hold back, I might start fighting with the people there, and that wouldn’t be good.”

Ye Lingshan couldn’t help feeling disappointed. If Long Chen didn’t go, then that gathering really would be less fun.

However, it was true, with Long Chen’s temper, if someone insulted him, wouldn’t he immediately slap them?

Ye Lingshan looked at Dongfang Yuyang. If Long Chen didn’t go, then she didn’t really want to go either.
