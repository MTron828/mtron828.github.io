Chapter 3626

This was a peak expert, one of Alldevil Tianye’s left and right hands. Seeing that the starry river warriors were unstoppable, he changed targets from breaking through the city to coming here.

“A group of ants is all you are. Accept your deaths! Struggling will only bring you greater pain,” announced that expert. His Blood Qi erupted, bringing with it an irresistible divine pressure.

“Fuck you, you ant! I’ll kill you!” Guo Ran roared. The battle had just started, and he couldn’t allow their morale to receive a setback right now. Otherwise, the atmosphere that Long Chen had created would vanish.

The human race’s warriors might look imposing at this moment, but compared to this endless sea of devil beasts, they were like a single leaf on top of the sea.

If they couldn’t obtain victory through a single burst of power, then it would ultimately be the human race that was wiped out here. Long Chen had already told Guo Ran that if only the two of them survived this battle, it would be the greatest humiliation of their lives. They would not have managed to lead the human race to victory.

In his rage, Guo Ran didn’t even care about anything else. He raised his saber. “Split the Heavens 2!”

This was something that Long Chen had just taught him. Through constant research, Guo Ran finally found a way to inscribe the runes onto his armor. This was his strongest trump card at the moment. Although it was supposed to be saved to protect his life at a critical moment, he couldn’t bother with that now. His full power erupted.

Guo Ran’s battle armor rumbled. Due to igniting the power of his battle armor, the speed at which this attack was unleashed was even faster than when Long Chen used it. In terms of pure killing power, it was not at all inferior to Long Chen’s attack.

“You dare to kill my brothers! I’ll go all-out against you!”

Guo Ran roared. At this moment, a man and a saber became one. This saber was filled with the resolution to either succeed or die trying. In his fury, Guo Ran finally managed to comprehend the true essence of Split the Heavens.

BOOM!

That Alldevil expert blocked with his full power, only for his spear to be shattered and his arms to be broken. He then tumbled back, hacking up blood. Guo Ran’s attack gave him a serious wound.

BANG!

Guo Ran stamped on the ground and shot after him, not giving him a chance to rest.

Unfortunately, at this moment, over ten Alldevil experts blocked Guo Ran at the same time, forcing him back.

Seeing this scene, Guo Ran was shocked and enraged. These Alldevil experts were actually so powerful. He was unable to charge through them, and this made him lose his best chance to kill that enemy.

In truth, if Guo Ran had taken a greater risk, he would have had a very high chance of killing that expert. But if he charged so deep into the enemy army like that, the Starry River Legion would lose its general. To throw the entire legion into danger just to kill a single person was definitely taboo for a general.

After failing with this attempt, Guo Ran retreated back to his troops and gave orders, organizing the battle formation.

BOOM!

But all of a sudden, a huge explosion caused the land to deform. The people fighting were thrown into the sky.

“What?!”

Whether it was the humans or the Alldevils, they were startled by this. It was like some giant beast was breaking out of the ground.

Moreover, the earth was moving like waves, and the sky was resonating with it. Two lights were clashing underground. It was those lights that were completely deforming the land.

“It’s boss Long Chen!” Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

Leng Hui and the others cried out in shock. At some point, Long Chen and Alldevil Tianye had entered the ground. When both of them unleashed their full power, they caused the earth to deform.

“What kind of power is this?!”

When they saw their power causing such a phenomenon, countless jaws dropped.

“Heavens, the Magnificent Heaven City is flowing away!” A startled cry rang out.

People hastily looked over to see that the Magnificent Heaven City was moving further and further away from the battlefield. It was wrapped in a barrier, but the world was no longer stable as the earth roiled. In other words, the Magnificent Heaven City really was ‘flowing’ away.

The nine dragon veins underground were one with the city. As long as the dragon veins remained, the city could not be broken. Hence, for such a phenomenon to occur, it could only be said that the entire land was moving. Even the nine dragon veins were flowing away along with the Magnificent Heaven City.

“Pull back the battle line! Maintain a set distance with the formation!” Guo Ran immediately gave new orders when he saw this.

The Magnificent Heaven City’s formation was their greatest barrier on this battlefield. The human race’s stock of resources within the Alldevil Star-Field were all invested in that formation. It was capable of attacking and defending. Thus, if it left, the human race would have to pay a terrifying price.

The formation was their greatest aid, possessing immense killing power as long as they had it. But they definitely couldn’t let their enemies reach it. The optimal scenario was to keep the enemies away from the barrier while still keeping them within firing range.

With the human race’s resources, they could kill as many enemies as they came. But the crux of this battle was keeping their enemies at a set distance away. Unfortunately, they could only preserve this distance by using people’s lives. So, whether it was the starry river warriors or the people in the battleships, they all knew their duty. They had to block their enemies outside the formation.

They didn’t have such high hopes of slaughtering all their enemies with this formation, so their current goal was merely to lower their enemies’ morale, cutting off their assault. It would be far too dangerous if the devil beasts reached the city.

The shifting terrain caused the city to retreat, and this turned into a blessing for the human race. They could now retreat as they fought, reducing the pressure and lowering their casualties.

As the battle line slowly retreated, the Starry River Legion’s battle formation changed, switching from offense to defense. At the rear, the battleships unleashed their full firepower, constantly shooting the enemy army in front of the Starry River Legion.

At the same time, the formation launched long-distance attacks. Rays of divine light fell as if they cost no money at all. As a result, explosions erupted within the enemy army repeatedly, and every attack brought with it a rain of blood. The earth had long since been dyed red; blood and carnage covered the land.

As Guo Ran and the others fell back, they got further and further away from Long Chen and Alldevil Tianye. Yet, both of their auras grew increasingly oppressive. Because of this, the pressure that Guo Ran and the others felt didn’t lessen in the slightest bit even as they fell back.

All they could see were two balls of divine light repeatedly clashing. Space in that area was constantly collapsing, tearing, and crumbling. As both of their Blood Qis were blazing, their clash created a zone of absolute death.

With the Minghong Saber in his hand, Long Chen pressed Alldevil Tianye. Both of their auras were crazily climbing, and their eyes were locked onto the other. Killing intent erupted out of both of them.

“Excellent. The human race has finally produced a decent opponent. This will make my trial more brilliant. I’m getting excited.” Alldevil Tianye smiled at Long Chen sinisterly, revealing a mouthful of sharp teeth. He was like a bloodthirsty beast eyeing his prey.

Devil qi swirled around him. At this moment, the roaring of an ancient beast vaguely came from his manifestation. That sound was miniscule at first, as if it came from a far-off world in the past.

However, as time passed, the sound grew louder. Now, it was like thunder roaring. No one knew just what kind of beast it was.
