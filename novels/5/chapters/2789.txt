Chapter 2778 The Dragonblood Legion Slaughters

“Scram!”

Ye Ming shouted furiously. Everyone was treating him like some soft persimmon. Now, even some brat whose name he didn’t care about dared to call him out for a fight. That was a huge insult.

Ye Ming then smashed his spear toward Guo Ran, who suddenly crossed his blades. Just at that moment, all the dragon blood manifestations behind the Dragonblood warriors lit up, and all their power poured toward Guo Ran.

After that, Guo Ran’s armor lit up brighter than the sun; all its runes were activated. This was his first time unleashing an attack of this magnitude.

“Dragonblood Cross Slash!”

A metallic voice rang out, and a giant cross shot out of Guo Ran’s blades, with the center locked onto Ye Ming.

As a result, Ye Ming’s face instantly turned green. In his fury, he had forgotten about this terrifying move from the Dragonblood Legion. They were capable of gathering the power of everyone in the Dragonblood Legion for an absolutely terrifying blow.

However, even if he recalled it now, it was already too late. He was already locked onto.

BOOM!

The giant cross thundered through the air, its power leaving a chaotic flow of space in its wake. Ye Ming was then sent flying, his arms destroyed and his body covered in cracks. He was almost killed.

Guo Ran shot after him like a bolt of lightning, wanting to take his life.

However, Gui Si appeared in his way, blocking his attack.

“Scram, you meddlesome old ghost!”

Guo Ran shouted angrily. After that, four small holes appeared on his wrist, shooting out sharp awls. At this close distance, even Gui Si couldn’t dodge in time. He only managed to avoid two of the awls and was struck in the leg and shoulder by the other two.

Those steel awls exploded once they pierced him, blasting apart Gui Si’s leg and arm.

The next moment, a sword slashed down from the heavens, and its sharp Sword Qi cut through Gui Si right down the middle.

Gu Yang’s spear then swept out, blasting apart his separated physical bodies.

In the end, Gui Si’s Yuan Spirit flew out, hastily fleeing. Back in his fight against Sovereign Zi Yang, he had his physical body destroyed just like this. Nevertheless, he was still a threat because his Yuan Spirit was stronger than his physical body. But just at this moment, a ray of light enveloped his Yuan Spirit.

The light was coming from a mirror. It was beautiful, yet it made people’s souls quiver.

The Void Mirror was an extremely mysterious existence, and Meng Qi had gone through countless tests to reach her current mastery over the Void Mirror’s power.

Gui Si was instantly trapped within the light. He struggled to break free, but he began to be pulled into the Void Mirror.

Hence, he was horrified. This light was not a power that belonged to this world. Gui Si then hastily raised his staff, and the eyes of the three skulls lit up. But at the next moment, the three skulls shattered.

It was unknown what power destroyed the staff, but whatever it was, it destroyed Gui Si’s Yuan Spirit as well. This expert that had lived to tell the tale after fighting Sovereign Zi Yang was now killed by Meng Qi.

Meng Qi stood in the air like a heavenly fairy, appearing to have transcended the coils of the mortal world. In her left hand was the Void Mirror, and her right hand was forming seals. The power of Gui Si’s Yuan Spirit and staff were sucked into the Void Mirror.

“Heavenly Soul Slave Seals!”

Meng Qi let out a cry. After that, her manifestation shuddered, and Spiritual Strength exploded like a volcano, pouring into the Void Mirror.

Gui Si’s power merged with Meng Qi’s Spiritual Strength, transforming into a rain of light. Every drop was actually a rune that flew toward the demonic beast race.

The demonic beast race’s experts were startled by this rain of light. They made moves to block it, but these runes were not actually physical entities and could not be blocked.

Moreover, they didn’t sense anything strange when the light fell on their bodies. They then stared at Meng Qi in confusion. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

However, they quickly felt that something was off. Marks began to appear on their foreheads, and they contained strange spiritual fluctuations.

“It’s slave seals!”

The demonic beast race’s experts shouted in panic when they knew what the light was. However, even as they shouted, those marks appeared in their eyes. They then pounced on the Blood race’s experts.

“Bastards, have you gone crazy?!” the Blood race’s experts shouted. Countless demonic beasts were crashing down upon them like the tide, throwing the entire battlefield into chaos.

“Kill that girl!”

Meng Qi was in control of the Void Mirror and was using it to control tens of thousands of the demonic beasts that were simply wreaking havoc.

Furthermore, the rain of light continued, and more and more demonic beasts were falling under Meng Qi’s control. Even those that had descended from a higher plane were unable to block Meng Qi’s soul art.

Meng Qi wasn’t a Sovereign or even an Emperor, so she had no transcendent power. However, the Void Mirror in her hands was a special existence. Through it, her Spiritual Strength transformed, becoming a kind of power that not even the experts of the higher plane could resist.

This moment displayed the terror of a Beast Tamer. Meng Qi had never had strong divine beasts to control, so many of her techniques were limited to only the power of a soul cultivator, burying her true potential.

However, on this battlefield, there were countless demonic beasts, and her Beast Tamer arts could reveal themselves. On her own, she gradually came to control millions of demonic beasts.

“You’re the one who will die!”

Guo Ran had no choice but to give up on Ye Ming and stop the Nine-Headed Lion from interfering. With his armor and the support of the Dragonblood warriors, he was the only one capable of facing a Sovereign.

The Nine-Headed Lion’s claw then landed on Guo Ran’s blade. Sparks flew, and they were both blown back. After that, the Nine-Headed Lion shook out his tingling hand, while Guo Ran almost coughed up blood. The Nine-Headed Lion was truly on a completely different level from Ye Ming.

Just at this moment, the void shuddered. Guo Ran then looked over to where Long Chen was, and his expression instantly changed.
