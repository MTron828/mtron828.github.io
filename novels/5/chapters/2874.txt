Chapter 2863 Acting the Pig to Eat the Tiger

“AH!”

The disciple screamed in pain when he fell into the lava. His clothes and hair were instantly ignited.

Seeing him struggle crazily, one disciple reacted quickly and tossed out a rope. “Grab on!”

The disciple then grabbed it just above his head. He was pulled out, but when he was out, everyone couldn’t help inhaling a cold breath of air. Everything below that disciple’s chest had vanished.

However, that disciple didn’t even seem to notice this. Thinking he was saved, he had an ecstatic expression. It was only when he tried to stand that he realized his predicament.

“No!”

Although he had ignited his divine flame, he didn’t have the power to regrow his body. Hence, he would quickly die.

He began to wail, but no one could save him. They could only watch as he died.

“You’re really cruel.” Long Chen shook his head and sighed sorrowfully.

“What nonsense! You’re the one who did this! How are we the cruel ones?!” cursed one disciple. The others were just as enraged. Long Chen dared to act like some good person after doing this?

“I did this. If you hadn’t interfered, he would have died within the warmth, returning to the embrace of nature. But you? You looked like you were saving him, but you were harming him, letting him see hope before once more flinging him into absolute despair. If you really wanted to help him, you shouldn’t have saved him. I even suspect that you have some deep enmity with him and were using this cruel method as revenge. Sigh, I can’t bear watching.” Long Chen turned his head away.

“Bullshit! I…” The disciple that had reacted so quickly was enraged. He had clearly saved his comrade out of the kindness of his heart. When did he ever have malicious intentions?

“AH!” That disciple suddenly screamed. The person with only half his body left had suddenly grabbed his legs and bit down on his calf, tearing off a chunk of flesh.

“Zhang Zuo, you bastard, just because I played with your girl, you treat me like this?! I won’t forgive you!” That disciple roared furiously and bit down on his leg again.

“AH! You’ve gone crazy!” Enduring the pain, Zhang Zhuo tried to push the dying disciple off. But with death in front of him, the latter erupted with all his power, refusing to let go. In just a moment, Zhang Zhuo’s leg was left a bloody mess.

Finally, the enraged Zhang Zhuo slashed that disciple’s neck. A headless corpse fell, but his head remained attached to his leg, still biting on a chunk of his flesh.

“Wow, how vicious. You even strike a friend who is on the verge of death!” Long Chen shook his head sadly.

That person peeled the head off of his leg, tearing off another piece of his flesh. Hearing Long Chen fanning the flames to the side made him explode.

“Die!”

He furiously attacked. A rope appeared in his hand and flew out like a python aiming for Long Chen’s neck.

This rope was covered in barbs. If it landed on Long Chen and he pulled, let alone a body of flesh, even rocks would be torn apart. It was an extremely rare type of weapon.

However, just as the rope was about to reach Long Chen, a hand covered in dragon scales caught it.

“As you wish.”

Long Chen pulled. As a result, that person’s body was involuntarily lifted into the air. Accompanied by countless shocked cries, he fell into the lava as well.

“Ah! Save me!”

That person cried out. He had just ignited his divine flame and couldn’t fly. Thinking of the previous disciple’s plight, he almost fainted.

Long Chen agreed and waved his hand again, pulling him out. As a result, just like the last person, only half his body returned. The rest vanished within the lava.

“Long Chen, you murderer, you won’t have a good death!” Knowing that he wasn’t long for this world, that person cried out in anger.

“You really don’t know how to talk. You were the one who asked to die. I was only doing what you wanted. Then you asked someone to save you. I pulled you back. Now what? It really is hard being a good person.” Long Chen sighed and shrugged helplessly.

“You… you… fuck your good person…”

That person actually slammed his own hand on his head after he finished cursing, killing himself.

Two inner academy disciples who had ignited their divine flames died just like that. Everyone else still didn’t even understand what was happening.

Behind him, Luo Ning and Luo Bing were delighted. Although Long Chen had yet to reveal his true power, two experts who had ignited their divine flames were toyed by him to this extent. He was definitely a true expert.

Although Luo Bing also possessed the power to fight across realms, Long Chen wasn’t even fighting right now. He was playing with them.

Chu Kuang’s side was shocked and infuriated. They had never imagined that Long Chen would appear here. Furthermore, he seemed even more frightening than the rumors.

Two of them had attacked but couldn’t even make Long Chen reveal his true power before losing their lives. Moreover, Long Chen’s calm indifference gave them chills.

Although they were all experts who had killed before, the way Long Chen killed so calmly made them afraid. For them, that kind of calm was faked. After all, no one could kill their fellow humans without feeling something.

However, Long Chen’s gaze seemed completely apathetic. It was terrifying.

“Chu Kuang, no need to probe me. You might be able to hide your power in front of others, but not me. You want to play the pig to eat the tiger? It’s meaningless. No matter how you play or fake it, in front of me, you will always be a pig.” Long Chen’s gaze gradually sharpened when he looked at Chu Kuang. Now his gaze was like a sharp sword.

In that instant, his aura began to change. This was his first time unleashing his battle intent after entering the immortal world. That was because out of everyone here, only he could see through Chu Kuang’s true power.

For Long Chen, Chu Kuang was the only expert in the same realm that was worth fighting here.

“Hmph, empty arrogance. Go kill him together.” Chu Kuang sneered and waved his hand. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

“Kill!” The inner academy disciples charged forward together.

Seeing this scene, Luo Ning and Luo Bing raised their swords, but Long Chen waved his hand at them. “The two of you don’t need to join in. Just protect yourselves.”

Long Chen stepped forward, appearing amongst those disciples like a phantom. With a slash of his sword, three weapons were shattered, and three heads flew into the air. Blood rained down.
