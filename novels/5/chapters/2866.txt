Chapter 2855 Long Chen’s Sword Dao

“Big sister Qingyun!”

Zhong Ling and Zhong Xiu hastily ran over to Mu Qingyun, checking her injuries.

“Brother San, what are you doing?! Are you trying to kill big sister Qingyun?!” demanded Zhong Ling angrily. This blow from Long Chen was too vicious. There was a thin line from Mu Qingyun’s forehead to the bridge of her nose. Drops of blood leaked out, slowly flowing down. Considering that they hadn’t even entered the Divine Flame realm, such a wound could leave a scar that wouldn’t fade.

Zhong Ling and Zhong Xiu both panicked. This was just a lesson. There was no need to go this far, was there?

“I’m fine. I was too foolish. My mind was seized, and I wasn’t even able to muster the ability to protect myself. I couldn’t even block the wind from his sword. Brother San was already merciful, or I’d have died. I, Mu Qingyun, fully submit. I’ll never question brother San again.”

Mu Qingyun shook her head shamefully. She had been feeling angry that Long Chen would say that his superficial knowledge of the Sword Dao would be enough to teach her, and she wanted to retort. She even wanted to embarrass him with this exchange. These disturbing thoughts had caused her to lack the ability to even protect herself, resulting in just the wind from his sword injuring her. Fortunately, the cut was very thin. Drops of blood leaked out, but it wouldn’t leave a scar. Long Chen had already shown mercy.

At the same time as Mu Qingyun was horrified, she was also fully convinced by his sword. Her reverence for him increased.

“Brother San, the material of your sword is greatly lacking compared to mine. Why was it able to break my sword without being damaged?” asked Mu Qingyun after dealing with her wound.

Long Chen’s sword was borrowed from one of the Elite Group’s disciples. Although those disciples all had money, Mu Qingyun’s sword was not ordinary. It was several grades higher than the sword that Long Chen was using.

It was due to this that Mu Qingyun had not expected his sword to be able to break hers. This attack of his was truly shocking. The Elite Group’s disciples were especially shocked. They had been with him the longest, but they had never seen him use such a divine technique. They felt him to be even more unfathomable.

“I truly do not specialize in the Sword Dao, but I have a brother who has a deep understanding of it. I’ve asked him about the essence of the Sword Dao, and he told me that the sword is the most common weapon in the world, but also the most mysterious. Experts who use swords are as common as grains of sand. But there are only a few who understand what the sword is. He views his sword as his master, creating countless sword arts. However, even though there are endless transformations, they all return to the source. To get stronger, you must become one with the sword in your hand. Your entire heart, entire will must be within your sword. Even if it is just a sword made of ordinary metal, it is still your life, your soul. Use your heart to awaken it. You breathe with it, your heart beats with it. Then you will have reached the first step of the Sword Dao. As for myself, I’m not a sword cultivator. I’ve tried it, but I’ve only reached the first step. I can feel the pulse of my sword, its breath, its heartbeat. It’s a very mysterious feeling. If you understand, then you understand. If you don’t understand, then you don’t. There is no explaining. Many people tell you that for cultivators, a weapon is an extension of the body. But a sword cultivator does not believe this. They believe that the sword is you. You are the sword. When you can breathe with your sword, when your hearts beat in unison, when your will becomes one with the will the sword, there will be a miraculous transformation. Even ordinary metal becomes unstoppable.”

Long Chen suddenly slashed his sword behind him. A black boulder behind him was sliced apart. This was a boulder for testing a person’s power. It was exceptionally tough. Even a hammer wouldn’t leave a single mark on it. However, his sword sliced through it like it was a vegetable.

The two parts of the testing stone shook the room they were in when they fell on the ground, proving just how heavy they were. People’s jaws dropped. They were unable to close the. The cut was smooth as glass. As for Long Chen’s sword, it wasn’t marked at all.

“Sword Qi? Isn’t that something only experts in the Divine Flame realm can achieve?” asked Li Cai.

That sword was only three feet long. But the testing stone would require several people to wrap around it. It clearly wasn’t long enough to cut through it.

“This isn’t Sword Qi. It is sword-light, an extension of the sword’s power. Because it is limited, there is no way it can compare to Sword Qi,” said Long Chen. “Sword-light is the level new initiates to the Sword Dao can achieve. Now you should understand that I wasn’t lying to you.”

“Heavens, how terrifying. If I could learn this move, wouldn’t I be unrivaled?” Zhong Ling stared in shock. What enemy could block such a terrifying attack?

“Brother San, can you teach us this move? If we learn it, we’ll definitely get first place for the upcoming divine competition.” Zhong Xiu ran over and pulled Long Chen’s sleeve excitedly.

In her excitement, she forget that he was still holding a sword. If he hadn’t put away fast enough, her leg would have been stabbed. After all, the sword-light was still present on top of it.

“Boss San, teach us this move!” Li Cai and the others’ eyes were also shining with anticipation. That attack had been truly stunning.

Long Chen shook his head. “To master the Sword Dao requires an indomitable will that does not bend, a spirit that will not give up no matter what. Amongst all of you, Mu Qingyun is the only one who barely meets the requirements. The rest of you are far too lacking. Continue training according to what I taught you. Temper your wills. Once you meet the requirements, I won’t hold back.” Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

“I’ll keep working hard!” Li Cai clenched his fist excitedly. Long Chen always kept his sword. They were filled with anticipation for that day.

Everyone else was just as excited. Long Chen was now a practically omnipotent existence to them. He was powerful and terrifying. They felt like they had only seen the tip of the iceberg when it came to him.

With this to strive for, everyone continued working hard. They were even more serious than before. They had never worked this hard before. Long Chen’s attack was just that alluring.

Long Chen brought Mu Qingyun to a corner, having her sit with her sword on her knees. She was to focus on feeling the pulse of her sword.

“Brother San, this place…” Mu Qingyun was unable to calm herself in this situation. There was Li Cai and the others shouting nearby. She was unable to feel anything that Long Chen described.

“If you can’t even calm your heart, how will you sense the will of the sword? A sword has no joy, anger, sorrow, happiness. It is not disturbed by outside forces. This is a trial for you. A sword cultivator is solitary and detached. They must be able to maintain a heart of still water at any moment, even when facing death,” said Long Chen severely.

Mu Qingyun nodded. She continued trying to feel her sword.

However, becoming a sword cultivator couldn’t possibly be so easy. Even though Mu Qingyun was extremely talented, there was no reaction even after an hour.

As for Long Chen, he had slipped away, going to the Pill Institute.
