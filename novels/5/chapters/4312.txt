Chapter 4301 Long Chen Chops His Hand

Long Chen's whole body emitted a radiant glow as the Supreme Bone re-entered him and came to rest in its original position. After that, his entire skeletal structure quivered in response.

This tiny little bone seemed to contain the power of the entire cosmos, causing countless cracks to appear on Long Chen’s entire skeleton.

Enduring the excruciating pain, Long Chen maintained his consciousness as he was determined to witness the transformation of his bones.

Fortunately, Long Zhantian had helped Long Chen complete the process of Blood Condensation by activating his Supreme Blood. Moreover, he had also imparted the culmination of his years of research on the Supreme Blood to Long Chen, transferring his entire understanding.

Having created the immortal arts and divine abilities of the seven-color Supreme Blood himself, Long Zhantian had the ability to brand them into Long Chen’s body in the form of runes. Just like that, he had passed down everything he knew to Long Chen.

On the other hand, the matter of the Supreme Bone was a path Long Chen had to navigate on his own since it was uncharted territory. The dragon expert could only help Long Chen come up with the idea, so whether or not he could truly walk this path to the end would depend on his own efforts.

Long Chen’s bones started to crack and break apart, and the pain left him feeling dizzy. He was struggling to maintain his consciousness amidst the indescribable torment, even wondering if he could endure it.

“The Long clan really is amazing. By investing most of their resources in your Supreme Bone, they have demonstrated their wisdom in funds allocation,” remarked the dragon expert, closely observing what was happening.

“How can this Supreme Bone hold so much power?!” Long Chen’s face contorted with agony.

“If this Supreme Bone were an ordinary Supreme Bone, you and your father would not have been so envied by the heavens to the point of facing such misfortune,” sighed the dragon expert.

“AHH!”

Long Chen suddenly stiffened and couldn’t suppress his scream. His Supreme Bone had forcefully shattered every bone in him, causing him to crumple to the ground like a pile of mud.

“Don’t move!” ordered the dragon expert.

Long Chen was quivering from pain. The torment was so intense that it made him want to writhe on the ground, but he still managed to cling to a hint of his rationality. Through gritted teeth, he said, “Even if I wanted to move, I can’t!”

Just then, the Supreme Bone blazed with light, and a milky white thread extended out of it, flowing through Long Chen’s skeleton.

“Do not move! The Supreme Bone is helping you completely transform your bones. This is the critical moment as any movement will cause irreparable harm!” warned the dragon expert sternly.

Long Chen was in immense pain. Just now, his bones had been shattered, and now it felt as though molten lava was coursing through them. The sensation was torturous enough to kill someone.

However, Long Chen didn’t move in the slightest. He treated it as if he had really died, allowing this white energy to slowly pour through his bones.

The pain was so intense that Long Chen lost all sense of time. After some time, the white thread had gone through every bone in his body.

“Fuck, again?!”

Long Chen’s bones were reconstructing themselves, but even this process was incredibly painful. The shattered bone fragments were mending, aided by the milky white energy flowing through the fissures.

After the bone fragments had reconnected, they bore many lingering scars that seemed to be permanent.

Finally, once the bones healed to a certain point, Long Chen breathed a sigh of relief as the pain subsided. He was soaked in sweat.

Just then, the Supreme Bone emitted another glow, and Long Chen tensed up. Once more, the excruciating pain engulfed his entire body.

“Again?!”

Long Chen felt like he was about to go crazy. The Supreme Bone’s power shattered and healed his newly mended bones once more.

In total, this process repeated nine times. After the ninth time, Long Chen finally passed out.

He had no idea how much time had passed. When he woke up, the first thing he did was look inside himself.

To his surprise, he found that his bones were no longer simply white. There were countless dense marks all over them. Moreover, every single one of those marks emitted strange fluctuations, as if they possessed limitless power.

“Bone runes?”

Long Chen was startled. Bone runes were a method used by many races to transmit their techniques, and races such as demons, beasts, and devils often utilized this type of inheritance technique. With this method, once an individual from one of those races reached a certain realm, they would automatically awaken new divine abilities.

Within the human race, people rarely produced these bone marks. Even if they did, it typically involved using an external force to inscribe the method for employing a divine ability or magical art onto a bone. This made it more convenient to unleash a divine ability.

It was a bit similar to Guo Ran’s battle armor, but the difference lay in the fact that Guo Ran applied those marks externally, while this method involved embedding the runes within the body.

However, the marks on Long Chen's bones couldn't be classified as either runes or a formation. They appeared as dense, irregular lines intersecting in what seemed like a haphazard pattern, yet there was also a peculiar sense of order within them. It was incomprehensible.

“These marks are the scars from my bones shattering, and there seems to be something within their disorderly chaos. But I can’t feel anything specific.” Long Chen clenched his fists, unable to feel any increase in power. Also, there was no change in his Blood qi, and his Supreme Bone had seemingly settled down and gone into slumber.

“Take your blade and chop your finger,” said the dragon expert.

“What? I’m not so stupid as to chop off my finger to test the strength of my bones!” Long Chen directly refused. This kind of joke wasn’t funny at all.

“Idiot. I told you to try it, so do it,” said the dragon expert impatiently.

Hearing the dragon expert's tone, Long Chen sensed the seriousness in its words. Hesitantly, he retrieved a World Domain divine item, a sharp sword, and cut his finger with it.

As a result, the skin on his finger didn’t even split open, and the sword bounced off.

“Are you joking? Take out an Eternal divine weapon,” ordered the dragon expert irritably.ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

Long Chen winced in helplessness and retrieved an Eternal battle-ax he had acquired from the battlefield. However, when he looked at its sharp edge, he couldn’t bear to slash his finger with it.

“A person’s body is precious. It is a gift from their father and mother…”

“Shut up! It’s not like I told you to chop off your head! Your bones are a bit strange now, and I don’t quite understand them. I’m merely testing to see what kind of reaction your bones will have. But if you’re afraid of losing a finger, you can try hitting your head instead!” cursed the dragon expert.

“Fine, fine! I’ll stick to a finger!” Long Chen decided not to go with that suggestion.

BANG!

The battle-ax came down on his finger with a muffled thud, causing blood to flow. This Eternal divine weapon’s sharpness went without saying.

“Can you hurry up? It only struck your dragon tendons, and this kind of power is unable to slice them. You aren’t reaching your bones like this!”

Frustrated by the repeated scolding, Long Chen's temper flared, and he swung the battle-ax at the cut once more.

BOOM!

The moment the battle-ax struck his bone, the marks on Long Chen’s skeleton lit up. Following that, the battle-ax escaped his hold and blasted a hole through the roof.

“What?!”

Long Chen himself was dumbfounded by this result.
