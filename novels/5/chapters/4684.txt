Chapter 4673 What is All This Crap?

This monstrous expert was as strong as the other heavenly geniuses, capable of slaying the little lightning dragons easily, but the Sovereign clan expert had killed him in a snap.

“What...?!” Xia Chen’s eyes almost popped out of his head. He had been keeping an eye on the entire battlefield, and nothing could escape his observation, whether it was inside or outside the tribulation.

Xia Chen had been monitoring this monstrous expert for a while. Amongst all the people undergoing the tribulation, he was definitely above average. But of course, Xia Chen couldn’t ascertain if any of them were masking their true strength.

In any case, that monstrous expert had revealed immense power and confidence so far. Otherwise, he wouldn’t have dared to approach the Sovereign clan expert.

According to Xia Chen’s estimations, this fellow should have been holding back quite a bit. Perhaps he planned on launching a sneak attack but still held back a bit, so even if he didn’t succeed, he would be able to escape easily.

However, as soon as he approached the Sovereign clan expert, he stiffened, his body no longer listening to him. In the end, he could only watch as the Sovereign clan expert’s spear killed him, his eyes full of unwillingness and fear.

“We were very lucky to have beaten him back then!” Guo Ran couldn’t help sighing.

“Yeah, back then, his true body and manifestation didn’t merge, and we managed to draw his manifestation against his true body. After losing the true body, the manifestation rapidly weakened, and that’s how we managed to beat him,” explained Yue Zifeng as he nodded.

Seeing how powerful the Sovereign clan expert was, Yue Zifeng felt a bout of disappointment. He wished he could fight such a peerless expert. And even if he died because of it, he’d be willing.

Oddly enough, the stronger the genius, the more fanatical they were. Challenging stronger and stronger opponents became their life’s purpose. Thinking about this, Yue Zifeng felt a sense of loss.

Suddenly, all the lightning dragons stopped attacking. Like the tide, they retreated back to the Sovereign clan expert.

At some point, the giant dragon beneath his feet had appeared behind him, forming a dragon ring totem. All the lightning dragons swirled and surged into that totem.

As the influx of lightning dragons continued, the figure of the Sovereign clan expert gradually solidified. It was as if he was transitioning from an imitation created by the heavenly tribulation to the real deal. His eyes sparked with life, exuding a majestic Sovereign qi.

Suddenly, the sky above him split open, and a torrent of lightning enveloped everyone.

“This is the blood sea from the Ten Thousand Dragon Nest!”

The Dragonblood warriors let out startled cries. Having cultivated within this blood sea, they were all too familiar with its fluctuations. The heavenly tribulation had even replicated this environment.

As the torrent of lightning struck everyone in the tribulation, all the experts were involuntarily dragged apart, swept away by the current, including Luo Changsheng and the others.

This sudden change caught everyone off-guard, and they had no idea what was happening. Even these monstrous experts had never encountered such a heavenly tribulation before.

Everyone was battered by the sea of lightning, powerful currents crashing into them. Yet, amidst the chaos, Long Chen and the Sovereign clan expert stood unwavering like the gods of this sea, not dragged by the raging waves around them.

“It seems my wish can be fulfilled,” said the Sovereign clan expert. Hearing this, everyone was shocked, including the Dragonblood warriors. Everyone knew that everything within the heavenly tribulation was an imitation created by the Heavenly Daos, but this Sovereign clan expert actually possessed his own will. This was alarming for them.

“I also get my wish.” Long Chen’s gaze was full of anticipation, as well as a hint of excitement.

Long Chen had anticipated encountering the Sovereign clan expert in his tribulation. However, Long Chen hadn’t expected him to be so terrifying. Despite only a trace of his soul essence lingering in this era, he managed to imprint his will onto the heavenly tribulation.

When the Heavenly Daos replicated him, he borrowed the power of the Heavenly Daos to revive. Remarkably, his will surpassed even that of the Heavenly Daos.

During their last fight, due to lacking a physical body and only possessing a trace of his soul, the Sovereign clan expert had no way to truly fight Long Chen in the same realm. Even with the power of the Ten Thousand Dragon Nest, he lacked core energy, so he was unable to use many powerful divine abilities. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

His inability to fight against Long Chen in the same realm was one of his last regrets. In the same vein, Long Chen also thirsted for a battle with a true expert.

“What is all this crap?” asked the Sovereign clan expert, frowning at the sight of other experts caught within the lightning sea.

“A group of small fries,” replied Long Chen with a smile.

“With the Heavenly Daos replicating me, my will is in control over the entire tribulation’s power. Do you want me to eliminate these small fries before our battle?”

Hearing that, Luo Changsheng, Netherdragon Tianzhao, Yin Jiushang, Yu Zihao, and the others paled instantly.

When Netherdragon Tianzhao saw the Sovereign clan expert, his soul and body quivered. An overwhelming fear surged within him, beyond his ability to contain.

The blood of the Netherdragon race coursing through his veins quivered in terror. Although the Netherdragon race was extremely powerful, they couldn’t possibly compare to the Sovereign clan. They were nothing more than subjects in front of the emperor.

Although Luo Changsheng and the others didn’t know about the Sovereign clan, they could all sense an immense threat from this expert. When the Sovereign clan expert spoke, the tribulation clearly echoed his voice, and the entire world followed his will. From these signs, they knew he was now the master of the heavenly tribulation. Perhaps he really did have the power to kill whoever he wanted here.

All of them gritted their teeth, accumulating power and circulating their qi so that they could erupt with all of their might at any moment.

When the Sovereign clan expert attacked, they couldn’t hold back in the slightest. Just as everyone was holding their breath, Guo Ran’s arrogant voice rang out.

“There’s such a good thing? Boss, have senior kill everyone! Ah, with the exception of us of course!”
