Chapter 3752 Calligraphy Sect’s Li Chenggang

“Jiang Lei!”

Long Chen shouted emotionally when he saw that long-haired man. He was a Dragonblood warrior.

He was one of the very rare warriors in the Dragonblood Legion with lightning affinity. Who would have thought that Long Chen would run into him here?

Suddenly, the four half-step Divine Venerates standing guard over the transportation formation attacked at the same time.

Enraged, Long Chen appeared right in front of Jiang Lei in an instant. His Minghong Saber slashed out.

As a result, a heaven-shaking explosion erupted and a giant ditch was left in the ground. Those four half-step Divine Venerates all coughed up blood and were blown back.

They were truly unlucky. Long Chen had previously blown them back, and now they even coughed up blood.

After that attack, Long Chen was surprised. He looked back at a certain person.

It was a slim man with a square face. He had bushy eyebrows and large eyes, wearing a scholar’s cap and blue robes. He was carrying a large scroll on his back.

Looking closely at the scroll, Long Chen seemed to see strange characters written on it. It seemed to be an extremely ancient scroll.Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Also, despite overflowing with the air of a scholar, this man’s expression was strong. He didn’t look like a weak scholar. It was a very curious feeling.

“Boss!”

Jiang Lei had killed people in front of the city. After that, he had assumed that he was going to die against the four half-step Divine Venerates and was thinking of dragging one down with him in death. But unexpectedly, Long Chen came.

Long Chen patted Jiang Lei’s shoulder and then turned to the scholar. “I am Long Chen. Thank you for saving my brother.”

Jiang Lei was startled. He thought that it was Long Chen who had saved him. He hadn’t expected that it was someone else.

Even before Long Chen’s saber landed, he already saw a character appear in the void. That character then exploded, knocking the four of them back and making Long Chen’s saber miss its target.

At that time, Long Chen was truly shocked. That character looked completely unremarkable, but when it exploded, it unleashed heaven-shaking power. Even four half-step Divine Venerates were unable to resist it.

However, this person carefully chose the appropriate amount of power to use. He only sought to knock the four of them back and save Jiang Lei. The four were only injured and coughed up blood because of Long Chen’s Saber Qi that passed by them.

“Long Chen? The youngest dean in all the High Firmament Academy’s history?” asked the scholar, feeling surprised.

“Yes, I’m ashamed to say that I am. May I ask for your name?” Long Chen cupped his fists. He hadn’t expected this person to know his name.

The scholar returned the courtesy. “I am Li Chenggang. I come from the Calligraphy Sect. Greetings, dean Long Chen.”

“The Calligraphy Sect?”

Now it was Long Chen’s turn to be shocked. It wasn’t just Long Chen. Even the other experts jumped in shock. The Divine Venerates that were rushing over furiously were also stunned.

The four immemorial sects. They had the major inheritances of the four arts: the zither, chess, calligraphy, and painting. They existed beyond the rest of the world. Others rarely even saw their head or tail, and they were extremely mysterious. People didn’t even know where their sects were located.

The four immemorial sects’ experts rarely appeared. Only their disciples occasionally roamed the world to gain experience, but even those disciples were rarely seen.

The disciples roaming the world seldom caused conflict with others, nor would they provoke any trouble. Thus, people rarely saw their disciples fight.

Although no one knew where the four immemorial sects were located, and despite not knowing just how powerful they were, no one dared to provoke their disciples.

Their disciples rarely caused trouble. But if anyone dared to make things hard on them, they wouldn’t have a good ending. That was because once, some sects had refused to believe these rumors and killed a disciple of the Zither Sect.

In less than three days, their entire sects were wiped out. Millions of disciples, and seven Divine Venerates, all died within their sects.

Most terrifying of all, once these people were dead, there was no sign of how they had died. It was like their lives had simply been stripped of them in an instant. They were powerless to resist.

Even Divine Venerates hadn’t shown any sign of resistance. That had caused a huge uproar back then. Throughout the nine heavens and ten lands, and even in other places, all kinds of stories spread. In any case, anyone who dared to make things hard on the disciples of the four immemorial sects would not have a good ending.

This was also why people were shocked by Li Chenggang’s origin. The Divine Venerates who were rushing over to punish him were at a loss.

“So you’re from the illustrious Calligraphy Sect. No wonder you have such skill. Admirable.” Long Chen once more cupped his fists.

Li Chenggang smiled slightly. “Compared to the illustrious High Firmament Academy, our Calligraphy Sect can’t count for anything. My master once told me that the Jiuli Original Text can only be found within the High Firmament Academy. It is said that the Jiuli race’s experts personally wrote it, and first generation Jiuli characters are written on it. I have long since wished to pay a visit to have a look. However, I felt like it would be rude to suddenly demand such a thing, so I’ve never gone. If I have a chance, I will be so rude as to come pay a visit. I hope dean Long Chen won’t mind sharing his knowledge.”

Jiuli Original Text? Long Chen had never heard of it. But if this was coming from the mouth of Li Chenggang, it should be true. It seemed that he truly did understand too little about the High Firmament Academy.

Long Chen smiled. “If brother Li comes, I will naturally welcome you. However, I am only a branch dean. I can’t guarantee anything about the main academy. But if brother Li personally comes to the academy, that will show your sincerity. I trust that the great dean will not disappoint you.”

When it came to the academy’s affairs, Long Chen didn’t know that much. Thus, he didn’t dare to rashly promise such a thing. He didn’t want to end up breaking that promise in the future.

“Alright, then if I have a chance, I will definitely take the chance to study at the High Firmament Academy. Even if I can’t see the Jiuli Original Text, just seeing the world’s number one academy would be worth it.” Li Chenggang smiled.

After saying that, he turned to the Divine Venerates. “Seniors, my Calligraphy Sect doesn’t like to meddle in other people’s affairs. But these people truly went too far. If you are to insult people, you shouldn’t bring up their parents. If you are to incite hatred, do not bring up a person’s wife and children. A person should have some respect.”

“What does that mean?” demanded one Divine Venerate coldly. He had a pair of wings and powerful Blood Qi. He was a demonic beast. As for the people that Jiang Lei had just killed, they were from the demonic beast race.

“Simply that people should not go too far. Don’t bully people too badly,” responded Li Chenggang lightly. Even in front of a Divine Venerate, he wasn’t the slightest bit afraid.

“And if I insist on going too far?” demanded that Divine Venerate.

Clearly, this Divine Venerate didn’t have much of an understanding of the four immemorial sects. He didn’t dare to provoke Long Chen, but it seemed that he wanted to test Li Chenggang.

Furthermore, the other Divine Venerates simply watched on. They looked at that demonic beast oddly but didn’t say anything.

People had only heard rumors of the four immemorial sects. What they knew about them was limited to legend. As for whether the four immemorial sects were truly as terrifying as the legends said, no one knew. Since this Divine Venerate wanted to test one of their disciples, they also wanted to see the truth.

“If you insist on it, I suppose that I’ll have no choice but to talk reason with you.” Li Chenggang snorted. His robes began to flutter despite the lack of wind. His scroll slowly opened. After that, an ancient desolate qi filled the world.
