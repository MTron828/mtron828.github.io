Chapter 3750 Ice Soul Displays Power

These devil experts were horrified as Long Chen was too powerful. He didn’t even care what this place was and immediately started killing.

The three Supreme experts had yet to enter their combat state. They barely had time to summon their divine weapons before Long Chen’s saber struck them.

“Split the Heavens 3!”

BOOM!

The saber slashed down, shattering the ten thousand Daos. As a result, the three of their weapons shattered along with them. All of them were wiped out.

The Minghong Saber rumbled like an ancient beast awakening. Its aura grew even stronger.

Even the shattered runes of the divine weapons were devoured by it. It used those runes to strengthen itself.

One man and saber, both erupting with overwhelming killing intent. Long Chen’s expression was gloomy. He was enraged.𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Giant Peak City was like this, and this Seven Star City was the same. The human race had truly fallen. The human race’s depravity stemmed from their hearts. It was a decay of the spirit.

Other races were united, helping each other. Only the human race never ceased to fight amongst themselves, harming themselves while ingratiating themselves with other races.

He could not understand how the human race had become like this. Long Chen gradually understood why Xia Guhong had warned him to be wary of his own race before entering the three thousand worlds.

Normal enemies weren’t to be feared. It was the enemies that couldn’t be seen that were truly frightening. Furthermore, even more frightening than the invisible enemies were the comrades that you thought you could trust.

As a human, seeing the human race in this state enraged and aggrieved Long Chen. Looking at them, Long Chen felt like some long-lost memories were being dredged up.

“Human, you’re courting death!”

A violent pressure suddenly crashed down on Seven Star City. Devil qi covered the sky. A Divine Venerate of the devil race had come.

If Long Chen killed humans, he wouldn’t bother. But to kill members of the devil race here was a provocation to the devil race. As soon as he appeared, several Divine Venerates appeared within the city.

“Friend of the devil race, calm your anger. Violence cannot solve everything. Don’t make things hard on us.”

There were three human Divine Venerates who came out. Their expressions were solemn. They blocked the devil expert’s path but also blocked Long Chen’s path of retreat. They surrounded Long Chen.

“Your human race is quite brazen! You dare to kill my devil race’s people in front of everyone? Do you think my devil race is easy to bully?!” shouted the devil Divine Venerate.

“Friend, calm yourself. We will give an explanation to your devil race for this matter,” said one elder of the human race politely.

However, when he turned to look at Long Chen, that polite expression completely vanished, replaced with an icy sharpness.

“You broke the rules of my Seven Star City. I don’t care what heaven you're from, who your master is, or what’s your background. Now that you are in the three thousand worlds, you have to follow the rules of the three thousand worlds. For you to have killed people in front of me, are you going to force me to make you kneel? Or will you do it yourself?” 

“Rules? Hahaha!”

Long Chen raised his head and laughed. “Right, you’re one hundred percent right! There need to be rules! But in the future, everything within the nine heavens and ten lands will follow my rules!”

Long Chen’s Minghong Saber, seemingly affected by Long Chen’s immense killing intent, was excited. It seemed to want to taste the blood of Divine Venerates.

“Little fellow, you don’t know how high the heavens are. You dare to resist?”

The human Divine Venerates became gloomy. They didn’t want to take action in this place because they didn’t want to damage the city. That was why they stopped that devil expert.

Suddenly, the three of them tightened their encirclement around Long Chen. Divine light lit up behind their heads, and an invisible divine pressure crashed down on Long Chen like a tsunami.

Long Chen’s body sank. After that, his bones began to creak, and cracks spread on the ground beneath his feet.

“The pressure of Divine Venerates!”

The three of them didn’t want to fight. They just wanted to use this pressure to subdue Long Chen. This pressure contained three Divine Venerates’ unquestionable will. Anyone who dared to resist would have their soul directly crushed.

If it was a single Divine Venerate’s pressure, as a Supreme heavenly genius, perhaps they would be able to escape the lock of the other side. But for three to activate it at once, it was essentially an unbreakable net. 

The space around Long Chen condensed and this terrifying pressure formed an invisible tempest around him. They were trying to use their wills to crush him.

Long Chen was enraged. Even these Divine Venerates were submitting to the devil race. Were all the humans within the three thousand worlds so gutless?

Competing in terms of will? Long Chen had never been afraid of anyone in that regard. But in terms of power, if he were to fight them head-on, he would definitely die.

However, despite knowing that he shouldn’t have provoked them, when his anger soared, he couldn’t control himself. In fact, the will of the Pill Sovereign deep within him did not permit him to retreat.

Long Chen then clenched the Minghong Saber. His 108,000 stars quivered and endless power gushed out.

Just as Long Chen was preparing to fight to his death, a figure appeared behind Long Chen. It was a peerless beauty, the white-robed Ice Soul, Bing Po.

Once she appeared, ice spread from her, covering the ground.

The three Divine Venerates’ expressions instantly changed. They hastily fell back. At the same time, mist swirled out of their heads. It was like a burning furnace was suddenly covered in ice.

Once Bing Po appeared, the three leaders that were using their wills to suppress Long Chen felt a sharp pain in their souls. They were injured by the will of the Ice Soul.

Fortunately, they quickly retreated upon seeing this. Otherwise, the consequences would be unrecoverable. They stared in shock at her.

“Who are you?!” shouted one of the Divine Venerates.

They couldn’t sense Bing Po’s aura. However, they sensed a mortal threat from her. Just looking at her made their souls feel uneasy.

“You aren’t qualified to ask about my origins. If you want to die, just come.” Bing Po’s gaze swept over the crowd coldly.

Those Divine Venerates felt like their souls were about to freeze when her gaze fell on them. They were horrified. They were unable to see through this white-robed woman.

“Bing Po, help me out. Kill them all,” transmitted Long Chen darkly.

“Impossible. I’m in an incredibly weak state right now. At most, I can scare them with my will. If they attack, I’ll be exposed. Hurry up and think of a way to leave. I am not a match for them in my current state. Don’t do anything stupid,” responded Bing Po.

Long Chen clenched the Minghong Saber. He glared at the three Divine Venerates of the human race, as well as the devil race’s experts.

“The human race’s face has been completely lost by you. You’ve forgotten history and the sea of blood enmity. Forgetting the past is equivalent to betrayal. You’ve betrayed the human race. I, Long Chen, hereby swear that the day I reach the peak, I will clean up all of you traitors.”

After saying that, Long Chen walked toward the gate just like that. Bing Po stayed behind him, walking elegantly. Ice crystals appeared on the ground where she walked. But after a moment of cold, white flames burst into existence. Countless people were shocked and didn’t dare to stop them. Long Chen swaggered into the city just like that.
