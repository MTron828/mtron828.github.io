Chapter 4865 Gamble

“Do you really have a method?” Xing Wujiang stared at Mo Nian in disbelief.

At this moment, Long Chen perked up. Although Mo Nian was normally flaky, he was definitely reliable when it came to important matters.

“To tell the truth, I’m after the devil corpse in Heaven Screen Mountain. As long as I obtain the corpse, the Square Heaven Seal won’t be able to absorb it. Wouldn’t the problem be solved then?” said Mo Nian.

“But can you take the corpse before the Square Heaven Seal does?” asked Xing Wujiang.

“You said it yourself. The Square Heaven Seal has to exhaust its power to open Heaven Screen Mountain. When it enters a weakened state, it won’t be able to immediately take it. I’m confident I can get to the corpse before it. I’ve already seen the corpse, and it has an arrow with Emperor Dao’s divine rune stuck to it, suppressing the corpse. As for the corpse’s head, the Square Heaven Seal has been suppressing it for countless years, exhausting its core energy. Even if it has now become bedeviled, neither of them has much energy. If it could take that corpse, it would have long since done so. Why would it still be waiting? Thus, based on this, I’m quite confident that once Heaven Screen Mountain opens, the Square Heaven Seal will be unable to directly take the devil corpse. I should have a fairly high chance of succeeding,” explained Mo Nian confidently.

“You’ve seen the devil corpse?! You’ve seen an arrow with Emperor Dao’s divine rune?” Xing Wujiang was shocked. If he didn’t know any better, he would have thought that Mo Nian was joking.

In his youth, he had also entered Heaven Screen Mountain. However, he had never seen the devil corpse in the forbidden zone. After all, he couldn’t get close to it when he was a Divine Venerate.

After reaching the Eternal realm, he was never able to enter Heaven Screen Mountain, so that corpse was essentially a legendary existence. As for whatever that arrow was, he had never heard of it.

“If I hadn’t seen those things, would I have almost lost my life?” replied Mo Nian helplessly.

Reflecting on that experience, Mo Nian felt a surge of fear. The curse had been truly terrifying. Despite unleashing all his special tools and runes against it, he could only watch as they were corroded by the curse energy, which still managed to reach him. Had it not been for his protective equipment, he would have been reduced to dust instantly by the curse, with no chance to escape to meet Long Chen.

According to reason, after experiencing something like that, a person would be doing their best to stay away from it. However, just as Mo Nian said, the more dangerous it was, the more he couldn’t stop thinking about it. He was precisely looking forward to feeling that stimulation, so even he felt himself to be a bit abnormal.

“If what you say is true, that really is amazing. A single arrow was able to suppress the devil corpse for countless years? I wonder what its origins are,” wondered Xing Wujiang.

“Exactly. My target is the corpse’s body and the arrow. That arrow’s rune definitely contains Emperor Dao. I can’t be wrong,” said Mo Nian excitedly.

Long Chen couldn’t help voicing his suspicion. “Big Brother, you say that you have touched upon the next level. Is that level the Emperor realm?”

Xing Wujiang nodded. “Yes. However, I’ve only touched the boundary and haven’t seen its true form. What I can tell is that it is an incredibly vast and distant level, and my whole power is nothing more than a speck of dust in comparison. Just being able to touch that level should be something I’m proud of, but in reality, I can only feel powerlessness and despair. Sometimes, I wish I had never touched that door.”

Xing Wujiang sighed. Long Chen and Mo Nian could see the profound helplessness he felt.

Long Chen was deeply shaken upon learning about the existence of the Emperor realm. Even Xing Wujiang was unaware of any details regarding it.

In contrast, Mo Nian was calm, indicating that he clearly knew more about it. His proficiency in "archaeology" was not without purpose; he had a unique ability to communicate with the dead.

Thinking about it, Long Chen now understood why Mo Nian was so crazy about that place. If Long Chen were in his place, he probably would be no better. Neither of them could resist the allure of great treasures.

“Big Brother Wujiang, just trust little brother once. I’m confident I can take that corpse. After all, this time, I’m not by myself. Long Chen is here too. It’ll definitely work,” urged Mo Nian.

Xing Wujiang was in deep contemplation as he had to be very cautious. If Mo Nian's attempt to reach Heaven Screen Mountain failed and the Square Heaven Seal obtained the devil's corpse, reuniting the head and body, the consequences would be dire. Xing Wujiang would be left powerless to oppose such a formidable enemy.

In the end, Xing Wujiang took a deep breath and made his decision. “Fine. I will trust you. Let us gamble.”

As an unmatched hero unafraid of death, Xing Wujiang was willing to sacrifice himself to bring down the bedeviled Square Heaven Seal, yet this decision weighed heavily on him.

His motivation went beyond stopping the suppressed devil from slaughtering everyone. The paramount reason was to safeguard the honor of the Xing family. For countless years, the Xing family had faithfully served the Grand Xia imperial family, vanquishing countless devils and achieving illustrious deeds. Their honor surpassed their very lives, and Xing Wujiang couldn’t let his ancestors down.

Seeing the confidence that Long Chen and Mo Nian exuded, Xing Wujiang couldn’t help but feel moved. Deep down, he also harbored a secret hope for the Square Heaven Seal to revert to its original state. For him, personally destroying it was the only viable option when all other avenues were exhausted.

Long Chen and Mo Nian were delighted. The three of them continued their drinking session, during which Long Chen and Mo Nian posed further inquiries about the Square Heaven Seal.

“Big Brother Wujiang, you say that you have no heirs? What is up with that?” asked Mo Nian.

This was an extremely private matter, not suitable for discussion at the dinner table. However, with only the three of them present, there were no boundaries or taboos.

“Is it related to the Square Heaven Seal?” probed Long Chen.

“Brother Long Chen, you really are smart.” At first, Xing Wujiang didn’t want to say anything, but when Long Chen guessed it in one go, he directly told them about this matter.

The Xing family’s main bloodline ended with Xing Wujiang, as he was the only one with a high bloodline purity.

If he were to die, the ancestral blood mark on the Square Heaven Seal would slowly fade. Once it was gone, the Square Heaven Seal would be a masterless item, and no one would be able to control it.

Although there was no proof, Xing Wujiang guessed that this situation was undoubtedly caused by the Square Heaven Seal. The formation of the four noble families was also orchestrated by the Square Heaven Seal to confine and restrain Xing Wujiang. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

“If this matter is caused by the Square Heaven Seal, perhaps I have a solution,” remarked Long Chen.

“Really?” Xing Wujiang instantly jumped out of his seat.
