Chapter 3684

This white-robed, white-haired elder was a half-step Divine Venerate. Even just walking, he possessed a natural grace that truly was full of the air of the Immortal Dao.

It went without saying that he seemed very impressive. However, just like his disciples, this elder could not conceal his arrogance. It was an irritating sight.

“What? Are you no longer going to just give orders from the rear? You’re finally willing to come out?” asked Long Chen indifferently.

“I was personally given enlightenment by the mighty Tea Saint. I received his true inheritance, and I will not permit you to spout such nonsense!” raged the patriarch of the Tea Divine School.

The patriarch’s words shocked everyone, and they stared at him in disbelief. Even Long Chen was shocked.

It had to be known that the Tea Saint Lu Yu was the one who made the Tea Scripture. There were three hundred and sixty-eight thousand names of tea on it, and it also recorded the effect of every tea, as well as the picking, prepping, seeping, and uses.

The Tea Scripture had over three hundred and sixty thousand names of tea, but in the current era, people were only able to find less than sixty thousand tea names. The remaining three hundred thousand had long since vanished.

Some teas required medicinal ingredients from the primal chaos era to be brewed. Unfortunately, those ingredients had long since vanished over time.

The primal chaos era’s objects were incredibly mysterious. In fact, those that were capable of recording anything about them had to be people from the desolate era. Furthermore, they would have to be existences from before that ancient desolate battle.

The Tea Saint was an existence from before the ancient desolate battle, but there were no records of him after that battle. All that remained was his personally written three-part scripture.

However, due to the passing of time, many scriptures were copied too many times and eroded. Stone tablets would eventually be damaged with time. Because of that, the Tea Scripture that had been preserved to the current era was fragmented.

However, Long Chen had read through the Tea Scripture in the High Firmament Academy. He had found it to be profound and difficult to comprehend. Furthermore, many parts were not connected to each other. Since that was the case, Long Chen only memorized the parts that he felt made sense.

He had intentionally searched for information on the Tea Saint Lu Hu. The majority of historical books didn’t even recognize him as a person. Most records said that the Tea Saint was a fabrication, while the Tea Scripture was simply the concentrated knowledge of many ancient sages from ancient times, a compendium of their knowledge.

There were also many things mentioned in the scripture that were too obscure. People couldn’t possibly comprehend them. Even the parts that people could understand left them bewildered.

Most people thought that the Tea Saint Lu Hu never existed. Hence, for the patriarch of the Tea Divine School to say that he had received personal enlightenment from the Tea Saint, even Long Chen couldn’t believe his ears.

Looking at his proud expression, it didn’t seem like he was lying. That was what shocked Long Chen the most.

“You’ve really met Tea Saint Lu Hu?” asked Long Chen.

Seeing Long Chen and the others’ shocked expressions, the patriarch proudly said, “Of course. I swear on my very soul. If I lie, let my Tea Divine School immediately turn to dust.”

This oath further shocked everyone. No one would dare to swear on their sect if it wasn’t true. The karma would be far too terrifying. In other words, this proved that he had truly met the Tea Saint Lu Hu.

The Wine God Palace’s experts looked at each other, seeing each other’s disbelief. Yet, they had no choice but to believe it.

“Was there really such a Tea Saint?” asked one of the disciples of the Wine God Palace.

“He truly exists. I have met him,” said the High Priest.

That made everyone jump in shock. Not only was this existence real, but the High Priest had even seen him? That was shocking.

“What kind of person is the Tea Saint? Why would he give pointers to such a person?” asked another disciple.

“The Tea Saint Lu Yu is a wise sage. Things probably aren’t so simple,” said the High Priest. Looking at the petty pleased expression on the patriarch’s face, he shook his head.

The Tea Divine School’s patriarch and his disciples were all unbearably arrogant now.

Qing Yu taunted, “Long Chen, do you have any words to say? Even if your glib tongue could invert black and white, our patriarch is still the personal disciple of the Tea Saint! That status alone is something that a nameless soldier like you can't speak about!”

“Shut your mouth, or you’ll mess up your hair,” retorted Guo Ran disdainfully.

“You…”

Qing Yu was held back by a female disciple who helped him fix his hair. They put on his golden crown again. That would cover up his current haircut.

Long Chen indifferently said, “First let’s ignore whether or not I’m a nameless soldier. If I am not even qualified to speak, then there’s no point in you being here, is there? Why are you discussing the Dao with me?”

“Tell me, do you know the complete Tea Scripture?” asked the patriarch.

“I do. I’ve read it all. However, my aptitude is limited, and there are many areas that I cannot comprehend. Since you are the Tea Saint’s disciple, I’ll ask you for pointers. Within the second part of the Tea Scripture, it is said: the tea flower is not a flower, the tea leaf is not a leaf. The flower and the leaf both contain the Dao. Divided, they are extreme Yin and extreme Yang, combined they are Yin and Yang in harmony, two birthing three. What does that mean? Which tea is that referring to?” asked Long Chen.

The patriarch was silent for a moment as he rapidly thought. He coughed and said, “When the great Saint transmitted the scripture to me, I was still young and crude. I wasn’t able to memorize the entire thing. I feel like the part that you mentioned is familiar. It seems to be talking about a certain flower tea containing Yin and Yang energy…”

His slow appearance was as if he was trying to recall something but was unable to. He seemed a bit vexed. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

“Hahaha!” Long Chen laughed. Rather than speaking, he now communicated with him spiritually. “I’ve seen shameless people, but not someone as shameless as you. That little quote comes from the Pill Dao’s Medicine King Record. It is a description of the Yin Yang Merger Grass. It has nothing to do with tea. Tell me, should I just expose you?”

“Hey, hey, little brother, please have mercy. We can always talk nicely,” replied the patriarch hastily, also spiritually.

“Talk nicely? Why should I? I don’t dislike arrogant people, but I dislike people who are more arrogant than me,” responded Long Chen.

“Junior brother, I really have seen the Tea Saint’s true body! Furthermore, he truly did give me pointers! I can swear on my very soul that it’s not a lie!” The patriarch began to sweat.

“So what? Just based on that, you think you can swagger about so arrogantly? With your current learning, you are only bringing down his prestige. Today, I’ll help him clean up his reputation,” snorted Long Chen.

“No, please junior brother. What about a business transaction?” begged the patriarch.

“Oh? What do you have that I could possibly want?” demanded Long Chen disdainfully. He had been plundering the Soaring Dragon Company for so long and had long since become a rich moneybags. He had enough wealth to build his own nation. What he wanted now was to put this arrogant fellow in his place.

“Take a look at this? Is this satisfactory to you?”

The patriarch took out a certain object. When Long Chen saw it, his smile stiffened and his expression instantly changed.
