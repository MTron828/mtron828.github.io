Chapter 3839 Bronze Cauldron

When Long Chen charged down, the Nine Underworld Luocha and Yin Changsheng immediately followed. After the Fusang Tree’s roots were ripped out, a large underground cave was revealed.

This cave went so deep that they couldn’t see the bottom. It was a channel, and there was an indescribable aura bursting out from within. It was incredibly bizarre.

When Long Chen charged down, he quickly noticed that this underground area was its own world.

When he reached the end of the channel, the first thing to enter his eyes was a golden lake. It looked like a lake of liquid gold.

At the center of this lake, he saw a bronze cauldron floating on the surface of the water. It was an ancient cauldron with various carvings: the sun, moon, and stars; mountains, plains, and rivers; flying birds and walking beasts.

This bronze cauldron was clearly no ordinary item. But curiously, it didn’t give off the slightest pressure. Its runes were completely dark, and it even gave off a kind of rusty feeling.

It was silently floating on the surface of the golden lake. But the translucent Heavenly Border Line cut the lake in two, and that bronze cauldron was nestled right in the middle of the line. Half of it was on this side of the Heavenly Boundary Line, and the other half was on the other side.

As soon as Long Chen arrived, he saw a sneaky figure in the midst of rubbing that bronze cauldron.

“Stop! That treasure is mine!”

Long Chen shouted and rushed over. In this life, he had seen countless treasures, so he could instantly tell that this bronze cauldron had a shocking origin. This was most likely the most valuable existence within this heavenly tomb.

“That cauldron! You must obtain it.”

Just then, the dragon expert’s voice rang out in Long Chen’s mind. Its normal voice was calm as water, but now it was actually quivering slightly. That was enough to show how emotional it was.

That made Long Chen jump. To be able to make the dragon expert this emotional, it was definitely an extraordinary existence.

Long Chen slashed his saber at Ji Wuming. However, Ji Wuming didn’t block it. Instead, he floated back. He actually gave the cauldron to Long Chen.

Right as he dodged, Long Chen saw a piece of paper in his hand. There were countless marks on it now. Those were the bronze cauldron’s runes and carvings.

“A rubbing?”

Long Chen hadn’t expected Ji Wuming to have simply recorded the runes after being in here for so long. He hadn’t taken the cauldron. From this, Long Chen instantly realized that taking this bronze cauldron would not be so easy.

When Long Chen appeared in front of the three-foot-tall cauldron, he immediately slammed a hand on it.

Even so, there wasn’t the slightest movement at all. There was not even a sound, leaving Long Chen’s hand numb. He was astonished.

He was currently in his Seven Star Battle Armor state. The power of this palm could flip the heavens, but it was unable to shake the bronze cauldron in the slightest. He didn’t even cause any sound to come out of the cauldron. Just how heavy was it?

Just then, a flame spear tore through the air at Long Chen’s back. This ruthless attack was from Yin Changsheng.

Long Chen suddenly had a thought. Pressing on the cauldron, he pushed himself up, narrowly avoiding Yin Changsheng’s attack. It narrowly missed hitting Long Chen’s ribs and struck the cauldron.

Long Chen didn’t go far. He was no longer even thinking of killing anyone. His goal was only to take this bronze cauldron. He also wanted to see if Yin Changsheng’s spear that was backed with faith energy would shake the cauldron. Then perhaps he would be able to take it.

BANG!

Yin Changsheng’s spear stabbed the cauldron, causing a crisp sound to ring out. However, that peerless spear actually shattered into countless pieces in front of Long Chen’s shocked gaze. In front of this cauldron, the flame spear was as weak as a piece of wood.

Yin Changsheng coughed up blood. This was his life spear, something that he had nourished for many years. It had never failed him before, but it was actually broken today. As a result, his soul instantly suffered a severe injury.

The spear shattered, but the bronze cauldron wasn’t damaged in the slightest. It was as if there was nothing within heaven and earth that could shake it.

Yin Changsheng coughed up three large mouthfuls of blood, and his aura turned listless. Long Chen could clearly tell that it wasn’t just because he had lost his spear. He also suffered a significant injury.

“This bronze cauldron is stuck in the Heavenly Boundary Line. As long as the Heavenly Boundary Line isn’t broken, no one can move it. Attacking it is equivalent to attacking the Heavenly Boundary Line, which is the same as attacking the entire heavenly tomb. Yin Changsheng, you really are fortunate. You were smart to abandon your weapon and protect yourself with faith energy at that critical moment. Otherwise, you would already be a corpse,” said Ji Wuming lightly at the shocked and enraged Yin Changsheng.

Being the first person to arrive, Ji Wuming was the first to realize that the cauldron couldn’t be moved. That was why when Long Chen came charging over, he didn’t stop him. He knew that no one could take it away.

However, what he hadn’t expected was for Long Chen to pull back his attack against him. When he dodged, Long Chen simply put away his saber instead of following through to strike the cauldron.

When Long Chen tested the cauldron with his hand, he didn’t use a weapon. Pushing with just his physical strength hadn’t caused a backlash.

On the other hand, Yin Changsheng was unlucky. Ji Wuming had failed to bait Long Chen, but Long Chen managed to bait Yin Changsheng. He was almost conned to death.

However, for Ji Wuming to only say this afterward was no different than patronizing sarcasm. Yin Changsheng wouldn’t thank him for this helpful advice. He viewed it as Ji Wuming intentionally mocking him.

Suddenly, the world quivered intensely, and bubbles appeared on the lake like it was boiling. At the same time, cracks appeared in the soil above his head. This entire world looked like it was about to collapse.

“Long Chen, there’s another person from the other side! It’s-!” Mo Nian’s voice rang out from above.Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

BOOM!

With a huge explosion, the other side of the Heavenly Boundary Line exploded. Based on the distance, that was where the corresponding Moon Tree should be.

What Long Chen didn’t know was that when he and Yin Changsheng ripped the Fusang Tree out of the ground, the corresponding Moon Tree on the other side also reacted.

From an aerial point of view, this world was like a giant Taiji diagram. The Moon Tree and the Fusang Tree were the eyes of the Yin and Yang fishes.

When one eye was damaged, the Taiji diagram started to lose its balance. After that, the other eye, the Moon Tree, started to crack and wither.

Furthermore, at this time, from the other side of the Heavenly Boundary Line, countless figures came charging in. They directly snatched away the Moon Tree. Furthermore, when Mo Nian and the others saw one figure in particular, they couldn’t believe their eyes. Mo Nian hastily called out a warning.

The space on the other side of the Heavenly Boundary Line quivered, and a figure descended from above. When Long Chen saw him, his eyes instantly turned scarlet.

That person also saw Long Chen. However, he laughed instead.

“Long Chen! Hahaha, I, Long Aotian, have finally found you! Tell me, how am I supposed to thank you?”
