Chapter 3442 Devils Invade

The devil sea erupted at the same time as the devil race invaded the immortal world. It couldn’t be a coincidence.

If it wasn’t a coincidence, someone must be controlling things behind the scenes. Long Chen instantly thought of how the Integral Heaven Star-Field had originally belonged to the human race but was then invaded by devils, only for them to retreat for no reason after taking over, resulting in the entire star-field falling into the hands of the Sacred Pill Hall.

If his guess was correct, Lord Brahma definitely had a way to control those devils. He was the source of this calamity, and he was the one using the devils against the High Firmament Academy.

“When did you receive this information?” asked Long Chen.

“Three days ago,” answered the city lord.

Three days? That wasn’t too long. Long Chen said, “City lord, please help me activate the transportation formation. I must go right now.”

The city lord awkwardly said, “This transportation formation isn’t kept active at all times. In order to reactivate it, we need close to a hundred immortal king crystals. Right now, I only have…”

Long Chen instantly understood. If the transportation formation was kept active at all times, then sending a single Divine Lord across domains would only cost around ten immortal king crystals.

However, actually turning on the formation so that it could be used required close to a hundred immortal king crystals. That kind of wealth was no small sum to this city lord, and he hadn’t reached such a level of generosity that he could give Long Chen that much.

“That’s fine. Is this enough?” Long Chen directly gave the city lord one hundred and twenty immortal king crystals.

“It’s enough. There are also leftovers…” The city lord relaxed when he saw Long Chen take out the money. He had no intention of taking advantage of Long Chen, but he really was unable to lose that much money.

“The leftover change is the fee for using your transportation formations. Rules are rules. My High Firmament Academy can’t let you work for nothing. Please hurry,” said Long Chen. He didn’t even care about this small sum. He only wanted to get back as fast as possible.

As expected, money was the solution to all problems. The immortal king crystals were then embedded into notches in the formation, and it was fully activated in just an incense stick’s worth of time.

After that, Long Chen stepped in and space twisted around him. After some time, his body felt heavy, and his foot landed on solid ground.

There was a familiar scent in the air yet also foreign. That foreign scent was full of brutality and slaughter.

This was definitely the Heavenly Swell Domain. Now, Long Chen took out a map and checked where he was. Orienting himself, he rushed toward the closest prefecture city.

When he arrived, he found that they were on a strict lockdown. The grand formation had been activated, and countless armored experts were on guard, waiting for enemies to attack.

“Dean Long Chen?!”Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

When Long Chen arrived, those experts cried out in shock. They hastily let him in.

“Many thanks. I wish to borrow your transportation formation to get back to the High Firmament Academy,” said Long Chen to their leader.

“Dean Long Chen, didn’t you run? Why are you going back?” asked the leader.

“I ran?” Long Chen’s heart shook. It seemed that the problem was worse than he had expected.

After asking some questions, he learned that the spatial channel that the devils had opened was near the High Firmament Academy. Hence, the academy was completely isolated and besieged by countless devils. The surrounding laws were also shattered, leaving their transportation formations ineffective.

As for the prefecture cities around the High Firmament Academy, they were on a tight lockdown. Fortunately, up until now, those devils seemed to only have their sights on the High Firmament Academy. Only a small portion spread throughout the surroundings.

This prefecture city was very far from the Martial Heaven Prefecture. Thus, right now, they were under no pressure. Their experts had even gone to support other prefecture cities. However, the Martial Heaven Prefecture’s space was in chaos, so they were unable to go there directly. They had no idea what was going on there.

In this situation, countless rumors were running wild. They all said that the High Firmament Academy was about to fall. Seeing Long Chen appear here, they thought that he had run.

“Remember, the High Firmament Academy has not toppled in trillions of years. This kind of tiny wave is nothing. Second, although the disciples of the High Firmament Academy might not get along normally, when crisis descends, all their hearts are united. No one will retreat or abandon the others to flee. Third, the people spreading rumors and trying to bring everyone down are trash. Stay away from them.”

After saying that, Long Chen stepped into the transportation formation. He rushed toward the Yaohua Prefecture, which was closest to the Martial Heaven Prefecture.

Once he was here, he heard the sound of battle. Even his appearance didn’t draw anyone’s notice.

He then hastily rushed to the city gates. A huge swarm of devils was attacking the city’s formation.

Those devils were several meters tall, with long hands and feet, looking a bit like hairless apes. Their heads were larger though, and they had fangs that were like sawteeth. Moreover, bone-like claws grew out of their hands and feet, and they were covered in scales. In addition to their sinister appearances, their auras were full of brutality and bloodthirstiness.

Long Chen saw millions of experts fighting those devils, blocking them from getting close to the prefecture city.

This grand formation was the final lifeline of the prefecture city, a last resort that couldn’t be used until all else failed. If the formation was broken as well, then the millions and millions of commoners inside the city would be killed.

Countless women and children were quivering inside their rooms. The roars of the devils could be heard through the formation. To them, it felt as if the very heavens were collapsing.

Hence, the millions of experts outside the city were fighting with all their power. Even cultivators only in the Divine Flame realm were participating.

The battlefield spread as far as the eye could see. The ground was littered with corpses, and black blood infected the land. It was unknown how many corpses of the human race were buried under the carcasses of the devils.

The furthest group was composed of over ten Immortal Kings fighting a single terrifying devil. The other devils had black scales, but this devil’s scales were fiery-red.

Its Blood Qi was truly like a sea and its Devil qi overflowed. With every strike of its claws, the void was torn apart. A single Heaven tier Immortal King going all-out to receive this attack was still left coughing up blood.

That devil had reached the half-step World King level, so only that Heaven tier Immortal King was barely able to receive its attacks. The others could only work with him to buy him some time between attacks.

However, that half-step World King devil was too terrifying. The elder received three blows before being wounded, which caused everyone to despair.

Other than this one elder, no one else was capable of stopping this devil. But this elder was so old that he was already past his prime. There was no way he could beat the devil.

BOOM!

The other Immortal Kings, including two Earth tier Immortal Kings, joined forces to stop the devil’s next attack. As a result, all of them were like blades of grass in the wind, blown far into the distance and coughing up blood. Their auras fell.

“You damn devil!”

That Heaven tier Immortal King saw that there was no beating this devil. With a furious roar, he summoned all his power, condensing it into one final attack. He knew that this blow was useless, but he would rather die trying than retreat.

The elder’s sword fell. Following that, a shocking scene occurred. A ray of divine light fell, and that unstoppable fiend suddenly quivered. After that, a crack spread from the top of its head all the way to its abdomen.

“What…?” The elder stared in disbelief.
