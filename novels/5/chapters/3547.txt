Chapter 3536

Long Chen turned tail and fled. At this moment, two fifth Heavenstage World King Heavenly Spirit Fish were crazily chasing him.

“How am I so unlucky?!”

Long Chen cursed furiously. This was the seventh day since he had entered this world. Using the Phoenix Blood Heavenly Silk Net, he was catching a crazy number of Heavenly Flame Spirits.

Hence, Huo Linger had also devoured an unknown number of Heavenly Flame Spirits. Her true combat power was practically capable of matching a third Heavenstage World King now.

As a result, Long Chen’s heart had grown greedy, and he had started to look for a fifth Heavenstage Heavenly Flame Spirit to consume.

He found that the Heavenly Flame Spirits in the lava sea were quite a bit weaker than the ones on the land, so it would be a bit safer. Thus, in the last few days, Long Chen had started baiting fish in the lava sea.

Today, he had finally summoned the courage to bait a fifth Heavenstage Heavenly Flame Spirit. After tremendous effort, they finally managed to suppress it, only to end up disturbing another strong Heavenly Flame Spirit. Seeing the situation take a terrible turn, Long Chen and Huo Linger directly fled.

They fled all the way out of the lava sea region, and only then did those Heavenly Flame Spirits return to within the lava. After that, Long Chen wiped off some cold sweat.

Yu Qingxuan had said that the Heavenly Flame World would stay for around twenty-one days. As a third of the time was already over, Long Chen had to hurry up to help Huo Linger absorb more Heavenly Flame Spirits.

“Big brother Long Chen, just now, if I used the Ice Soul power, I could definitely kill them. Why didn’t you let me?” Huo Linger couldn’t help asking.

“Foolish girl, the Ice Soul power isn’t your core energy. Once you use it, it won’t recover for at least ten days. If some terrifying existence comes out at that time, we’ll be doomed. The Ice Soul power is our final life-saving trump card. We can’t use it unless we have no other choice,” said Long Chen.

Huo Linger had merged with that rune of the Ice Soul and could control a trace of the Ice Soul’s power. However, this rune was like an energy storage rune.

Once the rune’s energy was used up, they would have to wait until it recharged, and that would take too long. Thus, Long Chen didn’t dare to allow Huo Linger to use it just yet.

“Then are we returning to the lava sea?” asked Huo Linger.

Long Chen pondered their options and then shook his head. “No, although it’s big, there are too many people there. Everyone has noticed that the Heavenly Flame Spirits aren’t too dangerous in the lava sea, so they are putting all their efforts there. When there are too many wolves, there isn’t enough meat. Furthermore, after fishing for so many days, the fish have gotten smarter, and we’re getting fewer and fewer. Getting some soup with all these people isn’t as good as pressing forward and seeing if we can get some big meat.”

The lava sea was large, but too many people were gathering there. If others didn’t provoke Long Chen, he didn’t feel good driving them off. Hence, his efficiency had been dropping over the last two days. That was why Long Chen had taken the risk of trying to subdue a fifth Heavenstage Heavenly Flame Spirit.

“Furthermore, we haven’t seen Zhao Mingxuan, Wu Yang, and the others during this time. They might have found a better place, so they haven’t come back here. We should press onwards.”

After resting a bit, he and Huo Linger returned to their peak condition and continued deeper.

Past the lava sea was a lava swamp. Suddenly, fluctuations came from ahead, and Long Chen rushed in that direction.

He heard roaring. After that, he saw a cheetah several meters long chasing down a foot-long white fox.

The fox was small, but it was very fast. It maintained a set distance from the cheetah the entire time.

The fox was actually rushing straight toward Long Chen. Seeing that he wasn’t afraid, it was like it had seen its lucky star and threw itself into Long Chen’s embrace.

Long Chen was dumbfounded and instinctively caught it. After that, the fox hopped onto his shoulder and hid behind him.

Huo Linger then appeared with a flame spear and killed the cheetah. It was a two rune Heavenly Flame Spirit, and she could easily kill it.

The white fox started to cry on Long Chen’s shoulder, seemingly expressing something. But Long Chen didn’t understand. For now, the only thing he could sense was that it bore no malice against him.

“It’s asking you to send it home. It will repay you,” translated Huo Linger.

“Home?” Long Chen was even more confused. This white fox was clearly a Heavenly Flame Spirit. Was this place not its home?

The little fox seemed to understand his words. It once more cried out.

“It’s saying that this place isn’t its home. It accidentally ran over here. It can see the way back, but there are too many demons that want to eat it, so it can’t get back. It has been stuck in this world for a long time and has missed three chances. If it still can’t get back this time, it will die here,” said Huo Linger.

When the little fox was done explaining, it actually rubbed its little head on Long Chen’s neck, looking at him with a pleading expression.

“But our time is limited. Where is its home? How will we find it? How long will it take?” asked Long Chen. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

The little fox once more spoke and Huo Linger explained, “Its home is at the end of the whirlpool. There seems to be an exit there. Based on its explanation, it seems a bit similar to the entrance we came through. It lived in another world, and one day, it was sucked in by a gate and came to the Heavenly Flame World. Because of this, it has to spend every day hiding from the other Heavenly Flame Spirits. It has no concept of time and only knows that it has been here for a very long time. Three times it saw the exit to its home appear, but it was unable to get through the demons and was almost eaten. This time, it met you. It says that you can definitely bring it home. Otherwise, it will die here because this is its final chance. If it misses it, the energy inside its body will not last until the next time the exit appears.”

Seeing this little fellow pitifully staring at him, Long Chen helplessly said, “Fine, we can try it. But it can’t get in the way of our return. Worst-case scenario, we just won’t hunt.”

Long Chen really couldn’t harden his heart enough to refuse this pitiful little fellow. He agreed to try.

The little fox instantly became delighted. Its body shrank until it was like a squirrel obediently squatting on Long Chen’s shoulder.

Huo Linger exchanged a few more words with it. Long Chen learned that the center of that giant whirlpool had another entrance to this world that connected to another world.

According to the little fox, the Heavenly Flame World would often form entrances to other worlds, but the entrance to the fox’s world would only appear once in a very long period.

Furthermore, after it was sucked into the Heavenly Flame World, it could only rely on its core energy to survive. It could not cultivate here. Moreover, every day, it had to nervously hide from those fiendish spirits.

Long Chen investigated its core energy and found that it wasn’t lying. Although it was also a flame attribute lifeform, the energy inside of its body was pure and peaceful. The wild flame energy would not merge with it. Furthermore, it really was almost out of core energy. If it stayed here any longer, it would die.

“Little fox, you lead the way. I’ll send you home.” Long Chen took a deep breath. Although he knew that it was a bit foolish, there was no other way. He couldn’t just watch as this pitiful little fellow died.

The little fox squatted on Long Chen’s left shoulder, while Huo Linger transformed into a little flame dragon squatting on his right shoulder. Along the way, the little fox gave directions while Huo Linger translated. Just like this, Long Chen was directed into the depths of this world.
