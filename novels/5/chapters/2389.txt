Chapter 2379 Weeping From Being Conned

Translator: BornToBe

Following Long Chen’s order, a rain of arrows fell. But the arrow towers weren’t touched at all. Instead, the warriors of the eighth legion had shot directly with bows.

What kind of range did those bows have? Well, the arrows didn’t even manage to fly outside the barrier before landing on the ground.

“Did you all not eat before coming? You don’t have the slightest power! How are you supposed to save them like this?!” shouted Long Chen.

One of the warriors grumbled. “It’s not our fault. We worked our butts off setting up the formation platforms. We’re exhausted.”

“Don’t talk nonsense! Why not shoot the long-range cannons!?” shouted Long Chen.

“We haven’t set them all up yet. We can’t use them. It’ll take at least two hours to prepare them,” said that warrior.

“Why would it take that long?!” demanded Long Chen. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“We were too nervous and made a few mistakes with our initial setup, so we’ll need to fix those issues first.”

“Alright, then we have no choice but to keep shooting arrows. Just show that you’re putting in your full effort. Humans can only do their best. The results are up to fate!” declared Long Chen helplessly.

Long Chen made sure his words were transmitted far enough for Ye Lingfeng to hear. He wanted to save them, but he simply didn’t have enough time. But not to worry, as long as Ye Lingfeng lasted another two hours, Long Chen would be able to save them.

“Long Chen, you…!”

“What? I can’t do anything. For people to be nervous during such a large battle is natural. The divine families’ rules are very clear. As long as you can guarantee your own safety, it is the death penalty not to save your comrades. But we are clearly not in that situation. You can’t expect us to throw away our lives for nothing. Commander Ye, I’m sorry. But don’t worry, once you die, we’ll make sure to burn some extra paper money for you so that you’ll be worry-free underground,” said Long Chen.

“Go in peace,” shouted the warriors of the eighth legion in unison.

The vein on Ye Lingfeng’s forehead looked like it might explode. Their defenses were growing weaker as more of them were killed. With their morale shattered, their defenses might instantly crack at any moment.

“Long Chen, what do you want to save us?” Ye Lingfeng had to admit that he had lost.

With his understanding of the eighth legion’s camp, he knew that Long Chen definitely had the power to save them. But it seemed that Long Chen didn’t want to save him and didn’t care about the possible consequences. He could escape without blame, which worried Ye Lingfeng.

“These demonic beasts were drawn over by you in order to screw us over. Now you’ve screwed yourself. You spun your web and are now caught in it. No one would blame us for not wanting to save you. But due to your service to the divine families, I can give you a way to live. I don’t have many conditions. If we save you, then all the demonic beast corpses on this battlefield belong to us,” said Long Chen.

“Impossible! We have paid so much, and so many of our brothers have fallen. What are we supposed to do if we give everything to you?!” howled Ye Lingfeng. This was an ocean’s worth of points.

Long Chen ignored him and shouted, “Brothers, have the weapons been repaired?”

“Soon! There is still three incense sticks’ worth of time, and then we can fight!”

Long Chen nodded. “Not bad, it’s even faster than expected. Keep working hard.” Turning around, he announced, “Commander Ye, although you’ve declined, I still wish to help you, so don’t worry. As long as you can last another three incense sticks’ worth of time, we will immediately activate the formation to save you. Endure. I look favorably upon you.”

Even half an incense stick’s worth of time seemed unlikely in this scenario. They were like a flickering candle in the wind.

“You win. Everything will belong to you.” Ye Lingfeng finally submitted.

“Brothers, how are the repairs now?” asked Long Chen.

“Reporting, we found that our initial setup wasn’t wrong actually, and after a few minor adjustments, things have been fixed. The formation can be activated!”

“Haha, excellent! Brothers, our allies are in danger! Can we just watch as those merciless demonic beasts slaughter them? Activate the killing formation and wipe them out!” shouted Long Chen.

The land began to shine. Arrows shot through the air at the distant battlefield.

At the same time, one particular arrow exploded in the sky, causing purple powder to scatter throughout the battlefield.

The originally crazy demonic beasts suddenly weakened. Their attacks slowed as well.

“What’s going on?” asked Shen Chengfeng. How could a single arrow affect millions of demonic beasts?

“What is there to be surprised about? It’s the antidote. It’s just like someone who used medicine to push himself over their limits and then instantly withers when the effect fades,” said Long Chen.

These demonic beasts had been attacking so fiercely because of the bewitching medicine, which caused them to overdraft their energy. That was why their assault had been enough to pressure Ye Lingfeng.

After fighting for so long, they had run out of energy. With the antidote removing the effects of the medicine, these demonic beasts could barely remain standing.

Arrows rained down across the battlefield. Those arrows then transformed into pillars sealing the battlefield.

Long Chen shouted, “Commander Ye, bring your people away.”

Ye Lingfeng’s three war chariots rumbled. The demonic beasts couldn’t stop them and were blown out of the way. The chariots easily escaped.

However, their original thirty thousand troops had lost five thousand of its members. That was a huge loss to the third legion.

More and more arrows rained down, transforming into runic chains that completely locked up the battlefield. The demonic beasts inside were powerless to break free, and Ye Lingfeng’s eyes turned green. These demonic beasts would all belong to Long Chen.

Just at this moment, a luxurious carriage broke through the void and rushed over.

“Senior Feng Fei?!”

There was no one within the divine families who wouldn’t recognize this carriage. It was the personal property of Feng Fei. No one had expected her to come.

At the same time, they noticed that the carriage was dragging a giant corpse. It was a humanoid giant with a pair of blood-colored bat wings. There was a golden chain around its neck dragging it.

That corpse gave off a chilling feeling. It was enough to strike terror into their hearts.

Even the trapped demonic beasts suddenly became still, not daring to make a noise.

“A Blood Wing Demon King. Heavens, senior Feng Fei actually killed a Blood Wing Demon King and brought back its corpse?!” exclaimed Shen Chengfeng.

“That corpse is very powerful.” Long Chen also felt the immense pressure of the corpse. It gave off a threatening feeling. It was difficult to imagine just how powerful it was when it was still alive.

“Of course. The Blood Wing Demon Kings are existences that not even the Heaven Elders can do anything about. They come from the emperor bloodline of the demon race. Only those with exceptionally pure bloodlines can reach the level of demon kings, and they all have exceptional statuses within the demon race. Just think about how many servants they must have to protect them. However, senior Feng Fei was able to kill one and even bring back its intact corpse. Within this entire world, perhaps only an expert on her level can do such a thing,” said Shen Chengfeng worshipfully, his voice even shuddering a bit.

“What is going on here? Senior Feng Fei received word that someone was in trouble? Were you lying?”

One of the bodyguards overlooked the battlefield, and seeing everything was under control, he was angry.

Ye Lingfeng suddenly felt like the world was spinning around him. He coughed up a mouthful of blood and had an urge to kill himself. Why hadn’t he been able to endure just a few more seconds? Just a few more seconds, and there would have been no need for Long Chen to save them. Senior Feng Fei would have done it.

Ye Lingfeng knelt on the ground and sobbed. “Senior Feng Fei, please get justice for me! Long Chen conned us and made us lose over five thousand warriors. He even swindled us of our spoils for this battle. This murdering scoundrel cannot have a good death!”

Toward the end, the mighty commander of the glorious Heavenly Dragon Legion began to simply weep.

“Long Chen?” The bodyguard’s expression twitched. He looked at the distant figure within the barrier, and a vein jumped on his forehead. This was the same bodyguard who had tried to strike Long Chen with his whip before. As a result, Long Chen had taken his whip and returned the strike.

“Long Chen, shouldn’t you get the hell out here and explain?!” shouted the bodyguard.

“Who do you think you are? Understand that you’re a dog, and I don’t eat dog meat. Don’t force me to be a butcher,” said Long Chen coldly. This person was a pig who didn’t remember his beatings. It seemed like his last lesson hadn’t left a deep enough impression.

Suddenly, all the third legion’s warriors came out of their chariots and knelt on the ground, crying.

“Senior Feng Fei, please get justice for us!”
