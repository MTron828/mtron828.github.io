Chapter 3967 Little Black Room

Seeing this, Long Chen jumped in shock and hastily caught her. The other guards were also stunned. Considering how powerful Yu Qianxue was, how could she faint from anger?

Unlike Long Chen, they didn’t have the guts to touch her. They didn’t even dare to get close to her.

It had to be known that Yu Qianxue was a germaphobe that didn’t like to touch anyone. In fact, people that tried to even get close to her drew her ire.

After Long Chen pressed a finger on Yu Qianxue’s forehead, he frowned. “Her willpower is severely taxed. She’s almost out of mental energy. What happened in solitary confinement?”

“It’s the most terrifying mental torture. Within the little black room, you are cut off from the outside world. Without light and sound, it feels like time stops there. Within that darkness, everything seems to be nothing, almost like dying. Also, within that darkness, your negative emotions grow. I was once punished with it for a day, but that single day felt as long as ten thousand years. When I came out, I was almost crazy. It took a long time for me to recover. As Princess Qianxue was locked inside for three days, for her mind to still be clear after coming out shows that she is indescribably powerful,” said one of the guards with a fearful expression, as if he didn’t even like to recall this torture.

“That’s right, that little black room is so terrifying that you can only understand once you’re locked inside. It feels like a monster inside of you is going to be unleashed and devour your soul. There’s no way to describe that feeling of isolation, terror, and helplessness. In that room, you face all your weaknesses. No matter how strong a person is, their willpower will crumble there,” said another guard with the same terror in his eyes.

Long Chen took out a medicinal pill and fed it to Yu Qianxue. After that, his Spiritual Strength flowed into her, nourishing and stabilizing her soul.

“It’s nothing major. She was just too emotional just now. Have her sleep a bit and she’ll be fine. Bring her back to the princess mansion,” said Long Chen.VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

The guards just stared at him. No one stepped forward, and they actually stepped back.

Long Chen was confused and somehow had a bad feeling. Upon looking down, he saw Yu Qianxue’s eyes flutter; she was waking up. Realizing something, Long Chen hastily shoved her away.

Everyone cried out in shock. Yu Qianxue was actually pushed onto the ground by Long Chen, but they just watched as she fell, not daring to catch her. That proved Long Chen’s guess.

Long Chen didn’t push light enough, so Yu Qianxue left a human-shaped indent in the ground. Furthermore, just then, she woke up and crawled up. When she looked around, those guards retreated in terror.

“It wasn’t us!”

Yu Qianxue’s gaze turned to Long Chen. In an instant, the fury in her eyes erupted.

Long Chen hastily said, “I gave you a medicinal pill to regather your will that was on the verge of collapsing! Otherwise, there was a danger of your Yuan Spirit dispersing. I heard that you don’t like touching anyone, so to express my innocence, after saving you, I put you down. It’s an expression of my respect for you.”

“Respect? Then you must respect me very much. Were you planning on planting me here? Or were you just going to bury me and leave it at that?” Yu Qianxue pointed at the hole in the ground.

“Isn’t that because I was afraid of a misunderstanding? In my hurry, I might have been a bit too heavy-handed. I apologize. But no matter how you put it, I took the risk of being cursed by you in order to save you. That’s better than just watching and not saving you, right? You can’t just curse me alone, alright?” Long Chen pointed at those guards, causing their expressions to change.

Yu Qianxue instantly whirled upon those guards, a layer of frost covering her face. The fury in her eyes almost made them ignite.

“All of you, scram!”

Those guards hastily fled, but their terrified expressions gradually turned into one of relief once they were far away. Now, Princess Qingxue’s fury would be cast only on one person.

Once they were gone, Yu Qianxue took out her sword and pointed it at Long Chen. “I’ve had enough of you. If this keeps going, I’ll die of rage because of you! We are going to fight, and if I win, everything you have will be mine, including you. If I lose, everything I have will be yours, including myself. Do you accept it or not?!”

Long Chen stared at her, feeling dumbfounded. This temper was a bit too much like her father’s, wasn’t it? This was too decisive.

“Why are you acting like this? Didn’t you just lose some stuff? If you want, I’ll accompany you. Don’t get so angry,” advised Long Chen.

“Do you think I care about this money?! You just pissed me off! How are you going to make up for that?!” raged Yu Qianxue.

“I don’t have any solution for that. Hm, how about you just swallow it?” suggested Long Chen helplessly

“Are you telling me to choke on my anger?! You want me to die?!” Yu Qianxue was further incensed that flames sprouted above her head.

“That’s not what I meant. In life, how can everything simply go as you please? Things are usually only fifty percent satisfactory. Sometimes, we simply have to learn to be happy with what we have. Tell me, don’t you think that this principle is correct?” Long Chen smiled.

“Your smile is very loathsome,” said Yu Qianxue coldly.

“Your smile is very beautiful. So we’re good, right?” Long Chen was speechless. Had this child’s head grown muddled from being burned?

“You really refuse to fight me?” demanded Yu Qianxue.

“Give it up. Girl, to tell the truth, you people are children in front of me. Let alone in your current weakened state, even in your peak condition, you wouldn’t be able to receive three moves from me. Don’t be stubborn and refuse to accept reality. Let me put it to you this way: I’ve killed more people than you have ever seen in your entire life, so I’ve long since grown tired of fighting for fame or power. I can instantly see through your power, and you are unable to threaten me. What is the point of competing? Other than that, I never treat such competitions as games. I only train killing moves. When I attack, it is to kill. Either you die or I die. The two of us have no enmity that requires one of us to die. In fact, you are my future sister-in-law. Why would I fight to the death with you?” said Long Chen kindly.

Long Chen could already see that Yu Qianxue might not be a kind person, but she wasn’t an evil person either. After all, they would be family in the future. There was no need to be so stubborn. Long Chen was even planning on using her platform to get closer to Yu Qingxuan.

“Without an honorable fight, how can you tell who is stronger and who is weaker? You’re my training partner, so you have a responsibility to accompany me in battle. I refuse to believe that I can’t beat you. If you refuse, I’ll think of anything I can to torment you until you accept. There’s no need for you to watch this gate. Go raise my fish,” ordered Yu Qianxue coldly.

As a result, Long Chen was moved from the medicinal field and sent to the royal family’s fishing ground. After placing him there, Yu Qianxue returned to her own residence. She refused to believe that Long Chen wouldn’t submit. Just as she started to recuperate and entered a meditative state, someone came running over in a panic, practically wailing.

“Princess, not good! Something terrible has happened! Long Chen, he… he cooked his majesty’s most beloved Seven Color Dragon Fish!”

“What?!”

Yu Qianxue’s soul almost fled in terror. That was one of the emperor’s treasures.
