The qi flow streams grew stronger. The very essence of the world was flowing through them.

The various leaders of the factions on the Martial Heaven Continent began to shout, ordering their disciples to absorb as much of the qi flow as possible.

The disciples within the streams of qi flow then attacked the barriers between them and the next realm. In an instant, countless people broke through, their auras rising.

Within the qi flow streams, their advancements were incredibly easy. The Pill Fairy, Kun Pengzi, Tian Xiezi, Xue Luocha, and the others also started breaking through.

In just three breaths’ time, they went from the first Heavenstage of Life Star to the second.

“Long Chen, if you won’t let us absorb the qi flow, then you should also give up on absorbing it as well. In the worst case, we’ll just return to the Martial Heaven Sea-Ring and absorb it, while you will have missed your chance!” declared the Six Horn Sea Serpent man.

He was barely able to keep up with Long Chen due to the bloodline suppression, making him angry enough to cough up blood. It wasn’t that he wasn’t strong enough, but there was the dragon blood suppression.

“How foolish. Did you drink too much seawater that your brain rotted? Do you think we didn’t come prepared?” Long Chen suddenly forced him back and took out a medicinal pill, popping it into his mouth.

“Heavens, that’s a top grade eleventh tier pill! He’s just stuffing them into his mouth?!”

All the seniors from every faction stared in shock at Long Chen as he began to consume medicinal pills while fighting. Furthermore, they were all top grade eleventh tier pills.

Actually, they were also tribulation pills, but Long Chen had covered up that fact. Top grade pills might be shocking, but if they were also tribulation pills, that would drive people insane.

An explosion came from within Long Chen’s body. His 108,000 stars began to grow rapidly, and he stepped into the second Heavenstage of Life Star.

With Long Chen advancing, his power grew, causing him to suppress the Six Horn Sea Serpent man even more.

In the first Heavenstage, Long Chen hadn’t had much of an advantage over him, but after reaching the second Heavenstage, his 108,000 stars had doubled in size. His astral power and spiritual yuan had grown.

Seeing Long Chen eat those incredibly precious pills like they were candy and his aura continuously rising, the Six Horn Sea Serpent man finally gave up. “Bastard, just wait!” With a swing of his trident, he retreated. “Sea demon race, hear my orders! Follow me.” Giving up on Long Chen, he went to a nearby qi flow stream. “If you don’t want to die, then scram!”

This qi flow stream contained hundreds of thousands of disciples from the Righteous path. However, they were disciples of the sects that had betrayed the Martial Heaven Alliance. Seeing the sea demon army turn their sights on them, they turned green.

They weren’t the Dragonblood Legion and didn’t dare to fight the sea demon race. They would be killed in just a few breaths’ time, so they could only obediently leave.

After leaving, they were lost. The surrounding qi flow streams had been occupied by the other top forces of the continent. The closest one to them was Pill Valley’s stream. But the disciples inside glared at them menacingly. They clearly would not welcome them.

On the other side was the Corrupt path’s stream, and there was even less chance that they could go there. The disciples from the neutral factions looked at them scornfully, also not accepting traitors.

The ancient races, the Xuan Beasts, the ancient family alliance always treated them coldly. They wouldn’t share their qi flow streams with them.

There were some smaller streams, but they were unwilling to go there. They were lost. The world was so big, but there was nowhere for them to go. They felt like they had lost their home. The sea demon race had forcibly occupied their territory, and they didn’t even dare to make a sound. They felt like the world had discarded them.

“Come here. After all, we were once a family. Once the qi flow eruption is over, you can leave again.” Ye Lingshan’s voice rang out, causing those disciples’ hearts to shake. They stared at her in disbelief.

They had betrayed the Martial Heaven Alliance, so they hadn’t expected that the Martial Heaven Alliance would extend a hand to them. Furthermore, for Ye Lingshan to say they had once been family, they were too ashamed to even go.

“Just come. If you miss this chance, you’ll be too weak. When the powerful enemies come, how will you protect the people you want to protect? The Righteous path is a family. Although you’ve left the Martial Heaven Alliance, you are still disciples of the Righteous path. We fight for justice, to protect the people we love. Even though our paths are different, our goals are the same. Come!” said Ye Lingshan.

Even Qu Jianying was shocked that Ye Lingshan would say such a thing. Ye Lingshan had always detested the sects that had betrayed them. But now she was actually inviting them over.

Qu Jianying slowly smiled. She now saw another kind of charisma from Ye Lingshan. She had grown up.

The disciples behind Ye Lingshan weren’t quite happy. They also hated these traitors, but they endured it and didn’t say anything.

At this moment, Yu Xiaoyun’s expression changed as he thought of something.

“I, Zhao Qingyun, swear before all the experts of the world to rejoin the Martial Heaven Alliance. I pledge my undying loyalty to sister Lingshan. If I betray this oath, let me forever be damned to hell and never reincarnate.” One disciple took the lead, tearing off the mark of his sect from his robes and walking over to the Martial Heaven Alliance’s side.

Following that disciple, countless other disciples also swore their loyalty and rushed over to the Martial Heaven Alliance’s side.

Yu Xiaoyun immediately shouted, “Don’t be impetuous, you can come to Pill Valley’s stream!”

“Fuck your Pill Valley, don’t think you can con me any longer. I can see your true face now. All that nonsense about thinking about the Martial Heaven Continent and the lives on the continent was bullshit. Go home and eat shit,” shouted one disciple amongst the crowd.

“Li Cang, get back here! Are you not going to listen to your master’s words?!” shouted one elder at his disciple.

“A person with no morals who can be bought by Pill Valley isn’t fit to be my master. Having kowtowed to your sect is my life’s greatest shame,” responded that disciple. “If it weren’t for you, how could we end up in such a position, abandoned by everyone?”

Li Cang then tore off an arm.

“I, Li Cang, hereby sever my ties with the Clear Sea Gate. This arm was a medal of my sect, but today I swear to never use it again.”

A rune sealed the wound, making sure it wouldn’t regrow. That disciple’s actions moved countless Righteous experts. He actually destroyed the grace that his sect had given him. It could be seen just how disappointed he was in his sect and master.

Many of the disciples on the Martial Heaven Alliance’s side felt their hatred vanish after seeing that display. They suddenly thought of a certain thing. Those sects that had betrayed the Martial Heaven Alliance were led by the sect leaders. Their disciples were mostly innocent.

To be a disciple receiving a master’s kindness was not something light. Cutting that tie could not be done casually. The Martial Heaven Alliance’s disciples started to feel sympathy for them.

Li Cang was immediately embraced by another expert. That person said, “Brother, welcome home. All the people here are your life and death brothers.”

Li Cang was so moved that he wept, warming other people’s hearts. Hundreds of thousands of disciples now joined the Martial Heaven Alliance’s side. No matter how their elders shouted or cursed at them, not one of them left.

Ye Lingshan’s kindness had won them over. They swore to themselves that even if they had to die, they would not betray the Martial Heaven Alliance.

The old man and Qu Jianying exchanged a smile. Ye Lingshan had a different style than Qu Jianying, but she was also capable of making people fervently loyal to her.

Ye Lingshan looked at Long Chen and saw him wink at her and raise a thumb.

Ye Lingshan smiled. Just now, Long Chen had given her a nudge to do this. At that time, she had felt a bit unwilling because she truly did hate traitors. But now she understood. The label of traitor couldn’t be tacked onto just anyone. Using just her heart to judge things would give her a skewed vision.

These new disciples all looked at her with eyes full of gratitude and warmth. That was an extremely moving feeling.

“Steady yourselves. Don’t get too emotional, or you’ll miss out on this chance. Quickly break through your shackles!” reminded Ye Lingshan.

“Yes!”

All the Martial Heaven Alliance’s disciples, old and new, cried out in unison. Finally, there was a sense of unity amongst them.

With every blink of an eye, thousands of experts broke through a realm.

“Not good!” Qu Jianying’s expression suddenly changed.
