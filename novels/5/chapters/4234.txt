Chapter 4223 Internal Disorder

Millions of Devil Eye Water Lily experts vanished at the same time, causing a lot of onlookers to jump in fright.

BOOM!

Suddenly, the void exploded, and a giant willow tree soared into the heavens, its willow branches tearing through the void.

The next moment, the Devil Eye Water Lily experts reappeared from the ruptured space, their teleportation forcibly interrupted.

The laws of the Grand Dao quivered in front of this enormous willow, flowing around it like a waterfall. Everyone could see Liu Ruyan standing in front of this enormous willow, coldly looking at those Devil Eye Water Lily experts.

“Lian Wuying. I know you’ve never acknowledged me. I also know that your Devil Eye Water Lily race has been restless lately, wanting to find a chance to compete with my Undying Willow race. Let us be more direct then. There’s no need for pointless little moves. We can directly fight and see who is the real king of the Undying race.”

Chu Yao slowly moved beside Liu Ruyan, and the Undying Willow race’s experts also stepped forward.

Although they numbered only a few hundred thousand, less than a tenth of the Devil Eye Water Lily race, they didn’t reveal the slightest trace of fear. In fact, not even a trace of nervousness could be seen on their faces.

Liu Ruyan’s expression was completely calm in front of Lian Wuying’s provocation. She directly challenged her.

“Hahaha, good, then let’s see who is the real king of the Undying race. Just relying on what your ancestors left for you, did you think that your Undying Willow race could be king forever?!” sneered Lian Wuying.

Lian Wuying then raised her voice and shouted, “Starting today, my Devil Eye Water Lily race is on opposite sides of the Undying Willow race! There cannot be two kings at one time! Today, we will settle things once and for all! My Devil Eye Water Lily race has been accumulating power for billions of years to regain our dignity! We’ve suffered in silence all this time, and what you’ve seen is nothing more than the tip of the iceberg. On the other hand, the Undying Willow race has long since lost its former glory, but they are still lost in the past! Did you think that wearing a crown would make you the eternal king of the Undying race? It’s very obvious whose side you should choose! My Devil Eye Water Lily race will not accept neutrality! Follow me and prosper, defy me and die! Your choice will decide your life and death!”

Lian Wuying’s voice echoed throughout heaven and earth, eclipsing even the roaring of the dark creatures.

No one had expected the terrifying Undying race to suddenly fracture at this moment. It seemed that they were going to have a decisive battle soon.

Other than the devil race, which was attacked by the dark creatures, all the other races were staring at them in shock. They didn’t even understand what was going on.

“Now there will be a good show,” chortled one person. After all, this had nothing to do with them. People who liked watching the fun were never afraid of a bigger mess.

In a bit, some of the Undying race’s experts began to move toward Lian Wuying. The Undying race hadn’t come with as many people as the other races, but they still had close to a hundred million experts here.

Unexpectedly, seventy percent of those experts actually chose to side with the Devil Eye Water Lily race.

What was most astonishing was the speed and decisiveness with which they made this choice. It appeared as though they had pledged their allegiance to the Devil Eye Water Lily race long before this day.

People turned to Liu Ruyan, only to see that her face remained indifferent. She didn’t reveal the slightest trace of anger, let alone any hints of panic. It was as if everything was within her expectations.

Under Lian Wuying’s pressure and threat, she remained expressionless, as if completely disdaining to respond or counterattack.

“Hahaha, do you see? Your Undying Willow race has lost the trust of the Undying race! Everyone has left you! The result is decided!” Lian Wuying raised her head and laughed. Over seventy percent of the Undying race’s experts were standing on the side of the Devil Eye Water Lily race. On the other hand, the Undying Willow race’s side comprised only around twenty-five percent of the Undying race’s experts. The power disparity was immense.

“How stupid. Since when is the leadership position in our Undying race determined by democracy? Have you forgotten how the Undying Willow race used the corpses of trillions of experts to claim the throne? We killed until the heavens darkened and the rivers of blood flowed. We didn’t need the people to approve of our position. At that time, those like you could only kneel toward us and beg for our protection,” sneered Liu Ruyan.

“Ha, times have already changed, and you are still ensnared by the past. Today, I will wake you from that dream. The era of your Undying Willow race is long gone. With your pitiful numbers, you dare to say such big words? Are you trying to make everyone laugh to death?” mocked Lian Wuying.

“Pitiful numbers? Are you blind? Do you not see all the people by Long Chen’s side?” asked Liu Ruyan curiously.

“What are you talking about?” demanded Lian Wuying.

Long Chen and the others were also startled.

Liu Ruyan said, “Although that fellow is dislikable, if you dare to attack me, he will definitely slaughter his way here. Even on his own, he can exterminate all of you, not to count his unrivaled Dragonblood Legion. And yet you dare to belittle our numbers?”

“What the fuck?” Long Chen almost fell to the ground. Before this, she had said that she would crush anyone who wanted to kill him, causing him to feel moved for the first time.

However, this turned out to be a plot to ask for his aid at this moment. Furthermore, her calculations were truly accurate. If these people dared to attack her, he would immediately aid her because Chu Yao was right there. Anyone who dared to harm the woman he cherished would undoubtedly face his unrelenting fury. However, just when did Liu Ruyan become so cunning?

“Hahaha, the great Undying Willow race is actually asking for aid from the inferior human race? You’ve lost all the face of the Undying race!” Lian Wuying laughed.

“Long Chen, she just called you inferior. Aren’t you going to beat her up?” Liu Ruyan turned to Long Chen.

“I don’t mind being called inferior. But if she dares to attack, I will help you pull off her head. If anyone dares to touch a single hair on Chu Yao’s body, I will make them suffer for eternity,” responded Long Chen.

That response made Chu Yao’s body quiver, and tears almost overflowed from her eyes. She felt like she was back in the Phoenix Cry Empire, to the time when they had first made their promise.

“The Dragon swims across the four seas, the Phoenix flies throughout the nine lands; seas of blood may block us, but we will never give up our path; Dragon and Phoenix will both live to old age!”Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

Long Chen was still that hot-blooded youth, the fool who would protect her until the end of time, the rash man who would risk his life for her at any time. Hearing this, Chu Yao almost wept.

“Alright, then let’s see what kind of ability the little human race has!”

Lian Wuying snorted and raised her hand. Upon her signal, millions of Undying experts roared and launched their attack.

At that moment, Long Chen almost stepped forward.
