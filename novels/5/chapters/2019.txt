Long Chen’s heartbeat quickened. He began to secretly store up energy, ready to charge out immediately.

Blood splattered and a Life Star disciple was slain by the grand formation. Once again, another faker had been found.

As for Long Chen, the Elder checking his tablet returned it to him. Looking at him, he narrowed his eyes. “It seems that you’re quite calm!”

“Hmph, I’ve passed the barbarian dragon trials, so do you think this little formation scares me?” sneered Long Chen.

In truth, Long Chen’s heart had dropped. He had actually revealed some clues in his true identity just now. Normally, he should have jumped in shock from that, as that was instinct. But by forcing himself to act calm, he instead drew suspicion.

The Elder shouted, “It doesn’t matter what status you have or where you’re from! Remember that this is Pill Valley, not your Barbarian Dragon Palace!”

Long Chen’s arrogance had provoked the Elder. Long Chen silently took back his tablet without saying anything. He did it on purpose to provoke the Elder and distract others.

Peacefully entering, Long Chen followed the others that had passed. He had a bad feeling, but having come, he could only keep going.

As for the experts that had yet to go through the examination, they were growing more and more nervous. They were ready to fight for when Long Chen was exposed.

However, in the end, other than a few dozen people that were killed while trying to sneak in, there was nothing else. Where was Long Chen?

In the face of their suspicion, the elder leading them said, “In truth, we were just joking with everyone. As long as Long Chen isn’t an idiot, he wouldn’t dare to come here. After all, would he dare to become enemies with everyone here?”

Hearing that as well as seeing his smirk, the experts were speechless. They had actually been duped. They snorted, dissatisfied with this little joke. After all, they were all experts who had originally hoped to see Long Chen. But after all that anticipation, they were let down.

However, this was Pill Valley’s territory, and they had to endure. They continued onwards.

Once they reached the main plaza, Long Chen found that the current Pill Valley was completely different from what it had been the last time he was here.

Of course it wasn’t the same. Back then, he had drawn out an Alldevil monster from the Heaven Dragon Flame Region that had almost destroyed Pill Valley. If Yu Xiaoyun hadn’t been disturbed out of his seclusion, Pill Valley would probably have been done for.

Pill Valley had been completely rebuilt. All the bricks were fresh, and it looked thriving and full of vitality.

“When I have time, I’ll make sure to fix this. This style doesn’t suit my personal aesthetics.” Long Chen had a new thought as he looked at the new buildings.

Just as all the experts arrived, the plaza’s grand formation activated and waves of divine light rippled out. Within that divine light, a slender figure slowly appeared. It was the peerless beauty, the Pill Fairy.

The experts that had been whispering amongst themselves instantly fell silent in the face of this beauty.

Long Chen looked at the Pill Fairy. She looked the same as before, except the warmth and gentleness of her face had vanished. Now she seemed untouchably sacred.

The feeling of a kind big sister had vanished, replaced with the iciness of a supreme figure high and above others.

Her robes were snow-white, and there was a foot-wide halo of light behind her head. That halo was filled with divine power. The sacred air that came off of it made people have an urge to kneel in worship before her.

Looking at the Pill Fairy, Long Chen did his best to control his emotions, but he couldn’t help feeling disappointed. The current Pill Fairy was no longer the old Pill Fairy. She had changed.

The Pill Fairy gracefully walked over. That beauty and air of hers was enough to make men lose their minds and women despair at their inferiority.

“Great divine daughter, please open the gate to the Brahma secret realm for us,” said the Netherpassage elder of Pill Valley. The current Pill Fairy’s status was completely different, and everyone from Pill Valley was subservient to her.

The Pill Fairy’s expression was cold. She slowly formed hand seals in front of her, and divine light began to shine. After that, an image of a white flame appeared on her forehead. Long Chen had seen it before, but this time it possessed endless holy might.

She began to chant. It was the same voice as before, but now it was completely cold. “Lord Brahma, great god, hear your disciple’s call. Bestow me your divine power to break the seal and open the gate to the Brahma secret realm!” Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

Each of her words rang out like rumbling thunder in people’s ears, shaking people’s souls. Even Long Chen’s expression changed.

“Just what kind of power is this?” Long Chen’s heart shook. This invisible energy was almost irresistible.

“This is the power of the gods, and this is just the slightest trace of it. If it was a true god, with your current cultivation base, you wouldn’t be able to do anything. If that god told you to kill yourself, you would listen without hesitation,” said Evilmoon.

“Fuck, is it really so strong? Then what about my piss...?”

“It has nothing to do with that. Do you think a god only leaves behind a single inheritance? Let me tell you, they leave behind so many inheritances that they can’t even keep track of them. As for this god power, it isn’t the power of a true god. It is an agglomeration of faith energy, mental energy, and their divine energy. To put it more simply, this isn’t the true power of a god. A god won’t focus their attention on such a place, unless you destroy one of their divine statues that has reached a certain level. Furthermore, why do you care about gods? You’re someone who has even subdued a god, remember? If they were to come looking for you, you can just do the same to them,” chortled Evilmoon.

“Scram. I still haven’t reached the point of not differentiating between men and women,” snorted Long Chen.

“Hehe, let me tell you, your actions last time weren’t for nothing. As for how it’ll benefit you, well, I think I won’t say to avoid any karma, but you’ll know in the future,” laughed Evilmoon.

Just at this moment, two rays of divine light came from the two divine statues, landing on the Pill Fairy. Immersed in their light, the Pill Fairy slowly pulled her hands apart from each other.

The void rumbled. In front of everyone’s dumbfounded gazes, the space above the plaza slowly split, and the runes of the Grand Dao flew apart. The Pill Fairy had actually forcibly torn apart the void.

What they saw inside the tear was not the chaotic flow of spacetime, but a completely different world. However, the space was still twisting wildly, making it so that they couldn’t see the other side clearly. Despite that, the air of the Grand Dao floated through it.

“Heavens, the laws of the Grand Dao are actually so close! It’ll be so much easier to comprehend them inside and awaken our manifestations!” Someone let out an excited cry, but no one laughed at them. The others were also filled with excitement.

The Pill Fairy didn’t look at anyone else. She gracefully walked through space, lotus flower runes appearing beneath her feet. Those runes stabilized the space.

“Everyone, don’t rush. Wait for the divine daughter to pass through. The channel will quickly stabilize, and everyone else can enter. But before that, I want to say a few words. The divine daughter is the future valley master. You’ve all seen her power. Long Chen is an ant that can be exterminated with the wave of her hand,” said the elder. “In truth, Pill Valley’s foundation is something that outsiders cannot even imagine. The reason we are willing to share the Brahma secret realm with everyone is because our goal is to bring peace to the entire continent. Due to Qu Jianying’s dictatorship, the continent is tottering on the brink of war, and there’s also a devil king like Long Chen causing chaos. They are in control of a large fraction of the continent’s power. Those people have been bewitched by Long Chen and Qu Jianying, and it’s difficult to save them. There are plenty of fools in this world who only hear what they want to hear. Long Chen has fooled those people, but they are unable to tell that Long Chen is a conner. However, they are innocent, and my Pill Valley does not want to raise our butcher’s blade against them. That would cause rivers of blood to flow. So we need to strengthen our alliance until we can win them over without fighting. We will use absolute power to make them give up. You’ve all seen the world on the other side of the channel. The Grand Dao is much closer there. Once you enter, the odds of you awakening your manifestations will multiply. You’ve seen our sincerity, so I hope to see yours as well. Before entering the channel, you must swear before the gods. Neutral experts must swear to maintain your neutrality, while allied experts must swear their loyalty to the alliance. Of course, if any neutral experts wish to join our alliance, we have special treatment for you. Everyone, take a look.”

The elder took out a small object. When Long Chen saw it, he scoffed. They were once more shamelessly making the same play.
