Chapter 2565 Will We Die?

“This time, I’ve profited immensely!”

Long Chen was in a private room, looking at the bronze fragment. It was shining brightly with divine light.

Long Chen had made an excuse that he needed to recover from his wounds, but in reality he had come to look at this treasure.

Using the fragment of the Eastern Wasteland Bell, Long Chen had broken the counterfeit. When it broke, the sealed Source Qi inside of it flowed out and was absorbed by the fragment. The suction of the fragment was why the Ye family head had been unable to stop the leak no matter what he tried.

The Source Qi originally belonged to the Eastern Wasteland Bell, so the fragment’s suction was returning the Source Qi to its home.

There was now a new complete rune on the fragment, and it seemed to contain the flow of time within it. It was as if all changes of all living things could be seen within it. It possessed terrifying power.

Long Chen made a light swing with the fragment, and thin cracks appeared within the void. This fragment’s power was now astonishing.

“It’s too bad that it’s just a fragment. It can’t acknowledge you as master,” said Evilmoon.

“It’s fine. I feel like I’ll run into the Eastern Wasteland Bell sooner or later. I can return the fragment then. Hehe, even if I don't know how to use it, I can use it as a concealed weapon. Perhaps I can break other divine items with it. Furthermore, even if it doesn’t have any uses, just the expression of the Ye family head when I broke his fake was delightful,” snickered Long Chen.

“You still feel like laughing? I am actually worrying about you,” said Evilmoon.

“Worrying? About what?”

“You forcibly changed such a terrifying cultivation technique, and you’ll need to create your own cultivation path now. Do you realize just how difficult creating a cultivation technique is? A technique like the Nine Star Hegemon Body Art would only come to be after going through thousands of revisions and countless tests, and you have deviated from its path. Do you still feel like you can cultivate it to its end? Let’s take your World Extermination Flame Lotus as an example. Do you feel like you can condense it with a deviated path? Even if you could, it would require being different from the very start, not starting with the same foundation and then suddenly changing halfway. That’s even more difficult than creating it from scratch. Right now, you should be pondering about how you can return to the correct path while you still haven’t deviated too far. Perhaps there’s still time,” said Evilmoon.

Evilmoon might have an even greater grasp of just how terrifying the Nine Star Hegemon Body Art was compared to Long Chen. Seeing Long Chen laughing like this, it couldn’t bear to keep watching.

“I’ll create my own path. Who can say whether it’s a blessing or disaster? I rather like the feeling of leaving everything up to myself. My fate is in my own hands now,” said Long Chen.

For some reason, the suffocating feeling in Long Chen’s heart had been lifted after he had deviated from the Nine Star Hegemon Body Art’s normal path.

It was like he had been sitting in someone else’s chariot before and forced to go wherever the chariot had been carrying him. Now, he was the one pulling the chariot. Although the path ahead was covered in mist, it was also full of hope. Long Chen liked this feeling of opportunity being found within danger. He liked having his fate in his own hands.

In one of his dreams, he had seen an expert summon the Nine Star Battle Armor. That person had had a divine ring with nine stars within it, and it wasn’t that different from the Six Star Battle Armor. Theoretically, the seventh and eighth stars should be the same just like that.

He could continue according to that pattern when he condensed more stars. Hence, he didn’t feel that much pressure.

Due to gradually becoming accustomed to the power of the Six Star Battle Armor, he was even able to fight so long against Jiang Wuchen. Although his body had been constantly damaged from the heavy strain, the constant flow of life energy from the Heavenly Qilin Demon Trees meant that he could easily exhaust his opponent.

The Heavenly Qilin Demon Trees were an ocean of life energy. He had used up less than a hundredth of their life energy for his last battle.

Furthermore, after reaching this level of maturity, the Heavenly Qilin Demon Trees came to possess their own self-restorative properties. This little bit of exhaustion would be recovered in a few days. Therefore, even if he had to face all four Sovereign sprouts again, he was full of confidence.

He had originally been prepared to fight all four of them at once and use a method of exchanging wounds for wounds, depending on the Heavenly Qilin Demon Trees to outlast them. When it came to recovery ability, he believed that no one could match him.

However, he hadn’t expected things to develop as they had. So, it turned out the Martial Heaven Continent possessed such powerful reserves. The High Priest, Daoist Heavenly Feather, and the Music Master had all hidden themselves deeply.

Long Chen continued examining the bronze fragment for a while. After confirming that he really couldn’t control it, he finally put it away again.

After that, he gathered the Dragonblood Legion.

“Boss, are you going to lead us to slaughter the divine families?” asked Guo Ran excitedly.

“Are you annoyed that you didn’t get to show off at all this time?” Long Chen was speechless. When did this little fellow become so warlike?

“Boss, you misunderstood me. I feel like we have to show off a bit of power in order to match your grandeur,” flattered Guo Ran.

“Is that not just wanting to show off?” Long Chen flapped his hand at Guo Ran. “You’ll have plenty of chances to show off in the future. The main thing is to have the power to do so. You said in the Star Field Divine World that the new armor is so powerful that our brothers are unable to fully unleash their power, correct?”

“Yes. The new armor was created with the full effort of myself, Xia Chen, and Zhao Ritian. We exhausted all our wits and power to create it. Who would have thought that one of us would already be sacrificed after such great service? Even now, I can’t believe it. We should have a moment of silence for his sacrifice,” said Guo Ran. He really did lower his head thoughtfully.

Long Chen had an urge to slap him. “Are you unhappy that I killed him?”

“Boss, you really shouldn’t have killed him. He was my treasure cornucopia! I wasn’t done using him.” Guo Ran looked like he was about to cry. It seemed like he really had fallen in love with Zhao Ritian.

Ever since obtaining Zhao Ritian, Guo Ran had been thinking about how to use him in the future. Hence, when Long Chen had crushed him in his anger, Guo Ran had felt immense grief. To use his words, Zhao Ritian was his.

Seeing Guo Ran’s mournful expression, everyone laughed, but they also felt that his death was a pity. He was an inexhaustible mountain of immortal metal, so it was especially painful for Guo Ran to lose him.

However, because it was Long Chen who had killed him, Guo Ran couldn’t say anything. He could only use this method to express his resentment at Long Chen’s barbaric methods.

“Even if that old bitch didn’t force me to, I would still have to kill Zhao Ritian. You couldn’t use him any longer,” said Long Chen.

“Why is that?”

“Guo Ran, Xia Chen, there is a faint mark on your foreheads now. Have you not sensed it?” said Long Chen.

Everyone was startled and looked toward Xia Chen and Guo Ran. After a close examination, they truly did notice a vague black mark.

It looked to be dust but was growing within their flesh. It was very faint, almost imperceptible.

“What is this?” Guo Ran jumped. He then wiped his forehead hard. As he rubbed, faint patterns appeared on his skin, looking like roots. They quickly faded.

Xia Chen did the same, and both of them were shocked, not knowing what was going on. But it definitely wasn’t something good.

“Zhao Ritian possessed a terrifying ability that could destroy the entire world. If he did absorb the entire world’s immortal metal, it would cause the collapse of the world. Every world has its own laws, and it will not permit existences that can threaten it. That’s why Zhao Ritian did not dare to absorb so much immortal metal that it would damage the world’s foundation. Otherwise, he would be cursed by the world. Zhao Ritian had constantly wandered through many worlds, absorbing a bit of immortal metal from every world to avoid such a curse. Did you not find it curious? If Zhao Ritian possessed such a terrifying ability, why did he not absorb an infinite amount of immortal metal?” said Long Chen.

Everyone came to a sudden realization. That was true. If Zhao Ritian recklessly absorbed all the immortal metal from multiple worlds, no one could stop him.

“That fellow was quite sinister. Because he was the one forced to absorb the immortal metal, ninety-nine percent of the curse was absorbed by the two of you. Fortunately, since you were doing this to help the Dragonblood Legion create new equipment, the curse was split amongst the entire Dragonblood Legion. If it wasn’t for the fact that so many people were sharing the curse at once, the two of you would have long since died,” said Long Chen.

“Boss… why didn’t you tell us sooner?!” exclaimed Guo Ran.

“This was told to me by Ling Xi. Because the Star Field Divine World is a masterless and fractured world, the will of the world has weakened to the point that the curse is not very powerful. With it being shared by so many people, it’s not dangerous. But now that we’re back on the Martial Heaven Continent, the laws of the world would not permit Zhao Ritian to recklessly absorb its immortal metal. So Zhao Ritian has already lost his use. To eliminate him in front of the divine families is the best choice. It’s satisfying, relieves anger, and can even be called perfect, hehe,” laughed Long Chen.

“Boss, but what about our curse? Will we die?” asked Guo Ran fearfully. He didn’t know if it was just in his mind or not, but he felt like his head was swelling, and he was feeling cold.

Long Chen was silent for a moment. He finally sighed, “Yes.”
