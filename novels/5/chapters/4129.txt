Chapter 4118: Righteous Chivalry

“Long Chen, you should take it. Brand your Spiritual Strength on it, and then you will be above the Heavenly Daos of this world.” Xu Jianxiong handed the star-field core to Long Chen.

Long Chen received the star-field core. Sensing the fluctuations coming from it, he felt a touch of pain.

Looking at this star-field core, he thought of the Martial Heaven Continent. The Martial Heaven Continent had given up everything to protect the lifeforms on it. She was kind and selfless, worthy of the greatest admiration.

Unafraid of death, she only wished for the lifeforms of the Martial Heaven Continent to continue living on. She had begged Long Chen, and he had promised to protect the Martial Heaven Continent.

However, he had failed. The Martial Heaven Continent was destroyed, and he had not managed to protect her. Although the Martial Heaven Continent’s lifeforms had been moved to safety, the core of the star-field died.

That was the greatest sorrow in Long Chen’s heart. Looking at this core, he shook his head.

“How can I be qualified to force her? I hope that she can remain in control of this world. If one day I die in battle, this world will still live on. That would be good too.”

Long Chen let go. The crystal merged into this world just like that.

“You…!?” Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

Xu Jianxiong was shocked. Long Chen hadn’t forced the star-field core to recognize him as master. In that case, there was no way that he could control this world. In other words, they had fought for this world for nothing.

Just then, golden divine radiance illuminated this world, gathering around Long Chen. The divine light of the world’s karmic luck concentrated entirely on him.

“This is…!” Xu Jianxiong was even more shocked now. Long Chen had given up on being the master of this world, but the star-field’s core was actually placing all of this world’s karmic luck on him. This could be considered another kind of master acknowledgment.

Even with all of Xu Jianxiong’s experience and learning, he had never seen such a thing. The core of a star-field possessed its own spirit. Although its memories had been erased, due to the destruction of the star-field, all that remained was this core. It was like someone who was killed and all that remained of them was their heart.

Deep in its soul, it was filled with pain and hatred. If someone were to not be its master and instead allowed it to rule a world, it would be very dangerous.

However, Long Chen gave up on forcing it to recognize him as master. Yet, even after the core gained control over this world, rather than unleashing its hatred on them, it actually supported Long Chen with all of its power.

With the support of this karmic luck, Long Chen felt like he had become one with the heavens. When his soul merged with this world, its warmth reached toward him.

As long as he wished it, he could mobilize this world’s entire power. Long Chen smiled. That smile was just like that of a naive child.

The world grew warmer with that smile, and the sky grew clearer. It was as if the world was smiling along with him.

Long Chen then closed his eyes and spread his arms. With his heart, he embraced this world.

“As long as I am alive, you will never suffer that pain again. Believe in me. I promise,” murmured Long Chen.

Long Chen knew that the star-field core could hear him. However, it was too weak and could only use spatial fluctuations to express its feelings.

It trusted Long Chen fully as he opened his inner heart to it. As their souls resonated, Long Chen experienced its pain, and it experienced Long Chen’s.

“We all need to get stronger!”

Buzz.

Following his words, the void rumbled, causing more and more spiritual qi to pour into the world. As a result, the density of spiritual qi in this world crazily grew.

“I really don’t dare to believe it. The star-field core actually trusts you like this.” Xu Jianxiong couldn’t help sighing emotionally.

Although they had taken control over the Silver Moon World and three other minor worlds, even the Silver Moon World’s core which had been with them for countless years didn’t trust them like this.

As this world’s power continued to increase, Long Chen would be an unrivaled existence here because he was in control over this entire world’s power. That was something that countless people would dream of obtaining.

The Fullmoon race had taken three minor worlds and also wished for such a thing. If they could produce three peerless heavenly geniuses who could receive the acknowledgment of the three worlds, they would also gain their power.

Then with four worlds, the Fullmoon race’s power would soar to an unimaginable level. Regretfully, not even Xu Jianxiong was able to obtain the acknowledgment of any star-field core.

As for Long Chen, he directly received the acknowledgment of his star-field core, a feat that left Xu Jianxiong dumbfounded and admittedly envious.

At this moment, Guo Ran and Xia Chen were smiling widely and dancing excitedly. This dense spiritual qi, this closeness to the Heavenly Daos, it was like adding wings to tigers. Both of them were so moved that they almost wept.

Yu Qingxuan was also moved. Previously, she had been very envious of the Silver Moon World, but this place was even more perfect, feeling like home.

“With the acknowledgment of the Heavenly Daos, we can condense supreme transportation formations! We’ll be able to go directly from the Nirvana Overflow Heaven to the life-forbidden area!” declared Xia Chen.

“However, our wealth is almost used up.” Guo Ran immediately frowned. In order to create that grand formation, Xia Chen had used up all his resources.

Now that they had claimed this world, there were many things that they needed to gather again. After all, many of their things could not be reused.

Even if they could reuse a portion of them, compared to a transportation formation capable of transcending heavens, it would be only a drop in the bucket. Most importantly, they also needed to set up many other defenses to guard against the dark creatures.

Hearing this, Xia Chen felt like a bucket of ice water had been poured over him. Money really was a major problem.

“What are you afraid of? Doesn’t your boss have a trading company?” Yu Qingxuan covered a smile.

“The Huayun Trading Company? But we don’t have that much left to trade with them,” said Xia Chen.

“Aiya!” Guo Ran suddenly slapped his leg excitedly.

“What is it?” asked Xia Chen hastily.

“That trading company is my home! All their treasures can be taken at any time! Have you forgotten?” reminded Guo Ran.

“The Soaring Dragon Company!” Xia Chen instantly jumped up. He had actually forgotten about the Soaring Dragon Company.

Plundering was the fastest shortcut to wealth. Most importantly, the Soaring Dragon Company had done countless terrible things that Long Chen and the others didn’t feel the slightest burden to their conscience when plundering them. Just the matter of sacrificing people’s lives made the Soaring Dragon Company deserve a thousand deaths. In fact, plundering them could be considered a righteous act; robbing them was only right.

“Boss, you cultivate here! We’re going to right the wrong of evil! Brothers, after training for so long, it's time to put it to good use! Move out!”

Guo Ran quickly gave orders, and the Dragonblood warriors excitedly chased after him.

“Hey!”

Long Chen didn’t even get a chance to reply before those fellows ran off on their own accord.

“The Sage King Convention is about to start! Don’t do anything crazy! Try to exercise some restraint!”

Guo Ran responded, “Don’t worry, I’ll just say that I’m Mo Nian!”

“...”
