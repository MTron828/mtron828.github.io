Chapter 2757 Imminent Peril

As Evilmoon appeared in Long Chen’s hand, starlight flashed on top of it. However, he wasn’t sure that he could pass through Gui Si’s blockade.

Gui Si was an existence that had once fought Sovereign Zi Yang for three days and nights. Although he had fallen from his position as a Sovereign, his power was still terrifying. Not even Ye Ming was equal to him.

Right now, Gui Si wanted to win time for Ye Ming, allowing Resentful Death City to enter the Martial Heaven Continent and have Ye Ming become a true Sovereign. Those layers of light he condensed in front of him gave Long Chen a sense of powerful pressure.

However, just at that moment, Yue Zifeng’s voice rang out. Startled, Long Chen saw a heaven-shaking Sword Qi slash through the air, emitting rays of golden light.

When this sword fell, the vast sky resonated and Gui Si’s layers of obstructions were slashed apart.

“Boss, quick!” shouted Yue Zifeng.

“Brother, be careful.” Long Chen nodded and rushed through the opening, lightning wings flapping on his back.

“A sword cultivator? Gui Si was startled. He had once been a Sovereign, and although his realm had fallen from its peak, he still managed to control a trace of that supreme power. This power had transcended the limits of this world, so in order to fight against it, you had to possess another kind of transcendent power. He hadn’t expected Yue Zifeng to be able to pierce his barriers.

A sword cultivator was said to possess the greatest offensive power of all cultivators. Their attacks were incomparably sharp, making them impossible to block. One reason for that was that the Sword Dao’s will lay above the ten thousand Daos of the world. It was not under the restrictions of the laws of the Heavenly Daos. Hence, it could also be considered a kind of transcendent power.

“Who are you?” demanded Gui Si. He wished to know what background this person had.

“Long Chen’s subordinate, the Dragonblood Legion’s fourth captain, Yue Zifeng.”

Yue Zifeng flew through the air, his sword shining brilliantly. At this moment, the wind and clouds changed color and the nine heavens shuddered. The incomparably sharp will of the Sword Dao radiated, completely unaffected by Gui Si’s pressure.

“Not a reincarnation, or a rebirth, or a body-seizer. It really is just a peerless genius. Hehe, it just so happens that I like killing geniuses.” Gui Si laughed sinisterly and waved his staff. After that, the void split apart and a giant bone claw smashed down from the heavens.

“Boundless Sword, One With the Cosmos.”

An image of a sword appeared in Yue Zifeng’s eyes. At the next moment, a giant manifestation of a lotus composed of ten thousand swords appeared behind him. His aura suddenly changed, as if a sword had been unsheathed.

Yue Zifeng was not a Celestial or an Empyrean, so no one had ever seen his manifestation before. But exactly because of that, the appearance of this ten-thousand-sword lotus caused everyone to jump.

His sword slashed into the giant bone claw. As a result, the bone claw was blown back, while Yue Zifeng’s body also swayed.

“He blocked it!” Guo Ran and the others were delighted. Yue Zifeng was truly strong. A few days ago, Ling Yunzi had brought him to seclusion. Now, it seemed that his combat power had exploded to an extremely terrifying level.

“Don’t just stand around foolishly! We’ll slaughter these undying ghosts!” shouted Gu Yang. The endless army of the Undying race had almost reached the front.

“Not a single one will pass by me.” Liu Ruyan summoned her true body. A giant willow tore into the heavens, her crown covering the entire battlefield.

After that, branches shot down like bolts of lightning, and the Undying warriors were instantly blasted apart when struck.

Liu Ruyan’s cultivation base had risen and so had her size. Her divine abilities had also grown more terrifying. As the Undying Willow race could be considered the emperor of the Undying race, Liu Ruyan possessed a powerful suppressive effect against them.

The Undying race’s experts normally didn’t have much of a sense of pain, but when her branches pierced through their bodies, they howled crazily. White smoke came from their bodies, and they quickly corroded.

“The others are also attacking!” shouted Meng Qi.

The world shuddered. The experts of Devil Spirit Mountain, the Ancient Battlefield, and the Yin Yang World were attacking as well. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

A giant Kunpeng shattered the sky and a giant bone mountain appeared. That was also a sacrificial altar.

At this moment, there was a person sitting at the center of this altar. Countless runes revolved around him, and his aura rapidly climbed.

This was the demonic beast race’s genius, the Nine-Headed Lion. His entire body looked as if it had been made of gold. He was borrowing the power of the white bone altar to cultivate.

“Hmph, despicable corpses of the Undying race, since you want to play dirty, we can all play.”

The Kunpeng Emperor gave the order, and countless demonic beasts charged out of the Ancient Battlefield.

BOOM!

At this moment, the gate to the Yin Yang World crumbled and a giant altar also appeared there, but this altar had an egg on it.

Atop the egg sat the Blood Fiend Devil Lord. An endless stream of energy poured into both of them through the altar.

“You’re not the only ones with trump cards. My Blood race has been waiting for over a hundred thousand years to reap this fruit from this world. You want to obtain the star-field core? Then let’s see if you have that ability. Blood race warriors, kill! Kill all the lifeforms of the Martial Heaven Continent!” shouted the Blood race’s Emperor.

Devil Spirit Mountain’s gate also opened. However, there was no altar there but a giant coffin.

This giant coffin had strange carvings on top of it, with devil qi overflowing from it. At the front of it was a spider web clump, and at the center of that web was the Alldevil Heavenwalker. It was possible to see streams of energy flowing into him from every direction.

“How can my devil race fall behind the others?” The Devil race’s Emperor sneered and waved his hand. After that, the devil race’s experts charged out like locusts.,

The void then exploded once again and a giant immortal palace appeared in the sky. It was the divine families’ Immortal Sealing Palace.

However, contrary to the other powers, it stayed closed. It just floated there.

Hence, the invaders ignored the strange reaction of the divine families. Their armies poured onto the Martial Heaven Continent.

In the end, the entire world suddenly shuddered. At the very center of the Martial Heaven Continent, an area wrapped by light appeared.

Countless figures showed up within that light. They were the millions and millions of commoners of the Martial Heaven Continent.

People from every corner of the world had been transported here, especially those below the Netherpassage.

“Hahaha, what a superfluous move. You can’t even protect your core, yet you want to protect the commoners here?” The Kunpeng Emperor laughed.

The battle had finally started. The Martial Heaven Continent instinctively made a move to protect its innocent lives at its center.

“Chen-er?”

A startled cry rang out from the crowd.
