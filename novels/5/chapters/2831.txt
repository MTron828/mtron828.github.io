Chapter 2820 Divine Lightning Elder

The arrival of the Divine Lightning Elder made every disciple stiffen, including Mu Qingyun. This group of people didn’t just possess terrifying auras, but there was also the strong stench of blood.

Long Chen was also surprised. Ever since he had ascended to the immortal world, this was the first group of real experts he encountered, experts that had truly killed their way out of the battlefield.

Their leader was a tall and muscular middle-aged man. His face was rough, and his eyes were like copper bells. Moreover, his full beard still had some blood in it. It seemed that they had just returned from a battlefield.

His gaze instantly fell on Long Chen. His eyes widened. “Good brat. What a dense blood qi. Oh, and you also have thunderforce in your body? Hahaha, good, good!” The Divine Lightning Elder’s gaze was electric, seemingly having seen through Long Chen.

His expression hadn’t looked so good when he entered the room, but his attitude completely transformed when he saw Long Chen.

“Little fellow, I have just returned when someone told me that the Pill Institute was intentionally causing trouble to humiliate our God Institute. When I get back, I’ll definitely break that person’s legs and stick them up his butt,” cursed the Divine Lightning Elder.

Although Long Chen didn’t quite understand what was happening or what kind of rank this Divine Lightning Elder possessed, he estimated that it was not inferior to the Seven Star Elder.

Someone had clearly tried to create a conflict between him and Long Chen. Moreover, this Divine Lightning Elder did not look like someone with a good temper. As soon as he received such a report, he would go find trouble for Long Chen, and the real target was most likely the Pill Institute.

However, as soon as he saw Long Chen, he lost any faith in that person’s words. The thunderforce flowing within Long Chen’s body essentially told him what kind of character Long Chen had.

Furthermore, Long Chen could also sense a wild lightning power within the Divine Lightning Elder’s body. Then looking at his face, Long Chen sensed the pride and arrogance within his bones.

This Divine Lightning Elder was the only true lightning cultivator that Long Chen had met in his lifetime. With both of them possessing such a rare element, they instantly formed a connection.

Those who cultivated wild lightning were all direct and frank. Whatever issues they had, they would face them head-on and not stab people in the back.

Hence, the instant he saw Long Chen, the Divine Lightning Elder knew that he had been lied to. He saw that Long Chen was not the kind of person to intentionally pick a quarrel.

Furthermore, in all his years in the academy, he had only encountered a few people with the same character as him. The moment he saw that Long Chen was a lightning cultivator, he felt joy like he wished the two had met earlier.

“This junior is Long Chen. Greetings, Divine Lightning Elder.” Long Chen cupped his fists.

“What junior? We’re all men. Don’t get sucked into those useless, convoluted formalities. I am Lei Xiao. You can call me big brother Lei Xiao in the future. Haha, after so many years, I finally encountered someone to my liking. Once your cultivation base is higher, join me on the battlefield. That’s where men should be.” Lei Xiao patted Long Chen on the shoulder.

Sparks flashed where his hand touched Long Chen’s shoulder. That was a resonance between their thunderforce.

“Junior brother Long Chen greets big brother Lei Xiao.” Long Chen was also pleasantly surprised to see such a figure in the academy. Thus, hope once more ignited within him for the High Firmament Academy.

“Hahaha, good. Junior brother, I came this time to replenish my supplies, so I’m going to leave soon. It might be a while before I return, so properly cultivate during this time. I hope that the next time we meet, your mortal qi will have been expelled and you will have ignited your divine flame. At that time, your big brother will give you wine to celebrate.” Lei Xiao was delighted to see Long Chen react without any bashfulness or timidity or fawning.

“Big brother, don’t worry. I will properly cultivate, or wouldn’t that be a loss to big brother’s face?” said Long Chen confidently. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

“Haha, good. That’s the drive that you need. Until next time.” Lei Xiao patted Long Chen’s shoulder and left. He was in a rush and didn’t waste any further time.

At this moment, Mu Qingyun stared at Long Chen in amazement. Zhong Ling excitedly said, “Third brother, you really are about to soar! Do you know who the Divine Lightning Elder is? The two of you call each other brother?!”

“I really don’t know who he is,” said Long Chen.

“Heaven, Earth, Wind, Lightning. They are the four strongest Elders within the sub-institutes of the God Institute. They are our four great pillars. Even within the entire academy, they are all giant figures. With the care of the Divine Lightning Elder, your future path will definitely be smooth and easy!” exclaimed Zhong Ling.

Long Chen shook his head. “That’s not going to happen.”

“What?”

“You don’t understand his character. If I borrow his power to open a back door for myself, he’ll look down on me. The only reason he recognizes me as brother is because we have the same character. As for me, I have my own dignity as well. I use my own power to win what I have. In this world, it is not possible to always rely on others. Parents grow old, and mountains collapse. Relying on yourself is the most reliable choice. To cultivate is to create a path through mountains, to build a bridge over water. Cultivation is not necessarily just about reaching a certain height before gaining anything. The process is even more important than the result sometimes.”

Just at this moment, clapping sounds rang out, and a kind-looking old elder walked in, seemingly praising Long Chen’s words just now.

“Marvelous, truly marvelous. At such a young age, you not only possess such great combat power but can also say such deep words. It truly is rare.” The elder nodded in praise.

“Heaven Master Yun Yang! Why have you come?” Mu Qingyun and the others were startled. They hastily bowed worshipfully.

Mu Qingyun quickly gave Long Chen an introduction. “Long Chen, this is our God Institute’s Heaven Master, Yun Yang. He is the highest level teacher in our God Institute and the one with the most learning.”

“Ah, I wouldn’t dare to accept such praise. There is no end to learning. Child, you’re going to give me a big head.” Heaven Master Yun Yang laughed. He was like a kind elder, and he didn’t seem to possess any of the arrogance that a Heaven Master would possess.

“Junior greets Heaven Master. I hope to get pointers from senior in the future,” said Long Chen.

“I couldn’t. I teach philosophies on the Dao, while you are skilled in battle. You already possess a rare insight into life. If you have time, I would like to learn from you.” Heaven Master Yun Yang smiled at Long Chen so humbly that Long Chen felt a bit embarrassed.

“I came here specifically to give you your new status plate. Little brother, congratulations on passing the teacher exam. You’ve become a battle instructor. The official ceremony will take place three days from now, so don’t forget to participate.” Heaven Master Yun Yang handed a new status plate to Long Chen.

Long Chen, Mu Qingyun and the others were startled. It had passed through so quickly? Was that because of the Pill Institute or perhaps the Divine Lightning Elder?
