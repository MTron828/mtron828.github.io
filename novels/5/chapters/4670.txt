Chapter 4659 Yin Jiushang, Luo Changsheng

The voice came from a giant sphere of light containing a man, a chariot, and a skeletal horse. When he spoke, a wave of shock rippled through all the guards. They couldn't help but feel a sense of dread emanating from this figure, as if he possessed an utterly formidable origin. Moreover, the skeletal horse and bronze chariot exuded an intimidating aura that caused fine cracks in the void.

Unexpectedly, even someone of his caliber had a history with Long Chen. All eyes then turned to Long Chen.

“I’ve seen many people who boast without thinking, but you’re the only one who likes to do it on top of a horse chariot. Your emaciated horse already cries out for sustenance, yet you’re still in the mood to spew big words. I really can’t bear to watch it. You should consider selling that chariot to get some hay for your poor horse!” remarked Long Chen with indifference.

Back then, Long Chen had indeed conned him, and he knew that this petty person wouldn’t let the matter slide. However, Long Chen didn’t mind. This was just a daily occurrence in the path of cultivation.

“Hopefully, you can still act so tough in a bit. I, Yin Jiushang, declare that your life is mine,” stated that scarred man.

“Yin Jiushang[1]? You’ve been conned nine times and injured nine times? I think the first con was this terrible name your father gave you. I’m curious, other than me, who were the other eight people to con you?” asked Long Chen.

“Keep acting tough. The more arrogant you are now, the more pitiful you’ll appear soon,” Yin Jiushang sneered.

“Me, wretched? Why?” asked Long Chen. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

“You have no clue what’s going on here, yet you simply barge in. You’ve been locked down by the heavenly tribulation, yet your foolishness is beyond salvation,” replied Yin Jiushang.

“Tch

, isn’t it just a tribulation? Is it so amazing? Keep acting mysterious, you children,” scoffed Long Chen.

“Little human, it seems that you’re very confident in yourself, huh?”

Just then, another voice resounded through the air, and Long Chen instantly recognized it. The Black Rock Nine Underworld Python race’s Yan Tianhua was here.

Yan Tianhua’s lightning sphere dwarfed the others. Due to the heavenly tribulation screening everyone off, Long Chen couldn’t sense him until he spoke.

Long Chen chuckled, “Of course I’m confident. Otherwise, I wouldn’t have followed you here. I didn’t expect to see so many old friends here. Hehe, I really have to thank you. As a token of my gratitude, how about I simply pluck those two fangs of yours, and we'll call it even?”

“Hahaha!” Hearing these words, Yan Tianhua raised his head and laughed. Even the booming thunder of this world was unable to cover up his laughter.

“Interesting! Alright, I hope to have a chance to experience your skills in a bit. Let’s hope they match your arrogance,” sneered Yan Tianhua, his voice dripping with cold killing intent as Long Chen’s words had succeeded in provoking him. However, he had forgotten that Long Chen was equally infuriated by his sudden attack.

“From your tone, you don’t sound very willing. Then sorry, I take back what I said,” said Long Chen.

“Trash,” snickered Yan Tianhua, thinking that Long Chen was afraid.

“I meant that taking just two fangs isn’t sufficient anymore. I’m going to get a set of snakeskin too. Perhaps enough to craft boots for all my women, and if there's any surplus, I’ll get them a bag too,” remarked Long Chen casually, appearing to calculate the amount of snakeskin required for each item.

“You’re courting death!” roared Yan Tianhua. Long Chen’s words were an absolute blasphemy to the Black Rock Nine Underworld Python race.

“You’re quite arrogant. Hmm, you must have some good guts. I heard that snake gall is a great medicine. If a pregnant woman eats it, the child’s eyes are always particularly bright. Maybe I should get something for my future children?” Long Chen scratched his head as if considering something.

“Die!”

Yan Tianhua couldn’t endure it anymore. His lightning sphere trembled, and a bolt of lightning transformed into a spear, hurtling toward Long Chen. The lightning spear boomed with power at first, but by the time it reached Long Chen, its power was gone. Hence, Long Chen simply swatted it with his palm, shattering it.

“Oh, so everyone here is restrained by the laws of this place. Before the tribulation starts, no one can unleash their real power,” remarked Long Chen, nodding in understanding after easily swatting away this attack.

Previously, when Yu Zihao attacked him, Long Chen hadn’t paid much attention, as he assumed it was merely a probing attack. However, with Yan Tianhua’s attack, he saw it clearly. It was actually extremely powerful, but the majority of its power was sucked away by the heavenly tribulation before it could reach him.

No wonder all of them were just standing here peacefully. None of them wanted to waste the effort if they couldn’t harm anyone.

“Since you can’t attack me, hehe, let’s do this.”

With a smirk, Long Chen taunted, “I say, brother, you were already so repulsive that even your own mother couldn’t bear to look at you. But that X on your face? Is it there to remind people that you’re an imbecile who should keep his mouth shut?”

“You!” Yin Jiushang’s sphere shook, but he remained inside. His teeth clenched so tightly that they threatened to shatter. The X scar on his face was his deepest humiliation, and Long Chen's words mercilessly tore at that scab.

“What did you say? Come over and bite me if you don't like it!” Long Chen beckoned mockingly, simply asking for a beating.

“Are you Long Chen, the leader of the Dragonblood Legion?” Another voice broke the tense atmosphere, its resonance seemingly reverberating throughout heaven and earth.

Long Chen’s heart shook as he knew he couldn’t underestimate this person. Nevertheless, Long Chen brazenly retorted, “What do you think?”

“Oh, sorry. I was the one who almost destroyed your Dragonblood Legion.”

When Long Chen heard this, his gaze turned cold. He directly knew who this bastard was.

“You don’t need to be sorry. After all, I won’t be sorry when I cut off your head,” said Long Chen.

“Oh? We’ll see if you have that ability. However, I always believe that evil will never win against righteousness. Your Dragonblood Legion is a terrible group of obscene perverts. They shamelessly preyed upon the women of the Spirit race, and when my Celestial race intervened, they attempted to silence us. But rest assured, the heavens bear witness to all your vile deeds, and your wickedness cannot remain hidden forever. A person with evil in their heart cannot defeat me.” That voice rang out, filled with righteousness.

Long Chen instantly understood why Yue Zifeng’s mental realm had been disturbed during his confrontation with this person. This person’s voice actually had a bewitching art imbued in it, capable of swaying emotions effortlessly. It could easily evoke sympathy from outsiders and stoke enmity among enemies.

“Amazing. To train a bewitching voice to this realm, you must be a master of soul art,” Long Chen remarked with icy composure. He recognized that this individual was not only formidable but also cunning.

“It’s just facts. Why are you trying to make it sound like I’m lying? Are you avoiding a direct response due to your guilty conscience?” the voice retorted.

“I’ve seen many people like you. However, I am not Yue Zifeng. Your tactics are futile against me. It’s time to reveal your true abilities. Show me the strength of the Celestial race. Don't you agree, Luo Changsheng?” challenged Long Chen.

When Long Chen revealed the identity of the speaker, an uproar spread through the crowd.
