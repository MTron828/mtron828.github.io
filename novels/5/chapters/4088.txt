Chapter 4077 Disdaining to Kill

This sudden change made everyone jump. Previously, Uncle Tree had been at no disadvantage even against three Heaven Venerates, and that was already enough to shock everyone.

But now those two Heaven Venerates were only thinking of fleeing, yet Uncle Tree instantly subdued them. In other words, Uncle Tree’s power far surpassed his opponents’, and everything before this could be considered mere probing blows.

“Release me! Otherwise, the Ye clan won’t let you off!” shouted the Seventh and Eighth Elders.

They had realized that something was off. It was because no matter how they attacked, they were unable to damage Uncle Tree’s core. In other words, their attacks were unable to cause substantial injury to him.

After all, the Undying race was famous for their regenerative powers and endurance, so there was no way that they could beat him through attrition.

Thus, they chose to leave. But in that instant, Uncle Tree unleashed his full power after warming up his body. After all, he had been stuck in the fiend eye for too long and needed to get back into his top condition.Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

At this moment, an enormous locust tree covered the sky, its crown locking down this entire area, and its leaves blocking the sun like a giant prison. No one could escape from this place.

This was Uncle Tree’s true body, and it was countless times larger than the one that Long Chen and the other saw in the fiend eye.

Ignoring their threats, Uncle Tree simply turned to Long Chen.

“Master, what do you say?”

“Kill them,” said Long Chen indifferently without even looking at them.

“You dare-?!”

The Seventh and Eighth Elders cried out indignantly.

But no matter how they shouted, the branches piercing their bodies still lit up. It was like the branches were pumping them full of gas, and they rapidly inflated before exploding.

Just like that, the deaths of two Heaven Venerates caused heavenly runes to fill the air. Those were the core runes of Heaven Venerates, and they were slowly reabsorbed by heaven and earth. After all, the power of Heaven Venerates came from the Heavenly Daos, and so when they died, everything returned to the Heavenly Daos. What the heavens gave them was ultimately taken back.

The sight of two Heaven Venerate being slain was deeply shocking, making Guo Ran and the others feel their hearts pounding in excitement. Those were Heaven Venerates, but they had actually been slain just like that!

After that, they couldn’t help looking at the Ninth Elder. He was quivering, his swollen face filled with fear.

“Coward, scram!”

Suddenly, Guo Ran kicked the Ninth Elder. Enveloped by terror as he was, the Ninth Elder seemed to forget how to dodge and was kicked into the distance.

The reason why Guo Ran kicked the Ninth Elder was because he noticed that the latter’s pants got wet, and a strong odor was released into the air. Feeling like vomiting, Guo Ran immediately kicked him away.

A great Heaven Venerate was terrified to the point of pissing himself, leaving the Dragonblood warriors filled with scorn. He was normally so arrogant that his tail was always up, and he looked down on other people’s lives as if they were simply blades of grass. But when the tables were reversed, he became a coward. This person was very disgusting for the Dragonblood warriors. So even Heaven Venerates were only at this level.

“Please, don’t kill me! Don’t kill me! I’ll kowtow to you, as long as you don’t kill me, I’m willing to be your slave, your servant…”

To their surprise, the Ninth Elder actually kowtowed repeatedly and cried for mercy, showing no backbone at all.

Long Chen was already gripping the Minghong Saber in preparation to cut off this fellow’s head. After all, his mouth was extremely loathsome; only by killing him would it resolve the hatred in Long Chen’s heart.

However, the Ninth Elder was soaked in his own piss. If Long Chen used the Minghong Saber to kill him, it would be a blasphemy to the Minghong Saber.

Long Chen then thought to have Uncle Tree kill him, but Uncle Tree was from the Undying race, a proud race. Long Chen also felt bad about ordering him to kill this trash.

Long Chen couldn’t help looking at Guo Ran. However, this time, Guo Ran was smart. Holding a cloth, he was focused entirely on cleaning his sabers. He pretended not to notice Long Chen looking at him.

“Please, spare me! I have a family! I have…” The Ninth Elder wept until his face was covered in tears and snot as he repeatedly kowtowed.

Long Chen cursed inside. How was he so unlucky to encounter such a piece of old trash?

“Boss, let me…” A Dragonblood warrior stepped forward as he saw that no one wanted to do it. It was understandable though. How would you kill someone so pitiful? It was indeed a bit awkward.

The Ninth Elder was so hateful that they wouldn’t feel bad killing him. But it would feel a bit disgusting.

“Whatever. It’s fine.” Long Chen waved his hand. With the Dragonblood warriors’ pride, how could Long Chen make them do something that he disdained doing? Turning to the Ninth Elder, he said, “Go back and tell your Ye clan that it’s still the same thing. Don’t provoke me as my temper isn’t good. I’ve given you two chances now, but there won’t be a third. If you provoke me again, then I, Boss Long San, will properly play with you until the end.”

“We definitely wouldn’t dare to do so!” The Ninth Elder was overjoyed. Upon winning his life back, he repeatedly kowtowed with renewed vigor.

“Scram!”

The Ninth Elder kowtowed a few more times to Long Chen and then also to Yu Qingxuan, which showed that he was at least a bit smart. Finally, he realized how he had drawn calamity upon himself.

After that, the Ninth Elder rose and bowed respectfully to everyone before slowly retreating. It was unknown if it was to show his respect to everyone or because he was afraid of being attacked from the back.

When Uncle Tree retracted his true body, the Ninth Elder sighed with relief. After retreating a certain distance, he suddenly crushed a talisman and vanished.

“Boss, leaving this person will have some consequences!” said the Dragonblood warrior that had been willing to do the dirty deed.

“What consequences? With our current power, we are already able to beat him. Would we fear him in the future?” said Long Chen with a smile.

Everyone smiled at that. True, they were already capable of beating the Ninth Elder. Given his advanced age, expecting him to make any significant further advancements was simply unrealistic, especially since his Blood Qi was already showing signs of regression. On the other hand, Long Chen and the others were still in their prime, experiencing their golden cultivation period. At the very least, they knew that they wouldn’t have to worry about him alone.

“Damn, what dogshit luck,” added Guo Ran.

Hearing that, they all laughed. That really was true. If this person hadn’t pissed himself in fright today, then he would have definitely died.

“I wonder if the Ye clan will be better behaved now?” said Xia Chen.

“That is unlikely. Losing two Heaven Venerates is like a slap in their face. Although it might not reach the point of battling to the bitter end, they definitely won’t leave things be. They'll take time to investigate and assess our strength and backgrounds before making a move. So, we can relax for a bit. Speaking of which, Xia Chen, did you…?” asked Long Chen.

“Boss, don’t worry. I recorded everything with a photographic jade,” said Xia Chen.

“Good. If the immortal world’s Ye clan is the same as the mortal world’s Ye family, then we’ll directly release the recording,” said Long Chen. “Let’s go.”

Everyone once more got onto a flying boat and set off.
