Chapter 3325 Kun Wu’s Fury

Long Chen not only dared, but he also did it directly. Kun Wu had just said his vicious words when Long Chen’s saber fell. The power of this saber was one that would make gods and devils flee. Even before it fell, space was compressed to the point of solidifying.

BOOM!

The saber-image pierced through heaven and earth, shattering the ten thousand Daos, causing space to collapse. The Feather race’s experts were annihilated.

Long Chen didn’t touch a single hair on their heads. Instead, he made sure that not a single hair remained of them. As for Kun Wu, when that saber descended, he didn’t dare to receive it. He chose to avoid it.

However, even then, he was affected by the saber wind. He blocked with his own saber, only for his arm to be turned into a bloody pulp. His saber was almost knocked out of his grasp.

This world-shaking blow could not be blocked. As a result, the world lost its color; the world lost its sound. People merely saw blood mist slowly scattering through the air and Kun Wu’s arm dripping with blood.

Everyone was stunned. This attack was like the wrath of a god. In front of it, they felt incredibly miniscule. They couldn’t even muster up the will to resist.

With one attack, hundreds of thousands of Feather race experts were slain. All that remained was Kun Wu alone. How could people not be shocked?

“I don’t need to hold back at all! This feeling really is great!” Long Chen clenched his bone saber excitedly. He sensed the endless energy surging within his body. His 108,000 stars were exceptionally lively.

With the Devil Eye Water Lilies purifying the Heavenly Dao energy, the Heavenly Dao energy poured into his 108,000 stars, his 108,000 scales, and then into his six stars. Only now did Long Chen realize that this was his true power.

Previously, because he couldn’t use Heavenly Dao energy, a portion of his power was in slumber. His six stars, his Dragon Blood Battle Armor, his divine ring, and his 108,000 stars, all of them were not at full potential.

With pure Heavenly Dao energy merging with them, they were awakened. He was like the ruler of the Heavenly Daos. Even if the Heavenly Daos of the immortal world were still mostly suppressing him, it was completely different from before.

With a bone saber on his shoulder, his divine ring slowly revolving behind him, his star diagram flickering, astral flames burning all around him, he was like a battle god descended from the starry sky, an undefeatable existence whose pressure shook the nine heavens.

Seeing him like this, Bai Shishi’s heart quivered. A new light appeared within her beautiful eyes.

The current Long Chen was unrivaled. Even amongst these powerful experts, he was like a crane amongst a flock of chickens. No one could cover up his sharp light.

During normal times, Long Chen didn’t have the slightest air of an expert, nor did he seem to possess the awareness of his position as an expert. He seemed like an ordinary mischievous fellow.

However, he also had many masks. There was a humorous one, a scoundrel one, one that made people not know whether to laugh or cry, one that made people clench their teeth angrily. No one knew which side was the real him.

It was this unmatched and domineering Long Chen that made her heart shake the most. This was the cultivation world, where the strong were revered. Power was the greatest attraction. It was practically the only standard in the immortal world.

It didn’t matter if it was a man or woman, as long as they were powerful, then no matter how many other flaws they had, it wouldn’t cover up their attractiveness.

In the cultivation world, it didn’t matter if someone was good or bad. As long as they were powerful, they would have a large group of followers.

“Long Chen…!” Kun Wu clenched his teeth furiously, flames almost spurting out of his eyes.

These people’s deaths filled him with pain, causing his fury to explode. He pointed his saber at Long Chen. “Do you know that your foolishness will bring a cataclysmic disaster upon your human race? Are you declaring war on my Feather race?”

“Is the Feather race so amazing? You’re nothing more than some mixed-race descendants that have forgotten their ancestors. Despite wearing human skin, you only recognize your bird lineage. You keep bringing up the Feather race like it means no one can touch you. But wasn’t your Feather race fine with killing humans in the fight for the rainbow hydrangeas? Why didn’t you think that your actions were a declaration of war against the human race?” said Long Chen disdainfully.

“How can your human race be compared to the great Feather race?!” shouted Kun Wu.Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“You’re right, there is no comparison. That’s why I killed all of your bird people for killing a few hundred humans. What, you don’t like it? Then come and fight. Let’s see if I give a crap about you. It doesn’t matter what race you’re from. You can act arrogant whenever you want, but don’t act arrogant in front of me, because I don’t like people being more arrogant than me,” said Long Chen indifferently.

What was arrogance? This was arrogance! 

What was domineeringness? This was domineeringness!

In front of these dark lifeforms and other races, only Long Chen dared to say such a thing. These words lit a fire within countless human experts.

Throughout history, the human race was always on the weaker side. Since ancient times to the current era, the human race had grown stronger, but they still had to deal with attacks and invasions from other races. Even then, the human race was always forced to fight back.

Thus, people were starting to feel inferior to those races. But now Long Chen, a representative of the human race, was so tyrannical in front of all these experts from other races. The human race’s experts that had been forced out of the competition because of his aura also felt their resentment fade away.

Long Chen continued to absorb the rainbow hydrangeas with his divine ring. Practically, all of them fell to him. Furthermore, at this time, the rate at which they fell from the heavens clearly began to slow.

In other words, the rainbow hydrangeas were about to stop flailing. Once they stopped descending, it signified that the Heavenly Rainbow Flame would be about to come.

Long Chen had obtained so many rainbow hydrangeas, far more than anyone else. He had the highest chance of obtaining the Heavenly Rainbow Flame. From the current position, it seemed that the Heavenly Rainbow Flame choosing Long Chen was something almost set in stone.

“A group of useless trash! You all want to take advantage of others? Today, I no longer want the Heavenly Rainbow Flame. All I want is to kill Long Chen!”

Kun Wu was enraged. He saw that the others were still waiting for their opportunity. These crafty fellows were all hoping for others to put in the work while they benefited.

If they still didn’t make a move, the Heavenly Rainbow Flame would be offered to Long Chen freely. Hence, Kun Wu charged back in, his manifestation appearing behind it. A huge figure appeared within his manifestation. The next moment, an ancient desolate aura erupted, shaking the ten thousand Daos. Endless runes exploded.

“It’s the Kun!”

Startled cries rang out. That was a giant fish. Although it was just an illusion, it felt even bigger than an entire world.

The Great Kun, a species from the desolate era. It was so ancient that it was impossible to trace it back to its roots. It was said to be able to devour all lifeforms. Even dragons were food to it.

Kun Wu’s aura instantly changed. He stamped on the air, and the void collapsed. When he shot toward Long Chen, a blood-colored light appeared on his saber.
