Chapter 2906 The Barrier Forms

BOOM!

When Gu Fei’s merciless slash fell, Mu Qingyun’s sword shattered once more. And this time, Mu Qingyun was sent tumbling black.

However, she stood up again, her body covered in blood and quivering. Her fresh blood dripped onto the ground, leaving scarlet blooms.

Mu Qingyun felt like all her energy had been exhausted, but she still stood. She only had one thought: I cannot fall. Even in death, I have to remain standing.

“In the first clash, Mu Qingyun had used up all her energy, and the next two exchanges contained only her will. Now do you understand?” asked Heaven Master Yun Yang. “This formless, inexplicable power is ephemeral but also real.”

“Heaven Master, don’t just hold lessons for us. Look at her. Please go save senior apprentice-sister Qingyun. Are you really going to just watch as she’s killed? Is a genius of the God Institute going to fall just like this?” One disciple couldn’t bear it.

Heaven Master Yun Yang shook his head. “Rules are rules. They cannot be changed. As soon as Mu Qingyun admits defeat, she will be transported out. But if she refuses to speak, no one can go in to save her. It depends on herself.”

In the first two parts of the divine competition, disciples could not retreat, even in death. But in the third part, in the fighting between groups, if a disciple was afraid of death, as long as they shouted that they conceded, they would be brought out by the formation.

However, that would be giving up their qualifications to compete. Even if their group did win in the end, it would have nothing to do with the person who gave up.

Because of it, unless there was no other choice, people wouldn’t shout that they gave up. That was not just a loss but also a stain that they would never be able to wash away.

Just at this moment, Gu Fei once more attacked Mu Qingyun, who was barely able to stand. There was no longer a sword in her hand.

As Gu Fei was charging toward her, the spectating disciples were filled with fury and wished that they could charge in and chop him to pieces.

Mu Qingyun could not do anything. The only thing in her head was Long Chen’s words: Even when facing death, don’t close your eyes. Have the bravery to face it.

Seeing the sword get closer and closer to her, Mu Qingyun smelled death. She had never been so close to death in her life. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

However, the moment the sword was less than half a foot from Mu Qingyun’s neck, a broadsword blocked it.

“Gu Fei, I’ll kill you!”

It was Li Cai who had arrived. His eyes were scarlet with rage, and runes lit up all over his body. He was like a wild beast.

Having seen everything that had happened here, he rushed over with his full power and saved Mu Qingyun.

Fortunately, Li Cai’s latent talent had been awoken by Long Chen, so his sword was able to send Gu Fei flying back.

Even though Li Cai himself was knocked back as well, his hand bleeding, he didn’t care. Even as Gu Fei followed up with a piercing blow to his chest, he ignored it and hacked his sword at Gu Fei’s head.

Seeing this, Gu Fei was shocked and enraged. He naturally was unwilling to exchange his life for Li Cai’s, so he hastily switched moves.

BOOM!

The hasty adjustment caused Gu Fei to stagger back, coughing up another mouthful of blood.

Suddenly, a gust of wind blew by, and Gu Fei tumbled back, just barely avoiding Li Cai’s killing blow that left a deep line in the ground. This one blow made Gu Fei become covered in cold sweat.

Before Gu Fei could find his balance, Li Cai attacked once again. His three moves were all fluid and quick, seeking to take his opponent’s life.

“How fierce!” The disciples outside exclaimed in amazement. Each of Li Cai’s moves was a true killing blow. He was like a fierce general on the battlefield.

Gu Fei was actually sent into a fluster by Li Cai’s attacks. Countless people clapped and cheered at this turn of events, hoping for Li Cai to kill him. Even in the Immortal Institute, Gu Fei was not well-liked, almost to the same level as Chu Kuang.

Suddenly, Gu Fei let out a shout. Grabbing hold of an opportunity, he blocked Li Cai’s attack, forcing him back. After that, Gu Fei followed up with an attack to take back the flow of offense.

However, when that sword was about to reach Li Cai’s neck, Li Cai’s broadsword also pierced toward Gu Fei’s Dantian. It was extremely rapid and vicious.

Gu Fei fumed. He could clearly kill Li Cai right now, but the price for that would be having his Dantian struck by Li Cai’s attack. Although he had a protective divine ability, if he couldn’t block it, then today, he would truly be crippled.

In the end, Gu Fei cowered again and switched to blocking, and the hasty block resulted in him being pressed back. Li Cai chased after him once again, almost cutting off half of his face.

Li Cai’s fighting technique made people’s hearts pound. He was incredibly vicious, practically throwing away his own life.

“Scram!”

Just as Li Cai was forcing Gu Fei to flee wretchedly, looking as if he might take Gu Fei’s life at any moment, multiple people charged off of the altar. One of them held a bronze rod and smashed it at Li Cai.

BOOM!

Li Cai hastily blocked, only for him to sense an immense power pass through his arms. As a result, he almost lost hold of his broadsword and was forced back thirty meters before stabilizing his stance.

“You want to compete with power? You aren’t even fit to carry my shoes,” sneered the wielder of the bronze rod.

He had a large figure, being two heads taller than an ordinary person. The upper half of his clothes had exploded, revealing his copper skin that had veins wiggled beneath it like countless serpents. Moreover, his Blood Qi was like a volcano that had been accumulating for ten thousand years and was ready to burst.

“It’s Yuan Xinghui! How is he so powerful?” Luo Ning was shocked. Yuan Xinghui was ranked three on the immortal rankings. Normally, he was a complete fool and had relied entirely on Gu Fei to reach third place. Hence, Luo Ning had never cared about him.

However, today, he revealed astonishing power. It was unbelievable. He had truly hidden himself deeply.

Yuan Xinghui was about to chase after Li Cai when the altar suddenly quivered. A pillar of light then soared and enveloped the altar.

“It’s over. The barrier has been activated.”

Mu Qingyun’s heart fell to the bottom of despair. Her vision turned dark and she almost passed out.
