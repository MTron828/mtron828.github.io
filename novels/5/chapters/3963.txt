Chapter 3952 Zenith Star Covering Art

This melody directly brought the people around beyond the clouds, surpassing even the majestic and powerful tunes played by the yellow-robed woman.

At that moment, a profound realization dawned upon everyone. They finally understood that all of Long Chen's previous plays had been mere stepping stones, leading up to this very note. Everything beforehand had served as a preparation for this.

The sound of the flute surged like a tsunami that split rocks and blasted apart the clouds. Its pitch was high, but it wasn’t piercing; instead, it carried people effortlessly into the vast expanse of the cosmos. It was like their souls were brought into an endless starry sea, which allowed them to see an unprecedented space.

Furthermore, although Long Chen played the same note as the yellow-robed woman, it gave off a completely different feeling. Previously, her tune had felt like jumping off a tall tower that the zither music had constructed.

On the other hand, Long Chen’s note was like an underwater volcano erupting, unleashing a pillar of water that pierced the dome of the heavens. Its power was continuous and unstoppable.

Most importantly, Long Chen’s note was not played on his own. It was something that followed Liao Yuhuang and the others’ zither music.

Thus, when this high note reached its peak, it was like a volcano exploding. The sound seemed to linger in the air, echoing throughout the cosmos and not dissipating for a long time.

A profound silence enveloped the crowd, leaving everyone awestruck. Even the scholars who had relentlessly mocked Long Chen the whole time were now taken aback. Their disbelief was palpable, and they didn’t dare to believe their ears.

Even as amateurs, that final note shook them, piercing them deep into their souls. They would never be able to forget it in this lifetime. Even if they didn’t understand music theory, they knew that this final note was higher in realm than the yellow-robed woman’s.

As for the cultivators, they were simply stunned. Long Chen’s final note possessed a spiritual will, the desire of a transcendent figure that wished to live beyond the struggles of the mortal world, the will of a saint who bemoaned the state of humanity. It was a realm that had reached that height.

A cultivator that was immersed in endless slaughter and bloodshed would have long since lost their original character. How could they have such a pure spiritual will?

At this moment, it was so silent that even the faintest sound of a pin dropping would have reverberated. Everyone was still immersed in their shock from that final note. But after a long moment, the silence gave way to a thunderous applause that echoed throughout the surroundings.

Now, the scholars who had looked down and insulted him were too ashamed to even raise their heads. They wanted to find a hole to hide in.

Long Chen’s final high note completely eclipsed all his previous flaws. It was like the perfect final dot on a painting that perfected it, so brilliant that even all his previous flaws were nothing in comparison.

“I’ve embarrassed myself.”

Long Chen cupped his fists toward the crowd and then turned to the yellow-robed woman. “In this world, there is no natural leader. A true leader will need to form a resonance with those that they lead. Without a flourishing root system, how can the tree flourish? It was the same song, and your skill was a million times greater than mine. If you can comprehend the principles behind this, the effect will definitely be countless times better.”

“I apologize for my rudeness, and I am endlessly grateful for senior’s pointers. Please accept this kowtow.” The yellow-robed woman directly knelt in front of Long Chen, not calling him brother Long anymore. She directly called him senior, even treating him with the etiquette of a disciple greeting a master.

Seeing this, Long Chen was shocked. He hadn’t expected her to suddenly do such a thing; thus, he hastily lifted her back up. “Fairy Wan Yi is too courteous. I only know a little about musical theory. I really cannot accept such a thing.”

“Senior, are you still angry with me? If that is the case, I beg you for forgiveness.” Although Long Chen was gripping Wan Yi’s arms, not letting her kneel, she was still half-kneeling, refusing to fully rise.

Long Chen truly had been a bit angry with her, feeling like she was too petty. He had felt like he had overestimated her.

However, seeing her do such a thing, his anger was gone and he hastily said, “What are you saying? Everyone has different Daos, different opinions. Only when everyone gives their own view, clashing and corroborating with each other’s viewpoints, can there be growth. I am not so petty. Also, you can’t call me senior. If you don’t look down on me, you can just call me brother Long. We can converse as members of the same seniority.”

It was only when Wan Yi saw that Long Chen truly wasn’t angry that she finally rose. She once more thanked Long Chen, “Brother Long’s pointers have opened a path for me. I hope to hear brother Long’s pointers more often in the future!”

Long Chen bitterly smiled. “I really don’t dare. I was just viewing things from the point of a spectator. Moreover, the Music Dao is the cultivation form closest to the Heavenly Daos. There’s no way I could dare to give you pointers.”Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

“Brother Long is too humble. I was caring too much about my own performance that I neglected to cooperate with my sisters. Moreover, when you tried to correct me, I didn’t let your words of wisdom enter my head. I’m truly ashamed,” said Wan Yi. Thinking of her previous reaction, she felt like she had lost all face.

Long Chen smiled and said, “There’s no need to feel so conflicted. Just like that pale, pudgy fellow said, it was ridiculous for me to criticize such a beautiful song. In truth, music is the sound of the heart, an expression of an idea. As long as you feel like it is beautiful and are immersed in it, then that is the true Music Dao. If you only pursue technique but neglect the artistry, then you are putting the cart in front of the horse.”

That pale scholar’s expression sank when Long Chen mentioned him. He had never been so humiliated in this lifetime.

Unable to bear this anymore, he could only lower his head and examine his tea. As for the other scholars, they also didn’t dare to look at Long Chen. They wanted to leave but also felt like leaving would be telling everyone that they were afraid of Long Chen. Thus, they simply thickened their faces and sat there, not looking at Long Chen.

“I will remember brother Long’s pearls of wisdom. I will work hard to digest all the understanding that I’ve gained today,” said Wan Yi. She truly held Long Chen in great esteem now.

Long Chen was like a mirror. Today, she finally saw another side to herself clearly.

Long Chen suddenly had a thought and silently transmitted to her, “Junior sister, your cultivation technique doesn’t seem to match your character. Do you feel anything like that?”

“I cultivate the Zither Sect’s Zenith Star Covering Art…” Wan Yi was so surprised by Long Chen’s statement that she replied without thinking, but she suddenly stopped herself. This was a secret that shouldn’t be shared with outsiders.

“The Zenith Star Covering Art? Star Covering?”

Long Chen’s heart thudded. This name seemed a bit off. Was it related to the Nine Star Hegemon Body Art? Was this uncomfortable feeling because of these two cultivation techniques?

“Brother Long, where are you staying? If you don’t mind, I’d like to pay you a visit when it’s convenient.”

“I just arrived and haven’t found anywhere to stay,” answered Long Chen truthfully.

“Then why not come to our Zither Mansion? We can immerse ourselves in the Music Dao together. It just so happens that I can ask for your pointers.” Wan Yi’s eyes lit up as soon as she heard Long Chen’s reply.

Long Chen didn’t know if he should decline or accept. Luckily, there was a disturbance in the crowd that saved him from answering. At this moment, a group of martial artists wearing imperial robes walked over.

Those people startled the princes and princesses as they knew these people’s origins.

“The Emperor decrees that Long Chen is to have an audience with him!”

When this slimy voice rang out, Long Chen saw Eunuch Wei’s cold gaze.
