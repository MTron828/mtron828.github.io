Chapter 2881 Tearing Off Any Face

The Four Peak expert’s voice contained a sobbing tone, as well as terror. In front of the divine statues’ power, he couldn’t lie.

However, by telling the truth, he had announced his own execution. The High Firmament Academy might allow disciples to fight amongst each other, but it definitely did not permit experts at the level of Elders to participate, let alone actually kill disciples.

The fighting between disciples was nothing more than a battle between cattle and sheep. Although avoiding any casualties at all was impossible, the scale was limited.

However, if Elders joined in, then that would be like releasing a tiger. There would be immense casualties.

Fresh blood was always important in any place, so there had to be rules to protect those newcomers. For Elders to abuse disciples was always forbidden.

“Chu Yishan, who told you to capture Long Chen and the others? What was the order?” demanded the head judge to the other Four Peak elder.

“It… it was young master Chu Kuang who ordered me to capture the disciples and kill Long Chen in the process, saying that he resisted fiercely and resulted in an accidental death.” Chu Yishan lowered his head dispiritedly. He knew that there was no way to lie.

Long Chen didn’t react at all to this admittance of guilt. He had known his goal the instant they first clashed.

It was due to this that Long Chen had thought of a trick to destroy the transportation formation and set off the alarm. He had to blow up this matter, or he would be killed.

Mu Qingyun and the others’ expressions changed. They were all enraged. They had thought that Chu Yishan was only trying to capture them. They hadn’t expected him to be so sinister.

Mu Qingyun suddenly recalled Long Chen’s words to her about mercy. Kindness to an enemy was cruelty to her people. Just because something hadn’t happened yet didn’t mean that it wouldn’t happen. Enemies were enemies. One slip-up could cause calamity.

Chu Yishan was now confirming Long Chen’s words. Thinking of how Chu Yishan had been so brazen as to attempt to kill Long Chen at the entrance to the academy, then what would have happened if Ye Ming had encountered them in Crescent Moon Valley? She cursed herself for her naivety. People were more evil than she imagined, and she actually had time to pity others? That was truly hopeless foolishness.

Chu Yishan and Ye Ming were both ashen after testifying. The High Firmament Academy had plenty of laws and punishments, but there weren’t many crimes punishable by the death penalty.

However, being an Elder-level expert and attempting to kill the academy’s disciples for personal reasons was one of those crimes.

Although the two of them didn’t succeed, they had clearly attempted to do so. Whether or not they succeeded, they would still be punished with the death penalty, and there was no room to argue. The High Firmament Academy protected its new disciples from Elders killing them.

Hence, the head judge announced the verdict in front of everyone. He directly took out the official document, and the two magistrates had no choice but to stamp it. There was no way for them to protect the two of them now that they were caught.

These two Four Peak experts were then bound by runic chains and dragged away. However, their death penalty wouldn’t occur immediately. They were given a month of buffer time to say goodbye to their family.

Once Ye Ming and Chu Yishan were dragged away, the head judge turned to Chu Kuang. Chu Kuang instantly tensed up.

“Chu Kuang, you’re very smart to know how to take advantage of the holes in the High Firmament Academy’s rules. You prepared your retreat in advance. However, because of you, hundreds of disciples died this time, and this responsibility is also on you. You must not only pay the compensation to the families of those fallen disciples, but you must also pay the fine to the academy. Other than that, you must serve a prison sentence in the bitter cold land,” said the head judge expressionlessly.

Chu Kuang was truly very crafty. In the past, he had never left any evidence to be used against him. Even if there was, there was always someone to clean up after him.

However, this time, he had fallen into Long Chen’s hands. So many disciples had died. Hence, he not only had to pay a huge number of immortal crystals as a consequence, but there was also punishment.

Although it could be said that it was just three years, it was three years of his golden cultivation time. Even a single month was precious.

If he was imprisoned for three years, then even a genius would become a cripple. By the time he returned to the academy, wouldn’t Luo Bing, Luo Ning, or Mu Qingyun be able to crush him with a single palm?

Chu Kuang was finally afraid and looked at Chu Huairen. That was his only saving star.

Chu Huairen’s expression was gloomy. Two of the Chu family’s people had been given the penalty, so it could be considered the head judge’s attack against them. He didn’t have any mercy, nor did he give them any face.

Originally, Chu Huairen had thought to leave the head judge some face, but the head judge refused to give him any. At first, it was possible to use some tricks of the court to slightly twist things. By invoking the right laws, the two of them wouldn’t be executed. However, the head judge had taken charge and been completely direct just to put them in their place.

Chu Huairen coldly said, “Head judge, have you forgotten? When it comes to compensation, if both sides can reach a common understanding, there is no dispute. The academy has no authority to pursue blame in that case. Then, Chu Kuang’s heaviest punishment would be reduced from three years to one year. Furthermore, he is severely injured and needs to recover. He still can’t be imprisoned in his condition. As for the fine, the Chu family has many profitable businesses. There is no problem paying that fine. It can be considered subsidizing the academy. Other than that, the divine competition begins next month. According to the academy’s laws, since this competition relates to the foundation of the entire academy, even someone guilty can attend as long as they weren’t given the death penalty. If he wins the competition, there will be a year-long trial on the battlefield. If he makes outstanding merits on the battlefield, he can be exempt from punishment.”

Chu Huairen was clearly protecting Chu Kuang. If the head judge wanted to punish Chu Kuang, he would have to act within the scope of the laws. Chu Huairen was definitely more familiar with these laws compared to the new head judge, so his voice was icily arrogant.

The head judge smiled. “I’m aware of what you’re saying. But that’s a lot of hypotheticals. Don’t be too confident in things that haven’t occurred yet. Using your own words, what if Chu Kuang doesn’t obtain victory?”

“Hahaha, in this generation of disciples in the God Institute, who can match Chu Kuang? Long Chen?” Chu Huairen suddenly laughed.

Everyone looked at Long Chen. Long Chen then glanced at Chu Kuang and shook his head. “A piece of firewood really isn’t a match for me.”

“Hahaha, then just wait. I announce the trial is over!” Chu Huairen laughed and actually took the initiative over the head judge, waving his hand and leaving along with the other magistrate.

Quite an uproar arose from that response. Chu Huairen had essentially publicly announced that he was going against the head judge. That was scandalous. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

Long Chen also hadn’t expected Chu Huairen to be so arrogant, so he was a bit angry. He suddenly saw Chu Kuang looking at him disdainfully.

“What are you looking at?”

The anger in his heart erupted, and Long Chen immediately slapped him.
