Chapter 4508 Taking Turns

BOOM!

Wielding a lightning sword, Lei Linger repeatedly slashed the black ape, forcing it back.

This lightning sword was made of her essence runes. After all, the Wild Blade that she obtained back then couldn’t keep up with her strength.

Lei Linger’s power was absolutely terrifying. Even against a Saint-level devil beast, she could still put up a fight.

Unlike the encounter with the Lifehunter expert, this battle was a straightforward exchange of power. There would be no awkward situations hindering Lei Linger from unleashing her full strength against her opponent.

Hiding behind a mountain, Long Chen observed Lei Linger in combat, gauging the black ape’s strength.

“It’s clearly just a devil beast. How can it be so powerful?” muttered Long Chen.

This was Lei Linger’s seventh clash against the black ape. She and Huo Linger were taking turns against it to buy time for Long Chen to heal.

Huo Linger was slightly weaker than Lei Linger. However, the black ape seemed restrained by her flames, so she had quite the upper hand.

Lei Linger and Huo Linger would switch out after fighting it for the burn time of an incense stick. The black ape saw that Long Chen was playing tricks and tried to attack him several times, but it was always stopped by Lei Linger and Huo Linger. It was unable to harm Long Chen in the slightest.

What left the black ape most helpless was that it could only keep fighting like this. Eight hours had passed, yet its aura showed no signs of weakening. Long Chen was astonished.

This black ape was a devil beast, the lowest tier of existence in the immortal world. However, it was able to grow to such a terrifying level in this place.

Fortunately, despite being powerful, its intelligence was still very low. This was why Long Chen didn’t run but chose to fight instead.

This was a mysterious world, and no one knew just how many dangers awaited him. If he just ran around randomly, he could encounter an even stronger beast.

However, if he could kill this beast, he would be in control of its land. Then he would be temporarily safe.

At this time, Huo Linger came forward, and Lei Linger retreated. Flames soared, accompanied by sacred chants, as Huo Linger and the black ape engaged in an evenly-matched battle.

Long Chen felt relief knowing that both Lei Linger and Huo Linger possessed the strength to contend with Saints. Otherwise, it would have been dangerous for him. Against that black ape, he didn’t have the slightest confidence to win.

However, Long Chen was curious that even though the black ape was fighting Huo Linger and Lei Linger, its killing intent was firmly locked onto him. He didn’t know how it was doing that.

According to reason, no matter how powerful this devil beast was, its intelligence would still be limited. It couldn’t so accurately place a mental or spiritual lock. However, this impossibility had occurred to him.

“Is it a bloodline lock? Does it sense the dragon blood in my body?” Long Chen suddenly thought of a possibility.

After he thought of this, his heart shook. If that really was the case, it was troublesome. As the emperor of all beasts, when the dragon was strong, all beasts submitted to it, not daring to disobey.

However, when the dragon was weak, it was like a walking spirit pill—a potent medicine for increasing one’s power. That was especially true when it came to these devil beasts and demonic beasts. A single drop of true dragon essence blood could potentially induce mutation, transforming them into an unprecedented and powerful species.

In this world, numerous species owed their existence to the dragon race. However, only half of these were the outcome of mating between the dragon race and other races.

The other half were mutated species who had devoured the essence blood of the dragon race, becoming an entirely new species. For example, the Earth Dragon races. They were mostly the result of a species consuming some dragon essence blood and mutating.

If Long Chen’s assumption was correct, then the reason that the black ape had locked onto him was that it thirsted for his essence blood, wanting to devour his dragon blood and mutate.

After reaching this point in his thoughts, Long Chen was frightened. It really was fortunate that he hadn’t run around randomly after being attacked. Otherwise, he would be like a firefly in the darkness. Who knew how many terrifying devil beasts would attack him then?

Lei Linger and Huo Linger continued to fight the black ape in turns, causing a huge disturbance, but no other devil beasts appeared in the surroundings. This place had to be the ape’s territory, so other devil beasts would not approach it for nothing.

A Saint-level devil beast was an existence that had lived for countless years. Hence, the surrounding beasts were well-acquainted with their territories and wouldn't enter the domain of another Saint-level devil beast lightly.

Stepping into someone else’s territory was equivalent to a declaration of war. These devil beasts were extremely violent, and once a fight started, there was no stop until one was dead. The majority of them fought to the death rather than run.

This was why people labeled devil beasts as having low intelligence. Indeed, they were not known for their cleverness; once their minds were set, they rarely altered their course of action.

Thus, as long as Long Chen didn’t leave this black ape’s territory, he would be safe.

A full day and night passed. As Huo Linger and Lei Linger took turns fighting, the black ape’s aura finally started to drop.

Lei Linger and Huo Linger took constant breaks in the primal chaos space. Hence, even after all this time, by constantly resting, they were still in their peak condition.

However, the weakened black ape didn’t show any fear. It only grew more violent, roaring repeatedly. This was a characteristic of devil beasts. When they sensed danger, they would go berserk, and their attacks grew even more powerful.

When it sensed a danger to its life, it would overdraft all of its power in order to drag down its opponent with it.

Once the devil beast started getting violent, Long Chen finally took action. He had long since recovered to his peak condition. The minute he stepped forward, the black ape roared and charged toward him, ignoring Huo Linger and Lei Linger.

BOOM!

Long Chen unleashed a punch, and the starry sea behind him revolved. This one punch contained his full power. However, when the black ape turned his attention to him, one blow was enough to send Long Chen flying. He almost spat out blood.

This was Long Chen’s first time truly fighting against a Saint-level expert. As a result, he instantly sensed just how huge the difference between them was.

In terms of pure power, he was not a match for Huo Linger and Lei Linger. He couldn’t even withstand a single blow from the black ape.Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

The black ape roared and charged after Long Chen, but Lei Linger and Huo Linger blocked it. A net of lightning and flames twisted in front of it, but it continued to charge forward recklessly. Just as Long Chen predicted, in the black ape’s eyes, he was the only enemy.

Just then, Lei Linger and Huo Linger’s nets creaked and cracked, causing their expressions to change. The black ape’s power had grown as it entered a berserk state.

Once it went berserk, its power would erupt in a final burst. At that time, they probably wouldn’t be able to deal with it.

Long Chen flicked his finger, and a ray of golden light shot into its mouth.

When this golden light entered its mouth, its whole body shuddered. Following that, a strange mark appeared on its forehead, and Long Chen slammed on that mark with his palm.

“Submit!”
