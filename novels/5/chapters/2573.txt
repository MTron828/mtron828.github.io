Chapter 2562 The Terrifying High Priest

“Retreat!”

Long Chen let out a startled cry, bringing everyone back. At this moment, long cracks were appearing in the void, and the earth was collapsing. It was like the entire Martial Heaven Continent was shaking.

Those cracks were extremely thin but had a terrifying suction force that caused dirt and stone to fly inside and be devoured.

What was on the other side of those cracks was the chaotic flow of space. Once sucked inside, wild spatial blades would crush everything inside to dust.

Even a Heaven Merging expert would be killed if sucked inside. Hence, they definitely had to distance themselves.

“This is the power of a supreme divine item? It truly does possess the power to destroy heaven and earth,” exclaimed Gu Yang.

The divine light drowned out Daoist Heavenly Feather and the Ye family head, growing stronger and stronger. Two experts standing at the peak of the world were clashing with two divine items that stood at the peak of the world as well.

“Long Chen, face your death!”

The Zhao family head’s voice rang out. At the same time, her manifestation appeared behind her, but it was impossible to see what it was. The world suddenly turned dark, as if the sky was collapsing and pressing down on everyone.

Everyone, including Long Chen, coughed up a mouthful of blood. They were shocked to find that they couldn’t move.

“Realm suppression. That old bitch really is shameless!” cursed Gu Yang.

The Zhao family head was ignoring her status and seniority. With the suppression of her realm, they weren’t able to fight back.

With her being in control of the heavens, every Empyrean was suppressed. This was the most brutal and effective realm suppression. At this moment, the Heavenly Dao energy that originally supported them was rebelling, affecting their physical bodies and their flow of spiritual yuan.

While the others were incapacitated, a clear sound of a sword coming out of its sheath rang out. After that, a brilliant ray of Sword Qi illuminated the darkness, ignoring the old woman’s realm suppression.

The Zhao family head’s heart turned cold after she saw this. Yue Zifeng was actually able to resist her realm suppression. Hence, with a cold snort, she clawed his Sword Qi.

BANG! Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

The Sword Qi exploded, resulting in Yue Zifeng turning pale and coughing up a mouthful of blood. As he collapsed, the immense pressure loosened and Gu Yang grabbed him. After that, Meng Qi immediately pressed a hand against his forehead, sending her Spiritual Strength into him to help him heal.

Yue Zifeng’s attack had contained his will inside of it, so the destruction of his Sword Qi resulted in a fierce backlash to his soul. Because of this, Meng Qi immediately sealed Yue Zifeng’s soul, allowing him to fall unconscious and enter a self-restorative state. In the next instant, the pressure returned.

At the same time, the Zhao family head was shocked. Yue Zifeng’s Sword Qi was able to break her defensive qi and injure her. Now, there was a long cut in her arm, and blood dripped out.

“Old bitch, die!” Wilde suddenly roared and summoned his golden giant form, smashing her with his door bolt.

He was another one who wasn’t affected by her realm suppression, startling her. However, being injured by disciples in the Netherpassage realm caused her fury to soar.

A withered fist then smashed into Wilde’s door bolt. As a result, ripples exploded within the old woman’s manifestation, and the void behind her cracked.

Wilde’s giant body was forced back. After a dozen steps, with every step causing the ground beneath him to collapse, he coughed up a mouthful of blood and shrank back down.

“World Extermination Flame Lotus!”

Just as she forced Wilde back, Long Chen sent a giant flame lotus smashing toward her.

BOOM!

The flame lotus exploded on contact with her palm, startling her. She had thought that this was Long Chen’s strongest attack, but it was easily broken.

However, she then realized something was wrong. The flames from the flame lotus transformed into flame dragons that devoured her Heavenly Dao energy.

Her expression changed. Just now, she had used her full power to block, and it was at this moment that long Chen’s saber fell.

“Split the Heavens 8!”

This was Long Chen’s true attack. In front of an old demon of the Zhao family, there was no way Long Chen would have enough time to summon the nine-star World Extermination Flame Lotus.

Furthermore, Huo Linger had used up a great deal of energy fighting Ye Liangchen. Although it was possible to just barely use the nine-star World Extermination Flame Lotus, its power would be reduced from its peak. Hence, Long Chen just had Huo Linger imitate the aura of the nine-star World Extermination Flame Lotus to trick the Zhao family head.

“How crafty. But you’re too immature.” The Zhao family head sneered and unleashed a claw at Evilmoon.

Long Chen smiled disdainfully. Just as Evilmoon was about to meet her palm, Evilmoon’s two dragon marks lit up.

BOOM!

Long Chen was sent flying. But starting from the Zhao family head’s middle finger, her hand was cut in two. The cut extended all the way to her elbow.

“Courting death!” The Zhao family head roared furiously. Evilmoon had suddenly unleashed a surprising sharpness that had almost cut off her arm.

After that, her figure vanished, and she instantly caught up to Long Chen. A claw reached out for him.

A metallic screech then rang out as her claw slammed into a pill furnace. Sparks flew. The Demon Moon Furnace had appeared to take her attack.

Long Chen had originally been planning on using Evilmoon to block, but the Demon Moon Furnace had appeared of its own accord, blocking her. With her attack blocked and her head right in front of him, Long Chen instinctively swung his left hand.

Pow!

A crisp sound rang out as Long Chen slapped her ugly face. The old woman was still immersed in her shock from the Demon Moon Furnace when she was sent flying.

“Heavens!”

Countless eyes almost popped out. Long Chen was truly heaven-defying. He had slapped Ye Liangchen, Jiang Wuchen, and now even the Zhao family head. This was definitely a supreme divine ability.

These three slaps had all been clear to everyone watching. They appeared easy and natural, flowing like water. There was nothing curious about the slaps, and yet none of the three had been able to dodge.

“This slap is worthy of being engraved in history. Even if Long Chen dies here, no one in the past has surpassed this slap, and no one in the future will be able to reach that height either,” praised someone.

A shameless technique with no value like face-slapping had actually reached the heights of a divine art in Long Chen’s hands. Even a Sovereign was unable to do this.

“You son of a bitch!” The Zhao family head let out a hysterical screech. It was like the roar of a beast yet also like the cry of a fiend.

BOOM!

She formed hand seals, and a blood mark appeared on her forehead. Her hands formed a triangle pointed at Long Chen.

After that, she raised that triangle to her forehead. In that instant, Long Chen’s hair stood on end. Evilmoon shouted, “She’s exhausting her longevity and life blood essence to unleash a curse!”

Long Chen suddenly found that he had been locked onto. No matter where he fled, it would be useless. When that attack reached him, he would be cursed.

When Long Chen had been cursed by Gui Yan’s Underworld Soul Ghost Curse, he had personally experienced just how terrifying this kind of technique was. Considering how crazy the Zhao family head was acting, perhaps he would be doomed as soon as he was struck.

Just as Long Chen thought that his end was coming, a cold ray of Sword Qi slashed toward the Zhao family head.

The curse that had been about to be unleashed suddenly shattered. The Zhao family head then coughed up a mouthful of blood, her curse technique interrupted.

The Zhao family head was sent flying. At this moment, her body was covered in frost, and one of her arms was gone.

Daoist Heavenly Feather had come at this crucial time to save Long Chen. However, in exchange, a giant bell came crashing down from the sky at Long Chen.

“Be suppressed!” Ye family head took advantage of this opening to attack.

The Dragonblood Legion’s warriors were shocked and infuriated. As Empyreans, they were still affected by this realm suppression and hence unable to move. Wilde charged over, but he couldn’t reach them in time.

The sound of a bell rang out. Just as the bell was about to strike Long Chen, a small object smashed into it. The giant bell was actually sent flying by this small object.

Everyone was startled. The Ye family head’s expression changed. He harshly shouted, “Which scoundrel dares to launch sneak attacks without revealing themself?!”

Another object flew over at the Ye family head. This time, everyone saw it clearly.

“That’s…”

When they saw what it was, everyone was dumbfounded.

It was actually an exquisite jade wine cup. Could it be that what had saved Long Chen and sent the giant bell flying just now was also a wine cup?

When the Ye family head saw the wine cup, his expression changed once more. He suddenly thought of something and smashed a fist at the cup.

BOOM!

The cup exploded along with the Ye family head’s fist. Blood splattered his body.

Everyone was deathly silent. Was there such a terrifying existence on the Martial Heaven Continent other than Daoist Heavenly Feather?

“Youngsters shouldn’t be so angry and should respect their elders. If it wasn’t for some past relationship with your divine families’ Pill Doyen, you would already be dead. You aren’t qualified to speak to me. If you have questions, call out your Lord Venerate.” An old voice rang through the air.

“High Priest!”

Long Chen was startled when he recognized this voice. The High Priest was actually such a terrifying existence? Damn, why hadn’t he told him earlier?

Long Chen suddenly eyed the bell. Taking advantage of the Ye family head’s shock, he suddenly struck the bell.

“Today, I’ll smash apart your fake divine item!”
