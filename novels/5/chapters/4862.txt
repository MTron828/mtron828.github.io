Chapter 4851 Huge Joke

Countless shocked cries erupted as Long Chen’s hand ruthlessly smacked Cao Shaoqing in the face, abruptly cutting off Cao Shaoqing’s wild laughter. Spectators saw a burst of blood mist from Cao Shaoqing’s face, followed by him spinning through the air.

This scene stunned the spectators. In fact, it was so sudden that they found it difficult to accept as reality.

Long Chen had worn an expression of disbelief just moments ago, but in the blink of an eye, he launched a lightning-fast attack. His speed was so overwhelming that Cao Shaoqing couldn’t react.

None of the spectators had imagined such a strange scene to play out in this match of heavenly geniuses.

“Big Brother Mo Nian, why is Big Brother Long Chen angry?” asked Yu Tong hastily.

“The Iron Blood Gate is full of idiots. That’s not the Immemorial Blood Crocodile,” replied Mo Nian. He was also startled and didn’t quite know how to explain it.

Mo Nian looked at the gate master, Cao Guofeng, who wore an enraged expression. It was unclear whether this stemmed from witnessing the slap or from recollections of being slapped himself.

Mo Nian couldn’t help sighing. In the end, the fake couldn’t become the original. Mo Nian might have copied Long Chen’s slapping technique, but there was no way for him to learn the true essence of it. For him, executing a sudden slap at that distance would be impossible. That was the crucial difference.

Mo Nian was tempted to mock Cao Guofeng upon this realization, wanting to ask him to compare Long Chen’s slap on him with Long Chen’s slap on his son. However, just as Mo Nian was about to do so, Cao Shaoqing crawled up and charged at Long Chen furiously.

“I’ll kill you!”

“Fuck your dad’s balls!” cursed Long Chen as he unleashed a kick.

BOOM!

In front of countless shocked gazes, Cao Shaoqing was struck so hard that he smashed into the martial stage’s barrier, then crashed into the ground, flopping several times before finally coming to a halt.

When Cao Shaoqing crawled up, he suddenly spat out blood, which started to emit smoke. A ferocious devil beast aura emanated from the blood, shaking people’s souls.

“Idiot, you’ve wasted my emotions. I can’t believe I was so patient against an idiot. Does your Iron Blood Gate really think that this piece of shit is the Immemorial Blood Crocodile?!” Long Chen pointed angrily at the giant crocodile in Cao Shaoqing’s manifestation.

Cao Shaoqing appeared stunned and somewhat intimidated by Long Chen's anger. He retorted, “If this isn’t the Immemorial Blood Crocodile, then what is it? Are you blind? Can you not see the immemorial blood lines on its teeth? Can you not sense its immemorial divine might?!”

Long Chen roared, “Idiot, do you even know that the Immemorial Blood Crocodile is a descendant of a primal chaos species, the Yellow Spring Blood Crocodile?! When it’s born, it has seventy-two teeth evenly split with thirty-six on top and thirty-six on the bottom. Each of its teeth has seven blood runes. It is due to these seven blood runes that the Immemorial Blood Crocodile must undergo a nirvanic rebirth tribulation once every seventy thousand years—part of a curse that the Ghost Emperor left on the Yellow Spring Blood Crocodile.

“Although the Immemorial Blood Crocodile is a mutated variant of it, it is still affected by this curse. The Immemorial Blood Crocodile merely has a ten percent chance of passing the nirvanic rebirth tribulation. The ones failing are turned to dust, never reincarnating. As a result, most of them end up dying to the nirvanic rebirth tribulation. However, the runes on their teeth contain the secret to unraveling the power of nirvanic rebirth. It is due to this secret that the Immemorial Blood Crocodile has yet to go extinct. I waited so long for you, but you dare to show me this shit?”

Long Chen pointed at the crocodile’s head, cursing. He knew so much about it because there was a detailed record of the Immemorial Blood Crocodile in the High Firmament Academy’s tomes.

The power of nirvanic rebirth was one of the greatest and most secretive powers in the world. Even the phoenix race's version of nirvanic rebirth was considered incomplete.

Long Chen had been very curious about this power, so when he heard that Cao Shaoqing possessed the Immemorial Blood Crocodile’s essence blood, he was full of expectation. However, the higher the expectation, the greater the disappointment.

Perhaps of everyone present, only Long Chen and Mo Nian knew the secret of the Immemorial Blood Crocodile. Long Chen had read about it in the academy’s texts, while Mo Nian had some understanding of it from underground murals.

That was why both Long Chen and Mo Nian were stunned when they saw this crocodile. How was it the Immemorial Blood Crocodile?

Through Long Chen’s explanation, everyone looked more closely at Cao Shaoqing’s manifestation. They found that it had twenty-eight teeth on the top and bottom, and every tooth had only one rune in it.

“As expected of the High Firmament Academy’s youngest dean, he even knows these kinds of secrets,” praised Yu Luo. She had learned something new today.

Cao Shaoqing furiously cursed, “You’re spouting bullshit! If this isn’t the Immemorial Blood Crocodile, what is it then?!”

“It is the Immemorial Crocodile Lizard, a mixed breed between the crocodile and lizard races. Furthermore, the crocodile blood has nothing to do with the Immemorial Blood Crocodile, you idiot!” cursed Long Chen.

“You’re the idiot! You’re just jealous of me, so you’re making shit up! If I fell for it, I’d be an idiot! You can just go fuck yourself!” Cao Shaoqing suddenly shot up, and the crocodile in its manifestation opened its mouth.

A blood-colored sword shot out of the crocodile’s mouth, thrusting straight at Long Chen.

BOOM!

A giant dragon claw stretched out of Long Chen’s manifestation. With an explosive sound, the dragon claw caught that sword.

“Heavens, it’s a tongue!”

The blood-colored sword was actually a snake’s tongue. Recalling what Long Chen had just said, everyone felt that he was most likely right, as only the snake and lizard races would have a divine ability relating to the tongue.

“Explode!”

When Long Chen clenched his hand, the dragon claw exploded along with the tongue. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

“AHH!” Cao Shaoqing screamed. Crushing his manifestation's tongue was akin to crushing his own. The pain was immense.

The spectators were stunned by the turn of events. They had anticipated a spectacular battle, but what they witnessed felt anticlimactic and dull.

“Start fighting!”

“If you’re not going to fight, I want you to refund my ticket!”

“Why isn’t Cao Shaoqing fighting back?”

Loud cries of dissatisfaction rang out. After all, the spectators had spent a great deal of money to watch this battle, hoping to learn and comprehend something from it. However, they weren’t going to get anything from something like this.

“I can't be bothered to waste more time on you,” Long Chen declared coldly as he advanced toward Cao Shaoqing, his eyes filled with sinister killing intent.
