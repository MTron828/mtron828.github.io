Chapter 4491 Possessing Long Chen

BOOM!

Hurled to the ground, Long Chen felt as though every bone in his body would shatter. With a painful grunt, he gradually regained consciousness and found himself in a dark palace surrounded by nether dragon experts.

Yet, their once-majestic presence had waned. Despite boasting over a hundred Eternal experts, nearly a thousand budding Doyens, and even six awakened Doyens, their collective aura now seemed lackluster compared to when Long Chen fought Netherdragon Tianzhao.

Most importantly, most of them were injured, and quite a few of them were downcast. It was as if they had just fought an intense battle and lost.

As they stared at Long Chen, sinister killing intent blazed in their eyes.

“Hand over the Ten Thousand Dragon Nest, or I have ten thousand ways to make you live a life worse than death!” shouted an elder of the nether dragon race.

The nether dragon race was now on the verge of collapse, having lost the Ten Thousand Dragon Nest, their foundational stronghold and also most of their elites. Now, the world they resided in was thrown into chaos.

Factions that had long been suppressed under their tyrannical rule united, seizing the opportunity to declare war on the weakened nether dragon race. Exploiting their vulnerability, these factions sought to deliver a decisive blow while the nether dragon race was at its lowest.

Ever since that battle, the nether dragon race headed rapidly toward destruction. Every day, some experts would come to cause trouble for them, and they were constantly losing troops.

Although the race leader was powerful, their old enemies were also strong. Even when he still possessed the Ten Thousand Dragon Nest, he had been unable to kill them. Now, with the loss of their foundational stronghold, he couldn’t retaliate at all.𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Furthermore, every time they clashed, their enemies’ goal was simply to exhaust the nether dragon race, gradually reducing their total power.

They wanted to kill the race leader, but they were also afraid of his final death throes, afraid that he would drag them all down with him.

Reluctant to engage in direct confrontation, they slowly reduced the power of the nether dragon race by wiping out their elites, forcing them to the point of despair.

In a desperate move, the race leader snuck out in secret to shamelessly ask for aid. However, the dynamics had changed; while people were willing to assist them in their prime, obtaining help during their time of need would be much more challenging.

Had the Ten Thousand Dragon Nest still been under their control, the nether dragon race’s request for aid would have garnered more support.

However, with Netherdragon Tianzhao’s whereabouts unknown and the loss of their Ten Thousand Dragon Nest, the glory of the nether dragon race had become a distant memory. In their diminished state, no one extended a helping hand to them.

The race leader ran into a wall everywhere he went, and he was enraged. But unexpectedly, he ended up running into Long Chen on the way.

When the race leader saw Long Chen out in the open, his hope reignited. Thus, seeing that his subordinates now wanted to torture Long Chen he immediately said, “Don’t be in such a rush. Immediately send out word that Long Chen has been captured by me. I want those idiots to know.”

The race leader had faced rejection at every turn, but his luck took a heaven-defying turn when he unexpectedly encountered Long Chen. He wanted to see what those stingy people would think once they knew that he had captured Long Chen.

“Yes!”

The nether dragon race immediately disseminated this news. Once it spread, the enemy alliance of the nether dragon race would definitely be terrified and run, giving the nether dragon race some time to recuperate.

“Race leader, let’s subject this fellow to your ten great tortures, one by one. There’s no better way to quench our hatred,” declared one of them.

The nether dragon race was gravely wounded, and most of their experts had perished. All this was thanks to Long Chen. Hence, their hatred toward him could no longer be expressed with mere words.

Having truly fallen into a dragon pool, Long Chen thought about his situation rapidly. Currently, he still had a single trump card available to him, and that was the Earth Cauldron.

However, the nether dragon race leader was just too powerful. If Long Chen couldn’t kill him in one move, the race leader would just snatch the Earth Cauldron from him, and then Long Chen would truly be doomed.

After pondering for so long, he couldn’t come up with anything good. Any plan he could come up with had less than a ten percent chance of success. Furthermore, he only had one shot. Once he lost it, there would be nothing left for him. To say that he wasn’t afraid would be a lie, but he also didn’t dare to make any rash moves.

“Brat, what are you thinking? You think that you can run? I’ll break your arms and legs.”

The race leader suddenly raised his hand. As his Saint power erupted, he locked Long Chen in place and grabbed Long Chen’s arm.

BOOM!

Long Chen smashed into the wall of the palace, leaving a giant hole in it. Seeing this scene, the race leader was startled, and the rest of the experts present also gasped.

This palace was made of special materials, so even an ordinary Eternal expert would not be able to leave a mark on it.

However, Long Chen’s body was so powerful that it left a hole in it. Cracks spread through the wall, and this stunned everyone.

The race leader had used his Saint power just now, thinking to rip off Long Chen’s arm. But instead, he ended up sending Long Chen flying.

Sharp pain ran down Long Chen’s arm, but it wasn’t torn off. However, he found that his meridians cracked and were almost severed. As stars spun in Long Chen’s eyes, he almost passed out again.

“Fuck, I can’t wait any longer! I have to counterattack!”

Long Chen gritted his teeth. His Spiritual Strength started to subtly circulate as he was ready to use the Earth Cauldron. As for whether or not he could kill this terrifying fellow, Long Chen couldn’t say for sure. All he could do was gamble on this.

Long Chen had his eyes closed. His spiritual fluctuations grew weak as he pretended to pass out.

All of a sudden, the race leader’s eyes lit up, and he laughed. “I really was muddled by my anger. His physical body is even stronger than mine, and he’s younger! If I were to obtain such a body, I might be able to make another breakthrough, hahaha!”

The race leader suddenly pointed his finger at Long Chen’s head. Long Chen was about to launch his counterattack when the Earth Cauldron’s voice reverberated in his mind.

“Don’t move. Let him come in.”

Long Chen was startled. The race leader wanted to possess him, but the Earth Cauldron didn’t want him to resist. Ultimately, Long Chen chose to trust the Earth Cauldron and let the race leader press his finger on his forehead.

The next moment, sharp pain struck him, and berserk Spiritual Strength poured into his mind-sea. Black Nether Qi filled his mind-sea.

The Divine Gate inside his mind-sea quivered. Just as it was about to counterattack, the Earth Cauldron quivered, and the Divine Gate Star and Divine Gate dimmed.

“Hahaha, that mysterious cauldron is also in his mind-sea, and it still hasn’t recognized a master! The heavens are helping me! Everyone else, retreat and guard me!” The race leader laughed and gave orders.

When the only ones remaining in the palace were the two of them, the race leader directly transferred his entire soul into Long Chen’s body.
