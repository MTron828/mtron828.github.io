BOOM!

The earth quivered. The clash between Supreme Bones unleashed a ripple that instantly destroyed countless buildings in the Spirit Rune Pavilion.

Only a small portion of the buildings was able to survive the wave of destruction, and it was because countless formation runes lit up, blocking the impact partially.

As for the experts present, they weren’t so fortunate. Even as they clutched talismans in their hands and set up layers of defenses, they were still blasted apart. In front of the power unleashed by these two, those protective talismans were unable to provide the slightest protection.

Only top experts were able to block the wave of destruction. When the gusts settled, they saw Guo Ran’s arm quivering, holding Ji Wuying’s sword.

Ji Wuying’s sword was also quivering. It appeared as if he was trying to shake off Guo Ran but was unable to. At this moment, waves of killing intent came from their Supreme Bones. It was as if their two Supreme Bones were fighting instead of them.

The aura of Supreme Bones filled the air and terrified people, forcing them to be reverential. The Supreme Bones seemed to represent the world’s peak power.

At this moment, Ji Wuying suddenly raised his head and roared. His hair billowed chaotically as if he was a wild devil beast. He then pulled on his sword with all his might.

However, no matter what he did, that sword didn’t move in the slightest. It was like it had fused with Guo Ran’s hand.

Guo Ran shook his head. “You are the Bloodkill Hall’s number one expert? What a fake title. I’ll send you on your way.”

Guo Ran’s left leg shot out like lightning, attacking Ji Wuying’s abdomen. At that moment, black armor covered his leg.

Ji Wuying’s expression completely changed. He hastily let go of his sword to dodge, but he didn’t expect that even before Guo Ran’s kick landed, it would shoot a ray of divine light and strike him in his abdomen.

Seeing this scene, Long Chen shook his head. Although this surprise attack was great, as an expert of the Bloodkill Hall, no matter how trashy Ji Wuying was, there was no way he couldn’t dodge it. Other than having a Supreme Bone, this fellow was garbage in all other aspects.

Startled cries rang out from the survivors. Once Ji Wuying’s abdomen was pierced, Guo Ran pressed the attack, refusing to spare him. Divine light burst out of Guo Ran’s feet, and he shot forward, reaching Ji Wuying in an instant with a punch.

BOOM!

Ji Wuying now had a terrified expression. Panicked, he formed one-handed seals and vanished. But just as he did, Guo Ran punched the space beside him, resulting in Ji Wuying’s figure reappearing, except for the half of his body that was obliterated by Guo Ran’s punch.

His spatial energy was unable to escape the senses of Guo Ran’s Supreme Bone. Guo Ran always found him.

After being struck by Guo Ran’s punch, Ji Wuying’s remaining body began to wither. Terrifying devil qi spread throughout his body.

It had to be known that Guo Ran’s Supreme Bone had posed a great deal of trouble for Long Chen as well. Even with the primal chaos bead’s help, he had spent a great deal of effort to dispel the devil qi that had struck him.

Even Long Chen’s terrifying physical body was unable to deal with it. As for Ji Wuying, considering that he was fleeing, he didn’t have any defenses up, so this punch had taken his life.

Ji Wuying’s body slowly faded away. It was like it was being incinerated.

Ji Wuying screamed in terror, but he only had half of his body, and now it was starting to fade. He then smacked his face with his hand, trying to reject the devil qi.

As a result, just touching his face caused his head to explode. At that moment, it wasn’t just Guo Ran that was dumbfounded. Long Chen, Xia Chen, and the others were also dumbfounded.

“Guo Ran, be careful in the future. If a mosquito bites your face, don’t be so stupid as to slap it with your right hand,” warned Long Chen.

Guo Ran was shaken. Ji Wuying was so anxious that he forgot about his own Supreme Bone. In his explosive state, he ended up using his hand to strike his own face.

After all, Guo Ran still didn’t have absolute control over his Supreme Bone. If he slapped his own face, would it also cause his head to explode?

Ji Wuying had killed himself with his own hand. Even the old monsters that had lived for countless years never saw such a thing. They couldn’t even believe it. A Supreme genius ultimately died to his own hand?

People couldn’t help looking at Guo Ran, who, from the start to the end, still had one hand behind his back.

From start to finish, Guo Ran appeared to possess the calmness and grace of a powerful expert. It was as if everything was under his control, and it made him appear suave and handsome.

Guo Ran was pleased inside at having those people stare at him. He had a feeling as if he could look down on the rest of the world.

Just then, Ji Wuying’s corpse suddenly moved and everyone jumped in shock. Guo Ran’s expression also changed. He then rushed to Ji Wuying’s body, slashing his saber and cutting off his hand. That hand was his Supreme Bone.

However, what shocked Guo Ran was that the Supreme Bone’s runes rapidly dimmed. It corroded, transforming into a puddle of blood.

“Ah! My Supreme Bone! How can this be?” Guo Ran almost cried.

He had thought it through. In the future, he would have a right arm Supreme Bone and a left hand Supreme Bone. With those two, just who would he have to fear in this life?

However, just as he was enjoying everyone’s gaze on him, this Supreme Bone suddenly rotted.

“Something’s strange about Ji Wuying. But we’ll discuss it later. We have more important things to do right now.” Long Chen eyed the rotted corpse, and his gaze was surprisingly solemn. However, he had to get Guo Ran back on track. Things weren’t over yet.

Ji Wuying was dead. His death was fishy and a bit bizarre. Because of this, Gongsun Ziyi and Gongsun Xuan’s expressions weren’t very good. Long Chen saw their unease and fear.

The power that Guo Ran displayed shocked them. It went without saying that Guo Ran’s display was absolutely outstanding this time. After all, he had defeated Ji Wuying effortlessly.

In truth, it was all due to Ji Wuying being an idiot. He was practically cooperating with Guo Ran the entire time. Guo Ran didn’t specialize in long-range combat, especially not without his battle armor.

Hence, as long as Ji Wuying didn’t use his Supreme Bone and simply made Guo Ran lose track of him, then no matter how trash his assassination arts were, it would make Guo Ran uncomfortable.

However, this fellow, an assassin, actually chose to use his weakest area to fight someone’s strongest area. It could be said that Ji Wuying had used his life for Guo Ran to beautifully accomplish his act.

Even with Long Chen’s intelligence, he was unable to tell just what kind of existence Ji Wuying was. Just what was he thinking? Long Chen was still befuddled.

“Now, Gongsun Xuan, Gongsun Ziyi, it’s time to settle the enmity between us!” announced Xia Chen.

Gongsun Xuan sneered, “A traitor like you thinks that you can change the truth just because you found a few helpers? Do you think that I’m not prepared?”

Suddenly, Gongsun Xuan waved his hand, and tens of thousands of buildings within the Spirit Rune Pavilion lit up. Those buildings that weren’t destroyed were actually formation discs. They all exploded now, unleashing a wave of divine light that locked onto the three of them.
