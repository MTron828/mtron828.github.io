Chapter 2381 Put on Trial

Translator: BornToBe

Long Chen and the others had just returned to the divine families when they were gathered up.

“Follow us to the joint hearing.”

Long Chen frowned. He asked Shen Chengfeng, “They don’t want us to release information to others?”

“Shut up. Who said you could talk?” shouted one of the guards guiding the way. These guards were wearing violet robes.

Long Chen directly slapped him, cursing, “Idiot, who do you think you’re talking to?”

Without waiting for a response, Long Chen kicked him in the abdomen so hard that his head met Long Chen’s knee. He tumbled back, coughed up a mouthful of blood, and fainted.

The other guards furiously activated the chains in their hands. Those chains lit up, and barbs grew out of them like poisonous fangs.

“Just try to touch me, and you won’t see tomorrow’s sun.” Long Chen clasped his hands behind his back.

There were a total of eighteen guards who had come to lead them, and with one unconscious, there were seventeen left.

These were disciples of the torture chamber with special statuses. Most importantly, attacking one of them would double someone’s punishment.

That was why these disciples themselves weren’t particularly powerful but could basically run rampant throughout the divine families. No one wished to offend them because no one knew when they might fall into their hands. They did their best to ignore them.

However, Long Chen didn’t care about them. He didn’t mind if others were arrogant, but they just couldn’t be more arrogant than him.

Despite their fury, Long Chen’s killing intent locked them in place. Their chains didn’t move.

“First, I’m not a member of the divine families, so you’d best be more polite when talking to me. Second, none of us have committed any sins, so don’t act like executioners in front of us. Third, my mood isn’t always so good. Don’t think that having a backer is enough to be arrogant. In this world, some people don’t look at backgrounds before killing,” snorted Long Chen. These little jailors had so much arrogance that Long Chen felt like it would be wrong not to slap them.

It seemed that these disciples had never encountered a vicious character like Long Chen. They didn’t say a word. One of them carried their fainted comrade away.

The others started to lead the way again. They didn’t say anything, but Long Chen had also lost interest in talking.

The eighth legion’s warriors saw all this and felt even greater reverence for him. Who cared about these disciples of the torture chamber? This was true dominance.

Shen Chengfeng sighed inside. He knew the difference between him and Long Chen. It was that courage and confidence that led him to not fear heaven or earth.

As the commander of the eighth legion, he had never truly possessed the mannerisms of a commander. He had also not possessed the confidence and domineering nature of a commander. Just at that moment, Long Chen clapped his shoulder, as if reading his thoughts. “As a commander, don’t just look at other people’s strong points but also at yourself. Some people are born with things that can’t be imitated, so don’t force it. There’s no need to imitate others. Develop according to your own strong points. Why walk someone else’s path?”

“But I feel like compared to you and the other commanders, I… I’m just lacking,” said Shen Chengfeng.

“If you are the most lacking, why are these brothers all so loyal to you? Quite a few of them have enough talent to join a different legion but still stayed, right?” Long Chen turned behind him. “Why did you all stay?” Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“Because the commander always treats us as true brothers. He’s always the first to charge out and the last to retreat on the battlefield. He’s the only one that treats our lives as important as his own, so we’re willing to follow him to death!” shouted one of the warriors.

“That’s right. Although our commander isn’t the strongest, he treats us sincerely. He’s willing to leave his life to us. What’s that called?”

“Heroism!”

“Yes! Even if the eighth legion has to remain in last place forever, we’re willing to follow commander Shen!”

The eighth legion’s warriors began to shout loudly. It was supposed to be forbidden to be loud here, but the guards didn’t dare to say anything. They only warned them with their eyes.

Shen Chengfeng was surprised. He hadn’t thought that his position was so high in their eyes.

“Do you see? Every person has their own strong points. Don’t reject yourself, or you will be rejecting all these brothers. That would be a betrayal in and of itself. Do you know why you lack confidence?” asked Long Chen.

“Why?

“Look closely at my mouth. Follow my lips. Because you were poor, very poor.”

The eighth legion’s warriors laughed and Shen Chengfeng smiled.

Long Chen waved his hand. “This is serious. You weren’t confident because you were poor. You had too few chips, so you didn’t dare to lose any. That’s why you were so cautious. But you must realize that sometimes opportunities are fleeting. When you hesitate, that opportunity will sip away. Due to your fear of failure, you hesitate and so you fail. Seeing one opportunity after another, you’ll naturally blame yourself and lose confidence. It becomes a vicious cycle that is difficult to break. However, this isn’t necessarily a bad thing.”

Shen Chengfeng was startled. What do you mean?”

Long Chen twisted his neck and stretched. “All things are double-sided. The good things you see aren’t necessarily good, and bad things aren’t necessarily bad. You might have missed out on countless chances to get stronger, with people leaving your side because they didn’t like things. But the ones who stayed are all worthy of trust. Trust is the most valuable wealth and the greatest power. Your camaraderie has been tested through fire and blood. You were only missing one chance to soar, and now the chance has come. You have the chips you need to play as you wish. I trust that you will definitely soar overnight. I’m quite confident in my vision.”

Shen Chengfeng and the rest of the eighth legion felt their blood heating up. Long Chen was right. They had endured their bitter days to this point. The gains from the last two battles would be the foundation for their rise. Long Chen had pointed them in a direction, and the rest would be up to them.

He was truly worthy of being the creator of the Dragonblood Legion. He had managed to turn a group of weak disciples into the continent’s number one legion. Someone capable of shaking the world had to have world-shaking methods. They were convinced.

“Other than that, I should warn you that you shouldn’t just close your eyes and charge forward. See more, hear more, and think more.” This time, Long Chen sent a direct message to Shen Chengfeng.

“What are you saying?” asked Shen Chengfeng, confused.

“What am I saying? You were the one who said that we are chess pieces. I thought that you understood, but it seems that I misunderstood you. As the Long and Ye families compete, you are a chess piece of the Long family. However, all you did was develop normally without doing anything. That’s why you’ve never received any true support. When thinking about things, don’t just consider them from your own point of view. Look from the point of view of the Long family. You understand that you’re a chess piece. A chess piece that only knows how to charge forward is just a pawn. It will charge until it dies. But if you know more variations, you can become a knight. Within the rules, there is still plenty of space to play around. Do well, and the Long family will naturally give you more help. How much the Long family gives you is based on how much value you have to the Long family. Politics are always merciless. Don’t talk about emotions. Just loyalty with no power is useless, understand?”

“Understood. Many thanks for this pointer.” Shen Chengfeng suddenly had an insight. Elder Long had been constantly hinting at this kind of thing to him, but now he got it.

As they talked, they arrived at a large palace hall. The eighth legion’s warriors entered and it was so huge that they still didn’t fill it.

Suddenly, a bang rang out through the hall. An icy voice rang out.

“Brazen Long Chen, kneel!”
