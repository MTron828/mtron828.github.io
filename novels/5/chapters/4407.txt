Chapter 4396 Unable to Block a Single Blow

“Spatial energy?”

When Yu Feng attacked, people were shocked to see that he could actually control spatial energy.

A ripple materialized in front of Long Chen, and a claw extended toward his throat at an astonishing speed, nearly making contact the moment it appeared.

However, what left everyone in awe was that Long Chen completely disregarded the approaching claw. Instead, his hand swiftly reached behind him.

BOOM!

When the void exploded, the ripple in front of Long Chen vanished. Somehow, Long Chen’s hand had caught a claw from behind him.

“What?!”

Everyone was shocked. It appeared that the attack from the front was a feint, and the real lethal strike had come from behind. Yet, Long Chen had still managed to sense it.

“Come out!”

Long Chen forcibly pulled Yu Feng out of the void.

Yu Feng grunted and suddenly opened his mouth, unleashing a blood-colored blade that shot toward Long Chen’s head. This was not a divine ability, but a real blade.

Long Chen turned his head, just barely dodging this attack. This blade left a hole in the void as it sliced through.

People were shocked to see this. Yu Feng’s attacks were bizarre and unpredictable, and Long Chen's evasive maneuvers were just enough to narrowly avoid them. At such close quarters, it seemed implausible for anyone to react so swiftly—Long Chen appeared to be relying entirely on instinct.

Yu Feng’s wings folded in upon Long Chen, slamming toward his head like blades.

“It should be my turn,” snorted Long Chen. He suddenly pulled Yu Feng’s claw, slamming him toward the ground.

The lightning platform reappeared, and with an explosive sound, feathers scattered into the air. Yu Feng was forcefully driven into the ground, causing the entire city to tremble and countless buildings to develop cracks. This attack was ten times more powerful than the one Long Chen had employed against the blood-colored crocodile.

The mighty Yu Feng had all his feathers blown away, resembling a bald chicken now. Blood then spilled from his mouth.

However, he was also quite powerful. Even after receiving such a blow, he didn’t pass out. All of a sudden, he lit up and swelled in size.

“No!” The Eternal expert of the Feather race was shocked and hastily shot toward Long Chen.

Seeing him charging over, Long Chen snorted and suddenly threw Yu Feng at that Eternal expert.

BOOM!

Just as the Eternal expert was about to catch Yu Feng, the latter exploded, and his terrifying Blood Qi crushed the void.

People were dumbfounded. Yu Feng was actually so proud that he chose to self-detonate after losing to Long Chen, trying to drag Long Chen down with him.

However, he had been thinking too naively. The detonation not only inflicted no harm on Long Chen but left the Eternal expert bloody instead. Looking at the twisting space in front of him, the Eternal expert’s eyes brimmed with icy killing intent.

As his most outstanding descendant, Yu Feng had never tasted defeat and was extremely prideful. Hence, after losing to Long Chen, he actually lost his mind and tried to end things through mutual destruction.

While this Eternal expert moved as soon as he sensed this, he was unable to save Yu Feng’s life. He then quivered with rage, and a beast-like roar rang out.

“Damn humans! I will make every single one of you pay for Yu Feng’s life!”

A terrifying pressure crashed down, covering the entire city and causing everyone to quiver with fear. As they had never seen a true Eternal expert before, they were unable to resist an Eternal expert’s pressure.

“How interesting. Who do you think you are to demand other people pay with their lives? The human race has truly pampered you. You’ve become enamored with the idea that you are gods who can easily decide people’s life and death. Unfortunately, Boss Long San won’t be indulging you any longer.”

Countless people were stunned to see Long Chen start walking through the air toward that Eternal expert.

It had to be known that the entire city was covered by an Eternal’s pressure. Others were bitterly enduring, but Long Chen didn’t seem affected at all.

Seeing that Long Chen could ignore his pressure, that Eternal expert panicked and shouted angrily, “Just who are you?!”

“I can’t be bothered to waste words on a dead person. All you need to know is that you must have respect in your heart, or you won’t be far from death.” Long Chen sneered disdainfully and continued to walk toward the Eternal expert.

The closer he got, the more the Eternal expert’s heart shook. He gradually came to realize that even his soul was shaking. It felt as though the approaching figure was a harbinger of death.

“Human! Who do you think you are? Everyone, attack and tear him apart!” roared the Eternal expert.

Following his order, the tens of thousands of Feather race experts charged at Long Chen.

“How sinister. Using a group of cannon fodder to test me?” Long Chen sneered and extended a hand, summoning a snow-white lotus. It was as pure as fresh snow, and its coldness permeated the surroundings, causing the temperature of the world to plummet.

However, atop this snow lotus danced flames that warped the very fabric of the world. As people saw this lotus, their souls quivered in response.

“World Extermination Flame Lotus!”

The lotus expanded and instantly devoured all the Feather race’s experts.

Its flame incinerated an army of tens of thousands into nothingness, leaving no trace of their existence behind.

Witnessing tens of thousands of experts vanish simultaneously, everyone present felt as if they were in a dream, where nothing seemed real.

“What are you looking at? If you still don’t do anything, you won’t have a chance,” said Long Chen coldly as he walked toward that Eternal expert.

Even while unleashing the World Extermination Flame Lotus, Long Chen didn’t stop walking. He killed those experts as if he were shooing away a swarm of flies.

On the other hand, the Eternal expert felt a mix of shock and fury. He finally understood that this black-robed fellow was definitely a trap, a meticulously laid snare for their Feather race.

"I'll kill you!" the Eternal expert roared, his manifestation materializing. His Eternal power surged as he swiftly unsheathed his weapon. He then channeled his full power into it, staking everything on this single strike.

Following that, a shocking scene left the world in deathly silence—Long Chen effortlessly caught the tip of the spear, halting the full-power attack from the Eternal expert.

“You are the weakest Eternal I’ve ever seen.”Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

Long Chen shook his head and shoved the spear back.

The butt of the shaft directly pierced through the Eternal expert’s chest, showering the surroundings with his Eternal blood. Everyone around watched in stunned disbelief, their jaws dropping at the unexpected turn of events.
