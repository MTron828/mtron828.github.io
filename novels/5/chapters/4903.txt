Chapter 4892 Dragon Blood Extreme Yang Pill


“What idea?” asked Long Chen. He was definitely interested when he heard the Earth Cauldron say such a thing.

Based on his experience, if the Earth Cauldron were to say such a thing, something good was about to happen.

“Uh, are you going to tell me?” asked Long Chen after the Earth Cauldron didn’t reply.

“Don’t rush. I’m calculating the karma of this matter. I’m wondering if it will be sensed by the Heavenly Daos. After all, the amount of karma you’ve accumulated is immense. I’ll do my best to reduce it as much as I can,” responded the Earth Cauldron.

Long Chen nodded and fell silent, no longer disturbing it. Eventually, the Earth Cauldron said, “It will invoke some karma, but it won’t be a large problem. Let us refine a Dragon Blood Extreme Yang Pill.”

“What is that?” asked Long Chen. He had never heard of such a thing.

“It is a Saint pill capable of temporarily multiplying the power of your Dragon Blood Battle Armor by five times. Furthermore, the side effects are no worse than when you burn your dragon blood.”

“Five times?” Long Chen jumped in shock.

When he ignited his dragon blood to summon the Dragon Blood Battle Armor, it was around three times stronger than his usual Dragon Blood Battle Armor. However, this pill had an even stronger effect, with fewer side effects?Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Long Chen’s recovery had taken a lot of time and effort not just because the Doyen power reduced his efficiency, but also because burning his essence blood had left him in a deficient state. Replenishing it was time-consuming.

“This pill will not just increase the power of your ignited blood, but it will also reduce the damage to your body as much as possible. You’ll be able to maintain the Dragon Blood Battle Armor for longer,” remarked the Earth Cauldron.

“Then what are we waiting for? Let’s refine it right now!” How could Long Chen possibly resist the allure of such a divine pill?

The Earth Cauldron replied, “Refining it will take some time, and you won’t have as much time to search for treasures. You should also understand that even a short moment can affect the results of your treasure hunting. Furthermore, I’m not able to help you with such a thing. You should make this decision yourself. I’m just offering the possibility.” 

With a smile, Long Chen said, “With my luck, finding any treasures is quite hard, so I’d prefer to increase my power. When the time comes, if I find someone I don’t like, I’ll have higher odds of taking their treasures then.”

The Earth Cauldron smiled at Long Chen’s answer. Long Chen knew himself well. The Earth Cauldron understood that one reason his luck was so bad was due to the numerous things he possessed that drew the envy of the heavens. As one of the ten great primal chaos divine items, the Earth Cauldron was a major contributor to that.

Mo Nian had also said that Long Chen had no hope of finding anything; it was more efficient to kill his enemies and take their treasures. Mo Nian truly knew Long Chen.

The Earth Cauldron then told Long Chen to make a choice, which would reduce the karma. Moreover, if he ended up missing out on a treasure because of this, he couldn’t blame it. Although Long Chen wasn’t such a petty person, for the meticulous Earth Cauldron, it was better to explain the pros and cons first.

“If that’s your decision, let’s find a place to refine it. Put a marker here so that we can directly do a spatial transportation afterward,” said the Earth Cauldron.

Following the Earth Cauldron’s instructions, Long Chen set up a transportation marker and hid it so that other experts wouldn’t find it. This way, he could save a great deal of time when he came back.

After everything was arranged, the Earth Cauldron pointed Long Chen in a direction, and he directly activated a supreme transportation formation. He didn’t even know how far he had gone. When he arrived in a barren land, he hastily checked his formation disc and found that his marker was still within its range. After that, he relaxed.

If he went so far that the marker vanished, it meant that he had gone way too far and wouldn’t be able to use a transportation formation to get back.

“Come. First, we’ll refine the Ghost Nether Rat King’s essence blood into Heavenly Yin Water,” said the Earth Cauldron as it appeared before Long Chen.

“We’re going to start off with it?” Long Chen was surprised.

“Some things should be used when you get them. There’s no need to be too stingy,” replied the Earth Cauldron. It knew that Long Chen liked to save the best things for last, but that wasn’t always a good habit.

At this moment, a flame ignited within the Earth Cauldron, and Long Chen could see the Ghost Nether Rat King’s essence blood flowing within it. He could vaguely hear its piercing cry as well. Although it was dead, its will had yet to disperse.

Without the Earth Cauldron’s reminder, Long Chen placed a hand on it, and his Spiritual Strength gushed out. His Yuan Spirit dove into the Earth Cauldron.

The interior of the Earth Cauldron was a world of flames. When Long Chen entered it, the Ghost Nether Rat King’s essence blood instantly took form and pounced on him.

The Ghost Nether Rat King let out a strange cry. Even in his Yuan Spirit form, it could stun Long Chen for a bit, but that feeling passed in an instant. His soul wasn’t stripped off of his body this time.

Even so, this feat still startled Long Chen. The Ghost Nether Rat King was already dead, and all that remained of it was its discarnate will. However, it was still able to unleash a divine ability with this level of power.

Even without those sacrifices boosting the power of its attack, it could still stun Long Chen. Long Chen was amazed by how strong this Ghost Nether Rat King was.

“An ancient species really cannot be underestimated. However, this place is my territory. You are in no place to struggle!”

Long Chen then pressed a hand on the Ghost Nether Rat King’s head. Countless runes lit up within this world of flames, and the Ghost Nether Rat King exploded.

BOOM!

Its discarnate will vanished, leaving behind only the essence blood. The Earth Cauldron could effortlessly kill it, but it hadn’t done so. Thus, Long Chen did it himself.

After its discarnate will was gone, the essence blood stopped fighting. The flames swept over them, eliminating the impurities within, causing them to clear up.

As more time passed, ten thousand drops of water appeared, each incomparably pure and clean. Without personally witnessing it, Long Chen wouldn’t have believed that the ferocious Ghost Nether Rat King had something so pure in its body.

Every single drop contained a supreme Yin energy. As the Earth Cauldron continued to refine them, these drops ultimately merged into a large sphere.

At this moment, the Earth Cauldron called out Huo Linger and used the strongest flame to refine them. After multiple hours, the giant sphere gradually shrank until it was just the size of a thumb. Ten thousand supreme Yin runes flowed within it, and its energy scared even Long Chen.

The Earth Cauldron declared, “The refinement is complete. Now, it’s time to refine the Dragon Blood Extreme Yang Pill!”
