Chapter 4235: Terrifying Trap

 

Due to cursing angrily, Mo Nian’s spiritual fluctuations spiked, revealing his position not only to Long Chen but also to Yan Wuji.

Yan Wuji instantly vanished, reappearing in a certain location and smashing his fist at the void.

This time, his attack was not for nothing. As the void shattered, everyone could see a coffin appeared behind it

It was a crystalline coffin covered in ancient runes, but it didn’t give off the slightest aura.

Mo Nian was sitting on top of the crystal coffin. Seeing Yan Wuji attacking, he summoned a shovel in his hand.

The shovel looked drab and unremarkable with dirt still stuck to it. It was as if Mo Nian had just come back from a day of farming.

When Mo Nian was exposed by Yan Wuji’s punch, many experts clenched their teeth furiously at the sight of him. It seemed that Mo Nian had plundered these very experts’ ancestral tombs as well, which caused them to put up warrants for his capture everywhere. Their collective rage was palpable, and they looked as if they wanted to tear him apart.0 Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

“Now let’s see where you will run!” Yan Wuji was surprised to find Mo Nian and immediately attacked him.

“Tch, in a one-against-one, do you think that I’m afraid of you?” Mo Nian sneered and stood atop his crystal coffin. He then smashed his shovel at the charging Yan Wuji.

BOOM!

Yan Wuji’s fist struck the shovel, and the impact shook the entire martial stage, causing terrifying qi waves that blasted apart countless dark creatures.

After a single exchange, both of them fell back at the same time. Yan Wuji then stamped down on the void and shot back like an arrow flying from the bowstring, giving Mo Nian no time to breathe.

However, just as he pounced at Mo Nian, Mo Nian suddenly opened the crystal coffin.Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

“What?!”

The moment the crystal coffin opened, he had a bad feeling. But just as he was about to retreat, it seemed that Mo Nian had expected him to run, so he shoved the crystal cauldron toward Yan Wuji. As Yan Wuji had no time to stop his momentum, he was instantly sucked inside the crystal coffin.

BOOM!

The crystal coffin slammed shut without the slightest crack, catching Yan Wuji firmly within.

“Little lamb, in a one-against-one, I can play you to death. Other than eating my shit, what other ability do you have?” Mo Nian proudly chortled after trapping Yan Wuji in his crystal coffin.

Seeing this scene, everyone inside and outside the martial stage was dumbfounded. Just as they thought that there would be an immense battle between Mo Nian and Yan Wuji, it ended in the blink of an eye.

At this very moment, rumbling sounds rang out from the coffin, indicating that Yan Wuji was trying to escape. A multitude of runes then lit up on the coffin, sending waves rippling outward. However, despite his best efforts, the coffin remained shut.

“How can this be?”

The other experts of the Grand Yan imperial line were dumbfounded. How was it over before it even began? They were caught too off-guard by this to even react.0

“Save His Majesty!”

Suddenly, one of them shouted, and only then did the others snap out of it. In an instant, hundreds of thousands of experts charged at Mo Nian.

“Just like I thought, you refuse to fight one against one. If you want him so badly, I’ll give him to you.” Mo Nian sneered and suddenly kicked the crystal coffin over.

The crystal coffin shot at those experts like a shooting star, which surprised those experts as they didn’t expect Mo Nian to just give it to them. Startled and uncertain of Mo Nian’s intentions, they caught the coffin and began to study it to see if they could open it.

Mo Nian simply ignored them and went to Long Chen. He chortled, “Brother, I heard that you haven’t been doing too well lately.”

“As if you’re doing better than me. Within the human race’s territory, your picture is everywhere. A lot of people want you dead,” retorted Long Chen. But to think of it, he really hadn’t been doing too well lately. Even so, Mo Nian definitely didn’t have the right to laugh at him for that.

“Hehe, well, I’m definitely doing a bit better than you. My enemies are only from the human race. As for you, haha, have you heard a certain saying that’s been going around?” asked Mo Nian.

“Which saying?”

“Long Chen, hated by eighty-five percent of the nine heavens’ experts. Hehe, I didn’t believe it at first, but now I fully believe it, hahaha!” Mo Nian eyed the countless races on the martial stage and laughed.

Hearing Mo Nian’s words, Bai Shishi’s mother couldn’t help chuckling as well. The rest of the High Firmament Academy’s experts looked at him oddly.

 

They had never heard of such a saying. However, given the current martial stage’s situation, it seemed that eighty-five percent might not even be enough to include everyone who was looking at Long Chen with hostility.

The devil race, the Blood race, the demon race, the beast race, the Shadow race, the Netherworld race, and countless other races were glaring at Long Chen without concealing their killing intent in the slightest.

Even amongst the human race, a large portion of them were hostile toward Long Chen. One reason was because Long Chen stood out so much that it made people jealous, while the other reason was because he had swindled many of them at the auction for the Heaven Earth Cauldron. Even the people who hadn’t taken losses from that auction still hated Long Chen since he had toyed with them like that.

Furthermore, there were also peak powers like the Violet Blood race’s Xu family, the Eternal Long family, and the Human Emperor’s line, all of whom counted as Long Chen’s mortal enemies. Maybe being hated by eighty-five percent of the experts here was no exaggeration.

“This Mo Nian is also infamous. Added together, it’s probably way more than eighty-five percent.” Bai Xiaole’s mother couldn’t help but bitterly smile.

Although they were mentally prepared and knew that Long Chen would have a thorny path in the Sage King Convention, they hadn’t expected this many enemies to appear.

“Alright, let’s not talk about such meaningless things. Just what is going on with the martial stage? Why weren’t you with us at the start?” asked Long Chen.

Since Yan Wuji was trapped in the crystal coffin, no one else was bothering them. Hence, Long Chen wanted to figure this out first.

“I don’t know either. We also rushed over to the Sage King Prefecture when we heard about it, so we’re just as baffled as you,” said Mo Nian.

According to him, they had also come from the various lands of the nine heavens. Just like Long Chen and the others, they then found each other in the Sage King Prefecture. 

“I don’t know why it is split into two worlds, but I am sure of one thing,” said Mo Nian seriously.

“What is it?” asked Long Chen hastily.

“This is a trap,” said Mo Nian.

“What the fuck? It’s not like I’m blind.” Long Chen rolled his eyes. He had long since noticed this, but that wasn’t the important point.

“The main thing is that this trap might be opening an even larger trap. Perhaps it will shatter the current state of the entire world,” said Mo Nian gravely.

“What?!” 

This time, Long Chen jumped in shock. If that really was the case, then this trap really was terrifying.
