Chapter 327 Courting Death

Translator: BornToBe

“Stop crapping all over the place. This isn’t the latrine. Let your grandpa Guo show you what a heaven-startling method is.” Guo Ran’s arrogant words immediately drew everyone’s attention.

Guo Ran and Long Chen both went to the passageway. The Righteous and Corrupt disciples all took a step back.

In the Righteous disciples’ eyes, Long Chen was a true Corrupt disciple. In the Corrupt disciples’ eyes, Long Chen was fiendish enough to make even them feel terror.

As for Guo Ran, when he saw that he was able to make all of them retreat with just his voice, he couldn’t help being delighted.

Although he was borrowing Long Chen’s fame to intimidate them, that didn’t make him feel the slightest bit unnatural. His boss’s glory was his glory.

Everyone was glaring at them. When Guo Ran saw that even the Favored and powerful Chosen were being forced back by him, Guo Ran’s heart practically bloomed flowers.

Although both parties were irritated with Guo Ran’s display, seeing that he wanted to try it out, they naturally wouldn’t stop him from sending himself to his death.

Many of them had already tried countless methods, but none of them had managed to enter. None of them believed an ordinary core disciple like Guo Ran could enter.

However, they did think it was possible for Long Chen to have thought of some trick. They just waited to see what Long Chen would do.

“Boss, I’ve already bragged loudly. Are you sure you can send me through? Don’t mess up, as that’d really be embarrassing,” Guo Ran whispered to Long Chen.

“Don’t worry. There definitely won’t be any problems. Once I send you in, stay and wait for me,” Long Chen whispered back.

Long Chen’s voice had his Spiritual Strength entwined in it. Others were only able to see Long Chen’s lips moving, but they were unable to clearly hear what he was saying.

“Okay. What should I do boss?” Guo Ran immediately became confident and began to act arrogantly again.

“Bend your knees slightly and clasp your hands over your chest. Lean forward slightly.”

Guo Ran listened obediently, and quickly entered an extremely eye-catching posture. His butt was sticking out highly, and it was pointed at the Righteous and Corrupt disciples. He even wiggled it ‘seductively’ a couple times.

Whether it was the Righteous or Corrupt disciples, they were all clenching their teeth painfully, thinking that the two of them were intentionally humiliating them.

“Get going.”

Just as Guo Ran was feeling incredibly refreshed by how those people were turning purple from rage, Long Chen kicked him right in the butt.

“Ah, what the fuck!”

Guo Ran was kicked flying towards the passageway by Long Chen. He turned green from fear.

But then Guo Ran quickly realized that Long Chen’s kick had been controlled perfectly, and the path he was flying was the exact center of the passageway. He wouldn’t touch any of the steps or walls.

He shot down extremely fast, reaching the end of the passageway in just an instant. He landed on the bottom extremely easily.

When everyone had seen Long Chen kick Guo Ran into the passage, they had thought Long Chen was trying to kill Guo Ran.

But then when they saw Guo Ran’s flight path, their eyes all lit up. This was also a method?

The reason none of them had thought of this was because they didn’t have Long Chen’s powerful Spiritual Strength. None of them had any idea about how deep this passageway was. But since they didn’t hear any scream from Guo Ran, it seemed he had managed to pass safely.

Suddenly, a figure stamped on the ground and shot forward, also rushing down the passageway. This figure was moving even faster than Guo Ran had.

“It’s Long Chen!”

“Haha, you want to pass? Die!”

Suddenly, the two Righteous Chosen attacked at the same time, shooting out over ten throwing knives at Long Chen.

Long Chen was infuriated. These despicable bastards really wanted him to kill them. Seeing those throwing knives coming at him, he raised his arms.

His hands were like lightning, and he surprisingly managed to catch every single one of those knives. At the same time, he borrowed their power to shoot down faster.

“Everyone attack!” Those two Chosen hadn’t expected Long Chen to have such precise control.

As long as one of their knives had managed to touch the walls, that would have activated the mechanisms, and Long Chen would have definitely died.

In truth, before the two of them had even said anything, people had already taken action to throw down knives, daggers, pellets, and other weapons at Long Chen.

Some of the Righteous disciples who had been hesitating now also went to attack as well. Even the Corrupt experts were attacking. Everyone was shooting down a rain of weapons.

Long Chen was startled, furious, and worried. There was no way he could dodge this many attacks, let alone catch them all.

And most importantly, the majority of them weren’t aimed at him this time, but for the walls beside him. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

In the face of this many attacks, even Long Chen’s expression changed. He wasn’t afraid of these attacks, but the result of them.

However, Long Chen didn’t just watch as those attacks fell. His aura completely exploded, and he slashed out his saber.

A terrifying wave of qi sent those weapons flying. Those were all ‘concealed weapons’ used for surprise attacks. They were mostly only seen in the secular world, as cultivators rarely used them.

Cultivators cared more about strength. They looked down on concealed weapons. So the power of these concealed weapons wasn’t very high.

However, they hadn’t had any extravagant hopes of these weapons killing Long Chen, or even injuring him. The result they wanted had already happened.

As expected, the wave of qi and broken weapons shook the passageway. Long Chen was already more than halfway down at this point, when suddenly countless stone holes opened on the wall, releasing steel arms.

Those arms all held a hammer that was the size of a small desk. They crazily smashed down repeatedly, releasing ear-piercing explosions.

“Haha, Long Chen, this time you were surprisingly good!” Quite a few Righteous disciples laughed heartily when they saw those mechanisms activate. Those hammers possessed the power to pound a person to mincemeat.

As for Guo Ran, he was filled with fury and hatred when he saw Long Chen being harmed by so many people.

“Hysterical Autumn Wind Dance.”

A golden saber appeared in Long Chen’s hand, and Saber Qi appeared everywhere, surging out of the passageway.

The ear-piercing explosions from the hammers caused the entire tomb to shake. Occasionally rubble from the ceiling would collapse down, causing everyone to scatter. They worried the entire tomb would come crashing down.

At this time, not only were they shocked at how terrifying the ancient tomb’s mechanisms were, they were also shocked by Long Chen’s combat ability.

The explosive sound coming from the passageway meant Long Chen had yet to die at this time and was still struggling.

Suddenly, the passageway returned to calm. Only then did everyone come back to see that all the steel arms had returned within the walls.

“Did he die?”

“There’s no corpse. Was he torn to pieces?”

“There’s bloodstains on the walls. He should be dead, right?” They all saw the blood on the walls. That should be Long Chen’s.

But there wasn’t much blood on the walls. If Long Chen really had been smashed to pieces, there should have been much more.

They couldn’t see the bottom of the passageway, so they had no idea whether his corpse was lying there or not.

At this time, someone threw down a lightstone. It was a special ore that could emit a bright light for a short period once activated. But after it used up all its energy, it couldn’t be used again, so it would be turned to garbage. In the outside world, it had quite a high price.

When people had entered the lounge, there had been three people who had used that ore to light up the entire lounge.

At this time, in order to confirm Long Chen’s death, they had no choice but to endure the pain and throw another one down. That immediately lit up the entire passageway.

“Oh? So this passageway is only a thousand meters deep.” Previously, they had all thought it was extremely deep, as they hadn’t been able to see the bottom.

“I don’t see Long Chen’s corpse.” Other than the bloodstains, there was no sign of Long Chen’s passing.

They could see the floor at the bottom, but due to how narrow the passageway was, they couldn’t see it very clearly.

“Boss, how could you die here?! Those damnable sons of b*tches, they should all be struck by heavenly lightning right now. They should all die…!”

Guo Ran’s sobbing rang out from within the passageway, delighting all of them. Long Chen’s death caused them all to sigh a breath of relief.

“For an amazing hero like boss to die here so tragically, how am I supposed to keep on living…” Guo Ran’s voice was extremely mournful, and just listening to it could fill a person with grief.

“Hey, that’s good enough. Why are you crying like that? Even I’m starting to think I’m dead,” whispered Long Chen.

Long Chen’s right shoulder had been gravely injured, with even his bone sticking out. That was an injury caused by one of the hammers.

Just thinking of those huge hammers gave Long Chen some fear. If such a hammer had landed on his head, would he even have a life left?

When he had passed through the huge hammers, he had also used them to send himself straight through the last layers of mechanisms to reach the bottom.

If he were to have activated the final mechanisms, Long Chen estimated that he would definitely have died. When he had charged through those huge hammers, Devil Decapitator hadn’t been able to bear it, and several large nicks had been smashed into it, causing Long Chen endless pain. Those hammers had been too terrifying.

At the same time, he felt incredible hate for those people outside. Compared to the Corrupt disciples, Long Chen hated the Righteous disciples far more.

He hadn’t expected that it would be his fellow Righteous disciples who would instigate this attack on him. Furthermore, every one of them had helped. That caused Long Chen’s killing intent to boil.

“Boss, only by crying like this can I make it seem like you’re really dead. How else are we going to trick them to enter?” Guo Ran smiled sinisterly.

Just as he said that, another figure jumped in using the same method as Long Chen.
