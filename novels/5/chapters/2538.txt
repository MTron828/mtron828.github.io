Chapter 2527 Six Star Battle Armor

Under Ye Ming’s orders, the entire Black Armor Corps was charging toward Long Chen. The divine generals had also managed to throw off the blockade of the elders of the Luo Spirit race.

Zhao Ritian, Dongfang Yuyang, and the Six Horn Sea Serpent were now slaughtering the Righteous path’s disciples. If the four divine generals arrived, things would be even more troublesome.

“Long Chen, you coward! You’re just going to hide in your turtle shell as all these innocent people die because of you?” provoked Dongfang Yuyang as he attacked.

Despite the slaughter, the Martial Heaven Alliance’s disciples did not retreat. They didn’t even try to get closer to Long Chen. They used their own lives to win him some time.

“All disciples of the Luo Spirit race, protect the prophesied son! Protect our benefactor!” The voice of the Luo Spirit race’s prophet resounded throughout the battlefield.

“Yes!”

The Luo Spirit race’s disciples charged at Zhao Ritian and the others. They then self-detonated, using the powerful explosive energy to force their enemies back.ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

Using their lives and numbers, they reduced the casualties of the Martial Heaven Alliance.

Meanwhile, the sixth star within Long Chen’s divine ring was still flickering. His aura was growing stronger and stronger, like a volcano about to erupt.

Long Chen had entered a critical state. Hence, Ye Ming was panicking, as he had also entered a crucial juncture and couldn’t be disturbed.

He directly gave the order for the four divine generals to do anything they could to interrupt Long Chen. One of them had even sacrificed an arm to escape the elders of the Luo Spirit race.

Their arrival instantly added immense pressure to the Dragonblood Legion. Their defensive formation was torn open.

The worst thing was that this opening was taken advantage of by Zhao Ritian, the Six Horn Sea Serpent, and Dongfang Yuyang.

Cloud transformed into a giant Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow and blocked the Six Horn Sea Serpent. Her wings then slashed down, unleashing a wave of golden light.

“Scram!” The Six Horn Sea Serpent swung his Sea God Trident. As a result, a wave appeared in the sky and sent Cloud tumbling back. A mass of rainbow feathers fell.

“I have the power of the sea god supporting me. Who can block me?” the Six Horn Sea Serpent roared.

Wilde charged at Zhao Ritian once more, but he was forced back miserably. His face was pale, and he could no longer maintain his giant form. Even the golden spots on his skin had dimmed.

Wilde furiously ate a few more mouthfuls of food and attacked again, but he was still sent flying. He was almost exhausted. The rate at which he ate could not keep up with the energy he was burning. In his hungry state, his combat power plummeted.

Liu Ruyan and Chu Yao summoned endless wooden staves and willow branches to block Zhao Ritian, but they were unable to stop him.

A ray of Sword Qi slashed toward Dongfang Yuyang. Looking at the attack coming, Dongfang Yuyang snorted and his body became illusory. Yue Zifeng’s sword passed right through him.

This was the same move that Di Feng had learned previously. Now, it had been mastered by Dongfang Yuyang. After that, Dongfang Yuyang’s manifestation appeared behind him, and three Emperors unleashed their divine pressure upon the world.

“Peng Emperor Cloud Splitting Clash!”

Dongfang Yuyang slashed his sword along with a giant wing, which was like a sharp saber. It felt as if people’s souls were being sliced apart before it even reached them.

“Block it!” shouted Gu Yang. He, Yue Zifeng, Li Qi, Song Mingyuan, Tang Wan-er, Ye Zhiqiu, and the others all attacked to block it.

BOOM!

The giant wing exploded after being struck by all their attacks. However, Gu Yang and the others hacked up blood.

Dongfang Yuyang’s attack was too powerful. Although it was the divine art of the Peng Emperor, it was supported by the power of the other two Emperors. Hence, the power of this attack was even capable of threatening experts above Netherpassage.

They were all shocked by how powerful Dongfang Yuyang was. His power had far surpassed their expectations. He had truly hidden himself deeply.

As Gu Yang and the others were knocked back, Tang Wan-er was particularly pale, looking like she was about to faint. A sinister smile suddenly appeared on Dongfang Yuyang’s face. He then pounced toward her, reaching for her throat.

“Wan-er!” Meng Qi and the others cried out. Dongfang Yuyang was truly sinister. If Tang Wan-er fell into his hands, he would definitely use her to blackmail Long Chen again. But even as they rushed toward her, they knew that they wouldn’t get there as quickly as Dongfang Yuyang.

Just as Dongfang Yuyang was about to reach Tang Wan-er, his vision changed. He saw a pair of icy eyes.

“Long Chen!”

Dongfang Yuyang was badly shocked. Long Chen had clearly been in the distance, so how had he come over here?

Long Chen grabbed Dongfang Yuyang’s extended hand, and Dongfang Yuyang instantly felt a sharp pain as if his wrist was going to be broken.

Dongfang Yuyang quickly sent his other hand snaking toward Long Chen’s eyes. A normal person would retreat to avoid having their eyes plucked out. At this distance, both of them were too close for Long Chen to try to kick him. Retreating was his only option.

However, Long Chen didn’t bat an eye. His other hand was shockingly accurate as it grabbed the attacking hand just before Dongfang Yuyang reached his eyes.

Just at this moment, the sixth star in Long Chen’s divine ring began to flicker far more intensely. His aura also grew unstable.

“He’s going to explode!” Dongfang Yuyang grew afraid. He suddenly noticed that Long Chen’s veins were throbbing. Faint cracks covered his skin, and blood slowly oozed out.

Dongfang Yuyang struggled, sending a knee into Long Chen’s abdomen, but Long Chen didn’t even react.

Endless energy was raging throughout his body as the Nethergate Star had finally finished the nine star transformations. The FengFu, Alioth, Life Fate, Enlightenment Palace, Divine Gate, and Nethergate Stars had all formed a channel.

The instant that channel appeared, Long Chen’s meridians felt like they were being stabbed. His physical body began to swell as they could not contain this power.

Right now, Long Chen was just one step from summoning the Six Star Battle Armor. However, once he did, he didn’t know if he could survive the impact.

“Long Chen, you’re going to die!” howled Evilmoon.

Long Chen’s current state could barely handle the nine star transformations. If he tried to bring out the Six Star Battle Armor, he might die instantly.

Evilmoon had tried to study the Nine Star Hegemon Body Art, but it was far too domineering. The requirements were too high. It wasn’t something a human could cultivate, and not even the dragon race’s bodies could endure it. Perhaps only the true dragon race might have someone capable of cultivating it.

When Long Chen had reached the third star transformation, he had been forced to slow down because his body had shown signs of collapsing. However, after undergoing the transformation of the dragon king’s essence blood, he was able to break his limits and was forced to take this risk.

Seeing the Luo Spirit race’s warriors voluntarily detonating themselves to buy him time, Long Chen clenched his teeth. “If I die, I die. My life was saved by the Luo Spirit race. I’ll just have to pay them back with my life if I have no other choice.”

“Six Star Battle Armor!”

Long Chen let out a roar that was like a devil god’s roar. It shook the nine heavens. Following it, the world turned dark, and a ferocious power unfurled around Long Chen. The sixth star in Long Chen’s divine ring blazed with light and connected with the other five stars, creating a six-point star diagram.

The instant the six-point star diagram appeared, the entire Star Field Divine World shuddered. The land split apart and the stars in the sky shook. Even the laws of the world crumbled. As a result, it was possible to see countless vertical lines trembling in the void.

“Even the heavenly fate lines of the world have been exposed. This is truly a power that can overturn a world… Yes, he is definitely the prophesied son.” The prophet of the Luo Spirit race stared at those lines in shock.

The battle paused and everyone started in horror. It felt as if the world was about to collapse.

Gravity no longer existed. Countless boulders began to float into the sky like stars.

When they looked at Long Chen, they felt as if he had opened the gate to a different world. Berserk energy was rushing through him and into this world.

Long Chen still had hold of Dongfang Yuyang’s wrists. Dongfang Yuyang screamed. The qi waves were like wind blades cutting through his body. He crazily fought to escape, but he was unable to. His body was quickly turned into a lacerated mess of flesh and blood.

Suddenly, blood splashed as Dongfang Yuyang’s arms left his shoulders. He flew back.

Everyone was startled by this. Just what method had Long Chen used to make Dongfang Yuyang unable to escape? Even then, why hadn’t he just cut his wrists off to flee? Why cut his arms off from the shoulders?

Dongfang Yuyang immediately tried to heal with Heavenly Dao energy. However, he then let out a startled cry. “What?!”

Dongfang Yuyang realized that he was unable to heal his arms with Heavenly Dao energy.

BOOM!

The world suddenly returned to calm. The boulders hanging in the sky fell to the ground once more. Everyone looked at Long Chen.
