Chapter 3587

When that drop of dragon blood was forced out from Long Chen’s body, his face instantly paled a great deal.

“Boss, you…!”

Guo Ran stared in shock at Long Chen.

“I’m going to switch out your blood. This golden dragon essence blood has been absorbed by me, causing it to lose most of its divine nature. But it still possesses immense power. It should be just right for you. You can endure it,” said Long Chen.

“Boss, I…” Guo Ran choked back a sob.

“Can you please show a bit of growth? You won’t die. You’ll just suffer some pain,” said Long Chen angrily.

“No, it’s just that boss, you treat me so well. I… I don’t know how to repay you,” said Guo Ran, tears streaming down his face.

“This move is useless against me. I won’t be soft on you. Also, in order to increase the effectiveness of the merger, it must be done in the place that hurts the most. You must endure. Protect your mind and don’t let your will slacken. If it fails and I have to once more extract my essence blood, I also won’t have much true dragon essence blood left,” said Long Chen.

Although this dragon blood already contained Long Chen’s will, Guo Ran’s will was far too lacking. It might be worse than an ordinary person’s.

If during the merger, Guo Ran’s will crumbled, then Long Chen would have to immediately give up. Otherwise, Guo Ran’s soul would be severely damaged. Even his life might be in danger.

But once he gave up, the dragon blood’s vitality would vanish, and it would be a true waste. At this time, Guo Ran’s veins were bulging on his forehead. He was in so much pain that he almost reached his limit.

Long Chen then split this drop of essence blood into three portions. First was the biggest portion, then a smaller portion, and then the smallest portion. That smallest portion fell onto Guo Ran’s forehead.

Buzz.

Golden marks instantly covered Guo ran’s entire body. His entire body quivered, and his eyes rolled up.

“Wake up!”

Long Chen shouted, dragging back Guo Ran’s consciousness just as he was fainting.

Long Chen had the urge to slap him. His willpower was far too weak. Long Chen almost had no confidence in this now. How had the Dragonblood Legion produced such a marvel?

“You must endure! Otherwise, my blood will have been spilled for nothing!” scolded Long Chen.

Guo Ran couldn’t even reply. He could barely nod as he strived to maintain consciousness.

When the first portion of golden blood merged into Guo Ran’s body, his slumbering Blood Qi finally awoke. They merged. After all, Guo Ran was also a Dragonblood warrior, and he had cultivated the Dragon Blood Body Tempering Art. Hence, there was not much rejection with this dragon blood. After some pain, he grew accustomed to it.

Marks appeared on Guo Ran’s body. They were like scales and were his dragon battle armor.

Once those marks appeared, Long Chen sent the second portion of blood into his body. This portion clearly didn’t make Guo Ran suffer as much as the first one. He only clenched his teeth and endured.

With this second portion, actual scales appeared on Guo Ran’s body, but those scales were still tender. As time passed, they continuously grew stronger.

After two hours, Long Chen sent the third portion into Guo Ran’s body. Guo Ran finally couldn’t endure anymore and fainted.

However, this time, Long Chen didn’t wake him up. The crucial part had passed. As the channels had been dug, now the water was flowing freely. Even though Guo Ran was unconscious, the third portion still automatically entered his dragon scales.

This dragon blood automatically changed Guo Ran’s physical body. It was the opposite of when Long Chen managed to merge with it. Long Chen had changed from the inside to the outside. But that was something that Guo Ran was unable to endure.

Thus, Long Chen had thought of a method. As long as he endured the impact of the first and second portions of dragon blood, it would count as a success.

Guo Ran was covered in dragon scales. As his dragon blood was coursing within him, his body was constantly twitching. But he himself didn’t feel anything.

After accomplishing this, Long Chen sighed with relief. Guo Ran was the one Long Chen worried about the most within the Dragonblood Legion. With this kind of foundation, he wasn’t fit to be a warrior.

Sometimes, Long Chen even admired himself. How did he manage to turn this marvel into an expert? Even he found it to be inconceivable.

Guo Ran slept for two full days. During this time, Xie Qianqian, Tu Hu, and the others finished digesting the Heavenly Dao Fruits that Long Chen had given them.

After awakening, sensing how their bodies seemed completely transformed, they were incredibly refreshed. Their blood and qi were flowing smoother than ever, and they were filled with energy, energy that seemed several times stronger than before.

“Long Chen, what did you feed us? How can our power suddenly grow by several times? We’re so much stronger than anyone in the same realm. I can’t believe it!” Xie Qianqian was incredibly excited, to the point that her words were rather incoherent.

The others were just as excited. With their new power, they could add many new runes to their battle armors, increasing their overall power.

“You’re not much stronger than ordinary experts. It’s just that you’ve finally reached the level of ordinary experts. Your previous selves were far too weak.” Long Chen shook his head.

To tell the truth, giving them so many Heavenly Dao Fruits was truly a waste of natural treasures. Those Heavenly Dao Fruits could allow them to rise all the way to peak Immortal Kings without worrying about their realms growing unstable. It would make up for their rush in climbing realms.

“That doesn’t matter. My power is so much stronger now, and I can upgrade my battle armor! I can add more runes!” Xie Qianqian didn’t mind Long Chen’s evaluation. She was still as excited as ever.

With every bit of increase in actual power, their battle armor multiplied it. It was due to this that the Alldevil Star-Field’s experts pursued cultivation speed over anything else. Increasing their realm was the fastest path to increase their power. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

In any case, they were existences that relied on their battle armors to survive. Thus, even if their realms were unstable, they didn’t really care. This now made up for that fatal weakness, which was that even ten of them in the same realm couldn’t beat a single person from the outside world.

If they were attacked before summoning their battle armor, they could easily be wiped out. Thus, as long as they weren’t in safe places, they would always be wearing their armor.

“Senior apprentice-brother Guo Ran…!”

Tu Hu and the others suddenly let out a startled cry. They saw Guo Ran in the distance. He was already standing, but his body was covered in blood. There was black sticky liquid on the ground around him.

When he stood up, Xie Qianqian hastily turned away. That was because the current Guo Ran was not wearing anything.

Guo Ran woke up at this time and hastily took out new clothes. However, he had just taken them out and they were already ripped into shreds in his hands.

“Heavens…!”

Guo Ran’s jaw dropped in astonishment. Those clothes were very sturdy, but they were torn apart like paper in his hands. Only then did he realize that his power had instantly exploded to an unimaginable level.

Guo Ran carefully put on new clothes. Sensing the huge changes in his body, as well as the dragon blood swimming powerfully within him, he had the urge to cry. It was like he had returned to the Dragonblood Legion and was once more that dragon-blooded tiger.

“Now, are you confident?” Long Chen smiled.

“Haha, boss, don’t worry! This time, I will definitely reclaim my lost dignity!” Guo Ran laughed high-spiritedly.

The next day was the day of their match. Now, Guo Ran and the others were in peak condition. They walked toward the martial stage with soaring killing intent.
