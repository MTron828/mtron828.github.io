Chapter 4727 Nine Revolution Heavenly Doyen Pill

Long Chen might not have cried out, but he was also baffled, wondering about the meaning of this action. However, he quickly realized something.

Even without an arm, the hall master’s expression was still calm. He then shouted at the crowd, “Everyone, sit! As the hall master, I was useless, so I must be punished. Hopefully, the rest of you will learn from this.”

Hearing this bullshit, Long Chen rolled his eyes. What was the point of chopping off an arm? If he really wanted to be punished, he should let his head be chopped instead.

After all, a severed arm was nothing to a Sage King, just a lost face.

The divine emissary also hadn’t used any law power, so with just a thought, the hall master could instantly regrow his arm. However, he left the wound to keep up the show.

The divine emissary’s gaze slowly swept over the crowd. “The Soul Assassination Hall’s disciple, Xu Qingyao, ignored our code and assaulted the High Firmament Academy on his own, only to meet his end there. Not only did his futile endeavor result in numerous casualties among our ranks, but it also brought shame upon the Lifehunter race. Long Chen even spared some of those disciples to transmit his words, but those fools were all executed on the spot as a warning to others.”

Long Chen’s expression darkened with surprise and disbelief. “How ruthless. Instead of meeting their end by my hand, they met it at the hands of their own kin.”

The divine emissary continued, “Our Lifehunter race has endured the humiliation for many years, all to wipe it away in one blow. Our ancestors could endure for so many years, but as for you? After obtaining the Nine Revolution Heavenly Doyen Pill, do you think that you’re unrivaled? Huh?”

So Long Chen’s guess was correct. These people really did have a way to make nine star Heavenly Doyens. Although Long Chen had guessed that to be the case, hearing it firsthand still shocked him.

“I don’t mind telling you that while the medicinal pill is capable of turning you into quasi nine star Heavenly Doyens, there is still a huge gap between you and true nine star Heavenly Doyens. All of you, carve my words into your brain, unless you ignite your nether soul, you will never be qualified to challenge true nine star Doyens. Our Lifehunter race’s Heavenly Province has a total of three palaces and twelve halls. Even if we don’t include the unrivaled heavenly geniuses inside of the Sovereign Emperor Heaven, the junior generation numbers in the trillions. Do you think the Heavenly Province distributed these incomparably precious Nine Revolution Heavenly Doyen Pills just to inflate your egos?” shouted the divine emissary.

All the disciples sat there silently as the divine emissary shouted at them. They didn’t even dare to look back at him.

“There should have been more of you here, but the ones with better aptitude have been sent to a secret place to undergo special training. You were left here because your talent is lacking. But despite that, we will not abandon you. Do you know why the Heavenly Province gave the Nine Revolution Heavenly Doyen Pills to people like you?”

All these experts couldn’t say shit. Although many of them knew the answer, they were afraid of saying something wrong and being used as a lesson. Everyone could tell that the divine emissary was nursing a stomach of anger.

“You, the one with your legs up! You answer me!” shouted the divine emissary furiously.

“Tch, what cowards. None of you even dare to answer his question? As the strongest assassins of the world, why are you all so scared? When did the Lifehunter race care more about survival than actually accomplishing anything?” Long Chen immediately responded, turning Qian Feng green with every word that came out of his mouth. Qian Feng was sure that the divine emissary’s palm would fall and kill both at any moment.

However, curiously, the divine emissary wasn’t angered by his response, even looking a bit pleased.

Long Chen indifferently said, “Good steel is used on the edge of the blade. We are all secret weapons of the Lifehunter race, and as such, we can’t expose ourselves before we deal a devastating blow. When we do finally attack, it will be a thunderous assault to the death.”

“Good!”

The divine emissary clapped for Long Chen and took over. “That is entirely correct. That’s the reason the Heavenly Province raised you. Xu Qingyao wouldn’t have taken such rash action if he understood this. He was incurably foolish. Fortunately, he died to Long Chen’s hands. Otherwise, I would have made him regret being born into this world. Within the High Firmament Academy are two disciples of the violet blood race, and they are our targets. We absolutely must capture them alive. We were in the midst of planning how to capture them when Xu Qingyao decided to be an irredeemable fool. Now, he has raised their alarm and ruined our plans. He really deserved a thousand deaths!”

Toward the end, the divine emissary was roaring with fury, as if he wished he could tear Xu Qingyao to pieces. “I came all the way from the Sovereign Emperor Heaven, crossing the treacherous sea of broken stars just to carry out this mission. But when I arrived, the situation was already completely ruined by him. Tell me, how am I supposed to go back and explain this to the higher-ups?”

Hearing that, Long Chen finally understood. It seemed that the Heavenly Province had used those precious Nine Revolution Heavenly Doyen Pills to create a batch of nine star Doyens just to attack the High Firmament Academy and capture Luo Bing and Luo Ning.

Unfortunately for them, Xu Qingyao’s confidence inflated after becoming a nine star Heavenly Doyen, and he directly gathered a group of his subordinates to attack the academy himself. As a result, his group was almost wiped out.

At that moment, the divine emissary was still in the midst of crossing the sea of broken stars. He had risked his life crossing it, but upon arrival, he was greeted with news of the dire situation, which undoubtedly fueled his anger.

Based on Long Chen’s estimations, perhaps this divine emissary had made a detailed plan or even issued a military order prior to his arrival; otherwise, he wouldn’t be so incensed by the turn of events.

“Divine emissary, please quell your anger. It is better to fix things later rather than never. Why don’t you tell us what we are to do now?” said the hall master.

In reality, the hall master had been unaware of the attack until it was too late to intervene. Nonetheless, as Xu Qingyao belonged to his direct bloodline, he had to bear some responsibility. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

Losing an arm was a minor matter if it meant that he could redeem himself. His main concern lay in whether this punishment was enough to absolve him of his failure.

After a moment to collect himself, the divine emissary took a deep breath, visibly exerting effort to calm his emotions.

“Today, I gathered all of you to announce an important matter. We are going to attack the High Firmament Academy. It is going to be a large-scale sneak attack, and our goal is to capture those two girls of the violet blood race alive and cut off Long Chen’s head.

Long Chen: “...”
