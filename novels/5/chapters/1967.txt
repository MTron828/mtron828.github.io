Chapter 1957: 1957

Xie Luo didn’t hesitate or use any probing blows . He immediately unleashed his strongest attack, wanting to defeat Long Chen in one move to wipe away his previous disgrace .

This was no longer his first fight against Long Chen, so they were both familiar with each other’s techniques . Long Chen’s fighting style was very simple . It was to win with power .

“Split the Heavens 7!”

Long Chen also didn’t hold back . He directly used the seventh form of Split the Heavens .

The two of them unleashed their strongest attacks right off the bat . Xie Luo’s goal was obvious . While Long Chen was still at the peak of Soul Transformation, Xie Luo wanted to crush him with absolute power to show off his own power .

If he could only win after fighting a protracted battle, that would make him a laughingstock . After all, he was already at the third Heavenstage of Life Star .

BOOM!

Evilmoon unleashed an explosion of divine light . It was like a volcano had erupted in the air, and a ripple spread through it .

Wherever the ripple passed, the void exploded . The immense power caused even the Netherpassage experts’ expressions to change . They raised defenses, blocking the shockwaves . Otherwise, if this power was left to run rampant, not many people below the Netherpassage realm would be able to survive .

Although Life Star experts were not that rare in this world, these Life Star experts were the Elders and masters of the various sects . If they died, it would throw the Heavenly Evil Region into chaos .

“Split the Heavens 7!”

Before the shockwaves were even past, a furious roar rang out . Another giant saber-image tore through the sky .

“You want to fight like this? Then let’s see just who is afraid of who! Heavenly Devouring Evil Spear!” Xie Luo also unleashed the same technique .

He was surprised that he hadn’t defeated Long Chen in one move . Just where did Long Chen get the power to resist the merged might of his evil spirit body and world energy?

However, he wasn’t too worried . Just now, Long Chen had become covered in blood as his physical body was unable to endure his own immense power . Continuing like this would only be more disadvantageous to Xie Luo .

BOOM!

Yet again, a powerful collision caused shockwaves to spread, this time with even greater momentum than last time . The Netherpassage experts were forced to strengthen their barriers .

“Split the Heavens 7!”

Long Chen once more raised Evilmoon, and a saber-image slashed down at Xie Luo .

“Hmph, after this move is over, you’ll be a cripple . ” Xie Luo had some blood leaking out of the corner of his mouth . He had suffered a light injury just now, but he didn’t mind . Unleashing this attack again meant that Long Chen would be fully out of energy . He might not even have the energy to stand .

He was still at the Soul Transformation realm, while Xie Luo was at the Life Star realm and controlled his evil spirit energy and world energy . There was a clear difference between them .

Xie Luo’s evil aura soared as he once more clashed directly with Long Chen’s saber-image .

Bang!

However, this time, Long Chen’s saber-image instantly crumbled . It actually didn’t have the slightest energy within it . Xie Luo’s snake-head spear sent Evilmoon tumbling through the air, while Long Chen had vanished .

“Watch out!”

Shouts rang out . Long Chen had appeared behind Xie Luo at some time, a lightning spear in his hand .

“What?!” Xie Luo was startled . Long Chen’s third attack was actually a fake, and Evilmoon was the bait . “Heavenly Evil Shield!”

The figure within Xie Luo’s manifestation suddenly reached out a hand . That hand held a shield that blocked Long Chen’s spear .

The lightning spear pierced into the shield, causing black runes to fly . But it was unable to pierce through it completely . Xie Luo used that chance to attack with his spear .

Having his attack blocked, Long Chen didn’t pause . He formed hand seals, and runes lit up on his arms .

“Double Dragon Destruction!”

Two roars rang out as Lei Long and Huo Long came flying out . Flames overflowed from the sky, and lightning raged .

BOOM!

Xie Luo’s expression completely changed . This time, Lei Long and Huo Long were unleashing all their power . Their destructive power actually made him lose connection to the Heavenly Daos .

Lei Long and Huo Long hadn’t gone all-out in a long time . Huo Long was even igniting all of its energy to destroy the influence of the Heavenly Daos within this region .

“Break!” Xie Luo roared . With his Heavenly Dao energy stripped away, he focused on his world energy . Divine light condensed on his spear .

BOOM!

Lightning and flames devoured the world, making Xie Luo cough up a mouthful of blood . Huo Long had actually detonated at that critical time, unleashing all of its power . As a result, even Xie Luo’s internal organs were damaged by it .

“Split the Heavens 7!”

Just at this moment, a black saber-image slashed toward Xie Luo while he was heavily injured .

“Crap!” Xie Luo’s expression changed . The flame dragon’s detonation had unleashed black flames that overwhelmed the energy of the Heavenly Daos . He couldn’t heal . In this state, he could only resist with his world energy .

BOOM!

After a miserable clash, Xie Luo’s body was covered in blood . He had almost died .

At this time, the Corrupt path’s people’s expressions changed . Long Chen was only at the peak of Soul Transformation . How could he be so terrifying?

They had thought that Xie Luo would have an easy victory, but Long Chen was actually able to force Xie Luo to the point that they were both covered in blood . Right now, Long Chen’s body was covered in cracks, and his bones were visible from many spots . His injuries were even worse than Xie Luo’s .

However, just as they thought that the two of them had both run out of energy, the white scales on Long Chen’s body vanished . Following that, his injuries instantly healed .

“What?!” Everyone was shocked . Just how was it possible to heal such terrifying injuries so quickly?

Having dissipated the Azure Dragon Battle Armor, he was able to use the primal chaos space’s life energy to heal . But now, Long Chen wouldn’t be able to use the Azure Dragon Battle Armor again for a while, as he also wasn’t capable of keeping it up any longer . His body had already reached its limit .

Long Chen no longer had the Azure Dragon Battle Armor, but he had the Five Star Battle Armor . He shot after Xie Luo, unleashing a tempest of attacks with Evilmoon .

The world was covered in black flames because Huo Long had sacrificed all the energy it could expend without dying . Within these black flames, Xie Luo was like a drowning man . No matter how good a swimmer was, they always needed a chance to breathe .

After blocking Long Chen’s nineteenth slash, Xie Luo couldn’t endure any longer . One of his arms exploded, and his spear fell away .

As for Long Chen, he didn’t pause . He continued to press forward .

Xie Luo was stripped of his Heavenly Dao energy now . Unfortunately, the Black Illusion Dragon Flame wouldn’t be able to last for long . It was already starting to dissipate, and once the Heavenly Dao energy returned, Xie Luo would be able to heal and instantly crush Long Chen . Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Long Chen was panting, and his aura was slightly turbulent as he had already reached his limit . With both sides at critical moments, it was Xie Luo who was terrified . Looking at Long Chen’s bloodthirsty eyes, he was finally afraid .

BOOM!

With only one arm, Xie Luo caught the snake-head spear and blocked Long Chen’s next attack . Using a special technique, he managed to force aside some of Long Chen’s power, but he was still sent tumbling back .

Seeing this, Xie Wentian sighed . Xie Luo had been defeated . He had been defeated because he wasn’t ruthless enough, and no longer had the courage to continue using head-on clashes against Long Chen .

He understood his son very well . As long as Xie Luo had continued fighting head-on, Long Chen would have definitely been killed . He could see just how much energy the two of them had left .

Long Chen was running on empty, while Xie Luo still had quite a bit of energy . However, Xie Luo was running, which signified defeat . He had not just lost now, but he would also lose in the future forever .

Experts needed absolute confidence . If a person doubted their own power, they would never be able to be a true expert .

“Die!” Long Chen roared, his voice causing chills .

“Save me!”

Xie Wentian shook his head . He was very disappointed in this successor of his . However, he couldn’t allow Long Chen to kill his son .

Looking at the sky, he saw that the Black Illusion Dragon Flame would only last for two more breaths’ time before dissipating . Then Xie Luo would be able to absorb Heavenly Dao energy, and Long Chen would become a lamb for the slaughter .

However, two breaths’ time was as long as two hours to the current Xie Luo . He couldn’t hold on .

Xie Wentian reached out to break the black flames, but just at that moment, a giant claw slammed toward him .

“What?” Xie Wentian was startled . A rune lit up on his hand, and a giant palm-image smashed toward the claw .

BOOM!

The giant claw exploded, unleashing a wave of lightning that forced back Xie Wentian .

“Hmph, you’re nothing more than a pet for the human race . ” Xie Wentian sneered . He was about to attack when Xie Luo let out a miserable cry .
