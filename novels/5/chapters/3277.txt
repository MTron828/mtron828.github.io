Chapter 3266 Bone Saber’s Divine Radiance Starts to Show

As Jiang Baihe’s Blood Qi was fully unleashed, his divine might raged and the roar of a fierce tiger could be heard from his manifestation. His Blood Qi covered the very heavens. Even from a great distance, people could feel his terrifying bloodline pressure.

Whistling winds unfurled, slicing through the air like blades. The ground beneath his feet began to disintegrate, and countless boulders were sent rolling.

Even those familiar with Jiang Baihe were stunned by this scene. They hadn’t expected that Jiang Baihe had been holding back his true power. It was only revealed now.

Just this bloodline pressure was enough to crush Divine Lords. His bloodline power was so strong that it had formed a kind of domain.

“So powerful! This bloodline pressure is irresistible!” exclaimed one of the late stage Divine Lord Elders of the Yuhua Palace.

Even as a late stage Divine Lord, he felt suppressed by this bloodline pressure. Under this pressure, it was very difficult for him to unleash his true power. If he was fighting Jiang Baihe, he would have to flee.

Seeing that a late stage Divine Lord would give such an assessment of Jiang Baihe, the disciples all stared at him with both fear and admiration.

“Patriarch, do you see? Baihe’s bloodline is so pure that even late stage Primal Divine Lords will be suppressed. Under this pressure, he can kill them easily. Even I would need to unleash my full power just to guarantee my victory. Would such a genius fear Long Chen?” said Jiang Weizhong confidently as he watched Jiang Baihe arrogantly unleashing his bloodline power.

Jiang Weizhong sneered disdainfully. That wasn’t just a sneer toward Long Chen but also the patriarch. Jiang Weizhong thought that the patriarch had grown old and his vision was clouded.

However, he was surprised when the patriarch shook his head. “Do you know why I was disturbed out of seclusion?”DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

Jiang Weizhong didn’t know how to reply, as he didn’t know the answer. He thought that the patriarch was secretly keeping track of what was happening in the Yuhua Palace. He didn’t know that the patriarch was actually deep in seclusion.

“Just as you were about to attack Long Chen, the Yuhua Palace’s karmic luck divine pillar started changing color. It was on the verge of cracking…” said the patriarch.

“How… how can that be?!” Jiang Weizhong and all the other elders of the Yuhua Palace were shocked.

The karmic luck divine pillar was the foundation on which the Yuhua Palace was built. It was a priceless spiritual treasure, one that possessed the miraculous ability to anticipate the future of the sect’s karmic luck.

When it gave off a warning, it meant that something that could threaten the Yuhua Palace was approaching. For it to change color meant that the Yuhua Palace was in danger of being destroyed.

Historically, whenever the Yuhua Palace was on the verge of a tribulation, the karmic luck divine pillar would accurately predict it, allowing them to safely pass through.

However, for it to not have just changed color but also been about to crack, the patriarch jumped in horror and immediately rushed out. That was what resulted in everything afterward.

“I don’t believe that Long Chen has that ability. There’s definitely a problem with the karmic luck divine pillar!” Jiang Weizhong clenched his teeth. He refused to believe that Long Chen was that powerful.

The patriarch indifferently said, “You don’t believe it, and I don’t believe it either. But I believe that there is no problem with the karmic luck divine pillar. I cannot see through Long Chen’s power, but I can tell you that the High Firmament Academy is the oldest academy within the nine heavens and ten lands. It has been slumbering for countless years and already declined, and yet it still dares to resist Lord Brahma. For a simple disciple, they had a falling out with Enpuda. Furthermore, their branch sects were destroyed countless years ago, and yet Long Chen has brought over the seal of the seventh branch academy. He is the dean of the seventh branch academy. That means that the High Firmament Academy is starting to revive their branch academies, and that they are launching a counterattack against Lord Brahma. Long Chen is their tool for doing so. Without the High Firmament Academy backing him up, what can a small Four Peak disciple like him do? There is no need to question just how important Long Chen is to the High Firmament Academy. If you kill him, do you think that the Yuhua Palace can endure the wrath of the High Firmament Academy? Furthermore, Long Chen also has a pair of siblings beside him. They are the grandson and granddaughter of the current dean. Their Bai family has been through seven generations, with every generation only resulting in a single powerful man. For a divine weapon, you actually wanted to kill them. Do you know how foolish you are? If you killed them, this world would no longer have a Yuhua Palace.”

The patriarch’s words were flat, but they were like thunder in their ears. They had not been thinking this far, nor did they know that the High Firmament Academy had such a terrifying foundation.

Their impression of the High Firmament Academy was a giant tree that had dried up. No matter how big it was, it was powerless to return to the springtime of its youth. All that awaited it was death.

Jiang Weizhong’s expression was extremely ugly. He knew more about the High Firmament Academy than the rest of these elders. But he had only been thinking about the sword and hadn’t paid any attention to Bai Shishi and Bai Xiaole’s identities.

Now that the patriarch had revealed all this, he was embarrassed. After all, he was the current palace master. For the patriarch to call him a fool made him lose all face.

“At the time, I only wanted to scare them a bit! How could I, the palace master, really bother killing some juniors?!” raged Jiang Weizhong.

“After acting wrongly, you don’t dare to admit it. You even come up with excuses to cover it up. That only shows that other than being foolish, you are also a hypocrite with an inferiority complex. Other than everything else you did, the most foolish thing was personally causing your great-grandson, a genius that only appeared once in thousands of years of your Jiang family, to die,” said the patriarch coldly.

“Bullshit! Jiang Baihe definitely can kill that brat! You’ve grown muddled with age, and your mind has decayed! You are no longer suited to take charge of the Yuhua Palace!” roared Jiang Weizhong.

This roar caused everyone to jump, and all their expressions grew ugly. Jiang Weizhong actually dared to curse the patriarch. That was on the same line as killing a master or destroying a sect. It was a grave taboo of the immortal world.

“Palace master, you’ve gone too far. The patriarch’s analysis is correct. For you to curse him for the truth, are you not afraid of being laughed at by others?” demanded Yu Xuan angrily.

Jiang Weizhong didn’t have any filter over his mouth. For him to have said such disgraceful words, even he was regretful. But having said it, he couldn’t take it back.

Jiang Weizhong thickened his face and said, “Disciple was wrong to say that. I’ve offended the patriarch, so I apologize to you in front of everyone. When we’re done here, I will kowtow to you in apology. However, I firmly disagree with your viewpoint. If Baihe loses, I will abdicate the position of palace master. However, if Baihe wins, it means that I was right. If so, I hope that you don’t interfere in my decisions in the future.”

The patriarch looked at Jiang Weizhong, not at all angry. Instead, he simply sighed. “Let us let the facts speak then!”

Everyone turned back to the battlefield. Jiang Baihe’s bloodline pressure was still rising, and yet Long Chen did not react. He just calmly watched him.

“Have you seen the difference and are despairing?” asked Jiang Baihe with a disdainful smile. 

“Are you done? In order to let you die fully convinced of your defeat, I’ve been waiting a long time,” said Long Chen indifferently. A bone saber then appeared in his hand.

After that, Long Chen swung his saber. A perfect arc appeared in the air before the saber rested on his shoulder. That arc was a crack in the void, and it didn’t heal for a long time. When they saw that, everyone’s expression changed.
