Chapter 2697 Fighting All Five Sovereigns

Mo Nian stunned everyone with this action. He was actually already capable of unleashing the power of the Central Plains Cauldron.

The Central Plains Cauldron revolved above his head, while he held the Heaven Seizing Sun Hunting Bow in his hand. Basking in countless gazes of shock and worship, he felt like he had reached the pinnacle of his life.

BANG!

“Aiya!”

Mo Nian suddenly let out a painful cry. The Central Plains Cauldron had suddenly descended and smacked him in the head, leaving a large bump.

“Bastard, who told you to use my power? I’m still not recovered. Using my power will increase the time required to recover, understand? If you mess around again, I’ll turn you into a cripple and find someone else,” cursed the Central Plains Cauldron.

“Ah… I thought that you were asleep for so long that people had started to forget your mighty name. Hence, I wanted to give them a show of your power to announce your return and showcase the might of the Martial Heaven Continent,” said Mo Nian fawningly as he painfully rubbed the bump on his head.

“Stop talking nonsense. You like showing off, so do it yourself. Don’t mess around with my power. Otherwise, don’t blame me for becoming hostile. Ending up with such a master really is my bad luck.” The Central Plains Cauldron didn’t fall for Mo Nian’s fawning. It was still angry that he had used it without asking first.

Suddenly, startled cries rang out. After that, the sky turned dark, and a sharp whistling sound pierced their ears. A giant object descended from the sky.

“Is that a star?!”

Shocked cries rang out. A giant sphere was falling with a long tail trailing it, and bright sparks flew out of it. This attack came just as Long Chen exchanged blows with Sovereign Yun Shang.

Just as they both retreated from this exchange, Long Chen was struck by the star as if he had voluntarily flown into it. Everything had been calculated perfectly.

BOOM!

Saber-light flashed, and that giant star was split in two. It then fell into the Martial Heaven Sea-Ring. However, it was like red-hot steel had been tossed into ice water. The water immediately began boiling and sizzling.

One slash sliced apart a star, causing everyone to stare in shock at Long Chen. He was already charging back at Sovereign Yun Shang.

“Be careful. We’re also going to attack.”

Sovereign Qing Xu’s voice rang out and he unleashed a palm. In that instant, his figure vanished.

Long Chen had just exchanged blows with Yun Shang, and now his fist blocked Qing Xu’s palm. As a result, the scales covering his fist shattered and blood splashed out. As for Qing Xu, his palm was destroyed.

“Little brother, these are the laws of the Heavenly Daos. Don’t blame us for bullying you with numbers.” Mo Li laughed and also attacked, slashing his sword through the void.

“Junior brother, watch out. Big sister is also coming.” Han Wei flicked her finger, and a thin zither string appeared in the void, slicing toward Long Chen. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

At this moment, Zi Yang also attacked, unleashing a wave of violet qi that filled the sky. After that, drakes swirled within the qi, resonating with heaven and earth.

All five Sovereigns were attacking at once. With a simple wave of their hands, the heavens collapsed and the earth was torn asunder. Space was twisted too wildly for the people to even see Long Chen’s figure.

BOOM!

Long Chen’s figure suddenly appeared. He was flying back, and his chest had been pierced.

BOOM!

Long Chen had only just blocked Mo Li’s silent sword when a violet palm struck his back. Hence, the sound of bones breaking rang out, and Long Chen smashed into the twisting space once more, vanishing from sight.

“Boss!”

Guo Ran cried out. Although he usually had blind faith in Long Chen, the latter was now facing five Sovereigns. Just how was Long Chen supposed to beat them?

Meng Qi, Chu Yao, Tang Wan-er, Ye Zhiqiu, Dong Mingyu, and the others were all worried. This heavenly tribulation was a tribulation of sure death without the slightest chance of passing.

The Sovereigns that had called Long Chen brother had now become hostile, unleashing killing blow after killing blow. They didn’t show any mercy.

BOOM!

With another explosion, Long Chen’s figure reappeared. This time, his condition was even worse. The dragon scales covering his body had been shattered, and there were many places where they could see bone and even his insides.

“Long Chen…” Tears welled out of Meng Qi’s eyes. Seeing him fight for his life, she felt like blades were stabbing her heart.

Long Chen stamped on the air, narrowly avoiding Han Wei’s zither string. After that, he suddenly slashed Evilmoon behind him.

The space behind him twisted, and a palm came out. It exploded on contact with Evilmoon, revealing Yun Shang.

Even though Long Chen was covered in blood, he continued to be overflowing with battle intent, and he attacked Yun Shang.

“Long Chen, Sovereign Yun Shang is the first generation and also the strongest Sovereign. If you want to survive this, you should first target Sovereign Zi Yang. He is the weakest in comparison,” warned Yun Tian as he watched from outside the heavenly tribulation.

As Sovereign Yun Shang’s son, Yun Tian naturally knew more about him. Long Chen was surrounded by the five Sovereigns, but he was still crazily attacking Yun Shang. That was the worst strategy.

Although Long Chen’s injuries were rapidly healed by the primal chaos space, if this continued, he would be the one to die in the end.

The correct method would be to think of some way to defeat the weakest Sovereign, Zi Yang. Only then would he have some chance of victory.

However, Long Chen didn’t change tactics. He continued to go all-out against Yun Shang, while still dealing with the attacks of the other four Sovereigns.

Suddenly, Long Chen flew back and coughed up three mouthfuls of blood. As his chest was pierced by Zi Yang’s sword, he hastily drew out the energy of the Heavenly Qilin Demon Trees to recover. After that, with a slash of his saber, he blocked Qing Xu’s attack and then once more charged back at Yun Shang.

“Has boss been influenced by Evilmoon? Did he want vengeance on Sovereign Yun Shang?” Xia Chen was pale.

Even Yun Tian had warned him, but Long Chen was still focused on Yun Shang. If this continued, he really would be doomed. Everyone had noticed that his aura was starting to drop after being injured repeatedly.

Against all five Sovereigns, Long Chen had lasted half an incense stick’s worth of time, and that was already an incomparably amazing achievement. It could be said that no one had ever done this in the past, nor would there ever be someone to do this in the future. However, Long Chen would still be the one to perish if this went on.

“Long Chen…” Yun Tian suddenly began to form hand seals. His voice resonated with heaven and earth.

“Backing out midway isn’t my style. If I can’t beat big brother Yun Shang, I’m not qualified to look for my parents. I must win!”

Yun Tian had barely spoken when Long Chen’s hoarse yet determined voice shook the sky.

At this moment, Meng Qi, Chu Yao, Guo Ran, and the others’ expressions changed. Long Chen was actually viewing Sovereign Yun Shang as a goal for himself to search for his parents. Right now, he only had two paths before him: defeat Yun Shang or die.
