Chapter 2681 Full Firepower

The nine dragons in Long Aotian’s manifestation suddenly opened their eyes. An aura that didn’t belong to this world rapidly rose.

“What is that?”

Startled cries rang out. The nine dragons flew out of Long Aotian’s manifestation, and his aura instantly erupted into a terrifying realm.

“Nine ancestral dragon souls have been summoned. The power of the nine dragons has been added to his Heavenly Dao energy. Then the current Long Aotian…” The High Priest fell into deep thought.

“Should I use the Northern Source Sword to…” Daoist Heavenly Feather whispered.

“You will definitely die if you enter the tribulation,” said the High Priest.

“It’s worth this old life of mine to remove that scourge Long Aotian.” Daoist Heavenly Feather smiled slightly.

“Even if you enter the tribulation, you might not be able to kill Long Aotian. Furthermore, if you do die to his tribulation, that will seriously affect Long Chen. Who knows what he’ll do if you die in front of him? Right now, it still seems like everything is under his control. They are the main characters of this world. We just have to take action at the critical moment.”

“Then when will that critical moment come?” asked Daoist Heavenly Feather.

“I don’t know either. I’ve simply received the instruction from the Wine God to fully trust Long Chen. As for the details, the Wine God has not divulged the slightest bit to me. So it’s impossible for us to have a dominating role. We just need to support Long Chen,” said the High Priest.

At this time, dragon roars filled the air. Long Aotian’s body also became covered in dragon scales, forming a thick battle armor. Dragon Qi swirled around him, and his aura was growing increasingly frightening.

In the distance, the dragon woman’s expression changed. That was because there was a black dragon amongst Long Aotian’s nine dragons.

Furthermore, that was an ancestral dragon amongst black dragons. Ancestral dragons were dragon kings that had opened up a new bloodline path. They could be considered the ancestors of their bloodlines, the ones who laid down a foundation for their descendants. They created different cultivation techniques and divine abilities, resulting in a change in their bloodline. The dragons that followed them would inherit those new abilities.

Only a dragon king that had opened a new bloodline inheritance was qualified to be called an ancestral dragon. In this case, that black dragon’s power possessed a suppressive effect on her that made her extremely irritated.

This meant that in the future, if she fought against Long Aotian, that black dragon’s might cause her to be unable to release her full power.

Furthermore, Long Aotian might very likely know the divine abilities of the black dragon race due to this. In the future, she would definitely be at a disadvantage against him.

“Long Chen, no matter how you struggle, it’s meaningless. You are fated to be my stepping stone. Just die.”

Long Aotian stamped on the void, and the nine dragons behind him quivered. His dragon spear smashed toward Long Chen.

The void collapsed in the face of a giant spear-image. It was like a heavenly celestial weapon smashing down.

BOOM!

Long Chen raised Evilmoon to block, but in front of that giant spear, he appeared incredibly miniscule. The void exploded, and Long Chen was smashed into the sea.

Huge waves burst out of the sea, filling the sky with water.

“Not good!” The people watching sensed a terrifying water energy contained in that water. Every drop possessed the possibility of killing them. With no time to run, they took out their weapons and attacked. Rumbling rang out.

Countless experts coughed up blood. Although their combined power had suppressed this fallout, they turned pale. These were just some waves from their battle but already possessed this much power. If they were in the core region as well, wouldn’t they simply die?

After that single spear, the sea began to roar and form a giant whirlpool. Long Aotian’s spear was controlling the sea. This whirlpool seemed to reach the bottom of the sea.

“Where is Long Chen?” Startled cries rang out. Long Chen didn’t reappear.

“His aura is gone! Could it be…?”

Long Chen’s aura could no longer be sensed. People began to panic. Had he really been killed?

“Boss!” The Dragonblood warriors roared furiously. They were about to charge into the tribulation.

“Wait!” Meng Qi extended an arm, stopping them. “Long Chen is definitely fine. This tribulation is his. If something happened to him, the five Sovereigns would definitely vanish. Don’t you see that the five Sovereigns are still calm?”

When they looked at the Sovereigns, they truly did see that their expressions were flat. They didn’t react at all to this giant whirlpool.

BOOM! The giant whirlpool suddenly exploded, and a black-robed figure charged out.

“It’s boss!” Just as the Dragonblood warriors began to cheer, their faces fell. One of Long Chen’s arms was a bloody mess, and his black robes were in tatters.

“Long Chen is injured!”

People couldn’t help being horrified, but thinking about it, it only made sense. Surviving such a terrifying attack was practically a miracle.

Long Aotian’s heart shook. Just now, he had not held back at all. But he still hadn’t managed to kill Long Chen.

Furthermore, although Long Chen’s current condition looked bad, his aura did not show any signs of weakening. That meant that it wasn’t a serious injury to him.

At this moment, silence fell, and the sound of blood dripping was the only thing present. That was Long Chen’s blood dripping into the sea. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

Long Chen’s eyes were open now, and they were no longer red. He no longer seemed insane.

Instead, his eyes were calm, but the calmness was even more frightening than the crazed look from before. It was like the gaze of an emotionless death god, someone who had grown numb to reaping lives.

“Just a few mudfish. The power of nine dragons? Long Aotian, you’re trash. My Spirit Blood, Spirit Root, and Spirit Bone are in your body, yet you humiliate them with this display? You aren’t fit for them. Even if you give a monkey some dragon robes, they aren’t an emperor. At best, you are a dancing clown. I’ll take back what belongs to me today,” said Long Chen.

“Keep dreaming. I have the support of nine dragons and the Heavenly Dao energy. I am the very heavens. What will you use to fight me?” sneered Long Aotian. Despite his shock at Long Chen’s power, he remained confident.

“I’ll use this.”

Long Chen’s divine ring suddenly shuddered, and six stars illuminated the world. A berserk power exploded and caused heaven and earth to change color.

“Six Star Battle Armor!” Long Chen’s voice was like thunder ringing out through the sky, reaching every corner of the world.
