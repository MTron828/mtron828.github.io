Chapter 5048 Golden Crow Totem

Seeing this lineup, Long Chen knew there was no way this would end peacefully. He couldn’t help but be speechless. How was he this unlucky?

“I asked you a question! Are you deaf?!” shouted a disciple of the Golden Crow race angrily.

“Big Brother Long Chen...” transmitted Huo Linger.

“What is it?” asked Long Chen.

“These Heavenly Chosens have Heavenly Fate Totems on their bodies. I feel like I can absorb and refine them. I want to try raising them on the Fusang Trees,” replied Huo Linger quietly. Even though it was a spiritual transmission, she was still afraid of others overhearing her.

While quiet, her voice was full of excitement and anticipation, as if she had made a great discovery. When these people appeared, the Fusang Trees in the primal chaos space seemed to stir actively.

The Fusang Trees were intimately linked to the Golden Crow race, serving as their life partners and sources of mutual nourishment. In the past, Long Chen had encountered some Golden Crow experts but had never sensed any odd reaction from the Fusang Trees.

In truth, even now, Long Chen didn’t sense anything, but Huo Linger did. Perhaps after Huo Linger became a Heavenly Chosen, her heightened spiritual perception allowed her to detect the subtle thirst emanating from the Fusang Trees.

Suddenly, one of the disciples grew impatient and lunged towards Long Chen. A hand enveloped in flames shot out, aiming for Long Chen’s neck.

As soon as he made contact with Long Chen’s neck, Long Chen swiftly vanished, leaving the disciple bewildered. The next moment, Long Chen’s hand was like a vice grip wrapping around the disciple’s neck, lifting him off the ground.

The disciple, merely a nine star Doyen, wasn’t even close to being Long Chen’s match. Long Chen’s swift action startled the two-vein Heaven Saints among the Golden Crow experts.

“Brat, if you dare harm him, you’ll regret ever being born!” shouted one of the two-vein Heaven Saints.

Huo Linger whispered, “Big Brother Long Chen, this one is useless. He can’t condense a Golden Crow Totem.”

Hearing this, Long Chen tightened his grip, causing golden flames to erupt as the disciple’s blood splattered on the ground. Without hesitation, Long Chen crushed him. He had no intention of being threatened by anyone, especially not someone useless.

After killing him, Long Chen feigned ignorance. “What did you say just now? You were talking too fast. Can you say it again?”

“You are courting death!” The Golden Crow race’s experts were enraged. They had not expected Long Chen to dare kill their people in front of them.

The two-vein Heaven Saints were about to attack, but one of the disciples took the initiative. He was a Heavenly Chosen, and his Heavenly Fate Disk gleamed like a radiant golden sun, pulsating with intense Doyen power.

“Leave this brat to me!” said the Heavenly Chosen. He closed in on Long Chen swiftly, and his claw aimed straight for Long Chen’s throat, mirroring the previous disciple’s move.

Clearly, this person was extremely confident. The power behind his claw was over a hundred times greater than that from the dead disciple, causing the space around Long Chen to distort violently even before impact.

Seeing him unleash such a sharp attack, the two-vein Heaven Saints stopped their attacks. In their minds, this was enough to end things. Among all the disciples, three were Heavenly Chosens, and this person was the strongest of them.

“Big Brother Long Chen, kill him! I’ll absorb his Heavenly Fate Totem!” shouted Huo Linger excitedly.

Long Chen slowly raised his hand, and a violet cross appeared on his palm.

BANG!

As a palm and a claw collided, instead of a deafening explosion or violent astral winds, there was only a faint sound. The Heavenly Chosen quivered, feeling a strange warmth flow from his palm into his body. It spread rapidly, concentrating intensely on his Dantian like molten lava.

The next moment, blood sprayed from his mouth, and he stared in horror at his own palm, now cracking apart like porcelain. The pieces crumbled and fell away. A scream escaped him, startling the other Golden Crow experts.

Then, without warning, his body exploded into golden divine light. A flame dragon materialized and swiftly consumed the dispersing radiance. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

With the violet blood God Slaying Cross, Long Chen had slain this Heavenly Chosen. His violet blood was incredibly magical, akin to a needle hidden in cotton. Its power was perfectly concentrated, capable of killing someone without damaging their core energy.

While the seven-color Supreme Blood and dragon-blood God Slaying Crosses wielded greater power, they lacked such precision. They would have blown the Heavenly Chosen’s body to bits, along with his core energy.

Hence, Long Chen had chosen to use the violet blood as he didn’t want to waste the core energy, which was devoured by Huo Linger. With one gulp, she immediately returned to the primal chaos space and spat it out on a Fusang Tree.

The Fusang Tree quivered as it absorbed this energy. Then, Long Chen was shocked to see a tiny golden crow squatting on one of its branches.

This crow was only the size of a palm, and it looked like a divine bird surrounded by golden flames. It was a Three-Foot Golden Crow.

Long Chen sensed Huo Linger’s spiritual fluctuations from its body, as well as another strange aura.

“Success! Success!” Huo Linger transformed into a little girl and picked up the little crow, spinning and dancing with it. At this moment, the entire forest of Fusang Trees grew active, sending their energy into the tiny crow’s body, causing it to grow with every blink of an eye.

As it grew, its fluctuations also became stronger. Long Chen marveled at this incredible discovery.

“Die!” Suddenly, a thunderous roar shook the air. The Golden Crow experts lunged at Long Chen like madmen, launching a ferocious assault.
