Chapter 3188 Handling It Himself

The sneak attack started quickly and ended just as quickly. In just a few breaths’ time, the outer academy was left a wreckage.

Many people felt that things were over before they even started. Seeing the destruction around them, they felt like they were in a nightmare. They couldn’t believe their eyes.

The reason Long Chen had managed to arrive so quickly was because the place where he had refined the dragon scale wasn’t that far. Bai Shishi had arrived quickly because she had been planning on going out for a trip.

However, by the time Qin Feng arrived, it was already over. As for young master Changchuan, Bai Xiaole, Luo Bing, Luo Ning, Mu Qingyun, and the others, they were still in seclusion after just finishing their tribulations. They didn’t know what was happening in the outside world.

The inner academy’s disciples rushed over only to see the devastation, and it dumbfounded them.

At this moment, the academy’s experts were organizing people to save the heavily wounded disciples and counting the losses. In just this short time, tens of thousands of outer academy disciples had been slain.

The only thing to be happy about was that the targets were the outer academy’s buildings, and those buildings had formations that helped the disciples block most of the power.

Otherwise, Divine Lords had enough power to wipe out all the outer academy’s disciples in just those few breaths.

Bai Zhantang was just as ashen as Long Chen but was dragged away by Bai Shishi’s mother. As for the higher-ups of the academy, they didn’t show themselves from the start.

“Long Chen, don’t take this to heart. Don’t fall for their bait,” urged Bai Shishi.

“Tell our seniors that there is no need for the academy to do anything about this matter. Within seven days, I will give the academy an explanation,” said Long Chen before turning around and leaving.

“Long Chen…”

Bai Shishi was startled. She then tried to grab him, but she couldn’t. The only good thing was that he was walking back into the inner academy, not out.

…

“What are you planning? After they’ve gone this far, are you still planning on cowering like tortoises in their shell?” Bai Zhantang’s voice rang in a palace hall.

This hall was where the dean and the various institute heads were gathered. Right now, all of them had grave expressions. Even the various institute heads had flames of fury in their eyes.

The dean frowned and barked, “If you want to keep shouting, then get out.”

For even the amicable dean to get angry, the furious Bai Zhantang instantly shrank back.

“Are we simply going to endure this?” demanded Bai Zhantang, his voice much quieter. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“After living for so many years, you still get angry at minor things. How can you do anything important without any steadiness? Do you think you are Long Chen? He is nothing more than a child in his twenties. Are you trying to learn how to do things impetuously without thinking about the consequences? Can a temper resolve your problems? If you bring the Battle God Palace’s experts out, will that resolve the problem?” asked the dean angrily.

“At the very least, we would protect the High Firmament Academy’s dignity,” declared Bai Zhantang.

Bai Shishi and Bai Xiaole’s mothers shook their heads. They also had no way to deal with his temper. In this state, only the dean could suppress him.

“Fool. If you don’t use our hidden power, how will you handle all the Bloodkill Hall’s experts that step across worlds? If you do use our hidden power, it will expose us, and we will no longer have a chance to secretly develop. Lord Brahma would declare war. Now isn’t the time for that, understood?” demanded Bai Letian angrily.

Bai Zhantang finally fell silent but was still ashen with rage. Although he was impetuous, he was no fool. He also knew that the Bloodkill Hall was trying to figure out their bottom line through this probing.

The deputy dean said, “For Enpuda to suddenly attack, there must be some scheme. He has incited so many sects of the Heavenly Swell Domain to attack us together. If we were to directly attack them all, they would definitely spread a story throughout the Heavenly Swell Domain to erase all of the contributions that the High Firmament Academy has made for the Heavenly Swell Domain. They will destroy our reputation. You can do ten thousand good things, only for one bad thing to erase all of them. Enpuda knows this, which is why he joined together so many sects and had them wear masks to attack us. This matter is truly thorny. There’s no way to counter them.”

“Then what are we going to do? Just endure like this? What about our disciples? Do we let them become the prey? If we can’t even protect our disciples, how long will we be able to last with no fresh blood?” demanded Bai Zhantang.

“There are two ways to resolve this. One is to attack, and the other is to defend. If we attack, our reputation would crumble, so it would be better to defend and activate the killing formation. Didn’t they say that they will undergo a large-scale assault if we don’t hand over Long Chen within seven days? We can wait for them to attack, and then we can kill as many as we want without anyone being able to say anything about it,” said an institute head.

Quite a few people nodded. This method was quite dependable. If they were going to come again, then the killing formation could kill them.

Just then, a voice came from outside the palace hall. “However, this will only encourage those little people’s arrogance. They will think that the High Firmament Academy has already fallen. People rarely send charcoal in winter, but they will throw stones at someone who falls into a well. Countless powers will think that the High Firmament Academy is weak enough for them to join the Bloodkill Hall against us. Although the Bloodkill Hall has said those ruthless words, if they don’t come in seven days and merely surround us, what can we do?”

Bai Shishi walked in. Her words were difficult to bear but correct. They couldn’t attack, and they wouldn’t have a chance to defend.

Normally, for Bai Shishi to barge into this place was a very rude conduct. However, Bai Letian merely smiled slightly. Even at such a young age, Bai Shishi was able to think this far.

“That fellow has said that he won’t make things hard for the High Firmament Academy. He’ll handle it himself.”

After saying that, Bai Shishi bowed to everyone. She turned and left, leaving behind the dumbfounded institute heads.
