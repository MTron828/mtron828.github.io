Chapter 3187 Despicable Shameless

Bai Shishi had arrived. Golden light shone from her entire body, and with a slash of her sword, golden light filled the world.

One of the Bloodkill Hall’s Primal Divine Lords was slain by this slash. It was unblockable.

BOOM!

Long Chen’s saber forced aside the other one, and he dodged the third one’s attack. Since Bai Shishi had come, there was no need for him to fight in such a risky manner.

Bai Shishi unleashed the second slash of her sword. Her target hastily dodged, only for her Sword Qi to cut through his legs. After that, the explosive Sword Qi blasted his entire body apart.

Not only was his physical body destroyed, but even his Yuan Spirit as well. Having advanced to the Four Peak realm and obtaining a peak rank Heavenly Dao rune, Bai Shishi’s metal energy was so sharp that it was as if nothing could stop it.

Fighting across realms was so easy for her now. In comparison, Long Chen seemed weak.

This was because he was still in the Divine Flame realm, and there was a powerful realm suppression. Furthermore, his opponent was not an ordinary Divine Lord but also a Primal. To fight across two realms against a Primal and still not be defeated was already extremely shocking.

If Long Chen hadn’t advanced to the peak of the Divine Flame realm and refined the golden dragon scale, allowing his physical body to strengthen by an unknown number of times, he wouldn’t have been able to endure the first attack that contained the power of the Heavenly Daos.

As for the Golden Dragon Battle Armor, it still wasn’t time to summon it. The golden dragon scale had just been refined.

On the other hand, Bai Shishi was different. After absorbing the Heavenly Dao runes, her attack naturally contained Heavenly Dao energy, so she wasn’t stifled like Long Chen. This was the advantage of her realm.

Just then, the void shuddered and eight spatial gates appeared around Long Chen and Bai Shishi.

“Not good!”

Long Chen’s expression changed. This was another trap. Those three Primal Divine Lords were actually just bait.

The next moment, eight daggers stabbed out like bolts of lightning, not giving either of them any chance to react. Furthermore, space froze around them, preventing them from moving.

This was clearly the pressure of peak Divine Lords, and those that had fully activated their primal bloodline at that.

Long Chen could sense the auras of the Bloodkill Hall’s experts, but it seemed that the enemy side had factored that in. Just as he thought that the assassins were slain and he relaxed ever so slightly, they suddenly opened the spatial gates, giving him no time to react.

Those eight daggers were Treasure items, and they contained the full power of eight late stage Divine Lords. Let alone Long Chen and Bai Shishi, even an Immortal King might meet their end facing this attack.

BOOM!

The eight daggers collided and space exploded. Startled cries rang out from the crowd.

However, just as they thought that Long Chen and Bai Shishi were slain, they found that the two of them had vanished. Bai Xiaole’s mother then appeared, forming hand seals. As space twisted, Long Chen and Bai Shishi appeared behind her.

Just then, two sharp swords slashed toward those eight figures. However, those eight figures, after failing their first attack, went back into the spatial gates and vanished. The spatial gates then crumbled behind them, and the two swords missed.

At this moment, the invaders running rampant crushed their jade talismans and vanished as well. The entire battlefield became empty in an instant, leaving behind only ruins.

“Fuck, they really pissed me off this time! Chase them!”

Bai Zhantang and Bai Shishi’s mother also appeared. They were one step too late.

“Don’t chase cornered enemies.” Bai Shishi’s mother hastily stopped him. The Battle God Palace’s experts also arrived, their expressions ugly. However, if Bai Zhantang didn’t chase after the enemies, they couldn’t either.

“Cornered my ass! They aren’t cornered at all! This is a naked provocation! I definitely cannot endure this!” roared Bai Zhantang.

Long Chen’s expression was also ugly. Their enemies hadn’t been planning on dealing a devastating blow to the High Firmament Academy. They were only probing the academy. They had even set up a trap just to kill him.

If it hadn’t been for Bai Xiaole’s mother arriving in time and using her spatial art to save them, they would have lost their lives here.

It was definitely Enpuda who was unwilling to simply swallow his anger. He wanted revenge. So, this was a testing blow, as well as a declaration of war.

So many sects also participated. Just what was Enpuda doing? It seemed that ever since the High Firmament Academy was established, it had never suffered such a grievance.

BOOM!

Just then, a bunch of jade talismans exploded in the air. A provoking voice rang throughout the entire High Firmament Academy.

“Long Chen dared to kill the Killing God’s disciple. He has committed a huge sin. If the High Firmament Academy does not want such a play to repeat itself, hand over the culprit.”

BOOM!

Another jade talisman exploded and another voice rang out. “Long Chen, everyone who was killed today died because of you. You think of yourself as a hero? If you don’t want more innocent people of the High Firmament Academy to die because of you, obediently leave the academy.”

These talismans had clearly been thrown out in advance before they left.

“Despicable!”

“Shameless!” DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

Everyone was enraged. The Bloodkill Hall was too shameless to use such a despicable means to force Long Chen to send himself to his death.

Without the High Firmament Academy, how was Long Chen, a Divine Flame disciple, supposed to fight the Bloodkill Hall?

The most shameless thing was that they placed the blame for all these deaths on Long Chen and the High Firmament Academy.

Another talisman exploded. “Seven days later, our Bloodkill Hall’s seven branch halls will gather in the Dao Dawn Domain. We’ll give you seven days. If you still don’t hand over Long Chen by then. These seven branch halls along with the thousands of sects in the Dao Dawn Domain will fight to the death against your High Firmament Academy. Perhaps we won’t dare to enter the High Firmament Academy, but anyone who steps one foot outside will be mercilessly killed. Do your best.”

Hearing this, Long Chen was furious and veins throbbed on his forehead. Upon looking at the corpses and blood in this wreckage, his killing intent exploded.

“Long Chen, calm down. They’re doing this intentionally. The academy isn’t afraid of them,” said Bai Shishi. She thought that he really would leave the academy.

“It seems that the lesson I gave them last time wasn’t enough. Then don’t blame Boss Long San for being vicious.”

Looking at the fragments of the jade talismans, he had a brazen idea. Seven days? Good, that was enough.
