Chapter 1323 Nourishing the Soul

Translator: BornToBe

Long Chen, Bao Buping, and Chang Hao all vomited blood as they fell from the sky.

“Those shameless old bastards, they forgot about us after just drinking a bit of cat piss!” roared Bao Buping.

Long Chen, Bao Buping, and Chang Hao just happened to see an ancient pavilion on a mountain peak as they fell to the ground. Inside, Li Tianxuan, Ling Yunzi, and Yue Qingshan were drinking wine, while Zheng Wenlong attended to them.

“As expected, it wasn’t even an incense stick’s worth of time.” Li Tianxuan smiled upon seeing Long Chen’s group of three.

“Brother Long, what happened?” Zheng Wenlong couldn’t help but ask upon seeing their wretched appearances.

“Don’t even ask. Those shameless bastards, after drinking a few bowls of cat piss, they started fighting,” said Long Chen gloomily.

When Tu Qianshang, Boss Bao, and the others had entered the Reincarnation Mirror, they had all been in a good mood. From within the Reincarnation Mirror, they could see all the scenery in ten thousand miles. It was definitely beautiful. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Tu Qianshang had also sincerely treated the bosses to his wine. Each one of them had drunk over ten bowls right at the start, and as a result, the bosses who were not used to Tu Qianshang’s wine instantly began to overflow with battle intent. Without a word, they suddenly began to fight.

They had completely forgotten about Long Chen, Bao Buping, and Chang Hao. Due to the intense stimulation of Tu Qianshang’s wine, the bosses started a fierce, chaotic battle, and their terrifying auras had sent the three of them flying.

It was no wonder Bao Buping would curse them. Boss Bao had clearly said that he would bring them to drink wine, but before they had drunk much at all, they ended up vomiting blood.

Long Chen supposed he could understand this. With the intense stimulation of that wine, it would have been strange if they didn’t start fighting. But the main thing was that they had forgotten about the three of them. If they hadn’t run fast enough, they might have been killed.

“The Xuan Master truly has foresight. Disciple is filled with admiration.” Long Chen bitterly smiled.

Clearly, Li Tianxuan had long since known this would happen. Otherwise, as the host, there was no way he wouldn’t go accompany them. That was lacking manners. But now it was clear just how wise his choice had been.

He also realized why Li Tianxuan would use a divine item as a place for them to drink. Yes, it provided beautiful scenery, but it also prevented them from damaging the buildings of the sect.

Within the Reincarnation Mirror, they could fight as they pleased. It was two birds with one stone.

“Long Chen, you’ve come at the right time. I have to leave, so I can say goodbye now,” said Ling Yunzi.

“Sect leader, why do you have to go so soon? Why not stay for a few days?” Long Chen was startled.

“One reason I came was for you, but another is for Zifeng. That child is a rarely seen genius of the Sword Dao. With his soul sealed in his sword, it’s actually a huge opportunity for him. This is when he can sense the true essence of the Sword Dao. I came to bring him back to the Heavenly Sword Gate. Within the Heavenly Sword Gate, there are many opportunities for sword cultivators, so I’ll bring him to test his luck”

Only then did Long Chen understand. He gave Ling Yunzi a stone coffin containing Yue Zifeng’s body. Ling Yunzi looked at Yue Zifeng and nodded. He said goodbye to Li Tianxuan and Yue Qingshan, and left with Yue Zifeng.

Yue Qingshan also said, “I have some urgent matters to attend to, so I won’t disturb you any longer. If the Xuantian Dao Sect needs anything in the future, you just have to send a message to Wenlong.”

Despite how Li Tianxuan tried to get him to stay longer, Yue Qinshan still left. However, he left behind Zheng Wenlong. Zheng Wenlong was a disciple he viewed extremely highly, and he left everything here to him to handle.

Boss Bao and the others stayed in the Reincarnation Mirror for a full week. Each day, they drank and fought delightedly.

On the other hand, Long Chen brought Bao Buping, Chang Hao, and Zheng Wenlong to Crouching Dragon Mountain to celebrate.

Although they weren’t members of the Dragonblood Legion, they were people Long Chen trusted greatly. They spent all day drinking and eating, also passing these days happily.

This time, the Xuantian Dao Sect’s show of power had gone perfectly with Long Chen at the helm. They had slapped their opponents’ faces. At least for a short time, there wouldn’t be anyone who dared to do anything to the Xuantian Dao Sect. It gave them precious time to breathe.

After the week, Boss Bao found Long Chen and transmitted the fifth form of Split the Heavens to him.

Bao Buping had brought out the Heaven Splitting Divine Tablet’s guidance from Devil Spirit Mountain. Their originally deviated version of Split the Heavens had been corrected.

In the future, they would be able to use Split the Heavens with even greater power. Boss Bao had Long Chen change a few mistakes in his technique.

Regretfully, Long Chen couldn’t use his spiritual yuan, so he could only forcibly remember this. But he had no way of practicing.

As for Boss Bao, he actually couldn’t display it to him, because he had cultivated in the old form of Split the Heavens for too long. The way that he used it had been set in stone, and fixing it would be a thousand times more difficult for him.

That was why Long Chen, Bao Buping, and Chang Hao would be able to correct the mistakes in their Split the Heavens much faster.

After that, Boss Bao and the other bosses brought away Bao Buping and Chang Hao. Tu Qianshang left Long Chen a few jugs of his fierce wine. He told him that he had originally brought much more, but the bosses had drunk the rest.

After Tu Qianshang left, Zheng Wenlong discussed a few things about their future strategy with Long Chen before also leaving.

The Xuantian Dao Sect returned to its previous calm. After just a few days, people from the Martial Heaven Alliance came.

However, they did not include Deng Cang. It was a completely different group who came to alert the Xuantian Dao Sect that they could take out their reward now.

Other than that, they brought some news about Deng Cang. Due to his abuse of power, he had gravely harmed the righteous image of the Martial Heaven Alliance, and was currently imprisoned in one of the alliance’s underground prisons. Assuming nothing unexpected happened, he would probably be imprisoned there until he died.

Long Chen didn’t find this result unexpected at all. The Martial Heaven Alliance had been forced by public opinion to do something so harsh. Even if it was just for others to see, they still had to do it.

Li Tianxuan politely received them in a very magnanimous way. He even asked for leniency for Deng Cang, saying that he hadn’t had any bad intentions and had only been deceived by others.

In truth, this was nothing more than a formality. The matter was already closed. Unless all the Righteous powers were gathered, there was no way to change his imprisonment.

But by saying this, Li Tianxuan gave the Martial Heaven Alliance a way to keep their face, allowing those people to relax. The main reason they had come was to ease any untoward feelings. Li Tianxuan’s cooperation delighted them.

After all, they were just errand boys. If this went badly, they would be hard-pressed, so they were grateful to Li Tianxuan.

After confirming what rewards Li Tianxuan wanted, they returned in just three days with everything.

They were simply helping each other out. Li Tianxuan didn’t make things hard on them, and so to express their gratitude, the long procedure which should have taken several months was done in just three days. And they had even personally come to bring the rewards to their door.

They had killed a huge number of Corrupt experts in Devil Spirit Mountain, and their reward was also huge. It was practically enough to rebuild the entire Xuantian Dao Sect. That was why Deng Cang had been so greedy for it.

These people had chatted with the others who had previously come to mediate things, and one of them secretly told Li Tianxuan that it was Deng Cang who had taken the initiative to speak to Pill Valley. His goal had been to devour this reward. Once he sent this reward to Pill Valley, Pill Valley would split it with him.

This reward was enough to make countless sects greedy. But Li Tianxuan decided to take a huge pile of cultivation resources as the reward. He was planning on using this entire reward on strengthening their current generation of disciples.

Previously, they hadn’t had the money to raise their disciples. In truth, the so-called geniuses were made through piling resources.

No matter how talented a disciple was, without any resources as support, their talent would be wasted.

Whether it was the cultivation environment, the support of formations, trials, weapons, pills, and medicines, they all needed money.

Right now, the reason the Dragonblood Legion was so strong didn’t even have much to do with the Xuantian Dao Sect. They had grown by relying on Long Chen’s efforts.

As for that huge battle, if it hadn’t been for the Dragonblood Legion, the Xuantian Dao Sect wouldn’t have been able to devour such a huge piece of meat. They would have been forced to share it with others, and perhaps at that time, their share of meat might even be snatched away.

Now Li Tianxuan had used the Dragonblood Legion to earn such a huge amount of wealth, and he naturally wouldn’t use that wealth to expand the sect. He’d use it all to raise them.

The huge amount of wealth that poured into the Xuantian Dao Sect was immediately used to strengthen the cultivation regions. Everything was rebuilt according to the highest standards.

The Dragonblood Legion’s disciples were allowed to cultivate in these places freely. As for the other disciples, their rations were increased by hundreds of times. The atmosphere of the Xuantian Dao Sect completely transformed.

It was like a beggar had become a rich person decked in wealth. That kind of feeling made countless disciples smile even in their dreams.

Long Chen spent these few days relaxing. He accompanied Meng Qi and Tang Wan-er around the Xuantian Dao Sect.

“Long Chen, give me Little Snow’s crystal core. Recently, I’ve learned a strange art. I can use the Myriad Spirit Diagram to nourish Little Snow’s soul. Give me the crystal core, and I’ll place it within the Myriad Spirit Diagram. Only once Little Snow’s soul is strong enough can he take over a powerful creature’s body and be reborn,” said Meng Qi.

“Are you sure?” Long Chen was delighted to hear this. Little Snow had always been a knot in his heart. Now if they could perhaps find a ninth rank or tenth rank Magical Beast, then with Meng Qi’s help, it really might not be a problem for Little Snow to be reborn.

But Long Chen didn’t know where his limit was. He didn’t want Little Snow to be reborn and then very quickly be unable to keep up with him. He’d rather not suffer that kind of pain again. He wanted Little Snow to keep up with him forever.

He had never found a suitable target. Furthermore, he had also been growing increasingly worried about how Little Snow’s soul was supposed to take over a powerful creature’s body.

“The Myriad Spirit Diagram is extremely miraculous. Although I’m still learning about it, nourishing Little Snow’s soul is no problem.” Meng Qi smiled and placed Little Snow’s crystal core into the Myriad Spirit Diagram.
