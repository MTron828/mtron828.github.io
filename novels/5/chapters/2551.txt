Chapter 2540 Dragon Slayer

Long Chen’s vision changed as he arrived at the edge of a bottomless abyss that looked like a gaping maw in the ground. Dragon roars occasionally rang out from within.

This was the Poison Dragon Abyss, the main lair of the poison dragons. According to Ling Xi, this place was also a Ten Thousand Dragon Nest.

The king of the poison dragons had been the Heaven Devouring Fiend King’s steed. However, that poison dragon had been killed by the king of the spirit dragons. Despite that, the poison dragon king had managed to strike the spirit dragon king with its poison, which resulted in the spirit dragon king’s death in the end.

If it hadn’t been for that poison, the Heaven Devouring Fiend King wouldn’t have been able to fight to the death with the spirit dragon king.

In order to preserve its power, the fiend king had hidden the poison dragon’s Ten Thousand Dragon Nest within an abyss. Due to its existence, there was an evil qi present that was poison to the Luo Spirit race.

After spending so many years developing, there were now countless poison dragons inside. Demonic bugs had also grown from the evil qi and were the main sustenance for the poison dragons.

The poison dragons inside seemed bound by some law and were unable to come out of the abyss. They could only be active within. Even after so many years, they hadn’t charged out into the Star Field Divine World.

The Luo Spirit race was unable to provoke them, so they had coexisted for all these years. Based on Ling Xi’s estimate, those poison dragons had a spiritual seal placed on them.

As for the one to lay down that seal, it was most likely the Heaven Devouring Fiend King. It was one of his backup plans for when he revived as they would be his new army.

However, those plans were destroyed when Ye Ming set his gaze on the fiend king. The latter had been possessed by him, becoming his tool. In the end, Ye Ming had detonated his corpse, so the Poison Dragon Abyss was truly a masterless existence now.

“Evilmoon, do you have a way to control them? Hehe, if I could bring an army of poison dragons to the Martial Heaven Continent…” Long Chen looked into the abyss and saw poison dragons hibernating like bats.

“What’s the point of bringing back a pile of trash? Without the dragon king, this Ten Thousand Dragon Nest can’t even produce poison dragons of the thirteenth rank. They’re nothing more than reptiles to those experts above Netherpassage. They can destroy these dragons with a wave of their hands. You’re hoping they’ll be of help against experts of that level?” Evilmoon snorted disdainfully.

“There are no thirteenth rank poison dragons here? Why?” asked Long Chen.

“The poison dragon race’s Ten Thousand Dragon Nest is different from the spirit dragon race’s. The king of the poison dragons will only permit those absolutely obedient to him to progress. Otherwise, they’ll threaten his existence. It’s a bit similar to the dark evil dragon race. My subordinates had to swear on their soul and blood to be loyal to me in order for me to allow them to advance to the thirteenth rank. If someone went against that, they would be suppressed by the laws of the Ten Thousand Dragon Nest, and I would immediately go eat them,” said Evilmoon lightly.

“What a con,” snorted Long Chen.

“You’re a human. You don’t understand. Without those bindings or suppression, dragons will definitely fight back. They’ll eventually try to kill me and replace me. Are you not afraid of your subordinates betraying you one day and taking your place?” retorted Evilmoon.

“If they want to take my place, why would they kill me? If they want to be the boss, I’d happily give them the spot. It would save me from being so tired all the time. I’d like to find a big tree to rely on,” said Long Chen. “Furthermore, they’re not my subordinates but my brothers. The reason we could band together is because we are unwilling to be controlled by fate. We have a similar goal, which is to live freely and with dignity. Within this chaotic world, who knows how much longer we’ll live? Just like this, we had some brothers who are forever gone. We’re still too weak to control our own fates, so why would they bother fighting for the position of boss?”

Long Chen sighed. This battle had shown him that he was still too weak. Perhaps… he couldn’t yield any longer. Any further yielding would draw himself into the abyss of death.

“Let’s not talk about those things. Do you have a way to help me subdue those poison dragons?” asked Long Chen.

“I do.”

“Haha, great!”

“No.”

“What?”

“Because I won’t tell you.”

“What the fuck?” raged Long Chen.

“They’re a disgrace to the dragon race, an insult to our sacred and noble blood. They shouldn’t exist in this world. If you want to kill them, I’ll help you. But if you want to subdue them, then you understand,” said Evilmoon.

“Fine, then let’s kill them. I want their poison.” Long Chen could only acquiesce.

“Alright, prepare yourself…”

Buzz.

Suddenly, space fluctuated and Qi Li appeared with millions of the Luo Spirit race’s warriors.

“Why are you all here?” asked Long Chen, startled.Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

“We came to help. We can wipe out the poison dragons together,” said Qi Li excitedly.

“It’s very dangerous. Once the poison dragons charge out, it’ll cause huge casualties. Don’t mess around and go back,” said Long Chen directly.

He had fought countless battles, but he still hadn’t managed to harden his heart to the point of calmly seeing the people beside him die in battle. The sight of the Luo Spirit race’s disciples self-detonating to buy him time was a nightmare to him. He didn’t want to experience something like that ever again.

Qi Li’s eyes reddened. Rather than being scared away, she stubbornly said, “Although we’re not as strong as you, we’re not afraid of death. We have a duty to eliminate enemies for our fallen clansmen. We’re not going to retreat because of fear.”

That stubbornness made Long Chen feel an urge to both laugh and cry. He was unable to scare her off.

He was going to try to persuade her one more time when Evilmoon suddenly said, “Have them stay. They can be of help. Although we can’t use them here, they’ll definitely be useful on Guo Ran’s side.”

Long Chen was startled and quickly understood Evilmoon’s intentions. He nodded, and to Qi Li who was bitterly holding back tears, he said, “Fine, you can stay. But you have to listen to my orders.”

Only then did Qi Li smile and wipe away her wet eyes. After that, Long Chen slowly walked into the abyss with Evilmoon, and Countless poison dragons charged over.

“You just have to circulate your Spiritual Strength. Leave the rest to me,” said Evilmoon.

Suddenly, a black two-headed dragon appeared behind Long Chen. Its four eyes had flickering runes inside of them, and its appearance caused the world to rumble.

“Damn, this is your true body? You have two heads?” exclaimed Long Chen. When Evilmoon woke Long Chen up last time, he was in a strange state and couldn’t remember this form.

“Shut up. Do you even know how mighty a two-headed evil dragon is? I’m a genius that might not appear again in millions of years. If you don’t talk so much, you won’t appear so stupid,” roared Evilmoon.

Long Chen was startled by Evilmoon’s anger. It seemed that having two heads was one of Evilmoon’s proudest points.

This roar contained a mighty dragon pressure. Affected by it, the poison dragons suddenly stiffened and fell, unable to move.

“Dragon pressure suppression?” Long Chen stared, surprised.

The poison dragons fell to the ground, their bodies stiff. After that, they stared in terror at Long Chen, or more accurately, they stared at Evilmoon behind him.

“Damn, you’re amazing. Why didn’t you use this during the last battle?” asked Long Chen.

“What do you know? Those poison dragons were corpses being controlled. Spiritual and bloodline pressure are useless against them,” snorted Evilmoon, still angry at Long Chen’s foolishness.

“Amazing, truly amazing. Evilmoon, why can’t we discuss…”

“Shut up. If you want to enslave them, I’ll immediately retract the dragon pressure!” raged Evilmoon.

Long Chen could only give up on that thought. He turned to Qi Li. “Qi Li, you can go kill them now. Bring me their poison stingers, poison claws, poison fangs, and poison sacs.”

Qi Li and the others stared blankly, having anticipated a fierce battle. However, they hadn’t expected the poison dragons to instantly lose their ability to fight back upon seeing Evilmoon.

After that, the Luo Spirit race’s warriors quickly shot arrows that stabbed through the poison dragons’ eyes, instantly killing them. These frightening poison dragons were killed easily.

Qi Li also led a group to clean up the corpses that piled up. She then pulled out the things that Long Chen asked.

When no more poison dragons flew out, Long Chen went in deeper and had Evilmoon retract its dragon pressure to avoid scaring them.

After an hour, seven waves of poison dragons had attacked, and at this point, Long Chen ran out of Spiritual Strength because Evilmoon was unleashing its dragon pressure through his Spiritual Strength.

Hence, he didn’t go any deeper and walked out, sending the piles of corpses into the primal chaos space.

When the poison dragon corpses landed in the black soil, the withered Heavenly Qilin Demon Trees finally began to show signs of life once more.
