Chapter 3766: Demonic Beasts Secretly Undergoing Tribulation

“Split the Heavens 3!”

Long Chen roared and slashed the Minghong Saber. As a result, a Supreme expert was blown back, but Long Chen’s injuries worsened.

After breaking through the blockade of the three Divine Venerates, Long Chen and Jiang Lei ran into several more groups intercepting them. However, in the final two, there were no Divine Venerates. In other words, they had reached the core, and only Divine Lords could enter this place.

Despite that, the demonic beast race’s Divine Lords came out in an unending tide. The two of them would encounter a new wave every few moments.

During normal times, Long Chen wouldn’t be afraid of them. However, he and Jiang Lei were severely wounded and had yet to have a chance to recover.

Long Chen pushed aside a Supreme heavenly genius and rushed away with Jiang Lei. In the distance, more roars could be heard. There were clearly others fighting the demonic beasts as well.

However, Long Chen didn’t go over. In the three thousand worlds, the least trustworthy existence was the human race.

Finally, they stopped running into more demonic beasts. Only then did Long Chen get a breather. He and Jiang Lei took time to recover.

As for Lei Linger, she had exhausted a huge amount of her core energy to block the attack of a Divine Venerate. She also needed to rest.

Huo Linger was the same. Having used the World Extermination Flame Lotus at such intensity, she was probably the weariest. It was only thanks to her that they had broken free of the encirclement.

“How vicious. One layer after another. Once I become an Immortal King, I’ll slaughter them,” cursed Jiang Lei as he recovered.

On the outside, there was a layer of experts to probe incoming enemies, the middle had Divine Venerates standing guard to close any gaps, and at the rear were Supreme heavenly geniuses making sure to finish off any fish that got through.

“Boss, am I useless? My comprehension isn’t good enough. My World Extermination Lightning Radiance is a far cry from yours. If I had your skill, we’d have definitely been able to kill those bastards,” said Jiang Lei dejectedly.

Long Chen had taught him the World Extermination Lightning Radiance, but it still lacked power compared to when Long Chen used it. Jiang Lei was unable to concentrate it even further like Long Chen.

Long Chen said, “This has nothing to do with comprehension. Your Supreme Blood has yet to adapt to you, and your thunderforce is also Lei Linger’s lightning tribulation energy. These energies didn’t originally belong to you. Don’t be anxious. During your tribulation, you can absorb its energy, as well as use it to temper your Supreme Blood and fully merge with it. Then your thunderforce will truly be yours.”

Jiang Lei’s expression improved after hearing that. As a Dragonblood warrior, he felt immense pressure. Every single person around him was outstanding. If he didn’t work hard, he’d be thrown behind.

Most importantly, he had a practically monstrous boss. If he didn’t go all-out, he’d be thrown so far behind that he couldn’t even see his back.

“Let’s go!”

Long Chen’s expression changed suddenly. They couldn’t keep recovering. They had just left when dozens of demonic beasts arrived where they had been.

One of them sniffed the air. “Two people, their Blood Qi is slightly weak. They should be severely injured. We’ll keep chasing.”

That group rushed off precisely in Long Chen’s direction.

BOOM!

A palm-sized formation disc exploded just then, and countless diamond-shaped fragments flew through the air. Those demonic beasts screamed and were turned into sieves.

“World Extermination Lightning Radiance!”

Suddenly, lightning exploded amongst them. Those demonic beasts, including a Supreme expert, were all slain.

“Why bother? These weaklings could have just been killed by your sword, no?” asked Long Chen.

The two of them were forced to repeatedly flee but were unable to shake off their pursuers. Hence, Long Chen chose to set up a trap with the formation disc that Xia Chen and Guo Ran had made.

“This is the only way it’s satisfying. I like seeing their corpses blasted out of existence, cough…” Jiang Lei suddenly had a coughing fit. His injuries that had just recovered a bit split open again.

The two of them then left this place and found a new location to recover. This time, there were finally no more pursuers.

Six hours later, they had recovered halfway. Like this, they wouldn’t have to fear fighting someone in the same realm.

As Long Chen recovered, he asked Huo Linger, “How did you lose control of the World Extermination Flame Lotus so quickly this time? What was the problem?”

“The Nirvana Scripture is different from before. Before this, it was gentle and easy to control. But now, it’s explosive. It’s like a sheep has become a dragon. Back then, the world’s energy poured in crazily, and my own power flowed into the lotus out of my control. Fortunately, you tossed it out in time. Any later and my core energy would have been completely sucked away. Then it would have blown up in your hand,” said Huo Linger.Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Hearing that, Long Chen began to sweat. If the World Extermination Flame Lotus had exploded in his hand, he really would have fallen to his own move.

“Big brother Long Chen, I’m sorry. I didn’t know the Nirvana Scripture would change so much, so I just acted according to the previous times. If I had exercised more control at the start, it wouldn’t have gotten out of control so quickly,” apologized Huo Linger.

“No, it’s my fault. I didn’t blame you. The main thing is… I also didn’t expect that a few changed syllables would cause such a huge change.” Long Chen smiled bitterly.

He truly didn’t blame Huo Linger. They had worked together to unleash the World Extermination Flame Lotus for so many years, and they had always done well. If someone had to be blamed for today’s accident, it would have to be him.

However, Long Chen was also delighted inside. This was the true Nirvana Scripture. If Huo Linger was more cautious and found the right rhythm, the World Extermination Flame Lotus’s power would exceed his imagination.

Even the third volume of the Nirvana Scripture was already so terrifying. If he could use the fifth volume, just how powerful would it be? Long Chen didn’t quite dare to believe it.

With no one disturbing them, Long Chen calmly recovered. Three days later, he and Jiang Lei were fully recovered.

Suddenly, they heard explosive sounds in the distance. A destructive aura shook their souls. Long Chen and Jiang Lei were both surprised. That aura was…

“Why would someone be undergoing tribulation at this time?”

Long Chen and Jiang Lei flew over to that region. They quickly saw thousands of demonic beast disciples undergoing collective tribulation.

“I understand. After these people undergo tribulation, they’ll come for us,” said Jiang Lei.

“You’re right. However, they’re thinking a bit too simply.” Long Chen suddenly smiled sinisterly. A lightning dragon flew out of him and slowly merged into the distant heavenly tribulation.
