Chapter 4885 Dragon Phoenix Space Piercer

A figure soaked in blood walked out of that twisting space, with a pitch-black saber resting on his shoulder. Every step he took made the world quiver.

“He really didn’t die...” Xing Wujiang sighed with relief. Long Chen’s power had far exceeded his expectations.

Others didn’t understand just how terrifying Huo Qianwu’s last attack was. Just now, the thousand phoenix feathers had lit up all at once, and the will of a thousand phoenixes merged together, capable of destroying not only the physical body but also the soul.

For a normal person, a single phoenix’s will was already something they couldn’t endure. However, Long Chen had endured a thousand times that; the pressure was unimaginable for outsiders. Each feather represented the supreme power of a phoenix. In her fury, Huo Qianwu had unleashed her mightiest blow, merging the power of a thousand feathers that could even annihilate a Heaven Saint.

Yet, Long Chen survived. Despite being covered in blood, he showed no signs of weakness; his gaze remained sharp. Instead, he resembled an injured wild beast—an existence at its most dangerous state when wounded.

Blood oozed out of Long Chen’s scales, staining his battle armor red. However, Long Chen didn’t use the primal chaos space’s energy to heal himself. Strangely, he actually felt a kind of pleasure in this pain.

Though his body and soul throbbed from enduring the attack, fear didn’t grip Long Chen. Instead, excitement and a formless power silently rose, rising within him.

“Your last attack wasn’t bad. I haven’t encountered such a powerful attack in a long time. After all, not many people in the same realm can injure me,” said Long Chen, the blood around him burning. His voice was like a quiet thunder shaking the world.

Long Chen continued to walk forward, his footsteps getting heavier, the flames around him growing brighter.

Previously, his dragon blood had been burning within him, but now, the essence blood on the surface of his skin was also ablaze, increasing the exhaustion rate. Long Chen had never tried it before, but being injured today brought him a newfound awareness.

As the dragon blood on the surface burned, Long Chen felt an invisible energy entering him, something he couldn’t quite grasp. It was a kind of exchange—through burning his essence blood, some kind of energy within heaven and earth flowed into him. It was an entirely novel sensation.

This energy was indescribable. Empowered by it, Long Chen felt like an unrivaled battle god, unafraid of any adversary.

Long Chen was in no rush to attack, nor was he afraid of his dragon blood being fully exhausted. At this moment, he was immersed in that mystical sensation, feeling as though everything within heaven and earth was under his command.

“What wild ignorance! Your blind arrogance only reveals your foolishness! Do you think barely surviving my attack means that you’re qualified to challenge me?! Keep dreaming!”

After Huo Qianwu recovered from her shock, her Blaze Dragon Bone Whip stood erect, and her thousand feathers fluctuated. Then, a dragon and phoenix cry echoed.

“Dragon Phoenix Space Piercer!” Huo Qianwu’s voice reverberated as feathers streamed over her whip. The power of these two divine weapons merged into one devastating attack. Seeing this, all the experts outside of the barrier felt suffocated.

Just as everyone was guessing how Long Chen would block it or just what kind of life-saving trump cards he would take out, Long Chen simply grabbed the Blaze Dragon Bone Whip with his hand.

“WHAT?!”

This time, even the vice hall master was stunned. Did Long Chen just grab the Blaze Dragon Bone Whip barehanded?

The bone whip quivered, attempting to bite Long Chen, but its neck was ensnared in his hand. His grasp resembled that of a dragon’s claw, unyielding and unbreakable. No matter the bone whip struggled, it couldn’t break free.

Long Chen had entered an entirely different state. Power surged within him, seemingly limitless. He even harbored the feeling that, should he choose, he could gather all his strength and crush the Blaze Dragon Bone Whip barehanded.

The effortless manner in which Long Chen held the Blaze Dragon Bone Whip left everyone stunned.

“My name is Long Chen, the possessor of the Dragon Sovereign’s blood. How dare a little blaze dragon act wild in front of me?” remarked Long Chen as he eyed the Blaze Dragon Bone Whip struggling in his hand.

When Long Chen pulled the whip, Huo Qianwu felt an irresistible power pass through it and pulled her toward Long Chen. Meanwhile, Long Chen raised Evilmoon with his free hand.

Huo Qianwu was pulled toward Long Chen’s saber. At this moment, the most logical reaction was for her to release the Blaze Dragon Bone Whip and stabilize herself before attacking again. However, she refused to let go. Having her weapon taken? That was an unacceptable humiliation to her.

“Heavenly Fate Rotation, Thousand Phoenix Revolution!” Huo Qianwu intoned, forming one-handed seals. The Heavenly Fate Disk spun as a thousand phoenix claws burst forth from her dress, hurtling toward Long Chen.

Huo Qianwu’s reaction speed was amazing. Even in a disadvantageous position, she reacted quickly. These greenhouse flowers simply couldn’t compare to her; she was a true expert. However...

“Nothing more than a flashy technique,” Long Chen snorted. Blood-colored lines appeared on Evilmoon, brimming with his purest dragon blood power.

BOOM!

Evilmoon descended upon Huo Qianwu, and those thousand claws exploded into oblivion. Multicolored light burst forth, engulfing the battlefield.

Evilmoon slashed Huo Qianwu’s shoulder, but Long Chen was surprised that his attack didn’t cleave her in two. Nevertheless, her shoulder buckled under the force, her bones broken.

Suddenly, Huo Qianwu spat out blood, which condensed into an arrow aimed at Long Chen’s head. Despite her injuries, she turned the blood she expelled into a deadly counterattack.

BOOM!

Long Chen blocked the blood arrow with Evilmoon’s hilt, causing blood mist to permeate the surroundings.

Unexpectedly, Huo Qianwu’s attack contained a berserk Doyen power that was enough to send Long Chen flying.

Experiencing this, Long Chen truly understood the Doyen power of a Heavenly Chosen. The power behind this quick attack of hers was not inferior to that of a Heaven Saint divine weapon.

Long Chen instinctively let go of the Blaze Dragon Bone Whip, and Huo Qianwu pulled it back. But just then, her pupils shrank. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

The pitch-black Evilmoon swung toward her neck.
