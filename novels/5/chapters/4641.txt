Chapter 4630 Testing His Power

Long Chen’s slap almost blew Yu Zihao’s head off.

“Long Chen!”

Even though Yu Zihao hadn’t reacted in time, his Brahma power had automatically parried the slap. Otherwise, the impact of that single slap would have killed him.

When he saw Long Chen appear out of that sphere of light, Yu Zihao’s head buzzed. A wave of realization surged through him.

“You dare to trick me!?” Yu Zihao roared furiously, each of his words dripping with bloody killing intent.

He, a disciple of Lord Brahma, had actually been conned. This was a humiliation he would never be able to wash away. As his fury erupted, a menacing aura surged, transforming the very color of heaven and earth.

“Trick you? Are you an idiot? When did I trick you? I was just playing around with a puzzle, and you suddenly showed up and took over for me. What does that have to do with me?” asked Long Chen disdainfully, his expression definitely asking for a beating.

“You dare to quibble?! You are going to die a painful death today!”

Yu Zihao was so enraged he wasn’t even thinking about getting back his medicinal ingredients anymore. All he wanted was to take Long Chen’s life.

BOOM!

Runes appeared around Yu Zihao, and a sacred chant echoed through the air. It was the seventh volume of the Nirvana Scripture.

As the chanting reverberated, an enormous divine statue materialized behind Yu Zihao, radiating brilliant divine light that illuminated the surroundings. The sheer presence of this divine statue caused the entire world to tremble in awe.

“Run!”

Seeing that divine statue, the surrounding experts were overwhelmed by a sense of impending doom, which compelled them to run as fast as possible.

“DIE!” Yu Zihao bellowed furiously, swiftly weaving hand seals to summon an enormous heavenly net. In the blink of an eye, the earth erupted, revealing another net that burst forth from the ground.

“Brahma Power, Heaven Earth Nets!”

These two nets covered an enormous area. Fortunately, those people had run immediately, or they would have been caught between them.

Yu Zihao had previously used this move to kill a muscular expert. However, the current situation differed vastly, as he now unleashed the technique with his manifestation activated, channeling his full power into the attack.

“This fellow’s definitely dead. There’s no way to counter this move,” said one of the spectators.

BOOM!

To their surprise, when those two nets slammed down, Long Chen was not cut into pieces.

Layers of divine light had appeared around Long Chen, protecting him with their chains of fire.

“What?!”

Seeing this scene, Yu Zihao was shocked and enraged. “You bastard, you stole the seventh volume of the Nirvana Scripture from here?! Just who are you?!”

Long Chen remained silent, swiftly forming hand seals of his own. The runic chains surrounding him surged forward, engaging in a fierce clash against the nets conjured by Yu Zihao. Despite their formidable appearance, the nets proved incapable of breaching Long Chen's defensive barrier.

“As expected, the Nirvana Scripture can only be countered by the Nirvana Scripture.”

Long Chen sighed inwardly, recalling his previous encounter with Yu Zihao. Back then, he had been forced into a humiliating retreat. Yu Zihao had appeared like the flame overlord of the world, rendering Long Chen’s Nirvana Scripture ineffective against him.

In the past, when Long Chen summoned the flame energy of the world, it felt as though he was calling out to them. On the other hand, Yu Zihao wielded authority over them and could command them as he wished.

Now, it was different because Long Chen had grasped the true essence of flames. In fact, even without using the Nirvana Scripture, the world’s flame energy still listened to his call.

Despite Yu Zihao summoning his divine statue of Lord Brahma, Long Chen found that he could still control the flame energy of the world to fight Yu Zihao.

“I refuse to believe a dabbler like you could possibly compete with a direct disciple of Lord Brahma!” Yu Zihao roared furiously, rapidly forming hand seals. The chanting in the air grew louder until it was like thunder.

The two nets crashed together, trying to crush Long Chen. However, even when Long Chen’s barrier creaked, his expression didn’t change.

“I see. So the Nirvana Scripture is a rich soil, and every person is a seed. Everyone can cultivate the Nirvana Scripture, but because every seed is different, the flowers and fruits they produce are different.”

Looking at Yu Zihao, Long Chen said, “Your scripture contains a fretful tone—sinister and fierce, as well as filled with resentment. The sound of your scripture is the sound of your heart. It seems that you aren’t particularly outstanding amongst Lord Brahma’s disciples!”

Long Chen, Yu Qingxuan, and Huo Linger had all cultivated the Nirvana Scripture. However, despite studying the same scripture, each of them manifested a unique style in its expression.

Long Chen’s style exuded a sense of dominance and ferociousness. Yu Qingxuan’s style, on the other hand, was gentle and holy, while Huo Linger’s emanated a burning intensity, devoid of any discernible emotion. Nnêw n0vel chapters are published on n0v/e/(lb)i(n.)co/m

Having sensed Yu Zihao’s Nirvana Scripture, Long Chen was sure that if ten thousand people cultivated the Nirvana Scripture, there would be ten thousand different results. This was a particularity of the Nirvana Scripture.

“Shut up! You don’t know anything!”

Long Chen struck Yu Zihao right where it hurt. In response, Yu Zihao forcefully brought his nets crashing together, abandoning any attempt to crush Long Chen. Instead, he focused on trapping Long Chen.

With an outstretched hand, Yu Zihao summoned a divine diagram, hurtling a sharp sword out of it and toward Long Chen.

BOOM!

The barrier surrounding Long Chen shattered into fragments as the sword cut sliced through the void where Long Chen stood.

Despite the formidable attack, Long Chen emerged unscathed. With his fist raised in front of him, flame runes encircled his hand, pulsating with fiery energy. He was still in his punching posture.

“The Brahma Divine Diagram is only on this level,” said Long Chen lightly.

Previously, Long Chen had refrained from blocking a blow from the Brahma Divine Diagram due to its overwhelming power. However, now that he could effortlessly neutralize its attack with a single punch, he felt incredibly refreshed.

“Frog at the bottom of a well! Yu Zihao shouted, swiftly forming more hand seals. Yet, before he could react, Long Chen materialized in front of him like a ghost, and his hand fell ruthlessly.

A star appeared on Long Chen’s palm. As it manifested, a foreboding sense of mortal peril gripped Yu Zihao’s heart, causing his hair to stand on end.
