Chapter 2788 Burning the Boats

Ming Cangyue noticed that Long Chen’s eyes were half-open. Black lines were flickering within his eyes.

Even as a god, those black lines terrified her. They possessed a destructive power that made her uneasy.

Furthermore, as the stars flowed around him, they seemed to be absorbing endless resentment, causing Long Chen to become a bit foreign. Evil.

“Those are the nine star heir’s Purgatory Eyes. It proves that he’s about to break through to the Sovereign realm.” The Pill Fairy’s voice suddenly rang out from the Brahma Divine Diagram.

Suddenly, waves of demigods came flooding out of the four spatial gates. At the same time, divine light appeared on top of Ye Ming, the Nine-Headed Lion, and the Alldevil Heavenwalker’s heads. Their auras once more changed.

The Brahma Divine Diagram was then broken. The gods’ full power was finally passing through the wall of ascension with the spatial gates fully open.

Now, they were only limited in that it was their Yuan Spirits who descended. Despite that, their power instantly soared, and the laws of the Martial Heaven Continent were shattered.

“You dare to interfere in Lord Brahma’s matters. You lower gods haven’t even awakened your god seals. Who gave you the courage to do such a thing?!” roared the Nine-Headed Lion as he attacked Ming Cangyue.

“I don’t know who Lord Brahma is, nor do I care. But if he dares to attack Long Chen, he has to get past me first,” said Ming Cangyue, slashing her sword.

“What ignorance! Anyone who shows disrespect to Lord Brahma will die a miserable death!” The Alldevil Heavenwalker also charged over.

“You traitor, I’ll settle things with you later!” Ye Ming came flying out of the Brahma Divine Diagram. He managed to force back the Pill Fairy and charge toward Long Chen.

However, just at that moment, he staggered, his expression changing. “What, what did she say?! A nine star heir?! Kill him!”

At first, they hadn’t realized what the Pill Fairy had said. But the title of a nine star heir terrified them. Ye Ming, the Nine-Headed Lion, and the Alldevil Heavenwalker suddenly charged toward Long Chen, their faces filled with terror. They even turned their backs on Ming Cangyue.

Leng Yueyan flew back and attacked Ye Ming, forcing him back. But his powerful divine energy forced her back as well.

The resulting shockwave from their clash shook the entire Martial Heaven Continent. As a result, Yun Tian’s barrier cracked even further.

“Cangyue, we can’t stay here. Stop them!” shouted Leng Yueyan.

As Nethergods, they didn’t belong to this world. They were unable to replenish their power here, so it caused them to weaken more and more.

At this moment, Leng Yueyan and Ming Cangyue crossed their bone swords, forming a giant cross. The divine marks on their foreheads lit up.

Upon seeing this, Ye Ming, the Nine-Headed Lion, and the Alldevil Heavenwalker’s expressions changed. They hastily shot back, but they were too late. That giant cross was sucking them in.

“Nethergod Cross Seal!”

Ming Cangyue and Leng Yueyan shouted in unison. The three of them were now trapped within the cross.

“Kill them!” shouted Ye Ming. He attacked this strange seal from within but was unable to get out. He then chose to attack Ming Cangyue and Leng Yueyan.

However, his attack passed through their bodies. The two of them seemed illusory, as if they didn’t exist.

“It’s useless. Their souls are linked to their divine throne. If the divine throne isn’t broken, their true bodies won’t die. Attack the seal. They can’t last much longer!” shouted the Alldevil Heavenwalker, seemingly knowing a bit about this technique.

“Kill that person! Do everything you can to kill him, even if you have to kill yourself!” howled the Nine-Headed Lion.

The demonic beast race instantly went crazy. They then charged recklessly, and when they were blocked by Little Snow, they directly self-detonated.

The others also seemed to have been put under a spell, and they charged forward, completely unafraid of death.

“Jianying, protect yourself. I’m going out.” The old man made his determination. Their enemies were unleashing an all-out assault, so they could only use their lives to hold them back.

“Remember our agreement. You must come back alive. Don’t break my heart, alright?” Qu Jianying caressed the old man’s face warmly.

“Alright. I promise you that I will come back alive.”

The old man nodded. With a final look at Qu Jianying, he charged forward with the Heaven Splitting Blade.

Suddenly, the Heaven Splitting Divine Tablet behind him exploded. In that instant, the old man’s aura surged, and a flame burned on top of his head.

Seeing that, the Heaven Splitting Divine Sect’s disciples were filled with pain. The divine tablet had ignited the accumulated karmic luck of the sect. In other words, after this battle, the Heaven Splitting Divine Sect would be no more.

“Kill!”

The Heaven Splitting Divine Sect’s disciples howled, their eyes red. The divine tablet had sacrificed itself to give all of them heaven-defying power. As long as that flame remained above the old man’s head, they would be supported by this heaven-defying power.

Bao Buping and Chang Hao then charged out, unleashing consecutive blows of the ninth form of Split the Heavens. Even demigods were unable to block them.

BOOM!

The majestic Xuantian Tower also exploded, transforming into runes that fell onto the Xuantian Dao Sect’s disciples.

The disciples wept. After today, there would be no more Xuantian Dao Sect. Zhao Ziyan, Hua Shiyu, Mu Qingxuan, and the other disciples felt empty inside.

“Warriors of the Xuantian Dao Sect, do not feel grief. Whether the Xuantian Dao Sect exists or not, we will always be disciples of the Xuantian Dao Sect. Today’s battle will determine the future of the Martial Heaven Continent’s countless lives. We have no choice. All we can do is fight!” Li Tianxuan was the first to charge out.

“Kill!”

The Xuantian Dao Sect’s disciples roared crazily and attacked the invaders with no fear. Instead, they attacked with hatred that was carved into their bones and engraved in their hearts.

With the Heaven Splitting Divine Sect and the Xuantian Dao Sect taking the lead, the Martial Heaven Continent’s various powers also began igniting their karmic luck to fight their final battle.

At this moment, the Dragonblood warriors were in a grand formation slaughtering the invaders. They became the final line of defense.

This was a bloody and cruel battle. Within the tempest of blood, one warrior after another perished.

At the core, countless people wept. As they were too weak, they could only watch as these experts protecting them fell one by one. That kind of pain could not be described with words.

Casualties even began to appear amongst the Dragonblood Legion. This battle was too bloody, too cruel. Seeing their brothers fall one by one, the Dragonblood warriors roared like beasts.

BOOM! RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

Suddenly, the void shuddered and the flames surrounding Qu Jianying were extinguished. The power of the Martial Heaven Virtue Tablet was exhausted.

“Master!”

Ye Lingshan suddenly seemed to go mad and frantically rushed over to Qu Jianying. It seemed that Qu Jianying had been consumed by the battle, only thinking about killing more enemies. Hence, she didn’t keep track of how much time remained. With the support of the Martial Heaven Continent gone, she was instantly surrounded by enemies.
