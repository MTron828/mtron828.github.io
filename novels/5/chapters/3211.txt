Chapter 3200 Tying Up Loose Ends

A large head was dug out of the wreckage that used to be the Bloodkill Hall. That was the head of Enpuda’s divine statue.

The divine statue had shattered during the tribulation, but the head was still intact.

“Boss, what’s the point of this? Is this valuable?” asked Bai Xiaole. Every single one of them was holding a chain and pulling the head.

“It’s not worth crap. This head is the source of Enpuda’s faith energy here. That idiot actually thought that I wouldn’t know. As long as this source remains, his karmic luck in the Heavenly Swell Domain is not completely severed. As long as he is given a few centuries, he’ll be able to activate it once more, allowing him to recruit more people and spread his belief here,” said Long Chen.

“Boss, are you saying that we can sever his roots by breaking this head? His hands will never be able to stretch into the Heavenly Swell Domain again?” asked Bai Xiaole excitedly.

“Not bad, you’re getting smarter. But you’re only half right. This source cannot be directly broken. Breaking the head just like this won’t work,” said Long Chen.

“Then what?” asked Bai Xiaole.

Long Chen didn’t reply directly. Instead, he ordered the Unfettered Alliance and the Luo Gate’s disciples to tie the head to their flying boat and set off.

They dug a hole near a city and buried Enpuda’s head there facing down. Only its neck was still at the surface.

The head was hollow, and they could see faith runes covering its insides. With the neck facing up, it became a giant receptacle.

Over the next two days, Long Chen invited some craftsmen to construct a single temple over it with small rooms. Every room had a hole leading to below.

After a while, Bai Xiaole and the others realized that he was constructing a lavatory for everyone.

After it was finished, Long Chen had people spread the word that no matter who it was, anyone who relieved themselves here would obtain a detox pill. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

At first, people didn’t quite understand. But following his call, quite a few of his worshippers came and consumed his detox pills. Before anyone could say anything, they immediately rushed into the stalls and things started flowing.

They were delighted to find that this detox pill’s effect was amazing. It effectively expelled the pill toxins that they had accumulated. That was extremely beneficial for their future cultivation. Such an effective detox pill wasn’t something that they could even buy with money. Hence, they immediately began calling their friends over as well.

Long Chen said that this was to celebrate the destruction of the Bloodkill Hall. Anyone who came, regardless of cultivation base and gender could obtain a detox pill. The only problem was that the quantity was limited, so it was first come, first served.

“Boss, if Enpuda learns of this, he’ll definitely die of rage. Filling his head with crap, is this referring to his brains?” laughed Qin Feng along with the others.

Enpuda had launched two attacks on the High Firmament Academy and killed many disciples. This enmity was truly deep. Seeing Long Chen treat his statue like this was delightful.

“That’s only one part of it. I told you that the source of his faith couldn’t be destroyed with brute power. However, corrosive toxins are capable of it. It won’t be long before it is fully gone. He wants to play schemes with me? I’ll play him to death. Of course, I will also spread the image of his head filled with crap. After all, doing good things without leaving behind my name isn’t my style,” said Long Chen.

All those books that he had read weren't for nothing. The ocean’s worth of knowledge gave him countless methods to deal with things. This time, he was settling things once and for all, severing Enpuda’s claw.

Now everyone understood. He hadn’t gone to such efforts just to vent. It was to end this matter.

“Li Cai should be able to rest in peace,” sighed Qin Feng. As soon as Li Cai was mentioned, the mood fell.

“Li Cai’s death means that his branch in his family’s power struggle will fall. They might even…”

The speaker was one of the disciples of the ‘Elite Group’. They knew what Li Cai’s death signified.

When they first followed Long Chen, they managed to charge into the inner academy, becoming true elite disciples with limitless prospects.

They were originally squeezed out of their families, but as they grew stronger and Long Chen rose, their families recognized their potential. Almost all of them had become the official heirs of their families.

Of course, they didn’t forget to settle things with those that had harmed them. This was life. This was the cultivation world. Whoever had the power would get revenge for when they didn’t have it.

However, now that Li Cai had died, his family branch’s position was no longer stable. When the positions were reversed, the old enemies would resurface. This constant revenge was bloody.

“No need to worry. Who doesn’t know that Li Cai is one of boss’s subordinates? Who dares to touch his family? That would be a slap in boss’s face. Who has those guts?” said Bai Xiaole.

However, Qin Feng and the others shook their heads. Bai Xiaole was thinking too simply. He didn’t know just how cruel the world was. Long Chen was too far away for them to be afraid of him. His name was not able to protect anyone.

It was the same even for the elite disciples that were still alive. They all had to be cautious against their competitors. They weren’t with their families right now, and they were too far to help. Many things could happen without them being aware of it.

“Li Cai has a little brother who just passed the exam two months ago and entered the academy, right?” asked Long Chen.

“Yes. It’s said that his aptitude is no lower than Li Cai’s. Li Cai greatly loved this little brother of his,” said Qin Feng.

Long Chen nodded. “Have him come see me when we get back. What was to be Li Cai’s will be his. Li Cai traded his life for that.”

Qin Feng shook inside. He knew what Long Chen was referring to. He was going to give the Heavenly Dao Fruit that was originally for Li Cai to his little brother, turning him into a Primal.

In his tribulation, he had killed countless experts, so he now had over six hundred Heavenly Dao Fruits. In other words, adding together the Four Peak realm and the Divine Lord realm, over six hundred Primals had been slain.

If news of the Heavenly Dao Fruits spread, it would definitely drive countless people crazy. Long Chen had to keep it secret.

Li Cai’s brother could be given one, but he definitely couldn’t be informed about what it was. After all, such a heaven-defying existence would cause Long Chen to be hunted down within the immortal world.

In just a month, Enpuda’s head was packed to the brim. Long Chen left behind a batch of detox pills for some people to guard while he returned with the others to the academy. However, as soon as he arrived at the entrance, he saw some disorder ahead.

“Where is Long Chen? Does he dare to come out and fight?!”

Within this disorder was a person roaring. His aura was shockingly powerful. He was actually a Primal.
