Chapter 4233: A Fishwife in the Streets

In front of Yan Wuji and his people’s towering killing intent, Long Chen indifferently responded, “He is my big brother.”

“Where is he now?” demanded Yan Wuji furiously. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

“Are you planning to send yourself to your death?” asked Long Chen disdainfully.

“Your Majesty, permit me to capture him! I refuse to believe that I can’t force him to open his mouth!” said one of Yan Wuji’s followers, a Triple Supreme with primal chaos qi swirling around his body. His three-colored divine radiance shook heaven and earth, exuding an astonishing pressure.

Sensing his might, many experts jumped in fright. This person was nothing more than one of Yan Wuji’s subordinates, but his aura was so terrifying. He was many times stronger than an ordinary Triple Supreme.

Long Chen calmly clasped his hands behind his back, remaining silent as he cast a cold, disdainful gaze at Yan Wuji and his lackeys. Internally, however, his fury burned intensely.

With the ten thousand races gathering in this place, countless powerful enemies of the human race could be found in every corner. But this person actually said that he wanted to unite the human race by eliminating all of their powerful experts? He was as stupid as a pig, as dumb as a donkey.

Long Chen feared no one, but he wasn’t so arrogant to think that he could fight all the world’s heavenly geniuses on his own.

This entire time, he had been holding back to conserve his energy. After all, he wanted to do his best to protect the Dragonblood Legion and the heroes of the human race. However, this descendant of the Human Emperor was intentionally picking a fight for no reason, enraging Long Chen.

Long Chen coldly looked at the other side. If they dared to attack him, he would show no mercy.

“Retreat. You aren’t a match for him,” said Yan Wuji, refusing to agree with that person’s request.

Upon hearing this, that person’s expression immediately sank. He refused to accept this, as he was also a descendant of the Human Emperor and a member of the direct bloodline. Before being sealed, he had swept through the battlefield, unmatched in prowess.

However, although he had the Human Emperor’s bloodline, he could not defy his master, Yan Wuji.

Despite retreating as ordered, he still glared at Long Chen hatefully. He refused to believe that he wasn’t a match for Long Chen.

Yan Wuji ignored his stubbornness and just looked at Long Chen. “Good, since you’re involved with the Grand Xia’s descendants, I don’t need to have any misgivings. And you call yourself Xia Guhong’s brother? Excellent. My Grand Yan is mortal enemies with the Grand Xia, so I’ll use your head as a declaration of war.”

Long Chen laughed furiously. “Then there’s no need to waste words. Anyone who dares to attack me will be viewed as my mortal enemy, and the only way to treat my mortal enemies is to slaughter them. From the mortal world to the immortal world, I have never said a single empty word. If you don’t believe me, come and try me.”

Long Chen’s voice grew colder and colder. If his words had previously served as a warning, now each one oozed with killing intent.

However, Long Chen still had something holding him back. He wasn’t concerned about his safety, rather, he was worried about these Dragonblood warriors.

Once a large battle erupted, there was no way he could look after these brothers of his. Many of them only had average strength and terrible equipment. Once a battle started, there would definitely be casualties.

However, given that Yan Wuji and his companions had pushed him to this extent, retreating would only place him in a more precarious position. There was simply no solution other than to fight.

This time, Long Chen had decided to slaughter his opponents with the greatest speed so that they would have no chance of attacking the Dragonblood warriors.

At the same time, Long Chen sent a message to Guo Ran and the others to get over here. He had originally been hoping to bring this group back to them, but now, it seemed that it was impossible. He could only hope for everyone else to join him here.

“Hmph, when my Grand Yan shone brightly, your ancestors didn’t even know how to pick fruit from trees! How dare you threaten me? You really are naive. No matter what, I’m going to try you today. What can you do?” Yan Wuji sneered, completely unmoved by Long Chen’s killing intent. He then began to walk over toward Long Chen.

Seeing this, Long Chen took a deep breath and reached back for the Minghong Saber. The next moment, his body bent ever so slightly like a hunting leopard, and his icy killing intent locked onto Yan Wuji.

Yan Wuji originally had a disdainful expression, but when Long Chen’s icy killing intent locked onto him, his expression changed slightly. It was his first time being locked down by killing intent.

“Brat Wuji, don’t get too arrogant! Try and receive this arrow!”

Abruptly, an arrogant, indolent voice rang out, and an arrow appeared right in front of Yan Wuji’s face.

This arrow was incredibly bizarre, leaving no fluctuations or traces in the air. As a result, people couldn’t even tell where it came from. By the time they sensed it, the arrow was merely three inches away from Yan Wuji’s face.

Upon hearing this voice, Yan Wuji was shocked and enraged. He then unleashed a punch to destroy the arrow in one blow. His reaction speed and punch were shockingly fast.

“Damn bastard, get out of here! I will tear you into a million pieces!” roared Yan Wuji, his face twisted as if he had just encountered the murderer of his father.

Everyone was startled by this. Not only had someone dared to launch a sneak attack on a descendant of the Human Emperor, but it became apparent that this assailant was Yan Wuji's sworn enemy.

“The limitless palace in front of the limitless mountain, the limitless trees before the limitless gate, the dreams of heavenly genius vanish without a trace as soon as they encounter Mo Nian.”

That lazy voice rang out again, its volume not particularly loud, yet it managed to permeate the ears of everyone present, even amidst the clamor of the ongoing battle throughout the entire martial stage.

“I knew that this fellow would come,” said Long Chen as he smiled with gratification.

Every time he appeared, he had to make it mysterious and eye-attracting. Other than Mo Nian, who else could it be? In truth, the moment Mo Nian spoke, Long Chen already knew it was him.

“Go fuck yourself, you fucking bastard! If you have guts, get the fuck out of here!”

Unexpectedly, the arrogant and aloof Yan Wuji was so enraged that he began to curse like a fishwife in the streets.

Everyone, including Long Chen, was dumbfounded by this. Just how much hatred did Yan Wuji have for Mo Nian to curse him like this regardless of his image?

“Child, now you are wrong. If I didn’t dig you out, how would you be able to come here? You are practically repaying kindness with enmity. The great descendant of a Human Emperor actually shows no gratitude, even cursing his benefactor. You’re damaging the dignity of the Human Emperors.” Mo Nian sighed and rebuked Yan Wuji.

Although his voice was echoing throughout the air, no one could lock down his position. Even Long Chen couldn’t sense him. This fellow was definitely using some kind of divine ability to conceal himself.

“Go fuck yourself!”

Yan Wuji roared furiously and suddenly shot in a certain direction.
