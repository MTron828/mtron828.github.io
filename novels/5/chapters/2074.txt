Beitang Rushuang caught Long Chen, a disbelieving expression on her face. “When I dominated my generation, I saw countless heroes and killed countless villains. But I never saw anyone as shameless as you. Tell me, just how did you get to be so shameless?”

Beitang Rushuang was a generation’s genius. Before being sealed, no one on the entire continent in her generation had been able to match her.

Her experience was even greater than what others could accumulate over several lifetimes. However, even someone like her had never encountered someone like Long Chen before.

Based on Long Chen’s tone, it was like she was the one pursuing him, while he was being a proper gentleman and not giving in. Just when had she expressed the slightest intention in this regard? How could someone be so shameless?

“Actually, I’m not really shameless. There’s a fellow called Mo Nian who’s even more shameless than me. Miss, I’ll tell you the truth. I’m simply too attractive to women. I don’t even know how many pretty girls have spilled blood to pursue me. But my home is already full, and I can’t have any more. Truly, I’m doing this for your own good. I can’t give you the happiness that you long for.” Long Chen sighed.

“How shameless. When did I ever say that I liked you? When it comes to looks, that Dongfang Yuyang is ten times more handsome than you,” said Beitang Rushuang. She looked Long Chen up and down pitifully.

“The main thing is that I’m different from him. My outer appearance is the weakest part of my charisma. Ah, we shouldn’t discuss it any longer. Miss, it would be best if you distanced yourself from me. Have you not heard of a certain phrase circulating in the continent?”

“What phrase?”

“Be careful of leaving your daughters near Long Chen,” sighed Long Chen. He looked up at the sky with a melancholy expression.

“Tch. When it comes to shamelessness, there has never been someone able to compare to you. Just what is so attractive about you? I don’t see anything!” Beitang Rushuang still couldn’t believe that Long Chen was so shameless. Was he really the top genius of his generation?

Even Nangong Zuiyue was shaking her head. Although she and Beitang Rushuang were from different generations, they had both been the most outstanding figures of their time. They had vast experience. However, Long Chen was something they had never encountered. Someone at the peak of their generation always had their own pride, but they didn’t see any of the qualities of a peerless genius from Long Chen. He seemed much more like a slippery scoundrel.

“Miss, listen to my advice. Take advantage of this time while you haven’t been seduced by my charisma to run. Otherwise, it will be too late for regret,” said Long Chen sadly.

“Tch, when it comes to looks, you aren’t at the level of shaking heaven and earth. In terms of cultivation base, the early Life Star realm is just average. Your reaction speed was also just so so. You weren’t even able to tell that my attack was a fake in time. If we had really been fighting, I would have a whole new level of respect for you if you could even last a hundred exchanges. Looks: average, cultivation base: average, battle power: average. Someone as ordinary as you, tell me just where does your confidence come from?” asked Beitang Rushuang.

“Actually, I’m not sure about my own charisma either. Look, just how amazing is a peerless genius like you? But for some reason, you’re holding on to me, not letting me go. Why is that?” said Long Chen.

“You’re vile.” Beitang Rushuang was disgusted. Long Chen had actually taken her actions to be romantic? She had an urge to beat him.

“Goodbye.” As soon as Beitang Rushuang released him, he said goodbye and slipped away for good.

That appearance of his was like he was worried Beitang Rushuang would continue her romantic pursuit for him.

Beitang Rushuang was ashen with rage. When she had dominated the continent, any man who saw her would become respectful, some even expressing their love. It was her first time encountering someone like Long Chen who actually seemed afraid that she would fall for him.

“He’s a scoundrel plus an idiot.” That was Beitang Rushuang’s appraisal.

“It wouldn’t be easy for anyone else to leave behind such a deep impression on you. But Long Chen has done it.” Nangong Zuiyue merely said one thing before also leaving.

“Nangong Zuiyue, stop trying to change the subject! When will you accept my challenge?!” shouted Beitang Rushuang.

“Sorry, I’m really not interested.” Nangong Zuiyue’s voice rang out in the distance. She had already vanished.

Long Chen had escaped and Nangong Zuiyue had left. The only one left in front of the Heavenly Music Stone was Beitang Rushuang. The Heavenly Music Stone was still rumbling, but it was unable to draw any of her attention.

“That Long Chen is definitely a scoundrel playing some kind of psychological game. He dares to tease me? Good, Long Chen, you’re quite brazen!” Beitang Rushuang snorted and turned to leave. However, just at this moment, she heard some strange footsteps.

Turning around, she saw a thin green-robed man, and her eyes narrowed. There was both a hint of fear and disdain in her eyes.

“The legendary fairy Rushuang of the Beitang family is even more beautiful than the legends say.” That thin man smiled at Beitang Rushuang. He was so thin that he appeared sickly, and his face was too pale. Even the Heavenly Dao fluctuations around him weren’t as strong as other people.

“Get rid of your perverted eyes, or I’ll carve them out of your head,” said Beitang Rushuang irritably.

“Don’t say that. As the top geniuses of our era, I feel like this kind of respect is simply required.”

“Dongfang Yuyang doesn’t know how to organize events properly. How did he allow any random person to attend? If people knew someone like you was coming, they would have probably decided not to come,” snorted Beitang Rushuang before leaving.

This person was Zhao Wuji of the infamous Mechanism Sect. The Mechanism Sect was a scourge of the cultivation world, and they had been surrounded and destroyed several times throughout history.

However, their mechanisms were truly terrifying. Even though their sect had been destroyed, they would always revive from the ashes, and every time, they would undertake a bloody reprisal. They were a sect that changed the face of the cultivation world. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

Despite that, the Mechanism Sect did not dare to offend the everlasting families. That was why Beitang Rushuang was a bit afraid of him while still not giving him the slightest face.

Zhao Wuji suddenly called out, “Fairy Rushuang, may I ask if you’ve seen a little fellow called Long Chen?”

Beitang Rushuang was startled. Looking back, she asked, “Are you looking for him?”

Although she was very dissatisfied with Long Chen, she was curious why Zhao Wuji would mention him.

“Ah, I didn’t expect you to know him. Could it be that you...?” Zhao Wuji probed.

Beitang Rushuang snorted. “Don’t play this kind of game with me. I don’t know him, so answer my question.”

“Oh, then that’s good. Just now I heard that Long Chen had come here, so I came to take a look and ask him just what kind of confidence he has to dare kill the disciples of my Mechanism Sect. He killed seven of them at once, with three being awakened Empyreans. I want to see just how tough his neck is,” said Zhao Wuji.

The Mechanism Sect might be used to running rampant, but they didn’t dare to go too far when it came to the everlasting families. If Long Chen really had a connection with the Beitang family, then he wouldn’t have said things so directly.

“Long Chen killed people from the Mechanism Sect? Haha, not bad, maybe he does have some attractive points,” laughed Beitang Rushuang.

The Mechanism Sect was like a tumor of the cultivation world, but it was impossible to get rid of it. Even the everlasting families didn’t want to provoke them, with other sects being even more afraid of them.

It was unexpected that as soon as the Mechanism Sect came back out into the world, seven of their disciples would immediately be killed. Three of them were even Empyreans with awakened manifestations. Long Chen’s guts were truly big.

Beitang Rushuang had personally experienced just how vile the Mechanism Sect was back in her time. However, due to her family’s status, she had been unable to attack the Mechanism Sect, while the Mechanism Sect did not dare to be rude to her. They had never given her an excuse to act against them. Killing a few of their experts had always been one of her dreams.

Unexpectedly, Long Chen had dared to kill their people. Hence, her opinion of Long Chen instantly rose.

Zhao Wuji’s expression changed slightly at Beitang Rushuang’s reaction. That kind of delight at their loss was irritating.

“Long Chen’s just a minor character from a declined era, but he dares to be so arrogant. Since he has no connection with your Beitang family, it’ll be easy to handle. I’ll make him regret being born in this world,” said Zhao Wuji coldly.

The Mechanism Sect never cared about the means. When it came to cruelty, they might even surpass the Corrupt path.

“That’s your matter. Don’t involve me.” Beitang Rushuang snorted. She had admitted that Long Chen had no connection with her Beitang family. Zhao Wuji was saying this so that she didn’t meddle in their affairs. “I wonder just who’s stronger, you or Long Chen?”

As she left, a hint of anticipation appeared in her eyes. It seemed that there would be a good show to watch.
