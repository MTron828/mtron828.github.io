Chapter 2809 Violently Beating a Teacher

Long Chen’s roar had finally drawn the attention of the higher-ups. However, it seemed that the higher-ups of the Pill Institute didn’t wish to reveal themselves. They only sent word.

However, their word was like an imperial edict. The teacher’s expression grew extremely ugly.

“Take your seat,” said the elder coldly. He could no longer stick to the topic of Long Chen being late to make things hard on him, so the elder could only continue the lesson.

As a result, Long Chen walked to his seat in front of everyone’s shocked gazes. There was only one seat available, so it was easy to find.

Amongst the disciples, there were quite a few who cast admiring gazes at Long Chen. He actually dared to curse a teacher while leaving the teacher helpless to retaliate. That courage wasn’t something that everyone had.

However, there were also those looking down on him, not having a good opinion of his actions. By offending a teacher, he would sooner or later face his retribution.

As for the majority of the disciples, they wisely chose to keep their eyes to the front, as if nothing had happened, afraid that any reaction or gaze on their part could draw the ire of the teacher.

“We can start the lesson now. Although you’ve passed the initial exam, it doesn’t mean that you’re qualified to study the Pill Dao within the Pill Institute. These classes will allow us to observe how well you learn, and if you can pass, you will be considered outer disciples of the Pill Institute. Thus, this period is extremely important to you. I don’t care what status or position you have in the outside world. Your fame doesn’t matter here. Here, you are just a student. As a student, you should have a humble, learning attitude,” said the elder. He clearly looked at Long Chen when he said this.

However, Long Chen didn’t even look at him. This High Firmament Academy had disappointed him at all turns. Hence, he was currently pondering whether or not he should leave this place and find somewhere to roam. Perhaps he could first find a way to search for his parents.

The elder’s lesson continued, with him lecturing on what it meant to be a student and the proper attitude.

It was only after that long lecture that he began to speak of the basics of alchemy. Long Chen almost laughed when he heard this. These basics really were basics. This elder even piled in a bunch about the composition and nature of Pill Flames and pill furnaces.

Someone who could pass the exam and come here had to already be an alchemist. It was like someone was telling adults that they had to eat with their mouths, breathe with their noses, don’t touch hot metal with their hands.

“Long Chen, what are you smiling about!?” shouted the elder.

Everyone turned to Long Chen and he was startled. Was his smile really so obvious?

“It’s nothing. I just suddenly thought of something funny,” said Long Chen, not bothering to lie.

“Do you think that I’m talking nonsense? Tell me, what does it mean to refine pills?!” questioned the elder.

“Refining pills is a spiritual process of extracting medicinal essence and merging it with the power of the Pill Flame, Spiritual Strength, and the Heavenly Daos,” answered Long Chen casually.

“Hahaha! You don’t even know the basics! You really are a frog at the bottom of a well. Who can tell him what it means to refine pills?”

A student stood and proudly said, “Disciple knows. The Dao of alchemy contains all manifestations. It is recorded that an alchemist merges heaven and earth, the ten thousand Daos, and the ten planar worlds. Precious medicines must be treated in accordance with five natures: cold, cool, neutral, warm, and hot. The transformations of the five elements, metal, wood, water, fire, earth…”

That person seemed to be reading from a book and spent almost an hour talking, his spittle flying. It went without saying that his ability to recite things that he had memorized was very good.

“Excellent. You can sit.” The elder nodded, looking at him favorably. After that, the disciple glanced at Long Chen mockingly. It seemed he had a natural disdain for Long Chen as an ascender.

The elder turned to Long Chen and smiled coldly. “I didn’t see your exam paper, so I don’t know how you got full points. But you don’t even have the basics memorized. It seems that even the seniors of the Pill Institute can be negligent.”

The elder was clearly saying that Long Chen had only gotten full marks on his exam due to carelessness on the part of the examiners. That was how he had muddled his way in.

“Let me ask you another question. How many techniques are there to change the Pill Flame?” asked the elder.

“There are countless kinds,” said Long Chen expressionlessly. He already knew this elder’s goal.

“Hmph, what a joke. Who can tell him how many kinds there are?” snorted the elder. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

“There are 3916 kinds. Someone who can control over a hundred kinds can become a teacher,” answered another disciple.

“Did you hear that? You don’t know anything, yet you still act so arrogant. Who gave you such courage?” sneered the elder.

“I don’t know about courage, but it should be my turn to ask you something. How many precious medicines exist in the whole world?” asked Long Chen.

“87,634,361,” answered the elder without any hesitation. “Using such a childish question against me, I really am worried about your intelligence. Do you think everyone is as ignorant as you?”

Quite a few people laughed. It seemed that Long Chen’s question truly was ignorant. All of them could easily answer this question.

“What is this in my hand?” Long Chen took out a precious medicine and tossed it to the elder.

The elder was confused and then sneered, “This is some trash from the lower plane. It cannot enter the records of the immortal world.”

“If you don’t know, then you don’t know. I said all precious medicines in the whole world, not just the immortal world. You couldn’t even understand the question but blurted out some nonsense. Are you sure you even have a brain?”

The disciples were caught off guard. That truly was the case. Long Chen had said the whole world. That naturally included the immortal world and the mortal world.

“I come from the lower plane. I am a frog at the bottom of a well. But what about you? How do you know that there aren’t greater worlds beyond the immortal world? You mocking me is a pot calling the kettle black. You use your limited learning to judge this limitless world. That is foolish in and of itself. A teacher guides the way into the Dao. How is a narrow-hearted petty little person like you fit to be a teacher?” Long Chen stood after finishing talking.

“What are you doing?” demanded the teacher furiously.

“The turbid qi in my body is too strong. My five inner organs are circulating, pushing my Blood Qi down. There is an outer force quickening this circulation. Impurities have gathered and are preparing to break out…,” said Long Chen, gesturing as he spoke.

“What are you trying to say?!” shouted the teacher.

“I’m trying to say that I’m going to take a crap.” Long Chen said, “I was trying to emulate your lofty way of talking forever about something. Maybe I didn’t do it very well. Sorry for that. Everyone, goodbye.”

Long Chen walked out. What kind of garbage place was this? He hadn’t learned anything but was almost ready to burst from anger. If this was the case, he would rather find somewhere else to go.

The teacher had never seen a student leave of their own accord like this. Hence, his whole body quivered with rage. When Long Chen passed him, he suddenly smashed his palm toward Long Chen.

BOOM!

As a result, the table in front of him appeared in Long Chen’s hand and smashed into his head. The immense force caused his head to break out of the three-inch-thick table.

Long Chen then kicked him in the abdomen, sending him smashing into the wall. His body was embedded in the wall with the table still hanging from his neck. He fell unconscious.

After that, Long Chen patted his hands and walked out under everyone’s stunned gazes.
