Chapter 3104 Did I Give You Too Much Face?

Long Chen’s kick was so powerful that he broke Chu Gan’s outer robes, revealing golden protective armor.

What was strange about this armor was that it didn’t cover his chest and back. Instead, it was protecting his crotch. From a distance, it looked like golden underwear, specialized in protecting the location for creating future generations.

It was both shocking and comedic. That underwear possessed shocking divine power. It was actually a treasure item.

Treasure items were extremely valuable and precious. But a Treasure item in this form was something people had never seen before.

The crowd was unaware that due to Chu Gan’s immense power, his body had almost no weak points. His only fatal weak point was there.

Thus, this pair of ‘underwear’ was a Treasure item specially made for him just in case people learned his weak point. This preparation was truly correct. If he hadn’t had it, Long Chen’s kick would have crippled his life rod.

Even though this preparation had managed to protect his life rod, those dazzling underpants caused the crowd to involuntarily laugh after a moment of shock.

Even Long Chen laughed. The world was truly large and filled with marvels. There was even such a Treasure item. However, he quickly judged where Chu Gan’s weakness lay.

Chu Gan was infuriated and hastily took out new robes, covering his ‘treasure’.

“Long Chen, I’ll make sure you die a miserable death today!”

Chu Gan formed hand seals, and divine runes appeared behind him. After that, sacred chanting filled the air.

The sound of this chanting seemed to come from a distant past. As the ground rumbled, chains appeared in the air, piercing through the illusory and becoming real.

Those chains pierced Chu Gan’s body, turning him into a hedgehog. He was stabbed by hundreds of chains.

Every single chain caused the runes on his body to grow brighter. His Blood Qi also grew explosively, and even his body grew. Those chains seemed to be connected to something providing him with endless energy.

As the ground beneath his feet crumbled, strange runes appeared in his eyes. Overwhelming Blood Qi then scoured against the heavens.

Everyone was shocked. Although his position in other people’s minds had dropped because of the fight, his power was truly stunning. Every move he activated was more frightening than the last.

“Peh, realizing that your own power isn’t enough, you rely on the outside world’s power. These chains condensed of faith energy will have an immense burden on your body unless a huge amount of faith energy is sacrificed, correct? This is a self-damaging skill. These chains might be able to provide you with endless power, but they also give you a fatal weakness.” Long Chen shook his head at Chu Gan.

“Bullshit! I’ll show you the destructive power that can be obtained when the Chu family's bloodline abilities are combined with the Divine Venerate’s!”

Chu Gan roared and the runes in his eyes expanded. He was like a blazing sun on the martial stage, his divine light so blinding that people had to turn away.

After that, he charged forward, leaving a giant hole in the ground where he stamped down on. He shot at Long Chen like a meteor.

At this moment, people were shocked to find that the space in front of Chu Gan was twisting. The void was being deformed because of his power.

“Just what level of power has he reached?!”

“His power is compressing the void. If struck by this power, even with a Treasure item protecting you, you would still be killed,” said one person with a quivering voice. In front of this absolute power, even a Treasure item would not be able to protect your life.

After all, their realms were too low to fully control Treasure items. They might be able to block a portion of this power, but the remaining power would invade their bodies. That was more than enough to smash them to pieces.

Astral winds unfurled around Chu Gan, resulting in a long ditch in the ground wherever he passed. He appeared completely unstoppable.

“Try to receive this punch!”

Chu Gan roared and unleashed another punch. Streaks of light then appeared on his fist, which resulted in space compressing and swelling at the same time.

“What terrifying power.” Even young master Changchuan was moved.

BOOM!

Divine light exploded on the martial stage. A giant hole was smashed into the ground.

However, shockingly, in the face of this punch, Long Chen only turned his body and easily dodged it just like that.

Chu Gan repeatedly punched at him, every blow causing the stage to explode and creating a storm of rubble, but… he was never able to touch Long Chen.

“This is…”

People grew dumbfounded. With the hands clasped behind his back, Long Chen was dodging the punches with slight movements. However, Chu Gan was unable to even touch his shadow.

“I understand! This is the weakness that senior apprentice-brother Long Chen mentioned!”

“What is it?!”

“Look at how much Chu Gan’s body has swelled. His power has grown, but his speed has dropped. This power isn’t his own, so he can’t control it perfectly. Furthermore, the immense power is causing space to compress. It’s like he’s moving through water. The greater his power, the greater the resistance. While it looks like Chu Gan has now taken the advantage, in truth, no matter how great his power is, it’s useless if he can’t even touch his opponent. Other than that, there’s no way he can maintain such a state for long. As soon as his aura starts to drop, senior apprentice-brother Long Chen will launch a killing blow.”

For this person to be able to see through the clues so quickly showed that his aptitude was very high. But for Long Chen to be able to tell this weakness even before Chu Gan had attacked, he was many times superior. So this person felt the utmost admiration for Long Chen’s vision.

“As expected of the champion of the Dao discussion convention. He can instantly see through his opponent’s weaknesses.” After that person’s explanation, others also felt even more admiration for Long Chen.

In the current state, Long Chen was essentially in an unbeatable position. Such powerful attacks couldn’t be maintained for long, and Chu Gan would definitely lose if this continued.

“Coward, did your father and mother only teach you how to dodge?!” roared Chu Gan after failing to even touch Long Chen’s sleeves after hundreds of attacks.

All of a sudden, Long Chen attacked. A hand covered in dragon scales slammed into Chu Gan’s face, sending him smashing into the ground.

“Did I give you too much face?” Long Chen’s icy voice resounded through the arena.

BOOM!

Chu Gan smashed into the martial stage, leaving a giant hole in it. This sudden turn had people jumping out of their seats and crying out in shock.
