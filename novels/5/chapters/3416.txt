Chapter 3405 Toppling Common Knowledge

“The green divine light covers up all the other colors. That means his bloodline power is his strongest aspect. Furthermore, based on the brightness, it is very pure. He has immense potential. He’s not bad,” said a surprised Lei Yuner.

Seeing that Long Chen didn’t understand, Lei Yuner gave him an explanation about the testing gate of the Sacred Pill Hall. It had seven colors: red, orange, yellow, green, azure, blue, and violet. They represented the flesh, muscle, bone, blood, qi, soul, and essence. The essence referred to one’s mental energy, or more precisely, their will.

When the testing gate was activated, the formation’s energy would enter a person’s body and give them an evaluation. Every single color would light up, but if one aspect was stronger than the others, the corresponding light would drown out the others, making it seem like only one light was shining.

“He’s quite handsome. Just watch, quite a few people will invite him,” said Lei Yuner.

“Handsome?”

Long Chen could only force out an awkward smile. This guy had triangular eyes and a brandy nose. Moreover, most of his yellow teeth could be seen sticking out of his mouth, and his long chin almost wrapped around his mouth. He looked more like a monkey than anything else to Long Chen. This was someone handsome? Was this the beauty standards of the demonic beast race?

“Hey, can I ask what looks handsome about me in your eyes?” asked Long Chen curiously.

“Hm… it’s not easy to say!” said Lei Yuner, glancing at Long Chen a bit awkwardly.

“Alright, then there’s no need to say anything,” said Long Chen speechlessly. Lei Yuner’s tactful response told him that in her eyes, Long Chen looked no different than that man did in his eyes.

“Hehe, I’m just teasing you. You’re quite good to look at too,” said Lei Yuner with a laugh when she saw his expression.

As Lei Yuner said this, quite a few people came to greet this man. Many of them were beauties of the demonic beast race that wore revealing clothes. They actually took the initiative in striking up a conversation with him. This person was quite proud, and he asked them about their backgrounds and how powerful their families were.

“Did he come to marry someone?” asked Long Chen.

Lei Yuner eyed that person. “Look at his expression. You can tell he came prepared. Let me tell you, many people who didn’t do too well outside this place but have some talent choose to come here in order to copulate with our demonic beast race. Well, he simply wishes to marry into our ranks. You humans don’t really care about the power of the flesh, but we demonic beasts put great importance into it. In terms of soul and mental energy, we are a far cry from your human race. If we have children with you, our children will have attributes that make up for those deficiencies. Our children will also be smarter and can sense the Heavenly Daos easier. But there are also bad points. Humans have weak bodies. If we’re going to choose to marry a human, they must have sufficiently powerful bloodline power. So, while our children might still lose one level in this regard, the growth in soul and mental energy will make up for it, giving them greater room to grow. As for this fellow, he probably did a similar test before running here. His main goal probably isn’t the Divine Lord Immortal Realm but to marry into some family.”

So that was the case. The world really was large and filled with marvels. This fellow also had the good luck to have found this place.

With that appearance of his, adding on a combat power that wasn’t outstanding, it would be difficult for him to find any partner. But here, he was surrounded by countless beauties. What kind of logic could you use to argue against it?

“What is that number at the top? 375? Could it be… his combat power can be calculated with a number?” Long Chen suddenly noticed a line of numbers on the testing gate. If that was true, it was truly amazing.

“No. It’s how many immortal king crystals he has to pay based on his talent and power to enter the Divine Lord Immortal Realm. His actual combat power is very ordinary. Most outsiders have to pay a hundred immortal king crystals, but due to his bloodline being rather pure, the price was raised,” explained Lei Yuner.

“Damn, that many?” Long Chen was startled. This person’s little bit of power was already worth so much. Then what about himself? He finally started to worry.

“Look at his clothes. He’s definitely very poor, so he probably needs to marry someone first before being able to pay the price. To use your human race’s words, it can be considered a bride price,” said Lei Yuner.

Long Chen almost coughed up blood. That was essentially selling himself off. Seeing that person bargaining with a group of people, Long Chen didn’t know whether to laugh or cry.

Others continued to take the test. As Lei Yuner predicted, some stronger humans came. Their price exceeded five hundred immortal king crystals, but those without powerful bloodlines or physical bodies were ignored by the demonic beasts.

However, those people didn’t mind. They paid the price, activated their status plate, and then left. Not everyone came to marry themselves off.

The price of five hundred immortal king crystals was truly astonishing. But all these experts were willing to pay such a price.

As more people took the test, Long Chen saw that those with strong bloodlines drew the attention of the demonic beasts. They always drew over many beauties.

Long Chen noticed something else. Only very few women came from outside the star-field. When he asked, he learned that the demonic beast race only married with male humans, because a human woman copulated with a demonic beast man, it was very rare for the children to inherit the bloodline of the demonic beast. Thus, the demonic beasts were all recruiting son-in-laws, not daughter-in-laws. Some races even harshly forbade relationships between human women and their race’s men. The more strict ones would directly execute those people.

As time passed, Long Chen got closer to the front. When there were just ten people in front of him, Ying Bokong and Lei Yuner grew a bit excited.F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

Ying Bokong was excited to know just how strong Long Chen was. He felt like Long Chen was like a vast sea. Just how strong was this new master of his?

As for Lei Yuner, she knew that Long Chen was hiding a lot of secrets. The things that she had seen did not represent all of them. But under the testing stone, Long Chen couldn’t hide them. She would show those old ghosts just how sharp her vision was.

It was quickly Long Chen’s turn. There was a pack of people in the surroundings now, and countless terrifying auras were hidden within the crowd.

Clearly, due to Lei Yuner, many people were starting to pay attention to Long Chen. They all wanted to know just how strong the person she favored was for her to be so stubborn.

“Hehe, don’t worry, my Lightning Falcon race has money. Go, win some face for me. That will be a slap in those old fellows’ faces.”

Lei Yuner giggled. It was Long Chen’s turn, and he stepped forward on his own. In front of countless gazes, he walked toward that large stone gate.
