Chapter 1611 Escaping the Netherworld

Translator: BornToBe

“Why would you say that? Am I such an unreasonable person? Look at how big this door is! There’s no way I can carry such a thing,” said Long Chen.

“Stop trying to fake it. After knowing you all this long, I’ve never once seen you be a reasonable person. Don’t be a fool,” warned Evilmoon.

Evilmoon had originally thought that its guts were pretty big. After all, it had dared to challenge a Sovereign, which had resulted in it paying a miserable price.

However, after knowing Long Chen, it felt itself to be a coward in comparison. Long Chen couldn’t be described as just having big guts. No, he was a madman.

“Don’t worry, I have a plan. Evilmoon, help me out. Don’t you think you should help me get some trump cards?” Long Chen smiled mischievously.

“What are you planning?”

“Do you see the nail on the lower left of the door? I want to take it.” Long Chen pointed to a nail on the huge door.

There were countless nails on this giant door. The door was pitch-black, but the nails emitted divine light. They were definitely something good.

“Are you crazy?! You want to take the nails of the Gates of Hell?!” roared Evilmoon. Was this something a sane person would think of?!

Riches naturally had to be taken from danger. Long Chen ignored Evilmoon’s roaring. He looked at the blood essence stones, blood soul stones, as well as the chains and blades from the Skinners that he had in his primal chaos space. He couldn’t help but sigh.

This time, his trip had been very profitable. In fact, Long Chen had an urge to go take a look at the second level of Purgatory to see what else he could get. Right now though, it was the nails that made him excited.

“You madman, the Gates of Hell definitely have their own restrictions on them! If you take a nail, it will definitely disturb some terrifying existence!” shouted Evilmoon.

“We’ll just try it. Worst case, we turn and run. Furthermore, I feel like these gates only allow people through but not out. Whatever’s inside should also be restricted and not able to come out. What do you think?”

“Well, that does seem logical but... this is way too dangerous. With my current power, there’s no way for me to fight against the existences here. If something unexpected happens, we won’t even have a place to cry,” said Evilmoon.

“It’s fine, let’s just try it! If we succeed, I’ll have gained another terrifying trump card.” Long Chen didn’t waste any more time trying to convince Evilmoon. He ran directly to the door.

All the lifeforms attacking the Netherpassage realm fell back. The sight of Long Chen killing that powerful lifeform before had shocked them. None of them dared to fight against him.

Once Long Chen was close enough, he jumped up and began to run along the door to get higher. He only reached the nail after half an incense stick’s worth of time. Only once he was there did he realize the doornail was even larger than what he had thought.

Just this single doornail had a diameter of thousands of meters. In front of this nail, Long Chen was like a dragonfly trying to shake a tree.

Evilmoon stabbed into a crack between the nail and the door. Long Chen slowly began to push. “Evilmoon, are you alright?”

“Don’t worry, although I haven’t recovered my power, my body is hard enough,” said Evilmoon.

Long Chen began to use his full power, forcing the nail out of the door. As he increased his power, the nail began to shudder.

The lifeforms stared lifelessly at Long Chen’s actions. When they saw that he wanted to take the door, they all turned green and began to shout.

“It really is possible!” Long Chen saw that the nail was starting to rise slowly.

However, as the nail slowly rose, the Gates of Hell began to shake. At the same time, divine might crashed down. The lifeforms all fled for their lives.

“Long Chen, I think... we should just let it go. I’m feeling dizzy!” shouted Evilmoon.

“We’ll finish it in one burst!”

Long Chen shouted, and he activated his divine ring and Five Star Battle Armor.

BOOM!

The world shook as the huge nail flew out of the Gates of Hell.

At that instant, a berserk aura came from within the Gates of Hell. Terrifying killing intent filled the world. The small crack of the two doors opened wider.

“Is a monster about to come out?” In that instant, Long Chen felt a chill as some kind of energy locked onto him.

Lightning flashed on his feet and lightning wings appeared on his back. He tossed the nail into the primal chaos space and fled.

A huge hand suddenly came out of the Gates of Hell and reached toward Long Chen.

“Hehe, bye!”

However, Long Chen was too fast. He reached the whirlpool in an instant and fled up the staircase near the black lake. The hand missed.

Just as Long Chen thought that the danger had passed, that hand snaked up from below and reached out for him again.

“It can curve like this?!” Long Chen let out a startled cry and slashed Evilmoon at it.

BOOM! Long Chen was sent flying up the waterfall. He coughed up a mouthful of blood, feeling like his body was about to break apart. He couldn’t help being shocked. That hand contained the laws of this world. His power was unable to block it.

Originally, going from the bottom to the top would have required a long time, but thanks to the attack, he flew out like a shooting star. Borrowing its power, he began to flee along the wooden logs.

However, the huge hand followed him, once more slamming toward him. It was too big to dodge. Long Chen let out a furious roar and attacked; however, his saber-image exploded, and he coughed up blood once more.

“How can this thing be so strong?!” raged Long Chen.

“How could it not be so strong? It’s condensed by the laws of this place. It won’t stop until it kills you,” said Evilmoon irritably.

Long Chen was repeatedly blown back by the hand. He repeatedly coughed up blood. However, its attacks also increased Long Chen’s speed. He quickly saw the bridge ahead of him.

“Just a bit more!” Hope appeared in Long Chen’s eyes. As long as he returned to the gate, he would be able to leave the Netherworld.

BOOM! Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

Long Chen blocked once more and was sent flying by the large hand. This time, he smashed into one of the monstrosities on the bridge. The two of them tumbled back.

The monstrosity’s eyes suddenly turned sharp, and runes revolved around it as it attacked Long Chen.

Long Chen immediately grabbed hold of its chain and gave it a vicious slap in the face, also wrestling the chains from it.

The chains transformed into divine runes that attacked him like millions of vipers. They actually weren’t true chains.

“Raging Flames Incinerate the Heavens!”

Golden flames exploded out of him, burning the runes around him into ashes.

As for the large hand, it returned, striking again. It seemed it really wouldn’t stop until he was dead.

Long Chen had no time to deal with it. He ran, barely dodging its attack. Its strike ended up breaking the bridge.

Long Chen fled as fast as he could. He quickly saw many gates open in the darkness. He had already determined which one was the old man’s, and just as he was about to run through, he came to a stop.

He was being followed by that large hand. What if when he fled, the hand destroyed the old man’s gate? Then the old man wouldn’t be able to return.

“Fuck, why didn’t I think of this problem?!”

Long Chen was vexed. He couldn’t go through the other gates, because once he did, he would enter that person’s body.

Who knew whether these gates would lead to the body of a human or a demon? What if they led to a completely different star-field? One mistake, and he would never be able to return to the Martial Heaven Continent.

The hand once more slammed toward him. Long Chen blocked it again, but this time, his bones almost shattered. He felt like he was reaching his limit.

“What do I do?!”

Long Chen’s heart raced. There was no other choice. He could only randomly pick a door. No matter what, he couldn’t implicate the old man.

Just as he was preparing to randomly pick a gate to go through, a fluctuation came from the surrounding space. A new gate opened, and an elder walked out.

When Long Chen saw that elder’s robes, he almost wept tears of joy. This old fellow really had come at the right time.

“Old fellow, I’m going to borrow your gate. Many thanks!”

That elder had just entered the Netherworld and didn’t even know what was going on when he was grabbed by Long Chen and thrown into the distance. At the same time, Long Chen charged into his gate.

“Long Chen!”

The elder was wearing robes of the Corrupt path. He only recognized Long Chen once he was tossed aside.

He had just recognized Long Chen when he was blown to pieces by the hand. The hand slammed into his gate, destroying it. However, Long Chen had vanished.
