Chapter 3391 Integral Heaven Star-Field

Long Chen looked back and saw a group of people rushing over here. There were men and women amongst them. The women hastily turned away when they saw him, while the men sneered at him.

Only then did Long Chen realize that he was naked. The black robes he had been wearing were gone. Those black robes were clothes that Leng Yueyan and Ming Cangyue had made for him, and they were made out of the laws of the Netherworld.

When he entered the immortal world, the laws of the Netherworld faded and his clothes naturally disappeared. But his mind had been in the primal chaos space, so he hadn’t noticed.

Long Chen hastily took out new clothes. At this moment, those people had gotten close. He was surprised that some of them had strange Blood Qis. They weren’t of the human race, or perhaps it should be said that they also had the aura of the beast race on them. In other words, they were mixed blood.

“Brat, what are you doing here buck naked? Tell me, what happened here just now?” asked a fair-faced young man in violet robes. He was very overbearing.

Just like Long Chen, he was at the peak of the Four Peak realm. He was a Primal. Based on his aura, he could be counted as an expert. However, that overbearing arrogance of his was so great that Long Chen didn’t feel that his power matched it.

These people seemed to be led by this arrogant man. They were all wearing similar robes, as if they came from the same sect

“You’re asking me?” Long Chen pointed at his own nose.

“Tch, is there anyone else here? If I wasn’t asking you, who would I be asking?” demanded that man impatiently.

“If you’re asking me, who am I supposed to ask?” Long Chen curled his lips at him and turned to leave.

“Brat, do you want to die?! Do you know who you’re talking to? Kneel and beg senior apprentice-brother Qi to spare your life!”

That group of people instantly surrounded him and one of them even barked at him. However, they didn’t take out their weapons. It seemed that they truly didn’t place him in their eyes.

Long Chen almost laughed from rage. These people were existences that he could wipe out with a single slap. Now, they wanted him to kneel?

“Aiya, it seems that you have a great background! My eyes were blind. It seems that I have to ask for guidance…” Long Chen looked at those people, acting shocked.

Before that senior apprentice-brother Qi could speak, an expert beside him already said, “Brat, listen well! This is our Falling Star Gate’s rank 1901, senior apprentice-brother Qi Heng! He has the noble bloodline of the Gold Scale Fire Drake! You are nothing more than a little human. What are you waiting for? Shouldn’t you hurry up and kowtow to repent for your sins?!”

Gold Scale Fire Drake? Noble bloodline? Long Chen eyed that senior apprentice-brother Qi and found that although he did have the fluctuations of beast blood, there were no flame fluctuations, nor did any part of him have the characteristics of the Gold Scale Fire Drake.

In other words, although he might have that bloodline, it had become so impure that he didn’t even have the slightest trace of flame energy in his body.

Senior apprentice-brother Qi stuck out his chest proudly when his bloodline was mentioned. It seemed that this bloodline was what he was proudest of.

“Admirable…” Long Chen nodded.

Senior apprentice-brother Qi’s expression improved after hearing that praise. But Long Chen then continued, “I really admire your courage. Being ranked in the nineteen hundreds yet still having the face to go out into the world. Tell me, how did you manage to cultivate such a thick skin that is impervious to blade or spear, immune to flame or water?”

“Die!” Senior apprentice-brother Qi roared furiously.

BOOM!

After that, senior apprentice-brother Qi was on the ground, twitching. He hadn’t even moved before Long Chen slapped him down. The others only saw a blur. Before they even understood anything at all, the strongest of them had collapsed on the ground.

His head was drooping oddly. His neck was clearly broken, and his body had completely deformed. He stared in horror at Long Chen. He had lost the ability to recover or even move.

“Who… who are you…?!”

The other experts cried out and retreated, taking out their weapons. One of them waved their hand, causing a magical symbol to appear. It seemed that he was requesting aid.

“Little fellow, our distress signal has been released! Other experts will quickly arrive. I’d advise you to- AH!”

The one who released the distress signal suddenly screamed. A fist-sized rock struck his chest and shattered. As a result, his chest caved in, and he tumbled back.

Long Chen disliked that person’s shouting, so he kicked a rock at him to make him shut his mouth. However, he didn’t kill him. If he had wanted to, that person would have simply exploded into blood mist.

The others stared in terror at Long Chen. Now they knew that they had provoked a terrifying expert.

“Don’t kill me! Otherwise, you’ll provoke a calamity! Just tell me what you want! As long as I have it, I’ll give it all to you!” shouted senior apprentice-brother Qi. Although he couldn’t move, his head was still capable of begging for his life.

“Don’t worry, I won’t kill you. I disdain killing trash. I’m going to do a soulsearch on you. It would be best if you cooperate, or that would be you killing yourself, and it would have nothing to do with me.” Long Chen pressed a finger on senior apprentice-brother Qi’s forehead.

“No, my soul has restrictions! All memories related to the Falling Star Gate are sealed! If you go through them, I’ll instantly die…!” cried senior apprentice-brother Qi.

“I’m not interested in your dogshit Falling Star Gate. Do your best to cooperate, or I’ll kill you.” Long Chen snorted and pressed his finger down. After that, senior apprentice-brother Qi stiffened. A flow of information then poured into Long Chen’s mind.Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“The Integral Heaven Star-Field? Ancient Orchid Domain, Auspicious Cloud Prefecture? Hmm, it is ruled by the demonic beast race. Also, the human race is the lowest power here? They survive here by sucking up to others and begging for their lives?”

Long Chen didn’t quite dare to believe it. The place that he was in was the immortal world, but it wasn’t his original star-field.

The Heavenly Swell Domain was just one domain of the Empyrean Heaven Star-Field. Back then, Wu Tian hadn’t bothered with what star-field Long Chen was originally from when he sent him back to the immortal world. Now, Long Chen didn’t know just how far he was from the Empyrean Heaven Star-Field.

The most shocking thing was that after going through this person’s memories, Long Chen learned that this star-field was ruled by the demonic beast race. The human race ended up marrying the demonic beast race, so the majority of the lifeforms in this star-field were of mixed blood.

The demonic beast race was the strongest, while the human race was the weakest. The humans here worked hard at cultivation in hopes of gaining the favor of the demonic beast race and being chosen as partners or followers.

Now Long Chen understood why senior apprentice-brother Qi would be so arrogant. He had a trace of the blood of a demonic beast.

Pure humans were nothing more than their attendants. They had to treat their masters well in order to survive.

“Lowly fellow, are you challenging my Falling Star Gate?!” Just as Long Chen finished up his soulsearch, countless powerful auras came charging over from every direction. They had surrounded this space.
