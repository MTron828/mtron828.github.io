Chapter 3763: Fifth Volume of the Nirvana Scripture

One rune after another was deeply imprinted into Long Chen’s mind. What shocked Long Chen was that these runes were ones that he was familiar with. They were from the first volume of the Nirvana Scripture.

Every rune gave off a different sound. But when they entered his mind this time, he found that some of them were giving off a different sound than before.

Previously, when he chanted the Nirvana Scripture, the scripture was gentle. It was holy and sacred, but not domineering.

Now that the sound of these runes had changed, they contained more of a feeling of ordering the heavens, a domineeringness to force the world to obey.

The first volume… the second volume… the third volume… the fourth volume… These were all scriptures that he had previously learned. After the fourth scripture, a new scripture that he had never encountered before entered his mind.

“The fifth volume of the Nirvana Scripture?”

Long Chen was delighted. He never had a chance to learn the fifth volume, and he hadn’t expected to encounter it here.

When those runes rang out in Long Chen’s mind, his body quivered in pain. It was like violent lava was exploding throughout his bones. It was like he was going to explode.

Long Chen was delighted by this. This fifth volume had changed the gentle scripture. It was now explosive.

The first four volumes were like a babbling creek, gentle and tranquil, nourishing all life. But the fifth volume was like a raging flood, an angry tsunami destroying the world.

Long Chen wasn’t even circulating the fifth volume of the Nirvana Scripture. Just listening to it already caused his body to feel uncomfortable. He couldn’t help being shocked. How was the fifth volume of the Nirvana Scripture so violent?

“It seems that there’s no way to use the fifth volume before advancing to the Immortal King realm. Otherwise, its power will directly kill me.”

Sensing the Nirvana Scripture, feeling the immense power within every syllable, Long Chen grew even more reverent of the Nirvana Scripture.

Finally, the scripture faded and Long Chen slowly opened his eyes. He looked at the beautiful woman before him.

This woman also looked at Long Chen. She smiled. “Remember your words. Protect the purity in your heart.”

After saying that, she kissed Long Chen on the forehead. Her body slowly faded away, and the figure in the sky vanished with her. A rain of divine light fell.

As the Spirit race’s experts piously kowtowed, the rain of light blessed them. They smiled quietly.

“The Spirit race really is a grand race. I’m a selfish person, but even I feel the urge to sacrifice my life to protect them.” Looking at the endless lifeforms of the Spirit race, feeling their holy and kind auras, Jiang Lei couldn’t help sighing.

“Every kind lifeform should be treated warmly. However, many times, kindness is not repaid. It isn’t fair. That Li Chenggang, he said something I like. Reading books is to comprehend reason, and cultivating is to talk reason with others. Against people who don’t talk reason, all your profound principles and explanations are useless. You will never be able to wake up people who are faking sleep,” said Long Chen.

“If we can’t wake them up, we’ll make sure that they will never get a chance to wake up,” said Jiang Lei.

Long Chen smiled. That was precisely what he was thinking. Previously, he wanted to protect the human race. But now, he understood. What he wanted to protect was not the human race; it was kindness. It had nothing to do with race.

The void quivered slightly. A white-haired lean elder then appeared before Long Chen and bowed slightly toward him.

“I was in the midst of worshiping my god and receiving my god’s blessing just now. I’m sorry for being late. Please forgive me.”

Long Chen hastily returned the bow. “Senior is too courteous. I am Long Chen. I urgently wish to go to the Heavenly River Blood Sea, and I am hoping to cross the Spirit race’s territory to travel there. Is it convenient for me to do so?”

“You are the most esteemed guest of our Spirit race. You’ve saved us from crisis several times, so giving you passage is a minor matter. I am not skilled enough to protect all the Spirit race’s lifeforms within the three thousand worlds despite leading them, causing these children to suffer. Fortunately, you are kind enough to save us. I received the god’s guidance just now to come and see you. If you need anything, just ask. My Spirit race might be weak, but all of our members are willing to go through hell for you,” said the elder sincerely.

“Senior, it’s not so serious. Right now, we just wish to reach the Heavenly River Blood Sea as quickly as possible. Hopefully, we can get through before the demonic beasts finish their blockade,” said Long Chen.

“The Heavenly River Blood Sea is filled with Blood Qi, and your Blood Qi is astonishing. Undergoing tribulation there is definitely the best choice for you.” The elder nodded.

“Senior, do you know the origin of the Heavenly River Blood Sea?” asked Long Chen.

“The Heavenly River Blood Sea was one of the main battlefields of the immemorial battle. Back then, one billion Beast Venerates surrounded three thousand nine star heirs. In the end, both sides were wiped out. After they died, their soul essence remained. Their fighting spirits did not extinguish, so they continue to fight even now. It is a land of death. A bloody river rages above a bloody sea. That is the result of the wills of the nine star heirs and the Beast Venerates still fighting even after so many years. As a result, experts with powerful physical bodies will undergo tribulation inside to absorb the energy of the blood sea. The stronger the person, the more of that energy that they can absorb and thus the greater the benefits. The Heavenly River Blood Sea surges whenever the three thousand worlds and the nine heavens and ten lands link up. That is when its power is at its peak and the best time to undergo tribulation inside. Calculating the time, it should be close to this moment,” said the elder.

“One billion Beast Venerates against nine star heirs?” Long Chen was shocked.

“Yes. It was one billion Divine Venerates of the beast race against three thousand Divine Venerate nine star heirs. They all died in the end, leaving the Heavenly River Blood Sea in their wake,” said the elder.

“Three thousand against one billion, ending with both sides dying? As expected of the strongest warriors of the nine heavens and ten lands,” praised Jiang Lei. However, he didn’t know that his boss was precisely a nine star heir.

“What level of battle armor did those nine star heirs activate?” Long Chen couldn’t help asking.

The elder shook his head apologetically. “I’m sorry. I only inherited a portion of memories from the previous generation. Furthermore, the last generation leader didn’t experience that battle. Thus, no one knows the exact details.”

“Senior, I want to go to the Heavenly River Blood Sea now. I’ll bid you farewell,” said Long Chen, in a rush to leave. He wanted to get to the bottom of the Heavenly River Blood Sea. He couldn’t wait any longer.

“Then let me send you on your way!”

The elder suddenly vanished. Long Chen and Jiang Lei found that the world in front of them was changing. Those Spirit race experts all vanished, and Long Chen and Jiang Lei appeared within an endless starry sky. An unending forest raced past them beneath their feet.Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

From this viewpoint, they were seeing practically the entire territory of the Spirit race. Long Chen was shocked. Unexpectedly, this elder was an absolutely enormous tree.

However, Long Chen very quickly rejected this theory. They weren’t standing on top of the leaves of a tree. They were standing atop the leaf of a golden vine.

At this moment, the golden vine lit up. Long Chen and Jiang Lei cried out, shooting out of the vine. The void twisted. When they saw where they were, they found that they had reached the edge of the Spirit race’s territory.
