Chapter 4048 The Nether Emperor’s Secret

That ancient voice was something that Long Chen had heard many times. But even to this day, he didn’t know who it was.

However, compared to the past, this voice was weaker, as if the speaker was lacking power now.

“Are you injured?” asked Long Chen suddenly.

“Injured? It can count as that. Communicating with you is very taxing. When you were still very weak, I had to use a great deal of time to transmit information to you. But as you grew stronger, I had to spend more energy to reach you through the monitoring of the Heavenly Daos. Long Chen, you’ve done very well. You broke a Star Peering Heavenly Mirror, causing millions of nine star heirs to escape their watch. More of them will survive now,” praised the ancient voice.

“I broke one Star Peering Heavenly Mirror? Are you saying that there’s more than one?” asked Long Chen.

“Yes. There were nine Star Peering Heavenly Mirrors, and you broke one,” said the ancient voice.

“Then where are the other eight?” asked Long Chen.

“The other eight are in the hands of Lord Brahma’s Eight Great Divine Commanders.”

“Eight Great Divine Commanders?”

Long Chen’s heart shook. Ye Wusheng had mentioned the Eight Great Divine Commanders. Apparently, not even someone as powerful as Enpuda was qualified to become one of them. In other words, all eight of them were stronger than Enpuda.

“In any case, your future path will be harder to traverse and longer. You are a nine star heir. I hope-”

Suddenly, the dragon expert’s voice rang out. “There’s no need for you to hope. Long Chen has his own path to walk, and he doesn’t need the status of the nine star heir to bind him. All things in this world have their own path, so Long Chen has the right to choose his own cultivation style. There’s no need for you to worry about it.”

The dragon expert’s voice was icy and definitely not courteous. Hearing this, the ancient voice was silent for a long time before replying.

“That is correct as well. Every person has the right to choose their own path. All I can ask is that you listen to your own heart.” This ancient voice was not angered by the dragon expert’s rude tone; rather, it seemed to approve of it.

Long Chen was shaken. The dragon expert and this mysterious elder were actually speaking within this dark world. Just what kind of existences were they?

Long Chen could tell that the mysterious elder wanted to remind him that as a nine star heir, the Nine Star Hegemon Body Art had to be his focus.

However, during this time, Long Chen had been focusing on the Dragon Soul Body Forging Art. As a result, the Nine Star Hegemon Body Art had not progressed at all, and his realm had not increased either, making it seem as if he had abandoned the Nine Star Hegemon Body Art. So, the elder wanted to warn him.

However, that drew the dragon expert’s displeasure. The Dragon Soul Body Forging Art was the technique that it was proudest of. For Long Chen to inherit it was its greatest desire.

Fortunately, the two of them did not start fighting. The dragon expert simply said, “You should focus on your own affairs. Take care of the other nine star heirs. Long Chen has me here, so there’s no need for you to worry.”

“Then many thanks.”

The elder’s presence faded away.

“Senior, who is that person?” asked Long Chen.

“He is the guide of the nine star heirs. He is in charge of awakening you and guiding you down the path of the nine stars as quickly as possible. However, you are different from other nine star heirs. From the fifth star, you already deviated from the cultivation path, so your future path will need to be created by yourself. Listening to him won’t benefit you. Furthermore, he’s in trouble right now. Communicating with you will likely expose your position and put you in grave peril,” said the dragon expert.

“Senior, who is the Nether Emperor?” asked Long Chen.Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

The dragon expert was silent, seemingly hesitating. It finally said, “The Nether Emperor already died and is still in nirvana. Just like Ghost Sovereign, he was slain by someone.”

“Could it be…?”

“Yes, he was slain by the Nine Star Master. Just like the Ghost Sovereign, he possesses an undying body. Thus, even though his physical body was destroyed and his Yuan Spirit extinguished, he can still be revived. As for the woman of the Nether Emperor, it is like being his daughter. Just like your Ghost Sovereign seal, it is a seed. These seeds will be reaped once they grow to a certain extent. As that girl possesses the Jiuli bloodline, it was sensed by the Heavenly Daos when she was born. So, the seed of the hell flower was planted in her.

“Originally, the hell flower should have only bloomed when she became a World King. However, someone interfered, using a sacrificial ceremony to open the hell gate. The aura of hell then triggered the hell flower, causing the envoy to come. I originally thought that you would need me to interfere this time, but you dealt with it yourself. You used your Purgatory Eyes to seal the hell flower and even learned a new divine technique from it. When the hell gate collapsed, I was going to seal it. But then I hesitated. Sometimes, helping you is actually harming you. Thus, when you used the cauldron, I didn’t stop you. Your future path is already in so much chaos that even I cannot see through it. That is why your path should be walked by you alone.”

When Long Chen was about to die, the dragon expert naturally wouldn’t just watch. However, when Long Chen used a pupil art to seal the hell flower, the dragon expert felt that not helping Long Chen was a better decision.

“Senior, just what is this cauldron?”

“There’s no need for me to tell you. The news will quickly reach you, so you will know soon.”

After that, the dragon expert no longer spoke. Long Chen sank into darkness. When he finally opened his eyes again, the first thing that entered his gaze was a pair of eyes red from crying.

“Long Chen!”

Yu Qingxuan immediately hugged Long Chen, her tears spilling out.

“No wonder people say women are made of water. You’ve cried so much that you got thinner. Stop crying. Aren’t I fine? If you cry, you’ll make me feel bad. I told you, I wouldn’t let you be hurt. If you’re hurt, I’ll feel powerless.” Long Chen rubbed Yu Qingxuan’s face guiltily, truly feeling powerless. Yu Qingxuan had suffered a great deal this time.

“I’m not crying. I’m smiling. You are so incredible that you even drove off the Nether Emperor. No one would dare to say that you are powerless.” Yu Qingxuan wiped away her tears and smiled. But she still couldn’t stop more tears from spilling out.

Long Chen tightly hugged her and whispered into her ear, “Qingxuan, trust me. I won’t let anyone hurt you.”

Yu Qingxuan finally stopped crying and immersed herself in his embrace, smelling his scent and feeling his warm embrace. There was no place that made her feel safer.

“Cough…”

Just then, a sound caused Yu Qingxuan to hastily flee from Long Chen’s embrace.

Long Chen then saw Yu Xiaoyun, Jiang Huixin, and Xu Lanxin walk in. That scene just now was witnessed by them, leaving everyone with awkward expressions.
