Chapter 3987 Treacherous Little Person

When the ancient martial stage appeared at the center of the hall, countless runes lit up throughout the room, causing the entire hall to become as bright as day.

However, this stage was just a projection that gave people a feeling of being right on stage.

At this moment, two rays of light entered the stage; they were Weng Tianyao and Zhu Yifeng. But before their figures even landed on the stage, divine light already erupted out of them. Zhu Yifeng roared and flames burst out of him. As the mark of the Vermilion Bird appeared on his saber, he slashed it at Weng Tianyao.

BOOM!

Lightning exploded. Within the flames, Zhu Yifeng coughed up blood as he was defeated in one move.

When the lightning faded, people saw that Weng Tianyao hadn’t even taken out a weapon. With his bare hands, he blocked Zhu Yifeng’s divine weapon, shocking everyone, including Long Chen.

“His thunderforce has improved again. It’s dozens of times stronger than it was in the three thousand worlds, so his power is now comparable to Long Aotian and Kun Tu.”

No wonder Weng Tianyao had still come here despite knowing that Long Chen would be here. He had decided to make up for his previous defeat.

“This is a prince of the Vermilion Bird Empire? The great Jiuli bloodline? Are you sure that your father is the emperor?” Weng Tianyao looked at Zhu Yifeng disdainfully.

Hearing this, Zhu Yifeng was enraged. This was a provocation toward the entire imperial family and was the greatest insult to his mother.

“Die!”

The flames around Zhu Yifeng suddenly exploded in power, forming a giant image of the Vermilion Bird. That was the specific mark of the imperial family.

As soon as this illusory figure appeared, an ancient aura burst into existence and Zhu Yifeng’s entire body was enveloped by divine flames. He appeared like a battle god of fire.

After channeling all of his power into one attack, Zhu Yifeng’s saber hacked down with explosive might.

BOOM!

When this saber fell, the entire martial stage was cut in two, proof that his power was truly astonishing.

However, what made Long Chen speechless was that Zhu Yifeng was unable to lock down his opponent. As a result, Weng Tianyao simply dodged. To Long Chen, such an attack was essentially meaningless.Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

Weng Tianyao’s smile widened. He easily dodged just by stepping aside, and then his hand reached out like lightning toward Zhu Yifeng’s neck.

On the other hand, Zhu Yifeng was shocked to see his attack miss. He then tried to parry the attack with his saber, but it was already too late. He could only step back. However, when he did, his hand turned numb and his saber landed in Weng Tianyao’s hand. Apparently, Weng Tianyao’s sudden attack had been a feint, and his true goal was to take the saber.

“This is the prince of the Vermilion Bird Empire? Hmph, you can’t even last a single move against me.” Weng Tianyao pointed Zhu Yifeng’s saber at him but looked at Long Chen. “Return my Wild Blade and lightning tower, and I’ll spare his life.”

However, before Long Chen could reply, Zhu Yifeng roared. With a flame blade in his hand, he attacked Weng Tianyao.

“The Vermilion Bird Empire’s warriors are heroes who dare to fight to the death! There are no cowards afraid of dying among us!”

Zhu Yifeng somehow lacked any of his normal cowardice and small guts. Despite clearly knowing that he wasn’t a match for Weng Tianyao, he still fought to the last breath.

“Since you want to die so badly, you can’t blame me.” Weng Tianyao smiled sinisterly. He was just like a hungry wolf staring at a sheep throwing itself at him.

“Weng Tianyao-” Long Chen shot toward the martial stage, knowing that he was going to kill Zhu Yifeng.

However, as soon as he got close to the martial stage, a screen of light appeared in front of Long Chen. He then felt space twist around him, and he returned to his original seat.

Just then, startled cries rang out. Zhu Yifeng’s saber pierced through his body, and blood flowed down his chest, soaking his robes red.

Weng Tianyao just smiled sinisterly and poured his thunderforce throughout Zhu Yifeng’s body, destroying his meridians. Even if Zhu Yifeng didn’t die, he would be crippled.

“Weng Tianyao!”

Seeing this scene, Long Chen was shaking with rage. Weng Tianyao didn’t dare to fight him, so he attacked someone else. This was intolerable. As for the other princes and princesses, they were also infuriated. Weng Tianyao was too sinister. Whether it was his mouth or his methods, they were all infuriating.

“Prince Yifeng was truly powerful. I greatly admire his boldness. However, swords and blades have no eyes. You can’t blame me.”

At this moment, Weng Tianyao put on an act as if he hadn’t just done this on purpose. But that sinister smile on his face had long since said everything that needed to be said.

When Weng Tianyao let go, Zhu Yifeng collapsed on the ground, his body paralyzed.

Buzz.

Suddenly, the martial stage quivered, transporting Zhu Yifeng and Weng Tianyao out. But to everyone’s surprise, when Zhu Yifeng came out, the saber was already out of his body, and he didn’t seem injured or weakened at all. It was as if he was fine.

“What?”

Even Weng Tianyao was stunned. Although that attack had seemed to be just a simple stab of the saber, all his energy had been transmitted into Zhu Yifeng’s body secretly. In other words, he had planned on leaving Zhu Yifeng with an intact corpse.

After a moment of shock, Long Chen suddenly turned toward where the concubines were. As expected, he saw that Zhu Yifeng’s mother was pale, and blood slowly leaked out of her mouth.

“Mom!”

At this moment, Zhu Yifeng didn’t care about the palace’s etiquette and directly ran over to his mother. Seeing her state, he instantly understood that she had used some kind of substitution art to help him block that killing blow.

Zhu Yifeng was shocked and enraged, as well as aggrieved and ashamed. He hated himself for being powerless and even implicated his mother.

“My son, don’t cry… you did very well today. You were like a real man, and mom is very proud.” His mother’s face was as pale as paper. His aura was unstable, but she was still smiling proudly.

“Quickly bring my concubine to heal!” shouted Yu Xiaoyun, his expression dark. Moreover, killing intent roiled in his eyes as if it might explode at any moment.

Zhu Yifeng’s mother was quickly brought away. Looking at her condition, it seemed to be a serious wound, which left many people feeling worried.

The princes and princesses glared at Weng Tianyao, but he just shrugged innocently. “If your skills are inferior, you shouldn’t blame others. This is a world where the strong are respected. Whoever’s fist is stronger is who is right. If you are weak, don’t blame others for being strong. If a mantis tries to block a chariot, if an ant tries to shake a tree, it will pay the price.”

Weng Tianyao’s arrogant and fearless appearance was exceptionally enraging. This was clearly using the power of all eight empires to provoke them.

BANG!

Suddenly, Long Chen gripped the Minghong Saber on his back. He coldly said, “So you mean to say that you think you are very powerful? Then let’s play! If you can block three moves from me, I, Long Chen, will kill myself right here in this hall!”

When Long Chen said this, every expert present jumped in shock, staring at Long Chen in disbelief.
