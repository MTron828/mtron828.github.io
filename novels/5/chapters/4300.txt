Chapter 4289: Crazy Idea

Long Chen was completely shocked by this statement. When he had summoned the Seven Star Battle Armor, it could be said that he could have obliterated everyone on the Sage King martial stage.

If he hadn’t had misgivings about dealing with half-step Eternals, he could have crushed the entire martial stage himself.

Long Chen always trusted the dragon expert, but he was a bit unwilling to accept such an assessment.

“I know that you don’t like it and don’t want to believe it. But this is reality. Do you still remember what your grandfather said? Although you are talented and hardworking, you are still lacking compared to experts from ancient times. It’s not that you are not outstanding enough but that you missed that era,” said the dragon expert.

“Is it because of primal chaos qi?” asked Long Chen.

“Yes. Dense primal chaos qi and the complete laws of the Heavenly Daos are necessary to fully awaken a person’s Spirit Root. In truth, whether it is in the mortal world or the immortal world, Spirit Roots are nothing more than a reference for potential. Their true use is completely different, as even Triple Supremes have not fully awakened their Spirit Root. The Spirit Root can be considered the foundation of one’s spiritual body, the root of intellect, the point from which all lifeforms gain sentience. For a towering tree to grow a hundred miles tall, it must spread roots ten thousand miles deep. But your human race, the beast race, and other races are now like rootless duckweeds. You all might look lush on the surface, but you guys didn’t have roots in the ten thousand Daos. Without primal chaos qi, the Spirit Root has no soil to thrive in. As a result, even the sealed experts from the ancient era do not have awakened Spirit Roots, let alone you. Those lifeforms behind the gate, however, are different. For them, primal chaos qi is as common as your spiritual qi. No matter how powerful your spiritual qi is, can it compare to primal chaos qi?”

“Of course there is no comparison,” said Long Chen with a bitter smile.

Spiritual qi could be gathered with spirit gathering formations or extracted from spirit stones. But primal chaos qi was far too rare in their world. As a result, even the major factions of the world cherished whatever little they had.

“That’s why I said that you missed that era. However, now you and the other experts have a chance to make up for this difference,” said the dragon expert.

“How do we make up for it?” asked Long Chen hastily.

“It is to use this new primal chaos qi and the World King tribulations to awaken the Spirit Roots. Once the Spirit Root is awakened, it will plant itself in the ten thousand Daos, causing the primal chaos qi and the laws of the world to instantly grow closer to you. With this, the difference between you and those lifeforms will shrink. This is currently the only option. If you all do not awaken your Spirit Roots, all your manifestations will not receive the recognition of primal chaos qi and the laws of the world. If that gate opens in that condition, not even your Dragonblood warriors would be a match for ordinary experts from that world. It would be like one person wielding a cabbage against someone with a blade. Your disadvantage is clear.”

“It’s that exaggerated?”

“That comparison was not at all exaggerated. Once you see those experts, you will understand.”

“Then what should we do now?”

“You need me to tell you? Have you forgotten that you are an alchemist?”

“Oh.”

Long Chen instantly blushed as he had actually forgotten. He had plenty of pill formulas that could upgrade a person’s Spirit Root. However, since he had no Spirit Root, he had never thought about them.

“However, you don’t need to upgrade your Spirit Root. I’m going to propose a rather audacious idea, and it’s up to you whether you want to follow it or not.”

“Senior, please give me your guidance,” said Long Chen with anticipation.

“Your Spirit Blood, Spirit Root, and Spirit Bone have returned, and primal chaos qi is filling this world. My idea is for you to return to the start and refine your body once more,” said the dragon expert.

Long Chen did not comprehend. “What kind of refinement?”

“In the mortal world, you underwent Qi Condensation, Blood Condensation, Tendon Transformation, Bone Forging, and Meridian Opening. I have made calculations. You can use your Supreme Blood as new blood, your dragon blood as dragon tendons, your Supreme Bone as a transcending bone, and condense new meridians with your violet blood. Because you have no Dantian, your Spirit Root is simply floating within the sea of stars that you replaced it with. We can try to let your Spirit Root take root in one hundred and eight thousand of them. This is an absolutely crazy idea. If you can pull it off, you will be able to possess all the divine abilities of the Violet Blood race, the dragon race, the nine star line, and the human race. Furthermore, you will be able to cycle through all these forces. Even if you are drawn into a long battle, you can just use one of these forces while the others recover, giving you even greater endurance. And against top experts, you can even merge these powers together. You will be an absolutely terrifying monster, and your combat power will be inestimable.”

The dragon expert’s voice quivered toward the end from excitement, as even it was unable to calculate just how terrifying Long Chen would be if he followed this path.

“Senior, you know that I can’t resist such a thing!” Long Chen clenched his fists.

After all, Long Chen was a person who could not walk away once he saw a treasure. Now that the dragon expert had proposed a plan that could increase his power by such a terrifying amount, he was instantly enticed.

However, Long Chen knew that this was just an idea, and to turn it into reality was something that would require taking many risks. One mistake and his life would be forfeited.

It had to be known that cultivating the Dragon Soul Body Forging Art had almost taken his life, and this time, it would be even more dangerous.

“Before this, I definitely wouldn’t propose such an idea. However, you now have the Sage King karmic luck, so I feel like this idea can be tried,” said the dragon expert.

The Sage King karmic luck was not something that could be controlled. Even though Lord Brahma had such immense abilities that he could change the timing and operation of the Sage King martial stage, he was unable to control the Sage King karmic luck.

With this Sage King karmic luck, Long Chen had become a part of the nine heavens and ten lands. He was no longer an unlucky bastard followed by misfortune. In fact, he would be bestowed with good fortune. Thus, the dragon expert dared to tell Long Chen about this idea.

The dragon expert naturally knew that if Long Chen knew of such a possibility, he would definitely be enticed and want to try it no matter what.

“Alright, I’ll listen to senior. Let’s risk it all. The greater a person’s guts, the greater they can profit! Guts are profit!” Long Chen made his decision.

“However, senior, I still have to take a trip to the Long clan first. It is time for some debts to be settled,” said Long Chen suddenly.

“You can go. But you must bring someone,” said the dragon expert.

“Bring someone?”

“That little barbarian dragon.”

“The palace master? Why?”

“Don’t ask so many questions. I’m telling you to bring him, so bring him,” said the dragon expert impatiently. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

Long Chen sighed helplessly. He looked at the giant gate once more before turning and vanishing into the void.
