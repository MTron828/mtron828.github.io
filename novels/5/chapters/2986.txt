Chapter 2975 A Woman Chosen by the Heavens

This group of people consisted of all women, but the majority of them had specks of blood on their white robes. One portion was cleaning up the battlefield, while the other portion was resting.

This group was precisely the group of disciples from the inner academy’s strongest guild, the Heaven Female Alliance. They had just finished up a battle and were recuperating.

Hence, the appearance of the giant crocodile startled them. Its terrifying aura shook their souls. But the most shocking thing of all was the black-robed man sitting on its head. His fire chains wrapped around the crocodile’s head, being used as reins. They even heard him urging it on like it was a mount, so they couldn’t believe their eyes.

“Who is that? He clearly just ignited his divine flame, but he dares to come here and provoke that Explosive Fire Devil Crocodile?!”

“Hey, don’t just stare like idiots! Run! I haven’t subdued this thing, so it’s not listening to me!” shouted Long Chen when he saw the crocodile charge toward them.

“Who are you?”

Suddenly, a woman spoke up from amongst the crowd. Her voice wasn’t loud, and yet even among the crocodile’s thunderous steps, it was clearly transmitted into Long Chen’s ear.

It was a pretty and melodious voice, but it vexed Long Chen. “Who cares who I am? Get out of the way or this fellow’s going to start killing people!”

The giant crocodile was still charging forward, and these women were just foolishly standing there. They actually were in a mood to ask him his name? Long Chen wanted to curse them.

“Brat, you dare to be rude to our leader?!” Those disciples were instantly angered.

“Fuck, are you idiots? If you don’t start running now, don’t blame me when you get killed!” raged Long Chen at this unreasonable group.

Just at that moment, as the crocodile reached them, a person walked out of the group.

She was a tall and elegant figure wearing golden imperial robes. With her hair tied up in a bun, she was peerlessly beautiful. At this distance, Long Chen finally got a clear look at her. Not only was her face perfect, but she also gave off a feeling of being a phoenix amongst a flock of chickens even amongst these beauties.

Long Chen’s heart leaped. This was his first time encountering someone who could compare to Meng Qi, Leng Yueyan, and the others’ beauty in the immortal world. He instantly guessed that this person was the leader of the Heaven Female Alliance, the academy’s number one beauty, Bai Shishi.

“Hey, what are you looking at? Do you think that because you’re pretty, this stupid crocodile won’t eat you?” shouted Long Chen.

The other women beside Bai Shishi were all enraged. They had followed Bai Shishi for a long time and had never seen someone be so rude to her.

Any man would feel fear and awe before her. They wouldn’t even be able to speak. The only one capable of maintaining their dignity in front of Bai Shishi was young master Changchuan, but even he treated her respectfully.

Bao Shishi frowned ever so slightly. Looking at Long Chen, she slowly extended her hand, her palm facing downward.

“What do you want?”

Long Chen was confused before quickly understanding. He also extended a hand, and it clenched in a fist with his forefinger and middle finger sticking out.

After that, he pulled it back, feeling vexed. He then shouted, “How old are you?! You want to play rock paper scissors?! Get out of the way!” Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

The Heaven Female Alliance’s disciples stared at him disdainfully. Did this fellow really think that fairy Shishi would play such games with him?

Suddenly, golden ripples came from Bai Shishi’s hand, and the earth exploded. Golden pillars sprouted from the earth. They were several meters thick and covered in golden runes, forming a circular prison around the giant crocodile. Hundreds of them sprouted at once and then pulled in on it.

BOOM!

The giant crocodile crashed into the pillars. Its momentum caused the earth to shake.

Long Chen hadn’t expected Bai Shishi to be a terrifying metal energy cultivator capable of trapping the giant crocodile, so he was flung off by the sudden loss of momentum. Fortunately, he still had his reins and flew back.

However, blood-colored runes then appeared over the crocodile, and a terrifying aura rose. As its body began to inflate, the earth shuddered.

Cracks appeared in Bai Shishi’s golden pillars. Thus, a trace of astonishment appeared in her eyes. “This Explosive Flame Devil Crocodile’s bloodline is actually extremely pure. It has the potential to ascend to the king level. I didn’t expect to encounter such a strong devil beast here.”

BOOM!

Bai Shishi’s cage was shattered. Golden fragments flew out like shooting stars, blasting apart distant mountains. As for the women beside Bai Shishi, even with those fragments flying toward them, they were calm.

Just as those fragments approached them, they suddenly slowed down as if invisible hands were catching them.

“What terrifying control. She has complete control over them. This Bai Shishi really is powerful.” Long Chen’s heart shook. She was definitely worthy of being first on the Earth rankings. Although that was just a casual move for her, Long Chen could tell that she was incredibly powerful.

The crocodile roared, but with its mouth bound, the sound came from its nose. It seemed to enter a berserk state, and flames burst out of its body.

Suddenly, the Heaven Female Alliance’s disciples vanished. They were drawn into the golden war chariot, as they couldn’t endure these terrifying flames.

Even as flames exploded out of its body and into the heavens, as if it was trying to incinerate the very sky, Long Chen continued to sit on its head just like that.

Its flame energy was devoured by Huo Long, so it was unable to harm him. As long as he refused to get off, he was safe.

Golden runes flowed around Bai Shishi, protecting her. Within that golden light, she appeared even more beautiful, like a heavenly beauty possessing a divine radiance.

Bai Shishi stared at Long Chen with some surprise. He was actually able to ignore the Explosive Flame Devil Crocodile’s flames.

“Just who are you?” Bai Shishi asked once more.
