Chapter 5050 Misunderstanding, All a Misunderstanding


“You…!”

The Golden Crow race’s experts were enraged by Long Chen’s sudden slap. This wasn’t just an insult to the elder; it was a slap in the face of the entire Golden Crow race. This was absolute bullying.

“You what? If I didn’t show it off, how would you know my status?” retorted Long Chen.

The slapped elder was fuming. He had never suffered such humiliation in his entire life. With a furious roar, he was about to attack when the middle-aged woman raised her hand.

No one saw her use any divine ability, but that elder instantly went still.

Long Chen’s heart shook. He had experienced this move before. However, unlike the scattered and chaotic technique of the Long clan’s patriarch, her movements were light and easy, without a trace of her energy leaking. Her power was truly terrifying.

“Senior, are you declaring war on the Golden Crow race?” asked the elder. No matter how angry he was, he didn’t dare to offend her, so he still called her senior.

“This child only demonstrated the power of the dragon race so you would believe him. He didn’t have any malice,” she said.

No malice? Slapping someone in the face didn’t count as malicious? Then what did? This kind of explanation was too far-fetched.

“Just now, he didn’t use his flame energy but purely the power of his bloodline to demonstrate his power. You have clearly sensed it. That is the sacred power belonging to my white dragon race,” said the middle-aged woman.

“Even so, you can’t just hit people like that! That’s clearly bullying!” cried out a disciple of the Golden Crow race.

“That’s right! He even killed two of our disciples just now! One of them is an important heavenly genius that we were raising. This matter cannot be forgiven just like this!” shouted another two-vein Heaven Saint, finally finding an excuse to roar.

“Oh, so you can’t hit or kill people? How strange. You guys suddenly surrounded me and tried to kill me. Was I supposed to not resist?” sneered Long Chen.

These people had to be idiots. If the white dragon race hadn’t interfered, not one of them would be alive now. Who gave them the courage to continue shouting?

When the middle-aged woman heard this, her expression suddenly changed, and a terrifying aura rose.

BOOM!

The space exploded, enveloping the Golden Crow experts completely. After that, a wild pressure crushed down on them, threatening to shatter their bones.

“Senior, please calm dow—!”

One of the two-vein Heaven Saints begged for mercy, but he quickly fell silent, as that pressure gave him no chance to speak.

“How brazen! How dare you sneak attack a disciple of my white dragon race? Are you bandits that kill people for their wealth? Alright, since your Golden Crow race wants a war, then my white dragon race will use your heads to announce its beginning!” shouted the middle-aged woman. Her demeanor had completely transformed from dignified and composed to fierce and commanding.

These experts were like ants in front of her, their fates hanging by a thread at her whim.

Long Chen’s heart also shook when he felt this pressure. She was the most terrifying existence he had ever encountered.

Seeing her killing intent, with great difficulty, one of the two-vein Heaven Saints managed to spit out an apology.

“A misunderstanding! It was all a misunderstanding! We are sorry.”

It was indeed their mistake. Of course, if Long Chen were an ordinary person, this mistake would have been unimportant. However, backed by the status of the white dragon race, it became a significant error. Both the Golden Crow race and the white dragon race were immensely powerful entities, highly esteemed and protective of their dignity and honor.

For the Golden Crow race to sneak attack a disciple of the white dragon race over his Sun Flame could potentially ignite a war between these two ancient races, a conflict that could reverberate across the entire world.

“A misunderstanding? Then explain it to me. If you can’t provide a satisfactory explanation, don’t blame me for being ruthless,” said the middle-aged woman. She lightened the pressure, causing the Golden Crow race’s experts to relax a bit.

Their leader hastily said, “We received word from Pill Valley that someone wielding the Sun Flame appeared to have taken the core flame from one of our disciples. This prompted our actions…”

This elder hastily dragged the Brahma Pill Valley into this. In truth, the Brahma Pill Valley had only told them that someone was in control of the Sun Flame, nothing more. This elder only added some spices to his words.

“Give it up. My Sun Flame originates from a Fusang Tree I found in an ancient secret realm. It has nothing to do with your inherited flame. Can’t you come up with a believable story?” sneered Long Chen.

Long Chen’s Sun Flame was very different from the Golden Crow race’s flame. There were vast differences in terms of color, fluctuation, or shape.

Let alone the Golden Crow race, anyone with some understanding of flames would be able to differentiate them. For this elder to make such an excuse, did he think others were fools?

“I… half a month ago, we lost an elite disciple, and his core flame was stolen! When we heard of you, we immediately rushed over. Lost in grief, we didn’t pay enough attention to the details. It really is a misunderstanding!” exclaimed the elder.

Long Chen was about to retort when the middle-aged woman interjected, “Whether or not it is a misunderstanding is something you are more aware of than anyone. Since you claim it’s a misunderstanding, I will treat it as such.”

Hearing this, the elder instantly sighed in relief. Although the Golden Crow race was not necessarily afraid of the white dragon race, if these two enormous factions were to fight, the likes of him would be mere cannon fodder.Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Furthermore, the Golden Crow race and the white dragon race had always minded their own business. If they started a war because of one Sun Flame seed, people would be dumbfounded when they learned of the trivial cause.

“Many thanks for your understanding, Senior. Junior bids you farewell!” The elder hastily bowed and carefully led his people away. Despite losing a Heavenly Chosen and enduring a humiliating slap, he still had to express his gratitude. What an unlucky guy.

Once they left, the middle-aged woman’s gaze turned toward Long Chen, causing his heart to skip a beat.
