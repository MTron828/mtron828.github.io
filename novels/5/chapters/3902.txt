Chapter 3891 Splitting Sharpness

Yue Zifeng achieved absolute unity with his sword, transcending his physical form. His figure then vanished, leaving nothing but the ethereal embodiment of his sword. When this sword slashed through the air, the ten thousand Daos crumbled in front of it.

Long Qinian was engulfed by an extraordinary sense of terror, realizing that he had severely underestimated Yue Zifeng. He had never encountered such a terrifying sword cultivator before. When Yue Zifeng vanished, an inexplicable phenomenon unfolded. In an instant, all presence and existence vanished as well, leaving behind an eerie emptiness.

All that remained seemed to be Long Qinian alone, and the sword slashing down upon him seemed completely unstoppable. He actually felt despair well up within him.

Long Qinian knew that his will was already suppressed by Yue Zifeng’s Sword Dao. He had already lost, and the price of loss was death.

“Ghost Fox Sacrifice! Blood Bone Heavenly Burial!”

In a sudden surge of blood, crimson streams gushed out of Long Qinian’s body. His manifestation then trembled, and the bone plates on his body shifted and stacked on top of each other, transforming him into a giant dragon.

BOOM!

This giant dragon was the ghost fox evil dragon. Long Qinian had actually sacrificed a portion of his Supreme Blood and Supreme Bone in order to summon the heroic spirit of the ghost fox evil dragon. As this ghost fox evil dragon unleashed a thunderous roar, a wave of unimaginable power swept through the surroundings. Countless individuals experienced excruciating pain as if their heads were splitting apart. Their ears ruptured, causing blood to pour forth, rendering them deaf, unable to hear anything anymore.

“Evil Dragon Sphere!”

Long Qinian’s face was pale while standing atop the ghost fox evil dragon’s head. As he formed hand seals, his aura merged with the ghost fox evil dragon.

The jaws of the ghost fox evil dragon opened wide, and within its maw, a colossal sphere began to form. This sphere pulsated with two distinct streams of energy intertwining within it, and the sheer magnitude of this power reverberated through the heavens, causing even the stars themselves to tremble in response.

“What kind of power is this?!” Even city lords cried out in shock. They had never seen such a terrifying move before.

“Die!”

With a resounding roar, Long Qinian’s hand seals changed. He then forcefully slammed his hands on the dragon’s head. Instantly, blood-colored marks spread across its massive head, and that sphere shot out with endless destructive energy.Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Meanwhile, Yue Zifeng was still merged with his sword, his power unwavering. Spots of light appeared on the edge of his sword, resembling a constellation of stars. In front of countless experts, Yue Zifeng pierced into that giant sphere just like that.

BOOM!

With a heaven-shaking explosion, that giant sphere was pierced through, sending shockwaves rippling in every direction. Amidst the chaos, a ray of Sword Qi continued to surge toward the ghost fox evil dragon.

“What?!”

Everyone was stunned by this. Had this terrifying attack stopped Yue Zifeng or not? The sphere of light remained, but Yue Zifeng’s Sword Qi had pierced through it to strike the ghost fox evil dragon’s head.

BOOM!

That sphere and the ghost fox evil dragon’s head exploded at the same time, unleashing massive mushroom clouds that billowed into the sky. However, the aftermath lingered, as if time itself had slowed down, gradually dissipating the remnants of the devastating impact.

Although that sphere of light had been pierced, Yue Zifeng’s attack was incredibly condensed, so it continued to strike the ghost fox evil dragon at almost the same time. That was why everyone saw two giant mushroom clouds explode at the same time.

In the surroundings, fragments of the Grand Dao runes became visible. They also saw heaven and earth torn asunder and wild qi waves surging forth.

Countless experts were blown away by these qi waves. Even the city lords were unable to stand at the core of this tempest and were forced to retreat.

These astral winds were like blades, forcibly ripping a layer of earth out of the ground. The immense power caused even the surrounding eighteen dragon corpses to be blown far into the distance. When the dragon corpses were moved, it revealed the underground primal chaos sources.

Observing from above, the scene resembled a circular formation of eighteen springwater mouths surrounding the area where Long Chen stood. With the displacement of these eighteen dragon corpses, a torrent of boundless primal chaos qi surged forth, filling the surroundings with its raw and untamed energy.

Previously, these sources had been suppressed by the dragon corpses and flowed out slower through them. Hence, without any obstruction, the primal chaos qi soared and this world instantly became a sea of primal chaos qi.

Seeing this scene, everyone was delighted. They didn’t even need to do anything. Just standing there, they were absorbing endless primal chaos qi.

As they absorbed this primal chaos qi, they looked at the battlefield. They saw Yue Zifeng calmly standing there, looking the same as ever with his hair and robes fluttering lightly. Other than his face being slightly pale, it seemed that he was fine.

“Heavens, sword cultivators really are unnatural monsters! He’s fine even after such a terrifying attack?!”

The city lords were especially shocked when they saw this. Even for them, if they were struck by such an attack, not even a trace of them would exist afterward.

Standing in front of Yue Zifeng, Long Qinian coughed up blood, each spurt accompanied by the emergence of a dense blood mist. That mist then scattered in the wind, transforming into runes that flowed around him.

What shocked the onlookers was the fist-sized hole in his chest. Through that hole, it was possible to see a ghost fox evil dragon crazily raging in his manifestation.

When Yue Zifeng’s sword quivered, the void trembled along with it. He then looked at Long Qinian coldly. “That was the second move. You said that you’d give me three moves. Then I promise that if you can receive my third move without dying, I’ll let you live.”

Yue Zifeng’s voice was completely apathetic from the start. Regardless of Long Qinian's provocations or the emergence of his formidable trump cards, Yue Zifeng remained as calm and serene as a bottomless well.

This profound apathy exuded an aura of an unfathomable existence. His sharp gaze in particular felt like it could pierce through all fabrications in this world. It was a gaze that others didn’t dare to look directly at, as if a single gaze could pierce through the secrets deep within a person’s heart.

Yue Zifeng’s sword then pointed at Long Qinian. When the sharp will of the Sword Dao locked onto him, Long Qinian instantly felt like he had become a mortal. It was as though his clothes were stripped from him, and he was tossed into the ice and snow. That icy feeling then spread throughout his whole body, leaving even his soul numb.

Long Qinian was horrified, unable to think what had gone wrong. He had obtained the inheritance of the ghost fox evil dragon. After that, with an ocean’s worth of primal chaos qi, he had merged his Supreme Blood and Supreme Bone. He had thought that he was unrivaled within the same realm, that he would sweep through the three thousand worlds.

He had even been planning on getting revenge on Xia Guhong after leaving this world. Then, he would step into the peak of his life, becoming the master of the cosmos.

However, his dreams hadn’t even started before he encountered Yue Zifeng. With two emotionless blows, Yue Zifeng shattered his confidence along with those dreams.

Yue Zifeng actually called himself a subordinate of Long Chen. In other words, he was weaker than Long Chen. Now, Long Qinian couldn’t even beat Long Chen’s subordinate? Long Qinian took this as a wordless insult.

“AHH!” Long Qinian suddenly roared like an injured beast, full of anger and resentment. He refused to accept this cruel reality.

His manifestation then exploded, transforming into fragments that merged into his body. His aura, which was originally starting to weaken, once more reached its peak. It was unknown what secret art he had used to instantly recover his lost energy.

“Come! Let me see just how strong this attack of yours is!” shouted Long Qinian.

When people heard this, they shook their heads. Long Qinian had lost, having accepted his defeat in his soul. He had already lost the courage to compete with Yue Zifeng. Right now, he was only thinking about receiving Yue Zifeng’s attack to stay alive.

It could be said that Yue Zifeng had shattered his confidence with two attacks along with his ambitions.

Yue Zifeng snorted and raised his sword. But all of a sudden, his gaze turned cold. He stamped on the air and then vanished.

What shocked everyone was that Yue Zifeng didn’t attack Long Qinian. Instead, he appeared by Long Chen’s side and swept his sword out.

A dagger somehow appeared in the air, striking Yue Zifeng’s sword. As a result, the void exploded and a figure was forced out.
