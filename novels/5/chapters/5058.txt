Chapter 5047 Treachery

“Are you testing my background? Do you plan to attack me right here if it’s not strong enough?” Long Chen quipped with a mocking expression.

This elder was strong, more powerful than the four divine clans’ one-vein Heaven Saints. Moreover, his control over energy was at least one level above theirs. When he used his heaven vein power to lock Long Chen down, outsiders couldn’t see anything. They really thought that the elder was chatting with Long Chen amicably.

However, a one-vein Heaven Saint’s power was nothing in front of Long Chen, so he remained unaffected.

Seeing Long Chen acting so naturally under his lock, the elder’s pupils contracted slightly. He had monitored everything since Long Chen’s arrival. While enticed, the elder decided to observe the situation first.

The allure of the Sun Flame was potent, even to heaven vein experts. However, the elder also understood that those who possessed such a flame were exceptional individuals, as mediocre experts would have been eliminated long ago.

After a quick assessment, the elder determined that Long Chen was a tough nail, so he immediately switched to a warm smile. The elder responded, “Sir misunderstands. The Brahma Pill Valley has issued an arrest warrant for someone who bears a striking resemblance to you. I simply wanted to verify. It’s my duty, nothing personal.”

Long Chen’s heart skipped a beat. Someone who looked very much like him? Wasn't that himself? It appeared that he was already on the Brahma Pill Valley’s wanted list. However, judging by the elder’s reaction, he hadn’t recognized Long Chen yet. Otherwise, he wouldn't be smiling—it was merely an excuse.

“Then are you done with your test?” asked Long Chen disdainfully.

“My apologies. Of course you can pass,” replied the elder, gesturing for Long Chen to enter.

In the eyes of outsiders, a grand heaven vein expert appeared to be speaking amicably with a disciple, even displaying humility. They were impressed.

Long Chen chose not to respond further and promptly used the transportation formation to depart. As he left, the woman who had spoken with him transmitted, “Grandpa, should we...?”

“No. This person is very powerful. I don’t feel like I can handle him,” replied the elder.

“Even you’re unsure?” She was shocked, unable to believe that a heaven vein expert couldn’t subdue a young disciple.

“His background definitely isn’t simple. His willpower is like steel. He remained completely unaffected under my heaven vein pressure, and his flame didn’t instinctively resist. He has hidden his true power deeply. Most importantly, we have no idea who his backer is. Capturing him is too dangerous.”

“Then are we really letting him go?” asked the female disciple, extremely unwilling to let such a golden opportunity pass.

“Let him go? No, I’ve sent someone to inform them, so sooner or later, they’ll find him. Hehe, we were the ones who gave them this information. When the time comes, they’ll share a bit of the profit with us,” chuckled the elder.

“But he’s just one person. How are they going to split it?”

“Child, don’t you understand? This fellow’s Sun Flame can be split into dozens of portions through various means. It might be able to produce even more flame seeds. They definitely won’t take them all for themselves. Are you worried you won’t have your share when the time comes?”

Hearing this, the female disciple finally smiled. She glanced at the transportation formation where Long Chen had departed, her smile now tinged with a sinister edge. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

After taking the transportation formation, Long Chen arrived at the next transportation node. He would need to fly for a while to reach the next city’s transportation formation. Thinking back to the smiles on those people’s faces, Long Chen sneered.

“Hmph, even shameless ingrates want to seem virtuous. What idiots.”

Who was Long Chen, and what schemes had he not encountered? Although he didn’t know exactly what that old fellow was thinking, the latter’s eyes had sold him out—there were no good intentions there. When Long Chen tried to be low-key, the fools would still find him, and if he became more high-key, he’d encounter higher-level fools. Was he fated to always encounter idiots?

Long Chen flew for six hours and encountered various groups on the way. Some stayed a respectful distance from him or greeted him as if fearing to provoke him, while others were more brazen, flying past him or even scanning him with divine senses from their battle chariots. Yet, Long Chen ignored their provocations, focusing on his journey.

Suddenly, his heart jolted as Huo Linger’s warning echoed in his mind—powerful flame fluctuations ahead seemed to await his arrival.

Long Chen’s smile turned cold as he knew the elder must have set a trap for him. Undeterred, he continued on his path and quickly saw a large group of figures blocking his way.

“The Golden Crow race!”

Dozens of experts stood before him, led by three two-vein Heaven Saints and five one-vein Heaven Saints. Young disciples of the Golden Crow race lined up alongside them, effectively sealing Long Chen's escape routes the moment he appeared.

They emitted powerful flame fluctuations, and their auras were daunting, causing everyone else on the path to hastily flee. However, after withdrawing to a safe distance, the passersby remained to observe. This was the Golden Crow race, an ancient species dating back to the primal chaos era, and the passersby were intrigued by whoever had offended them.

So that old fellow passed information about me to the Golden Crow race. Interesting, mused Long Chen as he observed their reaction.

The Golden Crow race had a deep connection with the Sun Flame, so they naturally wanted to know how a human like Long Chen could possess it. After all, the Sun Flame had always been a symbol exclusive to the Golden Crow race, and in their view, only they were worthy to possess it.

If other races had the Sun Flame, either they stole it or took it by force. In any case, if the Golden Crow race encountered the Sun Flame, they would definitely take it.

“Brat, speak! Where did you get your Sun Flame?!” shouted one of the young disciples surrounding Long Chen.
