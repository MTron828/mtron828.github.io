Chapter 3410 Water Mallard Race

Long Chen was surprised. Someone was actually provoking the Lightning Falcon race? He then turned his head to see a group of tall, slightly pudgy women walk in.

The one at the front was wearing revealing clothes. She only had a short upper garment and a skirt on, which revealed the majority of her legs. Although she also had a thin layer of gauze-like material on top, it was mostly see-through.

The thin cloth that seemed to cover her up but failed to was exceptionally attractive. People couldn’t help wanting to look deeper.

Her face was enchanting, with a pair of fox eyes. Although she was talking about Lei Yuner, her overwhelmingly charming gaze was on Long Chen

Long Chen couldn’t help but shiver. His whole body turned cold, and he felt goosebumps on the back of his neck. This woman was so brazenly trying to seduce him. It was the first time he ever encountered such a thing.

“Wu Ying, are you looking to die? You dare to try to bully me?” demanded Lei Yuner.

Ying Bokong stealthily whispered into Long Chen’s ear, “Master, this is Wu Ying from the Water Mallard race. Her status is equal to princess Yuner…”

“What do you mean that her status is equal to mine?! They’re nothing more than some ducks!” raged Lei Yuner.

Ying Bokong jumped in shock. He had been using a divine ability to speak to Long Chen so that only he would hear, but Lei Yuner was so powerful that she inadvertently heard him. He hastily shut his mouth and hid behind Long Chen.

The Water Mallard race. It was also a noble race amongst the demonic beasts. Their innate water element talent made them famous within the Integral Heaven Star-Field. They weren’t lacking much when compared to the Lightning Falcon race.

Both were from the bird races of demonic beasts, but they weren’t friendly. The Water Mallard race was different from other flying beasts. They were allied with the land beasts and the scaled beasts.

The entire flying beast race was mortal enemies with the scaled beast race, but the Water Mallard race actually refused to stand alongside them. That resulted in many of the other flying beast races having bad relationships with them.

The fiery-tempered Lightning Falcon race in particular didn’t get along with them. The two had fought large-scale battles before, but the Lightning Falcon race was depressed since their lightning energy was actually subdued by the Water Mallard race’s water energy.

One was soft and insipid, while the other was hard and fierce. When they fought, their thunderforce was actually unable to gain any advantage over them. As a result, it ended up becoming a competition of core energy.

However, all those with water energy, wood energy, and earth energy had thick reserves of core energy. But thunderforce was wild and explosive. It couldn’t be maintained for long. When they competed with core energy, it was the Lightning Falcon race that was at a disadvantage. So despite detesting the other side, the Lightning Falcon race could not do anything to them.Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

The result was that both sides were hostile to each other. Thus, the Water Mallard race’s princess, Wu Ying, naturally didn’t give Lei Yuner any face.

Wu Ying seemed to be more of a schemer than Lei Yuner. She managed to infuriate Lei Yuner with just some words, and afterward, she didn’t even look at her. She walked right up to Long Chen and smiled bewitchingly.

“You must be the Boss Long San that caused a ruckus in front of the testing gate. As expected, you really are an amazing figure. A man like you should like subduing a mature woman, don’t you think? Silly little girls that haven’t grown up yet are very inexperienced. They definitely don’t have the same flavor as a big sister like myself. Why don’t you come to my Water Mallard race? We can offer you the highest level of spiritual contracts. As long as you are willing to stay in my Water Mallard race, when I become the leader of the race, your position will only be lower than mine. What do you think?”

Long Chen looked into her eyes and smiled disdainfully. She really did view him as a fool. Just from her eyes, he could see her arrogance and slyness. Moreover, he could see the contempt she had for the human race.

She didn’t care about him at all. This was just using him to slap the face of the Lightning Falcon race. He had been turned into a tool.

“You…!” Lei Yuner was so enraged that it looked like she was about to kill.

Long Chen grabbed her, stopping her. He then shook his head at Wu Ying. “Many thanks for your good intentions. However, every person has their own tastes. First of all, I don’t like fatties, and second of all, I don’t like oldies either. Go back to wherever you came from.”

“You…!”

Wu Ying’s expression instantly grew ugly. Her smile vanished and her killing intent raged.

It didn’t matter whether it was a human or a demonic beast, no woman liked others criticizing their appearance or age. Long Chen had called her fat and old all at once, infuriating her more than if he had slapped her in the face.

Lei Yuner was delighted by Long Chen’s response. After that, she obediently stuck by him, making faces at the furious Wu Ying.

“Inferior human, are you asking to die?! Do you believe me when I say that even with the support of the Lightning Falcon race behind you, my Water Mallard race can still make you die a miserable death!” shouted Wu Ying furiously.

“If I’m an inferior human, why did you choose to come to me? Doesn’t that mean that you’re even more inferior? We were just talking about business. If the business talks fall apart, why do you instantly turn hostile? Your Water Mallard race really is fickle. You turn hostile faster than the flipping of a page, no?” said Long Chen with a sneer.

“You…!” Wu Ying quivered with rage. When it came to quarreling, she was a demonic beast. How could she beat him with words? Even those old monsters who viewed themselves as skilled with words were made to spit out blood by Long Chen, let alone someone like her.

“You? What you? You came here with malice, so why can’t others retaliate? Other than that, I should warn you, I, Boss Long San, truly dislike when others threaten me. Furthermore, my temper isn’t very good. I’d advise you not to provoke me,” warned Long Chen.

“What can you do if I want to provoke you?” sneered Wu Ying.

“Not much. But with this temper of mine, I can always relieve it after slaughtering a few people. As long as your Water Mallard race has enough people for me to kill, do as you please,” said Long Chen, shrugging indifferently.

“Big words. Boss Long San, is it? Just wait. Once we enter the Divine Lord Immortal Realm, just watch as I tear out every muscle in your body,” said Wu Ying darkly.

“Then I’ll provide a wok,” said Long Chen.

“For what?” asked Lei Yuner.

“To treat you to some duck noodle soup.”

Wu Ying and the other experts of the Water Mallard race were enraged. But Long Chen ignored them. He turned with his arm around Lei Yuner’s shoulder and then pointed at one of the Lightning Spirit Blood Soul Pills. “Please buy one for me.”

The elder at the counter had been watching with interest as the two sides fought. Seeing that it was over, he was a bit disappointed.

“You’re just buying one?” he asked.

“I want to buy one for now to take a look,” said Long Chen.

Just buying one wasn’t permitted usually, because you had to buy at least ten at once. But due to Lei Yuner’s status, the elder didn’t mind selling Long Chen just one.

“Haha, the Lightning Falcon race is now so poor that they can’t even buy important medicinal pills?” Just then, Wu Ying once more provoked them.

Crack.

Just then, everyone was shocked to see Long Chen crush the Lightning Spirit Blood Soul Pill in his hand.
