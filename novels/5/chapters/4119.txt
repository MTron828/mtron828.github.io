Chapter 4108 Enticed

“What? There are several moons between this place and the dark gate. What is the issue?” asked Long Chen.

“In truth, the place that you chose is a seam in the dark gate. Furthermore, it is the first seam. You can imagine the life-forbidden area as a labyrinth filled with gates, and the dark gate is a long and narrow passageway. The gate to that passageway is now sealed, but there are still seams at the sides of the gate. Those dark creatures can squeeze their way through those seams. Furthermore, the seams can also be split into bigger and small ones. For example, the three worlds that we seized have comparatively smaller seams, resulting in only dark creatures at the level of World Kings being able to squeeze through. However, when the seams inflate for a moment, the occasional Divine Venerate dark creatures can force their way through. When there are many dark creatures, sometimes, thousands of Divine Venerate dark creatures manage to barge through at once.

“One moment of carelessness will result in huge casualties. The worst thing is that these seams fluctuate like the tide. Sometimes they’re larger, sometimes they’re smaller. But the dark creatures behind it are always waiting to launch a sudden attack and catch us off-guard. As for the world that you chose, it often has Divine Venerate dark creatures come out of its seams. To use your human race’s realm, they are on the level of Mortal Venerates. They always appear in the thousands at the very least, but sometimes even hundreds of thousands. But worst of all, when the seam grows large, Earth Venerate and even Heaven Venerate dark creatures can squeeze through. If we were to use our full power, we would be able to claim that land for a while, but after claiming it, defending it would be almost impossible. Let alone that place, even the three worlds that we seized often have eruptions of dark creatures that cause casualties every year. There is simply no end to them, so we cannot beat them in attrition,” explained Xu Jianxiong.

Actually, claiming a world wasn’t too difficult, but guarding it against constant random assaults was a different story. After all, every world had its own spatial passageways, and the dark creatures would attack with no rhyme or reason.

It was simply impossible to be on guard at all times. If a person were to keep their nerves tense all day, it would exhaust their mental and physical energy. But other than that, the large number of casualties was not something that the Fullmoon race could endure. Thus, they had never even thought about claiming that area.

Let alone there, even the three worlds that they had claimed were not considered entirely worth it.

If it was not for their strategy, they would even abandon those three worlds because the cost of guarding them was very high.

After they claimed the three worlds, they directly excavated all the ores and resources inside, so now those three worlds had no other value other than for their strategic deployment. Thus, they wouldn’t feel aggrieved about giving one to Long Chen. They would even thank him for taking over.

“Other than that, because it is too close to the dark gate, once that world is occupied, it might draw out dark creatures from the other worlds. Then you might have to deal with the attacks of dark creatures every day,” said an elder.

“They’ll attack every day?!”

Long Chen was instantly enticed. Ignoring whether or not he could find anything good in that world, just the corpses of those creatures were irresistible to Long Chen.Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

After all, the Moon Trees and Fusang Trees in his primal chaos space required a huge amount of energy, and he had used up all the immemorial corpses from last time. Through them, they managed to reach a height of three thousand miles.

However, without further corpses providing them with life energy, they began to shrink and were now just over one thousand and five hundred miles tall.

Long Chen realized that it was due to Huo Linger absorbing the Moon Flame and Sun Flame that the trees were shrinking.

However, Huo Linger’s cultivation had reached a bottleneck, and if she were to stop, it might limit her future growth. Thus, Long Chen told her to keep going, and he would think of something.

Now that he heard that endless corpses would throw themselves at him, he was really enticed by the prospect.

“That’s right. Creatures will attack every day in an unceasing stream,” said the elder solemnly, not wishing Long Chen to take that risk.

“There’s such a good thing?!” Long Chen was delighted.

“Good thing?”

Everyone from the Fullmoon race was dumbfounded, not daring to believe their ears. Had they misheard?

“You really want to claim that place?” asked Xu Jianxiong.

“Yes. I want to try it.” Long Chen nodded.

“Alright. Give us half a year to prepare. With the help of your medicinal pills, our full power should give us a sixty percent chance of succeeding.”

“No, no, Uncle Xiong, I will claim that world myself. I won’t ask for a single warrior from the Fullmoon race.” Long Chen hastily shook his head.

“You… Are you looking down on my Fullmoon race?” demanded Xu Jianxiong.

“Uncle Xiong, since I can call you uncle, it means that I don’t view you as an outsider. If I wanted to borrow something you had, I wouldn’t even wait for you to say anything before taking it. Even if you refused, I’d still take it. But I don’t want you all to risk your lives. If you were to have any casualties in the process, I would be filled with guilt for a lifetime,” said Long Chen.

Long Chen truly didn’t wish for the Fullmoon race to participate. If he caused large-scale casualties in the Fullmoon race, he would never be able to make up for it in this lifetime.

His meaning was simple. Resources could be repaid, but lives could not. They were not even the same concept.

“Brother Long, do you think that my Fullmoon race is afraid of death?!” demanded Xu Changchuan.

Long Chen hastily said, “That’s not what I meant…”

“You are clearly looking down on us!” declared Xu Changchuan.

For a moment, Long Chen didn’t know how to reply. Fortunately, Yu Qingxuan stepped forward and gave Long Chen a look. “Long Chen, really, do you treat the Fullmoon race’s seniors as empty air? If we want to claim that place, we’ll naturally need the race leader and Heaven Venerate seniors to help us. Without them, we can’t succeed.”

After Yu Qingxuan said this, Xu Jianxiong’s expression improved. After all, the Fullmoon race had its own pride. Having obtained the medicinal pills that they had been dreaming of, they felt like they owed Long Chen a great deal. If they didn’t do something for Long Chen, they’d feel extremely bad.

As for Long Chen, he actually didn’t want them to help? They viewed his statement as looking down on them, resulting in their anger.

Long Chen then clapped his forehead, irritated with his foolishness. Naturally, if Xu Jianxiong and the other Heaven Venerates participated, there wouldn’t be any casualties.

“My apologies, I misspoke just now. Of course, I need the help of Uncle Xiong and my other seniors. I just meant that I didn’t want anyone beneath the Heaven Venerate realm to risk their lives,” said Long Chen with a hasty smile.

“Brother Long, you…” started Xu Changchuan.

“You are an exception,” said Long Chen hastily.

Xu Changchuan smiled.

“Then when are you planning on going?” asked Xu Jianxiong.

“Tomorrow!”

“What?!”

The very next day, Long Chen and his companions walked through the life-forbidden area with Uncle Xiong and over thirty Heaven Venerates of the Fullmoon race. After a while, they arrived in front of a black whirlpool, the entrance to that world. It was like the gaping maw of a fiend patiently waiting for them to send themselves into its mouth.
