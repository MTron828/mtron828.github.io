Chapter 4361 A Synonym for Terror

Hearing Long Chen’s command, Gu Yang instantly turned vicious. His spear buzzed, and with a torrent of attacks, he sent his opponent wretchedly flying before piercing him through the head.

Eternal blood splashed through the air as Gu Yang stood before that giant corpse, exuding an extremely brutal aura. At this moment, he looked more savage than a wild beast.

Previously, Gu Yang hadn’t gone all-out against that expert. After all, he and the others had just advanced to the World King realm and were still getting used to their new power.

Other than that, it was a rare chance to fight an Eternal expert, so he cherished this opportunity and wanted to accumulate some experience.

However, after hearing that they had another appointment, Gu Yang directly lost interest in this prey. Having figured out his opponents’ moves, he killed the latter in a few blows.

In the distance, unwilling roars reverberated. As ten thousand swords sliced through the air, a giant head soared alongside them—Bai Shishi had successfully slain her target.

Following suit, Xia Chen, Guo Ran, Li Qi, and Song Mingyuan also unleashed their power, killing these terrifying Eternal experts one by one.

All the experts present were left in astonishment. Those were Eternal experts, and yet, they were slain just like that?

The Dragonblood Legion had long since gathered, confronting those heavenly geniuses of the other races. In a while, these geniuses were effortlessly sliced up like carrots in front of the formidable Dragonblood Legion.

Other human experts also joined the fray, killing the invaders and the traitors wearing their robes.

Traitors were always the most hateful existence, especially those audacious enough to openly come back and strut around. They were intolerable. Thus, no matter how they begged for mercy, their pleas fell on deaf ears.

Following the conclusion of the battle, Xia Chen gathered the corpses of the Eternal warriors, extracting their essence blood and crystal cores. Once he had obtained what he required, he handed the corpses over to Long Chen.

“Warriors of the human race, you’ve also seen that the other races want to exterminate our human race, sowing dissent within us. Hence, we must strike back like lightning. We cannot give them an inch. Today, I’m going to see the Six Great Lords of the Great Desolate World. We’ll see if they really have three heads and six arms to dare to challenge us. If you want to participate, you can come with us!” announced Long Chen before flying straight toward the gate to the Great Desolate World.

Bai Shishi, Yu Qingxuan, Guo Ran, Xia Chen, Yue Zifeng, Bai Xiaole, and the Dragonblood Legion were right behind him. Having just slain multiple Eternal experts, the Dragonblood Legion had high morale, appearing completely unstoppable.

Seeing this scene, the Starry River Sect’s experts came flying out, leaving their half-finished construction. They were all warriors, and none of them wanted to stay behind.

They weren’t afraid of others destroying their buildings or stealing their materials. No one dared to undertake such actions unless they were prepared to face severe consequences.

As tens of millions of experts from the Starry River Sect joined, the other experts were affected and also charged over.

The news that Long Chen was leading an army against the Great Desolate World spread with astonishing speed as if carried by wings. Upon hearing this information, numerous experts rushed toward the Great Desolate World from every corner of the world.

However, amongst those people, some only came to watch, while the others came to help. They knew that an immense battle would sooner or later erupt between the human race and the other races. Long Chen's decision to lead an assault against the Great Desolate World marked a pivotal moment in history, one that would shape the future of the world. Hence, most of these people wanted to bear witness to history.

“Dean Long Chen, we came!”

“Senior apprentice-brother Long Chen, we’re here!”

Numerous people hurriedly rushed over, with those who had fought alongside Long Chen and those he had protected during their tribulations being the first to arrive.

Upon receiving this information, many sects sent out their experts, and some of them even came out in full force.

After all, some sects had been bullied to the brink of their tolerance during Long Chen’s seclusion. If they didn’t strike back now, they would be forced to dissolve. Having endured up to this point, they seized this opportunity to issue a decisive challenge against their enemies.

Whether it was the humanless world or the Great Desolate World, both had sent bait toward the human race, leading many to join them. After gaining this support, they used the traitors’ power to deal with some human factions.

With Long Chen now declaring war on the Great Desolate World, innumerable factions rallied to fight alongside him. Pushed to the brink, they found themselves with no choice but to counterattack.

Other than the desperate factions and those motivated by a sense of righteousness, some factions just came over for the chance to fight alongside Long Chen.

Hence, numerous experts came flooding over to the Great Desolate World.

Even the conservative factions sent people over. Even if they weren’t going to participate in the battle, they wanted to bear witness to it.

“Boss, why not use transportation formations?” asked Guo Ran from behind Long Chen.

Due to not using transportation formations, they weren’t getting there particularly quickly. That was making Guo Ran a bit anxious.

“In order to give them enough time to gather people,” said Long Chen.

“Boss, are we really going to have a big battle with them?” asked Xia Chen excitedly. He understood Long Chen far too well. Based on the current situation, what Long Chen wanted probably wasn’t just to kill a few people.

“Today marks the rise of the Dragonblood Legion. When our name resounds throughout the nine heavens and ten lands, even gods and devils will tremble in front of it!” Long Chen exclaimed, and a decisive battle intent burned in Long Chen’s eyes.

“Boss, you’ve changed,” said Xia Chen excitedly.

“What?” asked Long Chen.

“I feel like the boss from the Martial Heaven Continent—the one who was unafraid of heaven or earth—has returned.” Xia Chen clenched his fists vigorously.

Hearing this, Long Chen narrowed his eyes and gradually smiled. “That’s true. I’m back. The last tribulation allowed me to find my confidence once more. If everything is right, then I shouldn’t reject or question myself. I have the golden lotus seed as a companion, and that is proof that everything I do is right. From now on, I’ll be doing whatever I want. I will run rampant and sweep through the heavens, and whoever tries to stop me, whether it’s a god or devil, I will kill them!”

Long Chen’s voice was decisive, domineering, and wild in almost a frivolous way. But it gave them a familiar feeling.

That was right. This was the Long Chen who had swept through the Martial Heaven Continent.Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

During his heavenly tribulation, he was always targeted by the heavens, so he wondered if he had done something wrong, causing him to be cautious as if he was treading on thin ice over a bottomless abyss.

As the final heavenly tribulation threatened to kill him, it was the golden lotus seed that intervened and saved him. Liberated from his constraints, Long Chen came to a realization: the fault did not lie with him; it was the world itself that was in error.

The golden lotus seed’s power was boundless and possibly even transcended the Heavenly Daos. Long Chen also remembered Aunt Gong’s words. So, since Aunt Gong had absolute trust in him, he didn’t doubt himself any longer and acted according to his own heart.

Eventually, Long Chen and his group arrived at a giant spatial gate, the gate to the Great Desolate World. Countless lifeforms had gathered behind it, and killing intent saturated the air.

“Brothers, the time to become famous has come. Today, the Dragonblood Legion will become a synonym for terror!”

Long Chen smiled sinisterly at those lifeforms behind the gate. His wings flapped, and he shot into the gate recklessly just like that.
