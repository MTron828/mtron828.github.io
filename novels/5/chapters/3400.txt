Chapter 3389 Like-Minded

Long Chen nodded. “This person caused my lover to die. He was also responsible for the death of many of my hot-blooded brothers and my respected seniors. The enmity between us is absolutely irreconcilable. He might control the majority of the immortal world, but I am not afraid. There will come a day when I cut off his head, destroy all hindrances, and create the world that I want.”

Long Chen clenched his fists. His hatred for Lord Brahma was carved into his soul. It didn’t matter if the latter was a Divine Venerate or even higher. This enmity had to be avenged.

“Good!” Wu Tian slapped his leg and laughed thunderously. “As expected of my good brother! Our thinking really is the same. I also want to topple the Netherworld and kill the leaders of the Netherworld. Back then, my Three-Headed Heaven Devouring Beast race sacrificed so much for the Netherworld, but what did we gain in exchange? I will smash apart this Netherworld and rebuild a world that I want. Hahaha, good brother, have another drink!”

Long Chen and Wu Tian once more emptied their bowls. Long Chen felt extremely happy. Wu Tian was so powerful, but rather than mocking him, he praised Long Chen for his wish. Long Chen was moved. The two of them exchanged a look and laughed.

Long Chen didn’t know how much wine he had drunk in the end. Ultimately, he collapsed on the table and lost consciousness.

When he woke up, he found himself on a large bed. He was surrounded by four burly men-, no, four burly women.Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

Being stared at by the four of them, Long Chen felt a chill. Faking his calm, he asked, “How long have I been sleeping? Where is big brother Wu Tian?”

“You slept for seven days. The Heavenly King led the warriors to attack the Ku Wu Star-Field three days ago,” answered one of them. Although it was a woman’s voice, it was very rough. Her voice shook Long Chen’s ears.

“A beauty like this is probably something only big brother Wu Tian can enjoy.” Long Chen was speechless inside. As expected, different races had different senses of beauty.

“Brother, you’ve awakened?”

Just then, a powerful voice rang out. Wu Tian had actually returned. Even before he arrived, a bloody scent already reached them.

Wu Tian was covered in blood and he had a spear on his back. A domineering aura still soared out of him. He had clearly just fought a bloody battle. There were runes flowing on the bloodstains on his body. The pressure coming from that blood even gave Long Chen’s soul a piercing pain.

Long Chen was shocked. That was clearly the pressure of a World King. The blood on Wu Tian’s body actually belonged to a World King. Furthermore, there were different spots of blood belonging to different lifeforms.

“Big brother, you went out to fight while leaving junior brother to just sleep? That’s not right,” said Long Chen a bit shamefully.

Their wine-drinking session had truly been satisfying this time. Wu Tian’s character had many similarities to Long Chen’s. Being with him was like being with a brother of multiple lifetimes. Long Chen didn’t need to hold anything back with him.

On that day, the two of them had been talking and drinking, to the point that Long Chen had forgotten what he had said. He had absolute confidence in this good brother.

However, although his alcohol tolerance wasn’t bad, his realm was too low. He couldn’t handle that powerful wine. So, he was unconscious for a full seven days.

Now that he was awake, he felt incredibly refreshed. It felt like he was full of power, and he could no longer sense the repulsion of the Heavenly Daos. He didn’t feel any different here than in the immortal world. That was the benefit of the wine.

“Hahaha, this place isn’t the immortal world. How are you supposed to fight? I simply took advantage of while you were sleeping to prepare a small gift for you. Come.”

The world around them changed. Long Chen and Wu Tian then appeared on top of the ancient city gates. Countless beast corpses were piled up outside the walls.

At the very front were seven giant corpses. Their pressure made Long Chen’s soul quake. There were actually seven beast corpses on the level of a Nether King.

These were earth dragon monsters. Their tails were like scorpion stingers.

“Big brother, you…” Long Chen was shocked and moved. Even his eyes reddened a bit.

“You want corpses, so I can’t bring out trash. A gift for my brother must reach a certain level at least. It just so happened that my next target was that star-field. I simply launched the attack a bit in advance, achieving two goals with one move,” said Wu Tian.

Back when Long Chen had said that he wanted corpses, Wu Tian had felt that Long Chen was just trying to give him a way out.

However, later, Long Chen had drunk too much. When Wu Tian asked him again what those corpses were for, due to already being completely drunk, Long Chen ended up vaguely saying that they were the foundation for him to raise his cultivation base. He lost consciousness afterward.

Wu Tian had been invigorated as soon as he heard that and directly summoned his army. They stopped cleaning up the surviving dregs and directly launched an attack on a new location. When Long Chen awoke, Wu Tian was already back with the spoils of battle.

Long Chen really did want to cry from gratitude. It seemed that in all these years, other than the five Sovereigns, no one had ever given him such a feeling.

“Big brother. I won’t say any superfluous words.” Long Chen took a deep breath and remembered this favor in his heart.

Long Chen put away the corpses. These countless giant corpses were something that would take the black soil a long time to finish devouring.

It had to be known that all these corpses had at least reached the Immortal King level. The lower level corpses weren’t even able to enter Wu Tian’s eyes.

As for those seven scorpion dragons, Long Chen didn’t toss them into the black soil. He placed them to the side for now.

This was a special species within the Netherworld. Their power was truly terrifying. Otherwise, they wouldn’t be able to become the overlords of a star-field.

Long Chen kept them aside, feeling like their corpses might be useful for other things. Considering the number of corpses, even with the primal chaos space’s devouring ability, it would take at least half a month to devour them all.

Long Chen wasn’t planning on tossing them all into the black soil at once. He wanted them to be absorbed bit by bit.

The corpses of the Underworld Cloud Dark Tigers had made the Wood Foundation Divine Trees bear the second generation of fruit. With so many corpses, if they were all added at once, Long Chen wouldn’t have time to pick all the fruit. They would fall to the ground and rot, turning into new seeds. However, Long Chen didn’t need those seeds; he wanted the fruit. So, he had the soil absorb the corpses bit by bit as he kept an eye on the Wood Foundation Divine Trees.

“Brother!”

Once Long Chen put away the corpses, Wu Tian patted his shoulder. He sighed, “It’s not that big brother doesn’t want to keep you, but you must leave.”

“What is it?” asked Long Chen in surprise.

“Have you not noticed? Your aura is fluctuating. You are now prepared to reach the next realm. However, you are from the immortal world, so you can’t make your breakthrough here in the Netherworld. If you stay here for too long, it will harm your foundation. You must return to the immortal world,” said Wu Tian.

Only then did Long Chen realize that after awakening, he had reached the great circle of Four Peak. Furthermore, his aura was undulating. He had entered a very strange state.

Sensing his own aura, he was delighted.

“I can attack the Divine Lord realm?”
