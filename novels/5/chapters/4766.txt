Chapter 4755 Not Knowing the Immensity of the Heavens

Long Xihe and the other experts from the Sovereign Emperor Heaven had a deep understanding of certain devil creatures and their habits due to constantly fighting them throughout the year. Most importantly, they knew some methods to repel these creatures, including the use of medicinal powders tailored to target specific types of devil beasts.

Some of the powders emitted odors detested by these devil beasts, as if they were smelling crap. Given the choice, these creatures would prefer to avoid people carrying such powders.

Thus, as soon as Long Xihe tossed it out, these creatures immediately redirected their attention from his group to Long Chen’s. Delighted, the disciples of the Long clan sneered at Long Chen.

“You arrogant fellow, do you think that the Sovereign Emperor Heaven belongs to the High Firmament Academy? You don’t know how immense the heavens are! In your next life, remember not to be so arrogant!”

Still nursing a grudge over being shunned at the High Firmament Academy, the disciples of the Long clan were immediately delighted to witness Long Chen’s predicament.

“Xiaole, those people are seniors of the Heavenly Desolation Long clan. Help them show us how to fend off these many Sage King devil creatures,” Long Chen instructed calmly, turning to Bai Xiaole.

“Me?” Bai Xiaole stared at him blankly. Would those people really help them block the devil creatures just because he asked them to?

“You idiot!” Little Nine exclaimed exasperatedly from Bai Xiaole's shoulder. Concentrating, it manipulated the surrounding space with its hands.

In an instant, those disciples laughing at Long Chen screamed in fright as they felt a powerful suction force drag them over.

Seeing this scene, Long Xihe was taken aback and stretched his hand out toward the void. However, just as he did so, an arrow shot over and pierced his palm, causing blood to spurt out.

“If my boss wants someone to die, not even a Yama King has the power to stop him. Do you feel like you have a chance?” sneered Guo Ran, pointing a multicolored giant crossbow at Long Xihe. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

The arrow and crossbow had just been forged by Guo Ran, who ingeniously combined his old crossbow with the formidable features of the Lifehunter Divine Crossbows. This fusion resulted in a weapon of unparalleled power, and even Long Xihe couldn’t fend it off in time.

This arrow had struck him without warning, its silent approach bypassing his sense of danger. Had it not been aimed at his palm, but instead at his head... The moment he thought of that possibility, cold sweat soaked his robes.

“What’s going on?!”

Just as Long Xihe was stunned by Guo Ran’s arrow, the disciples that had mocked Long Chen found themselves standing right in front of those Sage King devil creatures.

Seeing the few of them in their way, the devil creatures roared and unleashed their claws. The unfortunate few were instantly obliterated by the ferocious onslaught.

“Long Chen, what do you think you’re doing?! Do you truly wish to make enemies of the Long clan?!” roared Long Xihe.

The other disciples of the Long clan were all sweating. Fortunately, they hadn’t mocked Long Chen just now, or they would already be on the path of reincarnation.

“You were the one who chose to be enemies with me, so don’t blame me for being merciless. I don’t cause trouble, but I’m not afraid of it. If you want to play, I’ll accompany you,” responded Long Chen coldly.

Just from the attitude of Long Xihe and the Long clan’s disciples, Long Chen knew that they only meant trouble. If his father was really in the Long clan, he would definitely have to deal with them if he ever went to the Long clan. He could just deal with them now to save the effort.

With a swift gesture, Long Chen signaled the Dragonblood warriors to charge forward. These warriors were nothing more than the most ordinary Dragonblood warriors, not even squad leaders.

The fastest among them was the first to clash with the Sage King devil creatures. When his sword descended, one devil creature screamed in pain, its claw leaving its body.

It didn’t stop after that. This Dragonblood warrior moved like a phantom, appearing as if seven or eight of them were attacking the devil creature at once.

The devil creature's arms, four legs, and tail were mercilessly severed, followed by a piercing Sword Qi that tore through its abdomen, causing its innards to spill out and fill the air with a putrid stench.

The Dragonblood warrior then appeared on top of its neck. With a stroke of his sword, the creature’s head flew into the air.

Everyone, including Long Xihe, was stunned to see that. That Dragonblood warrior had killed a Sage King devil creature in the blink of an eye, breaking it into pieces with ease. From the first stroke to the final stroke, the Sage King devil creature hadn’t even had a chance to react. Everything had unfolded so fast that nobody had time to react before it was over.

In truth, this Dragonblood warrior hadn’t intentionally cut the devil creature apart to show off; it was simply their standard approach when dealing with opponents they had never faced before. Their approach involved observing and deducing their opponent’s weak points before delivering precise strikes. So, this Dragonblood warrior had actually targeted various body parts of the devil creature to collect information and identify more weak points.

After all, only once they knew their opponents’ weak points could they slay their enemies in one blow in the future. They didn’t want to waste the slightest bit of extra energy on their enemies.

In the blink of an eye, hundreds of Sage King devil creatures were obliterated by the Dragonblood warriors, sliced into pieces. With a wave of his hand, Long Chen drew their corpses into the primal chaos space.

When they landed in the black soil, the entire primal chaos space quivered as it burst forth with vast life energy that contained an immense primal chaos qi. All of a sudden, the entire primal chaos space’s vegetation seemed to thrum with some kind of divine aura, undergoing some kind of metamorphosis.

At this moment, Long Chen and his companions broke through the tide of devil creatures, which allowed them to see an endless battlefield and eight giant channels in the void.

Long Chen hadn’t even gotten a clear look at the surroundings when he heard a delighted cry.

“Long Chen!”

Immediately, Long Chen looked in the direction of the cry and spotted a familiar figure.
