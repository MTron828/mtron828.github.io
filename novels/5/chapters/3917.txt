Chapter 3906 Powerful Enemies Appear

People were startled. Just as they thought that Weng Tianyao was using the lightning tower to attack Meng Qi, Weng Tianyao suddenly cried out in a panic.

“Get back here!”

Weng Tianyao roared, forming hand seals and spitting out blood onto his palm. As a result, the lightning tower quivered and paused in the air.

To deal with him, Meng Qi changed her hand seals, spreading invisible Spiritual Strength toward the tower. After that, the Heavenly Dao Crown behind her head glowed brightly, and the golden bell quivered.

It was like an invisible hand was pulling the tower, causing it to shudder. Lightning raged within and around it, but it didn’t unleash any attacks. It seemed confused.

Seeing this scene, Guo Ran was the first to react and directly attacked Weng Tianyao. If Weng Tianyao couldn’t control the lightning tower, then this was the best chance to kill him.

BOOM!

When Guo Ran arrived, Weng Tianyao summoned a lightning shield that blocked his attack.

However, Bai Xiaole and the Violet Pupil Nine Tail Demon Fox rushed over as well, followed by Bai Shishi and the Pill Fairy.

Against them all, Weng Tianyao’s lightning shield instantly shattered. Seeing them coming, Weng Tianyao roared furiously and spat out more blood onto his hand seals.

BOOM!

The lightning tower finally escaped Meng Qi’s control. It then appeared in front of Weng Tianyao and smashed toward Guo Ran and the others, exuding lightning that formed into a giant net enveloping all of them.

“Be suppressed!” Weng Tianyao was enraged. His Wild Blade had been taken by Lei Linger, and he was thinking about how to get it back. But then, Meng Qi’s powerful Spiritual Strength actually disturbed his control over his lightning tower.

If he hadn’t used up a huge amount of his Supreme essence blood to control the lightning tower, he might have lost control over it. But with the support of his Supreme essence blood, this terrifying lightning tower was unleashing a terrifying power.

As the streaks of lightning weaved together, Guo Ran and the others were instantly caught. As space collapsed, their bodies began to shrink. They were pulled toward the tower.

But all of a sudden, a giant golden bell struck the tower, and its clear sound once more rang out.

BOOM!

As a result, the tower’s lightning net instantly exploded, which let Guo Ran and the others then regain their freedom and leave the range of the lightning tower.

They felt a burst of fear after escaping. This lightning tower possessed a terrifying power of law. Just now, their cultivation bases seemed to be sealed by some mysterious power, making them unable to unleash their own power.

“Long Chen, your death is at hand!”

Suddenly, the void shook and the figure of a woman materialized. When she saw Long Chen, her killing intent instantly exploded.

“The Nine Underworld Luocha!”

Another terrifying assassin had come.

“Hmph, Long Chen’s life is mine. I’ll kill anyone who dares to touch him!” Another arrogant voice rang out. At the same time, a myriad of flames descended from the heavens, causing the temperature of the world to instantly soar.

Yin Changsheng had also come. Now, he had a Heavenly Dao Crown on the back of his head, and his faith energy filled the space around him.

After that, the world shook as another figure emerged. This enormous being's presence alone caused the very land beneath him to quake with each resounding step, and his Blood Qi was akin to a raging sea filling the sky.

This was the Underworld Eye Giant that Long Chen had encountered during his tribulation.

Before the surrounding experts could snap out of their surprise, the sound of ten thousand beasts roaring rang out. Another powerful expert came, with the aura of ten thousand beasts on his body, his gaze sharp and incisive.

The Nine Underworld Luocha, Yin Changsheng, the Underworld Eye Giant, and this terrifying beast cultivator all appeared at once. Other than them, there were also many unfamiliar faces around. They were all peak experts with powerful Blood Qis and electric gazes.

The incoming experts were those who had just finished absorbing the primal chaos qi in their own treasure lands. For them to come only now, it meant that their treasure lands had an insufficient concentration of primal chaos qi, thus needing a prolonged period for absorption, or they had such immense potential that they required a larger amount of primal chaos qi and time to condense a Heavenly Dao Crown.

“Long Chen’s life is mine! I will kill anyone who interferes!” shouted the Nine Underworld Luocha. With a single step, she materialized in front of the Dragonblood Legion, thrusting her sword. From the outside, it looked like a simple and direct attack, but the tip of her sword actually quivered and unleashed a sonic boom.

In this critical moment, a golden sword cleaved through the air, aiming at the Nine Underworld Luocha’s back. The Nine Underworld Luocha was too fast, leaving Bai Shishi with no chance to intervene. Hence, she could only attack her in an attempt to save the others.

“Slut, scram!”

This interference enraged the Nine Underworld Luocha. Her sword spun, directly striking Bai Shishi’s sword, instantly ruining Bai Shishi’s sword balance. At that moment, the Nine Underworld Luocha vanished.

Bai Shishi’s expression changed, and without hesitation, a golden shield appeared in her left hand.

BOOM!

The shield had just started to condense when it was shattered by a sharp sword piercing toward her throat. It was unbelievably fast.Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

But just as this sharp sword was about to reach her throat, a golden light flashed in Bai Shishi’s eyes. A palm-sized golden lotus then materialized in front of her throat. When the Nine Underworld Luocha’s sword struck that golden lotus, sparks flew through the air, and the impact caused the Nine Underworld Luocha to stagger.

As a counter, Bai Shishi swung her sword at the Nine Underworld Luocha’s waist, cutting her in two.

However, just as she was cut, her figure vanished. When she reappeared, she was already miles away.

Bai Shishi’s move was beyond the Nine Underworld Luocha’s expectations. Her killing sword had locked onto Bai Shishi, so she had thought that she could kill Bai Shishi with this blow.

Fortunately, Bai Shishi was capable of shrinking her manifestation and condensing it in front of her, transforming it into an unbreakable lotus. Bai Shishi’s sword then slashed her waist. Although The Nine Underworld Luocha used her movement art to dodge immediately, the slash still left a cut on her waist.

“Slut, you’re courting death! Asura Doppelganger!”

The Nine Underworld Luocha split in two and attacked Bai Shishi at once.

Facing this terrifying assassin, Bai Shishi’s golden sword danced. However, she was unable to counterattack and could only passively defend because the Nine Underworld Luocha was just too fast. Her two figures could mimic the attacks of thousands of people at once, filling the world with illusory images.

Suddenly, sword-light flashed and a head flew into the air. Just like that, all the illusory images surrounding Bai Shishi vanished. Now, only one Nine Underworld Luocha remained, much to Bai Shishi's astonishment.

Yue Zifeng was standing in front of Bai Shishi, looking at the Nine Underworld Luocha coldly.

“You’re at a disadvantage against an assassin. Leave this one to me.”

“Will you be alright?” Bai Shishi couldn’t help asking as Yue Zifeng had just exhausted himself in an exhausting fight. He hadn’t fully recovered yet.

“I've recovered eighty percent of my power. It should be enough to deal with her.”

As Yue Zifeng pointed his sword at the Nine Underworld Luocha, a sharp aura locked onto her.

“You dare to look down on me?! Courting death!”

Enraged beyond measure, the Nine Underworld Luocha's disheveled hair billowed around her in a chaotic frenzy. A strange mark then appeared on her forehead. In an instant, her aura became frighteningly cold, as if she had been possessed by a devil god.
