Chapter 4545 Complete Annihilation

BOOM!

Just like that, the incinerated remains of Yan Baichen soared into the sky.

Feng You’s assault was merciless, destroying not only Yan Baichen’s body but also his Yuan Spirit. In one fell swoop, she erased Yan Baichen’s existence from this earth. Her attack then continued and swept up countless experts of the Black Rock Nine Underworld Python race, annihilating their elites.

She was like an undefeatable war goddess now, wielding a golden spear that sent shivers down her enemies’ spines.

Single-handedly, she broke the experts of the Black Rock Nine Underworld Python race. With Yan Baichen slain and most of their elites wiped out in a single attack, the survivors couldn’t mount a counterattack.

Hence, they directly chose to flee, but it was too late as the mixed beast race’s experts had surrounded them.

“The tables have turned. You sowed this karma, so now you can reap it.”

The mixed beast race’s experts launched a furious all-out assault. After all, Feng You had slain Yan Baichen, so both sides were truly mortal enemies now.

If they succeeded in eliminating every expert from the Black Rock Underworld Phyton race, without any witnesses or evidence, the Black Rock Nine Underworld Python race would not know who did it. That would be the best-case scenario.

“Kill!” The mixed beast race’s experts roared and collapsed upon the broken Black Rock Nine Underworld Python race’s experts. The latter could only flee desperately.

“Damn mixed beast race, just wait to experience the wrath of the Black Rock Nine Underworld Python race!” Seeing no chance to escape, some of them started to shout furiously.

“Tch, that’s if they knew who slew you all, no?” sneered Long Chen. He then started to rain down a barrage of arrows, each arrow claiming one life.

It just so happened that he could use the live targets to train his archery skills. He almost never missed, and sometimes, he would be able to kill two with one arrow.

Seeing Long Chen aiming for the ones running the fastest, the mixed beast race’s experts were delighted. There was no need for them to worry about any fish slipping through the net now, so they could fight freely.

Feng You came to Long Chen’s side after killing Yan Baichen. Seeing him slaying the fleeing experts like he was possessed by a god of archery, she couldn’t help sighing inside. This fellow was truly skilled.

Feng You refrained from launching another attack and just let her people finish the remnants of the enemies. While the battle was fierce and resulted in some casualties on both sides, such losses were inevitable. It was through such bloody conflicts that experts honed their skills and strengthened themselves. That was the only way they could survive in this cruel world.

The mixed beast race’s experts were like a pack of hungry wolves devouring the Black Rock Nine Underworld Python race’s experts. In less than the span of an incense stick burning, the battlefield fell silent as the battle was over.

The ground was littered with corpses covered in black-rock scales.

With the battle over, the mixed beast race’s experts started cleaning up the battlefield, gathering the equipment from the fallen. Feng You was planning on incinerating the corpses to clean up the crime scene, but how could Long Chen permit the destruction of such precious treasures? He directly took all the corpses, tossing them into the black soil.

“What are you so excited about?” asked Feng You, noticing Long Chen’s grin, which seemed like it could split his face. She couldn’t help but smile as well.

Long Chen naturally wouldn’t tell her the truth. Just then, a six-star Heavenly Doyen Fruit appeared on the Heavenly Dao Tree.

Now, Long Chen understood why that fellow was so strong. Six stars? It seemed that Yan Baichen was even stronger than that Lifehunter expert.

Furthermore, the color of this six-star Heavenly Doyen Fruit was different, as there were rock-like patterns on it. In other words, anyone who absorbed it would possess a similar power to Yan Baichen.

Long Chen instantly thought of Li Qi and Song Mingyuan. They were both earth element experts, and if they could absorb it, it would be like adding wings to a tiger.

Unfortunately, there was only one fruit, but there were two of them.

Other than the six-star Heavenly Doyen Fruit, Long Chen had gotten countless others: four five-star fruit, thousands of three-star fruit, and too many two-star and one-star fruits for him to count.

Now, the Heavenly Dao Tree was covered in so many new fruits, with a pile accumulating beneath its crown. As the spaces on the tree were limited, the emergence of new fruit would cause the older ones to fall.

Long Chen was overjoyed to see this pile. Seeing him smiling foolishly, Feng You nudged him.

“I asked you what you’re smiling about, alright?”

Only then did Long Chen cough and solemnly say, “I’m just happy for the mixed beast race. Their junior race leader has grown into such a godly existence. To be able to see you defeat that child Yan Baichen in one move, I’m almost moved to tears,” replied Long Chen.

While Long Chen’s words were just nonsense, they resonated deeply with Feng You, touching her heart in a way that left her speechless.

“Junior race leader, you really are amazing. How did you get so strong?” asked one of the mixed beast race’s experts. He was the most outstanding heavenly genius of the mixed beast race other than Feng You, and he had been her proxy while she was gone.

He had been vigilant toward Long Chen before this. As one of Feng You’s worshippers and followers, although he knew that he wasn’t qualified to be with Feng You, he didn’t feel like Long Chen had the qualifications either.

Feng You looked at Long Chen with immense gratitude. “In truth, it was all thanks to—”

“Haha, it was the heavens’ will. Junior race leader Feng You suddenly awakened her bloodline. The heavens are looking after the mixed beast race. Under her lead, the mixed beast race is destined for greatness,” replied Long Chen.

Hearing this, the mixed beast race’s experts shouted excitedly. Their heads were rather simple, so they didn’t doubt his words at all. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

“Long Chen...” Feng You bit her lip, not knowing what to say. In all her years, she had never been treated so well by anyone. After all, this opportunity was all thanks to him.

However, he was willing to give all the credit to her. It was all to secure her position as the junior race leader, making her people approve of her, worship her, and adore her.

Long Chen naturally didn’t want to claim a part of that glory or even do this to get their approval. This action moved the weakest part of Feng You’s heart.

“Let’s go. If anyone bullies me, you can help me beat them up,” said Long Chen with a smile.

Feng You wiped away her tears and smiled as well. She then nodded and clenched her fist. “As long as I’m here, no one can bully you!”

Long Chen was now the most important existence in her heart. If anyone dared to bully him, she would go all-out against them.

Just like that, Feng You and Long Chen led the mixed beast race’s experts forward gallantly.

In just half a day, they sensed a powerful devil qi erupting from the area left to them. Long Chen’s eyes caught sight of a group of devil experts.
