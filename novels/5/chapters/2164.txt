Chapter 2154 Yue Zifeng Arrives

The Heaven Piercing War Chariot was an important treasure of the Ximen family. It possessed immense divine power that put it on the same level of fame as the Dongfang family’s ancient city.

Legend said that it was made of a star that had come from beyond the heavens. Its history was ancient.

When the Heaven Piercing War Chariot landed on the ground, the earth shook. The door opened, and a tall, muscular man walked out. He had large eyes and bushy eyebrows. His figure looked like it had been carved by a knife.

“That’s Ximen Tianxiong,” said Beitang Rushuang.

Ximen Tianxiong was the Ximen family’s strongest genius of its entire history. His era had been even earlier than Nangong Zuiyue and Beitang Rushuang’s times. When he reached his peak, the others had yet to be born.

It was said that he was the first peerless genius to appear after the five Sovereigns. His existence could not be taken lightly.

His gaze sharply swept through the crowd. When he saw Dongfang Yuyang and the others, he merely paused ever so slightly. But upon seeing Long Chen, he narrowed his eyes and directly walked over.

“You are Long Chen?”

Long Chen was already used to people targeting him, so he indifferently said, “If you have something to say, say it.”

Ximen Tianxiong nodded. “Then tell me, are you colluding with the original devil race?”

Ximen Tianxiong’s eyes were tightly locked onto Long Chen, and a powerful pressure pressed down on him.

“Put away your aura. Your Spiritual Strength isn’t enough to probe my inner heart. You wouldn’t be able to tell if I was lying. If you want to target me, then you can attack right now. If not, then put away your hostility. I don’t like being glared at by others,” said Long Chen coldly.

Long Chen’s Spiritual Strength was so powerful that unless it was Meng Qi who had awakened a heavens’ soul manifestation or someone using an extremely powerful spiritual art, no one could observe his spiritual fluctuations to tell if he was lying or not. Ximen Tianxiong was looking down on him too much.

Ximen Tianxiong glared at him for a while before saying, “Fine. Don’t let me catch you doing such a thing. The original devil race is the enemy of the entire Martial Heaven Continent. After the five Sovereigns were gone, they tried to overthrow the continent, almost destroying the entire world. If you are colluding with them then I, Ximen Tianxiong, will be the first to cut off your head.”

After saying that, Ximen Tianxiong didn’t give Long Chen a chance to talk back. He returned to the side of his war chariot.

The Ximen family’s disciples had already set up a seat for him. Ximen Tianxiong sat, closing his eyes in meditation.

“This fellow’s plenty arrogant,” said Mo Nian irritably.

“He is qualified to be arrogant. He is the first true expert to come after the five Sovereigns. During those early times, the laws of heaven and earth were more complete. The Heavenly Daos that people like him comprehended are on another level compared to us. We might be on the same level right now because we’re all at the first Heavenstage of Life Star, but once the qi flow eruption occurs and everyone goes all-out absorbing it to increase their power, the difference will become clear. So even if you want to make enemies, there’s no need for you to turn him into one as well. Long Chen, you don’t even know how many low-key figures are currently waiting for the qi flow eruption to bare their fangs,” said Beitang Rushuang.

Even someone as strong as her felt a bit regretful about being born in the wrong era. After the time of the five Sovereigns, the laws of the Heavenly Daos had started to break down. Spiritual qi had grown sparser, and resources had diminished. Even after all these years, no one had managed to rise to a level anywhere near a Sovereign or even an Emperor.

That showed the decline of the Martial Heaven Continent. With each era, the experts of the continent grew weaker. Long Chen’s era was considered a declined era, and this qi flow eruption was likely the last qi flow eruption of the continent.

If no Sovereign-class expert appeared after the qi flow eruption, then the entire Martial Heaven Continent would be destroyed.

These geniuses of the ancient era had bet their entire lives on this qi flow eruption. This was everyone’s last chance.

“Being courteous to them won’t help me,” said Long Chen. “The important thing is that I don’t have their foundation. I don’t have a powerful sect or family to support me. The more courteous I am to them, the more they’ll think I’m afraid, so I’d rather be direct.”

As they spoke, more experts gathered. Quite a few people went to greet Dongfang Yuyang, showing just how influential he was.

“Curious, why don’t I see Kun Pengzi around?” asked Mo Nian. “Last time, that fellow chased me and made me cough up blood. I was preparing to get even with him this time.”

“You’ve fought against Kun Pengzi? Who won?” asked Beitang Rushuang, startled that this wretched fellow could fight Kun Pengzi.

“It couldn’t count as a fight. I just happened to run into the Xuan Beasts’ sacred land. My hands were a bit itchy, so I was thinking of going through it, but the Xuan Beasts are too petty. A large group of them came out to kill me, and amongst them was Kun Pengzi. I couldn’t beat them, so after exchanging a few blows with him, I ran. I even coughed up a few mouthfuls of blood. I was going to return the favor today,” said Mo Nian hatefully.

“You ran into the Xuan Beasts’ sacred land? Are you referring to the Peng Emperor Spirit Platform?” asked Beitang Rushuang, eyes large in disbelief.

“Yup.”

“You wanted to rob the Peng Emperor’s burial ground? That’s where the flesh of the Peng Emperor resides. It is jointly worshipped by all the Xuan Beasts, and you dared to rob it?” Beitang Rushuang continued to look at Mo Nian like he was a monster.

“No, it wasn’t robbery but a misunderstanding. My profession simply requires me to study things this way,” said Mo Nian hastily to correct her.

Beitang Rushuang was speechless as she looked at Mo Nian. Then she looked at Long Chen. It was no wonder the two of them had become good brothers. They were both crazy.

Just at this moment, the crowd burst into startled cries. Yue Zifeng had arrived.

Yue Zifeng immediately came to Long Chen’s side. “Boss, brother Mo.”

“Do you know what’s going on with Jian Wuchen? Why is he challenging you?” asked Long Chen.

“He is a traitor of the Heavenly Sword Gate. After coming out, he slew two disciples of the Heavenly Sword Gate that were experiencing the world. This public challenge toward me is his attempt at humiliating the Heavenly Sword Gate. As a former disciple, he knows the pride of sword cultivators, and he knows that the Elders can’t touch him without dirtying themselves. So when his challenge arrived at the Heavenly Sword Gate, I directly agreed. This time, I’ll clean up the doors of the Heavenly Sword Gate,” said Yue Zifeng.

Yue Zifeng was rarely angered, but this time, his eyes were filled with surging killing intent. He would not tolerate Jian Wuchen’s despicable method of blaspheming the Heavenly Sword Gate.

Long Chen nodded. “Alright. Once you kill Jian Wuchen, I’ll celebrate with you.”

Yue Zifeng also nodded. He walked toward the center of the valley and sat on a rock. He didn’t say another word.

“Long Chen, are you really not going to warn your brother? Jian Wuchen is an extremely terrifying person,” said Beitang Rushuang.

Long Chen shook his head. “There is no need for that. As a sword cultivator, he doesn’t need to know how strong his opponent is. He just needs to understand his sword.”

Even Long Chen had to be somewhat afraid of fighting Yue Zifeng. When he had learned the eighth form of Split the Heavens, he had finally understood the essence of Yue Zifeng’s Sword Dao. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

In that aspect, Yue Zifeng had long since surpassed him. Yue Zifeng was the most miraculous existence in the Dragonblood Legion, and also the existence that could not be estimated.

Ever since Ling Yunzi had wiped away the power of the Heavenly Dao Fruit in Yue Zifeng’s body, his spiritual yuan, soul, and even the power of his astral space had become lacking. He was normally as weak as a piece of paper. But when he took out his sword, he became a completely different person, someone so powerful that even the heavens could not constrain him. He was an existence of limitless possibilities.

He didn’t need his spiritual yuan. He didn’t need his Spiritual Strength. He didn’t need his astral energy. All his power came from his sword.

With Yue Zifeng present, the Dragonblood Legion understood what a true sword cultivator was. Their entire bodies and souls were devoted to their swords. It was a completely incomprehensible cultivation path for others.

Yue Zifeng was the fourth captain, but on the contrary, his power was the greatest amongst the four captains. When he took out his sword, there was nothing he could not cut, not even the Heavenly Daos.

Seeing Yue Zifeng now, Long Chen felt him to be like a sheathed sword. His aura was retracted, so he must have progressed even further in the Heavenly Sword Gate. In this state, even Long Chen wouldn’t say that he could win against Yue Zifeng, so he wasn’t too worried.

“Long Chen, there’s one thing I find curious. Why is it that with so many monsters in your Dragonblood Legion, they all admire you so much?” asked Beitang Rushuang. She saw that Yue Zifeng had entered a state of forgetting everything but himself, a realm of being one with the heavens.

“Because I give them food to eat, a place to live, and money to spend. I bring them to plunder money, I drink with them, I provide them with all the basic necessities, so they’re naturally doing well with me. What, are you moved as well? If you are, you should leave the Beitang family and join me. I guarantee you’ll have good food and drink for as long as you want. You won’t need to be afraid while walking the streets,” said Long Chen.

Beitang Rushuang immediately became scornful. How could she, the genius of an illustrious everlasting family, go with him?

“Hahaha, quite a few people have come today. Excellent, then I’ll show the world just how unfit the Heavenly Sword Gate’s name is.”

Suddenly, wild laughter rang out, causing everyone to look up at the sky.
