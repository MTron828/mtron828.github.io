Chapter 4458 Repaying a Debt

As Long Chen’s hand pierced through the black qi, a clash ensued between the golden light and the dark aura, and flames erupted between them. When Long Chen firmly gripped Netherdragon Tianzhao’s shoulder, a terrified scream escaped the latter. As a sacrifice, he could only speak and not move.

Netherdragon Tianzhao had never dreamed that Long Chen possessed a trump card capable of resisting the Nether Emperor’s power. Everyone was left stunned by this revelation.

Long Chen was simply a monster, not even placing the Nether Emperor in his eyes. He was fighting over someone inside the Nether Emperor’s barrier.

As Long Chen pulled, the black qi exploded, exuding a supreme divine might. It felt as if a heavenly emperor had descended, and countless lifeforms involuntarily knelt on the ground, unable to resist the overwhelming pressure.

Long Chen’s actions had clearly triggered the manifestation of the Nether Emperor’s will. Every expert here felt their soul quiver in response. They were akin to frightened rabbits; whether they were Eternal experts or budding Doyens, they found themselves like ants in the presence of this terrifying will—capable only of prostrating themselves and not daring to raise their heads.

Just then, Netherdragon Tianzhao grew transparent, while the golden lotus seed above Long Chen’s head dimmed a bit.

The golden lotus seed clearly didn’t have enough power to resist the will of the Nether Emperor. At most, it could temporarily help Long Chen resist its power.

It was understandable though as the Nether Emperor was an unfathomable existence. Just like that, Netherdragon Tianzhao was on the verge of being transported to another world.

“Long Chen, you can’t kill me in the end! Just you wait! Once I come back, I’ll kill your whole family, your whole race!” Grasping the situation, Netherdragon Tianzhao didn’t cower anymore and barked in response.

“Get out here!” Long Chen roared.

As he pulled with all his might, blood sprayed through the air, accompanied by a miserable scream. Long Chen suddenly flew back.

The black qi dissipated, and Netherdragon Tianzhao vanished. On the battlefield, only Long Chen remained, gripping a lone arm severed from Netherdragon Tianzhao.

At this moment, Long Chen’s expression was frighteningly dark, and killing intent was exploding out of him. In the end, he was unable to kill Netherdragon Tianzhao.

Both the heavens and the Nether Emperor didn’t let him kill Netherdragon Tianzhao, causing flames of fury to blaze in Long Chen’s heart. Even with all of his power, he was unable to kill a single traitor of the dragon race.

Long Chen looked at the spot where Netherdragon Tianzhao had disappeared, his killing intent intensifying. Many people trembled in terror at the sight of his figure.

He was an existence that even dared to resist the Nether Emperor. Was there anything in this world that he didn’t dare to do?

In this battle, Long Chen’s domineering and fierce actions had completely terrified them. They had never seen such a ruthless character before.

Just then, the void exploded, causing Ye Ling’s expression to change. There were now countless cracks around her seal, and its divine mark had shattered.

“Long Chen, he’s about to come out! I cannot contain him any longer. Run!” shouted Ye Ling.

Once the nether dragon race leader came out, it would be too late for them to leave. While she had managed to bind him, that didn’t mean that her power was equal to his.

The main reason she was able to seal him was because he had been too careless at the start. However, once he broke free, there would be no way to stop him.

If he activated the Ten Thousand Dragon Nest, he would be able to wipe everyone here out of existence.

As Ye Ling cast a worried glance at the Ten Thousand Dragon Nest, Long Chen too directed his gaze toward it, but a sudden and vicious glint ignited in his eyes.

“Since Netherdragon Tianzhao has run off, I’ll be taking your Ten Thousand Dragon Nest to pay off his debt!”

Long Chen suddenly shot straight toward the Ten Thousand Dragon Nest, drawing countless shocked gazes.Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

“What is he planning to do?!”

“It couldn’t be…!”

“Impossible!”

“That’s the priceless treasure of the nether dragon race! Other than the race leader, no one else can control it!”

When they saw Long Chen standing on top of the Ten Thousand Dragon Nest, everyone was stunned. They seemed to grasp what Long Chen wanted to do, but they couldn’t believe he could do it.

“Is he crazy?!”

Even the nether dragon race’s experts were bewildered. Had Long Chen really set his sights on the Ten Thousand Dragon Nest?

The nest was a condensation of innumerable dragon corpses, and each of them had to at least reach the Eternal realm to qualify for it.

In fact, some weaker Eternal dragons didn’t meet the criteria to merge with the nest. Only the powerful nether dragons could have their corpses incorporated into it.

When all their power was combined, the user could use the attack of millions of dragons at once. Furthermore, amongst those dragons, were many Saints.

The strength of the nether dragon race stemmed from the accumulation of power across generations. Each race leader who was in the prime of their life would opt to merge into the Ten Thousand Dragon Nest, sacrificing their life to enhance the collective might of the race.

This method wasn’t exclusive to the nether dragon race. With the exception of the true dragon race, all other dragon races could employ this method.

Through the continuous accumulation of power, akin to rolling a snowball, they bolstered the strength of their respective races.

While Netherdragon Tianzhao had become the first awakened Doyen with his own talent, this accomplishment was intricately tied to this unique treasure—the nether dragon race’s accumulation of power over millions of years.

This Ten Thousand Dragon Nest was the nether dragon race’s home, and Long Chen's audacious intention to claim it left the experts of the nether dragon race staring at him as if he were a hopeless fool.

Not even their vice race leader possessed the authority to control the Ten Thousand Dragon Nest; that privilege was reserved solely for the race leader.

In a sudden burst, Long Chen slammed the severed arm he held onto the dragon nest. As a result, the armor of the nest exploded, and black blood merged into it.

Long Chen then pressed his hands on it, and his golden dragon blood flowed into the black nest.

“Not good! He’s using the young master’s blood as the guide to invade the Ten Thousand Dragon Nest!” Suddenly, one of the nether dragon race’s Eternal experts cried out.

The only one capable of controlling the Ten Thousand Dragon Nest was the race leader. However, given that Netherdragon Tianzhao was his son, Long Chen might be able to exert control over the nest using his blood.

Golden runes streamed from Long Chen’s hands, tracing Netherdragon Tianzhao’s essence blood. They resembled roots invading the nest.

The experts of the nether dragon race watched in horror as their home began to tremble unexpectedly.

“Stop him!” They let out terrified cries and surged forward. The Ten Thousand Dragon Nest was moving somehow. Although that didn’t mean that Long Chen could control it, this was enough to drive them nuts.

Just as they charged forward, the void quivered, and the Dragonblood Legion appeared out of nowhere, blocking their way.

“Kill!”

With a collective heaven-shaking roar, the Dragonblood Legion collapsed on them.
