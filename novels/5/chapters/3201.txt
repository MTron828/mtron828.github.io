Chapter 3190 Heavenly Tribulation, Divine Punishment

The Falling Sunset Prefecture was at the southern border of the Heavenly Swell Domain. This prefecture was filled with desolate mountains and empty lakes. It was the prefecture with the least people among the nine prefectures.

However, it had been rather lively lately. In the northwest mountain range, within a mysterious valley, a towering statue had been constructed.

That was a statue of Enpuda. At the end of this valley was a stone mountain that had been carved into a palace. This place had become a branch of the Bloodkill Hall.

Compared to the Martial Heaven Continent, the Bloodkill Hall was more exposed here. In the immortal world, although the Bloodkill Hall’s reputation was terrible, they were backed by Enpuda, so even if people knew, no one dared to challenge them.

There were naturally some terrifying powers that the Bloodkill Hall didn’t dare to offend, and the Bloodkill Hall didn’t do anything to those powerful forces. It was only those that they could offend that they targeted, so the Bloodkill Hall was able to live out in the sun in the immortal world.

Countless experts were coming and going here. It was exceptionally lively. Within the palace was a flood of people. They seemed to be gathering.

On top of a large mountain, Long Chen watched them from a distance. Killing intent burned in his eyes when he looked at the statue and those people.

“This place is the limit. Those fellows seem to be prepared for if we attack them. They’ve fully activated Enpuda’s divine sense formation. My spatial divine ability cannot hide from them,” said Bai Xiaole’s mother.

She had brought Long Chen and Qin Feng here. Originally, with her spatial talent, she should have been able to bring them closer. But the Bloodkill Hall wasn’t giving them any chance to sneak attack.

“No problem. As long as senior can send us to that plaza, everything will be handled. I’d like senior to keep watch from the side. I will send Qin Feng out in a bit, so please help me receive him,” said Long Chen.

“Are you sure about this?” asked Bai Xiaole’s mother.

She hadn’t even asked what Long Chen was planning. But his current appearance already told her.

When Long Chen asked her for help, she received word from the dean to not ask anything and directly agree, so she brought Long Chen and Qin Feng here.

Seeing the Bloodkill Hall’s experts milling about, it seemed that they weren’t bragging. They had most likely brought all the experts of multiple branches of theirs.

There were also the heads of many other powers present. Long Chen wanted to undergo tribulation here? That was truly a crazy idea.

With so many Divine Lords here, it would transform into a heavenly tribulation capable of killing them all. However, as long as the person undergoing tribulation was killed, the tribulation would end immediately.

Before those Divine Lords were slain, Long Chen himself might be killed by the tribulation. Hence, she very much wished to urge him to give up. This was impossible. She didn’t know why the academy wasn’t stopping him.

“Senior, don’t worry. I do this very often. It’s a walk in the park. As long as you can send us in, you can just watch the fun from the side,” said Long Chen, a sinister coldness flashing in his eyes.

They wished to play? He had long since stopped playing using such meaningless tricks. But since they wanted to play, he would make it even bigger.

Long Chen originally hadn’t wanted to take this risk. He knew that his heavenly tribulations were always terrifying. If he underwent it in the auspicious land, it should give him a slightly higher chance of success.

His tribulations were always killer tribulations. However, the Bloodkill Hall had completely infuriated him. If he didn’t give them a proper lesson, how would they know who Boss Long San was?

“Alright.” Bai Xiaole’s mother didn’t say much else. She slowly formed hand seals.

At this moment, Long Chen took a deep breath, and Qin Feng was completely focused. He was in his peak state. He knew what was about to happen, but he wasn’t nervous. Instead, he was excited.

Suddenly, a streak of light enveloped Long Chen and Qin Feng, bringing them flying toward the Bloodkill Hall. A barrier instantly appeared in front of them, and an ear-piercing alarm rang out.

Long Chen and Qin Feng smashed into the barrier. After that, the light covering them vanished. They felt that space had been displaced, and they suddenly found themselves on the head of the giant statue.

The sound of the alarm drew out countless experts. When they saw Long Chen and Qin Feng, they were dumbfounded.

“Idiots of the Bloodkill Hall, as well as the rest of you fools, I told you not to provoke me, but you refused to listen. Today, I’ll let you regret it in hell!”

Long Chen’s aura suddenly changed. When his divine flames erupted, he broke through his shackles, sending his cultivation base to the thirteenth Heavenstage.

In that instant, the world turned dark, and a dark mass of tribulation clouds gathered. It was as if the heavens were about to collapse.

The world rumbled and the earth split open. It felt like space was being crushed. The Bloodkill Hall’s experts were all stunned. They had never seen such a terrifying tribulation.

Even Bai Xiaole’s mother was shocked. She was a Divine Lord and had experienced the Divine Lord tribulation, but even that didn’t possess such a terrifying power.

This heavenly tribulation contained pure destructive will that made her shudder. Her soul felt like it was being stabbed.

“What is going on? How can this tribulation contain no aura of the Dao or law? It’s only destruction, without a trace of life?!” Bai Shishi’s mother stared in shock.

“This tribulation. It proves that he is the destined one.”

Just then, the dean appeared by her side, along with the other higher-ups of the academy.

“You all…”

Bai Shishi’s mother was startled. She wasn’t even aware that the dean had been following them.

“Junior sister, let’s just watch for now.” Bai Shishi’s mother smiled and pulled her to her side.

Bai Shishi had also come. Seeing that tribulation and sensing its destructive might, she couldn’t help feeling fear.

In the distance, they heard Long Chen shout, “You pack of fools, boss Long San has to do some heaven-shaking things, or you’ll never understand that Boss Long San calls the Yama King brother.”

“This bastard…”

Seeing Long Chen and Qin Feng suddenly pull down their trousers, she hastily turned her head away. Bai Shishi and Bai Xiaole’s mothers also looked away speechlessly. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

In front of countless dumbfounded gazes, Long Chen and Qin Feng soaked Enpuda’s divine statue with their urine.

“Courting death!”

The Bloodkill Hall’s experts were enraged. It drew them out of their stupor, and they charged at Long Chen. They would not permit anyone to blaspheme the Killing God.

BOOM!

At this moment, Long Chen’s saber swung out, not at those experts, but at the tribulation clouds in the sky.

“What?!”

Those experts came to a shocked stop again. Someone dared to attack tribulation clouds? That was equivalent to becoming enemies with the Heavenly Daos. Was he defying the heavens?

The tribulation clouds were split apart, rumbling intensely, shaking people’s ears until they felt like their ears were being stabbed. Even Divine Lords fell deaf, unable to hear anything else.

The surging lightning was like an ancient beast that was awoken from its slumber by a slap in the face.

“Run!”

The dean suddenly waved his hand. Everyone vanished. Just then, the ground within a hundred thousand miles became covered in ripples.

“Crap, we’ve been locked down by the heavenly tribulation!” exclaimed a Divine Lord.
