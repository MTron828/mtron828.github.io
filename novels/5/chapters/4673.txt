Chapter 4662 Who is the Chosen One of the Heavens?

Filled with rage, Yan Tianhua unleashed his whip, only to find that his attack couldn’t penetrate the torrent of lightning enveloping Long Chen.

The heavenly tribulation had already started, but the laws had yet to change, which meant that all attacks directed toward other people would be weakened immensely by the heavenly tribulation. The greater the distance, the more it would be weakened.

Yan Tianhua’s attack would only remain in its best condition when used to attack the tribulation cloud, so he was unable to pose any threat to Long Chen.

Seeing that his attack was useless, Yan Tianhua seethed in rage, but he wasn’t the only one feeling this way. Long Chen’s heavenly tribulation was expanding hundreds of times faster than everyone else’s.

“No matter how large his heavenly tribulation gets, it’s meaningless. The gate to the ninth heaven has not appeared!” Some people made sour declarations. Even as Long Chen’s tribulation grew, no gate had appeared, which signified that he was also not the chosen one of the heavens.

Immersed within the lightning, he felt his dragon blood absorbing the thunderforce. Under this stimulation, his dragon blood seemed to awaken from a state of slumber and took the initiative to devour this thunderforce as fast as possible. The dragon blood was heating up, and once it reached a boil, it would truly merge with Long Chen.

The initial merger was simply a hasty gulp, but the tribulation would fully digest it. This was also why the Dragonblood warriors’ auras had undergone such an immense transformation after their tribulation.

However, while this tribulation was enormous, it lacked some intensity. The dragon blood within Long Chen was not heating up fast enough. If everything were in his control, Long Chen would have started attacking the tribulation cloud to quicken the pace.

Yet, he didn’t dare to be rash this time as he had a feeling that this tribulation involved too many karmas. One mistake and there would be no coming back from it. He had to save his energy.

Millions of small lightning dragons were swimming within the waterfall of lightning around him. Those were all Lei Linger, and she was crazily absorbing this thunderforce.

The Dragonblood Legion’s tribulation was barely a snack for her, as she only ate the tiny bit that the Dragonblood warriors hadn’t managed to absorb. But now, she could devour as much as she wanted. Long Chen’s heavenly tribulation was always a feast.

However, Lei Linger was smart and didn’t expose herself. That was why she was in the form of millions of tiny lightning dragons. She could easily disguise her aura within the heavenly tribulation.

As time passed, the tribulation cloud above Long Chen’s head was like a ceiling unable to bear its own weight. It was constantly collapsing, causing the hole to grow and grow.

Yan Tianhua had returned to widening his own tribulation hole. After all, the gate to the ninth heaven had not appeared, and anyone still had a chance to be the so-called chosen one.

The others were doing the same thing. No matter where they were from, they were attacking the tribulation cloud, trying to expand their tribulation.

The tribulation cloud was like a cover over the heavens, and waterfalls of lightning cascaded from it. The land had long since become a sea of lightning.

The tribulation holes were constantly expanding, increasing the power of the lightning torrents. At this moment, the guards could only see those powerful waterfalls, as the figures inside of them had long since vanished from sight. Every waterfall represented someone undergoing tribulation.

There were hundreds of waterfalls, but Long Chen’s was clearly on an entirely different level, as it looked even bigger than everyone else’s waterfalls combined, leaving the guards completely dumbfounded.

They were unable to imagine how a human could be the most flashy expert here, and this scene incensed countless experts who were on bad terms with the human race. Of course, within that rage was also jealousy.

“So what? The gate hasn’t appeared yet! He’s clearly not the chosen one. When our young master advances, he’ll personally cut off his head!”

“The heavenly tribulation hasn’t really started. This is just the prelude. Being flashy at the start doesn’t mean anything. The real question is who is the last one laughing.”

“That’s right. In any case, I refuse to believe a weak human could be the chosen one. They’re only fit to be slaves and food,” sneered a demonic beast.

All discussions within the vicinity were centered around Long Chen, fueled by jealousy and animosity toward him. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

As time ticked by, the initial stages of the heavenly tribulation unfolded at an agonizingly slow pace. An entire day elapsed without any notable changes aside from the gradual widening of the lightning waterfalls.

Yan Tianhua, Yin Jiushang, Yu Zihao, Netherdragon Tianzhao, and the others were doing their best to expand their tribulations. However, no matter how hard they worked, the difference between them and Long Chen only grew

It fueled their rage, and the only thing that comforted them was the absence of the legendary gate, which signified that everyone still had a chance.

During this time, some people tried to attack Long Chen, but they all failed. All attacks were weakened by the heavenly tribulation. They couldn’t even pierce through an ordinary lightning waterfall, let alone Long Chen’s enormous one.

As Long Chen’s lightning waterfall expanded, it eventually reached the point where it started to threaten other people’s waterfalls, almost devouring them.

The expert closest to Long Chen was nervous. After all, no one knew what would happen if their lightning waterfalls collided.

BOOM!

In front of countless shocked gazes, Long Chen’s lightning waterfall finally devoured the first person’s tribulation, drawing that person into it.

However, this expert was prepared. With a roar, he charged at Long Chen, and his powerful aura blasted away the surrounding lightning.

“Die!”

He was an immemorial divine bird. As his manifestation erupted, a pair of giant wings swept out, and a giant golden claw reached toward Long Chen.

This individual was undeniably formidable, having meticulously gathered power for this decisive strike. With a surge of energy, the full power of a nine-star Heavenly Doyen erupted.

“Insignificant being! Cloud Dragon Immolation Claw!”

Long Chen snorted disdainfully, and the resounding cry of a dragon reverberated through the air. A sacred aura enveloped the world as a magnificent dragon claw emerged from behind Long Chen’s back.

BOOM!

After the two claws collided, the divine bird’s claw directly exploded into a rain of blood.

“What?!”

This scene shocked many experts in the surroundings. After all, this expert was a terrifying nine-star Doyen with a pure bloodline, yet his strongest divine ability instantly crumbled before everyone’s eyes.

With a grimace, he spat out a mouthful of blood as his divine ability shattered. The next moment, he had a bad feeling, so he flapped his wings with full power, trying to retreat.

However, no matter how his wings flapped, he couldn’t move an inch because a hand tightly grabbed his neck, rendering him helpless.
