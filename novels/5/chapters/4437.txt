Chapter 4426 Challenge Letter

A berserk aura erupted out of Long Chen, blasting apart the clouds in the sky and sending waves of raging qi in every direction.

“I advanced three realms!” Long Chen exclaimed, his own power overwhelming him. It felt almost like a dream. Having just achieved consecutive breakthroughs, the energy coursing through him continued to surge as if he were on the verge of another breakthrough.

Long Chen was now in the fourth Heavenstage of the World King realm, bypassing the early stage and leaping directly to the middle stage. This rapid rate of advancement was undeniably terrifying.

A single medicinal pill was capable of doing such a thing. Apart from the consecutive advancements, Long Chen felt that his blood, meridians, tendons, bones, soul, mind, and other powers had all elevated to a higher level.

Just as the Earth Cauldron said, the Sacred Light Snow Lotus Pill truly was an all-encompassing elixir. Its effects extended beyond merely elevating his realm, touching every aspect of his being.

“I no longer need to stuff myself with pills!” Long Chen was so moved that he almost wept.

For years, whenever he wanted to advance, he had to stuff himself with so many medicinal pills that he wanted to vomit. While others ingested pills one by one, he practically devoured them by the barrel. This routine had become so repetitive that he started to question the meaning of life.

Eating pills wasn’t something fun. Moreover, pills that raised a person’s realm had violent medicinal properties and bad tastes. Yet, even when on the verge of vomiting, Long Chen still had to keep stuffing himself with them.

Now, with a single pill, he comprehended the true meaning of a blessing. In the future, he would no longer have to force-feed himself in such a manner.

The Sacred Light Snow Lotus Pill’s effect was so immense that its medicinal energy was still flowing inside of him even after raising his realm by three levels. Since its medicinal effect was not gone, he couldn’t consume a second one any time soon.

Its power was even greater than he had expected, lasting a long time. He had to wait until its power was used up before consuming the second one. Otherwise, it would be a waste of such treasure.

BOOM!

Long Chen abruptly swung his hand, causing the void to erupt in a burst of energy. His aura coursed smoothly within him, and his energy moved exactly as he wished.

Despite the recent explosive advancement, Long Chen displayed no signs of disorientation. Instead, it was like he had been in this realm for a long time. His foundation was incomparably robust, enabling him to wield this newfound power with familiarity and ease.

“As expected of a Saint pill, it’s incredibly powerful. No wonder the Earth Cauldron can’t refine other pills after refining the Sacred Light Snow Lotus Pill. I also can’t eat other pills after consuming it! It’s easy to go from frugal to extravagant, but to revert from extravagant back to frugal is no good!” Long Chen let out an emotional sigh.

“Where am I going to get more fertilizer?”

Long Chen suddenly grew itchy. Now, he was in an even greater rush than the Earth Cauldron to refine more Sacred Light Snow Lotus Pills.

Just then, the tablet on Long Chen’s waist started to flash rapidly.

“Is there something going on in the academy?”

Long Chen was startled. This was an urgent summon, so Long Chen immediately used his Kunpeng wings to return to the academy.

As soon as he arrived, he saw a group of figures outside the mountain gates.

“What’s going on? Is this a joint attack on the academy?”

However, once Long Chen got close, he realized that despite the numerous numbers, they were all just spectators as they weren’t acting overbearing or arrogant.

Instead, an arrogant voice resonated from within the gate, its sound extending across thousands of miles.

“Where is Long Chen? After I’ve come out to see him, is the illustrious Dean Long Chen really going to cower like a tortoise?”

Despite the speaker raising his voice as loudly as he could, there was a formation here, so his voice was unable to reach the inner academy. Clearly, this person was saying this to the people outside.

“We already told you that Dean Long Chen is not in the academy right now. If you wish to issue a challenge, you’ll have to wait until Dean Long Chen returns,” explained one of the attendants by the gates, his tone neither servile nor overbearing.

This attendant was only an Earth Venerate and was no longer young. Against that person’s pressure, he was clearly at a disadvantage. However, he still did his best to keep his voice calm.

The troublemaker was an expert from the demonic beast race, distinguished by two prominent horns on his head and an overpowering Blood Qi. What surprised Long Chen was the uncanny similarity between this person's aura and that of the Netherdragon Tianye. It seemed that this guy was also aiming to become a Heavenly Doyen.

Long Chen instantly realized that this person was from the nether dragon race. Accompanying him were hundreds of other World Kings, each emanating formidable auras—effectively all Triple Supremes.

Behind these World Kings were over ten Eternal experts. Their aura was many times stronger than that of an average Eternal expert. They ranked just below the Saints Long Chen had previously encountered.

“Hmph, Long Chen killed a heavenly genius of our nether dragon race. Despite our nether dragon race opting for peace before force, extending a challenge letter rather than a declaration of war, Long Chen hides like a coward. The High Firmament Academy also lacks the courage to present its experts. What does that mean? Is the number one academy in the world unwilling to accept a challenge letter?” sneered that heavenly genius of the nether dragon race.

“That’s right, what is the High Firmament Academy doing!? After taking other people’s lives, you guys don’t even dare to accept other people’s challenge letters! How do you have the face to exist within the nine heavens?”

“What number one academy? The reputation doesn’t live up to the truth. If you don’t dare to accept challenges, you should change your name to the coward academy.”

“I feel like we shouldn’t issue a challenge anymore. Just destroy the gates! Then we’ll see if the High Firmament Academy will keep cowering or not.”

The spectators were shouting loudly. Clearly, they weren’t here just to watch.Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

The majority of these idiots came from their own worlds. Knowing that the nether dragon race was sending a challenge letter to the High Firmament Academy’s Long Chen, they immediately flocked over to watch.

The experts from various worlds were all extremely apprehensive toward the High Firmament Academy, so they wanted to use this chance to see the academy’s attitude. Was the High Firmament Academy still a peak existence of the nine heavens? Or had it really declined as everyone said?

The attendant's expression shifted as he witnessed the disturbance. Just as he was uncertain about how to handle the situation, a sinister voice echoed, “You’re going to break down my High Firmament Academy’s gates? Alright, we’ll welcome you at any time. Go ahead. I’ll break your heads next.”

Long Chen’s voice instantly suppressed the chaos, redirecting everyone's attention.

At some point, a black-robed man had appeared above them, and none of them even sensed anything.

The Eternal experts’ pupils shrank. They had previously gathered information on him and knew that Long Chen had slain a budding Doyen—Netherdragon Tianye. However, they hadn’t expected him to be this terrifying.

He arrived without drawing anyone’s attention. In other words, with his power, he was capable of killing any one of them before they even realized it.

“Dean Long Chen!” The attendant's expression shifted as if he had just seen his savior.

Long Chen nodded at him, signaling him not to worry and trust him to handle the situation. Long Chen then surveyed the scene, eventually locking eyes with the budding Heavenly Doyen. A smile played on Long Chen's lips.

“What challenge letter? Instead of waiting for some duel, why don’t we start right now? Do you prefer a one-against-one duel, or would you like to come at me all together?”
