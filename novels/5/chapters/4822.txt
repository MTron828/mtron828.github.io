Chapter 4811 Hidden Dragon God Defense

The devil lord was several times larger than the other devil creatures, surrounded by black qi and possessing a special aura, unlike any other devil creatures Long Chen had ever encountered.

As soon as it appeared, it let out a commanding roar that caused the devil creatures attacking the Dragonblood Legion to scatter. The Dragonblood Legion also parted to create a path. Long Chen surged forward, his divine ring materializing behind him with a resounding dragon cry, accompanied by countless stars within.

In front of a devil lord that was comparable to a Heaven Saint, Long Chen couldn’t be careless. The Split the Heavens runes on Evilmoon lit up.

“Five Forms in One!”

Long Chen swung Evilmoon down. In response, black flames burst into existence around the devil lord as it unleashed a punch.

BOOM!

With an explosive sound, the devil lord was staggered back, but Long Chen was also sent flying like a shooting star.

“This is a good chance! Attack!” Guo Ran shouted, charging forward with everyone to take advantage of this chance that Long Chen had created.

However, with one roar from the devil lord, black mist shot out of its mouth, covering the sun and plunging everyone into darkness. A berserk aura enveloped them, and before they could react, they were sent flying by the unseen force.

“There’s no rush. First, figure out its trump cards! It has never used this technique before!” shouted Long Chen. With his lightning wings spread, he dove into the black domain.

Long Chen had asked about the devil lord’s abilities, and Bai Shishi’s mother had provided a detailed account of their previous encounter, outlining all the major abilities of the devil lord.

However, this latest move was not among those mentioned. It was evident that the devil lord still had techniques it hadn't deployed in their previous battle.

If they wanted to beat this Heaven Saint devil lord, they had to first figure out its techniques. Otherwise, one slip-up would lead to casualties.

“Boss, our senses are suppressed within this black domain. Even my sense of time and space become blurry,” warned Xia Chen as he watched Long Chen dive in. Xia Chen was a meticulous person and liked to observe first before making a move. Even though they had barely clashed with the devil lord, he still gained some useful information from it.

As Xia Chen had described, when Long Chen entered this black domain, he couldn’t see, hear, or even feel anything, his senses numbing in the oppressive darkness. Most terrifying of all, lurking within this domain was a deadly devil lord whose mere presence inflicted crushing psychological pressure.

“Found it!” Evilmoon sneered, blazing with light. Hearing its excited voice, Long Chen didn’t hesitate to send all his power to Evilmoon to control.

“Six Forms in One!” Long Chen roared and swung Evilmoon again. The first blow had only been a probing one, and this time, it was his full power.

BOOM!

An immense explosion erupted within the darkness, accompanied by the devil lord’s pained scream. As the darkness dissipated, Evilmoon was seen slashing onto its back, nearly cleaving it in half.

Enraged, the devil lord emitted a furious roar, its form turning red as it entered a berserk state. A wave of terrifying qi erupted outward.

Long Chen bore the brunt of the attack, instantly sent hurtling through the air, his insides feeling as though they were being crushed. He struggled to hold back the urge to spit out blood.

“Damn!” Long Chen exclaimed in shock as he was sent flying, but Evilmoon remained embedded in the devil lord.

The devil lord roared again, unleashing a soundwave that spread in every direction like a tsunami. It was even more terrifying than the previous blow.

Once again, Long Chen was the first to be struck. He felt as though his face was being sliced by invisible blades, the piercing roar stabbing into his ears like needles.

Following this roar, the other devil creatures roared with it, their auras growing explosively.

“Not good!” Long Chen’s expression changed.

Even after being separated from Evilmoon, Long Chen's soul remained linked to it. Through this connection, he sensed the devil lord's emotional turmoil.

It had gone completely insane. Evilmoon's strike had inflicted a severe blow, fracturing its devil core. Knowing that it was going to die, it directly entered a berserk state to fully unleash its devil core and devil crystal’s power.

When it activated this power, it triggered a countdown to their demise. However, just before death, it could unleash several times its original strength. Devil creatures in this state became even more bloodthirsty and dangerous.

“How could we be so unlucky?!” Long Chen couldn’t help cursing. Bai Letian and the others had repeatedly warned him not to let the devil lord enter a berserk state, or they wouldn’t even have a chance to run. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

However, the more afraid of something one was, the more likely it would happen. Long Chen didn’t even understand what was happening before the random blow of his saber triggered the devil lord’s berserk state.

To make matters worse, Evilmoon remained firmly embedded in the devil lord’s body. Long Chen couldn't simply rely on his Spiritual Strength to extract the sword; even using his physical strength might not be enough to dislodge it. Evilmoon was wedged tightly between the devil lord’s bones, making it extremely difficult to remove.

The devil lord roared again along with countless devil creatures. They seemed intent on fighting to the death.

BOOM!

The devil lord stamped on the ground, causing the earth to shatter and devil qi to erupt. It then unleashed a devastating punch at Long Chen. Based on its furious appearance, it seemed to plan on blasting Long Chen apart with this punch.

“Boss, let me!” Guo Ran suddenly appeared in front of Long Chen, wielding a unique golden shield that resembled a door. Scales covered the surface of this shield, providing formidable protection.

“Hidden Dragon God Defense!”

A dragon cry rang out along with Guo Ran’s shout. When the image of a dragon head appeared on top of his shield, it seemed to come to life.

BOOM!

The devil lord’s fist smashed into Guo Ran’s shield. While Long Chen was dazed by the impact, Guo Ran’s shield didn’t budge in the slightest. Instead, the devil lord was sent tumbling back.

“Badass!” Long Chen’s jaw dropped. Just now, he had been ready to be injured by this attack. But unexpectedly, Guo Ran managed to withstand it.

Most shocking of all, Guo Ran’s shield didn’t budge in the slightest. This fellow had truly gotten stronger.

“Hehe, this is... nothing... pfft!”

Guo Ran turned around, blood oozing out of his seven orifices, yet he still managed to smile. However, before he could finish speaking, blood sprayed from his mouth, and he collapsed.

Long Chen was left speechless, noting Guo Ran's flair for posing even in dire circumstances. Observing Guo Ran's steadfast posture, Long Chen hadn't anticipated such a sudden collapse.

Most frustrating of all, with such severe injuries, anyone with common sense would refrain from speaking to avoid worsening their condition. However, Guo Ran couldn't resist showing off, even if it led to him passing out. Long Chen couldn't help but critique his posing, rating it at ninety points. Its finale was a bit lacking.

Long Chen tossed Guo Ran to the rear where the healing squad was. With them present, Guo Ran’s life definitely wasn’t in danger. Long Chen supposed that this was why Guo Ran dared to be so arrogant.

“Golden Heaven Earth Seal!”

Just as Long Chen charged back at the devil lord, Bai Shishi formed hand seals, and countless golden chains broke out of the earth, binding the devil lord.
