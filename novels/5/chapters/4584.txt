Chapter 4573 White Dragon Race

The space around Long Chen twisted, transporting him into a desolate world. Endless stony crags stretched as far as the eye could see, devoid of the slightest sign of life, not even a single blade of grass.

“What’s going on? Aren’t the first batch of people supposed to be taken to the best place here?” Long Chen had been expecting to be brought somewhere filled with treasures.

He had anticipated being able to lay his hands on priceless treasures the moment he arrived. Rare ores, extinct medicinal ingredients, powerful divine weapons—everything was supposed to be within reach. Yet, all he found was barren rock.

Suddenly, Long Chen felt a stirring within him. His dragon blood started to accelerate, heating up. Startled, Long Chen turned around.

“Damn...”

Despite his usual calmness, he was shaken to the core at this moment. He even forgot to breathe as he gazed upon the sight before him.

Once again, Long Chen encountered Ten Thousand Dragon Nest, but this time, it wasn’t just one. Several of them stacked on top of each other, reaching towering heights that seemed to pierce the heavens themselves.

“Haha, I’m rich!”

Long Chen’s eyes sparkled with excitement. If he were to suck them all into the primal chaos space, he’d be filthy rich.

With his Kunpeng wings unfurled, Long Chen transformed into a streak of light, resembling a shooting star. However, the Ten Thousand Dragon Nests were colossal, and despite appearing near, they were actually quite far away.

Long Chen flew tirelessly for a full hour before finally nearing his destination. Yet, as he drew closer, he was met with an even more astonishing sight.

He had only spotted a few of them from afar. But now that he was closer, he saw an endless expanse of Ten Thousand Dragon Nests. It resembled a vast cemetery, with no discernible end in sight.

He estimated that there were tens of thousands of them, and that was only the ones visible to him. Perhaps there were even more beyond the horizon.

This revelation left Long Chen flabbergasted. However, when he got close to the first one and pressed his hand against it, his delight dissolved into disappointment.

“Fuck, I knew my luck wouldn’t be so good! Its life energy has been completely exhausted!”

Just by pressing lightly, Long Chen ripped a hole out of the Ten Thousand Dragon Nest’s wall. It was useless to him.

“No, wait!”

Long Chen’s expression suddenly changed. Like a streak of light, he shot toward one part of the Ten Thousand Dragon Nest and stopped here.

“No way. Am I not the first one here? How could someone get here first?” Long Chen squatted on the ground and looked closely at the marks on the ground. It truly did look like someone had just arrived minutes ago. Furthermore, it wasn’t just one person.

“I’ll go in and take a look.”

Long Chen concealed himself. As soon as he entered the channel here, he was immediately greeted by loud sounds emanating from outside. Turning back, he saw a horde of experts rushing toward the area. Each of them exuded powerful Blood Qi, indicating their formidable strength.

“People from the dragon race!”

When Long Chen sensed their auras, his heart shook. Prior to this encounter, there had been experts who concealed their auras during the march, yet Long Chen had still managed to sense that they were people from the dragon race.

Now, another group of experts from the dragon race had arrived. Long Chen couldn't shake the feeling that this place held a shocking secret. Unwilling to get involved with these individuals, he hastily descended the channel.

This Ten Thousand Dragon Nest was on the verge of collapse, bearing the weight of its ancient age.

Long Chen observed numerous runes etched into the walls, but none were familiar to him; they were not immortal characters. He speculated that they were likely specific to the dragon race.

As for their content, it seemed to be nothing more than mundane inscriptions such as "Zhang San was here" or "Li Xi was here," lacking any significant meaning.

Every Ten Thousand Dragon Nest had a main channel that led straight to the core. That was where the dragon king resided—the most important region of the nest.

Long Chen quickly arrived at the core where he saw a bright ceiling with giant crystals hanging from it. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Those crystals were the precious dragon cores, left behind by deceased dragons for the Ten Thousand Dragon Nest.

However, upon closer inspection, Long Chen saw countless notches on the ceiling, indicating that someone had taken the cores. Only a few small, dark, and cracked remnants remained, depleted of their energy and no longer holding any value.

The presence of cracks around the notches suggested that someone had damaged the cores before their extraction. The irresponsible bastard likely utilized them as ornaments or claimed them as battle spoils. In any case, these dragon cores held no functional value.

Furthermore, looking at the marks left all around, Long Chen knew someone had taken them a long time ago, not recently.

Long Chen followed the channel and quickly exited this test. After that, he entered another one, following the tracks.

Long Chen didn’t know what had happened, but the tracks left behind by the people in front of him showed that they were in a rush. He knew that following them couldn’t be wrong.

He quickly started to hear sounds up ahead. Having finally caught up, he slowed down his pace.

“The dragon domain’s gate has fully opened. However, there are too many experts entering the Fantasy Spirit World. People who can’t find their own inheritances will quickly start to target us.” Long Chen heard a man’s voice fraught with worry.

“We have no other choice. Dark undercurrents are at play, and our white dragon race cannot survive as the only good existence in a world full of malevolence. If they only want to borrow our white dragon race’s bloodline for the purification of their own, we need not intervene. It is simply an act of goodness. We shall adhere to the guidance of the white dragon,” replied a woman.

To Long Chen’s surprise, her voice was like a breath of fresh air. It was gentle and kind, making him instinctively feel friendly toward her.

“The white dragon race?”

Long Chen didn’t expect to encounter the white dragon race’s people here. After all, they all rarely participated in mortal affairs. In fact, in the outside world, they didn’t have much of a reputation at all. Long Chen had only heard of them due to how much he had read.

“But they aren’t willing to stop with a bloodline purification. They also want our ancestral scale. At that moment...” The man fell silent at this point.

“Our white dragon race may be kind, but we will not tolerate such a thing. Anyone who dares to lay hands on our race’s priceless treasure will meet their end at our hands,” answered the woman. While her tone remained gentle, it carried an undertone that could cut through iron.

“Hahaha, what a joke. The white dragon race is but the sheep of the dragon race. What are you going to fight with?” A sneer rang out at this time, followed by startled cries from the white dragon race’s experts.

“Netherdragon race!”

Hearing the mention of the Netherdragon race, Long Chen couldn’t resist the urge to draw closer. Stealthily creeping over a wall to take a look, he was left stunned by what unfolded before his eyes.
