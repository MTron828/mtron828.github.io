Chapter 2297 Rebirth After Death

Translator: BornToBe

The crescent moon blades were only three inches long when they first appeared. They were like two transparent knives.

However, rumbling then rang out as divine energy flowed toward them. The terrifying wind energy formed a vortex around them, and even the non-wind cultivators could sense a terrifying aura coming from them.

Tang Wan-er was instantly delighted by the two blades. Her eyes also became like two crescent moons from her smile.

“Thank you big sister, you really treat me well. This is my favorite design!” Tang Wan-er shouted excitedly like a child.

“I’ve seen you fight, so I know your style,” said Leng Yueyan. “I specifically hunted down a divine devil overlord within the Netherworld’s wastelands, and I created this pair of crescent moon blades from its horns. It is also a divine item capable of growing along with you. There are three divine runes on it that you will be able to activate when you grow strong enough. They will unleash extremely powerful divine abilities. I heard from a certain person that little sister Wan-er gets jealous easily, so I did everything I could to think of a good gift for you. I hope you like it.”

Tang Wan-er immediately grew angry. “Which gossiper said such a thing? Am I such a person? I like big sister a lot! I wish you could return with us to the Martial Heaven Continent.”

Although neither of them said anything explicitly, the gossiper was naturally Long Chen. Long Chen almost cried. Was he really such a person? This foolish girl forgot about her loyalty to her man as soon as she got a nice present.

Tang Wan-er received the two moon blades. She suddenly waved one of her hands, and the moon blade unleashed a wind blade straight at Long Chen.

Long Chen instinctively dodged. The wind blade cut across his leg, leaving a giant slice. His life rod had almost been cut off, making Guo Ran and the others suck in a cold gasp of air.

Long Chen’s expression immediately darkened. “Wan-er, what are you doing?! Even if you want to suck up to her, you don’t need to castrate me!”

“Sorry, it wasn’t on purpose! I didn’t think that these crescent moon blades would be so amazing. I still can’t control them.” Tang Wan-er stuck her tongue out at him, a bit embarrassed. She had just been testing one, thinking that their power was under her control. As a result, as soon as she activated one, she injured Long Chen.

“Sister Wan-er, you should put those blades away. We’re not boss, so we can’t dodge that quickly.” Guo Ran and the others felt a chill when Tang Wan-er turned around. Looking closely at the two blades, they all retreated.

“Little sister Zhiqiu, you already have a divine weapon, so I don’t have a weapon for you. This Ice Spirit Bracelet should suit you very well. It will purify your ice energy.” Leng Yueyan gave Ye Zhiqiu a bracelet, and ice crystals flowed within it. Glacier designs appeared and faded. This bracelet was clearly not ordinary.

Ye Zhiqiu was grateful, but she didn’t say anything. She just nodded to express her thanks.

Leng Yueyan also knew Ye Zhiqiu’s character, so she didn’t take offense. She turned to Dong Mingyu.

“Little sister, you have Enpuda’s divine mark on you. It’s not a good idea for me to give you anything for fear of invoking karma. I hope you won’t blame me.”

“No, just seeing what kind of person you are makes me happy enough. You are the greatest gift.” Dong Mingyu smiled, her gaze a bit worshipful. She had always respected Leng Yueyan. When she had been a disciple of the Corrupt path, she had always followed her own will. Dong Mingyu wished to also be like that one day, to do what she wanted to do.

Leng Yueyan smiled. “Really, if you put it like that, I’ll feel ashamed of myself. Let me think, what can I give you…?” Leng Yueyan thought about it. Her eyes suddenly lit up. “That’s right, Enpuda has a set of techniques called the Heavenly Desolation Extinction Art. Have you learned it?”

“No, I’ve never heard of it.”

“Hehe, good. When you return to the Martial Heaven Continent, find your divine inheritance statue. Do this…” Leng Yueyan leaned down and whispered into Dong Mingyu’s ear.

“Alright, I’ll do it once I get back.” Dong Mingyu’s eyes were shining, but no one else knew what Leng Yueyan had said.

Some secrets were naturally not for everyone to know. Perhaps they were afraid of karma, so no one asked.

Meng Qi, Chu Yao, Tang Wan-er, Ye Zhiqiu, and Dong Mingyu had all received gifts. However, that wasn’t all. Even Cloud and Liu Ruyan were given gifts.

Leng Yueyan had printed a rune on each of their foreheads. Those runes activated the primordial runes within their bloodlines, allowing them to regain the power of their ancestors, making the two of them incredibly grateful.

Seeing that she stopped giving gifts there, Guo Ran grew uneasy. He respectfully said, “This god elder sister-in-law, your generosity and kindness fills me with worship. Bathed in your divine light, I feel reborn. My life before this was grey, but your arrival has brought color-”

“Get to the point,” said Leng Yueyan indifferently. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Ah… about that… is there a gift for this little brother?” asked Guo Ran expectantly.

Leng Yueyan looked at him apologetically. “There isn’t. Your soul and will are too weak. Even if I gave you something, you wouldn’t be able to merge it into your soul and bring it out. To tell the truth, you are so weak that it surpasses all expectations.”

Meng Qi and the others laughed at his expression. Even the other Dragonblood warriors couldn’t help shaking their heads. Their boss Guo Ran had truly received a grievous blow this time.

“But just now, I was the one who saved the entire Dragonblood Legion!” cried out Guo Ran, refusing to accept this. Even his boss had been unable to do anything, but he had done it.

“That’s also because of your boss. Those chains came from Purgatory and are also not within the scope of the laws here. That’s why you succeeded. Alright, I’ll tell you the truth. You are not suited for a soul divine item because it will cost you your life,” said Leng Yueyan.

“What? Why?”

“Because your soul is too weak. A divine item of this level has its own will. If you merge it into your soul, you will not be able to be its master, and the divine item will take over your mind, turning you into its slave. That’s why you can only use divine items that you create yourself. You can imprint them with your own will so that they won’t devour you,” explained Leng Yueyan.

Guo Ran looked down gloomily. “Alright, boss also said the same thing. Now I’m convinced.”

“Cough, Yueyan, our relationship is so good, so while it’s understandable that there’s no gift for them, I’m sure that you won’t have forgotten about me?” At this time, Long Chen also made his move. If Leng Yueyan had prepared gifts for all of them, then it was natural that he should have one as well.

“Oh? Is our relationship really so good?” Leng Yueyan looked at Long Chen questioningly.

Long Chen was speechless. It wasn’t as if he could say what had happened between them in front of Meng Qi and the others.

Leng Yueyan laughed and leaned down to whisper into his ear, “Didn’t I already give you my gift?” She winked suggestively, making Long Chen realize that she was talking about her other self, Ming Cangyue.

“I got that gift through my own ability,” said Long Chen.

“If I hadn’t built the bridge, could you have obtained her?” retorted Leng Yueyan.

“Fine, I admit you helped. Why didn’t Cangyue come? She didn’t want to send me off?” asked Long Chen.

Leng Yueyan said, “She wanted to come, but the laws here only permit one god to descend at a time. So only I came.”

“Oh, alright. Please tell her that I will think about her every day. Of course, you’re included in that,” said Long Chen.

Just at that moment, startled cries rang out. Guo Ran had vanished.

“No need to panic. Guo Ran’s Yuan Spirit has been filled up with the energy of this blessing, so he has been sent back,” said Leng Yueyan.

During this time, the light from the sky was constantly nourishing their Yuan Spirits. Following Guo Ran, other Dragonblood warriors began to vanish one by one.

At this moment, it was possible to see the difference between people’s Yuan Spirits. The weaker ones were sent away first. The stronger ones were being nourished longer.

The Dragonblood warriors gradually vanished. Then it was Gu Yang and the captains, then even Meng Qi and the others. In the end, only Long Chen and Leng Yueyan were left.

“Yueyan, when people die, do they come to the land of the Netherworld?” asked Long Chen.

“Yes.”

“You are the god in control of the Netherworld. Can you revive my old friends who died?” asked Long Chen.

With Meng Qi and the others gone, he could finally ask this question. Some Dragonblood warriors had died, and there was also Lu Fang-er. Lu Fang-er was a constant ache in Long Chen and Meng Qi’s hearts.

Sometimes when Meng Qi was alone, she would stare out into space. Long Chen knew that she was thinking about her days with Lu Fang-er.

Lu Fang-er had joked back then that she would marry Long Chen with Meng Qi. She would be fine being just an extra. But in the Jiuli secret realm, she had sacrificed herself to save Meng Qi. At that time, Ye Zhiqiu had also died, but an expert had revived her because a seed of her soul had remained intact. Lu Fang-er’s corpse remained, but her life had been lost forever.

Long Chen’s voice quivered when he asked this question. He looked at Leng Yueyan expectantly.
