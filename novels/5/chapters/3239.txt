Chapter 3228 Sword Pointed at the Chu Family

Long Chen was brought to a secret underground world beneath the Luo family’s territory. This was their most hidden place.

There were layers of protective formations here, and the spiritual qi was incredibly dense. At this moment, Long Chen saw six hundred warriors of the Luo family here, their eyes filled with emotions.

Some of them had more, some of them had less, but within all of their eyes, Long Chen saw a trace of violet blood. However, there were no violet pupils. Violet pupils were the mark of their violet blood reaching a certain density. In all the generations of the Luo family, only Luo Zichuan had awakened violet pupils, and that was only because of Violet Fern.

Even so, Luo Changwu was incredibly excited. Those disciples had all become Primals. He felt like he was in a dream. This fruit was absolutely heaven-defying.

Long Chen then saw Luo Bing and Luo Ning amongst them. He waved at them.

They were unaware that the fruit they had eaten had come from Long Chen. Luo Changwu classified this matter as the highest level secret of the Luo family.

Except for Luo Bing and Luo Ning, the other disciples would become the hidden power of the Luo family. They would not be allowed out of this underground space lightly.

If the rest of the world were to learn that the Luo family had produced six hundred Primals overnight, they would be in danger.

At this moment, Luo Changwu and Long Chen returned to the surface. However, Luo Changwu’s excitement had yet to fade. “Long Chen, you are the greatest benefactor of the Luo family!”

“You’re too courteous. I am the one who received great kindness from the Luo family,” said Long Chen with a smile. Of course he owed the Luo family. Without the Luo family, how could he have come to exist?

Long Chen continued, “The family head is no longer present, and we are surrounded by enemies. We cannot continue like this. As for myself, I cannot stay in the Luo family forever. I hope to resolve this problem soon so that I can return to the academy.”

“Resolve it? What do you mean?” asked Luo Changwu.

“I mean let us pluck out the Chu family by the roots and have them vanish from this world,” said Long Chen.

Luo Changwu jumped in shock. “That… that’s difficult. The Chu family has a half-step Immortal King. Furthermore, they worship Lord Brahma’s divine statue. If they use that faith energy, that expert’s power will rival an Immortal King. Furthermore, the Chu family has plenty of experts. It’s unknown just how many of them are being raised in secret. They are all Lord Brahma and Fallen Daynight’s followers. Once they draw on the power of their gods, their power soars. If we fight against them directly, we won’t have an advantage. Most importantly, father isn’t present. We don’t have the power to fight them like that. If their higher-ups were to learn that father is no longer present, it would be the Luo family that is in danger of being destroyed.”

The Luo family and the Chu family were mortal enemies. They all dreamed of eliminating the other. However, both sides were evenly matched. Without assurance, no one wanted to take the risk of attacking the other.

Long Chen shook his head. “This is no solution. The Chu family definitely has some secret methods for drawing the devil sea’s sea demons to the Ying Prefecture. With the Chu family also in a position to attack, the Luo family had no choice but to split their attention. You are in a constant tense state. Maintaining that state would make anyone weary over time. The other aspect is that as you lead the Ying Prefecture’s experts against the sea demons, although you won every time, there are always some losses. Such constant invasions will slowly grind you down. It doesn’t matter whether it is the Luo family or the other forces of the Ying Prefecture, they won’t be able to endure forever. If the birth of new geniuses doesn’t keep up with the losses, people will naturally get nervous. As time passes, their morale starts to fall. Then when the Chu family adds some more mental warfare, you will crack from the inside, and the Luo family will have no chance of turning things around.”

Luo Changwu sighed. “I’ve also thought of all of that. But there is no good way to deal with any of it. However, now we have six hundred more Primals. Once they grow up, there’s no need for them to even reach the Divine Lord realm. Just the peak of the Four Peak realm will be enough for us to trample the Chu family. It won’t take too long, maybe two or at most three years. We’ve been waiting for so many years; we’re not missing two or three.”

Long Chen bitterly smiled. This uncle of his was just as Luo Zichuan said. He was focused on defense, not offense. He always did things steadily, without taking risks. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

“Martial-uncle, my character is a bit like the family head’s. It can be said that in my life, if I’m not attacking, I’m on the road to attacking. Defense isn’t my specialty, but I do have a sharp nose for conflict. Don’t you feel that the Chu family’s mischief this time is very sudden?”

“You mean…?”

“Let’s think logically. The Chu family suffered setbacks in the High Firmament Academy. Their four Primal disciples were slain by me in the Nine Prefecture Convention. I used heavenly tribulation to kill so many of the Bloodkill Hall’s experts, and countless sects disbanded overnight as a result. Logically, now is not the time for them to make such a move. They should be quietly waiting and watching. Isn’t it unnatural for them to provoke the Luo family at this time?”

“Now that you say this, it is a bit strange,” said Luo Changwu, feeling startled.

Long Chen continued, “Thus, there must be something we don’t know. Although we don’t know what it is, my intuition tells me that the more we hesitate, the more danger there will be. Since you wish to be conservative, how about we launch a sneak attack as a probing blow to see the real situation in the Chu family?”

“What kind of probing blow?” asked Luo Changwu.

“I wish to know, how is Uncle Wen’s power compared to yours?” asked Long Chen.

“Big brother is a bit stronger than me. It is said that he has touched the barrier,” said Luo Changwu. Luo Changwen’s realm was a bit higher than his. But just touching the barrier didn’t mean that he could progress to the next step.

Touching the barrier was equivalent to seeing the path ahead. However, there was still a heavenly chasm blocking that path, and if it couldn’t be walked through, it still meant nothing in the end.

“Alright. It’ll take a few days for me to refine some medicinal pills. Once you and the other peak Primal Divine Lords of the Luo family consume these pills, you will all possess the power of half-step Immortal Kings,” said Long Chen.

“What medicinal pill is so amazing?” Luo Changwu jumped in shock.

Long Chen smiled. “You’ll know when the time comes. So, can we try this?”

“If you really can refine a pill like this, we definitely can try probing the truth about the Chu family,” said Luo Changwu. He was very moved. He was growing more and more shocked when it came to Long Chen.

“Alright. I’ll borrow the precious land of the family head to refine pills in. That’s no problem, right?”

“Naturally, it is no problem.”

“Then it’s decided. First tell uncle Wen about this, and wait for my good news,” said Long Chen. After saying this, he headed toward the Honing Heavenly Staircase.

Staring at his departing figure, Luo Changwu sighed deeply. Long Chen had truly stunned him. He was a very terrifying youngster. Fortunately, he was a friend of the Luo family.

After this, Long Chen smiled a bit sinisterly.

“What probing blow? Who has time to play with them? We’re going to play big.”

The pitiable Luo Changwu still had no idea that he had been conned by his nephew. In Long Chen’s eyes, there was no such thing as a probing blow. If he were to launch an attack, it would be to end things once and for all.
