Chapter 2741 Pill Flame Refines the Soul

After piercing the Heaven Executioner’s head with his finger, Long Chen pulled back his hand, dragging a fist-sized Yuan Spirit out. At the same time, flames soared within his hand, enveloping the Heaven Executioner’s Yuan Spirit.

“AHH!”

The Heaven Executioner’s Yuan Spirit screamed miserably. This was the most painful torture, but since the Heaven Executioner wasn’t an alchemist, he could never use this move.

Although the power of this pill flame was far inferior to Huo Linger’s power, it was enough when it came to tormenting people.

The Heaven Executioner’s Dantian had been crippled, and his physical body had been tortured by Lei Linger to its limit. If Long Chen wanted him to feel pain, Long Chen would have to let the Heaven Executioner rest and recover before further torture. However, he didn’t want to do that.

“There are ten levels to using pill flame to refine a soul. It is said that the highest level is so painful that it cannot be described with words. As the most skilled torturer of the divine families, I’ll trouble you to help me experience it. Hopefully, you will be able to describe it.” Long Chen smiled with his teeth, which gave off a cold glint, making him seem like a demon.

“No! Kill me!”

The pain of having the soul refined was unimaginable. The only reason that Long Chen had managed to endure the Heaven Executioner’s various tortures was because he had experienced the pain of having his soul ripped apart.

Back then, Meng Qi’s soul seed had been ruined by the Wind Soul Pavilion’s people, crippling her. Long Chen had then forcibly torn off a part of his soul and condensed it into a soul seed for her.

After experiencing the pain of his soul being ripped, the pain of his physical body was no longer so terrifying.

On the other hand, while the Heaven Executioner was a vicious person, he was only vicious to others. He had never had to test his viciousness on himself.

“AHH!”

Long Chen ignored the Heaven Executioner’s plea, and his flame soared, condensing into two lotuses. They began to grind against each other, one on top and one on the bottom. As the Heaven Executioner’s Yuan Spirit was being twisted and ground, his screams instantly rose to a new intensity.

When the flame grew stronger, his Yuan Spirit actually ignited and quickly showed signs of withering. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

As a result, Long Chen pulled back his flames. His Spiritual Strength then poured into the withered Yuan Spirit, causing it to recover.

“Not bad, you lasted an incense stick’s worth of time. We can progress to the third level,” said Long Chen.

“No, kill me! I beg you, kill me! Treat it as mercy, I beg you…!” The Heaven Executioner cried out tearfully. He had reached his breaking point. He had spent a lifetime torturing others but never had to endure any tortures himself. Hence, his endurance was even worse than an ordinary person’s. If Long Chen wasn’t controlling his power, he would have died.

Long Chen sneered. “You’ve done so much evil. Why should I have mercy on you? Did you have mercy on me when you tortured me? Did you have mercy when you stole my Spirit Root, Spirit Bone, and Spirit Blood? However, I’ll give you one chance. Answer my questions properly, and I’ll give you a quick death. If you hide anything from me, I guarantee that you’ll regret it.”

“Ask, ask!” cried out the Heaven Executioner. He didn’t even think about living and just wanted to end things. Death was his release.

“Has the battle truly started?”

“Yes, it’s already… AHH!”

The flames once more soared, and the Heaven Executioner screamed.

“You really are an idiot. Although your realm is higher than mine, my Spiritual Strength is a thousand times stronger than yours. Do you really think you can lie in front of me?” said Long Chen angrily. His soul was completely locked onto the Heaven Executioner’s soul. Any lies would be instantly sensed.

“I’ll tell you the truth! The battle hasn’t started! We’re still preparing! Stop!” shouted the Heaven Executioner.

Long Chen snorted and retracted his flames. After that, he sent some Spiritual Strength into the Heaven Executioner’s Yuan Spirit to avoid him accidentally dying.

When the Heaven Executioner had first told him that the battle had started, he had been worried, but then he suddenly felt that it didn’t make sense.

If the battle had really started, the divine families definitely wouldn’t kill him like this. They would at least drag him in front of the Martial Heaven Continent and kill him in front of everyone to shatter their confidence. That would be far more beneficial to their assault; they wouldn’t waste his life. Long Chen’s judgment was that the Heaven Executioner had said this to him on purpose, and now he personally admitted to it.

Now Long Chen was much more at ease. If the battle hadn’t started, then there was still time.

“What realm has Long Aotian’s cultivation base reached?” demanded Long Chen.

The Heaven Executioner had also said that when Long Aotian and the others became Sovereigns, they would immediately attack. If the battle hadn’t started, then they had yet to advance to that realm.

“He has reached the eleventh Heavenstage and is attempting to break through to the twelfth Heavenstage, the Emperor realm,” answered the Heaven Executioner.

“So he’s reached the Saint realm. He really is fast.” Long Chen’s heart shook. He suddenly asked, “How is Long Aotian’s cultivation advancing so quickly?”

“Because… Because the divine families have sacrificed all lifeforms in several of the minor worlds that they rule,” said the Heaven Executioner.

The divine families had several minor worlds under their control, and those minor worlds were filled with countless lifeforms. They were the sacrifices that the divine families had prepared for Long Aotian.

It wasn’t just Long Aotian. The Nine-Headed Lion, the Blood Fiend Devil Lord, the Alldevil Heavenwalker, and Ye Ming were doing the same. Ye Ming in particular had gone above and beyond.

He had even tricked the Corrupt God, betraying the latter and offering all the Corrupt path’s believers as sacrifices. Adding to the offerings that the Undying race had prepared for him, his cultivation speed was the fastest.

“They are all walking heretical paths. This isn’t the true path of a Sovereign. That’s why their past Sovereigns were never on the same level as the Martial Heaven Continent’s Sovereigns. The true Sovereigns obtained the approval of the world, and the world willingly gave all its power to them. It wasn’t forcibly snatched,” said the Eastern Wasteland Bell.

Long Chen nodded. These people definitely couldn’t compare to Sovereign Yun Shang and the others even once they became Sovereigns.

However, while this method of theirs was truly evil, sacrificing these countless lives did allow their cultivation speeds to soar to a frightening rate.

Now Long Chen understood why Sovereign Yun Shang had sneered disdainfully back then when Long Chen had asked him about gods. What kind of dogshit gods were these? Whatever gods were backing them were clearly wicked demons.

Faith? Protection? Bullshit. It was simply both sides using each other for whatever gains they could obtain.

“Tell me what happened back then. Why did you harm my family?” asked Long Chen, a vein throbbing on his forehead.
