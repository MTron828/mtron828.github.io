Chapter 2486 Chaotic Battle

An arrow shot out like lightning, reaching Feng Fei at almost the same time it left the string. A huge explosion of divine energy blocked Feng Fei.

“If you dare to interfere, don’t blame me for not caring about your gender.” Mo Nian appeared in the sky, staring coldly at Feng Fei.

Feng Fei was finally unable to remain seated. She wanted to save Zhao Ritian because she couldn’t allow him to die. That meant that Zhao Ritian had truly reached his end.

Mo Nian pulled back his bowstring. A giant whirlpool appeared behind him, filled with divine energy. His divine energy fluctuations were even more intense than those of a divine son or divine daughter. In the blink of an eye, Mo Nian entered his peak state.

“What powerful divine energy. It actually pulled in the Heavenly Daos.” Beitang Rushuang was startled. As a fellow bow expert, she saw that he walked a different path from her, but his power was truly great.

Feng Fei coldly snorted, “If I want to interfere, you won’t be able to stop me. I hope you don’t misjudge yourself.”

“What do you mean by misjudge myself? All I know is that if you try to interfere, I’ll kill you.”

Suddenly, a giant figure appeared in the whirlpool behind Mo Nian. It was identical to him and also held a bow.

However, this bow was so huge that it exceeded the realms of heaven and earth. There was a single arrow on it, an arrow reflecting the sun, moon, and stars. The world turned calm, as if waiting to be destroyed.

Feng Fei’s expression changed. She had underestimated Mo Nian. With him having made his move first, he truly possessed the ability to kill her.

Not everyone possessed the ability to instantly enter their peak state like Long Chen. Even Feng Fei was incapable of that. Most experts required at least three attacks to warm up before unleashing their peak power. With no warm-up, their own body wouldn’t be able to endure the sudden leap in power.

Feng Fei had been focused on taking the divine bones. Moreover, she hadn’t expected Zhao Ritian to lose, and she had especially not thought that he would end up in a state to be killed.

She hadn’t made any preparations to fight as a result, while Mo Nian was well aware of Long Chen’s character and knew that he would try to not just defeat Zhao Ritian, but kill him.

The reason Long Chen had been waiting for Mo Nian was to prevent Zhao Ritian from running and also to stop Feng Fei from interfering. Everything was within their calculations.

However, Zhao Ritian’s power had truly been terrifying. Despite that, Long Chen had still suppressed him. That made Mo Nian feel competitive. If at this time he was unable to block Feng Fei, he wouldn’t have the face to see Long Chen again.

Everyone’s expressions changed and they retreated. Just looking at Mo Nian’s arrow made them feel like their souls would dissipate. If this attack was unleashed, it was unknown what kind of consequences it would have.

“Mo Nian, you dare to act like this to senior Feng Fei? Don’t you think that’s too rude? I, Di Feng, am willing to accompany you instead.” Di Feng suddenly smiled. His manifestation burst into existence, and a blood-colored figure appeared within it, unleashing boundless Emperor might.

“This is the Blood Emperor’s aura. Did he not die?” This time, Mo Nian’s expression changed. He had inherited some memories of his ancestors and was familiar with this aura.

“Mo Nian, you traitor of the ancient family alliance, I’ll settle our enmities today.” Di Feng’s figure vanished. Following that, a wave of blood-colored qi erupted. From within this blood-colored wave came a giant hand that smashed toward Mo Nian.

In that instant, a spiritual and bloodline suppression crashed down, making everyone feel like they were being crushed. It felt like they were being pressured to kneel.

“What’s going on? This Emperor might is one hundred percent authentic. Did the Blood Emperor borrow Di Feng’s body to resurrect?!” Nangong Zuiyue and the others’ expressions changed.

This Emperor might made them feel pressure, both physically and spiritually. In this state, it was impossible for them to fight properly. Just what had happened to Di Feng?

It was no wonder that Di Feng had dared to challenge Mo Nian. He had come prepared.

Mo Nian’s fury soared. The palm crashing toward him gave him no choice but to counterattack.

“You’re asking for it!” roared Mo Nian. He knew that as soon as he turned his attention to Di Feng, he would be unable to stop Feng Fei. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

BOOM!

Mo Nian unleashed the arrow on the Heaven Swallowing Sun Hunting Bow, while the giant arrow in his manifestation followed, piercing into the hand.

The hand and arrows exploded at the same time. After that, a muffled bang came from within the sea of blood. It seemed that Di Feng had been injured.

The blood sea shuddered, and blood swords shot out of it at Mo Nian.

“Sorry Long Chen, there’s been a surprise. Once I kill him, I’ll come help you out.” Mo Nian was unable to ignore these blood swords. He actually charged into the blood sea, and explosions began to echo from within. The two of them began an intense fight, but it was impossible to see them within the blood sea.

Feng Fei instantly escaped Mo Nian’s lock and appeared in front of Long Chen. “Release Zhao Ritian, or don’t blame me for being merciless.”

“Why are you wasting time talking?! Get me out of here!” roared Zhao Ritian from within. His voice was hoarse and panicked because Long Chen’s flames were burning away his metal source. Seeing that Feng Fei wasn’t directly attacking, he grew even more panicked. His resentment spread from just Long Chen to Feng Fei.

“Release him? Impossible. Since he wants to kill me, he has to be prepared to be killed by me. Of course, you can attack me and try to save him. I’ll wait for you to attack me, that way I’ll have a reason to kill you as well,” said Long Chen, tightening his hold on Evilmoon. Killing intent blazed in his eyes.

He didn’t like Feng Fei. He might even hate her. He hated how arrogant she acted, as if all the world’s people had to obey her.

It was like in the eyes of the divine families, the experts of the Martial Heaven Continent were an inferior species that should crawl beneath their feet. If they rebelled, it would be a defiance of what was simply right, and they deserved the death penalty.

However, he had yet to have a true clash with Feng Fei. At this time though, if Feng Fei tried to stop him, there would be nothing to discuss. He would kill her.

“You’re too arrogant. Since you refuse to do things nicely, don’t blame me for bullying the weak.” Feng Fei also grew angry. She crossed her hands, and a phoenix cry rang out. A multicolored phoenix condensed in the air and shot at Long Chen.

In their last Spiritual Strength competition, the two of them had both been injured, so this time Feng Fei was prepared.

Her life soul beast was completely different from before. Soul energy shook the sky. It was unknown just how many times stronger it was from last time.

Feng Fei’s soul energy had vastly strengthened after reaching the fourth step of Netherpassage. Furthermore, she also had her own pride and didn’t want to take advantage of him. She competed with him in Spiritual Strength, one of his greatest strengths.

Long Chen raised his left hand. Spiritual Strength condensed into a giant shield just like in their last competition.

However, this time, Long Chen’s Spiritual Strength was like a vast sea shining brightly. Waves crashed against the shield.

When their two Spiritual Strengths crashed together, a ripple spread through the air that made every expert feel a sharp pain.

Even as they circulated their own Spiritual Strength to resist, they cried out. It felt like millions of needles were stabbing around in their heads, making them feel enough pain to not want to live.

When they recovered enough, they looked back up to see that Feng Fei’s phoenix was biting at the shield. The shield was being torn through and broken, but it was constantly repairing itself.

“Hurry up and kill him! I can’t last much longer!” roared Zhao Ritian. His aura was dropping rapidly. His body had been charred like firewood. It no longer had any luster. He had reached his limit, any longer and he would be burned to death.

“Your flame prison isn’t controlled by your soul.” Feng Fei suddenly realized that Long Chen’s Heaven Trapping Flame Prison wasn’t being supported by him. Otherwise, this shield he had summoned should have caused it to crumble, allowing Zhao Ritian to escape.

Feng Fei was unaware that it was Huo Linger controlling it. Even without Long Chen’s soul energy, it was very stable, enough to stop the weakened Zhao Ritian.

“Quick!” roared Zhao Ritian.

After that, no more sounds came from within.

A sword suddenly appeared in Feng Fei’s hand. It was unknown what material it was made of, but its body was the color of blood. After that, her manifestation shone behind her, and an ancient beast appeared. A fierce aura burst out of her. She slashed her sword at Long Chen.

Zhao Ritian was going to die, so she finally unleashed her full power, combining her spiritual attacks with physical attacks. Blood-colored light erupted in the sky.

BOOM!

Long Chen swung Evilmoon. The instant their weapons met, Long Chen’s body trembled and he coughed up a mouthful of blood.

With only a small portion of his spiritual yuan left, he was unable to stop Feng Fei at her full power.

Suddenly, the land began to shake. The ground that had been crushed and compacted began to swell back up. The dragon altar began to unleash dragon might, and the experts hiding on top of it were kicked out.

“What’s going on?!”

BANG!

The barrier of the altar exploded, and a wave of dragon might unfurled, sending the closest experts flying like meteors.

“The divine bones!”

Startled cries rang out. With the barrier’s destruction, the divine bones were exposed.

Long Chen looked at Zhao Ritian to the divine bones. Clenching his teeth, he gave up on Zhao Ritian and rushed toward the closest divine bone. Feng Fei’s expression changed.
