Chapter 3808 Junior City Lord

When did the exterior of Silver Moon City require an inspection to pass through? Long Chen frowned.

Eighteen giant siege crossbows were pointed at their flying boat. At the same time, countless runes on the city gates lit up. Their grand formation was activated.

“It’s the Sacred Pill Hall’s people,” said Guo Ran darkly.

“The Sacred Pill Hall is control of Silver Moon City? To dare to do inspections in front of Silver Moon City, I didn’t expect this,” said Mo Nian with surprise.

It had to be known that Silver Moon City was a human settlement. Although they did not forbid other races from entering, within their jurisdiction, no one dared to cause trouble, or it would be viewed as trampling over Silver Moon City’s dignity.

To set up inspections right in front of the city, that was either not placing Silver Moon City in their eyes or was done with the approval of Silver Moon City.

However, based on the fact that some of these people were wearing robes of Silver Moon City, it could be seen that it was the latter.

“Whoever is inside the flying boat, come down and submit to inspection, or bear the consequences!” shouted a Divine Venerate sternly.

“Bear the consequences? I think I’ll do that. How can I help you?” Long Chen snorted and walked out.

When Long Chen, Mo Nian, and the others came out, that Divine Venerate’s expression completely changed. He immediately gestured to lock down the formation.

“If I, Long Chen, wish to enter the city, do you think that trash like you can block me?” Long Chen looked at the group of dozens of Divine Venerates and an army of Immortal King disciples. He sneered.

“Long Chen! The Sacred Pill Hall, Bloodkill Hall, Nine Underworld Hall, and devil race all have an arrest warrant for you! Silver Moon City does not welcome you! Scram!”

Just then, a Supreme Immortal King walked out of the crowd, and the mark of Silver Moon City blazed on his chest brightly. He was handsome, but so arrogant it was like he looked down on everyone else.

“Silver Moon City is a human settlement. When did it become other people’s dog? Is the Sacred Pill Hall your daddy? Why are you so obedient?” asked Long Chen disdainfully.

“How brazen! Do you know who I am?!” shouted the man with the silver moon robes.

“You can be whoever you want to be. I’m going into the city, and I don’t feel like talking to you. If you don’t want to die, get out of the way. I know you’ve alerted the others and they’re coming quickly. But if you are thinking of blocking my way, first, you won’t prevail, and second, you’ll pay a price that will be difficult to bear,” said Long Chen coldly.

With just this brief conversation, Long Chen knew that these fellows before him were in collusion with Silver Moon City to stall him outside the city. However, they did not have the power to mobilize the entire city’s forces against him.

All they wanted was to stall him until the real experts came. Then they could directly kill him outside the city without affecting the dignity of Silver Moon City.

“Arrogant brat! I see that you’re courting death! I am the city lord’s thirteenth son! Today, if you don’t kneel and kowtow, don’t even think about leaving alive!” That man shouted furiously and pointed his sword at Long Chen.

“Boss, don’t kill a chicken with a divine blade. I, Guo Ran, am willing to lower myself to deal with him.” Guo Ran immediately stepped forward.

This fellow with the silver moon robes might be a Supreme heavenly genius, but his aura wasn’t powerful. In fact, it was a bit flimsy. He was clearly someone who had been born with decent talent, but he never worked to excavate his full potential. Hence, he hadn’t experienced many life-and-death battles. Such a figure was someone that even Guo Ran could slay with a single blow.

“Courting death!”

Seeing Long Chen ignore him and a fellow with an even weaker aura than him jump out, that man was infuriated. He thought that he was being insulted intentionally, so he directly attacked.

However, before he could even get to them, an old fellow from the Sacred Pill Hall grabbed him. That was someone who had personally witnessed Long Chen and the others fighting. He was profoundly aware that every single one of the five people before him was a peak expert.

This junior city lord was actually trying to throw himself into death’s embrace. If he succeeded, no one would be able to save him.

“Are you idiots?! What are you stopping me for?! You cowards, you don’t dare to do anything yourself, so let me go! I’ll kill them all!” The junior city lord was enraged at being stopped. He thought that these people’s heads were broken.

“Everyone, this is Silver Moon City, and this is the city lord’s son. The city lord is in seclusion, so the junior city lord has the authority to refuse entry to others. Since he does not permit you inside, please leave. Otherwise, the killing formation will be activated, and not a single one of you will be able to leave,” said an elder from Silver Moon City.

Clearly, they weren’t thinking of attacking Long Chen, nor did they want to use Silver Moon City’s killing formation. All they wanted was to prevent him from entering the city.

“If you don’t want me to go in, fine. Tell my brothers inside the city to leave with the others,” said Long Chen lightly.

“You’re giving me orders? Who do you think you are?! Scram or die!” roared another elder of Silver Moon City impatiently.

As a result, an arrow pierced his head, and he just watched as it struck him. It was as if he didn’t sense the danger descending.

Shockingly, the one to attack was Guo Ran. His arrow was silent and came without any warning. That person didn’t even know who the attacker was as he died.

“We really gave you too much face. Since you want to die, there’s no need to stand on courtesy.” Long Chen snorted and gestured to attack.

As soon as he gestured, Guo Ran charged out with his Devil Dragon Battle Armor, and his saber swept through the air, enveloping over ten Divine Venerates. They were all blown back.

“You dare to attack?! Activate the grand formation and kill-!”

Pow!

That junior city lord wasn’t even done giving orders before he was slapped in the face by Long Chen. Long Chen had done his best to hold back, but he still almost killed this junior city lord with this slap.

Long Chen hadn’t expected there to be such a weak Supreme expert in this world. The latter had no speed or power. Even worse, he didn’t have any combat experience. He didn’t even summon any instinctive energy to protect himself as Long Chen’s slap struck him.

He collapsed on the ground like porcelain. Although he didn’t explode, cracks covered his body as if he was going to shatter apart at any moment.

At this moment, Xia Chen and Yue Xiaoqian also attacked. Those experts had no ability to resist. They were almost instantly wiped out. Whether it was the Sacred Pill Hall’s experts or Silver Moon City’s experts, they were wiped out of existence. As for Mo Nian, he clasped his hands behind his back. He didn’t even have a desire to fight.

Just then, all of Silver Moon City rumbled, and endless divine might caused the world to change color. Millions of runic arrows then condensed on top of the city walls, pointing at Long Chen and the others.Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Open the city gates, or your junior city lord will die without a corpse.”

In the face of this grand killing formation, Long Chen simply grabbed the junior city lord and walked to the gates.
