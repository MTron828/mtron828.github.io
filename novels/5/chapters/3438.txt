Chapter 3427 Heavenly Tribulation Descends

The eye of the tribulation clouds was pointed right at Long Chen. This was his heavenly tribulation.

“How can this be?! Even when we underwent tribulation, we didn’t cause such a terrifying phenomenon!” cried a World King with a quivering voice.

This was an absolutely terrifying heavenly tribulation. Just in terms of range, it had eclipsed a World King’s tribulation. This completely toppled their current understanding.

“It is said that the stronger the heavenly tribulation, the stronger the target is. Can it be that this Long Chen is so powerful?”

No one answered him. Well, no one could answer. Even though they were World Kings, they had never seen such a thing.

Furthermore, the demonic beasts rarely read through ancient tomes. Most of their knowledge came from their memories. The important information they needed was passed down through inheritances, but those inheritances mostly pertained only to their races.

Thus, their knowledge was definitely more limited than others. Even though they were prideful, they had to admit that they were lacking compared to the human race in terms of learning.

Thus, they looked toward the Sacred Pill Hall’s people, wanting to find the answer on their faces. However, the hall master’s expression was also one of shock, no different than theirs. Even he had never seen such a terrifying heavenly tribulation.

Now, the tribulation clouds began to condense. As the black clouds clumped together, a terrifying pressure came crashing down. Even through the formation, these people could sense it. That aura made even World Kings quiver.

This heavenly tribulation contained endless destructive power, which was the will of the Heavenly Daos. No one could resist it. It was the might of the heavens that had to be obeyed.

Multicolored lights appeared within the black clouds once they condensed. Those were bolts of lightning. They were like lightning dragons swimming within the clouds.Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

All the experts undergoing tribulation within the Divine Lord Immortal Realm stared up in horror at those tribulation clouds. The might of this heavenly tribulation made them smell the scent of death.

At this moment, space shuddered and the eighth prince came charging back. He had been sent flying by Long Chen and smashed into the earth. So, by the time he came back out, the skies had changed color.

As a result, the eighth prince’s fury suddenly vanished, replaced with confused perplexion. He stared up at the black clouds. He had been intending on attacking Long Chen, but the shock of seeing those black clouds made him forget what he was doing.

He was shocked to find that his own tribulation clouds had been devoured. The lightning falling on him gradually faded until there was nothing left.

Wu Ying and the others were also dumbfounded. They looked from those black clouds to the icy Long Chen. They didn’t know what had just happened.

“Brat, what are you doing?!” roared Wu Ying uneasily.

“What am I doing? Are you blind? I’m undergoing tribulation. You frogs at the bottom of a well, you dare to look down on the human race?” Long Chen clasped his hands behind his back and sneered at them. “You fools, I came to the Integral Heaven Star-Field just to cause trouble for the Sacred Pill Hall. But you fools just had to repeatedly provoke and enrage me. Since you wish to die so badly, I will accomplish your goals for you.”

Following that, the black clouds quivered and multicolored swords came raining down, filling this entire world.

“AHH!”

Some experts dodged the swords, which then stabbed into the earth, leaving bottomless holes. However, some were incapable of dodging them and were struck. Their bodies instantly exploded on contact with the swords. They screamed and were left with only Yuan Spirits.

Having lost their bodies, their Yuan Spirits were incapable of dodging for much longer either before being blown apart.

The torrent of swords filled the entire Divine Lord Immortal Realm. This place instantly became a land of death. It was hell on earth.

“AHH!”

“NO!”

“I don’t want to die!”

Countless experts cried out in terror. They wanted to flee, but the lightning tribulation was endless. Where were they supposed to run to?

Although the tribulation clouds had condensed a bit, they still covered the majority of the Divine Lord Immortal Realm. The spiritual qi was more abundant here in the core, which was why everyone was gathered here. As a result, all of them were under the cover of Long Chen’s heavenly tribulation.

In the panic, it was unknown how many experts were slain by the torrent of swords. As for some experts, after a moment of panic, they quickly recovered their wits and started to fight the lightning swords. When they broke the swords apart, multicolored lightning runes appeared.

When they absorbed those runes, they were pleasantly surprised to find that the Heavenly Dao energy contained within these lightning runes was many times stronger than the lightning runes from their own tribulations.

After absorbing this lightning, their physical bodies rapidly strengthened. Even their Spiritual Strength improved. So, some of the stronger people began to spread out, trying to absorb more of the lightning.

“So that’s the case. Due to absorbing too many Heavenly Dao runes, you ended up summoning such a tribulation. This heavenly tribulation contains endless Heavenly Dao energy that can nourish the body and soul. It’s over ten times stronger than an ordinary heavenly tribulation. It’s too bad that you’re just a human. How much could you possibly absorb? Ah, fine, I won’t kill you for now. Once the heavenly tribulation is over, I’ll take your life.” The eighth prince stood in the air, allowing the lightning to strike his body. It simply shattered on contact with him and was absorbed. He smiled in delight, seemingly having seen through everything.

It wasn’t just the eighth prince. Other experts also did the same thing. The lightning swords might be powerful, but these experts were the peak heavenly geniuses of their respective races. They also had the bodies of demonic beasts. For these peak heavenly geniuses, lightning of this level was unable to harm them.

After blocking the destructive power of the lightning, pure thunderforce would enter their bodies, giving them a pleasant surprise.

At this time, the experts watching heard the eighth prince’s ‘smart’ deduction. If this unprecedented heavenly tribulation was related to the world core, then this effect was understandable.

However, the hall master didn’t quite believe that. He didn’t think that this matter was so simple. Furthermore, he was starting to get a bad feeling.

Unfortunately for him, now that the Divine Lord Immortal Realm was linked to the core of the star-field, even their Sacred Pill Hall could not interfere. Otherwise, if the slightest bit of the core’s power leaked, the entire Auspicious Cloud Domain might be instantly destroyed, and all living creatures on it would be wiped out of existence. Hence, all he could do was watch.

“I didn’t expect there to be such a benefit. Then let him continue struggling at death’s door for a while.”

Within the Divine Lord Immortal Realm, Wu Ying was also smiling as she sensed the lightning nourishing her body. This was a very rare opportunity.

If they killed Long Chen, then the heavenly tribulation might vanish. Thus, they were no longer in a rush to move.

Long Chen sneered. A lightning rune slowly faded on his arm, silently merging into the giant heavenly tribulation.

As for Lei Yuner, she actually chose to stealthily slip out of the core region and get further away.
