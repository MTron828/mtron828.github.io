Chapter 4521 I’m Your Daddy

Something resembling a boxing glove covered the Saint’s hand, featuring longan-sized human skulls on its joints.

This strange weapon emitted terrifying auras from the five skulls. When Long Chen’s saber collided with the glove, a vision of countless ghouls wailing for their lives flooded his mind.

Given the robustness of Long Chen’s Spiritual Strength, it was clear that this corrupt weapon had accumulated countless resentful spirits to produce such an effect on him.

Wearing the strange glove, the Saint unleashed a furious tempest of attacks, and in response, Long Chen repeatedly swung his blood-colored saber. However, the Saint managed to drive him backward.

Long Chen knew that the Saint was trying to force him away from the medicinal field. In this location, the Saint exercised restraint to avoid damaging the precious plants. However, Long Chen had the same objective in mind. He already considered this medicinal field his own, and if he could just delay the Saint, the Earth Cauldron could proceed to gather the medicinal plants.

Long Chen continued to retreat, caving in under the sharpness of the Saint’s attacks and his explosive pressure.

At a certain distance, a barrier that covered the medicinal field suddenly appeared. At this time, the Saint roared, “Damn thief, hand over your life!”

Having forced Long Chen out of the barrier, the Saint no longer held back. When his manifestation materialized, a sinister air swirled around him, causing him to look like he was possessed by a devil. When he unleashed his fist this time, its force was a hundred times greater than before.

“Seven Star Battle Armor!”

Long Chen let out a roar, causing his divine ring to quiver. At the same time, seven stars illuminated the world, gradually turning the stars in the sky more distinct. In just a moment, the world beneath transformed into an expanse covered in a starry sky.

BOOM!

Long Chen’s saber cleaved into the Saint’s glove, unleashing an immense power that reverberated through the world. It was a clash of sheer force.

“What?!”

The Saint was sent reeling back, his expression marked by disbelief, and his arm rendered numb from the impact.

“Just who are you?!” roared the Saint.

“I’m your daddy!” responded Long Chen. He then raised his saber toward the sky.

Stars swirled in the manifestation behind Long Chen. His arm looked as if it were made of stars, and starlight slowly flowed into his saber.

The stars in the sky started to flicker rapidly as starlight descended, converging onto the saber.

Long Chen’s saber seemed to serve as a link between his manifestation and the astral energy above the nine heavens, constantly accumulating more power.

The Saint’s expression underwent a complete transformation, shifting from astonishment to sheer disbelief. Although Long Chen’s saber was still gathering power, its aura already conveyed the scent of death.

“Heavenly Corrupt Grand Formation, Corrupt Blood Heavenly Ignition!” Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

The Saint suddenly spat blood onto his glove, causing the five skulls to shriek mournfully. It resembled the sound of millions of resentful spirits being unleashed.

Five rays of evil light coalesced from his glove, causing the very fabric of heaven and earth to tremble. The Saint was using his own essence blood to unleash the full power of his Saint weapon.

Long Chen’s expression was solemn. At this moment, he sensed another aspect of the Nine Star Hegemon Body Art. It was a mysterious feeling that he couldn’t completely grasp, and for some reason, he kept feeling like he was lacking a certain power.

“Is this saber not strong enough? Is it because it can’t contain more power?”

Just then, the Saint’s attack came, so Long Chen had no time to ponder anymore. He swung his saber down, unleashing all his accumulated astral energy.

BOOM!

It was like the very cosmos had exploded. Long Chen heard a miserable scream from the Saint and saw half of his body obliterated. Long Chen’s attack was absolutely terrifying, almost killing the Saint in a slash.

At this moment, Long Chen’s saber transformed into a streak of light that accurately pierced the Saint’s head. After that, the saber rumbled again, and the marks of the fiendish faces on it lit up. Its aura once more grew explosively.

Long Chen’s heart shook. This weapon might only be half-complete, but it already had a sinister power to devour souls.

When it devoured the souls of those Eternal experts, its aura was activated, but it didn’t undergo too much of a change. However, absorbing the Saint’s soul actually caused one of the fiend faces on it to light up.

These fiend faces were intricately inscribed all over the saber. Some were near the edge of the blade, and the sawtoothed edge resembled their teeth.

Long Chen looked at it more closely. There were nine hundred and ninety-nine faces on it, and killing one Saint caused one to light up. Did that mean that he needed to kill nine hundred and ninety-nine Saints to light them all up?

“This is a divine weapon of the Asura race, so the method for controlling it definitely lies in their hands,” murmured Long Chen. However, the Asura race definitely wouldn’t divulge these secrets to outsiders.

In any case, this weapon was capable of unleashing Long Chen’s astral energy without exploding, and that already satisfied him.

With this weapon, he could fully unleash his power. Without it, defeating a Saint would be much more difficult, and killing them would be next to impossible. After all, a Saint was not a devil beast. If they couldn’t win, they’d run.

At this time, a bronze cauldron pierced through the barrier and appeared in front of Long Chen.

“I’m done! Let’s go!” exclaimed the Earth Cauldron.

Hearing this, Long Chen was delighted with its speed. He had even been thinking about how to draw everyone’s attention onto him instead of the medicinal field.

Just then, the land trembled, and multiple terrifying auras rose.

“They have Saints in seclusion!”

Long Chen immediately spread his Kunpeng wings and shot away.

“Where do you think you’re going?!”

Six terrifying auras came over as they attacked Long Chen at the same time.

However, Long Chen had made the first move, so even these Saints couldn’t catch him for a while. When he reached the formation disc he had set up, he instantly activated it.

BOOM!

Their six attacks shattered the mountain, but Long Chen had disappeared.

When those Saints returned to the medicinal field, they found that all the precious plants had vanished and not even a single one remained. Immediately, all of them coughed up blood from rage.

“Reporting, the sect sent word that the invader Long Chen has just launched an attack on the Saint Item Palace! The sect master implores you to be careful...”

A messenger brought a missive from the sect. However, he noticed everyone’s grim expressions halfway through his report, and his heart sank.
