Chapter 1971 Heavenly Tribulation Finds Its Target

There was no change in the sky, but the barrier that was enveloping Heavenly Fate Island was starting to crack.

“But… this is impossible!”

The Unfettered Allseer’s expression completely changed. Even a Netherpassage expert’s tribulation would be blocked off in this special location. That was not just bragging. It was truly the case, with multiple examples in history.

Even the tribulations of an even higher realm could be screened off, so the Unfettered Allseer had felt complete disdain for Long Chen’s actions.

However, although there were no clouds, although there were no signs of heavenly tribulation, the barrier was starting to break.

Suddenly, Long Chen let out a roar at the sky. His divine ring spun behind him, and light erupted out of his eyes.

BOOM!

In front of countless experts’ shocked gazes, Heavenly Fate Island’s grand formation shattered.

At the same time as the formation shattered, the sky rumbled and a streak of lightning appeared in the air, coiling into a giant lightning ring.

Every single person present, regardless of cultivation base, felt an extreme sense of danger. The might of the heavens enveloped them.

“It really is a tribulation of legends. But Long Chen is just a mortal. How is he supposed to pass this tribulation?”

Daoist Heavenly Feather slowly stood up and began to walk away, muttering to herself. Seeing this, Ye Zhiqiu hastily followed, holding her arm.

“Master…” Ye Zhiqiu was befuddled.

“You should get further away. This heavenly tribulation is very dangerous. It’s not something a human can endure,” said Daoist Heavenly Feather.

“It’s not something a human can endure? Then who can endure it?” asked Ye Zhiqiu.

“A monster.”

Daoist Heavenly Feather showed a smile that was not a smile and walked out of Heavenly Fate Island.

Yu Xiaoyun, Xie Wentian, Peng Wanli, Di Long, and the others also rushed away. Although they had been shocked by this sight, they hadn’t thought about leaving. But the fact that Daoist Heavenly Feather would walk away gave them a bad feeling.

Suddenly, a pillar of lightning crashed down from the center of the lightning ring, attacking Long Chen. Lightning exploding, filling the sky with blinding light. 

The old man and the others had already left. Long Chen’s heavenly tribulation was so terrifying that the pressure it exuded even before descending was enough to make them feel ice-cold.

“Curious. Why does it seem that this attack has no power behind it?”

The strange thing was that although this attack seemed like a furious attack intent on killing him in one blow, it was more like a firework. Although there was brilliant light, it didn’t have much power. Even an ordinary Life Star expert would have been able to block it.

“This attack was just to create a mark, so it had no power,” said Daoist Heavenly Feather.

“A mark?”

Everyone was dumbfounded. Only now did Qu Jianying bring the Martial Heaven Alliance’s experts to greet Daoist Heavenly Feather. The previous situation hadn’t been appropriate for her to do so, as it would have felt like she was trying to pull her onto her side. Now everyone was standing together as they retreated from Heavenly Fate Island.

“Senior, do you know the origin of Long Chen’s heavenly tribulation?” probed Qu Jianying. Daoist Heavenly Feather seemed amicable enough and didn’t seem to discriminate against anybody.

“I know a bit. However, I’m not sure about all of it, so let’s just keep watching. This heavenly tribulation exists only in legend,” said Daoist Heavenly Feather.

At this moment, the sky darkened, and tribulation clouds covered the sky. It was like the world had fallen into eternal night, into endless death.

It looked like the end of the world. Just as people were terrified for their lives, a pillar of light lit up this dark world. It landed at the center of the Heavenly Fate Platform, right on Long Chen.

Within the darkness, the only light was that pillar. It was like Long Chen was the only one in this world. Lightning runes began to appear around Long Chen, making him appear godly.

“Even the heavens are helping him show off… That’s definitely unprecedented. I, Mo Nian… have to admit my defeat.” Mo Nian sighed. This was something that he would never be able to surpass.

Long Chen looked up at the sky, his eyes calm as water. He had no thoughts of showing off because he knew that this would be his most difficult tribulation yet. He could already feel a sensation of death enveloping him.

The sky suddenly exploded. The light spread, covering a wide area of Heavenly Fate Island.

The Unfettered Allseer’s expression immediately sank. Such a terrifying heavenly tribulation was something he had never seen. If he allowed it to continue, Heavenly Fate Island would be turned into ruins.

“Kill him! Don’t let him undergo tribulation!”

Four young disciples immediately stood up amongst the people of Heavenly Fate Island. Shockingly, their auras were not inferior to True Immortal Jiaoqi and the others.

“The real four Fate Princes have finally come out.” Qu Jianying narrowed her eyes. Although it was a secret that Heavenly Fate Island had a deputy for each Fate Prince, she was still aware of it. 

The four Fate Princes pointed their rulers at Long Chen. The runes on their rulers lit up, forming a strange formation. It seemed like the four of them had a special combination attack.

However, Huo Lieyun, Di Feng, Xie Luo, Gui Can, as well as Ming Jie’s replacement, Yan Wei, also flew out, attacking Long Chen at the same time. This was their one chance to get revenge, as well as to establish their own superiority over the others.

True Immortal Jiaoqi roared, and a nine-colored streak of light flew through the air. He was the fastest with the Qilin War Chariot.

“Long Chen, face your death!” Wielding his halberd, True Immortal Jiaoqi unleashed a vicious attack. At the same time, a ray of divine light shot out from his celestial horse, as well as the Qilin War Chariot. He wanted to kill Long Chen with this attack.

As long as Long Chen was killed, the heavenly tribulation would disappear, so they weren’t worried. As for the other experts, they wished to kill Long Chen as well, but they didn’t have the confidence to compete with them, so they just watched.

“This horse isn’t bad. It should have quite a bit of meat.” Long Chen sneered and raised his saber. However, he didn’t slash it toward True Immortal Jiaoqi. Instead, he slashed it at the sky.

BOOM!

His saber tore through the sky, a giant cut appearing.

“He dares to attack his heavenly tribulation?!”

People were appalled by this action. Wasn’t this suicide? Perhaps suicidal actions were common for Long Chen, but it was shocking to others. Any disrespect to the Heavenly Daos during a heavenly tribulation would cause the tribulation to become a terrifying punishment.

Lightning poured out of the tear in the sky, surging down like a waterfall. The sound of rushing thunder boomed.

“That’s divine lightning!”

BOOM!

Just at this moment, True Immortal Jiaoqi arrived. However, the nine-colored celestial horse let out a mournful cry and hastily retreated.

As for the Qilin War Chariot’s attack, due to the celestial horse retreating, its attack also missed.

Only True Immortal Jiaoqi charged through the lightning waterfall. But as he passed through the thick waterfall, his expression changed. The torrent of lightning was wearing away his power. His attack was down to seventy percent of its original force.Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

The lightning stung his eyes. Before his vision cleared, a hand slapped across his face.

True Immortal Jiaoqi went flying. He smashed through the lightning waterfall and into the Heavenly Fate Platform.

He tumbled against the platform several times. That platform was even more durable than divine items, but many cracks appeared in it now. In the end, he slammed into one of its stone pillars before stopping.

People looked at True Immortal Jiaoqi with shock. He had been handled easily by a slap from Long Chen. It was like he had beaten a child. Was Long Chen really so powerful?

That was True Immortal Jiaoqi he had just handled! Someone at the fifth Heavenstage of Life Star! Now, Long Chen’s palm lines had been imprinted onto his face.

True Immortal Jiaoqi let out a furious roar and charged forward once more.

“Idiot, have you been struck stupid? You’re going in the wrong direction,” sneered Mo Nian.

Stars were still spinning in True Immortal Jiaoqi’s eyes. He had actually charged in the opposite direction of Long Chen.

In the face of the amazed gazes of the Martial Heaven Continent’s experts, he almost went insane. He turned around, charging back toward Long Chen.

As for his horse, it was terrified of the lightning and was already far away, attacking Long Chen from a distance.

At this time, Huo Lieyun, Di Feng, Xie Luo, Gui Can, Yan Wei, and the others arrived, charging through the wild lightning waterfall.

Just as that moment, the sky exploded. A torrent of lightning poured down.
