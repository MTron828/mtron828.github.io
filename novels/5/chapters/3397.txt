Chapter 3386 Wu Tian

This large bald man wore blood-colored armor and had a blood-colored spear on his back. He had a third vertical eye. When it blinked, lightning runes flashed. The power to destroy heaven and earth was contained within it.

On each of his shoulder pads, there was a sinister face, and they looked like heads. Standing there, he seemed to be the ruler of the Netherworld. Despite standing on the same level as him, Long Chen had a feeling as if he was looking far up at a deity.

This person was far too powerful, so powerful that it seemed like a single thought from him could kill Long Chen, as if a single thought could destroy the heavens. Long Chen had never seen such a terrifying existence before.

Just being looked at by him, Long Chen felt incredibly weak. He had never felt so weak before. It was like an ant facing a dragon. That was how big the difference was.

“I’m sure that to yourself, this little bit of time is nothing more than a wave of a finger!” said Long Chen.

The bald man shook his head. “That is incorrect. While I was trapped in that damnable place, I have long since forgotten the concept of time. But after escaping, it’s different. I, Wu Tian, have never owed anyone any favors in this lifetime. So, I won’t be able to rest in peace if I don’t return this favor. Ever since escaping my prison, there have only been two thoughts on my mind. One is revenge, and the other one is to repay this favor. Although you did it inadvertently, I still owe you a huge debt. Speak. What do you desire? As long as you say it, I, Wu Tian, will help you accomplish it even if it costs me my life.”

This person who called himself Wu Tian was precisely the Heavenly King. He was also the Three-Headed Heaven Devouring Beast that Long Chen had released after stealing the door knobs of the Gates of Hell.

This terrifying expert said that he would help Long Chen accomplish his heart’s desire. Long Chen instantly had a thought. What if he had Wu Tian help him kill Lord Brahma?

However, just as that thought rose, it was crushed by his next thought. Lord Brahma was the one who had caused the Pill Fairy’s death and also the deaths of all those people in the Martial Heaven Continent. This enmity could not be avenged by others, not while he could do it himself. If he let someone else do it, would he still be a man? Long Chen’s pride refused to allow him to do such a thing.

After thinking about it, he simply shook his head. “Right now, I don’t need anything that big. If you feel like you owe me a debt, you can simply send me back to the immortal world. Then neither of us will owe the other anything.”

“Are you looking down on me? What a trifling matter. How can it cancel out my debt? Do you want to turn me into the laughingstock of the Netherworld?!” Wu Tian’s expression sank.

Following his shout, the clouds in the sky changed color and lightning boomed. The originally clear sky instantly turned dark and gloomy. It was as if the very heavens were about to collapse. After that, the ten thousand Daos rumbled as if the entire world was angered, and an explosive pressure crashed down. As a result, all the lifeforms of the Netherworld, regardless of cultivation base, instantly knelt on the ground, shaking.

The stone bricks beneath Long Chen’s feet shattered. As for Long Chen, he felt a powerful current crashing down on him to the point that his spine was about to break. He was being made to kneel just like those other lifeforms.

This terrifying pressure made him roar, “Is whether or not you’re turned into a laughingstock my damn business?! I can handle my own affairs, and I don’t need your help!”

This Wu Tian was completely unreasonable. He actually turned hostile faster than the flipping of a page, using his pressure to try and make Long Chen kneel. Long Chen’s fury instantly exploded. Who cared about his status? He directly cursed the other party.

“If you don’t ask for something, my heart won’t be at ease, and I won’t be able to sleep. It’s even worse than being trapped in that Netherpassage world. No matter what, you must ask me for something today!” Wu Tian also roared, his voice causing the stars in the sky to quiver.

Long Chen felt like all the stars of the heavens were pressing down on him. But he knew that this was a misperception. This was purely Wu Tian’s will.

Wu Tian’s will was the will of this world. Here, he was the master of the Heavenly Daos, the lord of the star-field. All beings had to listen to him.Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Long Chen’s fury rose. This fellow actually used such a method to suppress him, making him submit. This was practically repaying his favor with enmity.

BOOM!

The ground beneath Long Chen’s foot then collapsed. Cracks were spreading in every direction, even beyond the horizon. But the others didn’t even dare to look. They were still quivering on the ground. Only Long Chen alone stood facing Wu Tian. Although he had a splitting headache, although his soul was in danger of crumbling, he ultimately glared back at Wu Tian fearlessly.

Spatial cracks appeared around Long Chen. Those were the result of Long Chen’s will clashing with Wu Tian’s. It was affecting the Heavenly Daos. After a while, Long Chen’s vision started to turn dark. Just as he thought that he was about to die, that immense pressure vanished.

With the pressure gone, he almost collapsed on the ground. But a hand caught him and kept him steady. It was Wu Tian.

“Hahaha!” Wu Tian laughed, his voice like thunder. He patted Long Chen’s shoulder. “Good brother, starting today, you are my brother, Wu Tian’s brother! Let’s go. Have a drink with your big brother.”

Long Chen’s head was shaken just by the sound of his laughter. Adding on how his mind was still unclear from clashing so intensely against Wu Tian’s will, he didn’t even know how he was dragged away.

By the time he had recovered his wits slightly, he found himself in a glorious palace. But within this giant palace, only he and Wu Tian were present.

Once the two of them sat down, other experts came in, bringing delicacies and wine. After the food and drink were placed on the table, Wu Tian waved his hand, and those experts all left.

“Brother, I was rude to you just now. This drink is raised for you with respect, and you can take it as my apology. Don’t blame your big brother.” Wu Tian poured out a bowl of golden wine and offered it to Long Chen. He raised his own bowl of wine with his other hand.

Long Chen was still befuddled and looked at Wu Tian oddly. Had he been imprisoned for so long that his head had stopped functioning properly?

However, seeing his sincere expression, Long Chen didn’t say anything. He simply raised his bowl of wine and drank it.

As a result, as soon as this wine reached his stomach, steam exploded out of his eyes, nose, and ears. Tears and mucus dripped from his face altogether.

Long Chen felt like he had just drunk lava. That lava exploded within his stomach, and its energy charged out of his orifices. He felt his nasal cavity open in all directions.

“Hahaha!”

Wu Tian laughed once more. Long Chen knew that he had been conned.

“Are you toying with me!?” raged Long Chen, lifting the table and smashing it at Wu Tian. However, the table simply crumbled into dust before it even reached Wu Tian.

“Hahaha, this temper is good. You have guts. Only like this are you qualified to be my brother.” Wu Tian laughed delightedly.

However, after smashing the table, Long Chen realized that all the side effects of resisting Wu Tian’s will had vanished after that drink. He realized that this wine truly did come with good intentions, so he was slightly embarrassed.
