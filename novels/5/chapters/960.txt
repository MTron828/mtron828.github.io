Chapter 961 Fury Soars Into the Heavens

Translator: BornToBe

Looking at Lu Minghan’s icy expression, Long Chen instantly understood what was going on.

“What? Are you in such a hurry? Soft tactics don’t work, so you’re trying some hard ones? To trick me by pretending to be the sect master, are you trying to interrogate me?” said Long Chen.

Lu Minghan coldly said, “Long Chen, you are a disciple of the Xuantian Dao Sect. It was the Xuantian Dao Sect that raised you. If you don’t even know how to repay kindness, how are you any different from an animal?”

Long Chen sneered, “Don’t put it so sanctimoniously. All you want is my yuan spirit stones. Well, let me tell you the truth, I don’t have any yuan spirit stones.”

“Do you think I’m so easy to fool?” snorted Lu Minghan.

“Whether you believe it or not, I don’t care. Furthermore, what’s mine is mine. Don’t use the name of ethics to extort me. Who do you think you are? If I owe the Xuantian Dao Sect, then the ones I owe are Ling Yunzi, Shui Wuhen, and Ouyang Qiuyu. As for you? You only came here to get some benefits. Are you looking to raise your merit to the sect to get promoted? Not a bad plan,” said Long Chen disdainfully.

“Long Chen, I’m only going to ask once again. We aren’t greedy for your yuan spirit stones; we are doing this entirely for your own good. If you hand over your yuan spirit stones, the sect will help protect them for you. That way, you don’t need to worry about others getting greedy for your treasures,” said Lu Minghan.

“Thank you for your care, but I think you’re worrying over nothing. I don’t have any treasures, so there’s no need to worry over my safety,” said Long Chen indifferently.

“Brute, you’re looking to die!” raged Lu Minghan.

“You’re the one looking to die, you old bastard.” Long Chen had long since realized that this fellow wasn’t a good person, so he cursed right back.

Right now, he couldn’t expose the fact that he had more yuan spirit stones. This wasn’t just a problem of yuan spirit stones. The Divine Mortal Molting Elixir and Ten Thousand Spirit Blood were also absolute treasures. He was sure that the Dragonblood Legion’s display, which had relied on these treasures, had been noticed by these wily old foxes.

Long Chen had hundreds of millions of yuan spirit stones in his primal chaos space right now. That was the result of all the Immemorial Path’s aboriginals sending their yuan spirit stones to him.

But he couldn’t hand over a single one. The yuan spirit stones would just be a start. Once he started handing them over, he would be doomed. Through that, they would force him to hand over the Divine Mortal Molting Elixir, Ten Thousand Spirit Blood, and perhaps even the Heavenly Dao Fruits. So even if he died, he couldn’t hand them over. One concession would lead to a total collapse.

He had already declared his position with Ouyang Qiuyu: he wouldn’t hand them anything. He trusted Ouyang Qiuyu as she would definitely protect his secret.

As for Shui Wuhen, there was no need to say anything about that. No one would be able to get the slightest bit of valuable information out of her about Long Chen. So all he had to do was stubbornly repeat that he had none and refuse to give them anything.

“Brat!” Lu Minghan suddenly sent a palm toward him. Long Chen smashed a fist forward, summoning the Green Dragon Battle Armor. He had to go all-out against a King.

“Hmph, don’t overestimate yourself,” sneered Lu Minghan.

When Long Chen’s fist smashed onto Lu Minghan’s palm, there should have been a huge explosion. Their power should have blown apart the palace and drawn over all the Xuantian Dao Sect’s attention. Then he would be safe.

But Long Chen was startled to find that it was like his fist had struck cotton. It only caused a muffled sound. His power vanished like it had never existed, and his hand was caught.

A terrifying energy instantly confined him. It was like millions of steel bars had constricted him, making it so he couldn’t move an inch.

“In front of a true King, you are just an ant. You want to resist? Keep dreaming. Since you don’t appreciate kindness, I’ll personally go through your memories.”

Lu Minghan placed a finger on Long Chen’s forehead. Spiritual Strength poured into his mind-sea.

Long Chen was startled and enraged. If this bastard were to go through his memories, then the Nine Star Hegemon Body Art, primal chaos bead, and Eastern Wasteland Bell would all be exposed. He hastily circulated his Spiritual Strength to defend.

“Hmph, your Spiritual Strength is not bad, but it’s still not even close to enough. Break!” Lu Minghan snorted, and vicious Spiritual Strength smashed against Long Chen’s mind-sea.

Blood poured out of Long Chen’s orifices. Lu Minghan’s berserk Spiritual Strength was too strong. A King’s Spiritual Strength wasn’t something he could resist.

“Lu Minghan, what do you think you’re doing?!”

Just as Long Chen’s defenses were about to completely collapse and his memories were about to be exposed, the door to the room was blown apart. Li Changfeng furiously charged in.

“Senior brother, this Long Chen refuses to recognize kindness. I’m forcing him to tell us his secrets.” Lu Minghan ignored Li Changfeng’s arrival, continuing to bring forth more of his soul energy to break Long Chen’s final barrier.

“Lu Minghan, if you don’t stop, don’t blame me for not caring about our relationship!” Li Changfeng’s face was ashen. His hand was gripping the sword on his back, and a fierce aura locked onto Lu Minghan.

“Senior brother, you...!”

The sound of a sword coming out of its sheath rang out. Li Changfeng’s expression was firm.

An unwilling expression appeared on Lu Minghan’s face, but he was extremely intimidated by Li Changfeng. He released Long Chen.

Pow!

Lu Minghan had just released Long Chen when Long Chen’s hand viciously struck across his face. Lu Minghan hadn’t expected Long Chen to dare to strike him, and as a result, half his face caved in, and a bunch of yellow teeth scattered to the ground.

“Lu Minghan, fuck your mother!”

Long Chen was completely infuriated. After slapping him, Blooddrinker appeared in his hand. “Split the Heavens 3!” Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

Even Li Changfeng hadn’t expected Long Chen to suddenly attack. And he was using such a powerful move at that.

Lu Minghan didn’t have a powerful physical body. Imbued by the Green Dragon Battle Armor, Long Chen’s slap had almost caused his head to explode.

By the time he reacted, Long Chen’s Saber Qi had reached him. It was too late to form hand seals, and the only thing he could do was to use the simplest defense, circulating his spiritual yuan to form a barrier around him.

This hasty defense was made by a King, but it was still cut through by Long Chen’s attack.

Lu Minghan vomited blood, flying back. He slammed into a pillar in the palace, causing the whole palace to crumble.

Dust flew everywhere, and the Xuantian Dao Sect shook. All of the disciples rushed over in surprise, just barely managing to see the scene of the Xuantian Dao Sect’s palace crumble to the ground.

“Heavens, isn’t that the King, Lu Minghan?”

As the palace collapsed, a figure flew out of it, a deep cut on the front of his body. He had almost been cut in two. Everyone was horrified; what person was terrifying enough to heavily injure a King?

“Lu Minghan, you rat bastard, die!”

Suddenly, the crumbling palace exploded. Long Chen charged out at Lu Minghan.

“Kill Lu Minghan!”

“Cut him down!”

The Dragonblood warriors had no idea what was happening, but seeing Long Chen so enraged, they all charged at Lu Minghan.

Ouyang Qiuyu and Shui Wuhen also appeared. But they were lost, because Lu Minghan had just sent them a message that he had something to discuss with them.

They had been patiently waiting for him this entire time. But even after an hour, he hadn’t appeared.

When they sensed Long Chen’s aura when he destroyed the palace, they finally realized something was very off, and they rushed over just in time to see this scene.

The Dragonblood warriors were charging at Lu Minghan. Wilde was the first to arrive. Using the Barbarian Blood Bronze Body, he came smashing down with a huge bone club.

“Fuck off!” Lu Minghan was infuriated at being injured by Long Chen. That attack had been strange. It contained a special energy within it, or it wouldn’t have been able to break his defense.

Seeing Wilde arriving, he let out a single punch. Wilde was blown back, vomiting blood. A King’s power was truly terrifying.

But Wilde was also extremely powerful, and Lu Minghan received a backlash. His just-fused injury once more split open, causing blood to splash.

Tang Wan-er, Guo Ran, Gu Yang, Song Mingyuan, Li Qi, and Yue Zifeng’s attacks all arrived. They didn’t care what was happening; as long as Lu Minghan was an enemy of Long Chen’s, they would fight to the death against him.

“Ants! All of you can die!” roared Lu Minghan. His body began to shine.

“Yellow Springs Devour Souls!”

Just as Lu Minghan was about to counterattack, a huge spiritual blade slashed down. Lu Minghan felt like countless needles had stabbed his soul.

BOOM!

Gu Yang and the others’ attacks landed on Lu Minghan’s body. But they were startled to find that their attacks were unable to break the defensive light around his body.

Just at this moment, a blood-colored saber viciously slashed through Lu Minghan’s neck. Blood spurted into the air along with a head.

All the Xuantian Dao Sect’s disciples were like wooden statues. They hadn’t even understood what was happening before Long Chen cut off a King’s head.

After cutting Lu Minghan’s head, he extended a hand, launching a lightning arrow at it, wanting to completely kill him.

“Xuan Heaven and Earth Seal!”

Li Changfeng finally took action. Countless chains appeared throughout heaven and earth. Everyone was bound by them, including Lu Minghan’s headless body.

Lu Minghan’s head flew back to his neck through some unknown means, and he instantly healed.

“Li Changfeng, release me! I’ll kill all these damnable brats!” roared Lu Minghan.
