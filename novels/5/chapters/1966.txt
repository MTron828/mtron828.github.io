Chapter 1956: 1956

Long Chen was covered in blood, and even his hair had some blood on it . Under the light of his divine ring, he was like a devil god that had just charged out of hell .

One man and one saber, slowly walking forward . Countless Corrupt experts closed the path behind him . They followed him from behind, terrified .

Long Chen had charged his way in here . All those who had blocked him on the way had been killed . The Corrupt experts near the entrance of the Heavenly Evil Region had eventually been too terrified to try blocking him . They had retreated, simply following behind him . The Corrupt path might be famed for their viciousness, but they had never seen someone as vicious as this .

Xie Wentian smiled upon seeing Long Chen . He hadn’t really expected Long Chen to come .

When Heavenly Fate Island had told him to spread the word about the execution to bait Long Chen into coming, he had felt it to be stupid . It was clearly a trap . Only an idiot would come . But this idiot called Long Chen had really come .

Xie Luo was also smiling, very delightedly at that . He knew that Long Chen wouldn’t be able to leave now that he had come . In the future, there would be no Long Chen in this world .

The expressionless Leng Yueyan finally smiled . It was like a flower blooming . But at the same time, her sapphire eyes became wet . Pearl-like tears dripped down her face one by one .

Everyone was deathly silent . Only the sound of Long Chen’s footsteps resounded through the air .

However, behind those footsteps was a faint sound of blood dripping . Long Chen’s walk was like a sorrowful overture . Even in the face of death, he refused to stop walking .

Long Chen didn’t look at Xie Luo or Xie Wentian . He didn’t even look at the mass of Corrupt experts present . In his gaze was only the women bound to the wooden pillar .

“This is the second time I’ve seen you cry . ” Long Chen walked straight over to Leng Yueyan . He reached out and wiped away her tears .

Leng Yueyan smiled . There was an indescribable emotion in her eyes . “You are the first man to see me cry ever since I started cultivating . ”

“Oh? Then I’m honored . At first I didn’t know if this was really worth it, but hearing that, I feel like it is worth it . ” Long Chen smiled .

Leng Yueyan shook her head . “Do you know how stupid you are? Now that you’ve come, you won’t be able to leave . They’ve already sealed the Heavenly Evil Region . No matter how many reinforcements you call, they won’t be able to break the barrier to this world . You will definitely die . ”

“That’s alright . Don’t I have you to accompany me? With the Devil Empress by me, even the Yellow Springs won’t feel lonely . It might even be a marvelous sight . Our enmities and favors have left us entangled . This result is good . If you could protect me once, I can protect you for a lifetime . ”

Hearing that, Leng Yueyan’s eyes once more got wet . Long Chen had come here despite knowing he was sending himself to his death .

Perhaps the only one in this world who could actually care about Leng Yueyan and actually sacrifice their life for her was Long Chen .

Suddenly, clapping rang out . Xie Luo said, “What a pair of emotional lovers . Even I’m moved . How about this? Long Chen, I’ll give you a chance . We’ll have a one-on-one battle . If you beat me, I’ll release the two of you . If you lose, you have to hand over all your secrets, and in return, I will make sure that the two of your corpses aren’t defiled . How’s that?”

Xie Luo’s eyes were shining . He had already advanced to the third Heavenstage of Life Star . The Corrupt path’s resources had all been concentrated on him . Hence, the current Xie Luo gave Long Chen a very dangerous feeling . Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

In truth, the one who would benefit the most from Leng Yueyan’s execution was Xie Luo . Through this special sacrifice, the Corrupt God would bestow Leng Yueyan’s divine abilities to him .

Then he would possess her monstrous death energy . That was a terrifying power .

This challenge was not out of the goodness of his heart . He wanted to beat Long Chen himself, wiping away his previous disgrace and making sure that Huo Lieyun and True Immortal Jiaoqi wouldn’t have the same chance . Although they were called allies, once their enemies were eliminated, they would become enemies again . If Huo Lieyun and True Immortal Jiaoqi didn’t manage to defeat Long Chen, it would leave a blemish on their Dao-hearts, which would very likely slow down how quickly they advanced to Netherpassage . Then Xie Luo would have an immense advantage .

As Xie Wentian’s son, Xie Luo was quite crafty . He said that he would release the two of them if he won, but that only represented himself, not the Corrupt path . This promise was meaningless .

More importantly, he wanted to capture Long Chen alive . Everyone on the continent hoped to know Long Chen’s secrets .

The Dragonblood Legion was too terrifying . Their talent should have made them nothing more than cannon fodder, but Long Chen had turned them into the world’s number one legion . If there was no secret behind this, well, no one would believe that .

The reason for Pill Valley’s enmity with Long Chen was mostly because of their greed for his secrets . For Long Chen to send himself here, he was practically gifting his secrets to the Corrupt path .

If they weren’t afraid of Long Chen using some secret art to kill himself and destroy his secrets, they would have long since attacked .

Glancing at Xie Luo, Long Chen smiled coldly . He was far too immature to play schemes with him . Long Chen saw through his intentions instantly .

He ignored him and turned back to Leng Yueyan . He gently brushed back her hair . He messaged her, “How can I save you?”

Leng Yueyan shook her head . “You can’t save me . This pillar contains the faith energy of the Corrupt path . No power can break it . Once the ceremony begins, I will be sacrificed . After that, divine energy will come down here, and everything will be over . Long Chen, thank you . You were the one who showed me that there could still be someone who loved me in this world . I know that if you go all-out, then with your saber, you have a chance to tear through space and leave here . Leave while you can . If you exhaust yourself, you won’t have a chance . ”

“I won’t leave you . We either leave together or die together . No one can change this . Since I can’t beat this altar, then I’ll have to find some other way . There’s always some solution,” said Long Chen . Turning to Xie Luo, he said, “Don’t you think your words are crap? Once you’re defeated by me, you won’t live up to your own promise . ”

“Long Chen, don’t throw mud on my name in an attempt to anger me . I’ve always followed through with my word . It’s just that you don’t have the ability to defeat me,” said Xie Luo .

“Long Chen, don’t! Once you start fighting, you won’t have the energy to leave!” shouted Leng Yueyan .

“Since I’ve come, I never had any intention of leaving by myself . Either we leave together, or... we die together!”

Five stars lit up in Long Chen’s eyes . His 108,000 stars activated, unleashing endless energy . He attacked Xie Luo with his saber .

“He really is a hateful and loveable fellow... well, it’s fine...” Leng Yueyan muttered to herself upon seeing Long Chen’s back .

Xie Luo raised a hand, and a snake-head spear appeared . The entire spear twisted and turned . It looked to be covered in rust or corrosion, but it unleashed an evil air . It struck like a viper .

“Corrupt God Possession!”

Xie Luo let out a cry, and a figure appeared in his manifestation . That figure was covered in black mist, but its body unleashed a sinister aura .

Xie Luo’s body became covered in black runes . The snake-head spear pierced toward Long Chen .

BOOM!

The two divine items clashed, unleashing surging qi waves that even pressured the Netherpassage experts present .

The two of them were actually equally matched . Xie Luo snorted . “Bring out the power you used yesterday . I want to defeat you in your peak state . Otherwise, you’ll die before I even use my world energy . That would be too boring . ”

As expected, news of the battle yesterday had reached this place . Even his trump cards had been exposed .

“Fine . Let me see just how powerful your world energy is . ” Long Chen took a deep breath . A dragon cry rang out through the world, shaking people’s souls . Cracks appeared on Long Chen’s body as white scales appeared irregularly across his skin .

He was unable to summon the complete Azure Dragon Battle Armor, but the power he suddenly unleashed shocked everyone . That dragon might was unstoppable .

“Hahaha, good, this is the only way to make things fun . Defeating you in this state is the only way to show that I, Xie Luo, am the strongest!”

Xie Luo laughed . His hair suddenly stood on end . The black runes on his body seemed to come to life, and they roved over his body . At the same time, the surrounding space exploded . An unprecedented energy raged through the air .

“My evil spirit energy is able to merge with my world energy . Today, I’ll make sure you’re convinced of your defeat!”

Xie Luo had a sinister smile . The snake-head spear suddenly rumbled and attacked . The void collapsed in every direction .

“I’ll defeat you in one move! Heaven Devouring Evil Spear!”
