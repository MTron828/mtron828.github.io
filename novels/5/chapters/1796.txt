Chapter 1791 Crushed to Death

Translator: BornToBe

“Cough, cough...”

Suddenly, a figure climbed out of the ground. Startled cries rang out. That person was Xiang Yunfei.

Xiang Yunfei’s entire body was charred black. His hair was gone and he looked like a desiccated corpse. He had just crawled up when he began hacking up blood.

The current Xiang Yunfei had completely lost his original grandeur and arrogance. His entire body quivered just by standing. He was looking around for Long Chen’s figure.

That last exchange had been too terrifying.

If it hadn’t been for the one hundred and eight Heavenly Bone Spears, he would have been turned to ash.

He was heavily injured, with his soul, qi, and essence badly damaged. He was already on the verge of crumbling.

However, he was still looking around. His years of fighting and killing had nurtured his powerful will. He knew that Long Chen wasn’t dead. This was his best opportunity to kill him.

Suddenly, the ground exploded and a figure flew out, charging at Xiang Yunfei. The black saber in his hand mercilessly slashed down.

“It’s Long Chen!” Startled cries rang out. Long Chen’s robes were still in perfect condition. Other than his aura being in disorder and a bit of paleness, he looked the same as before.

“So when that flame lotus exploded, he had already charged underground. Considering how strong his physical body is, he was probably able to avoid a heavy injury,” said a Life Star expert.

His guess was correct. Long Chen had immediately charged into the ground when the World Annihilation Flame Lotus was about to explode. However, he hadn’t gone too deep. If he did, the underground pressure would have been too great. The depth that he had gone was perfect, allowing him to avoid most of the explosion’s power. He was definitely better off than Xiang Yunfei.

BOOM!

Long Chen was just about to reach Xiang Yunfei when the ground around Xiang Yunfei caved in. One hundred and eight bone spears shot out of the ground at Long Chen.

“Heavens, they still have the energy to fight!”

BOOM!

The Heavenly Bone Spears were sent flying by Long Chen’s saber. Xiang Yunfei’s attack had been nothing more than for appearances, but Long Chen’s attack contained actual power.

Xiang Yunfei’s arm was smashed apart by one of the bone spears that was sent flying.

Long Chen didn’t give Xiang Yunfei a chance to get away. He sent another slash at his head.

It was unknown what technique Xiang Yunfei used, but he was like a phantom, flickering to the side. Long Chen’s saber missed, slashing into the ground.

“Long Chen is really out of energy, or he would have managed to change his trajectory. They’re both exhausted.”

Xiang Yunfei’s technique hadn’t been all that marvelous. If Long Chen was in his previous condition, he definitely would have been able to react and change the path of his saber to still strike Xiang Yunfei.

Long Chen suddenly put away Evilmoon and punched Xiang Yunfei. Xiang Yunfei’s jaw was broken by this punch and he let out a snort as he flew back.

Without Evilmoon’s weight, Long Chen’s speed increased. He suddenly pointed a finger. A flicker of lightning appeared.

Suddenly, sharp sword-light slashed the air, flying right by Long Chen’s head, causing him to hastily dodge.

Long Chen’s heart shook. He recognized the aura of the one who had just attacked. It was the Grand Elder, Yan Nantian. He didn’t know why Yan Nantian was stopping him.

However, just as he dodged Yan Nantian’s attack, a silent quill flew by the other side of his face. The sword-light struck the quill, and a powerful explosion sent Long Chen and Xiang Yunfei tumbling away.

“Old hedgehog, I’ve been waiting for you. Did you think you could hide from me with your little bit of ability?”

Qu Jianying’s sword appeared in Yan Nantian’s hand. Yan Nantian sent another slash at an empty space.

“Yan Nantian, do you really think I’m afraid of you?” A cold voice rang out. A cymbal appeared in the air, transforming into the size of a mountain that blocked Yan Nantian’s sword. At the same time, a ray of light poured out of the sky, enveloping Xiang Yunfei.

“Xiang Yunfei is getting away!”

When that light pillar enveloped Xiang Yunfei, Xiang Yunfei’s body began to grow faint. This was a powerful transportation energy that was bringing him away.

“Haha, Long Chen, no matter what you try, you can’t kill me! Just wait, next time I will definitely-”

“Who has time to wait for you?” Long Chen had taken out a cyan brick at some point. He smashed it at Xiang Yunfei.

The cyan brick erupted with divine light, transforming into a giant brick that smashed down with enough power to turn heaven and earth upside down.

BOOM!

The cyan brick shattered the light enveloping Xiang Yunfei and slammed into the ground. The entire world shuddered violently, and the ground caved in. There was a bottomless hole in the ground now.

At the same time, Yan Nantian’s attack struck the cymbal. A heaven-shaking explosion erupted.

Long Chen turned to run. He knew that there were two Netherpassage experts fighting with divine items. If he was struck by the shockwaves, he would definitely die.

However, he suddenly felt the world spinning around him. He cursed inside. He had overdrafted his energy and didn’t have the energy to run.

Qu Jianying suddenly appeared in front of him. She extended a hand, blocking the shockwaves for Long Chen.

“Long Chen...! How vicious! You actually dared to kill a genius of my ancient races?!”

Space twisted, revealing a strange person with long hair and quills growing out of his back. That strange person glared at Long Chen furiously.

Reminded by this person, everyone hastily sensed the battlefield. They found that Xiang Yunfei’s aura had completely vanished.

The ground rumbled. The one hundred and eight Heavenly Bone Spears suddenly transformed into bolts of light that pierced through the void and vanished.

The Heaven Flipping Seal slowly rose out of the ground. There was now a person pressed onto one side of it.

That person was Xiang Yunfei, smashed into flat pulp. He was essentially unrecognizable, but everyone with eyes knew that he was dead, dead to the point that he couldn’t be more dead. Even his Yuan Spirit was gone. A generation’s heavenly genius had really died here. It was difficult to comprehend that this was reality.

Just at this moment, Yan Nantian and the other Grand Elders appeared in front of Long Chen, staring coldly at that strange figure.

Yan Nantian sneered, “Old hedgehog, after so many years, you still haven’t grown a brain. Xiang Yunfei initiated a life and death battle with Long Chen. Now that Xiang Yunfei is dead, Long Chen is the vicious one? Would things only be reasonable if Xiang Yunfei had killed Long Chen? Are you sure that your brain hasn’t rotted after living for so many years?” Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

“Exchanging pointers and learning from each other is normal. It should have ended there. Xiang Yunfei was already defeated, so why did you have to launch the killing blow? Are you trying to incite a war between the ancient races and the Martial Heaven Alliance?” roared that strange figure. The quills on his back were constantly trembling with rage.

Long Chen silently put away the Heaven Flipping Seal. Looking at Xiang Yunfei’s corpse, he shook his head.

He hadn’t expected things to develop to this point. Originally, he had been holding back the Heaven Flipping Seal in order to collect the Heavenly Bone Spears. Unfortunately, he had been forced to use it on Xiang Yunfei.

The Heavenly Bone Spears had fled, and he was powerless to stop them. In the end, he had won nothing. In the face of that ancient race expert’s criticism, he couldn’t even muster up the will to curse back.

“Incite a war? Well, if you want to start a war, a single genius is probably not enough. We should add an old hedgehog’s life into the mix as well.”

Suddenly, Yan Nantian stepped forward. The instant he moved, spacetime shattered. It was as if he had stepped into another spacetime. He slashed the sword in his hand at the ancient race expert.

However, it was like they were in a completely different world. They were in an isolated spacetime. The two of them were clearly there, but it was like they weren’t.

Yan Nantian actually launched a killing blow right off the bat. The ancient race expert seemed to have not expected this. The quills on his back grew explosively until they covered the sky. Ear-piercing whistling sounds shook people’s ears.

“Ow!” The experts present all covered their ears. Their faces were twisted in pain. That piercing sound was like the cry of a devil stabbing their souls.

Long Chen also felt a burst of pain, but it only made him feel uncomfortable. It wasn’t able to cause substantial damage to him like the others.

“Are you alright?” asked Qu Jianying worriedly.

“Everything else is fine, but my heart hurts a bit,” said Long Chen, clutching his chest.

“What? Did you suffer an internal injury?” asked Qu Jianying, about to check.

Long Chen shook his head. “I don’t know about any hidden injuries, but after putting in so much effort, those one hundred and eight Heavenly Bone Spears still managed to get away. I didn’t even manage to get one. I feel like my heart’s about to stop.”

“You little brat, what are you saying at such a time?!” raged Qu Jianying. She had actually been worried, while Long Chen was just joking.

“AHH!”

Suddenly, a miserable scream echoed through the air. Long Chen hastily looked up.
