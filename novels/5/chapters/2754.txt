Chapter 2743 Slaughtering His Way Into the Divine Families

“Is there a meaning to that? Although I’ve recovered, my power is to be saved for the Heaven Devastating Bracelet. This relates to the safety of the entire Martial Heaven Continent. You can’t mess around,” said the Eastern Wasteland Bell. While it understood Long Chen’s desire for vengeance, compared to revenge, the safety of the Martial Heaven Continent was more important.

It was capable of stealthily bringing out Long Chen without the divine families sensing it, and Long Chen would have some time to recover. Simply starting a slaughter was meaningless in comparison.

“No, I won’t need your power. This blood debt will be personally avenged by me,” said Long Chen.

A jade pendant appeared in Long Chen’s hand. This was the nine-line Soul Calming Jade that his parents had left for him. It was his only keepsake from them.

Throughout all these years, when he thought of his parents, he would look at it.

“The Dragon roars at the Heavens, Looking down arrogantly on the mortal world of dust. Live peacefully and happily, Never to be parted.”

The first line was domineering and grand, the second warm and gentle. They contained the love and hopes of his father and mother.

“As their son, I will kill those old things that my parents failed to kill. Perhaps they didn’t kill them due to familial emotions, but those old things didn’t treat me with any of those emotions. There is no family, only a debt to be paid.” Long Chen ground his teeth.

“But you are currently only at the seventh Heavenstage. How are you supposed to fight them?” asked the Eastern Wasteland Bell.

“I won’t be that way soon. I really have to thank the Heaven Executioner. He allowed me to comprehend another kind of cultivation.”

Long Chen reverently put away the jade pendant and sat on the ground. After forming a hand seal, his divine ring appeared behind him, filled with flowing stars. They formed an identical star map to the one inside of his Dantian. Now that there was one less star, the star map was active, creating space for endless changes.

“The Heaven Merging realm means to control heaven and earth. The Heavenly Daos become mine. Why must I follow other people’s path?”

As Long Chen’s hand seal suddenly changed, the stars behind him revolved. The world shuddered as a giant whirlpool appeared in his divine ring, crazily sucking in the power of this entire world.

The divine ring was like a gaping maw devouring the world. This world’s power could only submit.

“What a domineering cultivation technique.” The Eastern Wasteland Bell muttered to itself. It was shaken by this wild technique.

When others absorbed the power of the Heavenly Daos, they did it carefully, purifying it and taking in the power that was the correct attribute for them.

However, Long Chen was absorbing all the power, not rejecting the slightest bit. Suddenly, Long Chen’s divine ring quivered and his aura soared. He reached the eighth Heavenstage.

After that, the earth began to crack and stones started to crumble. Without the power of the laws of this world, everything was coming undone.

Three days later, this desolate world became even more desolate. It was as if the entire world had died, and all its essence had been sucked away.

As for Long Chen’s cultivation base, it had reached the ninth Heavenstage. After that, Long Chen finally stood and clenched his fist, sensing the power within him. “I don’t know how I’ll cultivate in the future, but at the very least, the Heaven Merging realm will be passed easily.”

“It’s too bad that this is just a minor world without much power. If this was a major world instead, you would reach the Sovereign realm in less than a month,” said the Eastern Wasteland Bell.

By sucking away all the power of this world, Long Chen’s cultivation base had advanced by two levels. Such a cultivation technique was something that the Eastern Wasteland Bell had never seen before.

“It’s fine. There are more worlds. The Yin Yang World, Devil Spirit Mountain, Resentful Death City, the Ancient Battlefield, I can go for a stroll through all of them,” said Long Chen. This place was barren, but those worlds had plenty of energy.

Right now, space began to collapse as the laws of space had been sucked away by Long Chen. All of a sudden, a screen of light appeared above Long Chen’s head. That was the exit.

This exit was originally invisible, but as the laws and energy of this world were sucked away, it revealed itself.

Long Chen took out his jade pendant and waved it across the light screen. The exit then opened and Long Chen stepped through.

The scene changed and Long Chen appeared within a channel. However, there were people guarding this place. Long Chen was about to wipe them all out when he came to a startled stop.

“Long Chen?”

Long Chen hadn’t expected that the guards of this place were actually the eighth Heavenly Dragon Legion’s warriors. Their leader was Shen Chengfeng.

This channel had eight totems in eight different locations. The divine families truly viewed Long Chen highly. The world that he was imprisoned in had only one entrance to it, but two exits. However, one of those exits led to a sure-death formation. Even a Saint would be instantly killed upon entering it.

As for the exit that he had gone through, that was also the entrance, and it was guarded. There were eight alarm systems set up, and triggering any one of them would instantly alert the divine families.

Long Chen had planned to immediately wipe out all the experts guarding this place upon entering, not giving them a chance to set off the alarm. However, he hadn’t expected that the ones guarding this place were the eighth Heavenly Dragon Legion.

Shen Chengfeng and the others were dumbfounded. They had no idea what they were guarding. All they knew was that anyone who went past them had to be strictly checked and examined.

Normally, it would not be their place to guard such a core location. But the usual guards were receiving some kind of inheritance, so they had taken over their shift for half a day. This half a day resulted in Long Chen running into them.

They were aware that Long Chen had been captured, but they had no idea where he was being imprisoned.

At this moment, Shen Chengfeng suddenly waved his hand, and a jade pendant flew toward Long Chen. He caught it.

Shen Chengfeng sighed. “The exit up ahead has three paths. Don’t take any of them. Pause for a few seconds, and a fourth path will appear. When you reach the end of that path, crush the jade pendant, and take the left of the three paths that appear.” Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

Long Chen was moved. Shen Chengfeng and the others were willing to betray the divine families to let him free.

The divine families truly had many safeguards set up around him. If it weren’t for Shen Chengfeng, he might have fallen into their trap. This was a matter that not even the Heaven Executioner knew.

“Brother, I’ll have to offend you.”

Long Chen patted Shen Chengfeng’s shoulder. After that, his Spiritual Strength suddenly burst forth, and every expert guarding this place coughed up blood and collapsed. Long Chen also left an appalling wound on Shen Chengfeng’s body, making it seem as if Long Chen had given a killing blow, and Shen Chengfeng had only survived due to luck.

Following Shen Chengfeng’s instructions, Long Chen passed through the channel. After that, his vision brightened and a dense spiritual qi poured over him. It felt like his pores suddenly opened.

“You-!”

As soon as he walked out, four of the divine families’ experts appeared.

Using the side of his hand as a blade, he cut through their throats in an instant. Four heads flew.

“It’s time for that evil bitch to pay for the past, as well as the present.” Long Chen walked deeper into the divine families’ ancestral land.
