Chapter 3557

This was an irresistible power, something that could destroy heaven and earth. Even World Kings were as weak as ants in front of this power.

Early stage World Kings were instantly turned into nothingness, while mid stage World Kings were caught up to by that black ripple and instantly had their bodies explode. Those without World Domain divine items to protect themselves didn’t even get to keep their Yuan Spirits. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

Only late stage World Kings that were old monsters had sensed the danger early enough and had fled at the start, creating some distance from the core. Despite that, they were still struck by that black ripple and sent rumbling out, hacking up blood. Their injuries were not light.

The most shocking thing of all was that this black ripple contained destructive power that didn’t just damage their physical bodies but also invaded their souls.

After that black ripple passed, a giant hole appeared in the earth. Also, flames still burned in the sky, and there were spatial cracks everywhere. The originally blue sky had already lost its color. The clear day had become black night.

Heaven and earth had completely changed as if the end of the world had come. Even far off in the Dragon Blaze Prefecture, the commoners in the city were quivering with fear, hiding in their rooms and not even daring to look outside.

“The Yan Xu Flame can burn the ten thousand Daos and devour the ten thousand flames. There is no power that can resist it. But…” A late stage World King spoke, his voice shuddering. The Yan Xu Flame was known to all flame cultivators. It was said to be the strongest flame in the nine heavens and ten lands, an unrivaled existence.

“Is the Starry River of the Sky Art whose inheritance was lost really so powerful? Can it resist the Yan Xu Flame?”

People didn’t dare to believe their eyes. The Starry River of the Sky Art was famous as well. Furthermore, just recently, Long Chen had gone to the ruins of the Starry River Palace and expounded on the Dao, selflessly sharing the Starry River of the Sky Art with the public. That news had rapidly spread.

Now that Long Chen summoned the Starry River manifestation, drawing in astral power, he unleashed astonishing power that shook countless people. It seemed that the Starry River of the Sky Art was even stronger than the legends.

The collision of both of their attacks killed an unknown number of World Kings. Such power was something that terrified even late stage World Kings.

The cracks filling the sky rumbled, slowly healing. Up in the sky, Long Chen pointed the Minghong Saber at the distant Yan Hong.

Yan Hong held his black spear, his hair flying in the wind. He stared at Long Chen. “What strange power. It was actually capable of receiving my full-power attack. However, your violet qi has been used up, right? What will you take out to receive my next attack?”

It was at this moment that everyone realized that the violet qi in the starry river behind Long Chen was gone. Clearly, Long Chen had used up everything just to block Yan Hong’s attack.

“You’re too tired! You need to rest! Let me out!”

Just then, an extremely enticing voice rang out in Long Chen’s mind. Long Chen instantly felt a bout of weariness.

“Scram!”

Long Chen shouted, shaking his mind awake. Just now, his heart-devil had launched a mental attack to try to take over.

He knew that in this moment of utmost rage, his heart-devil was growing active, looking for a chance to take over this body.

Last time, the Heavenly Rainbow Fairy had helped him suppress the heart-devil. If the heart-devil did take over again, this time, there would be no one to wake him up.

Long Chen’s shout was to his heart-devil, but people took it to be toward Yan Hong. Yan Hong then snorted and actually put away his black spear.

His manifestation quivered and a black sphere of light appeared. The rest of his manifestation slowly flowed into that sphere.

When Yan Hong’s manifestation was sucked up, a black rune appeared on his forehead. He now truly appeared like a devil. He coldly said, “I didn’t expect to run into an expert like you this time. But you’re out of energy now, no? In order to express my respect for you, I will use my Yan Xu race’s strongest attack to end you. This attack contains the Yan Xu line’s primal chaos energy. Are you prepared?”

As Yan Hong spoke, people saw black threads appear within that sphere. Those black threads gave off a sinister will but also a primordial energy.

People’s souls quivered. Even late stage World Kings were shaken by those threads. They could sense the call of death from those threads, and they felt as miniscule as ants.

“You need my power. Otherwise, you will die here…” Long Chen’s heart-devil once more rang out in his mind.

Without even being aware of it, Long Chen had the Purgatory Eyes active. The dark energy was swelling, but Long Chen didn’t want to use that dark energy.

That was because he didn’t trust in something he could control. If his heart-devil took advantage of that moment to take over, it would be difficult to turn the tables back.

Yan Hong was very terrifying. If he hadn’t caused the three Divine Venerate Heavenly Flame Beasts to detonate, Long Chen was ninety percent sure that his third blow would have killed him.

The repeated blows of Split the Heavens had been interrupted. Then that Immemorial Flame Devil, as well as Zhao Mingxuan, Wu Yang, and the others had joined in, disturbing Long Chen and completely messing up his rhythm.

Long Chen had killed so many experts, and that had depleted his precious violet qi. Just now, in order to block Yan Hong’s fully charged attack, he had been forced to draw in the power of the stars.

Although he had managed to block it, that had used up all the remaining violet qi in his body. He could no longer summon astral energy again. At this time, his heart-devil tried to seduce him.

Long Chen defended his mind, preventing his heart-devil from disturbing him. After putting away the Minghong Saber, a flame lotus blossomed in his hand. Sacred chanting once more filled the air.

Long Chen’s flame lotus grew explosively. Ten miles… a hundred miles… a thousand miles… ten thousand miles…

In just a breath’s time, it filled the sky, and a terrifying pressure crashed down, shaking the world. That destructive power caused the nine heavens to change color. In his fury, Long Chen was summoning all the flame energy that he had absorbed from the Heavenly Flame World. He didn’t hold back at all.

Everyone was stunned by this. The range of this attack was absolutely horrifying. After explosively growing in size to ten thousand miles, it then began to slowly compress.

Ten thousand miles… nine thousand miles… eight thousand miles…

As it compressed, its pressure grew even greater, even more terrifying. Hence, everyone’s expression completely changed, including Yan Hong’s.

Yan Hong had a bad feeling. Only eighty percent of the power of his manifestation had entered his sphere, but he could no longer wait. He directly launched this sphere of flames. Spacetime runes broke and danced in front of it. It was shattering the world as it moved through space.

“Yan Xu Heaven Breaking Attack!”

At this moment, the flame lotus in Long Chen’s hand had been compressed to the limit. It could no longer be compressed, and he shoved it forward.

“World Extermination Flame Lotus!

Two clumps of flames, both containing apocalyptic power, clashed viciously in front of the stunned gazes of millions of experts.
