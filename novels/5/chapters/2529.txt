Chapter 2518 Secret Transaction

“Wow, he’s coming again! Get another leg!” Guo Ran cried out excitedly.

Due to his excitement, he didn’t notice that while he had managed to cut off Zhao Ritian’s leg, another egg-sized nick had appeared in his saber.

The runes of his saber were no longer complete. Due to the damage, another blow like that might cause it to shatter.

“Zhao Ritian, calm down!” Suddenly, a streak of light flew over, blocking Zhao Ritian. It was Feng Fei.

While fighting against Mo Nian, Feng Fei still kept an eye on the overall battlefield. Seeing that Zhao Ritian was consumed with rage, she stopped him. In this state, he was at far too great of a disadvantage.

She understood Zhao Ritian too well. Someone without a brain would definitely go crazy after losing a leg.

“Get out of the way! I’ll kill them no matter what!” roared Zhao Ritian, his expression frighteningly sinister.

Divine light flew out of Feng Fei’s hand, condensing into chains that bound Zhao Ritian. “That’s not worth it. Calm down, or I’ll use the divine seal to send you out.”

Zhao Ritian was fuming, but he gradually calmed down. He pointed at Guo Ran and cursed, “You little fucker, just wait, I will definitely tear you to pieces.”

Yun Tian suddenly curled his lips. A grand Sovereign sprout was actually cursing like a vixen on the street. It seemed that Guo Ran really had some skill.

Guo Ran was not some saint who would just sit there and allow himself to be cursed without saying anything back. However, a cultured man like him wouldn’t bring up Zhao Ritian’s seniors or women in his family.

Instead, Guo Ran’s manifestation appeared. Four balls of light were present.

“Three heads and one leg. As expected of Zhao Ritian. This sincerity, this gift-giving, I’m sure you’d feel bad if I didn’t accept these gifts.” Guo Ran’s pleased voice was so infuriating that he could easily anger someone to death.

Guo Ran was quite careful, only showing the three heads and one leg within his manifestation. He didn’t dare to take them out directly for fear that Zhao Ritian would have a secret technique to take them back.

Clapping sounds rang out as Mo Nian came over. He raised a thumb. “Well said. And it wasn’t just the words, the way you said them was also perfect. Combined with your expression, it was perfectly done.”

“You’re too courteous. Brother, I see that you’re also a man of culture and refinement. Your comments are perfectly on point.” Guo Ran made a big show of cupping his fists in thanks.

Guo Ran’s nonsense was just to irritate Zhao Ritian, but it had been praised into a delightful sonnet by Mo Nian.

“Not better than yours.”

“You are overpraising me.”

Mo Nian and Guo Ran bounced off each other, infuriating Zhao Ritian even more.

“I… I… pfft!” Zhao Ritian suddenly coughed up golden blood. It could be seen just what kind of peak his anger had reached.

“What a vulgar and unrefined person. You’re actually pissing yourself in front of everyone? Shameful.” Mo Nian shook his head.

Zhao Ritian was one step away from exploding in anger. He was unable to suppress his wrath in front of Mo Nian and Guo Ran’s provocations. It felt like if he didn’t vent somehow, he would die.

“What are you doing?! Kill Long Chen!” shouted Ye Ming from within the barrier, his expression just as twisted as Zhao Ritian’s.

Black qi was gushing out from behind him as he tried to support the altar against Long Chen’s karmic hell flames. However, they were not so easily suppressed.

He was attempting to use the Corrupt path’s disciples’ life energy in addition to the great tree’s energy to revive the fiend king as quickly as possible.

That process was like filling a pool of water. Only once it was full would the fiend king revive. But Long Chen’s flames were like a hole at the bottom of the pool, causing the water to flow away. The life energy of the altar was constantly being incinerated.

As a result, they had reached a stalemate. No matter how Ye Ming tried, he couldn’t progress any further.

Furthermore, he didn’t dare to be careless. If he stopped the life energy pouring inside, Long Chen’s karmic hell flames would reach the core of the altar. Once the altar was damaged, everything would be for naught.

Ye Ming saw that the Pill Fairy and Yun Tian had made a ceasefire, and he had guessed as to the conditions. However, upon seeing the idiot Zhao Ritian actually quibbling with the Dragonblood warriors, he was infuriated.

“The important matters are more pressing. We’ll attack from both sides to break their formation.” Feng Fei sent a message to Zhao Ritian and then attacked Mo Nian. As for Zhao Ritian, he attacked Wilde.

“Wilde, send him over. I’m still missing one leg and two arms for a perfect set!” shouted Guo Ran.

Zhao Ritian almost fell from the sky. His fury transformed into limitless power as he repeatedly attacked Wilde.

“Careful!” Mo Nian suddenly shouted. It was unknown what ability Feng Fei had just used, but she managed to absorb the power of his arrow and then pounced on the Dragonblood Legion’s formation.

Just at that moment, Zhao Ritian also knocked Wilde aside. The Heaven Suppressing Dragon Coiling Staff erupted with divine light.

“Block!”

Xia Chen’s shout came from the core of the formation. Everyone’s manifestations instantly linked together, and the sphere’s interior became indistinct.

Guo Ran and Gu Yang appeared on the two sides of the formation. All the Dragonblood Legion’s energy was concentrated on the two of them.

BOOM!

Zhao Ritian and Feng Fei were both blown back, but all the Dragonblood warriors inside coughed up a mouthful of blood.

The formation changed shape slightly but quickly returned to normal. The Dragonblood warriors let out a powerful roar.

Even two Sovereign sprouts were unable to break their formation. This showed just how powerful they were.

“To unite ten thousand hearts has always just been an exaggerated saying. From ancient times to now, perhaps they are the only ones to achieve it.” Yun Tian sighed. A strange light suddenly appeared in his eyes as he smiled. “Not even a Sovereign could do this. Perhaps…”

“Come! Let’s just keep injuring each other! I wonder who will last longer?” Guo Ran’s roar rang out along with a metallic ringing. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

Despite appearing arrogant and domineering, Guo Ran was actually coughing up blood. Fortunately, no one could see through his armor.

Feng Fei and Zhao Ritian were both shocked. Just now, their combined blow had been perfect. Despite unleashing their full power together, the Dragonblood Legion had still blocked them.

Their blood was flipping inside of them. Feng Fei’s arm was tingling. The Dragonblood Legion’s combination technique was truly powerful. No wonder Long Chen dared to focus entirely on Ye Ming.

“Don’t fight. Come inside!” shouted Ye Ming. He was starting to feel like he couldn’t last any longer. The five hundred thousand Corrupt disciples were all pale. Too much of their life energy had been extracted.

If this continued, they would not be able to stop the flames. The altar would be incinerated.

Feng Fei and Zhao Ritian immediately entered the formation of the altar. Zhao Ritian cursed, “Ye Ming, what the fuck are you doing? You were bragging all along about how Long Chen and the others would be easily caught together. But what about now? You’ve even managed to implicate us. If I had known you were so useless, I wouldn’t have worked with you.”

Zhao Ritian was too infuriated, and he cast his anger on Ye Ming carelessly. The humiliation of having three heads and one leg cut off was directly unleashed on Ye Ming.

“You’re the one who can’t even beat some dumb brat. What does having your limbs cut off have to do with me? If you had simply gotten rid of that brat, everything would have gone according to plan. Everything that has happened is your fault, and you have the face to blame others?!” raged Ye Ming.

The plan had been calculated. Ye Ming would handle Long Chen, the Pill Fairy would stall Yun Tian, and Feng Fei would take charge of Mo Nian.

That way, Zhao Ritian could wipe out the Dragonblood Legion. The plan had been for him to slowly kill them and take control of the battlefield, causing Long Chen to be distracted.

If the Dragonblood Legion was wiped out in one go, then Long Chen would have nothing tying him to this place, and he might run. As a result, the Dragonblood Legion was the bait to keep Long Chen here and make sure he died.

However, their plan was unable to keep up with the changes. Now, this plan seemed laughable. Let alone killing the Dragonblood Legion, Wilde alone had managed to stop Zhao Ritian.

Furthermore, the Dragonblood Legion had become Long Chen’s crucial shield at this moment. Only Zhao Ritian had failed his mission, and now he was blaming Ye Ming. Ye Ming’s fury naturally ignited.

“Stop fighting.” Even Feng Fei couldn’t help being angry. “Ye Ming, what are you doing? Didn’t you say that everything is within your control? We were just supposed to give you some small help. But now? This was your plan, and while Zhao Ritian did cause some unexpected events, you still have to bear most of the responsibility. We shouldn’t be discussing blame right now. We need to decide whether or not there really is a way to kill Yun Tian. If not, we can go our separate ways right now and stop wasting time.”

Feng Fei’s tone was icy. Her only goal was Yun Tian. All of them were after him. The existence of a Sovereign’s son was extremely threatening to them.

“There’s only one way left. Summon your subordinates and have their life energy draw out the energy of this tree. Then we can instantly revive the Heaven Devouring Fiend King,” said Ye Ming.

“Fine, I’ll trust you one final time. Don’t forget your promise, otherwise…,” said Feng Fei coldly.

“Don’t worry, you’ll have your share of the divine tree’s spirit source,” said Ye Ming.

Feng Fei took out a formation disc. The sky lit up as the formation activated, and many figures began to appear on the altar.
