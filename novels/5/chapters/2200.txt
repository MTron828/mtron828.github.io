Chapter 2190 Undefeatable Disposition

A bone trident tore through the void, bringing with it a fierce howl. The Six Horn Sea Serpent man was the first to attack.

“Long Chen, your blasphemy toward the Six Horn Sea Serpent race will cause you and your human race to pay a huge price,” said the Six Horn Sea Serpent man.

He was an extremely young king amongst the Six Horn Sea Serpent race. He was the strongest expert from this generation of the sea demon race and had come here today to show the world the power of the sea demon race and make sure no one dared to fight them.

Unexpectedly though, a little human not only refused to get out of his way but actually struck him. Although he didn’t know the insulting nature of a slap in the face, just the fact that Long Chen had struck him was infuriating enough.

BOOM! Long Chen’s saber slashed into the bone trident. The ground beneath their feet exploded, and a huge qi wave soared into the sky.

Long Chen was forced back three steps. He was caught by surprise by how curiously powerful this sea serpent was.

“I’ll say it again, don’t be a pig who only remembers feedings and not beatings. Listen to my words closely: if you want to live long, don’t be arrogant in front of me.”

Pow!

Long Chen’s left hand swung through the air, slapping the sea serpent in the face once more.

Last time, Long Chen’s right hand had slapped the left side of his face, and now his left hand slapped the right side of his face. Balance was restored. The sea serpent went spinning through the air.

Seeing the sea serpent man get slapped again, everyone’s expressions changed, especially the people who had fought against Long Chen like Dongfang Yuyang.

The first slap had been too fast for them to see it clearly, but this time, they were prepared. This clearly ordinary slap had been refined into a divine art by Long Chen. Despite seeing it clearly, that sea serpent was unable to dodge it.

The profundities behind Long Chen’s slap had surpassed their understanding. It could even be said that it had reached the pinnacle of a Dao.

The killing power of this move did not reside in the physical slap but the pain of the mind.

Kun Pengzi’s expression was the darkest of all. He had been slapped in the face by Long Chen as well, and now he couldn’t put it out of his mind. These supreme geniuses would rather be struck several times with a blade than be slapped in the face.

The sea serpent man let out a heaven-shaking roar. Although he didn’t understand the humiliating aspect of a face slap, having fallen for it twice still caused his fury to soar.

One of the horns on his head began to shine, and his aura leaped a whole level. Then a second horn also lit up.

Four of his horns lit up one by one, his aura growing every time. It was like one seal after another was being undone within his body.

A heart-clenching air rose out of the sea serpent. Seeing this, Long Chen didn’t dare to tarry. He summoned the Azure Dragon Battle Armor, and a resounding dragon cry rang out. He shot toward the sea serpent.

As the two of them repeatedly clashed in the air, the sea serpent suddenly roared, “Bastard, how can you possess true dragon might?!”

As soon as Long Chen had summoned the Azure Dragon Battle Armor, the Six Horn Sea Serpent had immediately felt a spiritual and bloodline suppression.

“This azure dragon reverse scale came from the Martial Heaven Sea-Ring. Did you not know of its existence?” asked Long Chen curiously.

“So it was you who barged into the forbidden zone!” The sea serpent came to a sudden realization.

The azure dragon reverse scale had been in the sea for countless years. It had been noticed by the sea demon race many years ago, and the Six Horn Sea Serpent race had attempted to subdue it several times. However, they had been given a painful lesson as many of their top experts had their lives taken by the scale.

Those who had dared to challenge the azure dragon reverse scale had been the strongest members of the Six Horn Sea Serpent race, the overlords of the sea demon race. However, thirty-nine experts of that level had died. There was even one of the leaders of the Six Horn Sea Serpent race who had died to it before fully transmitting their abilities to the next, resulting in two divine abilities being lost.

Having been given a painful lesson, the Six Horn Sea Serpent race had made the area around the azure dragon reverse scale a forbidden region. Even sea demons from other races did not dare to approach it. That place was a nightmare for them for many years.

Now that Long Chen had summoned the Azure Dragon Reverse Scale, the sea serpent felt an immense pressure. Then hearing that it was the result of the azure dragon reverse scale, he almost exploded in rage.

The Six Horn Sea Serpent race was the descendant of the Six Horn Water Dragon and the Heavenly Unicorn Sea Serpent. The Heavenly Unicorn Sea Serpent had been an ancient beast with a powerful bloodline, and after mating with the Six Horn Water Dragon, it had resulted in the Six Horn Sea Serpent race, a race inheriting the divine abilities of both those two races.

As a result, they also had dragon blood flowing within them. Hence, this sea serpent felt an even greater suppression from Long Chen than the Xuan Beasts.

“Damn you! I’ll tear you to pieces!” roared the sea serpent man.

Thinking of how thirty-nine of his race’s peak experts had died in a vain attempt to subdue something that a human in the Life Star realm had subdued made him crazy. This was an absolute humiliation.

“Then work hard. With your current level of power, it’ll be very hard for you to achieve your grand aspiration,” said Long Chen, repeatedly slashing Evilmoon.

However, while Long Chen looked calm, he was shocked inside by how powerful this Six Horn Sea Serpent was.

Based on Long Chen’s estimates, the bloodline suppression should make it so that this sea serpent man could only use a maximum of eighty percent of his power, but this eighty percent was enough for him to attack so strongly that Long Chen’s arms tingled. The Six Horn Sea Serpent man’s true power was much greater than Kung Pengzi’s and the others.

As Long Chen fought his opponent, the Dragonblood Legion also started fighting the other sea demons.

“Brothers, the meat has come!” Guo Ran laughed and repeatedly shot his crossbow. Every arrow exploded amongst the army of sea demons, shooting out countless spikes. Even the sea demons with their tough scales and plate armor were unable to block those sharp spikes.

Blood flew everywhere. Some spikes went through five or six bodies before running out of power.

“Hehe, Xia Chen is amazing. These piercing runes are monstrous.” These were new arrows that Guo Ran had made, with Xia Chen applying special runes to them. They were made of the finest divine materials.

Every arrow killed hundreds of sea demons. The satisfying feeling Guo Ran got made him cry out excitedly.

However, the sea demons were endless and fast. Guo Ran only had time to shoot a dozen arrows before they arrived.

“Dragonblood brothers, arc killing formation! Brothers and sisters of the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow race, protect the skies. Brothers of the Mo family, attack from the rear. Brothers of the Heaven Splitting Battle Sect, there’s nothing for you to do. You can just shout and cheer.” Guo Ran quickly made arrangements for the warriors.

The Dragonblood Legion’s arc formation covered everyone, while the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrows guarded the sky and Mo Gate’s arrows shot from the back. Their entire formation was like an iron board.

As for the Heaven Splitting Battle Sect’s disciples, there truly was nothing for them to do. If they stepped forward, it would affect the Dragonblood Legion’s formation. Temporarily, they could only watch.

Bao Buping and Chang Hao were irritated, but they also knew that now was not the time for them to take action.

Sword Qi, arrows, divine abilities, they rained down upon the sea demons. They were slaughtered rapidly.

Seeing this, Bao Buping said, “Fine, these little shrimps aren’t worth us attacking. When the big fish come, we’ll go up.”

“This little bastard, when did he learn to talk big? When he gets back, I’ll properly correct him,” cursed the old man. But he was smiling.

The Dragonblood Legion’s formation was seamless and incredibly powerful. The sea demon army was repeatedly forced back, leaving behind mountains of corpses.

The Dragonblood Legion’s Sword Qi possessed a sharpness unique to sword cultivators. But in truth, it was impossible for Yue Zifeng to transmit his Sword Dao to everyone. Furthermore, his comprehensions were his own and not suitable for others.

Their terrifying Sword Qi was the result of the runes on their swords. Xia Chen had set up those runes to create an imitation of Yue Zifeng’s Sword Dao.

Xia Chen had spent many years researching this kind of Sword Dao rune. However, back then, he hadn’t had enough money, and his research had not borne fruit. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

After encountering Long Chen, he no longer had that restriction, and there was also a genius like Yue Zifeng whom he could model the Sword Qi after. This resulted in him finally coming up with this Sword Qi rune.

While creating their armor and swords, he had also modified the Sword Qi runes on them to mix with the Dragonblood warriors’ power, so that they could unleash a terrifying attack similar to the Sword Qi of sword cultivators.

This sight made the experts from Pill Valley and the other powers sigh with relief that they hadn’t charged in like this. Otherwise, they really would have taken hideous losses.

Suddenly, the sound of something breaking rang out. The qi flow streams began to gush wildly.

“The third wave is starting! Everyone, attack your bottlenecks!” People began to shout. This was the moment they had all been waiting for. This was the best time to absorb the qi flow to break through their barriers.
