Chapter 2145 News of the Heavenly Netherworld Vermillion Fruit

The Martial Heaven Sea-Ring was a danger zone, but the experts of the continent had to come into contact with it more than they wished. However, those who knew much about it were few.

No one knew for sure what lay in the depths of the sea. All they knew was that the Martial Heaven Sea-Ring was filled with terrifying sea demons.

Furthermore, every now and then, a sea demon tide would come from it. Sea demons would charge onto the continent. Only during that time could the continent’s experts slaughter those sea demons without drawing attacks from the stronger sea demons.

Normally, when crossing the sea, people would be reserved, and even if they were attacked by sea demons, they wouldn’t counterattack. If they disturbed the more terrifying sea demons, that would be troublesome.

“Has the sea demon race also come out?” asked Long Chen.

“Yes. The sea demon race has started stepping foot onto the continent. They’re searching for the qi flow eruption’s location as well. A few conflicts have happened between them and the continent’s experts. I feel like they are doing this on purpose as a show of might, and to indicate that they will also have their share of the qi flow eruption,” said Qu Jianying.

If the sea demon race had come out, that meant that another opponent with unknown potential had appeared. In fact, the sea demon race might even outnumber the cultivators on the continent. Whether it was the Righteous path, the Corrupt path, even the ancient races or the Xuan Beasts, no one dared to provoke the sea demon race.

The sea demon race’s numbers were absolutely terrifying. They were hidden beneath the sea. No one knew just how many powerful experts they had.

“If all the large powers fight during the qi flow eruption, rivers of blood will flow,” sighed Long Chen.

“Most likely. Based on historical records, the qi flow will erupt from the depths of the earth and form a well. The Martial Heaven Continent’s qi flow will turn into thousands of streams bursting out of the ground. Those who can occupy the larger streams will be able to absorb more qi flow. The smaller streams will get less qi flow. Some won’t even be strong enough to occupy a small stream and will only be able to stand in the distance and absorb the leftovers. Legend is that there has always been a bloody battle for the largest stream of qi flow. After all, it will determine who becomes the master of the continent. Moreover, this great era seems to be on a much larger scale than in the past. All the geniuses hidden on the continent are coming out to fight for this era. So this time, the competition for the largest qi flow stream will definitely be exceptionally intense. Actually, the continent’s lifeforms should unite against the sea demon race because they don’t help us. In the past dark eras, they’ve hidden themselves and didn’t help the continent. Not only can we not depend on them, but we have to give up a portion of our qi flow. That’s unacceptable,” said Qu Jianying hatefully.

The sea demon race could not be counted as an ally, even if they weren’t enemies. They didn’t seem to care about the fate of the continent, as if the world at the bottom of the sea would always be safe.

However, all people felt some fear toward them because who knew just how great the force they had managed to gather over the years were, especially after not participating in the dark eras?

In fact, it seemed that the sea demon race had never participated in the qi flow eruption before this. If they had, it wouldn’t have been on a large scale. But now there were signs that the entire sea demon race wanted to come out. Did they want an even share of the continent’s qi flow?

“Now it’ll be interesting.” Long Chen smiled.

“Interesting? Little fellow, do you know just how terrifying the sea demon race is?” Qu Jianying held her head. She had been hoping for Long Chen to reserve himself upon hearing about these terrifying opponents, but it seemed that he didn’t care.

“Whether they’re terrifying or not doesn’t matter. If we’re fated to be enemies, then we’ll meet sooner or later. Rather than focusing on them, it’s better to focus on ourselves and get stronger. The old man is correct, in front of absolute power, all schemes are useless.” Long Chen shrugged.

“Fine, if you’re undaunted, I won’t waste my time saying these things. Tell me, do you want to work together with us during the qi flow eruption to occupy a larger stream of qi flow?” asked Qu Jianying.

The Martial Heaven Alliance was the continent’s largest alliance. They would definitely gather the geniuses of the various sects and occupy a steam of qi flow for themselves.

Qu Jianying didn’t mind joining forces with Long Chen. That way, they could occupy an even larger stream of qi flow. A supreme expert needed to be present to keep the qi flow stream under control. Otherwise, weak people would simply be sent flying by the burst of power.

However, Long Chen was surrounded by enemies. He would definitely have people fighting him during the qi flow eruption. She didn’t quite know what to do about this problem.

“We won’t go with you. The Dragonblood Legion will occupy our own qi flow stream. With how many enemies we have, others who joined us probably wouldn’t be able to absorb any qi flow when the time comes,” said Long Chen. He was clearest on this. When the qi flow eruption occurred, things would definitely be chaotic. No one would give up on this opportunity that only occurred once every tens of thousands of years.

“Will you be alright on your own? Do you want the Xuantian Dao Sect and the Heaven Splitting Battle Sect’s disciples on your side?” asked Qu Jianying.

The Xuantian Dao Sect and the Heaven Splitting Battle Sect were extremely powerful now. Bao Buping and Chang Hao had awakened their manifestations, and on the side of the Xuantian Dao Sect, there were Hua Shiyu, Wang Zhen, Mu Qingxuan, Su Mo, and others who had awakened their manifestations as well.

Qu Jianying didn’t know that the reason Hua Shiyu and the others had awakened their manifestations was thanks to Long Chen. If he hadn’t sent them his Hundred Flower Dao Resonation Pills, they would have needed a much longer time to awaken their manifestations.

He hadn’t told Qu Jianying about the Hundred Flower Dao Resonation Pills. It wasn’t that he didn’t trust her, but that he felt there were definitely traitors in the Martial Heaven Alliance.

There were definitely traitors in the Xuantian Dao Sect as well, but just who was Li Tianxuan? He could perfectly control the information their enemies received. There was no need to worry about things there.

However, Qu Jianying was unable to do the same. After all, an alliance was different from a sect. She needed to publicly announce things according to the rules of the alliance and discuss things with various Elders with authority. Long Chen didn’t want to take that risk.

“There is absolutely no need. In fact, we won’t even go with the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow race. Don’t worry, I am prepared,” said Long Chen.

There were less than two months now before the qi flow eruption. Although time was a bit tight, he was confident that Guo Ran would be able to finish things on his side.

Long Chen chatted a bit longer with Qu Jianying. He asked about the state of affairs on the continent. More of the ancient era’s powers had come out, and amongst them was the fourth everlasting family that had been silent this entire time. The Ximen family had finally come out.

It was said that the Ximen family’s supreme genius was called Ximen Tianxiong. He had been very famous during his time. He was known for being frank yet also violent. He didn’t get along with others very well. The Ximen family didn’t seem to have many dealings with the other three everlasting families. They seemed antisocial.

Other than the Ximen family, there was one other particular person that had appeared. He was a sword cultivator, but he constantly wore a silver mask and had never reported his name.

The reason he managed to shake the continent was because he had slain one of the ancient era’s geniuses with a single slash of his sword. The person he had slain was someone who had been invited to the gathering of past and present heroes. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

Hearing that, Long Chen was truly surprised. To be able to kill one of the supreme geniuses of the ancient era with one attack was truly amazing. He had to be a sword cultivator.

After getting an update about the current movements on the continent, Long Chen went to the Huayun Sect. He saw a radiant Zheng Wenlong.

Just as Long Chen had expected, to give a blow to the Dongfang family’s business, the Nangong family and the Beitang family had been more than happy to form a collaboration with the Huayun Sect.

However, the two families were rather conservative. They only traded for things that were useful to them. They wouldn’t sell their treasures for something like spirit crystals.

In truth, Zheng Wenlong only needed the two families to say that they were collaborating with him to achieve his goals. With just being able to say that he was working together with those two families, he had the confidence to go to other powers for negotiations.

Even without taking out any treasures themselves, the Huayun Sect was able to act as the go-between, buying and selling things from their connections to make a profit. It looked very easy, but in truth, it was not so simple. What had been missing was the powerful reputation of the everlasting families. Without that prestige, it would have been impossible.

The Huayun Sect had their own reputation that had been built up little by little. On the Business Dao, no one could instantly soar to the top, and even if they did, it would be short-lived. The Huayun Sect had managed to achieve their current level by acting in good faith toward all their clients generation after generation.

With that reputation and being able to say that he had the Nangong and Beitang families as clients, Zheng Wenlong managed to form connections with dozens of other powers who said that they also wished to collaborate with him.

“Brother Long, I really have to thank you this time. Without your referrals, I would have had no chance,” said Zheng Wenlong. He had gone to the Nangong and Beitang families before, but they hadn’t wanted to collaborate because there was nothing in the Huayun Sect’s hands that they wanted.

Although the Dongfang family’s actions had made them wary, if it had not been for Long Chen’s referrals, they probably wouldn’t have wanted to start this collaboration. To put it frankly, it was thanks to Nangong Zuiyue and Beitang Rushuang giving Long Chen face.

“Helping you is helping me. So how are things now? Did you get anything I need?” asked Long Chen.

Zheng Wenlong had set up a trading platform, and from this, Long Chen could see if there was anything he wanted to trade for. That was truly helping him.

Zheng Wenlong suddenly slapped his leg. “I almost forgot. The Heavenly Underworld Vermillion Fruit that you wanted me to keep an eye out for, there’s been some news about it.”

“What?!” Long Chen almost jumped out of his seat.
