Chapter 3760: Bing Po LeavesVissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

“Kill!”

Long Chen roared. The Minghong Saber danced through the air with killing intent and blew apart countless devil experts.

“World Extermination Flame Lotus!”

When the white lotus exploded, an enormous space was covered by its blast, which turned the devil race’s army into ice sculptures. Those sculptures then combusted, turning them into ashes.

Long Chen was also covered in ice and became an ice sculpture. After that, his body quivered and the ice fell off of him. He slowly sheathed the Minghong Saber.

“Huo Linger, you are getting really strong!” Huo Linger’s attack was practically apocalyptic. If she had not shown him special care with this attack, he would have been seriously injured.

Huo Linger’s World Extermination Flame Lotus now had the power of the Ice Soul. It was something that the current Long Chen was unable to resist. Huo Linger truly was growing increasingly terrifying.

“Hehe, it’s thanks to big sister Bing Po’s help. She has given me her core seed and taught me how to nourish my Ice Soul energy. She also showed me many ways to control flames!” said Huo Linger excitedly.

Long Chen was startled. He then looked at Bing Po in the primal chaos space. Her aura was extremely weak, her body so transparent that it looked like she might vanish at any moment.

“What are you up to?” demanded Long Chen in shock and anger.

Bing Po calmly said, “I did what I promised.”

“But there’s no need to do it right now!” Long Chen was vexed. Seeing her looking at him oddly, he mumbled, “I am still counting on you to scare off those old fellows.”

“You don’t detest me?” asked Bing Po.

“I never detested you,” said Long Chen, feeling startled.

“But you said it before. You don’t like me. You like the Heavenly Rainbow Fairy,” said Bing Po.

“Not liking you isn’t the same as detesting you.”

Hearing this, Bing Po lowered her hand and didn’t respond. Long Chen was speechless. This again? Why was her head so slow? Did she really need to take his words of anger seriously?

“I am a flame of heaven and earth and just a part of the cycle of the Heavenly Daos. Thus, I don’t love this world and have no gratitude toward this world. But after being with you, I feel like I’ve comprehended what emotions are, what responsibility is. Perhaps I should carry out my responsibility,” said Bing Po.

“What does that mean?” asked Long Chen.

“I went from a tiny little flame seed to a heaven-incinerating flame possessing the power to destroy heaven and earth. I have the power to control the lives and deaths of trillions of lifeforms. Perhaps this is the authority that heaven and earth bestowed upon me. But even with this authority, I never carried out my duty. Thus, I had my bitter torment. I watched as a spectator, treating myself as beyond the world. I thought that the tribulation of heaven and earth had nothing to do with me. I thought that the rise and fall of the nine heavens was not something I had to play a part in. But your arrival should be the enlightenment that heaven and earth gave me. The human race is already so depraved. You are angry. You are furious. You hate it. But you still haven’t given up. You are so small yet still have hope in your heart. Your confidence remains a solid boulder, and you want to create your ideal world. Perhaps I should find my hope as well, the hope of the world. I will carry out my duty.” Bing Po looked at the golden lotus revolving high in the air of the primal chaos space. She murmured to herself.

“What are you trying to say?” asked Long Chen. He had a bad feeling.

“I have to leave. I have to go where I should go, and I have to do what I should do.”

“Leave? Are you crazy? You are so weak right now! If you encounter someone from the Sacred Pill Hall, they’ll capture or kill you!” shouted Long Chen, not daring to believe his ears.

“Thank you for your care. But time is pressing. I must leave.”

Bing Po suddenly flew out of the primal chaos space and appeared in front of Long Chen. However, her body was completely see-through. She was clearly incredibly weak.

“Big sister, don’t leave!” Huo Linger cried out, weeping.

Bing Po rubbed Huo Linger’s cheek. “I have passed down the Ice Soul seed to you. In the future, you are me, and I am you. We will never be apart.”

Bing Po then turned to Long Chen. Her icy face actually smiled. That smile was like a flower blooming, and the very world grew warmer because of it. Because of one smile, the remnant aura of the battlefield was driven away.

“Long Chen, thank you. You taught me the human race’s emotions. Perhaps amongst all Heavenly Flames, I am the most foolish. Hopefully, one day I won’t be so detestable. Maybe I can be like the Heavenly Rainbow Fairy and see more color.”

After saying that, her body slowly vanished; only her smile hung in the air for a long time before dissipating.

“Big sister!”

Huo Linger became a sobbing mess.

Bing Po left. She left in her weakest state, so Long Chen was full of worry for her. However, he also knew just how stubborn she was. Once she had decided on something, no one could change her mind. Furthermore, she had to have her own reasons for leaving in such a rush.

“In truth, you’re not detestable at all.”

Long Chen bitterly smiled. Bing Po had already left. He knew that she couldn’t hear him.

Long Chen consoled the sobbing Huo Linger. “Don’t cry. Big sister Bing Po is only leaving temporarily. We’ll meet again.”

“I’ll definitely work hard on my cultivation. I’ll find her. I’ll share her burden,” said Huo Linger while crying.

Long Chen nodded. He had Huo Linger return to the primal chaos space and rest. Bing Po had left suddenly, catching him off guard. Now that she was gone, he felt an empty feeling inside. He also felt an unprecedented sense of crisis.

He then rushed over to two other battlefields. The enemies were all members of the devil race and all Divine Lords. Furthermore, they were all non-natives.

Jiang Lei had mostly recovered and joined forces with Long Chen to slaughter those disciples. At this moment, Long Chen had gathered over thirty Supreme Heavenly Dao Fruit.

“Boss, you destroyed so many divine weapons! It’s such a pity!” Looking at the ruined weapons, several of them being World Domain divine items, Jiang Lei picked up the fragments and sighed.

Jiang Lei was simply too used to poverty. After entering the three thousand worlds, his main weapon was nothing more than an ordinary King item that wasn’t even high grade. So, seeing these ruined World Domain divine items, he was aggrieved.

In truth, Long Chen was also somewhat aggrieved, but there was no way around it. This Minghong Saber of unknown origins was a weapon for slaughter. As long as it constantly killed lifeforms and their weapons, it could absorb their power. That allowed it to rapidly grow stronger.

When Long Chen was preparing to rush to the other battlefield, he was told that the devil experts on those battlefields were retreating.

“What’s going on? Did they learn that we’re here?” asked Jiang Lei.

“No. It is because their Devil Eye World is about to open. They have no choice but to leave.” A soft voice rang out at this moment.
