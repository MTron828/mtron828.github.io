Chapter 3584

The area in front of the gates was already packed with people, and there was no getting through them. They had clearly come to argue with Xue Yifan.

By killing people, Long Chen had infuriated them. It seemed that they weren’t planning on giving face even to the dean. They were demanding justice.

Originally, there were four elders, but now there were seven. That appearance seemed as if they were going to force the dean to hand Long Chen over.

Seven elders, all wearing the same robes. Those were robes only to be worn during an assembly. They represented the dignity of the Assembly Elders.

Other than the seven Assembly Elders, there were also hundreds of late stage World Kings. All of them were coldly glaring at Long Chen with icy killing intent.

Clearly, by killing people inside the Heavenly Dragon Divine Armor College, Long Chen had humiliated the entire college. They were unable to let such a thing pass.

Now, hundreds of late stage World Kings appeared. That kind of battle array was truly a bit frightening. However, Long Chen didn’t place these World Kings in his eyes.

The Heavenly Dragon Divine Armor College’s cultivators weren’t actually powerful themselves. Their essence, qi, and spirit were cultivated only to advance as quickly as possible. Hence, these late stage World Kings were unable to even display the World King Divine Radiance.

Their true combat power was about that of a third Heavenstage World King in the outside world. Their auras were empty. Without their battle armors, all of these people would not be able to stop a single blow from Long Chen’s saber.

Seeing how arrogant they were acting, Long Chen sneered. At this distance, if he did attack, he guaranteed that these people wouldn’t even have a chance to summon their battle armors before they were sent to see a Yama King.

This was clearly the result of living too peacefully and losing their sense of danger. To put it frankly, they were a group of old idiots.

“Where is the dean? Why has he not come out yet?” asked an Assembly Elder with a walking stick. Long Chen’s guess was correct. They were here to make demands of the dean.

“Oh, what simple and clean clothes. Are you about to take your leave?” Guo Ran acted like he didn’t understand that elder’s words, looking at him curiously.

This elder didn’t understand at first, but he quickly understood what Guo Ran was saying. He was saying that they were about to die in clothes for the dead.

“Little brute!” That elder furiously shouted.

Pow!

As a result, Guo Ran immediately stepped forward and slapped him in the face, sending him reeling to the ground.

Although Guo Ran’s movements weren’t as natural and graceful as Long Chen’s divine face-slapping art, at this distance, when they were caught off-guard, Guo Ran still managed to barely pull it off.

“You old fogey, who do you think that you’re talking to? If I didn’t have pity for your old bones, I’d beat the crap out of you right now!” Guo Ran rolled up his sleeves, pointing and cursing at that elder.

Guo Ran actually dared to attack an Assembly Elder? Everyone was stunned. Following a moment of stunned silence, furious roars rang out and they charged forward.

“Who? Who dares to even touch me?!”

Guo Ran suddenly raised a tablet, fearlessly shouting at this crowd. When they saw that tablet, everyone was dumbfounded.

“Proxy dean?”

They didn’t dare to believe their eyes. The proxy dean was equivalent to the actual dean. After ten years, through a test and evaluation, he could be promoted to the position of dean. This was a rule known to everyone in the Heavenly Dragon Divine Armor College.

“It’s definitely fake!” called out one person. They refused to believe this.

“Fake? Why don’t you take out a fake for me to look at?” Guo Ran disdainfully sneered. Seeing these people’s bulging eyes that were full of shock, he was very pleased inside. It felt like all his grievances from the last two years were finally released.

“You… you…!”

That Assembly Elder was now lifted up off the ground and pointed his cane at Guo Ran, quivering with rage to the point that he couldn’t even speak.

“You? What you? You old fogey, did your family not teach you that it’s rude to point at others? I am the dean now! Although it’s just the proxy dean, you better be more courteous to me. Otherwise, I will charge you with… with… Boss, what did they accuse you of?” Guo Ran’s mind suddenly short-circuited, and he looked back at Long Chen.

“A junior offending a senior,” said Long Chen.

Guo Ran slapped his leg. “That’s right! Fuck, now it’s finally my turn to say this, you old bastards. I am the senior, and if a junior dares to offend me, this senior will naturally slap you!”

Guo Ran was full of spirits now. It was definitely the pleased appearance of a petty person who had achieved his dream. You could see none of the calm steadiness that a dean should possess. Hence, these people clenched their teeth furiously.

They had never dreamed that the dean would bestow the proxy dean tablet to Guo Ran. Guo Ran was acting like he was number one now, not placing anyone in his eyes. And yet, there was nothing they could do.

“Bastard, choosing a proxy dean needs to go through an assembly first! We refuse to accept your status!” shouted an Assembly Elder.

“Are you an idiot? Or have you grown muddled with age? The Heavenly Dragon Divine Armor College’s proxy dean is chosen by the dean. Only the final evaluation process needs to go through the assembly. Keep yapping and I’ll slap you!” retorted Guo Ran disdainfully. Did this old fellow think that he didn’t know anything?

“Xue Yifan, get out here! What is going on- Cough, cough!” One of those ancient elders roared, but perhaps it was due to his overwhelming anger, he ended up in an intense coughing fit.

“Shout a bit louder and you’ll really be falling and needing to be buried. Don’t worry, everyone will come say goodbye. But even if you break your throat shouting, the dean personally gave me the proxy dean tablet. That is his confidence in me. Right now, whatever I say counts in the Heavenly Dragon Divine Armor College. It would be best if you are more obedient, or don’t blame me for settling our past debts!” Guo Ran stuck his hands on his waist as he sneered. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Long Chen was speechless as he watched from behind. As expected, even if you gave a monkey imperial robes, they wouldn’t look like the crown prince. He knew that Guo Ran was trying to act like an arrogant expert looking down on all others, but no matter how Long Chen looked at him, he only seemed to be a petty rogue who had won a fight.

However, Long Chen didn’t say anything. Guo Ran was now the main character, and he could do whatever he wanted to do. It wasn’t necessarily bad to let him vent for a bit.

“Guo Ran, don’t get so pleased just yet!”

Suddenly, a tall and thin man walked out of the crowd, and Long Chen narrowed his eyes slightly. This person’s Blood Qi was like a mountain, and the divine light in his eyes was electric. In terms of the power of his Blood Qi, within the Heavenly Dragon Divine Armor College, he was like a crane amongst chickens. He stood out a great deal. This was a true expert, one that shouldn’t be much inferior to Feng Xiang, Zhao Mingxuan, and the like.

If such a figure then put on battle armor, causing his power to crazily soar, he definitely couldn’t be underestimated.

“Wang Zixu, so what if I’m acting very pleased? Will you bite me?” demanded Guo Ran disdainfully.

This Wang Zixu was said to be the head of the Four Heavenly Dragon Heroes, the strongest of them all. He had always looked down on Guo Ran and applied pressure on him. They could be said to be mortal enemies.

Although all three of them suppressed Guo Ran, Wang Zixu was the one who applied the most pressure.

“I refuse to accept you. According to the academy’s rules, if someone in the same realm does not like the proxy dean, they can challenge the proxy dean to a fight. Do you dare to accept my challenge?” sneered Wang Zixu.

“Boss, I can’t beat him. What should I do?” Guo Ran suddenly transmitted to Long Chen.

“That’s fine, agree. Three days later, kill him!”

Long Chen eyed Wang Zixu and smiled slightly. Guo Ran needed to show his might, and now someone was sending themselves right over. Perhaps this was what it meant when people said ‘kind words could not advise a ghost that was about to die’.
