Chapter 4538 Brazen Idea

The sunny sky was covered by clouds, growing darker and darker with every second. At the same time, dark gusts of wind blew, sending chills straight down people’s souls.

Long Chen was extremely familiar with this feeling. In the immortal world’s Ghost Ship, he had seen sinister weapons with precisely this aura, and he had even grabbed one of those weapons and given it to Bai Shishi.

Long Chen now felt the same sensation, but this time, it was far more intense than before. As Feng You pulled Long Chen away, his gaze fixated into the distance.

“Don’t look!” shouted Feng You.

“I’m not looking, just staring in the general direction,” replied Long Chen.

“Stop messing around! You’ll go blind!” exclaimed Feng You worriedly. She didn’t even dare to look that way.

At this moment, rumbling sounds rang out, and the mountains in the surroundings broke down, as if some kind of power was crushing them. But strangely, the ground wasn’t shaking at all.

The broken bits of the mountains didn’t even make a sound as they collapsed. Instead, they turned to powder before they even got to the ground.

Long Chen jumped in shock when he saw this scene. What kind of power could instantly pulverize mountains? It looked almost as if the mountains decayed, and the wind blew them away.

At this moment, black spots started to manifest on the ground, resembling the spread of an infectious disease. The vegetation surrounding the area wilted and withered rapidly.

“This is the law of time...!”

Long Chen let out a startled cry. It was not poison or some kind of disease; rather, the time around this place was accelerating, resulting in these things unable to remain in existence.

If a cultivator were to be there, they would instantly lose their longevity. It was no wonder these people were so afraid of it.

“I told you not to look! You’ll get killed by karma!” shouted Feng You.

“I’ve seen it before, so the karma is already on me. You shouldn’t look though,” replied Long Chen.

He hadn’t just looked at it but had even taken its treasure. As the karma had long since bound him inextricably, not looking now meant nothing.

Just then, strange sounds rang out, and Long Chen saw countless lifeforms wearing rusty armor and weapons.

Feng You and the others had fled far away from the source of this strange activity and now hid behind a mountain. The other races’ experts were also hiding on that side, so things were rather tight there.

Despite having no personal space, no one dared to make a sound. Countless people were covering their ears, their faces pale as if they were in a nightmare.

Long Chen simply crept up the mountain and continued to stare. While Feng You didn’t dare to look, she didn’t stop pulling Long Chen down.

“Hey, stop pulling me. I want to see better,” grumbled Long Chen.

At this moment, many lifeforms glared at him furiously. None of them dared to make a sound to avoid drawing the attention of the strange soldiers. If they came over, all these lifeforms would be doomed.

“What are you doing?” Long Chen suddenly found that Feng You was no longer pulling him and also crawled up.

“If I die, I die. I might as well look, right?” said Feng You, clenching her teeth.

“Don’t!”

Long Chen covered her eyes with his hand. It would be troublesome if she couldn’t endure this karma.

“AH!” DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

Just then, a scream rang out in the distance, but it stopped halfway—more like it was stopped halfway as someone slew the screamer.

This unlucky bastard refused to believe the stories and took a look. As a result, his eyes instantly corroded, and he screamed in pain. To not draw the attention of the Yin Soldiers, someone immediately killed him.

“Don’t look. I’ll share my vision with you.” Long Chen pressed a finger on Feng You’s head and sent his Spiritual Strength into her mind.

Feng You didn’t resist. As Long Chen’s Spiritual Strength entered her mind-sea, what he saw also appeared in her mind.

When she saw this scene, she clenched Long Chen tightly. Only after that did she realize how intimate this action was, especially in front of all these experts of the mixed beast race, so she immediately blushed. Long Chen was also embarrassed. Fortunately, their souls were already connected, so Long Chen didn’t need to hold her.

To prevent her from opening her eyes, Long Chen took out a black cloth and tied it around her eyes. After that, Long Chen continued watching.

They heard eerie sounds as the Yin Soldiers moved like a black dragon slithering through the land, transforming the world into a hellish landscape. Black dust then billowed into the air, and the stench of death and decay filled their nostrils.

Yin Soldiers Through the Dao[1], existences that made even the Heavenly Daos quiver. When they emerged, even the laws of the Heavenly Daos avoided them. Wherever they went, life in the world ceased to exist.

Long Chen looked at the Yin Soldiers closely. Their armor and weapons had long since corroded, leaving only skeletal remains underneath. Yet, within the hollow sockets of their eye cavities, peculiar specks of light glimmered like pupils.

As Long Chen focused on the soldiers, he felt a tightening grip on his hand. Startled, he realized that Feng You was holding onto it tightly. She was rather nervous.

Long Chen smiled. It seemed that the guts of this mighty and beautiful woman weren’t that big.

Long Chen continued staring. Despite the slow pace of their footsteps, the rate of their advancement was shocking. Their slow footsteps seemed to be crossing thousands of miles a step, as if each of their steps contracted the land.

“Long Chen, have you seen them before?” whispered Feng You as she squatted beside Long Chen.

“Yes. In truth, they’re very friendly. They even gave me a treasure back then,” answered Long Chen.

“They gave you a treasure? Can I see it?” asked Feng You doubtfully.

“I gave it to someone else,” said Long Chen.

“Liar.”

Although Feng You didn’t possess a schemer’s mind, seeing that Long Chen’s smile was rather deceitful, she didn’t believe him.

“Where did you see them before?” inquired Feng You.

“On a completely broken-down ship,” answered Long Chen.

Feng You had never heard of a Ghost Ship, so when Long Chen said this, she was even more sure that he was just being a braggart.

However, just as he answered, her jaw dropped in disbelief.

“A Ghost Ship?”

Long Chen was also surprised. A giant Ghost Ship had appeared in the air above the Yin Soldiers, slowly flying above them.

Feng You was even more taken aback as she had never seen a Ghost Ship before. She had never even heard of such a thing.

“I have a brazen idea. Do you want to go together?” asked Long Chen suddenly.
