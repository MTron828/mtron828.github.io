Chapter 4638 Once More Encountering the Black Rock Nine Underworld Python

The enormous banner displayed a prominent black python, its tongue protruding and its head held aloft, exuding a strong demonic qi.

“The Black Rock Nine Underworld Python?”

When Long Chen saw that image, he immediately recognized it. After all, he had clashed against the Black Rock Nine Underworld Python race during his journey alongside the mixed beast race.

“Boss, you know them? They were among those who aided the Celestial race in attacking us,” said Guo Ran and the others, surprised that Long Chen also knew them.

“Enemies really do meet often. I didn’t think I’d run into them here, the Void Spirit World. Well, it’s quite simple. Let’s wipe them out.” Long Chen waved his hand.

There was no need for a battle plan or scouting. The Dragonblood Legion simply charged over.

“Who’s there?!”

When the Dragonblood Legion appeared, the Black Rock Nine Underworld Python race’s experts shouted vigilantly. However, when they looked closer, their shouts became cries of terror.

“How... how can you still be alive?!”

Those experts were terrified upon recognizing the Dragonblood Legion, as they had personally seen Guo Ran and the others being forced into the Yan Xu Gate.

Their return was like the appearance of the death gods from the depths of hell. The Dragonblood Legion's terrifying gazes caused their very souls to tremble. With haste, they released a warning signal before retreating to the rear. In truth, they possessed no bravery whatsoever.

“Boss, let me show you my new move. Give me some pointers.” At this moment, Yue Zifeng suddenly stepped forward. As he grasped the hilt of his sword, a sharp sword intent started to brew, causing heaven and earth to flicker and the stars to sway.

“Wavecutter!”

Yue Zifeng's sword soared through the air, unleashing a torrent of Sword Qi in a crescent moon pattern that cleaved the very fabric of reality in two.

The endless mountain range shattered, revealing a bottomless ditch in the ground below. As the land split asunder, a plethora of shimmering ores was unearthed, while countless experts mining them met their demise in an instant.

Yet, the most chilling sight was the colossal crack that tore through the void itself. Long Chen knew that this crack in the void wouldn’t heal without the passage of eons. Truly, Yue Zifeng's prowess was nothing short of terrifying.

“It’s that sword cultivator! Run!”

Countless experts came out and fled upon spotting Yue Zifeng.

After all, many of their experts had died at Yue Zifeng’s hands. Other than the Celestial race’s junior race leader, Luo Changsheng, no one else could block a single attack from him.

Through that one battle, Yue Zifeng had terrified everyone. Without Luo Changsheng's intervention, they would have all been slaughtered.

Hence, when the Black Rock Nine Underworld Python race’s experts saw Yue Zifeng again, they fled for their lives. Even if their own race’s pinnacle expert were present, they would still stand no chance against Yue Zifeng.

“Keep dreaming!” Bai Xiaole clenched his teeth furiously. As he swiftly formed hand seals, his eyes blazed with divine light. In the sky above, a colossal eye with a six-petaled flower diagram materialized, radiating immense power.

As it manifested, its colossal barrier enveloped the entire expanse of heaven and earth. Countless experts of the Black Rock Nine Underworld Python race attempted to flee, only to be abruptly teleported back to the core just as they thought that they were about to escape.

In the previous battle, Bai Xiaole had unleashed all of his formidable techniques, yet even then, he had been unable to alter the outcome. The sense of inadequacy gnawed at him deeply.

Bai Shishi was the same. They were the top experts of the academy, but against these powerful foes, they could only rely on Yue Zifeng. The feeling of powerlessness infuriated them.

Now seeing those enemies again, they were particularly vengeful. Bai Xiaole directly trapped all of them here. Meanwhile, Bai Shishi’s golden sword danced, unleashing waves of golden light that slaughtered those experts.

The Dragonblood warriors also started a slaughter. For them, there was no need for any direction or formation. Although the Black Rock Nine Underworld Python’s experts outnumbered them a hundred to one, the Dragonblood warriors were just too strong.

Fueled by their own wrath, the Dragonblood warriors fought with a singular focus, venting all their pent-up fury. The experts of the Black Rock Nine Underworld Python race stood no chance, akin to sheep led to the slaughter in the face of their relentless attacks.

These experts roared, howled, and even begged for mercy, but the Dragonblood warriors ignored all their pleas. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

Long Chen and Yu Qingxuan simply watched. Yue Zifeng, too, refrained from further action after delivering a single devastating blow. Guo Ran, Xia Chen, Gu Yang, Li Qi, and Song Mingyuan joined the fray, launching a series of attacks that swiftly dispatched the Black Rock Nine Underworld Python race’s strongest experts before halting their assault, leaving the remaining enemies to the Dragonblood warriors.

The Dragonblood warriors had just become seven-star Doyens thanks to the Heavenly Dao Fruits. Fueled by their insatiable thirst for vengeance and battle, their fury erupted uncontrollably. In the blink of an eye, the ground was littered with many corpses.

The Sublime Spirit race’s women were also standing behind Long Chen. However, they weren’t watching the battle and just looked in the other direction. It seemed that they were very uncomfortable with killing.

Although they harbored deep resentment toward the Black Rock Nine Underworld Python race for the loss of their comrades, their hatred wasn’t so intense that that they had to resort to killing.

In this regard, they differed from the human race. According to human customs, a blood debt had to be repaid with blood. The human race would not forgive others so easily.

“Boss, how was Zifeng’s attack? When you weren’t here, Yue Zifeng was our ultimate fighter,” Guo Ran exclaimed, gazing at the devastated landscape with reverence.

Yue Zifeng was truly like a monster. This time, in particular, his prowess on the battlefield had left everyone in awe.

“Don’t spout nonsense. I’m genuinely seeking your guidance, boss,” Yue Zifeng protested, his cheeks flushing with embarrassment.

Guo Ran felt equally sheepish. The way he said it, it was as if Yue Zifeng was trying to become the leader over Long Chen.

Long Chen laughed and patted Yue Zifeng on the shoulder. “Since we’re all brothers, why can’t we joke? However, since you’ve shown off your abilities, it’s my turn now!”

Yue Zifeng and the others' eyes lit up with anticipation, each of them holding their breath in eager anticipation.
