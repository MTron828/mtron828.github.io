Chapter 4207 Get a Rod for the Dog That Doesn’t Bite

Everyone jumped in fright as that figure moved with such incredible speed that it was nearly imperceptible. All they saw was that this figure was throwing itself at Tang Wan-er.

The Wind Sect’s experts were startled. But just as they were about to attack this figure, they heard a delighted cry.

“Big Sister Wan-er, I’ve missed you!”

The figure of a young maiden appeared in Tang Wan-er’s embrace. Seeing her, Tang Wan-er also cried out in delight.

“Cloud!”

Cloud had always been very close to Tang Wan-er, mainly due to their shared childlike personalities. Therefore, aside from Meng Qi, Tang Wan-er was the closest person to Cloud.

Cloud excitedly hugged Tang Wan-er’s neck and kissed her cheek. She was like an excited child.

“Good little sister, go rest for now. Big sister wants to beat someone up,” said Tang Wan-er, patting Cloud’s shoulder warmly.

“Big sister, who do you want to beat up? I’ll help you!” exclaimed Cloud.Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

“Sisters, what is going on? You want to fight someone as soon as you reunite? Is it to celebrate our reunion?” Just then, a fairy-like voice rang out.

When this beautiful figure walked over, the tense and dark atmosphere instantly transformed. Every woman who saw her felt ashamed of their inferiority, having never imagined that such a beautiful woman could exist in this world. Even as she stood there in front of them all, it was as though she weren't real—more like a fairy emerged from a painting, a transcendent and sacred presence that seemed out of place in this mundane world.

“Big Sister Meng Qi!” Tang Wan-er threw herself into Meng Qi’s embrace and wept like an aggrieved child who had finally found a way to vent.

Meng Qi smiled and gently stroked Tang Wan-er’s hair. She softly said, “Alright, today is the day of our reunion. We should be happy.” She then whispered, “Long Chen has been in the immortal world for so long. Thus, for us to only gain one sister shows that he has restrained himself. We have to learn to be content.”

Meng Qi understood Tang Wan-er far too well. Tang Wan-er’s jealous nature was completely unleashed upon seeing Long Chen having so many women around her. With nowhere else to vent her fury, she chose to challenge Xu Xin-er.

After all, Long Chen didn’t just have Yu Qingxuan and Bai Shishi beside him. There was also Mu Qingyun, Luo Bing, Luo Ning, Zhong Ling, Zhong Xiu, and quite a few other women, which triggered her jealousy.

She actually thought that Long Chen had found so many new lovers in the immortal world. Was he trying to make a competition between the Martial Heaven Continent’s and the immortal world’s wives?

“Are you sure?” Tang Wan-er looked into Meng Qi’s eyes. Hearing that only one newcomer was Long Chen’s lover made her feel much better.

People were just like that. Happiness was based on comparison. Even if she had only seen Bai Shishi by Long Chen’s side upon her arrival, she would still be jealous.

However, after seeing the worst-case scenario and then learning that the truth wasn’t as bad, she instantly felt much better. In fact, she didn’t even feel bad about Bai Shishi.

“Of course it’s true. Foolish girl, do you not know who Long Chen is? Someone as powerful as him, who knows how to make girls happy, he’s like honey drawing bees. How many women can resist his allure? Actually, that girl in the golden robes, her character’s a bit like yours. In the future, we’ll all be sisters, so don’t be petty with her,” implored Meng Qi in a quiet whisper.

“Alright. I’ll listen to you.” Tang Wan-er obediently nodded. Amongst all the sisters, she listened to Meng Qi the most.

“And who are you?” demanded Xu Xin-er, an intense jealousy in her eyes. She had always been confident in her looks. However, seeing Bai Shishi, Yu Qingxuan, Dong Mingyu, Tang Wan-er, and Ye Zhiqiu had shaken her confidence. In terms of looks, she couldn’t reach their level. But even if her looks were slightly worse than theirs, she still had her own immense power and background. Hence, she thought that she was better than them.

However, when Meng Qi came, she was like a heavenly fairy, her transcendent air causing all other women to lose their splendor.

Even the Xu family’s experts were staring at her, clearly won over by her air. As both men and women were toppled by Meng Qi’s noble air, Xu Xin-er was not able to suppress her rage any longer.

However, Meng Qi actually shook her head. “I am nothing more than a nameless soldier, so I won’t report my name. I am Long Chen’s unmarried wife. If you have any issues, please find my husband.”

The sound of countless hearts breaking rang out. This peerless fairy was already taken.

“Junior sister Bai Shishi greets big sisters.” At this time, Bai Shishi stepped forward and cupped her fists.

Meng Qi and the others returned her greeting. After that, Meng Qi warmly held Bai Shishi’s hand. “Ever since the three thousand worlds, I’ve missed you. Let me introduce you to everyone.”

Meng Qi dragged Bai Shishi over, introducing her to Dong Mingyu, Tang Wan-er, Ye Zhiqiu, and Cloud one by one.

She also pulled Yu Qingxuan over, as she felt particular care for Yu Qingxuan. However, Dong Mingyu, Ye Zhiqiu, and Meng Qi didn’t mention anything about the Martial Heaven Continent.

Back then, in order to awaken Long Chen, Yu Qingxuan had gone through a thousand reincarnations, a feat that shattered all their hearts. They also knew that Long Chen hadn’t told her about the past in order to make up for what he owed her. He didn’t want her to feel any burden.

Long Chen wasn’t worried about the others; his only worry was Tang Wan-er. If she were to get petty, things would become very awkward, and none of his abilities could resolve that.

Fortunately, it turned out that they were getting along very well, talking and laughing. Actually, from the start, they didn’t even say a word to Long Chen, not even greeting him.

“Boss, it’s like you’re not involved,” laughed Guo Ran.

“Shut up!” raged Long Chen.

“You deserve it. Who told you to get a rod for the dog that doesn’t bite?” said Tang Wan-er.

“You’re the dog!” raged Long Chen. This girl’s guts were growing increasingly big. She was actually cursing him in a roundabout manner.

Meng Qi and the others laughed. This one joke instantly made everyone feel closer.

Suddenly, the martial stage rumbled. Everyone then looked toward the sky and saw a shocking scene.
