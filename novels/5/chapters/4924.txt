Chapter 4913 Devil Head Appears

Mo Nian’s words caused countless experts’ eyes to widen in shock. Previously, Huo Qianwu had been forcibly dragged out of Heaven Screen Mountain by the vice hall master. When Huo Qianwu appeared, they only saw a figure covered in flames. However, that figure did seem odd, almost as if… she wasn’t wearing clothes.

They had previously seen Huo Qianwu fight Long Chen. At that time, with the Blaze Dragon Bone Whip and the Thousand Phoenix Feather Dress, she had appeared almighty, drawing the envy of even Heaven Saints.

However, when Huo Qianwu came out, her Thousand Phoenix Feather Dress and Blaze Dragon Bone Whip were gone like someone had robbed her and tossed her out.

At first, people didn’t know what had happened. After all, they didn’t dare to anger the vice hall master by asking. However, when Mo Nian spoke, they realized what had happened. It seemed that the ones to rob Huo Qianwu of her clothes were these two right here.

If anyone else had said this, they might not have believed it. However, these people had witnessed Long Chen fight Huo Qianwu and seen her fleeing for her life. Now, with Mo Nian’s revelation and the murderous gazes from the Flame Divine Hall’s experts, they knew he was telling the truth.

Mo Nian’s words were indeed provocative, and he said this specifically to draw their attention. He continued, “Hey, where is that girl Huo Qianwu? Long Chen stripped her of her clothes and took her whip. Does she not even have the courage to avenge herself?”

Everyone’s gaze turned to Long Chen, filled with shock. Quite a few people also shot him a gaze filled with envy.

After all, the two divine weapons of Huo Qianwu’s were top-grade Heaven Saint divine weapons, and countless Heaven Saints would never come in contact with such treasures in their lifetime. Hearing that two of them were in Long Chen’s possession, they instantly felt the urge to kill him for them.

However, as soon as that thought rose, it was extinguished. They knew that the Flame Divine Hall would definitely pursue Long Chen to get the treasures back.

Such treasures were things they couldn’t expose, even if they did manage to obtain them. If the Flame Divine Hall discovered they had tried to keep the treasures hidden, they would be hunted down.

“Vice Hall Master, please permit me to teach a lesson to these two arrogant brats!” requested Jiang Yiban, who was standing beside the vice hall master.

“Ignore them. They’re no more than two hopping clowns. They can’t do anything. Just keep an eye on Xing Wujiang. He’s the crucial piece here,” replied the vice hall master casually.

The vice hall master looked indifferent, but the throbbing veins on the back of his hands betrayed his true feelings. After all, Huo Qianwu was the disciple he was proudest of. That was why she had his spiritual mark on her.

For her to be insulted, defeated, and have her weapons stolen, the vice hall master seethed with anger. In truth, he was the one who couldn’t wait to kill Long Chen right now.

However, he endured as he couldn’t afford to be distracted. His target was Xing Wujiang. There could not be the slightest mishap in this matter.

Long Chen stood quietly by Mo Nian’s side. All of a sudden, he quivered slightly, and a light flashed in his eyes.

“Have you recovered?” asked Mo Nian silently.

Long Chen nodded ever so slightly. Just now, he had entered a half-meditative state to recover faster.

With the aid of his medicinal pills, he quickly restored his dragon blood power to its peak condition. The Dragon Soul Body Forging Art was really incredible.

Mo Nian said, “Good. Help guard me. I’m going to prepare some of my stock. I’ll kill that vice hall master.” 

This time, it was Mo Nian’s turn to secretly get to work. Although Mo Nian had just undergone an immense battle, he hadn’t used up too much energy. Even against the devil expert, he had been defending more, trying to disrupt his enemy’s techniques more than attack.

Long Chen didn’t know what Mo Nian was up to, but he did as Mo Nian said.

Mo Nian acted far more exaggeratedly than Long Chen. He crossed his legs and sat midair, closing his eyes and entering a meditative state. Long Chen almost cursed him.

As expected, this action drew everyone’s attention. The Flame Divine Hall’s experts wanted to immediately attack him.L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Don’t fall for it!” ordered the vice hall master. “You’re going to fall for such a simple trick? What foolishness!”

Those experts instantly went still after being chided by the vice hall master.

Upon looking at where they were standing, Long Chen was taken aback. The Flame Divine Hall had thirty-six Heaven Saints, including Jiang Yiban, standing in a specific formation. It was no wonder the vice hall master didn’t allow them to attack—he was wary of disrupting this crucial formation.

Could it be… they are also targeting the corpse? Long Chen suddenly had a troubling thought. It seemed that everything that had transpired in Heaven Screen Mountain had been part of a larger plan.

In addition to the Flame Divine Hall’s experts and their allies, there were countless other observers in the distance. They had no intention of joining the battle but seemed eager to witness the events unfolding before them.

Suddenly, a disturbance arose from the crowd as dozens of young disciples ran over. Someone immediately shouted, “What are you doing, coming out so early?!”

These were the disciples who had entered Heaven Screen Mountain. One of them panted and said, “The laws within Heaven Screen Mountain have collapsed. The ground there is sinking, and miasma is coming out of it. We weren’t able to bear it, so we had to leave.”

“There was such a thing?”

Following that, they saw more and more people flying out of Heaven Screen Mountain. Some of them were cursing furiously, angry about how they had waited so long to enter Heaven Screen Mountain, only for things to collapse before they could get anything.

In the past, Heaven Screen Mountain would be open for at least half a year, so most people were in no rush to immediately search for treasures. They would instead look for some undiscovered areas. However, unexpectedly, Heaven Screen Mountain was expelling them so quickly. Unbeknownst to them, it wasn’t the mountain itself expelling them, but a devil corpse had broken the laws of Heaven Screen Mountain. With the balance ruined, it was collapsing.

More and more experts charged out of Heaven Screen Mountain. When they saw the enormous devil corpse, they all turned pale and asked their seniors what was going on.

“I’m done!”

Mo Nian’s sudden movement startled Long Chen, prompting him to leap up as well. Before he could inquire about Mo Nian’s actions, the void ruptured, giving way to a colossal head and a huge seal tearing through space. 

When that head appeared, Long Chen and Mo Nian’s hearts clenched. The most critical juncture had come.
