Chapter 1933: 1933

“Sorry... to disappoint everyone...” Gu Yang barely had the energy to speak .

“Is something wrong with this trial? The real Gu Yang is exhausted, but the fake one isn’t even breathing hard . The difference is too great,” questioned Li Qi .

Gu Yang hadn’t made any mistakes from the start . Even while suppressed, he hadn’t given up a single chance to counterattack, but he was still defeated .

“In truth, the fake Gu Yang also doesn’t have much energy . It’s just that the fake won’t act weak,” explained Yue Xiaoqian . “Gu Yang, you’re very amazing to have lasted a full four hours . I’m ashamed of my own time . ”

Yue Xiaoqian’s best record was only half an incense stick’s time longer than Gu Yang, and that was after she had challenged the Devil Blood Pool several times . She had plenty of experience, while this was Gu Yang’s first time .

Suddenly, at this time, Guo Ran walked over with his chest puffed out, patting Gu Yang on the shoulder . “It’s fine, don’t be depressed . If you’ve been defeated, then leave it to me . ”

“You . ”

Everyone looked at Guo Ran with confusion . They even suspected that this Guo Ran was a fake .

When they encountered any trial, Guo Ran would dodge it if he could . The Guo Ran that always rolled on the ground begging for release could also say something so heroic?

“It seems you’ve all misunderstood me . Do you really think I’m a coward? You question my bravery in challenging the Devil Blood Pool?” sighed Guo Ran .

“No... I don’t question your bravery in challenging the Devil Blood Pool...” Li Qi shook his head .

“Hehe, that’s right . ” Guo Ran nodded .

“ . . . I question whether you have any bravery at all . ”

“What the...”

Guo Ran almost coughed up blood . He loudly said, “I’ll tell you the truth . Before, I was intentionally acting cowardly . Do you know why?”

Everyone shook their heads, looking at Guo Ran suspiciously . Why was it that today’s Guo Ran was like a different person? Had he been possessed?

Guo Ran heroically announced, “Alright, then I’ll tell you . I acted cowardly for boss . In my heart, boss is like a god . As they say, the sky cannot have two suns, and the people cannot have two masters . I don’t want my light to overshadow boss...”

“Guo Ran, Guo Ran . As your brother, I’m not trying to criticize you, but don’t you think you’re bragging a bit too hard? Do you even believe yourself? Ask your own conscience if you believe it,” said Song Mingyuan .

“Ah, well when you put it that way...”

Guo Ran suddenly felt that things had taken a turn, and that if he continued, he would be exposed . He glanced at Long Chen who was looking at him contemptuously . Spiritually, he scolded, “Stop messing around . If you don’t have that skill, don’t force it . There’s no need for this . Just start your display . ”

Guo Ran cleared his throat and said, “Alright, I won’t joke . Gu Yang’s defeat is because he lacked one thing . Inside his heart, he didn’t feel confident in definitely winning . Why? Because he was facing himself . If he was facing anyone else, anyone from the Corrupt path, the ancient races, the Xuan Beasts, even if they were equally matched in power, I believe that Gu Yang would definitely win . Why? Because he has no other choice but to beat them . Defeat would signify death, and death would implicate the lives of even more of his brothers . A person can go all-out against others, but going all-out against themselves? That’s the most monstrous aspect of the Devil Blood Pool . It creates a duplicate of yourself, which makes you feel like it’s unfathomable . It sees through your techniques, making you feel helpless . The lack of confidence you feel is the main problem . The duplicate of the Devil Blood Pool will immediately use a warmed-up one-hundred-percent-power attack . That’s actually a psychological blow . Using an attack that surpasses common sense will leave a shadow on your heart . A voice will repeat in the depths of your heart that you cannot possibly defeat your opponent . The moment that shadow appears, you’ll already be defeated . Gu Yang only had any chance of defeating himself in the first hour . After that, as he grew weary, the shadow on his heart only expanded, and the effort of continuing to fight against that shadow exhausted more energy . That’s why the fake Gu Yang seemed to still possess energy, but the real Gu Yang couldn’t last any longer . ”

After hearing all this, everyone’s expressions changed . Guo Ran was previously only capable of saying some big nonsensical words, but now his words were all reasonable .

“In truth, you’ve been fooled by my outer appearance . I’m actually a very low-key person, but today, I’ll show you my true self . Brothers, just prepare yourselves . I don’t want my display to cause the whole world to know my great name . I want to maintain my original heart . ” Guo Ran stepped forward bravely toward the Devil Blood Pool . “I’ll show you just how you should defeat yourself and your heart-devil . Keep a close watch on my movements . I’ll trouble sister Xiaoqian to activate the trial for me . ”

Everyone looked at each other, feeling like today’s Guo Ran was very odd . Yue Xiaoqian looked at Long Chen and he helplessly nodded .

Guo Ran had ended up adding some of his own poser spice into the plan that they had discussed, resulting in people not fully believing him .

Guo Ran’s figure vanished, reappearing in a giant bubble within the Devil Blood Pool . He was standing atop an ancient martial stage, just like Gu Yang had .

Guo Ran summoned his armor . Only his face was revealed . He had just appeared when another figure slowly condensed from blood mist not far from him . That figure was identical to Guo Ran, with even that wretched smile being the same .

Long Chen couldn’t help shaking his head . Even if you gave a monkey imperial robes, it wouldn’t look like a prince . This kind of poser style didn’t suit Guo Ran . He looked out of place, making Long Chen even regret appointing Guo Ran as the main character of this display .

“Everyone, watch closely!” shouted Guo Ran . His face also became covered in his golden armor .

Suddenly, the opposing Guo Ran slashed its sabers . It was incredibly quick, like a golden bolt of lightning .

The sudden burst of power came without any warning, none whatsoever, and its power instantly reached the pinnacle .

BOOM!

Guo Ran raised his own sabers to block, only to be sent flying . He tumbled back, looking even worse off than Gu Yang .

Guo Ran stabbed his sabers into the martial stage, creating two large cuts . He barely stabilized himself before the fake Guo Ran charged over . A pair of golden wings appeared on its back, and its sabers rapidly spun as it charged over .

“How powerful!” Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

Although the duplicate Guo Ran was using the same techniques as Guo Ran, its battle style was different . It was fiercer .

Guo Ran was forced back, but his power began to rise bit by bit . Suddenly, with a cry, the fake Guo Ran came to a stop and was then forced back by Guo Ran . The two of them both retreated at the same time .

“After blocking the first wave of attacks, raise your power to your peak . Whether the other side is your enemy or yourself, crush them!”

Guo Ran went on the offense, facing his opponent’s attacks with his own . Two golden monstrosities were clashing crazily . Their colliding weapons and mechanisms were like thunder, while their bodies were like golden lightning .

“Do you still remember what boss said? If you want to get stronger, you need to find a reason to get stronger . Why do you want to be strong? Have you already forgotten? It’s to protect those we cherish in our hearts . No matter who our opponent is, even if it’s a god or devil, they can’t be allowed to take away the people we love . Our lives aren’t our own . If they want to kill us, then they want to harm our beloved . Even if we’re facing ourselves, we have to erupt with our fury . Roar and proclaim that we are undefeatable!”

Guo Ran shouted as he fought . His voice contained a metallic sound to it . The current Guo Ran seemed to have been possessed by Long Chen, having a kind of domineering air to look down on the nine heavens .

He crazily attacked his opponent, but the two of them were equally matched . Neither side was able to suppress the other .

“Erase the fear and apprehensions inside your heart . Don’t be suppressed by your opponent . This is just the first step . In this kind of state, you’ll simply be fighting over who runs out of energy first . You’ll only have a fifty percent chance of winning . However, what we want isn’t fifty percent but a one hundred percent chance of winning! At this time, we have to fight with our true power . We are the great Dragonblood warriors, the number one legion of the Martial Heaven Continent . We have our own pride . Each day, we have to do everything we can to get stronger . We’re stronger than we were yesterday, we’re stronger than we were an hour ago, we’re stronger than we were a minute ago . We have to be stronger than we were a blink ago . As for our opponent, it’s just a replicated version that won’t get stronger . We get stronger with each breath, so tell me, what reason do you have to not win? Kill!”

Guo Ran’s sabers suddenly blazed with light . He seemed to go crazy, unleashing a tempest of attacks .

His aura gradually rose even higher, and his armor grew brighter . He seemed to be undergoing some kind of transformation, and he was actually constantly forcing his opponent back .

“So that’s how!” Li Qi clenched his fist, feeling his blood heating up . He wanted to go try this trial right now .

Continuous rumbling rang out as Guo Ran went all-out . His opponent was constantly knocked back .

The distant experts of the original devil race were staring with shock, their own blood heating up . In the past, they had felt too much reverence for the Devil Blood Pool, and the idea that the only thing they could do was last longer against it had become a deep-rooted belief . They had stopped believing that they could defeat themselves . Now that Guo Ran was showing them the way, their minds became clear . They saw an unprecedented world for themselves .

“No matter who it is, those who block me will die!”

Guo Ran roared and slammed his sabers together . His opponent, who was still reeling from the previous blow, had its neck severed by Guo Ran’s dual sabers .
