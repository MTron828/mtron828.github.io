Chapter 4708 Wrongly Accusing a Good Person

When Long Chen stepped through the gate, countless sharp gazes swept over him. He found the guest hall packed to the brim with people. However, it wasn’t entirely accurate to say they were all human. Among them were various lifeforms from other races, some of whom resembled humans but emitted a distinct Blood Qi with a different aura.

The fluctuations coming from these people carried an ancient aura, accompanied by a swirling primal chaos qi that was different from any other experts Long Chen had encountered before.

In the guest hall, there were men and women of various ages. The young ones possessed auras comparable to Long Chen’s, indicating they were initial Divine Venerates. As for the elderly individuals, they exuded the intimidating presence of Sage Kings.

All these people had arrogant expressions, as if they looked down their noses at him. However, when Long Chen walked in, their pupils shrank in surprise.

However, what truly shocked them wasn’t Long Chen himself, but the giant black saber strapped to his back. Dragonbone Evilmoon hung diagonally across Long Chen’s back, its length surpassing even his height. Its form was strikingly conspicuous, but it was the sinister aura emanating from it that instantly captured everyone’s attention.

“Hehe, this time, there should be a blood sacrifice!” Evilmoon chuckled with bloodthirst.

“Don’t mess around. Are a bunch of small fries worthy to become your first meal? Don’t embarrass yourself,” retorted Long Chen. Evilmoon was far too impatient.

Starting a slaughter was no problem to him, but it depended on the place. In the High Firmament Academy, slaughtering guests in the guest hall was definitely taboo. Others might be able to, but Long Chen couldn’t as he was a branch dean of the academy.

“Who are you?!”

As soon as Long Chen walked in, someone got in his way. In this fully packed hall, there wasn’t enough space for him. As Long Chen was only a Divine Venerate, they viewed him as nothing more than an ordinary disciple.

Immediately, the one blocking Long Chen was sent flying out of the hall by a slap in the face. He tumbled down some stairs, passing out without even making a sound.

“You...!” The fact that Long Chen attacked one of them enraged everyone.

“Dean Long Chen!”

Just then, a delighted cry rang out, startling these experts. This youngster was the dean of the High Firmament Academy? Did they mishear?

“Boss, didn’t we agree that you’d let me do it?” transmitted Little Nine slyly.

“Fuck, it was an instinctual reaction. Next time, be faster.” Only then did Long Chen recall that it was a loss of status for him to beat someone here.

“Dean Long Chen, you’ve come!” One of the old administrators of the academy almost wept in relief. The academy’s real higher-ups were all gone, and this administrator was nothing more than a weak World King. How could he receive these guests?

Would these arrogant fellows even care about a weak old fellow like him? All he could do was smile and nod at them, saying that the higher-ups would soon come out of seclusion.

However, he actually had no idea when the higher-ups would be back. The assistant dean had simply told him to welcome everyone, and he suspected that the assistant dean was intentionally setting him up for failure.

In front of these ominous monsters, he could only smile and endure their curses, hoping to last long enough for reinforcements to arrive. He also prayed that these people wouldn’t dare to kill him here.

Seeing so many people standing blankly in the way, the Violet Pupil Nine Tail Fox on Bai Xiaole’s shoulder shouted, “Scram!”

A violet qi wave spread with this shout, and quite a few people were instantly dazed by its voice. Shocked, they hastily opened a path.

Long Chen nodded. This little fox was sharper than Bai Xiaole; its timing was good. Long Chen then swaggered toward the center of the hall.

The administrator hastily went forward to greet him. Even as the person in charge here, he could at most receive the guests and wasn’t qualified to sit here. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

When everyone saw the administrator acting like this, their guts grew. One Sage King even sat down on the central seat, clearly trying to take over as host.

When Long Chen arrived at the seat, the Violet Pupil Nine Tail Fox shouted at the Sage King sitting there.

“Scram!”

“You are the High Firmament Academy’s dean? I don’t believe it,” sneered that elder, continuing to sit there with no intention of moving.

“Xiaole, Heavenly Pupil Deathblow!” shouted Little Nine. After that, the mark of the Six Dao Heavenly Eyes appeared in its eyes, as well as Bai Xiaole’s.

The elder instantly had a bad feeling. Just as he was about to counterattack, blood suddenly sprayed from his mouth, and he tumbled off the seat.

Meanwhile, Long Chen didn’t even look at him. He simply walked up as the elder tumbled down past his feet.

Unexpectedly, when this elder rolled past Long Chen’s feet, his neck coincidentally struck the tip of Evilmoon’s blade.

Dragonbone Evilmoon was enormous, hanging diagonally on Long Chen’s back with its hilt positioned above his right shoulder. The tip of its blade was only a few inches from the ground, showcasing its imposing size and formidable presence.

When the elder’s neck passed by the tip of Evilmoon, he instantly became a headless corpse. Without a sound, his life ended just like that.

All these experts were incomparably shocked. That was a Sage King! Even if his body was completely destroyed, his Yuan Spirit would survive, and even if the Yuan Spirit was destroyed, his will would remain.

However, at this moment, his aura was completely gone. In other words, he was truly dead. Seeing this scene, the disciples led by this elder were so shocked and enraged.

“You really have no integrity!” scolded Long Chen.

“It has nothing to do with me. Everyone saw it clearly, alright? He was the one who ran into me. Don’t wrongly accuse a good person,” answered Evilmoon with an innocent tone.

Long Chen couldn’t be bothered to argue with it. Although Evilmoon had covered it up flawlessly, Long Chen refused to believe that a Sage King would lose his head and his life just because of tripping. Furthermore, since when was Evilmoon a good person?

Anyway, it wasn’t the time to argue with Evilmoon. Acting like that was just an accident, Long Chen swung his robes, placed Evilmoon beside him, and slowly sat down.

“Fool, hurry up and pour some tea! Use your brain!” hissed Little Nine into Bai Xiaole’s ear.

“Tea? I don’t know how! I don’t have any tea!” Bai Xiaole panicked.

“Idiot! Even if you don’t have tea, just use water!” cursed Little Nine.

Before Bai Xiaole could move, the attendant hastily poured a cup of fragrant tea for Long Chen. Long Chen then took a light sip and put the cup down, his gaze coldly sweeping over these experts.

“Who were the ones shouting just now? Come forward!”
