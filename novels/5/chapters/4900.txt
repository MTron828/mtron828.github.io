Chapter 4889 Huo Linger’s Plan

Within the primal chaos space, Huo Linger was holding one of the ancient phoenix true feathers. At this moment, flames rose on top of it, and it was vaguely possible to see a phoenix flying within each flame.

“Huo Linger, what are you doing?” asked Long Chen.

“Big Brother Long Chen! I’m awakening its spirit and using the Sun Flame to commune with it. It has already submitted to me. Now I’m giving it some benefits so that it’ll be fully loyal to me,” explained Huo Linger.

“You’re getting smarter. You even know the power of kindness,” praised Long Chen as he rubbed Huo Linger’s head.

As a result, the phoenix figure inside the flames spat out a wave of fire at him.

“Hey!” Huo Linger raised her hand, sucking in the flames so that they didn’t hurt Long Chen. “That’s my big brother! If you dare to be rude to my big brother, I’ll destroy you right now!”

Hearing this, the phoenix figure became calm. However, its gaze still wasn’t very friendly. Perhaps it had a grudge against Long Chen because he had ripped it off of the Thousand Phoenix Feather Dress.

It was now absorbing the Fusang Tree’s flames to strengthen itself, its aura growing increasingly powerful. The feather’s light was shining brighter, like it was a phoenix being reborn.

The original masters of these true feathers had perished, but their wills remained. As long as their true feathers lasted, their wills would not disperse.

Before this, these feathers were nourished on the Thousand Phoenix Feather Dress. However, the Flame Divine Hall never managed to fully satisfy their hunger. After all, the flame energy they provided was split into a thousand portions, which was only enough to maintain the feathers’ divinity. Strengthening them was impossible, as Huo Qianwu couldn’t feed them that much.

However, in the primal chaos space, there were three thousand Fusang Trees creating an ocean’s worth of Sun Flame. Finally, these feathers had an inexhaustible feast before them.

“Why aren’t you subduing the other two as well?” asked Long Chen.

Huo Linger smiled. “Those two are very prideful and refuse to submit. But this fellow is smarter. I’m going to raise it as my core flame feather. Later on, I’ll use it to subdue the other two. That will make it easier. Once all three of them are completely under my command, Big Brother Long Chen, you should release them.”

“Release them?” Long Chen cocked his head at her.

“Hehe, that’s right, release them. I’ll make it seem as if they managed to escape on their own. Then they’ll return to the Thousand Phoenix Feather Dress, and the three of them will incite a rebellion among the other nine hundred and ninety-seven ancient phoenix true feathers,” Huo Linger giggled, a crafty light in her eyes.

“Haha, you really are a little minx. You’re getting smarter. However, are you not afraid of them not returning?” asked Long Chen.

“Not at all. In truth, they’re very pitiful. Huo Qianwu can’t even fill their stomachs. As a result, they can’t release their full power. We have what they need right here, so why would they refuse? The main problem is that the ancient phoenix race is very prideful. They won’t submit so easily. However, I’m sure that in front of this enticing bait, they’ll make the smartest decision for themselves. Hehe, and it won’t just be the Thousand Phoenix Feather Dress. I believe the Blaze Dragon Bone Whip will make that choice as well,” replied Huo Linger, her smile like that of a beautiful little fox. Long Chen hadn’t expected her intelligence to grow so high.

However, Long Chen did feel like this was a bit dangerous as Huo Qianwu had absolute control over the Thousand Phoenix Feather Dress. It wouldn’t be so easy for it to defect. Even so, he didn’t say anything further about his worries. He viewed Huo Linger and Lei Linger as his little sisters. If they wanted to do something, he let them. Although those three feathers were precious, he didn’t mind losing them if things didn’t turn out as planned.

Long Chen focused on his recovery. While the Scarlet Dragon Battle Armor he summoned by igniting his blood was shockingly powerful, it also placed a large burden on him.

Long Chen spent three full days to fully recover, yet he believed that Huo Qianwu was definitely no better off. Even with her Doyen power aiding her, her recovery speed wouldn’t be faster than his.

Long Chen’s wounds healed slowly due to the Doyen power ravaging his body, which made it more difficult for the primal chaos space’s energy to heal him. However, the power of his dragon blood also contained some wild laws. Huo Qianwu would need to first expel them before she could start to heal.

The previous battle had shown Long Chen just how terrifying Heavenly Chosens were, and it also made him realize who his true opponent was. Long Chen believed that Huo Qianwu still had some trump cards up her sleeves, but he wasn’t afraid of them. In the end, a powerful trump card needed to be held by a true expert; otherwise, it would be worthless.

Still, this battle gave Long Chen a sense of alarm. If Huo Qianwu had possessed more combat experience, it really would have been a bitter fight.

By the time Long Chen recovered, Huo Linger had finished refining the three feathers, her spiritual seal placed on them. This spiritual seal was not a slave seal and was more like a contractual seal. Moreover, since Huo Linger was not human, her seal was almost impossible for others to sense. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

When Long Chen released the three feathers, they immediately tore through the void but put on an extremely weak appearance. Seeing them acting properly, Long Chen knew that they had been fully won over by Huo Linger’s enticement.

He was unsure whether the three feathers would manage to incite a rebellion within the Thousand Phoenix Feather Dress. He could only wait until the next time he encountered Huo Qianwu.

Long Chen took out a piece of paper with a rather sloppy map drawn on it. This was given to him by Mo Nian. There was a marker on the map, and according to Mo Nian, it indicated the location of a great hidden secret.

“I wonder what he’s up to right now... Well, I should get to work. If he ends up with all the treasure while I’m empty-handed, he’ll definitely laugh at me.”

Long Chen looked at the surroundings before summoning his lightning wings and shooting off like a bolt of lightning. He focused entirely on speed, not concealing himself. His divine sense recklessly scanned the surroundings as he traveled.

After an hour of flying, he sensed some fluctuations. Then, he heard a powerful roar, and a surge of powerful devil qi gushed out.

A group of people had managed to reach this place by following a secret treasure map. Due to the presence of devil creatures guarding this location, they were approaching stealthily.

However, Long Chen’s appearance instantly disturbed a devil creature, causing these people to flee for their lives. Any one of these devil creatures would be more than enough to wipe them out.

“It’s him! Damn, how is he here?!” Startled cries rang out. They were amongst the first group to get through the barrier. Having been burned half dead, they had to recover first before they could treasure hunt. However, as soon as they recovered, they ran into Long Chen again, so they cursed their bad luck.

Just as they fled, a black saber fell from the sky, cutting a mountain in two, and when Long Chen’s figure flashed by, the roaring devil creature fell silent.

“Did he just...?”

Those people quickly ran back and saw blood splatters covering the land, with no devil creatures in sight.

“He...”

Those people stared in disbelief. Had they watched Long Chen and Huo Qianwu’s battle until the end, they wouldn’t have been so shocked.

Without decreasing his speed, Long Chen killed the devil creature and threw the corpse on the primal chaos space’s soil where it would slowly devour the corpse.

After that, Long Chen continued onward, slaying any devil creatures he encountered on his way. However, he chose to go around the territory of Heaven Saint devil creatures, not because he was afraid but because he was rushing for time.

After several days of flying, Long Chen saw that the mountains faded away, replaced by an endless prairie.

“I’ve arrived.”

Long Chen eyed this flat plain of grass. For some reason, his nerves instantly tensed.

“It seems that this place really isn’t simple!”
