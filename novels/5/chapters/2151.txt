Chapter 2141 Unrivaled Divine Power

Stepping into that region, before even reaching the drake king and the blood phoenix king, Long Chen was buffeted by astral winds that felt like blades against his skin.

“Why is it that despite being at the peak of the twelfth rank, these two are so much stronger than other peak twelfth rank Magical Beasts?”

Long Chen was shocked. Both the drake king and the blood phoenix king far surpassed the power of the other Magical Beasts here. They could instantly kill other Magical Beasts of the same rank.

As soon as Long Chen got close, the blood phoenix king’s feathers stood on end, and rays of divine light shot out at Long Chen.

Those rays of divine light shattered the void, breaking the laws of the Heavenly Daos. Long Chen hastily dodged, but one of those rays struck his shoulder. Even his Azure Dragon Battle Armor was unable to block it, and blood splashed.

Immense pain came from his shoulder. The wound was deep enough that one could see the bone, and there was some remnant energy trying to wreck his body.

BOOM!

The drake king’s claw smashed down, and the phoenix blood king immediately counterattacked. Their huge bodies once more clashed, unleashing terrifying astral winds.

Just at this moment, Guo Ran’s arrow flew through the air, but the astral winds blew it away to some unknown spot.

“Boss, this one’s too powerful! I can’t even hit it!” shouted Guo Ran.

“Just wait for your chance. Don’t blindly shoot!” called out Long Chen.

BOOM!

At this moment, Wilde charged his way through the astral winds and reached the blood phoenix king. He smashed his club down, only to be smacked away by one of its wings.

Wilde was extremely powerful, but he was unable to do anything to this blood phoenix king. It was too strong. No wonder it was able to become the king of the beasts in the other region.

“Split the Heavens 8!”

Eyeing the drake king’s movements, Long Chen unleashed an attack at a time he judged correct.

His saber fell just as the blood phoenix king was knocked back by the drake king. His aim was perfect, striking it right on the throat.

However, the scene of his saber slicing through its neck and its head flying away never appeared. Only a mass of feathers whirled away. He only managed to break some feathers and just barely scratch its skin. A bit of blood flowed out.

“There’s no way to fight.” Long Chen’s expression changed. Even a perfectly timed attack at its weakest spot was unable to do anything.

Being struck in the neck seemed to enrage the blood phoenix king. It actually turned toward Long Chen. All its feathers stood on end, and light passed through all of them, condensing in its eyes. A blood-colored divine arrow shot out.

That arrow caused the clouds and wind to change color. Long Chen felt the world around him freeze as he was locked in place.

The drake king immediately opened its mouth and unleashed a wave of dragon breath to interrupt the blood phoenix king. However, the blood phoenix king seemed to have been infuriated and would rather receive the drake king’s attack if it meant it could kill Long Chen.

The divine arrow shot out. This was a terrifying attack. If struck, Long Chen would definitely die. The sky was dyed red.

However, Long Chen snorted, and a dragon cry rang throughout the world. The frozen space snapped like a tense bowstring.

“Bloodline pressure? You’re far too lacking for that.” Like a bolt of lightning, Long Chen shot away, barely avoiding the arrow. It landed in the distance and exploded, creating a giant cloud on the ground. Its shockwaves blew apart countless mountains.

At this moment, the drake king’s dragon breath struck the blood phoenix king, sending it tumbling back. But the drake king had also been affected by Long Chen’s sudden dragon pressure, weakening its attack.

Long Chen immediately retracted his dragon pressure. The drake king was affected more than the blood phoenix king by it.

Wilde once more charged forward, only to be sent flying once more. Fortunately, Wilde’s body was truly terrifying, and he wasn’t injured. However, Wilde’s attacks were also unable to cause any damage to the blood phoenix king, making him howl in rage.

“Drake king, entangle it. I’ll give it a hard attack.” Long Chen took a deep breath. Putting away Evilmoon, he clasped his right elbow with his left hand, raising his right arm.

A flame lotus condensed in his hand, and chanting rang out from both Long Chen’s mouth and the air. It was like gods and devils were chanting along. As the Nirvana Scripture activated, flame energy gathered from every direction, creating a giant whirlpool around Long Chen.

At the center of the whirlpool was the flame lotus. It rapidly grew larger and larger. A Taiji diagram materialized in the center of it, and then a flame sphere appeared.

This was the same World Extermination Flame Lotus he had used at the Mechanism Sect. But this time, it was even stronger because he was using the Nirvana Scripture to absorb the Wild World’s energy.

It was already ten times larger than last time. The world was set ablaze. Heaven and earth twisted like it was the apocalypse.

“That’s about enough. Any more and I won’t be able to control it.”

Long Chen looked at the giant flame lotus in his hand and felt a burst of fear. This thing was too dangerous. One mistake and he would end up being killed by it.

Last time, he had used Huo Long’s power to use it. This time, he used the Nirvana Scripture. This was his first time using the Nirvana Scripture along with the Inverse Dao Water Spirit Flame.

Unexpectedly, the Inverse Dao Water Spirit Flame crazily absorbed all that flame energy without him being able to control it. It was like a hungry wolf. If he didn’t control it, it would continue growing limitlessly, devouring him. Even the entire world might be destroyed. This move that Long Chen had invented should be called a forbidden art, for it truly possessed the power to exterminate worlds.

This was also why when he had developed the World Extermination Flame Lotus, a heavenly manifestation had descended. It was because this move was capable of threatening the Heavenly Daos.

While using the Heaven Incinerating Flame to test this move, just going to the six-star point had made it almost go out of control.

Now that he was using the Inverse Dao Water Spirit Flame, it was different. It was like he had been controlling a rabbit at first, only to try controlling a dragon now.

Fortunately, this was still Huo Long’s power, so Long Chen could control it. But it was starting to grow unruly with the Nirvana Scripture’s support.

“Guo Ran, Wilde, retreat!”

He couldn’t stop the World Extermination Flame Lotus from continuing to absorb flame energy. In just a few more seconds, it would progress to the two-star level. But then he would lose his life.

Wilde and Guo Ran immediately rushed away. Long Chen flung the flame lotus at the blood phoenix king.

The drake king had been warned by Long Chen and was prepared. Its scales lit up, and it suddenly shot into the distance. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

The giant flame lotus smashed through the air. Cracks appeared in the void as the world was unable to bear this terrifying power.

The phoenix blood king finally felt fear. Its instincts as a Magical Beast were telling it that if it was struck by that, it would be doomed.

It spread its wings, about to flee, but just at this moment, Long Chen’s Blood Qi surged. He activated his dragon might once more, locking it down.

In this state, trying to dodge would only quicken its death.

The blood phoenix king let out a resounding bird cry. Its wings spread open, and its feathers blazed with light. Astral winds surged out of it along with a pillar of light, striking the World Extermination Flame Lotus.

This was the blood phoenix race’s strongest attack. Even the drake king had to be wary of it. The flame lotus exploded.

It was like the explosion of a star. At the same time as the dazzling light spread, it was possible to see a black hole appear in the center, which annihilated everything in its midst before vanishing.

Long Chen coughed repeatedly, each time spitting out blood. Although this was his attack and he had immediately fled, the World Extermination Flame Lotus’s area of effect was too large, causing him to be injured. This time, he had mostly used the power of the world to strengthen it, not Huo Long’s power, so the World Extermination Flame Lotus’s flames no longer recognized him as its master.

BOOM!

The earth split open, and a huge figure shot out, covered in blood. It was the blood phoenix king. Its aura was extremely chaotic now. It no longer had any of its mighty aura. All of its feathers had been destroyed, and one of its wings was almost torn from its body.

In its heavily injured state, it no longer had an urge to fight. It fled for its life.

However, the drake king, which had long since been waiting due to Long Chen’s instructions, slammed its claw through its head.

The blood phoenix king let out one final cry as it fell from the sky. With its opponent dead, the drake king let out a mighty roar.
