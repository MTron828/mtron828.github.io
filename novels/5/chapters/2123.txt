Chapter 2113 The Dragonblood Legion’s Welcoming Ceremony

Within a secluded and closed space, there were over ten thousand experts gathered. They saw the outside world through a water-like screen of light.

The screen of light slowly moved forward, bringing them along as well. Their speed was very slow.

“This thing’s too slow. Why didn’t we just directly charge in?” demanded the one-eyed Shi Lingfeng impatiently.

It had already been two days, but the battle had yet to start. It was irritating being crowded together like this.

Standing beside Shi Lingfeng was Zhao Wuji. Zhao Wuji had fully recovered, and he was staring menacingly outside.

Last time, Long Chen hadn’t just defeated Zhao Wuji but also torn off his armor. Ignoring just how grievous a blow that was, he had even lost face in front of the other supreme geniuses he was competing against. That was even more painful than being killed.

The Mechanism Sect hadn’t made a move for many days because they had been waiting for Zhao Wuji to recover. Once he had, they gathered all their elites for revenge.

The first thing they did was to go find Shi Lingfeng to have him track Long Chen’s position. However, they were dumbfounded to find that his stone head didn’t know how to think. He hadn’t tried to sense Long Chen’s position before, and when they found him, he said that he couldn’t sense anything.

Zhao Wuji had wanted to curse him at that time. If he wasn’t able to sense him, then why hadn’t he said anything before?

Zhao Wuji hastily sent people to investigate Long Chen’s whereabouts, but the only information they found was that Long Chen had gone to the Martial Heaven Alliance’s headquarters. That was all the information they had.

When Long Chen had gone to the Heaven Splitting Battle Sect and then the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow race, he had used their secret channels. There was no way Zhao Wuji could find him.

After thinking about it, Zhao Wuji had chosen to attack the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow race. It was his most profitable option. Hence, hearing Shi Lingfeng’s grumble, Zhao Wuji had an urge to curse this idiot.

However, he had no choice but to console Shi Lingfeng. “If we charged right in, they would be alerted. We’d be able to kill many, but some would escape. What we want though is to make sure not even an egg is left unbroken. We’ll first destroy their core transportation formation and then cut off their paths of retreat. At that time, there will be nowhere for them to go. We’ll slaughter them all. Wouldn’t that be better?”

“Fine. Hopefully, Long Chen’s there. I’ll rip off his head and take back my eye.” Shi Lingfeng’s sole eye glittered, making his sinister face even more frightening.

“Long Chen should be standing guard over the Xuantian Dao Sect right now. If we’re fast enough with our attack, he won’t have a chance to react. With the transportation formations broken, everyone will be dead by the time he rushes over. Once he sees the ground covered with corpses, I’m sure his expression will be very marvelous!” snickered Zhao Wuji.

“Our Mechanism Sect hasn’t shown itself on the continent for many years, and people seem to have already forgotten how terrifying we are. We’ll use this chance to reveal our strength,” said one of the Mechanism Sect’s Netherpassage elders.

The Mechanism Sect’s power lay in their convoluted mechanisms. The way they controlled those mechanisms was with their Yuan Spirits, so even in the Mechanism Sect, a stable realm was important. The stronger the Yuan Spirit, the stronger the armor they could wear.

“Hmph, the Mechanism Sect has destroyed at least eight thousand sects throughout history. Amongst those sects, some were even stronger than the Xuantian Dao Sect and the Heaven Splitting Battle Sect, and they were still destroyed in a single night by us. After so many years, the world has forgotten our glory. Destroying the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow race should remind them,” snorted another expert of the Mechanism Sect.

“The Stone race is the same. It’s time to exercise our muscles. Only blood and corpses will give people the deepest impression,” said someone from the Stone race.

The closer they got to the interior of the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow race’s territory, the hungrier they got. They were like bloodthirsty wolves. Even their eyes turned red.

“Careful!”

Suddenly, Zhao Wuji let out a shout. The invisible formation came to a stop as a group of people walked by.

“They are people from the Dragonblood Legion,” whispered someone. These Dragonblood warriors had the specific dragon mark of the Dragonblood Legion on their robes.

“Didn’t they go to the Xuantian Dao Sect?” People were confused. Based on their plan, they should have already left for the Xuantian Dao Sect.

“Activate the illusion formation!” directed Zhao Wuji. The experts in charge of the formation caused them to be the very picture of a bamboo forest.

There was already a bamboo forest here, so this illusion would make them look like part of it. There was no way anyone would suspect anything.

There were over thirty Dragonblood warriors in that group, and they seemed lazy and idling. Some of them were even staggering a bit as if they were drunk.

“I drank too much just now. Wait up, I have to piss,” called out one of the warriors. He actually ran over to the bamboo forest.

“Fuck, what are they doing?!” raged Shi Lingfeng.

These warriors were right by their bamboo forest. If that person took a piss, it would be like pissing on them. Although the formation isolated them, that feeling would really be just like someone was peeing on their heads.

“Kill him!” shouted Shi Lingfeng.

“We can’t. We’re perfectly hidden. Just one more step and we can destroy their transportation formations!” Zhao Wuji jumped in fear that Shi Lingfeng would break their formation. They had to endure.

“Restrain yourself for now. Why bother with people who are about to die anyway?” advised someone else.

A large stream of piss came splashing down. To them, it was like they were kneeling and someone was peeing on their heads.

“Fuck, I’ll make sure to personally crush all of them!” roared Shi Lingfeng. He had never suffered such humiliation in his life.

After peeing, the Dragonblood warrior even made sure to shake. His refreshed and relieved expression was especially infuriating.

It had barely ended when another Dragonblood warrior walked over. “Now I need to pee too.”

“Ah, we’re all brothers. Let’s just pee together.”

The whole group suddenly came over. If Shi Lingfeng had lungs, they would have definitely burst from rage.

“Why didn’t boss bring us to the Xuantian Dao Sect with him?” asked one of the warriors as he pulled down his pants.

“Didn’t boss already say it? It’s to prevent that idiot Zhao Wuji from trying any diversionary tactics. Now we’re prepared on both sides. That’s why we’re here guarding the transportation formations. If anything unexpected happens, we can send timely assistance,” said another warrior.

After hearing that, Zhao Wuji’s heart shook slightly. Long Chen had actually prepared for him.

“Isn’t that worrying for nothing? That idiot Zhao Wuji is like a little chicken in front of boss. Boss slaps him around like he pleases. He even skins him if he wants to. Other than crying like a baby, what can Zhao Wuji do? He’s not even a worthy opponent. If he really comes, boss will crush him with a fart,” said the other warrior disdainfully.

Zhao Wuji’s whole body shuddered from fury. Every one of that person’s words was like poisonous arrows striking his heart. The others behind him also heard them clearly, and countless gazes turned toward him.

Zhao Wuji’s humiliation was a taboo subject in the Mechanism Sect, and no one dared to ask around about it. Now that it was all exposed, Zhao Wuji had an urge to chop them into mincemeat.

“So let’s just drink and eat. With the grand formation protecting this place, would that Zhao something chicken dare to come?” said another warrior. He seemed to have drunk too much. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

“It’s Zhao Wuji.”

“Yeah, Zhao Wuji! Just look at his name, you know he’s garbage. Hahaha!” laughed the warrior.

“Courting death!”

Zhao Wuji clenched his teeth furiously, his eyes about to spurt flames.

After peeing, the Dragonblood warriors pulled up their pants and prepared to leave. The experts hiding were trying to calm Zhao Wuji down. If he couldn’t endure, then all their efforts would have been useless.

“Hold it!” said one of the Dragonblood warriors suddenly.

“What is it?”

“Something’s off!” That warrior’s gaze burned into the bamboo forest.

The experts inside the formation stiffened. Had they been noticed?”

“What’s wrong?”

“My stomach feels off. I think I ate something bad. I need to poop. Can one of you help guard me? I’ll be quick.” That warrior held his stomach.

The experts inside the formation almost coughed up blood. This was the number one legion of the continent?

If he pooped here, it would really feel like someone was pooping on their heads. All of them were enraged. There was no way they could endure this.

“Ah, it’s not safe here. What if someone sees? That would hurt my reputation. Let’s finish our patrol and get back quickly. I need to use the bathroom. Quick, I can’t hold it much longer!” Holding his stomach, that warrior left with the others.

The experts in hiding sighed with relief. Those bastards had finally left.

“Young master, don’t be angry. The Dragonblood Legion is a legion of hoodlums. It’s actually a good thing that they’re here, because we can destroy them along with the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow race! Hehe, without his Dragonblood Legion, Long Chen will feel much worse than you!” said one of the Mechanism Sect’s elders.

“Keep advancing! We’ll first destroy their transportation formations. I’m going to make sure not one of them lives,” said Zhao Wuji hatefully, his eyes full of icy killing intent.
