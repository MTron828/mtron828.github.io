Chapter 2829 Long Chen’s Killing Intent

When Long Chen passed the exam, all the disciples exploded in cheers. They had never seen such a suave and graceful movement art.

That was Long Chen’s intention. After all, if he wanted to do well in this academy, being blindly low-key was not the answer.

Only by showing his power would the academy view him favorably, and only then would they be inclined to give him more resources. This opportunity was his best chance to show off a bit.

However, even though he perfectly revealed his power, he didn’t appear to be intentionally showing off. His indifferent display of power coincidentally manifested the arrogance of a low-key expert.

Even his tattered black robes didn’t cover up his heroic air at this moment. He appeared especially conspicuous, as every other disciple present was wearing white robes.

The image of Long Chen passing so easily was particularly stimulating due to just how many people failed wretchedly before him. Zhong Ling and Zhong Xiu’s throats were worn out from the shouting, but they continued to cheer.

In the end, everyone finished the tests. Half of them were caught and suspected of cheating. However, for some of them, there was no proof that they had previously cheated as perhaps they had passed through luck. Thus, they were all simply taken away for further investigation.

The remaining people had passed. However, they weren’t smiling. Compared to Long Chen, their displays were terrible, even though they had passed.

Following that, Heaven Master Yun Yang distributed the tablets and robes to the new instructors. This symbolized that they were officially instructors of the God Institute and would be given the appropriate fame and fortune.

However, when it was Long Chen’s turn, he didn’t receive them. Instead, he said, “Heaven Master, this junior has a request.”

“Oh? What is it?” asked Heaven Master Yun Yang.

“Is it possible for me to continue wearing my clothes rather than the instructor robes?” asked Long Chen.

“How brazen! You’ve just been promoted! How dare you make such a rude request! These robes are a symbol of an instructor’s status and image. Instructors must wear their robes and status badge at all times according to the God Institute’s rules! Are you trying to change the rules of the institute?!” shouted Earth Master Ming Ze.

Long Chen frowned. Was this Ming Ze an idiot? He himself was not free from his plight yet, but he had come to find trouble for him?

“If that’s the case, then this junior must regretfully give up on being an instructor. I will return to the Pill Institute to cultivate,” said Long Chen.

These robes of his were important to him. He would not switch them, nor would he wear some other color. Black was the only color he liked to wear.

When Long Chen said this, everyone was stunned. What was going on? The robes that instructors were bestowed on were made of the best materials. As for Long Chen’s black robes, they were made of materials from the mortal world and were already badly damaged. They didn’t look much better than the clothes of a beggar. Would he really give up on becoming an instructor because of those robes? Was he mad?

Heaven Master Yun Yang smiled and handed Long Chen the badge. He didn’t say whether it was alright or not, so Long Chen simply took the badge.

“Heaven Master! This pampered brat is completely ignoring the rules! If we allow such a person to raise our disciples, won’t the entire God Institute be flipped on its head? We can’t support such an unhealthy influence!” cried out Ming Ze.

Long Chen’s sword suddenly came out of its sheath. A drop of blood dripped onto his new badge, and the badge flew toward Ming Ze.

“I, Long Chen, use my status as instructor to challenge you to a life and death match. If I don’t cut off your head within three exchanges, I will personally cut off my own head. Do you dare to accept?” Long Chen shouted thunderously, his voice full of bloody killing intent.

Ming Ze saw the badge flying toward him, and without even thinking about it, he caught it. However, as soon as he did, his expression changed.

There was a rule in the God Institute. If two people had some irreconcilable enmity between them, a blood duel could be issued between them. The challenged party could accept or decline.

If the challenger threw out their bloody badge, the challenge was officially accepted if the challenged party received it. In a moment of muddle-headedness, he had caught Long Chen’s badge. Hence, everything fell deathly silent.

“You accept my challenge. Then I have to ask Heaven Master Yun Yang to bear witness to our duel. Let us have a life and death battle right here right now,” said Long Chen coldly.

Long Chen didn’t mind killing Ming Ze right here as the latter had repeatedly targeted him. If he could kill Ming Ze, it would definitely show his prestige. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

After experiencing the cruel destruction of the Martial Heaven Continent, Long Chen knew just how important time was. He was not intending on wasting any time being dragged down by brainless people.

Every bit of time wasted was losing a chance to get stronger. When the time came, the price would have to be paid.

Back then, that mysterious voice had been constantly pressing him onward, telling him to hurry up. Long Chen had never known what its intent was.

However, after the battle of the Martial Heaven Continent, he hated that he had wasted so much time. If he was given another chance, he wouldn’t waste the slightest chance. Perhaps then the Martial Heaven Continent wouldn’t be destroyed, and so many people wouldn’t be dead.

After ascending, he had sworn not to waste any time. However, there were always people trying to slow him down and block his path. Hence, the current Long Chen had placed Ming Ze on his list of people to kill.

Although Ming Ze’s aura was powerful, with his realm being who knew how much higher than Long Chen’s, he was nothing more than a pencil pusher, not a true fighter. Hence, Long Chen was confident in killing him.

Both the disciples and the other instructors were dumbfounded. This Long Chen was terrifying.

If he didn’t kill this Earth Master in three moves, he would kill himself? That was too ruthless, wasn’t it?

“You… I…”

Ming Ze panicked. Looking at Long Chen’s icy gaze, he felt like a primordial beast was staring at him. His heart almost leaped out of his chest.

The reason why Ming Ze could reach his current level of prestige was because back then, he had accumulated a great deal of experience and knowledge.

However, after becoming an Earth Master, he had grown comfortable. It was unknown just how many years it had been since he last fought with someone. Now, he was afraid.

“What, are you regretting receiving my badge? If you want to renege, according to the God Institute’s rules, you have to scram. Either fight or scram, your choice,” said Long Chen. Everyone’s hearts pounded. They stared at Ming Ze.

A life and death battle between two instructors. Perhaps in the entire history of the God Institute, such a thing had only occurred a few times, no?
