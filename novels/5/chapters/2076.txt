What drew his attention was an ancient divine furnace. It had three feet and two handles, with countless starry images carved into it. Although they were just carvings, looking at them made Long Chen feel like he was floating through the starry sky.

There were also images of four fierce beasts on the lid. They had their mouths open, looking like they wished to devour all of heaven and earth.

“This is a pill furnace!”

Long Chen instantly recognized that this was not a furnace for fighting but refining pills.

There were many furnace-shaped divine items used for fighting. Pagodas, cauldrons, furnaces, they could all be terrifying divine items. Their power was exceptionally great, and they cost even more to make, so there weren’t many of them.

As for furnace divine items, some were used for fighting and some were used for refining. Seeing the circular mark at the bottom of this pill furnace, Long Chen recognized it as the specific mark of a pill furnace.

That circular mark was something that allowed the furnace to absorb flame energy better. However, that resulted in its defensive power sharply dropping. If it was easy to absorb external energy, it could be broken easier, so it wasn’t suitable for fighting.

“This is something good!” Long Chen involuntarily gulped. Even before he got close, he could sense the energy fluctuations coming from within.

That kind of fluctuation was something only alchemists could sense. It was not the fragrance of a pill, but a specific fluctuation that a pill furnace gradually came to possess after being used to refine countless medicinal pills. It was the result of medicinal energy nourishing the furnace over a long period.

When Long Chen had obtained the Blazing Dragon Furnace, it had also possessed a similar fluctuation, but it was only present when the lid was open and when he was refining pills.

However, this furnace was sealed, and that fluctuation was still coming out so strongly. It meant that there was simply no way to calculate just how long this furnace had been used to refine medicinal pills.

The medicinal energy had merged into every corner of the pill furnace. The medicinal effect of any pills refined by such a furnace would be much greater, and the chances of a successful refinement were also improved.

“Mister Long Chen, are you interested in this Star Refining Furnace?” Just at this moment, an attendant from the Dongfang family came over upon seeing Long Chen looking so closely at the furnace.

“Oh, I was just strolling,” said Long Chen. He naturally couldn’t act like he urgently needed it. If others saw that, the price would soar.

“The treasures here are left behind by various heavenly geniuses. We’re only in charge of looking after them. If you have anything you wish to trade as well, you can put it up here. You can indicate what you wish to trade for. If no one wishes to complete that trade, you won’t suffer any loss,” said the attendant. “Look, they’ve all left behind what they wish to trade for. Trading this way is much easier.”

Only then did Long Chen come to an understanding that the masters of these treasures didn’t need to expose themselves. Then it seemed that he had been worried for nothing.

Looking around, he saw that there were less than twenty treasures present. Although they were definitely priceless treasures, they didn’t attract Long Chen as much as the pill furnace.

“What does the master of this pill furnace want to trade for?” asked Long Chen.

“One hundred drops Peak Dao Transformation Dragon Saliva,” answered the attendant.

Although he had known that the master of this furnace would demand a large price, he hadn’t expected it to be so large. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Peak Dao Transformation Dragon Saliva was the essence of a dragon vein. A single drop could only be extracted from a dragon vein that had existed for over a million years.

The current Martial Heaven Continent had already declined. The previous dragon veins of the continent had been broken, while forming new ones was very difficult. If a dragon vein didn’t meet certain conditions, it was impossible to extract Peak Dao Transformation Dragon Saliva from it.

Long Chen suddenly thought of the four ancient nations’ dragon veins. If their dragon veins were extracted, then they would definitely go crazy. They were built off the backbone of their dragon veins.

However, even if their four dragon veins were destroyed, only a few drops could possibly be extracted. As for this pill furnace, the owner actually demanded a hundred drops. That was something that couldn’t be squeezed out of the continent no matter what.

Long Chen shook his head and sighed. There was no way around it. It might be a good pill furnace, but without money, he could only look. In fact, he didn’t dare to keep looking, afraid he might fall in love with it.

“A hundred drops of Peak Dao Transformation Dragon Saliva? It seems that the owner of this pill furnace is deliberately making it hard to buy.” Just at this moment, Beitang Rushuang walked over. Eyeing the pill furnace, she shook her head. “Little fellow, are you interested in this thing? Let me tell you, the price is at least double what it’s actually worth. I feel like the owner is targeting Pill Valley.”

Long Chen was startled, but he quickly understood that the owner of the pill furnace was probably trying to sell it to Pill Valley. Pill Valley had plenty of wealth accumulated over the years, and that was why the price was so vicious.

Even if the owner didn’t manage to sell it, there was no loss to them. But if they did, they would have made a gigantic profit.

“Young lady, can you not call me little fellow? That would make you seem old, and most importantly, it doesn’t make me feel good,” said Long Chen. He had already been vexed at not being able to buy this pill furnace, and seeing Beitang Rushuang worsened his mood.

“What’s wrong with calling you little fellow? Calling you that means that I’m not looking down on you. If you really want this furnace, you better treat me better. Perhaps I can lend you the money,” said Beitang Rushuang. She had a bright smile as if she had a card up her sleeve.

“How am I supposed to treat you better? Let me tell you, sacrificing my morals is out of the question. I have wives at home already,” warned Long Chen.

“Scram!” raged Beitang Rushuang. “Don’t act like you’re so handsome that women are throwing themselves at you. When I dominated the continent, you hadn’t even been born yet. I’ve seen all kinds of heroes, and as for you? Keep dreaming.”

“Oh, if I don’t have to sacrifice anything in that regard, I can consider anything else. If you help me buy it, I’ll owe you a favor, paying you back your capital and the interest in the future.” Long Chen was slightly moved by this offer.

This pill furnace was incredibly important to him. Only with it could he try refining eleventh tier medicinal pills.

“Lending it to you isn’t out of the question. But you have to accept one of my conditions...” Upon seeing Long Chen’s wary expression, the smiling Beitang Rushuang immediately coldly said, “Don’t talk nonsense with me. I’m not talking about that. I just wish to ask you something.”

“What if I don’t know the answer?” Long Chen suddenly felt that this matter wasn’t so simple. These ancient monsters weren’t simple. She wouldn’t help him for nothing.

“You definitely know the answer to the question I want to ask. So? Do you want to carry out this transaction? Answer one question from me and swear not to tell what I asked to anyone, and I will lend you the Peak Dao Transformation Dragon Saliva, allowing you to buy this pill furnace.” Beitang Rushuang stared closely at Long Chen.

Long Chen also looked at Beitang Rushuang. She was beautiful but wild. No one could control her.

He was extremely moved by this temptation, but his intuition told her that this Beitang Rushuang was not so simple. One mistake and he might con himself.

In the end, he sighed and shook his head. He was about to decline when another voice rang out.

“If you want this pill furnace, I can lend you the Peak Dao Transformation Dragon Saliva.”

Long Chen looked back, only to find that Nangong Zuiyue had once more silently appeared. She was the speaker.

Beitang Rushuang’s expression instantly sank. Nangong Zuiyue had clearly come to target her.

“Nangong Zuiyue, what do you think you’re doing? I thought that you didn’t like fighting, and yet you came to ruin my affairs? The Nangong family really is as hypocritical as they come.”

“Fairy Rushuang has misunderstood. After all, I’ve met Long Chen twice, and hearing what he said about the Dao gave me clarity on many areas that I had been struggling with. This favor has to be repaid. Now that Long Chen needs something, I naturally can’t ignore him. I have no intention of targeting you,” said Nangong Zuiyue gracefully.

“Are you really going to lend it to me without any conditions?” Long Chen couldn’t quite believe it.

Nangong Zuiyue nodded. “That phrase of yours about the Grand Dao was truly marvelous. I benefited from it immensely, but this Peak Dao Transformation Dragon Saliva is too precious, so I cannot simply give it. I can only lend it to you.”

Long Chen couldn’t help being delighted. It seemed that his bragging had been not bad. Although he would have to return the Peak Dao Transformation Dragon Saliva one day, that was fine.

“Then many thanks.” Long Chen cupped his fists. This furnace had truly come at the right time.

“You think you’re the only one who can buy favors? Long Chen, I’ll also lend it to you. Tell me, who are you going to borrow from?”

Beitang Rushuang couldn’t endure it and forced Long Chen to pick between her and Nangong Zuiyue.
