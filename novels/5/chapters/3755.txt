Chapter 3744 Major Matter of the Violet Blood Race

“No, you’re the senior. Don’t call me that. I can’t accept it,” said Long Chen hastily.

The Violet Blood race was his mother’s family. No matter how strong he was, no matter how high his cultivation base was, he wouldn’t dare to be rude in front of his mother’s family.

“Then I’ll be rude. Can we talk?”

Long Chen walked into the ruined city with the elder.

There were several simple tents set up. Even before they approached, Long Chen could smell a dense herbal smell.

“Your people are injured?” asked Long Chen.

“To tell the truth, while fleeing from threats, we had countless casualties. Hero, we can go inside first.” The elder gestured to Long Chen, indicating for him to walk into a tent.

“No rush. Let me see their injuries first.” Long Chen waved his hand. Not standing on courtesy, he directly walked into the other tent.

Once he was inside, Long Chen jumped. There were thousands of people inside, and every single one of them had terrible wounds. Those wounds had black liquid dripping out of them, which emitted a disgusting smell of rot. 

Herbs had been applied to the wounds, but most of the wounds were festering to the point of being able to see bone. These people were on their last breaths, enduring immense pain.

“Nether Qi? This was done by the Nether race?” Long Chen frowned.

“Yes, it was the Nether race. They chased us down, and hundreds of thousands of our people were slain as we fled. We now only have a few thousand people left. Furthermore… these herbs can only temporarily relieve their pain. As for whether or not they can survive, it’s up to whether they can expel the Nether Qi themselves or not. The chances are dismally low.” The elder’s voice was heavy with sorrow as he looked at the wounded.

The odds of anyone surviving amongst these people were very low. But they had no other way to block the Nether Qi. They could only listen to the orders of fate.

“Violet Stamen Nether Heart Grass does have a suppressive effect on Nether Qi, but while it treats the symptoms, it does not treat the source. The violet blood energy in their bodies is too weak. After being wounded, their essence blood is exhausted, and they lose the ability to resist. If this goes on, these people will all die.” Long Chen shook his head.

The elder could only sigh. He also knew this, but they had no other solution.

“I have some medicinal pills here. Have them consume the pills for now, and that should protect their lives. Also, have the disciples who consumed the fruit come here. Their violet blood is abundant. If they circulate it through their bodies, they can help the wounded expel the Nether Qi,” said Long Chen.

Long Chen took out some medicinal pills. As for the elder, he was shocked and delighted. He hastily summoned the disciples.

Long Chen took this time to take out dozens of kinds of plants from a region of the primal chaos space. These were plants that he had gathered in the Netherworld. He had never had a use for them until now.

He then refined them together in his pill furnace, turning them into a medicinal fluid. There wasn’t much technique required, and he didn’t even need to summon Huo Linger.

After refining the medicine, he had the disciples apply it on the wounded. As soon as this medicine was pressed against their wounds, a huge amount of noxious black liquid flowed out of their wounds.

Everyone was delighted to see this. This signified that the Nether Qi was being diluted. Long Chen instantly became viewed as a god by these people.Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

After applying the medicine several times, these people’s complexions improved. He then had the people stop applying the liquid medicine. He gave them another round of medicine pills and then told them to apply the liquid again in two hours.

After three rounds of this treatment, all the Nether Qi within their bodies was expelled. However, they were all still extremely weak, as if they had a serious illness.

Despite that, all their lives could be considered to have been saved. Countless families were weeping emotionally as they hugged these wounded people. They had thought that they would lose their family members for sure.

“Hero’s great kindness is something that my Luo tribe will never forget.”

The Luo tribe’s elder was incredibly emotional. He actually kowtowed to Long Chen. Fortunately, Long Chen was prepared and stopped him. “Senior, there’s no need to be courteous. My mother is from the Violet Blood race. She is also surnamed Luo. To put it frankly, we are a family. If you’re this courteous, you’ll make me feel bad.”

Hearing that, the elder couldn’t help asking, “Then can this old man be so bold as to ask why there is not the slightest trace of violet blood fluctuations within your body?”

As soon as he said this, he felt bad and added, “Please don’t misunderstand, it’s not that I don’t believe you. I’m just very curious about this.”

Long Chen smiled and said, “It’s fine. Not long after I was born, my Spirit Blood was taken by others.”

“What?! Who would be so cruel?!” 

“It’s fine. That’s in the past. I don’t want to talk about it. Just know that I have no bad intentions toward you. Is there anything else that you need my help with? I’m not from the three thousand worlds, so I still have many things to do this time. I can’t accompany you for too long,” said Long Chen.

These people were from the Violet Blood race and were even surnamed Luo. According to reason, Long Chen should help them. At the very least, he should wait until they were fully recovered before leaving.

However, he came to the three thousand worlds to grow. With limited time, he couldn’t wait for long. The most worrisome thing was that the dragon expert had yet to communicate with Long Chen about where the dragon scale was. If he couldn’t count on the dragon expert, he would have to run around himself and hope to run into it.

The elder looked at Long Chen for a long time before suddenly clenching his teeth. “Fine. Since you say that you’re from the Violet Blood race, I will gamble. I’ll tell you everything. My Violet Blood race has recently received a summons. We are going to do something major, and this matter relates to the life and death of the very Violet Blood race. However, we had just received the summons when the Nether race’s experts suddenly attacked us. After a battle with them, we fell back to this place, leaving our home. We also met blockades several times on our way, causing more and more people to be injured. As our power is a far cry from before, the journey will probably be much more dangerous as well. You say that you are from the Violet Blood race, so I will treat you as one of us. This is a keepsake of the Violet Blood race. Take it. Our Violet Blood race also has some powerful existences spread throughout the three thousand worlds. If you are in trouble, you can ask my Violet Blood race for help. If you feel a summons and are strong enough and have that ability, I hope that you can come help us.”

The elder took out an ancient jade pendant. It was violet and seemed to possess innate fluctuations of life. Violet blood flowed within it.

Long Chen then rubbed the pendant, feeling an indescribable closeness to it. He said, “Don’t worry. I will definitely come assist you once I become an Immortal King. But where are you going?”

The elder shook his head. “We don’t know either. Right now, we are gathering with another tribe of the Violet Blood race. Ah, I have something for you. It should be something you need.”

The elder took out a beast hide. It was a map.
