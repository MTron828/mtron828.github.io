Chapter 2184 Settling Grudges

A giant saber tore into the sky and slashed down. Although Dongfang Yuyang had done his best to stop Long Chen from accumulating power, this attack was still unleashed.

This saber caused heaven and earth to change color. Dongfang Yuyang was completely locked down. The space around him had been frozen by divine power.

“Either counterattack or die,” sneered Long Chen.

“You truly are very powerful. But you’re far from enough to kill me,” said Dongfang Yuyang with a cold smile.

Suddenly, a giant ancient castle appeared in front of Dongfang Yuyang.

“The Dongfang family’s war castle, the Astral Ancient Castle!”

This ancient castle was where the gathering of past and present heroes had been held. It was a war fort, capable of both offense and defense. It was a super treasure amongst divine items.

BOOM!

Divine light flowed out of the castle, and stars flickered within the light. As a result, Long Chen was forced back, almost spitting blood, while the ancient castle smashed into the ground, leaving a giant ditch.

“He even sent such a giant and heavy divine item flying! Just how powerful is that saber in Long Chen’s hands?!” All those with any comprehension of how powerful the Astral Ancient Castle was were stunned.

“This little fellow only seems to get more amazing. Rushuang, I’m being serious. If you still don’t make a move, it’ll be too late.” The Beitang family’s master transmitted a message to Beitang Rushuang who was within a stream of qi flow. She was playing matchmaker between Long Chen and Beitang Rushuang.

“What’s so amazing about him? I’m not inferior to anyone, and I won’t depend on anyone either. You want to marry me off?” Beitang Rushuang directly rolled her eyes at her grandma. She had her own pride. It was impossible for her to share a man with others.

Although that was what she said, Long Chen’s current display of power had truly shocked her.

Heaven and earth shook as the qi flow streams began to grow gentle once more. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

“The third eruption is about to start! This is the final eruption! Everyone, you must use this chance to charge through your bottlenecks and advance as much as possible.”

An expert from the senior generation gave the disciples a reminder. The third eruption was the most important one.

This was the best moment to break through their shackles and push their realms as high as possible. It was also the moment that all these heavenly geniuses were waiting for.

Advancing within the qi flow stream had no limits. All bottlenecks became loose and easy to break through.

Furthermore, no matter how many levels you advanced, with the qi flow supporting you, there wouldn’t be the slightest sign of your foundation growing unstable, nor could you be bedeviled.

“Attack together to kill everyone within the largest qi flow stream and occupy it. Otherwise, it’ll be too late.” A fierce light appeared in Dongfang Yuyang’s eyes. The ancient castle hovered above his head, sprinkling divine light around him.

The others hadn’t expected Long Chen to be so powerful. If this continued, they would waste their chance to absorb qi flow. That wasn’t worth it.

“Ignore Long Chen. Let’s kill the Dragonblood Legion, the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow race, and Mo Gate’s disciples.” Kun Pengzi agreed. Wasting time on Long Chen wasn’t worth it. It was better to kill the others. They couldn’t let just Long Chen stop them.

“Kill!”

Following Kun Pengzi, the disciples of the Xuan Beasts charged over to the Dragonblood Legion.

“Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow race, you traitors are finally about to face your fate! Come out and face your deaths!” shouted Huang Feiyan.

At the same time, the giant Xue Luocha charged over with her meteor hammer, while Di Feng shouted, leading the ancient family alliance’s disciples into an attack.

Tian Xiezi waved his soul summoning banner, and the Corrupt God Ancient Tower appeared above his head once more. Although it was injured, it could assist him. After that, he sent the Corrupt path’s army charging forward.

The ancient races’ disciples followed the Xuan Beasts, keeping close behind their butts as they charged.

“Brother Ximen, what are you still hesitating for? The competition of the Heavenly Daos will not allow you to pass your responsibilities to others. Long Chen is trying to destroy the continent. What are you waiting for?!” shouted Dongfang Yuyang to Ximen Tianxiong upon seeing him conflicted.

Ximen Tianxiong had come alone. He had not brought the people of the Ximen family into this unclear fight. They were in a qi flow stream.

Hearing what Dongfang Yuyang said, Ximen Tianxiong shouted at Long Chen, “Long Chen, answer me! Are you colluding with the original devil race to destroy the Martial Heaven Continent?”

“Don’t you have your own brain?” responded Long Chen.

How was he supposed to answer this question? Yes, he was colluding with the original devil race, but he had never thought about destroying the Martial Heaven Alliance. The matter of the original devil race had not been resolved yet, so he didn’t want to talk about it. Since every person had their own brain, they could decide the truth for themselves.

If he did try to explain, then Dongfang Yuyang would immediately retort. There were more mouths on their side, so Long Chen had Ximen Tianxiong make his own decision.

“You don’t even dare to respond directly. As expected, you really are colluding with the original devil race. Then don’t blame me for being vicious.” Ximen Tianxiong waved his hand. Tens of thousands of disciples from the Ximen family charged over.

“Master, what do we do?” asked Ye Lingshan. There were millions of experts charging toward the Dragonblood Legion now.

The million disciples of the Martial Heaven Alliance were also tense. They were just waiting for the order.

This showed the immense foundation of the Martial Heaven Alliance. Despite almost half the sects betraying the Martial Heaven Alliance, they still had over a million elite Life Star disciples.

If those sects had not betrayed them, then the Martial Heaven Alliance would have at least half the continent’s talented disciples.

“Alliance head, we’re all prepared! We just need your order!” shouted one disciple.

The disciples who were still standing on the side of the Martial Heaven Alliance were all loyal and fearless, willing to fight alongside Long Chen.

“Brothers, thank you. My Dragonblood Legion temporarily doesn’t need your help, but when we do, we will definitely call for you!”

The Dragonblood Legion tightened its formation, forming a circular arc. The disciples of the Mo family were present with arrows nocked. Meanwhile, the Heaven Splitting Battle Sect’s disciples were holding their broadswords, cool and indifferent in the face of the giant army before them.

“Hehe, these are the men of the Heaven Splitting Battle Sect.” Seeing the expressions on his disciples’ faces, the old man smiled. For the first time, he felt that these children had finally become real men.

The Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrows had also set up a tight formation that corresponded with the Dragonblood Legion’s current formation. Seeing their enemies getting closer, they began to accumulate energy.

Long Chen stood in the sky and seemed to be ignoring the armies of the Xuan Beasts, Corrupt path, ancient races, ancient family alliance, Dongfang family, and the Ximen family.

The only ones that Long Chen blocked were the experts of Pill Valley. More accurately, he was blocking the Pill Fairy.

The Pill Fairy was leading tens of thousands of Pill Valley’s disciples. She stared coldly at Long Chen, a water-like flame gradually growing out of her.

Long Chen didn’t look at the Pill Fairy. He stared at a beautiful young lady behind the Pill Fairy. He still remembered her.

“Do you want to greet your big brother San?” asked Long Chen, smiling slightly.

“Big brother San, you still remember Wan Qing?” The young lady’s voice trembled. Tears fell from her eyes.

Long Chen smiled and walked forward. Pill Valley’s disciples raised their weapons and summoned their manifestations, on full alert.

Long Chen walked right past the Pill Fairy. He didn’t look at her, and the Pill Fairy didn’t move. He walked right up to Wan Qing.

“You’ve gotten taller and bigger. You’ve gotten more beautiful as well. But you still haven’t gotten rid of this crying habit of yours. Have you run into any difficulty in alchemy?” Long Chen gently wiped away her tears. That action was the same as when they had first met.

“Big brother San!” Wan Qing suddenly hugged Long Chen and began to truly cry. “Why?! Why is it like this?! You two were so good together, accompanying me. I never felt so blessed. Why have you ended up as enemies? Why can’t I change anything, why...!?”

Wan Qing’s tears burst forth as she wept. In her heart, Long Chen and Pill Fairy were a natural pair, but now they were mortal enemies. Because of this, her heart felt like it was being torn in two. She was filled with grief and fear that swamped her other emotions.

The army of the various large powers had surrounded Long Chen. They had all found their own attack angles. The atmosphere was tense. With just one person’s orders, a full-force assault would be launched.

However, they were surprisingly quiet. There was only the low sound of the qi flow streams and the heart-wrenching cry of Wan Qing.

“Big brother San, please, can’t you all stop fighting? If I see any one of you die, I would rather die myself...”

Her crying showed her desire for peace, for a simple life. A life without slaughter, without fighting. But everyone knew that was just a beautiful dream, impossible to realize.

Long Chen sighed and gently patted her back. A stream of energy then flowed from him, making her faint. After that, he waved his hand, sending her floating to the Elders from Pill Valley. He had used his own special method to seal her Spiritual Strength. It would take at least a day for her to awake.

Long Chen finally turned to the Pill Fairy, walking in front of her.

“There’s no need for extra words. Today, let’s have a battle to the death to settle all our grudges.”
