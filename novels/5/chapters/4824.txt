Chapter 4813 Mysterious Armor

Stars flowed on top of Evilmoon, as if an entire cosmos had merged with it. This was Long Chen’s first time unleashing the full power of his astral energy since merging with the Heavenly Dao energy of the Sovereign Emperor Heaven.

Rather than summoning a manifestation, Long Chen poured the power of his stars directly. He wanted to test just how strong his power had grown.

When Long Chen’s astral energy erupted, an explosive power flowed into Zhang Benzhi. At first, the latter was just sneering, but when this energy was drawn into his manifestation, his expression completely changed.

The cloud sea behind him inflated like a balloon, unable to contain Long Chen’s explosive power.

BOOM!

The cloud sea behind Zhang Benzhi exploded, blown apart by Long Chen’s astral energy.

Blood sprayed from Zhang Benzhi as his robes were torn to tatters, revealing a dark gold skintight armor underneath.

“So he had armor underneath!” Xia Chen and the others realized upon seeing that. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

This soft armor of Zhang Benzhi’s was extremely odd. It was normally invisible, but when his life was threatened, it would automatically protect him, even safeguarding his head.

When Zhang Benzhi first grabbed Evilmoon, even Long Chen was tricked, believing that Zhang Benzhi truly dared to grasp the blade barehanded.

This armor was an ancient devil artifact, crafted with lost forging arts and treasured by Zhang Benzhi's family. It had silently aided him in slaying countless foes, its presence undetected even by Heaven Saints. However, Long Chen's relentless assault had forced this secret weapon to manifest.

“Cough, setting everything else aside, this fellow isn’t bad looking. He’s got long legs,” Guo Ran's weak voice suddenly interjected as he regained consciousness with the aid of the healing warriors.

“You pay attention to odd things,” Xia Chen remarked, somewhat dumbfounded by Guo Ran's sudden attention to a man's legs.

Just as Zhang Benzhi’s manifestation exploded and he hacked up blood, Long Chen thrust Evilmoon toward Zhang Benzhi’s chest.

Zhang Benzhi was seriously wounded. Seeing the blade, he waved his hand, but to his astonishment, nothing happened.

Zhang Benzhi was trying to summon his shield. However, he forgot that his shield had been destroyed by Long Chen.

With no other options left, he roared and slammed his hands together onto Evilmoon's blade, desperate to counter the impending strike. However, at this moment, two sharp blades broke through the void.

A sharp sword thrust toward Long Chen’s back, threatening him with a dual dilemma: if he continued to press his attack on Zhang Benzhi, he risked being struck from behind; if he attempted to defend against the sneak attack, Zhang Benzhi would seize the opportunity to counterattack. Long Chen found himself in a precarious position, caught between offense and defense.

Another sword tore the very heavens and launched almost concurrently with the sneak attack targeting Long Chen. This second strike was executed by Yue Zifeng, its Sword Qi cutting through the fabric of reality, revealing a blurred figure.

Unbeknownst to them until now, another formidable foe had materialized within the heavenly wall. As the hidden expert sneak attacked Long Chen, Yue Zifeng also launched his attack.

All of a sudden, the tables turned, catching even Xia Chen, Bai Shishi, and the others off-guard. They wanted to do something but didn’t know what to do.

The sword slashing toward Long Chen didn’t pause and neither did Evilmoon. At this moment, Long Chen trusted Yue Zifeng with his very life, leaving his life to his brother to guard.

Two explosive sounds rang out. Ultimately, the one sneak attacking Long Chen switched the direction of his attack toward Yue Zifeng’s sword. Long Chen’s bet paid off. After all, he refused to believe that anyone in the same realm could ignore Yue Zifeng’s attacks, unless that person wanted to die.

The second explosive sound came from Evilmoon. Before the impact, Zhang Benzhi’s armor blazed with light as it attempted to block Evilmoon.

He was truly worthy of being a peak expert of the Celestial race, his combat experience incomparable to that of Yue Wuxu.

Just as he folded his hands, divine light flowed between them, forming billions of imperceptible threads. In an instant, Evilmoon sliced through those threads, although its power and speed were notably diminished.

Initially, Evilmoon's tip would have struck Zhang Benzhi's chest before his hands could close around it. However, due to the interference of the divine threads, Zhang Benzhi managed to grab Evilmoon first.

Despite this, Evilmoon's tip viciously stabbed into Zhang Benzhi's chest but shockingly did not pierce through. The armor’s origins were definitely shocking. Zhang Benzhi’s chest caved in, and his back swelled from the impact.

“There’s an opening! All his power is concentrated on his chest!” shouted Evilmoon.

In truth, Long Chen also sensed something off. The moment Evilmoon stabbed Zhang Benzhi’s chest, the armor around his limbs became translucent.

Long Chen immediately twisted Evilmoon and slashed Zhang Benzhi’s leg.

“AH!” Zhang Benzhi screamed as one of his legs was cut off.

“His armor is no longer complete! Kill him!” shouted Evilmoon excitedly. Now that the armor was damaged, its defense had sharply dropped. The next attack would pierce through it.

Long Chen raised Evilmoon. However, all of a sudden, a terrifying pressure crashed down on Long Chen, accompanied by a furious shout. “You little bastard, let’s see who will save you today!”

A blood-red spear descended from the heavens, directed straight at Long Chen. Even before it landed, the irresistible pressure of a Heaven Saint unfurled.
