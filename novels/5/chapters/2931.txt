Chapter 2920 A Terrifying Figure

The stars behind Long Chen’s back shone brightly. It was as if an entire cosmos was on his back. The stars revolved with supreme might.

At the bottom of that cosmos was Long Chen in his black robes. His gaze was like that of a ruler, so imposing that others didn’t dare to look directly at him.

With the support of the star diagram, the mysterious feeling around him, and the way he crushed the indomitable Chu Kuang beneath his foot, it caused countless maidens to feel a rush of emotions.

“Bastard, that Starry River of the Sky Art is a forbidden technique! Who permitted him to train in it?!” roared Chu Huairen.

Chu Huairen was clearly starting to panic. He no longer had his old, calm confidence and was growing more and more uneasy. Long Chen was like a bottomless well. All kinds of trump cards were pouring out of him.

Chu Huairen had also heard of the Starry River of the Sky Art, and he knew about its terror. Since he had no idea how Long Chen had managed to successfully train in it, in his fury, he directly demanded who had responsibility over this.

“It was me. What about it?”

Suddenly, from an unremarkable seat, an old man in gray robes and a bamboo hat spoke up.

“Institute head!”

Countless people cried out in shock. That elder was the head of the Immortal Institute, and he had also run over here to watch at some point. No one had noticed him before.

For even the institute head to personally come to watch some little competition between outer academy disciples, it was practically inconceivable.

Chu Huairen had not expected him to appear here. Although he was one of the three heads of the DIscipline Institute, in terms of status, he was still a level lower than the head of the Immortal Institute.

He could only thicken his skin and say, “Long Chen is an outer academy disciple. He isn’t qualified to train in a forbidden technique. Don’t you think giving him this technique is unfair?”

The institute head slowly took off his hat, revealing a thin face. He had a white beard and white eyebrows. The wrinkles on his face were plenty and deep. Despite that, his gaze was extremely sharp, giving off a domineering and stubborn feeling.

“Aren’t you stretching the realm of your authority? Is the Discipline Institute planning on telling my Immortal Institute how to raise our disciples? Rules are rules. If a disciple wishes to read a forbidden technique, then the institute head will evaluate whether or not they are allowed to, based on individual circumstances. The academy raises its disciples with an emphasis on teaching each disciple what they need on an individual basis. Are you saying that I need to ask for your permission when I teach my disciples?” asked the institute head frostily, not giving Chu Huairen any face.

Those familiar with the institute head knew that he was an extremely strict and straightforward person. Moreover, he was always serious and rarely appeared in public. Even some Elders that had been in the academy for decades didn’t know what he looked like.

Chu Huairen was left speechless. He might be one of the three heads of the Discipline Institute, but that left him with only a third of the authority. He truly wasn’t in charge of whether or not Long Chen could cultivate the Starry River of the Sky Art.

Even if the institute head had given this technique to Long Chen for selfish reasons, it would not be up to him to criticize Long Chen. Since this was the case, his expression sank, and he could only sit back down.

The head judge couldn’t help having a small smile surfaced on his face. Chu Huairen was starting to panic and had run himself right into the tip of a spear. The head of the Immortal Institute was famed for his temper. He wouldn’t give any face to someone accusing him of something.

“Are you incubating an egg down there? Don’t secretly accumulate energy. I know you have more trump cards. Use them all. I won’t interrupt you.”

Just at this moment, Long Chen’s voice rang out in everyone’s ears, startling them. They hastily pulled their gaze from Chu Huairen’s panicked expression and looked at the battlefield.

Long Chen was actually floating in the air. With the star diagram behind him, ripples appeared around him, letting him stay in the air.

He was currently looking down at a large hole in the ground, his hands clasped behind him. After waiting and waiting, he finally spoke up.

Suddenly, chanting could be heard coming from down below. After that, a terrifying aura rose out of the giant hole, and Chu Kuang’s figure flew out of the ground.

“This aura…” At this moment, even the head of the Immortal Institute was shocked.

The head judge exclaimed, “He’s receiving god energy? Chu Kuang actually has a god he worships?”

Faith energy could go both ways. From the lower world, believers could pass this energy through the divine statues with a god’s mark in them. But it could also go the other way. A believer could receive a trace of the god’s power. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Chu Kuang was still suppressed even after receiving his faith energy, and now he was receiving god energy as a believer. This aura was something that made even those on the level of the head judge feel palpitations.

Although that power was nothing to them, it was the aura contained within that power that made them nervous. It meant that whoever it was that Chu Kuang believed in, it was an incredibly terrifying figure.

At this moment, the four balls of light behind Chu Kuang formed a square space, and within it was an illusory figure. That terrifying aura came from this figure.

“What is that?!”

This time, even Luo Bing was shocked. This Four Divine Beast Golden Body of Chu Kuang’s was completely different from what she knew of. The Luo family did not have records of this kind of divine ability.

Some kind of divine energy thrummed within Chu Kuang’s body, and this supreme god’s might made the world quiver. Chu Kuang’s aura was now completely different from before.

“Long Chen, kneel and face your death!” Chu Kuang’s voice echoed through the air. It was like an imperial edict, one that made everyone submit.

Everyone watching was stunned. How was it that Chu Kuang had become so terrifying?

Let alone Divine Flame disciples, even Four Peak Elders were horrified. This aura made them want to flee. It was an instinctual reverence from their souls.

Naturally, what they felt reverence for wasn’t Chu Kuang, but that aura coming from the figure behind him.

That figure was extremely hazy. It could only vaguely be seen to be human, but no further details could be seen. Even so, it was still absolutely terrifying.

However, Long Chen’s pupils shrank, and his eyes instantly turned red. The name of that figure roared through his mind.

“Lord Brahma!”
