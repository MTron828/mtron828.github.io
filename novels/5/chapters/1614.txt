When Long Chen charged into that black light, he immediately felt like he had landed in glue-like water. He found himself unable to move.

This strange water was binding him, and he couldn’t shake it off. Long Chen’s heart immediately sank. Was he about to be trapped in here for eternity?

“Let me!” Xie Qianqian suddenly opened her eyes. A white rune appeared on her forehead, and it transformed into a bright crescent moon that dispersed the sticky water.

The light from Xie Qianqian enveloped the two of them, forcing the water away. The two of them began to float up in a bubble.

“At least I showed some value in the end,” said Xie Qianqian with a smile.

Ever since encountering Long Chen, she had felt herself to be useless. She had even brought him down, but now she was able to help him resolve a predicament. That gratified her.

“This water possesses a strange energy that exists between the corporeal and incorporeal, a cross between reality and illusion. That’s why no matter how strong you are, you can’t do anything to it. It just so happens that the mental energy I cultivate is also between the corporeal and incorporeal, allowing me to block it,” explained Xie Qianqian.

“So that’s what it was. The world really is large. I’m just a frog at the bottom of a well,” sighed Long Chen. He truly knew little about the greater world.

“What are you talking about? You’re the bravest, strongest warrior I’ve ever seen. If you can come to my Alldevil star-field, then once I finish my studies, I’ll definitely create a set of battle armor that will increase your power by a hundred times, you’ll be undefeatable,” said Xie Qianqian excitedly.

In the Alldevil star-field, the human warriors weren’t very powerful. They relied on their tactics and inventions, creating powerful sets of armor to fight against the Alldevil race.

“A hundred times increase?” Long Chen jumped in shock.

“Actually, a hundred times would just be a base number. If the armor perfectly suits your bloodline power, you’ll be able to unleash even greater power. Unfortunately, I don’t even know what place you’re from, and I won’t be able to find you once we leave,” said Xie Qianqian sadly.

“Don’t be sad. I had no idea the outer world was so big before, but now that I know, I’ll definitely have to go out and see it. I’ll definitely come to find you. And if I didn’t go looking for you, one of my brothers would start crying and making a fuss,” laughed Long Chen.

He thought of Guo Ran. It seemed that the place Xie Qianqian was from was perfectly suited for Guo Ran. He would definitely go crazy trying to get there.

“Really? Great!” Xie Qianqian excitedly held Long Chen’s hand. “My Alldevil star-field isn’t too big. It only contains thirty-six hundred stars. The black stars belong to the Alldevil race, while the red stars are our territory. It’s easy to look for. When you go to the Alldevil star-field, go to any red star and ask for the Alldevil Slaying Dragon Academy. Everyone knows about it. I made so much profit this time. Not only will I be able to pay for my tuition, but it’ll also be enough to buy all kinds of material, experimental equipment, and various tools. So you definitely have to come find me. I swear I’ll make you the strongest armor in all of history.”

“Alright. It just so happens that I want to know more about the Alldevil race. I’ll take a trip there sooner or later,” said Long Chen.

The Alldevil monster he had encountered in Pill Valley’s Heaven Dragon Flame Region had said that Lord Brahma was someone who had betrayed his master.

Long Chen felt an intense hatred for Lord Brahma and Fallen Daynight that came from within his bones. If the Nirvana Scripture was created by Lord Brahma, then he should feel hatred for it as well, but he felt very familiar and close to the Nirvana Scripture instead.

This riddle had always disturbed him. Now that he knew the outside world was so big, he definitely had to take a trip there.

He felt a constant sense of crisis when it came to the Pill Sovereign memories and the origins of the Nine Star Hegemon Body Art. However, there was nothing he could do about that right now. He could only take things step by step.

“Here, let’s pinky swear. You will have to come and find me.” Xie Qianqian extended a hand with her pinky finger raised.

Long Chen laughed involuntarily. Xie Qianqian was really still a child inside. Having lost her parents suddenly had a big impact on her, forcing her to mature and become strong. However, inside her hard outer appearance was a kind, childish heart.

Long Chen also raised his pinky and locked it with hers. This could also count as a promise.

The two of them continued floating up, finally reaching the surface of the water. They looked around to see an endless black ocean. Above it was a layer of primal chaos.

There was a full moon shining brightly within the primal chaos. It lit up the black water. That was a strange sight.

In truth, that moon was no moon. It was a circular hole, but due to the distance, it looked like a moon.

“That should be the exit!” exclaimed Xie Qianqian.

Although the two of them were floating on the water, the laws of the Netherworld were still present. They couldn’t fly, and they couldn’t jump up there.

Xie Qianqian took a deep breath and circulated her mental energy. The two of them began to slowly float toward the sky.

“Hey, wait a second!”

Suddenly, Evilmoon’s voice rang out in Long Chen’s mind.

Ever since they had been sucked into the whirlpool and it had been forced to use up all its energy to protect Long Chen, Evilmoon had gone silent.

Long Chen knew that it was furious at him for being an idiot, and so it was ignoring him. As for Long Chen, he wasn’t foolish enough to try talking to it in its mood. Why bother getting himself cursed out?

However, he was surprised that Evilmoon would take the initiative to speak to him.

“Qianqian, wait a moment.” Long Chen quickly stopped Xie Qianqian. “Evilmoon, what is it?”

“Ah... well... sometimes, your actions aren’t entirely wrong...” Evilmoon hemmed and hawed.

“What? If you have something to say, then just say it,” said Long Chen.

“Fine, then I’ll say it directly. I sensed a treasure in the water here... It’ll be very useful to me...” said Evilmoon awkwardly.

Hearing that, Long Chen immediately understood why Evilmoon was hemming and hawing. It was embarrassed.

It had cursed Long Chen in its fury for being stupid and saving Xie Qianqian, but now there was something it needed in this place that they only came to because Long Chen had entered with Xie Qianqian. All its fury ended up being thrown back into its face.

However, that treasure had to be very important to it, or it wouldn’t thicken its face to ask for Long Chen’s help.

Long Chen couldn’t help but smile. If he mocked it a bit, he would definitely fully avenge all the cursing it gave him, but he didn’t do so. Although Evilmoon was an evil weapon, it was very prideful. Harming others to make oneself feel amazing was the most foolish thing to do. Long Chen definitely didn’t want to end up like the old man and Qu Jianying, hurting each other each time they opened their mouths.

Long Chen pointed. “Qianqian, can you go in that direction first? There’s something I need there.”

“Alright.” Xie Qianqian didn’t know what he wanted to do, but she brought him slowly floating in that direction.

When they got closer to the spot Evilmoon had indicated, Xie Qianqian turned pale. There was a giant black dragon lying on top of the water. It emitted a terrifying pressure.

Even Long Chen jumped in fright. There was actually a black dragon here. When he looked at its sharp fangs, he felt a stabbing pain in his soul.

“What is that?!” demanded Long Chen.

“Hehe, this is a close relative of my dark evil dragon race. They’re called purgatory evil dragons. It seems it had its dragon soul extracted and its corpse tossed here. However, its soul essence is still intact. That soul essence is perfect for me. I have to get it,” said Evilmoon. Its fury had completely vanished. Clearly, this purgatory evil dragon’s soul essence was much better for it than the energy it had obtained from the blood gourd.

Long Chen slowly approached the dragon’s corpse. Xie Qianqian was starting to pant, as she was unable to endure the dragon’s pressure.

“Qianqian, back up for now.” Long Chen grabbed onto one of the purgatory evil dragon’s scales and climbed up. The purgatory evil dragon was extremely terrifying. Its pressure rendered the laws present ineffective. He was able to move freely on its body without being stuck by the strange sticky energy present.

Once he climbed up, he came to fully appreciate just how huge the corpse was. It had to be measured in the thousands of miles. “Evilmoon, was your body this big originally as well?”

“Of course I was even bigger. Stop wasting words and go to its head. We have to extract its soul essence,” urged Evilmoon.

Long Chen climbed upward. He had to run a while on the dragon’s body to get to its head.

“Fuck, just a head is hundreds of miles wide.” Long Chen looked at the two soaring dragon horns with amazement.

“Keep going forward. A bit more. Okay, stop here,” directed Evilmoon.

Long Chen took a deep breath and stabbed Evilmoon into the skull.
