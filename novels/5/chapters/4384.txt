Chapter 4373 Unstoppable

Long Chen and the others left directly, heading straight to the humanless world. Their actions dumbfounded everyone who had gathered here.

People quickly reacted and entered the Great Desolate World. Seeing the devastation left behind, they were stunned, particularly at the sight of the massive rift in the void intermittently spitting out spatial blades

“Could it be…?”

People’s hearts shook, and they immediately headed deeper into the Great Desolate World. After that, a shocking piece of news quickly spread.

All the Great Desolate World’s lifeforms had been slain, and the world was covered in blood, like hell on earth.

When this news spread, it shook the entire Nirvana Overflow Heaven. Before this, Long Chen had sealed the gate, blocking them from knowing what was going on inside.

However, they could see that the gate was sealed by a human formation, so they didn’t dare to attack it. Given Long Chen’s domineering character, whoever dared to attack it would have to be tired of living.

Based on their estimations though, in the end, Long Chen would end up in negotiations with the Great Desolate World’s lifeforms. While Long Chen was powerful, they believed that the Great Desolate World had their trump cards.

As long as both sides didn’t want to end up in mutual destruction, they would have to settle things with negotiations. Once they reached a mutually acceptable agreement, they would shake hands and agree to a ceasefire.

However, these people had never dreamed that Long Chen was even more powerful than their expectations, outright annihilating all lifeforms from the Great Desolate World. They were scared witless. This was too vicious.

“Quick, go to the humanless world! There’s going to be an even bigger scene to watch!”

People quickly reacted and rushed to the humanless world. Having missed one immense battle, they couldn’t miss the second.

“Kill!”

When they arrived, they saw that the battle had commenced. Numerous experts were guarding the entrance to the humanless world, while Long Chen led the Dragonblood Legion in a crazy slaughter.

“World Extermination Flame Lotus!”

Long Chen unleashed an enormous flame lotus that instantly covered over half of the battlefield.

BOOM!

The flame lotus erupted, blasting countless experts out of existence. A terrifying heat then unfurled.

“World Extermination Lightning Radiance!”

Long Chen directly switched energies, unleashing a lightning sphere that exploded amongst their ranks.

“Courting death!” A furious roar came from the distance as countless experts of the humanless world were wiped out. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Following that, a golden figure came charging over. It was the golden Peng, one of the Eight Great Kings from the humanless world.

Before Long Chen and his companions arrived, Long Chen was worried about someone alerting the humanless world, so he had Xia Chen set up a transportation formation to bring them here much faster.

With it, the Dragonblood Legion arrived first and started a slaughter. On the other hand, due to their numbers, the others had to follow as quickly as they could.

Everything went as Long Chen had anticipated. Back in the Great Desolate World, they had sealed the gate behind them, preventing information from going out. With them being inside for over a month, people assumed they were engaged in negotiations. As this period extended, the humanless world’s vigilance started to wane.

Many of their top experts went back into seclusion, including the Eight Great Kings, as they strived to enhance their strength as much as possible to face Long Chen.

Hence, Long Chen’s sudden appearance caught them off-guard. The three Eternal experts guarding the gate were swiftly dispatched by Long Chen, Yue Zifeng, and Guo Ran before they could comprehend what was happening.

While millions of humanless world’s experts gathered here, they were facing the Dragonblood Legion. They had no power to resist. Furthermore, with their three Eternal experts slain, they were like a headless flock of sheep, rapidly falling to the blades of the Dragonblood warriors. Alarms quickly reached the other experts of the humanless world, prompting them to rush to the scene. Among them, the golden Peng was the fastest, and upon seeing Long Chen, his eyes instantly turned red.

BOOM!

A golden pair of wings swiftly covered the sky, and a ray of golden light emanated from his mouth, shooting toward Long Chen.

This void-breaking golden divine light was infused with primal chaos qi, showing that he was also rooted in primal chaos. This was a rare attack containing the power of primal chaos.

Long Chen knew that this was the golden Peng’s strongest killing move. However, he simply extended his hand. Seven stars appeared on his palm as he faced this attack directly.

The golden light smashed into Long Chen’s palm, resembling a torrent of water crashing into a boulder. As a result, the golden light scattered through the sky.

“The power of the seven stars has strengthened once more. It really is as I thought. The Nine Star Hegemon Body Art is a cultivation technique focused on killing. The more you kill, the stronger it gets. Before the Great Desolate World, I would've needed to pay a certain price to block this attack, but now I don’t even need to care about it.” Long Chen looked at the scattered golden light with excitement.

“I really dislike killing for power, maybe I am afraid of becoming an icy killing machine. However, Aunt Gong reminded me that I need the power to kill in this world. By rejecting this, I defied the fundamental will of the Nine Star Hegemon Body Art. Fortunately, I have come to realize that killing isn’t frightening. The real frightening thing is not knowing what you are killing for. That’s enough!” Long Chen sensed the power coming from his palm and felt a burning heat inside of him. Even the Kunpeng’s divine ability was unable to shake him.

BOOM!

Suddenly, Long Chen let out a shout, and his own Kunpeng wings quivered. He then pushed with his palm and flew against the golden light until his palm reached the Kunpeng’s enormous head.

Seeing this scene, the Kunpeng instantly had a bad feeling and spun through the air, his enormous body nimbly dodging Long Chen’s palm.

BOOM!

Long Chen’s palm suddenly unleashed a blow that left an enormous hole in the void.

Looking at that hole, the Kunpeng was covered in icy sweat. If he hadn’t dodged that, this palm would have killed him.

As Long Chen executed a kick mid-air, astral winds erupted and struck the Kunpeng in the wings, sending him flying through the air.

Golden feathers flew through the air as the Kunpeng grunted, his wings almost broken by the force of this kick. Shocked and enraged, the Kunpeng, a member of a mutated golden wing branch of the Kunpeng race renowned for its formidable physical body, struggled to comprehend how Long Chen's kick had caused such damage.

“Kunpeng Heaven Splitter!” the golden Kunpeng roared with fury. In an instant, he extended his claws toward the sky, gripping the void. The sky ripped open like paper, and a crack extended toward Long Chen.

This was the strongest divine ability of the Kunpeng race. Once that crack reached someone, even an Eternal divine weapon would be torn apart, let alone a human.

“Kunpeng Heaven Splitter? Alright, Long Chen Heaven Repairer!”

Long Chen sneered, and when that crack reached him, he grabbed both ends of the tear and slammed them together.

BOOM!

As this divine ability was broken, the Kunpeng quivered and suddenly spat out a mouthful of blood.

“Split the Heavens 1!”

The Seven Peak Sword slashed toward the Kunpeng race’s heavenly genius.

In the next instant, an enormous head flew through the air, and blood fell from the sky.
