Chapter 4115 : Joining Forces to Slay a Domain Lord

Another dark domain lord emerged, leaving the Fullmoon race’s experts utterly bewildered. This had never occurred throughout all of history.

BOOM!

Xu Jianxiong was the first to respond, rushing toward the emerging dark domain lord. Meanwhile, Uncle Tree quickly aided Long Chen. The sudden appearance of this new dark domain lord really disrupted the battlefield's rhythm and caused chaos.

Countless branches directly surged, forming a wooden wall in front of Long Chen, but they were immediately torn apart by the dark domain lord.

“Uncle Tree, buy me some time. Brothers, let’s work together to kill this dark domain lord! Changchuan, you go first!” shouted Long Chen.

Xu Changchuan had long since wanted to test himself against a dark domain lord. So, upon hearing this order, afraid that the race leader would stop him, he stepped forward without hesitation. His manifestation grew illusory as all of its power poured into his bone spear, stabbing into the dark domain lord like a shooting star.

The Fullmoon race’s experts let out startled cries as Xu Changchuan’s attack pierced through the opening made by the countless branches tying down the dark domain lord. At this moment, its six arms were all tearing at the branches, creating the perfect opportunity for Xu Changchuan to attack.

“Die!”

Xu Changchuan seldom cooperated with anyone in battle, so he didn’t even think about how to launch his attack. Fortunately, all he had to do was unleash his full power and not hold back at all. Just like that, his spear solidly struck the dark domain lord’s chest.

To everyone’s surprise, ink-like blood sprayed out of the dark domain lord’s chest. Xu Changchuan’s spear really did manage to pierce its defenses.

It had to be known that the dark domain lords were covered in golden runes, and their bodies were incredibly tough. In all this time, Xu Jianxiong had not broken its defenses once, but Xu Changchuan had done it.

“Fullmoon divine radiance! Has Changchuan’s sacred energy already surpassed the race leader’s?!” The Fullmoon experts were stunned and overjoyed by this finding.

On the other hand, the dark domain lord let out a furious roar of pain.

“Fall back!” yelled Long Chen. However, Xu Changchuan’s reaction was a bit slow as he was still immersed in the pleasant surprise of breaking the dark domain lord’s defenses.

BOOM!

As a result, Xu Changchuan’s spear exploded with a quiver from the dark domain lord’s body. Blood then sprayed out of his mouth as he was sent backward.

“Dragonblood Cross Slash!”

.

Guo Ran’s roar tore through the air as his crossed sabers shimmered in front of him. Behind him, each Dragonblood warrior summoned their Dragon Blood Battle Armor and placed their hands on the person in front of them, channeling all of their energy into Guo Ran’s body.

When a giant cross left his golden sabers, it tore through the laws of heaven and earth. This attack containing the full power of the Dragonblood warriors struck the dark domain lord directly.

The impact crushed the branches binding the dark domain lord and caused countless cracks to appear throughout its body. It then flew back while coughing up mouthfuls of black blood.

In an instant, Long Chen appeared behind it with the Minghong Saber and unleashed three consecutive slashes of his saber, each slash retaining the force of the previous one. On the fourth slash, the dark domain lord finally reached him. His timing was perfect.

“Split the Heavens 4!”

BOOM!

Long Chen’s saber solidly slashed onto the dark domain lord’s back. Due to the powerful force, the fabric of space was destroyed, leaving a big hole in the ground, and the Grand Dao runes flew about. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

When the dust settled, they saw the dark domain lord at the bottom of the hole, its body covered in cracks. However, shockingly, it was not dead yet. Its body was squirming as if it was struggling to stand.

Long Chen then thrust the Minghong Saber at its forehead where a golden rune resided, shattering it.

The dark domain lord shook intensely before becoming still, all its golden runes dimmed. It was finally dead.

“Success!”

The Dragonblood warriors cheered. With their combined power, they managed to kill a dark domain lord. That was definitely something to be proud of.

After dragging the dark domain lord’s corpse back into the formation, he checked on Xu Changchuan and found that his aura was listless. Even the aura of his life was extremely weak. Hence, Long Chen couldn’t help but be shocked.

“Don’t worry, his innate divine weapon is his rhinoceros horn. With its destruction, his Yuan Spirit received a shock. However, our race has a miraculous self-recovery ability. We will naturally grow another horn if the old one is destroyed, and this new one will be even stronger. It’s a good thing for Changchuan. The dark domain lord’s dark energy entered his body, and with that stimulation, he will be able to awaken the Fullmoon divine radiance even sooner,” said an elder of the Fullmoon race excitedly.

They had checked Xu Changchuan’s body. The dark energy filling his body was trying to destroy his Fullmoon divine radiance, but the Fullmoon divine radiance was still shining strong, constantly fighting the invasion of the dark energy. Once Xu Changchuan woke up, he would definitely become even stronger.

Just then, Xu Jianxiong also returned, as the dark domain lord he was fighting had fled. It was most likely recovering its dark energy again.

Previously, Xu Jianxiong had unleashed his full power to try to kill it as quickly as possible to assist the others, but then he saw that Long Chen had settled things, so he just let his opponent off.

Xu Jianxiong personally checked Xu Changchuan’s body. When he was done, a gratified smile appeared on his face.

“The heavens are assisting my Fullmoon race. It seems that we really do have hope of reviving. Send Changchuan into the ancestral spirit totem. Let the ancestral spirit look after him.”

“Yes!”

The elders of the Fullmoon race immediately brought Xu Changchuan away excitedly. After the incident, the way they looked at Long Chen and the others changed.

Now, they were full of reverence and gratitude to Long Chen and his companions. After all, their arrival had caused the entire Fullmoon race to change, letting them see hope for their race’s rise. Long Chen and the others must be the Fullmoon race’s lucky stars.

At this moment, Guo Ran took out a hammer and struck the dark domain lord’s corpse. Each strike only caused sparks and some metallic ringing.

“What is this? How is it so hard yet so flexible? I can’t do that with my battle armor.” After testing it for a long time, Guo Ran finally managed to knock off one rune from the dark domain lord’s body.

“Even our Fullmoon race doesn’t know much about the dark creatures. They came from an unknown world, and we know nothing about that world,” said Xu Jianxiong.

“It doesn’t matter whether we know it or not. What is important is that the Sage King Convention is about to start, so we have to accelerate our cultivation. We’ll use the dark creatures to raise our realms quickly. It would be best if we all become peak Immortal Kings before the Sage King Convention.”

“Boss, we’re not worried for ourselves, but you… will you be alright?” Guo Ran and the others looked at Long Chen worriedly. After all, he had just broken through to the second Heavenstage of the Immortal King realm.

Hearing this, Long Chen stuffed Immortal King Pills into his mouth like they were beans. He mumbled, “That’s no problem! I’ll show you what real speed is.”

After saying that, Long Chen charged back into the battlefield once more.
