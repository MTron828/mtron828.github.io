Chapter 2774 Saints Arise

The Nine-Headed Lion raised his head and roared. His roar cracked the sky. Compared to Ye Ming, his aura was many times stronger.

All of a sudden, the Nine-Headed Lion vanished, reappearing right in front of Mo Nian and the others. He blocked their path back to the barrier.

He then unleashed a claw, one that shattered the laws of space. It encompassed Mo Nian, Wilde, Zi Yan, and Ye Zhiqiu at the same time.

Seeing this, Wilde smashed the Western Desert Ax. Whether or not the Nine-Headed Lion had become a Sovereign, the first thing to do was smash his ax.

As a result, Wilde was sent smashing into the ground like a shooting star by the Nine-Headed Lion’s claw.

“They’re not on the same level!”

Mo Nian was shocked. Despite both being Sovereigns, the Nine-Headed Lion was far stronger than Ye Ming.

They had all been misled by Ye Ming’s power. They thought that all the other worlds’ Sovereigns would be at this power level. However, this one blow from the Nine-Headed Lion told them that there was an immense difference.

Zi Yan’s hands quickly played, unleashing waves at the Nine-Headed Lion. However, the Nine-Headed Lion suddenly roared and a ripple spread. Zi Yan’s hands were blown off her zither, shocking her. Her Devil Soul Refining Song had been interrupted.

“Do you think that I’m like that idiot who thinks himself smart? Ye Ming took a shortcut to get ahead, sacrificing the Corrupt path’s people to forcibly raise his cultivation base. It’s absolutely laughable that he didn’t realize that sacrificing the Corrupt God’s believers would cause their faith energy to interfere with his power as a Sovereign. He is unable to properly condense his Sovereign power. Although his aura is strong, it’s just a scary appearance. His true combat power is lacking far too much,” sneered the Nine-Headed Lion. He once more roared, “Long Chen, shouldn’t you come out and face your death?!”

“You want Long Chen to come out? Are you planning on preparing your lion head for stew?” mocked Mo Nian. However, inside, he was cursing. This sudden turn was terrible for them.

As more of the other worlds’ lifeforms were brought in and slaughtered, blood soul energy filled the entire continent. Mo Nian then noticed that giant spatial gates had appeared in the direction of Devil Spirit Mountain, the Yin Yang World, the Corrupt God Cemetery, and Ancient Battlefield. The gate was slowly opening, and it had yet to fully open. Furthermore, there was a terrifying aura behind it.

“First think of a way to get rid of one!” Mo Nian suddenly sent a message to Zi Yan, Ye Zhiqiu, and Wilde. Now that they were facing two Sovereigns, they had to get rid of one. Their target was Ye Ming.

The four of them then attacked him at the same time. They had to first eliminate him in order to have a chance.

“Hmph, Ye Ming might be a fool, but I won’t just watch as you kill him,” said the Nine-Headed Lion, unleashing a claw at Mo Nian.

The Nine-Headed Lion was the supreme expert of the demonic beast race, and he instantly saw that the real threat to Ye Ming was Mo Nian. However, Mo Nian could also be said to be the weakest in close-range combat, so the Nine-Headed Lion immediately attacked him.

Mo Nian let off nine arrows that flew toward the Nine-Headed Lion from different directions. Every arrow was different, with some fast, some slow, some fierce, and some sinister.

“Are you trying to tickle me?” sneered the Nine-Headed Lion. His nine heads then glowed, summoning a barrier around him. Those nine arrows exploded on contact with him.

Mo Nian was truly shaken. The Nine-Headed Lion was on a completely different level compared to Ye Ming. His arrows were capable of threatening Ye Ming but not the Nine-Headed Lion.

If the exploding arrows couldn’t strike his actual body, then they were nothing more than flashy fireworks.

With their hasty plan interrupted, Wilde immediately came to assist Mo Nian. If the two of them were to fight one against one, it would be dangerous for Mo Nian.

Ye Zhiqiu also came to assist them, so Zi Yan went out to face Ye Ming alone. At this moment, the Southern Sea Zither quivered and divine swords slashed out of it.

Ye Ming had been previously seriously injured, and seeing Zi Yan lock him down with her zither blades, he roared furiously.

He felt so stifled that he was dying inside. He had sacrificed some power in order to advance to the Sovereign realm as quickly as possible. That way, he could take the core before everyone else. However, now, he simply looked like an idiot.

He had seriously underestimated the foundation of the Martial Heaven Continent and the five Sovereigns. The current him was now a giant laughingstock.

Even all on her own, Zi Yan was tying down Ye Ming temporarily. Meanwhile, Wilde, Mo Nian, and Ye Zhiqiu were being suppressed by the Nine-Headed Lion. With every exchange, Wilde was sent flying; his hands were covered in blood from the impacts.

“Long Chen, have you become a tortoise hiding in the shell? Fine, then today I’ll slaughter all of you!” laughed the Nine-Headed Lion, his attacks growing even sharper.

Within the barrier, Ling Yunzi leaned forward slightly, only to be held back by the High Priest. “Our power must be saved. Every bit of time we can stall is to our advantage. It still isn’t the moment.”

Ling Yunzi nodded. Although Mo Nian, Wilde, and Ye Zhiqiu were in a dangerous situation, it still hadn’t reached a critical moment. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

If they were really about to die, the supreme items that they had would prioritize protecting them. However, at that time, the Sovereigns’ barrier being supported by the five supreme divine items’ power would crumble.

Suddenly, people began to stand within the barrier. Gu Yang, Li Qi, Song Mingyuan, Yue Zifeng, Guo Ran, Xia Chen, Meng Qi, Chu Yao, Tang Wan-er, Dong Mingyu, Liu Ruyan, Yue Xiaoqian, Cloud, and the others began to awaken.

They had reached the Saint realm. After reaching it, they automatically awakened because their cultivation bases could no longer rise any higher.

The Saint realm was their current limit. As the Martial Heaven Continent’s karmic luck had to be focused on Long Chen, they couldn’t make any further breakthroughs.

To become an expert required talent, effort, as well as the support of the karmic luck of the Heavenly Daos.

Nangong Zuiyue, Beitang Rushuang, Ximen Tianxiong, Hu Feng, Ye Lingshan, and the others also woke up. They had all become Saints.

“Senior, let us fight. Mo Nian and the others can’t last much longer,” said Guo Ran, his armor appearing on him.
