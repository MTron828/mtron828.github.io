Chapter 2815 Beating an Examiner

It all happened so fast. In just the first clash, the big-chinned fellow’s jaw was broken by Long Chen.

The sound of bones breaking made people shiver. With a painful grunt, the big-chinned fellow tumbled to the ground.

His head was dizzy. He had never imagined that a disciple of the Pill Institute would possess such power.

Alchemists were similar to soul cultivators, so their physical bodies were their weakest aspect. Because of this, the big-chinned man had never viewed Long Chen as a real opponent. His view of Long Chen was that he was thin and weak. Hence, he didn’t expect to be crushed in the first exchange.

Long Chen then walked up to him while he was still befuddled and stamped his foot down twice, breaking that man’s hands. His movements were sharp and ruthless.

His foot then stamped onto his chest. As a result, the man hacked up blood, trying to struggle. But Long Chen’s foot was like a mountain pressing down on him, making him unable to use any power. His face then turned purple as he was like a frog being crushed. He looked like he would explode at any moment.

“You are ill. Your head is sick, and your jaw is also problematic. Let me help you fix them.” Long Chen slapped the big-chinned man’s broken jaw, and a bone flew out of it.

Hence, the big-chinned man screamed, and blood gushed out from his mouth. All of a sudden, his chest caved in as his sternum was broken.

“You’re breaking the rules! Capture him!” Only now did the examiner recover from his shock. With a furious roar, eight teaching assistants attacked Long Chen with rods. After that, those rods whistled toward him.

“Scram!” Long Chen’s shout was thunderous. With a slash of his sword, those eight rods were shattered, but his sword was also broken. The eight of them were then sent flying, their hands bleeding. They could only stare in shock.

Someone who possessed such a dense mortal qi actually possessed such power? It was like a barbarian dragon was hidden within his body.

The examiner was also stunned. Long Chen kicked aside his opponent and then walked toward the examiner, causing his expression to change.

“What… what are you doing-?!” He wasn’t even done speaking before he was sent flying by a slap from Long Chen. He tumbled into the distance and smashed into the wall before he came to a stop. He then struggled to stand, only to cough up a mouthful of blood and faint.

“Brother, you’ve beaten an examiner. This is no small matter. Come with me. I’ll find senior apprentice-sister Qingyun for you. She will help you,” said the man who had been driven away by the big-chinned man.

Long Chen was about to ask who this senior apprentice-sister Qingyun was when a cold snort came from the entrance.

“Does Mu Qingyun have the guts to do so?”

A group of people walked in. There were over ten of them. They wore white robes, their divine energy fluctuations looking like burning flames around them.

Their leader was a lean man with a sharp mouth and monkey cheeks. His face was gaunt, and his cheekbones were high, making him look like a monkey in clothes. He walked to the front with his chin raised arrogantly.

“Careful, this person is an expert on the divine rankings. Whatever they say, ignore it. I trust that senior apprentice-sister Qingyun will rush over soon as well,” whispered that man.

“That’s a bit difficult.” Long Chen didn’t know why this guy would help him or who this Qingyun was, but when it came to ignoring what these people said, that was probably impossible.

However, he was growing more interested. These disciples were actually able to so openly and brazenly interfere with the exams, affecting the fairness of the academy. Did the God Institute really not care? Was it already rotten to the bone?

“You dare to ruin the exam and beat an examiner. Brat, you have guts. I like it.” The lean man examined Long Chen and spoke indifferently.

“Ah, I’d ask you not to disgust me with this act. A human-looking monkey is quite vile to normal humans like me.” Long Chen frowned.

A snicker rang out from the distance. Long Chen looked over to see another group of white-robed God Institute disciples walking over.

Their leader was a woman with a certain charm to her. She was beautiful but also possessed a cold majesty. Just from her looks, she appeared to be a powerful expert.

Her expression was a bit off, as if she wanted to laugh but was bitterly enduring it. However, the two women beside her had already lost control.

It seemed that they had never heard a similar kind of speaking style as Long Chen. Despite knowing that this wasn’t the time to laugh, they couldn’t hold back.

Meanwhile, the money-like man’s eyes blazed with fire. He was actually insulted by a brat who had just joined the academy, and it was in front of so many people. All of a sudden, he extended a hand, his claw reaching for Long Chen’s throat.

In return, Long Chen’s hand slapped across his face, and a palm-image struck his chest, sending him flying into the distance. He collapsed. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

Long Chen and the woman stared at each other in surprise. Long Chen had attacked almost instinctively, striking that man in the face. But the woman’s attack had arrived at almost the same time. She had clearly done it to save him.

Meanwhile, the woman was shocked due to knowing just how shameless and vicious that skinny monkey man was. He had no qualms about attacking weaker people, so she had been prepared to interfere the instant he struck.

However, Long Chen had somehow struck him first despite being attacked first. Furthermore, the power of his palm was so great that even without her attack, that monkey man wouldn’t be able to injure him. Also, his attack had come completely naturally, like a flowing stream, amazing her.

She walked up to Long Chen. “What a beautiful technique. With your mortal aura, you must be an ascender. For you to have such a technique, you must have been an overlord in your lower world. Ah, I apologize, let me introduce myself. I am Mu Qingyun. I still don’t know your name…?”

Long Chen was about to answer when a sneer rang out. “The mighty Mu Qingyun is actually lowering herself to a newcomer? Do you not have any confidence in the next competition for the rankings? How vile and laughable.”
