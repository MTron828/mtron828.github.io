Chapter 4004 The Winged Devil Race Again

Countless devil experts attacked Long Chen as soon as he passed through the gate. This time, their cultivation bases were no longer in the Immortal King realm but in the World King realm.

BOOM!

A devil expert’s saber slashed into Long Chen’s shoulder. However, its saber was the one shattered. Its body also exploded, the fragments of its corpses scattering to the ground.

“Damn, just how powerful is my current physical body?”

Long Chen simply wanted to test the power of his physical body by receiving this attack. However, he hadn’t expected the resulting backlash to directly blow up the attacker.

Seeing the other devil experts attacking, Long Chen just stood there and allowed them to attack him. As a result, they were all blown apart just from attacking him. The replicated devil experts turned to dust, and those that possessed actual physical bodies exploded into chunks of flesh.

Long Chen raised his arms. Looking at his own hands, he was overjoyed. The current him was only in his normal state. He hadn’t summoned his Dragon Blood Battle Armor, but he was already this powerful.

This trial by fire had truly made his power soar. The Dragon Soul Body Forging Art was truly terrifying, beyond his expectations.

With a roar, Long Chen suddenly shot forward like a shooting star, blowing apart all the devil experts who were in his way. They might as well have been clumps of paper.

That refreshing feeling of blasting through his enemies made Long Chen laugh delightedly. With this power, who could block him? Long Aotian, Kun Tu, who cared? He would crush them with a single punch next time.

BOOM!

Suddenly, Long Chen came to a stop. His body finally met an object that he couldn’t blast through, and the high-speed impact left him with stars spinning in his eyes. After stabilizing his body, he slowly climbed up and realized that he had reached the tenth gate.

“Fuck!”

Long Chen rubbed his head as an egg-sized bump rose out of his forehead. This gate was too hard, wasn’t it?

He circulated his life energy, and when the lump went down, he walked through the slight crack that had appeared when he crashed into it.

As soon as he did so, a sharp claw whistled toward him. Long Chen then raised his hand and caught that claw with his bare hand. The attacker was a ferocious-looking devil expert covered in scales.

With its claws caught, the devil expert suddenly opened its mouth, and a blood-colored sword shot out of it.

Long Chen twisted his head, narrowly dodging the sword. Just then, the devil expert’s other claw silently stabbed toward his abdomen. Its reactions and moves were all quick and vicious.

BANG!

Long Chen raised his foot, striking the devil expert in the abdomen. The immense power sent it flying while its arm remained in Long Chen’s grasp.

“Divine Venerate realm. It has both power and combat experience. I don’t think everyone can pass through…” Long Chen’s expression changed.

Considering Long Chen’s current power, for him to have not killed that devil expert with this kick meant that its physical body was extremely powerful. Furthermore, it had immense combat experience and was also capable of using magical arts. This was no longer a simple trial by fire.

The first to third levels were pressure trials, and the fourth to sixth levels were combat trials. But the fourth and fifth levels were actually just a warm-up for this cruel battlefield in the sixth level.

Just as Long Chen sank into thought, the devil expert that he had kicked away came roaring back.

Long Chen then unleashed a punch, and that furious roar was instantly cut off. This devil transformed into a rain of blood.

“It was a true body of flesh and blood, not an ordinary puppet. No wonder it could use magical arts,” murmured Long Chen.

It seemed that this trial land was also a prison with an unknown number of devil experts inside. They were released inside when the trial was activated.

While these devils were not Supremes, their presence exuded an ancient aura, suggesting that they were not beings from this era. Furthermore, their strength far surpassed that of ordinary Divine Venerates.

Also, the way they activated their magical arts and divine abilities was different. They were activated rapidly, and the slightest carelessness would cause a person to be struck by it. This trial was truly bloody.

However, when Long Chen entered, there was only a single devil beside him, not a huge army. Clearly, this trial also gave people some buffer room.

Suddenly, the space quivered once more, and another devil materialized. It immediately pounced on Long Chen, only to be swiftly sent flying with a single kick.

That creature lay on the ground, but it didn't give up. Pressing with its feet, it shot a bone arrow directly at Long Chen. The projectile reached him almost instantaneously after being unleashed.Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

Long Chen managed to catch the bone arrow, but he was taken aback by its immense power which caused his hand to tremble slightly.

At the same time, a piercing scent entered his nose. He then saw many small holes at the tip of the bone arrow with black spots inside.

“There’s poison?” Long Chen’s heart shook. If struck by this thing, it would be fatal.

Just then, that devil expert attacked once more with a sharp bone blade.

Unbothered by it, Long Chen shattered the bone blade with a punch and smashed the devil expert into the ground. At the same time, three more bone arrows shot out of its back. Its bone arrows were shockingly powerful.

“This thing’s too dangerous. I’m confiscating it.” Long Chen tossed the bone arrows into the primal chaos space.

The devil expert let out a furious roar as it continued to struggle wildly, but Long Chen was determined and kept pressing it into the ground. As he observed the creature, he noticed its teeth flickering with a cold light. Without hesitation, Long Chen summoned a pair of pliers, ready to take action.

Even with all the devil’s struggling, Long Chen managed to pluck out all its sharp teeth. He only released it after it was no longer a threat.

The devil roared, but having lost its blade, bone arrows, and teeth, it could only hit Long Chen with its fists, unable to harm him. Long Chen simply kicked it away.

He didn’t slay it, because he knew that once it was dead, the formation would replace it.

The reason he did this was because he was worried about Yu Qingxuan and the others being injured by this devil expert. The poison arrows would instantly kill the imperial disciples if they were struck.

Long Chen then continued onward. When he encountered dozens of devils, he stripped them of their fatal weapons and then ignored them. After walking thirty miles, they stopped chasing him and returned to the entrance. Under the control of the formation, their movements were limited to a certain area.

Long Chen encountered more and more devils, and they grew increasingly powerful. On the sixth step, a man with bat wings blocked his path.

“Winged devil race? And a Supreme too.” Long Chen’s heart shook.

“Damnable human race, do you know what you’ve done?!”

To his surprise, this winged devil expert actually spoke.
