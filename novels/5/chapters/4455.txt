Chapter 4444 Sacred Dragon Shield

The swords appeared as dark as ink, each measuring three feet in length. Strange dragon marks covered even the hilts and blades, emitting a sharp aura capable of unsettling even the soul.

These swords were identical to the one that had just exterminated the Eternal expert. People had originally thought that it was a divine weapon, but now they were shocked to see that the swords were condensations of Netherdragon Tianzhao’s essence blood runes, reminiscent of the fangs of a poison dragon that was glinting with a cold light.

They were absolutely horrified. The notion that a single sword had the potential to annihilate an Eternal expert left them wondering about the implications of millions of such swords in the sky, all directed at Long Chen.

Despite the swords being aimed at Long Chen, the spectators couldn't help but shudder at the sight. Netherdragon Tianzhao's divine ability was truly terrifying, capable of effortlessly slaughtering even Eternal experts. The budding Doyens were finally witnessing the true extent of Netherdragon Tianzhao's power, and it deeply moved them.

Netherdragon Tianzhao not only hailed from a prestigious lineage but also wielded immense strength. Following such a person promised limitless prospects and the chance to become awakened Doyens.

“So you were spreading your dragon blood energy throughout the entire battlefield before this. Like this, if you encounter danger, you can instantly teleport to anywhere at any time. What a technique.”

Long Chen ignored the ominous swords in the sky, choosing instead to analyze how Netherdragon Tianzhao had dodged his previous attack and swiftly retaliated.

Although Long Chen had never encountered such a divine ability before, his awakened dragon blood runes provided him with a vague understanding of the move. These insights felt like ancestral memories inherited through his dragon blood lineage.

Realizing that all dragon race divine abilities originated from the true dragon, Long Chen sensed a familiarity in the essence of this move.

Just now, it really had been dangerous. Based on Long Chen’s experience, Netherdragon Tianzhao should have had no way to dodge the attack, and blocking it head-on would have left him in a disadvantageous position.

Unexpectedly, Netherdragon Tianzhao had the ability to teleport freely across the battlefield, defying common sense. Long Chen quickly contemplated this unusual feat. For an ordinary individual, such teleportation required a tranquil space.

While teleportation and transportation were about the same in concept, the key difference lay in distance and preparation time. Teleportation demanded instantaneous movement, requiring minimal time but limited to short distances.

Unlike teleportation, transportation relied on fixed nodes for movement between locations. These nodes were stationary, and the space between them needed to be tranquil. Amidst the ongoing chaotic battle, where the Heavenly Daos were highly unstable, someone like Xia Chen was unable to undergo any kind of transportation. However, Netherdragon Tianzhao was different.

With his bloodline runes floating in the void, he was capable of moving between them freely. Even on a chaotic battlefield, he was still capable of doing so.

This was an extremely terrifying ability, and it even managed to catch Long Chen off-guard. If Long Chen had reacted the slightest bit slower, he would have been struck by that sword.

Netherdragon Tianzhao was also shocked that Long Chen had seen through the essence of this technique. After all, it was one of the most advanced techniques of the nether dragon race, known only to a select few of them. Furthermore, those capable of using it were less than a handful.

Hence, the fact that the secret art was instantly seen through left Netherdragon Tianzhao in disbelief. However, he still sneered, “You’re quite sharp. But in front of absolute power, all resistance is futile.”

“You’re right. But are you the one with absolute power?” retorted Long Chen.

“All I know is that absolute power isn’t decided by the mouth,” Netherdragon Tianzhao snorted. He swiftly formed hand seals, and millions of swords behind him shot toward Long Chen, causing ear-piercing spatial-breaking sounds to ring out. It was like the sound of ghouls demanding Long Chen’s life.

There was no way to dodge this, and Long Chen couldn’t hide anywhere. It was a terrifying move that sparked despair.

“Before this, I really wouldn’t have known what to do against this move. But now…”

Long Chen smiled and slammed his hands together. With his thumbs and forefingers connected, he slowly pushed forward. As he spread his hands, two golden suns appeared on his palms.

Countless runes and golden strands emerged from within the golden suns, transforming into an enormous shield in front of Long Chen.

As those black swords slammed into the golden shield, everyone expected it to be torn through like paper. However, to their surprise, the swords exploded on contact.

“What?!”

Every single one of these swords possessed the power to kill an Eternal expert and destroy the laws of Eternity. How could they explode just like that?

They were like mud being slung onto the golden shield. The nether dragon race’s people were all stunned, and the race leader’s eyes lit up.

“Long Chen’s dragon blood must be connected to the primal chaos Dragon Sovereign. Otherwise, there’s no way it could have such a powerful effect on Tianzhao’s blood runes.”

The race leader’s heart was pounding hard. Others might not have been able to see the clues, but he could. When the swords were about to strike Long Chen’s shield, the divine light of the shield caused their runes to dim. Weakened before striking the shield, they were unable to cause any damage.

Even Long Chen was startled by this discovery. This shield was something he had randomly come up with based on his control over his seven-color Supreme Blood. Now, he simply applied the same principles to his dragon blood.

Somehow, the shield possessed a sacred light, and under this light, Netherdragon Tianzhao’s attack was instantly nullified.

In other words, if Long Chen enveloped himself in this sacred light, he could simply allow those swords to strike him. They wouldn’t be able to cause any damage.DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

Long Chen had managed to inadvertently activate this sacred light, and he himself didn’t know how he had done it. However, he was sure of one thing. His dragon blood had an absolute suppressive effect on the nether dragon race’s bloodline.

When Netherdragon Tianzhao saw his most proud divine ability crushed like this, shock and rage surged within him. He could no longer remain calm. After he formed some hand seals, his manifestation burst forth.

An enormous dragon claw filled with primal chaos qi stretched out of his manifestation, resembling a devil's claw from the depths of hell, bringing with it endless death qi.

“Time for you to die! Netherworld Soul Extermination Claw!”
