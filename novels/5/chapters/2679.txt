Chapter 2668 Nine Dragons Devour the Heavens Diagram

“How can that be?!”

Even in the Heavens’ Wrath state, Long Chen was startled by Evilmoon’s warning. How could the Nine-Headed Lion self-detonate?

However, his aura was truly fluctuating chaotically. It was clearly a sign of self-detonation.

Hence, Long Chen had no choice but to retreat. At such a close range, such a detonation would definitely take half his life at the minimum.

The Nine-Headed Lion was also panicking. Countless chains glowed around him as he seemingly tried to control himself. But he was no longer in control.

“You cut off one of his heads in the middle of his attack, causing his energy to become imbalanced. All the explosive power that he was gathering is now out of control. He’s about to end up conning himself to death. The power of his attack surpasses his control now,” said Evilmoon.

Evilmoon saw it clearly. The Nine-Headed Lion had actually used a forbidden technique due to having taken a beating from Long Chen. However, he had forgotten that he was facing Long Chen. Long Chen wouldn’t just sit there and let him unleash such a powerful technique. Cutting off his head might not impact him much at a normal time, but now it would cost him his life.

“Save… me…!”

The Nine-Headed Lion roared as his body swelled. He was like a balloon. His essence blood ignited, on the verge of exploding.

Seeing his current state, everyone jumped in shock. This had come far too suddenly. He had just been arrogantly cursing, but now he was on the verge of death.

All of a sudden, the gate to his world blew open. After that, a hand reached out and grabbed the Nine-Headed Lion. The master of this hand was intent on saving him.

Long Chen then slashed the hand, only for his saber-image to be blown apart. He was also impacted and almost coughed up blood.

“This is the full power of a world. That is their world’s strongest expert,” exclaimed Evilmoon.

That hand grabbed the inflating Nine-Headed Lion and dragged him into the world gate, which then slammed shut. The Nine-Headed Lion was gone.

“If I had known this would happen, I would have used the ninth form of Split the Heavens.” Long Chen clenched his teeth angrily.

“You should conserve your energy. If you had killed him, you would die to your tribulation,” warned Evilmoon. The current Long Chen was still in the midst of his tribulation. He could not be careless.

The Nine-Headed Lion had been brought away. But suddenly, Sovereign Han Wei pressed her zither strings. Divine music once more caused heaven and earth to rumble.

Long Chen followed Sovereign Han Wei’s gaze. Her attention was on Long Aotian, Ye Liangchen, and Jiang Wuchen.

“The divine families?”

Sovereign Han Wei’s mouth curled into a strange smile. It seemed to contain some disdain and thought.

With a touch of her finger, the void around the three of them exploded. As a result, Ye Liangchen and Jiang Wuchen both coughed up a mouthful of blood. The fragments of spacetime around them battered their bodies.

As for Long Aotian, he let out a cry and smashed the void with his fist. A diagram with nine dragons in it appeared behind him.

The nine dragon tails were pointed to the outside, while the heads were facing the center, with Long Aotian at the core. Dragon Qi circulated within this diagram.

Everyone was startled. This was their first time seeing Long Aotian’s manifestation. Dragon cries rang out, resonating with heaven and earth.

“It’s the eleventh rank divine manifestation, Nine Dragons Roar at the Heavens!” exclaimed Daoist Heavenly Feather in shock, unable to believe her eyes.

“No, it’s not the Nine Dragons Roar at the Heavens. You can see the black aura around their teeth,” said the High Priest gravely. The High Priest was always a calm person, and he had never had such a serious expression.

“Could it be…” Daoist Heavenly Feather’s expression changed.

“Yes, it’s the third rank divine manifestation, Nine Dragons Devour the Heavens Diagram.”

“Impossible! This world can’t produce a divine manifestation in the top eighteen ranks! That’s a set law of the Heavenly Daos! Even in the immortal era, such a thing has never occurred!” cried Daoist Heavenly Feather.

“That is true. Such a thing has never happened. Never before has there been nine dragons devouring the heavens, but we are seeing it right now,” sighed the High Priest. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

BOOM!

Just at this moment, Long Aotian unleashed a second punch, shattering the sky. This was his second time blocking Sovereign Han Wei’s attack.

Everyone was stunned, and even Long Chen’s heart was pounding hard. Long Chen felt an intensely dangerous feeling from the Nine Dragons Devouring the Heavens Diagram.

“Evilmoon, what is going on?” asked Long Chen.

“That’s the heaven devouring underworld dragon. It’s the only member of the dragon race whose devouring power surpasses my dark evil dragon race. We can devour all living things and digest flesh and blood. But the heaven devouring underworld dragon can devour and turn anything to nothing. Furthermore, those nine heaven devouring underworld dragons in his manifestation are not ordinary ones. They are young dragons with the souls of the dragons in them. As he grows, the dragons will grow with him. In other words, his manifestation will continuously grow stronger as his cultivation base advances. Long Chen, you have to be careful. This fellow is definitely a powerful opponent. He poses a lethal danger to you,” said Evilmoon heavily.

Long Chen’s heart shook. Long Aotian had truly hidden himself deeply. So he was the most terrifying of the divine families’ Sovereign sprouts. Furthermore, he had even managed to escape Long Chen’s senses.

Almost no one had ever been able to escape the senses of the Nine Star Hegemon Body Art, but Long Aotian had managed to do so.

Thinking about it, it was very likely related to his manifestation. Those nine heaven devouring underworld dragons were capable of hiding his aura.

When Long Chen glanced toward the divine families, he noticed that they were in an uproar. It seemed that even the divine families had not known about Long Aotian’s manifestation.

Long Chen looked toward the Dragonblood Legion. When his eyes locked with Xia Chen, he then rubbed his ear. Xia Chen immediately understood and secretly set up a formation.

Long Chen then heard the Ye family head darkly saying, “The Long family really hid themselves well. You even tricked us. It seems that your Long family is thinking of reclaiming the throne? Do you think the other three families will submit?”

“Shouldn’t the Long family give my Zhao family an explanation? If Long Aotian had such power, why didn’t he save Ritian back then?!” demanded the Zhao family head, her eyes red with fury. She didn’t care even if the Lord Venerate was here.
