Chapter 3225 Resolve Grudges

Long Chen and Luo Zichuan descended the mountain. The Luo family’s experts had already started lining up and greeting them. When they saw Luo Zichuan, all their eyes shone brightly with a reverence that came from deep within their souls.

The food had been prepared, and there were all kinds of piping-hot delicacies. Luo Zichuan naturally sat at the head of the table, but Long Chen was seated directly to his left. Only then did the rest of the Luo family’s experts come in and take their seats.

On Luo Zichuan’s left side was Long Chen, and on his right side was Luo Changwu. The rest were all the main pillars of the Luo family. Amongst them was the Grand Elder.

Qin Feng, Bai Xiaole, Xu Zixiong, Luo Bing, Luo Ning, Luo Xue, and the others also had a table. That was the only table for the youngsters at this feast.

However, even once all the Luo family’s experts came in, they simply stood beside the tables. Not one person dared to sit, let alone start moving their chopsticks.

Luo Zichuan smiled. “Today, we have an important guest. This is no ordinary family feast, so there’s no need to be constrained. Sit!”

Everyone sat. Bai Xiaole cast a glance at Luo Ning and the others, meaning that he felt the Luo family’s rules to be truly strict. Even eating couldn’t be done casually.

“Although my Luo family might live in just some corner of the world, our wares are very luxurious. These foods are all high quality. You definitely won’t be able to get the same food in the High Firmament Academy,” said Luo Zichuan. He actually personally served Long Chen.

Long Chen was overwhelmed with favor. As for Luo Changwu, he smiled as if relieved of a heavy weight. All his worry of the past few days was set aside.

“I haven’t seen the family head smile in many years,” said the Grand Elder with his own smile.

“Hahaha, it seems that you’re not much better than me in that regard?” laughed Luo Zichuan.

The Luo family’s experts laughed. The Grand Elder was famed for his strictness, so they could probably count the number of times that he had smiled in this lifetime with two hands.

The Grand Elder had made great contributions to the Luo family. Having followed Luo Zichuan in his slaughter back then, he was the only surviving member of his ten great generals. Within the entire Luo family, only the Grand Elder dared to speak like this to the family head.

Other than Luo Bing and the others, the rest of the members that were qualified to come here were the backbone of the Luo family. Hence, if they weren’t accompanying Qin Feng and the others, Luo Bing, Luo Xue, and the rest would not be qualified to come here.

These elders saw that the family head was very happy. The atmosphere gradually grew warmer.

“Family head, I cannot express my thanks enough. This toast is for you!” Long Chen stood and raised his cup to Luo Zichuan with both hands.

He truly felt immense reverence for Luo Zichuan. In the past few days, under Luo Zichuan’s guidance, he felt like he had been reforged.

“Good!”

Luo Zichuan raised his own cup. Even when it came to drinking wine, his movements were clean and easy.

“I’ll raise this cup of wine to everyone. You’ve worked hard for the Luo family during these years. Zichuan thanks you,” said Luo Zichuan.

The Luo family’s experts hastily stood. This toast made them all emotional. This encouragement from Luo Zichuan was the greatest recognition for them.

“I’ll raise this third cup to congratulate the Luo family on its new companion. From this day onward, Long Chen’s matters are the Luo family’s matters.” Luo Zichuan once more raised his cup. Seeing this, Qin Feng, Bai Xiaole, Xu Zixiong, and Long Chen hastily drank. This cup was for them.

After those three drinks, Luo Zichuan turned to Luo Changwu and patted him on the shoulder. “The Luo family has been depending on you and Changwen all these years. You’ve done very well. I’m very satisfied.”

Luo Changwu was overwhelmed. It was the first time his father was treating him so closely. He hastily said, “It’s all thanks to the family head’s guidance. My big brother and I have only made meager contributions. The Luo family hasn’t been all that outstanding lately. I cannot accept your praise.”

“Every person has a different style for governing a family. I specialize in offense, not defense. In a chaotic world, I will guide the family to victory. But in a peaceful world, I can’t do anything. The two of you have done very well in my eyes,” said Luo Zichuan.

“Many thanks for your praise, father.” Luo Changwu was extremely emotional. It was his first time calling him father instead of family head.

Luo Zichuan nodded. “I’m going out on a trip to resolve my grudges from all those years ago. I’ll leave the family to the two of you.”

Luo Changwu was shocked out of his happiness. “You’re going out? But now…”

All the Luo family’s experts jumped in shock. The devil sea had been exceptionally lively during this time. They might launch an incredibly strong attack at any moment.

Moreover, the Chu family was also making some moves. Now the Luo family was surrounded by enemies. As the mental pillar of the Luo family, if Luo Zichuan left at this critical time, no one would have confidence.

“I was preparing to wait for this matter to settle before leaving, but I find that there’s no need. I need to resolve that matter soon. The longer it drags on, the worse it will get. The Luo family will be left to you for now,” said Luo Zichuan, looking at Luo Changwu and Long Chen. He smiled and then vanished from sight.

Once Luo Zichuan left, Long Chen saw that the expressions of all the Luo family’s experts grew solemn.

“Did the family head say anything to you about this?” Luo Changwu turned to Long Chen.

Long Chen shook his head. “The family head didn’t say anything about this.”

Luo Zichuan was truly an incomprehensible existence, leaving just like this with no warning or explanation. He was very mysterious with his matters. Long Chen had countless questions, but he was completely unable to see through this grandfather of his.

The banquet instantly grew tense. Other than Xu Zixiong and Bai Xiaole, no one was in the mood to eat and drink.

After the banquet, Long Chen told Luo Xue to take Qin Feng, Bai Xiaole, and Xu Zixiong to the Honing Heavenly Staircase. He also told Qin Feng that he had to bring the two of them to the ninetieth star. That was his mission.

After entrusting that to Qin Feng, Long Chen wanted to see Luo Changwu, only to find that the devil sea had once more attacked, causing Luo Changwu to return to lead things.

After that, Long Chen took a transportation formation back to the devil sea and found that there was a flood of sea demons charging onto the shore. But this attack wasn’t as powerful as when he was here last time. The defenses were holding on easily.

Long Chen came to the commander tower. Standing shoulder to shoulder with Luo Changwu, the two of them stared at the endless devil sea.

Luo Changwu sighed, “I don’t know if my father will be able to return this time.”

“What?” Long Chen was startled.

“Father only brought Violet Fern. He left its sheath to continue maintaining the Luo family’s karmic luck. Thus, this time…” Luo Changwu’s voice quivered slightly. Long Chen felt a chill. He knew that something was out of the ordinary.Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com
