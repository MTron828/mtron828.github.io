Chapter 3649

Of the experts present, there were at least nine half-step Divine Venerates. As for World Kings, there were too many to count.

Moreover, those who could come here were all major figures of the various powerful sects. So, when they heard Guo Ran’s warning, they were startled and then laughed.

“You’re clearly tortoises caught in a jar, yet you dare to say such big words. Youngsters really are interesting these days,” said one elder mockingly.

“You…!” Guo Ran was enraged and was about to kill him when Long Chen held him back.

“Leave it. Kindness cannot advise ghosts about to die. Let them do what they want. If a person wants to die, no one can stop them.” Long Chen shook his head. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Guo Ran had given them their warning. That was their chance. Whether or not they would grasp it was up to themselves.

However, while these people had mocking expressions, they didn’t have any intention of fighting. After all, this was a matter for the Spirit Rune Pavilion. They were only in charge of watching the show.

When Long Chen’s group of three appeared, the Spirit Rune Pavilion’s grand formation was activated. Divine light continued to circulate, causing the pressure to grow increasingly powerful. But Long Chen’s group didn’t even seem to see the formation.

Guo Ran’s killing intent fully erupted. He was just waiting for Xia Chen’s order to slaughter people.

When Xia Chen looked at the sneering Gongsun Ziyi, his body quivered slightly. The rage in his eyes ignited. “Gongsun Ziyi, I, Xia Chen, was truly blind. I was actually tricked by you. I was fully devoted to you, and I trusted you. But both you and your grandfather wanted to steal my soul seed and my body. Today, I will settle all our debts.”

Even Xia Chen’s voice was quivering. He himself hadn’t experienced that much. Ever since he had started following Long Chen, he had always been with his hot-blooded brothers in the Dragonblood Legion. He trusted every single one of them with his life, and they did the same with him.

He had always thought that as long as he treated others sincerely, they would treat him the same. But he was wrong this time. His sincerity only brought him pain and anger.

Xia Chen wasn’t afraid of bleeding or danger. But this kind of betrayal and deceit was unacceptable, especially with how they had used his feelings.

Gongsun Ziyi smiled indifferently. “Xia Chen, even at this moment, you’re still acting like a victim? Do you think there’s a point? Who would believe the words of a traitor who betrayed their sect and master? Don’t waste the effort. Having committed such sins, even I cannot save you. If you have any sense of responsibility, just kill yourself. My time is very precious. As you can see, I have something very important to do today!”

Gongsun Ziyi then held Ji Wuying’s arm tighter, looking at Xia Chen provokingly.

Gongsun Xuan sighed. “Xia Chen, you’ve really disappointed me. I was originally planning on-”

“Shut your mouth, you old shameless thing! You took the ancient talisman that I deciphered and the new talisman that I came up with to apply for your Heavenly Talisman Master status! You thieving liar, you aren’t qualified to speak with me!” shouted Xia Chen.

Everyone was startled by those words, and they looked at Gongsun Xuan in disbelief.

However, Gongsun Xuan’s expression was still completely calm. He shook his head. “Xia Chen, why bother? Before dying, do you simply have to damage my reputation first? I really don’t understand why you would do this. I treated you like family, and my position was going to be yours. Just who made you do this? Tell me. If you have your own circumstances, then even if I have to bend the rules or give up my position as pavilion master, I will try to save your life.”

Gongsun Xuan’s lamenting appearance was perfect. Because of it, quite a few people were starting to feel angry on his behalf.

“Xia Chen, you’re worse than an animal! The pavilion master treats you so well, and you still betray the Spirit Rune Pavilion?! How can someone like you have the face to live in this world!?”

“Forgetting kindness, repaying favor with enmity, even a dog knows not to bite their master. But you?”

“Xia Chen, I’ve never seen someone as shameless as you. Come out and have a fair fight with me. I’ll take your dog life.”

After Gongsun Xuan’s speech, countless experts of the junior generation stepped forward and cursed at Xia Chen, saying all kinds of ugly words.

Many of those had been Xia Chen’s worshippers. Before this, they all treated him reverently, practically kneeling and worshiping the ground he walked on.

However, today, they were like a group of rabid dogs. They were dragging a former king out of his throne. All kinds of ugly displays were thrown Xia Chen’s way.

Seeing this, Xia Chen quivered with rage and Guo Ran clenched his fists tightly. Only Long Chen looked on calmly.

Growth came at a price. Whether it was Guo Ran in the Heavenly Dragon Divine Armor College or Xia Chen in the Spirit Rune Pavilion, Long Chen saw some of their shortcomings.

On the Martial Heaven Continent, under his wing, their Dragonblood Legion was unrivaled. But in terms of actual living experience, they were still too immature.

Because of that, Guo Ran was suppressed to the point of not daring to retaliate, while Xia Chen was unable to differentiate between good people and bad people. Thinking carefully, it seemed that as their boss, he hadn’t done well enough for them.

After suffering came knowledge. Sometimes you had to experience something in order to grow. Pain was your best teacher. After losing the things that you held precious, your youthfulness would be forcibly wiped away. That was the path that you had to traverse to grow.

Seeing Xia Chen quivering, Long Chen decided to let him see this world’s cruel and ugly side. Perhaps then he would understand how to differentiate between what was beautiful and what was ugly. He needed a pair of wise eyes to see through the falseness of others.

“AHH!” Xia Chen suddenly let out a roar like an injured beast. That roar contained endless pain and fury.

“All you know is to howl. Is there a point to it? If you’re in so much pain, then just kill yourself!” sneered someone in the crowd.

Suddenly, a bolt of lightning shot through the air without any thunder. It pierced that person’s head, causing his smile to stiffen. After that, he collapsed.

“Since you want to die so badly, I’ll help you out.” Long Chen’s expression was cold as he slowly lowered his finger.

He truly loathed these brainless idiots. They didn’t have much power, but they knew how to curse others. It was irritating.

Long Chen had killed someone with a wave of his hand without any warning at all. Seeing this, the other experts were all shocked. They were talisman cultivators. They had to activate their soul energy before entering their combat state.

An elder behind the person who was slain roared furiously. At this moment, runes flowed around him as he entered a combat state. He was that person’s elder. “Little brute, you dare-!”

“Die!”

Xia Chen suddenly shouted and that elder’s body directly exploded, transforming into a rain of blood.

“This… this is… Heavenly Soul Lock Talisman?!”

This sight shocked and horrified all the experts present. Even the half-step Divine Venerates’ expressions changed.
