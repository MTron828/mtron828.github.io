Chapter 3769: Boiling Blood Sea

“This place is the demonic beast race’s sacred land! It’s not somewhere your inferior human race can step into!”

Countless demonic beasts charged over at Long Chen and Jiang Lei. They were blazing with killing intent.

“The demonic beast race’s sacred land? What a joke! A billion of your ancestors were killed here. This is a graveyard! You dare to call it a sacred land?” Long Chen laughed mockingly.

“Nonsense!”

A demonic beast Supreme expert roared furiously. His wings flapped, and he suddenly appeared in front of Long Chen, smashing his rod at Long Chen’s head. He hated Long Chen, so he immediately launched a full-power attack.Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

In return, the Minghong Saber came out of its sheath. Long Chen blocked, and his saber actually unleashed a soft energy upon clashing with the rod. After quivering three times, the majority of the energy in the rod dissipated. After that, with a shove of the saber, that person was knocked toward Jiang Lei.

Jiang Lei was prepared, and his lightning sword instantly cut off his head.

“Don’t fight them directly. Save your energy in case we encounter any peak experts,” reminded Long Chen. Lightning wings then spread on his back, and he charged toward the weakest part of their blockade.

Long Chen and Jiang Lei didn’t let themselves be bogged down by the small fries. They only killed the Supreme geniuses. On the other hand, the demonic beasts tried to surround them, but their speed was inferior. Ultimately, they were unable to catch Long Chen and Jiang Lei.

They cursed and howled as they chased. That drew the attention of even more demonic beasts. Hence, more and more of them began chasing Long Chen.

Originally, it was tens of thousands of people, but that quickly became hundreds of thousands. After an incense stick’s worth of time, it was millions.

These millions of experts were in a life-and-death pursuit on top of the Heavenly River Blood Sea. Just as they saw that they were about to surround Long Chen, Long Chen suddenly swung his saber, tearing open their enclosure and easily escaping once more. The demonic beasts cursed furiously.

The Heavenly River Blood Sea was enormous, but Long Chen was only moving within a small region of it. It was because he didn’t want to draw the attention of more peak experts. Otherwise, just like rolling a snowball, this army would grow bigger and bigger until they would eventually exhaust him.

However, despite moving in a small region, the army chasing him continued to grow. More Supreme experts arrived, and some of them were shockingly talented. Their divine abilities applied immense pressure on Long Chen and Jiang Lei, so their options grew more and more limited. Just like that, avoiding the encirclement got increasingly difficult.

Just as Long Chen was fighting the demonic beasts, he also heard intense rumbling in the distance. Clearly, the demonic beasts were also fighting others. It was unknown what race those people were from.

“Big brother Long Chen, let’s work together again. We’ll unleash the World Extermination Flame Lotus!” Huo Linger transformed into a tiny flame dragon sitting on Long Chen’s shoulder. She spoke into his ear.

“No. You still haven’t recovered, and we might lose control over it again. Even if we don’t and manage to kill them all, it means nothing. The World Extermination Flame Lotus uses up a huge amount of my Spiritual Strength and mental energy. With my tribulation coming soon, I have to be fully focused on it. There can be no mistakes,” said Long Chen.

“Big brother Long Chen, let me release the World Extermination Lightning Radiance then!” Lei Linger also transformed into a tiny lightning dragon on Long Chen’s other shoulder.

Long Chen didn’t know whether to laugh or cry. These two really were growing more war-like.

“You can’t attack either. The heavenly tribulation will start soon. Although you can replenish your energy through it, things are too chaotic here. There are too many experts, and no one knows what will happen. Furthermore, the terrain here is special, which makes the laws of the Heavenly Daos erratic. Just rest for now. Don’t worry, you’ll have a chance to show off soon,” said Long Chen.

Hearing that, Lei Linger and Huo Linger stopped bothering him. But they refused to retreat. They just stayed on his shoulders and fought alongside him.

Long Chen and Jiang Lei were constantly chased and surrounded by the demonic beasts. They charged through any holes they could find, conveniently killing a few on the way.

On the outside, the Divine Venerates grew anxious. They began to shout, directing the army.

However, although these demonic beasts were conscious of being in a group and often fought in group battles, their fighting style was only to fight for themselves. Even in groups, they didn’t cooperate beyond the absolute basics.

They couldn’t fight in an orderly formation like the human race. Thus, while this army of millions looked very frightening, they were a plate of loose sand. As long as Long Chen didn’t find them directly, they were unable to deal a fatal blow to him.

“The left… Up ahead… In front of you… I said in front of you! You idiots, are you all idiots?! He’s running in that direction again, stop him!” shouted a Divine Venerate, cursing as he directed the troops.

This Divine Venerate was clearly the idiot. Long Chen was so fast and agile, moving in every direction. These people had long since grown dizzy chasing him.

Left? That was from his own viewpoint. The experts chasing him were facing every single direction. Left? It would be better if he didn’t say anything. Now that he was trying to give directions, these people were like headless flies, crashing into each other chaotically.

“Shut your fucking mouth!” shouted a Supreme expert finally.

These people came from the nine heavens and ten lands. Although they were both demonic beasts, they didn’t know each other. Moreover, these heavenly geniuses were all arrogant. It was clearly a problem with the person trying to direct them, yet he cursed them as idiots? These heavenly geniuses had long since grown enraged by him.

“You…!”

The Divine Venerate’s face was dark with fury. If it weren’t for the fact that he didn’t dare to cross the barrier, he’d definitely beat up that fellow.

“Non-Supreme experts should retreat! We don’t need you here! Scram!” shouted a demonic beast covered in golden scales.

Following that roar, the ordinary demonic beasts fell back. Their speed was inferior, and their power wasn’t great enough. They were only causing disorder here. It would be better for them to retreat.

Now that only a few hundred powerful Supreme experts were chasing them, Long Chen and Jiang Lei instantly felt the pressure increase.

“Boss, it’s no good. We can only start fighting them directly!” Jiang Lei cursed as he panted.

Without those people as a hindrance, these Supreme experts were finally able to display their power. In an instant, there was nowhere for Long Chen to run.

Long Chen was about to speak when the Heavenly River Blood Sea began to boil. At the same time, the heavens roared and Grand Dao runes rained down.

“The Heavenly River Blood Sea is boiling! The time to undergo tribulation has come! Damn human race, let’s see how your weak bodies are turned to dust in front of heavenly tribulation!”

The demonic beasts cried out excitedly as their auras erupted, their shackles shattering. Tribulation clouds gathered in the sky.

At that moment, Long Chen finally sighed with relief. Looking at the delighted expressions of the demonic beasts around him, he smiled.
