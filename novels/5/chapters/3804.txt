Chapter 3793 Eight Gates Eight Trigrams

There was still some distance to Clear Sky City, but those foreign experts didn’t dare to get closer.

They roared and cursed at Mo Nian furiously but didn’t dare to take a single step closer. After a while, they could only helplessly scatter.

Mo Nian sighed with relief before returning to his calm nonchalance.

“It seems that you’ve worked hard in the three thousand worlds. You must have been toiling away day and night,” said Long Chen somewhat speechlessly. Just how long had it been since they had entered the three thousand worlds? But Mo Nian was already being chased down by so many forces. He definitely hadn’t slacked off.

“You overpraise me, hehe!” Mo Nian chortled. He was very pleased with himself.

At this moment, Long Chen and the others arrived in front of the city gates. Two Divine Venerates registered them and asked them many questions. Those questions seemed to be a trial. They had to answer directly, and there was no brushing off the questions.

After those questions, they were granted status plates. Mo Nian already had one.

According to Clear Sky City, every person needed to pay a hundred thousand immortal king crystal as tax. It was definitely a heavy tax, especially for people like Long Chen who were only passing by temporarily. It could even be considered a robbery.

This was one of the rules of Clear Sky City. It was a heavy tax, but Clear Sky City was absolutely safe. Compared to absolute safety, this bit of money didn’t count as much.

Furthermore, not all members of the human race were necessarily qualified to enter the city. If their answers in front of the city did not pass the city’s standard, they would be rejected. No matter how much money they offered, they wouldn’t be allowed in.

In truth, these questions were a test to measure a person’s character. Most importantly, it tested whether a person had betrayed or would betray the human race.

Long Chen and the others easily entered. After obtaining their status plates, Mo Nian magnanimously paid ten times the tax.

To use Mo Nian’s words, he was nothing more than a passing guest. He couldn’t do much else for the human race here, so giving up some worldly possessions was not worth mentioning.

This generosity moved the two Divine Venerates letting them in. They hastily thanked Mo Nian. Although this sum of money wasn’t much, they greatly admired his generosity. After seeing how Mo Nian had killed so many experts, they felt good that someone so terrifying was not putting on airs at all and still kept the human race in his heart.

Those two elders even called people over to guide Long Chen and the others. They also transmitted some taboos of Clear Sky City to them.

These taboos were actually carved onto the back of each status plate, and the visitors of the city had to study them themselves. Explaining it to them directly was their way of repaying Mo Nian’s generosity.

Once they were in the city, Long Chen noticed that it was even bigger than he had imagined. Other than the Violet Flame Heaven Capital, he had never seen such a giant city.

However, while the Violet Flame Heaven Capital was large, it was in ruins. Here, the endless sprawl of buildings was completely intact. This sight gave off a shocking feeling.

“Let’s go. I’ll hold a welcoming feast for you!”

Mo Nian walked into the city like it was his home. He was effortlessly familiar with the roads. They then took some transportation formations in the city and arrived at the most luxurious district of the city.

Clear Sky City was divided into many districts. Some areas were specifically for cultivation or trading. While some were for martial stages or simply entertainment. To sum it up, there were places to do whatever you wanted.

Everyone here followed the rules strictly, not daring to cause any fuss. It had to be known that this was the only pure land of the human race in the three thousand worlds.

If they were expelled from here, they would forever lose their right to enter Clear Sky City. Thus, everyone here was prudent enough not to break the rules.

While the outside of this city was a storm of blood, the inside of the city was flourishing. They were like two completely different worlds.

“This really is a good place. When will we also be able to create such a world where we can be carefree and happy?” Jiang Lei couldn’t help sighing. This place was flourishing. In their eyes, it was already a holy land that transcended the rest of the world.

“This place was built through the sacrifice of countless human experts. All this luxury and freedom we see were gained using their lives. After all, this world is full of darkness. It is nameless heroes who used their lives and blood to block the darkness for the people inside the city. Big brother Yun Shang, big brother Qing Xu, big brother Mo Li, big sister Han Xue, big brother Zi Yang, the old man, alliance head Qu, senior Ling Yunzi, Hu Feng, and many of our Dragonblood warriors… so many heroes sacrificed themselves just to leave behind a peaceful world in the final battle of the Martial Heaven Continent.” Long Chen couldn’t help sighing when he saw the smiles on the faces of the people inside the city.

When Long Chen brought this up, Mo Nian, Jiang Lei, and the others’ eyes reddened. So many people had died in that battle. They almost didn’t dare to think about it.

“We do it so that the people we love can live carefree lives like them. I’m sure that the people who died can smile in the nine springs,” sighed Mo Nian. He patted Long Chen’s shoulder. “That’s enough. Don’t talk about it. It was so difficult to reunite, so let’s be happy.” Mo Nian knew just how big of an impact that battle had on Long Chen. He didn’t want him to sink into grief. “This big brother has already prepared a gift for you! Let’s hurry up!”

Long Chen looked at this flourishing world and couldn’t help but think of his old friends on the Martial Heaven Continent. Filled with sorrow, he took a deep breath and suppressed those feelings.

“A gift? What? Did you dig it out of the ground?” asked Long Chen.

“Are you looking down on me? You clearly aren’t being respectful of my profession!” said Mo Nian. “No matter how you put it, I am the future palace master of the Limitless Palace! As brothers, you have to be more respectful of my profession.”

“That’s right, you mentioned the Limitless Palace. Are you talking about the legendary five palaces and eight gates?” asked Long Chen suddenly.Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

“What five palaces and eight gates?” Mo Nian was startled.

“In the myths, it is said that outside the world of the nine heavens, there is a transcendent divine world with five palaces. The central High Firmament Palace, the southern Jade Void Palace, the northern Limitless Palace… The Jade Void Palace is also the main gate to the Heavenly Palace, the life gate. The corresponding Limitless Palace on the other side is the death gate. Life and death face each other. The eight gates are Body, Life, Pain, Limit, Vision, Death, Terror, and Opening. They are also called the eight trigrams, corresponding to the Qian, Kan, Gen, Zhen, Xun, Li, Kun, Dui, in correlation with… Are you telling me you didn’t know any of this?!” Long Chen was also dumbfounded when he saw Mo Nian’s lost expression.

“I really didn’t.” Mo Nian stared at him oddly.

“Didn’t you say that you’re the future palace master of the Limitless Palace? Do you not know the origin of your sect?” asked Long Chen speechlessly.

“Our Limitless Palace only has two members. That treacherous old fellow, he didn’t tell me anything. After leaving me a few things, he just had me live my own life, sink or swim.” As soon as Mo Nian mentioned this person, he gnashed his teeth. “Brother, is the Limitless Palace you’re talking about very badass?” Mo Nian didn’t have Long Chen’s learning and didn’t know about the matter of the five palaces and eight gates. But Long Chen’s solemn expression moved him.

“If the Limitless Palace that you are talking about really is the Limitless Palace that I’m talking about, I’ll definitely follow you in the future,” said Long Chen sincerely. If Long Chen really had made a connection with an existence from the era of legends, then he really would be badass.

“Hahaha!” Mo Nian laughed and wrapped his arm around Long Chen’s shoulders. “My luck really is good! You’re always surrounded by bad luck. My Limitless Palace probably really is that legendary existence!”

At this time, they arrived at a palace-like building. There were two beautiful maidens standing at the entrance. Seeing Mo Nian arrive, they bowed deeply and guided them inside.

Once they walked in, Jiang Lei and the other Dragonblood warriors all cried out in delight.
