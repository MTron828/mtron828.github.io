Chapter 5023 Act Wantonly!

Seeing that the four clan leaders and the other top experts were present, Long Chen reached out to the Earth Cauldron.

“Senior...”

“I’m here. I’ve succeeded. With me present, feel free to act as wantonly as you wish!” responded the Earth Cauldron confidently.

Long Chen instantly felt assured. It was his first time hearing the Earth Cauldron speak with such confidence. Clearly, it had gained more than him this time. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Thinking of how he had the Earth Cauldron looking after him, Long Chen shed all misgivings. He felt lighter than ever as he sat down in his head umpire seat. This time, silence fell over the crowd. There were no cheers or loud shouts.

With the four clan leaders and the other top experts here, the atmosphere became much more serious. Everyone acted respectful and reserved, even making sure not to breathe too loudly.

When Long Chen arrived, he saw that the competition grounds had changed. There was only a single martial stage now, and it seemed more like a sacrificial altar. Despite the many decorations added to it, its strange appearance raised Long Chen’s suspicions.

However, he didn’t overthink it. For a clash of the strongest heavenly geniuses of the four divine clans, it made sense to bring out their strongest martial stage. For it to look different than before was quite normal.

At this moment, there was no need for Long Chen, as the head umpire, to take charge. The four clan leaders stood and said some encouraging words.

They mentioned that to not affect everyone’s display in combat, they had only been watching from behind the scenes. However, they had witnessed every battle and every person’s display. They expressed how gratified they were, seeing images of their younger selves in the competitors, sharing that same hot-blooded passion, and so on. After this series of standard remarks, the Long clan leader looked to Long Chen.

The Long clan leader said, “As our head umpire, things have been hard on you. I represent the four divine clans in expressing our thanks to you. Fortunately, the competition is at its end. I hope you can continue until the end.”

Long Chen did fully grasp what the Long clan leader was implying, but he nodded. “But of course.”

After all, he had accepted their medicinal ingredients. It wasn’t polite to just take their wealth and run off.

“Alright, then let the first battle commence!” announced the Long clan leader.

Long Chen’s figure suddenly vanished and reappeared on the martial stage, startling him. What was going on? In the past, he had always entered on his own. But this time, he was brought in against his will.

When Long Chen was brought in, he realized that this martial stage really was made from an ancient sacrificial altar. He recognized the patterns on the bricks and the sacrificial totem poles.

Damn, even the bricks are made of the material for Heaven Saint divine weapons! This martial stage is overkill! Long Chen was shocked. At the same time, he felt a trace of greed. If he could steal this martial stage and tear it apart, he would get quite a few divine materials. The Long clan was quite rich indeed.

When Long Chen entered, almost everyone took a deep breath. The tension was palpable. The four peak heavenly geniuses of the ancient era had crushed the experts of the current era. Although Long Wuyang had managed to exchange a few blows with Zhao Qingtian, everyone knew this was because Zhao Qingtian had been too arrogant. In truth, Zhao Qingtian hadn’t shown his full power.

Long Wuyang himself admitted that if Zhao Qingtian had been serious, he wouldn’t have been able to receive a single blow. The ancient era’s experts were just too terrifying.

After Long Chen appeared, two figures slowly materialized on either side of the stage. One of them was Jiang Wuwang, the Jiang clan’s heavenly genius.

The other one was Long Tianrui, which surprised Long Chen a bit. Didn’t that mean Zhao Qingtian and Ye Lingxiao were fighting afterward?

For a battle on this level, it normally wasn’t left to chance. The higher-ups usually decided who would fight based on various factors. For Long Tianrui to be fighting Jiang Wuwang, Long Chen immediately felt that something was off, though he couldn’t pinpoint exactly what.

Jiang Wuwang cupped his fists to Long Tianrui and said, “Fairy Tianrui, you have always been my idol, the peak I have always aspired to reach. I’ve always hoped to be able to compete with an expert like you. And now, the heavens have blessed me with this chance. I hope you won’t mind if I embarrass myself with my little skills.”

It went without saying that Jiang Wuwang was suave and refined. Each of his moves showed the mannerisms of an expert. The women especially were moved by this.

Long Tianrui indifferently said, “As you wish...”

Long Tianrui was still as apathetic as ever. It was as if other than Long Chen, no one else could pique her interest.

Furthermore, even though she was interested in Long Chen, her expression remained the same as ever when they encountered each other.

Jiang Wuwang felt helpless in front of her apathetic reply. He had prepared this opener for a long time, hoping to win her favor, but it had no effect.

Turning to Long Chen, Jiang Wuwang joked, “Brother Long, I’m going all-out. If I cannot win, remember to save me when the time comes!”

Long Chen hadn’t expected Jiang Wuwang to have such a humorous side. The spectators laughed, understanding it was a joke, and felt even greater admiration for him.

Compared to Jiang Wuwang, Zhao Qingtian and Ye Lingxiao were like rubes lacking any grace or refinement of experts.

Shaking his head, Long Chen replied, “No, you should take it easy. She’s very powerful. If I make a mistake, she might even kill me. I still have wives at home and don’t want to die young. You should pray for a blessing!”

Long Chen’s response drew more laughter from the spectators. With one request and one answer, the tense atmosphere lifted significantly.

Long Tianrui did not get angry at his teasing. She solemnly said, “If you agree to consider what I said, I’ll listen to you.”

“This again.” Long Chen was speechless. Yes, he was definitely very handsome, and she was very beautiful. But wouldn’t it be terrifying to spend a lifetime with someone who only had one expression? He couldn’t bear it.

Long Chen didn’t want to get entangled with her. As his golden scepter could no longer control this martial stage, he could only remind them. “Uh... can we start?”

“Please give me pointers!” shouted Jiang Wuwang.

Jiang Wuwang retreated half a step, his powerful aura rising. Everyone fell silent as they eagerly awaited the clash between the peak heavenly geniuses of the ancient era.
