Chapter 4364 True Power

When Long Chen’s Kunpeng wing quivered, his speed reached its peak, creating the illusion of teleportation. Even as the Dragon Elephant expert was flying back, Long Chen reached him instantaneously and delivered another kick.

Without any technique to speak of, the kick simply struck the Dragon Elephant in the face. However, before it landed, starlight enveloped Long Chen’s foot.

The Dragon Elephant was enraged as he knew that Long Chen wanted to humiliate him, to bring him down beneath his feet.

BOOM!

With no time for anything more, the Dragon Elephant crossed his arms in front of him, and Long Chen’s foot landed squarely on his arms. Astral power erupted, causing the Dragon Elephant to quiver as he struggled to withstand the impact.

Long Chen’s foot forcefully struck the Dragon Elephant’s arms, driving them into his head. The immense power not only crushed the void but also generated large energy ripples. Coughing up blood, the Dragon Elephant hastily retreated as space collapsed around him. A line of experts was then drawn into the spatial vortex he left behind and crushed to bits.

Blood flew through the air, with the majority being sucked into the spatial crack. Long Chen’s Kunpeng wings once more quivered as he shot after the Dragon Elephant relentlessly, akin to a nightmare sticking to him. Space was unable to restrict Long Chen.

“Dragon Elephant Raises the Heavens!”

The Dragon Elephant’s manifestation suddenly raised its four thick elephant legs, and they looked like heavenly pillars holding up the sky. When he came to a sudden stop, he slammed his hands together and actually formed a strange seal. After that, a pair of golden tusks from his manifestation tore through the sky at Long Chen.

Seeing this scene, Long Chen simply snorted and unleashed a punch that was enveloped by his seven stars.

BOOM!

A metallic ringing echoed as starlight and golden light clashed. The earth then sank beneath the impact, and an ear-piercing sound resonated throughout the entire world.Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

The Dragon Elephant race took several steps back, and with each step, the ground beneath him collapsed. After nine steps, he was a thousand miles away and finally stabilized himself, but blood suddenly sprayed out of his mouth. Although he had managed to forcibly endure Long Chen's punch, he was not unscathed.

When the onlookers looked at Long Chen, they saw that he was still in his punching posture. His clothes and hair billowed in the wind, with the starlight still coursing over his fist. He was like a battle god in control of the starry sky—simply unstoppable!

“The Dragon Elephant race is only at this level. Is this what you’re planning to use to provoke the human race?” Long Chen regarded him with disdain, slowly retracting his fist.

Now, Long Chen stood high above the millions of experts of other races. Just by standing there, he instilled such intimidation that most of them didn’t dare to move, all too shaken by his display.

That Dragon Elephant served as the leader of the Six Great Lords, who claimed to be the pinnacle of all World Kings in this world. Also, this Dragon Elephant was only slightly stronger than the rest of the Six Great Lords.

In the Great Desolate world, everyone was aware of just how strong he was, and that was why they were so shocked that he couldn’t beat Long Chen and was at an immense disadvantage from the start. Their difference in power was too big.

“Damn human race, you’ll never know what true power is!”

The Dragon Elephant felt a mix of shock and rage, not understanding how a human could press him to this extent.

Both his arms now radiated with a golden glow. A golden dragon manifested on one arm, and a golden elephant materialized on the other. His manifestation then quivered as primal chaos qi surged into him.

His aura expanded, fracturing the void. When the influx of primal chaos qi enveloped him, his aura underwent a significant surge.

“Die, you inferior human!” The Dragon Elephant roared and unleashed two punches at Long Chen.

Having completely entered a berserk state, the Dragon Elephant possessed the power to affect the laws of the Grand Dao. His fists could shatter the dome of the heavens.

BOOM!

Long Chen blocked him with a single fist, and the impact unleashed an immense ripple that shattered the void. Long Chen had blocked his fists just like that. Threads of powerful qi shot out in every direction like sharp swords, piercing the void.

“This is your so-called true power?” asked Long Chen.

In response, the Dragon Elephant roared furiously, and the totems on his arms grew brighter and brighter as his aura continued to climb. People were shocked to see that his power could still grow.

However, even more shocking was that Long Chen continued to press him with a single hand. With the seven stars on top of his hand and the starry sea in his divine ring, no matter how the Dragon Elephant pushed, he was unable to shake Long Chen.

Long Chen looked like the lord of the starry river, and no power could shake him.

“Damn human race! What are you so arrogant about?!”

The Dragon Elephant’s veins throbbed as he was driven to madness. His aura surged relentlessly, surpassing even the prowess of Eternal experts.

The Great Desolate World’s experts were forced further and further back by the terrifying qi waves. As for the Nirvana Overflow Heaven’s experts, they stood at the gate, quietly watching.

Long Chen and the Dragon Elephant’s battle might look like a simple clash between two experts, but it was actually a battle between the representatives of two worlds.

Victory or defeat would set the morale of the two worlds. Thus, no one had any intention of interfering. Whoever first interfered would be admitting that they had lost, and it would be a serious blow to their morale.

As both were the strongest heavenly geniuses of their worlds, the implications of this battle were immense. Both sides’ experts were nervous.

However, the Great Desolate World’s experts were a bit more nervous because Long Chen was just too powerful. The Dragon Elephant was suppressed this entire time and could never get the upper hand.

On the other hand, seeing that Long Chen could suppress a peak heavenly genius of the Great Desolate World, the human race’s side was delighted, but they didn’t dare to be careless. After all, they were now in the Great Desolate World, and their old monsters might come out at any moment.

BOOM!

Suddenly, the Dragon Elephant’s aura reached its peak, triggering a profound change in his manifestation. What once seemed illusory now revealed a true Dragon Elephant. With a powerful eruption of energy, Long Chen and the Dragon Elephant were blown back at the same time.

Seeing that giant Dragon Elephant, the Great Desolate World’s experts let out heaven-shaking cheers.

“The primal chaos Dragon Elephant’s Eternal heroic spirit has been summoned! Long Chen, you’re definitely dead!”

This Dragon Elephant was so large that the majority of its body was hidden above the clouds. The stars seemed to be right on its back, and its terrifying oppressive might made people’s souls quiver.

“Do you see this? You inferior human race, what can you use to fight me?!” The Dragon Elephant expert stood atop that giant Dragon Elephant of his manifestation, his voice echoing throughout the cosmos. To everyone’s surprise, his voice actually came from the enormous Dragon Elephant.

This colossal Dragon Elephant resembled a divine beast that had transcended time, as if it had emerged from the primal chaos era. Its aura struck terror into the hearts of those who saw it.

“This is it?” Long Chen shook his head.

“Even with death at hand, you still dare to act tough! Die!” The Dragon Elephant expert roared, delivering another thunderous punch. Simultaneously, the colossal Dragon Elephant behind him swung into action, its massive golden tusks slashing toward Long Chen like formidable blades.

“It seems you know nothing about true power,” muttered Long Chen.

The seven stars within Long Chen's eyes glimmered and flowed. His starry river erupted in a brilliant blaze of light, unleashing a power that shook heaven and earth.
