Chapter 4128: Beating Them at Their Own Game

The Dragonblood warrior attacked casually. Seeing this, the large man also reacted very quickly, swinging a jagged blade over his head. Just this one move showed that he was an expert with plenty of combat experience.

This startled everyone watching. Although this fellow’s words were those of an idiot, he unexpectedly had some skill. Ignoring everything else, just his reaction speed alone showed that he was no weakling.

However, although he reacted immediately, a streak of sword-light still cut him in two along with his weapon.

“What?!”

All the spectators were stunned by this. That person’s jagged saber was definitely a powerful weapon, but it was cut through as easily as tofu.

The Dragonblood warrior sheathed his sword and simply returned to his seat, his demeanor radiating an unparalleled calmness, as if nothing had happened.

With his keen eyes, Long Chen saw some hidden details. The divine light of the Dragonblood warrior’s sword was red like blood, containing dragon blood energy. Most likely, Guo Ran had made a new breakthrough and added this new power to all the Dragonblood warriors’ swords. Otherwise, there would have been no way to cut through that large man’s divine weapon so easily.

Long Chen’s gaze swept over the crowd, and he patted his chest. “I am Long Chen, also known as Boss Long San. Recently, I obtained a precious bronze cauldron, and people say that it is one of the ten great primal chaos divine items, the Heaven Earth Cauldron. I also can’t say anything for sure. If anyone wants it, I am prepared to sell it. If the price is right, you can take it. Of course, if someone were to try to take it by force, that’s no problem either. I have the cauldron, and you have your life. Let’s see which one is tougher.”

Long Chen had long since known that the information would leak and spread quickly, so he might as well get to it first.

“You… you really have the Heaven Earth Cauldron?” asked someone suspiciously.

“Have you seen the Heaven Earth Cauldron before?” asked Long Chen.

“No.”

“That’s exactly the problem. You haven’t seen it before, and neither have I, so who knows whether it really is the Heaven Earth Cauldron or not? However, this bronze cauldron is something that I obtained from the three thousand worlds, and I don’t know its origins. In the Violet Flame Heaven, some people said that it was very likely the legendary Heaven Earth Cauldron. Since they said it, I didn’t stand on courtesy. If someone wants to buy it, they’ll need to pay handsomely. If any of you are interested, come find me whenever you want. As long as you have enough treasures that can match the value of the Heaven Earth Cauldron, I won’t reject you. In any case, there’s no loss to me. But before we do our trade, you’ll have to show me exactly what treasures you are offering. If I feel like it’s a fair price, we can discuss further details.”

“Tch, do you think we are fools? If you really had the Heaven Earth Cauldron, you’d be in hiding. Who would dare to swagger around the marketplace?” sneered someone.

Hearing this, the people around nodded. Just what kind of existence was the Heaven Earth Cauldron? It was one of the ten great primal chaos divine items, one of the strongest divine weapons of the nine heavens and ten lands! Anyone who obtained it would rather lose their lives than give it to others.

However, Long Chen brazenly said that he had the Heaven Earth Cauldron right in front of all of them? If that was true, Long Chen would have to be even more of an idiot than the idiot who had just died.

But with such an intelligent glint in his eyes, how could he be an idiot? If he wasn’t dumb, then he must be trying to scam them, treating them as the idiots.

“What are you tch-ing about? Have you not heard the news from the Soaring Dragon Company? They’re the ones who say that my bronze cauldron is the primal chaos divine item, the Earth Cauldron of the Heaven Earth Cauldron! It has caused huge waves in the Violet Flame Heaven! You frogs at the bottom of a well, you don’t stay informed. If you don’t know anything, then shut your mouth. In any case, the Heaven Earth Cauldron is in my hands! If anyone wants to buy it, come find me!” said Long Chen.

“Give it up. Everyone knows that you are mortal enemies with the Soaring Dragon Company. They’re just spreading that information to get people to try to kill you. As for you, you are no good fellow either. You’re clearly trying to scam people. Do you really view us as fools?”

Hearing this, quite a few people asked their comrades about the veracity of this information. Did Long Chen really have an enmity with the Soaring Dragon Company? They had indeed heard rumors that the Soaring Dragon Company wanted to capture someone.

With just a quick check, they learned that the Soaring Dragon Company indeed wanted to capture this fellow right in front of them. It seemed that he was also no good egg since he dared to plunder the Soaring Dragon Company.

After learning about this piece of information, everyone knew that the other fellow was right. The Soaring Dragon Company had intentionally spread such a story to get Long Chen killed.

If Long Chen really had the Heaven Earth Cauldron, the Soaring Dragon Company would have long since attacked themselves to take it. Why would they deliberately spread the word?

That was one of the ten great primal chaos divine items. Who wouldn’t want it? Would a rotten business like the Soaring Dragon Company be so kindhearted as to share it with others?

Seeing them not believe him, Long Chen angrily said, “What ignorant brats. If you reject my kindness, I can’t be bothered to speak to you.”

“We’d have to believe you first, so take out the Heaven Earth Cauldron for us to see,” proposed someone.

“Tch, do you think that I’m an idiot? How can I let others see the Heaven Earth Cauldron for free?” snorted Long Chen disdainfully. “If you want a look, then it’s a hundred thousand world king crystals per person. If a hundred thousand people are willing to pay, I’ll even let you touch it. So, are you interested? We currently do have enough numbers. If you’re willing to pay, I’ll show it to everyone,” called out Long Chen enticingly.

“A hundred thousand world king crystals? And you want us to gather a hundred thousand people? Are you crazy?”

“Have you never seen a world king crystal before?”

“Why don’t you learn from that idiot and go steal from others too?”

As soon as Long Chen made his offer, countless people mocked him.

However, Long Chen’s face didn’t redden in the slightest. He calmly said, “What are you talking about? How could robbing people be as efficient as this? This bronze cauldron went through the verification of countless masters. Why do you think I fled the Violet Flame Heaven and came to the Nirvana Overflow Heaven? If you don’t believe me, just ask around!”

“You previously said that no one could verify its authenticity, and now you’re saying that countless people have verified it? You’re clearly lying. When we look at it and it’s fake, you’ll say that it was others who declared it to be the Heaven Earth Cauldron, and then ask us to take it up with them instead of you. It seems that you aren’t that naively young. You’re even more bored than an old fellow like me who has lived for eight thousand years,” sneered a Heaven Venerate.

“Alright, let’s just leave. This fellow’s a scammer, and the Soaring Dragon Company is also untrustworthy. You can’t believe a word they say.” Someone shook his head and walked away.

In truth, the majority of the people here felt him to be a scammer. There was no way anyone would fall for it.

People even felt that the dead large man was a part of it, building a foundation for Long Chen’s scam. All of this had been practiced in advance to scam money out of people.

Once the first person left, the others did too as there was no longer a show to watch. They shook their heads as they walked away. However, Long Chen hastily called out, “Hey, hey, don’t leave! Let’s do some business! We can still haggle!” Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Damn scammer, scram! What? Now that your scam fails, you’re just going to directly rob people?”

Seeing Long Chen want to stop them, the people around were angry. In the end, no matter how Long Chen tried to get them to stay behind, the crowd slowly scattered.

Just like that, a serious piece of news spread from this region: There is a big scammer who says that he has the Heaven Earth Cauldron, and he is trying to sell tickets to look at it. Don’t be duped!
