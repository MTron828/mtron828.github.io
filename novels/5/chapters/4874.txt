Chapter 4863 Going Through the Backdoor

Seeing Long Chen’s reaction, Xing Wujiang also grew excited and then slapped his leg. “Do you also have a relationship with the Grand Xia Dragon Sparrow? No wonder I felt an indescribable closeness when I first saw you!”

Now Long Chen understood why he had sensed a familiar aura on Xing Wujiang. Even though it was their first time meeting, he already had a feeling that he could trust Xing Wujiang.

“Big Brother Wujiang, what relationship did your ancestor have with the Grand Xia’s imperial family?” asked Long Chen.

“My ancestor was the head of the Grand Xia imperial family’s four divine generals,” answered Xing Wujiang.

“So that’s the case. I have another big brother. He possesses the main bloodline of the Grand Xia imperial family and also has the blessing of the Grand Xia Dragon Sparrow,” said Long Chen, thinking of Xia Guhong.

“The main bloodline of the Grand Xia imperial family still exists?” Xing Wujiang exclaimed, visibly moved as he grasped Long Chen's arm. “Brother, I must pay him my respects.”

As the descendants of the Grand Xia’s divine general, the Xing family had always been searching for their master's whereabouts. Despite countless years of searching yielding no results, they never gave up hope. They firmly believed that under the protection of the Grand Xia Dragon Sparrow, the imperial family would endure.

When Xing Wujiang learned of their survival, his eyes reddened. This was the outcome that the Xing family had been bitterly waiting for.

“Big Brother Wujiang, calm down a bit.”

Long Chen quickly told Xing Wujiang about how he had met Xia Guhong and Xia Guhong’s story. Upon learning that Xia Guhong’s beloved was killed and he was targeted by everyone, Xing Wujiang gritted his teeth so hard that they almost shattered. He had the urge to charge out and kill all those fuckers right now.

“There’s no rush. Big Brother Guhong has the Grand Xia imperial family’s bloodline and the Grand Xia Dragon Sparrow’s blessing. Now that the Sovereign Emperor Heaven has opened, the nine heavens and ten lands are undergoing a transformation. The Grand Xia Dragon Sparrow will definitely make a comeback. As its rightful heir, Big Brother Guhong will make his move then. We just need to pay attention to any news of the Grand Xia Dragon Sparrow, and we’ll find him there,” explained Long Chen.

Long Chen had previously discussed the changes in the nine heavens and ten lands with the Earth Cauldron. The Earth Cauldron had informed him that this was the optimal moment for supreme divine items to undergo recovery—they couldn't afford to miss this opportunity. If the tribulation arrived while they were still damaged, even these supreme divine items would fall.

The Earth Cauldron was also thinking about how to upgrade itself. According to what it said, the other supreme divine items should be doing the same thing. However, they were doing it secretly and would not expose themselves lightly.

After Long Chen explained this to Xing Wujiang, he finally calmed down and sighed, “My young master has appeared, but I can’t even find him. If my ancestors were to know of this, they would definitely scold me for being incompetent.”

Hearing this, Long Chen and Mo Nian exchanged a look, surprised by how loyal Xing Wujiang was. Seeing him care so much about these ancestral teachings, they couldn’t help but admire him. Such a heroic figure was truly rare in this world.

After all, these teachings were a thing from countless years ago. The mountains and plains had long since changed, and even the Square Heaven Seal had been bedeviled, yet shockingly, it was the fickle human heart that remained the same, a rare phenomenon indeed.

“Big Brother, we’re really fortunate to be able to meet a hero like you. Let’s raise another cup in your honor!” exclaimed Mo Nian. He and Long Chen then lifted their cups.

“To have met young and unparalleled heavenly geniuses like you two, I am the fortunate one! Cheers!” said Xing Wujiang, feeling emotional. The three of them then clinked cups together. At this moment, their guards went down, and the atmosphere was filled with laughter and wine.

After an hour of non-stop drinking, even though Mo Nian’s tolerance wasn’t bad and he wasn’t drinking the intense wine, he was starting to get tipsy.

With wine in his cup, Mo Nian raised it to toast Xing Wujiang. He asked, “Big Brother Wujiang, do you know of Heaven Screen Mountain?”

Startled, Xing Wujiang replied, “Heaven Screen Mountain? Do you mean the cursed mountain shrouded in eternal night to the northwest of the city?”

“Yes, yes, that place!”

“It’s a cursed land but also a land of treasures. It has a bit of a connection to Devil Fall City. What about it?”

Long Chen also asked, “Don’t tell me that you lost half of your life there before running to me?”

“Isn’t that precisely it? I did lose half of my life there,” answered Mo Nian.

“You got to Heaven Screen Mountain and came out alive?” Xing Wujiang stared at Mo Nian in disbelief.

“Are you saying that I’m not alive right now?” laughed Mo Nian.

Xing Wujiang said, “Then you are really strong. Heaven Screen Mountain only opens to adventurers once a century. Furthermore, every opening requires the Square Heaven Seal’s power.

“You might not be aware of this, but the suppressed head beneath the city is the head of the devil corpse buried within Heaven Screen Mountain. That is why the Square Heaven Seal is able to use a trace of its devil qi to open Heaven Screen Mountain.

“Right now isn’t even close to the opening of Heaven Screen Mountain, and even Heaven Saints are unable to bypass the cursed barrier. If they were to force their way in, they would never be able to leave. However, you managed to enter and even return alive. You’re strong!” Despite being very powerful himself, Xing Wujiang repeatedly said that Mo Nian was strong, causing Mo Nian to feel very excited.

Only now did Long Chen learn that Devil Fall City and Heaven Screen Mountain were the two places that the terrifying devil’s corpse was split into. The two of them were truly connected.

“Hmph, I’d only be considered strong if I managed to get in and out without losing a single hair. But I almost lost my life there. It’s embarrassing to talk about it. Big Brother, to tell the truth, I saw quite a few good things when I went in. I wasn’t in the right condition before, but now, hehe, since we’re brothers, is it possible to open a backdoor?” Mo Nian wriggled his eyebrows with a smile.

“You want to use the Square Heaven Seal to open Heaven Screen Mountain in advance? That would require the assent of the four noble families, as well as the approval of the Square Heaven Seal. Right now, we’ve offended the four noble families. They’ll definitely cause a ruckus no matter what,” responded Xing Wujiang, frowning.

“Is that so? If it requires their consent, then there’s no chance to open the backdoor,” Mo Nian sighed in disappointment.

He had been hoping to go through a backdoor by relying on this connection. Then he wouldn’t need to go to such lengths to get through the curse barrier. But unfortunately, they got no chance to do so.

“Well, I don’t think so,” said Long Chen suddenly.

“What? Do you have another evil plan? Tell me!” Hearing Long Chen say this, Mo Nian was instantly revitalized.

“Big Brother Wujiang, don’t ask the four families. Just ask the Square Heaven Seal. I feel like if you do that, your chances of success will be very high,” suggested Long Chen.

“Why is that?” asked Xing Wujiang blankly.

“If the Square Heaven Seal really has been bedeviled, it will be in an even greater rush to open Heaven Screen Mountain. Why don’t you test it? My intuition tells me that it will be very happy to open it,” replied Long Chen.

“Alright, I’ll try it now.” Xing Wujiang nodded and walked out immediately.
