Chapter 5009 Qin Feng vs. Heavenly Chosen

“Bastard, that’s a sneak attack!” Long Ziwei was shocked and enraged. A grand Heavenly Chosen had charged onto the martial stage and attacked without a word. That was no different from a sneak attack.

Clearly, one of the Ye clan’s referees had silently communicated with Ye Lingkong and sent him in to deal with Qin Feng. Ye Lingkong had unleashed his full power to kill Qin Feng on the spot.

Qin Feng had thoroughly provoked the Ye clan and the Zhao clan’s experts, so they were willing to pay any price to kill him.

“Don’t panic. Don’t you see that Long Chen is still calm?” Feng Fei pointed to Long Chen upon seeing Long Ziwei’s reaction.

Indeed... Long Ziwei looked over and saw Long Chen sitting calmly. He was leaning back with his legs crossed, showing no signs of anger or nervousness.

Qin Feng unsheathed his sword once more.

BOOM!

With an explosive sound, Qin Feng was blasted back by Ye Lingkong’s overhead swing, crashing into the barrier of the martial stage.

Qin Feng spat out a mouthful of blood, causing people to cry out. Previously, Qin Feng had slain Ye Qing and Zhao Qingyu without revealing his power. However, against a powerful Heavenly Chosen, Qin Feng couldn’t afford to do so.

“Die!” Ye Lingkong sneered. Seeing his opponent injured, he immediately followed up, diving down on Qin Feng like a divine bird.

Rather than panic, Qin Feng looked calm and just smiled. “So, this is the power of a Heavenly Chosen? It truly is formidable. Good, if you’re that strong, I can show you my full power.”

His Blood Qi surged violently as he took a deep breath and bellowed, “Dragon Blood Battle Armor!”

Qin Feng’s dragon blood energy erupted like a volcanic eruption, resonating with a majestic dragon cry that echoed through heaven and earth. At the same time, scales enveloped him, and the image of a two-headed dragon manifested behind him.

“The two-headed dragon?”

After the baptism of the dragon nest, each Dragonblood warrior had found a dragon soul that matched them, and from that point on, their Dragon Blood Battle Armors and manifestations transformed. So, this was Long Chen’s first glimpse of Qin Feng’s new manifestation. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

Qin Feng’s Blood Qi roared as he swung his sword at Ye Lingkong. With an explosive sound, Blood Qi and Doyen runes filled the martial stage, shocking everyone.

“Heavens!”

Long Ziwei’s jaw dropped. Qin Feng actually possessed such a terrifying technique? The power Qin Feng displayed now surpassed what Long Chen had shown him in their past battle. Now Long Ziwei understood that Long Chen had been toying with him back then, not taking the fight seriously at all.

The clash of two divine weapons unleashed qi waves that twisted space, and everyone stared in shock and terror at the scene. They were finally bearing witness to Qin Feng’s true power.

At that moment, they realized that Qin Feng was truly a nine star Doyen.

“Now you should know what a Dragonblood warrior is. Only in their Dragon Blood Battle Armor are they truly at full power,” said Feng Fei. Although her expression was calm, she was filled with emotion. She had seen the Dragonblood warriors in the mortal world, and now she was witnessing how much they had grown.

Long Chen’s rate of growth could be called monstrous, but the Dragonblood warriors always managed to keep up with him. So, not one of them could be considered an ordinary person. They were all monsters.

“How can this be?”

The spectators could not believe their eyes. Qin Feng had just blocked the full-power attack of a Heavenly Chosen.

BOOM!

Suddenly, Qin Feng stepped forward, forcing Ye Lingkong back a step. Everyone’s expressions changed.

Qin Feng advanced three more steps, while Ye Lingkong was pushed back three steps. Each step caused the martial stage to shudder, with minute cracks appearing beneath their feet.

“The martial stage is unable to endure their power!”

BOOM!

Qin Feng thrust his sword forward, sending Ye Lingkong staggering back. The latter’s feet dragged against the martial stage, releasing an ear-piercing sound.

Ye Lingkong slammed into the barrier before he could stabilize himself.

BANG!

Staring at Ye Lingkong, Qin Feng said, “A Heavenly Chosen is only this powerful? Hmph, after losing, you guys resort to a despicable sneak attack. Such base tactics are beneath even the most ordinary mercenaries. Yet, you use them so naturally. If someone like you is called a Heavenly Chosen, are the heavens truly despicable?”

“You dare to blaspheme the heavens?!”

Ye Lingkong was shocked and enraged. His Heavenly Fate Disk spun rapidly, igniting his Doyen power as his fury grew.

“How laughable. If someone like you can be considered a Heavenly Chosen, that shows how blind the heavens are. Is there even a need for me to blaspheme them?” Qin Feng sneered. His dragon scales suddenly turned over, and runes began flowing from each scale, gathering toward his arms.

Qin Feng said, “I can’t be bothered to waste words with you. Didn’t you say that you look down on me? Then I’ll show you my true power. Double Dragon Deathblow!”

The two-headed dragon in his manifestation vanished. Instead, a dragon head appeared on the back of his hands. Endless power then poured from his arms into his sword as he slashed down.

“Die! Heavenly Fate Dust Extinction!” Ye Lingkong also roared and compressed all his Doyen power into his weapon.

BOOM!

The entire martial stage exploded, and countless pieces of rubble smashed into the barrier. The barrier completely deformed, but it didn’t break. Otherwise, no one knew how many casualties would appear amongst the spectators.

As the barrier slowly calmed down and the space inside stopped twisting, people saw a giant hole.

Ye Lingkong was kneeling on the ground but lying back in a strange posture. His sword lay not too far from him. Blood constantly leaked from his mouth, and his chest heaved. He tried to get up several times, but his body refused to cooperate.

On the other side, Qin Feng stood holding his sword, his body covered in blood. Though in a terrible state, he remained standing, staring at Ye Lingkong calmly.

Everyone was deathly silent. While the space around them had settled, the shock in their hearts had not.

Suddenly, Long Chen appeared on the martial stage and patted Qin Feng’s shoulder.

“That’s enough. Give me some face and spare his worthless life,” said Long Chen.

In truth, Long Chen could tell that Qin Feng’s condition was extremely grave. He could no longer move, with terrifying Doyen power running rampant in his body, tearing him apart. If Long Chen hadn’t appeared, Qin Feng would soon have collapsed; his injuries were worse than Ye Lingkong’s.

However, with two pats on Qin Feng’s shoulder, the Doyen power raging within him silently transferred into Long Chen. Qin Feng instantly felt a sense of relief.

Qin Feng smiled inside. This battle could be considered a draw. After all, he no longer had the power to kill his opponent. Just as he was about to give in to his boss’s compromise, a snort echoed throughout the martial stage.

“But what if I don’t want to spare your worthless lives?”
