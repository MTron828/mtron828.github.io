Chapter 2456 Seven Star World Extermination

Translator: BornToBe

Flames rose in the form of a lotus, growing larger and larger. Long Chen began to chant the Nirvana Scripture, causing flame runes to fly out of thin air and enter the flame lotus.

With each second, the flame lotus crazily grew, and a particular rune on each petal lit up, forming a star. After that, the stars changed, becoming two, and then two became three.

Every time a new star appeared, the world would shudder. By the time the flame lotus reached its peak size, every petal had seven stars on top of it, and the surrounding void was distorted by the heat.

An invisible destructive energy caused the world to shake. The laws of the Heavenly Daos were whining. This flame lotus possessed the power to destroy the entire world.

Compared to the giant flame lotus, Long Chen himself appeared as tiny as an ant. His hand shuddered, and blood dripped down his arm.

“This is the limit? Huo Linger has yet to fully control her power, and the burden to my own body has increased as a result. But this is enough.”

Long Chen slowly released his flame lotus. It slowly fell down, but as it did, it fluctuated, clearly unstable.

Long Chen grew nervous upon seeing that. Huo Linger’s current power was so immense that if it exploded here, he would be blasted apart by his own technique.

He carefully controlled the flame lotus, sending it toward the giant mudfish monster.

The fierce mudfish monster shivered and suddenly dove beneath the marsh.

“I feel like we should all back up. Boss is angry,” suggested one of the Dragonblood warriors. Everyone else immediately nodded and ran further away.

“World Extermination Flame Lotus!”

Long Chen’s hand seal suddenly changed. The flame lotus stopped swiveling and then smashed straight down with a horrifying rumbling.

Even before it touched the marsh, the marsh became distorted. The mudfish monster was instantly exposed.

The marsh was unable to protect it as the World Extermination Flame Lotus fell. The nine petals had seven stars each, a total of sixty-three stars. They all detonated, and that was like sixty-three Star Falls exploding.

The instant that it exploded, color faded from the world. Light turned dark. For a moment, everyone felt like they had lost their sense of vision.

When their vision recovered, they saw a fragmented scene. Fragments of spacetime were in the wrong place. The world that they were seeing was in chaos.

Within that chaos, they could barely see a figure falling from the sky, and then they heard the sound of a sharp blade piercing flesh.

In the next moment, the world returned to its normal state. Their vision cleared, allowing them to see a giant hole in the marsh.

A giant blade was stabbed through the mudfish monster’s head. It was still twitching, but that was its deathbed struggles.

Long Chen stood atop Evilmoon’s hilt, staring coldly at the mudfish that he had skewered. This image stunned everyone. It was only after a long time that someone let out a cheer, breaking people out of their stupor.

The mudfish finally became motionless. This terrifying monster was something above the Netherpassage realm and had been able to survive the World Extermination Flame Lotus, albeit just barely. However, after the explosion, it had not been far from death. A follow-up attack from Evilmoon was enough to end its life.

“The seven star World Extermination Flame Lotus is my current limit. It used up eighty percent of my spiritual yuan. Even if Huo Linger was in full control of her own power, there’s no way I could use such an attack twice,” sighed Long Chen.

The World Extermination Flame Lotus’s power had even frightened him. The only reason the mudfish monster hadn’t died instantly was because the marsh had helped block part of its power.

“Huo Linger’s advancement has caused the World Extermination Flame Lotus’s power to grow as well. Once Huo Linger is in full control of her power, it will be time to perfect this attack.” Long Chen clenched his fists proudly. This technique was something that he had made himself, and was his strongest attack.

Long Chen then sucked the corpse into the primal chaos space. Although its entire body could be considered a priceless treasure, its flesh was now badly charred. There was no way to make snakeskin armor from it. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

Its meat would definitely be the greatest gift to Wilde. It also had a crystal core, but it was a very rarely seen dark attribute core that he currently didn’t have a use for.

Long Chen looked back toward the island at the center of the marsh. The image of an immortal wonderland had been shattered. The entire island was charred and covered in mud.

As for the giant tree, its leaves had been incinerated, and some of the smaller branches were gone.

“Con me and you end up conning yourself. You deserve it!” snorted Long Chen. He had thought about going over to cause more trouble for the Heavenly Qilin Demon Tree, but he decided against it. Sovereign Qing Xu hadn’t killed it even though it had tried to kill him. Most likely, there was some deeper meaning to this.

“Hm? Sovereign Yun Shang was capable of seeing the future. Is this Heavenly Qilin Demon Tree some kind of opportunity that Sovereign Qing Xu left for me?” Long Chen suddenly thought of a possibility. “Fine, I’ll let it go this time and leave this opportunity to the next person.”

Long Chen finally decided not to kill it. The mud and water slowly flowed back into the marsh, and the laws of space and time that he had shattered were slowly repairing. If he still didn’t leave, the laws of the marsh would return and make it so that he couldn’t fly.

Taking advantage of the broken laws, he hastily flew out of the marsh. When he returned, the Martial Heaven Alliance’s disciples and the Xuan Beasts cheered. They were filled with even greater reverence for him.

Although there was no way for them to estimate just how powerful the mudfish was, based on its aura, it was definitely an existence above Netherpassage. Long Chen had managed to even slay such an existence. He was incredibly powerful, enough to inspire them and give them confidence.

“Boss, were there any gains?” asked one Dragonblood warrior excitedly.

“There was an island at the center of the swamp where I gained some precious medicines. Since none of you can really use them, I’ll be taking them for myself. However, there is something that everyone can use.” Long Chen took out a Heavenly Qilin Demon Fruit.

People stared at it, befuddled. They had no idea what this scaled fruit was.

“Could it be… is this a Heavenly Qilin Demon Fruit from the time of myths?” asked one of the Martial Heaven Alliance’s disciples suddenly.

“Haha, amazing, you recognized it.” Long Chen gave this disciple a thumbs up. He hadn’t expected someone to really know of it. If it hadn’t been for the Pill Sovereign memories, even he wouldn’t have recognized it.

He had never seen a recording of the Heavenly Qilin Demon Fruit within the records of the Martial Heaven Alliance. If someone knew of it, they had to have seen it within some ancient, fragmented texts.

“It really is a Heavenly Qilin Demon Fruit. It is said that eating it can allow someone to immediately ascend and become a god or immortal!” cried out that disciple.

Long Chen’s praising expression vanished. He shook his head. “Alright, it seems you’ve listened to too many stories. That’s nonsense. This Heavenly Qilin Demon Fruit has a huge amount of life essence within it of a divine nature. That divine nature allows it to extend a person’s longevity. Even someone on the verge of dying will fully recover with just a drop of its juice. However, that’s not the main thing. The main thing is that due to how long they’ve been mature, they’ve absorbed the laws of the Heavenly Daos. If a cultivator consumes one, their comprehension of the Heavenly Daos will soar. It will make your future path much clearer. For us, it can greatly increase our chances of advancing to the fourth step of Netherpassage. Not only that, it will make the bottleneck above that much easier to break through.”

Everyone was delighted to hear this. But they quickly grew disappointed. There were so many of them and only one Heavenly Qilin Demon Fruit. They wouldn’t get a chance to have it.

“Haha, don’t be disappointed. I gained a total of eight hundred and sixty-seven fruits. The Dragonblood Legion won’t be taking a portion. If we split it, each person can have three drops of its juice. Just one drop should be enough for yourselves, so you can sell the rest to others,” said Long Chen.

“Senior apprentice-brother Long Chen, we can’t do that. If you hadn’t come, we probably wouldn’t have obtained any. A person can’t be greedy. Just one drop would be more than enough for us. The rest should be left to your Dragonblood Legion,” said one disciple immediately.

“That’s right, senior apprentice-brother Long Chen-”

“Don’t get all weepy on me. Hurry and divide them up. We have to hurry on,” said Long Chen, tossing the Heavenly Qilin Demon Fruit to the Dragonblood warriors to extract the juice and split up.

The Dragonblood warriors quickly squeezed out the juices, but the fruit pits were kept by Long Chen.

“Hehe, this is the real good thing.” Long Chen smiled and tossed the pits into the primal chaos space.
