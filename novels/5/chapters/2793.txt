Chapter 2782 Blood Moon Wild Wolf

Before becoming a god, he first became a ghost? The Blood Fiend Devil Lord was killed by a single claw from the snow wolf.

Considering how excited he had been with his back facing toward the snow wolf, he had probably been anticipating the sight of the snow wolf slaughtering everyone on the battlefield. But before it even got started, everything was ended by that claw.

Suddenly, a translucent figure floated out of the ground. That was the god’s incarnation, and it was completely enraged. The snow wolf had killed the Blood Fiend Devil Lord, leaving nowhere for the incarnation to go.

Not just anyone was capable of accepting a god’s incarnation. They had to have faith energy as a vector. Without a host, the incarnation was unable to unleash any of its power. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

“You damn animal-”

The incarnation’s roar was cut off when it was devoured into a large mouth.

There was no struggle at all. The incarnation was simply swallowed by the snow wolf and vanished, stunning everyone.

The snow wolf then let out a howl. The earth crumbled, and the stars quivered as if they would fall.

After that, the void behind its back shuddered, and an image of a full moon appeared as fragments of spacetime blew apart.

This full moon was a blood moon, and its light filled the world. The image of a snow wolf standing in the sky was deeply imprinted in people’s souls.

“It’s Little Snow!”

When the snow wolf howled, the Dragonblood warriors cried out excitedly. That howl contained a supreme law that caused the image of Little Snow to appear in the Dragonblood warriors’ minds.

It told them that it had returned. It had gone through nirvanic rebirth and completely transformed.

Seeing this, Meng Qi, Chu Yao, Tang Wan-er, and the others wept emotionally. Back then, Little Snow had died to the curse of one of the Corrupt path’s experts.

Back then, everyone’s heart had broken, including Long Chen’s. But now, Little Snow had made a powerful return.

Suddenly, the space beneath Little Snow’s feet exploded, and it transformed into a white bolt of lightning shooting toward the Alldevil Heavenwalker and the Nine-Headed Lion. Neither of them understood what was happening.

However, the two of them roared and divine energy exploded out of them. The three of them clashed fiercely, shaking the world.

As a result, both the Alldevil Heavenwalker and the Nine-Headed Lion were sent flying. They left giant cracks in the earth and were flung all the way to the Martial Heaven Sea-Ring.

The terrain of the continent was changing completely. The power of gods had surpassed people’s comprehension.

Seeing that Little Snow was so powerful, the Dragonblood warriors cheered. Suddenly, Little Snow raised its head and roared. In the sky, the stars shuddered, and the blood moon caused the world to twist. After that, endless wind energy gathered toward Little Snow.

When a ball of light appeared in Little Snow’s mouth, an ear-piercing sound rang out.

“What terrifying wind energy!” Tang Wan-er couldn’t help crying out in shock. As a wind cultivator, and having refined a wind attribute divine bone, her control over wind energy had reached a kind of limit.

However, the wind energy that Little Snow was using did not belong to this world. There was a giant gulf between their powers. Compared to Little Snow’s wind energy, the Martial Heaven Continent’s wind energy was like a rice straw that encountered a sharp blade.

At this moment, endless wind blades had gathered inside Little Snow’s mouth. They were moving so fast that it looked as if they were static. As the sphere of wind blades quivered, space was torn apart and the laws crumbled. A vacuum appeared around Little Snow.

BOOM!

Suddenly, Little Snow spat the sphere of wind blades out. It then suddenly grew larger and flew toward the Martial Heaven Sea-Ring.

The Martial Heaven Continent’s wind energy was being sucked into the sphere. Just as the Alldevil Heavenwalker and the Nine-Headed Lion flew out of the Martial Heaven Sea-Ring, this sphere of wind blades struck them.

BOOM!

The sphere exploded, causing the water to burst and crash against both shores. Countless mountains were devoured by crazy waves and blasted apart.

This attack affected a large portion of the Martial Heaven Continent and left the Alldevil Heavenwalker and the Nine-Headed Lion covered in blood. The range of this attack was so huge that there was no way to block it.

Forcibly receiving it resulted in them being seriously wounded. Even the god incarnations weakened.

BOOM!

Little Snow’s giant figure charged after the two of them, and its sharp claws tore through the void. It was completely unstoppable.

The Alldevil Heavenwalker and the Nine-Headed Lion tried to counterattack, but Little Snow’s body was so terrifyingly strong that their divine items couldn’t even harm its fur.

Furthermore, the divine energy surging around it was even stronger than what was coming from the Alldevil Heavenwalker and the Nine-Headed Lion. The two of them were then forced further and further back all the way to the Northern Source.

“Ye Ming, come help!” shouted the Nine-Headed Lion. He had no idea what this snow wolf was, but even with both of them joining forces, they were unable to retaliate. If this continued, they might be killed.

However, Ye Ming simply snorted and ignored them, going straight for Long Chen. His only target was Long Chen, so everyone else’s life or death mattered little to him.

“Bastard!” The Nine-Headed Lion cursed furiously. Ye Ming had ruined their plan at the start, and now the god possessing him was just as selfish.

“Split up!”

The Nine-Headed Lion suddenly shouted, and the two of them flew in different directions. This way, Little Snow would only be able to chase one of them.

Little Snow ultimately chose to target the Nine-Headed Lion, causing him to turn green. He cursed inside. If they were both four-legged, why did Little Snow have to make things hard on him?

The Alldevil Heavenwalker’s speed was clearly slower than his, so Little Snow should have chosen him.

BOOM!

Little Snow’s claw fell and the Nine-Headed Lion coughed up blood, unable to beat Little Snow. After that, Little Snow bit down on his neck, causing him to scream. Two of his heads were swallowed by Little Snow, turning him into the Seven-Headed Lion.

“Little Snow, come here quickly!”

Just as Little Snow was about to chase after and kill him, Meng Qi’s spiritual call came from the center of the continent.

Little Snow was most familiar with Long Chen and Meng Qi. Hence, when it heard Meng Qi’s cry, it immediately looked back.

It noticed that the Alldevil Heavenwalker had charged back toward Long Chen. With a furious roar, it abandoned the Nine-Headed Lion and charged back toward the battlefield.
