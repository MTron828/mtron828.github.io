Chapter 3213 Honing Heavenly Staircase

Using the Bloodkill Hall assassin’s clone, Long Chen had tried to pinpoint the location of his true body. Unfortunately, he hadn’t managed to succeed.

Long Chen could sense that the true body was secretly watching things here from a certain location, but it was too far, or he was using some secret art. Hence, Long Chen was unable to tell the exact location.

Just as Long Chen was tracking the clone’s blood soul power back to its source, the assassin chose to detonate his clone. Long Chen’s goal was clearly seen through.

Although the clone was dead, Long Chen was still a bit worried. This fellow was hiding in the dark, ready to attack at any moment. Long Chen felt like a pair of eyes was watching his back.

This person was a late stage Primal Divine Lord. If Long Chen had been the slightest bit negligent, this assassin would have had a chance to kill him. It had to be known that assassins were killers who killed people across realms.

Long Chen wasn’t that afraid of himself being targeted. He was more worried about this fellow targeting the people beside him in order to provoke him. In his fury, he might show an opening.

The Bloodkill Hall’s assassins were willing to use any means necessary to achieve their goal. Back then, they had even used a child like Dong Mingyu in an attempt to kill him. That was enough to show him that they deserved to be exterminated.

Other than Enpuda, they had no respect for anything, so they were capable of doing anything as well. That was the most troubling thing for Long Chen.

It could be said that Enpuda had made his absolute determination to kill Long Chen this time. His Bloodkill Order turned Long Chen into the target for all his followers, making it so that Long Chen would be pestered to death.

“Come then. Let’s see if you have more people than I can kill.” Long Chen sneered inside. Within the Heavenly Swell Domain, Enpuda was too afraid of the High Firmament Academy to come himself. Hence, he could only send his followers.

Furthermore, for Enpuda, a World King, someone who had made a name for himself countless years ago, to come personally kill a Four Peak disciple would be a complete loss of face. After all, Enpuda had quite the reputation to uphold in the immortal world.

In other words, as long as Long Chen didn’t leave the Heavenly Swell Domain, Enpuda wouldn’t be able to come after him personally. It seemed that he was testing the attitude of the High Firmament Academy by sending Divine Lord assassins. That seemed to still be within the realm of tolerance for the High Firmament Academy.

Perhaps the academy had faith in Long Chen and only viewed these assassinations as trials. Long Chen had only heard of the Bloodkill Order today, and he believed that the higher-ups of the academy couldn’t have not known about it. They simply hadn’t told him about it.

Long Chen hadn’t even finished anything in the Luo family, but the Bloodkill Hall was once more causing trouble. Long Chen had a belly full of fire, but when he thought of Enpuda’s head filled with crap, he felt a bit better.

The current Long Chen needed to maintain a good mood. He couldn’t always get angry, or the negative emotions would nourish the dark energy. Moreover, his eye had yet to recover, so he didn’t dare to once more unleash the power of the Purgatory Eyes.

He was constantly wearing an eyepatch, making him appear like a one-eyed person. Although he didn’t really care what he looked like, he did feel a bit uncomfortable.

“Senior, what is going on with the devil sea? Why would so many sea demons come onto the land? What did the Chu family do?” asked Long Chen as they sat on the flying boat back to the Luo family.

This battlefield did have a transportation formation that could directly bring them, but that would be rude. Thus, they sat on a flying boat. This was Long Chen’s first time in the Ying Prefecture, so the Luo family had to be a good host.

The Ying Prefecture was also known as the Wetlands Prefecture. There were countless mountain ranges with glades and ponds around them. It was a very beautiful scenery, but Long Chen wasn’t in the mood to enjoy the scenery. He wanted to know about the devil sea.

Luo Changwu answered, “There is a certain legend about the devil sea. It is said that some terrifying devil died within it during the primal chaos era, and the devil sea was formed out of its blood. It has an irregular form, like snakes of the entire immortal world. The devil sea is not actually in the shape of a sea but more like a river. It grows, producing endless sea demons and deep sea devils. It is said that there are many levels in its depths, and the deeper you go, the higher the status of the devils you’ll find. The so-called sea demons that we’ve encountered are nothing more than the lowest level of pawns, the most active but weakest group. Due to the current, some sea demons often wash up on land, and finding lifeforms here, they’ll try to consume them. To put it more frankly, whether it is sea demons or deep sea devils, they are like fish in the sea, coming wave by wave. Once a wave is killed, there’s no way to predict when the next wave will come. The sea serpents that you killed very rarely appear. They normally view sea demons as their food and rarely come onto land.” ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

“What is that devil from the primal chaos era?” Bai Xiaole couldn’t help interjecting.

Luo Changwu bitterly smiled. “No one can say for sure. Such a legend is hard to believe. Since Long Chen asked, I tried to answer, but don’t take it too seriously.”

The human race’s history could only be traced back to the immemorial era. As for the desolate era, there were only some primitive diagrams that people couldn’t understand. They could only try to infer things based on their own imagination.

However, every person inferred different things. Those diagrams were difficult to comprehend. Thus, there were many legends of the desolate era, but their veracity could not be confirmed. That was even more true of the primal chaos era that occurred even further in the past.

Thus, many legends were just treated as stories to be heard. There was no need to take them too seriously.

“No wonder I didn’t encounter a single sea demon when I crossed the devil sea. It seems that I didn’t run into that wave,” said Xu Zixiong.

Luo Changwu nodded. “Your luck was good. Due to the mist on top of the devil sea, if you travel too fast, it will cause friction that wears down the runes of a flying boat. Thus, traveling between the Heavenly Star Domain and the Heavenly Swell Domain through the devil sea will require at least twenty days. Normally when crossing, especially when crossing the center, you’ll encounter several waves of attacks, maybe even dozens. Only a few powers have experts with blood runes to drive those sea demons away. Others will have to endure the attacks, and especially when crossing the center, that will easily disturb the deep sea devils. Once a fight starts, you will very likely find yourself buried within the devil sea. For you to have crossed the devil sea by yourself, your luck is truly heaven-defying. Even now, I’m finding it hard to believe.”

Hearing that, Long Chen sank into thought. At this moment, an exceedingly brazen thought rose within him. He felt like the devil sea was a good place.

The Luo family was located within a range of stone mountains. Stone swords were like forests, and not a single blade of grass grew. This place almost seemed a bit desolate. Long Chen almost couldn’t believe his eyes.

With Long Chen’s arrival, countless experts came to greet them. After all, Long Chen’s medicinal pills had helped them out immensely in their time of need. The Luo family would naturally welcome him warmly.

Suddenly, just as he was off of the flying boat, a detached and mighty voice rang out as if descending from above the nine heavens.

“Bring him to the Honing Heavenly Staircase.”
