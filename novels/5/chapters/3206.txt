Chapter 3195 Crisis of Life and Death

Long Chen’s chest was pierced through, and black lightning still lingered on top of the wound. That sinister aura gave even Bai Zhantang and the others the chills.

This was a kind of unknown power. How could such a thing appear in a heavenly tribulation?

However, Long Chen’s expression was still completely calm as he faced those black lightning swords. He didn’t show the slightest bit of panic. Seeing him like this, Bai Xiaole’s mother now understood why he had said that he was very familiar with this.

Long Chen’s lightning-covered blade slashed the black swords repeatedly. With every clash, ripples would spread and shatter the other lightning swords. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Even peak rank runic swords were nothing in front of those black swords. Those black lightning swords seemed to have come from hell. They were sinister and domineering. It seemed that they wouldn’t rest until Long Chen was slain.

Furthermore, every blow was incredibly heavy and required all of Long Chen’s power to receive. As a result, cracks could be seen all over his body.

Fortunately, the primal chaos space was filled with Wood Foundation Divine Trees that offered him an enormous amount of life energy. Because of them, he quickly healed.

It went without saying that the Wood Foundation Divine Trees were truly powerful. Even injuries of the Heavenly Daos could be instantly healed by their life energy. Without them, Long Chen would have died long ago.

At this moment, the void shuddered and another black lightning sword appeared. The three black swords then weaved through the air, repeatedly striking Long Chen. No matter what he did, he was unable to break them.

Everyone’s heart clenched. If those black swords didn’t break, then considering that they were in the heavenly tribulation, they would have an unending supply of energy. But Long Chen would run out of energy sooner or later.

The three black swords danced around him, and Long Chen fought intensely against them. As for the other lightning swords, he no longer had time to bother with them. As long as they didn’t strike him in his vitals, he let them strike him.

He needed all of his attention on those black swords. Even though the swords containing rank seven runes could pierce his skin, they weren’t able to pose a mortal threat to him. He only had to be a bit more careful of the peak rank seven-colored runes and avoid being struck in his vital parts.

As for rank six swords and below, they could be ignored. But even then, there were too many rank seven and peak rank lightning swords. They repeatedly injured him.

Anyone else would dream of obtaining a peak rank rune. However, those Heavenly Dao runes were now the swords trying to take his life.

The higher-ups of the academy didn’t know if this was simply how his tribulation should have been, or if it was due to him continuously provoking the Heavenly Daos, causing them to unleash this heavenly punishment. In any case, they had never seen such a terrifying tribulation before.

Furthermore, they only dared to watch and didn’t even attempt to record it. That might be instantly sensed by the Heavenly Daos. Even if the act wasn’t punished immediately, it might cause karmic retributions for them later. It might even implicate the karmic luck of their families, resulting in their family line coming to an end.

Such a heavenly tribulation could not be recorded. Anyone who tried would suddenly start to encounter all kinds of misfortunes. They definitely wouldn’t have a good ending, and anyone tied to them might also be affected.

Thus, such a thing could only be transmitted through word of mouth. As time passed, such a thing would become a story that people doubted the veracity of.

However, this black lightning seemed to be some kind of taboo, so they only dared to look. They didn’t dare to even spread word of this, afraid of it bringing some kind of bad karma.

Suddenly, another black bolt appeared in the air. Just as Long Chen was fighting the first three black swords, the fourth one slashed into Long Chen’s body with no warning at all. Long Chen was almost cut in two and blood flew through the air. His abdomen was almost emptied.

Bai Shishi and the others covered their mouths, almost crying out. Long Chen was just a bit off from dying.

“How close.” Long Chen’s heart shook. Fortunately, he had been prepared for this and had had Lei Long place a layer of lightning over his bones. This layer of lightning was black. It was the power that Lei Long had just started to absorb by blocking the attacks of these black swords.

Long Chen quickly drew out the energy of the Wood Foundation Divine Trees to heal. But afterward, his expression changed.

This time, his wound was too severe. The Wood Foundation Divine Trees were starting to show signs of withering. In other words, any more life energy he extracted might kill them.

If he took another wound like that, it might take all their remaining energy to recover from it. Then it would be difficult to escape death.

“I can’t continue like this.”

Long Chen felt an unprecedented feeling of danger. He would die if he continued like this.

“Lei Long, help out!” Long Chen shouted inside. As one black sword flew over, Long Chen swung his saber, blocking it. At the same time, a black lightning rune appeared on his left palm. He snatched the sword.

The moment he grabbed the black sword, the void shuddered along with Long Chen’s arm. After that, the flesh of his arm was blown off all the way to the bone.

Countless black runes flowed on top of his bones and then formed chains that bound the black sword to his hand.

In that instant, the will of the Heavenly Daos poured into his mind-sea. The gushing power tried to overwhelm his mind-sea and blow it apart.

But then, the Divine Gate in his mind-sea opened. The Divine Gate Star blazed as if it had been disturbed by the black lightning, and the mysterious energy pouring into his mind-sea was absorbed by it.

At the same time, Long Chen’s FengFu, Alioth, Life Fate, Enlightenment Palace, and Nethergate Stars also lit up. Every star had a black lightning rune appear on top of them.

Following that, six stars appeared behind Long Chen, shattering heaven and earth. An irresistible power then erupted, crushing all the swords in the air.

However, after a single flash, those six stars vanished without a trace. It was as if it was nothing more than an illusion.

As for the black sword, it escaped his hold. Long Chen felt like his body had changed, but he was unable to tell what that change was.

“Lei Long!”

Long Chen suddenly formed hand seals. A whirlpool then appeared on top of his hand.

“Lightning Summoning Art!”

The shattered swords left lightning runes remaining in the air. They were instantly sucked into Long Chen’s lightning whirlpool. At the core, a lightning mark gradually grew brighter.

Suddenly, a heaven-shaking roar rang out. A giant lightning dragon then appeared within the world, emitting endless dragon might.
