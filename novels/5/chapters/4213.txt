Chapter 4202: Brothers Reunite

The Violet Blood race’s Xu family only comprised over twenty thousand people, yet each of them was an elite amongst elites. Enveloped in the aura of violet qi, they exuded an overwhelming presence.

Their group was right beside Long Chen and the others. Seeing them come in such astounding numbers, Xu Xin-er was displeased and directly mocked them.

As for Long Chen’s response, it worsened the conflict. After all, Long Chen had long since made his determination to kill this loathsome woman.

For some reason, Long Chen found himself growing increasingly repulsed by the Xu family. That repulsive feeling didn’t seem to stem purely from Xu Xin-er injuring Bai Xiaole but rather from deep inside his soul or perhaps his blood.

“Big words. Do you think you can bully the Xu family just because you have numbers? You’re too naive. Why don’t you all come at me together? I, Xu Yifeng, will face all of you at once!” sneered the man beside Xu Xin-er.

This man was called Xu Yifeng, and he was even more arrogant than Xu Xin-er. He directly pointed at Long Chen and the others, his eyes full of contempt.

This provocation ignited a burning fury within everyone, causing Guo Ran and the rest of the group to be brimmed with murderous intent. After all, this fresh hostility was heaped upon the previous grudge before it had a chance to be resolved. Did they think that they were easy to bully?

“To dare to provoke my boss, you really don’t know how ‘death’ is written.”

The surroundings brightened a bit, as a large muscular man walked over with a spear on his back.

There wasn’t a single blade of hair growing on his barren head. It was glossy, reflecting the sunlight strongly. Even with countless experts around him, he still stood out like usual.

“Boss Gu Yang!”

The Dragonblood warriors let out a burst of cheers when they saw this bald man. It was Gu Yang.

The current Gu Yang was even more muscular than he was in the three thousand worlds, and he seemed to have grown a bit taller as well. Moreover, his Blood Qi was like an active volcano that would erupt at any moment.

There were runes tattooed all over his neck, face, and arms. Essentially, every bit of his skin that they could see was covered with runes that emitted terrifying fluctuations.

Gu Yang was like a beast in human form. As soon as he appeared, his explosive aura suffocated the people around him.

“Boss, leave this fellow to me. Let me give our brothers some encouragement,” said Gu Yang.

“Gu Yang, that’s wrong. You’re the first captain! You should modestly decline and let your brothers deal with such matters!”

A burst of laughter rang out like thunder as two figures walked over. With every step they took, ripples appeared on the ground, thrumming with the might of the earth.

These two were Li Qi and Song Mingyuan. They had also come at this time. Just like Gu Yang, their faces, necks, and arms were branded with runes.

Seeing them arrive, Long Chen and the others were delighted. They finally met again. To his surprise, Long Chen could sense that the runes on their bodies had the flavor of original Jiuli immortal characters. They clearly had their own fortuitous encounters.

“Greetings, boss!”

They cupped their fists to Long Chen at the same time. The next moment, the three of them exchanged a look and laughed. At least, the brotherly feelings between them were still so strong.

Long Chen also laughed. “Brothers don’t need to be courteous. Today is the reunion of our Dragonblood Legion. It’s time to let our name resound throughout the nine heavens and ten lands!”

“Hahaha!” Gu Yang, Li Qi, and Song Mingyuan laughed heroically, feeling like they had returned to their glory days on the Martial Heaven Continent.

“Boss, don’t you think it’s rude to say that it is a reunion when I’m not there yet?”

Just then, a person appeared with a sword on his back. He didn’t have the slightest aura of a cultivator on him, yet merely gazing upon him sent shivers coursing through the hearts and souls of those who beheld him.

It was like he was a walking sword, and anyone who dared to get close to him would have their souls cut by his sharpness.

“Hahaha, Zifeng, this time, you’re the last one to arrive!” laughed Gu Yang.

“Isn’t that very normal? The first, second, third, and now fourth captains are all here. Arriving fourth is following the order!” laughed Yue Zifeng.

“Damn, you know how to joke now? Hahaha!” Gu Yang and the others laughed. For Yue Zifeng to jest in this manner felt as astonishing as witnessing the sun rise in the west.

“However, I still feel like you look a bit better when you’re not laughing,” chortled Guo Ran.

Yue Zifeng didn’t get angry when he heard this. He just came to Long Chen’s side and cupped his fists. “Boss, this time, let’s kill until the heavens flip.”

“Good! Today, we’re announcing the rise of the Dragonblood Legion to the nine heavens and ten lands! No one can stop our footsteps!” Long Chen was also infected by their emotions.

Before this, he had been thinking about concealing their power. But now, it felt like he had returned to his glory days on the Martial Heaven Continent. That fearless Long Chen had returned.

They had barely gotten to see each other in the three thousand worlds. But now, as they were truly reunited, they vowed to flip this world upside down.

Their excitement at reuniting was so overwhelming that it caused them to momentarily forget about the Xu family's provocation. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

“A group of rabble also dares to spout such big words? How laughable. You can brag until you shake the heavens, but do you dare to actually fight? It’s been a while since I’ve spilled blood. My hands are itching for it,” taunted Xu Yifeng with icy disdain.

Xu Yifeng was angry. As a peak heavenly genius of the Xu family, he had the purest violet blood of his generation. In fact, his bloodline purity had almost regressed to an ancestral state.

This time, the Xu family viewed the title of Sage King as a must-have. But to claim this title, they had to be prepared to defeat experts from the various factions, and Xu Yifeng had to walk a path paved with bones.

In truth, on the way to this star-field, Xu Yifeng and Xu Xin-er had killed countless experts. As a result, the Xu family’s disciples were already quite used to such occurrences.

Actually, upon their arrival at the Sage King Prefecture, they had held themselves back. Otherwise, when Xu Xin-er set her sights on the Violet Pupil Nine Tail Fox, they would have launched an attack without hesitation.

Since that was the case, when Long Chen and the others were viewing them as nothing more than empty air, they were enraged. No one had dared to ignore them like this.

Only then did Long Chen and the others recall that there was the Xu family to deal with. Long Chen turned back to them. At the same time, Luo Bing and Luo Ning couldn’t help becoming a bit nervous.

In truth, they were still hoping for both sides to get along. After all, they were all from the Violet Blood race. There was no need to slaughter each other for such a minor matter.

However, the Xu family persisted in provoking them time and time again, so they also understood Long Chen’s feelings. Despite being fraught with worry, they knew that they couldn’t do anything.

“Are you guys traitors of the Violet Blood race?” asked Long Chen suddenly.

This question made Luo Bing and Luo Ning jump in fright. As for the Xu family’s experts, all their expressions contorted upon hearing this question.

Weapons were swiftly drawn, and a malevolent killing intent surged forth from their ranks.
