Chapter 4537 Yan Baichen

When Yan Baichen vanished, Long Chen jumped as he lost track of his aura.

BOOM!

Just then, Feng You’s golden spear struck the ground beneath Long Chen’s feet, crushing the ground and forcing out a sneaky figure.

“Earth energy!”

Seeing this scene, Long Chen instantly understood. No wonder he suddenly lost track of Yan Baichen. The latter seemed to have merged with the earth, covering his powerful Blood Qi with the energy of the earth. It seemed that he was not a complete fool, as he could catch Long Chen off-guard

Long Chen had anticipated that Yan Baichen would come at him from above, but to his surprise, the latter launched an attack from underground. If it weren’t for Feng You’s intervention, Long Chen would probably have found himself in a precarious situation due to this unexpected assault. This fellow could actually act like a pig to eat the tiger, and his performance was very convincing.

When Feng You forced Yan Baichen out of the ground, all the mixed beast race’s experts entered the combat state. As long as Feng You gave the order, they would attack.

It went without saying that their reaction speed had been tempered through fighting off various powerful enemies over the years, and their ability to ignite fighting spirit in an instant was something extremely rare. Other than the Dragonblood Legion, this was perhaps the army with the greatest killing power that Long Chen had ever seen.

“Yan Baichen, as long as I’m here, I won’t let you touch a single hair on Long Chen’s head. Decide whether you want to fight or not.”

Feng You stood in front of Long Chen, his blonde hair billowing with the wind. She appeared heroic and valiant, exuding indescribable elegance.

Looking at her back, Long Chen smiled. It actually felt quite good to be protected by a woman. Seeing Yan Baichen’s enraged expression, he also felt a wonderful feeling.

From behind Feng You, Long Chen stealthily flashed his middle finger toward Yan Baichen, and his expression was so provoking that it needed a beating.

Yan Baichen quivered with rage, but Feng You was in the way. If he wanted to kill Long Chen, he had to defeat her first.

Against Feng You, Yan Baichen felt helpless. Besides, he didn’t dare to rashly start a war here. If they were to fight here, they would just take huge losses and wouldn’t get anything.

After all, the Fantasy Spirit World and the Void Spirit World were about to open. Everyone wanted to be in their best state before they opened.

“Alright, then we’ll see!” Yan Baichen pointed at Long Chen, his finger quivering with rage. In the end, he clenched his teeth and brought his people away.

Watching as they left, Feng You sighed with relief. In truth, she also didn’t want to fight with this idiot.

After all, they had been fighting too much lately. While they were all the elites of the mixed beast race, they were also extremely weary. What they needed the most was a break. On the other hand, the Black Rock Nine Underworld Pythons seemed to be in their peak condition. If both sides really were to fight, the mixed beast race would definitely be at a disadvantage.

“Let’s go slower,” suggested Long Chen.

Feng You nodded. By going a bit slower, their odds of running into others would drop, and they could avoid another headache like running into another enemy.

In the end, they found a comparatively hidden place to rest, and Long Chen used this chance to refine some medicinal powders with the Earth Cauldron.

Seeing the Earth Cauldron again, Feng You asked, “You know alchemy?”

“It’s just me messing around, dabbling around in various things. After all, the more you know, the more life-saving trump cards you can obtain,” answered Long Chen with a smile, trying to act low key.

In any case, Feng You and the others knew nothing about alchemy. He could just randomly make something up to prevent them from interrogating him.

Long Chen’s primal chaos space was now filled with fully matured medicinal plants. While he couldn’t really refine pills right now, stocking the powders in advance was not a bad idea.

Long Chen didn’t need to refine ordinary medicinal ingredients by himself; Huo Linger and the Earth Cauldron could handle that for him. However, when it came to Saint-level ingredients, he had to assist in the refinement process.

At first, the mixed beast race’s experts just watched with interest as Long Chen started his refinement. However, when they saw him refine a bunch of powders over and over again, they quickly found it to be boring.

Long Chen was not planning on revealing his skill in alchemy to them. This display would make Feng You think that he was a jack of all trades but a master of none. In their minds, Long Chen might not be very powerful, but he had plenty of tricks, and he could rely on those tricks to squeeze into the ranks of experts.

Feng You was already linking this activity to how Long Chen had sneakily used medicinal powder to blind the monkey. Although this kind of trick could not be considered proper, it could sometimes have a marvelous effect.

Just like this, they started to take breaks as they traveled, and each time, Long Chen would refine various medicinal powders in preparation for refining Saint pills.

Three days later, they had to quicken their pace, and on the fifth day, they encountered another squad of the mixed beast race. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

Only then did Long Chen realize that the mixed beast race resembled a crafty rabbit with more than one burrow. It turned out that the mixed beast race had multiple hidden nests.

However, Feng You was definitely the leader of their junior generation. Even in that group with quite a few heavenly geniuses, they were all very respectful toward Feng You.

As expected though, some of them were not so friendly toward Long Chen. While they couldn’t be considered hostile, they still acted coldly toward him. Moreover, when they saw Long Chen and Feng You walking so close, there was a kind of jealousy in their eyes.

Long Chen naturally wouldn’t say anything about those gazes. He had seen such a thing plenty of times. The reason he was sticking around here was for convenience. It would be much more troublesome for him to fly around randomly like a housefly.

Meanwhile, Feng You was quite dense and didn’t seem to sense anything. She continued to talk and laugh with Long Chen. Occasionally, she would ask him about things outside this world, and Long Chen would pick some interesting stories to tell her. She felt them to be very novel.

As they traveled further, more and more experts appeared, causing the mixed beast race to gradually grow tense. They knew that a fight could break out at any moment.

Long Chen saw a group of humans, and they also saw him. However, they didn’t look friendly, and Long Chen only saw iciness in their eyes.

One of them even made a throat-cutting gesture toward him, threatening the mixed beast race to drive Long Chen away as he was an invader.

However, Feng You was stubborn, and in front of their threats, she told them that if they wanted to die, they could just come over and try. In comparison, although some of the mixed beast race’s people disliked Long Chen, they never said anything about driving him away, which made Long Chen feel a bit moved.

As more and more experts emerged, an increasing number of groups started harassing the mixed beast race, with some even silently colluding to join forces for an attack. Just as Feng You was about to slaughter a few people to put them in their place, a sinister gust of wind blew by, and the experts blocking their way fled like they had just seen a ghost.

When Long Chen looked back, he felt a chill and cold sweat instantly dripped down his back.

“Run!”

Feng You’s expression also changed, and she hastily dragged Long Chen away.
