Chapter 2930 A Fight Breaking Out

This place was the entrance to the true inner academy. There was a transportation formation here, but not many people were coming and going from it. When these people saw a group of Mortal Transcendence rookies arrive, they shook their heads inside. They knew that these newcomers were about to face some trouble.

There was a custom within the inner academy, and that was to bully the newcomers. These people had also been bullied when they came in, so as long as they had nothing else to do, causing some trouble for the newcomers was their way to vent.

As for the academy, they pretended not to see this. As long as no one broke the rules of the academy, the disciples could do as they please. Under the glorified name of teaching the newcomers a lesson, they had their arrogance beat out of them. That way, they would be less likely to cause trouble in the inner academy.

Just as the people here were shaking their heads, Long Chen slapped that Four Peak disciple to the ground, causing them to jump.

“There’s going to be a good show this time!”

“Get a good spot, quick!”

“Brother, can you help me out? You’re in the best spot to watch.”

Dozens of people immediately swarmed over excitedly. They knew that many people were going to be arriving soon when this news spread, so they hastily occupied the best spots. Just at this moment, the other Four Peak disciples attacked Long Chen with their fists. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

Long Chen was originally preparing to activate his divine ring, but then he saw that these people were only attacking with their physical power. Although they were angry, they didn’t use their cultivation techniques or magical arts, or even weapons.

Seeing that, he also didn’t activate his divine ring. Instead, his fist smashed into the nose of someone charging at him. With a crunching sound, blood, mucus, and tears flew out of his face.

“New little brothers, don’t worry. It is forbidden to use any magical arts here. You also can’t use weapons. If you want to fight, you can only use your muscles. You won’t be punished for fighting here, so if you don’t like someone, feel free to beat them up,” encouraged one of the spectators upon spotting Li Cai and the others who were hesitating.

Fights often broke out here. The old disciples bullied the new disciples, and the new disciples naturally wouldn’t take that lying down.

However, how could some novices beat these senior disciples? Most fights were over in just a few moves. Then they would be allowed to go check in.

The academy ignored the fighting here as long as both sides followed the rules of not using their magical arts and weapons. As long as no casualties freely occurred, it was fine.

Hearing this, Li Cai and the others immediately charged into battle. Li Cai knocked one senior disciple down with a kick, and before he could get up, another one stamped his foot on his face. The Unfettered Alliance’s disciples collapsed on them, fighting in groups of four or five against one.

As for Long Chen, he knocked down these disciples with a single punch. They were either left with bloody noses, teeth flying out of their mouths, or dislocated jaws. In the blink of an eye, he had knocked down seven of them without any of them being able to touch his clothes.

“Damn, that newcomer’s pretty strong.”

“Every single one of his punches landed perfectly, leading to the next. How does this generation of newcomers have so many demons?”

“Wait, isn’t that fellow familiar? Isn’t that Long Chen?!” As more and more people rushed over, one of them suddenly recognized Long Chen.

“Long Chen? Who’s that?”

“You were in seclusion for half a year, and he joined the academy around three months ago. You naturally don’t know him.”

“Stop shouting. Sit and watch quietly. Don’t ruin other people’s viewing pleasure. If you want to talk, talk spiritually,” said another person irritably.

Just at this moment, a large group containing hundreds of people came out of the gate. They were all wearing guard uniforms.

“Damn, now it’s getting big! The guards were actually disturbed from their drills!”

This large group immediately charged over just as Long Chen knocked down the final Four Peak disciple.

“Bastards! It seems that you newcomers are getting arrogant, huh?! Beat them up!” The guards charged forward furiously.

Just like the ones before, these guards didn’t use their techniques. They only used their fists and feet.

Long Chen felt like these people had to have something wrong with their brains. What was the point of this fight? Vexed, he didn’t bother trying to explain. He simply kicked the one who had taken the lead.

That person was then sent smashing into the people behind him, causing several broken bones. Although Long Chen hadn’t summoned his divine ring or used his astral energy, just his physical body was too powerful for these Four Peak experts to fight him.

“This fellow’s pretty tough! Beat him together!” Those guards immediately focused on him. At the very least, they knew that to capture bandits, the first thing to do was to capture their king.

Seeing this, Long Chen snorted. They wanted to use close-range combat against him? He’d give them a lesson for free today.

Bang!

Crack!

“Aiya!”

“Fuck!”

Long Chen charged through their midst, like a phantom moving through them. Not one person was able to strike him as he attacked them with fists, palms, and claws. Anyone who got close to him simply collapsed with a scream or a painful grunt.

When Long Chen flew through their midst like a tiger amongst sheep, the spectators were dumbfounded. What kind of skill was this?

There was a saying that two fists had difficulty fighting four fists. But even in the midst of this chaos, surrounded by enemies, Long Chen was dominating. Dozens of people were knocked down in just a moment, but he wasn’t even struck once.

While Long Chen was winning, Li Cai and the others were in trouble. Originally, they used numbers to swarm one opponent and were able to win. But now that they were outnumbered, they quickly collapsed.

“Hey, little sister, don’t take out your sword. They don’t dare to touch you, but if you take out your sword, it’ll be troublesome. Also, once you fall to the ground, they won’t touch you. You can just lie down.”

Just as Mu Qingyun was taking out her sword, someone called out to her. Only then did she notice that just as that person said, once a person was on the ground, the other side wouldn’t continue hitting them. They only targeted the people that were still standing. For a moment, Mu Qingyun, Zhong Ling, Zhong Xiu, and the other female members of the Unfettered Alliance were lost.

No one attacked them, but they also couldn’t just watch as Li Cai and the others were knocked down. However, did the guys really want them to go fighting with their fists?

Just as they were hesitating, the rest of the Unfettered Alliance was knocked down. Their attackers then eyed Mu Qingyun and the others for just a moment before snorting and charging at Long Chen.

At that moment, another flying boat descended, and a group of people walked out. Their leaders were Luo Bing and Luo Ning. As soon as they walked out, they saw Long Chen fighting a giant group, so they were dumbfounded.

“What is going on here?”
