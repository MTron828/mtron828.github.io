Chapter 4552 Once More Seeing the Golden Crow Race

“What is it?” Seeing Long Chen’s sudden joy, Feng You couldn’t help but ask curiously.

“I can sense my brothers. They’re in that direction.” Long Chen pointed at the Void Spirit World’s entrance.

Although they had only been apart for a short while, Long Chen already missed them. After all, this world was far too dangerous.

However, while he could sense them, based on the rate of flashing on his jade plate, they were still far away. Long Chen knew that he couldn’t reach them with his transportation formation.

Long Chen didn’t know the situation on their side, but with Guo Ran and Xia Chen’s power, gathering the Dragonblood Legion shouldn’t be a problem.

Furthermore, with Guo Ran’s character, he wouldn’t charge right to the front of the gate, as that would only turn them into everyone’s target. He wouldn’t make such a stupid mistake. Although Guo Ran liked to slack off at cultivation, when it came to directing the Dragonblood Legion, he was an outstanding leader.

Since Long Chen’s jade plate was blinking, Guo Ran had to be able to sense him as well. Although they were separated, they knew each other’s general location, which provided both of them with comfort.

Long Chen suppressed his excitement for now. He then taught everyone the proper way to use the bombs to prevent something unwanted from happening.

Armed with those bombs, the mixed beast race’s experts felt immense confidence. After all, these things were incredibly powerful.

After taking over the Blood race’s territory, they saw a group of black-robed experts with golden flames around them.

“The Golden Crow race?”

Long Chen instantly recognized them after seeing the Golden Crow Flame, a flame capable of giving rise to the Sun Flame.

Though they only numbered a few hundred thousand people, they occupied an extremely large area for themselves, and no one dared to approach them.

Feng You’s expression grew serious upon seeing them. She stealthily told Long Chen, “The Golden Crow race is extremely powerful. It’s not a good idea to antagonize them, so how about we go around?”

After obtaining her ancestor’s inheritance, Feng You didn’t fear anyone. However, she wasn’t alone here. She had to lead the entire mixed beast race.

Moreover, the Golden Crow race was always domineering and didn’t submit to anyone. There was no way to obtain their territory without a direct clash.

If they were to fight, ignoring whether or not they could win, the results of such a clash would wipe out at least half of the mixed beast race here, and that was a conservative estimate. Such a loss was unacceptable for Feng You.

On the surface, everyone was competing for territory here. However, in truth, they were fighting over priority to enter the gate, so everyone wanted to get to the front. But they also wanted to do so without paying a heavy price. Everyone simply wanted to show off their power and make others afraid of them so that they would get out of the way.

However, against the Golden Crow race, no way that would work. There were even stronger factions up ahead. If they were to fight the Golden Crow race, they wouldn’t be able to accept the losses. But if they were to go around, it would impact the mixed beast race’s morale. Feng You was unable to come up with any good ideas immediately.

Observing the Golden Crow race, Long Chen had to admit that they were truly powerful. The Blood race and the Blood Gauze Sect’s people wouldn’t be able to even shake them.

Long Chen didn’t know why enormous factions like the Blood race, devil race, and Blood Gauze Sect would stay separated. Why did they not gather all their forces so that they could occupy better territory?

Long Chen suddenly had a thought. This was the principle of not placing all eggs in one basket. If that one basket dropped, all the eggs would shatter.

They were afraid of engaging in a bloody clash with some supreme force. If things were to go south, they wouldn’t be able to recover.

Thus, all the top factions spread their forces so that losing one or two groups wouldn’t affect their overall power. This was one of the secret conventions that the major factions abided by.

Long Chen also realized at this point that the top experts of these factions were definitely leading squads on their own to enter the gate first. In other words, the top experts up ahead would be even stronger.

“Long Chen, what do we do? Say something.”

Feng You looked at Long Chen anxiously. Her head was completely blank, and she couldn’t think of any idea.

“Ahead of the Golden Crow race is our old opponent, the desolate beast race. Their leaders are still that group of golden monkeys. Enemies really do meet often,” said Long Chen as he looked further and saw a group of giant desolate beasts with small monkeys jumping around them.

“So then what? Are we going around? The Golden Fur Heaven Merging Monkey race has far too many experts. If we were to attack the Golden Crow race, they might take advantage of the situation and sneak attack us,” said Feng You, startled. She hadn’t realized that there were even more enemies in front of the Golden Crow race. Hence, she couldn’t help being shocked when she saw the numbers of the desolate beast race.

The Golden Fur Heaven Merging Monkey race was the king of the desolate beasts, having the ability to order all desolate beasts. Last time, the desolate beast race’s sneak attack had been a hasty attack to wipe out the injured mixed beast race, which meant that they hadn’t brought out their whole army. Their actual power was actually greater as they had many races amongst them.

The proof was the desolate beasts here. They were all elites amongst elites with terrifying power, particularly the golden monkeys.

Feng You was worried about her people. If all that remained of the mixed beast race was herself, that would be the worst-case scenario. If that were to happen, it would be meaningless even if she could kill more enemies.

Long Chen looked at those resting desolate beasts and suddenly clapped, a sinister smile appearing on his face.

“Don’t move. Leave things to me.” Long Chen had everyone rest here and went toward the Golden Crow race alone.

“Long Chen!” Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

Feng You jumped in fright. Seeing him go toward the Golden Crow race so nonchalantly, she knew that a single attack would directly kill him. She wanted to follow him, but Long Chen just waved his hand, telling her not to.

Feng You and the rest of the mixed beast race’s experts were extremely worried, staring at Long Chen’s back anxiously.

When Long Chen arrived at the Golden Crow race’s territory, the Golden Crow race’s experts instantly tensed, pointing their cold weapons at Long Chen. However, since Long Chen didn’t release any aura, they didn’t immediately attack. Someone then shouted at him to stop.

However, Long Chen didn’t reply and just tossed something at them. When that person caught it, his expression instantly changed, and he ran deeper into their camp.

Very quickly, seven experts of the Golden Crow race walked out. When those seven experts appeared, the mixed beast race’s experts were shocked as all seven were on the same level as Feng You.

The seven of them exchanged some words with Long Chen. Very quickly, they turned toward Feng You and the others, nodding.

Following that, Long Chen beckoned toward the mixed beast race. When they came over, amazingly, the Golden Crow race’s camp actually split open, forming a path for them.
