Chapter 4871 This Firecracker Really is Loud

A total of nine people had come, flame marks on their robes indicating they were from the Flame Divine Hall. However, their robes were different from those of Jiang Yiban and the others, as they lacked any inscribed runes.

These nine were powerful Nine Star Doyens. The air twisted around them, and waves of heat made it feel like everyone was standing in a furnace.

Their leader, a fair-faced young man with a word on his back, swaggered over to Long Chen with a sinister expression.

“Long Chen, I thought that you would keep hiding forever. Who would have thought that you had the bravery to come to my Cao family’s territory? Your guts aren’t small!”

At first, Long Chen’s attention was on the stone. However, seeing these nine people, he suddenly smiled and pushed the rock toward the old shopkeeper.

Having a bad feeling, the old shopkeeper retreated a few steps. While he didn’t know Long Chen and Mo Nian, he recognized the robes of the Flame Divine Hall—an existence that he couldn’t offend.

“You are Cao Yuyang who sent the challenge letter?” asked Long Chen.

That man laughed. “You received the challenge letter? Hahaha, how did it taste? In truth, that letter was from my famil—”

“I don’t care. Just answer me, are you Cao Yuyang? Are you the one who sent the letter?” Long Chen impatiently interrupted him.

“Yes, I am Cao Yuyang. That challenge letter was sent on behalf of my family’s young master—”

“Then there’s no mistaking it?” Long Chen glanced at Mo Nian.

“What are you waiting for?” responded Mo Nian.

Pow!

Long Chen struck as quick as lightning, slapping Cao Yuyang across the face. At such close range, he had no chance to react.

It was forbidden to fight in Devil Fall City. Even as the son of the leader of one of the four noble families, Cao Yuyang had to abide by that rule. But unexpectedly, Long Chen directly attacked him.

Cao Yuyang was stunned by the slap. Long Chen had held back as he was afraid of killing this bastard in one slap. Taking advantage of Cao Yuyang’s shock, Long Chen grabbed his hair and then seized his jaw with his other hand, pulling it down forcefully.

Cao Yuyang’s jaw dislocated, causing his mouth to open wide.

“Be gentler. You might tear off his jaw,” scolded Mo Nian. He reached out and stuffed a sphere in Cao Yuyang’s mouth.

Seeing that sphere, Yu Tong covered her mouth. It was the sphere that Mo Nian had compressed Cao Yuyang’s exploding letter into.

Long Chen slammed Cao Yuyang’s mouth shut, while Mo Nian took out a talisman and used it to seal his mouth. The talisman instantly dissolved into a sealing character.

Long Chen and Mo Nian then dragged Yu Tong and Yu Fei to the side, covering their ears as they started counting down together.

“Three.”

“Two.”

Cao Yuyang had yet to recover from the shock of being slapped before Long Chen and Mo Nian finished their actions. Meanwhile, the other disciples of the Flame Divine Hall had taken out their weapons but were unsure whether they were supposed to attack or what.

“One.”

BOOM!

Cao Yuyang’s head exploded, and blood rained down, leaving the disciples of the Flame Divine Hall splattered by it and completely stupefied.

Originally, Cao Yuyang and the others had arrived with great confidence and attention. However, they didn’t even get to say much before Long Chen and Mo Nian made their move, directly killing Cao Yuyang. They had not just attacked someone inside Devil Fall City, but they had also killed the son of one of the four noble families’ leaders.

“Damn, this firecracker is really loud!”

When Mo Nian and Long Chen lowered the hands that covered their ears, Cao Yuyang’s corpse slowly collapsed to the ground, raising a puff of dust. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

“When you try to hurt others, you are hurting yourself. If you weren’t so malicious, placing spiritual fire into these flames, you would have only been injured, not dead.” Long Chen shrugged at Cao Yuyang’s corpse.

Actually, Long Chen hadn’t expected Cao Yuyang to die because he hadn’t known that these flames contained spiritual fire. After all, Mo Nian had sealed them himself, using a method unfamiliar to Long Chen.

One of those Flame Divine Hall disciples roared, “How dare you kill someone from the Flame Divine Hall?! You—”

Holding a strange weapon, Mo Nian waved his hand. In an instant, a flash of divine light streaked through the air, and eight heads flew off their bodies. The action was so swift that even Long Chen couldn't discern what weapon Mo Nian wielded.

“If you’re going to be so angry about it, you can accompany him,” said Mo Nian indifferently.

Everyone around them was stunned, staring at Long Chen and Mo Nian like they were monsters. Even Yu Tong and Yu Fei were baffled. After all, they normally saw Mo Nian laughing like he would never get angry in this lifetime. However, he had killed those people without batting an eye.

Long Chen waved his hand, dissipating the bloody air around them. He then turned to the shopkeeper and asked, “Shopkeeper, how much for this stone?”

Right after he said this, eight heads and bodies fell to the ground behind him. Seeing this scene, the shopkeeper was green with terror.

“No, no, it’s free! You can take it!” replied the shopkeeper with a hoarse voice. He directly gave Long Chen the rock and then waved his hand, putting away everything else on the table and fleeing.

“I’m buying, not robbing,” remarked Long Chen. After putting the rock, he waved his hand, sending a small bag flying to the elder.

After catching it, the elder didn’t even examine it or thank him. He simply vanished without a trace.

When Long Chen looked back, he saw that the other vendors were putting away their wares as well. Long Chen hastily said, “Hey, everyone, there’s no need to be so nervous. Don’t leave. We still want to buy some things.”

“How dare you kill my son?! I’ll kill you!” Just then, a furious roar erupted, and Cao Guofeng came charging in like an angry lion. He directly attacked, swinging a blood-colored broadsword at Long Chen.

BOOM!

Unexpectedly, a large figure appeared in front of Long Chen and punched the broadsword. Due to the collision, a qi wave exploded, and Cao Guofeng spat out blood, flying back.

“City Lord!” Startled cries rang out. The spectators didn’t dare to believe it. City Lord Xing Wujiang had personally emerged to protect Long Chen and the others.

“Xing Wujiang, I don’t care who you are! If you’re still going to protect Long Chen, I’ll bring you down with everything I have!”

Cao Guofeng seemed to have gone insane with grief over his son. His blood seemed to ignite, and flames wrapped around him.

“Cao Guofeng really is going for broke!” The crowd was shocked to see Cao Guofeng igniting his own essence blood to temporarily boost his power. After all, to use this move at his age, he had to pay a great price.

“As long as I, Xing Wujiang, am present, no one can harm a single hair on my brothers’ heads. You aren’t a match for me, so I’d advise you to endure it,” remarked Xing Wujiang as he clasped his hands behind his back, looking at Cao Guofeng indifferently.

“What if you have to face all of us?” Three voices rang out at the same time, causing the entire Devil Fall City to tremble.

“The four noble families are targeting the City Lord together?!”

The shocking and sudden turn of events dumbfounded everyone in Devil Fall City.
