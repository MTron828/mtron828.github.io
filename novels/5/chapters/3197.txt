Chapter 3186 Sudden Attack

Long Chen’s body was covered in golden dragon scales. He had finally condensed the Golden Dragon Battle Armor. However, his newly condensed dragon scales were still very tender. They would only strengthen after a bit of time.

Due to their tender state, he was unable to place his divine flames on them. Despite that, he felt completely transformed. Even without the Golden Dragon Battle Armor active, his physical body was capable of using the power of his divine flames.

Previously, he was barely able to use the power of his divine flames even with the help of the Azure Dragon Battle Armor. But it was different now. His physical body was many times stronger than before. Even now, as the dragon blood circulated in his body, it was still strengthening.

Just at this moment, Long Chen’s tablet began to flash rapidly. He heard the sound of the alarm in the distance.

“Someone’s attacking the High Firmament Academy!”

Long Chen’s expression changed. He took out his black robes and rushed off with his lightning wings.

“Trash of the High Firmament Academy, face your deaths!”

Countless experts wearing black cloaks and masks covering their faces were assaulting the outer academy.

The outer academy had been turned into ruins. The descent of hundreds of Divine Lords instantly smashed through the barrier.

The outer academy’s disciples didn’t even have a chance to react before being blasted apart. Screams rang throughout the outer academy.

“Kill!”

Millions of those black-cloaked figures poured throughout the outer academy. They were all Four Peak experts being led by the Divine Lords.

This attack came all too suddenly. From the moment the alarm rang to the barrier was destroyed, only an instant had passed. Their enemies had clearly come prepared.

“Brazen interlopers, do you still want to live after coming here?!” The High Firmament Academy’s experts rapidly mobilized and came out of the inner academy.

These attackers had destroyed all the transportation formations. They were somehow perfectly aware of where the academy’s transportation formations were.

“Hand over Long Chen, or countless people from the High Firmament Academy will be implicated. Don’t blame others!”

A Divine Lord roared. But suddenly, the void shuddered and a golden fist smashed down.

That Divine Lord directly exploded. After that, Long Chen’s figure appeared, drawing out a wave of cheers.

“It’s Heaven Master Long Chen!”

Long Chen was shocked and enraged when he saw what was before him. Many of the auras here were familiar to him. Just based on the fluctuations of their cultivation techniques, he could tell that these people were those experts that had fought against him at the end of the Nine Prefecture Convention.

After killing so many of those Divine Lords, he was familiar with the remainders’ fluctuations.

“Everyone, retreat back to the inner academy! Experts, first protect the outer academy’s disciples!”

Long Chen’s voice resounded through the air. There were too many enemies, and everything was chaotic. There was no way to unleash any big moves like this, as it would only harm their own people. The first thing was to get the outer academy’s disciples away from here.

“Keep acting hypocritical. This was all caused by you, yet you act like a savior. You, Long Chen, are a star of disaster. All these people died because of you,” sneered a Divine Lord.

“Die!”

Long Chen furiously charged toward him like a bolt of lightning.

In the face of that, the Divine Lord sneered fearlessly. “You, Long Chen, are the world’s most shameless person. You wish to be called a hero yet act like a coward. You should never have been born into this world.”

“Ignorant fool, go repent in hell.” Long Chen’s black saber appeared in his right hand.

However, he didn’t use it. Just when he got close to this person, a lightning spear appeared in his left hand, and he stabbed that person through. Meanwhile, his saber swung to the side.

BOOM!

The void exploded and a blood-colored dagger appeared where Long Chen slashed. A figure popped out and struck his saber with a dagger. As a result, Long Chen was unable to keep hold of his saber and it was blown out of his hand.

At the same time, Long Chen’s lightning spear stabbed through that confident Divine Lord, wiping him out.

“Did you think that an assassin could save your life?” Long Chen snorted and grabbed his flying saber. He then pointed it at that masked assassin. “Dog of the Bloodkill Hall, who gave you the guts to dare to come to my High Firmament Academy?”

No matter how marvelous this person’s concealing arts were, they couldn’t conceal themselves from Long Chen. His senses toward the Bloodkill Hall’s experts were especially honed.

That Divine Lord had intentionally baited Long Chen over, thinking that the assassin could kill him. Unfortunately, he had miscalculated.

The assassin snorted. Suddenly, his Blood Qi erupted and a divine statue appeared behind him. Divine energy flowed out, freezing this space.

“A Primal?”

Long Chen was startled. This assassin was actually a Primal Divine Lord. Long Chen instantly thought of a certain possibility.

With no time to overthink, Long Chen’s divine ring appeared behind him, and his star diagram flowed. When the 108,000 divine flames on his stars blazed, his saber slashed out.

BOOM!

Qi waves clashed, and they made Long Chen’s arm shudder. This Primal of the Bloodkill Hall actually possessed terrifying power.

That one exchange made his expression grave. This person should be considered a completely different existence than an ordinary Divine Lord. His attacks were backed by the laws of the Heavenly Daos.

This Primal could borrow the power of heaven and earth to fight. On the other hand, Long Chen was merely in the Divine Flame realm. He had to suffer from a severe realm suppression that was only exacerbated by the power of the world.

After a slash with his saber, his lightning spear appeared and swung behind him. Another dagger appeared, shattering his lightning spear and piercing toward his chest.

Just then, the void to the left of Long Chen collapsed, and another dagger silently stabbed toward Long Chen like a viper’s fang.

There wasn’t just one Primal Divine Lord from the Bloodkill Hall, but three. The three of them had set up a trap just for him.

Seeing this, Long Chen snorted and swung his saber to block that killing blow. A flame lotus mark appeared on his left hand. He was prepared to exchange injury for injury. As long as he didn’t die in one blow, he could instantly heal. If he managed to kill one in exchange, it would be much easier to handle the remaining two.

However, even before he could react, a golden sword slashed through the air. That sharp Sword Qi made people’s souls shake.
