Chapter 1937: 1937

Lei Long roared, unleashing an attack . A giant lightning sphere shot out of its mouth and then exploded in the air . It transformed into lightning swords that slew the lightning beasts .

These lightning beasts were nothing to Lei Long . Because they came from the same source, the divine lightning that Lei Long had absorbed made its thunderforce far stronger than these lightning beasts .

In a competition of power against power, Lei Long was like a tempered blade, while these lightning beasts were like cabbages . There was a qualitative difference between the two of them .

The Dragonblood warriors might be having some trouble with these lightning beasts, but they were easy to handle for Lei Long .

The Dragonblood warriors were delighted by this help . They focused the majority of their attention on merging their two Life Star Beads . Being distracted was troublesome, and this help lifted quite a bit of pressure off of them, so they could now focus on their Life Star Beads .

Lei Long once more roared, and a giant arc of lightning shot out, forming a wave that slaughtered the lightning beasts . They were instantly shattered into lightning runes . That was a shocking sight .

The original devil race’s disciples were stunned by the lightning dragon that Long Chen had summoned . The method that the Dragonblood Legion used to undergo tribulation was shocking .

“It seems my worries were for nothing,” said Yue Xihan .

“You can’t be too sure of that . Long Chen is daring, but when the blood gets to his head, he might not think of certain details . Being careful is still best,” said one of the Elders .

Time passed bit by bit . A willow image appeared amongst the Dragonblood Legion for a moment, but then it vanished .

Liu Ruyan had been using her human form to undergo this tribulation, but for some reason, she had suddenly manifested her true body for a moment before withdrawing it .

“This genius of the Undying Willow race has broken through,” said Yue Xihan, looking at Liu Ruyan .

“The Undying Willow is a very strong race . I didn’t expect them to actually appear on the Martial Heaven Continent and join the Dragonblood Legion,” said one of the Elders .

“This is Long Chen’s charisma . He’s able to make his followers follow him unto death . Their devotion is so great that it even looks a bit foolish, but this is the human heart . He is willing to risk his life for others, so others will risk their lives for him . That’s why the Dragonblood Legion’s power, unity, and fearlessness have resounded throughout the Martial Heaven Continent . Even his enemies have no choice but to admit that the Dragonblood Legion is the continent’s number one legion . The only inexplicable thing is the legend about the nine star heirs . They are supposed to be aloof, lonely figures who go against the world on their own . If Long Chen didn’t possess the Nine Star Hegemon Body Art, I’d suspect that he wasn’t a nine star heir,” said Yue Xihan . Long Chen’s existence didn’t quite match the records written by her race .

Rumbling rang out and the world suddenly became multicolored .

“It’s the five-colored tribulation lightning!” exclaimed an Elder .

“Troublesome . The Dragonblood Legion has yet to fully merge their two Life Star Beads,” said a worried Elder .

“It’s still fine . Long Chen’s expression is still calm . He probably came prepared,” said Yue Xihan .

The five-colored tribulation lightning crashed down like a flood . One after another giant lightning beasts came down, each larger than a mountain . They charged out of the five-colored lightning and at the Dragonblood Legion .

These lightning beasts condensed of five-colored lightning were incredibly powerful . Just their roars caused people’s souls to shake .

They possessed immense heavenly might, which was the will of the Heavenly Daos, making it so others wouldn’t even dare to resist . Even the Netherpassage experts were feeling fear now . This kind of terrifying heavenly tribulation was something that they didn’t want to touch .

They had originally come to prepare a grand formation that could unite their force, so that if something unexpected happened to Long Chen and the others, they could transport them back to the Skyscraping World . That way, the lightning tribulation of the Martial Heaven Continent would vanish . This was a way of tricking the heavens .

However, if they wanted to do this, they would have to wait until the Dragonblood warriors finished merging their Life Star Beads, or they would never be able to advance to Life Star .

The Dragonblood warriors were at a critical moment, but now this five-colored lightning came crashing down on them . That had surpassed the limits of what the original devil race could possibly control . If they tried to interfere, their lives would be in danger .

The only thing that gave them the slightest bit of comfort was that Long Chen wasn’t panicking at all as he was immersed in the five-colored lightning . He allowed it to wash over him, drinking it in . As for the Dragonblood warriors, they actually didn’t show any fear in the face of this heavenly might . They were completely focused on merging their Life Star Beads .

This heavenly might didn’t give them much pressure . They had been going against this kind of heavenly might since they had known Long Chen, and they already possessed a certain resistance to it . This allowed the Dragonblood warriors to continuously maintain their calm . 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Lei Long suddenly roared, transforming into a giant . Shockingly, this giant was an image of Long Chen .

“This is...” The original devil race’s experts’ pupils shrank .

This lightning giant version of Long Chen stabbed a spear through the air, tearing through the void . A five-colored lightning beast was instantly pierced through .

However, the lightning spear didn’t stop at all . It continued, killing all the lightning beasts in its path .

“Nice, Lei Long . ” Long Chen smiled . Lei Long had a lightning spear in hand and giant lightning wings on its back . That was Long Chen’s peak combat state .

In the lightning field, Long Chen had made Lei Long learn the Sundering Lightning Heavenly Wings and the Wild Lightning Soul Battle Spear, as well as told it to teach him once it mastered those techniques .

In truth, Lei Long was able to display these lightning paragon arts on its own . However, without Long Chen’s cooperation, it couldn’t connect to the lightning field, causing their power to sharply drop .

However, now Lei Long was using the power of divine lightning against these five-colored lightning beasts . These five-colored lightning beasts were fundamentally unable to block it .

Just as Long Chen was praising Lei Long, a small flame dragon flew around Long Chen’s neck and rubbed Long Chen’s cheek .

“Haha, you’re also amazing . You’re both amazing . ” Long Chen rubbed Huo Long with his hand, comforting this jealous little fellow .

Huo Long was also powerful, but Long Chen only had alchemy arts in his Pill Sovereign memories . His flame control arts were all for refining pills, not fighting with flames .

He had to admit that when it came to fighting with flames, he was slightly inferior to Huo Lieyun . It seemed that he would need to learn more flame arts in the future . After all, the heir of a Pill Sovereign couldn’t be lacking such skills .

Huo Long was like a spoiled child curling around Long Chen’s neck to show its own existence .

Long Chen comforted Huo Long as he watched Lei Long fight . The giant that Lei Long had transformed into was slaughtering the five-colored lightning beasts . They were transforming into runes that the Dragonblood Legion was absorbing .

“Boss is mighty, Lei Long is domineering!”

The Dragonblood warriors cheered . The five-colored lightning runes were many times purer than the previous runes . They could now focus on absorbing the energy of this lightning to merge their two Life Star Beads . The five-colored lightning runes were rapidly speeding up this process .

“That lightning dragon actually possesses divine power . It’s inconceivable,” said Yue Xihan, looking at the lightning giant .

Perhaps others weren’t able to sense it, but she was clearly able to sense a divine attribute to it . Although it was very weak, she couldn’t be wrong .

“Hahaha... I’m the first!” Gu Yang let out a heaven-shaking roar . He hadn’t managed to win any face against the Devil Blood Pool, but now he was first to break through . He had to take back his first place spot . After all, he was the Dragonblood Legion’s first captain .

“You’re second . ” Liu Ruyan glanced indifferently at Gu Yang .

“I... fuck!”

Only then did Gu Yang notice that Liu Ruyan had completed her advancement . Her hands were now on Chu Yao’s back, and she was helping her merge her Life Star Beads .

“If big sister Meng Qi didn’t lend a portion of her Spiritual Strength to you, let alone being first, you might not even be able to merge them . ” Liu Ruyan shook her head .

Gu Yang’s Spiritual Strength was extremely weak, and although it had grown stronger upon reaching the Soul Transformation realm and condensing a Yuan Spirit, he was still at the bottom of the Dragonblood Legion . He was even worse than Guo Ran .

It was Meng Qi who lent her Spiritual Strength to Gu Yang so that he would have enough Spiritual Strength to merge his two Life Star Beads .

“Cough, if you always talk like this, you won’t have any friends in the future . ” Gu Yang’s face was a bit red as he awkwardly rubbed his head . Liu Ruyan really wasn’t giving him any face .

Liu Ruyan didn’t pay him any more attention and focused on helping Chu Yao . Other than Chu Yao, Liu Ruyan didn’t like talking to others . Everyone was already used to it .

“Well, I can’t help anyone, so I’ll go kill those lightning beasts . ” Feeling like he had lost face, Gu Yang hastily found an excuse to get out of this awkward position .

Lei Long was easily slaying the lightning beasts, however, when Gu Yang joined in, he had some difficulty . Even going all out, it took over ten blows to kill one .

“What the, how are they so strong?” Gu Yang was startled . Without the power of divine lightning, he had no innate advantage over these lightning beasts .

Following Gu Yang, Meng Qi also finished the merger . Although she had lent some of her Spiritual Strength, she had so much that she was able to finish very quickly .

Following which, Yue Zifeng, Yue Xiaoqian, Tang Wan-er, and the others also finished and joined the battle .

“Boss, I feel like I...” Guo Ran sent a message to Long Chen . He clearly couldn’t last much longer .

“Stop finding excuses . If you need someone else to help you, your previous display at the Devil Blood Pool would be a lie,” replied Long Chen .

“Alright, I’ll persevere . ”

Thinking of how glorious he had been at that time, he couldn’t get himself exposed now . Clenching his teeth, Guo Ran continued with the merger of his Life Star Beads .

More and more Dragonblood warriors managed to finish and join the battle . Hence, Yue Xihan and the others felt a weight fall from their minds . At this time, the Dragonblood warriors were absorbing the energy of the five-colored lightning to expand their astral spaces and make them stronger . This was the best time to condense strong astral spaces .

However, Long Chen’s next words astonished them .

“Everyone, stop absorbing the tribulation lightning’s energy, and definitely don’t condense your astral space yet . Wait for everyone to finish the merger . Then we’ll proceed with the next step!”
