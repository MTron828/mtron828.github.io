Chapter 2758 Familiar Faces

The one speaking was Long Chen’s mother. Even they were sent here from the Wine God Palace and protected.

“Big brother!”

Long Xiaoyu shouted excitedly. Through the barrier of light, she could clearly see what was happening outside. Even non-cultivators could see it because this was the center of the Martial Heaven Continent. From here, they could see everything on the continent.

Long Xiaoyu instantly saw Long Chen chasing after Ye Ming who was fleeing desperately.

Within the Wine God Palace, she couldn’t get any news about how Long Chen was doing. Even in the capital of Grand Xia, people were only talking about things in the past.

Long Xiaoyu had no idea what was happening in the outside world. Hence, seeing Long Chen appearing so mighty, rather than worried, she felt excited.

She had once more grown taller. Although she had Mrs. Long’s gentle and refined face, her eyes sold out the inner minx inside of her.

Seeing her big brother fighting against these devils, she began to cheer as encouragement. Her naive and innocent self had no idea just how dangerous this battle was.

Mrs. Long quivered fiercely in terror as she watched this battle. Long Tianxiao then decided to place his hand on her neck, and she fell unconscious. He looked up to the sky. Seeing that unbeatable figure, he sighed inside. That little child who had only reached his knees back then had become this world’s hegemon.

Hence, Long Tianxiao was filled with pride. He had a certain understanding of this dark era. He knew that there was no retreat, so they could only choose to fight. All he could do was believe in his son.

All the weaker members of the Martial Heaven Continent had been transported here, and many people were staring blankly. Some were also terrified out of their minds.

“Your Majesty!”

There was a group of people around a man with an imperial crown on his head. That man stared at a certain woman, his body quivering.

“Big sister, we finally meet again after so many years.”

This man was the former seventh prince of the Phoenix Cry Empire, Chu Yao’s little brother. He had since taken the throne, becoming the emperor of the Phoenix Cry Empire, while Chu Yao had set foot into the path of cultivation. Years had passed since then. Due to the separation of the Martial Heaven Sea-Ring, those in the Phoenix Cry Empire weren’t able to even know what was happening in the Central Plains.

Tears involuntarily filled his eyes. Although he was the respected master of an empire, in his heart, there was only one person he considered family.

Shi Feng, fatty Yu, Shou Hou. Long Chen’s old companions from the Imperial College had now settled down and established themselves. They had been granted their own Marquisdom or minister positions, helping the current emperor.

When they saw Long Chen, their memories surfaced along with various emotions. Back then, Long Chen had pursued the martial path and could not stay in the Phoenix Cry Empire. Now, he stood at the very peak and was practically a god-like existence.

“I wonder if big brother Long Chen still remembers us?” wondered Shou Hou.

“Long Chen will always be Long Chen. He definitely still remembers us,” said Shi Feng. He had had the best relationship with Long Chen back then. He trusted him.

Countless people from the Phoenix Cry Empire recognized Long Chen. They stared in shock, unable to believe that Long Chen had now become such an existence.

“The dragon may be born in the depths, but it will one day soar into the heavens. No one can block the light of the sun. From the start, I knew that Long Chen would reach this step.”

An elegant woman in a white dress stared at Long Chen, her eyes reddened without her being aware of it. She was Shui Wuhen. Back then, Long Chen had been under her administration and caused her quite a bit of trouble, causing her to both love and hate him.

Ouyang Qiuyang nodded. “Yes. His light was fated to shine throughout the entire world. We could only bear witness to his growth. That is already an honor.”

Shui Wuhen agreed. She wiped away some tears that had at some point started flowing. Perhaps this troublesome little fellow had always been in her heart.

No one was aware of it, but deep within a crowd, a tall, tan woman clad in beast furs was covering her mouth in shock.

“Mom, why are you crying?” asked a boy who appeared only six or seven years old. He held her hand tightly. “Mom, are you afraid? Don’t worry, I’ll definitely protect you! I’ll be just like… that black-robed uncle right there!”

The boy pointed up at Long Chen. Perhaps in his eyes, on this entire battlefield, Long Chen was the most amazing character.

“Your mom has seen two real men in her life. One has already become an unrivaled hero. The second one is you. I believe you will definitely become just like him in the future,” said the woman, smiling and wiping away her tears.

This woman was the one who had saved Long Chen when he had fallen unconscious after Marquis Ying had hunted him down. She had brought him to a village and pleaded for the forest divinity to heal him. Her name was Xiao Hua.

Their villagers had also been brought here by the Martial Heaven Continent. This was the continent final protection for them. Otherwise, when the battle started, the land would be torn apart, and it was unknown just how many of these commoners would be able to survive.

Long Chen chased down Ye Ming. In order to stall, the Undying race’s Saints charged at Long Chen one after another, using suicidal moves just to buy some time.

“After becoming a Sovereign, you’re still beaten like a dog. Your Undying race can just die,” sneered the Kunpeng Emperor.

On the battlefield that spanned across the continent, the Dragonblood Legion had split up. Wilde, Mo Nian, and Ye Zhiqiu each led a group to stop the demonic beast race, the Blood race, and the devil race.

The three of them had supreme divine items, and their attacks caused their opponents to immediately collapse in droves. However, the Kunpeng Emperor and the others didn’t seem to care, nor did they personally take action. They just watched.

Meng Qi, Chu Yao, Tang Wan-er, Dong Mingyu, Cloud, Liu Ruyan, and the others stood guard over the Corrupt God Cemetery. With Liu Ruyan’s large range of attacks, they were able to block this path shut. Not one managed to get by. However, their numbers were truly endless.

Just as they were starting to get overwhelmed, Beitang Rushuang, Nangong Zuiyue, Ximen Tianxiong, and the others came to support them, bringing their own forces.

BOOM!

Suddenly, the void exploded and a figure came flying out, coughing up blood.

“Zifeng!”

Meng Qi and the others cried out. Yue Zifeng had lasted three hundred exchanges against Gui Si, forcing the latter to take a defensive position. He had managed to stall for Long Chen but was unable to beat Gui Si. Eventually, Gui Si found an opportunity to counterattack and injure him.

“Die.” Gui Si snorted and his hand reached toward Yue Zifeng.

However, his hand had just reached out when the void was sliced apart. A sword appeared, slashing onto that withered hand and cutting his entire hand apart.

“It’s not so easy to kill my apprentice.” A white-robed Ling Yunzi appeared, standing before Yue Zifeng like an immortal king.
