Chapter 946 Kings Descend

Translator: BornToBe

Those crazily cursing experts received a blow from some unknown energy, and their heads exploded.

The Spiritual Strength contained in Long Chen’s roar had followed their voices back to the source. Those people in the midst of shouting were instantly locked down by his Spiritual Strength.

In truth, the majority of those people shouting belonged to the Remote Heaven Gang. They had simply hidden themselves in the crowd to control the atmosphere.

As a result, over a thousand people were killed. Those people didn’t have high cultivation bases. They had mostly been at the Xiantian realm or below, and they were simply shouting for effect.

“Long Chen, you demon, this merciless slaughtering of the Righteous path just further proves that you need to be put down!” shouted the Remote Heaven Gang’s patriarch. A war flag appeared in his hands, and that flag had the immortal character for Remote on it.

That was the Remote Heaven Gang’s top treasure. Its history could be traced back to the ancient era. The reason the Remote Heaven Gang was called that was precisely because of this flag.

The Remote Heaven Flag flapped. Heaven and earth changed color as a powerful pressure descended upon Long Chen.

“I’ve long since wanted to see the power of your Remote Heaven Gang’s protective treasure!” Ouyang Qiuyu sneered and took out the Heaven Catching Drum. Booming sound filled the air as the Heaven Catching Drum began to fight against the Remote Heaven War Flag.

“The Xuantian Dao Sect is pigheaded and harboring a devil king! Everyone, we must suppress these villains!” shouted the patriarch to the other half-step Kings.

“Ouyang Qiuyu, your Xuantian Dao Sect really is intolerable. Do you think you can control the entire Eastern Wasteland? Hmph, to protect the Righteous path, don’t blame us for using numbers to bully you!” sneered one of the other half-step Kings. Along with the other six half-step Kings, they took out King items. Boundless pressure descended upon Ouyang Qiuyu.

“Brothers, kill every last person here!” said Long Chen. He was just about to erupt with all his power and see if he could block a King item’s attack.

“Stop!”

Suddenly, a cold shout rang out from the sky, shaking everyone’s eardrums. People felt like the world had lost its color, as if time had paused because of that shout.

Everyone was shocked and hurriedly raised their heads. They saw a white-robed elder in the sky standing with his hands clasped behind his back.

The elder was tall and skinny. He wore fiery-red clothes, and there was an image of a pill cauldron on his chest. That pill cauldron had a beautiful mountain valley carved onto it.

Although others didn’t sense anything from him, Ouyang Qiuyu and the other half-step Kings were all appalled.

“King realm!”

That person’s aura was reserved so it wasn’t possible to tell his cultivation base. But the fluctuations of heaven and earth all turned sluggish due to his appearance. Only half-step Kings were able to sense this person’s terror.

“Is the Righteous path so energetic that it can afford to kill its own people?” asked that elder furiously.

“Senior comes from Pill Valley? Excellent, please get justice for our Righteous path!” The Remote Heaven Gang’s patriarch hastily cupped his fists and bowed.

In truth, he was filled with regret. He knew that even if they exterminated the Xuantian Dao Sect because of Long Chen, the Xuantian Dao Sect’s head sect still wasn’t something they could offend. And so he had intentionally spread the news of the Devil Execution Conference in advance to some larger powers. One of those was Pill Valley.

According to his plan, Pill Valley and the others should have only arrived after Long Chen was killed. They were there to be witnesses, and when the Xuantian Dao Sect’s people arrived, they wouldn’t be able to do anything.

But no matter how meticulous the plan was, accidents always occurred. He hadn’t expected Pill Valley’s experts to arrive so quickly. It threw a wrench in his plans, but he could only force his way through this unexpected situation and have the Pill Valley's King take charge.

The appearance of a King immediately caused the scene to calm down. Even Long Chen hadn’t expected Kings to appear.

Now it was troublesome. Long Chen wasn’t afraid of half-step Kings, but he definitely didn’t have a chance against a King. Ouyang Qiuyu had told him just how big the difference between a half-step King and a King was. It was an unbridgeable gap.

At this time, over ten men and women flew over as well, all wearing Pill Valley’s robes. They all appeared very young. There were seven golden lines at the front of their chests.

That caused Long Chen to be extremely startled. Seven lines represented that they could refine seventh tier medicinal pills. And their cultivation bases were all at the late Sea Expansion. Some were even at the peak.

Those people stood behind the elder, icily looking at the people below. Their eyes were full of arrogance, as if they were looking at ants.

However, with such a high cultivation base and the ability to refine seventh tier pills, they had the qualifications to be arrogant.

“Long Chen, do you know your sins?” The Pill Valley's King shouted at Long Chen.

“Senior-”

“Shut up. This isn’t somewhere you can speak,” said the King, cutting off Ouyang Qiuyu’s words.

Ouyang Qiuyu was enraged. He was going too far. Even without investigating the rights and wrongs of the matter, he directly interrogated Long Chen. This was completely unfair.

“Long Chen, do you know your crimes?” he shouted again. But this time a powerful pressure crashed down on Long Chen.

“Does it have a damn to do with you? In fact, none of this has anything to do with you. Did you run out without taking your medicine this morning?” said Long Chen.

“Arrogant brat.”

“Absolutely courting death.”

“Master, let me go out and kill this brat.”

The disciples from Pill Valley immediately shouted furiously, ready to attack Long Chen immediately.

“Hmph, as expected, you are arrogant and don’t know what respect is. No wonder all I heard on the way was how presumptuous you were and how you colluded against your own sect. Just looking at you is disgusting. There’s no need to waste so many words. Follow me back to Pill Valley,” said the King. He was just about to take action when fierce spatial fluctuations appeared.

“Sorry, but it seems this matter isn’t just up to your Pill Valley. Otherwise, the face of the Central Plains’ ancient races will be lost.”

A black-robed man appeared. He had two horns on his head, and his long hair fell naturally. There were faint flames within his eyes. Space began to violently twist because of his appearance. Everyone was startled. Another King had appeared.

“What do you think you’re doing?” asked the Pill Valley's King.

The black-robed man wasn’t servile nor overbearing against him. “Long Chen used despicable methods to slaughter my ancient races’ experts. The alliance master has ordered me to investigate, so unfortunately, I cannot allow you to bring him away.”

The Pill Valley's King was clearly intimidated upon hearing that.

“Sorry to arrive late. This Long Chen killed too many of my ancient family alliance’s disciples. Lord Di Long has ordered me to capture him alive.” Just at this moment, a flying boat appeared in the sky. The boat was put away, revealing a middle-aged man.

Three Kings had now appeared. Ouyang Qiuyu was shocked. She didn’t understand how this matter had drawn all of them over.

After all, she had long since asked the head sect for reinforcements. But those reinforcements still hadn’t arrived before these three Kings.

Ouyang Qiuyu didn’t know that the Remote Heaven Gang’s patriarch had long since released the news. He had calculated everything properly, but there had still been a slight mistake. The three Kings were truly too fast.

“Seniors, Long Chen committed innumerable vile crimes. It is better to execute him to get justice for the Righteous path, and-” Ji Changkong rose and bowed. As a generation’s expert, he wanted to express himself. After all, the three of them were Kings. If they were to take a liking to him, he would be like a fish that leaped over the dragon gate. He was unwilling to stay forever in the Remote Heaven Gang.

“Shut up! This is not a place you can speak. Who do you think you are?” shouted a young man from Pill Valley.

Ji Changkong was infuriated, but he didn’t say anything. He simply smiled slightly.

Meng Qi and the others were all nervous. They hadn’t expected this matter to develop to this point. It was troublesome now with three Kings.

The three Kings didn’t say anything for a while as they stood in the air. From their eyes, it was possible to see that they were communicating with Spiritual Strength.

After a long while, the Pill Valley's King announced, “We have decided to first bring away the criminal known as Long Chen.” He extended his hand, just about to attack.

“Hahahahaha!” Long Chen suddenly raised his head and laughed. That laughter was full of disdain.

“Brazen criminal, you still dare to be brazen with death waiting for you?” shouted one of Pill Valley’s disciples. A pair of wings appeared on his back, and a terrifying heat roasted the sky.

Four-colored runes revolved around him. A huge flame spear pierced toward Long Chen, arriving in front of him in an instant.

It was as quick as lightning and contained a terrifying aura. This one attack shocked everyone.

Bang! ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

Pow!

A scale-covered hand shattered the flame spear, and another hand slapped across that person’s face.
