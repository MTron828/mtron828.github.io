Chapter 2081 The Stone Race’s Shi Lingfeng

Beitang Rushuang stood up and actually gave the slightest bow to Nangong Zuiyue. “Let me apologize for my conduct the other day. It was my mistake.”

Nangong Zuiyue couldn’t believe her own ears. The prideful and even somewhat conceited Beitang Rushuang was apologizing to her? She had never dared to imagine such a thing and hastily returned the bow. Caught off-guard, she didn’t say anything in return.

“However, that doesn’t mean that we’re friends. We’ll just settle things individually. The enmity between our two families will be settled one day. The sin of harming others cannot be washed away with time,” added Beitang Rushuang.

As soon as she said this, her mental realm brightened. When all she had wanted to do was defeat Nangong Zuiyue, her mental realm had been messy, and it was only through Long Chen’s reminder that she found that her desire for vengeance had clouded her Dao-heart. That could lead her astray without her even realizing it. Now that she had apologized to Nangong Zuiyue, she felt more relaxed than she had in a long time.

Nangong Zuiyue nodded. “I know. If our positions were switched, my self-control might not have been as good as yours. A wrong is a wrong, and quibbling about it is meaningless, nor can the flow of time erase it.”

Long Chen clapped his hands. “Exactly, there’s no way for us to resolve such a thing right now because there’s no key to unlocking the problem. Time can’t wash away sins, but it can allow us to slowly find a way to resolve things. Karma exists between all things, and it simply means that we haven’t reached the time to resolve that karma yet. Since the problem can’t be resolved yet, let’s not be hostile. Come, let me treat you two to some good fruit!”

“Shameless. Does any of this belong to you?” mocked Beitang Rushuang. This was all the Dongfang family’s. How was he treating them?

Nangong Zuiyue was truly startled. Just when did Beitang Rushuang get so close to Long Chen? Her words flowed out of her mouth without hesitation or worry.

“Let me tell you, my hometown has many elegant ways of eating fruit. I’ve only shown you one.” Long Chen picked up another fruit. “Now, I’ll display an even more difficult...”

“Bastard, if you dare to repulse me, I’ll throttle you.” Beitang Rushaung’s hair stood on end once more.

“I’m a scoundrel, but you’re a lady, so try to preserve your dignity,” said Long Chen upon seeing Beitang Rushuang about to attack him. He hastily changed the subject. “It doesn’t matter who’s treating. Eat whatever you want.”

Nangong Zuiyue sat down in a refined manner. She didn’t go for any fruit. Instead, she reached out and held a teacup.

Only then did the attendant recover from her shock, and she hastily poured the tea for Nangong Zuiyue. Nangong Zuiyue nodded and said her thanks.

“Fairy Zuiyue is truly a warm and educated person. Just looking at you, I feel refreshed and content,” praised Long Chen. Nangong Zuiyue’s warm air was like Chu Yao’s, except she was like water, gentle and soft. It was like there was nothing in this world that could make her angry. She would always be like the calm surface of a lake.

Long Chen’s praise made Nangong Zuiyue smile slightly, and she was about to say a few humble words when Beitang Rushuang pounced. “Long Chen, are you cursing me for being coarse and wild?”

“No, no, definitely not.” Naturally, he could not admit such a thing no matter what.

The attendant covered her smile. In her eyes, peerless geniuses like them were either icily arrogant or had strange temperaments. They were always hard to get along with. However, the three of them were together, with Nangong Zuiyue being warm and Beitang Rushuang being frank like they were close.

As for Long Chen, this seemingly unbearably coarse fellow was able to make them laugh with one word and jump with another. Although she knew that she shouldn’t laugh, she almost made a sound several times.

Fortunately, the three of them were amicable. Others might have long since kicked her out.

More experts began to arrive. Suddenly, Long Chen stopped talking, focusing on one very large figure.

This newcomer was three meters tall and three meters thick. He was a giant fatty with a bald head. His large arms were bare, while his neck was nonexistent. He wore a garb that Long Chen had never seen before.

If he was just a fatty, then that wouldn’t be too bizarre. However, there were actually pearl-sized swellings on his skin, with each lump being a sparkling kernel.

The entire room’s atmosphere grew heavy with his arrival. Long Chen sensed an immense feeling of danger from him. When this newcomer turned his face over in his direction, Long Chen felt a chill. His face also had large lumps just like a toad, but more shockingly, his eyes were two violet amethysts.

“The Stone race’s Shi Lingfeng. He has actually come out.” Even Beitang Rushuang and Nangong Zuiyue’s expressions changed. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

“Just who is he?” asked Long Chen.

“You don’t even know of the stone race?” Beitang Rushuang raised a brow.

Ah, he was once more being looked down at. Long Chen was speechless. Was this fellow really so famous?

It was Nangong Zuiyue who said, “When it comes to the Stone race, there probably aren’t many records in the current era. They are taboo. Even in the ancient era, no one liked talking about them, so it’s understandable that you don’t know them. The Stone race is not human. They are a strange lifeform. No one knows where they came from, but it was like a mass of stones had suddenly come to life. No one was capable of figuring out where they came from, because they were vicious killers that attacked on sight. They appeared and vanished on the continent a few times. Every time they appeared, a storm of blood swept the continent. This Shi Lingfeng is said to be the Stone race’s second strongest existence in all of its history. During his generation, the entire continent was almost crippled by him. If all the experts of that time had not joined together to heavily injure him, the entire human race of the continent might have been eliminated. The Stone race was the nightmare of the continent at that time, but then they suddenly vanished. I didn’t expect them to finally reappear after so many years.”

“Their second strongest in all of their history? Then who was the strongest?” asked Long Chen.

“The strongest was the famous Stone Emperor, Shi Changsheng. He is one of history’s three Emperors,” answered Nangong Zuiyue.

Long Chen sucked in a cold breath. The three emperors were the only existences said to be able to challenge the Sovereigns.

“That’s why you absolutely can’t provoke him. He’s extremely terrifying,” warned Beitang Rushuang.

“I never provoke others. But if others provoke me, I’m not going to let them bully me. That includes every one of my enemies here. They were the ones who first provoked me. But tell me, if he has such an enmity with the human race, how could Dongfang Yuyang invite him here?” asked Long Chen.

“That’s due to the passing of eras. The dark era is coming, and if the Martial Heaven Continent’s lifeforms wish to survive, they must unite. We cannot be fighting amongst ourselves at such a time, or once the dark era comes, the Martial Heaven Continent will be powerless to resist. The world will be destroyed. Before this tribulation comes, we must set aside all our enmities. But is doing such a thing really possible? In all of history, only five people have ever been able to unite the continent,” said Nangong Zuiyue.

The only ones who were truly peerless in this world were the Sovereigns. Only they had been able to unite all the races.

“Scram!”

A voice like stones rubbing together rang out. With a startled cry, one of the female attendants was sent flying, her blood spraying.

This attendant had tried to pour tea for Shi Lingfeng when he had sat down, but as soon as she had picked up the teacup, she was sent flying by an invisible force. The impact knocked her unconscious.

“I hate water the most. Did you not know?!” demanded Shi Lingfeng.

There were over ten experts sitting in their own seats, and seeing this scene made them frown. Just how could Shi Lingfeng attack such a weak attendant? However, none of them made a move. This place was the Dongfang family’s territory, and it wasn’t up to them.

Very quickly, an elder walked over, but unexpectedly, he actually apologized to Shi Lingfeng. “My sincerest apologies, this little girl didn’t know about this taboo of the Stone race. Please forgive her. Do you want another attendant?”

Long Chen couldn’t help shaking his head. Just what medicine had the Dongfang family taken this morning? How could they not give such a person a good slap in the face?

“The Stone race’s people can’t touch water. Water is the bane of their crystal runes. That girl clearly wasn’t warned about this before, but it really is beneath someone of his status to attack such a weak girl,” said Nangong Zuiyue. Shi Lingfeng’s conduct had clearly drawn her disgust.

Shi Lingfeng snorted at the elder. “Just take all this away so I don’t have to look at it.”

The elder immediately took away all the tea, and only then did Shi Lingfeng sit down. However, he immediately stood back up and looked in Long Chen’s direction. More accurately, he was looking at Nangong Zuiyue.

“What wretched luck.” Shi Lingfeng’s expression grew ugly upon seeing Nangong Zuiyue, and a barely concealed killing intent appeared in his eyes.
