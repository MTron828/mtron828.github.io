Chapter 1610 Possessed Long Chen

Translator: BornToBe

Evilmoon unleashed a burst of light and instantly grew larger, stabbing deep into the dragon skull.

The dead purgatory evil dragon suddenly began to rumble and explode. Powerful shockwaves blew Xie Qianqian far into the distance, making Long Chen jump in shock.

“Don’t worry, its dragon soul has long since vanished. This is just an instinctual twitching from having its soul essence stabbed,” said Evilmoon.

Evilmoon was like a heavenly blade now. Long Chen felt like an ant in front of it.

Light flowed around Evilmoon as it absorbed the soul essence of the purgatory evil dragon. As it said, the purgatory evil dragon was already dead, and its movements were just an automatic reaction.

Evilmoon didn’t need Long Chen’s help to absorb its energy, so Long Chen ran over to the skull’s crown.

“What sharp teeth! Dragon teeth are definitely good stuff!” Long Chen’s eyes began to shine. He jumped beside the teeth. Each tooth was as large as a mountain. When he punched it, it caused a metallic ringing, but the tooth didn’t budge. Instead, Long Chen’s fist hurt.

Just at this moment, Evilmoon flew out of the skull and returned to its original size. However, its aura was now darker and more sinister. It had clearly benefited greatly.

“Hey, don’t just help yourself. I want this purgatory evil dragon. Help me take it.” Long Chen formed a hand seal and circulated the primal chaos space. A vortex appeared behind him.

Evilmoon let out a startled cry, “You can’t take it! It’s-”

Before it could finish speaking, the purgatory evil dragon’s corpse was pulled into the air by Long Chen’s power.

However, before it could be absorbed into the primal chaos space, countless chains flew out of the black water. They instantly bound Long Chen and the purgatory evil dragon.

“Fuck, I forgot to tell him the corpse is locked by a formation. If anyone tries to take it, they’ll provoke the laws present.” Evilmoon hastily flew into the air, slashing the chains.

BANG! The chains completely rejected Evilmoon’s attack and sent it flying back.

“Not good, I can’t break these chains!” shouted Evilmoon. These chains contained the laws of Purgatory. In its current sealed state, there was no way it could sever them.

In the distance, Xie Qianqian jumped in shock. She panicked as Long Chen and the giant dragon were bound by countless black chains. In the end, they turned into a giant black star. It was a terrifying seal.

“Long Chen!” Xie Qianqian had no idea what to do. Her best option would be to abandon Long Chen and fly away to the only exit. She knew she couldn’t help, but she also couldn’t just leave him. Her mind was blank.

Evilmoon repeatedly attacked the ball of chains, but it couldn’t break them.

“Long Chen, you can’t die yet! You still haven’t undone my seal!” roared Evilmoon.

However, it felt like each of its attacks was landing on cotton. It was unable to find any spot to unleash its power.

BOOM!

Suddenly, the chains exploded, and the purgatory evil dragon’s corpse was sent flying. Where the ball of chains had been was Long Chen, black qi circulating around him. Endless negative emotions exploded out of him, shocking Xie Qianqian.

“Long Chen...” Xie Qianqian felt that Long Chen was like a completely different person. The current Long Chen looked like an Asura who had slaughtered countless people. He was covered in killing intent.

Long Chen’s eyes had turned red, and that red was the red of fresh blood. They were glaringly bright. His hair was standing on end as if he had entered a berserk state.

“A little Purgatory thinks it can trap me? What a joke!” Long Chen’s voice was the same yet also different. It was like there were two voices overlapping, one that was Long Chen’s, and the other that belonged to someone she didn’t know.

“This is...” Evilmoon was also shocked.

Long Chen raised his head and roared. The chains he had shattered were in the midst of flying back and resealing him when they were blown to dust by his roar.

A terrifying ripple spread through the air, tearing apart space. This was an unstoppable power, one that even Purgatory would have to submit to.

Huge waves exploded on the black ocean. As it raged, more chains flew out of it at Long Chen.

“Scram!”

Those chains were turned to dust. Long Chen no longer appeared human; he was like a god from hell. None of the laws here could subdue him.

“Is a little Purgatory so amazing? Today, I, Long Chen, will completely destroy all your eighteen layers!”

The black qi surging out of Long Chen enveloped him, and he was about to charge back into the black ocean when Evilmoon slammed the back of his head with its hilt, knocking him unconscious.

“He’s been possessed. Hurry and bring him away,” shouted Evilmoon at Xie Qianqian. It returned to Long Chen’s primal chaos space.

Xie Qianqian was still a bit stunned. Things had happened so suddenly that she didn’t even know what was happening. She hastily grabbed the unconscious Long Chen and unleashed her mental energy to float through the air.

The ocean and the air were filled with that sticky spatial law, making it impossible to fly quickly. However, she was comforted to see that once Long Chen was unconscious and Evilmoon disappeared, the raging ocean returned to calm. No more chains came flying out.

“What’s going on? How could there be another kind of energy hiding within Long Chen’s body?” Evilmoon was deeply shocked.

Just now, Long Chen had transformed into someone else. Fortunately, his subconscious still viewed it as a partner, or it wouldn’t have been able to knock him unconscious.

The state Long Chen had just been in made Evilmoon feel very uneasy. There was something hidden in Long Chen’s body that made it feel afraid.

They finally got close to the white light. Without Xie Qianqian having to do anything, a suction force came from the white light, drawing them inside.

Xie Qianqian felt the world spinning around her. It was like space was thrown into chaos. She almost fainted.

After a moment, she let out a startled cry as she found that the two of them were falling from the sky.

The two of them dropped onto the ground. Long Chen landed first, while Xie Qianqian landed on him. They rolled like calabashes.

Long Chen slowly opened his eyes from the collision. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

“It hurts.”

Long Chen reached out and rubbed the back of his head, feeling a large bump.

He thought that it was from falling and was about to say something when he saw several lifeforms around them, staring at them in shock.

“This is... the Gates of Hell?”

Long Chen looked around and saw the large gates he had seen before. He let out a delighted cry. They really had come out alive!

“Xigaluca...” One of the lifeforms shouted at Long Chen and Xie Qianqian as they stood.

Long Chen sent it flying with a slap. “Fuck, I didn’t run from Purgatory to listen to your ugly words. If you don’t want to die, then back up!”

Although he had no idea what it had been saying, based on its appearance, he could tell it had no kind intentions.

That lifeform roared and charged at Long Chen, its hands transforming into two sharp claws.

“Since you’re in such a rush to reincarnate, I’ll help you out.” Long Chen sneered and took out Evilmoon, slashing it.

The lifeform exploded into dust. The surrounding lifeforms all backed up in fright.

They had just seen Long Chen and Xie Qianqian fly out of the Gates of Hell. Naturally, they questioned what they were and what the situation was inside.

One of them had paid the price for that. The other lifeforms all stared at the weapon in Long Chen’s hand in fright and backed up.

“Let’s go.” Long Chen pulled Xie Qianqian away from the other lifeforms. Those lifeforms immediately got out of their way.

They arrived at where the staircase was. As expected, Xie Qianqian had walked the orange path, and Long Chen couldn’t see the staircase here. That was one of the laws present. Each person could only go through their own path.

“Long Chen, I’m going to leave. You have to come find me in the future.” Xie Qianqian looked at Long Chen. Her eyes reddened slightly. They were about to go on different paths.

Although the time she had known Long Chen was short, she had great trust in him. He was the first person she felt any trust in after her parents had died.

“Don’t worry. Study hard once you get back. I’m looking forward to your strongest battle armor.” Long Chen smiled warmly and patted Xie Qianqian’s head.

Xie Qianqian waved goodbye and began climbing a seemingly invisible staircase.

Eventually, Xie Qianqian vanished from Long Chen’s sight.

Once she was gone, Long Chen didn’t directly go to the black region to find his staircase. Instead, he returned to the Gates of Hell.

When he was once more standing before the Gates of Hell, a sinister smile appeared on his face, one that frightened all the other lifeforms. What had this vicious person come back for?

“Long Chen, what are you planning? Don’t tell me you want to tear off the doors!” exclaimed Evilmoon.
