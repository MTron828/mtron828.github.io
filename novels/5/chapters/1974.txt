Chapter 1964: 1964

The two Leng Yueyan’s had vanished, and Long Chen looked at the swirling sand and dust around him, feeling like he was dreaming .

“She left just like that?”

This was Long Chen’s first time feeling like this . He felt lost and empty .

“Long Chen, I might not have admired anyone else in my lifetime, but you I admire . You even managed to get involved with a god . Amazing,” praised Evilmoon .

“Did you know it from the start?!” raged Long Chen .

“Cough, to tell the truth, I only had some suspicions . I was never able to confirm anything . But there was nothing I could do . Some things can’t be randomly spoken about, or the one bearing this karma would be you,” said Evilmoon hastily .

Long Chen snorted, not believing that excuse . He felt that Evilmoon was becoming more of a conner as time passed . Although it followed him through life and death, sometimes it was just a huge conman .

Long Chen looked up at the sky and then at his own hands .

“What, are you pondering over that feeling?” snickered Evilmoon .

“Scram!”

After saying that, Long Chen also laughed . However, that laughter was a bit bitter as he felt something that was hard to describe . This experience was beyond belief .

Thereafter, Long Chen began flying through the air and found that he was in the northwestern part of the Central Xuan Region .

In that battle in the Heavenly Evil Cave, he had used up all his power . He had to admit that his true combat power had been surpassed by Xie Luo .

The Life Star realm was a huge barrier in front of him . He had even used up everything and hadn’t managed to kill Xie Luo .

Although he was able to fight across realms and even slay Netherpassage experts, those Netherpassage experts were just rank nine Celestials . Empyreans had only appeared in their generation . So even though he was able to kill Netherpassage experts, he couldn’t slay a Life Star Empyrean on this level . That was the difference between realms . He had to quickly catch up .

Furthermore, through this fight, his realm had stabilized once more . He possessed the qualifications to attack the Life Star realm .

He hopped into a flying boat, going toward the Eastern Xuan Region . He spent several days flying, using that time to prepare to attack the Life Star realm .

When he once more descended upon the Eastern Xuan City, he caused chaos . Last time, he had killed his way out, but now he had come again . He was actually ignoring the threat that Pill Valley and the others posed him . This was arrogance, this was domineering!

Long Chen directly walked into the Huayun Pavilion . On the way, he had already sent a message to the Huayun Sect that he wanted to talk with Zheng Wenlong . Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

“Brother Long, you grow more amazing with each passing day . You even dared to charge into the Heavenly Evil Cave . I really don’t know what to say,” said Zheng Wenlong .

Long Chen was startled . The battle inside the Heavenly Evil Cave was definitely not public information . It was suppressed by the Corrupt path, but despite Xie Wentian’s information lockdown, Zheng Wenlong still knew of it .

“Amazing . ” Long Chen praised Zheng Wenlong . He knew that the Corrupt path definitely had people that the Huayun Sect had bribed . For the Huayun Sect to be able to do such a thing in a place where only the most fervent of the Corrupt path’s followers were allowed, perhaps only Pill Valley possessed the same ability .

“How is the continent’s state currently?” asked Long Chen .

“It’s still the same, and they’re using the same moves . However, there have been several large battles with the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow race . They have taken some heavy losses . With Heavenly Fate Island’s help, seven of their strongholds have been destroyed by the Xuan Beasts . ”

Long Chen’s teacup shattered . “Good . Very good . ”

Long Chen’s voice was filled with icy killing intent . Unable to target him, they actually turned toward others .

“Brother Wenlong, help me release news that three days from now, I, Long Chen, will be paying a visit to Heavenly Fate Island . Have them wash their necks for me . Other than that, welcome the other major powers to come watch . Tell them not to miss this chance, because in three days, Heavenly Fate Island will no longer exist . ” Long Chen smiled, but that smile was chilling .

Zheng Wenlong gulped . He could guess what Long Chen was about to do .

...

A shocking piece of news quickly resounded throughout the Martial Heaven Continent .

“What? Long Chen is challenging Heavenly Fate Island by himself? Is he mad?”

“If it wasn’t the Huayun Sect spreading this news, I’d really think it was just a wild rumor . Just what is he thinking, challenging the entire world by himself?”

“Perhaps he found some powerful backer, and he couldn’t wait for revenge?”

Long Chen’s challenge toward Heavenly Fate Island shook the continent . Just what kind of figure was Long Chen? He was a figure of miracles . He was the creator of the number one legion, a legend with countless worshippers amongst the junior generation, a figure that was imitated but never surpassed .

The most widespread saying was that Long Chen never said any empty words . And after investigating his history, this saying had been confirmed . As long as he dared to say it, he would dare to do it .

If these words were coming from someone else, they would assume it was just an attempt at intimidation or mental warfare . But for Long Chen to say it shook countless sects .

“Long Chen’s finally angry . He’s going to strike back as he would rather break than bend . There’s going to be an unprecedented bloody battle soon . ”

Many people guessed that Long Chen had already advanced to the Life Star realm . It had been three months since he had vanished .

For him to suddenly come back, he would definitely bring the Dragonblood Legion with him . The Dragonblood Legion was filled with monsters who fought across realms as easy as eating . They were equivalent to over ten thousand Netherpassage experts . Just how terrifying was that?

However, some people also scoffed at this challenge . Did Long Chen think that all geniuses in this world were in the Dragonblood Legion? What about the countless experts and geniuses of the sects?

True Immortal Jiaoqi, Xie Luo, Di Feng, they were peak heavenly geniuses . They represented the greatest force of their respective powers . Moreover, the various powers had only sent a portion of their powers into the Yin Yang World . They had all held a few geniuses back . The foundations of the major powers of the continent were too great to estimate .

Many people thought that Long Chen was simply courting death . If he went to Heavenly Fate Island, then even without the Netherpassage experts interfering, just the monsters of the junior generation would be able to trample the Dragonblood Legion .

After all, the strongest person in the Dragonblood Legion was just Long Chen . If an expert on True Immortal Jiaoqi’s level charged into the Dragonblood Legion, they wouldn’t be able to stop him .

In any case, Long Chen’s challenge had shaken the continent . The attention of the entire continent concentrated on Heavenly Fate Island .

Heavenly Fate Island quickly responded to this news . The general meaning was that Long Chen had finally revealed his cowardly head, and that if he had continued to hide, the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow race would have been destroyed because of him .

Long Chen’s supporters were enraged at that reply . Heavenly Fate Island was absolutely shameless . It was clearly a conflict between the Xuan Beasts and the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow race, but they had interfered and then blamed Long Chen .

At the same time, Heavenly Fate Island released word that anyone from any power could come to Heavenly Fate Island to watch how they would uphold justice for the continent and remove a scourge from this world . Hopefully, the ‘justice warriors’ of the world wouldn’t miss this chance to make their name known .

Heavenly Fate Island wasn’t just openly allowing people to help, but they were encouraging the prideful geniuses to come and target Long Chen .

This was their chance to defeat the strongest junior generation expert of the continent . They would only have this one chance . If they missed it, they would never have another chance .

Long Chen’s name had eclipsed the other geniuses of the continent . This should have been an era where many heavenly geniuses competed with each other, but after True Immortal Jiaoqi, Huo Lieyun, and Xie Luo had joined hands and still failed to defeat Long Chen, they had solidified his position as the number one expert . Although Leng Yueyan had appeared in the end and interrupted their attacks, it didn’t change the fact that Long Chen hadn’t been defeated by them .

Ever since Long Chen had been expelled by the Martial Heaven Alliance, the entire continent had grown uneasy . However, this news caused countless experts that had been hiding in their sects to fly toward Heavenly Fate Island . They were going to bear witness to this fight .

Heavenly Fate Island was a mysterious existence . It wasn’t an island surrounded by water but a floating island .

It was a gigantic island measured in millions of miles . It floated in the Central Xuan Region’s southern domain . It was one of the continent’s four great wonders . No one knew how it floated there .

Most of the time, Heavenly Fate Island’s experts stayed in seclusion and rarely interacted with the rest of the world . But during the next three days, they were extremely lively, with experts arriving with each passing day .

Heavenly Fate Island’s disciples greeted the newcomers . They were extremely courteous to those that came from Pill Valley, the ancient races, the Corrupt path, the Xuan Beasts, the ancient family alliance, and those allied powers . But to the other experts, they turned up their noses . They had clearly received orders and were doing that on purpose .

“Long Chen, today, I, True Immortal Jiaoqi, will personally cut off your head!”

The void rumbled, and a giant war chariot pulled by a nine-color celestial horse arrived .
