BOOM!

Fang Liude’s manifestation materialized behind him, and his hatchets blazed with light as he slashed them down, emitting a sharp whistling sound that made the mountains tremble.

The Six Horn Sea Serpent, weakened from laying its eggs, was caught off guard by Fang Liude’s attack. However, it still managed to open its mouth and unleash a giant whirlpool.

A terrifying suction force appeared. Fang Liude faced it for a moment, but he suddenly turned around and fled.

It seemed that Fang Liude’s attack was nothing more than bait to draw the Six Horn Sea Serpent’s attention. At this moment, the others made their move.

BOOM!

An explosive sound rang out. Someone had tossed an object that exploded by the Six Horn Sea Serpent’s mouth, scattering ash-gray powder through the air.

The powder was instantly devoured by the whirlpool. All of a sudden, the Six Horn Sea Serpent let out a screech and shook its head ferociously.

BOOM!

A warhammer struck its head, causing its head to drop.

Just then, Long Chen was surprised to see the archer appear under the Six Horn Sea Serpent’s tail, precisely where it expelled waste. The archer swiftly shot an arrow there.

With a booming sound, Long Chen saw its tail curl up, blood spraying through the air. The Six Horn Sea Serpent soared into the air, writhing in immense pain.

Just then, eight chains wrapped around it, held by eight experts who seemed to merge with the earth. All eight of them actually possessed earth energy. The ground beneath their feet quivered, but the chains firmly bound the Six Horn Sea Serpent.

“It works!”

Seeing that they had really caught the Six Horn Sea Serpent, they were delighted. Despite their trust in Long Chen, capturing a Heaven Saint sea demon, especially the renowned Six Horn Sea Serpent, seemed almost implausible to them.

In truth, their attacks were mere probing blows, and they hadn’t expected the eight of them to be able to bind the Six Horn Sea Serpent. They wanted to decide whether to keep fighting or run away based on the Six Horn Sea Serpent’s action. Since the Six Horn Sea Serpent was completely bound, it was truly in an extremely weak state.

“Attack!” Fang Liude shouted.

At this moment, its scales flashed again; that was the second time. They had to kill it before it recovered. Otherwise, they wouldn’t be able to run away.

Their cooperation was nearly flawless. The eighteen of them attacked and defended together, creating opportunities for the others to attack the Six Horn Sea Serpent’s weak spots.

To kill it, they went all out. When they managed to cut a large opening on its head, Fang Liude plunged a halberd covered in runes right into the wound.

BOOM!

The Six Horn Sea Serpent stiffened and collapsed on the ground, its body twitching.

Seeing the Six Horn Sea Serpent on the verge of death, Fang Liude shouted in excitement, “Quick, clean up the battlefield!”

They had actually managed to pull it off. However, they had to quickly cut its corpse apart. Once it died, the Neidan and crystal core would absorb its energy, extracting the energy in its scales and bones, which resulted in their quality dropping.

They were real professionals, and no one slacked off as they cut its corpse apart. As for its eggs, they had been secured at the start to avoid them being destroyed in the battle.

When Long Chen came to its corpse, Fang Liude looked at him excitedly and said, “Brother, you really are our lucky star. You brought us such fortune so quickly. Don’t worry, you’ll definitely get a portion of this Six Horn Sea Serpent.”

Long Chen smiled. There actually wasn’t anything he wanted from its body. He already had better versions of the parts that could be used as medicinal ingredients.

“Wow, I didn’t expect you to be able to kill a Six Horn Sea Serpent. Hurry up and hand it over.”

Just then, a slimy voice rang out, causing everyone’s expressions to change. They looked over to see a monkey-faced man staring at them.Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

He was precisely the leader of the group that had surrounded them in front of the wine shop. This time, he had hundreds of other experts around him, and they quickly surrounded Long Chen and the others.

“Keep cutting it. In a bit, we’ll slaughter them. If we don’t make them see blood, they’ll think that we can be bullied,” remarked Fang Liude. He then jumped off the Six Horn Sea Serpent’s corpse and coldly said, “You want to take the prey we risked our lives for? Saint Emperor Zhantian has fought for us to have more rights, but you still want to keep fighting amongst ourselves. There’s no curing your stupidity.”

Long Chen was startled. Saint Emperor Zhantian?

“Hehe, you’re wrong. We’re not after your things. However, these treasures indeed belong to someone else,” said the sharp-mouthed monkey man with wicked pleasure.

Just then, a golden war chariot whistled over. It had the markings of the Long clan on it.

“You…!” Fang Liude was incensed, but his heart sank. This bastard had passed word of their hunt to the Long clan, wanting to use the Long clan’s disciples to take their prey.

The war chariot stopped in midair, and over ten white-robed men and women walked out, each of them having a badge on their robes. Their leader was an icy-faced man with a golden badge. Upon seeing him, Fang Liude and the others instantly despaired.

“Inner disciples of the Long clan.”

That badge was a symbol of their status. In the Long clan, inner disciples had to be part of the main bloodline or exceptionally talented outer experts.

In particular, the leader of the Long clan disciples had reached the ninth Heavenstage and was an eight star Heavenly Doyen. His presence was suffocating.

“Senior apprentice-brother Huanghui, junior brother’s information wasn’t wrong, right?” asked the monkey-faced man as he smiled ingratiatingly, appearing as if he would personally lick this disciple’s boots. If he had a tail, it would be wagging like a pinwheel.

At this moment, this Huanghui was staring at the Six Horn Sea Serpent, his eyes brimming with greed. He completely ignored the monkey-faced man.

“How brazen of you. You killed the prey that we already marked. Shouldn’t you hurry up and hand it over?”
