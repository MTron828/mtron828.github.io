Chapter 3211 The Hesitation of the Inner Heart

Almost all of the Ying Prefecture’s experts had spatial rings with a large number of sea demon corpses in them.

There was no way around it. They fought with the sea demons year-round, and these corpses had to be disposed of in a far-off, desolate land to avoid affecting others.

However, with Long Chen accepting them all, they didn’t need to make the extra effort. There was no transportation formation leading to that desolate wilderness. Moreover, it was said that there were some legendary desolate creatures living in the depths of that land, and even Immortal Kings didn’t dare to enter too deeply.

Every time they sent the corpses there, they did it carefully to avoid disturbing those terrifying creatures. Now, there was no need to worry. Long Chen took all those corpses off of their hands.

Due to the immortal world’s laws, it wasn’t so easy to create spatial rings. Making it required a craftsman on the level of an Immortal King to insert the spatial runes as well as precious materials. Fortunately, people already had astral spaces, so there weren’t many scenarios where spatial rings were required.

To waste such extravagant items on storing corpses was naturally very uncomfortable for these experts, but it was better than simply casting the corpses on their land.

With an unending stream of corpses entering the primal chaos space, the Wood Foundation Divine Trees rapidly grew. The region of the black soil was so big that all these corpses combined were nothing more than an appetizer for it.

The Wood Foundation Divine Trees were only three meters thick, but they were two hundred miles tall. Looking from the top, they were so thin that they were like threads of silk. It was an extremely odd appearance.

In fact, they were so tall that Long Chen was starting to worry they would break themselves. However, at three hundred miles tall, they stopped growing taller and began to thicken. The rate at which they thickened was far slower than when they grew taller. As they thickened, their life energy multiplied.

As Long Chen emptied the spatial rings, more spatial rings were available to gather more corpses on the battlefield. The Ying Prefecture’s experts then split up the tasks, with a portion of them gathering the corpses and a portion of them gathering the cores. Long Chen even saw people recording things as they worked. Clearly, they had their own system that was very effective for handling the cores. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

However, Long Chen’s World Extermination Flame Lotus had not just killed the sea demons at the surface but also the ones that had yet to come out of the depths. Because of it, millions of experts worked for six full hours before the battlefield was emptied.

When the battle spoils were publicly announced, people couldn’t believe their ears. They had obtained over a hundred million cores.

Just how many sea demons had Long Chen killed with that one attack? It had to be known that not every sea demon had a core. Due to their power not being concentrated in a core, their power was distributed throughout their bodies, making their physical bodies incredibly powerful. However, the lack of a core also meant that they couldn’t use divine abilities. To humans, they were slightly easier to deal with.

After fighting with the sea demons for so many years, the Ying Prefecture’s experts were aware that amongst third rank sea demons, or Four Peak sea demons, only thirty percent had a core.

Amongst fourth rank sea demons, around fifty percent had a core. That was because for sea demons without cores, it was harder to accumulate enough energy to advance.

In other words, Long Chen had killed far more sea demons than the number of obtained cores. It was an unimaginable number.

After learning about all this, Long Chen understood why he had gained so much life energy. The sea demons gave him more life energy than the devil beasts due to the former lacking cores.

Everyone looked at Long Chen reverently. As for the junior generation, their blood was boiling fiercely. They would never be able to forget that attack in this lifetime.

Luo Changwu actually felt a bit embarrassed upon seeing the number of cores they had gained. Many of them were top grade cores, and the cores of the sea serpents in particular were very valuable.

Long Chen said that he didn’t want the cores, but they were incredibly valuable. Furthermore, this wasn’t just a matter for the Luo family but the entirety of the Ying Prefecture. However, only the Luo family owed a debt for this. That was a bit inappropriate.

Even so, Luo Changwu also knew Long Chen’s character, and he knew that Long Chen might get angry if he forcibly tried to split the profits with him. This fellow was very proud, so Luo Changwu could only put this matter aside for now.

After the battlefield was cleaned up, the devil sea once more returned to its deathly silence. However, this calmness was extremely frightening. It felt like some terrifying monsters might just charge out of the depths at any moment.

“Boss, I think I should go back.” At this point, Xu Zixiong came over to Long Chen dispiritedly.

Long Chen smiled. “Why? Did you receive a blow?”

Xu Zixiong nodded. “I had no chance to use my power and be a hero at home. It was difficult to get out this time, and I wanted to get famous in the Heavenly Swell Domain, only to find that when I had a chance to use my power, I had no power at all and was no hero.”

Xu Zixiong’s words were very downhearted. This battle had shown him that he was far too weak, weak to the point that he had the urge to kill himself. He had never thought that his status as a Primal, something that he was so proud of, was nothing more than a joke.

Bai Xiaole, Luo Bing, Luo Ning, and the others all felt a bit bad for him. He was truly pitiable. When frogs at the bottom of the well saw the outside world, it wasn’t just excitement at seeing the greater world but also a great blow to their confidence. The current Xu Zixiong seemed to have lost all hope.

“Like Xiaole and Qin Feng, you call me boss, and I don’t reject you. That’s because you have the Barbarian race’s blood in your body. I once received a favor from one of the Barbarian race’s experts, and he bestowed me with a treasured blade, Blooddrinker. I also have a brother from the Barbarian race. It can be said that my relationship with the Barbarian race runs very deep. As long as you really want to get stronger, you will definitely obtain your wish by following me. As for being a hero, you might have misunderstood. Someone with strong martial power is not a hero. I can only make sure that you get stronger. As for turning you into a hero, that’s not possible for me,” said Long Chen.

“I… I really can get stronger?” asked Xu Zixiong, his hope reigniting.

“Don’t get emotional. Boss has never said any empty words. Just properly follow boss in the future, and even a fool like you can get a fool’s blessing,” said Qin Feng, dragging Xu Zixiong to the side. He saw that Luo Changwu seemed to want to talk with Long Chen.

“Long Chen, our Luo family is ashamed to make you join in a fight as soon as you arrive here. The devil sea has settled now, so why don’t you come to my humble home? The family head must have been looking forward to seeing you,” said Luo Changwu. He had arranged to bring Long Chen and the others back to the Luo family.

When Luo Changwu mentioned the family head, even Long Chen couldn’t help having his heart beat faster. He knew that this was his mother’s father, his grandfather. However, Long Chen didn’t know if he would be able to control his rage when he saw his grandfather. Would he be able to hold back from questioning why the family head had tossed aside his own daughter like that?

Long Chen didn’t know just how he should face this grandfather of his. Hence, he took a deep breath.

“I can only take things step by step. If being forceful doesn’t work, I can only be even more forceful.”
