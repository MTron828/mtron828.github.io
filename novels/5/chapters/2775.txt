Chapter 2764 Money Blinds the Eye

“You think you’ve beaten us? What a joke. A bunch of second-rate peddlers also dare to say such big words? Do you know that your actions have implicated the Wealth God? When the great Devil God hears of this, he will definitely slaughter all the Wealth God’s followers,” sneered the Devil race’s Emperor.

Ma Ruyun smiled indifferently. “Our actions today are due to the directives of the Wealth God. Everything else isn’t for us to worry about. When doing business, the subordinates must listen to the superiors, or the efficiency plummets, lowering the profits.”

“Fuck your fucking profits. Don’t talk about this nonsense with me. The most profitable thing in this world is battle. Your Wealth God is a fool. Since you want to die so badly, I’ll kill you all!” The Devil race’s Emperor raised his hand, and a jagged sword swirling with devil qi appeared in his hand. “I’ll show you just how terrifying the devil race is!”

His devil sword swung through the air, causing black lightning to appear in the sky. It was like the end of the world had suddenly come.

“I’m well aware of the devil race’s power. Today, I’ll show you the power of money.” The Major World Golden Coin behind Ma Ruyun transformed into a streak of light, striking the devil race’s Emperor.

Golden light erupted when the coin struck the devil sword. The entire sky turned gold.

That golden light seemed to be composed of palm-sized coins that were covered in runes.

The color of gold was something few people disliked. It symbolized wealth, profit, and everything materialistic in this world. In other words, it was something that could be used to satisfy all material desires.

Countless people protected at the core of the continent instantly became overwhelmed. Seeing those billions of coins in the sky, their eyes reddened. Their most primal desires were brought out.

Some people began walking over. Due to the barrier allowing them to see things clearly, it felt like there were coins right above their heads. Hence, people involuntarily reached out.

“Don’t mess around!”

A shout rang out. It was the Grand Xia’s Emperor, Xia Yunfeng. At this moment, Xia Yuncong and the other experts of the ancient nations began to keep order. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

There were too many commoners here. Without powerful cultivation bases, if there was any chaos, they could easily be trampled and crushed.

“They’re throwing their lives away for money?” Amongst the experts of the Grand Xia, a beautiful woman sighed.

Xia Yunfeng shook his head. “Every person sees things from unique perspectives. To a starving person, a single steamed bun is enough to make them commit a crime. After being full, a person wants to be warm and then have a home to sleep in. As you no longer worry about those things, your desires shift to higher levels. Commoners are like this, and aren’t cultivators the same? Commoners want to simply have enough food to not starve, while cultivators want to get stronger so that they don’t get killed by others. In this regard, everyone is the same. Gold might be looked down upon by us, but what about cultivation resources? Wouldn’t we also be like this mob, forgetting about our own life and death for this desire?”

“I misspoke. I shouldn’t have mocked them.” The person who had spoken was the Grand Xia’s princess, Xia Yuolou. At this time, her youthful air had completely regressed. She had become much steadier.

Back then, Xia Youluo had still had a childish nature and had been an unreasonable princess. But after experiencing the dark side of people’s hearts, as well as her own suicide, it was as if she had matured overnight. But at the same time, she grew much quieter.

This transformation pained Xia Yunfeng, Xia Yuncong, and the others. They would rather Xia Youluo still be that willful child if that meant she could live happily and worry-free.

However, they all knew that there was no way to return to the past. Unless…

Xia Yunfeng couldn’t help looking at the distant Long Chen and then at his little sister. He sighed silently.

BOOM!

After the golden light exploded, endless golden coins formed chains binding the devil race’s Emperor.

Even as he slashed his sword, shattering one chain after another, the chains simply reformed limitlessly.

“You’ve been surrounded by money. Your fate is set in stone. Struggling is futile,” said Ma Ruyun. As the Major World Golden Coin behind him quivered, more and more golden coins filled the world, binding the devil race’s Emperor.

“Bullshit!” The devil race’s Emperor roared furiously. Devil qi then exploded from him and his sword, emitting black mist. The golden chains were shattered rapidly but reformed again.

He almost escaped several times, but in the end, he was still trapped. Hence, he furiously roared.

Ma Ruyun lightly said, “Money is a double-edged sword. Used properly, it can nourish all life. Used for evil, it can destroy the world. The Wealth God has said that the most frightening thing in this world isn’t a devil or ghost. Instead, it is a businessman with no beliefs. Without any beliefs, then any and all methods can be used to scheme for profit. After that, the entire world’s resources will be extracted until there is nothing left. People’s souls will be drained. Morality will be nonexistent. In the end, they will end up using up their very self just for profit. In the end, nothing will remain…”

“Shut up!” The devil race’s Emperor roared furiously, continuing to attempt charging out but failing.

Ma Ruyun continued, “It is the root of all evil but also the foundation of all Daos. If the heavens have no desire, no life will be born. If the earth has no desire, no spirits can grow. If a beast has no desire, the species becomes extinct. If a human has no desire, heaven and earth cannot merge, Yin and Yang cannot mix…”

“Shut your fucking mouth!”

The devil race’s Emperor roared furiously, his face twisted. Ma Ruyun’s voice was like millions of mosquitos entering his ear. However, in his current predicament, he was unable to use his full power. It was like he was caught in the mud.

No matter how he cursed, Ma Ruyun remained indifferent, and he even smiled.

“Do you know why the Major World Golden Coin has this appearance?”

“Fuck off! I don’t want to know! Shut your mouth!” roared the devil race’s Emperor.
