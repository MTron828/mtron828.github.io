Chapter 3592

“Dragonbone Evilmoon!”

The shape of that black saber was precisely that of Dragonbone Evilmoon. Its shape, length, and size were all identical. Seeing it, Long Chen felt a painful pang in his heart.

Evilmoon had been his strongest weapon on the Martial Heaven Continent, and also his most trusted companion. Ultimately, it was destroyed in the final battle of the continent.

Now that Long Chen saw Evilmoon once more, he felt immense sadness but also a bit of gratification. It was like he was seeing the untameable Evilmoon again.

Dragonbone Evilmoon’s shape was aggressive and ominous. Endless black qi came out of it, shaking people’s hearts. Although Guo Ran had only imitated its outer appearance, it still stunned people.

With a black saber, black armor, and endless black qi, the current Guo Ran possessed a strange aura. This armor seemed to have come from hell. Standing on the martial stage, he was like an envoy that came to reap lives, an existence that could look down on all living things.

People only stared at him, dumbfounded. Even Xie Qianqian, Tu Hu, and the others didn’t dare to believe what they were seeing. This was also their first time seeing Guo Ran in this state.

“Where did you get devil dragon black crystals?!” shouted Wang Zixu.

Devil dragon black crystals were far too rare. Even the entire Heavenly Dragon Divine Armor College didn’t possess enough of them to create a full battle armor.

Normally, the divine material refined from devil dragon black crystals was used on the edge of the best divine weapons. It might be used for the edge of a saber or the tip of a sword to strengthen the weapon. Such a weapon would have a far greater strength when it came to shattering armor.

However, Guo Ran’s battle armor and saber were clearly made out of countless devil dragon black crystals. Thus, when he took out this set in front of everyone, everyone was completely dumbfounded. Wang Zixu’s voice even contained immense envy.

“Where did I get the devil dragon black crystals? Weren’t they given to me by you? Back in Crescent Moon Bay Devil Beast Trial, you hunted me down, and I ended up having to flee into a dangerous area, a devil dragon nest. There, I was chased down by countless devil dragons. I ended up fleeing to the bottom of their nest whereupon I saw a giant vein of devil dragon black crystals and spent a whole month excavating all of them. Hehe, do you not remember your expression from when I came out of the devil dragon nest and returned to the college? You failed to kill me, and I actually profited from the disaster. I slowly refined the devil dragon black crystals bit by bit, stealthily creating this Devil Dragon Battle Armor. After creating this armor, I swore that I would one day use the Dragonbone Evilmoon that I created from these devil dragon black crystals to cut off your head. That is the only way to express my thanks to you,” said Guo Ran, grinding his teeth.

Everyone’s heart pounded wildly. Back in the Crescent Moon Bay, Guo Ran had mysteriously vanished for over a month. They had thought that he had run into some mishap, but he still managed to return alive. At that time, Guo Ran was covered in blood, and half his body was gone. He appeared exceptionally miserable.

After Guo Ran returned, he never mentioned why he had vanished. At that time, people were very curious and made guesses.

Now that Guo Ran brought it up, they understood. So Wang Zixu had actually tried to kill Guo Ran in that hunting ground. But when Guo Ran fled, he ended up profiting, escaping to a devil dragon nest and gathering so many devil dragon black crystals.

Only now did people realize why Guo Ran had declared this to be a life-and-death match. So there was such enmity between the two of them.

“Bastard, devil dragon black crystals have always been considered divine materials by the college! Any disciple who finds any must immediately report it! Guo Ran, you selfishly hid these divine materials. You have violated the college’s rules and deserve ten thousand deaths!” howled the Assembly Elder from the Wang family.

Devil dragon black crystals were exceptionally precious. It could be used to create a top grade World Domain divine item. If a disciple obtained any or discovered the vein, they should report it to the higher-ups of the college. They could not keep them for their own use.

The college knew not to be stingy. Any disciple who handed them over would be given rewards. Anyway, devil dragon black crystals were one of the highest level divine materials, and in the hands of a disciple, it would be a waste of a natural treasure. From the refining process to using it to create divine items, a mistake in any step would ruin this treasure.

Hence, if an ordinary disciple obtained any devil dragon black crystals, they would choose to give them to the college to obtain things that they could use.

Furthermore, people had very few chances of obtaining any devil dragon black crystals. To get a single piece the size of a fist would make someone cry with joy. But the amount of essence that could be refined from a fist-sized chunk was only enough to make an embroidery needle. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

However, Guo Ran had used devil dragon black crystals to refine a complete weapon and battle armor. People were unable to imagine just how many devil dragon black crystals he had obtained back then.

“Fuck your mother, you’re the ones who deserve ten thousand deaths! All of you are in cahoots, a real snake pit! You’ve repeatedly tried to kill me. Why should I give you a treasure that I obtained after barely surviving death? Let me tell you, I don’t feel the slightest affection for the Heavenly Dragon Divine Armor College! I’ve even thought that once I completed my divine armor, I would crush the entire Heavenly Dragon Divine Armor College!”

Guo Ran raised his head and roared. The anger that he had been suppressing for so long burst out like lava.

“You… you forget favor and kindness! I knew that you were trash from the start! A little lower world ascender, you all forget your sects in the end!” shouted the Wang family’s Assembly Elder.

“Xue Yifan, take a look! Is this the proxy dean that you chose? Do you hear him? He wants to destroy the entire Heavenly Dragon Divine Armor College!”

“Xue Yifan, you’ve grown muddled with age! Or are you blind? You actually chose him to be the proxy dean! Today, if you don’t give everyone an explanation, how do you have face to continue being the dean?”

The other Assembly Elders shouted their criticisms. Xue Yifan had tried to find trouble for them previously, and now they had a chance to turn the tables on him.

As for Xue Yifan, he continued to ignore the Assembly Elders. Even in front of countless eyes, he had no intention of explaining himself. Everyone was dumbstruck. Just what was going on? Was the dean really thinking about destroying the Heavenly Dragon Divine Armor College? How was that possible?

“Hahaha, do you see? Even now, you still have a bias against me for being a lower world ascender. You arrogant fellows, all of you are prejudiced idiots! For the assembly to be run by vermin like you, what hope is there for the Heavenly Dragon Divine Armor College? If it weren’t for the dean showing me favor, what business would the life and death of you idiots be to me? Why would boss and I work so hard for you? But since the boss agreed, I, Guo Ran, have accepted this work. I will carry it out. But I am no saint, nor do I know how to repay enmity with kindness. Our Dragonblood Legion only repays blood with blood, teeth for teeth. I will settle things right here right now! Dragon Blood Battle Armor!”

Guo Ran’s voice was icy and furious. After that, his Devil Dragon Battle Armor rumbled and countless scales lit up. A majestic dragon cry resounded throughout heaven and earth.

Also, the martial stage beneath Guo Ran’s feet crumbled and the void exploded. Following that dragon cry, Guo Ran seemed to have become a black devil god. He then charged at Wang Zixu. A black saber-image struck the top of the barrier and pierced right through it.

“What?!”

Even late stage World Kings stared in horror at that sight, completely stunned. Now, Long Chen’s pupils shrank slightly, and an expression of disbelief appeared in his eyes.

“This is… the first form of Split the Heavens?”
