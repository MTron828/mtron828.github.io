Chapter 2890 Blood Merging Soul Calling Pill

“Long Chen, you said you had something good for us? What is it? You can tell us now, right?”

Long Chen, Luo Bing, and Luo Ning were sitting in a private room. Luo Ning had asked Long Chen this question repeatedly on the way here, but he refused to say. That vexed her a lot, especially with her impatient nature.

“I remember that your Luo family has a kind of Immortal path bloodline called the Violet Spirit Sacred Blood. Is that correct?” asked Long Chen.

“Yes. Our Luo family has a special bloodline. Once activated, it can unleash limitless power. However…” Luo Ning’s expression grew helplessly.

Long Chen smiled. “The Violet Spirit Sacred Blood’s activation can be split into multiple steps. Right now, you haven’t even activated the first step. Thus, unless you reach the point of no return, you don’t dare to activate it in battle, as this will result in backlash with every activation. If it’s light, your bloodline might regress, but a serious backlash will result in your Spirit Blood drying up. You might even die right there and then. Am I right?”

Luo Bing and Luo Ning nodded. These things were not secret. The Luo family’s bloodline was special, and for Long Chen to be aware of this wasn’t odd.

“Luo Bing, extend your hand,” said Long Chen.

Luo Bing stretched out her hand, but seeing Long Chen also reach out his hand, her expression grew unnatural. However, she still gave him her hand.

Long Chen smiled. “Don’t worry, I would only use shameless methods against someone whose mind is full of dirty thoughts. For a kind person like you, how could I even think of taking advantage?”

He knew that Luo Bing had thought back to the trial hall when he had tricked Luo Ning into giving him her hand. Now Luo Bing didn’t know if he was being serious or messing around again.

“You’re the one with dirty thoughts.” Luo Ning glared at Long Chen, knowing that he was cursing her in a roundabout manner.

Long Chen then pressed three fingers on Luo Bing’s wrist, but not like a physician checking their patient’s pulse. He was checking her bloodline fluctuations.

In truth, placing the hand on the chest was the most direct method of doing this, but if Long Chen suggested such a thing, first ignoring whether or not Luo Bing would assent, Luo Ning would probably slash him directly.

“Your bloodline power is very strong, and your bloodline is very pure. Why are you unable to activate it?” asked Long Chen curiously.

Luo Bing’s bloodline power was like a drawn bow. Immense power was contained within every fluctuation. Once it was released, its power would definitely be astonishing.

For her to not activate this bloodline power, it was like trapping a young eagle in its egg. It was unable to grow past its first growth phase.

“I need to return to the family to activate it with the divine pool’s baptism. However, the Chu family’s sinister plots have managed to cause some problems with the divine pool. Its holy water has become scarce and can only be given to those with the greatest talent. I still have to wait a while until it’s my turn. If I could activate my Violet Spirit Sacred Blood, I wouldn’t be in such a miserable state,” said Luo Bing a bit helplessly.

Long Chen now understood. So this was why there was such a gap between Luo Bing and Chu Kuang’s combat power. It seemed that the Chu family was truly skillful at schemes. It was to the extent that the Luo family even had their foundation affected.

Long Chen said, “I came precisely for this matter. I have a way to activate your Violet Spirit Sacred Blood.”

“Impossible!” Luo Bing and Luo Ning exclaimed together. The requirements to activate the Luo family’s bloodline were extremely special and specific. They needed the secret technique passed down from generation to generation.

“I’m telling you that I can do it. I made two pills that can activate your bloodline.” Long Chen took out two medicinal pills with divine light flowing within them. There was a star revolving inside of them according to a special rhythm.

“A one star top grade pill?! Someone who can refine a one star top grade pill would be an Elder in the Pill Institute! Long Chen, how did you refine such a thing?!” Luo Bing and Luo Ning couldn’t believe their eyes.

Long Chen solemnly said, “At this time, it seems that I no longer have to conceal my status. I’ll tell you the truth. I originally wanted to just be a normal person, but you’ve also seen that even when I want to be low-key, my power doesn’t permit it. I’m actually a reincarnated expert. In my past life, I was a sage of the Pill Dao and stood at the very peak of it. I refined all things within heaven and earth: the stars, the sun, and the moon. I roamed the nine heavens and ten lands, slaying endless demons, ghosts, monsters… Cough, what are you two looking at me like that for? Are you doubting my words?”

Even the dignified Luo Bing was looking at him disdainfully. Luo Ning said, “You misunderstand, we’re not doubting your words. We don’t believe them at all.”

Long Chen was bragging so wildly that it was simply nonsense. What reincarnated expert would act so ridiculously without the slightest mannerism of an expert?

“Fine, if you don’t believe me, whatever. In any case, these pills were refined by me. They are called the Blood Merging Soul Calling Pill. You won’t find such a pill in the Pill Institute. I got the formula from an old man selling dogskin plaster medicine, and I traded two wine bottles and the bottom of a shoe to get it. Its origins are completely trustworthy, so don’t worry. Luo Ning, you can eat it first and have Luo Bing protect you. I’ll wait for you outside. If something bad happens, you can call me at any time.” Long Chen walked out and closed the door.

Now it was just Luo Bing and Luo Ning sitting inside the room. Luo Ning looked at the two pills. “Big sister, do you really think this thing can be consumed? That fellow’s words are always puzzling. I don’t know what is true and what is false.”

“This Long Chen spouts nonsense for small things, but he hasn’t messed around with major things. I trust that he won’t trick us over this. I’ll try it first. You protect me,” said Luo Bing.

“No. I’ll go first.” Luo Ning didn’t give Luo Bing a chance to argue. She directly consumed one of the two pills. As soon as it entered her throat, she shivered. “It’s cold”!

She felt like she had swallowed ice. The coldness spread throughout her whole body in an instant, and she felt like she was almost frozen.

This coldness had just appeared when her almost frozen blood began to heat up. Following that, tremendous power exploded.

Luo Ning’s clothes were blown apart, and violet mist started coming out of her skin, covering her entire body. That violet mist then grew denser and denser until it condensed into violet strands in the air, slowly wrapping around her body.

“Bloodline Condensing Cocoon, Brilliance Reserved!”

Luo Bing stared in shock. Just what kind of pill had Long Chen given them? The highest grade bloodline spirit awakening phenomenon had appeared.

Even if the Luo family’s divine pool was fine, considering their talent, the two of them couldn’t possibly enjoy the highest level bloodline spirit awakening.

Suddenly, the cocoon around Luo Ning ignited and violet flames soared. After that, bloodline power pulsed throughout his body.

“Long Chen, just what kind of existence are you…?” Luo Bing was completely dumbfounded when she saw this phenomenon.
