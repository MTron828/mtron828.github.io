Chapter 4208 Sinister and Treacherous

At some point, a web of blood-colored lines had appeared on top of the blue screen.

It resembled an enormous spider's web enveloping the barrier, with its central hub positioned directly above the heart of the martial stage. The barrier also quivered in tandem with the martial stage.

However, this net gave off a bloody aura. Other than the scarlet blood-colored lines, there were other colors as well.

People could see some kind of energy gathering toward the center, where a circle of light came into view. However, that circle bore an eerie resemblance to the devil’s eye.

“I understand! The Sage King martial stage’s laws have changed. The weak are not fit to live in this world. They are always stepping stones for the strong, and their blood is now the energy used to activate the martial stage!” shouted someone.

Although this was just a guess, people found no way to argue against it. That was because the Blood Qi was all too obvious. In particular, the multiple colors of the Blood Qi in the barrier showed that it was the essence blood of all kinds of lifeforms.

The people following Long Chen were shaken. They were part of those weaklings that would have died if it weren’t for him.

They had purely come here for the experience. Many of them just wanted to say that they had attended the Sage King Convention so that they could brag about it in the future.

After all, this was something that might not occur in millions of years. If they didn’t participate, it would be their lifetime’s regret.

Furthermore, everyone knew that if you were eliminated from the Sage King Convention, you would simply be transported out. However, the rules had somehow changed. This was a fatal competition now.

BOOM!

Just then, that circle shook intensely, and the blood-colored cylinder of light pierced into the core of the martial stage.

The next moment, the entire stage quivered, and multiple light spots appeared on it.

Originally, every staircase was covered in a barrier, typically imperceptible to the naked eye. However, when this blow was launched, cracks appeared on the barriers, rendering them visible to all.

These barriers had initially served as obstacles preventing anyone from accessing the martial stage's core. But when this attack was launched at the core of the martial stage, Long Chen noticed that the central area was also enclosed by its own protective barrier. Astonishingly, within this core region, another martial stage had materialized, mirroring the exact shape and form of the original one. It seemed to be both a minor world as well a projection of the entire Sage King Prefecture.

BOOM!

Another heavy blow struck the central barrier around the core of the martial stage, intending to open it.

The result of this attack was that the central barrier remained completely intact, but the surrounding barriers at the entrances were shattered.

With them destroyed, all the lifeforms were free to charge forward, so experts from all paths poured toward the center.

“Quick, don’t let the other races occupy it! Our human race will take it for ourselves!”

The laws of the Sage King Convention had changed. Thus, no one knew what was happening, but taking the initiative couldn’t be wrong.

As a result, countless experts were rushing over like arrows flying off of a bowstring, all sharing a common purpose and intent.

However, in terms of speed, the demonic beast had the advantage, so they were the first to reach the core.

Rumbling sounds rang out as they attacked the barrier, trying to create a path for themselves.

Even so, their attacks were unable to shake this barrier. Some of their weapons even shattered on contact.RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

“What is going on?”

Those demonic beasts were dumbfounded as they couldn’t break the barrier. At this time, the other races arrived.

Although it was called the core, it was still an area of millions of miles, making it possible for the experts from the various races to attack the barrier.

“This should be a test to see which race is stronger! Attack together!”

The other races crazily assaulted the barrier. However, on the human race’s side, only a portion of them were attacking. Moreover, they were merely probing blows, not like the crazy assaults of the other races.

However, all their attacks were unable to shake the barrier in the slightest. Everyone was dumbfounded.

“Big brother Long Chen, should I try it?”

Long Chen and the others also arrived in front of the barrier. However, Long Chen was lost in thought, and it was Dong Mingyu who spoke. The next moment, a black dagger appeared in her hand. It was precisely the dagger that Long Chen had given her. Dong Mingyu had not encountered anything capable of blocking it so far.

However, this dagger was not something that she usually used. She normally kept it hidden under the orders of her master. Unless she had no other choice, she was not to use this dagger.

Right now, everyone’s attack on the barrier was useless, so Dong Mingyu wanted to see if this dagger could break it. Then they could be the first to occupy the inner martial stage.

“Don’t!” Long Chen shook his head. “This matter is not so simple. I keep feeling like the Sage King Convention this time is off. We should conserve our energy and just wait and see.”

Long Chen had checked the barrier. Even without Xia Chen telling him, he knew that this formation penetrated deep into the ground. It was a barrier connected with heaven and earth’s laws. As a result, there was no opening it, at least not without Dong Mingyu using the mysterious dagger or Long Chen using the Heaven Earth Cauldron.

However, as the situation was still unclear, Long Chen didn’t want to expose his trump cards. In any case, it wasn’t as if he would be the only one not allowed to participate in the Sage King Convention. He’d leave it to others to think of a way through.

Everyone was assaulting the barrier. People suggested that everyone start working together to attack it at the same time from different angles, but it was still useless. After a while, people grew impatient.

“Wait a moment, if the blood of the weak is the crux for activating the formation, then…!” Someone pointed up at the quivering blood net.

The blood net was still quivering but was now powerless to keep attacking. It looked as if it needed new energy.

With that person’s reminder, everyone looked toward Long Chen’s side. More accurately, they were looking at the weaker disciples whom he had brought up with him.

“Long Chen, you’ve broken the rules! Now the martial stage can’t be activated!” From the Xu family’s side, Xu Yifeng immediately pointed and shouted at Long Chen.

Following that, countless experts turned to Long Chen and the others. Xu Yifeng had intentionally shouted so that everyone on the martial stage could hear him clearly.

Long Chen clenched his fists, his killing intent exploding within his eyes. This Xu Yifeng was too malicious. He was trying to get others to do his dirty work. In an instant, Long Chen became the target of all the lifeforms present.
