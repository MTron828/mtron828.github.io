Chapter 3826 Vajra Blood Bat

The five of them were like ants walking through this giant passageway, and they felt completely miniscule.

The further they went, the greater the indescribable pressure grew. At this moment, their hair stood on end.

Also, after reaching a certain point, the Ghost Dao lifeform on Long Chen’s shoulder began crying out.

It told Long Chen that they were entering the danger zone. Any further and they would encounter the ghost-eating monsters.

The other Ghost Dao lifeforms also didn’t dare to lead the way any longer, so they hid behind Long Chen and the others.

As a result, Long Chen and the others carefully crept forward. Long Chen had his dagger in his right hand and a lightning rune revolving in his left hand. He was ready to attack at any moment.

Mo Nian was also in his combat state. Having already reached this point, it didn’t matter how dangerous it was. They had to at least take a look.

Suddenly, they heard footsteps ahead of them. Long Chen then saw an expert in strange clothes walking over. It was an icy-faced middle-aged man with a sword on his back.

Upon seeing him, Long Chen and the others were shocked. This person was a World King. His Blood Qi was as vast as a sea, and his skin was like jade. If it weren’t for the lack of spiritual fluctuations, they wouldn’t even be able to tell that he was dead.

Most importantly, despite having a World King cultivation base, the pressure he gave off was enormous. The space around him constantly twisted fiercely.

When Long Chen and the others were within a certain range, he suddenly paused and raised his head.

The moment he looked at them, sharp pain struck their eyes. Long Chen was shocked. This was an absolutely terrifyingly sharp will. This person must be a sword cultivator!

Once Long Chen recognized his status, without hesitation, he swung his dagger. That expert’s sword was already swinging toward them, but it was cut in two by the sharp dagger.

At this moment, Mo Nian’s shovel swung out but was blocked by the broken sword. Sparks then flew and Mo Nian staggered back.

“How powerful!”

Mo Nian’s heart shook. Despite this person’s sword being broken, despite only having a hilt, he was still able to block Mo Nian’s attack.

After that, this person repeatedly swung his sword. Threads of Sword Qi actually appeared out of his hilt, slicing through the void toward Long Chen and the others.

The broken sword’s Sword Qi made them feel ice-cold. This person was definitely an expert of the Sword Dao.

His main target was Long Chen. Long Chen then cut off this expert’s arm with his dagger, while Mo Nian took advantage of this moment to smack him in the back of his head with his shovel. As a result, that expert tumbled to the ground.

Xia Chen was about to place a talisman on that person’s body when Long Chen’s expression suddenly changed. He shoved Xia Chen aside.

“Watch out!”

Long Chen had just pushed Xia Chen aside when that expert’s remaining hand simply pointed a single finger. Blood-colored sword-light shot out, narrowly flying by Xia Chen’s cheek.

BOOM!

That sword-light struck the ceiling, causing a huge explosive sound and the entire passageway to rock. This person’s power was shocking.

Everyone jumped in shock. This person was absolutely terrifying. Even without a weapon, he could still unleash such a terrifying attack.

After dodging this attack, Xia Chen stuck a talisman on that expert’s head. The talisman glowed, and with a quiver, his body was frozen.

“What a terrifying evil corpse. Fortunately, boss broke his sword right at the start. He probably still has many terrifying moves that he hasn't used yet,” said Guo Ran.

Everyone was shaken. This sword cultivator was incredibly powerful. Fortunately, he hadn’t had much of a chance to unleash that power. Otherwise, they might have died.

“It’s a shame about the sword.”

Guo Ran looked at the broken sword. It was bright like a mirror, so he couldn’t help feeling aggrieved. This was an outstanding divine weapon, but it had been broken by Long Chen.

Long Chen then put away the dagger because it was hard to use in combat. He almost missed just now. If he had, he might have lost his life.Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

It would be better to switch to the Minghong Saber. That would be safer. This dagger wasn’t suited for combat.

“Boss, this person’s body has a trace of primal chaos qi in it. I can use the talisman to draw out the primal chaos qi and store it.”

As they spoke, Xia Chen was studying the corpse. He found that the reason it had not decayed after so many years was because of the support of primal chaos qi in its body.

However, this primal chaos qi was merged with corpse qi, so it couldn’t be directly absorbed, only extracted. After that, they could think of some way of purifying it. The purified primal chaos qi energy could then be used.

If this theory worked, it would be amazing. They could bring the primal chaos qi out of the three thousand worlds. If they gathered enough, then any Dragonblood warriors that hadn’t entered the three thousand worlds would be able to make up for missing this opportunity.

The talisman that Xia Chen placed on the corpse grew brighter and brighter. As for the corpse, it withered gradually, and in the end, it turned into a clump of dust. Without primal chaos qi, its body instantly rotted.

“Senior, my apologies!”

Xia Chen picked up the talisman and bowed to that human expert.

“Dust to dust, earth to earth. I trust that this expert of the Sword Dao would rather turn to dust than live forever in this manner,” said Mo Nian.

This was clearly a generation’s expert, but he was turned into a mindless walking corpse. Such a result was sorrowful.

“Xia Chen, if we encounter more of these corpses, we’ll draw their attention, and you use your sealing talismans on them. We have to work together. These evil corpses are too powerful. Be careful,” said Long Chen.

They continued onwards. All of them were fully focused, not daring to be the slightest bit careless.

Tch.

Out of nowhere, the void flashed and a cold streak of light shot toward Yue Xiaoqian.

Yue Xiaoqian then raised her sword, parrying it. However, the immense power shook her arms, turning them numb. Her expression changed.

“What’s going on?!” Everyone was shocked. None of them had seen anything.

“I don’t know. It seems to be a concealed weapon, but I am not sure either. It was too fast for me to see,” said Yue Xiaoqian. She looked around and was unable to confirm where it was from.

Suddenly, Long Chen swung the Minghong Saber, and a blood-colored light was sent flying, smashing into the wall. The passageway once more rocked.

This time, they managed to see it. It was a small bat the size of a fist, and its entire body was the color of blood. It had sharp claws and fangs, as well as blade-like wings.

“This is the legendary malevolent spirit, the Vajra Blood Bat!” exclaimed Yue Xiaoqian.

The Vajra Blood Bat was a kind of malevolent spirit, with its claws and teeth being toxic. Anyone struck by that toxin would die. Furthermore, its body was incomparably tough. Its teeth, claws, and wings were all natural divine weapons, harder and sharper than immortal metal.

After smashing into the wall, it suddenly flapped its wings and vanished from sight. It actually possessed the ability to conceal itself. The instant it vanished, everyone’s nerves tensed.
