Chapter 4808 Heavenly Dao Seal

At this moment, Bai Letian and the other lead figures of the academy were all in a large hall, and the only one absent was Bai Zhantang.

“Where is the vice palace master?” asked Long Chen.

“He was injured and is in recovery,” answered Bai Shishi’s mother.

“He was injured?” Long Chen was startled. Although Long Chen had never shown respect for Bai Zhantang, it was simply his act of revenge for Bai Zhantang’s prejudice.

However, Long Chen was well aware of the terrifying ghost creature within Bai Zhantang. Their co-existence could be considered somewhat similar to that of Bai Xiaole and the Violet Pupil Nine Tail Fox.

The difference was that Little Nine’s power was limited by Bai Xiaole’s cultivation base. So, if Bai Xiaole wasn’t strong enough, the Violet Pupil Nine Tail Fox would be unable to unleash its full power.

However, Bai Zhantang was different. The ghost creature he was raising was even more terrifying than him. Once he went all-out, his power was most likely not inferior to that of a Heaven Saint.

That was why Bai Letian had sent him back to the Darklight Heaven to look after Long Chen and the others. One reason was to repair his relationship with his children, while another was due to Bai Zhantang's formidable power, crossing the broken sea of stars wasn’t anything difficult. He had enough power to protect himself.

Although Bai Zhantang had never revealed his true power to Long Chen, Long Chen’s sharp intuition allowed him to grasp how strong Bai Zhantang was. When Long Chen said that Bai Xiaole had a chance to defeat Bai Zhantang, that was under the condition that Bai Zhantang wasn’t going all-out and unleashing this ghost creature.

Hence, Long Chen was extremely surprised when he heard that Bai Zhantang was injured. He immediately asked them what had happened.

Bai Xiaole’s mother then explained everything to Long Chen. She had been scouting for a suitable location to establish their camp and had discovered one not too far from the first branch academy.

The first academy was located at a convergence of three dragon veins, an extremely rare feng shui land. Despite the passage of countless millennia and attempts to disrupt them, the dragon veins remained intact. It was these dragon veins that ensured the continued karmic fortune of the first academy.

Currently, the core region was occupied by those terrifying devils, and they didn’t dare to approach it. Additionally, the surrounding regions were teeming with thousands of devil tribes, nearly occupying every inch covered by the three dragon veins.

The place that Bai Xiaole’s mother had found was located at the tail end of a dragon vein. If they set up camp there, they could use the dragon vein to reconnect with the first academy’s karmic luck. Although it was impossible to activate the karmic luck divine spring in this manner, they could guarantee that its almost exhausted karmic luck would no longer flow away.

After meticulous deliberation and numerous calculations, Bai Xiaole's mother selected this particular location as their campsite. She deemed it the safest option overall and the most feasible to seize control of.

Originally, they had planned to take over that spot once Long Chen and the others arrived. However, upon realizing that they were being surveilled by an unknown enemy, they opted to proceed with caution. To avoid alerting their enemies, Bai Zhantang and his two wives decided to silently claim the land for themselves.

Their objective was to establish a transportation formation immediately upon securing the area. This would enable them to swiftly relocate everyone before their enemies could react, thereby minimizing the risk of detection.

However, when the three of them reached the core region of that area, they were shocked to find a Heavenly Dao barrier that instantly suppressed their cultivation bases to the Divine Venerate realm. They hadn’t sensed it at all before this.

By that time, they had snuck deep into this region and were surrounded by devil creatures. Those devil creatures were at least Saints, with some being comparable to Earth Saints, and the devil lord had even reached the Heaven Saint realm.

With their cultivation bases stripped and Bai Shishi’s mother not fully recovered from her wounds, Bai Zhantang was forced to summon his ghost creature. It was only thanks to this that they managed to break through their blockade. However, when they were about to escape, Bai Zhantang received injuries from the devil lord's assault. The lingering devil qi would require some time to be fully purged from his system.

Bai Zhantang was a prideful man, but it was like the heavens were playing tricks on him. What was intended to be a decisive surprise attack had ended in a resounding failure. With or without the injury, he just didn’t have the face to look at Long Chen right now. That was why he didn’t attend this meeting.

“Does that mean that we cannot set up camp in that spot or anywhere within the cover of the dragon veins?” asked Long Chen.

Bai Letian sighed, “I believe that to be the case. Our enemies are truly ruthless, not leaving any angle open for us to take advantage of. I don’t know what they did to the land around the dragon veins to restrict our cultivation bases. Fortunately, we were just scouting. If we had attacked, who knows what would have happened.”

It was fortunate that they hadn’t done anything rash. If the Heavenly Daos sealed their cultivation bases in the middle of their all-out assault, they would be wiped out in one go.

“Can they manipulate the Heavenly Daos like that?” asked Long Chen.

Bai Letian shook his head in response. “It shouldn’t be them. I doubt even Lord Brahma himself has that ability. This restriction is likely a remnant of the primal chaos battle, which left a scar on the Heavenly Daos of this region. However, it is peculiar that they remained unaffected until they entered the core.”

“Rather than manipulating the Heavenly Daos, perhaps they can use the laws here to set up some traps that will be triggered when people enter their territory?” asked Long Chen.

“Based on the situation, that is the only reasonable possibility,” replied Bai Letian, nodding.

“This is a very thorny problem. We have to take over a camp as quickly as possible, as we are racing against time. If we don’t get a foothold in this place, our future will look bleak,” stated Bai Shishi’s mother.

“Moreover, our enemy likely knows about our failure, so they will keep a closer eye on us. It will be even more difficult for us to do anything secretly,” Bai Xiaole’s mother remarked gravely.

Their failure this time was truly dejecting. Bai Letian was being spied on, and the four Heaven Saint Elders were all being watched.

While Bai Zhantang and his wives were only Sage Kings and Bai Shishi’s mother was recently injured, they had the best chance of executing this covert operation. However, they had fallen into a trap and missed the opportunity. It was a bitter pill to swallow. Their predicament had only worsened as a result.

Bai Letian looked at Long Chen and started, “Dean Long Chen—”

Long Chen smiled. Not waiting for Bai Letian to finish speaking, Long Chen patted his chest and said, “Everyone, don’t worry. Leave this matter to me.” Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com
