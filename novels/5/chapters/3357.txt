Chapter 3346 Timely Assistance

Long Chen was delighted. Zheng Wenlong was truly dependable. Anything that was left to him didn’t need to be worried about.

However, seeing how weary he was, Long Chen felt bad. Clearly, Zheng Wenlong had tired himself out for his matter.

Right now, Zheng Wenlong was putting all kinds of precious medicinal ingredients on the table. He then smiled with a pleased expression. It had to be known that he had run all over the place in order to gather these things.

He had personally visited the warehouses of the large auction houses. After all, this was a personal matter, and he couldn’t waste other people’s efforts on his own matters. Most importantly, he didn’t have that much privilege to order people yet. Thus, it truly had been very difficult for him to gather all these medicinal ingredients. Fortunately, he had accomplished this task.

Long Chen put the medicinal ingredients away, and the spirit vegetation ingredients were directly planted in the primal chaos space.

As for ingredients that came from devil beasts and such, there was no way around them. He could only gather them slowly in order to accumulate large enough quantities.

Zheng Wenlong hadn’t brought too many of those ingredients. But Long Chen also wasn’t in a rush to refine the Violet Tower Pills since he hadn’t reached the Divine Lord realm.

Moreover, these ingredients were fourth tier ones and very precious, so buying them in large amounts would be very difficult. Without Zheng Wenlong, there was no way Long Chen could gather enough without at least a few years.

“I have received some information about the Devil Eye Water Lilies. However, one of their complete seed pods is incredibly precious, and furthermore, it must have reached at least the Divine Lord realm. The price is truly shocking. With my limited authority, there is no way for me to get one yet…” said Zheng Wenlong apologetically.

The Huayun Trading Company’s rules were fair. However much ability that you had was how much privilege you were granted. A complete seed pod from a Devil Eye Water Lily? He wasn’t qualified to even touch such a thing yet. If he wanted one, he would need to trade with the auction house himself, and buying on credit would not be accepted.

Thus, Zheng Wenlong felt a bit embarrassed. These treasures existed, but if Long Chen wanted them, he had to bring out money. The things that Long Chen had given Zheng Wenlong had essentially been traded for the medicinal ingredients that he had brought over this time, with almost nothing left over.

“It’s been hard on you. Money is not a problem. I can handle it,” said Long Chen.

“You’ve just taken the position of dean. There are thousands of things to do to maintain such a huge academy, but I can’t help you that much,” said Zheng Wenlong helplessly.

He knew that Long Chen was currently lacking money, but there was nothing he could do. He could only give Long Chen what he had prepared so far. As for the Devil Eye Water Lily, he would slowly think of a way.

“Hahaha, raising an academy can be done. Let me show you something.” Long Chen handed a certain object to Zheng Wenlong.

“Wood Foundation Divine Fruit!”

Zheng Wenlong jumped. He received this fruit in disbelief.

This fruit looked like an apple, except it appeared to be made of wood and was covered in wood veins. Holding it, he felt majestic life energy that refreshed his mind and body.

The Wood Foundation Divine Fruit contained endless life energy. Legend had it that it could revive dead people, creating an entirely new body for them. Although the legends were exaggerated, it was truly a sacred medicine for healing people.Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

It was also a divine object countless wood cultivators dreamed of obtaining. It was a heaven-defying treasure capable of changing a person’s core wood energy.

“It really is a Wood Foundation Divine Fruit. If an ordinary person consumes it, they can directly awaken a primal bloodline. Although it’s only a first generation Wood Foundation Divine Fruit, its price is still astonishing. I will try and see if I can use it as collateral along with my own personal guarantee to get you a seed pod from a Devil Eye Water Lily,” said Zheng Wenlong.

“There’s already no longer a need for a Devil Eye Water Lily. I’ve already got it. But what do you mean by a first generation Wood Foundation Divine Fruit?” asked Long Chen.

Zheng Wenlong stared at him in shock. Long Chen had already gotten a Devil Eye Water Lily? He was truly heaven-defying. He even dared to take the things of the Undying race.

As for his question, Zheng Wenlong explained that the first time that a Wood Foundation Divine Tree bore fruit, it would contain the least amount of energy.

Its fruit proved that it had grown up, but not necessarily that it had reached its limit. A Wood Foundation Divine Tree could continue to grow crazily beyond just the initial time of bearing fruit.

Only once it had borne nine generations of fruit would it reach its limit. The ninth generation fruit was the strongest, and also the most valuable.

As for first generation fruit, the effect was far inferior to the ninth generation, but it was still extremely precious.

However, when comparing priceless treasures, this first generation Wood Foundation Divine Fruit could not compare to a Divine Lord realm Devil Eye Water Lily, let alone an Immortal King realm Devil Eye Water Lily.

Now that Long Chen already had one, he wouldn’t need to buy one from another person for such a high price. He was just waiting.

The black dragon corpses from this time had caused the Wood Foundation Divine Trees to grow larger. Their fruit had matured, and just as Zheng Wenlong said, they grew crazily. They were much thicker, and they grew many times faster than before. If Zheng Wenlong hadn’t said this, Long Chen still wouldn’t have known that this was what was going on.

The Devil Eye Water Lilies were also rapidly growing. With the lily already blooming, an immature seed pod had also grown. Compared to regular water lilies, the Devil Eye Water Lily’s seed pod was not fruit that was born after the lily flower bloomed but something that grew along with the lily flower.

Long Chen saw that the Devil Eye Water Lilies had started to develop. Once it was fully mature, he could take out their seeds and plant them.

In any case, there was still some distance from the Divine Lord realm. He had time to increase the number of ingredients that he had. Based on what he saw, when the Devil Eye Water Lilies sprouted leaves, their aura was equivalent to the Mortal Transcendence realm. When the lily bloomed and the seed pod was born, it was the Divine Flame realm.

Based on their current state, they had reached the equivalent of the Four Peak realm. The lily seeds could be planted.

The Violet Tower Pill’s pill formula required the lily seed from a Devil Eye Water Lily that grew to at least the Divine Lord realm. Otherwise, there was no way for the pill to condense.

Long Chen was in no rush. They could slowly grow. However, he needed to get rid of the huge amount of Wood Foundation Divine Fruit on his hands now.

“Brother Wenlong, is it easy to sell the Wood Foundation Divine Fruit?” asked Long Chen.

“Of course. This thing can be said to have limitless demand,” said Zheng Wenlong.

“What if I were to give you a hundred thousand of them at once? Could you quickly turn them into the resources that I need?” asked Long Chen.

“What…?”

Zheng Wenlong was so moved that he almost crushed the fruit in his hand. A hundred thousand Wood Foundation Divine Fruit?

When a hundred thousand Wood Foundation Divine Fruit appeared in front of him, he almost went down on both knees. This was an incalculable wealth.

Long Chen told him to quickly sell them for materials to construct a palace and formations. He wanted to turn the seventh branch academy into a supreme sect.

The head academy only provided him with the bare minimum for them to protect themselves. If he wanted an upgrade, he needed to burn money. This place would be Long Chen’s dominion in the future, so he had to build some iron walls to make a haven he could return to.

The day after Zheng Wenlong left, an ocean’s worth of resources came. The craftsmen that had been about to return to the head academy after finishing their mission were then summoned by Long Chen. In front of their dumbfounded gazes, Long Chen directly announced:

“Strengthen all the formations to the highest level, the level that can instantly kill a World King.”
