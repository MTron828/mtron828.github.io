Chapter 4123: Heavenly Tiger Race

Long Chen and the others went to the Silver Moon World to bid farewell to Xu Jianxiong. Although there were still two months until the Sage King Convention formally started, they were too impatient to wait, so they all wanted to arrive early and take a look.

As a result, when they arrived in the Silver Moon World, they found that the atmosphere was off, and the plaza was filled with a group of unexpected guests.

All of them were large and muscular with powerful Blood Qis. Adding on their wild auras, they were clearly from a powerful demonic beast race.

Their leader was an elder with a terrifying aura, and the pressure he exuded was on the same level as Xu Jianxiong. He was clearly another natural Heaven Venerate.

Shockingly, there were over twenty Heaven Venerates behind him, and the most unbelievable thing was that several of them were the traitors of the Fullmoon race.

Back then, Xu Jianxiong hadn’t killed them, and now, they dared to brazenly return.

Seeing these traitors, the experts of the Fullmoon race had dark expressions. If looks could kill, those traitors would have died a thousand times over.

When Long Chen and the others arrived, both sides had weapons drawn. The Fullmoon experts had gathered, looking like they might attack at any moment.

As for the opposing experts, they were haughty, looking as if they viewed the Fullmoon race with contempt.

Everyone’s attention turned to Long Chen and the others when they arrived. While looking at Long Chen, the powerful leader on the other side sneered.

“The Fullmoon race really has declined. You’ve dirtied yourself with the association of the despicable human race, and now, the proof is undeniable. What do you have to say for yourselves?”

Xu Jianxiong was not present, so it was the seventh uncle who replied, “Since when did matters of the Fullmoon race have anything to do with your Heavenly Tiger race? Your claws have stretched far today. Speaking of the human race, aren’t you servants of Lord Brahma? Is Lord Brahma not part of the human race?”

Long Chen and the others walked into the plaza at this time. Just from what he saw, he could guess what was happening. However, now that he had condensed the seven Star Battle Armor, he feared no one. Even a natural Heaven Venerate was not an existence that Long Chen feared.

“What a joke. Who do you think they are? How can they compare to Lord Brahma? They’re just ants,” sneered one of the traitors from the Fullmoon race.

As soon as he spoke, Long Chen vanished, shooting toward the Heavenly Tiger race’s people.

“How brazen!”

The leader roared furiously. Long Chen dared to attack his people in front of him? His fingers were like claws reaching straight toward Long Chen.

However, what no one expected was that he grabbed nothing more than an afterimage, not even touching Long Chen’s sleeve.

Long Chen was too fast, so fast that even he couldn’t stop him. By the time he wanted to attack again, Long Chen had already left.

Long Chen simply reappeared in his original location as if nothing had happened. The only difference was that he now had the traitor of the Fullmoon race in his hand.

As his throat was caught in Long Chen’s hand, he was terrified; his fearless self when he was standing amongst the Heavenly Tiger race was gone. In the blink of an eye, his life was in Long Chen’s hand.

“Ants? If I am an ant, what are you?” asked Long Chen.

A strange sound came from the traitor’s mouth, but he was unable to even say anything. Under Long Chen’s control, he didn’t dare to even move.

The elder of the Heavenly Tiger race roared, “Damn human race, you only dare to do a sneak attack! Release him, otherwise-” Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Long Chen tossed the traitor to the ground, causing the latter to hack up blood and faint. Long Chen then kicked him to the seventh uncle.

“I don’t have the authority to deal with the Fullmoon race’s traitors.”

The seventh uncle looked at the traitor in his miserable state and had the urge to crush him right now, but he endured. He waved his hand, summoning people to drag him away and imprison him.

“Long Chen, these people came to humiliate us. The race leader is in seclusion and at a critical juncture, while Changchuan is in the midst of a metamorphosis and cannot come out. The Fullmoon race is a pack of dragons with no leader at this moment. Can you help us?” transmitted the seventh uncle.

All the Fullmoon race’s experts had seen Long Chen’s methods. Long Chen did not lose to anyone in terms of martial power or intelligence.

Even the race leader had said that if something major happened while he was in seclusion, they should ask Long Chen. Thus, the seventh uncle also sighed with relief upon seeing Long Chen arrive.

The seventh uncle knew that he was too old, lacking Long Chen’s courage and daring. Even the race leader trusted Long Chen so much, so he was also willing to listen to Long Chen.

Long Chen was startled. The race leader’s bottleneck had loosened after fighting the dark domain lord repeatedly, so he needed to go into seclusion to digest his gains. This was something that Long Chen knew.

However, for Xu Changchuan to not awaken even after all this time, he was surprised. It seemed that Xu Changchuan would be completely transformed once he came out.

“Bastard! He is a member of the Heavenly Tiger race! Are you declaring war against the Heavenly Tiger race?!” roared the elder.

“This person is one of the Heavenly Tiger race’s vice leaders. Just like our race leader, he is a natural Heaven Venerate, and so is the other vice leader. They also occupy a life-forbidden area, but they don’t border the dark gate, so their domain is not attacked. Naturally, they can grow peacefully. The Heavenly Tiger race was in the first batch of people in the life-forbidden area to join Lord Brahma, and they usually don’t get along with us. For them to come today, one reason is to humiliate us, but the other reason is to probe our bottom line. Currently, many of our experts are growing rapidly thanks to the new influx of medicinal pills. However, we’ve sealed a portion of their power to avoid this being exposed. Unfortunately, these people are going too far. I’m not sure what to do with them. Should we fight them by exposing our power?” transmitted the seventh uncle.

Long Chen came to a sudden understanding. No wonder he sensed something off with the Fullmoon race’s experts. So they had sealed a portion of their power.

“So that’s the case. No problem. Leave it to me. I’m very skilled in diplomacy,” said Long Chen. He turned to the Heavenly Tiger race’s elder with a bright smile. “Wow, I cannot believe that I was so blind. It truly is a case of mistaking a golden jar as a chamberpot. So you are the vice leader of the Heavenly Tiger race. I’ve been rude.”

Long Chen actually reached out a hand to shake hands with this elder.

This elder snorted coldly. “Who do you think you are? Scram! The Fullmoon race had best hand over my people, otherwise-”

Before he finished speaking, Long Chen’s extended hand struck him in the face.
