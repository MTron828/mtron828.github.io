Chapter 2524 Pressing Forward

The entire battlefield followed Long Chen’s actions. Nangong Zuiyue, Beitang Rushuang, Zi Yan, and the others shot after him.

At the same time, the disciples of the Illusive Music Immortal Palace unleashed waves of divine music and gentle light that enveloped their allies, making them feel like their senses had suddenly sharpened. It was as if they had an extra pair of eyes giving them a bird’s-eye view.

They could even feel the slightest vibrations in the air and every bit of qi flowing around them. Even in this battle involving millions of experts, they could sense everything clearly.

Every expert would be affected by such a large-scale battle. Their perception and reaction speed would weaken, the degree of which depended on their Spiritual Strength.

People with stronger Spiritual Strength had far sharper senses toward their surroundings, and as a result, it was much more difficult to launch a sneak attack against them. They would automatically sense someone within the range of their divine sense.

Only an assassin on the level of Dong Mingyu would be able to trick the senses of such sharp people. By the time she struck, it would be too late to stop her.

In battle, a person’s senses could stretch a thousand miles easily. But only a small core region could be sensed clearly. The further away, the more indistinct their senses would be.

In a chaotic battle like this, those senses were suppressed even further. With the endless Heaven Devouring Black Armor Corps around them, there was no way for most experts to properly sense things. By the time the Black Armor Corps entered their attack range, they would have no time to react.

However, the zither music instantly cleared up the chaos. In fact, they felt as if their senses were sharper than on a perfectly calm day.

When a bone blade stabbed toward their back, they perfectly grasped its angle, power, and the identity of the attacker.

It was like a blind person was suddenly able to see the world. They all felt as if they had become the masters of their own fate. It was difficult to explain with words.

The Illusive Music Immortal Palace’s divine arts were now displayed in the largest scale battle, shocking Long Chen and the others. It stimulated their desire to fight.

With such sharp senses, they were able to easily dodge and counter the attacks of the Black Armor Corps as they passed through them.

“Wind Splitting Arrow!”

After Mo Nian’s first arrow, a second arrow came from Beitang Rushuang. The two of them kept the path open through the Black Armor Corps, preventing them from sealing the way.

Originally, Chu Yao, Meng Qi, and the others were going to assist with this task to save Mo Nian and Beitang Rushuang’s energy, but Beitang Rushuang stopped them.

“We’re not skilled at close-range and group battles. Our power is best used at this time. You save your energy for the more intense battle coming up,” said Beitang Rushuang.

Beitang Rushuang was well aware that the Dragonblood Legion excelled in a close-range chaotic battle. Hence, she and Mo Nian focused their full efforts on opening a path for them. The rest would be up to Long Chen and the others.

Suddenly, explosions began to ring out from behind, startling Long Chen. He looked back.

“What?!”

Following his movements, the entire Luo Spirit race had also decided to charge through the channel. They were like a giant dragon charging through the Black Armor Corps.

The millions and millions of Luo Spirit race experts charged with their Life Spirit God. They were undergoing a full-force onslaught, becoming his strongest shield at the rear.

Long Chen’s heart pounded. Did they really believe that he was the prophesied son? That was supposed to be Yun Tian!

He looked toward Yun Tian and saw that he and Yu Qingxuan had vanished from sight. There were some sparks of fire as well as Sword Qi in the distance. It seemed that the two of them had resumed their battle. However, they were too far, and the Black Armor Corps blocked Long Chen’s vision.

The Dragonblood Legion, the Martial Heaven Alliance, the Xuan Beasts, the Beitang family, the Nangong family, and the Illusive Music Immortal Palace’s disciples were all charging with him. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

The Luo Spirit race had even entrusted their future to him, so he could not retreat at this time. If he failed, he wouldn’t have the face to keep living.

Long Chen clenched his teeth, and his gaze landed on the Heaven Devouring Fiend King. A sharp light appeared in his eyes. It seemed that he would really be risking his life this time.

“Long Chen, you’re so stupid. You’ve only caused everyone on your side to die. People of the Martial Heaven Alliance, hear me. My only targets are Long Chen and the Dragonblood Legion. As long as you leave right now, I, Ye Ming, swear not to touch you,” shouted Ye Ming.

However, not one disciple of the Martial Heaven Alliance hesitated or even twitched at all. Their gazes were firm.

It was unknown how many people from the Martial Heaven Alliance had originally felt that Long Chen would have a bad end sooner or later. They hadn’t had a high opinion of him.

However, despite trial after trial, he had yet to fall. He had created countless miracles on his journey, trampling over one powerful opponent after another.

Back in the day, Long Chen had even announced that he was leaving the Martial Heaven Alliance in order to relieve it of the pressure of facing the entire world. He had cast all that danger onto himself and still survived that tribulation.

However, whenever the Martial Heaven Alliance was in danger, Long Chen would stand up for it. This had affected this entire generation of young heavenly geniuses.

Their blood was all fiery. Now, the Martial Heaven Alliance’s fate was tightly bound to them and also Long Chen.

Helping Long Chen was helping themselves. Even if they were facing the divine families and the endless Black Armor Corps, their determination was not rattled. Ye Ming’s poison was useless.

Mo Nian and Beitang Rushuang continued to unleash powerful arrows that pierced through the Black Armor Corps. In just a few short breaths, they had shot hundreds of arrows.

As they were flying, a splash of blood appeared on Beitang Rushuang’s white robes.

“Rushuang!”

Only now did Nangong Zuiyue notice that Beitang Rushuang’s right hand was bleeding heavily. Her fingers had been badly damaged by the bowstring.

Shooting such powerful arrows at this speed was clearly pushing herself too much. At the same time, everyone noticed that Mo Nian was the same. His right hand had turned red from blood.

“It’s fine. Conserve your energy. We’ll open the path.” Beitang Rushuang clenched her teeth. With every arrow, blood splashed. Her face and hair were also stained by her blood. Despite that, she continued unleashing arrows with her full power.

Ye Ming had taken note of what was going on with them, so he commanded the Black Armor Corps to gather and block them.

The four divine generals in particular were incredibly powerful. Even if they were just revived corpses, they were still not something Netherpassage experts could handle.

Furthermore, as corpses, they had no sense of pain. They were like puppets. They had been shot with hundreds of arrows by the elders of the Luo Spirit race, but their combat power had not dropped. They were even more difficult to deal with than the living Black Armor Corps.

The Luo Spirit race’s arrows were blessed by the Life Spirit God, giving them immense penetrative power. They were even sharper than divine items. If the four divine generals were alive, they wouldn’t be able to ignore the arrows so easily.

Fortunately, the four divine generals were still tied down by the elders. They were unable to block Long Chen and the others.

Thanks to Mo Nian and Beitang Rushuang, Long Chen and the others quickly reached the altar.

“Long Chen, it’s up to you now!” called Mo Nian.

“Don’t worry, if I can’t eliminate this fiend king, I’ll kill myself as an apology.” Long Chen took a deep breath and suddenly took out the Demon Moon Furnace. Flames burst out of it, igniting the world. “I’ll show you the purest karmic hell flames from Purgatory.”
