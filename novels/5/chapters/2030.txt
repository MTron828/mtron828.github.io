Long Chen spent the better part of a day flying before he saw a set of divine pillars in the distance. Each pillar had an expert sitting on top of it.

On those pillars, he saw Di Feng, Xie Luo, and the like. It seemed that this place was specially arranged for awakening their manifestations.

They were square pillars hundreds of meters tall, and the light of the Grand Dao bathed them. Di Feng and the others had formed a whirlpool of Heavenly Dao energy above them, absorbing the energy.

Long Chen also saw Xiong Tianba in the distance. He was in a meditative state, his manifestation active behind him as he communed with the Heavenly Daos.

There were only one hundred and eight of the pillars. However, they weren’t all occupied by Pill Valley. In fact, they were mostly occupied by experts from other powers.

“Senior apprentice-brother Long Chen, don’t go any further! There’s a barrier head. If you go any further, you’ll be killed.” Someone in the distance suddenly shouted to Long Chen.

Long Chen turned over, only to find that there were actually even more experts seated in the nearby areas. His attention had been focused on the divine pillars, but when he looked around, he saw tens of thousands of people.

“What’s going on?” Long Chen walked over to that person.

Amongst these people, Long Chen saw many hostile gazes. It seemed that most of these people were loyal to Pill Valley. They hadn’t wasted any time in the outer regions, instead charging over to this place.

However, there were also some neutral experts that had ended up running into this place without any information.

“Ah, there’s actually a formation guarding this place. No wonder I didn’t notice them.” When Long Chen walked over, he found that fluctuations were enveloping this place. There was a faint divine light present. It seemed that this area was also suited to comprehending the Grand Dao, but the effect was not as good as the divine pillars.

The neutral disciple that had warned Long Chen ignored the other disciples’ gazes. He said, “We were conned. The so-called opportunities and chances were all left to their own people. Those who arrived at this place earliest were locked onto the divine light and have its power focused on them. As for others who arrived later, the divine light mostly ignores us. This was all a con,” said that disciple hatefully.

“Yes, it was a trap. We almost fell for it, but thankfully you let us in without that oath,” said another disciple.

There were hundreds of experts who walked forward to Long Chen now to explain what had happened.

These people had arrived late. Even though they were enveloped by the divine light, it didn’t acknowledge them. The formation’s Grand Dao energy was given to those that had arrived first.

The ones who had arrived first were Pill Valley’s loyal supporters. They were receiving this special treatment. In other words, even for neutral experts that had decided to use the barrier breaking beads and swear loyalty to Pill Valley, they wouldn’t be getting as good of treatment as the original supporters. The true benefits weren’t for them.

That was why these disciples directly came to report what had happened to Long Chen. They longed for Long Chen to destroy this place as well. If they couldn’t obtain any benefits, then no one should obtain anything either.

Long Chen looked at the disciples seated within the divine light. Those disciples’ expressions instantly changed. They began gathering energy, preparing for a fight.

Long Chen indifferently said, “Don’t worry, the money you paid means I won’t attack you. It’s the same for them.” Long Chen pointed to Di Feng and the others who were on the stone pillars. “However, I should warn you that even if you manage to awaken your manifestation, you should think carefully about whether or not you really want to be my enemy. If you raise your weapon against me, that money will no longer protect you.”

Those experts’ hearts shook. It seemed that Long Chen didn’t care about them in the slightest. In fact, he didn’t even care about Di Feng, Xie Luo, Xiong Tianba, and the others.

To the disciple that warned him, Long Chen said, “Many thanks for your warning. But there’s something I want inside, so I’m going in.”

Long Chen directly walked closer to the divine pillars. They looked to be arranged in a haphazard manner, but Long Chen’s intuition told him that it was a gate.

Seeing Long Chen enter, that disciple wanted to warn him to be careful. Some people had been drawn over to the divine pillars before, but they had been annihilated by the divine light without the slightest ability to resist.

As expected, as soon as Long Chen got close, a ray of divine light descended from the sky, crashing down on Long Chen mercilessly.

However, with a swing of Evilmoon, the light shattered. Long Chen was forced back a couple of steps.

“How ferocious!” The disciples watching were stunned by this sight.

The world shook intensely as Long Chen shattered the divine light. Scintillating golden light gathered, and a majestic palace slowly revealed itself before their eyes.

This palace was absolutely giant and soared high into the sky. Every brick and tile sparkled with divine light. Everyone stared in shock at it.

Once the palace appeared, the position of the divine pillars also changed. They actually formed two orderly rows leading to the palace.

As for the experts meditating atop the pillars, they were startled awake by this. They also stared in shock at the palace.

“So this is the Brahma secret realm’s greatest inheritance land!”

“What do those words mean? Why do they seem so powerful?”

Everyone stared in shock at the palace. Three golden words shone brightly on the palace. Those words caused their souls to shake.

They were not immortal characters. No one recognized them.

“Brahma Divine Palace?”

However, while Long Chen didn’t recognize them, these words came popping out of his mouth instinctively. Killing intent appeared in his eyes.

Di Feng and the others who were on the stone pillars didn’t dare to move. They were enveloped by overwhelming divine pressure from the palace.

Long Chen walked forward toward the palace. As soon as he entered the range of the divine pillars, they all lit up at once, and one hundred and eight divine swords pierced toward Long Chen.

The distant experts all jumped in horror. Despite their distance, they could sense the terrifying power of those divine swords.

“You broken Brahma shrine, I’m giving you face by deigning to enter, but you dare to stop me?”

For some reason, Long Chen’s fury soared. With a cold snort, he charged forward, attacking those divine swords.

“Stop, stop! It hurts! They’re entirely condensed of divine energy!” shouted Evilmoon. But in Long Chen’s fury, he didn’t hear. His divine ring suddenly appeared behind him.

The world shook intensely. The divine pressure coming from the palace was forced back as a domineering will expanded.

“You dare to stop me? Be destroyed!”

Long Chen actually forced his way in front of one of the divine pillars and attacked it.

“Bastard, stop!”

The ancient race expert on top of it shouted, but his shout didn’t stop Long Chen. Evilmoon slashed into the divine pillar.

That giant pillar tumbled to the ground. As for the whirlpool above the ancient race expert’s head, it vanished.

The ancient race expert was furious, but the distant spectators smiled. When that whirlpool vanished, they sensed the surrounding Grand Dao energy grow denser. Clearly, without him absorbing it, they could absorb more. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

Due to the appearance of the Brahma Divine Palace, countless experts were drawn over. They saw a piercing light coming from here, and they flew quickly.

Seeing Long Chen, one of those disciples excitedly shouted, “Senior apprentice-brother Long Chen, you can do it! Destroy this place too!”

These disciples were now clear on Pill Valley’s con, and they were infuriated. The more trouble Long Chen caused, the happier they were.

However, while they were happy, the experts on top of the divine pillars turned green. Long Chen was now charging toward another pillar.
