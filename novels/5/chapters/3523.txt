Chapter 3512

“How can this wine have a flaw? This is the wine from the Wine God Palace! Long Chen, don’t mess around!” reminded Yu Qingxuan kindly.

No matter how pure she was, she could still sense that the atmosphere was a bit off. These people were clearly digging a hole for Long Chen.

Even a drop of the Wine God Palace’s wine was something that couldn’t be bought with all the gold in the world. Hence, no one dared to say that the Wine God Palace's wine was bad. If Long Chen said it and was caught, it wouldn’t be good.

Long Chen smiled. “In this world, there is nothing that is perfect, let alone wine. This Pear Flower Wine’s greatest flaw is that it was made using rootless water.”

“What is rootless water?” asked Yu Qingxuan.

“Rootless water refers to rainwater, and it is the kind of rainwater that is condensed naturally in pure lands, untouched by any impurity. This rootless water is the most often-used water to make wine and tea and is the cleanest water that’s directly extracted from the air. Naturally, it is not affected by the five elements and does not affect the taste of the wine or tea. However, it is not suitable for the Pear Flower Wine. If instead it was morning dew that was used, it should be a bit better,” said Long Chen.

“You actually know so much about the Wine Dao. Truly amazing,” said Yu Qingxuan.

“The Wine Dao has a million kinds of water inside it, let alone the endless techniques for making the wine. The Wine Dao is also a Grand Dao, just as marvelous as the Pill Dao. They are different methods to get to the same end,” said Long Chen.

“You actually know the Pill Dao as well?” asked Yu Qingxuan with surprise.

“I know a little bit,” said Long Chen modestly.

“To dare to say you know a bit in front of fairy Qingxuan, I really admire your guts. Do you know that fairy Qingxuan’s Pill Dao is unrivaled? She is the only one in the Violet Flame Heaven’s history to refine a peerless grade golden pill in the Divine Lord realm.” Everyone else immediately laughed at Long Chen’s response.

Yu Qingxuan’s strongest point was actually her alchemy skill. Long Chen dared to mention alchemy in front of her?

“A peerless grade golden pill? Then doesn’t that mean that you have reached the realm where your soul has returned to nothingness, and your will holds the world?” Long Chen was surprised. He stared at Yu Qingxuan in disbelief.

This so-called ‘soul returns to nothing, will holds the world’ was a saying amongst alchemists. It referred to when a person’s spirit had reached the point of seeing through the essence of the ten thousand Daos. It was a kind of realm that most people could not imagine.

Only when one’s mental realm reached that level could they refine golden pills. Long Chen himself had not reached that level yet.

Furthermore, a peerless grade pill referred to how only one such pill could exist within the nine heavens and ten lands. There would never be a second pill like it.

The immortal world’s pills were graded according to low grade, middle grade, high grade, top grade, and peerless grade. These pills were further differentiated as spirit pills, treasure pills, and golden pills.

Ninety-nine percent of the pills sold on the marketplace were spirit pills, and treasure pills were very rarely seen. As for golden pills, Long Chen had never seen one yet. Even after plundering so many treasuries of the Soaring Dragon Company, he hadn’t seen a single golden pill. From this, it could be seen just how rare they were.

Long Chen’s mental realm still wasn’t high enough to refine golden pills. As for peerless grade golden pills, almost no one had ever seen them before because they were unique existences within heaven and earth. It was said that within the restrictions of the Heavenly Daos, two peerless grade golden pills could not appear at once.

If a person refined a peerless grade golden pill, and another person in another place refined the same peerless grade golden pill, then one of those would definitely be destroyed beneath the Heavenly Daos. It was because there was only one that it was called peerless.

A peerless grade pill had to have reached the level of a golden pill. Furthermore, those who could refine a peerless grade golden pill required not just masterful alchemy arts and powerful Spiritual Strength, but also strong mental energy that could control the Heavenly Daos. Adding on about ninety-nine percent luck, it might be possible for one to refine a peerless grade golden pill.

Thus, Long Chen truly was shocked. He hadn’t thought that in this world, the Pill Fairy really would still be the Pill Fairy. Her alchemy was as amazing as ever.

“You know about the soul returns to nothingness, the will holds the world. That means that you really are an alchemy master. You don’t know just a little bit!” Yu Qingxuan was also surprised.

“No, I really am not being modest. I really do only know a bit about alchemy. After all, refining pills is my secondary profession,” said Long Chen with a smile.

“Then what is your main profession?” asked Yu Qingxuan curiously.

“My main profession is looting,” said Long Chen a bit bashfully.

“Liar.”

Yu Qingxuan laughed, refusing to believe Long Chen.

Feng Xiang and the others had originally believed that they had grasped an opportunity to mock Long Chen, but it seemed that Long Chen truly was skilled in alchemy. Now, they were dumbfounded. Were they just there to make Long Chen look better?

Yu Qingxuan’s smile when she looked at Long Chen was particularly infuriating. They didn’t know what they felt in their hearts.

At this moment, Feng Xiang and the others exchanged a glance. After snapping their fingers, attendants came forth with a small golden plate. When the plate’s cover was opened, it revealed a swallow’s nest the size of a baby’s fist.

The swallow nest was blood-red. It was dense, with thread marks on top. Also, it emitted intense flame fluctuations as if it was actually burning. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

“Fairy Qingxuan, this is a high level Golden Silk Blood Swallow’s nest. It is truly a top tier item and contains Heavenly Dao runes inside of it. You must try it,” said Feng Xiang.

This swallow nest looked very beautiful, and Yu Qingxuan did like it. With a smile, she thanked Feng Xiang. This kindness required at least a thanks.

Yu Qingxuan’s smile delighted Feng Xiang. He felt like he had finally won a round, so he couldn’t help looking at Long Chen.

“You can try it as well. This thing is truly precious. A normal person wouldn’t even see it in their lifetime. To tell the truth, if it weren’t for fairy Qingxuan, I wouldn’t be willing to give such a thing to a stranger.”

However, when Long Chen looked at the swallow nest, he didn’t reveal any expression. As Yu Qingxuan picked it up, seeing Long Chen wasn’t moving, she couldn’t help asking, “What is it?”

“Don’t eat it. Otherwise, you’ll regret it.” Long Chen shook his head.

“You…!”

Feng Xiang was enraged. He had always found Long Chen dislikeable, and now Long Chen actually advised Yu Qingxuan not to eat his gift?! This was clearly targeting him.

In their fight against Long Chen, he and the others had always been at a disadvantage. Now that he finally took out a treasure that could move fairy Qingxuan, Long Chen actually said such a thing, enraging him.

Yu Qingxuan was startled. She didn’t understand. But ultimately, she slowly put the swallow nest back. She looked at Long Chen, hoping for him to continue speaking.

“Long Chen, you’re going too far, aren’t you? Brother Feng Xiang made such an effort to treat you. That’s clearly enough to show his magnificent hospitality. But you keep going against him. Why? Even a dog knows to shake its tail to express its thanks once it eats someone else’s food. As for you?” Zhao Mingxuan directly stood up and pointed at Long Chen.

“If you want to shake your tails, then go ahead. I’m not a dog. What does that have to do with me?” said Long Chen disdainfully.

“You…!”

With that, Long Chen had essentially offended all of them. Their killing intent exploded.

“Long Chen, what is going on? Why do you think I shouldn’t eat this swallow nest? Will it be harmful?” asked Yu Qingxuan hastily to distract everyone.

“Yes, it will definitely harm you.”

Long Chen nodded, causing Feng Xiang’s expression to sink. That appearance was like he wanted to tear Long Chen apart. As for those two World Kings, they looked at him with astonishment.
