Chapter 3338 Leaving the Heavenly Rainbow Domain

After coming out of his private room, Long Chen saw thousands of Immortal Kings from the Heavenly Rainbow Domain. They were all representatives of their sects that had participated in the battle, and they possessed their own backgrounds and statuses.

Altogether, they represented almost the whole Heavenly Rainbow Domain’s core forces. When they saw that Long Chen was still wearing an eyepatch, they sighed.

In the battle, Long Chen had used a kind of pupil art to try to forcibly save the Heavenly Rainbow Fairy. At that time, blood had flowed out of his eye, and it had even become covered in cracks. Clearly, that technique exceeded his limits. Hence, they thought that his eye was probably permanently damaged.

Seeing that eyepatch, they were all very grateful to him. It could be said that Long Chen had done his utmost to save the Heavenly Rainbow Fairy. They had all witnessed him be willing to even throw his life away for her.

“Dean Long Chen, your injuries aren’t fully healed yet. Why don’t you stay a bit longer in the Heavenly Rainbow Domain? Don’t worry, whether it’s the Nine Underworld Hall, the Bloodkill Hall, or any others, if they dare to come, we will fight to the death against them,” said an elder. His aura was quite heavy. Moreover, others looked at him reverently. This person definitely possessed a certain authority within the Heavenly Rainbow Domain.

However, while his aura was terrifying, his Blood Qi had started to decline. He was already on a downhill path, and his longevity was about to run out. If Long Chen’s guess was correct, he was an Earth tier Immortal King, a figure on the level of a living fossil.

“Senior is too courteous. The Heavenly Rainbow Fairy gave me her favor first and then even lent a helping hand to me. But I could only watch as she died. I feel terrible,” said Long Chen apologetically. Despite everything, he still felt very guilty over her death. He felt like he had a responsibility.

“The Heavenly Rainbow Fairy will never die. As long as we reconstruct her divine statue and worship her every day, she will return,” said that elder confidently. He was clearly a devout follower of the Heavenly Rainbow Fairy.

Long Chen sighed inside. He couldn’t bear to tell them that the Heavenly Rainbow Fairy was gone forever. She would never be back.

It was just as she said. The snow was still snow, but was this year’s snow the same as yesterday’s snow?

However, her words also contained the grandeur of a wise sage. Although she was no longer present, her teachings would remain and continue to be passed down from generation to generation. Perhaps when the new snow fell, it would continue to be sacred and holy. Could that new snow take her place?

Looking at these elders, Long Chen suddenly felt like he somehow understood the true meaning of her words. He felt even greater reverence for her now.

“You are right. As long as you still have her in your heart, the Heavenly Rainbow Fairy will definitely return.” Long Chen nodded.

Hearing that, the Heavenly Rainbow Domain’s experts were very happy. It was unacceptable for others to question their firm belief.

“Long Chen, we will all testify for you that the rumor of you being an underworld ghost seed is simply slander. Anyone who questions you will be viewed as our enemy. Someone that the Heavenly Rainbow Fairy chose couldn’t possibly be an underworld ghost seed. By suspecting you, they are suspecting the Heavenly Rainbow Fairy. We won’t allow such a thing,” said that elder solemnly.

Previously, the matter of the underworld ghost seed had caused quite a few turbulent waves, making people nervous. After all, how could they determine the truth?

With the powers like the Nine Underworld Hall and the Bloodkill Hall pushing the rumor on, it had quite the effect.Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

Through an investigation, it was found that this rumor was started by the Yuhua Palace’s Jiang Weizhong. Although Jiang Weizhong was already dead, once a rumor spread, it was like wildfire.

Starting a rumor was easy, but putting it out was difficult. Most troublesome of all was that Long Chen had used the power of the Purgatory Eyes here in the Heavenly Rainbow Domain. That terrifying destructive power was very similar to the sinister energy of the dark lifeforms. It was very easy for people to question him.

Thankfully, the Heavenly Rainbow Domain had started the process of refuting this rumor. Anyone who dared to spread it would be executed. But this rumor had long since spread to other domains.

The Heavenly Rainbow Domain’s experts could only testify for Long Chen, but they had no actual proof. Just the attitude of the Heavenly Rainbow Fairy toward Long Chen was not enough.

Long Chen smiled. “Seniors have been troubled. There’s no need to mind those rumors. I have never cared about such things. If others believe those rumors and attack me, then I never care whether their intentions are good or bad. I will still kill them all. I am unable to embody the kindness of the Heavenly Rainbow Fairy that forgives even people who harm her, and I have never wanted to become some virtuous sage. Anyone who tries to take my life, I will cut them down mercilessly. Seniors, please don’t waste your effort on those rumors. If you have the extra time, properly raise your disciples. This world’s era of peace is probably about to end. We cannot always hope for others to protect us. We must be strong ourselves in order to survive.”

Everyone nodded. This time, the battle that had occurred here was extremely odd, so odd that it made people uneasy.

Long Chen knew Yan Xu, and he knew Lord Brahma’s power. But not everyone knew so many secrets. Long Chen could only warn them, but not tell them too much to avoid some unexpected karma befalling them.

The Heavenly Rainbow Domain’s experts wanted him to stay longer, but Long Chen tactfully refused. They then brought him to the plaza.

The statue had been destroyed, but craftsmen were working on rebuilding it. Long Chen then came to the same place he had gone before and bowed deeply. It was a kind of goodbye.

After that, all the Heavenly Rainbow Domain’s experts sent him off. They provided him with a luxurious flying boat. Originally, Long Chen tried to refuse them, but they refused to let him leave without it.

In order to make sure that he was safe, they even put up fake information of him leaving in five different directions, while he actually left through a secret passage.

Long Chen had been unconscious for three days. During these three days, the matter of this immense battle had rapidly spread.

This was a huge affair that drew countless people’s attention. But the most shocking thing was how Long Chen had killed those dark lifeforms and displayed such shocking combat power.

The most worrisome thing to the Heavenly Rainbow Domain’s experts was that Long Chen had declared that he would destroy the Nine Underworld Hall and the Bloodkill Hall. He had even declared war on Lord Brahma. Those were existences that shook countless old monsters. Long Chen was instantly pushed into the most dangerous position.

Furthermore, the rumor of him being an underworld ghost seed also drew the attention of countless monsters. That was why the Heavenly Rainbow Domain’s experts went to such great pains to keep where he was going a secret.

“Long Chen, do you hate me? If you want to curse me, then curse me!”

Within the flying boat, Bai Shishi’s pretty face was red. She lowered her head, her tears falling like a pearl necklace that was cut.
