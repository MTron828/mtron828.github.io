Chapter 1623 Sent Flying With a Kick

Translator: BornToBe

Just looking at that little fellow’s vengeful smile and his previous mocking of him in defense of Di Xin, Long Chen knew that this little fellow was causing trouble again.

Wang Shan was Di Xin’s follower. Hence, if the little fellow wanted to cause trouble for Long Chen, Wang Shan would definitely help.

Just as everyone was looking at Long Chen, Long Chen vanished, reappearing in front of that smiling little fellow.

A large hand slapped across the little fellow’s face, and he immediately coughed up blood, all his teeth flying out in a beautiful arc before scattering to the ground.

Startled cries rang out as no one had expected Long Chen to suddenly attack. His actions were too quick for anyone to react.

Long Chen clenched that person’s throat in his hand. He was just a rank eight Celestial. In front of Long Chen, he didn’t have the slightest ability to resist.

“You didn’t respect the gamble. I said you had to die or finish eating all the stones. Now you’ve decided not to finish the stone, so I’ll be taking your life,” said Long Chen coldly as he held that person like he was a chicken.

The man struggled, trying to say something. But with his throat held by Long Chen, he couldn’t form a complete word. He was filled with terror.

“Courting death!” Just at this moment, Wang Shan let out a furious roar. His hands became sharp claws, and he reached for Long Chen’s back. His claws easily tore through space, showing that he was truly powerful.

“Scram!” Long Chen’s shout was like thunder, shaking everyone’s ears and causing them to stumble.

Long Chen met Wang Shan’s claws with a kick. With a powerful explosive sound, Wang Shan was sent flying. However, Long Chen was a bit surprised. Wang Shan’s power was also great, and he was only knocked back a few steps.

“What?!”

“He managed to kick Wang Shan flying?”

“Just who is he?!”

Everyone was stunned. Wang Shan was the Southern Xuan Region’s top expert. Rumor was that he had never suffered a defeat to anyone except Di Xin. How could he be sent flying by some nameless little fellow?

“Do you remember that I said that if I wanted to kill you, no one could save you? Originally, you managed to keep your little life, but you just had to send yourself to your death. That’s fine with me.”

Startled cries rang out along with a bang. That fellow exploded into blood mist, and even his Yuan Spirit exploded. He was fully and completely dead.

Although that man who was killed had been told by others that the cloaked person was Long Chen, he had felt that Wang Shan was the peak heavenly genius of the Southern Xuan Region and thus shouldn’t be any weaker than Long Chen. So even if that person was Long Chen, Wang Shan should be able to protect him. So he had told Wang Shan about how Long Chen had said disrespectful things about Di Xin with exaggerated details, all so that Wang Shan would handle Long Chen.

Even if Wang Shan wasn’t able to defeat Long Chen, he had presumed that the two of them would have a mighty fight of giants. That would at least be some vengeance for making him eat stones.

However, he had never expected that even before a challenge was issued, Long Chen would instantly capture him. By the time he regretted it, it was too late.

The blood mist slowly dissipated. A rank eight Celestial was slain just like that. People covered their mouths as they stared at Long Chen with shock.

Those people who had entered after Long Chen shivered. They knew someone this vicious could only be that same person they had seen registering.

The disciples who had eaten the stones quivered. They also hadn’t finished eating the stone tablet. Would they be killed next?

“Long Chen, how brazen! You actually came to our Southern Xuan Region to run amok! Today, I’ll teach you that the Southern Xuan Region is not somewhere you can be arrogant!”

Wang Shan’s manifestation exploded into existence. The pressure of an Empyrean immediately filled this space. There were some strange images within his manifestation, proving his manifestation had started to awaken.

Everyone’s expressions changed, and they hastily retreated, afraid of being caught in any shockwaves.

“Long Chen, release your power. Otherwise, you’ll be killed in an instant. That would be boring,” said Wang Shan. Battle intent blazed in his eyes.

“Long Chen? He... he’s the Eastern Xuan Region’s demon king?”

Wang Shan had said Long Chen’s name twice, shaking everyone’s hearts. They stared in shock at the cloaked figure.

Long Chen slowly pulled off his hood, revealing his face. Startled cries rang out.

This was a face that they all recognized. Photographic jades of him had spread throughout the Central Plains, including the Southern Xuan region.

Long Chen was claimed to be the Eastern Xuan Region’s top expert. He had dominated everyone in the same realm. He and his Dragonblood Legion had created legend after legend. He was a figure shrouded in mystery.

“I’ll let you attack me. If I can’t kill you within ten moves, I will leave the Skywood Divine Palace immediately.” Long Chen looked indifferently at Wang Shan who was floating in the sky. He clasped his hands behind his back.

Each of his words was like a hammer striking people’s hearts. That was too ridiculous, wasn’t it? He wanted to kill Wang Shan within ten moves? Wang Shan, an Empyrean whose manifestation had reached an initial awakening? Was there really such a person in this world?

Such big words would only cause others to laugh, but when they came from Long Chen’s mouth, they were filled with unquestionable confidence.

They looked from the furious Wang Shan to the indifferent Long Chen. Their hearts pounded. They were about to witness an unprecedented battle of geniuses.

“One is the top genius of the Southern Xuan region who has never been suppressed by anyone but Di Xin, while another is the peerless demon king of the Eastern Xuan Region, someone who walked out of a mountain of corpses and a sea of blood. If they were to fight, just what kind of unimaginable sight would that be?”

People were nervous, excited, and afraid, yet also filled with anticipation.

Wang Shan felt a bad feeling upon seeing Long Chen look at him so calmly. He didn’t know why he felt like that. He had won countless battles in his life. Other than Di Xin, no one had defeated him. For Long Chen to say he could kill him within ten moves, it was a giant insult.

However, at the same time as he was infuriated, he felt a terror that stemmed from his soul. This was his first time feeling such a sensation.

“Ignorance is such bliss. You are nothing more than a frog at the bottom of a well. Do you think dominating the Eastern Xuan Region is so amazing? Today, I’ll kill you to show you that you can’t dominate the entire world! Understand that the Southern Xuan Region will be your burial ground!” Wang Shan’s entire body began to shine. He shot at Long Chen.

Long Chen didn’t move. However, inside his body, the energy of his stars was already circulating. He was just waiting for Wang Shan to get closer.

After entering the Netherworld, he had not only obtained many treasures and learned many new things, but he also felt like his fighting skills had progressed to a new level. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

This kind of feeling was strange. Although Long Chen knew that this Wang Shan was very powerful, and the latter even had the aura of a divine item, which showed that he had a divine item protecting himself, Long Chen still felt completely confident in killing him within ten moves. This was a kind of premonition. It was very strange.

That was why Long Chen didn’t take the initiative to attack. He simply looked at Wang Shan calmly. He was like a god of death whose blade was already raised. He was simply waiting for his prey to come to him.

Just as Wang Shan attacked, the ground split open and countless wooden stakes flew out, forming a large net that separated Wang Shan and Long Chen.

Those wooden stakes possessed great power. A Life Star Elder of the Skywood Divine Palace appeared.

“Please don’t bring your personal grudges into the Skywood Divine Palace. Otherwise, I’ll have no choice but to expel you,” warned the Elder.

“Long Chen indiscriminately killed someone!” shouted Wang Shan.

“It wasn’t indiscriminate. I had a bet with that person, and after losing, he refused to follow through with the agreed-upon terms. That’s why his life was mine. Everyone outside can testify to that,” said Long Chen coldly.

“Alright, this matter ends here. Don’t cause a disturbance again, or you’ll be kicked out of the Jade Lake Pageant. That will become your life’s regret,” advised the Elder before leaving.

Wang Shan’s expression was gloomy, but he didn’t dare to take the initiative to attack again. This Jade Lake Pageant was hosted by the Skywood Divine Palace. If he really dared to cause a fuss here and angered the Skywood Divine Palace, no one would be able to stop them from kicking him out.

“Count yourself lucky. Otherwise, you won’t have lived to see tomorrow’s sun,” said Wang Shan coldly.

“Fool, someone like you thinks he can expound on the Dao? Are you trying to make people die of laughter? Tranquility leads to reflection, reflection leads to intelligence? Only then can you be free of your emotions and desires, opening the gate to comprehension? Does your current appearance seem tranquil? Does it seem intelligent? Do you even have any intelligence? Truly laughable. I can’t believe you didn’t feel shame talking about the Dao to others. Do you know how to feel embarrassed?” sneered Long Chen

“Since you’re so wise, why don’t you share your wisdom with us?” Just at this moment, another man appeared behind Wang Shan.

When he appeared, he immediately drew a burst of startled cries.
