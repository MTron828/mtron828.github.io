Chapter 2338 The Unified Xuan Beasts

Translator: BornToBe

Seeing everyone looking at him, Cloud held Long Chen’s hand tightly. He could feel how sweaty her palm was.

Although she was just a child, the pride and sense of honor of being part of the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow race was part of her core. After being humiliated for so many years, they all thirsted to return to the peak and prove themselves. They thirsted to use this generation’s glory to comfort their fallen ancestors.

Xuan Beasts naturally were very direct and didn’t consider things too much. This was also a weakness of the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow race, and it was something that the divine families had noticed.

Based on the calculations of whoever that person was, whatever Long Chen said, due to the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow race wishing to be emperors, they would slowly escape his grasp. In the end, the two sides would be fractured.

Even if there wasn’t a full split, by secretly instigating some conflict between them, they would end up growing more and more distant. Silently, Long Chen would lose one of his allies.

With this plot exposed, no one knew what decision Long Chen would make. His choice would be the choice of the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow race.

Long Chen looked at everyone and sighed. “I know many of you have ulterior motives. Some of you have been bought by the divine families and Pill Valley. To tell the truth, I have no interest in your squabbling. What you’re playing is just a boring children’s game to me. But for Cloud, I have no choice but to make things clear. Alright then, I will give you one option. You want to surrender to the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow race? Fine, but you must swear on your soul and bloodline to follow the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow race for your lifetime.”

All the Xuan Beasts’ expressions changed. This kind of oath was too over the top as it would be shackling themselves. If they betrayed it, the curse of the Heavenly Daos would destroy their entire race.

This was essentially handing the fates of their races to the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow race. The rest of the Xuan Beasts would become their servants.

“This requirement is too much. We can’t accept,” said one of the Xuan Beasts, with others nodding along. This oath was binding themselves for generations to come. If the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow race wanted them dead, they would be dead.

Long Chen waved his hand, indicating for everyone to calm down. “Let me finish. In my life, I wish to live with dignity. It is precisely because of that desire that I am surrounded by enemies. No one knows better than me how important freedom is.”

The Xuan Beasts’ expressions softened slightly. They recalled how Long Chen had truly started off in the Eastern Wastelands and fought against all kinds of pressure for his freedom. He had never lowered his head, and even his bloody cultivation path hadn’t crushed that spirit. Hence, they listened patiently.

Long Chen continued, “You wish to join the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow race due to the current crisis. You want them to lead you against the bloody tide which is the dark era. In the same vein, the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow race needs you. Only when everyone is unified can everyone have a greater chance of survival. So, this can be considered a mutually beneficial arrangement. I mentioned that you would have to swear loyalty to the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow race, but the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow race will also swear on their souls and bloodline not to betray you.”

Hearing that, the Xuan Beasts relaxed. If the oath was double-sided, then it was much more acceptable. Even though quite a few of them were still hesitant, others were already nodding along.

When they had followed the Kunpeng race, they had no choice. The Kunpeng race had been extremely domineering, essentially demanding obedience or death. Others had no choice but to acquiesce if they wanted to survive. As for freedom? If they couldn’t even keep their lives, then freedom was a luxury.

As for the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow race, the Xuan Beasts wished to join them, but seeing as they were newly rising, the Xuan Beasts hoped to at least have some better treatment. At the very least, they didn’t wish to be used like dogs like with the Kunpeng race.

When they arrived though, they found that others were still using them, and their sincerity was doubted.

“If the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow race can swear to at least give us the appropriate respect, then my Silver Fox race is willing to have the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow race be our emperors. We will go through water and fire for you.”

Quite a few races immediately expressed their loyalty. Most of them were weaker races. As a result, the stronger ones were starting to look unsightly. For powerful races like them with many experts, joining a side would require at least discussing a few requirements. But in this scenario, doing that would make them seem conceited. That probably wasn’t a good look in front of the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow race.

They were caught in this predicament, not willing to join so easily but also not in a spot to actually say anything.

Long Chen waved his hand once more for silence. “I wasn’t finished talking. Don’t be in such a rush. After all, this doesn’t just affect your own prospects but the future of all the Xuan Beasts. At the very least, you must calmly discuss it before making such a big decision. Don’t do something that will make your descendants curse you.”

That was the truth. They were the representatives of their races, so they each had to consider things for their entire race. Those hesitating Xuan Beasts looked at Long Chen gratefully. It seemed that Long Chen was the only other expert that had ever managed to put himself in their position when treating with them. Their belief in him grew quite a bit without them even realizing it.

“The Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow race is too prideful to use schemes to trick people. Race leader Yuzhu has already said that whether or not the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow race becomes emperor of the Xuan Beasts, they will remain my most trusted allies. We will advance and retreat together. Thus, if you join the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow race, you will also become my allies, and I won’t disappoint you. Those who join will have the Myriad Spirit Diagram open to them so they can continue their lost inheritances and divine abilities. This is an important matter that pertains to the fates of your races, so I will give you a few days to consider it-”

“What?!”

Hearing that the Myriad Spirit Diagram would be accessible to them, the Xuan Beasts couldn’t even hear anything more.

The reason that the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow race could return to their ancient glory was precisely because the Myriad Spirit Diagram had allowed them to continue their lost inheritance. Long Chen was now saying that they could do the same?

“Are… are you really telling the truth?” asked a Xuan Beast, his voice trembling with emotion.

The main reason for the clash between Long Chen and the Xuan Beasts was the Myriad Spirit Diagram. At that time, the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow race had declined to a miserable point that they were no longer viewed as important, and a declined race could no longer use their former splendor to scare others.

The Kunpeng race had wanted the Myriad Spirit Diagram, which had resulted in them becoming mortal enemies with Long Chen. However, they had died without having a chance to see the Myriad Spirit Diagram.

“Of course it’s true. Furthermore, I will not limit how much you can learn,” said Long Chen.

Long Chen looked at Cloud, and Cloud returned a sweet and confident smile. She was saying that it didn’t matter what divine abilities they learned, the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow race would still have the power to stand supreme. This was the pride of their race.

“The Explosive Blood Fire Dragon race swears on its bloodline and soul to follow the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow race through life and death!”

“The Blood Mark Devil Ape race swears on its bloodline and soul…”

“The Heavenly Eagle race…”

Rather than considering it for a few days like Long Chen recommended, every single Xuan Beast knelt and swore their allegiance to the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow Race immediately.

This move of Long Chen’s was giving a slap and then giving a candy. The slap was not too light or heavy, but the candy was too much. Hence, the Xuan Beasts instantly swore allegiance to them.

After all of them finished swearing, Que Yuzhu also made her oath. As long as they didn’t betray the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow race, they would not betray them.

After her oath, the entire palace erupted into cheers. When the news was transmitted to the Xuan Beasts outside the palace, many of them began to rush around, crying and laughing excitedly.

Long Chen held Cloud’s hand with a smile. With the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow race leading all the Xuan Beasts, he had gained yet another powerful group of allies.
