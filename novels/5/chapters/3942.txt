Chapter 3931 Dragon Sparrow Blessing

This saber slash shook the heavens, its divine light cutting through all restrictions of heaven and earth along with that old monster from the Alldevil race.

When his three Grand Dao Flowers crumbled, the world trembled and a cascade of radiant light fell, as if heaven was mourning for his death.

At this moment, Xia Guhong’s manifestation had the figure of a dragon sparrow inside of it. As the aura of primal chaos flowed within it, it unleashed a supreme divine might, akin to a holy object that could not be touched.

Upon seeing the image of the dragon sparrow, the experts in the surroundings turned pale, and their bodies involuntarily quivered. It was like an invisible force was pressing down on them, trying to force them to prostrate themselves toward the dragon sparrow.

“He still has the dragon sparrow soul essence!”

In an instant, Weng Taibei, the ancestor of the Kunpeng race, Liao Bencang, Enpuda, and the other old experts retreated.

“Are you satisfied now? Although I no longer have the Grand Xia Dragon Sparrow, its soul essence is still with me. With a trace of its power, I just unleashed the first of the Dragon Sparrow Three Attacks. There are still two more. After unleashing those two attacks, I will use up the dragon sparrow’s blessing power and enter a weak state. So, tell me, who is willing to receive my next two attacks?” Xia Guhong’s voice boomed throughout heaven and earth, filled with unquestionable dignity and might.

Xia Guhong, the last monarch of the Grand Xia Nation, was the possessor of the ultimate divine item, the Grand Xia Dragon Sparrow. As long as the dragon sparrow’s blessing was still present, no one would be able to beat him. After all, he was still one of the strongest experts in the current nine heavens and ten lands.

Back then, something had happened in the Grand Xia Nation, causing the Grand Xia Dragon Sparrow to vanish along with Xia Guhong.

Even so, Xia Guhong’s light was so strong that even after countless years had passed, the legends about him continued to circulate around the world.

Weng Taibei, the Kunpeng ancestor, Liao Bencang, and the others were probing him this entire time to see if he had lost the Grand Xia Dragon Sparrow’s blessing. Now that he revealed the dragon sparrow manifestation, their hearts shuddered as that divine might could not be replicated. The dragon sparrow blessing still resided within Xia Guhong.

When one of the four Alldevil elders was slain by Xia Guhong, it terrified the remaining three. Their devil race was naturally suppressed by the Grand Xia Dragon Sparrow’s divine light. It was only thanks to them dodging quickly, otherwise, that terrifying attack might have been enough to slay all four of them together.

Aside from feeling scared, they were also enraged. They just realized that Weng Taibei, the Kunpeng ancestor, Liao Bencang, Enpuda, and the others had been using them.

Other than Liao Bencang, the others had had a chance to attack and kill Long Chen, but they hadn’t done so. Only the clueless elders from the Alldevil race had instinctively attacked Long Chen.

As a result, they succeeded in forcing out the Grand Xia Dragon Sparrow’s blessing, with one of them getting killed in the process.

“Sinister human race, you will pay for this!” roared one of the Alldevil race’s elders before leaving with his people. It was unknown if the sinister human race he was referring to was Xia Guhong, Long Chen, or Weng Taibei and the others, or perhaps all of them together.

They realized that if they stayed here, it would be too dangerous for them. After all, this was the human race’s territory. If they were conned again, they might just be wiped out.

In the three thousand worlds, from tens of millions of the Alldevil race’s disciples, only a few hundred survived and came out. If these elders were to die as well, that really would be the final nail in the coffin.

The Alldevil race’s retreat left Weng Taibei and the others in a difficult spot. After all, Xia Guhong had already summoned the Grand Xia Dragon Sparrow’s blessing, clearly going all-out.

Although all of them were top experts with their own powerful trump cards, none of them dared to say that they could receive Xia Guhong’s next attack.

The current Xia Guhong was unbeatable and absolutely terrifying. As a result, none of them was willing to take the risk because a single mistake would cost them their lives.

“Long Chen, hand over Tianyao’s source runes and we can still discuss this. Otherwise, you will regret this!” demanded Weng Taibei.

How could Long Chen not see that they were now too scared of Xia Guhong to fight? And then they wanted to threaten him in this situation? He disdainfully responded, “Is your head full of crap? That foolish child of yours is crippled, and you’re hoping for me to heal him? There must be something wrong with your head!”

“Long Chen, hand over Tu-er’s wings! Put any conditions you want on it,” said the Kunpeng ancestor frostily.

At least, he was a bit smarter. He knew that trying to threaten Long Chen was meaningless, so he directly told Long Chen to quote a price to buy back Kun Tu’s wings.

Long Chen curled his lips. “There’s no need for that. I cultivate the dragon race’s inheritance, so it is fated for me to be mortal enemies with your Kunpeng race. Do you think that I’d return the wings? Those are my spoils of battle. I’m going to start a collection in the future.”

“You…!” The Kunpeng ancestor was enraged. Taking Kun Tu’s wings was an immense humiliation to the Kunpeng race, something completely unacceptable.

“That’s enough.”

Suddenly, Kun Tu appeared. It went without saying that the Kunpeng race was truly powerful. Even after being beaten to that extent by Long Chen and having his wings torn off, other than his face being pale, Kun Tu looked no different than usual. His Blood Qi had even been somewhat restored.

“Long Chen, you cut off my wings this time, but you’ll regret it in the future. Someday, I will cut off your head and use it as a chamber pot.” Kun Tu glared at Long Chen icily.

“Who doesn’t know how to say vicious words? If you don’t accept your loss, let’s fight again in front of everyone right now so they can be witnesses!” said Long Chen disdainfully.

“Hmph, just wait. I, Kun Tu, swear that I will kill you!”

“Alright, I’ll wait for you. Hopefully, you will bring another complete pair of wings, or I don’t know what I’ll cut off next time.”

Kun Tu had already turned around and started leaving. But when he heard Long Chen’s words, he suddenly coughed up blood.

Kun Tu was extremely arrogant and wanted to put on a tough front. In truth, his Blood Qi was not yet recovered, and his injuries were still unstable. Thus, the fluctuation in his emotions caused him to cough up blood.

“Brat, you’ll pay for your insolence!” The Kunpeng ancestor shouted at Long Chen before leaving with his people.

Once the Kunpeng race left, Weng Taibei, Liao Bencang, Enpuda, and so on also went away. From a distance, Weng Tianyao made a throat-cutting gesture to Long Chen before leaving.

At first, Long Chen had been feeling some pity for this fellow, but that single gesture destroyed any sympathy Long Chen felt for him. This fellow really did deserve everything he got.

“Lei Linger, next time, make sure to properly teach him how to behave,” said Long Chen.

“Alright! Don’t worry, I won’t be so soft next time!” promised Lei Linger.

Once all the enemies left, all that remained here were human experts. But they didn’t quite dare to directly leave. They were afraid that Xia Guhong’s enemies were still lurking around. Since they couldn’t beat Xia Guhong, they might take out their anger on the other human experts.

“Big brother Guhong, you really are amazing! Junior brother weeps in admiration. Your glory is like an infinite, unbroken, torrential river.”

It was only at this time that Guo Ran and Xia Chen dared to come out. Since they couldn’t help in that fight, they didn’t want to worry Long Chen by becoming targets. Thus, they had been hidden in the crowd. But after the fight finished, this fellow Guo Ran immediately laid some heavy boot-licking upon Xia Guhong.

At this time, Yu Qingxuan also walked over. Seeing her, Long Chen was delighted, and without thinking about it, held her hand.Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“Brazen scum! How dare you blatantly blaspheme the princess!” All of a sudden, a half-man half-woman shrill voice rang out. When Eunuch Wei’s dislikeable face appeared, he also pointed his fingers at Long Chen.

“Fuck off! I’ve endured you for long enough!”

Long Chen directly slapped Eunuch Wei’s hairless face.
