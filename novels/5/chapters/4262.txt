Chapter 4251 Wilde Appears

The three beasts surrounded Long Chen. No matter where Long Chen positioned himself, he would be attacked in the back by one of them.

Just now, Ye Wuchen had almost been struck by one of them, but fortunately, he had retreated quickly. And now that all three of these beasts surrounded Long Chen, he was forced into a disadvantageous position.

However, his expression still didn’t change; his eyes didn’t even twitch.

“I’ve surrounded Long Chen. As for whether or not you’ll make your move, it’s up to you. In any case, no one likes to be used as cannon fodder. Whether or not you want to activate the karmic luck bead is up to you,” announced Xu Xin-er coldly.

These words were clearly for Lian Wuying and the other peak experts. After all, Xu Xin-er’s goal was only Long Chen, and she didn’t care about the rest. As for what choice people made, it would be up to them.

Lian Wuying and the others’ expressions were dark, as they hadn’t expected to be perfectly schemed against by Xu Xin-er. Originally, they had wanted to conserve their power for the final fight. But now, Xu Xin-er was forcing them to take action early as vengeance for them for sitting still while Xu Yifeng was slain.

Actually, Lian Wuying and the others weren’t afraid of fighting, but they were hoping to conserve their energy until the very end. At the very least, they wanted to be in top condition when the fight for the karmic luck fragments started.

After all, those karmic luck fragments didn’t just relate to their futures but also the prosperity of their factions. Since that was the case, they didn’t dare to be careless.

The original plan was to use the lives of the weaklings to activate the karmic luck bead. Everything had been going well, but Xu Xin-er just had to ruin things.

As expected, these weaklings were not idiots. After hearing about this scheme, they were unwilling to throw their lives away. They also wanted to stay alive for the ultimate showdown.

Although weaklings like them had extremely remote chances to get the fragments, there was still a glimmer of hope. Also, even if the odds were stacked against them, it was better than being manipulated and losing their lives needlessly.

A hushed stillness enveloped the martial stage. Lian Wuying and the others remained still, primarily for two reasons. First, they wanted to conserve their energy for the big battle, and second, they didn’t like being used by Xu Xin-er.

Long Chen also didn’t move, waiting for news from Mo Nian. Mo Nian had told Long Chen to stall for time to see if he could think of a way to break this formation.

Time passed by slowly. Finally, it was Lian Wuying who lost her patience. “Xu Xin-er, when the Sage King Convention ends, if you’re not dead, I will teach you what is more painful than death.”

With a wave of her hand, hundreds of Undying experts stepped out. They were all Triple Supremes, the strongest heavenly geniuses of the races within the Undying race.

When hundreds of these peak experts gathered, Lian Wuying didn’t say anything else. She only looked at the others.

Ye Wuchen snorted and also stepped forward with over a hundred heavenly geniuses of the Ye clan.

At the same time, the void quivered as the Ghost Dao lifeform appeared with hundreds of ghost-like figures behind him.nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

Next, over ten experts of the devil race stepped forward, leading thousands of other heavenly geniuses of their races. Several of them also walked out of the neutral area. At this crucial time, they were no longer permitted to conserve their power.

The Black Tortoise race also stepped forward, then the Heavenly Tiger race, and the Kunpeng race. Dozens of experts within the demonic beast race stepped forward, actually outnumbering the devil race.

However, when the Fullmoon race stepped forward, startled cries rang out. They weren’t assembling with them but were walking toward the Dragonblood Legion’s camp.

“What is going on?!”

Countless people were stunned. In front of their dumbfounded gazes, Xu Changchuan led the Fullmoon race’s experts into Long Chen’s camp, settling down amongst them.

“Fullmoon race, are you betraying the demonic beast race?!”

“Do you take others as idiots? My Fullmoon race exists to fight people like you, not the demonic beast race. We will get justice for the brave demonic beast warriors who died wrongful deaths because of you. Is there a problem?” sneered Xu Changchuan.

“You…!”

The one shouting was left at a loss for words; there was nothing he could do. Xu Changchuan was now standing on the side of the Dragonblood Legion, and he was going to fight them.

As for the demonic beasts standing on the opposite side of the Fullmoon race, although their individual races were powerful, they still couldn’t represent the entire demonic beast race. By stepping forward at this time, they had essentially admitted that they had long since known about this sacrificial ceremony. In other words, they had allowed other demonic beasts to die in order to quicken the pace of the ceremony. There was no room for them to criticize the Fullmoon race.

Aligning with Long Chen at this juncture couldn't be regarded as a betrayal toward the entire demonic beast race. In fact, it was a decision made under the banner of justice, righteousness, and seeking retribution for the wrongs done to the fallen demonic beasts.

At this moment, the void quivered and thousands of large men over ten meters walked over. All of them were thick and muscular, wearing beast hides like savages.

When the onlookers saw these people, they were stunned badly. These giants were from the Barbarian race.

Having been at the edge of the martial stage the entire time, no one had paid them any attention. But now that they stepped out, they made everyone jump in shock.

In fact, the Barbarian race’s history could be traced all the way back to the primal chaos era. It was said that they had once been in command of an era, and their power was not something that anyone dared to question.

However, in the recent era, they almost vanished without a trace. Many people thought that they had gone extinct.

Now. seeing these large muscular men with Blood Qi practically exploding out of them, the onlookers almost couldn’t believe what they were seeing.

However, what they found curious was how no one had noticed such conspicuous figures before this.

Their footsteps caused the void to quiver. They were like elephants walking across wooden planks. People were even worried that one of their steps would cause the void to collapse.

They only had a few thousand people on their side, a paltry number compared to all the other races here. But to everyone’s surprise, eight of them were actually carrying a giant bed, on which lay a large man covered in blood-colored marks

This man was sleeping blissfully on the bed, his snoring like thunder. He was completely unaware of being lifted and carried by these experts as he was lost in dreamland.

“Wilde!”

Upon seeing that large man, Long Chen couldn’t help getting excited, his eyes reddening. He had been worrying a long time about this foolish oaf, and he actually appeared at this time. Furthermore, he seemed very comfortable.

“Wilde!”

Guo Ran, Xia Chen, and the others all shouted in excitement. They hadn’t seen Wilde in a long time, and the latter had grown a great deal. Although he was sleeping, they could see that he was far larger than the Barbarian experts carrying him.

“Our king is still asleep. He can’t be awakened,” said one of the Barbarian warriors a bit helplessly.

Guo Ran and the others hastily welcomed Wilde and his entourage. All the Dragonblood warriors were emotional.

Although Wilde was normally very amiable and had a simple disposition, when they saw his current state, their hearts were shaken. Wilde had grown even more than before, his Blood Qi akin to a slumbering volcano. Once it erupted, it could destroy the entire world.

Standing beside him, they could sense the blood flowing through his body. It was like lava, and they could even hear its rumbling.

Wilde remained in deep slumber, and his body was in its lowest energy state. Even so, his body still thrummed with power. If he were to be roused, just what kind of state would he be in?

“When is he going to wake up?” asked Guo Ran.

“Our king encountered a group of Heavenly Tigers ten days ago. After eating his fill, he fell asleep and has been sleeping ever since…” said that Barbarian warrior.

“What?! You were the ones who killed Snow Mountain’s Heavenly Tiger branch?!” A roar came from the Heavenly Tiger race’s ranks.
