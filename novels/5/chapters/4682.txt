Chapter 4671 The Sovereign Clan Expert Appears

The giant dragon finally emerged in front of everyone, giving off a suffocating feeling that shook their souls.

On top of the giant dragon’s head stood a middle-aged man—precisely the Sovereign clan expert from the Sovereign clan’s Ten Thousand Dragon Nest.

Every expert within the tribulation trembled at the sight of him, feeling an intense sensation of death welling up within them.

Standing atop the dragon’s head, he appeared like a high and mighty god, and all lifeforms within heaven and earth could only prostrate themselves toward him. It was as if no one could blaspheme or defy him.

With a gesture, he caused the vast sea of lightning to churn violently, conjuring a lightning spear into his grasp.

“What?! How could he compress the heavenly tribulation into a weapon?!”

This scene made everyone jump. By condensing the heavenly tribulation into a spear, he left a giant hole in the tribulation.

Seeing this scene, even the Dragonblood warriors tensed up. While they had previously beaten him, they knew that was entirely thanks to luck.

Back then, his corporeal form collided with his manifestation’s divine ability, a scenario that would not occur again as he had merged with his manifestation. With each motion of his hand, an apocalyptic aura roared.

Brandishing his spear, the Sovereign clan expert unleashed a monstrous lightning dragon that shot directly toward Long Chen and Luo Changsheng. Its gaping maw devoured the very space around them.

BOOM!

The moment it devoured Long Chen and Luo Changsheng, its head exploded, and two wretched figures came flying out. Long Chen spat out blood, grievously wounded again.

Meanwhile, divine light came from Luo Changsheng’s saber and golden bone claw, protecting him. Despite all the protections, blood still trickled down the corner of his mouth, and he was filled with shock.

After all, the golden bone claw was his strongest divine weapon. Yet today, its defensive prowess had been reduced by more than half due to the force of the attack, and the impact caused him to almost vomit blood.

“Why isn’t boss fighting back?!” Seeing Long Chen critically injured again, the Dragonblood warriors couldn’t help but feel anxious.

“Don’t worry, boss must have his reasons!” comforted Yue Zifeng, his gaze locked onto Long Chen’s icy eyes. Yue Zifeng felt like he understood something after looking into Long Chen’s eyes.

The Sovereign clan expert waved his spear in a strange arc, cutting apart heaven and earth. After that, more lightning dragons came flying out.

One, two, three... in the blink of an eye, there multiplied to thousands, then tens of thousands of lightning dragons. Everyone within the tribulation was filled with dread.

Each of these lightning dragons exuded the same aura as the one that had previously attacked Long Chen and Luo Changsheng. In other words, they were on the same power level.

The previous attack had already managed to injure Long Chen and Luo Changsheng. If these thousands of lightning dragons landed at the same time, perhaps the two of them would simply evaporate.

Most terrifying of all, more of them were coming out in a seemingly endless tide. Seeing this scene, all the experts within this tribulation couldn’t believe it. They had never seen such a terrifying tribulation before.

This heavenly tribulation clearly intended to wipe them out. They had never seen such a destructive heavenly tribulation before. Fortunately, the Sovereign clan expert suddenly stopped. He was standing in the sky, seemingly entering a strange state.

“Leave Long Chen to me! The rest of you, go kill that fellow! If he keeps summoning more lightning dragons, all of us will die!” shouted Luo Changsheng, no longer calm as there was a hint of anxiety in his voice. He clearly sensed something off.

With a resounding roar, the nine silver rings on his saber boomed, and he swung his saber down toward Long Chen.

Luo Changsheng seemed very anxious. However, a chilling killing intent enveloped Long Chen at this moment.

When that saber arrived in front of Long Chen, a pair of bloody, mutilated hands caught it firmly, stopping the edge three inches from Long Chen’s head.

“Even at this time, you’re still scheming. You really don’t know how to cherish your life,” Long Chen sneered at Luo Changsheng.

BOOM!

Just then, Luo Changsheng’s saber blazed with light, and the blade became an inch closer to Long Chen’s head.

The space beneath Long Chen’s feet shattered like fragile ice under heavy pressure, fissures spreading for miles around. The pressure on Long Chen was evident, his arms trembling as if on the verge of collapse, reaching the limits of his endurance.

“You’re the one who doesn’t value your life. If I chose to reveal my true strength, do you think you'd have the luxury of speaking so arrogantly?” Luo Changsheng’s face was less than three feet from Long Chen’s. “The grand Celestial race isn’t something a frog at the bottom of a well can challenge, understood?” Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

“Grand? Someone who can't even acknowledge their own actions dares to call themselves grand? I think you’re using the wrong word,” mocked Long Chen.

As Long Chen spoke, Luo Changsheng suddenly launched a kick right at Long Chen’s abdomen, attacking without warning.

However, Long Chen seemed to have expected this and suddenly pulled on the saber. He then jumped into the air to dodge this attack. At that moment, his hand moved in a graceful and profound arc.

Long Chen’s hand firmly smacked Luo Changsheng’s face, producing a resounding slap that echoed through the heavenly tribulation.

“What?!”

Countless jaws dropped in disbelief, but who could blame them? The number one monster of the Celestial race had just been slapped in the face.

These individuals were all experts amongst experts, but they had never seen someone use a low-grade technique like face-slapping in a battle on this level. Even more astonishing was its success. Such an unconventional tactic had never crossed their minds before.

“DIE!”

Luo Changsheng was stunned for a moment after being slapped. However, when he finally recovered, fury exploded out of him, and golden lines appeared in his pupils.
