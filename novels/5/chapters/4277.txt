Chapter 4266 The Minghong Saber’s Limit

Upon seeing that Jiang Feng was impaled by Long Chen’s saber, everyone knew that his fate would be decided by a single thought from Long Chen.

Feng Fei’s expression changed, as did the other members of the Jiang clan. In particular, the Jiang clan’s people outside of the martial stage had grim expressions.

Although Jiang Feng had not listened to Feng Fei’s orders, rebelling against the family head’s orders, in the end, he was still a member of the Jiang clan and was even one of their three great heavenly geniuses of the junior generation.

However, Jiang Feng was unable to even unleash a single blow before being vanquished. He was one of their three most outstanding geniuses, and his power was even above Feng Fei’s. While he might not have been Long Chen's equal in terms of raw power, it shouldn't have been to the extent where he couldn't even land a single blow.

This was clearly the result of Jiang Feng’s courage already being broken. He hadn’t dared to fight Long Chen directly, and in his terror, he had made the most foolish decision.

Even if he were to flee, he had to make his preparations beforehand, like holding off his enemy’s attack while falling back. But what made the Jiang clan’s experts speechless was that Jiang Feng had directly shown his back to his enemy. It was like he was just throwing his life to Long Chen.

They were unable to comprehend how a heavenly genius of the Jiang clan could put on such an idiotic display. He had lost the face of the Jiang clan.

“Long Chen, don’t kill me! I’m from the Jiang clan! Feng Fei is your friend!” cried out Jiang Feng, his face pale with terror.

Long Chen shook his head. “Feng Fei is neither my friend nor my foe. At least up until now, I have not received any help from her, so I owe her no debt. If you think that I’ll let you off because of her, you should give up on that thought. I, Long Chen, am always clear on what I owe others, whether that is a favor or a grudge. If others respect me, I’ll respect them. If others want to kill me, I will kill them without hesitation. Weren’t you shouting very loudly just now, telling everyone to join forces to kill me, or they wouldn’t be able to bear the consequences? Since you wanted to kill me and even tried to kill me, don’t blame me for being cold-hearted.”

“If you kill me, the Jiang clan won’t let you off!” Jiang Feng’s pleading became a threat.

“My enemies are spread throughout all nine heavens and ten lands. One Jiang clan makes no difference to me.”

With a quiver of Long Chen’s arm, Jiang Feng screamed. His body exploded, and his Yuan Spirit was annihilated along with him.

“Courting death!”

In the end, Long Chen still killed Jiang Feng, causing the Jiang clan’s experts outside of the martial stage to release their killing intent.𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

By killing Jiang Feng, Long Chen was provoking the entire Jiang clan. Feng Fei couldn’t help but sigh.

This was the result that she had wanted to avoid the most, but it still occurred. With Jiang Feng’s death, the Jiang clan definitely wouldn’t let matters rest. Perhaps the Jiang clan would become mortal enemies with Long Chen due to this incident.

Feng Fei understood Long Chen too well, and that was why she felt so helpless. She had been constantly working to avoid a conflict with him, but things still developed to this point.

In any case, the Jiang clan would need to reclaim their honor after Jiang Feng’s death, and they intended to do so by confronting Long Chen.

Although it was Jiang Feng who had set himself against Long Chen first, giving Long Chen a reasonable excuse, in the end, ‘reason’ was something that required power to mean anything. If you had power, reason was on your side. If you didn’t have power, reason was absolutely meaningless. The cultivation world had no reason to speak of.

After Jiang Feng was slain, the chaos of the Heaven Swallowing Toad’s detonation settled. Long Chen’s power had shaken all of these peak experts.

Although they had numbers, they felt a profound terror against Long Chen. Now, they knew that killing Long Chen was unrealistic.

Feeling intimidated, some of them directly charged toward the Dragonblood Legion from a different angle. Their confidence in killing Long Chen was shaken, but they still believed that they could avoid risking their lives against him by killing the weaklings.

After all, their target was the karmic luck runes. As for Long Chen’s revenge if he survived this, that was a matter for the future. Getting the karmic luck runes now was more important.

Following that, they all scattered, so Long Chen couldn’t stop them all at once. As for who he would kill, that would be up to luck.

BOOM!

A human expert wielding a massive Eternal shield was blown apart by Long Chen’s saber. Unfortunately, Immortal Kings were unable to draw out the power of Eternal divine weapons, so while his Eternal shield remained unharmed by this clash, his body exploded.

Even so, his Yuan Spirit managed to survive thanks to the protection of his Eternal shield. Having lost his physical body, he fled for his life.

Long Chen simply ignored him and ran after an expert of the devil race. With a slash of his saber, despite that peak expert’s full-power counterattack, the latter was still slain with a single stroke of the Minghong Saber.

However, after killing him, Long Chen’s heart sank upon noticing a peanut-sized nick in the Minghong Saber.

During their confrontation, that devil expert had been wielding an Eternal devil weapon. But while the devil expert was slain in the end, the Minghong Saber suffered some damage as well.

The Minghong Saber had reached the cusp of becoming an Eternal divine weapon, but it hadn’t fully crossed that threshold. Sadly, it seemed to have reached its limit and couldn’t progress any further.

At this moment, runes flowed all along the Minghong Saber’s body as it unleashed immense Saber Qi. Although it was damaged, it seemed to be in a crazed state where its will to fight was growing explosively.

Seeing it behaving like this, Long Chen felt pain in his heart. This weapon that had been following him for so long had been constantly advancing, only to reach its limit now.

It was just like a cultivator who had reached a certain realm and suddenly found that their talent was limited, and they could no longer further advance. That kind of blow was indescribable.

Long Chen then shot after an expert of the Blood race. This time, he didn’t use the Minghong Saber, and his left hand reached out as a dragon claw toward his opponent.

BOOM!

However, the Minghong Saber suddenly quivered and slashed toward that expert on its own accord.

That Blood race expert received Long Chen’s dragon claw with a blood-colored spear, shattering the claw. However, he himself almost coughed up blood.

The Minghong Saber then slashed apart his head, killing him.

“Minghong!”

Long Chen couldn’t help feeling pain upon seeing this.

The bloodstained Minghong Saber let out an explosive cry, as if it was speaking to Long Chen.

Even though the Minghong Saber was now damaged, its fighting spirit was still overflowing. It would rather die on the battlefield than accept being stuck at this level.

Looking at it in this state, Long Chen thought of Dragonbone Evilmoon. Back then, Dragonbone Evilmoon had done the same. Knowing that it could no longer advance, the Minghong Saber was pleading with Long Chen to unleash the most brilliant, glorious firework of its life.

Just then, those peak experts managed to reach the Dragonblood Legion’s defensive line, and the Dragonblood Legion’s defensive line was shrinking rapidly. Wilde was called back by Guo Ran, while Meng Qi, Chu Yao, Tang Wan-er, Liu Ruyan, and the others were all falling back, switching from offense to defense.

Now, the martial stage was shuddering crazily, on the verge of exploding. They were in the most critical moment.

Following that, cracks appeared on the martial stage, and primal chaos qi erupted out of them.

“Hahaha!” Long Aotian suddenly raised his head and laughed. “It’s finally here! Long Chen, it’s time for our real battle! Today, we shall settle everything between us!”

Long Aotian seemed to have become an entirely different person. When the sun and moon in his manifestation flowed, the five-colored divine radiance instantly merged into one, as if it had become primal chaos.

The sun and moon were hazy within this primal chaos manifestation. This was completely unprecedented. When this manifestation appeared, a sacred pressure surged, capable of making all lifeforms quiver.
