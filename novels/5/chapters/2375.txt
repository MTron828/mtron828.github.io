Chapter 2365 The Ancient Battlefield

“Haha, my prediction was right. It seems that we’ll get to fight alongside each other.”

Seeing Long Chen come out, Shen Chengfeng laughed, having already predicted this result.

“The Deputy Elder must have a high opinion of me. If even you couldn’t resolve the problem, what am I supposed to do?” Long Chen shook his head with a bitter smile.

“You can’t put it like that. To tell the truth, I really admire your leadership skills. When I came to ask for reinforcements, I wanted the divine families to send some experts to help me reclaim lost territory, but they wanted me to handle it myself. However, due to guarding the Yin Yang World back then, the eighth legion’s defenses weakened to the point that our enemies charged through, which I don’t think can be blamed on us. Now we have to handle the result, so I’m quite unhappy with that. This is already the third time I’ve come to bother the divine families for help, and it seems that I’ve found the solution. I think that you’re even better than those experts. We don’t like their irritating faces,” said Shen Chengfeng as he brought Long Chen away.

“You have such confidence in me? You should know that I have no confidence at all in this,” said Long Chen.

“Actually, it’s not as difficult as you imagine. If the eighth legion wished to reclaim that territory, we’d definitely be able to do it. But it would come at a terrible price. Don’t you think having us sacrifice so much for something that wasn’t our fault is difficult to bear? Would you do it?”

“That’s true. Whoever caused the trouble should bear the consequences,” said Long Chen.

“Exactly! If the divine families had sent reinforcements, we could have taken back our territory easily. But the other three families might cause trouble if the Long family interfered in the so-called fair competition. So this matter has stalled until now. It’s a nice surprise for me that you’re the one I ended up getting as help after all this time,” said Shen Chengfeng with a laugh.

The two of them arrived at the transportation formation that Feng Fei had gone through as well. Shen Chengfeng took out a jade tablet to activate the formation.

“Are we going to the same place as Feng Fei?”

As soon as Long Chen mentioned Feng Fei, the surrounding experts of the divine families glared at him furiously, unable to accept that he had called her directly by her name.

“No, senior Feng Fei went into the depths of the Ancient Battlefield, while we’re just going to the outer edges,” said Shen Chengfeng.

Space shuddered. Long Chen felt like his body was being wrung. Space continued to whirl around them until he was dizzy. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

“This transportation formation is always like this. Building any kind of transportation formation through the Ancient Battlefield is difficult as the spatial laws there are broken. There’s no way to make it steady like other transportation formations,” said Shen Chengfeng.

They were within the twisting space for a full incense stick’s worth of time before Long Chen found himself in a desolate world.

Long Chen’s hair instantly stood on end. Not that far from where they came out was a giant spatial crack.

The space around the crack was twisting violently. It looked like a gaping maw. From within that spatial crack, he sensed the aura of a terrifying Sword Dao.

“This Sword Dao intent remains after so many years.” Long Chen was shocked. This spatial crack was clearly left from a sword but had yet to be healed even after the cleansing of the river of time.

Shen Chengfeng nodded. “It’s pretty amazing that you can look at it directly. The first time I arrived, just looking at it left me with a headache for three months. Even now, I can’t look at it directly. The rumor is that this was an attack left behind by a human master of the Sword Dao right before his death, and it contains his entire Sword Dao. The reason the transportation formation is set up here is to temper the wills of the disciples. All the disciples who come here for the first time receive a shock to their souls from looking at it. But it is said that the worse the impact is, the greater it will benefit them. I don’t know if that’s a lie or not because I didn’t feel any significant improvement after that headache.”

Long Chen smiled. “It’s not a lie. The will behind this sword is a kind of inheritance. This senior left behind the pride and tenacity of his Sword Dao, showing off the unyielding purity of his existence as a sword cultivator. To be injured by this will is to be infected by it. Although it won’t increase your combat power, it will cleanse your heart, allowing you to more easily abandon your distracting thoughts and desires.”

“Now that you say that, it seems that it’s true. I was just a middling existence when I first joined the Heavenly Dragon Legion, and I was quite competitive and jealous of those above us. I almost got kicked out several times. But after coming here, it seems that I did grow calmer. I thought it was just the headache making me focus on recuperating, but I kept that focus on cultivation afterward too.”

The more he thought about it, the more he felt that Long Chen was right. He had thought that he was being punished and forced to look at it, but it was only afterward that he had started to feel great reverence for the Ancient Battlefield and those who had fought on it.

“Oh? Isn’t that commander Shen? I hear you went back to ask for reinforcements again. Did you end up coming back with nothing again?”

Just as Long Chen and Shen Chengfeng were talking, the transportation formation behind them lit up. Two experts walked out. One of them had quite the cutting mouth.

The fact that the eighth Heavenly Dragon Legion had lost their territory and been forced to the second line of defense was known by the entirety of the Heavenly Dragon Legions.

Before this, Long Chen hadn’t noticed it, but Shen Chengfeng had a small immortal character within the embroidered design on his chest. These two also had similar characters.

There were four different colors of this character, bronze, silver, gold, and dark gold. Bronze was for the ordinary warriors, silver was for the squad leaders, and gold was for vice commanders. Dark gold was reserved for the commanders.

These two both had the number three on their chests, indicating that they came from the third Heavenly Dragon Legion. The gold color indicated that they were vice commanders.

The two of them were clearly intent on causing trouble for Shen Chengfeng. The other vice commander looked at Long Chen with surprise. “Little fellow, don’t tell me that you’re the reinforcements? You just entered the Netherpassage realm. Hahaha, it seems that the Long family has truly declined.”

Shen Chengfeng’s expression finally sank. He had no choice but to accept it when others mocked him because the eighth Heavenly Dragon Legion had become a laughingstock for losing its territory. He walked away, ignoring them.

However, Long Chen looked at him oddly. “Do the divine families also have a lot of such idiots?”

“Yes, as many as on the Martial Heaven Continent.” Shen Chengfeng shrugged helplessly.

“Alright then.” Long Chen curled his mouth. People remained the same no matter where he went.

The two of them didn’t get on a flying boat. Flying boats were impacted by the unstable space and were much slower.

The two of them traveled on their own, walking past the desolate surroundings. Everything was a mess. There were collapsed mountains and rubble everywhere. There wasn’t the slightest air of vitality.

Occasionally, spatial cracks would appear along with black holes.

Suddenly, a roar came from within one of those black holes, causing Long Chen to jump. Shen Chengfeng explained, “No need to panic. That sound was left behind by the ancient battle. The master of it has long since died. The battle from back then destroyed the laws of space and time, so some strange things pop up.”

“Even the sounds ended up passing through the river of time. It’s truly worthy of being called a battlefield of gods,” said Long Chen.

“Actually, strange phenomena will appear quite often. Sometimes you’ll hear shouting or bestial roaring. There have been times where people see strange things. To put it bluntly, you will encounter countless unimaginable things here. The experts of that time are not existences we can comprehend. Although there are countless dangers here, there are also countless opportunities. Hehe, you should understand how important the Ancient Battlefield is just based on the fact that the entrance has always been kept under the control of the divine families. It can be said that one reason for the divine families’ success is due to the Ancient Battlefield.” Shen Chengfeng smiled mysteriously.

“So the divine families are treating this battlefield as a big piece of meat? After being gnawed on for so many years, there’s probably not much left,” said Long Chen.

“Hehe, that’s where you’re wrong. The Ancient Battlefield continues to give us countless surprises. Sometimes, experts will leave their inheritances within a minor world right before dying. If you can find the entrance, you can receive that inheritance. Such things are littered throughout the Ancient Battlefield, but they can only be found by luck. Even after all these years, the divine families have only managed to explore a portion of this place. There is also the demon race blocking us from going deeper. They are a constant disturbance. So this Ancient Battlefield can be considered a treasure house, but we don’t have the ability to take all the treasures out. My guess is that after the Star Field Divine World is opened, the next step will be to open the Ancient Battlefield to the continent.”

Suddenly, rumbling erupted ahead of them. A cloud of dust soared. Shen Chengfeng’s expression instantly changed.

“That’s the camp of the eighth legion. They’re being attacked.”
