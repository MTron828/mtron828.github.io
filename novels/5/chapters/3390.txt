Chapter 3379 The Terrifying Black Sea

BOOM!

Black seawater exploded, unleashing huge waves. Long Chen then shot through the air. The Ghost Dao’s lifeforms refused to give up, and they smashed right into the black sea.

Following that, many auras that gave Long Chen chills rose out of the depths of the water. Long Chen instantly had a bad feeling. His lightning wings quivered, and he suddenly shot straight up into the air.

BOOM!

A giant mouth suddenly flew out of the black sea, devouring those lifeforms. After that, the surface of the water bulged crazily. One sea monster after another came out, devouring these lifeforms of the Ghost Dao.

As far as the eye could see, the black water was roiling. Sea monsters devoured the Ghost Dao’s lifeforms.

In return, they also began to attack the sea monsters. Everything became chaotic for a while. However, the majority of the Ghost Dao lifeforms were still targeting Long Chen.

With no other way, Long Chen dived into the black sea. Following him, the Ghost Dao’s lifeforms also plunged into the water.

Everything was pitch-black within the black sea. He couldn’t see any light. Moreover, his divine sense was suppressed to the limit. This sea felt like an unknown world that innately drew out the terror in people’s hearts.

Long Chen’s speed was impacted. But those lifeforms behind him were affected even more.

This disturbance drew out countless sea monsters. Some of them had auras even more terrifying than a Heaven tier Nether King.

However, the Ghost Dao lifeforms were also powerful. If they weren’t killed, they also tore back at the sea monsters. As a result, many sea monster corpses floated to the surface of the water.

Long Chen then latched himself onto the head of a shark sea monster. Now matter how it struggled, it couldn’t shake him off.

This was his only chance at survival. Even if he tired himself to death, he couldn’t kill the entire army of the Ghost Dao lifeforms. He could only provoke the creatures of the black sea to create a chaotic battle.

These Ghost Dao lifeforms didn’t seem to have any intelligence. They only fought instinctively.

They had numbers, but fortunately, there were plenty of sea monsters as well. The disturbance continued to draw over countless sea monsters. Hence, both sides crazily slaughtered each other.

Within the water, Long Chen was constantly dodging attacks from both sides. Ultimately, it was the black sea’s monsters that were more powerful. The Ghost Dao’s lifeforms were being killed and countless corpses were floating on the surface of the water.nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

Once their numbers were whittled down enough, Long Chen felt that with his power, he should be able to handle the rest. So, he prepared to fly out.

After all, the sea monsters wouldn’t walk onto land. Even if they did, they wouldn’t be fast enough to threaten him.

However, just as he tried to break out of the surface of the water, he became dumbfounded. There seemed to be an elastic barrier at the top of the water. He tried several times but was forced back down every time.

“How can this be?!”

Long Chen’s heart turned cold, and he finally felt fear. If he couldn’t get out, he would be forever sealed within the black sea.

Furthermore, he saw that the Ghost Dao lifeforms sank into the sea when they died. The corpses floating on the surface were only sea monsters.

Long Chen tried to climb out on their corpses, but whenever he got close to reaching the surface, the corpse he was climbing on sank. There was no way for him to climb out. 

Furthermore, he was starting to feel unwell the longer he stayed beneath the surface. It was like he was drowning. Every breath was laborious, and his chest hurt.

“What is with this black sea?” Long Chen finally understood why even gods like Leng Yueyan and Ming Cangyue were so afraid of the black sea.

Finally, all the Ghost Dao’s lifeforms were slain, and the sea monsters turned their attention to him. There was no difference between the Ghost Dao lifeforms and Long Chen to them.

“Long Chen!”

Just then, he heard a panicked shout. He was delighted. That was Leng Yueyan’s voice. They had come at this critical moment.

“I’m over here!”

Long Chen shouted. However, he found that no sound came out. Even he himself couldn’t hear it.

“Long Chen, where are you?!”

Ming Cangyue was almost sobbing as she shouted. She was out of her wits. She looked through the endless corpses floating on the surface of the water, but she couldn’t find Long Chen.

Long Chen then took out the Nethergod tablet, hoping to communicate with them. But when he took it out, he found that its energy was completely blocked.

Long Chen was shocked. So, he took out his saber and attacked the surface of the water. However, his saber-image merely caused the tiniest ripples. With the water being covered by so many corpses, no one could possibly notice.

“Long Chen! Long Chen!”

Leng Yueyan and Ming Cangyue continue to shout. Their voices came from different directions. They were clearly looking all over for him.

Long Chen seemed to be caught in a nightmare. Leng Yueyan and Ming Cangyue’s voices were getting further and further away. Only at that moment did Long Chen realize that he had sunk many miles from the surface. He was actually in the process of sinking.

“Bastard, don’t go down, go up!” Long Chen was startled. He shook the shark’s head, trying to order it up.

However, his Spiritual Strength had almost no effect in this black water. He couldn’t control this sea monster.

“What to do? What to do?!”

Long Chen felt like he was drowning. He tried to grasp at his last hope but couldn’t. He had never felt so powerless. This black sea was practically a cursed sea that stripped him of all his power.

“There must be a way! Calm down, calm down!” Long Chen forcibly suppressed his emotions. Leng Yueyan and Ming Cangyue’s voices were so far away that he could barely hear them now.

“Divine ring!”

“Battle armor!”

Long Chen could no longer worry about anything else. With a furious roar, his divine ring blasted apart the water. 

BOOM!

Golden dragon scales covered his body. At the same time, an illusory figure appeared behind him. It was a long dragon tail.

With a swish of that tail, Long Chen shot out like an arrow toward the surface of the water. A giant wave exploded out of the water.

Leng Yueyan and Ming Cangyue instantly noticed it, and they also saw Long Chen within the wave.

However, even that wasn’t enough for Long Chen to break free from the surface of the water. He bounced back like there was an elastic barrier at the surface of the water. The wave he made settled back down.

“Long Chen, don’t panic! This is one of the laws of the black sea. Just hold on. Yueyan and I will save you.”

Seeing that Long Chen was trying to break free himself, Ming Cangyue shouted. She knew that those that were devoured by the black sea could not come out alone. They needed help from the outside.

Ming Cangyue and Leng Yueyan crossed their swords. The Nethergod mark on their foreheads lit up brilliantly.

However, when the black water was illuminated by this light, their expressions suddenly changed. Seeing that, Long Chen had a bad feeling. He hastily looked down.

He saw countless lanterns glowing from deep below the surface of the water. When he looked more closely, he almost pissed himself. Those lanterns were pairs of fiendish eyes. They were slowly approaching him with sinister auras.
