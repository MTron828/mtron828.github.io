Chapter 4682 Drawing Calamity

“He directly tore open a spatial passageway!”

Xia Chen turned pale with fright as he saw the spectacle before him, unable to believe that someone in this world could pierce the void with just brute force.

The strike was like launching an attack through spatial transportation, bypassing spatial limitations to directly strike a target.

As a formation master, Xia Chen had heard of such a thing and had researched it. But with his limited knowledge, he couldn’t achieve such precise control over spatial laws.

For such an attack, distance was a meaningless concept. Its principle resembled that of an iron rod: push one end, and the other end moved forward. Yet, the profundities within it had befuddled countless people. At the very least, Xia Chen was unable to comprehend it at his level.

BOOM!

The whale spine pierced Long Chen’s chest like a sword. It happened so suddenly that Bai Shishi and Yu Qingxuan could only cry out.

However, they quickly realized that this whale spine only struck an afterimage. Long Chen was gone.

“Where is he?!”

Luo Changsheng and the others were shocked. They were actually unable to track Long Chen’s movements.

“Are you looking for me?”

Suddenly, a voice rang out among them, causing them to jump in terror. Long Chen had appeared amongst them at some point.

A golden talisman in Long Chen’s hand turned to dust. In truth, Long Chen had used a talisman to teleport here.

“Boss really dares to play!” Seeing that, Xia Chen sighed with relief. He was covered in sweat.

That was the highest tier spatial transportation talisman Xia Chen had ever made. However, he wouldn’t dare to use it in a heavenly tribulation as the space was too unstable here. Otherwise, one mistake, and he would be drawn into the chaotic flow of space, perhaps never to return.

Also, Xia Chen had no idea if this talisman could work in heavenly tribulation, as he didn’t have the guts to try this crazy idea out.

Long Chen had transported himself right in the midst of Luo Changsheng and the others. At first, they were simply shocked, but soon enough, they saw Long Chen’s sinister smile, which caused them to have a bad feeling.

BOOM!

Space was torn as the whale spine followed Long Chen here. With a flash, Long Chen narrowly avoided this attack.

Long Chen managed to dodge, but the others weren’t so lucky. Despite the protection of their Saint items, they couldn’t escape being turned into smithereens by this attack.

“You bastard! You’re dragging us into this!”

The survivors instantly realized Long Chen’s plan and cursed him furiously. Long Chen was unable to beat this fellow, so he actually decided to drag them down with him.

“Again, aren’t you all trying to prove that you’re the chosen sons of the heavens? Your chance is here! Don’t be so lazy,” laughed Long Chen contemptuously.

In fact, the sheer might of the Warrior of the Starry Sky left Long Chen in awe; their reputation as the strongest warriors under the starry sky was not for naught.

Long Chen moved like a phantom amidst the chaos, repeatedly dodging the Warrior of the Starry Sky’s attacks, leaving these idiots in a dire strait.

After all, the Warrior of the Starry Sky’s attacks were quick as lightning, and the whale spine’s movements were ephemeral, capable of manifesting anywhere at a moment’s notice. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

Even the likes of Luo Changsheng, Yin Jiushang, and Yu Zihao, did not dare to use their powerful Saint items to intercept the Warrior of the Starry Sky.

Yan Tianhua had a snake bone whip, but compared to the Warrior of the Starry Sky’s whale spine whip, his weapon was no different from a toy. No one dared to even compare them.

As for Yin Jiushang, he was hiding in his bronze chariot, directing his white bone horse to fly around in the sky to avoid Long Chen.

The lightning cage of heavenly tribulation had transformed into a chicken lair with an eagle inside of it. These heavenly geniuses ran around like chickens and dogs and no longer cared about their faces. After all, their lives came first. This Warrior of the Starry Sky was not an existence any of them could compete against.

When the nine star heir appeared, some people recognized his origins. But not one person recognized this Warrior of the Starry Sky.

“Hey, what are you running for? This is your best chance to prove yourself! Come on, who’s the greatest son of the heavens!? Fight him!” Long Chen’s taunts rang out as he darted around, leaving glimmering trails of starlight in his wake. He left behind fleeting afterimages as he practiced the Star Cloud Steps that he had stolen from the nine star heir.

Despite his shallow mastery of it, its effectiveness in close-range evasion was undeniable. The Warrior of the Starry Sky was temporarily unable to land a blow on Long Chen.

Long Chen could only dodge for now. Without Dragonbone Evilmoon, he didn’t dare to fight the Warrior of the Starry Sky directly.

“You despicable bastard, this is your karma! Face it like a man! Why burden others with your sins?!” shouted one of the experts caught in this calamity. Despite what he said, Long Chen laughed.

Luo Changsheng shouted, “Long Chen, no wonder your Dragonblood Legion consists of a group of black-hearted brutes. After all, they’re led by someone so despicable!”

“Fuck your mother!”

Luo Changsheng really knew how to get under Long Chen’s skin. After his taunt, Long Chen directly charged over at him.

“You think that you can harm me? Keep dreaming!” Luo Changsheng sneered as he saw through Long Chen’s intentions. With his peculiar saber in hand and the golden bone claw hovering above him, he blurred before Long Chen’s eyes.

Long Chen tried to strike him, but Luo Changsheng seemed to vanish, as if teleporting.

Long Chen then avoided the Warrior of the Starry Sky’s attack and once more shot after Luo Changsheng. Long Chen seemed to have eyes on the back of his head and could track the Warrior of the Starry Sky’s movements.

“Idiot, you can’t catch up to me! I have the Celestial Bone Claw! This is—” Luo Changsheng sneered as he once more grew illusory.

BOOM!

Just then, he shook intensely. At some point, a sinister ship exuding ghost qi appeared behind him, and Luo Changsheng smashed into it. The impact caused him to spit out blood.

The experts present were all shocked. All of a sudden, a group of ghostly ships appeared, and they looked so decayed that their sails were riddled with holes. All these ships exuded the aura of death.

“These are... Ghost Ships...!”

Ghost Ships. The name itself bore an ominous weight. Legend had it that those who laid eyes upon one would be cursed with misfortune until their bitter end. A Ghost Ship was a curse.

Everyone here felt a chill as they saw countless Ghost Ships slowly appearing throughout the void. It was like this area was linked to the underworld.

The Ghost Ship Luo Changsheng smashed into slowly fell apart. From its depths emerged a horde of spectral figures clad in ancient armor, wielding decayed weaponry with an air of malevolence.
