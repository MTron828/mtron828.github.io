Chapter 4835 Courting Death

Lu Ziqiong had been pressing Hu Yifei the entire time, suppressing his three hundred soul swords. This made her think that everything was under her control.

However, when she saw a treacherous light in Hu Yifei’s eyes, a bad feeling rose in her heart, and the frost on the violet chrysanthemum manifestation behind her instantly vanished. When Lu Ziqiong finally realized something was wrong, Hu Yifei’s attack was already crashing toward her.

Suddenly, Lu Ziqiong formed one-handed seals, and the violet chrysanthemum of her manifestation vanished, reappearing on the tip of her sword.

BOOM!

The violet flower expanded on the tip of her sword, facing off against that giant merged sword. Their collision sent shockwaves through the entire martial stage, causing the arena to tremble.

Amidst the chaos, petals scattered through the air, and sharp swords slashed through the void. Both manifestations exploded at the same time. Just as Lu Ziyu and the others cheered that Lu Ziqiong had managed to survive Hu Yifei’s killer attack, a sword silently stabbed into Lu Ziqiong’s chest.

Hu Yifei smiled sinisterly at Lu Qiziong. “You little slut, I’ve wanted to kill you for a long time. It’s a shame I can’t play with your body before killing you.”

With a perverted look, Hu Yifei's sword penetrated Lu Ziqiong’s chest. He gazed at her with malicious intent. "Rest in peace."

Without hesitation, Hu Yifei's sword shook, unleashing a burst of explosive power.

“Big sister!” Lu Ziyu screamed.

“No!” The Lu family’s disciples roared.

BOOM!

The sword in Hu Yifei’s hand exploded, but Lu Ziqiong had vanished into thin air before that.

Hu Yifei was startled. Looking around, he saw a furious Lu Ziqiong holding her chest in a corner of the martial stage.

Unexpectedly, Lu Ziqiong possessed such a life-saving trump card that allowed her to escape with her life.

“You little slut, you truly have some ability. However, I know that you care about dignity, and you wouldn’t just admit defeat. Come, show me how you fight in this state. Show me the resoluteness and bravery of the Lu family. Show all the trash from your family just how weak you are, hahaha!” Hu Yifei laughed, acting as if he had already won, and his gaze swept toward the stands

When he saw Long Chen, his expression instantly turned sinister. After that, he vanished and reappeared in front of Lu Ziqiong like a phantom.

Lu Ziqiong was severely wounded. Even though she had managed to escape with her life, she was powerless to keep fighting. However, she was also unwilling to admit defeat. Hu Yifei’s words in particular triggered her pride, so she wanted to keep fighting.

When Hu Yifei appeared before Lu Ziqiong, she clenched her teeth. The flower in her manifestation was already gone, leaving only an igniting stalk.

BOOM!

Lu Ziqiong swung her sword and forced Hu Yifei back with an explosive sound, flames raging around her.

“Igniting her manifestation?! Is she crazy?!” Mo Nian was shocked at Lu Ziqiong's stubbornness.

“Hahaha, as expected of the Lu family’s disciples. Come, let’s fight another three hundred rounds!” Hu Yifei laughed.

Forming hand seals, Hu Yifei sent a continuous torrent of swords flying her way. Meanwhile, Lu Ziqiong pressed through this onslaught, her eyes filled with icy killing intent.

“Long Chen, can my big sister win? Will she win?” Lu Ziqiong pleaded anxiously. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

Long Chen remained silent, and it was Mo Nian who sighed and responded, “If your sister hadn't fallen into his trap, her chances of winning in a fair one-on-one fight would have been about fifty percent. But now...”

Just then, a sharp sword streaked across Lu Ziqiong’s leg, leaving behind a superficial wound that she ignored as she pressed forward. Following that, more and more swords slashed across her skin, yet Lu Ziqiong fearlessly continued her charge.

When Long Chen and Mo Nian saw this scene, their expressions grew ugly. Mo Nian gritted his teeth in anger. “This scoundrel is utterly shameless. He deserves to die”

Just then, sword-light scratched Lu Ziqiong’s leg, ripping off a part of her trousers and exposing her pale leg.

“Wow, what a long and pale leg. I wonder if other places are just as pale?” Hu Yifei laughed and sent another wave of sword-light at Lu Ziqiong.

At that moment, Lu Ziqiong was filled with shock and rage. She realized that any hope of defeating Hu Yifei had slipped away, and persisting would only lead to further humiliation. Hence, she crushed a jade talisman, and with a flash from the martial stage, she vanished along with the terrifying devil pressure coming from the stage.

“The Lu family’s heavenly genius has lost.”

“Not just lost... It was a miserable defeat.”

“It was also a loss of face.”

Sighs rang throughout the spectator stands.

A sudden flash materialized before Long Chen and the others, revealing a bloodied Lu Ziqiong standing before them.

“Big Sister!” Lu Ziyu cried out and hastily covered up her sister in a blanket.

Lu Ziqiong appeared dispirited, her aura fluctuating erratically, and she seemed on the verge of collapse. The Lu family's disciples panicked, unsure of what to do.

“Don’t worry. She only ignited her manifestation. It shouldn’t be too serious,” Long Chen reassured them as he examined her injuries and fed her a medicinal pill. After that, Lu Ziqiong promptly lost consciousness.

Just as the Lu family’s disciples were about to bring her away to heal, Hu Yifei’s sneer rang out from the martial stage.

“Hey, Lu family cowards, do you not want revenge? Come, I’ll give you your chance to avenge her.”

“This bastard! I’m going to kill him!” Lu Chengfeng clenched his teeth and was about to charge out, but Lu Ziyu grabbed him.

“You aren’t a match for him. You’ll lose your life for nothing, and it’ll make them even more arrogant.”

“Hahaha, the Lu family really is a pack of good-for-nothings. Just keep cowering like tortoises for the rest of your lives. Don’t come out and embarrass yourselves,” laughed Hu Yifei.

The battle was over, but the martial stage did not close just yet. According to Devil Fall City’s rules, the victor had the right to continue fighting, while the loser also had the right to send out another challenger.

Although Hu Yifei did have that right, if the Yu family didn’t accept, it meant that this battle was truly over. If Long Chen and the others left, then they gave up the chance for revenge.

Mo Nian couldn’t help cursing back, “Hey, are you blind? Challenge the right person. There’s such a large person standing right beside me, but you don’t dare to say a word to him? Are you just faking it?”

“Him? He’s nothing more than trash relying on a woman’s protection. Does he dare to fight?” sneered Hu Yifei.

When Hu Yifei challenged Long Chen, the Lu family’s disciples instantly looked at him. Long Chen calmly responded, “If you wish to reincarnate, I will gladly fulfill your wish.”

“See?” sneered Mo Nian, fanning the flames. “Little fellow, we don’t even view you as an opponent. If you have guts, just try to challenge him. Come on! Let’s see who is afraid of who!”

“If you have the guts, you can accept it.”

Hu Yifei sneered, sending a golden tablet flying over. Long Chen then smiled derisively and tossed out his own tablet.

Their tablets collided in midair, and Long Chen vanished from the spectator stands, reappearing on the martial stage.

“Hahaha, now there’ll be a good show!” Mo Nian shouted excitedly. “Hey, everyone, my fellow people, young and old, I’m opening up a gambling booth! Place your bets if you want to make some money!”
