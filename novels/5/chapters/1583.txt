Chapter 1578 The Old Man’s Secret

Translator: BornToBe

“Don’t even think about it!”

Qu Jianying had just opened her mouth when the old man stood in opposition to her. Long Chen was a bit befuddled, not knowing what was going on.

“I was asking Long Chen, not you. Why are you so big-mouthed?” demanded Qu Jianying.

“Long Chen is my family’s child, so I get to decide,” shouted the old man, stabbing the black staff into the ground.

“I can’t be bothered with you. Long Chen, do you want to come with me to the Central Xuan Region? That place is definitely a hundred times better than here. With me present, no one would dare to bully you. Not even Pill Valley or the Xuan Beasts have those guts,” said Qu Jianying, turning to Long Chen.

Long Chen shook his head. “Many thanks for your kind intentions, but I don’t want to leave the Eastern Xuan Region for now. I also can’t leave the Xuantian Dao Sect.”

Long Chen’s words caused the old man’s expression to improve slightly. On the other hand, Li Tianxuan’s expression was calm from start to end. He didn’t seem worried at all.

“Are you a fool? The Xuantian Dao Sect might be rising, and I’ve also made my warning, making it so people won’t directly target you, but it’s the hidden arrows that are hardest to block. Even if you aren’t thinking of yourself, what about the people beside you?” demanded Qu Jianying, disappointed with his poor decision.

Long Chen laughed, “The cultivation path is one of no return. Ever since we chose to fight for the peak of the martial path, we began betting our lives against the heavens. If we didn’t even have the courage to bet, how would we cultivate? The entire Dragonblood Legion thinks the same way. They’ve entrusted their lives to me, and my decision is their decision. Even if we fall on the struggle of the martial path, we will die together. We’ll gather in the yellow springs and continue our fight from there.”

Long Chen’s laughter was full of equanimity toward death and unstoppable drive that caused all the experts to be moved. Only a domineering person could say such domineering words.

The old man and the seven bosses all smiled. This was how grand a man should act.

“You... you really are just like that old ghost,” raged Qu Jianying.

“Hahaha, my family’s children all have this kind of temperament. What, you don’t like it?” laughed the old man as if he had won.

Qu Jianying’s angry expression suddenly transformed into a contemptuous smile. “What does Long Chen’s temperament have to do with you? He came from the Eastern Wasteland. I’ve never seen someone as shameless as you. It’s like you think Long Chen’s accomplishments are all thanks to you. People really grow more shameless as they grow old.”

“Bullshit!” The old man raged, “Long Chen was just a brat in the Eastern Wasteland, and he even killed one of my Heaven Splitting Battle Sect’s outer disciples. It was only thanks to my wisdom that we didn’t pursue that and even cleaned up a batch of disciples that didn’t fit our standards. We even gave him Split the Heavens! His accomplishments are definitely partially thanks to me. How am I shameless?” Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

The old man looked exceptionally infuriated. He was like a provoked lion, and even the veins on his forehead were bulging.

The seven bosses simply shook their heads with a smile, not surprised at all. Long Chen didn’t comprehend at first, but when he thought of what the seventh boss had said to him, he realized what was happening. So that’s what it was!

“Does getting angry about the truth have any use? If the Xuantian Dao Sect hadn’t arrived just now, you would either be dead or crippled. Don’t you feel shame bragging so much?” demanded Qu Jianying disdainfully.

“So what? Even if they hadn’t come, I could have cut down Yu Xiaoyun’s clone. Who would dare to look down on me?” snorted the old man.

Long Chen was startled. The old man was actually so powerful that with his half-step Netherpassage cultivation base, he could still destroy Yu Xiaoyun’s clone even when it was in possession of the Daynight Furnace? It seemed the ninth form of Split the Heavens had some kind of secret to it.

“To trade your true body with a clone, have you grown muddled with age?” asked Qu Jianying coldly.

“I was willing to do it. Does that have anything to do with you?”

The old man didn’t have the slightest air of a wise elder or a reserved elder. However, his current appearance did make him seem much younger.

As the two of them exchanged words, more and more experts came to a realization. As long as they weren’t a fool, anyone would be able to tell that Qu Jianying and the old man had some kind of relationship.

Qu Jianying ignored the old man’s reply and looked at Long Chen. “Child, let me ask you. If your women grew stronger than you, what would you do? Would you get jealous of them?”

Long Chen was caught off-guard by this question. Looking at Meng Qi, Chu Yao, and Tang Wan-er, he replied without any hesitation, “If they were stronger than me, that would be the best. It would make me overjoyed. Why would I get jealous?”

“Do you see that? That’s called a man. Hmph, not like some petty little person whose heart is narrower than a needle and doesn’t like it when other people are stronger than him.” Although Qu Jianying didn’t directly bring up the old man, her meaning was already clear.

“When did I ever get jealous of you? What a joke. I’ve already comprehended life and death, and I’m just one step away from Netherpassage. Just wait! We’re leaving!” The old man waved his hand and then left. In his fury, he didn’t even say goodbye. Boss Bao and the others hastily followed. Bao Buping and Chang Hao waved goodbye to Long Chen as they ran off as well. They knew the old man was angry and couldn’t be further provoked.

Long Chen shook his head. Clearly, the old man had some kind of relationship with the alliance head.

From Qu Jianying’s eyes, Long Chen saw a trace of remorse, but she still kept a cold smile on her face.

That made Long Chen sigh. Even at such an age, they were still like children. Could they not grow up?

Qu Jianying took a deep breath. Looking at Long Chen, she said, “You’re a good child, and a real man at that. Don’t follow in that old ghost’s footsteps and become so narrow-minded, looking down on women. For now, this matter is over. I have regained control of the Martial Heaven Alliance and cleaned up its interior. The Martial Heaven Alliance won’t be in turmoil like before. Also, Pill Valley won’t be able to find trouble for you temporarily, and the Corrupt path should cease their schemes as long as they have the slightest brains. As for the Xuan Beasts, I will personally warn them. I doubt they would dare to touch you.”

“Many thanks, senior. I’ve been tired just trying to keep up with them. I can finally take a break.” Long Chen smiled.

That smile truly contained some relief. Right after the battle of the Spirit World where he had lost hundreds of his brothers, he had returned to the continent to find that the Xuantian Dao Sect was destroyed and all sorts of rumors were spreading. He had been surrounded by enemies this entire time.

“You really are different from that old fellow. Even when he was young and filled with drive, he refused to ever admit when he was tired. Well, that’s not important. Think of some way to give this to him, and do your best not to let him know that it’s from me.” Qu Jianying took out a jade case.

This jade case was covered in black and white lines. When Long Chen touched it, his heart pounded. There was powerful life and death energy coming from the jade case. He felt like his soul was about to be pulled into it.

“This is some of my experience when entering the Netherworld. Help me give it to that old ghost. However, if you tell him it’s from me, he won’t accept it.” Qu Jianying shook her head helplessly.

Long Chen promised, “Don’t worry, just leave it to me. I’ll handle this.”

Qu Jianying smiled. “I was rushing to come here today, so I don’t have any gifts for you. Next time I’ll have something ready. I have to go now. Things back at the headquarters are still in shambles. Be careful.”

Qu Jianying was saying goodbye to the patriarch and was about to leave when she suddenly let out a cold snort. She slashed her sword upward.

A flash of sword-light pierced the void, tearing open the sky.

A vague figure could be seen for just a moment before it vanished.

“Bloodkill Hall, listen well! If you dare to use seniors to attack juniors, then even if I have to flip through this whole world, I’ll find you and erase you from existence!” shouted Qu Jianying.

Everyone jumped in shock. None of them had even sensed someone. If it hadn’t been for Qu Jianying, they wouldn’t have even known that there was a terrifying assassin approaching.

Long Chen also praised her inside. She was truly worthy of being the head of the Martial Heaven Alliance. She had actually sensed that assassin one step before him.

His Nine Star Hegemon Body Art had only sensed the assassin the instant Qu Jianying had attacked.

“Long Chen, be careful of the Bloodkill Hall’s people. They are like houseflies, they’re everywhere. I heard that they’ve given rise to a divine emissary, and that divine emissary is the one who managed to receive the greatest divine blessing in all the Bloodkill Hall’s history. Be careful,” warned Qu Jianying.

“Yes, I’ll be careful.” Long Chen nodded.

Only then did Qu Jianying return to her carriage. The Nine Wing Qilin Eagle spread its wings and vanished from sight.

All the various experts from various forces had now left, leaving behind only the Xuantian Dao Sect’s people.

The current Xuantian Dao Sect was in an unprecedented golden age. Countless top geniuses had joined them. They had definitely become the strongest sect in the Eastern Xuan Region.

All the experts who had just joined were excited. On one hand, they had just joined the strongest sect in the Eastern Xuan Region, while on the other hand, they were now in the same sect as Long Chen.

Long Chen was the Eastern Xuan Region’s strongest monster. He slaughtered other heavenly geniuses without ever tasting defeat. To be able to say that they came from the same sect as him was definitely an honor.

Li Tianxuan looked at Long Chen. Long Chen immediately understood and loudly said, “Brothers and sisters, welcome to the Xuantian Dao Sect. Starting today, we are now one family. For now, let’s not talk about anything else. After so much fierce fighting, my stomach’s empty. Let’s return to the sect to eat and drink! I, Long Chen, will offer all of you a toast to welcome you!”

Long Chen’s wanton and relaxed style made these new disciples who had just joined feel even more excitement. Just as they were cheering, Long Chen pulled Xia Yunchong and Xia Youluo with him to the Dragonblood Legion.

The Reincarnation Mirror activated, drawing them all inside. The Xuantian Tower and Reincarnation Mirror broke through space, vanishing, leaving behind only a desolate and empty battlefield.
