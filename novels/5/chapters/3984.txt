Chapter 3973 The Imperial Family’s Cultivation Grounds

When the gates opened one by one, the bright light illuminated Long Chen’s tears. At this moment, he was no longer the dean of the High Firmament Academy or an unrivaled heavenly genius, but just a helpless child.

The thirst in his eyes and that helpless expression stabbed deep into the two women’s hearts. When Long Chen realized who it was in front of him, that expression of loss made their hearts ache.

“Sorry for being rude. Junior Long Chen greets aunts.” After a moment, Long Chen rose and bowed to the two of them.

“Child, can you tell me who your father and mother are?” asked Jiang Huixin softly.

Long Chen’s expression just now had left a deep impression on her, triggering Jiang Huixin’s maternal instincts. She truly wished to help Long Chen.

Long Chen smiled. “In truth, there’s nothing to say about it. I don’t even know what they look like. But I accept your kind intentions.”

Although he had felt lost upon awakening, he quickly adjusted himself. After his heart-devil was suppressed, he felt relaxed and full of confidence for the future.

He knew that his mother was definitely still alive. Luo Zichuan refused to tell him, but he had to have his reasons.

As for his father, he had heard of him from Long Aotian and knew that he was alive. They would definitely see each other again.

Seeing that Long Chen refused to say, a kind flicker appeared in Jiang Huixin’s eyes. She knew that Long Chen was no ordinary child. He had to be under all kinds of pressure, but he just didn’t speak of them.

“Alright, the ten days are over. Big sister Huixin and I came here because we were worried that you would be on the verge of collapse. But it seems that the worry was for nothing,” said Xu Lanxin.

Long Chen seemed in top condition, so they couldn’t help being curious. Had the little black room really stopped working?

After Long Chen bid them farewell and left, he stretched lazily in the warm sunlight. He felt full of power. He didn’t remember the last time he had ever felt so good.

“Big brother!”

Just then, he saw Zhu Yifeng and Yu Qianxue walking over. Zhu Yifeng cried out excitedly.

“Big brother, are you alright?”

“Why wouldn’t I be? I just slept in the room. I feel great. Let’s go, I’ll treat you to more fish!” Long Chen laughed.

However, Zhu Yifeng shivered when Long Chen mentioned ‘fish’. He was traumatized by the word after the last incident.

Yu Qianxue examined Long Chen. Seeing that he was in amazing condition, even better than when he had entered the little black room, she was unable to understand. Had the higher-ups given him special treatment?

“Let’s go back to the mansion first,” said Yu Qianxue.

Long Chen smiled. “You had me watch the gate to the medicinal field and then you sent me to the fishing grounds to raise fish. Now, what are you going to get me to do? Perhaps you want me to feed some spirit beasts?”

“Keep dreaming. If you keep going like this, I’m going to lose all my money!” roared Yu Qianxue furiously.

Only after roaring furiously did she take note that this wasn’t the place to shout. She hastily ran off with Long Chen and Zhu Yifeng.

…

“The little black room is still functioning normally. Every rune is intact, and the core of the star-field is also operating normally. Such a thing should never have occurred. Unless… Long Chen is originally a lifeform from hell.”

Within the palace, Xu Lanxin was still unable to figure out how Long Chen had done this. Jiang Huixin and Yu Xiaoyun were equally puzzled.

“This brat has too many secrets. I don’t like him. I don’t want my daughter to be with someone like this,” said Yu Xiaoyun.

“But I really do like this child.” Jiang Huixin smiled.

“Why?” Yu Xiaoyun couldn’t help but feel angry.VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

“Because Long Chen is more mature than you, and he knows how to share happiness with others. Have you not noticed that Qingxuan is much happier after he appeared?” asked Jiang Huixin.

“What maturity?! He doesn’t even know the slightest thing about politeness, and his temper is terrible! Qingxuan will definitely suffer if she stays with him!” snorted Yu Xiaoyun.

“I don’t think so. Although Long Chen’s temper is bad, it also depends on who he’s talking to. His temper toward us has been very good, and he’s fully devoted to Yu Qingxuan. He’s not like someone who can’t even tell enemies and allies apart when his temper explodes,” said Xu Lanxin subtly.

“You two…! Have you really been bought with two jugs of wine?!” Yu Xiaoyun was furious. From the start, these two had been helping Long Chen, making him feel very uncomfortable.

Jiang Huixin glared at him. “Sister Lanxin is just joking. This temper of yours is just like when you were young. It hasn’t improved at all. I like that child Long Chen not because Qingxuan spoke up for him, or because of his talent, illustrious background, or even his wine. It is because that child Long Chen is full of love for this world. From his eyes, I can see a heart-aching pain. However, he is still full of light. Even if this world hurts him countless times, he still loves this world. This is something that we weren’t able to achieve in our youth. We were even rebellious and arrogant, despising this world for the pain it gave us. Although we might refuse to admit it, we’ve also gone through the black room’s torture. We might be able to lie to others, but we can’t lie to ourselves. For Long Chen to be able to fall asleep peacefully in the black room is proof that his inner heart is still pure. He is not afraid of his negative emotions.”

“The only reason he could sleep inside is because of his heart-devil! Who knows what he did during that time,” quibbled Yu Xiaoyun.

“No matter what you say, Long Chen is much stronger than we were back then. You can’t judge a person solely with your personal feelings. That would be too biased!” said Jiang Huixin.

“But I just don’t like that brat! It’s like that brat was an enemy from my past life!” Yu Xiaoyun shook his head.

“Of course, he was your enemy. Why else would he come to take away your treasured daughter?” laughed Xu Lanxin.

“Xiaoyun, there’s not that much time left. Let everyone relax and be happy for a bit!” Jiang Huixin suddenly sighed sadly.

When she said this, Yu Xiaoyun and Xu Lanxin fell silent. All three of them had a touch of sorrow on their faces.

…

“Long Chen, why are you suddenly interested in the imperial family’s cultivation grounds? I thought that you were going to keep evading my challenge. Didn’t you want to avoid revealing your power?” Yu Qianxue looked at Long Chen curiously as she brought them to an extravagant outdoor cultivation ground.

This cultivation ground was a place only princes, princesses, and those with special status plates could enter. It was the highest level cultivation ground in the empire.

Even princes and princesses had to pay money to enter this place. However, they then could enjoy the most accurate tests and greatest trials by fire.

“I heard that you have special instruments to test someone’s power. I want to try it!”

Long Chen smiled. He was looking to see how far he was from the dragon expert’s requirement.

“Oh, isn’t this Long Chen, the frog lusting after the swan's flesh?” Just then, an arrogant voice full of provocation rang out.
