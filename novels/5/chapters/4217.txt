Chapter 4206 Shadow Sect, Wind Sect, Ice Emperor Line

This sudden attack caused countless startled cries to erupt. The Xu family’s experts in particular were enraged.

Xu Yifeng and Xu Xin-er immediately attacked, their blows causing the void to collapse. However, they were just too slow and their attacks missed the target.

A head fell from the sky to the ground, rolling toward that person’s feet.

It was only then that this person’s headless corpse fell. The head was perfectly aligned with his neck, but its eyes had lost their luster and the soul within had dispersed.

“Who did it?! Get out here!”

Xu Yifeng let out a thunderous roar, causing violet qi to surge around him. After all, killing a member of his Violet Blood race was a declaration of war to them all.

“Anyone who targets my big brother Long Chen can’t blame me for not being courteous.”

An icy voice rang out. Following that, a girl appeared, looking to only be thirteen years old. She wore skintight black leather robes, and although her appearance was still tender, they still hugged her body tightly.

“Who are you?!” demanded Xu Xin-er furiously.

“Shadow Sect, Dong Mingyu.”

As the girl reported her name, multiple figures silently appeared beside her, akin to a group of phantoms. No one was able to sense their existence.

Among them were both men and women, all wearing stoic expressions and emotionless eyes. Upon looking at them, all the experts here felt a shiver in their souls.

“Shadow Sect…!” Someone gulped loudly enough for everyone to hear. After all, the Shadow Sect was the place where the most terrifying assassins were born. The Bloodkill Hall and the Nine Underworld Hall were unable to compare to them.

Other assassins took missions, but the Shadow Sect’s assassins specialized in hunting down their own kind, earning them the grim moniker of "assassinators of assassins." They were regarded as the most formidable harbingers of death.

In the past, people had only heard of tales about them but never actually seen them. They were essentially a legendary existence.

However, when Dong Mingyu killed that fellow, and experts on Xu Yifeng and Xu Xin-er’s level couldn’t intervene, everyone here was bearing witness to the style of the Shadow Sect’s assassins.

When the Shadow Sect’s disciples appeared, despite their modest numbers, they still shook the hearts of countless onlookers.

These assassins were like phantoms that could come and go whenever they wanted without anyone being the wiser. It was as if they could appear right behind anyone unnoticed, and in an instant, their daggers would cut off heads.

“Courting death! Who do you think your Shadow Sect is?! Do you think my Violet Blood race’s Xu family is afraid of you?!” roared Xu Yifeng.

“You’re the ones courting death!”

Just then, a sneer rang out. Following that, countless people made a path for a group of men and women in fluttering light blue robes.

Their leader in particular was like a fairy of the nine heavens. Her robes and long hair billowed around her, and every single one of her steps was graceful and light.

She was surrounded by swirling pale blue wind blades that left long black lines in the void.

For peak experts, breaking the void was not difficult, and even tearing it apart couldn’t count as impressive. However, the way these wind blades sliced through the void in utter silence caused countless peak experts to feel astonished.

This showed that her control over wind energy had reached a pinnacle, and her wind blades could move according to her will. How could they defend against such a thing?

Most terrifying of all, these wind blades were not intentionally summoned by her; they were the result of the wind energy of heaven and earth naturally gathering around her.

This woman’s arrival sent ripples of shock through the spectators. After all, she was followed by hundreds of experts, all of whom were the very rare wind element experts.

“Who are you?” shouted Xu Xin-er in shock and anger.

“Wind Sect, Tang Wan-er.”

This woman was precisely Tang Wan-er, and she eyed Xu Xin-er fiercely.

“You shameless girl, why are you targeting Long Chen like this? Speak! Are you trying to draw Long Chen’s attention? Will you then display your womanly skills to seduce him? Everyone knows that this fellow Long Chen is a fickle pervert. He’ll easily fall for such a thing. Tell me, am I right?”

Toward the end, Tang Wan-er was clenching her teeth as if she really was about to bite someone. On the other hand, Xu Xin-er was left befuddled by the sudden twist in her story, not knowing how to reply.

Long Chen and the others were delighted by Dong Mingyu and Tang Wan-er’s arrival. But just as Long Chen was about to step forward and greet them, Tang Wan-er’s words almost caused him to stumble to the ground.

“Familiar. It’s the same familiar Tang Wan-er.” Guo Ran helplessly shrugged with an odd expression.

When Tang Wan-er first appeared, Guo Ran and the rest were shaken by her terrifying power and the foreign aura around her. However, these words directly rekindled a familiar sensation, letting them recall the intense jealousy that burned within her, now even more intense than before.

“You… what nonsense are you spouting?!” Xu Xin-er shouted indignantly. With her status, how could she bother seducing anyone?

“Hmph, you can’t even talk properly! You were planning to seduce him, weren’t you?! You slutty evil woman, come over here! I’ll teach you a lesson!” Tang Wan-er pointed at Xu Xin-er angrily.

Xu Xin-er was completely befuddled but also enraged that she felt like she might explode. She was somehow being insulted as some seductive whore. In all her years, it was her first time being insulted like this.Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

Furthermore, countless people were staring at her oddly, seemingly approving of Tang Wan-er’s words. This fueled her anger even further, causing her body to quiver.

“Who cares about the Wind Sect?! Since you want to die so badly, I’ll kill you right now!”

Xu Xin-er roared. As she no longer cared about her image, killing intent directly burst out of her.

“Then we’ll have to see if you have that ability!”

When this voice rang out, a sharp pain struck everyone’s ears. It was as if their ears became frozen.

The next moment, the world turned cold, and pure white snow began to drift through the air. In mere seconds, the earth was covered in frost.

As the sound of footsteps appeared on top of the frozen ground, some people made a path for the newcomers. They could see a group of people walking over, led by a white-robed peerless ice beauty.

She was like a flawless ice sculpture of a goddess, and her skin was like white crystal, emitting a strange luster. There was nothing to nitpick about her appearance. Seeing her, Long Chen began to quiver with excitement.

“Ice Emperor line, Ye Zhiqiu.”

Before the Xu family’s people asked, that woman already reported her origins, causing a lot of people around to gasp in surprise.

“The Ice Emperor line?! Isn’t that an immemorial inheritance?!” Startled cries rang out. Legend had it that the Ice Emperor line had gone extinct long ago. But now the Ice Emperor’s descendants had appeared once again.

“Little Yu, Big Sister Zhiqiu, don’t fight with me over her. I’m going to teach this shameless woman a lesson!” exclaimed Tang Wan-er. She seemed intent on fighting to the death with Xu Xin-er.

Xu Xin-er was incensed. Although she knew that the Shadow Sect, Wind Sect, and Ice Emperor line were not pushovers, she had her own pride that did not permit her to retreat. She then stepped forward, but before she could speak, a figure shot over like a bolt of lightning.
