Chapter 3291 Snatching the Seed Pod

They were like ants in a line sneaking their way into a gaping maw. Fortunately, those black dragons didn’t notice them at all. They continued to slumber with their eyes closed.

As they got closer to the black dragons, the dragon might shook their souls. They almost collapsed.

“Long Chen, what is it?” asked Bai Shishi when she saw Long Chen quivering.

“It’s nothing.” Long Chen said that he was fine. This was the result of the dragon might in the surroundings drawing out the pride of the dragon blood in his body.

That was not something good. He had concealed his aura, but his dragon blood was being influenced.

A true dragon was the ruler of the dragon race. To unleash dragon might in front of a true dragon was a provocation. 

Long Chen didn’t dare to get too close to the dragons. Otherwise, once their dragon might reached a certain level, it would cause his dragon blood to unleash its own dragon might. He wouldn’t be able to stop it.

Once Long Chen unleashed that aura, those black dragons would definitely view him as the greatest delicacy and treasure. By devouring him, they could obtain true dragon essence blood. That was enough to drive them all crazy.

Long Chen gave a signal to Bai Xiaole and the others. That was the order for them to slip toward the dragon eggs and await the next signal.

Bai Xiaole nodded and led the way to the dragon eggs. As for Long Chen and Bai Shishi, they went around the dragons and toward the blood pool.

Bai Xiaole and the others were in position, hiding behind the dragon eggs. Meanwhile, Long Chen pulled Bai Shishi over a huge detour. They slowly got closer to the Devil Eye Water Lily.

At this moment, Bai Shishi’s body began to tremble, and a sensation of dizziness came over her. Long Chen suddenly blocked her vision with his hand. Only then did that feeling of dizziness fade.

“Don’t look at its stamen. That is its eye, and it possesses a terrifying power. It can destroy a person’s soul,” transmitted Long Chen.

Bai Shishi’s heart quivered. This was her first time hearing the word ‘terrifying’ from Long Chen’s mouth.

Long Chen and Bai Shishi slowly got closer. However, for some reason, the closer they got, the greater the distance seemed to grow. It was like space was being stretched.

At this distance, Long Chen saw marks in the surroundings. They were like small streams pouring into the blood pool.

Long Chen’s heart shook. The vile dragons in the Vile Dragon Valley were prey for the black dragons. But these black dragons seemed to be nutrients for the Devil Eye Water Lily. Just what was its origin?

More and more, he felt that the Devil Eye Water Lily had not appeared here accidentally.

Finally, the two of them reached the blood pool. They were no more than a few miles from the Devil Eye Water Lily. Long Chen had Bai Shishi close her eyes.

“Just like when I helped you grasp your runes, you must strike just as I tell you to. Don’t think about it. Just directly attack with your sword. Use as much power as you can, but you won’t have any time to store up any energy.”

Bai Shishi nodded. She was a bit nervous. She felt that Long Chen was about to do something exceedingly terrifying. She couldn’t hesitate for even half a second.

Long Chen then closed his eyes and adjusted his condition. After a moment, he suddenly took a deep breath and charged toward the Devil Eye Water Lily like a bolt of lightning.

The Devil Eye Water Lily looked to only be thirty or so meters tall, but when he got close, he didn’t know if it got bigger or if he was getting smaller, but the Devil Eye Water Lily grew gigantic, until its leaves covered the heavens.

Long Chen slashed his bone saber at it. The bone saber’s runes lit up, filling this space with light. As a result, those black dragons were startled and shot up.

That was the signal for Bai Xiaole and the others. Bai Xiaole immediately activated his spatial energy, grabbing the dragon eggs.

At the same time, Jiang Yuhe and the others attacked. Rays of divine light shot toward the closest black dragon’s head.

BOOM!

It went without saying that their cooperation was well done. The moment Long Chen struck the lily, they attacked the dragon.

The dragon’s scales were broken, and blood sprayed out. It was left dazed by their combined attacks.

However, before Bai Xiaole could subdue it, a terrifying ripple exploded from the Devil Eye Water Lily. 

BOOM!

With the lily at the center, the ripple rapidly spread, smashing into the black dragons. Even they were unable to resist and were sent flying. Likewise, Bai Xiaole and the others were also sent flying. Fortunately, they were behind that black dragon. But even the weakened wave still left them feeling like their souls had almost been stripped from their bodies.

Bai Xiaole and the others were sent flying, but it was the black dragons that received the brunt of the ripple. So, they smashed into the wall like shooting stars. That wall was actually the ancient corpse’s skull, and the resulting impact caused the skull to collapse. Hence, Bai Xiaole and the others hastily dodged and ran, not wanting to be buried.

They were shocked by the power of that lily. When Long Chen had said that he and Bai Shishi would deal with the lily, they hadn’t understood why. Now they did. That lily was actually the most terrifying existence in this place.

Long Chen seemed to have expected this from the start. His divine ring raged behind him, and stars revolved in his eyes. He continued to press down on the lily with his bone saber.

More ripples surged out of the lily. As a result, this world was destroyed. Decayed bone fragments flew through the air.

Bai Xiaole and the others were sent tumbling back along with the black dragons. They were blown far into the distance.

Just at this moment, as Long Chen fought against the lily with his saber, the eye at the heart of the lily slowly began to shine. It was like an eye was opening.

That was its devil eye that was said to possess terrifying power. When its eye opened, Long Chen felt a sharp pain in his soul as an insidious energy invaded it.

Fortunately, Long Chen’s Divine Gate opened in his mind-sea and the Divine Gate Star shone. That invading energy was like snow falling on lava. It instantly vanished.

Suddenly, Long Chen slashed with his saber. Black lightning appeared on top of it. The lily quivered, and its petals closed, seemingly afraid of Lei Linger’s power.

“Attack!”

Long Chen shouted and Bai Shishi unsheathed her sword, slashing with her eyes closed.

What Bai Shishi was slashing was not the lily but a seed pod to the side. Just as the lily closed its petals, her sword slashed into the seed pod, severing it from its stalk.Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

“Let’s go!”

Long Chen grabbed the seed pod and tossed it into the primal chaos space. After that, lightning wings appeared on his back, and he shot away, dragging along Bai Shishi.

Long Chen had just fled when an explosion shook the land. At this moment, the blood pool vanished and the Devil Eye Water Lily suddenly grew larger. A terrifying killing intent filled this space.
