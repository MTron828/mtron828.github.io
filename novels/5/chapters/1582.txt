Chapter 1577 Invitation

Translator: BornToBe

“My apologies, but the Dragonblood Legion isn’t recruiting. We are one solid entity forged through battle. Whether it’s the first generation Dragonblood warriors or the second generation Dragonmark warriors, our emotions were born and baptized through blood and fire. There’s no way for others to gain such a relationship with us. Joining the Dragonblood Legion is not a matter of how high your cultivation base or how great your talent is. All the twelve thousand members of the Dragonblood Legion have one heart. Even if we wanted to accept you, without having gone through blood and fire, life and death, there’s no way we can be united. So thank you for thinking so highly of me, but I’m sorry to say that I cannot accept,” said Long Chen.

Although there were several Empyreans amongst the neutral camp, Long Chen couldn’t accept them.

It was as he said. The Dragonblood Legion was like a weapon forged together, and their forger was countless trials and tribulations. They had been smelted together by the merciless world with its cruel flames. After that forging, it was difficult for new people to join them.

Although they had felt that the chances were low, hearing this decisive answer still disappointed countless people.

“However, don’t be too disappointed. The Dragonblood Legion isn’t accepting new members, but the Xuantian Dao Sect’s large gates are open to any upright and open-hearted people. Although it’s not joining the Dragonblood Legion, joining the Xuantian Dao Sect will still allow us to fight shoulder to shoulder against our enemies,” said Long Chen.

Their eyes lit up. That was true. By joining the Xuantian Dao Sect, wouldn’t they have more chances to interact with Long Chen? Perhaps in the future, there would be a chance that they could join the Dragonblood Legion.

“I want to join the Xuantian Dao Sect. My sect is too cowardly and ordered me to join Sha Guangyan’s side. Such weak and cowardly higher-ups almost caused me to die. Fortunately, I was smart enough to choose the neutral camp, or I wouldn’t exist any longer. If I had listened to my sect’s orders, I’d have lost my life, so this life was won by me. I want to leave my sect and join the Xuantian Dao Sect. Would the Xuantian Dao Sect want a traitor like me?” asked a rank nine Celestial.

His voice quivered slightly, but he said what countless other disciples wanted to say. Of the disciples present, over eighty percent of them came from sects that had told them to join Sha Guangyan’s side.

Some sects had even ordered them to join that side, or they would be viewed as criminals who had betrayed their sects.

However, geniuses were naturally rebellious. It was hard to change what they had set their minds on.

Not all of them chose to stand on the neutral side because they believed Long Chen was falsely accused. There was also another portion that had simply been irritated by their sect’s orders and so they deliberately went against them.

However, now they felt a burst of fear, as well as anger toward their higher-ups. Those higher-ups had almost sent them to their deaths.

Betraying one’s sect made them traitors, and others would look down on them. That was a name that they would never be able to get rid of in their life.

However, who wouldn’t want to join the Xuantian Dao Sect? They had the old patriarch, a Netherpassage expert, as well as Long Chen’s Dragonblood Legion. Who could stop their rise now?

Anyone who joined the Dragonblood Legion would instantly have their status rise. The Xuantian Dao Sect’s brilliance would surpass all expectations for sure. Joining them was definitely the wisest decision.

However, would the Xuantian Dao Sect accept them, people who had betrayed their sect?

“The Dao is endless, while love should be limitless. The Xuantian Dao Sect’s cultivation is based on cultivating the Dao. The Dao contains all things, so we naturally have room to expand. As long as your hearts remain righteous, then no matter your status or talent, my Xuantian Dao Sect will welcome you.” Li Tianxuan smiled amicably.

However, inside, he was extremely moved. His palms were sweaty. He knew the Xuantian Dao Sect was truly rising.

“Many thanks, Xuan Master! Disciple wishes to join the Xuantian Dao Sect!” A rank nine Celestial flew over and kowtowed toward Li Tianxuan.

“I also want to.”

“I also- hey, don’t push me!”

“Whose hands are those? If you dare to touch me again, I’ll kill you right now!”

Everything became chaotic as the heavenly geniuses of the neutral camp fought to fly to the front.

Tens of thousands of experts were rushing over. Sixty to seventy percent of those experts were rank nine Celestials. Liu Cang’s smile looked like a flower in bloom.

There was no way to differentiate them into inner and outer sect disciples. These people were all geniuses amongst geniuses, experts amongst experts.

The Xuantian Dao Sect had now picked up countless treasures- no, the treasures had taken the initiative to jump into their hands. It wasn’t even possible to pick them all up.

Wang Zhen couldn’t help but bitterly smile. He looked at Hua Shiyu, Zhao Ziyan, and the others. He saw a similar sadness in their eyes.

They were originally the Xuantian Dao Sect’s top geniuses. However, once these people joined, they would immediately be drowned out. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

Li Tianxuan patted Wang Zhen on the shoulder. “Don’t be dejected. You will always be the heavenly geniuses of the Xuantian Dao Sect. No one will surpass you. Of course, that’s on the precondition that you don’t compare yourself to Long Chen.

“Xuan Master, disciple isn’t jealous...” Wang Zhen hastily tried to explain himself.

Li Tianxuan waved his hand. “All of you are disciples I’ve seen growing up. Other than that little monster Long Chen, I’m clear on everything in your hearts. Don’t worry. The Xuantian Dao Sect’s karmic luck is soaring into the sky. As witnesses to the Xuantian Dao Sect’s rise, you are the favorites of this generation of the Xuantian Dao Sect. Once everything’s over, I will activate the karmic luck blessing. You’ll all have a chance of becoming Empyreans,” said Li Tianxuan confidently.

His confidence stemmed from Long Chen. Long Chen had truly been ruthless during the Dragon Slaughtering Convention. Practically, all the Eastern Xuan Region’s experts had been drawn over, and over a hundred sects had been destroyed during this convention. The world was changing because of him.

Karmic luck had become increasingly turbulent. With so many geniuses joining the Xuantian Dao Sect, they would bring all the Eastern Xuan Region’s karmic luck with them.

Li Tianxuan was so excited not just because of all these genius disciples joining, but also the endless karmic luck they were bringing with them. That was the true priceless treasure.

There were even two Empyreans who decided to join the Xuantian Dao Sect after hesitating for a long time. The Elders almost went crazy with joy.

As more disciples joined the Xuantian Dao Sect, the senior experts from the other sects turned ashen. The Xuantian Dao Sect’s rise was now set in stone. No one could possibly stop them now.

The ancient race experts didn’t want to keep watching this, and they left dejectedly. The ancient family alliance’s experts also left in groups.

In the end, there were only a few experts of the Righteous path that refused to leave. Li Tianxuan knew what they wanted. He said, “My Xuantian Dao Sect cultivates the Dao. Although we can only understand the slightest fraction of the true Dao, we know how to distinguish right and wrong. This time, Long Chen really went a bit too far. When my Xuantian Dao Sect calms down, we’ll make sure to send over some humble gifts as an apology.”

Li Tianxuan was very experienced with how the world worked. He knew that these people were afraid of the Xuantian Dao Sect causing trouble for them once they grew stronger.

However, his words were humble, expressing his attitude: the things in the past were in the past. He wouldn’t bother them over it. They could all just get along.

His last sentence in particular was giving them face. After all, Long Chen had killed all their disciples. Offering some compensation was alright since they were the ultimate winners.

“We wouldn’t dare to accept. Once the Xuantian Dao Sect rebuilds, please send a message to me, Qi Yunao. I promise to come celebrate with you,” said a smiling elder.

Long Chen’s face twitched. How shameless did someone have to be to act like this? Just now, this person had been shouting to kill him. Just how fake were people?

For profit, a person’s two-faced nature would reveal itself. Even their emotions were fake. Just what was the point of their cultivation? What was the point of their life? Could it be that cultivation was not to live with dignity but so that you could do whatever you wanted?

What made Long Chen speechless was that there were even more shameless sect leaders who now went over to Li Tianxuan, exchanging conversation with him. Some people even praised Long Chen for being so talented at such a young age.

A strange smile appeared on Long Chen’s face. Yes, he supposed he really was talented to have killed all their elite disciples.

He turned away from them. These people might have smiles on their faces now, but Long Chen saw their killing intent and resentment clearer than anyone.

These people simply swayed whichever way the wind blew, but they always left themselves a path out. Long Chen dared to guarantee that if Pill Valley rose and the Xuantian Dao Sect was in an inferior position, their fake smiles would instantly transform into icy sneers. They wouldn’t hesitate to raise their butcher’s knife against the Xuantian Dao Sect. Perhaps this was simply the cultivation world. It was full of fake, dislikable people.

Liu Cang, the Tower Department Head, and the Elders were busy registering disciples, while Li Tianxuan was busy conversing with the hypocritical sect leaders. Qu Jianying, the patriarch, and the old man didn’t say anything. They just watched calmly.

After these Righteous experts were done with their fake congratulations, they departed. Some of the neutral camp’s disciples also began to leave now. The battle today had ended, and it was time for them to leave.

Due to various reasons, they didn’t want to leave their sects. After all, no matter how bad a sect was, it was still their home. No one would want to leave their home.

From a distance, Long Chen watched a group of women leave. Appearing isolated and alone, Zi Yan led the Illusive Music Immortal Palace’s disciples away.

Although Long Chen hadn’t looked at her, he knew that Zi Yan had been watching him the entire time. She had wanted to say something several times, but in the end, she had merely sighed and left.

Staring at Zi Yan’s distant back, even Long Chen didn’t know what emotion he was feeling. In any case, he was feeling very unwell.

Meng Qi held his hand. She softly said, “You know, she’s a good person.”

“I know. Unfortunately, we’re fated to be enemies,” sighed Long Chen. This world was just too irritating. It had to force him to become someone that repaid kindness with enmity.

“Long Chen, I don’t think you should stay in the Eastern Xuan Region any longer. Come with me to the Central Xuan Region!” Once the outsiders had left, Qu Jianying, who had been silent for so long, suddenly opened her mouth.
