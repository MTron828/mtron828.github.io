Chapter 4555 Underworld Race Experts

“The aura of the Netherworld!”

When Long Chen saw this bald man, his heart shook, and the image of Wu Tian appeared in his mind.

What made Long Chen feel curious was that their auras were a bit similar; however, they were fundamentally different. That was because this person had the aura of the Underworld race on him.

Wu Tian was from the Nether race—the archenemy of the Underworld race. If this person was from the same race as Wu Tian, he wouldn’t possibly have the aura of the Underworld race on him.

The bald man was also looking at Long Chen. When their eyes met, Long Chen felt his qi flowing rapidly within him. This bald man was extremely dangerous, triggering Long Chen’s sense of danger.

If Long Chen let this baldy get any closer, his astral energy would automatically erupt, and there would be no concealing his true power at that point.

Feng You stared at the bald man with vigilance and clenched her spear tightly. Her intuition was screaming at her that this baldy was dangerous.

“A human? Why does your aura make me feel such dislike?” The bald man stopped where he was and looked at Long Chen coldly.

They were three hundred meters apart. This was the limit. Any closer, and Long Chen’s astral energy would erupt.

Long Chen could tell that this baldy was masking his power as well, and if they got any closer, his power would erupt in the same way. It seemed that both parties were concealing their true strength.

“It’s very simple. You dislike me because I have more hair on my head than you,” replied Long Chen as he shrugged and smiled.

Under normal circumstances, Feng You and the others might have burst into laughter at such a statement. But now, silence hung heavy in the air. Feng You felt a chill creeping over her soul as she instinctively summoned her golden shield.

The bald man’s gaze hardened, and the people around him mirrored his hostility, their weapons materializing in their grasp. Seeing this, the mixed beast race’s experts readied themselves for combat.

As the tension thickened, the surrounding factions pulled back, creating more space for them to fight.

In truth, this place was no longer far from the gate, so those who could come here were essentially peak experts. A single gaze from them was enough to scare off others and let them go through.

While scuffles were constant in the outer region, this place was much quieter. However, once a battle started in this place, it would definitely be a shocking battle. Thus, the surrounding experts quickly retreated.

“Long Chen, be careful. I’m not confident in defeating him,” transmitted Feng You.

“Don’t worry, I’m also not confident in beating you,” said the bald man lightly.

Feng You was shocked. This man actually heard her spiritual message as well.

“Furthermore, you have a sinister human with you. We should be the ones to worry,” added the bald man.

Hearing that, Feng You and the others were shocked. Why did this bald man have such a high opinion of Long Chen?

However, Long Chen truly did have endless tricks up his sleeves, so the mixed beast race’s experts thought that the bald man was scared of those tricks, unaware that the baldy was actually on guard against Long Chen’s true power.

“A smart head really doesn’t grow hair. The legends are true. I’m curious, are you from the Netherworld? Or are you a native expert?” asked Long Chen in a friendly manner.

The bald man didn’t reply and counter-asked instead, “I don’t like the human race but not to the point of feeling such loathing. Whenever I see you, I feel disgust deep in my soul. Can you tell me why that is?”

“Didn’t I tell you? Our conflicts stem from the black and dense hair on my head.” Long Chen pointed to his hair.

The fact that Long Chen teased their leader twice caused the experts around the bald man to grow restless. Their killing intent was blazing.

However, the bald man was quite calm, not revealing the slightest bit of anger. His eyes were locked onto Long Chen as if trying to pierce through his soul.

Long Chen suddenly smiled. “You’re eager to uncover my secrets, just as I am to uncover yours. Yet, when I asked, you didn’t answer. Similarly, I don’t have the obligation to answer you either. How about we have a fair exchange? You can ask me a question, and I’ll answer. Then I’ll pose a question, and you do the same.”

“Oh? It’s not a bad idea, but the human race is treacherous. How do I know that you’ll tell the truth?” asked the bald man.

Long Chen’s tone dropped in disdain. “This just proves that you aren’t on the same level as me. Fine, pretend I didn’t say anything. But out of my way, we’re moving forward.”

Feng You and the others jumped in fright. Long Chen intended to pass by this terrifying person?

The bald man frowned. With a hint of reluctance, he said, “Fine, I’ll trust you this once. I’ll ask you first. Why do you have the aura of the Netherworld’s god race on you?” 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

“Because my woman comes from the Netherworld’s god race,” Long Chen answered directly. “It’s my turn. What relation do you have with the Three-Headed Heaven Devouring Beast race?”

“Just who are you?!” The bald man’s voice boomed, his calmness shattered. A surge of killing intent exploded out of him, causing his subordinates’ auras to flare up.

The mixed beast race’s people involuntarily took a step back in the face of this overwhelming presence, not out of lack of courage, but driven by an instinctual fear that penetrated deep into their souls.

Feng You stepped in front of Long Chen, ready to fight at any moment. Seeing this, Long Chen simply smiled and told her not to worry.

“Answer me,” Long Chen said.

“Brat, you’re courting death! You dare to repeatedly offend me, Wu Hun!” threatened the bald man as he pointed his broadsword at Long Chen.

“Answer me, otherwise... don’t blame me for being ruthless,” repeated Long Chen.

Long Chen’s smile suddenly vanished, replaced by an icy killing intent. The atmosphere grew so cold that it felt as though the world itself had been encased in ice, causing even the Heavenly Daos to quiver.

Upon hearing this person’s name, Long Chen instantly understood. He was a traitor to the Three-Headed Heaven Devouring Beast race.
