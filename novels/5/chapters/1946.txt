Chapter 1936: 1936

Above the Martial Heaven Sea-Ring, everyone from the Dragonblood Legion was gathered . They were a bit nervous, as well as excited .

They all felt the barrier in front of them weakening . They were just one step away from advancing to the Life Star realm . As long as they underwent the lightning tribulation, they would become Life Star experts .

However, they knew that with Long Chen, their lightning tribulation wouldn’t be the same as other people’s . They would challenge the strongest kind of heavenly tribulation . This would be a battle .

Other than the Dragonblood warriors, Yue Xihan had also come . Looking over them, she said, “The Life Star realm condenses the energy of your Yuan Spirit and Dantian together . By borrowing the energy of heavenly tribulation, you condense your Dantian’s formless qi into a solid entity . The two kinds of energy will form an astral space inside you . From then, you won’t need to rely on spatial rings . This astral space is your Life Star Bead . However, you will condense two Life Star Beads . One will represent the past, and one will represent the future .

“Essentially all experts will choose to extract the Life Star Bead of their past, because what they want is a new start for their future . That way, their mental realm will become like a sheet of blank paper, and they can rewrite what they want while abandoning what they don’t, making their future cultivation even easier . However, Long Chen has told me that all your past experiences are very important to you, so you won’t abandon the Life Star Bead of the past . Then what you need to two is merge the two Life Star Beads together . Doing such a thing requires much more tribulation lightning and will require a powerful will from each of you .

“This is something very dangerous . One reason is because heavenly tribulation can’t be controlled . If it’s not strong enough, you will fail to merge your two Life Star Beads . The other reason is that doing such a thing has high requirements when it comes to your willpower, Yuan Spirit, and Spiritual Strength . You have to prepare yourselves . ”

Long Chen and the others had never experienced the Life Star realm, but Yue Xiyan was explaining some things that they needed to take note of .

“Don’t worry, we actually have plentiful experience when it comes to heavenly tribulation,” said Long Chen .

Even as the leader of the original devil race, Yue Xihan had never heard of over ten thousand people undergoing tribulation together . Long Chen always did things that others would never do . She was a bit worried, but he seemed confident .

Yue Xihan nodded and led away a dozen experts of the original devil race . They made sure to distance themselves but be close enough to watch . Although Long Chen was confident, she still wasn’t at ease .

Although Long Chen was a nine star heir, such a crazy action could not be controlled . If something unexpected happened, the results would be unimaginable .

Despite that, Yue Xihan respected Long Chen’s choice . She led her people further away and activated a grand formation to conceal them . That way, they wouldn’t be sensed by the Heavenly Daos . If there was something wrong, they might be able to help .

“Should we open the spatial watching channel?” asked one of the experts she had brought .

Yue Xihan nodded . “That’s a good idea . Let the disciples see how the Dragonblood Legion undergoes tribulation . Even if things go wrong, they might be able to learn something . ”

That expert formed hand seals, and a giant channel appeared behind him . It was like an eye watching the Dragonblood Legion in the distance .

Within the ancestral lands of the original devil race, a giant projection appeared in the sky . The figures within that projection were Long Chen and the others . The disciples of the original devil race looked up to watch . Even the disciples still attempting the Devil Blood Pool stopped to watch . ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

“What are they doing?”

“Could it be...”

Those disciples stared, dumbfounded . They thought of something that they didn’t dare to imagine .

“Begin! Let’s not waste any time,” said Long Chen .

BOOM!

The Dragonblood Legion’s people unleashed their auras . Pillars of light soared into the sky as they all began attacking the Life Star realm at the same time .

As they broke through the barrier, the sky darkened and black clouds covered the sky . The world became silent .

“My eyes are being opened to the world . I’ve never seen such a terrifying lightning tribulation . The scope is even greater than when I advanced into Netherpassage,” said one of the original devil race’s experts .

After passing through the mental journey part of advancing to the Netherpassage realm, success meant returning and undergoing heavenly tribulation . But even Netherpassage experts were stunned by this tribulation . Although the strength of the tribulation wasn’t as great, the scale was even greater .

“Kill!”

However, the next scene made those Netherpassage experts dumbstruck . All the Dragonblood warriors suddenly began to attack the tribulation clouds that were gathering .

“Are they crazy?!” cried one of the Netherpassage experts . They were actually attacking heavenly tribulation? Wasn’t that becoming enemies with the Heavenly Daos? Did they even care about their lives?

Over ten thousand attacks struck the tribulation clouds, creating a large hole in the middle .

The tribulation clouds surged, seemingly furious . They regenerated, growing denser . However, the Dragonblood warriors’ attacks didn’t stop .

“They’re...” One of the original devil race’s experts sighed but swallowed his last two words .

However, everyone knew that he was about to say that they were courting death . This truly was suicide . Even Yue Xihan frowned .

Although she knew that the original devil race had a connection to the nine star heirs, she wasn’t qualified to know those secrets . So she couldn’t comprehend what Long Chen was currently doing .

As the Dragonblood warriors attacked, the clouds grew thicker, and it was like a Magical Beast had been provoked . Heavenly might crashed down from the sky .

Suddenly, blinding lightning flashed amongst the originally dark clouds . It was like a sea of lightning falling from the sky, and it enveloped the Dragonblood Legion .

Within that sea of lightning, the roaring of lightning beasts could be heard .

“Lightning beasts have already appeared in the first wave?!”

The first wave of the tribulation was the weakest and was usually to leave room for people to get used to the lightning .

The strength of the rest of the tribulation could be seen by the first wave . Normally, lightning beasts would only appear at the end .

“Kill!”

The Dragonblood warriors raised their divine items, slaughtering these lightning beasts . The lightning beasts transformed into lightning runes that were absorbed by the Dragonblood warriors .

As they absorbed the lightning, their Dantians began to change . They shrank, and the energy of their Yuan Spirit and Spiritual Strength was absorbed by their Dantians, gradually condensing into a small dot .

That small dot was the embryonic Life Star Bead . As it grew larger, it would become the true Life Star Bead, and then it would fracture into two .

For most cultivators, all they needed to do was take out the Life Star Bead of their past so that they could continue with their Life Star Bead of the future . That would create its own astral space, and they would have advanced to the Life Star realm .

However, Long Chen wanted everyone to merge their Life Star Beads that would fracture them back into one, combining their past and future .

That required a huge amount of tribulation lightning energy, as well as Yuan Spirit energy and Spiritual Strength . Now they didn’t need to worry about the amount of lightning tribulation energy . They crazily absorbed it .

Long Chen was also immersed in the lightning . Lei Long was floating behind him, but it only devoured any fellows that attacked it . Lightning on this level was no longer able to interest it .

Long Chen didn’t attack the tribulation clouds . He was waiting for everyone to absorb enough energy .

He looked at Yue Xiaoqian in the crowd and saw that there were more lightning beasts attacking her . That meant that she really was rejected by the world, and so she was receiving special treatment .

More and more lightning beasts appeared, and they grew larger and more powerful . However, the Dragonblood warriors were still able to easily handle them .

Cloud had taken human form and was also fighting alongside everyone else . She was using a sword and was able to kill the lightning beasts easily, but her movements were stiff . She clearly wasn’t too used to her human form .

However, if she wanted a greater comprehension of the Heavenly Daos, she had to get used to it . It would be greatly beneficial .

That was because humans were the most spiritual of lifeforms . Although the Xuan Beasts possessed terrifying bodies, they weren’t as close to the Heavenly Daos, and those closest to the Heavenly Daos had the highest chances of ascension . So the experts of the Xuan Beasts all had to get used to human forms .

As for the human race, they also had flaws and were extremely envious of the Xuan Beasts’ powerful bodies, thinking them to be the strongest .

However, if the Xuan Beasts really were the strongest, why would they choose to take human form . So foolish people really had different brains than normal people . They were simply incapable of communicating .

Two hours later, the lighting beasts were so powerful that they were comparable to twelfth rank Magical Beasts . The Dragonblood Legion was starting to find it taxing .

However, it wasn’t that they weren’t strong enough to fight them, but that they were distracted by having to condense their Life Star Beads at the same time .

“Lei Long, help them out . I’ll let you have some good food in a bit . ”

Long Chen waved his hand, and Lei Long roared . A giant lightning sphere shot out .
