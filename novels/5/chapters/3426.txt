Chapter 3415 Surrounded by Difficulty

Following the sound of the bell, the eighth prince and the others returned to their own respective spots in line.

Lei Yuner then handed Long Chen a spatial ring. “There are seventy thousand immortal king crystals inside. You have your own line. Once you are there, hand over the money and activate your status plate.”

Long Chen received the spatial ring. He knew that it must have been difficult to borrow so much money at this time. She had probably been mocked during the process.

Although he hadn’t known her for a long time, he understood her character. She was an extremely proud person, but she was willing to lower her noble head for him.

“Go. Don’t be angry. Once we enter the Divine Lord Immortal Realm, we’ll go to the world core and snatch their karmic luck,” said Lei Yuner comfortingly.

She had previously mentioned entering the world core with Long Chen. Now, it seemed that so many people had joined forces for the same goal. It would be up to each side to see how much energy they could absorb.

Long Chen then nodded and brought the spatial ring to his line. This was a line for foreign experts. Because he came late, he lined up at the end.

“Did you see? He is the one that the Lightning Falcon race favors.”

“Tch, someone who relies on selling out the human race’s bloodline to ingratiate themselves with the demonic beast race. What a loss of face for the human race.”

“Exactly. He actually acts arrogant after doing that? It’s disgusting.”

Once Long Chen was in line, quite a few humans pointed at him. Although they were mocking him, they couldn’t conceal the envy in their eyes. They also wished that they could marry into the demonic beast race, but they weren’t qualified to do so.

“Wouldn’t it be nice to just live properly? Why court death? I don’t want to kill people, so why must they force me?” Long Chen shook his head and sighed.

As fellow humans, these people had no amiability for him, only hostility and jealousy. It was like without Long Chen, Lei Yuner would have picked them. Their ugly appearances were truly nauseating.

Long Chen even felt that in comparison, the demonic beasts were easier to get to know. At least, their characters were simpler and more straightforward.

They weren’t like humans who were clearly envious and yet had to put on such sanctimonious airs. The latter would criticize others from up above while it was their own hearts that were the most twisted.

It was like a palm-sized loincloth was able to cover up their ugly natures. Just looking at their hateful appearances, Long Chen unconsciously clenched his fists.

After a few hours, it was finally Long Chen’s turn. He handed his tablet to a half-step World King in charge. The latter then took his tablet and spatial ring. After eyeing Long Chen, he coldly said, “I heard that you are an alchemist”Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

“Is it any of your business?” replied Long Chen and he narrowed his eyes. Unexpectedly, even the Sacred Pill Hall’s people were finding trouble for him.

The half-step World King sneered, “Little fellow, your words are tough. You don’t really think that hugging the leg of the Lightning Falcon race will allow you to do whatever you please, do you?”

Long Chen also sneered and got closer to the elder. “It seems that the only ones capable of doing what they please is your Sacred Pill Hall, right? Even the rules can be randomly changed. No matter how strong I am, I can’t be as tyrannical as you, isn’t that right?”

The elder actually nodded. “It’s good that you know. Remember where this place is. Remember whose word counts here. It would be best if you didn’t cause any trouble here. Otherwise, no one will be able to protect you.”

After that, he stuck a golden rune to the back of Long Chen’s tablet and handed it back to him.

Long Chen received the tablet. Looking at the half-step World King’s disdainful appearance, he smiled. “Hehe, I don’t cause trouble. But if I do, it would definitely be an accident.”

“You…”

The half-step World King’s expression sank, but Long Chen was already walking away, sticking out his middle finger at the elder as he walked away.

The half-step World King didn’t know what it meant, but there was no way this middle finger could mean anything good.

“What are you waiting for?! Hurry up and get over here. Are you waiting for this old man to personally drag you here?” demanded the elder darkly, scaring the next person in line behind Long Chen to the point that he couldn’t even move. It seemed as if the elder was planning on releasing his anger on him.

Long Chen had received his ticket to enter the Divine Lord Immortal Realm. He was thinking of how to make money and repay Lei Yuner’s favor.

Huo Linger and the Demon Moon Furnace were already refining the Lightning Spirit Blood Soul Pills in the primal chaos space. He had as many ingredients for them as he wanted. 

However, he felt that just those pills weren’t enough to repay Lei Yuner’s favor. He was trying to think of something better so that he could feel at ease when he left.

Long Chen had just walked back when Lei Yuner found him, and Ying Bokong was right behind her. The three of them then walked down a long path. There was another large plaza at the end of the path.

There were already millions and millions of people present. A giant screen of light could be seen at the front of the plaza. Through the light, they could see a desolate world.

It was a mountainous land without a single blade of grass growing on it. But this desolate world still gave off a feeling of immense vitality.

“That is the Divine Lord Immortal Realm. It is a treasured land specially built for Four Peak experts to advance. The laws here are complete, and there is abundant spiritual qi. Heavenly tribulations also become gentle due to the influence of the world core. Moreover, people can freely absorb thunderforce when they undergo tribulation here. It is said that this place was created by the Sacred Pill Hall using Divine Venerate Brahma’s power. This world requires a supreme divine energy that is independent of the Heavenly Daos. Furthermore, it is said that the world core of the Divine Lord Immortal Realm is connected to the core of the Integral Heaven Star-Field. Those who advance within the world core will obtain the approval of the entire Integral Heaven Star-Field,” said Lei Yuner excitedly.

It was precisely due to this that even powerful races like the Lightning Falcon race, Mammoth Divine Elephant race, and Water Mallard race would choose to come here despite having their own inheritance lands for their advancements. The core of a star-field was extremely attractive.

“The core of a star-field?”

Long Chen suddenly thought of the Martial Heaven Continent. Wasn’t it also the core of a star-field? Could it be that this core would be just like the Martial Heaven Continent’s core?

Just then, a large platform rose above the screen of light, and eight half-step World Kings appeared. They stood around the platform, holding their weapons vigilantly.

Long Chen was startled. What was going on? Once the eight of them were standing steadily, a wooden cross rose out of the center of the platform. There was a person chained to the cross. When Long Chen saw that person, his heart pounded wildly. His blood instantly ignited.

“A nine star heir!”
