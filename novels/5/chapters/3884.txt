Chapter 3873 Guo Ran vs. Weng Tianyao

This person was the Violet Thunderclap Empire’s number one expert, Weng Tianyao. Furthermore, there were thousands of the Violet Thunderclap Empire’s heavenly geniuses around him.

During his heavenly tribulation, Lei Linger had taken his priceless treasure, the Wild Blade. That was the divine weapon that Weng Taibei had used to sweep through the world, and Weng Tianyao viewed it as important as his life. For it to have been taken by Lei Linger, he was driven practically insane.

After the tribulation, he went into seclusion to recover and somehow found a treasure land to absorb primal chaos qi. There, he solidified his realm and also prepared to condense a Heavenly Dao Crown. Only by condensing it could he unleash the full potential of his innate thunderforce.

Once his preparations to condense a Heavenly Dao Crown were complete, he planned to start looking for Long Chen to take back his Wild Blade. The Wild Blade was a peerless divine weapon, the national treasure of the Violet Thunderclap Empire. Thus, its importance could not be overstated, and it could not be allowed to fall into other people’s hands.

He then gathered the Violet Thunderclap Empire’s experts and drove away all the other lifeforms in a treasure land. They dominated that place, but after spending a few days absorbing the resources there, they were disturbed by the dragon mark phenomenon. As a result, they abandoned their treasure land and came here.

Although Long Chen was covered in golden divine radiance and looked like a statue, Weng Tianyao would recognize him no matter what. Even if Long Chen turned into dust, Weng Tianyao would recognize him.

“Die!”

Weng Tianyao furiously attacked without hesitation. His lightning spear pierced toward Long Chen.

He could tell that Long Chen was in a special state. As Long Chen couldn’t fight back, this was the optimal time to kill him.

BOOM!

However, halfway there, a figure suddenly appeared before him, blocking his way. With a single punch, golden light erupted, and his lightning spear was shattered.

Terrifying qi waves surged, blasting Weng Tianyao back. Having been consumed by his fury, he actually hadn’t noticed Guo Ran behind Long Chen.

Guo Ran was standing in the air, still in his punching posture with his body covered in golden scales. At this moment, a dragon cry seemed to still hang in the air, like a roar that came from the distant past. The divine light made Guo Ran appear exceptionally majestic.

Right now, endless power surged within Guo Ran’s body. It was like the tide of the great sea, possessing unimaginable strength.

The current Guo Ran was incredibly excited. In his entire life, he had never felt such terrifying power. He almost couldn’t believe that this immense power was his.

The power of the dragon blood circulated within him, and his Supreme Bone’s runes also flowed around his arm. With the dragon blood’s support, all the runes of the Supreme Bone were fully activated. Even without his battle armor, he was capable of drawing out the full power of his Supreme Bone.

Most terrifying of all, with his dragon blood, his Supreme Bone’s runes became exceptionally active. They were nourished by the dragon blood, seemingly undergoing a metamorphosis just like Guo Ran.

“Who are you?” demanded Weng Tianyao.

“Long Chen’s subordinate, general of the Dragonblood Legion, Guo Ran!” announced Guo Ran.

“What Dragonblood Legion? What general? That’s all dogshit! You can die first!”

Weng Tianyao roared furiously. After learning that Guo Ran was Long Chen’s subordinate, he no longer had any misgivings. A giant sea of lightning then appeared behind him. He had summoned his manifestation.

“Who do you think you are to dare say such big words? Come! Grandpa Guo will teach you how to behave!” sneered Guo Ran.

He was filled with power and didn’t fear anyone. In front of Weng Tianyao’s challenge, Guo Ran directly charged over.

His golden battle sabers rumbled as the power of his dragon blood erupted.

“Split the Heavens 1!”

When Guo Ran unleashed Split the Heavens, divine light lit up behind his head, illuminating heaven and earth. At that moment, Guo Ran seemed to become a god in control of this world, in control of all laws of heaven and earth.

When he unleashed this saber attack, countless currents of invisible energy poured into his sabers, and their power grew explosively. This phenomenon even shocked Guo Ran.

“Heavenly Dao Crown?! Impossible!”

Weng Tianyao’s expression completely changed when he saw the light behind Guo Ran’s head. How could someone have condensed a Heavenly Dao Crown so quickly?

“Heavenly Lightning Divine Shield!”

Weng Tianyao hurriedly slammed his hands together. His manifestation actually surged in front of him, and the giant sea of lightning instantly condensed into a three-meter shield.

The lightning shield rumbled. It was incredibly solid and emitted a terrifying divine pressure, as well as the aura of heavenly punishment. His thunderforce also came from heavenly tribulation, so it was filled with the destructive power of tribulation lightning.

BOOM!

When Guo Ran’s saber fell, Weng Tianyao’s solid shield crumbled instantly in front of everyone’s shocked gazes.

Guo Ran’s saber attack continued, aiming for his neck. However, Weng Tianyao hurriedly twisted his body, causing the saber to slightly miss. After that, his protective lightning armor shattered, and a giant cut was left in his chest. It was so deep that others could see bone.

Weng Tianyao fled, but Guo Ran simply stood there foolishly instead of chasing. He himself was stunned by his terrifying power.

“So a Heavenly Dao Crown actually has such a terrifying power. Once I attack, the Heavenly Daos resonate and assist me. It increases my attack power by multiple times.” Guo Ran stared at his saber as if he was in a dream.

The moment he attacked, it felt like an invisible hand of the world also held his saber, multiplying its power.

“Primals? Supremes? Those are all dogshit compared to grandpa Guo! I am the true chosen of the heavens! I’m your daddy, hahaha!” Guo Ran raised his head and laughed as if he had gone insane.

This one attack taught him what it meant to be close to the Heavenly Daos. Previously, he had thought that it meant to borrow the power of the Heavenly Daos, using a very humble attitude of asking for aid. Moreover, the power that could be borrowed was limited.

However, now it was different. The moment he attacked, the heavens didn’t need him to ask, and he didn’t need to borrow anything. The heavens directly gave him power without asking.

“Bastard, so what?! Even if you have condensed a Heavenly Dao Crown, I can still kill you!” Weng Tianyao roared and his manifestation once more appeared. This time, a heavenly tower was present in his manifestation. At the same time, an identical tower appeared in his hand.

Once this tower appeared, waves of lightning scoured heaven and earth. An enormous space tens of thousands of miles wide became filled with endless lightning as if heavenly tribulation had descended.

“Tch, who are you trying to scare? Come! Today, I’ll make you beg for mercy!”

Guo Ran’s confidence was already inflated. Even in front of this unknown tower, he wasn’t the slightest bit afraid.

“Young master, there are immemorial dragon corpses nearby that no one has occupied yet. But people are coming quickly. If we still don’t make a move…” At this moment, one of the experts of the Violet Thunderclap Empire shouted. They had noticed the other dragon corpses.

Just as Weng Tianyao was about to unleash the power of his tower, he heard this person’s shout and hesitated. He clenched his teeth.Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“Brat, I’ll let you live a few more days.”

In the end, he chose to first occupy one of the dragon corpses. Every dragon corpse was equivalent to a primal chaos source. It was where the primal chaos qi was gushing out the most. What he needed most right now was primal chaos qi. It was his ultimate goal in coming here.

He could also tell that since Guo Ran had condensed a Heavenly Dao Crown, although he was confident that he could still beat Guo Ran, it would not be a matter of one of two moves. As he didn’t have that much time to waste, he chose to give up.

“How gutless. You’re quite good at acting tough,” said Guo Ran disdainfully. However, he didn’t chase after him. He had to guard Long Chen and Mo Nian, so he didn’t dare to go too far.

Suddenly, space shook and Guo Ran jumped in shock. He then roared furiously and directly slashed his saber in Long Chen’s direction.

However, he was still slightly too slow. A dagger flickered with cold light, stabbing toward Long Chen on the dragon scale.
