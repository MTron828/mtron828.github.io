Chapter 4890 Ghost Nether Rat

The green grass was like a mattress stretching as far as the eye could see. It would have been a beautiful and peaceful sight if not for its strange green color, which induced nervousness.

Each blade of grass stood three inches tall, identical in height. They resembled swords pointed towards the sky, forming an eerie uniformity. Even more unsettling, a glimmering light danced atop the grass. While it should have been a sign of thriving vitality, it made Long Chen's hair stand on end.

“Something’s wrong...”

Long Chen’s instinct directly detected that this grass was dangerous, too bizarre. After all, there weren't any other weeds within this lawn of grass, not even trees or any rocks.

Long Chen reached out to grab one stalk of the green grass. Just then, the tiniest of thorns sprouted from the grass—almost imperceptible to the naked eye. It stabbed Long Chen’s finger, causing a tingling sensation to appear on his fingertip.

“Amazing,” Long Chen remarked, surprised. Although he wasn’t in his combat state, his tough skin was not something an ordinary weapon could penetrate easily. While the thorn wasn’t able to break through, just the light glimmering on it was enough to make his finger feel slightly numb—it was highly toxic. If it were to actually pierce the flesh, it could be fatal. Furthermore, the entire plain of grass was composed of the same toxic variety.

“This grass has corrosive power and also contains the qi of corpse devils. Hmm, the roots go deep into the ground, so there must be something there. Mo Nian was right about there being some kind of treasure in this area.”

Mo Nian hadn’t even come here, but he still managed to sense that there was something extraordinary here. If he wasn’t pressed for time, he definitely would have come here himself. However, he ended up leaving this mission to Long Chen.

Long Chen let go of the blade of grass and started walking deeper into this area. The further he went, the more bustling this strange grass became. After two hours, it had gone from being three inches tall to being a foot tall. The stalks were as sharp as blades. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

Although Long Chen was walking across the air, he didn’t dare to go too fast and was paying attention to any changes in the surroundings. Just what kind of terrifying existence lay hidden here?

Long Chen spent over an hour walking through this place, and the surroundings gradually grew dark. He was like a tiny boat on the sea, looking incredibly minuscule, like he would be devoured at any moment.

The further he went, the darker it became. This nameless grass was now three feet tall and swayed in the wind, seemingly concealing something. Someone else would have long since fled in fear, but Long Chen didn’t care. His attention was on what lay beneath the grass.

As he was traveling, without any warning, a black bolt suddenly shot toward him. It was a rat the size of a fist. Its entire body was black, and it even had a pair of tiny wings.

Long Chen instantly reached out to catch the rat, but he abruptly took out a sword to block it.

The rat’s sharp teeth punctured the sword, causing sparks to fly and two small holes to appear in the blade. Long Chen jumped in shock. This was a Saint weapon, but this rat had essentially destroyed it along with its item-spirit.

Long Chen examined the rat more closely and suddenly exclaimed, “It’s a Ghost Nether Rat!”

Just then, the rat lost its ferociousness and fled.

“You think you can run now?” When Long Chen waved his hand, the surrounding space twisted, and the Ghost Nether Rat bounced back. Long Chen caught it this time.

The Ghost Nether Rat screamed and struggled with all its might, but Long Chen was holding its neck so it couldn’t bite him.

“My luck’s not bad. I managed to run into a Ghost Nether Rat,” said Long Chen as he eyed it. There was something strange under the rat’s belly, like a sinister face. Seeing it, Long Chen was delighted. This thing was a treasure.

The Ghost Nether Rat was an extremely rare beast. Its teeth were venomous, and its wings were not there for flying purposes but to store its venom, which was as precious as immortal metal.

However, in comparison to its essence blood, its venom was practically worthless. The Ghost Nether Rat’s essence blood was a supreme Yin essence blood from which Heavenly Yin Water could be extracted.

Heavenly Yin Water was a kind of divine water from the primal chaos era, and it had long since vanished from the natural world. Heavenly Yin Water could now only be refined and synthesized through other means. It was something necessary for refining supreme Yang pills or supreme Yang weapons.

This was based on the principle that Yin and Yang could not exist without each other. Whether it was Yin or Yang, they could not be one hundred percent pure. If it was, it would either disperse or explode.

At the peak of Yin was Yang, and at the peak of Yang was Yin. This was a necessary law of the Heavenly Daos. Long Chen had refined supreme Yang pills before, but they were all beneath the level of Saint pills. He had yet to refine any supreme Yang Saint pills because he couldn’t find the necessary ingredient capable of balancing the energy of the pill.

Both Long Chen and the Earth Cauldron had been unhappy with this. Even the best cook could not make anything without ingredients. Thus, Long Chen was exceptionally excited to run into a Ghost Nether Rat. He quickly examined it to confirm that he hadn’t falsely recognized it.

“Your luck is taking a turn for the better,” said the Earth Cauldron, a trace of excitement creeping into its voice.

“Hehe, new year, new me,” Long Chen chuckled. He let the Ghost Nether Rat struggle in his hand. However, after struggling and screaming for a while, it suddenly started twitching.

Long Chen then took out a dagger and cut it open, causing a translucent liquid to pour out. With a jade cup, he caught all of it. That was its essence blood.

Once Long Chen was done bleeding it, the surrounding grass started to move wildly, and streaks of black light shot toward him.
