Chapter 3589

The dean had personally descended. He even praised Tu Hu and the others, causing countless people’s hearts to shake.

Ever since Guo Ran had obtained the proxy dean tablet, the entire Heavenly Dragon Divine Armor College felt like it was about to explode. Countless people begged to see the dean, and the Assembly Elders even blocked the gates to his residence, but Xue Yifan never gave them any reply.

It was only now that Xue Yifan appeared. Looking at the chaos, he wasn’t angry. Instead, he even seemed to be encouraging them. Now people were sure that Guo Ran’s tablet had been given by the dean.

Tu Hu and the others were in the midst of beating people to satisfaction when they saw the dean arrive. With the dean here, they felt bad beating people up, thus they reserved themselves, leaving over a hundred experts lying on the ground groaning in pain. They didn’t get up for a long time.

“Dean, you’ve hidden yourself for three full days, refusing to see us. What are you intending?” asked an Assembly Elder.

“It was to keep my ears clear of chatter. Even if I saw you, it wouldn’t change my decision. Moreover, your banal comments are irritating to listen to, so I decided to avoid it,” said Xue Yifan with a smile, not showing the slightest anger toward the Assembly Elder’s aggressive stance.

Xue Yifan sat down in his specific place. His position was facing everyone, and he could also see the entire martial stage.

“What kind of morality and capability does Guo Ran possess to represent the dean?! Why did you not inform the assembly first? If you just make decisions on your own, what is the point of having an assembly hall?” demanded another Assembly Elder, shouting passionately.

Of the twelve Assembly Elders, nine were standing together, all of them gloomy-faced. It seemed that they were ready to unite and target the dean.

Seeing that, everyone jumped in shock. What was going on? Nine Assembly Elders were questioning the dean at once? Was that an attempt to force the dean out of his position?

They knew that the assembly had almost the same authority as the dean. The reason that the assembly was established was precisely for fear of the dean’s authority growing too great. If the dean stubbornly clung to his own course and made the wrong decisions, there would be no one to stop him. Then the entire college would be destroyed.

This legislation started with good intentions. This way, the dean and the assembly would keep each other in check, allowing the college to maintain a perfect system. This would avoid fatal mistakes.

However, throughout history, although there had been disagreements between the dean and the assembly, everything had been settled through voting and peaceful settlements. There had never been such a thing before. After all, the Assembly Elders were absolutely enraged and fighting the dean openly now.

Hence, everyone’s heart began to pound hard. What kind of time was it for such a thing? The devil beasts were pressing on them from the outside. If the assembly and the dean started fighting, the entire Heavenly Dragon Divine Armor College would fracture.

“After today’s battle, you will know Guo Ran’s morality and capability. As for whether the assembly has any use or not, everyone, I’m sure you know it best!” said Xue Yifan, declining to give his own personal opinion.

“Boss, what is going on?” Seeing this scene, Guo Ran himself jumped in shock. The assembly wouldn’t really be trying to remove the dean, would they? Without the support of the dean, he would be doomed.

“The dean is using you to rebuild the Heavenly Dragon Divine Armor College. This dean’s vision really is far!” Long Chen looked at the calm Xue Yifan, as well as the gloomy Assembly Elders. He smiled.

Although Long Chen didn’t know how Xue Yifan would act exactly, he could see that he was a wise elder. Everything was under his control. In comparison, these elders of the assembly were worthless straw bags. They couldn’t even see what kind of time it was. They had lived all this time for nothing.

“Xue Yifan, what are you intending? If you don’t give us a clear explanation today, all of us Assembly Elders will immediately vote to cast you out! As long as eleven of us agree, you will need to abdicate your position as dean!” shouted an Assembly Elder threateningly.

According to the academy’s rules, if the dean did not handle things properly, severely affecting the college’s safety, then the twelve Assembly Elders had the authority to impeach him. If eleven of them agreed, then they could remove him from his position.

Hearing this, the millions of experts around the martial stage were completely silent. They could only hear their own heartbeats. This was a huge affair beyond anything that they had experienced.

“You’ve united nine of you. So you’re just missing two more?”

Xue Yifan smiled, calmly saying, “In truth, I’ve tolerated you for a long time. Seeing you walk further and further on your paths of courting death, I gave you many warnings. But you ignored them all.”

“You…!” Those Assembly Elders’ expressions immediately changed.

Xue Yifan didn’t give them a chance to speak, continuing, “The twelve elders of the assembly are supposed to mutually control the dean. This was the rule made by the Heavenly Dragon Divine Armor College. It was an ancient lesson inherited from the High Firmament Academy. Afraid that the dean’s authority would grow too big, if a shameful dean appeared, it would bring about the downfall of the college. Do the twelve of you Assembly Elders still remember the number one objective of the assembly? The Assembly Elders must be upright, not using their position for personal desires. They cannot touch the college’s wealth. All things must be considered from the viewpoint of the college as a whole. They must always be thinking of the college, loyal to the assembly. They would die to uphold the assembly’s sacred justice. Let me ask you, have you done any of that?”

Xue Yifan’s face grew strict, and even his voice grew cold. As a result, those Assembly Elders’ expressions all changed. A touch of panic appeared in their eyes.

“The current assembly has long since changed. You say that you are loyal to the college, loyal to the assembly, that you would die to uphold the assembly’s sacred justice. Tell me, were you upholding the assembly’s sacred justice, or were you simply upholding the profits and face of your families? Right now, which one of the twelve Assembly Elders is not a major businessman? Which one is not using their own authority to benefit their families? Do you really think that I don’t know about all those things you did? The assembly only possessed a sacred justice for the first thirteen generations. After that, they were seduced by privilege and profit. The corruption in the assembly grew until you were all fighting each other for profit regardless of means, regardless of honor and shame. What kind of time is it for you to be stuffing your pockets as much as possible? What time is it for you to be suppressing the college’s talents? Your eyes can only see the profits before you, but not the crisis pressing down on you. You can only be called the peak of foolishness. What right do you have to be Assembly Elders?”

Xue Yifan grew angrier and angrier as he spoke, until his voice was like thunder shaking the air, shaking the nine heavens. His voice even contained killing intent that made their hearts turn ice-cold.

“Dean, the time for my fight with Guo Ran has come. I hope that you permit this battle.” Just then, Wang Zixu walked forward.

Guo Ran was startled. What was the meaning of this fellow running forward at this time? Was he challenging the dean’s dignity?

“This fellow is on the side of the Assembly Elders. He is challenging you now to turn the tides, to twist the crux of the battle. If he kills you, he will be the proxy dean. Then when he stands on the side of the assembly, even the dean might not be able to punish the Assembly Elders for their sins. This battle will decide their life and death,” said Long Chen. He had seen such a thing many times. Wang Zixu had no choice but to walk forward.

Guo Ran wasn’t too foolish. Knowing that this was the time, that this was the chance for him to display his abilities, he cleared his throat and shouted, “I swept through the four seas and crossed a thousand mountains, causing huge waves between heaven and earth. My battle armor’s divine blades could settle all lands beneath the heavens. I am the unrivaled hero, Guo Ran! Wang Zixu, do you have any final words to say? If you don’t say them now, you’ll never have a chance to do so in the future!”

Guo Ran appeared on the martial stage, appearing incredibly domineering and wild. In the eyes of the disciples of the Heavenly Dragon Divine Armor College, he seemed like a different person. His previous yes-man self had changed to the point of even saying such an arrogant and shameless verse. It stunned people.

“A loser general is all you are. What face do you have to be so arrogant?”

Wang Zixu also came onto the stage. Just as both of them were on the martial stage, the grand formation activated. Rays of divine light then enveloped the martial stage, a sign that the battle was about to start. Tu Hu and the others’ hearts instantly clenched.
