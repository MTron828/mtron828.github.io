Chapter 4307 The Fisherman Profits

“Not good!”

Long Chen was startled. These two terrifying existences seemed to have gotten angry and were now using their core energy.

Long Chen directly dragged Guo Ran and Xia Chen behind him. Just as he stepped in front of them, it felt as if a meteor were colliding with him. The tremendous force nearly caused him to cough up blood.

BOOM!

A wave of death spread, razing the ground, leaving heaven and earth devoid of color. After the impact, Long Chen, Xia Chen, and Guo Ran found themselves enveloped in darkness, dazed.

Long Chen carefully poked his head out of the mud, and to his surprise, this world had become a barren wasteland. Cracks permeated the atmosphere, and thunderous lightning roared. It was like this place had suddenly become hell.

Looking at the core of the battlefield, he saw that the golden-winged expert’s aura had weakened a great deal.

It let out a roar and flapped its wings, transforming into a streak of light that vanished instantly. It seemed that it had lost and had no choice but to leave.

“Damn, even from such a distance, the shockwaves alone were enough to almost crush us. Eternal experts really are terrifying!” said Xia Chen.

It had to be known that they were incredibly far from the two creatures, but the shockwaves of their collision were so terrifying. If it weren’t for Long Chen bearing the brunt of the impact, the two of them would have been utterly crushed.

“Those two probably don’t count as terrifying existences here.” Long Chen shook his head gravely.

“Why not?” asked Xia Chen and Guo Ran.

“Think about it. Why hasn't any other lifeform intervened in their battle? It's likely that they don't have any allies to aid them,” said Long Chen.

“Boss, are you saying that they’re similar to our rogue cultivators?!” exclaimed Guo Ran.

Just then, the black tortoise also took off, its four legs bringing it away surprisingly fast. The earth quivered as it ran.

“We’re going after it.” Long Chen waved his hand.

“Boss, what are you planning?” asked Guo Ran.

“Hehe, the black tortoise is badly wounded. It's probably returning to its lair to recuperate. Let's see if we can take advantage of it," Long Chen chuckled.

Take advantage of an Eternal expert? Guo Ran and Xia Chen both swallowed nervously, astounded by Long Chen's guts.

Long Chen guided them toward the black tortoise by tracing its aura. The three of them maintained their concealed auras, and before long, they arrived at a colossal mountain range.

The three of them were shaken to see this mountain range. Within these mountains lay numerous dilapidated structures and ruins, resembling what might have once been a domain of the human race.

However, those buildings were all badly damaged and covered in vegetation. Only a few unremarkable traces hinted at the possibility that this might have once been a habitation of the human race.

“This old tortoise is actually using the human race’s land to recuperate?” said Xia Chen hatefully.

Looking at those ruins, Xia Chen was unable to imagine just how miserable and helpless the human race must have felt during their downfall.

BOOM!

Just then, the enormous black tortoise squatted down at the center of the valley, and there lay a substantial concave hollow that matched its form precisely.

“That concave hollow looks odd. It seems that there’s a formation underground,” said Xia Chen suddenly.

“Are you sure?” Long Chen was startled.Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

Xia Chen examined it more closely before confidently saying, “I’m sure. There are fluctuations of a formation. There is some kind of energy coming from underground, and it’s not natural.”

“Boss, can the three of us really kill that old tortoise?” asked Guo Ran.

“Our chances are slim. An Eternal expert that grew up in a place with abundant primal chaos qi will essentially exist as long as heaven and earth. Furthermore, the tortoise race is renowned for its exceptional defense. Even my Seven Peak Sword might not be enough to break its defenses. And even if it could, it might not be able to deal a mortal blow.” Long Chen shook his head as he was uncertain too.

After all, his knowledge of the lifeforms here is limited, so they shouldn’t make any rash movements. If they were to anger this black tortoise, they might not even have a chance to flee.

“Then poison?” proposed Guo Ran.

“We don’t have anything toxic enough,” said Xia Chen immediately. “What kind of poison do you think can affect this terrifying fellow?”

Long Chen nodded. All their poisons came from the Nirvana Overflow Heaven, so it was essentially impossible for them to use poison to kill this terrifying existence. Furthermore, even if they did have such a poison, considering its enormous body, just how much poison would it need to kill this creature, and how were they supposed to poison it? Bait? But they didn’t have any bait either.

Even considering its low intelligence, such a terrifying creature might not succumb to poison even if they filled its entire stomach with it.

As a result, Long Chen was caught in a difficult spot. The aura of the black tortoise had weakened; it was clearly gravely wounded. But even in that state, they might not be able to deal with it.

“Do I have to use the Earth Cauldron?”

Long Chen suddenly had a thought, but he quickly dismissed it. The Earth Cauldron was not a weapon designed for killing. If he couldn’t kill the tortoise in one blow, it would be troublesome. He didn’t dare to take such a risk.

“Let’s keep observing. Perhaps there is an open wound or a vulnerable spot we can exploit. Even if we can’t kill it in one blow, we must at least be able to deal a heavy blow in one move in order to make this work,” said Long Chen.

The three of them slowly got closer to the valley. Suddenly, Long Chen grabbed Xia Chen and Guo Ran and gestured to be silent. Guo Ran and Xia Chen were startled and instantly went still.

Even after a long moment, the black tortoise remained entirely motionless. Turning to Long Chen, they followed his gesture and glanced upward.

What they witnessed sent shivers down their spines: an immense figure was silently drawing near, not too far off. It was the very same golden-winged devil they had previously spotted.

Upon seeing it, the three of them were so scared that they didn’t even dare to move. They couldn’t find the courage to even use spiritual transmissions, fearing that even faint spiritual fluctuations might alert the creature to their presence.

Clearly, this golden-winged devil was quite crafty. It had pretended to flee but had snuck its way back, wanting to launch a sneak attack while the black tortoise was still injured.

However, could such a straightforward ruse really work? The three of them were baffled. This kind of scheme was far too naive. Would the black tortoise really fall for it?

They remained completely still, observing the situation. The golden-winged devil gradually drew near to the valley. It then slowly extended its head and opened its mouth.

Buzz.

A ray of golden light suddenly shot out of its mouth, shooting straight for the black tortoise’s head.

“Idiot!”

Long Chen almost cursed out loud when he saw the golden-winged devil’s attack.

BOOM!

Just as Long Chen expected, the black tortoise promptly withdrew into its shell, causing the sneak attack to miss entirely. Even people not from the tortoise race knew that tortoises were most agile when retracting their heads into their shells. Did this winged devil really aim for its head? There was no chance that it would land.

The black tortoise’s five-colored divine light once more blazed around its body. It pressed its legs against the ground and dashed toward the golden-winged devil like a multicolored shooting star.

BOOM!

A powerful explosion erupted. Seeing this scene, Long Chen decided to abandon the concealment and raised a hand.

“Seven Peak Shield!”

A shield of seven-colored divine light condensed in front of the three of them.

BOOM!

In an instant, the Seven Peak Shield shattered, and the three of them were sent tumbling back.

As a result of the collision with the tortoise's shell, the golden-winged devil was left with broken bones and torn muscles. It spat out blood, and its aura experienced a sharp decline.

“Now is our chance! Kill them!”

Long Chen spread his Kunpeng wings and shot toward the black tortoise’s head.

“Supreme Seven Peak Thrust!”

A seven-color spear appeared in Long Chen’s hand, blazing with divine radiance as it pierced toward the black tortoise’s giant eye.
