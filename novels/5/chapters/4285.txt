Chapter 4274 Half-Step Eternal Experts

“Senior apprentice-brother Long Chen, why did you give up on your vengeance?! Why didn’t you kill Long Aotian?!” shouted one expert angrily. Even his eyes were red.

Long Chen laughed, “Killing him means nothing. In my heart, your lives are more important. After all, we are comrades who have fought alongside each other, brothers who share life and death. You were willing to risk your lives to help me. Naturally, I must be able to do the same for you. As for Long Aotian? I can kill him whenever I want at a later time.”

“Big Brother Long Chen…”

Some of them began to weep. They had never expected that such a small decision on their part could win them the favor of a peerless expert like Long Chen.

“Good brothers. Follow me out. Every single one of you is the hope of the human race. If you really treat me as a brother, you will leave this place alive!”

As he shouted, he took out a devil weapon in the form of a saber, as he couldn’t be bothered to pick anything better. He then directly led everyone to charge out of the blockade.

After all, time waited for no one. Long Chen had to lead everyone out as fast as possible. If they were completely caught, there was no way that he could protect everyone.

They charged toward a human race’s camp, as this would force their assailants to encircle a larger area if they intended to trap them. This offered them a glimmer of hope to kill their way out successfully.

Long Chen, leading the vanguard with his devil saber, was like a god of war. With stars flickering on his saber, he was unstoppable. Even innate Heaven Venerates were unable to halt him in the slightest.

Long Chen was at the front, while the Undying race’s experts were at the rear. They charged out, leaving mountains of corpses and rivers of blood in their wake.

“Quick, leave!”

Just then, the human race’s side also charged over to reach them. Bai Zhantang was the first to reach them with the academy’s experts.

“You won’t be leaving today!”

Just then, violet qi burst out as the Xu family’s experts attacked them.

Violet qi reverberated through the heavens, causing Long Chen and his comrades to stagger. A terrifying pressure made them feel like their blood was about to freeze.

“A half-step Eternal is attacking a group of juniors? Have all your years been squandered living like a dog?"

Just then, an icy snort rang out, and a bone spear pierced toward the Xu family head.

Seeing this scene, Xu Changchuan and the rest of the Fullmoon race’s experts were overjoyed. Their race leader had also come to rescue them.

The bone spear pierced the dome of the heavens, causing the expression of the Xu family head to change. His violet saber then slashed the void.

BOOM!

The world quaked as a result of the collision, and the staggering force left countless individuals with the sensation of being trampled upon by some enormous beast.

As a result, many experts hacked up blood. They were terrified. This was the power of a half-step Eternal expert.𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

The earth began to crack and cave in. The collision between half-step Eternal experts caused the very land to deform.

“When did the Fullmoon race become the human race’s pets?!” shouted the Xu family head furiously.

“Your mouth really is repulsive.” Xu Jianxiong snorted and attacked him once more.

“Long Chen, bring them away!” shouted Bai Xiaole’s mother. Originally, she had been planning on using pupil art to directly transport them away. However, she was afraid of some powerful expert interrupting her technique. That would be too dangerous to the people being transported, and they might even be crushed by spatial energy.

Additionally, space was in constant flux on this battlefield, so it would still be quite dangerous to do so. Furthermore, with even half-step Eternal experts starting to fight, the spatial laws were constantly being broken, rendering even spatial transportation talismans ineffective.

With Bai Zhantang and the others helping, the pressure on the Dragonblood Legion instantly lightened. As long as they weren’t surrounded and locked in, they still had options.

At the rear, two dragons were still wreaking havoc. Lei Linger was slaughtering the Heavenly Lightning Violet Salamander race’s experts with the Wild Blade, and every time she killed one, she would pluck their scales. After all, those scales possessed the heaven-defying ability to absorb the world’s thunderforce. They were essentially miniature spirit gathering formations to Lei Linger.

In Lei Linger’s hands, these scales could unleash power a thousand times more potent than in the possession of the Heavenly Lightning Violet Salamander race, providing her with an inexhaustible source of power.

At first, the Heavenly Lightning Violet Salamander race’s experts were still crazily attacking her, but they soon came to recognize the absolute terror that Lei Linger embodied. She practically had an undying body.

BOOM!

The race leader relied on his Eternal divine weapon to blow apart Lei Linger’s Wild Blade. But just at that moment, he was shocked to find that the ancestral Eternal divine weapon of their race suddenly fell out of his control. It actually escaped him and appeared in Lei Linger’s hand.

The race leader was still befuddled by what had just happened when Lei Linger cut him in two with one slash of her new sword.

During the fight, Lei Linger used her soul to commune with this lightning sword. As a result, the item-spirit of the Eternal divine weapon was awakened, and it chose to directly accept Lei Linger as master.

With this Eternal divine weapon, the experts of the Heavenly Lightning Violet Salamander race were cut down like cabbages. Every blow of her sword killed them in droves.

As a result, the Heavenly Lightning Violet Salamander race was now retreating. On Huo Linger’s side, she had also communed with a flame attribute Eternal divine weapon from some unlucky Heaven Venerate, and it was also a sword.

With Eternal divine weapons in their hands, the two were like killing goddesses crazily slaughtering experts of various races. It was only because of them that those experts didn’t dare to go too far, which lessened the pressure on Long Chen and the others.

More and more experts flocked to their side. Some came to help Long Chen and the others to escape, but most of them wanted to kill them.

The battlefield continued to move as Long Chen and the others dashed away, quickly leaving the scope of the Sage King Prefecture. Although Long Chen and the others were fast, their pursuers were not slow either. Hence, the battlefield continued to move, leaving endless corpses in its wake.

Suddenly, space quivered as a devil expert appeared in front of them and attacked Long Chen.

Everyone was startled. This was a terrifying half-step Eternal expert. Furthermore, he had managed to conceal himself perfectly, waiting for them to run into him.

However, just as he revealed himself, his body was suddenly ripped in two by a pair of large hands.
