Chapter 2786 Hu Feng Falls

Everyone was dumbfounded. A person that no one had expected to come had appeared. Yu Qingxuan descended like a fairy.

Pill Valley had been hiding ever since the dark era’s battles started, and there were all kinds of rumors stating that Pill Valley and the divine families were jackals of the same tribe. However, the Pill Fairy had appeared at this time to save Yue Zifeng.

Yue Zifeng had used his fingers as a sword to pierce Ye Ming’s chest. Driven by his fury and hate, Yue Zifeng finally comprehended the power of the Sword God that Ling Yunzi had taught him.

However, after this one attack, Yue Zifeng’s body collapsed. He had used up all his power with this attack and fainted.

The Pill Fairy waved her hand, sending Yue Zifeng out. After that, Mo Nian and the others received him. The Life God Tree’s branches then wrapped around him to help him recover.

With the Life God Tree, as long as someone didn’t instantly die, they could still be saved. With Yue Zifeng saved, everyone looked at the Pill Fairy, unable to imagine why she would appear now.

“Brahma’s power? You are Lord Brahma’s follower? What are you doing?” Ye Ming stared at the Pill Fairy in shock and then anger. He spoke of Lord Brahma with reverence, but he was infuriated that one of his followers would block him.

“There is no need for you to kill him,” said the Pill Fairy indifferently.

There was divine light flowing around the Pill Fairy’s body, giving her a holy and sacred appearance. Her voice also contained unquestionable might.

“Fine. Then please get out of the way. I only want this person and the core,” said Ye Ming.

“No. You can’t kill him.” The Pill Fairy shook her head. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

Ye Ming’s fury burst. “Just who are you?! If you are Lord Brahma’s follower, you shouldn’t be blocking me. We’re all listening to Lord Brahma’s orders in this battle. Do you want to switch sides now? Have you betrayed Lord Brahma?!”

Ye Ming’s furious roar stunned everyone. Ye Ming had just inadvertently exposed a shocking secret. It seemed that this entire battle was due to Lord Brahma.

“Betraying him doesn’t matter. I never believed in him. I also had no choice in becoming his divine daughter. With me present today, don’t even think about passing,” said the Pill Fairy.

“Traitor! I’ll tidy up Lord Brahma’s followers today!” roared Ye Ming, his divine energy erupting. A torrential power forced back the Pill Fairy’s body.

BOOM!

The space behind the Pill Fairy collapsed, revealing two divine statues. It was Lord Brahma and Fallen Daynight.

At this moment, divine light filled the world, and the sound of sacred chanting resounded. Divine light shone out of the Pill Fairy.

“Bullshit! You are a traitor! How can you still use Lord Brahma’s power?!” raged Ye Ming.

The space beneath Ye Ming collapsed, and he was forced to retreat step by step. By the seventh step, he was already far into the distance.

With Ye Ming repelled, Mo Nian and the others felt the pressure on them lessen. It was like they finally got a breath of air after drowning. Ye Ming’s divine energy was suffocating.

BOOM!

An intense explosion shook the world. Ye Ming was knocked back by the Pill Fairy’s sword, and then the Daynight Furnace appeared, smashing him. With the support of the Pill Fairy’s divine energy, its power was completely unprecedented. It was like a star smashing into Ye Ming’s body.

Ye Ming was then sent smashing into the earth, causing it to ripple like water. After that, a wave of earth soared into the sky, burying countless cities.

“Defend!” Song Mingyuan and Li Qi hastily summoned an earthen shield around everyone. At the same time, the Life God Tree and the mother tree’s branches wove into another barrier.

BOOM!

The branches exploded along with the earthen shield. People felt like their bodies had been wrung.

When they crawled out of the earth, they found that the entire world’s terrain had changed. They couldn’t even tell its original appearance.

The mother tree and the Life God Tree once more spread their branches. After that, Guo Ran looked in Yun Tian’s direction and saw that his barrier was still fine, allowing him to sigh with relief.

However, when he looked closer, he saw that Yun Tian’s eyes had already lost their light. His physical body was dead, and only his soul was still maintaining the barrier.

The barrier had reached its limit. But with its protection, everything happening in the outside world was unable to disturb Long Chen.

“Boss Yun Tian!” Mo Nian couldn’t help tearing up. Yun Tian was an astonishingly talented person, yet he had been willing to be a protector instead of the main character, essentially covering up his glorious light.

At this moment, more and more of the invading experts began to pop out of the ground as well. They continued attacking Yun Tian.

“Kill, kill them all!” roared Mo Nian. Yun Tian’s death filled him with pain, and this hatred was cast on these invaders.

His arrows then rained down and blood-colored light glowed on them. Mo Nian was using his essence blood as arrows, which left a path of devastation in their path. They reached all the way to the end of the world, leaving a line of corpses and blood.

With Mo Nian’s overflowing killing intent, he didn’t mind sacrificing the power of his essence blood for greater killing power. Right now, killing countless invaders vented the hatred in his heart. A blood debt must be repaid with blood.

BOOM!

In the distance, the Brahma Divine Diagram appeared, causing space to collapse. It instantly sucked Ye Ming in. The Pill Fairy and Ye Ming then began to fight inside of the divine diagram.

All of a sudden, a roar reverberated through the air, and the Nine-Headed Lion’s aura was gone. Just like Ye Ming, his god was infuriated by his weakness and killed him to fully possess him.

After that, the Alldevil Heavenwalker’s aura also erupted to a new level. With a palm, the Heaven Reaching Devil Ape was blown apart.

It wasn’t just the Heaven Reaching Devil Ape that was destroyed, but Hu Feng’s aura also vanished along with it.

Amongst the remains of the devil ape were a few broken bone tiles. Those were the Nine Heavenly Tiles of the Gambling Heavenly Dao. But now, they were broken and fell into the ground, their divine light extinguished and covered by the earth.

“Hu Feng…”

Guo Ran and the others were filled with grief as Hu Feng fell. Their comrades were dying one by one.

“All of you can die now!”

The Alldevil Heavenwalker suddenly unleashed a punch at the void. As a result, the four spatial gates were blown open, and countless foreign experts charged out.
