Chapter 3703 Vermilion Bird Will

“This is the Vermilion Bird’s undying will!” exclaimed Yu Qingxuan.

“Perhaps this is considered another kind of rebirth.” Long Chen also hadn’t expected the Vermilion Bird’s will to be so tough. It had been preserved after all this time.

“Long Chen, I really have to thank you. You’re amazing! How did you find such a treasure?” Yu Qingxuan looked at Long Chen gratefully.

It had to be known that this was the will of the Vermilion Bird, and her Vermilion Bird Empire’s faith was based on the Vermilion Bird. The meaning behind this Vermilion Bird Hairpin was profoundly deep.

Her flame also contained a kind of faith energy, and this kind of faith energy was the perfect nourishment for this will of the Vermilion Bird. Perhaps the Vermilion Bird’s will could still be reborn as a spiritual body.

“Hahaha, it was nothing more than reaching out a single hand. After roaming the world for so many years, I naturally developed some sharper vision.” Long Chen laughed, very pleased with this result. He almost felt like he was floating when he saw Yu Qingxuan’s worshipful expression.

“Big brother, you’re so shameless. I was the one who found it,” transmitted Huo Linger a bit resentfully.

When Long Chen was passing by that scammer’s stall, Huo Linger told him that there was a treasure in his pile of trash. Only then did Long Chen squat down and start haggling with him.

Huo Linger’s spiritual perception was astonishing. She had also grown more sensitive to other flames after devouring the Yan Xu Flame. Without her, Long Chen would have never noticed the Vermilion Bird Hairpin.

“Give big brother some face! In the future, big brother will make it up to you!” Long Chen blushed and hastily consoled this little girl.

He knew that she originally wanted to devour the nirvanic bead. However, the nirvanic bead was essentially used up, and that bit of energy wasn’t that useful to her. To simply devour the Vermilion Bird Flame after obtaining it would be a waste of a treasure.

Only after Long Chen said this did Huo Linger stop saying anything. She then continued sleeping within the crown of the Seven Treasure Colored Glass Tree. Ever since it appeared, she and Lei Linger refused to leave its branches.

To use their words, sleeping within the tree, they felt like they were growing with each passing day. Their minds were growing sharper as well.

“Huo Linger, help me out. Lend your flame energy to big brother,” said Long Chen.

“Big brother, now you’re using my energy as a favor to others? You’re evil.” Huo Linger pouted.

But even though she grumbled, she still passed her energy to Long Chen, who then pressed a finger on the Vermilion Bird Hairpin. Flame energy gushed into it.

Huo Linger’s energy was extremely mixed. She had all kinds of energy. It wasn’t like Yu Qingxuan who only had a single pure kind of energy.

At this moment, more marks appeared on the hairpin. They were actually made of tiny runes smaller than the point of a needle. The Vermilion Bird within the nirvanic bead also grew livelier.

“This is…!” Yu Qingxuan almost jumped when she saw those runes. Those were the ancestral runes of the Vermilion Bird, the Vermilion Bird’s core runes. Every single rune represented a kind of divine ability.

When Huo Linger’s energy entered, the entire hairpin seemed to become a divine weapon. It was like the Vermilion Bird had awoken. Its divine light seemed to contain an ancient Vermilion Bird spreading its wings toward the heavens, leaving behind a rainbow light. That light was like a dream, infatuating people.Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

The Vermilion Bird Hairpin seemed to have come to life. It actually began to automatically absorb the flame energy of heaven and earth. Seeing that this was about enough, Long Chen retracted his hand to avoid Huo Linger using up too much energy.

The hairpin was shining brightly and drew countless people’s attention. Greed then appeared in people’s eyes, but they didn’t dare to even form a wicked thought. The Vermilion Bird Empire could not be provoked.

“How beautiful!” This divine radiance caused Yu Qingxuan to sigh in amazement. Furthermore, the Vermilion Bird seemed to come to life. Its divine light was beautiful and holy.

“This hairpin is a perfect match for you. It seems that it has always been waiting for you. Here, I’ll help you put it on.” Long Chen smiled and slowly inserted the hairpin into Yu Qingxuan’s hair.

Yu Qingxuan blushed. This action was a bit too intimate. Furthermore, it was done in front of a huge crowd.

However, she felt Long Chen’s warmth. Since she was happy inside, she let Long Chen put it on her. Eunuch Wei’s reminder had long since left her head.

“Beautiful. The two of you clearly match each other,” praised Long Chen.

Yu Qingxuan was already a peerless beauty, but with this hairpin and its divine light, she seemed covered in a holy halo, like a heavenly fairy walking the mortal world. It gave people an urge to prostrate themselves toward her.

Long Chen was excited. While it was Yu Qingxuan who obtained the treasure, Long Chen was even happier than her. That sincere smile moved Yu Qingxuan immensely. It was as though even if the rest of the world abandoned her, this man would forever be by her side. There was no way to describe that warm feeling.

“Princess! You… you seem to have awakened the Vermilion Bird Divine Radiance!”

Suddenly, a female disciple of the Vermilion Bird Empire cried out in disbelief.

With that cry, everyone looked at Yu Qingxuan. If they looked closely, they could vaguely see a clump of light behind her head that contained a mysterious figure.

However, it was too dim and indistinct. It kept forming and disappearing. There was no way to see it clearly. But the Vermilion Bird Empire’s people were delighted.

The Vermilion Bird Divine Radiance indicated that one had received the blessing of the ancient Vermilion Bird’s heroic spirit. A cultivator who sincerely communed with it would find it grow stronger until eventually, they would be able to use it to attack. It could save their lives at a critical moment.

It was said that at the peak of the Vermilion Bird Divine Radiance, it was possible to summon the Vermilion Bird’s heroic spirit. Of course, that was just a legend. There was no such record within history.

However, the Vermilion Bird Divine Radiance was so powerful that everyone within the Vermilion Bird Empire was aware of it. Furthermore, it was also a show of status. Once a person awakened the Vermilion Bird Divine Radiance, it meant that they were chosen by the Vermilion Bird. Their status would be completely different. Even if it was a commoner who awakened the Vermilion Bird Divine Radiance, they would be placed on equal footing with the lords of the empire.

Yu Qingxuan was also stunned. She hadn’t expected this hairpin to bring her so many benefits. She felt like she was dreaming.

“Princess will definitely soar in the future. Remember to pull me up if I don’t manage to do well for myself!” Long Chen cupped his fists to Yu Qingxuan.

Yu Qingxuan laughed and rebuked Long Chen with a light rap. This fellow was never serious, but she couldn’t help laughing around him. She liked his voice. Around him, she never even thought about maintaining some decorum. Fortunately, eunuch Wei wasn’t present, or she would have to listen to his nagging again.

“Qingxuan, let’s go. I want to introduce you to my two brothers.” Long Chen brought them all toward where Guo Ran and Xia Chen were.
