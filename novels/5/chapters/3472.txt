Chapter 3461 Ghost Dao Possession

Long Chen’s heart turned cold. Jia Luo was Lord Brahma’s youngest disciple. He had also appeared here?

Looking over, Long Chen saw the world rumbling. Bai Zhantang was fighting a slim man with a crown on his head.

What shocked Long Chen was that Bai Zhantang was no longer suppressing his cultivation base, and it was finally revealed that he was a half-step World King. Jia Luo was the same. When these two half-step World Kings fought, they shook the world.

“You trash, Bai Zhantang! You said that you would get revenge against me so long ago, but I’m still living so well! But what about your foolish son? Is he still alive?” sneered Jia Luo. He wielded a silver sword against Bai Zhantang, and silver light soared out.

The truth was that Bai Zhantang already had a grievance with Jia Luo. Back in the day, Bai Xiaole’s mother was injured by this fellow, which harmed the fetus she was carrying. This was what had caused Bai Xiaole to be born with deficiencies, resulting in him having to go through so much pain.

Just thinking of that drove Bai Zhantang crazy. He roared furiously, “Six Daos circulate, Ghost Dao possession! Undying! Indestructible!”

Black qi exploded out of Bai Zhantang. That was ghost qi. Now, blood-colored light flowed within his eyes. It was as if he had transformed into a wild devil. His Blood Qi also erupted, and wild qi waves battered the surroundings. As a result, the Heavenly Daos crumbled before him.

Bai Zhantang’s aura instantly doubled in power. Long Chen also saw countless tentacles appear in the manifestation behind him. When they extended into heaven and earth, Long Chen sensed a familiar aura.

That aura was something he had sensed from Wu Tian. It was an undying, indestructible aura. However, there was a qualitative difference between the two of their auras.

Long Chen instantly understood that Wu Tian’s undying, indestructible aura was constant, while Bai Zhantang had only entered a special but temporary state.

“Die!”

Bai Zhantang slashed his broadsword out and countless devils exploded. Even half-step World Kings were as weak as ants before his current self.

BOOM!

When Bai Zhantang and Jia Luo clashed, ripples exploded and astral winds blasted the world, tearing cracks into heaven and earth.

Jia Luo was sent reeling back. It took him over ten steps to stabilize. In terms of power, he wasn’t a match for Bai Zhantang.

Suddenly, a trident silently appeared behind Bai Zhantang and stabbed through his body. Everyone cried out in shock.

Without even looking back, Bai Zhantang swung his broadsword behind him. His sneak attacker was a devil who was blown apart.

“Don’t attack him! He is in an undying, indestructible state. No one can cause him substantial wounds. Go break the formation!” shouted Jia Luo.

As old opponents, Bai Zhantang was familiar with Jia Luo’s abilities, and Jia Luo was also familiar with Bai Zhantang’s abilities.

Just as Jia Luo said this, Bai Zhantang unleashed another slash of his broadsword, sending Jia Luo even further back.

“Hmph, once your Ghost Dao Possession ends, I will cut off your head.” Jia Luo sneered and retreated. He knew that the current Bai Zhantang could not be defeated. Fighting with him directly was meaningless.

“You shameless fellow, fight me fair and square!” roared Bai Zhantang.

“A wise man would rather win with wits instead of power. Only a foolish man relies on brute power. I went through such pain to cross heavens. Do you think it was just to take your life? You view yourself too highly. I came to destroy your seventh branch academy. Taking your dog life is something I’ll do in passing,” sneered Jia Luo.

“Fuck you!”

Bai Zhantang roared and continued attacking Jia Luo. But Jia Luo repeatedly dodged, refusing to fight him head-on. His goal was only to keep Bai Zhantang tied down and wait for his Ghost Dao Possession to end.

At this time, countless devil experts and fiend devils were charging at the High Firmament Academy. Although the Battle God Palace’s experts were fighting them at full power and Bai Shishi was slaughtering them with her golden sword, there were too many enemies. Furthermore, they were coming from all directions. There was no stopping them.

Bai Zhantang felt like he might just explode from rage. His goal was to quickly kill Jia Luo and then protect the academy, but Jia Luo was too crafty. He refused to fight Bai Zhantang directly and only stalled him.

However, he didn’t dare to let Jia Luo off either because Jia Luo would attack the others. Hence, Bai Zhantang was caught in a stalemate and could only roar in fury.

Suddenly, a heaven-shaking roar rang out and a giant figure appeared. This three-hundred-meter giant made Qin Feng and Qi Yu jump. They almost mistook Xu Zixiong for Wilde.

Xu Zixiong had summoned the Barbarian Blood Battle Body, transforming into a giant. His rod swung out repeatedly. At this moment, his power had instantly surpassed even Qin Feng and Qi Yu’s.

Endless devils poured out. Amongst the junior generation, only Bai Shishi, Bai Xiaole, Qin Feng, Qi Yu, and Xu Zixiong had charged into the battlefield.

The other disciples had been terrified at the start but quickly summoned their courage to also go out. However, they were shouted at to stop.

Against ordinary Immortal Kings, they would have no problem. But right now, even the weakest enemies were half-step World Kings, and there were also World Kings amongst them. If these disciples went out, they would only be sending themselves to their graves.

“Xiaole, chant with me! Heavenly Eye descends, shaking the stars, piercing the void, seeing the true form of gods…” Bai Xiaole’s mother sternly caught Bai Xiaole. The two of them sat on top of the barrier, chanting some scripture.𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

Bai Xiaole originally wanted to go out and fight, but seeing how stern his mother’s expression was, he didn’t dare to disobey. He formed hand seals and chanted with his mother.

As they chanted, their Three Flower Pupils appeared. Following that, a pair of giant eyes appeared in their manifestations. It was like the eyes of gods, overlooking the world.

A pillar of light then connected the four divine eyes and spread, forming a ripple covering the entire academy.

Those enemies struck by the ripple were instantly sent flying. It was as if some invisible energy had rejected them, yet also as if they had simply been transported away. They were unable to get through.

At this moment, the academy’s Elders were going all-out embedding new immortal king crystals into the grand formations. They hoped to repair the grand formations as fast as possible.

Right now, both sides were in a race for time. Their enemies were trying to break through before the formations repaired themselves, while Long Chen and the others were doing their best to stall for time for the barrier to repair.

As for the disciples, they could only watch anxiously. They clenched their hands tightly, but the Elders refused to let them go. They could only watch.

They felt hatred. They hated themselves for not being strong enough, unable to fight alongside Long Chen. At the most critical time, they were unable to help at all. That felt even worse than dying to them.

People looked at where Long Chen was and saw endless Devil Eye Water Lilies. They were gigantic and gradually covered him up. Now, everyone’s heart clenched. The Devil Eye Water Lily race seemed to have come in even greater numbers than the devils.

Although the Devil Eye Water Lily race’s experts didn’t have the title of the Undying in their names, they were still lifeforms of the Undying World. Hence, they possessed immense life energy and endless divine abilities. But Long Chen was stopping all of them on his own. He was under the most pressure. Luo Changwu stared at him closely, praying inside for him to be fine.

“Split the Heavens!”

Suddenly, a furious roar rang out and a heavenly saber slashed down like a river of stars.
