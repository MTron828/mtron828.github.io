Chapter 4497 Eighth Star Nirvanic Charge

“The eighth star, the Nirvanic Charge Star’s pill formula!”

Long Chen was so overjoyed that he almost shouted. Just now, in the battle against the five Saints, he had awoken the eighth star’s pill formula.

“You’re finally here!”

Long Chen almost wept with joy. He had doubted himself many times, thinking that he had gone so far off the original path that there was no chance of him awakening it.

If he were to lose the support of the Nine Star Hegemon Body Art, he had no idea just how he would navigate his future path. Now, the pill formula had finally awoken within his mind, and the name of the star had also appeared, which meant that his path remained on course.

“It seems the eighth star never manifested in my mind not because my realm wasn’t high enough, but because the seventh star never reached full saturation. After absorbing the energy of the nether dragon race leader, the Seven Star Battle Armor finally reached its peak state, and then I immediately awakened this pill formula.”

Long Chen came to a sudden understanding. So, all this time, the seventh star had never reached the complete requirements of the Nine Star Hegemon Body Art. That explained why he had been stuck for so long.

“Heaven Earth Five Element Orchid, Thousand Mark Yin Yang Grass, Universe Blood Spirit Mushroom, Star Dew…” When Long Chen checked the actual pill formula, his fiery joy was doused by a bucket of ice water.

There were over three thousand medicinal ingredients, and Long Chen had less than a tenth of them. Moreover, many of them were legendary divine medicines capable of bringing a person back from the brink of death—on par with the Sacred Light Pistil in value.DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

Many of them had long since gone extinct. Long Chen had seen many of them in ancient tomes but none in real life. Worst of all, a tenth of the ingredients were entirely foreign to Long Chen, and despite his extensive knowledge, he had neither heard of nor seen them.

All this time, Long Chen had been gathering every medicinal ingredient available to him, as he maintained an ongoing collaboration with the Huayun Trading Company.

As a result, Long Chen’s medicinal field was brimming with an abundance of medicinal ingredients, sufficient to refine over eighty percent of the world’s ordinary medicinal pills.

However, the Nirvanic Charge Star’s pill formula instantly dealt him a serious blow. It became apparent that his current assortment of ingredients, while suitable for ordinary medicinal pills, fell far short of the complex requirements of the Nirvanic Charge Pill.

Given his wealth, he had thought that he would only be missing a few or even have them all if he was lucky. However, reality didn’t give him any face.

“Don’t panic. Many of those ingredients are not found in your world. When the new world opens, you’ll have the ability to gather them. To gain without joy, to lose without sorrow, your heart must always remain calm,” said the Earth Cauldron.

“To gain without joy, to lose without sorrow?”

Long Chen bitterly smiled. He was not even close to reaching that realm. It was like telling someone starving that lunch had been changed to dinner, and they’d have to wait until then.

Although Long Chen was disappointed, he had experienced such a thing plenty of times, so he was used to it. After a moment of disappointment, his mental state also stabilized.

In any case, he finally had the pill formula, so he could just slowly gather the medicinal ingredients. In any case, the Seven Star Battle Armor had reached its strongest state, and Long Chen was eager to explore the newfound strength, unsure of just how many times more powerful it had become compared to before.

At the same time, his dragon blood, violet blood, and seven-color Supreme Blood had also been upgraded. He had truly profited from disaster, so he learned how to be satisfied with what he had.

“Long Chen!”

When Long Chen returned to the academy, Bai Shishi and Yu Qingxuan sighed with relief. The Dragonblood Legion also started gathering.

“Boss, weren’t you captured by the nether dragon race?” asked Guo Ran and the others.

When the nether dragon race captured Long Chen, they quickly disseminated news of their success. However, the information took time to spread.

The first to receive this information were those five Saints, and it took a while for the information to reach the High Firmament Academy’s side. When the Dragonblood Legion heard that their boss had been captured, they immediately prepared for a frontal assault. However, Long Chen was already back before they were done.

Seeing them like this, Long Chen was moved. His lifelong brothers were the most loyal people in the universe.

“There was nothing of the sort. I intentionally let myself be captured to get myself into their headquarters, and then I blew it up,” laughed Long Chen. By not normally bragging, once he did, others would naturally believe him.

Long Chen didn’t want to explain too much to prevent Yu Qingxuan and Bai Shishi from worrying, and a touch of bravado seemed sufficient to close the matter.

“Haha, I knew that my boss was unrivaled! How could he be captured?” Guo Ran laughed delightedly as he trusted Long Chen blindly.

“Boss, weren’t you going after that Lifehunter expert? How did you end up encountering the nether dragon race leader?” asked Xia Chen.

“He was unlucky!” Long Chen naturally didn’t admit that he had been the unlucky one. In any case, he had bragged, so he had to keep it up to the end.

At this moment, Long Chen saw Luo Ning in the crowd. Although she was still pale and weak, she had recovered enough that her life was no longer in danger. Alongside her were Luo Bing and Mu Qingyun, standing with the Dragonblood Legion.

Despite her frailty, hearing that Long Chen had been captured, Luo Ning had vehemently opposed the objections of Guo Ran and others, insisting on coming with them to rescue him.

Luo Ning’s mouth twitched a few times upon seeing Long Chen look at her. However, even after she opened her mouth, she couldn’t say anything.

Long Chen smiled. “I already killed that fellow!”

“Really?” Luo Ning was delighted. The others were also startled as that Lifehunter expert was a monster.

When Long Chen had gone after him, everyone had been worried for him, praying for his safe return. Thus, they were amazed to hear that he had actually killed that terrifying fellow.

“In truth, the Lifehunter race isn’t so amazing. We just don’t know enough about their techniques. Once we understand them, they no longer seem so invulnerable,” said Long Chen.

Actually, Long Chen only said this to reduce their fear of the Lifehunter race. The Lifehunter race truly was powerful. In the future, Long Chen and his companions would have to be careful against them.

The regretful thing was that after the Lifehunter expert used the Verdict of the Heavenly Daos, his corpse simply vanished. So, there was nothing for Guo Ran and Xia Chen to study. Even if they couldn’t find any weaknesses from it, studying the body’s essence blood and core runes might provide them with some insights.

Long Chen had everyone scatter and rest, but he asked Luo Bing and Luo Ning to stay behind. He then discreetly gave a Heavenly Doyen Fruit to each of them.

These were new fruits he had obtained from destroying the nether dragon race’s strongholds. Following that, he distributed the leftovers to the Dragonblood warriors.

As for the final five star Heavenly Doyen Fruit, Long Chen hesitated over it for a long time, but ultimately gave it to Xia Chen.

When Xia Chen obtained this Heavenly Doyen Fruit, he immediately went into seclusion, and Long Chen followed suit. This time, he wanted to actually reach the twelfth Heavenstage of the World King realm.
