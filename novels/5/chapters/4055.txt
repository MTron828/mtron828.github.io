Chapter 4044 The Hell Gate Opens

Enpuda laughed. Even now that his neck was severed, his faith energy was still delaying the decay caused by the black dagger’s power. But at this moment, the flesh of his lower jaw was rotting and breaking apart as he laughed, displaying a horrifying sight.

“Although I, Enpuda, am contemptible and willing to use any means necessary, a loss is a loss. I don’t need anyone’s pity. I am called the Despicable Killing God for a reason. Do you think that I’d care about dying with dignity?”

At this time, he was still able to laugh. Even Long Chen had to admire that about him. Although he was contemptible, he was still admirable in some areas. After all, not everyone could face death like this.

After laughing, Enpuda said, “Long Chen, this time it is my defeat. I underestimated your rate of growth and overestimated my control. However, just because I lost doesn’t mean that you’ve won. I will die, but you will also follow me soon. The hell gate will soon open. When that happens, the emissary of the Nether Emperor will descend and bring his woman back to the depths of hell. I know how much you care about your loved ones. That is your greatest weakness, your fatal weakness. It already showed itself when you fought the Yan Xu Gate. You won’t just watch as Yu Qingxuan dies, so you will accompany her in death. After all, no one can resist the Nether Emperor’s power. I’m a dead man, and so are you. I suppose that this can be considered my final act for Lord Brahma. I can die in peace.”

Only when Enpuda said this did everyone realize that the crisis wasn’t over. They raised their heads and were shocked to see a crack in the hell gate. Death qi was pouring out of it.

“Master, you can definitely stop it, right!?” Dong Mingyu’s expression changed. She turned to her master with a pleading expression.

However, Ye Wusheng didn’t reply. Instead, it was Enpuda who answered her.

“As an assassin, no matter how powerful you are, any emotions will make you easy to scheme against and kill. To tell the truth, I don’t like that I’ve lost to someone like you. The Nether Emperor’s emissary will possess the laws of hell, and they are immune to all attacks from this world. So, even your master is powerless. Perhaps Long Chen’s lotus seed would have had the ability to resist the laws of hell, but it is already out of energy after fighting the power of Yan Xu. Other than that, little Dong Mingyu, you should worry about yourself instead of Long Chen. That dagger you used to kill me has a terrifying background. When it was in Long Chen’s hands, I already suspected its origins. When it cut through my neck, it instantly exhausted ninety percent of my faith energy. So, I am now sure of its origin. It already has a master. For the dagger to suddenly absorb so much faith energy, that master has definitely sensed it. When its master descends, they won’t just take the dagger but also your life. You also won’t be surviving.”

Hearing this, Dong Mingyu didn’t get angry, nor did she show fear. She simply smiled.

“Did you think that if big brother Long Chen died, I would continue living?”

Clearly, if Yu Qingxuan died, Long Chen wouldn’t live either. And if Long Chen died, Dong Mingyu would follow.

For a moment, everyone was stunned. They looked from Long Chen to Dong Mingyu. Both of them were peerless heavenly geniuses with limitless potential, the human race’s hope. Were they all going to fall here?Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

“There’s no need for you to worry about these things. Since you feel indifferent to death, I won’t stand on courtesy.”

Long Chen suddenly appeared in front of Enpuda and pointed his finger.

Buzz.

Enpuda’s soul was ripped out of his head.

“You wish to examine my soul? Sorry, but you aren’t capable of it.”

BOOM!

Enpuda’s soul exploded. Even so, Long Chen was prepared, and black flames enveloped those shattered soul fragments.

BOOM!

Enpuda’s spiritual fragments continuously exploded, detonating nine more times before stopping. Those spiritual fragments were smithereens now and were essentially useless.

However, Long Chen’s expression didn’t change. It seemed that this was well within his expectations. He then summoned Huo Long, and she devoured those spiritual fragments.

As Enpuda’s head vanished, his headless corpse was also rotting away. It seemed that it wouldn’t be long before his entire corpse was gone.

For an expert on Enpuda’s level, his body was nourished by faith energy, so it had almost reached the point of being unbreakable, immortal.

However, in front of that black dagger, his physical body was still not strong enough. When Long Chen was stabbed by that dagger long ago, it clearly hadn’t had that much power, or he would have long since died.

It was unknown if the dagger had grown during this time, or if something in it had changed after killing some experts. In any case, this black dagger was growing increasingly powerful, like a bloodthirsty devil that had been sealed for countless years and was awakened by the taste of blood.

Long Chen had no time to study the dagger. After Huo Linger devoured Enpuda’s spiritual fragments, she brought them into the primal chaos space.

Long Chen’s Spiritual Strength then flowed into the primal chaos space. There, Enpuda’s spiritual fragments began to slowly merge back together, growing bigger and bigger.

Inside the primal chaos space, Long Chen reigned as its master, with all the laws under his command. No matter how severely Enpuda tore up his soul, Long Chen possessed the power to mend it back together effortlessly.

Originally, when Long Chen offered to give Enpuda a dignified death, it came with a condition. That was to tell him the secrets relating to the Nether Emperor.

However, since Enpuda refused, Long Chen didn’t stand on courtesy. After becoming an Immortal King, the primal chaos space had gone through a mysterious change. Long Chen wasn’t sure what it was, but with this first test, he really succeeded.

Long Chen’s entire focus was on rebuilding the spiritual fragments. After all, he wanted to know the secrets of the Nether Emperor.

After a while, Long Chen finally grasped the right fragment. Feeling delighted, he started studying it. But just as he grasped the slightest information, a terrifying dangerous aura caused him to quiver. After that, he heard a howl.

The moment Long Chen’s mind left the primal chaos space, an ear-piercing laugh pierced his ear like a needle, causing him to feel like his soul was being cut into millions of pieces. Countless people also covered their ears and screamed.

The barrier covering the capital could block the Yan Xu Flames, but it was unable to block out that sound. It actually shattered.

Just then, the hell gate slowly opened, and black qi gushed out, along with one figure after another. When people saw those figures, their bodies turned ice-cold, and they were filled with terror.
