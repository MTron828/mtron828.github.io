Chapter 3849 Long Chen’s Fury

The three of them jumped in horror. Long Aotian was actually flying at them, had they been noticed? However, they quickly realized that he was flying backward.

BOOM!

Long Aotian smashed into a coffin, and the coffin quivered. The chain connecting the coffin to the bronze cauldron was pulled taut.

The immense force actually caused the bronze cauldron, which had been impossible to budge in the slightest this entire time, to finally quiver ever so slightly.

Then looking at Long Chen, they saw him surrounded by violet qi. The sea of stars behind him continued to revolve. He was like a battle god of the starry sky.

“Boss is mighty!”

Seeing this scene, Xia Chen and Guo Ran felt their blood heating up. Long Aotian was already so powerful, but he was still beaten by Long Chen.

Through this fight, Long Chen had fully mastered the power of the seven stars. His power concentrated where he wanted it to with just a thought. There was no longer the slightest stiffness to it. It could be said that the current Long Chen had finally touched the entrance door of the Nine Star Hegemon Body Art.

A seven star diagram could be seen on the back of Long Chen’s right and left hands, and violet stars flickered on top of his clothes. It was like a heartbeat as it possessed some profound rhythm.

Following this rhythm, the laws of the Heavenly Daos flowed like the tide. The Heavenly Boundary Line was constantly quivering due to Long Chen’s power.

At this moment, violet qi flowed within endless stars, and the entire heavenly tomb was now a starry sky world. The vast stars emitted endless power, and people couldn’t help being amazed.nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

Now, Long Chen’s aura was completely different from before. It was even more domineering and colder, overflowing with killing intent. Just a look at the current Long Chen made people’s hearts shake.

However, what was also shocking was that even after smashing into the coffin that hard, to the point that the coffin shook and the chain was stretched taut, Long Aotian got back up as if he was completely fine.

“His manifestation…!”

Yue Xiaoqian was shocked to find that the world within Long Aotian’s manifestation was no longer filled with color. It had become a world of only black and white.

The black world had a crescent moon shining high above it, while the white world had a bright sun filling it. White and black were both filled with their own individual flavors.

While five-colored divine light shone out of Long Aotian’s body, the black and white world behind him reflected each other. It looked extremely bizarre. And yet, when these seven colors were released, they released a grand and dignified aura.

The experts in the distance were all stunned by the two of them. They were monsters. From the start to now, their auras only continued to climb. They had never stopped, so they were only growing stronger.

Yin Changsheng, the Nine Underworld Luocha, Shi Yang, and even the always-calm Ji Wuming were all clenching their weapons tightly.

An expert thirsted to find a powerful opponent. For them, a terrifying opponent was even more beneficial than ten masters.

True experts all viewed battle as the real master. Battle was what tempered their will through the line between life and death. Battle was what raised their power, what gave them enlightenment of laws and Daos.

The terrifying power that Long Chen and Long Aotian had displayed shook everyone’s heart. They were all the peak experts of their respective factions. In all their life, they had never met an expert who could push them to the brink of death.

Hence, Long Chen and Long Aotian’s terrifying power didn’t spark fear in them. It only made their blood heat up. To any expert, a life-and-death battle had a powerful attraction.

If they won, they would break out of their cocoon and be completely transformed. If they lost, their body would be destroyed and their soul extinguished. Thus, cultivation was a path of no return. If you wanted to get stronger, you needed to constantly challenge your limit. Despite clearly knowing that you might lose your life, you still had to face it enthusiastically.

At this point, they no longer cared about the coffins and didn’t even look at the cauldron. They were currently hesitating about whether or not they should join this immense battle and have a real clash of experts.

“Interesting. It seems that you also have a lucky opportunity in the immortal world. However, just relying on your Starry Star cultivation technique, you cannot beat me!” Long Aotian wiped the dust off of his body calmly. That calm contained a certain disdain.

“Starry Star cultivation technique?”

Long Chen’s expression twitched. At this moment, the dragon expert’s voice rang out in his mind. “When you sent him away, I erased all the memories relating to the nine stars from his soul. Looking at your Seven Star Battle Armor, he cannot recall your Six Star Battle Armor from the Martial Heaven Continent. He thinks that your cultivation technique was learned in the immortal world.”

Only then did Long Chen recall it. The dragon expert had helped him do many things in secret. It was just that he wasn’t aware of them.

“It doesn’t matter how powerful you are! In front of me, you will still be defeated. Furthermore, you will have no choice but to accept your complete and utter defeat. But it must feel bad because everything I have originally belonged to you, hahaha!” Long Aotian laughed. It seemed that the stronger Long Chen was, the more excited he grew. He didn’t show the slightest fear.

“Your laugh is as loathsome as ever. I just don’t know how long you can keep laughing.”

Long Chen stepped forward, instantly crossing a giant space of hundreds of miles to strike Long Aotian with his fist.

“It’s useless. All your attacks have no effect. You can never harm me!” Long Aotian laughed. What shocked people was that he directly stuck out his chest to receive Long Chen’s attack.

BOOM!

Long Chen’s fist caused Long Aotian’s chest to cave in. Long Aotian then shot back like a shooting star, smashing into a distant wall, leaving a giant hole. Debris and dust fell.

However, Long Aotian calmly walked out of that rain of rubble. After lightly wiping some dust off of his body, he sneered. “It’s useless. Your attacks cannot injure me.”

At this moment, everyone was stunned. Just what was going on? Even such terrifying attacks were unable to harm Long Aotian.

Even Yin Changsheng and the others couldn’t believe their eyes. This strange phenomenon exceeded their understanding.

“Long Chen, don’t waste time with him. Theoretically, I shouldn’t say this, but the current you is not a match for him,” said the dragon expert heavily.

“I don’t believe that!”

Long Chen’s heart shook intensely. The dragon expert was actually saying that he was inferior to Long Aotian?

Long Chen was extremely reverent and grateful to the dragon expert. He also had the utmost confidence in it. However, for it to say that Long Aotian was superior to him, he refused to accept it.

“Do you know just how powerful your seven-color Supreme Blood is? Before you obtain my dragon king essence blood, you cannot defeat him,” said the dragon expert calmly. “Therefore, you shouldn’t waste time on him. It would be better to take that cauldron. You must preserve enough energy to leave your mark on that cauldron to awaken its slumbering self.”

“Senior, I’m sorry, but I cannot listen to you this time. I must defeat him.” Long Chen shook his head.

The dragon expert’s words had provoked Long Chen’s battle intent. He then shot after Long Aotian. His gaze was as sharp as a blade, and his battle intent was fully ignited.
