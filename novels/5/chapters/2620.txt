Chapter 2609 The Eighth Heavenly Dragon Legion’s Trouble

Long Chen followed Elder Long to the Long family’s territory. When they arrived, the family head was already waiting for them with the various Elders in charge. After sending Long Chen here, Elder Long retreated. It seemed that he wasn’t qualified to attend such a meeting.

Over three hundred Elders of the Long family had gathered here, and they were all Heaven Merging experts. However, when they looked at Long Chen, they didn’t show any hostility. Instead, they seemed to view him in high regard.

The family head laughed boisterously. “Today’s gathering was quite lively. As expected, heroes come from the youths.”

The Long family’s people all had smiles on their faces. The Long family had been fighting against the Ye family for a long time. Now that the Ye family had joined forces with the Zhao family, it could be said that Long Chen had managed to land a fierce blow for the Long family.

“Family head is overpraising me.” Long Chen cupped his fists, not quite knowing what the Long family had called him here for.

They had just finished their discussion with the four divine families, so why would they call him here now? Did the Long family not care about arousing suspicion?

“Come, let’s sit and talk.” The Long family head suddenly waved his hand. The various Elders retreated, leaving behind only just over ten core Elders such as the Deputy Elder, as well as Long Aotian.

After that, a golden praying mat appeared beneath everyone. Long Chen was about to sit when Evilmoon suddenly sent him a message.

“Hold it!”

Long Chen was already squatting when he came to a sudden stop. The Long family head stared at him in confusion.

Long Chen smiled. “As a junior, I have to invite seniors to sit first.”

The Long family head laughed. “By inviting you here, it means that we view you as family. There is no need for such formalities.”

However, Long Chen still waited for everyone else to sit before he himself sat. When he sat, he clearly sensed the atmosphere grow a bit odd.

Long Chen said, “Senior, may I ask what instructions you have for this junior?”

“There’s not much to say. You are one of the Martial Heaven Continent’s young heroes. As for Long Aotian, he is the strongest expert of the Long family’s junior generation. There have been some misunderstandings between the two of you before, so I’m hoping to use this chance to smooth things out between the two of you,” said the Deputy Elder.

“Please give me pointers.” Long Aotian extended a hand.

Long Chen looked at Long Aotian’s hand and shook his head. “Between experts, there is no need for such formalities. I have a certain eccentricity that I don’t like holding hands with anyone other than beautiful women.”

Long Aotian’s expression sank. His gaze became as sharp as a blade.

The Deputy Elder hastily stood and laughed. “Youngsters all have such characters. Time will slowly wear such a thing down. Well then, Long Chen, the Martial Heaven Continent still has many things for you to do. I’ll send you off.”

“Goodbye.” Long Chen stood. He cupped his fists to the family head and left.

After he was gone, Long Aotian’s killing intent became apparent. “I will definitely kill him.”

“Aotian, it’s not wise for you to expose your power right now. You have to endure,” said the family head.

“Hmph, do your best not to let me come into contact with him again, or I really won’t be able to hold myself back.” Long Aotian snorted and left. It seemed that in his eyes, even the family head wasn’t someone he had to be particularly respectful toward.

Hearing this, the various Elders could only look at each other. No one was saying anything.

The family head finally broke the silence. “Long Chen only has so much potential, and he is too wild to be used by the Long family. In the future, don’t bother wasting the effort to drag him over. We also don’t want Aotian to be uncomfortable. It’s not worth it.”

“Yes.” The Deputy Elder nodded. They had originally wanted to pull Long Chen over to the side of the Long family, but as Long Chen gained more backers, his arrogance also grew. After that, more space was created between him and the Long family. Then adding in that Long Aotian hated him, they could only set aside that thought.

“Arrange for Long Chen to enter the Ancient Battlefield. Try to use that method to tie him down,” said the family head.

“Understood. I’ll arrange it right now.” The Deputy Elder nodded and left. The various Elders also began to take their leave.

In the end, only the family head remained. At that moment, space twisted and two figures appeared.

“Lord Venerate, Heaven Executioner.” The family head bowed slightly.

The divine families’ Lord Venerate and Heaven Executioner had come. After that, the Heaven Executioner picked up the prayer mat that Long Chen had sat on.

“There’s no reaction. It seems that I was overthinking things. He’s not that vile spawn.” The Heaven Executioner shook his head.

“However, Long Chen really does look like him. It makes me uneasy. Countless people died in that battle. We still don’t even have a tenth of our original Heaven Merging experts. If it weren’t for that battle, the divine families would have long since taken control over this world. The Martial Heaven Continent would have no choice but to listen to our orders,” said the family head hatefully.

“Saying those things now is meaningless. As long as we’ve proven that Long Chen isn’t his descendant, everything is fine,” said the Lord Venerate.

“It can be confirmed. The prayer mat has the Long family’s ancestral rune on it. The Spirit Blood, Spirit Root, and Spirit Bone can be concealed, but the soul can’t be changed. He truly doesn’t belong to the Long family,” said the Heaven Executioner.

The Lord Venerate nodded. “Good. the divine families no longer have their old power, so we’ll have to borrow the power of the Martial Heaven Continent. Do your best not to provoke Long Chen to prevent any further side issues from arising.”

“The only concerning ones are Ye Liangchen, Jiang Wuchen, Feng Fei, and the others…” said the family head.

“I’ll warn them. The Martial Heaven Continent’s current situation isn’t optimistic. There can be no mistakes. The pressure on the divine families is also unprecedented,” said the Lord Venerate, sighing.

…

Long Chen was sent off, and the one leading the path was once more Elder Long. This time, no one else accompanied them, so it was just the two of them.

“Elder Long, is the Heaven Executioner very powerful?” asked Long Chen casually.

“Very powerful. He’s an expert on the same level as the Lord Venerate. But…” Elder Long suddenly shut his mouth.

“But what?”

Elder Long hesitated. “But after being stabbed through the chest by a sword, a fist-sized hole remained all the way to this day. He has no way to heal it. Due to this wound, his power is suppressed, and his cultivation base is starting to regress. That might be why his character is a bit…”

“An expert on the same level as Lord Venerate was given a wound that has yet to heal? Then who was the one who gave him that wound? An expert from one of the other worlds?” asked Long Chen.

“No. It was someone from the Long family.”

Long Chen’s heart pounded. He wanted to keep asking questions when Elder Long raised his hand. “It’s not convenient to speak in this region.”

Long Chen was startled. It seemed that Elder Long knew a great deal despite not being a Heaven Merging Elder.

Furthermore, Elder Long seemed to be hinting at something to Long Chen. Did he know something? Long Chen suddenly felt him to be quite mysterious.

“Can I trust you?” probed Long Chen suddenly.

“Perhaps.” Elder Long nodded.

The two of them arrived at a transportation formation. However, at that moment, a bloody warrior came out of it. When Long Chen saw that person, he was startled to find that he looked a bit familiar. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

“Long Chen… you’re here?” That person instantly recognized Long Chen. He was one of the vice commanders of the eighth Heavenly Dragon Legion.

“What happened?” asked Elder Long.

“We don’t know what’s going on. Our camp was suddenly attacked by many demonic beasts, and they surrounded us. We had sent out a distress signal, but no one from the surroundings came to help us. We suspect that they have also been attacked. Because of it, we had no other choice but to send someone back here to request reinforcements. Elder Long, you have to send someone!” said the vice commander urgently.

“Alright, I’ll send some people right now.” Elder Long took out his jade plate and immediately got to work.

“Let’s go. I’ll take a look.” Long Chen naturally wouldn’t just sit there with the eighth Heavenly Dragon Legion in trouble. For the divine families’ reinforcements to arrive would definitely take some time.

Long Chen and the vice commander then left together. Meanwhile, Elder Long looked at the jade plate in his hand. He couldn’t help sighing and shaking his head.

After two transportations, Long Chen and the vice commander arrived at the battlefield. This was his second time here, and the smell of blood struck him.

“Senior apprentice-brother Long Chen, during this time, more and more demonic beasts have been appearing. Defending against them has also grown more difficult.” Long Chen summoned lightning wings, carrying the vice commander as he sped off.

Ever since they had returned from the Star Field Divine World, the demonic beasts of the Ancient Battlefield had grown even more violent. Their numbers also multiplied. Because of this problem and the fact that the defensive line within the Ancient Battlefield was too long, the divine families were forced to shrink their defensive zone, but it still wasn’t enough to resolve this problem.

Recently, a large number of warriors had been called back to the divine families. It was unknown if it was to intimidate Long Chen, but the demonic beasts had noticed and taken advantage of it to launch an attack. Hence, the eighth legion was now surrounded.

As for the closest forces to them, they had also unleashed distress signals. However, no reinforcements could be seen. It seemed that the other areas had also been attacked.

When the two of them arrived at the eighth legion’s camp, Long Chen saw an endless sea of demonic beasts.

“It’s doomed. The final defensive line has also been breached. I don’t know if our brothers can endure.” The vice commander instantly turned pale when he saw the current state.

When he had left for reinforcements, the eighth legion had still been holding on. By relying on their defensive structures and tools, they had been barely able to keep the demonic beasts back. But now, their defensive line was broken.

“Activate your defenses!” shouted Long Chen.

The vice commander was confused, but then thunder boomed, and Long Chen’s speed instantly shot up. As a result, the vice commander felt like his body was going to be torn apart, and he hastily summoned his defenses.

Long Chen quickly spotted a mountain where the eighth legion’s warriors were trapped by demonic beasts.

BOOM!

Long Chen smashed into them like a shooting star. Following that, a cold shout rang out.

“Raging Flames Devour the Heavens!”

Berserk flames instantly exploded out of him, spreading in a wave that devoured this battlefield.
