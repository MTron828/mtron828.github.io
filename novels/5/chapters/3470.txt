Chapter 3459 Major Bad Turn of Events

“Long Chen, what are you waiting for?” asked Bai Shishi’s mother.

This was something that Bai Zhantang had wanted to ask for a long time, but he was unable to lower himself to do so. He had already received orders to listen to Long Chen, and he could not argue.

Hence, they had passed through these days like fools. Bai Zhantang was already getting a bit irritated at just sitting around, but he also wasn’t allowed to leave. He could only watch as his precious daughter made eyes at Long Chen, making him feel extremely out of sorts.

Bai Shishi’s mother knew what he was thinking, so she came to ask Long Chen this question for her husband.

Long Chen nodded. “Someone is watching us. Like leopards in the shadows, they are preparing to unleash a mortal blow.”

“Can you see them?” Bai Shishi’s mother was surprised. Long Chen was looking in a certain direction.

It had to be known that the High Firmament Academy’s formation was capable of overlooking the majority of the Vile Dragon Domain. If anyone was spying on them, they should have long since noticed them.

“I can’t see them, but I can smell their scent. They really do view me as a child. How could I fall for the same ploy twice?” sneered Long Chen.Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

He didn’t say much. He was very familiar with Enpuda’s aura, so he could feel that this damn fatty was keeping an eye on him.

Enpuda was waiting for Long Chen to reveal an opening. At first, Long Chen only had a vague feeling, but the moment Bai Shishi charged out, that feeling became clear.

In other words, when Bai Shishi charged out, the other side prepared to make their move. Furthermore, the place that Bai Shishi had charged to was on the edge of the formation’s attack range. Once she passed that area, the formation’s attack power would drop.

Thus, it was very simple for Long Chen to deduce the other side’s intentions and range. After all, Long Chen was willing to just continue grinding away like this. Just who would lose their patience first?

Furthermore, Long Chen didn’t just sense Enpuda’s aura. He also sensed another terrifying existence. After advancing to the Divine Lord realm, his senses were even sharper. He wasn’t afraid at all.

The other side was using the devil world and the devil sea’s lifeforms as bait. However, Bai Shishi and the others were consuming the bait without getting hooked. All that was left was to see just how much bait the other side was willing to toss out.

This response from Long Chen startled Bai Shishi’s mother and the others. Long Chen had almost lost his life due to Enpuda’s scheming. Now that he raised that topic, it was clear who was on the other side.

Enpuda had personally come? Even Bai Zhantang couldn’t believe that. Enpuda wasn’t in this heaven. If he were to come across heavens, he would have to pay a huge price. That didn’t seem too likely.

However, Long Chen wouldn’t make this up. Everyone looked at each other in shock and confusion. They couldn’t help tensing up.

They didn’t pursue this topic any further. Bai Letian had already told them to listen to Long Chen. It would only cause irritation if they needlessly asked questions, and there would even be a slight flavor of wanting to take over.

In one day, Long Chen gained a large pile of devil crystals and devil cores. The others were fighting the entire time, training themselves. As a result, their realms gradually stabilized, and they came to control their new power.

The second day also ended with huge gains. Other than Bai Shishi, everyone was taking turns to rest. Of the over ten thousand disciples, the majority had fully stabilized their realms.

After five days, every disciple had finished stabilizing their realms. Now their attacks grew even sharper. At the same time, they began to consume Divine Lord Pills, using this battle to cultivate.

Even after ten days, nothing changed with the other side, so Long Chen also didn’t make any changes. He just refined pills in his room occasionally while he kept an eye on the battle.

Long Chen was delighted that during this time, Lei Linger had managed to fully absorb the energy from both tribulations. She was now entirely focused on nourishing the Violet Tower Pills.

The Violet Tower Pills were actually too strong and possessed their own wills. Nourishing them required patience and steadiness. One careless slip and they would detonate.

Furthermore, during this time, Huo Linger and the Moon and Star Refining Furnace started trying to refine the pills themselves. The only issue was that Huo Linger didn’t have Long Chen’s powerful Spiritual Strength, so Long Chen needed to split a portion of his Spiritual Strength to help.

Despite that, Long Chen saved himself quite a bit of effort by not having to personally refine anything.

In order to make sure that every Violet Tower Pill’s effect was maximized, Long Chen patiently waited for Lei Linger to expel all the impurities with thunderforce. The stronger the pill, the more difficult it was to nourish them. But Long Chen was capable of waiting.

Another ten days passed. The number of attackers had not diminished in the slightest. It seemed that the other side was really planning on dragging out this battle.

“Fuck, what medicine are they taking?!” After waiting so long, there was still no reply from the other side. Bai Zhantang was getting vexed.

Long Chen also felt that something was wrong. The other side was truly being patient, more than he had expected. It didn’t make sense for them to simply be sending Long Chen money.

However, the formation was still keeping an eye on everything. There was nothing odd. But the more he couldn’t see anything odd, the more he felt that something was wrong.

“Is everything still fine at the main academy?” asked Long Chen.

“Everything is normal,” answered Heaven Master Yun Yang.

Long Chen sank into thought. Suddenly, his heart thudded and his expression changed so drastically that everyone jumped.

“What is it?!” asked Bai Shishi’s mother.

“I think I know their goal. Deputy Dean Yun Yang, I have a mission for you. Stealthily activate all the grand formations,” said Long Chen.

“All of them?”

Heaven Master Yun Yang jumped. If the grand formations were fully activated, it would burn a hundred times more immortal king crystals than usual. One day would cost hundreds of thousands of immortal king crystals. Thus, despite clearly hearing Long Chen’s order, he still needed confirmation.

“Yes, activate them all. Furthermore, it must be done stealthily without anyone being the wiser. This relates to the survival of the academy, so you must be careful,” said Long Chen.

Seeing how serious Long Chen was, Heaven Master Yun Yang didn’t dare to tarry any longer. He immediately left and personally supervised the activation. Heaven Master Yun Yang and Heaven Master Dong Ming were fully trusted by Long Chen. They were very dependable and meticulous. If Long Chen left anything to them, he could feel at ease about it.

Even Bai Zhantang and the others tensed when they heard this. The survival of the academy was at stake? Such a thing rarely came out of Long Chen’s mouth. That alone showed how serious this matter was.

“Just what happened?” Bai Zhantang couldn’t help asking.

“I’m not too sure either.” Long Chen shook his head.

“You…” Bai Zhantang almost coughed up blood. If he didn’t know anything, why was he being so grave?

“I feel like they are intentionally letting us kill these devils. I almost fell for that damn fatty Enpuda’s sinister scheme again,” said Long Chen.

Hearing that, Bai Zhantang and the others’ expressions changed. It seemed that this matter really wasn’t so simple. Everyone raised their guard.

“Not good! Our connection to the main academy has been lost!” Heaven Master Dong Ming’s expression suddenly changed.

“Everyone, come back!” Long Chen’s voice resounded through the air.
