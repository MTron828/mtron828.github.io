Chapter 4833 You Can’t Call Me Big Brother For Nothing

Lu Ziyu’s expression was calm on the surface, but Long Chen could sense the nervousness inside her heart.

On the other hand, Lu Chengfeng and the others didn’t seem to care at all. One of them said, “Seventh sister, you should calm down. Hu Yifei definitely isn’t a match for big sister.”

“That’s right. We’ve seen Hu Yifei fight, and his power is clearly inferior to big sister’s. She’ll definitely win,” declared Lu Chengfeng.

Long Chen and Mo Nian looked on the stage. At this moment, Lu Ziqiong and Hu Yifei’s auras started to rise. They had no choice but to enter their combat state as the martial stage had been activated. The pressure from the Heaven Saint devil bones forced them to unleash their own auras to resist it.

Although there was a barrier on the martial stage, the pressure of the devil bones still seeped through it. While Long Chen and Mo Nian were able to ignore it, Yu Fei looked a bit pale because of it.

“Yu Fei, are you alright?” asked Long Chen.

“I’m fine! Don’t worry about me.” Although Yu Fei said not to worry, everyone could see that she was not having an easy time.

Seeing her like that, the disciples from the Lu family displayed a hint of scorn. However, they all kept their mouths shut this time.

“This is Yu Fei’s first time coming to Devil Fall City, so she’s particularly sensitive to the devil pressure...” explained Yu Tong.

“Of course, it’s also related to her personal power,” commented one of the Lu family’s disciples lightly.

“Shut your mouth!” barked Lu Ziyu.

That disciple curled his lips and looked into the distance, clearly unwilling to accept this.

Yu Fei was embarrassed. Just as she was about to say something, Long Chen handed her a medicinal pill. When it appeared, a powerful medicinal fragrance filled their noses.

“Eat this and you’ll be fine,” said Long Chen.

“Big Brother Long Chen, I can handle it. This pill is definitely very precious. Don’t waste it on me...” declined Yu Fei with haste.

Although she didn’t know much about medicinal pills, based on the fragrance and fluctuations, this pill was definitely exceedingly precious.

“Since you’ve called me big brother, don’t stand on courtesy. When the battle starts, the devil qi will fill the sky, and you won’t be able to bear it,” stated Long Chen.

Only then did Yu Fei take the pill, her face red. The moment she swallowed it, a golden light emerged on top of her skin, accompanied by majestic fluctuations.

“That’s... a golden pill...” Lu Chengfeng and the others were dumbfounded.

When Long Chen first took out the pill, it didn't draw much attention as it appeared rather ordinary and unremarkable at first glance. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

However, once Yu Fei consumed it, they quickly realized that its unassuming appearance was due to being wrapped in a layer of pill cloth.

Even for the heavenly geniuses of the Violet Palace Sect, most of the pills they consumed were spirit pills, predominantly of top-grade quality. When it came to treasure pills, their sect rationed them monthly, providing only a limited number—usually two or three. Even someone of Lu Ziyu's caliber received just eight per month.

Moreover, within this allocation, only one treasure pill was of top-grade quality. As for golden pills, Lu Ziyu received just one per year, with the possibility of a second upon a significant breakthrough or notable contribution.

On the other hand, Long Chen had casually given Yu Fei a golden pill. Although they didn’t see what grade it was, from the golden light shining on her, they could tell that it was definitely not low.

Now all the Lu family’s disciples were stunned. How could Long Chen give away such a precious pill so lightly? That was too exaggerated.

Seeing their reactions, Yu Fei was no fool. She knew that Long Chen had just given her something incredibly precious.

“Big Brother Long Chen...”

Long Chen rubbed her head gently and smiled. “I can’t let you call me big brother for nothing. Don’t worry, it’s just a gift from your big brother. Big Brother Mo Nian will also give you something good later.”

Mo Nian glared at Long Chen, thinking that this brother of his was really evil to even drag him down. However, Mo Nian wasn’t so petty, and the Lu family’s disciples’ shocked gazes did please him, so he declared, “Sure, when we’re done here, I’ll see what suits you. After all, I’m not so cheap to bring out a mere high-grade golden pill.”

“A high-grade golden pill?”

“Cheap?”

The Lu family’s disciples stared at each other, and Lu Ziyu was visibly shocked. Although she had guessed that it was a high-grade golden pill, as she had consumed one before, she was also taken aback when Mo Nian mentioned it like that. After all, a golden pill was far too precious.

Mo Nian was intentionally exaggerating, but his exaggeration worked. Now, the Lu family’s disciples were completely shocked and wondering where they had come from.

“Big Brother Long Chen, we don’t need it...” Yu Tong and Yu Fei immediately grew uneasy.

Long Chen waved his hand. After that, he turned to the Lu family’s disciples and said, “We two brothers only met Miss Lu Ziqiong once but are indebted to her. Due to this, I have no choice but to say a few words to you.”

“What words?” Lu Ziyu and the others were startled.

“You are lucky. You were born under the protection of a large tree that blocked the wind and rain for you. From your words and bearing, we can see your exceptional immaturity and ignorance.”

The expressions of the Lu family’s disciples darkened, but Long Chen remained composed as he continued, “You've survived this long on luck alone, unaware that you are only skilled in reincarnating into a good sect.”

“You...!” Lu Chengfeng shot up angrily.

Long Chen waved his hand dismissively. “Sit down. With your power, you wouldn’t live past three moves against me. I say this not to show off or preach. I am simply telling you about a common mistake cultivators make. Don’t look down on others. True experts do not fear the strong, and they do not bully the weak. But you manage to do the opposite. Experts always raise their weapons against stronger opponents, while the weak only raise their weapons against people weaker than them. Such a cultivation attitude foreordains your future growth.”

While the Lu family’s disciples were angry with Long Chen, his last words silenced them completely. Lu Ziyu stared at Long Chen in shock because she understood the true meaning behind his words.

Mo Nian clapped his hands, praising, “As expected of the youngest dean in the history of the world’s number one academy. That was a well-spoken speech.”

“The world’s number one academy?”

“History’s youngest dean?”

The Lu family’s disciples stared in shock at Long Chen.

BOOM!

Just then, all the runes of the martial stage lit up, and a wild devil pressure unfurled.

“Let the battle commence!” An ancient voice reverberated throughout the venue. As soon as that voice rang out, Lu Ziqiong and Hu Yifei’s auras erupted like volcanos.
