Chapter 2735 Humiliation

“Don’t worry, such a day will never come. No one can protect their secrets in front of me. The Lord Saint gave me one month, so we can play slowly. There’s no need to rush, hehe…”

The Heaven Executioner’s blade suddenly lit up with runes, and he stabbed it into Long Chen’s chest.

As the sound of it scraping against bone rang out, Long Chen’s body twitched violently. The pain made veins pop on his forehead, but he still didn’t make a sound.

“When your Spirit Bone was taken, it seemed that I wasn’t very clean. Let me help you tidy up…” The Heaven Executioner smiled eerily and began to drag his blade down. The Spirit Bone was what connected the spirit and the Blood Qi, and its location could be said to be the most sensitive spot in the human body. For a blade to stab through there was enough to make a person want to die.

“Does it hurt? If it hurts, you should scream. That might make you feel better.” The Heaven Executioner’s words were enticing. They definitely had a powerful effect on someone in unimaginable pain. However, Long Chen knew that once he screamed, his last mental defense would crumble. This was a mental battle.

The pain washed over Long Chen’s body like a tsunami. He clenched his teeth, not making a sound.

Suddenly, his vision darkened as he fainted. Only then did the Heaven Executioner pull back his blade. His smile vanished, replaced with a solemn frown.

Long Chen’s will was truly terrifying. This one move of his had caused countless people before him to submit; most people couldn’t endure it. Even people with incredibly strong wills were only able to endure a few breaths’ time.

However, Long Chen had endured for an incense stick’s worth of time before directly fainting. There was no opening in his will to exploit.

In his entire life, the Heaven Executioner had only failed with this technique on two people. One was Long Chen, while the other was Long Chen’s father.

“We can go slowly. We’ll continue in three days.”

The Heaven Executioner snorted at the unconscious Long Chen and left. That was because he knew that Long Chen’s unconscious state would last three days. During these three days, he couldn’t possibly push Long Chen any further or he would really die. The Lord Saint had specifically given him a month’s time to avoid pressing him, so he wouldn’t make a mistake due to impatience. If Long Chen did die, there would be no way for them to dredge his secrets out of him.

Once the Heaven Executioner left, this desolate world only had a giant net remaining. Long Chen was trapped at the center of this net.

“What to do? What can I do? How can I escape?”

Even while unconscious, Long Chen’s mind didn’t slumber. He was thinking of how he could escape his current predicament.

He couldn’t die. If he died, everyone in the Dragonblood Legion would unleash a suicidal charge to avenge him. If he died, everyone he cared about would perish as well, and the Martial Heaven Continent would be destroyed. The five Sovereigns had placed their trust in him. Although he hadn’t promised them anything, he could feel that burden on his shoulders.

“Lei Linger has also been sealed and cannot help me.” Long Chen slowly opened his eyes and looked at his palm sadly.

In order to kill Long Aotian, Lei Linger had unleashed her full power. Long Chen had wanted to destroy his physical body and take his Yuan Spirit hostage with that killing blow, but it had been ruined by the Lord Saint. With that one failure, everything fell apart.

Due to using up all her energy, Lei Linger had hidden herself in the lightning rune in his palm. However, that rune had been sealed, which cut off his connection to her.

The current Long Chen could truly be said to have used up all his trump cards. The only thing that gave him some comfort was that Evilmoon had escaped. It hadn’t been captured, so it would definitely transmit this news to the Martial Heaven Continent.

If the High Priest learned of this, he would definitely do his best to save Long Chen. However, right now, Long Chen was worrying more about Zi Yan.

This giant scheme’s main target had not been him but Zi Yan instead. It could be said that her plight was far worse than his.

If the positions were switched, if Long Chen made a mistake that caused Zi Yan to be captured, he would go crazy. Furthermore, thinking of how she was being tormented by those old witches from the Illusive Music Immortal Palace, his killing intent surged. As expected, the Nine Star Hegemon Body Art’s senses were the most accurate. Bad people were simply bad people. He should have killed them as soon as he saw them.

“Although I managed to trick that pervert, I need to come up with some way of escaping. What can I possibly do within three days?” pondered Long Chen.

All his power was being sucked away by this net, as if countless leeches were sucking away his energy. Any trace of power he summoned would be sucked away.

He didn’t even have the Spiritual Strength to connect with the primal chaos space. Moreover, he had no way to use the power locked away in his 108,000 stars. Even if he could, it would be useless. The power of his stars would also be sucked away by these countless formations.

Long Chen had never been in such a hopeless scenario before; all his paths were blocked shut. He was at his wit’s end.

“Am I supposed to wait to be saved here?”

Long Chen shook his head. Even if the High Priest knew his predicament, the former wouldn’t possibly attack the divine families.

The Martial Heaven Continent was in imminent peril. Anything could cause the battle to start in advance.

Furthermore, he was captured in the Ancient Battlefield, so how could they know that he was in the divine families? Just as what the Lord Saint said, even knowing would be useless. They couldn’t find him here.

Three days quickly passed and the Heaven Executioner returned, this time with more than ten different torture tools. However, even his best efforts didn’t cause Long Chen to make a sound. In the end, Long Chen fainted once more.

This time, the Heaven Executioner’s expression was much darker. Long Chen’s will made him feel a bit of fear, shaking his confidence. If this continued, there would be no way for him to open Long Chen’s mouth.

Another three days passed. However, when the Heaven Executioner finished, his expression was twisted. He had failed once more. All his torture skills were useless.

After another few days, he brought two additional people. One was Long Aotian who only looked at Long Chen. But curiously, he didn’t do anything. After staring at Long Chen, he snickered, “Long Chen, hold on. I’ve advanced to the tenth Heavenstage, do you see? I’m already at the Venerate realm, and I’m going to break through to the Saint realm soon. You must be calm and patient during this time. Don’t get too emotional, or you might die. Endure until I become a Sovereign. I want you to personally witness me killing every person you care about.”

After saying that, Long Aotian patted Long Chen’s face, laughed, and left. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

The other person then stepped forward. Looking at him, Long Chen was surprised. It was Ye Qian, the Divine Pill Division’s heavenly genius, someone the Pill Doyen viewed highly. He had now reached the ninth Heavenstage of Heaven Merging.

Ye Qian came up to Long Chen and sneered, “Long Chen, today I’ll repay you for the humiliation you made me endure in the divine pill plaza.”

BOOM!

Ye Qian suddenly punched Long Chen’s chest, causing the latter to cough up a mouthful of blood and faint.

“What are you doing!?” raged the Heaven Executioner. He then checked on Long Chen. Fortunately, he hadn’t died. Ye Qian clearly hadn’t discussed this punch with him beforehand.

“Sorry, I simply couldn’t endure my hatred,” apologized Ye Qian.

“You immature fool, scram!” shouted the Heaven Executioner. If Ye Qian had killed Long Chen just now, all their efforts would have been wasted.

Ye Qian apologized and left. When he was about to vanish, he stealthily glanced back at Long Chen with a complicated expression.
