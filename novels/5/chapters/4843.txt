Chapter 4832 Blood Transformation Divine Technique

That person’s face was covered in runes resembling tattoos, which made it challenging to discern his age. His eyes surprisingly had vertical pupils akin to a crocodile’s, and they looked rather intimidating.

Upon locking eyes with Long Chen, the man’s vertical pupils contracted, and a greedy appearance graced his face. He was like a hungry wolf eyeing its prey.

Pointing a finger at Long Chen, he bared his sharp teeth. It seemed that he was telling everyone that Long Chen was his prey.

Long Chen hadn’t found a good outlet to release his pent-up fury. Hence, when this strange man provoked him, his killing intent surged in response.

Once Long Chen’s fury reached a certain level, he always looked calm, and without looking at his chilling eyes, others wouldn’t be able to tell the change in his emotions. However, Mo Nian noticed that Long Chen had decided to kill this man.

“Who is he? Why is he so arrogant?” Mo Nian asked in place of Long Chen.

Lu Ziyu looked at that person and answered, “He is Cao Shaoqing, the direct grandson of the Iron Blood Gate’s master. He has reached the eighth level of the Iron Blood Gate’s secret art—the Blood Transformation Divine Technique. This technique comprises ten levels, but only a few ever reached the seventh, let alone the eighth, which is reserved for peak experts whose names endure in history. Cao Shaoqing, aided by the Iron Blood Gate, fused with the essence blood of the Immemorial Blood Crocodile, transforming into a half-beast monster. His power is truly terrifying.”

“Blood Transformation Divine Technique? Isn’t that a lost technique capable of merging with any bloodline and reviving its primordial state?” asked Mo Nian.

Lu Ziyu replied, “Yes, it is that technique. The versions of it in the outside world are mostly incomplete and damaged. Only the Iron Blood Gate has the complete technique. Without the complete technique, Cao Shaoqing wouldn’t have been able to train it to the eighth level, nor could he have merged with the essence blood of the Immemorial Blood Crocodile. Also, the blood that he had fused with belonged to a Heaven Saint Immemorial Blood Crocodile.”

Mo Nian nodded. “No wonder he’s so arrogant. He’s reached the eighth level and should be able to unleash some of the divine abilities of a Heaven Saint Immemorial Blood Crocodile.”

Seeing Long Chen’s lack of reaction, Cao Shaoqing thought that Long Chen didn’t understand what he was implying. He then pointed at Long Chen and mimicked a tearing motion with both hands.

Finally losing his patience, Long Chen countered the gesture. After all, due to being on opposite sides, there was no way for them to speak or fight. Long Chen raised his left hand high, made a plucking motion with his right hand, and then interlocked his hands, suggesting a squeezing action. He then pointed at Mo Nian and mimed dragging something along the ground.

These actions left Cao Shaoqing baffled, and even Lu Ziyu didn’t understand them.

Left with no other option, Mo Nian imitated Long Chen’s gestures as he explained, “Long Chen’s saying that he’ll catch that fellow, pluck every single one of his teeth, and then wring his head off. However, Long Chen also wants him not to worry because I’ll dig a hole so that he can rest in peace.”

Mo Nian looked at Long Chen helplessly and commented, “Long Chen, your gestures aren’t very professional. You need to work on your acting. Sigh, they can’t possibly understand. Here... let me do it for you.” Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

Just as Mo Nian was about to provoke Cao Shaoqing, the martial stage lit up, and the empty seats instantly became packed with people.

With countless people being transported to their seats at once, the once-silent atmosphere became filled with chatter. Passionate discussions about what might unfold filled the air. With millions of people suddenly entering this place, it became deafening.

Upon arrival, these people surveyed their surroundings. After a brief scan, their attention gravitated toward the ten seats closest to the stage on either side. Nearly everyone's gaze fixated on Long Chen and his companions.

Mo Nian raised his hands to gesture, but upon realizing the multitude of eyes on him, he shook his head. “Ah, I think I’ll pass actually. If someone misinterprets what I’m saying, my glorious name will be ruined.”

Surprised cries rang out from the crowd, mentioning the likes of Lu Ziyu, Lu Chengfeng, and the others. It seemed that these young heavenly geniuses had a great deal of fame in Devil Fall City.

However, the name that resonated the most was Cao Shaoqing. Alongside shock, a palpable sense of fear colored the voices of those who mentioned him. Cao Shaoqing's presence sent waves of astonishment through the spectators.

So many people had entered the venue at once, but not one of them acted improperly. They all obediently sat in their own seats.

Many gazes swept over Long Chen and Mo Nian as well, but that was all. Clearly, in Devil Fall City, the two of them were nothing more than two nameless grunts.

Lu Chengfeng and the others pushed out their chests with pride when they heard so many people mentioning them.

“It must be nice to be young,” sighed Mo Nian as he watched them.

“Yes, being young really is nice.” Long Chen agreed.

“What are you two talking about? Why do you guys act like old men?” asked Yu Tong.

They were all clearly of similar age, with Long Chen appearing even younger. Yet, their demeanor and tone suggested a wisdom beyond their years.

“We've moved past the youthful days of easily getting excited to the point of being wet,” replied Mo Nian, looking up at the sky and sighing.

“Can you not be so perverted?” Long Chen was speechless, never having expected Mo Nian to suddenly say such a thing.

“What does that mean?” asked Yu Tong curiously.

Yu Tong and Yu Fei were indeed purehearted maidens who didn’t understand the meaning behind those words. Lu Ziyu also looked confused, but the expression of one female disciple of the Lu family became a bit odd.

“Ask him. He’ll give you a clear explanation,” answered Long Chen, throwing this hot potato to Mo Nian.

However, Long Chen clearly underestimated Mo Nian’s thick face. Mo Nian solemnly said, “I was referring to your eyes getting wet from how excited you are—being moved to tears. Long Chen, what were you thinking? Tch, don’t be such a dirty-minded scoundrel!”

Mo Nian simply threw the dirty water back on Long Chen and left him with no way to retort. Indeed, Mo Nian was so skilled that Long Chen had to admit defeat this time.

Just then, the martial stage quivered. When two figures appeared on the martial stage, startled cries rang out in the whole venue.

Following that, a majestic pressure surged, bearing the overwhelming aura of a Heaven Saint, nearly suffocating millions of people with its intensity.

“It’s starting!”

Lu Ziyu stared at her big sister, her heart tightening with worry.
