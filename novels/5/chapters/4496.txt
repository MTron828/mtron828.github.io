Chapter 4485 Heavenly Province’s Assassin

“Boss, what is it?”

Bai Xiaole saw Long Chen turn into a golden streak that charged toward the inner academy.

“Don’t ask. Just go!” Bai Shishi knew that things were bad when she saw Long Chen’s expression change. Thus, she and Bai Xiaole followed as quickly as they could.

Long Chen’s Kunpeng wings propelled him with unmatched speed, and a streak of light shot through the academy, bewildering the disciples.

Without hesitation, Long Chen went straight to a certain building in the inner academy. This was the region where the core disciples of the inner academy resided. It was filled with the academy’s top geniuses.

“Luo Ning, watch out!”

Long Chen’s shout was like an explosion of thunder, shaking the heavens. At this moment, a violet light erupted within one of the buildings, tearing it apart, accompanied by a chorus of horrified screams.

Rushing into the chaos, Long Chen found Luo Ning in critical condition. A sharp blade had pierced her heart, and her violet blood nearly drained. The flame of her soul flickered, on the brink of extinction. Long Chen, gripped by horror, reached out to her. Yet, in that moment, a slender blade silently thrust toward his right ribs without a sound.

Holding Luo Ning with his right hand, Long Chen left his right side exposed. The moment this blade appeared, a chilling sensation enveloped Long Chen’s ribcage, causing half his body to instantly stiffen.

Although the blade had not physically pierced him, it felt as if it had struck him, inflicting genuine pain.

It was like an illusion art, but an illusion art was not something that could bewilder Long Chen. This feeling was more like a premonition, compelling him to instantly recoil.

Dragon scales appeared on his right ribs, covered in stars that coalesced into a formidable astral shield. After setting this defense, Long Chen continued to reach toward Luo Ning.

The moment Long Chen held Luo Ning’s wrist, the slender blade struck Long Chen’s astral shield and dragon scale defenses.

A long cut marred his right ribs. Furthermore, as the blade sliced through his flesh, Long Chen’s violet blood was crazily absorbed by a mysterious force.

Long Chen was startled. Now, he understood the reason behind Luo Ning’s violet blood vanishing instantly. It seemed that this sinister blade was made specifically to counter violet blood. It had to be a bloodsucking weapon.

“Oh?” A surprised exclamation echoed from the dust, as if the assassin didn’t expect to only get so little violet blood after piercing Long Chen’s defenses.

“Divine Dragon Tail Pendulum!”

Long Chen’s enraged roar reverberated as he swung his leg, unleashing explosive power. An immense dragon tail followed suit, sweeping through the air and tearing the very fabric of the void asunder.

A sharp blade swung through the air several times, leaving several large cuts in the void. A translucent figure then shuttled through these cuts and actually avoided the area of Long Chen’s attack.

After that, Bai Shishi and Bai Xiaole arrived. Seeing that translucent figure, Bai Shishi immediately summoned her manifestation, and her golden sword slashed toward that figure.

“Come back!” Long Chen cried out. He was holding Luo Ning’s wrist, sending his violet blood into her arm. He shot out as well.

Just then, Bai Shishi’s sword fell onto that slender blade, and sparks flew. Finally, they could see the appearance of that blade.

It was a sword, measuring four feet in length but only as wide as a single finger. Covered in barbs with holes throughout it, the sword had a flexible body, reminiscent of a viper.

“Xiaole, bring her back!” shouted Long Chen.

Bai Shishi had thought that her attack would cut through this sword or at least force her opponent back. To her surprise, the peculiar sword not only thwarted her attack but also wound around her blade like a viper. Mimicking the striking motion of a serpent, it swiftly lunged toward her.

In an instant, Bai Shishi experienced a searing pain in her soul, causing her body to stiffen. Helplessly, he could only watch as the sword aimed directly at her head.

Suddenly, space twisted, and Bai Shishi vanished. The strange sword pierced through the air but didn’t harm Bai Shishi.

In that crucial moment, Bai Xiaole’s pupil arts had saved Bai Shishi. Now, both of them stood silently, pale with fright. None of them had expected their opponent to be so terrifying. One move was all that separated them from death. Had Bai Xiaole hesitated in the slightest, Bai Shishi would have met her demise.

Just then, Long Chen charged out, wielding the Seven Peak Sword in his hand.

The two swords repeatedly clashed, exchanging a hundred blows in the blink of an eye. When they finally disengaged, Bai Shishi and Bai Xiaole’s expressions changed. Long Chen’s shoulder was bleeding as he had been struck by that person again.

“It seems that you must be Long Chen?”

The translucent figure didn’t choose to press the attack but instead retreated a bit, pointing the mysterious sword at Long Chen.

It was the voice of a man but extremely odd. The voice was completely different from that of a human.

In fact, his voice was just like his sword; hearing it made their souls quiver. His voice alone was like poison.

“Who are you?” demanded Long Chen.

“It seems that you really are Long Chen. What a disappointment. Why did Master Ying Tian see you as his opponent? You really are overestimated.” The translucent figure shook his head, his voice full of disdain.

“You’re from the Heavenly Province?!” Bai Xiaole and Bai Shishi cried out in shock. The dean had just warned Long Chen, and the Heavenly Province was already here for him.

Not only had they come, but they had even managed to sneak through the academy’s grand formations. It was like their formations were mere decorations. Bai Shishi and Bai Xiaole were shaken. The Lifehunter race was even more terrifying than they had imagined.

“With your power, you aren’t qualified to be Master Ying Tian’s opponent. Even if I can easily slay you. Unfortunately, Master Ying Tian has given his orders, so I can’t kill you,” said that person indifferently.Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

The academy’s disciples had gathered because of the disturbance and were all stunned. What had happened to this world? How did such a terrifying existence appear out of nowhere?

From the translucent figure’s tone, he was merely Ying Tian’s subordinate, but he had the power to injure Long Chen and even said that he could easily slay him? They were completely dumbfounded.

“Luo Ning!”

At this moment, a horrified cry rang out as Luo Bing saw her little sister unconscious. She hastily rushed over.

Seeing this, the translucent figure vanished, and Long Chen moved at the same time.
