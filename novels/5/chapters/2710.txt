Chapter 2699 Success In Sight

The passage to the lightning domain was opened by Lei Linger. Millions of lightning dragons flew out, and amongst them were nine multicolored dragons that were particularly conspicuous.

As soon as they appeared, a terrifying pressure crashed down upon the world. Their auras caused Heaven Merging experts to tremble.

Last time, Long Chen had sent a sea’s worth of divine lightning into the lightning domain, causing it to transform. The dragon kings had all entered slumbered and begun a metamorphosis.

That was why despite facing so many terrifying enemies, Long Chen had never unleashed the dragons of the lightning domain since then. They had been in the midst of the transformation.

It was only last month that when he checked on the lightning domain, he saw that the dragon kings had awoken. Furthermore, they all managed to advance.

At this moment, the spatial channel quivered and golden light dazzled everyone’s eyes. From within the lightning, a giant golden dragon appeared.

The king of the lightning domain had advanced to be a dragon emperor. Its entire body was now covered in scales that looked to be made out of immortal gold.

“Boss!”

In front of everyone’s shocked gazes, the dragon emperor lowered its head to Long Chen. This terrifying existence was calling Long Chen boss.

What they didn’t know was that the dragon emperor’s transformation this time had caused it to be completely loyal to Long Chen. Although it was a spirit of the lightning domain, it also understood gratitude. After meeting Long Chen, it had gained endless benefits.

When they were first made back in the day, they were born to be servants to the human race’s experts. That was a forced servitude. But this time, they were all willing to follow Long Chen.

However, Long Chen didn’t permit them to call him master, so in the end, the dragon emperor had an inspiration from the Dragonblood warriors, calling him boss.

Sensing the endless power of divine lightning in the air, the dragon emperor knew that Long Chen had called them for more benefits. It seemed that every time that Long Chen called them, they profited. Having advanced to a dragon emperor, it had unprecedented power that it was willing to use for Long Chen.

“Damn, I forgot that you had this move left.” Evilmoon sighed with relief. It had actually forgotten about this trump card. No wonder Long Chen had dared to fight so recklessly against Sovereign Yun Shang.

As the energy of the lightning domain flooded into the Martial Heaven Continent, the laws of the two worlds mixed. The dragons of the lightning domain were incredibly excited, like wolves seeing plump meat.

However, without the dragon emperor’s orders, they didn’t dare to start absorbing this energy. They were waiting for the dragon emperor’s orders.

At this moment, the dragon emperor lowered its giant head below Long Chen’s feet, raising him up. On top of a giant dragon, Long Chen looked toward the four Sovereigns. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

Although he was covered in blood, it didn’t tarnish his image of an unrivaled hero. It was as if he was a celestial being. He smiled at the Sovereigns. “Junior brother only has this little ability. I’ve been rude to big brother Yun Shang, and I can’t do the same to my other big brothers and sister. Furthermore, I really can’t bear to kill big sister Han Wei. So don’t blame me for this little trick.”

“Attack!” Long Chen suddenly waved his hand. The dragon emperor let out a thunderous roar, and the lightning domain’s dragons charged at the four Sovereigns.

“Hahaha, little brother, you really are amazing. I was worried for nothing.” Sovereign Han Wei laughed as she plucked at the void. Zither strings manifested before her.

Countless lightning dragons were slashed apart by those zither strings, but they were lightning spirits, and after being destroyed, they were quickly reborn.

Furthermore, the destruction and rebirth allowed them to absorb a great deal of the divine lightning energy in the air, causing them to grow stronger.

The dragon kings also attacked, their claws raking through the air. That power was something that even made mid Heaven Merging experts pale.

BOOM!

A dragon king fought against Mo Li. With every swing of his sword, its body was shattered, but it would quickly reform. After seven times, its aura had clearly grown.

On the eighth time, its body was sliced apart, but it didn’t shatter. Its body reconnected and continued fighting.

Meanwhile, Long Chen stood atop the dragon emperor’s head. He retreated from the Heavens’ Wrath state, as well as the Six Star Battle Armor. He focused on recovering as quickly as possible.

He had paid an immense price to kill Sovereign Yun Shang. Even in the Heavens’ Wrath state, although most of the energy had come from the spirits of life in this world, it had also exhausted close to sixty percent of Long Chen’s max spiritual yuan and eighty percent of his Spiritual Strength.

If it weren’t for his powerful Spiritual Strength, he wouldn’t have been able to control such a huge amount of power. Although the attack had succeeded, he wasn’t too happy about it. Instead, it simply showed the difference between himself and a Sovereign.

Sovereign Yun Shang was the first generation Sovereign and also the strongest Sovereign in history. In this tribulation, a clone created by the Heavenly Daos had at most eighty percent of his original power. Furthermore, without a physical body, there were many techniques that he couldn’t unleash.

Moreover, some terrifying techniques couldn’t be imitated by the heavenly tribulation. For example, Long Chen’s own Nine Star Hegemon Body Art, the Heavens’ Wrath, the ninth form of Split the Heavens, and even Evilmoon could not be replicated. That was why he was able to kill the clones of himself.

Since that was the case, Long Chen couldn’t help shaking his head. The difference was truly great.

Long Chen could vaguely feel that the difference might not be as great as he felt. He had the utmost confidence in the Nine Star Hegemon Body Art. This was definitely a supremely terrifying cultivation technique.

The Pill Sovereign’s will had influenced him, preventing him from retreating, forcing him to face Sovereign Yun Shang with his life on the line. However, Long Chen felt like he had vaguely grasped something.

“Could it be… that my Six Star Battle Armor is incorrect?”

A flash of insight suddenly struck him. Why would the Pill Sovereign’s will suddenly pop up after vanishing for so long? What did it mean?

“Retreating midway? Fighting to the death? Seeking opportunity while being surrounded by danger…?” Long Chen muttered to himself, a strange expression on his face.

Just as he was trying to understand if the Pill Sovereign’s will was hinting something to him, the golden dragon emperor also joined into the fray. With every one of its attacks, the void collapsed. Only it was able to face the Sovereigns head-on without being injured.

The other lightning dragons were constantly being blown apart, but their numbers were endless, and they were rapidly reborn, growing stronger and stronger.

Hence, the four Sovereigns were drowning within the sea of lightning dragons. This was a battle of attrition, and Long Chen was borrowing the power of the lightning domain to get a breather.

“The Sovereigns’ power is starting to drop!”

Suddenly, someone let out a delighted cry. After such a long time, there was a clear sign that the Sovereigns’ power was dropping. That meant that the heavenly tribulation was running out of power. Since the heavenly tribulation was the source of the Sovereigns, without it, the Sovereigns would vanish and Long Chen would pass it.

Just as everyone was happily surprised, divine light suddenly came from all four Sovereigns at once. They vanished.

Long Chen was still in thought when without warning, four sharp swords stabbed into his body.

“What?!”
