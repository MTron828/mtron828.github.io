Chapter 1967: 1967

The old man’s arrival caused things to become quiet . Pill Valley’s side had been in the midst of mocking the Martial Heaven Alliance’s side, but they shut their mouths now .

Everyone knew that when the old man was enraged, there was nothing he feared . They couldn’t afford to provoke such a figure .

The old man was standing on the very edge . Although he was sitting on the side of the Martial Heaven Alliance, he clearly didn’t want to mix with them .

Seeing that, Qu Jianying was sad . Clearly, the matter of her expelling Long Chen was still fresh in the old man’s mind .

She didn’t mind if others didn’t understand her actions . But this coldness from the old man hurt her .

“I’ll go over . ” Li Tianxuan stood up .

“Leave it . That old bastard, he won’t listen to anyone . Don’t bother . ” Qu Jianying shook her head .

“This is just a misunderstanding . We can resolve it,” said Li Tianxuan . This choice had been something he had forced Qu Jianying to make . Hence, he didn’t feel it was fair for the old man to blame her .

“Not all misunderstandings can be resolved . Resolving one misunderstanding will just create a second one . The two of us are fated to be like this for this lifetime . ” Qu Jianying looked at the old man’s figure . She sighed with disappointment .

Li Tianxuan couldn’t reply to this . Clearly, the old man and Qu Jianying’s conflicting views went deeper than others saw .

The old man’s arrival also brought in thousands of Righteous experts . They all paid their respects to Qu Jianying . Only through a brief conversation with them did Qu Jianying learn why so few of her people had entered in a long time . So it was all caused by Heavenly Fate Island .

She frowned, about to stand, but was stopped by Li Tianxuan . Li Tianxuan smiled . “Today, we’re just spectators, and Long Chen is the main character . He already sent word to me that there’s nothing we have to do . We can just calmly watch . ”

“That little brat, he’s the same as the old bastard . He actually doesn’t tell me anything . I’ll properly beat him once he’s safe,” said Qu Jianying irritably .

After Long Chen had been expelled, he had sent word to the old man and Li Tianxuan through the Huayun Sect . However, he hadn’t sent any news to her . It was like he was treating her like an outsider .

“Alliance head, I approve of this plan . If you don’t properly put him in his place, wouldn’t he get himself killed sooner or later? Making you, who are busy with thousands of things every day, worry about him so much, he definitely has to be taught a lesson . ” Suddenly, Mo Nian, who was sitting beside Ye Lingshan, jumped in . He wouldn’t give up any chance to con Long Chen .

Ye Lingshan found it difficult to tolerate Mo Nian . There was no way to talk with him . When he spoke, he ended all conversations, as no one could reply to him . Perhaps the only one who could keep up with him was Long Chen .

“Bastard, don’t think that you’re any better than Long Chen . Stop trying to seduce my apprentice . She won’t be marrying out . So, unless you want to marry in, you should give up . My apprentice couldn’t be seduced by Long Chen, so don’t think that your little skills are enough . I’m not trying to give you a blow, but you’re a far cry from Long Chen in that regard,” said Qu Jianying .

Just who was Qu Jianying? Did Mo Nian’s thoughts have the slightest possibility of escaping her gaze? Furthermore, she didn’t really like Mo Nian, feeling him to be even more unreliable than Long Chen . When he smiled, it was truly unbearably wretched .

“Alliance head, this is where you’re wrong . My lack of skills in this regard is due to a lack of experience . A lack of experience shows that I am a pure man, completely different from a rogue like Long Chen . Even if a thousand flowers were to drown me, I wouldn’t touch them . Just ask yourself, who is as pure as I am on the Martial Heaven Continent? Mother-in-law, just agree for my sake!” Mo Nian actually knelt down before Qu Jianying, even changing the way he addressed her .

Ye Lingshan was embarrassed and enraged . She had an urge to kick him . She had countless pursuers, but it was her first time seeing someone like Mo Nian .

Ye Lingshan’s desire came true . Mo Nian was kicked away by Qu Jianying . Perhaps it was coincidence or on purpose, but he flew over to the old man .

The old man reached and caught him . Mo Nian hastily bowed . “Many thanks, father-in-law . ”

The experts present almost coughed up blood . Mo Nian was... talented .

Everyone in the senior generation knew of the old man and Qu Jianying’s relationship . If it weren’t for their tempers being too fiery, the two of them would have long since ended up together . For him to call the old man father-in-law at this moment was quite perfect .

The old man’s expression was odd, but he didn’t refute this appellation . He glanced at the distant Qu Jianying . “Little fellow, for you to be brothers with Long Chen means you have some skill . Don’t spend all day messing around . Men should be men . As long as you are strong enough, can’t you find any woman you want? Rather than constantly pestering someone, wouldn’t it be better to conserve some face?”

Seeing that the old man didn’t refuse the title of father-in-law, Qu Jianying’s heart softened slightly . At least, she was still in the old man’s heart .

“Hmph, if he cared about face, would he be called the Western Wretch?” A cold voice rang out in the distance . It was Huo Lieyun .

Mo Nian angrily pointed at him . “Little brat, get out here . I’ll properly teach you how to behave . Was the piss bath not enough for you? This time I’ll fix that!” Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

Seeing Mo Nian directly challenge Huo Lieyun, the old man nodded, feeling that he had at least some mannerisms of an expert . But then his expression darkened . Just what expert would do something like urinate on an opponent?

Huo Lieyun suppressed his anger at that comment and sneered, “Who do you think you are? A little mouse who hides all day! If I were to fight you all-out, you would just run in your tortoise shell . Furthermore, today’s main character is Long Chen . Once I kill Long Chen, I’ll handle you, you wretch . ”

“Exactly, a wretch like Mo Nian only knows how to run . It runs in the family,” cursed someone else . This person was wearing robes of the ancient family alliance and seemed to have immense enmity with Mo Nian .

“Mo Nian, if you swear to fight to the death and not run, brother Huo will definitely fight with you . But do you dare?!” This time it was someone from the ancient races .

Before the Yin Yang World, Mo Nian’s tomb digging had been limited to the ancient family alliance . But after it, Mo Nian had expanded his work to the ancient races, the Corrupt path, the Xuan Beasts, and the other powers . Apparently, during these past few months, Mo Nian had been crazily digging up tombs .

Most days, he would manage to dig up seven ancient tombs in a day, infuriating the various large sects and families . They would then hunt him down as best as they could, but with the Earth Splitting Divine Shuttle, no one could stop him .

When he was still in the Soul Transformation realm, he had been able to easily escape his pursuers . Now that he was at the Life Star realm, he was even more difficult to catch . No one could do anything to him .

The most hateful thing of all was that Mo Nian wasn’t just flipping through their tombs and taking their treasures . He also brought their ancestors’ corpses up to the sun, defiling them . It was a great taboo, but Mo Nian did it . He had sworn to do this in the battle in the Yin Yang World . They wanted to kill him? Then fine, Long Chen would be in charge of killing the living people, while he would be in charge of digging up the dead people .

The various large powers spent all day trembling in fear that their ancient tombs would be targeted next . They spent a huge amount of money and manpower on guarding their tombs .

Before this, most enmities would be resolved by charging at the actual sect, not their ancient tombs . Mo Nian was the first to use this method of revenge, which only made people hate him more .

That was why thousands of experts immediately began to speak up to curse Mo Nian now .

On his own, there was no way that Mo Nian could curse back at all these people .

“Don’t be a coward . Go ahead . If any of their old fellows want to interfere, I’ll help you handle them,” said the old man .

Mo Nian looked back at him . Inside, he thought to himself, “Old man, I’m not as crazy as that . A single Huo Lieyun would be tough enough . There’s still True Immortal Jiaoqi, Xie Luo, and the tens of thousands of heavenly geniuses from the other powers . Are you trying to get me killed?”

“Cough, father-in-law, I want to go kill them, but the main character is Long Chen . I can’t fight over the limelight with him . I’ll wait for him before doing anything,” said Mo Nian . In the end, he obediently returned to his original position .

However, seeing Ye Lingshan glare at him, Mo Nian helplessly hid behind Li Tianxuan . Li Tianxuan was very amicable and polite . Mo Nian held him in high esteem .

Mo Nian had just sat down when a ruckus occurred . A young man had walked in . He was handsome and even scholarly, but it wasn’t because of his looks that people were startled . It was because of the giant die behind him that was constantly spinning .

“The Gambling Heavenly Dao’s heir, Hu Feng!”

People’s hearts shook . Hu Feng was an extremely mysterious existence . His fight against True Immortal Jiaoqi had caused his fame to skyrocket .

Although the two of them had just been probing each other, Hu Feng’s strange fighting style had left a deep impression on them . Some people even suspected him of being the continent’s strongest expert, but he was too low-key for them to see just how strong he was .

Hu Feng’s arrival drew everyone’s attention . Hu Feng looked around, and then, upon seeing Mo Nian, he cupped his fists .

“Brother Mo Nian, it’s been a while . I’m glad to see you as healthy and graceful as ever . ”
