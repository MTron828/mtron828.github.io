Chapter 3540

When Long Chen stepped through the gate, a heaven-shaking roar rang out right beside his ear. That two-winged vile dragon was struggling crazily within the Phoenix Blood Heavenly Silk Net.

Fortunately, time was frozen during his journey in the Golden Lotus World. This vile dragon looked the same as when he had first cast the Phoenix Blood Heavenly Silk Net over it.

Before this, he wouldn’t hesitate. He would directly flee and just give up on the Phoenix Blood Heavenly Silk Net.

However, with the golden lotus seed in the primal chaos space, Long Chen’s confidence soared. His head was clear. This lotus seed gave him endless courage and power. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

It felt like there was nothing in this world that he couldn’t do. Like a bolt of lightning, he grabbed the Phoenix Blood Heavenly Silk Net.

“Huo Linger, bind its mouth!” shouted Long Chen.

Huo Linger transformed into flame chains that wrapped around the vile dragon’s head. Meanwhile, Long Chen pulled on the Phoenix Blood Heavenly Silk Net, and his astral power flowed through it. Therefore, that dragon’s mouth was tightly bound. By the time it realized this, its mouth could no longer be opened.

It might have terrifying force biting down, but with its mouth bound, it didn’t have much power when it came to opening its mouth. Working together, Long Chen and Huo Linger managed to bind its mouth shut.

This Phoenix Blood Heavenly Silk Net’s toughness was shocking. It was almost impossible to break it. With the dragon’s mouth bound, it couldn’t use its supreme killing moves. This would protect the Phoenix Blood Heavenly Silk Net.

Seeing that it really worked, Long Chen was delighted. Moreover, there was no one here who could disturb them. If he and Huo Linger worked together, perhaps they really could subdue this terrifying dragon.

Long Chen stood atop its head. But suddenly, the void rumbled and a black figure pierced toward Long Chen.

“Big brother Long Chen, watch out!”

Huo Linger cried out in shock. Just as Long Chen was pulling the net with all his power, he forgot about the dragon's long tail that was still exposed. Its tail pierced toward Long Chen thunderously.

Its tail had a long bone stinger that flickered with cold light. That sharpness easily pierced the void.

Long Chen jumped. He had actually forgotten about this. Immediately, he activated the Lightning Body Blink.

BOOM!

The bone stinger pierced through Long Chen’s afterimage. However, Long Chen still coughed up blood and tumbled back. Despite dodging the actual stinger, the shockwaves almost smashed him apart.

Furthermore, it broke through Huo Linger’s body. This attack truly caused heaven and earth to change color.

Long Chen was blown into the distance and smashed into a tough mountain, causing it to half-collapse. Long Chen then coughed up another mouthful of blood.

On the other hand, Huo Linger had been blasted into runes and hastily pulled herself into the shape of a small dragon on Long Chen’s shoulder. They both hid behind the rocks from the dragon.

However, seeing it motionless, Long Chen was pleasantly surprised. Its head had caved in. It had actually struck itself dizzy!

“Huo Linger, pull it in quick!” shouted Long Chen.

“Big brother Long Chen, it’s no good! It’s too powerful, and as a whole, I cannot absorb it.” Huo Linger transformed into countless flame dragons that bit at the vile dragon, but she was shocked to find that she couldn’t bite through it.

“No way, it’s that powerful?!” Long Chen was shocked. Huo Linger was unable to absorb it? Then wouldn’t all of this have been for nothing?

“No, it isn’t an actual living creature! It has no body of flesh and blood. Perhaps it can be brought into the primal chaos space.” Long Chen suddenly slapped his leg.

“Three, two, one, pull!”

As Long Chen and Huo Linger pulled with all their might, the void shuddered. The giant vile dragon and the Phoenix Blood Heavenly Silk Net were instantly drawn into the primal chaos space.

Seeing that it really did work, Long Chen and Huo Linger cried out delightedly. They actually succeeded.

Inside the primal chaos space, the vile dragon instantly awoke. It opened its mouth and roared. Seeing this, Long Chen smiled mischievously. The primal chaos space would put it in its place.

However, what he hadn’t expected was for the golden lily seed to quiver, and a gentle light illuminated the vile dragon. It actually instantly crumbled apart, transforming into a sphere of flames.

“This…” Long Chen and Huo Linger were stunned. That golden light instantly turned the vile dragon into runes. Its wickedness, its brutality, its bloodthirstiness, they were all gone without a trace.

It was now simply pure energy. Its runes flowed around gently, seemingly harmless.

“Was it purified?”

Long Chen didn’t know what had happened, but it seemed that all its negative auras were removed, turning it into a clump of pure energy.

Long Chen then stared in shock at the golden lotus seed. It had to be known that the dragon was an existence on the level of a Divine Venerate. It was purified so easily?

This proved his guess that Aunt Gong had given him an amazing divine object.

Originally, Long Chen had thought that the lotus seed was to steady his heart, letting him no longer question himself, completely stabilizing his mind. But now, he found that it definitely wasn’t so simple.

Furthermore, Aunt Gong’s eyes were full of wisdom. It was as if she could see through the future, and every single one of her words contained hidden profundities.

Ever since coming out of the Golden Lotus World, Long Chen felt like he had completely transformed. He was freed from those heavy burdens that had been so heavy that he couldn’t breathe.

Aunt Gong said that he was acting correctly, and that gave him endless confidence. He could truly act as he pleased then.

Now that he had gained a lotus seed that could easily deal with a Divine Venerate, Long Chen’s confidence soared.

Suddenly, a heaven-shaking roar rang out. Long Chen jumped in shock, and his mind hastily retreated from the primal chaos space. He then looked in the distance.

In that direction, another terrifying aura was rising. It did not seem inferior to the vile dragon that he had just subdued at all.

“The Heavenly Flame World doesn’t just have one Divine Venerate level Heavenly Flame Spirit!” Long Chen was surprised, but he was also enticed.

However, he then looked at the Phoenix Blood Heavenly Silk Net and suppressed that urge. Just now, the struggling of the vile dragon had damaged the net in some places. It needed some time to repair itself.

They had relied entirely on luck to capture that vile dragon, and that kind of luck would not occur twice. Hence, Long Chen decided to obediently leave this dangerous region.

Long Chen returned according to his original path. However, Long Chen was rather depressed to find that while Huo Linger was able to absorb the vile dragon’s runes, it was very taxing to do so. Those runes were too powerful, and absorbing them was very difficult. It was like a baby using baby teeth to gnaw at a bone. Huo Linger exhausted herself without getting to eat much.

Ultimately, Long Chen had Huo Linger not waste the effort. He then brought her hunting for those weaker Heavenly Flame Spirits. They should take things gradually.

As Huo Linger grew stronger, they became able to unleash greater power from the Phoenix Blood Heavenly Silk Net. Just like the saying, one mouthful wouldn’t make someone a fatty, they had to take things step by step.

Long Chen thought of a certain region that had quite a few fourth Heavenstage Heavenly Flame Kings. At that time, due to protecting the little fox, he hadn’t bothered them.

Now he stealthily crept over again. However, he was shocked to find that quite a few cultivators were sneaking over there as well.

“Is there some treasure here?”

Long Chen was surprised and snuck his way closer. Suddenly, he noticed a group of familiar figures.

“Is the path between enemies really so narrow?”
