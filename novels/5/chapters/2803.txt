Chapter 2792 The Ultimate Form of the Six Star Battle Armor

The chain’s power had shot up. It was unknown just how many times stronger this attack’s power was compared to Ye Ming and the others.

This overwhelming power shook the Martial Heaven Continent’s experts. The battle against gods had just ended. How had an even more terrifying group suddenly appeared? It seemed that they had come specifically for Long Chen.

Long Chen’s hand caught the chain, but just at that moment, countless barbs burst out of the chain. His hand was pierced through. Furthermore, his 108,000 stars shuddered, seemingly suppressed by some mysterious energy. Long Chen’s aura instantly dropped a level.

“The Nine Star Soul Chasing Chains are specifically made to be used against nine star heirs. How does it feel to have your power disappear?” The Nine Underworld Hunter sneered, seemingly already having expected this result. A dagger appeared in his other hand, and he stabbed it towards Long Chen’s chest.

Just as he approached Long Chen and thought that he was powerless, Long Chen’s palm slammed into his head, blasting it apart.

His headless corpse fell from the sky. A Nine Underworld Hunter was killed by a slap.

Even right before his death, he didn’t understand. Long Chen’s body was clearly affected by his move. How did he still have the power to retaliate?

Clapping rang out. The middle-aged man said, “Not bad, not bad. You were able to resist the power of the Nine Star Soul Chasing Chain. That means that you’re a big fish. Good, perhaps you can give me some more surprises.”

The stronger Long Chen was, the happier the middle-aged man became. That was because the mission of the Nine Underworld Hunters was to hunt down nine star heirs, and the stronger the prey that they hunted, the greater their rewards.

Amongst the Nine Underworld Hunters, this middle-aged man’s status was already quite high. He had already killed three nine star heirs before, and had a certain understanding of them.

Another four people stepped forward, their chains whistling towards Long Chen. However, this time, Long Chen didn’t wait for them to attack. Instead, he charged towards the middle-aged man.

“Youngsters are too impatient. First let me see if you’re qualified to even fight me.” The middle-aged man shook his head, completely looking down on Long Chen. It seemed that he had no intention of fighting.

However, it was simply unknown if he was intentionally antagonizing Long Chen or if he really disdained fighting him.

“Qualified? I’ll show you my qualifications.” Long Chen slashed his blade.

The four Nine Underworld Hunters attacking him were killed instantly. The power of his attack continued towards the middle-aged man.

The middle-aged man simply extended a hand and a barrier appeared. Long Chen’s attack was easily blocked.

“Good, very good! You’re definitely a big fish, the biggest fish in history!” The middle-aged man’s smile widened.

Suddenly, more and more Nine Underworld Hunters came out of the palace. There were hundreds of them.

They immediately surrounded Long Chen. Every single one of them had a chain like vipers preparing to strike.

“Alright, the probing can end here. With your power, it’s worth it paying a huge price to bring you to the higher plane. The three nine star heirs that I killed before were all too weak. The price for them was fixed. Today, my luck is truly good. I encountered someone with a variant of the nine stars. Even your Six Star Battle Armor is different. I wonder if you’re the destined one from the legends. Haha, if that’s the case, I really struck gold. I can directly trade you for a world bead. But even if you aren’t, I’ll still be able to get a plentiful reward from Lord Brahma,” said the middle-aged man.

He waved his hand, and scenes appeared in the air. Those were scenes of experts being slain.

They were all nine star heirs. Two had reached the Five Star Battle Armor, while one had reached the Six Star Battle Armor. His Six Star Battle Armor was the original six-sided star.

The three of them all died to this middle-aged man’s hands. They all let out unwilling roars just before their deaths. Long Chen’s fury soared. This was an absolute insult to Long Chen.

“Why? Why is it that this world always has so many people who like courting death?” Long Chen’s voice was low. His body was quivering from rage. Black strands of aura began to float out of his body.

Long Chen had never been so angry. His killing intent was exploding. He felt like he was flailing into an abyss. He tried to control his anger, but people kept provoking him, wanting to kill him. He couldn’t understand why this world was like that.

The hundreds of hunters joined their chains, forming a giant net around him. The power of this formation instantly fractured the Martial Heaven Continent. The continent was unable to endure this power.

At the center, Long Chen was the target of all their power. The space around him twisted and turned. It felt as if he was being crushed by millions of stars.

Most terrifying of all, the six-point star behind him was quivering as if it might shatter as well.

Long Chen’s bones creaked. That immense pressure contained a special power that seemed to be specialized at countering the Nine Star Hegemon Body Art.

“Submit. This Star Extermination Formation is specialized for nine star heirs. Even if you had awakened your Hegemon Qi, with your current realm, you wouldn’t be able to endure the power from this many people,” said the middle-aged man. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

“There are so many people in this world who don’t know what respect is. If I can free this world from its pain, I am willing to become a devil and raise my butcher’s blade. I will kill all you inferior lifeforms.”

Long Chen’s voice came through the cracks of his teeth. It was like a god’s vow, a devil’s curse.

His six-point star began to move. The layered triangles began to revolve, one going clockwise and one going counterclockwise. His divine ring also began to revolve in different directions, with three colors going clockwise and three going counterclockwise.

In that instant, the stars within Long Chen’s body quivered. All their power ignited and gushed forth. The formation around Long Chen began to creak.

The middle-aged man’s expression finally changed. He was filled with disbelief.

BOOM!

The giant formation exploded, killing all the Nine Underworld Hunters linked to it. At the same time, Long Chen’s power soared like a dam had been broken. His power caused the world to shake.
