Chapter 3416 Nine Star Heir

The expert bound in chains to the wooden cross had just appeared when Long Chen’s six stars automatically quivered. He also felt an indescribable feeling of closeness to this expert.

He was tall with long hair, and his body wasn’t particularly thick. But he gave off a feeling as if his power could cause the heavens to collapse.

There were hundreds of steel stakes nailing him to the cross. Every steel stake was covered in runes that gave off a powerful aura.

Other than the steel stakes and chains, he also had handcuffs and fetters binding him.

He was covered in wounds, his flesh exposed all over. However, no blood flowed out as it had already run dry. He was practically a corpse.

However, countless startled cries rang out. His aura was absolutely terrifying. Despite being in the Divine Lord realm, he gave off a pressure almost equal to a World King.

Furthermore, the murderous aura around him was incredibly dense. He was just like a reaper from hell. Just looking at him made people’s souls quake.

“What a terrifying physical body. Even though all his blood has run dry, he still emits such pressure. Just who is he? What is the Sacred Pill Hall doing?” Lei Yuner stared in shock at that person. This opening of the Divine Lord Immortal Realm seemed to be different than before.

That person suddenly moved. Just from raising his head, the chains binding him tightened, and all the half-step World Kings retreated half a step from fear.

Even though he was chained, he still terrified them. Only once he raised his head did people see that he wasn’t old at all. He had thick eyebrows and big eyes, with some sideburns and facial hair. Although his eyes had lost their luster, he still gave off a very domineering feeling.

That person’s gaze swept across the crowd, and he slowly smiled disdainfully.

After that, the chains on his body slowly tightened, forcing his head down. He seemed to be trying to resist, but he was powerless. He had to lower his head.

“I’m grateful that I get to see another nine star heir before I die. I, Ba Yan, can die without regrets.” A voice rang out in Long Chen’s mind.

That nine star heir was communicating with him. It was not a spiritual communication but a communication using their FengFu Stars as the vector. Only nine star heirs could hear this voice.

“I won’t let you die. I promise.” Long Chen clenched his fists. As a fellow nine star heir, Long Chen definitely wouldn’t permit this man to die in front of him. Even if he had to lose his life, he would fight.

“You cannot save me. They have sucked away all of my essence blood and shattered my Violet Tower Star. I do not have long to live,” said the nine star heir to him. He seemed happy, as if he didn’t care about his own death. It was as if seeing Long Chen made him not care about losing his life.

“There must be a way.”

Long Chen’s heart was pounding crazily. As expected, once he advanced to the Divine Lord realm, it would be time to condense the seventh star, the Violet Tower Star.

However, Long Chen didn’t know if the destruction of the Violet Tower Star would lead to death. In any case though, it would probably signify that he would never be able to cultivate again.

“Don’t comfort me. As a nine star heir, I knew that such a day would come sooner or later. But I really do feel regret. As a nine star heir, I was unable to do anything for the nine star line. I’m going to die just like this. What a pity. Brother, I’ve seen several nine star heirs, but they’ve all died. All I could do was avenge them. You are the only living nine star heir that I’ve seen. Furthermore, you have a different aura from the rest of us nine star heirs. Perhaps you are a variant amongst nine star heirs. That might be why you have managed to conceal yourself without being noticed. That is excellent. Don’t expose yourself. Do your best to grow up and accomplish the ultimate mission of our nine star line,” said the nine star heir emotionally. He had high expectations for Long Chen.

“Leave those words for later. I’m going to make my move. Before the World Kings descend, I’m confident that I can save you,” said Long Chen. He was already starting to gather his energy.

“Fool! As a nine star heir, do you not understand what I’m saying?!”

The nine star heir’s voice became a furious roar. “My seventh star is already destroyed. I’m a cripple. Do you think I have the face to live in this world while on death’s door? Do you think I will implicate other nine star heirs because I’m afraid of death?! Do you know just how fortunate it is that you are capable of hiding your identity? If you are exposed because of me, then not even ten thousand deaths would be enough to wash away my sins!”

The nine star heir was quivering on his cross. He was clearly enraged, and his fury was because Long Chen so stubbornly wished to save him.

“Can it be that I’m supposed to just watch as you die? They pulled you out as a show of strength!” raged Long Chen. How could he control himself if he had to watch a fellow nine star heir being slain?

“Do you know how few nine star heirs can grow up under the watch of Lord Brahma? Do you know how much cruelty I had to endure to reach this level? Do you know how many times I suffered humiliation? I once watched as another nine star heir was surrounded and killed because I was powerless to save him. If I could endure, why can’t you? Even if you save me, what can that do? You will throw away your life to save a cripple? Your goal isn’t to save me but to slay that ingrate Lord Brahma, do you understand?!” roared the nine star heir.

Long Chen clenched his teeth and didn’t reply. He didn’t know what to say. He had always killed people decisively, but now he didn’t know what to do.

“Brother, I can comprehend your heart. I also went through the same thing. But you must remember not to throw your life away for nothing, not when you still have a purpose. If you really want to help me, then help me get revenge after I die. Kill Lord Brahma! Kill all his dogs!” The nine star heir’s voice suddenly softened. “Promise me that you won’t try to save me. If you do, you will fall for their trap. I have never begged anyone before in this lifetime. This is the first… and the last. I hope that you will promise me this.”

Long Chen was disconcerted. Nine star heirs had a special feeling between them. Even though it was Long Chen’s first time seeing this man, he felt as close as life-and-death brothers with him.

To have Long Chen just watch as he died was an incomparable torture.

“Fine…. I promise you. I will get revenge for you,” said Long Chen, his heart full of agony.

Long Chen knew that this was the pride of a nine star heir. Saving him would only bring him more time. He wanted to die with at least a trace of dignity.

Just then, three elders walked in and stood atop the platform. A startled cry then rang out.
