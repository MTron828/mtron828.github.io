Chapter 2301 Going in Advance

That object was a bronze plaque with a monster’s head carved into it, and there was a brass ring through its nose. It was the door knocker that Long Chen had taken from the Gates of Hell. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

The door knocker flew out of Long Chen’s hand. It rapidly grew larger, and the void rumbled. Death Qi filled the air.

Without being able to sense the danger, the Xuan Beasts’ experts were blown apart by the mountain-sized bronze plaque.

This treasure, which came from the Netherworld, was something that awakened Empyreans who had stepped into the Netherpassage realm didn’t have the slightest ability to resist.

In that instant, Peng Wanshan went from someone confident that victory was within his grasp to shocked, and then horrified. He hastily retreated but was still struck. He vomited blood and flew back.

Due to his greater experience and speed, he managed to escape death. However, a large hand grabbed his shoulder in a vice-like grip. Peng Wanshan turned in horror but didn’t even get a chance to look before a foot stamped into his back.

Just as the foot landed, another hand grabbed his ankle, picking him up.

With a hand on Peng Wanshan’s shoulder and another on his ankle, a malevolent expression appeared on Long Chen’s face. “Let’s see just how tough the spines of the Peng race are.”

Pulling hard, while pressing with his left foot, a cracking sound rang out through the air. Long Chen forcibly split Peng Wanshan in half, forcing out a mournful wail from him.

At the same time, Long Chen unleashed his own power throughout Peng Wanshan’s body, provoking his nerves to feel dozens of times the pain. Peng Wanshan almost fainted.

The remaining experts of the Xuan Beasts were horrified. They had only seen a ray of light tear through their midst that killed anyone it touched, and then Peng Wanshan had landed in Long Chen’s hands. They hadn’t even seen what that attack was.

Peng Wanshan was now in Long Chen’s hands. They didn’t dare to make a rash move.

The army of the Xuan Beasts gathered up, looking at each other in dumbfounded silence. They didn’t know what to do.

“Long Chen, release Peng Wanshan, or-” One of them started to threaten him.

Long Chen suddenly twisted Peng Wanshan. It looked like his entire skeleton was being broken.

“AHH!” Peng Wanshan screamed. His voice was chilling.

“What did you say? I didn’t hear it clearly,” said Long Chen.

“You…” That expert’s expression grew ugly. Now it was troublesome.

Peng Wanshan was the largest figure of the Xuan Beasts other than their leader, Peng Wanli. Having him be tormented in front of everyone was trampling over the dignity of the Xuan Beasts.

However, Peng Wanshan had truly been conceited. He should have immediately unleashed his full power as soon as he had seen Long Chen. He should have summoned his true form.

Unfortunately for him, he had been too confident in victory. He had viewed Long Chen as insignificant. That act had been intentional by him to provoke Long Chen and bait him into charging into their midst so that they could kill him.

In that situation, the only thing he had been worried about was Long Chen fleeing, so he had provoked him. At the very least, it could be said that his plan had worked very well. He had succeeded in drawing Long Chen over.

Long Chen had taken his bait, but he hadn’t taken the hook. The hook hadn’t been sharp enough and had instead been smashed to pieces.

“It’s been a long time. The Xuan Beasts have gotten quite brave. Good, it just so happens that I was wondering where to go. Since you’re so enthusiastic, I won’t stand on courtesy.” Icy killing intent continued to rage in Long Chen’s eyes.

Suddenly, a flying boat tore through the void. A giant saber-image crashed down from it, slashing toward the Xuan Beasts. At the same time, an imposing and ominous voice rang out.

“Bastards of the Xuan Beasts, if I don’t smash you to pieces today, I’ll write my name backward!”

This attack came so quickly that it seemed to surpass the limits of spacetime. From the moment the saber-image appeared to when it landed, there was almost no delay at all.

The Xuan Beasts did their best to defend, but the saber-image wiped out everything it touched.

This saber-image had contained the attacker’s determination and fury. It was an attack that could not be stopped whether you ascended to the heavens or fled to hell.

The majority of the Xuan Beasts had been wiped out. The survivors were so terrified that they fled for their lives.

“Where do you think you’re running? Today, I’ll be hunting you all down to your headquarters!”

The void split open, revealing the old man. He held the Heaven Splitting Blade. Killing intent surged out of him.

When the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow race had been attacked, their alarms hadn’t gone off. However, Li Tianxuan had still sensed something wrong. Using the Reincarnation Mirror, he took a look.

Even then, everything had apparently been normal. But after watching for a while, he started to get a bad feeling.

The reason for that was because the fluctuations of the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow race’s grand formation were locked to the same frequency no matter how long he watched. That wasn’t normal.

He then quickly realized that someone had set up a larger formation to cover up what was going on inside. The next obvious conclusion was that the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow race was being attacked.

Following that, a quick investigation revealed that someone had stealthily cut off their connection with the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow race’s transportation formations. Everything had clearly been planned.

Li Tianxuan didn’t hesitate any longer upon learning that. He immediately alerted Qu Jianying and the old man, moving at top speed to help the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow race.

The old man had the worst temper and had ended up in quite a few conflicts with the Xuan Beasts during this time. Being in collusion with the other large powers, with even the divine families secretly supporting them, the Xuan Beasts had infuriated him. Then Li Tianxuan had told him that the Xuan Beasts were attacking the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow race, which Long Chen had asked him to look after before going into seclusion.

If something happened to the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow race, how could he explain it to Long Chen? So upon seeing these Xuan Beasts, he had directly unleashed a furious blow.

The old man could not be held back, not even by himself. He had already decided that no matter what, he was going to slaughter the Xuan Beasts. Even if Qu Jianying got in his way, it wouldn’t matter.

It was only after unleashing his attack that he realized Long Chen was there as well.

“Long Chen, you’re back!” The old man’s anger vanished, replaced with delight.

The old man and the others were quite emotional upon seeing them. The Dragonblood Legion had been missing for three extra months, and knowing how big Long Chen’s guts were, they were vaguely aware that Long Chen had brought the entire Dragonblood Legion to attack the Netherpassage realm together. He had been looking for a way for everyone to pass.

That was a path where they all lived, or they all died. But the chances of living were far too remote. So when he and the rest of the Dragonblood Legion didn’t return, they could only come to accept this cruel reality.

Their relief upon seeing him even temporarily blew away their anger at the Xuan Beasts for this attack. Long Chen was also emotional upon seeing their reaction. For even an iron-hearted man like the old man to react like this showed how dear he was to them.

Qu Jianying and Li Tianxuan sighed in relief upon seeing him. A heavy weight lifted from their hearts.

“Sorry for worrying you, old man. I heard that the Xuan Beasts are getting very arrogant? Are you interested in us two men doing something big?” shouted Long Chen.

“Hahaha, of course I’m interested. Don’t worry, whatever calamity you provoke, I’ll support you,” declared the old man.

“Alright, then good.” Long Chen suddenly pulled. Peng Wanshan let out a shriek as Long Chen twisted him into two loops, completely deforming him and his skeleton.

Peng Wanshan exploded. His soul was unable to bear the torment any longer, and he self-detonated. He splattered Long Chen with blood.

Tossing half a leg to the ground, Long Chen shouted, “Old man, alliance head, Xuan Master, and the other seniors, just help me lock down their paths of retreat. Today, not one of the Xuan Beasts that came here is allowed to leave. Brothers of the Dragonblood Legion, warriors of the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow race, kill them all!”

“Kill!”

Icy voices rang out in unison, all demanding blood. The Dragonblood warriors, as well as the experts of the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow race, charged out.

Meng Qi, Chu Yao, Tang Wan-er, Ye Zhiqiu, Liu Ruyan, and Dong Mingyu all went all-out. The most berserk one was Cloud as she charged through the Xuan Beasts.

Even facing powerful Xuan Beasts in the Netherpassage realm, Cloud showed off her savage side, utilizing her devouring divine ability to swallow them.

“Kill!”

The old man also shot after the survivors, his Heaven Splitting Blade wiping out masses of them.

At this moment, it was possible to see just how powerful the old man was. The Heaven Splitting Blade had a river of star-light flowing on top of it, and none of the Xuan Beasts could stop him.

There was nowhere for the Xuan Beasts to run. The Martial Heaven Alliance’s experts had completely surrounded them. As for the Dragonblood warriors, it wasn’t easy for them to slaughter Netherpassage experts, but by joining forces, they were able to do it. That was the result of the difference in realms.

In less than an incense stick’s worth of time, the Xuan Beasts had been annihilated. Long Chen announced, “Alliance head, summon the Righteous path’s disciples who are inside the Yin Yang World. We’ll meet at the Kunpeng race’s ancestral lands. We’re going to go first.”

Long Chen had Cloud bring the Dragonblood warriors speeding away.

“They’re going to…” Qu Jianying suddenly thought of a shocking possibility.
