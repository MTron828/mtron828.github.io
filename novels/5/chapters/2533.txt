Chapter 2522 Luo Spirit Race Reinforcements

Following the laughter of the Heaven Devouring Fiend King, his giant body slowly shrank until he was the size of a normal person.

However, his aura grew even more terrifying in this state. Although he was just a corpse, he was still shockingly strong.

The fiend king stretched his arms, causing a creaking sound to ring out. Black scales could be seen covering his arms, and his fingernails were three inches long, as well as black and shiny.

There was nothing left on his face save for a layer of dried-up skin attached to his skull. Also, everyone could see two dark green flames burning inside his otherwise empty eye sockets.

After successfully reviving the fiend king, Ye Ming formed some hand seals, and a strange mark appeared on his forehead. His body then vanished without a trace.

The same mark also appeared within the fiend king’s eyes. His body began to shudder and glow.

“You dare to enslave this king? You have some guts!” the fiend king roared.

“I’m the one who bestowed you with life. Without me, you would have never had a chance to revive. Being my puppet is your honor.” Ye Ming’s voice rang out from within the fiend king’s body. Ye Ming was actually using a divine art to undergo some kind of possession. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

“Bastard, do you know who I am? A little false god who underwent rebirth dares to show such disrespect to this king?!” The fiend king suddenly grabbed his head, as if trying to expel Ye Ming.

“I laid my soul seed while reviving you. Resistance is futile.” Ye Ming’s voice rang out from within the fiend king’s body once more. After that, the fiend king’s eyes began to shine brighter and brighter.

The fiend king’s body shook, and black qi gushed out of him, gradually encroaching on the tree behind him.

“Hahaha, Long Chen, are you preparing to attack me?” The fiend king suddenly stopped trembling and laughed.

Long Chen, who had been accumulating energy beneath his feet, paused. He noticed that the fiend king’s voice had changed. It was now a combination of Ye Ming and the fiend king’s voices. The possession was completed so quickly that Long Chen didn’t have a chance to interrupt it.

“I already said that everything was within my control. Although there were some unexpected mishaps, I’m still the winner. Await your deaths in despair.” Ye Ming’s voice rang out once more. He had fully merged with the Heaven Devouring Fiend King’s corpse.

Black qi continued to pour out of his back, spreading further and further. The four large figures at the bottom of the altar began to shake as well.

“Ye Ming is drawing out the final bit of energy from the giant tree to nourish this corpse. Who would have thought that this practically dead tree would still possess such terrifying life energy? If it’s all absorbed, this corpse’s power will probably reach at least half of its peak. At that time, even an expert above Netherpassage might not be able to fight it evenly. What a scheme,” sighed Evilmoon.

Being in possession of dark energy as well, Evilmoon was able to sense Ye Ming’s actions easier and understand. Ye Ming’s ambitions were truly large.

Just at this moment, when the black qi began to envelop the tree, lines appeared throughout the tree, forming a barrier that blocked the black qi.

“What? Does it still have its own consciousness?” Ye Ming was startled. Just as the final life energy of this tree was about to be taken, it ended up stimulating its self-protective will.

“Attack!” Taking advantage of this awkward moment, Long Chen suddenly attacked. Through Evilmoon, Long Chen learned that Ye Ming was not in as good of a state as he wanted everyone to believe.

At this time, he could not leave the altar, nor could he move this new body. If he did, it would sever his connection to the altar, preventing him from absorbing more of the tree’s energy.

In other words, the fiend king’s corpse would only ever have its current level of power and would no longer grow. With the tree protecting itself, Ye Ming would need to wait until that protective energy faded before he could continue absorbing anything.

Hence, now was their last and best chance to interrupt Ye Ming. If they could do that, things would be salvageable. But if he was allowed to absorb the final life energy of the tree, they would be doomed.

“You’re naive!” Ye Ming sneered at Long Chen.

“You’re the naive one. You keep playing this game of bravado and bluffing.” Long Chen slashed Evilmoon.

BOOM!

Suddenly, a large fist appeared out of the air, defending Ye Ming.

“What?!” Long Chen felt a powerful force send him flying. His wrist broke, and Evilmoon flew out of his hold. He coughed up a mouthful of blood.

“Long Chen!” Chu Yao cried out. Liu Ruyan sent out her branches to catch Long Chen, but he blasted through them.

Thankfully, the branches canceled out some of his momentum, allowing Chu Yao to catch him. She was shocked to find that all his bones had been broken in that one exchange.

“You overestimate your ability. The current you is nothing more than an ant in my eyes,” sneered Ye Ming.

At this moment, everyone realized that the four figures at the bottom of the altar had stood up. They were armored black giants.

One of them pulled back his fist. He was the one who had attacked Long Chen just now.

“The four divine generals… have revived.” Everyone was shaken. Those four figures were like iron towers, giving off immense pressure.

The four divine generals gave off icy killing intent. They were like giants from hell. It was unknown how many lifeforms they had killed to have their killing intent become almost solid.

Even someone as powerful as Long Chen was unable to block a casual blow from them. Now that they were released from the altar, who could stop them?

Just at this moment, figures began to break out of the cocoons on the giant tree’s roots.

These were newborn members of the Heaven Devouring Black Armor Corps. They were covered in scales and had bone blades in their hands. When they opened their eyes, they were clearly lost. And yet, when they saw the humans in the surroundings, a beast-like bloodthirstiness appeared in their eyes.

“Kill them!” ordered Ye Ming. These newborn warriors charged at the Dragonblood Legion.

The earth exploded as more and more warriors were born. Their numbers easily surpassed the millions, and more were continuing to come out.

The Dragonblood warriors’ hearts turned cold when they saw this endless army. Even if the Black Armor Corps just stood there and let themselves be killed, the Dragonblood warriors wouldn’t be able to kill them all.

Every one of them had a powerful aura that was stronger than a fourth step Netherpassage disciple.

As for their numbers, they were enough to bring forth despair. Even all the Martial Heaven Continent’s experts added together were just a drop in the ocean in comparison.

“Brothers, this is going to be a tough battle. But our Dragonblood Legion has never been afraid of challenges. Brothers, fight!”

Long Chen took the lead, charging back into their midst. Evilmoon unleashed a wave of divine light to pull open the prologue of this battle.

Long Chen’s attack passed through the Black Armor Corps, blasting them apart. However, they were endless. More and more of them poured out to make up for the ones Long Chen killed.

Meng Qi then formed hand seals, summoning giant figures. They were giant beast corpses. Every single one of them was as big as a mountain and emitting terrifying auras.

Over thirty beasts roared at the same time, their voices shaking all the experts.

“Skeletons of beasts above Netherpassage!” A startled cry rang out from someone who recognized them. Those beasts immediately charged forward, unleashing attacks that tore through the Black Armor Corps. They were like an iron wall protecting the Dragonblood Legion.

Meng Qi had summoned all her Nether Beasts at the same time, and their power stunned Zhao Ritian and the others. They thanked their luck that Meng Qi hadn’t summoned them before.

These Nether Beasts were Meng Qi’s strongest trump card. However, she had no choice but to use them now. They showed off their terrifying killing power, managing to block the impact of the first wave. Only a portion of the Black Armor Corps had managed to pass through.

The Dragonblood warriors were able to easily kill the remnants that passed through them. This gave a boost to the Righteous path’s experts. It seemed that they were still capable of fighting.

All of a sudden, a bone blade passed through the air, slaying one of the Nether Beasts. One of the divine generals had appeared. Even these terrifying Nether Beasts were unable to stop him.

Another divine general appeared as well. The two of them instantly created an opening within the defensive line.

The two divine generals charged toward the Dragonblood Legion. Everyone’s hearts clenched.

Suddenly, the void shuddered and a giant tree appeared, flying toward them. At the same time, countless arrows rained down on the Black Armor Corps.

“It’s Life Spirit God and the Luo Spirit race’s warriors!” Long Chen was jubilant to see the Luo Spirit race had come to assist him at this time.
