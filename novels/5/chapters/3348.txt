Chapter 3337 Heart-Devil

Within an endless darkness in which he felt like he was eternally falling, Long Chen stared at the figure in front of him. He couldn’t see it, but he could feel it.

As he looked at this figure in the darkness, it also seemed to look back at him.

“You trash.” The same voice rang out. It was the same voice as Long Chen’s, but it was icy, arrogant, and disdainful. It was like that of a god speaking down on him.

“If I’m trash, but you’re suppressed by me, what does that make you?” Long Chen shook his head at that figure.

After a moment, that figure said, “You’re a hypocrite. You bind yourself with so-called morality and virtue. If it weren’t for that, would this battle have ended like this? What can virtue and character do? Can they protect you? Can they protect the people that you want to protect? If you allowed me to control this body, the Heavenly Rainbow Fairy wouldn’t have died. What meaning does kindness have? The Heavenly Rainbow Fairy died to protect the human race, but the final trace of her discarnate soul was destroyed at the hands of the human race. Haha, isn’t that funny? Someone like you will sooner or later follow the same path as her. I won’t let trash like you control this body. I will wrest control over this body from you and show you what it means to go on a rampage, what it means to sweep through all those who block you, what it means to follow me and prosper, but defy me and die!”

Long Chen didn’t reply. He hadn’t expected this. He had finally produced a heart-devil, and it was growing stronger and stronger under the nourishment of the dark energy.

This heart-devil could control the dark energy. When he used the Purgatory Eyes, he was using that dark power.

This time, he had lost control because of his complete rage at the Bloodkill Hall’s treacherous ways. It left an opening in his will for his heart-devil to erupt. If it hadn’t been for the Heavenly Rainbow Fairy waking him up, then under the control of his heart-devil, Bai Shishi and the others would probably have died in his hands.

This so-called heart-devil was when two wills appeared in one person. It was an embodiment of a contradiction within a person. Many people who appeared strong on the outside actually felt inferior inside, so that toughness was just to cover up that feeling of inferiority.

One part felt like they were omnipotent, the other part felt that they were useless. As these contradictory feelings arose, the heart-devil would become the greatest blockade when attempting to advance realms.

A heart-devil indicated that a person’s mental realm was no longer clear. Their will was no longer one. A fiend hiding deep within your soul that might come out and try to kill you at any moment was naturally terrifying.

Long Chen had always thought that he acted as he thought and thus was protected from a heart-devil. Unexpectedly, it really did appear. Furthermore, it was many times stronger than him.

However, he didn’t feel much fear. He just quietly looked at it without saying a word.

“Why aren’t you speaking? Are you afraid? You’re too cowardly. You aren’t fit to control this body,” sneered that figure.

“The first time you appeared should have been in the Netherworld, right? When Xie Qianqian and I escaped Purgatory, when we were definitely going to die, you appeared. But you were suppressed again by Evilmoon, correct?” said Long Chen calmly.

“You knew?” The voice rang out with a touch of surprise.

“Of course I knew. Ever since I left Purgatory, I felt a bit off. But I also wasn’t able to figure out what exactly felt off. I actually thought I was influenced by the laws of Purgatory, resulting in my mental state becoming a bit disordered, so I didn’t mind it. Then in the final battle of the Martial Heaven Continent, I used that dark energy and I sensed you. At the time, you didn’t make any move. Later, I began testing using the dark energy through the Three Flower Pupils. I deliberately acted very stupidly, continuously failing. Eventually, you simply couldn’t keep watching that, so you worked together with me so that I could control the dark energy. This was your scheme. You wanted me to use more of the dark energy, giving you more chances to corrode my will. The reason my control over my emotions frayed is also due to your influence. When my mind is undisciplined, you take advantage to control my body. If I were to fall asleep just before, you would have become the master of this body. If it hadn’t been for the Heavenly Rainbow Fairy, you would have basically succeeded,” said Long Chen, still as calm as ever.Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

“Hmph, that woman was meddlesome. Otherwise, I could have gone through the spatial gates and slaughtered the dark lifeforms of those domains. At that time, I, Long Chen, would dominate the ten thousand races. Within heaven and earth, only I would reign supreme. Who would dare to resist me? There would no longer be a useless coward like you who suffers humiliation from all sides. You’ve practically humiliated the name of Long Chen!” raged that voice.

“So what if you subdue the ten thousand races? So what if you reign supreme? You are going to sacrifice my brothers for that? Are you an animal?!” cursed Long Chen.

“Are those useless brothers and women of yours the slightest bit useful? They are only stumbling blocks to getting stronger. Without them, you would be truly free. Only then can you reach the peak of the world as fast as possible. Now you are being a fool with them, and you want to curse others?!” raged that voice.

“In your eyes, are absolute power and supreme authority all that matters? When you stand at the peak, you will find that when you are happy, there is no one to share it with. When you are sad, there is no one to comfort you. All that people will feel toward you is fear. Is that what you wanted?” asked Long Chen.

“What a joke. True experts all want absolute power. As long as you have power, you can have anything you want. Don’t share my joy? I’ll kill you. Don’t listen to my sorrows? I’ll kill you. I am the master of the world. The ten thousand Daos must obey me. Who dares to not follow?”

“Fuck off. I can’t be bothered to talk to you. I am the master, you are a heart-devil. You will always be suppressed by me. Do you think that I’m giving you face by talking to you?!” raged Long Chen. Originally, he had been hoping to communicate with his heart-devil and see if they could come to some resolution, but instead he was so infuriated he felt like he might explode.

“Bullshit. If it weren’t for me, you would already be dead. Who do you think you are to act like some big wig? I am the master of the dark energy. If you have guts, then don’t use my power for the rest of your lifetime. Otherwise, every time you use my power, it is my turn to control the body!” roared that figure, also infuriated.

“Then let’s just see what happens.”

“Yes, let’s see.”

Long Chen suddenly sat up from his bed, so suddenly that Bai Xiaole and the others cried out. He was originally in a deep slumber, and he sat up so suddenly that they almost took out their weapons.

“Boss… what is it?” asked Qin Feng worriedly, seeing Long Chen’s eyebrows pointed down angrily.

“I’m fine. It was a dream. I saw some idiot that pissed me off.”

Long Chen took a deep breath and flapped his hand, indicating that he was fine. This heart-devil really irritated him.

According to reason, a heart-devil was another portion of his will. If it was part of him, he should be able to communicate with it. But this one conversation had made him want to kill it.

Suddenly, one of Long Chen’s tablets flashed. Long Chen’s heart leaped. “We are immediately returning to the Vile Dragon Domain.”
