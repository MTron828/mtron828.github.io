Chapter 4518 Asura Race

“You damn bastard, stop right there!”

BOOM!

As some buildings exploded, a figure came flying out of the rubble, soaring with Kunpeng wings unfurled on its back.

It was none other than Long Chen, and in his wake trailed three Saints and a horde of enraged Eternal experts. Their faces contorted with fury, as if Long Chen was the one who had slain their fathers.

“Stop? Oh, after giving me so many treasures, are you inviting me to stay for a meal as well? Sorry, but I’m quite busy. You can all leave now. No need for further gifts.” Long Chen bid them farewell with a warm wave.

“Bastard, leave our things behind, otherwise...!”

The three Saints were so enraged that flames almost burst out of their eyes.

This location served as a large weapon-forging factory of the Heavenly Corrupt Sect, where they manufactured all the weapons for their disciples. Every material used in their weapon forging was centralized here, making it a crucial hub for the sect. As it was located on the border of their central land, the Heavenly Corrupt Sect had never faced a threat to this vital facility.

Due to its seemingly strong defenses, no intruder had ever infiltrated this place. However, Long Chen did it so easily. Perhaps this place had been safe for too long, so they didn’t even realize that Long Chen had raided their entire stock of materials.

Long Chen had taken all the immortal materials and divine weapons stored in thousands of treasuries, yet the alarm still hadn’t sounded.

However, Boss Long San couldn’t just leave without making a ruckus; that wasn’t his style. Having no other choice, he went to their weapon-forging divine hall, and the craftsmen there let out panicked shouts when they saw him.

Long Chen was content with their reaction, so he unleashed the prepared World Extermination Flame Lotus upon them. Just like that, all the craftsmen and their handiwork met their demise, and the grand formations of this area lay in ruins.

Seeing the devastation, all their experts went crazy. They then came to “send Long Chen off” and also “bless” eighteen generations of his ancestors.

Even while pursued and cursed, Long Chen felt an undeniable sense of delight. As expected, doing bad things was really delightful.

Long Chen started to understand why Mo Nian was always such a wretch. There was a certain joy in provoking others and then basking in the knowledge that they couldn’t retaliate.

As Long Chen flew through the air, he glanced at the primal chaos space. As he saw the piles of treasures inside, his smile was ear to ear.

Within the primal chaos space lay an abundance of immortal metals, not only in their raw ore form but also in the purified essence extracted from them.

After all, the higher the purity of the immortal metal, the greater the produced weapon would be. Due to their limited abilities, Xia Chen and Guo Ran found it exceptionally challenging to refine Saint-level materials to a high purity. They couldn’t guarantee the quality, and the process would result in substantial waste.

However, these immortal metals were already incredibly pure. If Xia Chen and Guo Ran were to see them, they would definitely go crazy.

All of Long Chen’s snatched immortal metals exuded strong fluctuations. In other words, they should be on the level of Saint materials.

Other than the immortal metals, he also pilfered piles of weapons. However, the majority of these weapons were still in their embryonic stages, with some lacking even the basic runes carved onto them.

A few of the weapons had runes inscribed on them, but they lacked spiritual essence, making them essentially half-finished. Xia Chen and Guo Ran could just inscribe runes onto them to turn them into Saint items.

Most importantly, among the loot were over ten Saint-grade items with runes already inscribed on them. They would become powerful Corrupt weapons as soon as they started absorbing resentful spirits.

The Heavenly Corrupt Sect employed a straightforward method to awaken spirituality in their weapons. Practitioners of the Corrupt path cultivated numerous resentful spirits, nurturing them like poison bugs. The spirits would then consume each other until a powerful leader emerged, akin to a king.

After that, a group of kings were piled together, and they were set to devour each other again. The process was repeated over and over again until it produced a terrifying resentful spirit capable of controlling a Saint weapon. The resulting weapon would exude a chilling bloodthirst.

However, a resentful spirit would grow berserk if it didn’t get to kill someone after a while. There was a risk that it might turn on its master and devour them at any moment. As a result, the divine weapons of the Corrupt path could not be left unused for an extended duration.

What delighted Long Chen the most was the discovery of a blood-colored saber amongst the Saint weapon embryos.

The saber measured nine feet in length, with countless fiendish faces carved into its surface. The blade itself was serrated, resembling the teeth of a fiend, and it emitted an icy sharpness capable of freezing one’s soul.

At the bottom of the hilt was a fist-sized golden human skull, with two black gemstones embedded into its eye sockets. These gemstones resembled a pair of deep, sinister eyes watching the world.

This weapon’s form was a bit similar to the Blooddrinker saber that Long Chen had obtained in the Jiuli secret realm. Its body was red like fresh blood, exuding a terrifying pressure.

Also, even though it was just the embryonic form of a Saint weapon, its aura was even more terrifying than an ordinary Saint weapon.

What thrilled Long Chen the most was the weight of the saber. It felt as if each of the fiendish faces carved into it carried the weight of a star. Even with Long Chen’s formidable strength, wielding this saber proved to be quite challenging.

This made Long Chen wonder. Was there some titanic person in the Heavenly Corrupt Sect? Who else could use such a heavy saber?

“Stop! Return that saber! We made that for someone else! Do you know who its master is?!” cried out one of the three Saints in a panic.

Hearing that, Long Chen was startled. So the Heavenly Corrupt Sect refined weapons for others as well. It seemed that their weapon-forging business was quite successful. If they weren’t, no one would come to them for weapons.

“Who cares who it is? As long as it enters Boss Long San’s pocket, it’s Boss Long San’s. Even the king of the heavens can’t take it back,” sneered Long Chen as he ran.

This Saint had to be out of his mind. He wanted to threaten Long Chen? Why would Long Chen feel concerned about such a thing?

“If you take that weapon, the Asura race will hunt you down to the end of the world! You will suffer for eternity!” roared that Saint.

“The Asura race? Never heard of them,” snorted Long Chen.

“That just means that you’re ignorant! If you knew of them, you wouldn’t have dared to touch that sword!”

“Is there anything in this world that Boss Long San doesn’t dare to do? You’re the real ignorant one,” replied Long Chen indifferently.

Long Chen was flying at full speed, maintaining a set distance from those Saints. As their attacks were unable to reach him, he was completely safe.

“Idiot, leave behind that saber! Otherwise-!”

“No need to keep sending me off! We’re here. Everyone, let us meet again!”

Long Chen suddenly stopped on top of a mountain, where a several-foot-wide formation disc illuminated the rocky surface.

“Die!”

Seeing that formation disc, the three Saints roared with fury and launched their attacks.

BOOM! DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

The mountain was instantly crushed, and fragments of the formation disc flew through the air. Yet, Long Chen had vanished, his timing impeccable.

“Fuck!”

The three Saints bellowed in fury, but Long Chen was already too distant to hear their enraged cries.
