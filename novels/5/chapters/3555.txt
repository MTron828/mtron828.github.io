Chapter 3544

BOOM!

The sword slashed down. But with a flicker of lightning, Long Chen dodged just to the side. As a result, the sword fell and struck a fifth Heavenstage Heavenly Flame Spirit.

That Heavenly Flame Spirit roared. Its body was almost cut in two, so all its runes quivered. After that, the wound instantly healed, and it unleashed a palm at its attacker.

Due to the body of that Heavenly Flame Spirit being huge, it struck the Heavenly Flame Spirit beside it. Hence, that one roared in pain and struck back.

In an instant, the entire volcano fell into chaos. These fifth Heavenstage Heavenly Flame Spirits began to attack each other and the humans present, not differentiating between the sides.

On the other hand, the fourth Heavenstage Heavenly Flame Spirits didn’t participate in this chaotic battle. They directly fled in fear.

Amongst the fifth Heavenstage Heavenly Flame Spirits, none was willing to submit to the others. Their energy absorption was interrupted, so they were all enraged. Hence, their killing intent exploded and they crazily attacked everyone around them.

“Where is Long Chen?!”

As the fifth Heavenstage Heavenly Flame Spirits exploded in rage, filling the air with runes and explosions, the attacker dodged left and right but was unable to spot Long Chen’s figure.

“Long Chen, you coward, if you have guts, come out! Your grandpa will go three hundred rounds with you-” Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Pfft!

A heavenly genius ended up struck by a Heavenly Flame Spirit due to roaring at Long Chen. The distraction resulted in him coughing up blood and flying back.

Just as he flew back, a flame spear appeared out of midair, and he smashed right into it. It pierced straight through him.

Everyone was shocked. They then saw Long Chen’s body appear in the air there. He held the flame spear that was still piercing that heavenly genius.

“Three hundred rounds? You couldn’t even last a single exchange. In your next life, first judge your actual power before bragging so loudly,” sneered Long Chen.

With a quiver of the spear, that heavenly genius was blasted into blood mist. Long Chen didn’t give Zhao Mingxuan and the others any chance to save him.

“Young lord!”

In the distance, some experts that were wearing similar robes to that genius cried out in horror. He was their young lord, but he had actually been killed.

Suddenly, the dark red sword in that person’s hand fled to the horizon.

“Want to run?”

Long Chen sneered and waved his hand. The Phoenix Blood Heavenly Silk Net then caught and dragged it into the primal chaos space.

That sword wanted to struggle, but once it was inside the primal chaos space, it instantly went still.

Just then, multiple divine weapons slashed toward Long Chen, shaking Long Chen’s heart. Those were all World Domain divine items. If he was struck by them, he would definitely die.

With a tug of the Phoenix Blood Heavenly Silk Net, a thread wrapped around the tail of a Heavenly Flame Spirit and dragged it over.

BOOM!

Over ten World Domain divine items attacked at once. As a result, the entire volcano exploded and lava spurted out in every direction. Even the fifth Heavenstage Heavenly Flame Spirits were unable to endure. The dozen of them at the core were directly blasted apart without even knowing what just happened.

As for the others, they were sent flying. A giant flaming mushroom cloud soared into the sky, covering the heavens.

This attack was the combined might of over ten heavenly geniuses and over ten World Domain divine items. No one could possibly block it.

Long Chen saw the volcano crumble and sucked in a cold gasp of air. This group of idiots really were powerful. If he had fled slower, he would have lost his life here.

“The Phoenix Blood Heavenly Silk Net is more of a supplementary World Domain divine item. Compared to their World Domain divine items, its pure attack power is lacking quite a bit,” observed Long Chen.

These people’s sects and families actually dared to give them World Domain divine items. That meant that they themselves had at least some ability to protect themselves.

However, the Phoenix Blood Heavenly Silk Net also had its strong points. In a one-against-one, Long Chen wasn’t afraid of any of them. The Phoenix Blood Heavenly Silk Net’s toughness could even constrain two World Domain divine items.

Just then, a huge net descended from the heavens. After dodging their attack, Long Chen flung out the Phoenix Blood Heavenly Silk Net.

“It’s the Phoenix Blood Heavenly Silk Net! Scatter!”

Zhao MIngxuan and the others’ expressions changed when they saw this net. They recognized this divine item, and they retreated.

The Phoenix Blood Heavenly Silk Net fell, but they weren’t caught. The net missed.

“No…”

Suddenly, some of their expressions changed.

The net fell and sucked in all the flame runes remaining at the core of the attack. They formed a dozen spheres of light. Those were the flame essence of the Heavenly Flame Spirits.

“Children, not bad. Next time, if we have the chance, let us continue working together.” Long Chen put away the net with a blessed smile that made Zhao Mingxuan and the others grind their teeth.

“Bastard-!”

Zhao Mingxuan and the others were enraged. Their combined attack had killed so many fifth Heavenstage Heavenly Flame Spirits, but all the benefits were taken away by Long Chen.

Long Chen then transformed into a bolt of lightning after he finished speaking, vanishing in the blink of an eye without leaving a trace. His speed was inconceivable.

Just then, the fifth Heavenstage Heavenly Flame Spirits that had been sent flying by that attack unleashed heaven-shaking roars. They opened their mouths, their runes igniting.

“Run!”

Zhao Mingxuan was shocked. After that, he merged with his divine weapon and pierced through the void, flying away.

The reason they were able to kill so many of those fifth Heavenstage Heavenly Flame Spirits with their combined attack was partially because they had concentrated all their power within it, but it was also because the Heavenly Flame Spirits were not paying much attention to them.

Now all of the Heavenly Flame Spirits were enraged and unleashing full-power attacks at them. They couldn’t block those attacks. If they tried, they would definitely be wiped out.

Long Chen hadn’t flown too far before he saw the scene behind him. Rays of divine light pierced through the void, and heaven and earth collapsed. It was like the apocalypse.

“A group of foolish children.”

Long Chen shook his head. He then flew for over an hour before finding a rather secluded place for him and Huo Linger to enter seclusion.

“Hehe, True Fire Sword. The name is quite ordinary, but it’s actually very powerful.” Only now did Long Chen get a chance to look at his gains.

This new divine weapon was just over three feet long and covered in ancient runes. Flame energy circulated within it. Also, Its sharpness was oppressive. This was definitely a rare divine weapon of the Flame Dao.

“Big brother Long Chen, lend me some Spiritual Strength to absorb these runes,” said Huo Linger.

Huo Linger was capable of absorbing these fifth Heavenstage Heavenly Flame Spirits, but it was a bit taxing. With Long Chen’s cooperation, it would be much easier.

“Haha, good, once this Heavenly Flame essence is refined, you’ll control this True Flame Sword. Then we’ll slay Zhao Mingxuan and the rest of them.”

Long Chen laughed, spending all his energy on helping Huo Linger absorb this Heavenly Flame essence. He was full of expectations for Huo Linger.
