Chapter 2837 The Devil’s Training Begins

That day, Long Chen spent time investigating every person’s body. Their bloodline, their soul, their bones, they were all evaluated by Long Chen.

They were originally a group of geniuses, but that talent had been abandoned and wasted. Long Chen wanted to reactivate that talent, but that would require some ruthless moves.

Long Chen refined specific medicinal liquids for them. As for that ‘poison pill’ he had given each of them to eat before, it was actually a kind of Potential Activating Pill. Furthermore, it was different from the Pill Institute’s Potential Activating Pill. Long Chen had made some changes, allowing it to fully stimulate a person’s potential. This was why Li Cai was able to awaken his power so easily. Everything was still within Long Chen’s calculations.

In order to refine specific medicinal liquids for all thirty-six of them, Long Chen had spent a full day researching. The next day, he tossed them into a valley with three cliffs.

“Instructor Long Chen, did you bring us here for drills? But what kind of drills can be done here?” inquired a disciple.

Long Chen didn’t reply. Instead, he picked on a rock and threw it at a cliff like a meteor. As a result, a giant explosion blasted a hole in the cliffside, causing everyone to jump. Long Chen’s power was truly terrifying.

However, before they even recovered from their shock at Long Chen’s power, countless fist-sized bees began to fly out of the hole that Long Chen had made.

Those bees had a scorpion’s pincers, and the patterns on their bodies were extremely sinister looking.

“Scorpion Bees?” A disciple suddenly cried out when he recognized these creatures. They were extremely terrifying as their pincers, tentacles, and tails were all highly toxic.

However, the curious thing was that when they attacked, only one part of their bodies could be activated. They would then need to rest a bit before attacking with another part of their bodies because the poison at all three spots was different.

If a person was struck by all three poisons, they would instantly die. But if struck by only one or two, they would still be fine.

Unfortunately, they were now facing thousands and thousands of them. If these bees caught up to them, they would definitely be stung until they were covered in holes. After that, they would definitely die. Upon seeing the bees, their newfound bravery vanished like smoke in the wind.

“Their flying speed is fast. At the very least, you won’t be able to outrun them. Hence, if you want to live, you better kill them all. Whether or not you can live will be up to your luck,” said Long Chen.

“Instructor Long Chen! We’ve been wasting away for so many years! We need a gradual process!”

“Who has time to give you a gradual process? Are your opponents going to wait for you? If you want to take back what has been taken from you, you have to pay the price. Or are you still living in your fantasies?” snorted Long Chen.

Just at this moment, the Scorpion Bees flew down upon them, covering the entire sky. They were enraged and immediately started attacking.

Li Cai, as the leader of the group, had to at least act a bit stronger than everyone else. He was the first to raise his sword and strike the Scorpion Bees. “What are you all standing around for? Take out your weapons!”

“Go all-out!” Those disciples clenched their teeth. They had no other choice, so they crazily attacked the Scorpion Bees.

“Ah!”

Screams began to ring out. The Elite Group was submerged by the Scorpion Bees. In just a few breaths’ time, all of them collapsed.

After that, Long Chen tossed out some powder, and those Scorpion Bees instantly retreated.

It was only after two hours that Li Cai and the others woke up. Their whole bodies ached and were itchy.

“Did we die?”

One of those disciples stared blankly around him. However, when he saw Li Cai, he suddenly laughed. Li Cai’s face had swollen from the stinging until it was just like a pig’s face. He almost didn’t recognize him.

However, as soon as he laughed, the corner of his mouth almost tore open, and a sharp pain came from his face. He was no better off than Li Cai. His face had swelled up to its limit.

Everyone slowly woke up. They looked at each other and themselves. The swelling all over their bodies made their hands look like meat buns and their fingers like sausages.

“Are we not dead? I remember I was struck dozens of times. Is my luck so good?” exclaimed one of the disciples.

“Where is instructor Long Chen?” asked one of them. This was no longer the original valley. Long Chen was gone.

BOOM!

Suddenly, an explosion shook the land. It was like a dam had been broken, and then a fiery wave of heat washed over them. A distant mountain had actually erupted.

“What happened?!”

“It’s lava!”

Lava was rapidly flowing toward them. Only then did they realize that they were in a river channel that the lava was flowing down to.

“Run!”

Li Cai shouted. If they were devoured by that lava, they would be instantly incinerated.

Li Cai only took a single step before he collapsed. His numb body was causing his movements to be clumsy. It felt like lead had been poured throughout his body.

“Quick, there are some cliffs up ahead! There’s a vine there! We can climb it and get out!” shouted Li Cai, pointing.

This was a dried-up riverbed. What was up ahead was most likely originally a waterfall. There was a deep hole there with countless veins growing along the cliffside. That was their only chance.

Any path behind them was cut off by the lava. As it approached, everyone ran, rolled, and crawled forward.

“I can’t! Save me! My legs won’t move!” shouted one disciple, crying. His legs were like wooden buckets at this moment, and he couldn’t even feel them. He could only crawl, resulting in him falling to the rear.

“Someone who can walk, help!” Li Cai clenched his teeth and ran over to that disciple. He grabbed one of his hands and pulled him along. However, even after Li Cai shouted, no one else reacted.

Li Cai cursed, “Didn’t instructor Long Chen say that we needed to unite if we want to take back what is ours? Have you forgotten?!”

Quite a few people hesitated. They were disciples from powerful families, and they had seen the dark side of humanity in the fight for power there. They had never done anything to help others, so making them risk their lives to save someone else was truly difficult for them.

“Fuck, if I die, I die.” Another disciple suddenly ran back and grabbed the other disciple’s hand, dragging him along. Then another disciple came back, dragging them.

Seeing this, that disciple being dragged wept from emotion. He had never experienced anyone in his life willing to risk their own lives to help him.

“Quick, quick!”

The lava was slowly getting closer. It wasn’t that far, and the heat rolling off of it terrified them. If the lava devoured them, they wouldn’t even have corpses left.

A distance of just a few miles could be crossed in just a few breaths of time normally. But now it was as difficult as ascending the heavens.

However, when fighting with their lives on the line, people revealed immeasurable potential. When the lava was just a few meters away from them, they finally reached the cliff. They then quickly climbed up, narrowly avoiding the danger.

Just as they were sighing with relief, a person appeared on the top of the cliff. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

“Instructor Long Chen?” The disciples were delighted, thinking that they were saved.

However, Long Chen’s actions made them cry out in horror. The sword in his hand slashed through the vines, sending them tumbling down into the lava.

“Nooo!”
