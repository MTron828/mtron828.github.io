Chapter 3882 Ten Thousand Dragons Roar at Heaven and Earth

When Gu Yang appeared, he was different from the other Dragonblood warriors, and it wasn’t just because of his astonishing Blood Qi. His golden scales all had different runes in them.

Each of his runes was like an erupting volcano, with violent power exploding out of them. Moreover, his power seemed to be limitless, to the extent that his aura even shocked the city lord.

Gu Yang, with just a spear, stopped the city lord, like a mountain blocking the path of a river. Even with the city lord’s mighty aura, he was still shaken by Gu Yang.

Gu Yang’s spear was blocking the city lord’s silver sword. Both of their divine weapons creaked as they fought against each other. As a result, sparks and ripples were spreading in every direction. The clash was so intense that Guo Ran and Xia Chen were stunned. When did Gu Yang become so terrifying? Wielding his spear with one hand, he easily stopped the city lord.

“It seems that Gu Yang ran into his own opportunity during this time!” sighed Xia Chen.

Gu Yang had always been a power fighter. In the Dragonblood Legion, other than Long Chen and Wilde, his power was the greatest.Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Hence, now that he had undergone the baptism of the dragon blood and had condensed a Heavenly Dao Crown, his Dragon Blood Battle Armor far exceeded other people’s.

“Brothers, you’re not suited to solo fights. Leave him to me! Now that the Dragonblood Legion has gathered again, you have more important tasks to do.” Gu Yang turned around and glanced at the two of them, a warm and emotional smile gracing his lips.

Everyone was reunited at last. It seemed like an eternity since their last encounter. They had so much to share, yet so little time to do so. All their profound emotions could only be expressed through meaningful gazes.

“Boss Gu Yang is mighty! We’ll leave this to you!” Guo Ran laughed and flashed him a thumbs-up. Between brothers, there was no need to say so many words. Just a single gaze was enough.

Guo Ran and Xia Chen were in charge of commanding the entire Dragonblood Legion. While Guo Ran served as the general, Xia Chen was the formation master. Their primary strength lay in guiding the Dragonblood Legion’s power, enabling them to unleash their greatest potential.

Hence, engaging in individual combat really wasn’t their forte, so they directly returned to the Dragonblood Legion’s formation. Their objective was to consolidate the Dragonblood Legion's forces and ensure everyone acted as a cohesive unit, tightly bound together like an unyielding rope.

“Do you think you can block me?! Dream on!” The city lord seethed with anger, feeling deeply underestimated. His grip on the sword tightened, causing it to quiver.

BOOM! With an explosive sound, both of them retreated a few steps.

“No, I’m not going to block you, I’m going to kill you. This year, I’ve gone through trials of blood and fire, through pain that others cannot imagine. It was all for today, so that my power would be able to match my status as the first captain of the Dragonblood Legion. Boss often said that even going all-out, you might not see results. But you cannot be discouraged because it just means that the time hasn’t come yet. On the other hand, if you don’t focus on improving yourself because you’re waiting for some opportunity, then you won’t have the power to grasp that opportunity. You’ll only be able to watch as it slips away. That’s why I spent day and night cultivating during this time, to the point that my master couldn’t bear to watch me. My master even thought that I became bedeviled multiple times due to my fanaticism. But I firmly believed that my boss would be right, that my efforts would be repaid. Today, I’ve finally grasped this opportunity and completely transformed. As for you, you are simply the stepping stone to my return as the first captain of the Dragonblood Legion,” said Gu Yang calmly, his gaze fixed upon the city lord. Within his eyes, golden runes were flickering, representing two distinct dragon marks.

“Just keep talking like a madman! Do you think you can stall for time? How absolutely naive!” The city lord didn’t understand what Gu Yang was saying. So, with a cold snort, the two kinds of runes in his manifestation merged together, forming a chain that wrapped itself around his silver moon manifestation.

As two different currents of power merged, the crescent silver moon emitted a blazing light. The city lord’s aura began to slowly rise like the tide. Although it wasn’t rising very quickly, it seemed limitless.

“Everyone, go all-out! Don’t give them any chance to breathe!” shouted the city lord. He once more attacked Gu Yang with his silver sword.

“You’re the naive one. In the Ten Thousand Dragon Devil Nest, I experienced the pain of ten thousand dragons devouring my soul, tempering my spirit. Within the Ten Thousand Dragon Pool, I experienced the pain of ten thousand dragons digging into my heart, tempering my body. I brushed against death multiple times, and all I was lacking was an opportunity. Now, the moment I have been waiting for has arrived. I have not only merged with the essence blood of the immemorial dragon king but also its soul essence and undying will. Today marks my triumphant comeback as the first captain of the Dragonblood Legion, and you merely serve as my first blood. If I fail to kill you, how can I fit to be the Dragonblood Legion’s first captain? How would I have the face to follow my boss?”

Gu Yang’s voice gradually intensified, resonating like a mighty dragon cry echoing throughout the nine heavens, causing countless people to feel their ears ringing and their heads throbbing as if on the verge of splitting open.

“Brothers, I, Gu Yang, have returned! I vow to not let you down anymore! The history of the Martial Heaven Continent shall not repeat itself! I, Gu Yang, finally have the power to block the wind and rain for you!”

Gu Yang’s voice quivered with a mixture of anger and sorrow, reflecting the profound helplessness caused by the devastating losses on the Martial Heaven Continent. The memories of Qu Jianying, the old man, Ling Yunzi, and the other seniors who had fallen one by one weighed heavily on his heart. The sacrifices made by his brothers were killing him inside, akin to a venomous viper sinking its fangs into his very core.

It was this pain that had driven him to cultivate like a madman. It was masochistic, but only by making himself feel pain could he feel a bit of peace. He refused to experience the same sense of powerlessness again. Thus, he forced himself to get stronger with every passing moment. It was now that the fury in his heart finally had a place to be unleashed.

“Ten Thousand Dragons Roar at Heaven and Earth!”

As Gu Yang roared, his manifestation burst into existence. Dragons appeared behind him in a ten thousand dragon diagram. Those ten thousand dragons roared together, their dragon cries resounding throughout every corner of heaven and earth.

His dragon scales trembled with great intensity, each one having a rune grow on it. Upon closer inspection, they appeared to be miniature dragons.

BOOM!

When Gu Yang raised his spear again, an overwhelming tremor shook the world. With unwavering determination, his spear stabbed forward, backed by the roar of ten thousand dragons. At this moment, this spear seemed to come from the depths of hell. The city lord was horrified to find that he was locked down by this terrifying attack.
