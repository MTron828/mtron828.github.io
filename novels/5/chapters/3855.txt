Chapter 3844 Terrifying Seven-Color Supreme Blood

Golden swords filled the air, and they instantly extracted this world’s metal energy. As they tore through the world, their divine light was so harsh that people didn’t dare to look at them directly.

When Long Aotian’s sharp metal qi merged with the metal energy of the world, millions of golden swords formed a golden flood crashing down on Long Chen.

BOOM!

At this moment, astral light lit up on Long Chen’s fist. He directly punched that torrent of golden swords, resulting in golden light filling the world.

Countless golden swords were shattered. However, Long Chen smashed into the wall behind him viciously due to the impact of the golden torrent.

After being blown apart, the golden torrent once more merged and crashed down on Long Chen like a golden dragon.

These golden swords were incredibly sharp. Although Long Chen managed to shatter many of them with one attack, there were too many of them. Many of them passed by his body, leaving many cuts on him. In just an instant, blood dyed his robes.

Long Chen was covered in dragon scales, but he was unable to resist those sharp swords. Although his body had reached a monstrous level of power, he was still injured. From this, it could be seen just how sharp those golden swords were. They were not inferior to World Domain divine items.

Although he was injured, they were no more than superficial wounds. These swords were unable to pose a fatal threat to him. Seeing them coming back at him, Long Chen roared and actually took the initiative to dive into this golden torrent. Astral light exploded out of his fists. With his bare hand, he struck this golden torrent.

Long Chen dove into the flood in order to prevent it from accumulating more momentum. His fists danced along with golden light, and the shattered golden runes dyed the world in a new hue.

Those shattered runes didn’t disappear. Instead, they reformed, becoming sharp swords that once more attacked Long Chen in an endless torrent.

Even then, those golden swords were unable to stop Long Chen. He actually pushed through this golden torrent toward Long Aotian.

Long Aotian smiled sinisterly. Battle intent rose in his eyes. “Long Chen, you must endure. I hope to be able to show you the full power of your seven-color Supreme Blood before your death.”

Suddenly, Long Aotian’s hand seals changed and his manifestation once more changed color. It went from golden to fire-red. Following that, flame runes flew out of his manifestation.

“Flame energy!”

Everyone was shocked. Other than metal energy, Long Aotian also controlled flame energy.

When this flame energy appeared, the world’s flame energy was sucked dry just like its metal energy. A torrent of flames then ignited the world as it charged at Long Chen.

The sharp metal current now had raging flames mixed within it. Seeing this, Long Chen only snorted, and astral winds blew out of his fists. Both these currents were blown apart.

“Again!” shouted Long Aotian.

The next moment, the earth crumbled, and a giant earth pillar soared into the sky toward Long Chen.

BOOM!

Long Chen smashed his fist down. The earth pillar crumbled, but Long Chen was blown into the sky by a terrifying force.

“Earth energy?!”

People were shocked even further. Long Aotian also possessed earth energy? Could it be…?Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

After that, the earth collapsed and vines came flying out like pythons. Long Chen was still in the midst of flying back from the earth pillar, but the vines already weaved into a net around Long Chen, instantly binding him and tightening.

“Break!”

A thunderous roar rang out. After that, those vines exploded, scattering in pieces.

But then, those broken pieces actually took root in the air and once more grew, transforming into even more giant vines that coiled around Long Chen.

“Wood energy!”

Suddenly, the air shook and a rain of light descended from the heavens. That rain was like arrows piercing toward Long Chen.

“How can this be?! How can a person use all five elements at once?!” People cried out in shock. This didn’t make sense.

Metal, wood, water, fire, earth. All five forms of energy weaved through the world. They all attacked Long Chen, but not one of them repulsed the others. Every form of energy was fatal.

Facing them, Long Chen’s fists continued to dance, and his violet qi continued to erupt. He fiercely counterattacked against the five elemental forces.

“Long Chen, do you see? This is the power of your seven-color Supreme Blood. This all should have been yours. Unfortunately, you didn’t have that fate. Who cares about a Double Supreme or even a Triple Supreme? I have not even cultivated my Supreme Blood to its pinnacle, and I already possess the power to destroy heaven and earth. Once my Supreme Bone and Supreme Root fully awaken, all three will merge into one. Who will possibly be a match for me in this world? Unfortunately, you won’t live to see me merge all three and be unrivaled. But that’s fine. I will fully display my Supreme Blood’s power to you. I will show you just how heaven-defying the three things I stole from your body are. To be killed by your own Supreme Blood, isn’t it very ironic? Hahahaha!” Long Aotian raised his head and laughed.

“What is mine will naturally be taken back by myself. Leaving them with you is nothing more than having you look after them. I have to thank you for spending so much time and energy on helping me raise them!” Long Chen continued to fight through the five elemental currents. Although he was covered in blood, his expression was not at all panicked. He was still as calm as water.

“Your mouth is pretty glib. Let me see just how long you can be so tough. The power of seven-color Supreme Blood doesn’t stop here! I’ll let you understand as you die!”

Long Aotian’s hand seals changed once more. Suddenly, the five currents quivered, and they formed giant runes. At first, they were indistinct, but then they merged together to form a giant sphere of light that trapped Long Chen inside.

The five runes flowed around, forming five totemic symbols. Looking more closely, those totems seemed to be the legendary Azure Dragon, White Tiger, Vermilion Bird, Black Tortoise, and Qilin.

When those five totems appeared, the sphere of light quivered and five roars rang out. Those voices seemed to come from ancient times and were filled with murderous killing intent. They made people’s ears hurt and shook their souls.

Because of them, some of the weaker experts of the devil race and Sacred PIll Hall passed out, blood pouring out of their ears.

Even if every person here was a Supreme, in front of this mental pressure, a portion of them were unable to endure it.

As for Long Chen, he was inside the sphere of light. The pressure that he was under was a million times greater. However, his expression was still calm. He just looked at those five totems.

“Rest in peace! Five Spirit Bind!”

A sphere of light suddenly appeared on Long Aotian’s hand as well. It was only an inch wide but shaped the exact same as the one trapping Long Chen. He then clenched his hand.

The light around Long Chen compressed on him, and Long Chen felt space twist violently. Long Aotian was trying to directly crush him.

Long Chen snorted. “You are still as foolish as ever.”

After saying that, he pointed a single finger. A single flame directly touched the Vermilion Bird totem.
