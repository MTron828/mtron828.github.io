Within an ancient city, a giant transportation formation exploded and a blood-colored saber slashed through the air. As a result, a line of buildings was cut in two, the cut as flat and smooth as a mirror. The top parts of the buildings then slowly fell to the ground.

This sudden attack shook the entire ancient city. The next moment, countless experts unleashed their auras and rushed out of the buildings.

When they saw a black-robed youngster holding a blood-colored saber walking through this stronghold of the Soaring Dragon Company, they were all stunned.

Long Chen’s killing intent was soaring. He had shattered the transportation formation behind him, conveniently killing the few World Kings that had followed him. As a result, those World Kings were directly crushed by the spatial energy without having a chance to show themselves.

At this moment, Long Chen’s divine sense spread and he immediately sensed his target. Ignoring these bewildered experts of the Soaring Dragon Company, he whirled his saber and dove into the ground.

In a location deep beneath the earth was a treasury that was covered in runes. There were layers of restrictions here.

Seeing this, Long Chen took out the black dagger and instantly pierced through all those restrictions. He then stabbed the Minghong Saber into that opening.

“Split the Heavens 2!”

An immense power exploded underground, and countless buildings were blown apart, along with countless experts of the Soaring Dragon Company.

The earth exploded. Dust and sand created a giant mushroom cloud, and it rapidly spread, covering the entire city.

“What scoundrel dares to run amok in my Soaring Dragon Company?! Get out of here!” A heaven-shaking roar rang out. At the same time, a dark-faced elder came flying out, his long hair flying like an angry lion.

BOOM!

The next moment, the earth shuddered and a giant square case appeared. The entire case was covered in runes and gave off a heavy air. However, at this moment, the runes on the case were dim.

“Courting death!”

That dark-faced elder was instantly enraged. That was the treasury of the Soaring Dragon Company, and it was filled with countless treasures.

BOOM!

A saber-image soared, forcing back that dark-faced elder.

Long Chen’s figure then appeared in the sky. There was now a palm-sized crystalline piece of jade in his hand with a snowflake seal on it.

The snowflake was pure and beautiful. It didn’t give off an aura, but Long Chen could sense an energy concealed within, power that could destroy heaven and earth.

“I’ve finally obtained it.”

When Long Chen used the black dagger to cut open the treasury, he immediately noticed it. Fortunately, this jade was in the treasury and not in the hands of that dark-faced elder.

He lightly rubbed this Ice Soul Divine Jade. He didn’t feel much joy though. Whenever he thought of Bai Fang and Bai Rui, he felt sad. The Ice Soul Divine Jade might be a priceless treasure, but to Long Chen, its value didn’t exceed the value of their lives.

If he could, he would destroy this Ice Soul Divine Jade for their lives. Regretfully, such a thing was impossible in this world.

At this moment, an iron fist smashed toward Long Chen’s head. In return, Long Chen’s Minghong Saber slashed through the air. When they collided, sparks flew and Long Chen’s arm shuddered. He was blown back by that punch.

Also, hundreds of experts had appeared, the majority being World Kings. However, only four were wearing the robes of the Soaring Dragon Company. The rest didn’t seem to belong to the Soaring Dragon Company.

That dark-faced elder put on battle armor with runes flowing on top of it. After that, the divine might of a World King crashed down, making even breathing difficult.

Long Chen put away the Ice Soul Divine Jade. Just before that, he had also put away the treasury of the entire Soaring Dragon Company. That was why this elder was so furious.

“You dare to steal my Soaring Dragon Company’s treasures?! You have guts! Speak, who are you!” barked that dark-faced elder.

Only then did Long Chen take note that this place was a giant prefecture city, and the Soaring Dragon Company only occupied a corner of the city. Also, countless experts were coming out from the various large buildings, looking over in shock. They had no idea what was going on.

“Who I am isn’t important. What’s important is that we’re of the same profession,” replied Long Chen coldly.

“Same profession? You’re from the Huayun Trading Company?!” That dark-faced elder’s expression changed and so did his tone.

“No, I’m not from the Huayun Trading Company.” Long Chen shook his head.

“Then who are you?!” shouted the elder.

“The Violet Flame Heaven has eight trading companies, with the Huayun Trading Company and the Soaring Dragon Company being the largest. The rest are secondary. I said that I’m not from the Huayun Trading Company, but you didn’t ask about the other trading companies. It seems that the seven of you are all allied. So it seems that the only company that can act fairly is the Huayun Trading Company. But when all other businessmen are dirty, being clean is a kind of sin. No wonder you are targeting the Huayun Trading Company so badly,” sneered Long Chen.

Long Chen had killed so many World Kings of the Soaring Dragon Company. Although he couldn’t do soulsearches, he could at least see a bit in the fragments of their souls.

In those soul fragments, he saw many dirty acts. These people had created a reputation for their integrity while doing countless vile acts behind people’s backs. That was why Long Chen had directly been so vicious when he arrived.

“You say that you aren’t from the Huayun Trading Company, but you’re always speaking up for them. As I see it, you are definitely from the Huayun Trading Company!” shouted a World King.

“Are you helping a dog eat shit?” Long Chen eyed that speaker. It wasn’t someone from the Soaring Dragon Company. But by standing here, they were clearly standing on the same side.

“I said that we’re of the same profession because we’re all robbers. Your Soaring Dragon Company robs people secretly, while I, Boss Long San, do it openly. In terms of technique, you’re greater. But in terms of efficiency, I’m much better. You murder and rob people while scheming and fighting against each other, but I do it much more simply,” said Long Chen lightly.

“Don’t waste words on him! Capture him! Once we torture him, I refuse to believe that he won’t say who sent him!”

That World King had just finished speaking when Long Chen silently appeared in front of him. After that, Long Chen grabbed his neck just like that. Everyone was shocked. Long Chen’s movement art was too fast and bizarre. He moved without the slightest warning.

By the time the thought of going to save their ally formed in their heads, it was already too late. No one had expected Long Chen to suddenly attack. They had actually thought that he was waiting for further reinforcements or perhaps preparing to crush a transportation talisman to escape. Hence, their main focus was on the surrounding spatial fluctuations.

However, in just the blink of an eye, that arrogant World King was caught in Long Chen’s hands. He quivered with fear, and the smell of urine filled the air. This World King was actually so scared that he lost control over his bladder.

“You don’t have any other abilities other than crapping and helping other dogs eat crap. If you’re willing to eat back your own crap, I’ll spare your life,” said Long Chen coldly.

“I… I’ll eat…” What no one had expected was for this World King to be so terrified that he actually agreed.
