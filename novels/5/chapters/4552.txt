Chapter 4541 When it Rains, it Pours

When Long Chen flew out of the coffin, he found that the intense rumbling came from the bow of the ship. Worried about Feng You, he didn’t bother with the lifeform in the coffin anymore and immediately rushed off.

When he got there, he saw Feng You surrounded by golden light, akin to flames burning around her. As for the corpse that Feng You called ancestor, it had turned into a pile of dust.

The pile of dust still had specks of divine light within it. It then condensed into runes and flew toward her.

All of a sudden, Feng You spat out blood, and a crack appeared on her forehead.

“Not good!” Long Chen rushed forward and pressed a hand on her back. His own Blood Qi erupted as he helped her restrain and absorb those runes.

Feng You’s ancestor had too many powerful runes in its corpse. Long Chen didn’t know whether it had gone dumb after not using its head for a while or if it simply didn’t care about Feng You’s survival, but it had fully stuffed all of those runes into Feng You. They were more than enough to kill her.

Perhaps having been dead for too long, Feng You’s ancestor didn’t possess the ability to think of such a thing. It only instinctively transmitted its full legacy to Feng You.

Millions of volcanoes seemed to explode inside Feng You. If it weren’t for Long Chen’s dragon blood power suppressing it, she would have turned to dust.

Her ancestor’s runes were not something she could digest yet, so she could only seal them for now and comprehend them at a later date.

Unfortunately, she had lost consciousness, so Long Chen had to help her absorb all the runes. By the time Long Chen secured the final rune, he was drenched in sweat, having overdrafted his dragon blood power to wrestle control over those runes. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

After resting for a bit, Long Chen carried Feng You and jumped off the Ghost Ship. Those Yin Soldiers were still woodenly advancing, completely ignoring them.

When they descended the Ghost Ship, the surroundings had changed. They found themselves in a wasteland, where sand and dust billowed with every step the Yin Soldiers took, casting a hazy atmosphere over the area.

Long Chen immediately distanced himself from the Yin Soldiers. Although he wasn’t afraid of their aura of decay, it still made him uncomfortable.

It was like being underwater. Eventually, someone would drown, so they had to leave the water in order to breathe.

“Stop right there!”

Just as Long Chen escaped the haze created by the Yin Soldiers, a cold shout echoed, and Long Chen sensed a silent arrow hurtling toward his back.

The shout originated from the front, but the arrow came from the rear. So, if the shout drew Long Chen’s attention, he wouldn’t be able to dodge the arrow.

The impact sent sparks flying around, accompanied by an explosion that caused Long Chen to stagger forward, nearly falling to the ground.

Long Chen was enraged. He hadn’t expected someone to sneak attack him here. It seemed that being on the Ghost Ship for too long had dulled his senses, causing him to react too late. Fortunately, the arrow had struck the blood-colored saber behind him.

The silent arrow was powerful. Without the saber’s protection, it would have pierced Long Chen’s powerful physical body.

As Long Chen assessed the situation, he spotted a winged man wielding a white bone bow. The arrow had indeed come from him, and the individual appeared equally shocked by the turn of events.

As an expert amongst experts, this winged man knew that his arrow should have been lethal. Even if Long Chen had a divine weapon that could block it, the sheer impact alone should have shattered his insides.

“Feather race[1]?”

Seeing those wings and sensing the familiar aura, along with the ephemeral archery techniques, Long Chen instantly recognized this person’s background, and killing intent erupted within his eyes.

“Stop right there, or I’ll kill you!” the Feather race expert shouted, and at the same time, one figure after another came flying out of the dust storm. To Long Chen’s surprise, millions of the Feather race’s experts had gathered here.

All of them were pointing their arrows at Long Chen, waiting for that person’s order to turn Long Chen into a pincushion.

“Fuck, what kind of bad luck is this?!” Long Chen was enraged. It was evident that they had been hiding from the Yin Soldiers the entire time, but he just had to run into them like this. Likewise, they could also tell that Long Chen had come from the Ghost Ship, so they wanted to stop him.

“If you don’t want to die, then scram!” roared Long Chen.

“Courting death!”

Their leader was enraged as no one had ever dared to speak to him this way. The next moment, an arrow came flying off of his bow.

He was incredibly fast to the point that it was almost impossible to see how he nocked his arrow before it was already right in front of Long Chen.

This time, Long Chen was prepared. Holding Feng You in one hand, he swung his saber with the other.

BOOM!

Long Chen’s arm shuddered, and blood dripped down it. He couldn’t help being startled.

“My power’s dropped too much! It’s definitely related to the Ghost Ship.” To his surprise, something had silently stripped his power away without him even being aware of it.

In his embrace, Feng You spat out blood, and it stuck to his chest and neck. In her incredibly weak state, the previous blow had partially reached her, and even though it was only the tiniest bit, it still injured her.

“Surrender and I’ll spare your life! Otherwise, don’t blame this young master for being ruthless!” shouted the Feather expert. He was in no rush to keep attacking and would rather capture both of them alive.

“Don’t fight with them... I can help you block one attack. Just run.” At this moment, Feng You woke up, and even in her weak state, she still offered to help Long Chen.

Long Chen’s fury ignited like a blazing inferno. If he didn’t have to look after Feng You, even in his current state, he would have unleashed a slaughter. At the very least, he would have taken down half of them to send a clear message that Boss Long San was not to be trifled with.

However, with Feng You injured and unable to fight, Long Chen restrained himself. Looking at their leader, he said, “Little bird, just you wait. If I don’t break your legs and stick them up your butt, I won’t be Boss Long San.”

Suddenly, Long Chen’s Kunpeng wings appeared on his back, and he shot out like a streak of lightning.

“Courting death!” That Feather expert was enraged. How dared someone run in front of him? They were simply asking for it.

With a swift motion, he unleashed another arrow. This time, the arrow soared through the air in a peculiar arc, disappearing into the void.

In response, Long Chen spun in a strange manner, and that arrow narrowly missed him, flying past by his side

“What?!”

The Feather expert was taken aback, not knowing that Long Chen also knew archery techniques. While Long Chen couldn’t use many high-level techniques, it didn’t mean he didn’t know how to dodge them.

“Kill them!”

Long Chen was simply too fast, not allowing him to shoot a second arrow.

Following his order, a torrent of arrows shout out. However, at this time, a golden shield materialized, adorned with an ancient phoenix design that came to life. The phoenix spread its wings and soared off the shield.

BOOM!

The golden phoenix exploded in a burst of divine light, illuminating the surroundings. By the time the Feather race’s experts rushed to the scene, Long Chen and Feng You had vanished without a trace.

1. The immortal world’s Feather race is similar to the Martial Heaven Continent’s ancient races. The Feather race are the descendants of the flying bird races and the human race(from Chapter 3315) Kun Wu and Kun Pengzi’s people ?
