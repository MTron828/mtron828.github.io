Chapter 2875 Trial

The first grade trial hall was rarely activated in the God Institute. It had been decades since the last time.

Only extremely important trials were conducted here. And in order to hold a trial here, the head judge and the other two magistrates must attend.

Furthermore, the first grade trial hall was not just open to the God Institute but also to anyone within the High Firmament Academy. They could all watch justice be carried out.

At this moment, Luo Bing, Luo Ning, Mu Qingyun, and the others all arrived with Long Chen. They instantly felt a harsh and solemn air pour over them.

Looking from outside, the first grade trial hall looked to only be a few hundred meters wide. But upon entering, it was a giant space. As soon as they entered, they saw two sacred statues.

The two statues were thousands of meters tall. They were two dignified elders. One held a book, while the other held a ruler. The ruler had a scale carved into it, and it emitted a sharp air that gave people chills.

Both the book and ruler were covered in countless runes, and every rune was like a mirror that reflected the wickedness inside a person’s heart. As soon as they entered this place, the Unfettered Alliance’s disciples grew pale. They found it difficult to breathe here.

Luo Bing, Luo Ning, and Mu Qingyun were a bit better off. They only felt a bit of pressure. As for Zhong Ling and Zhong Xiu, they seemed to not feel anything. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

Looking at Li Cai covered in sweat, Long Chen cursed, “Just look at your morality. With just a glance, it’s clear that you’ve done quite a few shameful things.”

These two statues possessed the power to question the inner heart. Even before those runes were fully activated, they possessed this power. If they were activated, it would be very difficult for anyone to lie in front of them.

“Boss San, have you never done anything bad?” Li Cai couldn’t help asking when he saw Long Chen was completely at ease.

“I’ve done plenty of bad things,” said Long Chen indifferently.

“Then boss San, how can you resist the pressure of the divine statues? Can you teach us? Otherwise, I’m afraid…” Li Cai and the others were all uneasy. These two statues were like heavenly executioners. Once the questioning started, they were afraid that every bad thing that they had ever done since their childhood would be exposed.

“I’ve already told you, if you’re going to do bad things, just don’t make it go against your own morals. Doing bad things isn’t bad. As long as you don’t do them to good people, it’s fine. That’s why I’ve done countless bad things, but my heart is still at peace,” said Long Chen.

“Damn!” Long Chen’s heart suddenly shuddered. When he walked into the center of the hall, the space around him changed, and he saw tens of thousands of people sitting there. There was a sea of people. Furthermore, all of these people had high status in the academy. Otherwise, they wouldn’t be qualified to be here.

Those tens of thousands of people were all silent. The only sound was Long Chen and the others’ footsteps.

Li Cai and the others were all pale. They had never experienced such a thing. Every single person watching was a giant figure to them. In fact, some disciples could spend years in the academy cultivating without having a chance to meet a single one of them.

Li Cai suddenly felt like his legs were no longer his own. He forgot how to walk.

Long Chen clapped him on the back of his head and cursed, “Are you getting a seizure? What are you doing? If the heavens collapse, I will hold them up. What are you so nervous about? Don’t you dare tell others in the future that I taught you or I’ll be ashamed.”

Only once he spoke did he realize that this place had a special formation to transmit his voice throughout the crowd. Everyone heard him.

The surrounding people stared at him, dumbfounded. Even in such a grave setting, Long Chen was still so unrestrained. The rumors they had heard about him seemed accurate.

However, some of them also felt a new level of respect for him. This trial room didn’t just have the divine statues with the ability to question a person’s heart, but there were also so many experts staring at them. An ordinary person couldn’t remain as calm as Long Chen.

Li Cai and the others finally relaxed when they arrived at their own seats at the center. They could finally sit.

Only Long Chen, the main character, walked straight forward to the end. Being at the front, he saw three eye-catching positions.

The center position was the largest, most imposing one. He sat down there. But as soon as he did, the deathly silent room erupted.

“Long Chen… that’s not our seat!”

Luo Bing waved at Long Chen. She had actually gestured to him about where to go, but he hadn’t paid any attention to it.

“Oh?”

Before Long Chen even had a chance to stand, three beams of light appeared. A white-robed elder then showed up in each of the chairs beside him.

After that, in front of him appeared the head judge. He stared at Long Chen oddly.

“Oh, I’m sorry.” Only then did Long Chen come to a realization that he might be in the wrong spot. He got up and ran over to Luo Bing’s side.

“You really are a fool! Are you trying to fight over the position of the head judge?!” Luo Ning stared at him speechlessly. This fellow was completely undependable. If they ended up offending the head judge, they would truly be doomed.

“Can you blame me? It’s not like their names are written on them,” grumble Long Chen. As the plaintiff, wouldn’t it make sense for his seat to be different?

“Are you a pig? That seat is so high and wide. Is your butt that big? Even if you used your foot to think, wouldn’t it be obvious that that’s not our spot?!” demanded Luo Ning.

“Are you saying that whoever butt’s bigger has a bigger say in the academy? Then according to your logic, the great dean will definitely be even wider, so wide that he might not even fit through the door-” scoffed Long Chen.

Even before he was done speaking, Luo Bing covered his mouth. Despite being a refined woman, she had an urge to sew Long Chen’s mouth up.

The two of them had actually forgotten that everything they were saying during their argument was being transmitted clearly to everyone’s ears. Long Chen had actually even drawn the dean into it. That was practically an insult to the dean.

The onlookers were turned into wooden puppets by Long Chen’s words. This little fellow truly had guts. He even dared to talk nonsense about the dean?

The head judge’s expression also grew odd and then casually glanced at an unremarkable spot. After that, his face grew severe. “If you dare to spout nonsense in the trial hall, you will be expelled from the academy.”

Long Chen was immediately at ease to hear that. He was grateful to him inside. The head judge was going to brush this matter away.

“Hold it. Long Chen insulted the dean. He has damaged the prestige of the High Firmament Academy. According to the rules, he needs at least fifty lashes of the fire whip. Head judge, are you being biased?” shouted one of the magistrates to the side. He was an elder with a large scar on his face.

Long Chen narrowed his eyes, instantly guessing that this old fellow was part of the Chu family’s people. He also understood why the head judge would cause such a giant ruckus over this matter. Thinking of that, he smiled. It seemed that a good show was about to start.
