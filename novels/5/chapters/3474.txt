Chapter 3463 Enpuda’s Scheme

Countless figures appeared in all directions. These were all black-robed, masked experts whose cultivation bases couldn’t even be sensed.

They were like soul-stealers from hell. At this moment, pairs of emotionless eyes eyed people’s necks. It felt as if some daggers might cut through their throats at any given time.

These people were all assassins. Although they all wore black robes, there were different marks on their sleeves and collars. One was the Blood character, and the other was the Underworld character. They were respectively from the Nine Underworld Hall and the Bloodkill Hall.

With Long Chen’s sharp spiritual perception, he could sense that these people were all Immortal King assassins. There were hundreds of thousands of them.

Assassins possessed immense killing power that could kill across realms. They were all fiends lying in the shadows, specialized at launching fatal attacks while people weren’t on guard. On the battlefield, it would be better to fight World Kings than have them play hide and seek.

“Long Chen, you’re still too tender. Last time, something unexpected let you run. But this time, no accidents will occur. Everyone here will die.” Enpuda smiled at Long Chen sinisterly from far away.

“Damn fatty, you’re getting happy too soon. How do you know that I don’t have other trump cards? Speaking of which, I heard that you tried to cause trouble for Mo Nian. Ah, I suppose you don’t know that the fellow who helped me last time is called Mo Nian. He sent me some news that he managed to slap you in the face! Is that true?” asked Long Chen.

He was trying to conveniently get some information on Mo Nian’s whereabouts. If he asked directly, Enpuda naturally wouldn’t reply, so Long Chen was hoping to con him.

However, what Long Chen hadn’t expected was for Enpuda’s expression to twist angrily. Killing intent blazed in his eyes. “I will make that fellow die a miserable death sooner or later. Unfortunately, you won’t get to see it.”

Long Chen was shocked and stared at Enpuda in disbelief. “He really did slap you in the face?”

Just how smart was Enpuda? Seeing Long Chen’s expression, he knew that Long Chen had conned him. Hence, he was infuriated.

Just then, a huge spatial portal appeared in the giant hole of the void. Nether Qi poured out of it.

Enpuda suppressed his fury and smiled. “Long Chen, you really are a bit smart. You actually activated your grand formations ahead of time to block my killing blow. Regretfully for you, I, Enpuda, never do anything that I am not assured of. I know just how difficult you are to deal with. Thus, I made more preparations. Just in case you blocked my first attack, the second attack would pierce the wall between worlds, creating a channel to the Netherworld. Although you might have been gathering the corpses, afraid that I would gather their blood soul energy, you are wrong. I didn’t want their blood soul energy; I only wanted their devil qi. Once they die, their devil qi is still absorbed. So, gathering the corpses is a meaningless effort. If it weren’t for the fact that our formation is unable to attack multiple times in a row, I wouldn’t even bother to have senior brother Jia Luo come out.”

“Because you are afraid that Bai Zhantang can block your attack?” asked Long Chen coldly.

“Correct. His Ghost Dao Possession is truly monstrous. In that state, he has an undying body and truly has the ability to block this attack. Thus, in order to prevent any accidents, senior brother Jia Luo drew him out just to prevent him from stopping this attack. Our goal isn’t just to destroy your seventh branch academy. We will also give this Vile Dragon Domain to a tribe of the Netherworld, and this place will quickly become filled with Nether Qi. Having activated its supreme defenses, your foundation stone is no longer stable. It will gradually be corroded by the Netherworld’s aura. In just a day, it will rot. In other words, tomorrow, you and your seventh branch academy will forever vanish from this world,” explained Enpuda calmly.

Hearing his words, everyone felt ice-cold. Enpuda was truly sinister. He was going to make sure that the seventh branch academy never managed to rise again.

“What a great plan. Before this, you used an ancient corpse to draw over the Devil Eye Water Lily race, using them as a dog watching over this territory. Now, you're using the Netherworld’s experts to be your fighters. I really admire you. Lord Brahma truly has amazing abilities. He has all kinds of connections,” said Long Chen lightly.

“Brat, you are courting death! You dare to blaspheme Lord Brahma?!”

Just then, the skinny black-robed elder beside Enpuda shouted.

“So you must be the master of the Nine Underworld Hall. Old fellow, sooner or later I will definitely turn your head into a kick ball,” declared Long Chen coldly.

This person was precisely the master of the Nine Underworld Hall, Liao Bencang. Just hearing Long Chen and Enpuda’s conversation had made him impatient. Hence, as soon as Long Chen mentioned Lord Brahma, he immediately berated him.

However, Long Chen’s provocation made Liao Bencang frown darkly. His killing intent erupted. Just as the rumors said, the master of the Nine Underworld Hall had an explosive temper.

Enpuda quickly stepped forward and said, “Long Chen, I’ll give you a chance. If you swear to follow Divine Venerate Brahma, we can spare your life. In fact, we can even spare everyone here.”

“Have you gone crazy?!”

Liao Bencang was enraged. His goal was to destroy the seventh branch academy and kill everyone here. But Enpuda actually said that he would let off everyone? Furthermore, he hadn’t discussed this with Liao Bencang beforehand. This was a kind of provocation toward him.

Enpuda ignored Liao Bencang and looked only at Long Chen, waiting for his reply.VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

Long Chen smiled. “Enpuda, your scheming really is refined. It was due to your miscalculation that I could reclaim the seventh branch academy. Even if you destroy the seventh branch academy now, it will still draw Lord Brahma’s ire. But if you could pull me to his side, it wouldn’t just be a slap in the face to the High Firmament Academy. The academy’s morale would plummet, and you would have a brilliant counterattack. What a nice idea.”

Just as Long Chen said, if he surrendered, the impact on the High Firmament Academy would be huge. That was because Long Chen was claimed to be the strongest new talent in the High Firmament Academy’s history. Also, he was the youngest dean ever. He had countless titles and honors to him. This was why he was viewed as the High Firmament Academy’s hope for the future.

If he, Long Chen, were to surrender to Lord Brahma, it would be a fatal blow to the High Firmament Academy. It went without saying that Enpuda’s scheming was profound.

Unfortunately, Enpuda didn’t know that the High Firmament Academy absolutely refused to believe that Long Chen would ever join Lord Brahma. That was because he was a nine star heir.

When Long Chen said this, the enraged Liao Bencang calmed down slightly. But right after that, his expression twisted with fury once more.

That was because he hadn’t thought that far, but Enpuda had not discussed it with him anyway. It was essentially treating him like a fool.

“Luocha, kill him!”

Liao Bencang suddenly roared. Hearing that, Enpuda was incensed. But before he could say anything, a ripple appeared in the space behind Long Chen, and a dagger silently stabbed toward the back of his neck.
