Chapter 3368 The Valiant Longbow Race

Long Chen received the bow. In his hand, the wood seemed to come to life, and the marks on top of the wood flowed on top of it like water.

Long Chen had no idea what kind of technique Changgong Hao had used to unleash the maximum potential of the Wood Foundation Divine Tree. As for the bowstring, it was actually made with the fibers of the Wood Foundation Divine Tree’s bark. Its strength exceeded Long Chen’s expectations.

Long Chen hadn’t expected the Wood Foundation Divine Trees to have so many uses. Every part of this tree was turned into priceless treasures in the hands of the Longbow race.

Moreover, the bow felt incredibly heavy in his hand. When Long Chen pulled the bowstring, the wooden marks on the bow instantly lit up. He was unable to fully draw the longbow.

“Good bow!”

Long Chen couldn’t help praising this bow. He stored up power to try drawing it again.

As a result, the bow buzzed and veins popped on Long Chen’s arms. It actually required ninety percent of his max power just to draw the bow. Furthermore, his arms were quivering. There was no way he could shoot accurately in this state.

“What brute power!” Changgong Hao was shocked by Long Chen’s physical power. For him to be able to draw the bow relying purely on brute power was beyond expectations.

“This bow’s power might not be able to reach the level of a King item, but it’s not much worse. The Longbow race’s name is not only for show,” praised Long Chen.

A piece of wood had actually been turned into such a terrifying weapon at their hands. The world was truly large and filled with marvels.

“Boss Long San, try and shoot an arrow.” Changgong Huo handed Long Chen an arrow.

Nocking the arrow, he unleashed the full power of his divine flames. The bow instantly became like a crescent moon.

The bowstring buzzed. With a light sound, the arrow vanished.

BOOM!

Suddenly, a broken flagpole on a mound ten thousand miles away was pierced by the arrow.

That flagpole had the thickness of an arm and was made of the finest metal of the Netherworld. It was incredibly tough. There were many of them on that mound. They were left behind by their enemies, and Changgong Hao had actually decided to use that place as a shooting range.

“What a beautiful curved arrow.” Changgong Hao praised Long Chen. None of Long Chen’s power had been wasted in that shot. Even amongst members of the Longbow race, those who could shoot such a perfect curved arrow were considered peak experts.

Just by looking at Long Chen’s palms, he knew that Long Chen wasn’t an archer specialist. Hence, he couldn’t help feeling admiration and shock when he saw that Long Chen was capable of shooting so accurately.

He had originally just come to thank Long Chen for his divine wood, allowing them to show their power and use. Of course, he also wanted to show everyone that it was not a mistake for Leng Yueyan to take in their Longbow race. The reason he had asked Long Chen to try the bow first was to show them all the quality of his craftsmanship and also his own terrifying archery arts afterward. But he hadn’t expected Long Chen to also be an expert archer.

Shooting that target directly wasn’t difficult, but Long Chen had clearly shot in a different direction, only for the arrow to arc toward the flagpole afterward. Furthermore, not one bit of the arrow’s power leaked as it flew through the air. For the arrow to pierce the flagpole without knocking it down showed the power of the bow, arrow, and archer. Even Leng Yueyan was moved.

“Your bow-making technique is truly admirable. The Wood Foundation Divine Trees went from trash to treasure in your hands,” said Long Chen.

The only regretful thing was that the runes of this longbow were from Netherworld. They were made in accordance with the Netherworld’s laws, so they weren’t suitable for the immortal world. Otherwise, Long Chen could have the Longbow race make a few ten thousand of these amazing bows and raise an army of archers.

Regretfully, there was no way for that dream to come true. But this also gave Long Chen a sense of alarm. Even the Netherworld had experts like this, so the immortal world definitely had countless amazing existences as well. He would have to be more careful in the future.

“Boss Long San, you’re too courteous. I haven’t turned trash into treasure. It was simply a treasure from the start, and I merely revised it a bit. This longbow was made by extracting the core of the divine wood. It came from the strongest part. So, every piece of wood you gave us was enough to make nine such bows. Right now, we have one hundred and thirty-six of them. If the Longbow race uses these divine bows, we can essentially ignore the protective qi of an Earth tier Nether King. Unless it is someone like Tuo Ming wearing King item armor, a single arrow can disperse a person’s Nether Qi for at least a breath’s time. That’s enough for us to shoot the target full of holes,” said Changgong Hao confidently.

Changgong Hao took out a bow identical to the one that Long Chen held. The bow instantly bent like a crescent moon, and the marks on his arms lit up. He seemed to become one with the bow.

BOOM!

A mountain at the very edge of their vision crumbled, and seven mountain peaks in front of it were pierced. His power was also perfectly concentrated. His arrow had pierced a tiny smooth hole in the seven mountain peaks before exploding on the eighth mountain.

This one attack displayed his shocking control. The bow and arrow were like a part of his body.

Furthermore, Long Chen also noted that the arrow had pierced through the seven mountain peaks at different speeds. In other words, even after the arrow left the bow, it was still under his control.

That was not just a question of technique; it was an innate bloodline ability. This was something others couldn’t learn no matter what.Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

“Excellent. It’s finally the turn of your Longbow race to be the main character. When the battle starts, I’m looking forward to your display. Once you establish your merit, I will naturally reward you.” Leng Yueyan was also moved. That one arrow was truly powerful. Changgong Hao was an Earth tier Nether King, but this attack could even threaten a Heaven tier Nether King.

“Divine master, let me just say it again. If it weren’t for you taking pity on us, my Longbow race would have long since been destroyed. Your favor is something that we will never forget. I didn’t come for credit or to be dazzling. I simply want to show you that with these arrows, anyone who wants to touch a single hair on your head must walk over our corpses first!” Changgong Hao knelt to Leng Yueyan once more, his voice firm and confident.

In order to make him even more confident, Long Chen tossed out over eighty wooden pillars. Those were just the branches of the Wood Foundation Divine Trees. As long as Long Chen tossed in more corpses, they would easily regrow.

Seeing so many of these wood pillars, let alone Changgong Hao, even Leng Yueyan was dumbfounded. Such a treasure was being tossed out by Long Chen like it was trash.

Changgong Hao was so moved that he wanted to cry. He repeatedly thanked Long Chen. After repeated kowtows, he left with the wood.

Watching as he left, Long Chen grinned. This guy was quite the character. Just as he was about to say something, a pair of hands warmly wrapped around him from behind.
