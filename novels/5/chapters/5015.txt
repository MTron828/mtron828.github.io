Chapter 5004 Ye Lingkong


“You…!”

The elder quivered with rage. As someone from the Ye clan, he wanted to stand up for his clan. However, Long Chen didn’t give him any chance to do so.

Just how sharp was Long Chen? He could instantly tell what this elder was up to.

Most likely, the elder was planning on using the rules of the competition to suppress Long Chen. Long Chen had never gone through the rule book, so he would definitely be at a disadvantage if he engaged with that elder on that front.

At this moment, a referee from the Zhao clan stood up. “As the head umpire, how can you abuse your power?!”

“You have two eyes. Tell me, when did I abuse my power? That was clearly a conflict between the Ye clan and the mercenaries. As the head umpire, I have the right to authorize a match between them to resolve their enmity, creating a more cheerful and harmonious atmosphere. Please tell me what’s wrong with that?” countered Long Chen.

The Zhao clan’s referee was left speechless. When it came to a battle of tongues, Long Chen had never feared anyone. Well… he had suffered a bit against Long Tianrui.

“What nonsense. Where is the cheerful atmosphere?! Where is the harmony?!” retorted the Ye clan referee.

“Do you not see how happy the mercenaries are?” asked Long Chen.

“They’re happy, but do you not care about the others?! Is that not an abuse of power?!” shouted the Ye clan referee.

“Didn’t I give them a chance as well? Actually, I gave them two chances, but they failed to grasp them. If they were beaten up like dogs, what does that have to do with me? Even if there was an abuse of power, it was biased toward your Ye clan, wasn’t it? After all, which martial competition gives people a second try? If you aren’t grateful, that would be one thing. But how could you slander someone? How malicious!” replied Long Chen.

At this moment, stronger experts started arriving. Due to their strength, they had reserved seats that no one dared to contest. Thus, they didn’t need to get here so early.

However, when they saw Long Chen in the seat of the head umpire, they were all stunned. However, their shock quickly turned to indignation. How could a mere disciple be in the seat of the head umpire?

As powerful heavenly geniuses, they expected at least a Heaven Vein expert to oversee their battles. In their minds, having someone with the same cultivation base as them as the head umpire showed that they were not being treated according to their status. It was an insult.

“How could a young disciple be the head umpire?! Has the Long clan gone crazy?!”

“If he is the head umpire, I refuse to participate in this competition! What kind of garbage competition is this? Is this a children’s game?!”

“Get a new head umpire! Are you messing with us?!”

A group of people started shouting, and the other disciples followed their lead, demanding Long Chen step down.

“Keep shouting. Go ahead. Shout until your throats break. If you have the ability, you can force the Long clan to remove me from my position!” taunted Long Chen.

In any case, he had obtained the medicinal ingredients. Other than what was happening with the Earth Cauldron, he was done here. He had gotten what he should and also what he shouldn’t. The position as the head umpire didn’t really attract him.

As the crowd roared crazily, Long Chen looked at his fingernails on his head umpire seat. His casual appearance was particularly enraging to these disciples.

Suddenly, someone spotted Long Ziwei and the others amongst the mercenaries, and a sinister glint appeared in their eyes. One of them stepped forward and waved his hands, causing everyone else to gradually fall silent.

This man wore the robes of the Ye clan. His hair was cropped short, and his short facial hair was like steel needles. Tall and exuding powerful Blood Qi, he resembled a beast in human form.

Standing there, he radiated powerful Doyen power that stunned the surrounding experts. He was a true Heavenly Chosen.

“It’s Ye Lingkong!”

“One of the Ye clan’s peak heavenly geniuses has actually come to watch this competition!”

“Wow, there’ll be a good show to watch this time. He’s one of the Ye clan’s peak experts! It’s said that his power can rank in the top five!”

“That’s not all. I heard that he hasn’t fought anyone publicly in a long time. He’s been hiding his power!”

“Is he planning on challenging Long Chen? If Long Chen faced him, that really would be a good show.”

Countless people were excited when they saw Ye Lingkong step forward. They hoped to see a battle between two heavenly geniuses, eagerly anticipating that Ye Lingkong would beat Long Chen, who was truly irritating in their eyes.

Ye Lingkong waved his hand again, and everyone fell silent. He was greatly satisfied by this. Just as he was about to speak, some surprised shouts cut him off.CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

“Oh, isn’t that Big Brother Long Chen?”

“It really is him. Heavens, he’s sitting in the central seat! And he’s holding the golden scepter. Could it be…?”

“Heavens, so he’s the mysterious head umpire! How crazy!”

“Do you think he’ll be a bit biased toward us due to our connection? Maybe he’ll directly declare our victory without needing us to fight!”

A group of women were chatting as they walked in, their voices carrying through the arena. They were the disciples Feng Fei had invited to dine with Long Chen earlier.

“Shut your mouths!” Ye Lingkong roared, trying to regain control of the atmosphere, but the women’s chatter had already disrupted his great moment. Hence, he felt the urge to silence them permanently.

One of the women countered, “Why are you shouting? Who do you think you are to tell us to be quiet? If anyone should be quiet here, it’s you.”

“Exactly! We’re not even from the Ye clan. You can’t order us around.”

“I really hate people who think they can order people around just because they have some power. Your power has nothing to do with us. We don’t need your protection. Why are you shouting at us?”

“Exactly. A man who only knows how to shout when he encounters a problem can’t have any real skill. Big Sister Feng Fei told us that Big Brother Long Chen often said that if being loud was useful, donkeys would have long since taken over the world.”

“...”

These women were sharp-tongued indeed. Long Chen recalled how he had hastily exited the banquet when confronted by their verbal prowess. Now that their focus was on Ye Lingkong, Long Chen almost burst out laughing.

Ye Lingkong’s face darkened, looking almost like charcoal. However, he was profoundly aware that a good man shouldn’t fight women. More importantly, he realized he couldn’t outtalk them all even if he tried. His one mouth couldn’t possibly beat them all.

Taking a deep breath, Ye Lingkong redirected his attention to Long Chen. “I heard that your Dragonblood Legion is very powerful. Are they willing to face my Ye clan’s disciples in a fair contest?”

Upon hearing this, Qin Feng in the spectator stands started to smile knowingly.
