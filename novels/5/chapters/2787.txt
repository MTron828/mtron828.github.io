Chapter 2776 Besieged by Four Sovereigns

Countless runes lit up on the giant egg, and its shell gradually became translucent, allowing people to see a snow-white body curled up inside of it.

The body was that of a wolf, and its fur was like white jade. It seemed as if there were tiny runes flowing around every single strand of it. Right now, its eyes were closed in slumber, and only a single patch of red fur was present on its forehead.

The shell was being nourished by essence blood and starting to crack. As it did, a terrifying aura came out from within, one pulsing with majestic divine energy. In fact, the first pulse directly blasted apart the Blood race’s experts standing beside it. Quite a few of those experts were Saints but were still wiped out.

“Hahaha, so it was still lacking a bit of energy. It seems that I still underestimated the wolf god’s power,” laughed the Blood Fiend Devil Lord excitedly.

Even after absorbing so much blood soul energy, the wolf god had yet to awaken. Its power far surpassed the Blood Fiend Devil Lord’s expectations. The more energy it absorbed, the more it proved its power.

The Blood race had been consecrating the wolf god race for countless years, so the latter had sent them this wolf god egg from a higher plane.

As a matter of fact, this egg had been in the Yin Yang world for over a hundred thousand years. Whenever the Yin Yang World opened and the Martial Heaven Continent’s experts entered to adventure, whether they killed the inhabitants of that world or they were killed themselves, it would produce blood soul energy for the wolf god egg.

After being nourished for so many years, it was finally awakening for this era. But the result was that it was still missing a bit of energy.

At this moment, the power of the wolf god egg delighted the Blood Fiend Devil Lord, as he was the one to awaken this wolf god. According to the wolf god race’s convention, he would be this wolf god’s companion, and his talent and aptitude would be bound to it. He would then have the wolf god’s blessing for his future cultivation and progress by leaps and bounds.

“If it’s still missing a bit of blood soul energy, then I’ll just need to produce some more.” The Blood Fiend Devil Lord laughed and suddenly shot toward the barrier.

The supreme divine items in Mo Nian, Wilde, Ye Zhiqiu, and Zi Yan’s hands quivered, causing the four of them to vanish. All of them then reappeared within the barrier.

At this moment, their divine items disappeared from their hands as well, merging with their images in the sky to reinforce the barrier. It then instantly strengthened by several levels.

“This tortoise shell of yours won’t last much longer. Prey that is fated to be slaughtered cannot escape!” The Alldevil Heavenwalker also flew over, attacking the barrier. As a result, ripples spread across the barrier with each of his attacks.

On the other side, the Blood Fiend Devil Lord was also attacking the barrier with his Blood Soul Tower. Every strike caused the land to tremble, shaking people’s hearts.

Ye Ming, the Nine-Headed Lion, the Blood Fiend Devil Lord, and the Alldevil Heavenwalker were crazily assaulting the barrier, causing it to gradually weaken. Hence, the people inside were all terrified.

“Husband…” Mrs. Long was awake now and trembled in fear. Being nothing more than an ordinary person, she was naturally terrified upon seeing such a scene.

“Don’t worry. I’m here. I will protect you,” whispered Long Tianxiao comfortingly.

“There’s no need to worry! Big brother will definitely protect us. Grandpa High Priest already told me that big brother is this world’s strongest person!” declared Long Xiaoyu confidently.

However, not everyone was as brave as Long Xiaoyu. Some children were hiding and crying in the embraces of the adults, and even those adults were terrified. They were watching fiends from their nightmares attack them. They wanted to wake up, but this wasn’t a dream. It was the reality.

They were all simply ordinary people, so they could only entrust their lives to the experts.

As for the weaker cultivators, they were filled with guilt over not being qualified to participate in this battle. Some of them were youngsters who were only at the Life Star realm or the Soul Transformation realm, but they stood together with the older experts.

It was simply a case of being born in the right great era, but not having the power to grab the chance to change their lives. They hadn’t managed to ascend into powerful experts.

Hence, they could only stare as the Dragonblood warriors woke up one after another and gathered at the very front fearlessly. They were like an iron wall protecting them.

The other person that they looked at was the one with a surging Emperor aura. At this moment, Long Chen was surrounded by flowing stars. However, people didn’t quite dare to look directly at him.

“I really was blind back then to believe those rumors.” Some people slapped themselves a few times until their faces were bloody, startling the people around them.

Long Chen had reached his current level while being cursed and questioned by them. No expert’s path was more difficult than his.

It was today that they truly believed Long Chen was the true protector of the Martial Heaven Continent. Back then, they had continuously thought of every possible way to hinder him, slowing down his growth. They had once believed in the divine families and Pill Valley, but those powers then revealed their true faces. The divine families were even a leading enemy force behind this dark era.

As for Pill Valley, the fighting had been going on for so long, but they had yet to appear. Without them, the main force on the front lines of the Martial Heaven Continent’s side was the Dragonblood Legion.

Moreover, with this battle at hand, the truth about every person’s character was revealed. Certain people were filled with regret, but that no longer had any meaning. “If only they had known sooner?” Such a thing meant nothing in this world.

The four enemy Sovereigns were attacking the barrier while assisted by their giant armies. Also, they continued to slaughter their own people at the same time.

Since they had advanced to the Sovereign realm, all the blood soul energy was flowing toward the giant egg, as well as the four spatial gates.

Suddenly, three explosive sounds rang out, and the remaining spatial gates opened. Strange lifeforms came walking out with terrifying auras.

Just like the Undying race’s gate, those experts were at the half-step Emperor level. They came out like locusts, assaulting the Sovereigns’ barrier.

“Prepare for battle!” 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

Guo Ran shouted, clenching his dual blades. Right now, the Dragonblood warriors had all awakened and advanced to the Saint realm.

As the Dragonblood warriors unsheathed their weapons, Blood Qi soared into the heavens along with countless dragon roars, shaking the sky.
