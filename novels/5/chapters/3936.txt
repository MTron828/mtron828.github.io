Chapter 3925 Kunpeng Wings

“Kunpeng Life Pierce!”

As Kun Tu roared, he abandoned his human form. In his true body, he directly raised his wings against the dragon claws.

Kun Tu’s wings and head glowed with divine light, forming a sharp arrowhead. With a desperate shout, he smashed toward Long Chen’s dragon claws in a practically suicidal charge.

Kun Tu was mad with fury. As the ancestral Kun, he had gone from the lower plane to the immortal world after experiencing countless dangers and tribulations. Having defeated all enemies on his path, he had his pride.

Hence, how could someone as prideful as him lose to Long Chen? Long Chen was a human! Even if he had the power of the ancestral dragon, he wasn’t actually an ancestral dragon, so Kun Tu could not accept this reality.

Now, Kun Tu didn’t hold anything back. His very life force was ignited as he was willing to drag Long Chen down to the abyss with him. He was now just as crazy as the Nine Underworld Luocha had been.

Even if he had to die, he would protect the dignity of the Kunpeng race by dragging Long Chen down with him.

BOOM!

One of the dragon claws was directly blasted apart by Kun Tu’s charge. But the other claw smashed into Kun Tu and sent him flying, causing precious Kunpeng blood to rain down.

Just then, Long Aotian’s attack came. However, he was different from Kun Tu. An ancient figure had appeared behind him, pouring a desolate aura into his body. The current Long Aotian was like a different person.

“Long Chen, let me see how you will block this attack of mine!”

Seeing Long Chen’s attack being received by Kun Tu, Long Aotian immediately grasped the opportunity, launching his weapons toward Long Chen with all his power.

Clearly, Long Aotian had let Kun Tu take all the attention, while he seized the chance to launch an all-out attack.

“I promised that senior to beat Kun Tu with only the power of my physical body. But I didn’t say anything about you.”

In front of Long Aotian’s wild charge, Long Chen directly took out a bronze cauldron that he had obtained in the heavenly tomb.

When Long Aotian saw this cauldron appear, his eyes almost popped out of their sockets. He had actually forgotten about this terrifying treasure. Now, it was too late to dodge.

BOOM!

His Sun Moon Five Element Flag and blood spear stabbed into the cauldron with all the power of the mysterious expert in his manifestation. After that, the two peerless divine weapons actually exploded.

The explosive impact directly blew apart Long Aotian’s manifestation, sending him hacking up blood with both of his arms broken. He fainted just like that.

…

At the same time as Long Aotian’s manifestation was destroyed, within a mysterious palace, a white-haired elder coughed up blood.

This was the elder that appeared in Long Aotian’s manifestation. At this moment, he furiously cursed, “Who dared to touch Aotian?! I will destroy your entire family!”

…

However, the elder’s roar could not be heard by Long Chen. But even if he did hear, he wouldn’t care.

Long Chen still couldn’t control the bronze cauldron, only capable of bringing it out like this and then putting it away. But that alone was enough to crush Long Aotian.

After putting away the cauldron, Long Chen walked over to Kun Tu with the Minghong Saber in hand. Kun Tu was practically falling apart after receiving the dragon claws, but it went without saying that his physical body was truly terrifying. It was Long Chen’s first time seeing such a terrifying physical body.

Long Chen now controlled ancestral dragon essence blood. However, the ancestral dragon’s divine abilities weren’t something that he could truly control. He could unleash them, but that was all. He couldn’t pull them back or control how they attacked. Furthermore, just unleashing them put a heavy burden on his body. One mistake and he would be the one injured by his own attack.Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

The dragon expert had actually told Long Chen to only absorb three runes back then, but Long Chen had been stubborn and not wanted to. Now thinking about it, other than Dragon Roars at the Nine Heavens, he was completely unable to control the other two divine abilities. Learning more would have been meaningless. Furthermore, time did not permit it.

Now, Long Chen understood what it meant for there to always be heavens beyond the heavens, for there to always be a greater talent. The dragon race indeed stood at the peak of the ten thousand beasts, a testament to their strength.

However, the Kunpeng race was capable of competing against the dragon race with their own abilities. Kun Tu was the prime example, which opened Long Chen’s eyes to the world today.

“You lost. I’ll send you on your way.”

Long Chen slowly raised the Minghong Saber. Enemies were enemies. Long Chen was not so soft-hearted as to let him off. When Kun Tu had attacked the Dragonblood Legion, he hadn’t been thinking about letting them off either.

“Don’t kill him!”

Suddenly, the dragon expert’s voice rang out in his mind.

“What?” Long Chen was startled. Didn’t the dragon expert personally ask him to directly crush Kun Tu to death?

“Tear off his wings and refine them into lightning wings. Then you’ll have the Kunpeng’s speed,” said the dragon expert.

Long Chen was startled. Possess the Kunpeng’s speed? He was very enticed by it. But then thinking about it, what did that have to do with killing Kun Tu or not?

“If you don’t kill him, he will produce new Kunpeng wings, and the new wings might very likely be a mutated set. Then you can cut them off and refine them into lightning wings as well. With four lightning wings, you might even grasp the Kunpeng race’s divine abilities. The Kunpeng race’s strongest point is their wings. Back then, if it weren’t for them being too fast and fleeing as soon as they lost, we’d have exterminated them. Stop wasting time and do as I say. Would I harm you?” Toward the end, the dragon expert got impatient.

Hearing this, Long Chen circulated the energy in his arms and forcibly tore off Kun Tu’s wings from his giant body.

“AHH!”

The half-unconscious Kun Tu was instantly woken by the pain and screamed.

“Damn, your lungs are quite healthy. It seems that you won’t die any time soon.” Long Chen put the torn-off wings in his spiritual space and then clicked his tongue at Kun Tu.

“Long Chen, a warrior can be killed but not humiliated! For you to treat me like this, my Kunpeng race will annihilate you and your entire family!” Kun Tu roared. His eyes almost popped out of their sockets when he saw that his wings were torn off.

“A pair of wings for your life. I’m letting you off easy. Scram.” Long Chen kicked Kun Tu, sending his giant body flying.

Buzz.

Suddenly, Long Chen’s expression changed as he felt an intense summoning.

“We’re being forced out of this world! Not good, I have to hurry up!”

Long Chen grabbed the unconscious Long Aotian and rushed off in a certain direction. That was the spatial gate leading to Luo Zichuan’s location.
