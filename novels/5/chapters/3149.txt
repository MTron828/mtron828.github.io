Chapter 3138 Golden Lotus Manifestation

“That’s it! That made me feel so much pressure it felt like my soul was being stabbed! I had no choice but to concede.”

When that golden lotus appeared, a Primal shouted. He had faced Bai Shishi, but when this golden lotus mark appeared, a sensation of death enveloped him. If he had continued fighting, it felt like his death would be doubtless.

Several other Primals had the same experience. They all trusted in their gut feeling.

Now that the golden lotus truly appeared, that feeling was instantly confirmed. If they really had continued fighting back then, they wouldn’t be alive now.

The giant lotus unleashed explosive metal energy like a volcano erupting. Hence, the martial stage rocked like a boat on a furious sea, and even the very island that the martial stage was on quivered. Bai Shishi had started off with a wild attack.

Ku Wuya’s wolf tooth club smashed into the golden lotus, only for him to be sent flying back like a meteor. He bounced off the ground several times, every time leaving a large hole in the ground before he smashed into the barrier at the edge of the martial stage.

The barrier shuddered, and cracks spread where Ku Wuya smashed into it.

“This power…”

This sight shocked people. Just how great of an impact did Ku Wuya receive to be blown back so far and still smash cracks into the barrier? It seemed that if it was a bit stronger, he would have pierced straight through the barrier.

“Hahaha, this will be fun.”

Ku Wuya fell from the barrier, but he seemed completely fine as he shook out some muscles. It seemed that even such an impact was unable to cause him any injuries.

The barrier behind him quickly healed itself. The cracks faded. It was as if nothing had happened.

With his wolf tooth club in hand, Ku Wuya walked back toward Bai Shishi. He sneered, “In the current era, no one can compete with me in terms of physical body. The Corpse Devil Dao’s inheritance will shine in my hands. Submit to me and be my dual cultivation partner. Otherwise, when I rule this world, I will destroy your High Firmament Academy.”

Ku Wuya’s voice resounded throughout heaven and earth with unlimited arrogance. With every step he took, the void shuddered, and the pressure increased.

On the seventh step, black qi condensed behind him into a black figure. That figure raised its head and roared.

With a single roar, the entire barrier instantly became covered in cracks. The spectators covered their ears and screamed. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

“It’s the sound of the Heavenly Howlers!” exclaimed an expert of the senior generation.

The Heavenly Howlers could be considered an ancient species. Their bodies were like apes, and they had long arms and short legs. It was said that they could crush stars with a single hand and shatter the heavens with a single howl.

No one had expected Ku Wuya’s manifestation to be such an ancient beast. It was a terrifying beast famed for its power. Just its roar was enough to terrify everyone. Ku Wuya was no human; he was a monster.

However, Bai Shishi remained indifferent. Even after summoning her golden lotus and blasting Ku Wuya away, she didn’t pursue him. She only formed hand seals.

Her hand seals were quick. In the blink of an eye, she finished hundreds of seals, and it was impossible to even see her fingers as they flew.

“Struggling is useless. In front of my absolute power, you can’t do anything,” sneered Ku Wuya, swinging his wolf tooth club.

With a single swing, a giant tear in space appeared. It didn’t heal for a long time.

“His power has reached the level of affecting laws?!” Divine Lord experts exclaimed their shock. It had to be known that only at the Divine Lord realm could they barely manage to interact with the profundities of laws.

However, Ku Wuya was only at the Divine Flame realm. Above the Divine Flame realm was still the Four Peak realm.

Only when four peaks were merged into one did one reach true divinity, becoming a Divine Lord. There were two major realms apart. One was on the earth, and the other was in the heavens. So how could Ku Wuya possess this kind of power? The Divine Flame disciples and the Four Peak experts might not know what he was doing, but the Divine Lord experts were stunned.

No wonder they heard that he had slain Divine Lords before. They had thought that it was just some exaggerated rumors, but seeing this today, they no longer doubted it. Ku Wuya truly was shocking. It seemed that he did possess the power to slay Divine Lords.

It was also rumored that Gui Yun had slain Divine Lords as well, and not just one. However, that was understandable to these Divine Lords because Gui Yun was an assassin. An assassin specialized in killing targets that were even stronger than them.

However, Ku Wuya was no assassin. If he wanted to kill a Divine Lord, he would need to rely on true power. There was a difference between the two.

As Ku Wuya continued to walk toward Bai Shishi, an ear-piercing sound rang out from his wolf tooth club that shook people’s hearts.

Suddenly, Bai Shishi’s hand seals came to a stop, and golden light burst into existence behind her. A giant ring of golden light appeared with sparks of light within it. As more of them appeared, people realized that they formed a miniature person.

This person slowly grew larger until it appeared to be a long-haired woman. She was slender and elegant, like a goddess that had come from ancient times, yet also like a fairy that had descended from the heavens. When they saw her, it felt like time came to a stop.

She continued to grow larger and eventually walked out of the ring of light. At this moment, Bai Shishi’s body suddenly became illusory. The figure merged with her, and then the two of them walked onto the golden lotus. After that, the golden lotus shrank. Some kind of mysterious power caused space to collapse.

When the golden lotus was only about three feet long, Bai Shishi was once more Bai Shishi. But she was now one with that golden figure.

She appeared the same, but her black hair had turned golden. Her eyes also had golden marks revolving within them. She had become a golden war goddess.

“Activating my bloodline power for the first time actually took so much time. But it’s done.”

Bai Shishi looked at her own hand. Upon seeing the golden lines flowing on top of it, a slight smile appeared on her face.

After that, the sound of her sword coming out of its sheath rang out clearly. She shot out, a streak of golden light flashing through the air.

Ku Wuya suddenly roared and swung his club. However, he missed. The next moment, golden light flashed, and an arm flew into the air along with a spray of fresh blood that was black as ink.
