Chapter 2164 Divine Sparrow Swallowing the Heavens

An immense battle was being fought at the gates to the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow race. Countless experts of the Xuan Beasts were currently attacking.

Over three thousand Dragonblood warriors were immersed in a blood-soaked battle. The ground beneath them was already covered in blood. Corpses were everywhere, some from the attacking Xuan Beasts, some from the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow race. There were rivers of blood constantly flowing.

On the earth and in the sky, there seemed to be an endless torrent of Xuan Beasts charging over.

“Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow race, you’re the disgrace of the Xuan Beasts. Today, we’ll make sure you vanish from this world forever!” shouted one of the Xuan Beasts’ experts. He was in his true form and was a flaming wild lion.

As soon as he was done roaring, a black light pierced through his head, killing him.

That was one of the divine abilities of the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow race.

“Just come and try it!” Que Yuzhu had taken the form of a giant Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow. All her feathers shone brightly as she led the experts of her race.

The Xuan Beasts had sent over a powerful force. But Xia Chen’s formations were still active. The surveillance formation he had set up over this region during the Stone race and the Mechanism Sect’s sneak attack was still present.

As a result, the Xuan Beasts’ attack was sensed immediately, and the Dragonblood warriors had crashed down upon them before they could enter the territory of the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow race.

Without a word, a bloody battle had started. This battle was extremely intense, and many casualties had appeared amongst the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow race. This time, the Xuan Beasts had gone all-out, bringing an army of tens of thousands of twelfth rank Magical Beasts.

“Hmph, if that’s what you want, then we’ll try it. You traitors have lost the face of the Xuan Beasts. Do you think that Long Chen can protect you forever? Ha, Long Chen might be dead now, so just give up on him,” announced Huang Feiyan. She was like a divine phoenix, her body enveloped in flames.

The current Huang Feiyan had hundreds of other experts from the Nine Heavens Divine Phoenix race with her. They were all in their true bodies, fighting against the Dragonblood warriors.

“Someone who can kill my boss has yet to be born. Who cares about your Nine Heaven Divine Phoenix race?” sneered one of the Dragonblood warriors.

The three thousand Dragonblood warriors had all summoned their manifestations, which then linked together into a formation. They had already been fighting for an hour against Huang Feiyan and the other experts, but neither side was able to beat the other.

The Dragonblood warriors were unable to kill Huang Feiyan, but Huang Feiyan was unable to get past them either.

However, what the Dragonblood warriors were worried about was a certain fight going on. Cloud was up in the sky, every single one of her feathers blazing with divine light. Her brilliance illuminated the world. Although she was only at the eleventh rank, her terrifying Blood Qi was even more majestic than a twelfth rank Magical Beast.

Meng Qi was on Cloud’s back, with her manifestation at full power behind her. It contained an endless mountain range filled with immortal mist.

Meng Qi held a peacock’s feather in her hand. That was the Blue Eye Peacock’s original true feather, which contained the Blue Eye Peacock’s divine abilities.

Facing Meng Qi and Cloud was a sharp-faced man, the one who had inherited the Peng Emperor’s legacy, Kun Pengzi.

Kun Pengzi also had his manifestation active. It was a giant Kunpeng. It was so huge that its wings directly soared into the cosmos, filled with a will to charge out of the nine heavens.

Kun Pengzi’s gaze was icily sharp. “Hand over the Myriad Spirit Diagram, and under my name as the descendant of the Peng Emperor, I can let you off. Otherwise, you’ll all be killed today.”

“I’d rather die.” Meng Qi was firm.

“I’ve given you your chance, but you don’t want it. Then I’ll be taking it myself.” The Kunpeng in his manifestation shook and he transformed into a bolt of lightning that shot at Meng Qi.

Meng Qi seemed to have anticipated this attack. Upon forming a one-handed hand seal, the world around her suddenly collapsed. Heaven and earth twisted, and stars appeared all around, blocking Kun Pengzi.

“Don’t think that I’ll fall for the same technique twice. Your illusions are already useless.” Kun Pengzi clawed that world of stars, and it exploded. Lightning surged out, forming a giant lightning chain.

The lightning chain blew through this artificial world that was an illusion constructed out of Meng Qi’s Spiritual Strength.

Just as the illusion was shattered, Meng Qi waved the original true feather in her hand. A ray of divine light shot out of it, transforming into a sharp sword piercing toward Kun Pengzi.

“Even if the Blue Eye Peacock’s true body was here, it would have to submit to me. As for a feather? Be broken!”

Kun Pengzi’s footsteps didn’t pause. With a rake of his hand, a lightning claw crashed into the light-sword, shattering it. The lightning claw then continued toward Meng Qi and Cloud.

Meng Qi’s heart shook. They had been fighting for a while now, but Kun Pengzi had only been using probing blows before. Now that he was using his full power, she was unable to endure it.

Cloud let out a brilliant bird cry and also sent a claw out. Her claw was covered in black runes that made it look metallic and sharp enough to tear the sky apart.

BOOM!

The two claws clashed. The runes on Cloud’s claw crumbled, leaving it covered in blood.

“The Cloud Chasing Heaven Raking Claw? You’ve even awakened your ancestral divine ability. But too bad, it’s not mature enough. It’s too lacking to fight against me.” With a flash, Kun Pengzi appeared in front of Cloud, a lightning sword in hand.

BOOM!

Cloud was still flying back from the impact of their last exchange, but she gathered all her power to her head to receive this attack. Just as the lightning sword slashed toward her head, the original true feather appeared in front of her, blazing with light. As a result, the true feather exploded.

That strongest feather of the Blue Eye Peacock appeared weak in front of the lightning sword.

The thunderforce that Kun Pengzi controlled was not ordinary lightning. It also wasn’t divine lightning. That energy seemed to be something that did not belong to the heavens, but it possessed immense destructive power, as well as a certain sharpness.

His attack continued after breaking the true feather and struck Cloud’s head. As a result, a mass of Cloud’s feathers fell from her head, and a large wound appeared.

If it weren’t for the true feather blocking a portion of that attack’s power, then this would have been a serious injury or even a death sentence.

Meng Qi’s heart was cold. This Kun Pengzi was too powerful. Her manifestation hadn’t reached its peak, and the amount of power she could unleash was limited.

As for Kun Pengzi’s thunderforce, it was especially effective against her soul arts. She wasn’t able to threaten him much.

Cloud had just come out of seclusion. Although she had managed to gain control over the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow race’s strongest divine abilities, she hadn’t been able to train in them for long, and so they lacked maturity.

Being sliced in the head, Cloud went crazy. Her whole body began to shine. Opening her mouth, a powerful suction force appeared.

With her mouth as the core, the void collapsed, forming a giant whirlpool that sucked up everything in the surroundings. The world shook. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

“Divine Sparrow Swallowing the Heavens?”

Kun Pengzi’s expression changed. This was the most ancient divine ability of the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow race. In fact, it was so ancient that it only existed in legends. It was unexpected for Cloud to be able to awaken such an ancient divine ability.

If swallowed into Cloud’s stomach, then even Kun Pengzi would be wiped out by this divine ability. It was a technique with no counter, and this was also why even the Kunpeng race had to restrain themselves to a certain extent around the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow race.

“Lock!” Kun Pengzi slammed his hands together, and the Kunpeng in his manifestation folded its wings around him. The space around him turned still as if frozen. His body was firmly locked in space.

He had charged right in front of Cloud to attack, and Cloud had furiously activated her strongest divine ability.

Mountains collapsed and the earth was torn asunder. Trees, boulders, rivers, they all flowed into Cloud’s stomach.

“No!”

Several of the Xuan Beasts’ experts were also sucked in. Once sucked into the whirlpool, no matter how they struggled, it was useless. They were all pulled into Cloud’s mouth.

They could see their figures shrink as they entered Cloud’s mouth. They were then crushed by some power and turned into nothing more than dust.

Whether it was the heavenly geniuses of the Xuan Beasts or powerful twelfth rank Magical Beasts, once sucked into Cloud’s mouth, all that awaited them was death.

Regretfully, Cloud could only maintain this technique for a few breaths’ time. Although she had killed hundreds of the Xuan Beasts’ experts, she was unable to suck Kun Pengzi in. Furthermore, Cloud’s aura began to plummet.

Just at that moment, Kun Pengzi dispelled his space-locking art and shot toward Cloud’s back. His target was Meng Qi, or more accurately, the Myriad Spirit Diagram in her hands.

Meng Qi’s manifestation shook and the world twisted. Meng Qi vanished from her original location, appearing at Cloud’s tail.

“Your manifestation is useless against me.”

Meng Qi had just reappeared when Kun Pengzi showed up, standing in front of her. Quick as lightning, his hand reached for Meng Qi’s neck.

Just as his hand was about to touch Meng Qi’s neck, another hand that was as quick as lightning slapped Kun Pengzi in his arrogant face.
