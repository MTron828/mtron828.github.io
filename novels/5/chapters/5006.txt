“What Heaven Earth Cauldron? Don’t listen to his nonsense. All of you know he’s been using the Heaven Earth Cauldron as a scam.” The Long clan leader flatly denied the allegations.

The three clan leaders simply stared at him in silence, creating an awkward atmosphere.

Finally, it was the Jiang clan leader who spoke up, “The four divine clans are united. We rise and fall together. I believe some matters shouldn’t be concealed from each other.”

Inside, the Long clan leader cursed. Was Long Chen an idiot? How could he blurt out something like that? The youngest dean of the High Firmament Academy? Dogshit. He was nothing but the youngest idiot in history.

The Long clan leader had wanted to use the other three clans to pressure Long Chen into leaving, under the pretext of the internal exchange of pointers among the four clans.

Across the world, major factions were preparing their disciples to advance to the Eternal realm. Many disciples were on the verge of breakthroughs, waiting for the right time to do so.

Within the cycle of the Heavenly Daos, as the world revolved, the experts could tell that the laws were changing. If they wanted the best conditions for their advancement, they needed to follow the timing of the heavens. As a result, countless experts were reading the weave of fate. When the energy of the Heavenly Daos became active, that would be the right moment for them.

The Long clan knew of Qin Feng’s arrival and guessed that the High Firmament Academy was urging Long Chen to return. Hence, they hoped that by stating their intentions, Long Chen would decide to leave.

However, their plan backfired as Long Chen brought up the Heaven Earth Cauldron. Now, the other three clans were aware of its existence as well. The three clan leaders were no fools, and the Long clan couldn’t trick them now.

“Fine. Come with me!”

Ultimately, with no other recourse, the Long clan leader led them underground. When they laid eyes on the Earth Cauldron and felt its ancient aura from the primal chaos era, their hearts skipped a beat. They could hardly believe what they were seeing.

While they had only seen illustrations of the Earth Cauldron before, the real thing surpassed their expectations. Despite minor differences from the depictions, the overwhelming power it exuded was unquestionably real.

Looking at their shocked expression, the Long clan leader said, “I don’t consider the three of you as outsiders, but I must ask that you keep this matter confidential.”

“Don’t worry. Those who know of this are the pillars of our clans, so they won’t leak this matter,” said the Zhao clan leader.

The three of them came up to the Earth Cauldron and touched it. Sensing its faint aura, they were taken aback.

“The earth Cauldron is in a state of slumber. As you can see, we are doing our best to awaken it, but we’re still missing a bit of power. Since we’re all old friends, I won’t mince words. In another half a month, our Long clan can revive it on our own. However, as you said, the four clans are united, rising and falling together. The Earth Cauldron will not be owned exclusively by the Long clan. However…”

Hesitating for a moment, the Long clan leader continued, “The Earth Cauldron was first discovered by my Long clan, so the Earth Cauldron must stay within our territory. In the future, you can come to the Long clan to use it, but you cannot bring it away.”

The Jiang clan leader replied, “That is naturally no problem. Even if you were planning on lending it to us, we wouldn’t dare to accept it. This thing is too terrifying. The moment any news of it leaks, the four clans will be targeted by everyone.”

The other two clan leaders nodded. It was the legendary Heaven Earth Cauldron, one of the ten great primal chaos divine items. With it in their hands, no one could say whether it was a blessing or a calamity.

“This cauldron is the Earth Cauldron. I have thoroughly reviewed all our information on it. Once awakened, its life energy can nourish all things within heaven and earth. Being a primal chaos divine item, it operates under its own primal chaos laws. Essentially, with sufficient resources, it has the potential to create a primal chaos world,” explained the Long clan leader.

“Primal chaos world?” echoed the three clan leaders, visibly moved.

“If it can create a primal chaos world, our cultivation would no longer be so difficult!” exclaimed the Ye clan leader excitedly.

At their level, advancing further was exceedingly challenging. Typically, even minor breakthroughs required years of painstaking effort and accumulation.

In their realm, spiritual qi had lost its value. What they needed now was to absorb the laws of heaven and earth, which could nourish and give birth to heaven vein dragon qi. The difficulty did not stem from their lack of talent or diligence, but rather from the scarcity of heaven and earth laws that could meet their demands.

However, if the Earth Cauldron could create a primal chaos world, by cultivating inside, although they wouldn’t say they could soar in leaps and bounds, their realms would definitely rise.

“In theory, yes,” replied the Long clan leader.

“What does that mean?” ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

“I’m just saying turning that into reality will be extremely difficult. It will need an ocean’s worth of resources,” answered the Long clan leader.

“What’s there to be afraid of? With the foundation of the four divine clans, how could we not awaken a single cauldron? I’ll gather all my clan’s resources and bring them over,” said the Zhao clan leader.

The other two clan leaders nodded. After all, once the Earth Cauldron awoke, their power would rise explosively, and they could get all kinds of resources.

The three clan leaders immediately sent people back to the clans with their tokens. After that, the experts who had attended the banquet were summoned, and they started using their heaven vein energy to nourish the Earth Cauldron.

With the nourishment of so many heaven vein dragon qis, the Earth Cauldron’s aura intensified. It started to fluctuate intensely, hinting that it might awaken at any moment.

…

As the experts from the four divine clans diligently worked, Long Chen observed the scene from the Earth Cauldron and laughed until his legs went jelly.

The four clan leaders and their experts were sweating profusely, their bodies surrounded by swirling dragon qi. Their faces were red and contorted as if they had been constipated for ten years, pouring all their energy into the Earth Cauldron.

“What a bunch of greedy old fellows. Work hard. I look favorably upon you, hehe!” Long Chen chuckled.

“You shouldn’t slack off either. During this time, you need to master the God Slaying Cross. Then when you condense the eighth star, you will have a killer technique,” advised the Earth Cauldron.

“Didn’t you say that before reaching the Eternal realm, using this technique will blow up my arm?” questioned Long Chen. He recalled the Earth Cauldron had warned him against practicing the technique previously.

“I didn’t say to train it using your astral energy,” clarified the Earth Cauldron.

Long Chen was baffled. The God Slaying Cross was a divine technique of the nine star line. Without astral energy, what alternative could he use?

“Use your bloodline power!”
