Chapter 4549 Teaching Lei Linger Bad Habits

Although Feng You seemed like she could hold her own against four of them, their combined power had actually dealt her quite a blow, and she had secretly suffered in that clash.

Seeing one of them go after Long Chen, she wanted to save him, but the other three just didn’t allow her to.

Just as Feng You was about to use a forbidden art to break free from the three of them, unexpectedly, the seemingly weak Long Chen slapped this expert in the face without giving him any chance to counterattack.

Long Chen’s slap didn’t seem fast at all. In fact, everyone could see it clearly, and it should have been easy to dodge. However, it still struck that person’s face.

The slap was explosive, shattering half of that person’s face. When his blood sprayed into the air, the sickening sound of bones breaking also made people wince.

“Did I give you too much face? Do you really think that Boss Long San is easy to bully?” Long Chen rolled up his sleeves, cursing the expert he had just slapped.

Long Chen truly was incensed. He had hidden his aura and had so many powerful people around him. He wasn’t even fighting at the moment, but this person had randomly chosen him to target. That was too unlucky, wasn’t it?

Unbeknownst to him, the Blood Gauze Sect had taken note of Feng You from a distance. Seeing that Long Chen was very close to her and she seemed to be looking after him, they had assumed that he was someone important to her.

Perhaps another race wouldn’t think this way. After all, Long Chen’s aura was too weak. However, the Blood Gauze Sect was a human faction. Seeing that Long Chen was handsome and capable of walking alongside Feng You, they immediately tried targeting him.

Seeing Feng You panic like that, they were sure that their guess was correct. However, to their surprise, Long Chen directly slapped their top expert cleanly in the face.

This dumbfounded the Blood Gauze Sect’s experts and the mixed beast race.

Long Chen had surprised them many times on the battlefield, and his accomplishments could not be looked down upon. However, he always relied on shameless techniques to do so, with the exception of this recent slap. It seemed to be backed by real power.

“Damn bastard, you’ll pay the price for that!” the slapped expert roared. However, given that half of his face was broken, he only had one way to shout. With dislocated jaws and blood oozing all over his face, he looked horrifying.

In fact, the slapped expert had only probed Feng You. If Feng You hadn’t reacted when he attacked Long Chen, he would have switched to a different target.

Hence, his attention had been on Feng You and the rest of the mixed beast race the entire time. In fact, most of his attention was on the tempo of the entire battlefield, not Long Chen. Thus, Long Chen easily slapped him. Anyway, even if he hadn’t been distracted, he wouldn’t have been able to dodge this divine face-slapping art.

The slapped expert didn’t even know how he had been struck by this slap. Thinking that he had simply been too careless, he charged forward once more, swinging his sword at Long Chen with all his power.

“Protect Long Chen!”

The mixed beast race’s experts roared, and nine of their top experts joined forces to protect him.

BOOM!

The blow knocked all of them back, and one of them even vomited blood.

When those nine people appeared in front of him, Long Chen couldn’t help but feel touched. That was because amongst the nine of them, three of them normally would look at him with hostility, not liking how close he was to Feng You.

However, when he was in danger, they didn’t hesitate to protect him. This single act tugged at the deepest part of his heart. The mixed beast race’s clear way of repaying gratitudes and grudges was admirable.

The nine of them had managed to block the slapped expert. At this moment, Long Chen appeared like a phantom before that expert and slapped the other side of his face.

There was another explosive sound, but this slap was even more ruthless than the last. This time, a lightning rune flashed on Long Chen’s palm, and he directly crushed that expert’s head. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

He had practically slapped a peak expert to death, crushing the latter’s head and Yuan Spirit at the same time.

“Big Brother Long Chen, what do you think? Am I amazing?” Lei Linger’s excited cry rang out in Long Chen’s mind.

Long Chen couldn’t help being stunned. It seemed that Lei Linger had used her power in that slap.

Lei Linger had grown to the point that even Long Chen didn’t know just how strong she was. Hence, her lightning rune instantly killed that person.

In the past, Long Chen and Lei Linger had worked together like this. Long Chen was in charge of slapping, boasting an almost one-hundred percent hit rate. The only downside was that his face-slapping technique lacked any killing power. If he added power to this slap, it would truly be a killing blow. However, his enemies would then sense the threat of death and be more likely to dodge.

This was where Lei Linger really shone. She would unleash her power the moment Long Chen was about to slap his target, dealing a devastating blow. It was a flawless union.

Long Chen couldn’t help but sigh when he heard her naughty laughter. Learning good habits was hard, but bad habits were easy to pick up, even without anyone to teach them. Long Chen had just started to enjoy the delight of conning people when Lei Linger learned the same thing, conning a terrifying expert to death.

After that expert fell, a new six-star Heavenly Doyen Fruit appeared on the Heavenly Dao Tree.

Seeing that fruit, Long Chen was instantly revitalized and pointed at the other three experts of the Blood Gauze Sect, arrogantly shouting, “Little brats who don’t know how high the heavens are, come over here! Boss Long San will kill each of you with a slap!”

Just like that, Long Chen brazenly swaggered toward them.
