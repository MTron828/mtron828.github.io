Chapter 3898 Fairies Appear

When the curtain of night descended, this world became covered in endless darkness. The night devoured every trace of light and sound.

In an instant, a wave of terror surged through them. Within this enveloping darkness, they couldn’t see or hear anything, making them feel like they were sinking into the depths of despair.

Devoid of light and bereft of hope, they couldn’t even sense their own existence, evoking primal panic that seized their very core.

Fortunately, this dark world only appeared for an instant. People’s vision quickly recovered as did their hearing. They then saw endless darkness flow by them toward Ji Wuming.

As the dark domain crashed against Ji Wuming’s faith domain, the milky white light was devoured by the darkness. The two domains then merged together. The dark was no longer pure dark, and the light was no longer pure light. Instead, it was a gray domain.

This gray domain was like a solid barrier that others couldn’t see through. Amidst the engulfing darkness, the only audible sounds were the clash of two divine weapons, the reverberations of Ji Wuming's furious roars, and the chilling sound of a dagger slicing through flesh.

This giant gray domain materialized as a manifestation of the collision between dark energy and faith energy. Within its boundaries, the sound would intermittently dissipate, leaving an eerie silence that enveloped the world. At times, the darkness would obscure all visibility, rendering everything shrouded in obscurity. But people could see faint glimpses of two figures locked in a fierce clash.

“What a terrifying dark domain.”

When they were enveloped by that dark domain, they felt like they had died. That feeling of powerlessness and despair made them feel miniscule.

After the darkness passed them, they felt like they had escaped death. It was like they had already died and were revived. It was something that they would never be able to forget in this lifetime.

“Peak assassins are truly terrifying. In front of them, all others are lambs for the slaughter with no power to resist,” sighed one city lord.

These Divine Venerates were all figures with status and prestige in the three thousand worlds. They had lived for countless years, experiencing countless battles.

However, they had never seen such terrifying assassins. Originally, they had been slumbering, waiting for the eruption of the three thousand worlds. By relying on the superiority of their cultivation bases, they had been planning to crush the juniors, which allowed them to absorb more primal chaos qi and fully merge their Supreme Blood and Supreme Bone. Then they would be true Double Supremes and dominate the three thousand worlds.

However, now it seemed that they had been too naive. In times of destiny, great geniuses always rose. As for them, they were products of an abandoned era. This eruption of the three thousand worlds was for the junior generation, not for them.

For them to become Double Supremes was a million times more difficult, as they had missed the best time to merge their Supreme Blood and Supreme Bone. Even if they did manage to merge them, it still wouldn’t be such a perfect merge like Ji Wuming’s.

In other words, even if they became Double Supremes, even if their realms were two major realms greater than these newcomers, in terms of combat power, they would still be a level lower.

This was fate, and it could not be changed. Sometimes, once you missed something, it would never come back. Even if you fought for it with your very life, some regrets could not be made up for.

They sighed over how powerful Ji Wuming was, as well as how unfair life was. If they were in the Immortal King realm, they would be born at the right time for the eruption of the primal chaos qi and soar above the nine heavens. It should have been them.

“Hmph, I refuse to believe in fate! As long as you can grasp an opportunity, anyone can become a peak expert. Do you know how many tens of thousands of years I’ve waited for this opportunity? Even if I die today, I’ll fight! I would rather shatter as jade than live as some useless roof tile! I would rather die in a blaze of glory than live a life of mediocrity! What right does a little human have to touch the bloodline inheritance of the sacred dragon?! Since the heavens have revealed the treasures, they are up to everyone to fight for. If you’re afraid of death, then crawl back into your turtle den! I’m going forward!” shouted a demonic beast.

After saying that, he actually charged at the Dragonblood Legion. Due to Dong Mingyu’s appearance, they had all stopped fighting.

However, now, more and more experts were drawn here. All kinds of powers, all kinds of heavenly geniuses, and all kinds of old monsters were now present.

Following that one roar, countless people echoed his sentiment and charged as well. They were like a tsunami crashing down upon the Dragonblood Legion from all directions.

These were all powerful experts, either old monsters of the level of city lords or outstanding members of the junior generation. Most terrifying of all were the newcomers that had merged their Supreme Blood and Supreme Bone.

Those who dared to charge over were all extremely confident in themselves. They had immense power. As they unleashed their manifestations, a terrifying pressure emerged.Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

Millions of experts crashed down like an avalanche. They were going to use all their power and break through the Dragonblood Legion’s defenses in the most direct and explosive manner.

“Not good! Our formation won’t hold against such a charge!” Guo Ran and Xia Chen’s expressions instantly changed.

What they had been worried about had occurred. If so many attacks came at once, it would only be a simple clash of power against power. Now, the advantage they held in formation and strategy was rendered obsolete. There was no way to stop such an onslaught.

“Brothers, there’s no other way. We can only risk our lives and protect boss till the bitter end!” Guo Ran clenched his teeth. Just as the old man said, in front of absolute power, all schemes were useless. In such a dire predicament, no amount of intelligence or strategy could provide any assistance.

“Heavenly Rainbow Dao Slash!”

Suddenly, a majestic and beautiful voice rang out. A seven-colored sword then descended from the heavens, splitting the world in two.

BOOM!

This giant rainbow sword was like the blade of a heavenly god, blowing away countless lifeforms directly.

The rainbow sword left a deep ditch in the earth. Within the crevice, vibrant rainbow flames blazed relentlessly, their intensity igniting the very heavens above. As the flames engulfed the surroundings, space itself contorted and twisted under their scorching influence.

At this moment, a beautiful figure appeared. Clad in a long dress, her long black hair fell naturally past her shoulders. With a rainbow sword in her hand, she appeared akin to a celestial fire fairy descending from the heavens.

“The Pill Fairy!”

When they saw her, all the Dragonblood warriors protecting Long Chen were filled with disbelief.

They had personally witnessed the Pill Fairy dying in order to save Long Chen. Now that they saw her again, they couldn’t believe their eyes.

“Earth Surge Golden Lotus!”

Before they could even exchange greetings with the Pill Fairy, another resounding cry reverberated through the air. In an instant, the earth erupted, unleashing a dazzling display of golden divine radiance that illuminated the entire sky. Golden lotuses then burst forth from the ground, enveloping countless experts in their ethereal embrace.

Countless powerful experts found their way blocked by those golden lotuses, so they began to attack them.

However, in a sudden turn of events, the lotuses raised their stamens, unleashing a barrage of golden swords that pierced through the bodies of the hapless experts. Countless experts simply exploded upon contact with the golden swords.

“What terrifying metal energy!” Guo Ran was stunned. Those golden swords easily pierced the protective divine light of even Double Supreme Divine Venerates. He had never seen such a terrifyingly sharp metal energy before.

Following that, a grand woman in a golden dress, her hair elegantly styled in a high bun, descended from the heavens above. Her holy radiance illuminated this entire world, akin to a golden war goddess.

“May I ask who you…?” Guo Ran cupped his fists toward her.

Suddenly, Guo Ran’s vision flickered, and before him, another person appeared. Startled, he jumped in shock, for this person had seemingly appeared out of nowhere, without any prior indication. Guo Ran hadn’t sensed him at all.

“Boss Guo Ran! You are definitely boss Guo Ran, right?” asked this youngster standing in front of Guo Ran excitedly.

“Xiaole, you fool! Hurry up and help!” shouted the woman covered in golden divine radiance.

“Oh, I’m coming.” After that, the youth rapidly formed hand seals. As three flower pupils appeared in his eyes, the world before him twisted.

“Get out of here!”

Heaven and earth contorted, causing the experts approaching from the opposite direction to vanish instantaneously. Seeing this scene, Guo Ran and Xia Chen only stood in stunned silence, their jaws dropping in disbelief at the bewildering sight before them.
