Chapter 4785 Pulling Off a Sinister Trick

When Evilmoon descended, the ten thousand Daos cried out as it blasted those mountains apart one by one.

These mountains stood as manifestations of the Earth Dao’s laws, forged through countless years of this Earth Saint's pure power. Their formidable might even surpassed that of his own Saint weapon.

Despite their practically indestructible nature, each mountain crumbled like mere heaps of flour before Long Chen’s onslaught. Prior to obtaining Evilmoon, Long Chen possessed powerful astral energy but lacked a vessel that could fully contain and unleash it.

Now that Evilmoon was back, Long Chen no longer had anything holding him back. He concentrated all his astral energy into one attack. As a result, Evilmoon blasted through the mountains like a hot knife through butter before finally colliding with the Earth Saint’s sword.

Following that, a shocking scene appeared in front of everyone. In a breathtaking display, Evilmoon's edge sliced through the Earth Saint's Saint weapon with ease. Astonishment rippled through the onlookers as the Earth Saint’s chest bore the brunt of the attack, which caused blood to spurt out. Like a sandbag, he was sent hurtling through the air.

“He lost! Long Chen has just defeated an Earth Saint!” Countless startled cries rang out. If they hadn’t personally witnessed it, they wouldn’t believe it. A Divine Venerate had just beaten an Earth Saint.

After destroying the Saint weapon, Long Chen summoned lightning wings on his back and shot after the Earth Saint who had now lost his ability to resist. Now was the best chance to kill him.

“You little brute, a demon like you can’t be left alive!” The other Earth Saint of the Celestial race roared and swung his own sword, causing the void to twist and thousands of mountains to appear once more.

“Despicable!”

“Shameless!”

“The Celestial race is full of scum!”

Once again, curses and condemnation erupted from the onlookers, directed toward the shameless tactics of the Celestial race. This shameless expert had previously attempted a sneak attack and now repeated the same treacherous act. From this one attack, they could tell that he had long since started accumulating power.

In stark contrast, Long Chen had spent a great deal of energy fighting the other Earth Saint. Seeing an Earth Saint resorting to a sneak attack against an exhausted opponent, everyone’s eyes had been opened to the world.

However, Long Chen completely ignored this attack, even daring to expose his back to it without a hint of concern.

“I’ve seen shamelessness, but never this much.” A voice rang out.

Just then, a handsome swordsman shot past Long Chen and reached for the sword on his back, his sharp gaze locked onto the second Earth Saint.

As Yue Zifeng appeared, the second Earth Saint felt that he couldn’t lock on Long Chen anymore. Simultaneously, he felt like Yue Zifeng’s eyes were expanding, as if a pair of heavenly divine eyes were now locked onto him from above the nine heavens.

“Brat, you are courting death! You can die together with Long Chen!” The second Earth Saint was enraged at having lost his lock on Long Chen. With a furious roar, he switched his target to Yue Zifeng.

An uproar exploded amongst the crowd as they hadn’t expected another young man to appear on Long Chen’s battlefield. This young man had to be one of Long Chen’s subordinates as he had stood behind Long Chen at the start. However, he dared to face an Earth Saint.

On the other hand, Long Chen seemed to have expected this and allowed Yue Zifeng to fight the Earth Saint. At this moment, Yue Zifeng’s voice rang out clearly.

“I walked through mountains of corpses and seas of blood, transcending the shackles of heaven and earth.

“From the mortal to the immortal, no one could halt my advance.

“From weak to strong, no obstacles could bar my path.

“In the realm of dust and ashes, across the sea of sorrow, through the nine heavens and ten lands, there is nothing I cannot cut. Say my name loud and clear...”

As Yue Zifeng chanted, a tempestuous wind whipped through his hair and robes, gathering all the murderous intent lingering within heaven and earth, leaving not even a trace behind.

His sword quivered with excitement, radiating an unparalleled sharpness that seemed to cut through the very world. When Yue Zifeng finished chanting, his sword suddenly went still, and the world plunged into deathly silence. A single name resounded throughout the world like thunder.

“Wavecutter!”

The moment Yue Zifeng’s sword fell, all the mountains that this Earth Saint had summoned were sliced in half. Behind them, blood sprayed out of the Earth Saint’s mouth, and the mighty pressure of an Earth Saint deflated like a popped balloon.

“That sword damaged his core, and there’s no way he can recover without a few centuries of rest!” one experienced elder cried out, his gaze sharp and heavy. He was an Earth Saint who had been disguising himself as an ordinary Sage King. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

As a fellow Earth Saint, he was profoundly shaken by the display before him. Yue Zifeng's attack had effortlessly cleaved through the Earth Dao's laws. Never before had this Earth Saint encountered such a formidable sword cultivator, nor had he witnessed such a terrifying manifestation of sword will.

While Long Chen had previously demonstrated a power beyond the Heavenly Daos, now Yue Zifeng had achieved the same thing through completely different means. This was a sword that sent shivers down the spines of even Earth Saints.

“Are all youngsters so terrifying these days? I think I will go into hiding so I don’t have to worry about accidentally losing my life,” said another Earth Saint who had been concealing himself as a Sage King in the crowd.

“Heaven Saint, save me!”

Just then, a miserable cry rang out from Long Chen’s battlefield. Long Chen was just a few meters away from the first Earth Saint, and Evilmoon was practically stabbing into his butt.

However, Long Chen seemed to be in no rush to kill him and followed him. Even without a head, the Earth Saint cried out of his chest.

Evilmoon was following the Earth Saint wherever he went. Regardless of the Earth Saint's efforts to evade it, its tip seemed ready to claim his life at any given moment.

Hearing him cry out, everyone couldn’t help looking toward the spatial gate that Yue Wuxu had summoned. Long Chen had said that it was fake. However, after Long Chen had killed the Mortal Saint, this gate seemed to have changed, as if someone had modified it. Now the Earth Saint was begging for aid from the spatial gate.

“Long clan brat, you’ve gone too far. Do you really think that my Celestial race can’t deal with you?”

Suddenly, a silver spear flew out of the gate, passing by the Earth Saint’s neck and toward Long Chen.

This silver spear shook the very world with its supreme divine might, representing the very Heavenly Daos. It could not be defied.

“A Heaven Saint’s weapon!” Startled cries rang out. When the Celestial race mobilized a Heaven Saint, no one condemned them for being shameless anymore because the only thing they could feel now was terror.

“Your Celestial race needs to send a Heaven Saint to take action against a single Divine Venerate. Doesn’t that precisely mean that your Celestial race is unable to deal with me?” sneered Long Chen. Rather than getting angry, he smiled as if he had just achieved his goal. All of a sudden, a bronze cauldron appeared in his hand. He then threw it at the spear and flew back, covering his ears.
