Chapter 1604 Blood Essence Stone, Blood Soul Stone

Translator: BornToBe

Long Chen looked at where Xie Qianqian was pointing and saw a nine-colored whirlpool that had a large black hole in its center.

When he saw the red, orange, yellow, green, azure, blue, violet, black, and white colors intertwining, he suddenly felt the Nine Star Hegemon Body Art form an indescribable resonance with it. It began to circulate on its own, and the Five Star Battle Armor almost activated.

“Will the Nine Star Hegemon Body Art follow these nine colors as well? The first five stars caused the divine ring to become red, orange, yellow, green, and azure. Nine stars... nine springs. Is there some kind of connection? But why do I feel like that’s not entirely right either?” wondered Long Chen.

He felt the Nine Star Hegemon Body Art react to the gathering of the nine springs, but there also seemed to be something different about them. One was a dragon, one was a snake. They looked similar but were completely different species. This feeling was indescribable. To sum up, this feeling was simply very strange.

“Long Chen, do you have any way to get those crystals on the ground?” Seeing that Long Chen was staring blankly, Xie Qianqian thought he was stunned by the sight, so she pulled his attention to the treasures.

Only then did Long Chen recover. Now, they were even closer to the whirlpool, and the flying boat was constantly shaking.

There was a huge twister where the nine streams gathered. It was roaring like a dragon.

If someone were to be sucked into that twister, they would probably be instantly torn to pieces.

However, not far from there, there was a plot of land that had been eroded for countless years. Many criss-crossing and deep ditches were present on it.

The deep ditches revealed large crystals at the bottom. Each of them was several meters long, and they came in different colors.

“The flying boat is unable to get any closer. Otherwise, we might get sucked into the core,” said Xie Qianqian. This was the limit.

However, even at this distance, the closest white-colored crystal was several miles away.

Her flying boat was not a combat flying boat. Its projectile range was limited. She could only look at those crystals but not obtain them.

Long Chen sank into thought. He waved his hand, and a flying hook appeared with a long chain at the end.

This was a corrupt weapon. He didn’t even remember its usage. Just now, he had randomly seen it while flipping through the primal chaos space.

He threw it out. Its chain was very long and flexible. It quickly reached the first crystal.

However, that was when a problem occurred. The suction force was too great, and it caused the hook to be drawn over. There was no way for it to land on the crystal.

Xie Qianqian was watching anxiously. If Long Chen could succeed, they would make a terrifying profit.

Long Chen snorted and swung his arm. The claw whipped away from the hurricane and wrapped around a portion of the exposed crystal like a python.

Long Chen pulled, and the crystal was slowly torn out of the ground. In the end, Long Chen managed to obtain it.

When the white crystal landed on the flying boat, Xie Qianqian let out a cheer. “This should be a life spirit crystal. There’s immense life energy inside. If placed in water, it would create a pool of life spirit water in just a few years.”

Long Chen nodded. This life energy could be useful to him, but not that useful. He couldn’t wait for years.

“Let’s put it away for now and get some more. We’ll split them in the end,” said Long Chen.

“Alright.” Xie Qianqian was incredibly excited. She hadn’t expected Long Chen to have this much ability. He was actually able to bring so many things from the outside world into the Netherworld.

This time, the crystal Long Chen pulled over was a blood-red one. It was a bit demonic and looked like there was blood flowing inside it. However, with the crystalline exterior, it was impossible to sense the fluctuations on the inside.

“Let me appraise it.” Xie Qianqian placed it on a strange device of her flying boat. Dozens of tentacles stuck onto the crystal, and various runes revolved around it. Characters that Long Chen couldn’t understand appeared on the control panel.

“This is a blood soul stone. A normal blood soul stone will be considered top grade if it reaches a soul energy level of eight thousand points; however, this one has reached three million soul energy points. Heavens, how shocking!” Xie Qianqian was completely stunned by its energy readings.

“Is it useful?” asked Long Chen.

“This blood soul stone is one of the products of my Alldevil star-field. The ancient battlefields between the human race and the Alldevil race result in two kinds of crystals. The Alldevil race’s blood essence and souls are very powerful, and once they’re killed, their corpses will gradually condense these kinds of crystals after tens of thousands of years. Those crystals are split into two kinds, blood essence stones and soul stones. Both crystals are priceless treasures that can upgrade the power of a person’s physical body or soul. My guess is this blood soul stone is the result of those monsters on the bridges from when you first enter the Netherworld. They’re gathering all that energy to condense these stones,” said Xie Qianqian.

“Yes, I saw them too. Now that you say that, why is it that we would all advance together here if we aren’t on the same planes?” asked Long Chen.

This was something he had been very curious about, and now he was reminded of it.

“I’m not sure. According to ancient records, this world is not a complete world, and the laws are chaotic. According to reason, each region should be operating according to its own functions. However, I saw all kinds of lifeforms I’ve never seen before upon coming here. I don’t know why either,” said Xie Qianqian.

She continued, “Alright then, don’t interrupt again or I’ll lose my train of thought. That monster you just mentioned, it kills those roaming souls and the experts who attack them, inserting their blood and souls into the orbs on the bridge. Through my own observation, I found that the energy they’re absorbing slowly fades away, and there’s no way to tell where it’s going. However, based on this blood soul stone, I’ve started to form a hypothesis. According to reason, even in the Life and Death realm- ah, that is the Netherpassage realm, people do not have such powerful souls. There must be some kind of law present that is further purifying their essence to condense these blood soul stones. If a cultivator were to absorb such a thing, they would be able to upgrade their Yuan Spirit a second time. It could be said that they are heaven-defying treasures. Unfortunately, the Alldevil star-field’s human race doesn’t specialize in physical strength or Spiritual Strength. Otherwise, we’d have long since defeated the despicable Alldevil race.”

“If you don’t have talent in regards to the physical body or the spiritual body, how do you fight back at all?” asked Long Chen.

“Naturally it’s with our wits. We’ve created many powerful weapons, flying boats, sets of armor, warships, and other treasures that can increase our power by hundreds or thousands of times. With defensive structures and the skills of our craftsmen, we can use various natural resources to create divine items. Regretfully...” Here, Xie Qianqian’s expression became angry and distressed.

“Regretfully, while it’s possible to defend against the frightening Alldevil race, it’s the enemies that lie beside us that we can’t defend against. Or perhaps it’s more accurate to say it’s impossible to defend against their greed. In the past few centuries, we’ve been constantly losing to the Alldevil race, not because we aren’t strong enough, but because our commanders are all a bunch of useless pieces of garbage. They are all ‘geniuses’, but they only go to the battlefield to dredge up profits for themselves. In truth, their abilities are inferior to even dogshit. If they were just dogshit, then that would be something, but despite being amateurs, they have to act like experts. Most hateful of all, they’re supported by powerful idiots who clearly know the battle plan is wrong, but instead of punishing them, they blame the fighters. My parents died because of them. That's why I chose to attend the best academy. I’m not only going to kill the Alldevil race’s monsters, but I’ll also be cleaning up our human race’s degenerates.”

“I wish you luck.”

In the end, all Long Chen could say was such a thing. He didn’t have high hopes for her.

Based on what she said, the Alldevil star-field’s human race was also a group of greedy degenerates. A force that was rotten to that extent couldn’t be saved.

It was no different from the Martial Heaven Continent. Long Chen had never even had a thought to try and draw everyone into the Righteous path, nor had he ever thought about erasing the greed and wickedness in the hearts of the Righteous path.

That was because he was well aware of his own capabilities, and such a task was impossible for him. Let alone him, it was impossible even for a god.

If gods really could do such a thing, then everyone’s faiths would be united. However, because there were so many differences of opinion, there were just as many different faiths. If such a thing was possible, these faiths wouldn’t be contradictory and ignite conflict after a battle. Or... perhaps this was just the Dao. The merciless and cruel Dao.

Long Chen continued grabbing the crystals. He obtained seven of the life spirit crystals and nine of the blood-colored crystals.

Through Xie Qianqian’s appraisal, she determined that of those nine blood-colored crystals, three were blood essence stones and three were blood soul stones.

Xie Qianqian didn’t need those, because the Alldevil star-field already had them. In fact, they had so many that they had to come up with ways to sell them to other star-fields. Other than needing to get through the layers of blockades of the Alldevil race, they also had to pay a high transportation fee. Their profits weren’t very high.

As a result, the blood-colored crystals went to Long Chen, while the life spirit crystals went to Xie Qianqian. However, Xie Qianqian didn’t have anywhere to store them. She had no choice but to pour out the life spirit water in her bottles and put the life spirit crystals inside. That aggrieved her, but there was nothing she could do. On the other hand, Long Chen simply sucked them into the primal chaos space.

The surrounding crystals were quickly pulled out. There were more ahead, but they were too close to the core, making the two of them not dare to approach. They began to slowly roam the outer regions, looking to get some more crystals.

However, the hurricane at the core rapidly expanded. It came without any warning at all.

“Run!” Long Chen’s expression changed, and he hastily pushed Xie Qianqian to send the flying boat running.

However, the flying boat had just started moving when a terrifying suction force came over them. The flying boat began to fly toward the hurricane out of their control.
