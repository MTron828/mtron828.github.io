That elder took out a spherical object, showing it off as he said, “The Brahma secret realm is open to everyone here, but there are parts of it that contain the inheritance of our gods. I’m sure everyone here knows that no sect would allow others to enter such areas. We are only opening those areas to our allies. In other words, the disciples of Pill Valley, the ancient races, the Corrupt path, the ancient family alliance, the Xuan Beasts, the Bloodkill Hall, and some loyal Righteous sects will be allowed in. We’ve given them special barrier breaking beads that will allow them to enter the core of the Brahma secret realm. That place is protected by a divine formation, and there, you can gather spirit medicines, receive all kinds of inheritances, maybe even get the gods’ blessing and instantly awaken your manifestation...”

As expected, it was this plot again. There was no such thing as a free lunch, and neither was there a free breakfast or dinner. As a result, the neutral camp’s experts’ expressions changed. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

They weren’t fools. They knew what Pill Valley was trying to do. But even though they knew it, they couldn’t resist this temptation. Opening the Brahma secret realm to them for free was already generous. Hence, for them to leave the best stuff for their allies wasn’t something that they could complain about.

“May I ask what kind of benefits we will get if we swear loyalty to Pill Valley? And what about the disadvantages?” asked one disciple.

“The benefits are that you will be able to enter the core of the Brahma secret realm. That place has several times the Heavenly Dao energy as outside-” said the elder.

“Several times?!”

“The Heavenly Dao energy on the outer edges is already so dense! Several times that? What kind of concept is that?!”

“Doesn’t that mean that the odds of us awakening our manifestations will multiply as well?!”

Quite a few disciples’ eyes lit up, and they began to exclaim in delight.

Could they be any more fake? Long Chen looked at their act and almost vomited. These disciples were definitely planted there by Pill Valley. It was too obvious.

Those disciples’ exaggerated reactions had completely sold them out. They hadn’t even seen what was in the core region, but their eyes were about to pop out.

Having lived in the secular world, Long Chen had gotten bored of this kind of play in the Phoenix Cry Empire, and now he was seeing the same thing in the cultivation world. Were they insulting other people’s intelligence?”

“You are all correct. Not only will the chances of awakening your manifestation increase, but there are all kinds of inheritances spread throughout that region. If you’re lucky, you might even obtain an eleventh tier medicinal pill,” said the elder.

“An eleventh tier medicinal pill?!”

People’s hearts shook. Was this supposed to mean that even Pill Valley couldn’t refine eleventh tier medicinal pills, and they could only be procured in the Brahma secret realm?

That couldn’t be right. Pill Valley wouldn’t allow an eleventh tier medicinal pill to fall into the hands of an outsider. An eleventh tier medicinal pill either had to be a legend, or it had to belong to them. Long Chen suddenly realized where the con lay. It lay in the fact that he said if their luck was good. But if their luck wasn’t good?

An uproar was occurring amongst the other experts. An eleventh tier medicinal pill was extremely alluring, as no one in the outside world had ever seen one before. Some people had never even heard of such a thing.

If they had an eleventh tier medicinal pill, then no matter what its effect was, it could change the life of a Life Star expert.

Even Long Chen wasn’t able to remain calm, let alone the others. Although they also saw that this was just a play from Pill Valley, the bait was truly amazing.

“Those who become Pill Valley’s allies can enter the core of the Brahma secret realm. You can search for medicinal pills, inheritances, precious spirit plants, minerals, etc. There is even the chance of obtaining god’s blessing. However, these benefits aren’t Pill Valley’s charity. The core region will not be opened for free. To become Pill Valley’s ally and enter the core region, you must promise to come out and fight for Pill Valley when we try to save the continent and suppress evil. Of course, the chance of a fight is very low. You’ve also seen how strong our current alliance is. As long as even a portion of you awaken your manifestations, we’ll be able to easily crush the Martial Heaven Alliance and the Dragonblood Legion. With such a power disparity, they aren’t even qualified to fight against us. If you join us, it would mostly just be a show of power. The odds of a battle are very, very low.”

The elder spoke confidently as if he didn’t place the Martial Heaven Alliance or the Dragonblood Legion in his eyes. As for the crowd of experts, they acknowledged his words. With so many experts gathered, crushing the Martial Heaven Alliance would certainly be easy.

However, even though the ancient races, the Xuan Beasts, the Corrupt path, and the ancient family alliance were allied with Pill Valley, their own internal structures were complicated. They weren’t as united as Pill Valley and the Bloodkill hall.

Their leaders, and thus, the alliance, could only order a small portion of them. When it came to the majority, some might support them and some might not.

If those people supported them, then there would be no need for Pill Valley to even open up the Brahma secret realm. They would have crushed Long Chen during his tribulation.

However, now they had been forced to toss out such huge bait, and it was truly too great for anyone to resist. If these experts wanted to enter the core region, then they had to become solid allies with Pill Valley.

“Of course, we won’t force you. Every person has the right to decide for themselves. Some people don’t want to join not because they’re afraid, but because they prefer their freedom and don’t want to cause trouble...” said the elder.

“I’m joining! Isn’t it just the Dragonblood Legion? I’m not afraid of them!”

“Long Chen? Hmph, I’ve long since wanted to cut off his head. I’m willing to join as well.”

“Me too. As a cultivator, if I didn’t even have this little bit of daring, how would I even cultivate?”

Quite a few of the neutral camp’s experts stepped forward, indicating that they wished to join Pill Valley’s side. Long Chen cursed them inside. Even though he wasn’t even doing anything, they were cursing him. If he didn’t slap them silly, he wouldn’t be Long Chen.

“Wait a moment.” Unexpectedly, the elder waved his hand to cut off those people. “Young people should consider their decisions first. Once you decide, you won’t be able to change your decision. I will distribute the barrier breaking beads to everyone here. You can enter the secret realm first and then decide if you wish to enter the core. When the time comes, don’t say that Pill Valley is conning you with fake promises. If you find that the core region is truly as alluring as I’ve said, you can crush your barrier breaking beads to enter. Let me just make one thing clear though. These beads contain the power of the gods. There are contractual runes inside, and once crushed, it indicates that you have sworn to be allies with Pill Valley. If you try to betray this oath, you will be cursed by the gods. It’s extremely serious, so be clear on this. There are actually quite a few good spots in the outer regions of the Brahma secret realm that you can use to cultivate and increase your comprehension. Perhaps you will be able to find some opportunity within some ruins. Alright, that’s all I have to say. I trust you all understand. The channel has fully stabilized, so let’s draw lots to see who goes first.”

The elder took out a tile. Once he put his Spiritual Strength inside, numbers appeared. It was a tool used for drawing lots.

The representatives from the various major factions came forward. The result was that the ancient family alliance’s side would be the first batch to enter. Those who belonged to the alliance directly entered, while those that were part of the ancient family alliance but hadn’t expressed their support for Pill Valley were given barrier breaking beads.

There were many experts from the ancient family alliance. As they entered, the others were forced to make room for them to pass. Long Chen was standing in his original location, but two women ended up having to get out of the way, resulting in them getting closer to him.

The two of them were Qi Xuan and Qi Fengxue from the Heaven Reaching Ancient Castle. When they ended up pushed closer to him, Qi Xuan looked up at him fearfully and recoiled. Long Chen’s current appearance was a bit frightening.

Suddenly, some of the ancient family alliance’s disciples ended up crashing toward Qi Fengxue. Perhaps they were too excited or pushed by others.

Qi Fengxue frowned and summoned a barrier of spiritual qi to stop them. As a result, one of them ended up striking her so hard that she was sent reeling back.

Qi Fengxue was infuriated, and she was about to curse that person when that person hastily said, “Sorry, truly sorry. It was my mistake. Let me apologize to senior apprentice-sister Qi! Aiya!”

The person was in the midst of apologizing. But as a result of stopping all of a sudden, he was struck by someone else moving forward, sending him staggering closer to Qi Fengxue.

As a result, the scene became a bit chaotic. The disciple hastily reached out to grab the startled Qi Fengxue, reaching out for her butt.

Long Chen saw it clearly and was infuriated at this bastard’s shamelessness. Without any hesitation, he kicked that pervert on the butt.

A cracking sound rang out as his tailbone shattered. A heart-wrenching screech rang out as he soared into the sky.

“What’s going on?!” The elder’s expression darkened, angered by the disturbance.

“This bastard wanted to take advantage of this lady. I found it disdainful, so I kicked him,” said Long Chen indifferently.

“That’s... nonsense!”

The wretched man flying through the air landed on the ground. He was holding his buttocks and was in so much pain that he was drenched with cold sweat. This kick of Long Chen’s was truly vicious. The power of the azure dragon was constantly wracking this man’s body, making it so that he couldn’t heal.

That elder coldly looked at that person and then at Long Chen. He shouted, “There will be no further exceptions!”

When Long Chen saw that elder’s expression, as well as the wretched man cursing, his eyes narrowed slightly.
