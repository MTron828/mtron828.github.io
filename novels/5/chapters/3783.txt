Chapter 3772: Heaven-Defying Wills Clash

BANG!

Long Chen unleashed a simple punch against Kun Tu’s claws. Neither of them used divine abilities. Just relying on the power of their physical bodies, they made a raging qi wave erupt. But the next moment, sharp pain came from Long Chen’s fist. Five bloody marks were left on it by Kun Tu’s claws.

“Boss!”

Jiang Lei was shocked. Just how powerful was Long Chen’s physical body? Jiang Lei had personally witnessed his power, but Long Chen was actually injured by Kun Tu.

“You think you can block me with just your physical body? A mantis stopping a cart, an ant shaking a tree; absolutely laughable!”

Kun Tu retrieved his claws, which were stained by golden blood. It was Long Chen’s true dragon essence blood.

Kun Tu then stuck out his tongue and lightly licked his claws. As he did so, his eyes narrowed slightly, and a cold smile appeared on his face.

“The dragon race’s flesh and blood really is delicious. It’s just a shame that it’s mixed with the flavor of the human race. You’ve ruined its original flavor. Long Chen, you really deserve death!”

The current Kun Tu was like a bloodthirsty devil. His killing intent seemed to have been stimulated by the dragon blood. Now, his Blood Qi rumbled, and a terrifying pressure was unleashed, almost suffocating the experts in the surroundings. Even Supreme experts felt miniscule in front of that aura.

Long Chen looked at the broken scales on his hand. His skin had been broken in five places, and golden blood dripped out of those wounds. At this moment, the primal chaos space’s energy flowed in but only caused those injuries to slowly close. There was no instantaneous recovery.

“Amazing. An attack containing the will of the Kunpeng that can transcend the Heavenly Daos. I didn’t expect you to have such a power.” Long Chen’s gaze sharpened. His battle intent continued to climb.

It was Long Chen’s first time encountering such a thing. The Kunpeng race was truly worthy of being a heaven-defying existence. However, this injury didn’t make Long Chen afraid and instead only stimulated his will to fight even more.

“I also have this power? How interesting. Are you saying that you also possess this kind of power?” sneered Kun Tu.

Long Chen lightly clenched his hand. The injury finally healed. “Of course. I also possess this power.”

“Hahaha!” Kun Tu raised his head and laughed as if he had just heard the world’s funniest joke. “You have this power as well?! The inferior human race also possesses the power to defy the heavens?! Your dragon blood isn’t even the ancestral dragon blood, and yet you speak of heaven-defying power? Are you trying to make me laugh to death?”

Long Chen shook his head. “My heaven-defying power doesn’t stem from true dragon essence blood… it stems from myself.”

Suddenly, Long Chen unsheathed the Minghong Saber, and a domineering and wild will erupted. He then slashed his saber.

BOOM!

When Long Chen’s saber clashed with Kun Tu’s sharp claws, two formless yet substantial wills clashed. A pillar of light then soared into the heavens, breaking through the sky, shaking the stars high above.

At that moment, the wind and clouds changed color. The world almost shattered as all kinds of strange phenomena instantly descended. As a result, countless Grand Dao runes crashed as if the end of the world had come.

The eruption of both of their wills caused the surrounding experts to flee in terror. Their souls quaked and their bodies quivered. This was a fear that came from the depths of their soul.

The Heavenly Daos. Everyone had to be respectful of them, and they couldn’t even think of defying them. But those who did defy the heavens were above the Heavenly Daos. Such existences possessed absolutely terrifying mental energy.

Although this kind of energy was unable to cause direct damage, it could completely obliterate a person’s confidence, making them too terrified to even think about fighting.

At this moment, the sky shook and the ten thousand Daos roared. Kun Tu and Long Chen looked at each other, both of their gazes almost exploding with fire. As both of them possessed the power to defy the heavens, they tried to suppress the other side’s will.

“The human race also has a heaven-defying will? Stop joking around. Your human race is the lowest of all races. You struggled at the bottom and were enslaved for countless years. The ‘slave’ character has long since been imprinted into the depths of your soul! You are only fit to be lowly slaves!” shouted Kun Tu, his battle intent climbing.

“The cycle turns; the Heavenly Daos remain in motion. In this world, no one remains at the bottom forever. In the same vein, no one remains at the top forever. Do you think that your Kunpeng race can rely on an undefeatable legend to forever shine? If you really were so great, you wouldn’t beg for mercy from the dragon race just to survive,” sneered Long Chen.

Whenever Long Chen mentioned the Kunpeng race submitting to the dragon race, Kun Tu was enraged. His eyes turned scarlet, and endless killing intent erupted from within him.

BOOM!

Suddenly, the space behind Kun Tu exploded and a giant illusory figure spread. It was enormous, so big that it covered the entire sky and more. People couldn’t even see its whole body.

At the same time, a terrifying desolate qi radiated from it. All the experts present grunted as a violent power struck them and sent them flying. They barely managed to stabilize themselves many miles away.

At this great distance, they could finally see that the illusory figure was a giant fish-shaped lifeform. Its aura caused their souls to shake, and its black eyes in particular were so imposing that no one dared to look at them directly. It was like just a look would suck in their souls.

“It’s the ancestral Kun!”

In the immortal world, people had seen the Peng, but they had never seen the Kun. That was because the Kun was a lifeform of the mortal world. It was not possible to see them in the immortal world.

Only when they ascended from the mortal world would the Kun appear in the form of the Peng. Thus, the immortal world had countless Peng races, but no one had ever seen the Kun, let alone the ancestral Kun that walked through tribulation after tribulation, trial after trial.

At this moment, the ancestral Kun manifestation distorted this entire world. It was like this world could not contain it. The Heavenly River Blood Sea even started subsiding, and huge waves exploded out of it. At the same time, it seemed that something within the blood sea began to move.

“What a terrifying aura!”𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

Long Chen was also shocked by this manifestation. It was his first time feeling such a terrifying aura, as even Divine Venerates didn’t possess such auras.

When Kun Tu unleashed his manifestation, Long Chen’s divine ring automatically appeared, along with his Six Star Battle Armor. Long Chen didn’t dare to be careless against Kun Tu. He had to unleash his full power as well.

“Inferior human race, do you think that the great Kunpeng race is something that you can speak of? Die!” roared Kun Tu. Long Chen had brought up the Kunpeng’s submission to the dragon race twice now. That was a part of the history that the Kunpeng race refused to admit to. Kun Tu then attacked with his claws once more.

At the same time as he moved, the ancestral Kun in his manifestation suddenly quivered. Water-like ripples then flowed into Kun Tu’s arm.

As a result, the void shattered and a monstrous fish mark appeared on Kun Tu’s claws. That was the image of the ancestral Kun.

Countless stars shook in the sky, with one star after another lighting up. Once they lit up, stars also lit up on Long Chen’s Minghong Saber.

“Drawing stars into the body, Split the Heavens 3!”

Long Chen slashed his saber with all his power, wielding it with both hands. A violet starry river then slashed down on Kun Tu’s claw.
