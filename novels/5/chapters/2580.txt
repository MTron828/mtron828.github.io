Chapter 2569 The Secret of Resentful Death City

“Resentful Death City?”

Long Chen was started. This was one of the Martial Heaven Continent’s seven great danger zones.

These danger zones weren’t all there at the start. For example, the Heaven Devouring Forest had only appeared when the Spirit World’s demonic trees invaded the Martial Heaven Continent, creating an area that was too dangerous to cross.

However, the Heaven Devouring Forest had been destroyed by Long Chen, removing it from the rankings of the danger zones. Compared to the other danger zones, the Heaven Devouring Forest was nothing.

Devil Spirit Mountain, the Yin Yang World, the Ancient Battlefield, the Corrupt God Cemetery, and the Martial Heaven Sea-Ring were all danger zones that Long Chen had come into contact with. The only one he hadn’t encountered was Resentful Death City. This name was rarely mentioned, so he had almost forgotten about it.

Qu Jianying said, “The origin of Resentful Death City is very vague. It is said it was the first city to be destroyed on the continent during the battle of the immortal era. Legend has it that the Martial Heaven Continent was practically limitlessly large back then unlike now, and that city was sent into a bottomless abyss during the battle. After that, it became a channel between the Martial Heaven Continent and another world. There are only two entrances on the Martial Heaven Continent to Resentful Death City. One lies with the divine families, while another is in the hands of the Corrupt path. The divine families’ entrance was created by them artificially, but the true channel is behind the Corrupt God Cemetery. By controlling Resentful Death City, the Corrupt path has a hand over the threat of the Martial Heaven Continent.”

“Resentful Death City? What is so amazing about it?” asked Long Chen.

This was Long Chen’s first time hearing Qu Jianying tell him so many secrets of the continent. When she said that the continent was almost limitless in size back then, he thought of Ming Cangyue’s words about how it was the core of a star-field. That supported Qu Jianying’s words.

“Resentful Death City was once the Martial Heaven Continent’s strongest city, and also the place with the most intense fights against the demon devil world. It is said that Resentful Death City was the size of the current Martial Heaven Continent. After that battle, the city was dyed red by the blood of gods. Corpses filled the city. The resentment that accumulated there is simply incalculable, and there are also countless treasures and divine abilities from the immortal era. However, the air of resentment is too strong. Unless you are a peak expert, just entering the city will cause your mind to break down. The Corrupt God Cemetery is linked to Resentful Death City. So, the Corrupt path is in control of the gates to the city…”

“You mean that they can open those gates and unleash the air of resentment onto the Martial Heaven Continent, destroying it?” asked Long Chen.

Qu Jianying shook her head. “No, that resentment is locked behind the world barrier. It cannot enter the Martial Heaven Continent. Even if the Corrupt path did have a way to break the barrier, that resentment would be suppressed by the laws of the continent. The true danger is the corpses in the Corrupt God Cemetery. Every generation of the Corrupt path will have their top experts buried in the Corrupt God Cemetery. Actually, rather than say they are buried, it would be more accurate to say that they are turned into puppets. After so many years, it’s unknown just how many puppets the Corrupt path has accumulated. Although they’ve kept it secret, we know that they’ve been using Resentful Death City’s air of resentment to nourish those puppets. If they are forced to the brink, they will unleash those puppets and bring forth a terrifying tribulation. At such a critical time, if you had chased down and slaughtered the Corrupt path’s final experts to the very last man, they would definitely unleash this trump card. Furthermore, they will open the gates of Resentful Death City and unleash the corpse devils inside. This is why the Corrupt path has survived for countless years. Even when Sovereigns appear, they cannot wipe out the Corrupt path because in their hands lies the power to destroy the Martial Heaven Continent.”

Long Chen’s expression grew ugly. No wonder Qu Jianying had some restraint when it came to the Corrupt path. So the Corrupt path had such a trump card.

“It doesn’t matter what the Sovereigns thought. I’ll wipe them out sooner or later.” Long Chen refused to believe that the Sovereigns hadn’t had the power to destroy the Corrupt path. Perhaps they had their own thoughts, but Long Chen didn’t care.

Next time, if the Corrupt path’s people appeared again, he would hunt them down. Simply being beaten without fighting back wasn’t his style.

Qu Jianying smiled. “I know. But even if you are to fight the Corrupt path, you should wait awhile. The Corrupt path’s experts have been dead for countless years. One year, two years, it doesn’t matter to them. But for you and your generation, the Martial Heaven Continent’s qi flow is now concentrated on you. You can all grow stronger with every passing day. If a clash with the Corrupt path is inevitable, it is more beneficial for you to wait as long as possible. Every extra day is a bit stronger that you will have grown.”

Long Chen nodded. That was reasonable. Time was most beneficial to them. However, he was not necessarily a reasonable man. Otherwise, he would not have crushed Zhao Ritian in front of everyone and given a vicious slap to the divine families.

His relationship with the divine families had turned icy. Even if his relationship with the Long family was not bad, the Long family still belonged to the divine families. They would still be speaking for the divine families.

“Old man, this matter has been settled. Can I train in the ninth form of Split the Heavens now?” asked Long Chen. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

“With such an attitude, you will definitely be unable to control the Heavens’ Wrath. It seems three days is too short,” snorted the old man.

Although he acted disdainful, he was quite pleased inside. The more urgently Long Chen wanted to learn this technique, the happier he was. After all, this was the strongest technique of the Heaven Splitting Battle Sect.

If Long Chen acted indifferent toward it, he would be angry. He was also anticipating the sight of Long Chen using the ninth form of Split the Heavens.

Since the old man refused to teach him and Qu Jianying had many things to handle, Long Chen decided to take his leave.

He returned to the Dragonblood Legion. He then saw the Dragonblood warriors still howling within the blood pool. Layers of their skin were constantly shedding as if they were boiling. Even Long Chen shivered. That kind of pain really wasn’t something an ordinary person could endure.

However, there were two people who weren’t howling. One was Yue Zifeng. Strange strands circulated around him, blocking the dragon blood.

As a sword cultivator, Yue Zifeng didn’t need the dragon blood to temper his body. He was simply using it to temper his own will.

The other person was Wilde. He was just lying down in the blood pool, sleeping. He had a half-eaten bone beside him that could be used as a pillow.

A huge amount of the dragon blood was converging on him. It seemed that all on his own, he was absorbing more dragon blood than all the Dragonblood warriors.

Long Chen extended a hand into the blood pool and sensed that a great deal of its energy had been used up.

He then injected more dragon blood into the pool. After that, he gave a thumbs-up to his brothers inside and left.

When he came to Guo Ran’s room, he heard that Guo Ran’s voice had turned hoarse, but it was still strong. That showed that he truly did have immense potential. He was still far off from his limit.

“Brothers, I can’t endure…” Xia Chen’s weak voice came from the other side of the wall.

“You have to endure. I was even able to endure this long. If a coward like me can do it, you definitely can do the same. Your will is stronger than mine!” shouted Guo Ran.

It seemed that he still didn’t know that Long Chen had conned him. He was even worried about Xia Chen. After all, Xia Chen was a formation cultivator with a weak physical body. Guo Ran didn’t just have to hold on himself, but he also had to encourage Xia Chen.

Long Chen almost laughed. He hadn’t expected Xia Chen’s acting to be so good. With him accompanying Guo Ran, Guo Ran would definitely be able to unleash his full potential.

Long Chen then took a glance at Xia Chen and saw him lying in the dragon blood, extremely relaxed and content. After that, he continued to walk further.

Just as Long Chen was approaching Meng Qi and the others’ room, before he even got to the door, Liu Ruyan’s icy voice rang out from within. “Who’s there?”

“Who else could it be?” demanded Long Chen. “Do you want some fresh blood? Can you not treat me like a thief?”

Laughter rang out from within. But when the door opened, the laughter was cut off.

No one had expected Liu Ruyan to actually open the door. As a result, dense blood-colored vapor came out of the room. Long Chen barely got a glimpse at some jade bodies when they all fled into the blood pool.

“Ruyan, what are you doing?” asked Chu Yao, embarrassed. Liu Ruyan had opened the door without warning.

“Ruyan, I feel like you aren’t all bad.” Long Chen laughed. For the first time, he found that Liu Ruyan also had a lovable side.

The door suddenly slammed shut on Long Chen just as he stepped forward. If he hadn’t dodged fast enough, his nose would have been flattened.

“Do I need your praise?” snorted Liu Ruyan.

More laughter rang out from within and Long Chen sighed. It seemed that he had gained too many wives. He was worried that they wouldn’t get along before, but now it seemed that they were too united. United against him…

Long Chen then returned to Guo Ran’s room, secretly adding some more dragon blood before leaving.

Based on Long Chen’s estimates, it would take seven days for them to undergo a complete transformation. He shouldn’t disturb them during this time.

At this moment, there was no need for him to refine pills. Hence, he had Huo Linger, the Demon Moon Furnace, and the Moon and Star Refining Furnace refining things on their own. Since the old man wanted him to wait three days, he had to find something to do.

After thinking about it, Long Chen chose to pay his respects to Daoist Heavenly Feather. He had to thank her for saving him.

Therefore, Long Chen now took a transportation formation directly to the Northern Xuan Region’s Divine Ice Palace.

“The palace master has been waiting for you.” Long Chen had just walked in when a disciple came to welcome him.
