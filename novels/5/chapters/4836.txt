Chapter 4825 Golden Devil Fall Tablet.

“Miss Yu Tong, don’t you think you are going too fast?” asked Long Chen, stunned. This woman was strange, acting so enthusiastically to the point that he didn’t know how to respond.

“Look!”

Yu Tong let go of Long Chen’s hand and showed the back of her hand. Seeing it, Long Chen was startled.

“What is that? A rune? A butterfly rune?” asked Mo Nian as he saw a multicolored mark on her hand.

Her mark was only the size of a soybean, looking like a butterfly but giving off no fluctuations.

“The Butterfly Spirit race’s mark? Are you related to the Butterfly Spirit race?” asked Long Chen as he came to a sudden realization. No wonder this woman acted so warmly toward him; she had probably sensed his blessing mark from the Butterfly Spirit race.

“We are from the Feather Spirit race, the protectors of the Butterfly Spirit race. Wow, I didn’t expect yours to be so big. It’s amazing!” Yu Tong looked at Long Chen excitedly. When Mo Nian heard this sentence, his jaw dropped even further.

Sweating, Long Chen asked, “Um, what exactly is so big? I have to trouble you to say it clearly.”

“Your blessing mark! Look!” Yu Tong grabbed Long Chen’s hand and compared them. Gradually, a multicolored butterfly mark appeared on the back of his hand as well, but his mark covered the entire back of his hand.

“Yes, it really is big.” Mo Nian nodded.

“Scram.” Long Chen pushed him away. This fellow’s expression was too vulgar, so he definitely thought of something dirty.

“Your blessing mark is even bigger than our race leader’s divine mark. That really is amazing,” praised Yu Tong worshipfully.

“Is there anything special about this mark?” asked Mo Nian curiously.

“Of course! Those blessed by the Butterfly Spirit race are all sages with light in their hearts. The bigger the mark, the stronger the light and kindness in their hearts,” replied Yu Tong.

“H... his heart has light and kindness?” Mo Nian pointed at Long Chen in disbelief.

“It’s rude to point at people! Also, you shouldn’t suspect the people marked by the Butterfly Spirit race, or we won’t like you,” declared Yu Tong, a bit angry at Mo Nian’s attitude.

“Alright, alright, I was wrong. I can suspect him, but I shouldn’t suspect the Butterfly Spirit race.” Mo Nian raised his hands in surrender, but the flavor behind his words was a bit off.

When Yu Tong saw Mo Nian apologize, her smile returned. She then reached out and grabbed Mo Nian’s hand as well. “This really is great. When we get into the city, how about you come as guests of the Feather Spirit race? Our princess is in the city, and she’ll also be very happy to see you both.”

Mo Nian instantly stiffened when Yu Tong grabbed his hand, as if he had just been struck by lightning. Although his looks and mouth were vulgar, he had never been close to a woman other than his fiancee Liu Zongying. As a result, he became a wooden statue when Yu Tong held his hand, and the hair on the back of his neck stood up. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Seeing this scene, Yu Fei clapped her hands excitedly. “Hehe, that would be great. Since you guys remain silent, can we treat it as a silent agreement?”

Long Chen and Mo Nian exchanged a look, both feeling helpless. Mo Nian had his own plans, but the enthusiasm of these two women was hard to refuse.

“What’s going on here? Is there going to be a party? If there aren’t enough men, plenty of my brothers here are itching to help.” Just then, several lecherous laughs rang out.

Long Chen and Mo Nian angrily turned back to see a group of experts walking over. Clad in beast furs, they looked like savages.

“Brothers, I don’t think the two of you will be able to put in enough work. Why don’t you let us help you?” chuckled the leader of these savages. He ignored their angry stares, his eyes roving over Yu Tong and Yu Fei without the slightest restraint.

Long Chen’s killing intent filled the air, and he slowly raised his hand. Seeing this scene, Yu Tong and Yu Fei hastily cried out, “Long Chen, don’t! It’s forbidden to fight here!”

“If I want to kill someone, the time and place don’t matter,” said Long Chen through clenched teeth.

“No, let me.”

Mo Nian suddenly moved like a phantom, leaving multiple afterimages as he traversed through the air.

Just like that, he smacked this group of over ten experts in the face. When Long Chen saw Mo Nian’s attack, he was stunned.

“How was that? I think I did pretty well learning this move.”

By the time Yu Tong and Yu Fei reacted, Mo Nian had returned to his original location, smiling proudly at Long Chen.

“Ah!”

It was only then that those experts let out screams akin to pigs being slaughtered. Mo Nian’s movements had been bizarre and too fast for them to track. Furthermore, they hadn’t been expecting it at all, given that fighting was forbidden here.

However, Mo Nian did indeed strike. Even if they had been on guard, evading that series of slaps would have likely proven impossible.

This move was Mo Nian’s imitation of Long Chen’s divine face-slapping art. Although it wasn’t as refined, his unusual movement style compensated for its shortcomings.

Most terrifying of all, despite the gentle nature of the slaps, every single one of them now had a black handprint on their faces.

Their mouths instantly started to rot after that handprint appeared, black water oozing out of them.

“Bastard, you’re courting death!” their leader roared. All of a sudden, a long rod appeared in his hand, and his Blood Qi erupted.

“It is forbidden to fight in front of Devil Fall City. Who dares to break this rule?” Just then, a cold shout rang out, and eight guards in silver armor appeared before them.

“Even the guards are extremely powerful Mortal Saints?” Long Chen was surprised. The guards in charge of watching the gate were actually Mortal Saints, showing that the Devil Fall City’s foundation was rather frightening.

“He was the one to attack first!”

The leader of these savages immediately pointed at Mo Nian furiously. With his mouth nearly rotted away, his voice was also affected, lending an even more startling and comical aspect to his righteous indignation.

“That’s right, I was the first to attack. I’m willing to offer this in exchange for a one-time pardon for my actions.” Mo Nian fearlessly took out a tablet with a golden devil head cast on it.

When the guards saw that tablet, they were all shocked.

“Golden Devil Fall Tablet!”
