Chapter 4256 Behind the Giant Gate

When the giant gate slowly opened, it felt like the gates of hell were opening. A terrifying voice then came from the other side, shaking everyone.

Along with that voice, there was also a surge of primal chaos qi. It just burst out of the gate, practically filling the entire Sage King Prefecture.

This primal chaos qi rejuvenated all the lifeforms present, no matter the race. Even the senior Heaven Venerates felt their bottlenecks loosening.

Every lifeform present instantly felt full of power. After all, the primal chaos qi possessed a powerful connection with the laws of heaven and earth, silently nourishing every expert present.

“The complete laws of heaven and earth!”

Screams of excitement rang out. This surge of primal chaos qi actually contained the complete laws of heaven and earth. It was what loosened the bottlenecks that had bound them for countless years.

In other words, many experts who had resigned themselves to never making further progress in their lifetimes now saw a renewed hope of reaching greater heights.

However, the human race’s experts were unable to shout in excitement. They also sensed that dense primal chaos qi and their bottlenecks loosening, but compared to that terrifying voice, none of that counted for anything.

“An Eternal expert!”

A terrified cry rang out from amongst the human race. Although that voice came from through the gate, they could still sense the air of Eternity coming from the voice, terrifying them. The master of this voice might very likely be an Eternal expert.𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

The karmic luck bead at the heart of the martial stage had exploded, sending fragments of karmic luck flying out in every direction.

However, the core of the karmic luck bead was still intact, as what had exploded was only its outer edge. The karmic luck bead still slowly spun, though it appeared to struggle, as if some unseen force constrained its movement.

The enormous gate slowly creaked open, but the gate seemed far too heavy. Only the tiniest crack opened, rendering everyone guessing what was inside.

However, as it opened, more primal chaos qi gushed into the world, stimulating the Sage King Prefecture’s vegetation to grow crazily. Just like that, the entire world thrummed with life as the primal chaos qi caused this place to completely transform.

“Kill!”

At this moment, countless lifeforms charged toward the karmic luck bead. The gate was of little concern to them; their sole focus was on acquiring the karmic luck fragments.

As the runes flew through the air, people reached out and grabbed them. The moment someone made contact with one of the runes, it would seamlessly merge into their bodies.

However, just as they grabbed them, they were quickly slain, and the runes were once again set free.

When people saw that they could get the runes through killing, madness overcame the crowd, leading to a brutal bloodbath. As they crazily grabbed the runes, they also mercilessly slaughtered one another. As a result, the weaker ones who managed to grab even a single rune were killed ruthlessly; it didn’t matter whether they came from the same race or family.

“They got the most! Kill them!”

A human expert eyed the Dragonblood Legion’s side. As they were the closest to the karmic luck eruption, their bodies had divine radiance flowing around them, clearly a sign of absorbing many karmic luck runes.

Hence, everyone’s eyes went red when looking at them. Long Chen had long since told Xia Chen to be prepared. The moment Long Chen killed a large batch of the devil race’s experts, Xia Chen activated a transportation formation.

As a result, they arrived just in time for the karmic luck fragments to erupt, successfully snatching the first wave. Shortly thereafter, they had managed to get a lot of those fragments. The likes of Meng Qi, Chu Yao, and the others had each acquired tens of thousands of those runes.

“We’re going!”

As Xia Chen shouted, space twisted and everyone on the Dragonblood Legion’s side once more vanished.

Those attacking experts wound up attacking nothing but air. As for the Dragonblood Legion and the others, they had already arrived beside the martial stage’s barrier. This was where they had originally been.

Xia Chen had used a fixed transportation formation to bring them back to the same location. It was precisely because it was a fixed transportation formation that he was able to do such a large-scale transportation.

Although the distance wasn’t particularly far, due to their numbers and strength, it was incredibly taxing. Xia Chen’s heart was dripping blood from the three thousand formation discs he had just used for these two transportations.

After all, crafting each formation disc required a considerable investment in both materials and labor. Such an enormous expenditure aggrieved him.

Nevertheless, this expenditure allowed them to devour the majority of the runes, so every single one of them had profited immensely.

Unfortunately, the crowd had come too quickly, giving them little time. If they had been given a bit more time, they could have devoured all the runes.

Xia Chen and the others managed to successfully retreat. However, the core region was now in chaos. These lifeforms were crazily slaughtering each other for the karmic luck fragments.

The situation was too chaotic. More blood was spilled with every passing moment, resulting in an incredibly gory scene.

Long Chen paid no heed to the chaos around, his gaze fixated on the gate. However, he still couldn’t see anything through the small crack.

Although primal chaos qi was pouring out of it and replenishing the energy of this world, filling the hole of this world, Long Chen kept feeling an intense sensation of crisis.

“Die!”

Just then, an explosive cry came from the Violet Pupil Nine Tail Fox and a shriek followed. Xu Xin-er was killed by its sharp claw.

As Xu Xin-er had been slain, the violet-gold bell was grabbed by the Violet Pupil Nine Tail Fox. It then shouted in excitement, directly hanging the bell around its neck.

“Xiaole, Little Nine, let’s work together to see what’s behind the gate,” transmitted Long Chen.

“Piece of cake.” The Violet Pupil Nine Tail Fox laughed. It was particularly arrogant now, as if it felt unrivaled.

Buzz.

The very fabric of space quivered, and Long Chen appeared atop the Violet Pupil Nine Tail Fox’s head. Bai Xiaole then formed hand seals, and the three flowers in his eyes spun, looking at that crack in the gate.

Long Chen and the Violet Pupil Nine Tail Fox closed their eyes together, borrowing Bai Xiaole’s eyes to look at that crack.

Through the crack, Long Chen saw a thriving world. The sky was a perfect azure blue, as if freshly cleansed. The verdant mountains and cerulean waters crafted a scene of a wonderland.

“Look down.”

Long Chen couldn’t look further, so he had Bai Xiaole look down. As their line of sight descended, Long Chen suddenly let out a pained grunt, while Bai Xiaole and the Violet Pupil Nine Tail Fox screamed. The Violet Pupil Nine Tail Fox’s eyes were bleeding.

“What did you see?” asked Mo Nian.

“Endless monsters of the devil race. They’re right at the gate, and just a look almost made our souls collapse,” responded Long Chen.

“We must destroy the karmic luck bead. Otherwise, once the gate opens, we’ll all be doomed,” said Mo Nian anxiously.

Long Chen might not have managed to sense that person’s aura, but for just a look to almost make his soul collapse, the latter probably was an Eternal expert.

Long Chen took a deep breath. “Let’s attack it together. No matter what, we must destroy the karmic luck bead.”

Meng Qi, Chu Yao, Tang Wan-er, Ye Zhiqiu, Dong Mingyu, Liu Ruyan, and the others made their preparations.

“Attack!”

Long Chen then shot toward the karmic luck bead with a bronze cauldron in his hand.
