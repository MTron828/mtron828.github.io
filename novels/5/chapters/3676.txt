Chapter 3665

Several spirit runes flashed endlessly. After that, a black figure spun through the air, dodging six times before one of the spirit runes pierced his head, killing him.

“Five hundred and seventeen. Boss, take them quick. We don’t want Guo Ran to be exposed.” Xia Chen handed the tablets to Long Chen. That way, Long Chen would have precisely nine hundred tablets.

Long Chen nodded. Although the assassins here were stronger, Xia Chen should be able to deal with them on his own. The real worry was Guo Ran.

At this moment, Long Chen’s bag lit up and a powerful spatial energy sucked his body away. He then appeared in front of a mountain gate.

When he arrived, he saw that there were over a hundred experts. Before he even had time to look for Guo Ran, he already heard Guo Ran’s voice.

“Don’t act like big shit in front of me! Do you believe me when I say that I’ll kill you with a single slap? It’s not like I ran into you on purpose, so if you can’t get over it, let’s just have a quick fight to the death!”

When Guo Ran was transported here, he was startled and instinctively struggled. Long Chen hadn’t even had time to tell him that he would automatically be transported away once he had enough tablets. After all, Guo Ran only had had so few tablets. No one had expected his luck to be so good as to get enough in one go.

Hence, Guo Ran thought that he had been discovered and tried to fight off the transportation, resulting in a slight deviation of the transportation and him crashing into someone else.

Every person here had their own space, around three hundred meters from each other. After all, considering that they were assassins, they had to maintain some safe distance from each other. If they were too close, they wouldn’t feel any sense of safety. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

However, Guo Ran ended up crashing into an assassin, causing that assassin to jump and automatically slash his sword at him. Fortunately, Guo Ran recalled Long Chen’s words and didn’t use his Supreme Bone to block. He instead used the sword taken from another disciple of the Nine Underworld Hall to parry the attack.

Guo Ran wasn’t skilled with the sword and was sent flying. But even then, that person didn’t let him off and directly unleashed a killing blow at him.

In his panic, Guo Ran used the arrow mechanism in his sleeve, forcing that person back. That gave Guo Ran a chance to breathe, and he couldn’t help cursing that fellow.

However, that person didn’t reply to Guo Ran’s cursing. The others were all seated in their own spots and looking at them coldly. They were also silent. The silence hanging in the air was rather frightening.

“What are you looking at?! Do you want to fight?!” shouted Guo Ran in front of those gazes.

That person continued eyeing Guo Ran for a little bit before returning to his own seat. Once he left, Guo Ran also found his own spot. Only then did he take note that Long Chen had also come. However, he didn’t dare to say anything to him.

Long Chen was speechless. This little fellow was a master at causing trouble. As an assassin, he had to maintain an absolute cool at all times. With this temper, how could he possibly fool anyone into thinking that he was an assassin?

Clearly, that person had taken note that Guo Ran wasn’t targeting him intentionally, and only then did he stop paying any attention to Guo Ran.

An assassin’s nerves had to be stretched taut at all times. Hence, when Guo Ran suddenly appeared, that assassin attacked him instinctively.

After this ruckus, the vicinity became calm again. Right now, Long Chen and Guo Ran were three spaces apart. In other words, between the time when Guo Ran and Long Chen entered, three people had also finished the trial and entered.

Following that, space began to quiver ever so slightly as one person after another appeared. They were all assassins that had managed to gather a sufficient number of tablets to be brought here. In just a few breaths’ time, over ten more people appeared.

Long Chen instantly started to worry. There were only three hundred places. As time passed, gathering a large number of tablets in one go would get easier. However, Long Chen didn’t know if Xia Chen could make it.

Fortunately, Xia Chen quickly came. He was number two hundred and forty-seven. Seeing him, Long Chen and Guo Ran sighed with relief.

Even as more people continued to be brought in, everyone was silent. It seemed that from the start, the only one to ever speak was Guo Ran.

When the three hundred spots were full, the mountain gate ahead of them rumbled and slowly opened.

A masked expert then appeared. This was a World King whose aura was transient; it appeared real and illusory at the same time. Upon seeing this World King, Long Chen’s heart shook. This was a formidable expert.

“Congratulations. You will be directly brought to the final Star Peering Heavenly Mirror Trial. However, before the trial, you will undergo a baptism of heavenly lightning. This heavenly lightning is the highest level reward of our Nine Underworld Hall from our sacred land, the Heavenly Lightning Divine Pool. It drives the Bloodkill Hall’s people crazy with jealousy. Through the baptism of the Heavenly Lightning Divine Pool, your essence, qi, and spirit will undergo a complete transformation. You all know the benefits, so I won’t go on and on about them.

“Once the Heavenly Lightning Divine Pool’s baptism is over, you will enter the Star Peering Heavenly Mirror Trial. Perhaps you’ve never heard of the Star Peering Heavenly Mirror, so I’ll give an explanation today. The Star Peering Heavenly Mirror is our heavenly eye for hunting down nine star heirs. It was personally made by Fallen Daynight. In the past, the trails that we gave you were transmitted to us by the Star Peering Heavenly Mirror. It overlooks the nine heavens and ten lands, sensing and calculating the locations of nine star heirs. It is the reason why you can find your targets. Today, your ultimate trial is within the Star Peering Heavenly Mirror. The Star Peering Heavenly Mirror is a priceless treasure. It can not only find nine star heirs, but it can also capture some nine star heirs and turn them into fighting puppets.

“Maybe you can already guess it. Your next trial will be to have a one-against-one fight against nine star heirs. If you win, your trial will be complete. But if you lose, you will die. This trial is different from before. What you are facing are nine star heirs in the same realm. Although they aren’t the strongest nine star heirs, they are above average. They perfectly suit your current power. However, you also know that nine star heirs are called the number one warriors of the nine heavens and ten lands. They are fearless. Based on past experience, at least half of you will die inside. You might even be fully wiped out. Be prepared,” announced that World King.

His voice was icy as hell, like he was truly a killing machine with no emotion. These assassins were the same, not giving off the slightest emotional ripple.

“According to the order of your tablets, enter the Heavenly Lightning Divine Pool!” said an expert that came to personally distribute new tablets.

Long Chen found that his tablet actually had an explanation about the Heavenly Lightning Divine Pool. After reading the introduction, Lei Linger was growing excited inside his body. Long Chen smiled slightly. It was finally time for Lei Linger to eat her meat.

There was a path beyond the mountain gate. As they followed the path, they began to hear the sound of thunder. They then saw a sea of lightning up ahead. At this moment, a giant heavenly pillar entered Long Chen’s gaze.
