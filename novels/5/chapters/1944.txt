Chapter 1934: 1934

BOOM!

Guo Ran’s opponent’s head was severed . However, at that moment, the martial stage vanished and Guo Ran was transported out .

Guo Ran’s armor disappeared, revealing himself . The current Guo Ran was covered in sweat, but he was filled with excitement .

“Hahaha, brothers, I can only help you out this much . As for whether or not you understood, it’s... it’s all up to you . ” Guo Ran’s legs failed him, and he almost collapsed . Although his fight had lasted less than an hour, he was exhausted . He needed Li Qi to go support him .

After placing Guo Ran in a chair, Li Qi praised him . “Guo Ran, I’m fully convinced . So you were actually hiding your true self so well . ”

“Don’t worry about it . Brothers, go out and fight . No matter who is in your way, crush them!” Guo Ran forced himself to shout despite his lack of energy .

Following that, the Dragonblood warriors charged into the Devil Blood Pool one by one . Yue Xiaoqian activated the automatic trial mechanism, so now anyone that entered the Devil Blood Pool would automatically be drawn into their own trial .

One martial stage appeared after another, and furious roars rang out as the Dragonblood warriors went all-out . Their battle intent was fully ignited by Guo Ran .

Looking from the Dragonblood warriors fighting to the original devil race’s experts that couldn’t help but look at him worshipfully, Guo Ran felt like all his pores had been fully opened . He felt like he might ascend at any moment . This feeling was indescribable .

“Boss, you treat me too good . This is my greatest moment . ” Guo Ran looked at Long Chen worshipfully .

“What happened? Why was it so difficult?” asked Long Chen . The two of them were speaking spiritually to prevent others from hearing .

“Boss, it was my mistake . I forgot to remove some of the mechanisms . I almost ended up screwing myself,” said Guo Ran .

The plan had been for Guo Ran to remove some of the hidden parts of his armor, weakening it . When the Devil Blood Pool duplicated him, his armor would still be missing those parts . Since Guo Ran’s armor was a physical object, it couldn’t duplicate what had been lost . After the duplication, Guo Ran could simply add the portions that hadn’t been duplicated .

The Devil Blood Pool was for normal experts, but Guo Ran was too special and could easily trick it to pass .

It was just that Guo Ran had been so focused on showing off that rather than taking off the seven parts he had planned, he had gotten caught up in his words that he had forgotten the last three parts .

As a result, the duplicated Guo Ran was only a bit weaker than his true self . Fortunately, he had still managed to beat it .

Hearing this, Long Chen sighed, “I find that showing off is the only motivation that can make you go all-out . Normally, you would have definitely lost . ”

“I think the same way . So showing off is the thing that can stimulate my potential . I really admire myself . ” Guo Ran nodded .

Long Chen glanced at him without saying anything . After succeeding in showing off, he would become even more of a show-off in the future . However, that wasn’t necessarily a bad thing . Each person pursued different things . What worked for others might not work for someone else .

“However, boss, will this really work? Those duplicates are too powerful . Facing myself gave me a weird feeling that made fighting very difficult,” said Guo Ran worriedly .

“That’s because your will isn’t strong enough . Don’t think others are like you . Do you think others live off of showing off like you?” said Long Chen disdainfully .

BOOM!

Yue Zifeng was the first to return . He had already succeeded in defeating his opponent .

Those disciples of the original devil race were shocked . It had only been a minute, but Yue Zifeng had already won .

After being transported out, Yue Zifeng didn’t hesitate . He entered the Devil Blood Pool again, once more appearing outside in under a minute .

Now the original devil race’s experts’ eyes almost popped out of their heads . Yue Zifeng was practically a monster .

Just as they were shocked, Yue Zifeng entered the Devil Blood Pool and returned once again .

“I’ve completed your mission . ” Yue Zifeng smiled .

Long Chen nodded . The will of a sword cultivator was truly terrifying . Their will was concentrated in their sword, and they had to possess an undefeatable will to control an undefeatable sword .

Even without Guo Ran’s display, Yue Zifeng would have passed the Devil Blood Pool . Sword cultivators were madmen, or they wouldn’t be able to devote their hearts purely to the sword . Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

The original devil race’s disciples had never seen anything like this . Furthermore, this was just one of the Dragonblood Legion’s captains . Now they understood why the Dragonblood Legion was called the Martial Heaven Continent’s number one legion . They were monstrous .

At this time, Li Qi also returned, however, he was covered in blood and was panting . Although he won, he had paid a price .

“Hahaha, satisfying, really... satisfying . ” Li Qi laughed . Although he was short of breath, he was still smiling .

Yue Xiaoqian also returned . At some point, she had also entered . Her shoulder was bleeding, but she was smiling delightedly .

“Long Chen, I finally beat it!” exclaimed Yue Xiaoqian, holding Long Chen’s hand .

“I knew you would be able to figure it out with just some pointers . But next time, be careful . If you get injured here, I’ll get hurt here . ” Long Chen pointed to Yue Xiaoqian’s shoulder and then his own heart . Although he knew being injured in battle was unavoidable, he still felt some pain .

“Yes, I’ll pay more attention in the future . ” Yue Xiaoqian blushed slightly, looking down . But she was happy inside .

Another person returned . Long Chen jumped in shock . “Little miss, just what are you up to?!”

It was Tang Wan-er . She was now covered in blood, and even her face was covered in cuts . Although they rapidly healed, the blood remained .

“Hehe, I won . ” Tang Wan-er made a victorious gesture and an adorable face .

Long Chen suddenly hugged Tang Wan-er, startling her . She knew Long Chen was distressed by her current appearance .

“You don’t need to pass the trial . Your wind blades are like a whirlwind of thousands of blades . It’s too bloody,” said Long Chen .

“No, I am also a member of the Dragonblood Legion . I’m not going to become deadweight . Don’t worry, I’ll look after myself . Getting a bit injured will just toughen me up . ” Tang Wan-er held Long Chen’s face in her hands .

After saying that, Tang Wan-er and Yue Xiaoqian circulated their Heavenly Dao energy to recover and prepare for the next challenge .

After all, not everyone was as monstrous as Yue Zifeng and capable of maintaining their peak condition the entire time . Yue Zifeng was capable of mercilessly slaying even himself . That was one reason why most sword cultivators were lonely, aloof figures .

Most of the Dragonblood warriors managed to win, but some failed . Facing oneself was too difficult . But after resting, they tried again .

To maintain the maximum effect each time, they always recovered to their peak condition before attempting it .

“Boss, how about you try it as well to raise their morale?” asked Guo Ran .

Long Chen shook his head . “This kind of trial is meaningless to me now . ”

Long Chen had stealthily tested the Devil Blood Pool before, only to find that Evilmoon, his Dragon Blood Battle Armor, and even his paragon arts were unable to be duplicated . Not even his World Extermination Flame Lotus could be duplicated .

The Dragonblood warriors’ Dragon Blood Battle Armor could be duplicated, but not his . It was very strange .

In this kind of state, he could only fight with his bare hands to challenge himself, which was useless . Furthermore, the azure dragon essence blood was constantly strengthening his physical body, so this trial couldn’t help him at all .

As the Dragonblood warriors challenged the Devil Blood Pool, within a distant high tower, Yue Xihan and some core Elders of the original devil race were watching .

“This Long Chen has toppled our understanding of the Devil Blood Pool as soon as he arrived . No wonder he is able to turn everything on its head in the Martial Heaven Continent . He truly is a monstrous existence,” said one of the Elders .

“The original devil race has a deep relationship with the nine star heirs . Long Chen’s fate is tied to our original devil race’s, and this is the start of our resurgence . Long Chen’s arrival will cause huge changes . Perhaps one day, we will be able to break the Martial Heaven Continent’s bindings and merge with the original devil races of other star-fields,” said Yue Xihan .

“Race leader, Long Chen brought a lot of Heavenly Dao Fruits this time, and many of them are on the Empyrean level . This matter is too big for us to handle, so we need your guidance,” said the Elder .

In the Yin Yang World, rivers of blood had flowed . Many great geniuses had died during the battle .

Long Chen had mountains of the Heavenly Dao Fruits, which were more than enough to turn every member of the Dragonblood Legion into an Empyrean . He had then distributed a portion to the Heaven Splitting Battle Sect, sending them through the Huayun Sect, while another portion was left with Li Tianxuan . The rest were for the original devil race . Not only were there over two thousand on the level of Empyreans, but there were also over a million of the level of rank nine Celestials . That was enough to raise a terrifying army that could fight on the Martial Heaven Continent .

“There’s no rush . Go back and choose a portion of our elite disciples to form a supreme army . Once they mature, we’ll be able to fight the Martial Heaven Continent . ” Yue Xihan looked into the distance with a smile . She seemed to be able to see the day that the original devil race could return to the Martial Heaven Continent .
