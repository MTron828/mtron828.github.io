Chapter 2751 The Divine Families’ Trump Card

Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

This strange elder was surrounded by immortal qi, but he had no spiritual fluctuations. The Eastern Wasteland Bell’s exclamation made Long Chen realize that this was just a corpse. However, that was not noticeable just from the outside appearance.

“This is an immortal corpse puppet that came from the immortal world. It seems that this Immortal Sealing Palace is the divine families’ hidden trump card. The ones capable of activating it were already killed by you, but it seems that you accidentally opened it just now. This luck…” The Eastern Wasteland Bell was speechless.

This trump card should have died in the pits of the divine families. However, it had been uncovered by Long Chen. It seemed that Long Chen’s overwhelming bad luck had yet to take a turn for the better.

The elder looked around; his eyes were vacant. His gaze suddenly landed on Long Aotian.

“Your old slave greets master.” The elder knelt toward Long Aotian.

Startled, Long Aotian suddenly thought of something and took out a dragon-shaped tablet. He spat some fresh blood onto it, and a dragon-shaped mark appeared on the elder’s forehead, identical to the tablet.

“Kill him for me!”

Long Aotian shouted. Only now did he recall that in the past few days, his mother had made the Saints of the divine families carry out an important ceremony. The next day, she gave him this tablet.

His mother had only told him that this tablet was related to a huge secret of the divine families, and to take care of it.

This tablet now formed a connection with the elder once he placed his essence blood on it. The next moment, the elder’s gaze was no longer vacant.

As soon as Long Aotian gave his order, the elder didn’t hesitate. He instantly appeared in front of Long Chen, using some unknown movement art. He was like a phantom.

The elder unleashed a punch that looked simple, but it caused space to collapse.

“What a powerful physical body!”

Long Chen was startled. In terms of pure physical power, Long Chen had never seen anyone reach such a level.

That terrifying physical strength aroused Long Chen’s battle intent. Rather than dodging, he unleashed his own punch.

BOOM! The two fists collided, shaking the world. After that, both their sleeves blew apart, the tatters flying through the air like butterflies.

As qi waves exploded from their fists, the stars in the sky quivered and black threads appeared in the void. Those were terrifying spatial cracks.

Dragon scales covered Long Chen’s fist, and runes flowed over his fist along with divine light, unleashing boundless power.

As for the elder, once his sleeve was blown away, people saw that his arm was covered in bizarre runes. Immortal light shone from those runes.

Long Chen was like a mountain in the sky. Despite the elder’s efforts, he was unable to shake Long Chen.

However, Long Chen was filled with shock. This elder’s power was extremely odd. It was also a kind of power that didn’t belong to this world.

The Eastern Wasteland Bell transmitted, “This person was sealed in the immortal world, transformed into a puppet, and sent down to this lower plane. Due to the wall of ascension, anyone alive has a low chance of passing through. But for a dead person, it’s a bit easier. However, even if it’s a puppet, it needs to possess a certain spirituality in order to unleash its power. That’s why this kind of immortal corpse must go through careful selection before being sent, and the price to send it to a lower plane is immense. This Immortal Sealing Palace should be its home. Only inside it can it guarantee that his immortal qi doesn’t flow away too quickly. However, once it starts fighting, its immortal qi will slowly dissipate, and it will not be able to replenish it. As long as you can stall it, you will easily get the advantage over time.”

“What is his cultivation base?” asked Long Chen.

“According to the Martial Heaven Continent’s realms, he should be at the eleventh Heavenstage of Heaven Merging, so the Saint realm,” said the Eastern Wasteland Bell.

“Just the Saint realm, and he’s so powerful?” Long Chen was startled.

“What are you thinking? He came from the immortal world! The laws there are completely different from here. They are born with immortal spiritual qi nourishing them. Everything they eat, drink, and breathe has a qualitative difference to us. You cannot use your standards for this place to judge the immortal world,” said the Eastern Wasteland Bell.

Just at this moment, the elder opened his mouth, unleashing a ray of sword-light at Long Chen. He had previously been fighting extremely woodenly, causing Long Chen to be caught off-guard. Now, Long Chen instinctively dodged. The sword-light flew past him, but the elder managed to knock him back.

“Watch out!”

The Eastern Wasteland Bell suddenly cried out, and Long Chen also sensed danger. Without looking back, he smashed a fist behind him.

Long Chen’s arm quivered. He ended up striking another elder’s fist. At some point, another opponent had appeared.

This was not a clone but another immortal corpse. Long Chen suddenly saw that the gates to the immortal palace were open, and inside were densely packed coffins. He couldn’t even count how many of them there were.

One of those coffins had been opened, and Long Aotian was standing there, forming hand seals.

“He’s going to unleash all the immortal corpses! Stop him!” warned the Eastern Wasteland Bell.

Just as it spoke, another seven coffins opened. Seven figures charged out at Long Chen.

Now, Long Chen was surrounded by nine immortal corpses. Their attacks pressed him badly. He wanted to charge out of their encirclement, but he was blocked.

“Long Chen, you never expected this, right?! The divine families’ trump card is far more terrifying than you expected! There are thirty thousand immortal corpse puppets here, more than enough to crush the Martial Heaven Continent. Today, I’ll summon half to kill you. Let’s see how long you can last!” sneered Long Aotian.

With a tablet in his hand, he was constantly dripping more essence blood into it, causing more coffins to open. The immortal corpses were being awakened by his Spirit Blood.

“Six Star Battle Armor!” Long Chen shouted. Six stars lit up within his divine ring, and the star diagram inside of the divine ring looked as if it was boiling over.

BOOM!

With a single punch, an immortal corpse was sent flying. That immortal corpse’s runes rapidly dimmed.

With that one punch, Long Chen had exhausted all the corpse’s immortal qi. Without the protection of its runes, it quickly became a simple corpse, rotting before it even landed on the ground.

With the Six Star Battle Armor, Long Chen fought the immortal corpses surrounding him. He blasted them away. His new star diagram caused even the Six Star Battle Armor to become more ferocious.

“Today, I’ll smash apart this broken palace of yours.”

Long Chen stepped toward the Immortal Sealing Palace. However, just at that moment, the Eastern Wasteland Bell cried out.

“Not good! Return to the Martial Heaven Continent immediately!”
