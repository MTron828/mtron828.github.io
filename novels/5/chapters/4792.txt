Chapter 4781 Long Tianrui

Long Chen’s words shocked countless experts, including the Heaven Overseer.

Although the Heaven Overseer knew that Long Chen’s potential was shocking and that he could be concealing his true power, the Heaven Overseer thought that Long Chen could only last for a while against an Earth Saint, perhaps around ten moves. After all, to be able to last ten moves against an Earth Saint was a notable battle record.

“If he can kill his opponent in ten moves, perhaps he is on par with our clan’s greatest heavenly genius, Long Tianrui,” a Sage King remarked behind the Heaven Overseer, his voice trembling with awe.

“If he really can do that, we have to protect him no matter what. If we have both of them, our Long clan will definitely rise to the pinnacle,” stated the one who had been always speaking up for Long Chen.

“That would mean that his talent is not inferior to his father’s. Long Zhantian is indeed the most terrifying existence I’ve ever seen,” the Heaven Overseer concurred, visibly impressed.

Long Tianrui was a heavenly genius from the ancient era who had been sealed all the way to the present era. However, the moment she was unsealed, she directly became the Long clan’s number one heavenly genius. With her ascent, the former top-ranked individuals were relegated one position lower, causing a ripple effect throughout the clan's hierarchy.

In the ancient era, Long Tianrui had a record of killing an Earth Saint. In fact, there was a record of her killing more than one. While some of the disciples in the Long clan were capable of fighting an Earth Saint, none of them had a record of killing one.

One factor contributing to this was the strict regulations within the Long clan, which prohibited disciples from going out and engaging in battles against Earth Saints. Hence, any Earth Saints whom the disciples sparred against would definitely be their own people, so they would be holding back.

As a result, none of them had really gone all out against an Earth Saint. If Long Chen really did kill this Earth Saint, his ranking would instantly soar to the same as Long Tianrui’s.

Long Tianrui had held the title of the Long clan's greatest heavenly genius for millions of years, standing unchallenged at the pinnacle of excellence from the moment of her birth. However, she had been born in the wrong era, so she had been sealed until now.

If Long Chen could match Long Tianrui, the future of the Long clan would be very bright. The Heaven Overseer’s gaze instantly grew fiery.

At this moment, the crowd of experts was stunned by Long Chen’s declaration. If those words were spoken by someone else, they would immediately scoff at them, thinking it was just a huge joke. However, this was Long Chen speaking. Rather than a joke, it felt more like a terrifying promise.

“Hahaha!” The Earth Saint's laughter echoed with fury, his voice trembling with indignation. “You little brat, do you know who you are speaking to? Take my life in ten moves? Fine, I want to see if you have that ability!”

The Celestial race’s Earth Saint suddenly formed one-handed seals. Tilting his head skyward, he roared, “Mortal Dao, Divine Soul Blood Sacrifice!”

Blood-colored divine light erupted out of this Earth Saint’s hand. As he rubbed it onto the huge sword, it instantly became encased in this bloody light. All of a sudden, the huge sword rumbled like thunder, emitting an overwhelming divine might.

“Finally, the Saint weapon has been truly awoken. The real battle starts now,” sighed an old Sage King in the crowd.

Although countless people hoped for Long Chen to win, they all knew it was next to impossible. The difference between the two of them was like a heavenly chasm.

Although there were noted records of some heavenly geniuses fighting Earth Saints, this battle was on a completely different realm. After all, those heavenly geniuses only sparred against their seniors in their sects and clans. Which of the Earth Saints was really trying to kill them?

Moreover, in that kind of battle, who would use an awakened Saint weapon? Once a Saint weapon was awoken, it generally did not stop until it killed its target; otherwise, it would lose some spirituality, which could cause irreparable harm to it over time. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

There were countless methods to awaken a Saint weapon, and anyone in the Eternal realm had the power to awaken it. However, basic Eternal experts were only the lowest-level controllers of Saint weapons, and they would need to sacrifice their own blood soul energy to do so. Such a sacrifice came at immense harm to the user, so Eternal experts typically would not awaken a Saint weapon unless they had no other choice.

As one ascended from the Eternal realm to the Saint, Sage King, Mortal Saint, and Earth Saint realms, the cost of awakening a Saint weapon decreased. This was because their own power had increased to the point where they could simply channel their energy into the weapon, merging with it seamlessly.

Meanwhile, legend had it that the legendary Heaven Saints didn’t need to awaken their Saint weapons because their Saint weapons had long since become a part of them. They could unleash a Saint weapon’s power with a wave of their hand.

This Earth Saint of the Celestial race should have his own Saint weapon to use, but in order to placate the sword that had just lost its matter, he decided to use it instead. Otherwise, if he did not placate it, having lost its master, it might just fly off on its own to search for a new master.

This Earth Saint sacrificed his own blood soul energy to it as a bribe, imbuing the weapon with benefits to awaken its primal desire to kill and giving it the determination to avenge its master. In an instant, this ancient divine weapon had its full power activated.

The runes on the sword pulsed like a beast’s heartbeat, emanating a powerful pressure that caused every expert to feel their soul quake. Their legs weakened, and they felt compelled to kneel under the weight of this terrifying presence. This was the true might of a Saint weapon.

On the other hand, Long Chen simply stood there. Evilmoon still exuded ferocious and frightening air but not any pressure of its own. Even with that sword pointed at him, Long Chen didn’t react.

Evilmoon said, “A dragon stuck in the shallows can’t grow. I wouldn’t have to suffer like this if it weren’t for these damn chains. Long Chen, kill him! I want to break this seal immediately!”

Evilmoon was enraged. Last time, it had absorbed the power of the Emperor Blood Silk Net. However, due to its seal, it was unable to digest the net’s power. It felt like there was some strange curse on it that it couldn’t touch, restricting its power.

However, Evilmoon somehow knew that the only way to fight this curse was to kill. Now that the other side’s divine weapon was provoking it, the enraged Evilmoon could no longer hold back.

The Celestial race’s Earth Saint was also clenching his teeth furiously, his face twisted with rage. “You little ingrate, today I will—”

Pow!

Just as he cursed at Long Chen, a hand viciously slapped his face, and with an explosive sound, he was sent flying. This scene felt like déjà vu. It was practically an exact replay of Long Chen’s previous slap.

“Has this world gone crazy?”

The jaw of every expert dropped as everyone was stunned silence.
