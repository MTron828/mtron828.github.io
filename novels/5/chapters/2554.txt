Chapter 2543 Long Chen’s Fear

In front of everyone’s shocked gazes, the giant Ten Thousand Dragon Nest began to turn to ruins.

“Long Chen, Guo Ran, you won’t have good deaths! Unless you kill me, I’ll definitely make you live a life worse than death!”

Zhao Ritian’s miserable scream came from the forging table. His voice was full of bitter resentment, as he had been turned into Guo Ran’s tool for extracting metal. With the forging table’s runes suppressing him, he couldn’t even fight back.

He could only obediently absorb immortal metal for Guo Ran, and once his power reached a certain level, Guo Ran would start forcing that immortal metal out of his body.

Guo Ran was very cautious about this. He didn’t want Zhao Ritian to recover too much and be able to break his seal, so he immediately smashed the metal out of him once Zhao Ritian had absorbed enough.

Zhao Ritian’s hatred for Guo Ran could no longer be expressed with words because he had used up all the curse words he knew. He had even made a few new ones, but that didn’t resolve the hatred in his heart.

Fortunately, Guo Ran had gotten used to his cursing, and he continued striking him with his hammer, causing the immortal metal to fly out of Zhao Ritian’s body. After he was done, he left with Long Chen.

The channel in the beast valley had also been emptied, and they finally saw what was on the other side of the channel. It was a giant altar.

The beasts had been killed, so there was no need to keep this channel. Long Chen then destroyed the altar, severing this channel between the Star Field Divine World and whatever world the beasts were coming from.

Both regions had been destroyed by Long Chen. After a bit, Long Chen was preparing to go to the Heavenly Scorpion Valley, but Ling Xi stopped him.

Ling Xi said that the Heavenly Scorpion Canyon was now the only training area of the Star Field Divine World. It wasn’t good to destroy it.

Furthermore, the Heavenly Scorpion Canyon was the weakest of the three regions. Leaving one place for the Luo Spirit race’s warriors to train was good. Moreover, they couldn’t threaten the Luo Spirit race’s safety.

Due to those reasons, Long Chen left the Heavenly Scorpion Canyon as it was. After that, he brought everyone back to the mother tree. There, he saw that everyone had climbed to the peak of the mother tree and had gone into seclusion.

The lightning dragon and flame dragon were already done with their training. Unfortunately, the flame and lightning energies here were only enough to allow them to recover their energy, not to let them make a breakthrough. Since staying any longer was meaningless, they returned to Long Chen’s body.

Long Chen was also planning on going into seclusion. The Moon and Star Refining Furnace and the Demon Moon Furnace had refined a huge number of pills for him that could allow him to advance.

“Boss, don’t go into seclusion! If you do, I’ll be on my own. I can’t go looking for ores by myself. What if I run into Feng Fei or Ye Ming? I don’t even have my battle armor any longer. Who knows whether or not Zhao Ritian has a way to message Feng Fei? You have to stand guard, or I can’t go out,” said Guo Ran.

Although Guo Ran was able to quickly transport himself within the range of the mother tree’s territory, an opponent like Feng Fei was more than capable of locking space and preventing him from fleeing.

Since Guo Ran had Zhao Ritian in his hands, he wanted to use him to the fullest. Moreover, Guo Ran’s goal was to gather all the ores of the Star Field Divine World, so he was itching to get started.

“Fine, I’ll go with you. I can cultivate while you gather the ores,” said Long Chen. He could eat pills wherever.

After that, Long Chen and Guo Ran were quickly transported to one of the Star Field Divine World’s largest mineral deposits. According to Ling Xi, there were over ten large veins of ore in the Star Field Divine World.

Those ore veins were so large that even someone like Zhao Ritian would need a few centuries to absorb them all. Therefore, Ling Xi only pointed out four of the purest veins, and Long Chen and Guo Ran chose to go to one of those locations. Upon arriving, they saw a golden mountain range.

“Damn, the immortal metals are already revealed on the surface! The purity of this vein is incredibly high!” exclaimed Guo Ran. He quickly took out his forging table.

It went without saying that Zhao Ritian was truly amazing. This giant ore vein rapidly dimmed, and in just half a day, the majority of those ores were sucked away.

Then, Guo Ran got to work with his hammer. Between Zhao Ritian’s screams and curses, fragments of immortal metal came flying out. After that, Guo Ran put those away and continued gathering ores.

This giant vein was filled with precious immortal metals and not just one kind of them. There were hundreds of different immortal metals here. It was a very rare place. Guo Ran was particularly fond of this place because the wide variety of immortal metals meant that he could forge even stronger battle armor for himself.

As Guo Ran got to work, Long Chen didn’t slack off. He kept an eye on Guo Ran, while he consumed pills.

The fourth step of Netherpassage was the peak of the Netherpassage realm, the ninth Heavenstage. However, Long Chen had thirteen Heavenstages to go through due to the Nine Star Hegemon Body Art.

He was currently at the ninth Heavenstage. That was the end of the Netherpassage realm for others, but not for Long Chen.

He had no idea how these final Heavenstages were supposed to be cultivated. All he knew was that he needed to consume pills if he wanted to advance.

When he had reached the fourth step of Netherpassage, he had relied on the life and death spring. But now he had to rely on medicinal pills.

During this time, the Moon and Star Refining Furnace and Demon Moon Furnace had refined mountains of pills. Looking at those pills, Long Chen felt nauseous. His stomach rebelled.

After that, Long Chen took a deep breath and activated the evil dragon race’s Swallow the Heavens, Devour the Earth divine ability. In this state, Long Chen’s stomach was like a devouring space.

“Fuck, I’ll go all-out.” Long Chen grabbed a basket filled with spirit pills and demonic pills, which were all top grade giant pills. Long Chen then opened his mouth, and those pills poured into his body.Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

Rumbling rang out as those pills entered his stomach. They were like volcanoes exploding, unleashing a huge amount of energy.

Long Chen had expected a powerful impact from consuming so many pills. However, it wasn’t as big as he had expected, as he didn’t feel uncomfortable at all. His stomach simply grumbled.

“You’ve activated the Six Star Battle Armor, and your physical body has gotten stronger from it. These pills can’t injure you, so you can be at ease,” said Evilmoon.

“So that’s it.” Long Chen immediately started devouring more and more. If it was before, he would need to rest for a while after consuming so many pills in order to digest the medicinal energy. But now he had no need to rest. His stomach could endure the torrent of medicinal energy pouring through his body.

Long Chen could clearly feel the medicinal energy pouring toward the FengFu, Alioth, Life Fate, Enlightenment Palace, and Divine Gate Stars.

However, that energy was not shared with the sixth Nethergate Star. The energy of the pills poured only to the five stars.

Could it be that the final three Heavenstages of the Netherpassage realm had to do with the five stars?

Long Chen’s divine ring automatically appeared along with the black and white energies within the five stars. Life and death energy connected them.

If he simply allowed this life and death energy to connect the five stars, then there was no way that it could create a cycle. That was because there was an extra star disturbing the cycle, the sixth star, the Nethergate Star.

“It’s doomed.”

Long Chen’s heart sank, and he began to sweat. Even Evilmoon was silent.

“It seems that my cultivation order was wrong.” Long Chen’s voice trembled.

“I want to comfort you, but you’re a smart person.” Evilmoon sighed.

Only at this moment in his cultivation did Long Chen realize that his life and death energy was trying to enter the image of a five-point star. That perfectly matched with the Five Star Battle Armor’s image.

However, now that he had already summoned the Six Star Battle Armor, the Nethergate Star was shining brightly. The five stars in the divine ring had become six.

That was why as his life and death energy tried to connect the five stars, it repeatedly failed. The Nethergate Star disturbed the flow of life and death energy.

Sweat soaked Long Chen’s back, and he thought of a terrifying possibility. That was that it was forbidden to fully activate the sixth star within the Netherpassage realm. As a result, he now had no idea how he was supposed to take his final steps in the Netherpassage realm.

Was his cultivation of this peerless cultivation technique about to be crippled just like this? Long Chen felt an unprecedented fear. If he was crippled like this, then there would be nowhere for him to go in this world. Everyone he cared about would die to his enemies. Thinking about this, Long Chen’s hands quivered.

In the distance, Guo Ran was still pounding Zhao Ritian, not sensing Long Chen’s fear.

Long Chen’s head was empty, and his palms were sweaty. His life and death energy continued to try and condense the five-point star in his divine ring, but it was useless.

After that, a strange sound began to come from the five stars in his divine ring. Upon hearing that, Long Chen felt like his heart was no longer pounding.

He felt like the heavens were playing a huge joke on him. He could almost hear fate laughing at him.

The cruelest thing in this world was to give you endless hope and then give you despair. With his cultivation path severed, all his dreams became illusory. He wasn’t even qualified to undo the secrets of his origins.

Long Chen clenched his fists. At the same time, his teeth creaked and his hair stood on end. He was furious. Why was the Nine Star Hegemon Body Art playing such a joke on him?

Why hadn’t the Pill Sovereign memories not mentioned this? Why was there nothing indicating such a giant cultivation taboo?

“Long Chen, calm down. Perhaps there’s another way,” shouted Evilmoon upon seeing the darkness reappearing in Long Chen’s eyes.

“Calm down? Fuck that! Since I’ve deviated from the correct cultivation technique, I’ll deviate it all the way to the end!”

Long Chen let out a furious roar. After that, the life and death energy flowing within his divine ring suddenly exploded.
