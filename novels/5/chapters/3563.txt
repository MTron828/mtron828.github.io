Chapter 3552

“Bastards, do they not know that we have to be united against the enemy at this time and save fairy Qingxuan?!”

Furious roars rang out. Yu Qingxuan was in crisis and was fighting against the devil race. Why didn’t they save her first? Could their enmity with Long Chen not be settled at a later time?

Just then, countless devil experts came flooding out, charging at Yu Qingxuan to help that Immemorial Flame Devil.

Although these devils knew that even without them, Yu Qingxuan would not be able to last much longer, this world was about to crumble. They had to quickly flee, and this battle had to be drawn to a close soon. Otherwise, it would be too late.

“Protect fairy Qingxuan!” A human expert roared and was the first to charge out.

“Humans, nothing more than a despicable race of lifeforms. You should have never been born in this world. Wipe them out!”

Another lifeform suddenly shouted and his blood Qi erupted like a volcano. This vast Blood Qi shook the heavens.

“It’s the Blood race! He’s from the Blood race!”

Startled cries rang out. The Blood race was enemies with the human race just like the devil race. They were mortal enemies.

“There’s also the Nether race! Damnit!”

The Devil race, Blood race, and Nether race’s experts all appeared, no longer concealing their auras. They flooded forward.

“Don’t be afraid. Our human race has more numbers than them! Fight!”

At this moment, the entire world became chaotic, and millions of experts began to clash.

Zhao Mingxuan and the others hadn’t expected the other worlds’ experts to make their move at this time. They also wanted to go help the people from their own powers.

However, eyeing Long Chen, Zhao Mingxuan clenched his teeth and said, “Attack together to help Yan Hong kill Long Chen!”

Zhao Mingxuan and the others attacked together. All their World Domain divine items slashed toward Long Chen.

BOOM!

But then, a heaven-shaking explosion erupted and a flame sword pierced through the void. Huo Linger’s figure appeared, blocking all their attacks with one blow.

“What?!”

Zhao Mingxuan and the others were shocked. Their combined attack of over ten World Domain divine items was actually blocked.

“How can that be!?” Wu Yang cried out. They recognized Huo Linger’s True Fire Sword, but this World Domain divine item actually had thirty percent of its runes activated in her hands. It had to be known that it was only thanks to their bloodline power and the spiritual imprint of their ancestors that they were able to activate a tenth of the power of the World Domain divine items in their hands.

“Don’t hesitate any longer! Use your greatest force!”

Zhao Mingxuan shouted and suddenly spat out a mouthful of essence blood onto his divine weapon. His weapon’s light instantly soared. By igniting his essence blood, he unleashed more power from his World Domain divine item.

Following that, the others also stopped hesitating. After sacrificing their essence blood, their weapons instantly seemed to awaken, unleashing supreme divine might.

BOOM!

Huo Linger was instantly forced back by their combined force.

“Huo Linger, quickly save Qingxuan!” Long Chen’s expression suddenly changed and he shouted at Huo Linger.

That was because at this time, countless experts from the enemy races had broken through the blockade of the human race’s experts to charge at Yu Qingxuan.

Huo Linger instantly shot toward Yu Qingxuan, only for Wu Yang to transform into a giant Golden Crow and block her path. At the same time, four others attacked her. Huo Linger could not get through.

“Long Chen, you should worry about yourselves!”

Zhao Mingxuan led the others to attack Long Chen. At this time, Long Chen and Yan Hong were crazily fighting over the flame energy of the world. Seeing these people coming at him now, Long Chen’s eyes turned scarlet.

“Scram!” Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

Long Chen roared furiously. Suddenly, his divine ring stopped spinning and he gave up on absorbing the flame energy to attack Zhao Mingxuan and the others.

BOOM!

Despite joining forces, Zhao Mingxuan and the others tumbled back. Even having ignited their essence blood, they couldn’t block Long Chen’s attack.

All of them coughed up blood, shock filling their eyes. They finally experienced just how terrifying Long Chen’s violet qi was.

Now they understood why Yan Hong had promised them benefits if they helped him attack Long Chen. They could not even imagine just how terrifying Long Chen was.

“Qingxuan…!” Long Chen clenched his teeth and suddenly shot toward Yu Qingxuan. But he was still one step too late. That Immemorial Flame Devil had escaped his bindings and reached her. Long Chen was too far to stop him.

BOOM!

A dragon spear suddenly appeared, blocking that Immemorial Flame Devil’s attack at the last moment, saving Yu Qingxuan.

“Feng Xiang!”

Long Chen was shocked and delighted. Unexpectedly, Feng Xiang had saved Yu Qingxuan. He came at just the right time.

“How dare you block me?! Die!”

The Immemorial Flame Devil roared and slashed his sword at Feng Xiang. Feng Xiang then blocked with all his power, only to be blown back and cough up blood. He wasn’t a match for this Immemorial Flame Devil.

However, after blocking two attacks, he bought Long Chen enough time to appear by Yu Qingxuan’s side. He then wrapped an arm around her waist.

“You fool, if you don’t stop Yan Hong, we’ll still die.” Yu Qingxuan’s eyes were listless, and blood dripped down her mouth. She sighed.

“If I could die with you, I would have no regrets.”

Long Chen felt like his heart was being cut to pieces just looking at Yu Qingxuan in this weak state. Unable to contain the killing intent within him, the dark energy within his heart began to thrum.

“Why… Why do you treat me so well?” Even though Yu Qingxuan was in her weakest state ever, she still started to redden when she looked at Long Chen.

“Because what I owe you cannot be repaid even through multiple lifetimes. I will always treat you well and never ask for anything in return.” Long Chen looked into her eyes.

He truly owed her far too much. He had already sworn to protect her, to not let her suffer any wound.

But now? Yu Qingxuan was forced into such a weak state. So, Long Chen’s fury could no longer be contained. His hair began to float despite there being no wind, and black runes began to appear within his eyes.

“Thank you!”

Looking at Long Chen’s determined gaze, leaning against his body, and smelling his scent that was full of a man’s odor, Yu Qingxuan suddenly smiled. It seemed that life and death were no longer so important at this moment.

“Long Chen, you’ve slaughtered my devil race’s people. Today, I will avenge them!” The Immemorial Flame Devil charged over.

Zhao Mingxuan, Wu Yang, and the others also came charging over, sealing all his paths of retreat. He and Yu Qingxuan were caught in desperate straits.

Seeing this, Long Chen summoned Huo Linger back. She then transformed into a flame dragon that wrapped around Yu Qingxuan, using her own power to help Yu Qingxuan recover.

“Qingxuan, close your eyes!” said Long Chen.

“Why?” asked Yu Qingxuan.

“Because it’s about to get very bloody.”

Long Chen clenched his teeth and looked at that Immemorial Flame Devil, as well as Zhao Mingxuan and the others. His killing intent could no longer be contained in the slightest, and it fully erupted!
