Chapter 4645 Complete Name

The Sovereign clan expert was also moved slightly by Long Chen’s words, especially the part about defying fate even if they were just ants.

At that moment, he felt like he understood why the Dragon Sovereign would pass its inheritance to this youngster.

With a resounding roar, Gu Yang’s fighting spirit seemed to fill this world, and golden dragon runes covered him. A dragon soul had also resonated with him, causing his pupils to contract ever so slightly.

Meanwhile, the magma raged, echoing with powerful dragon roars that reverberated throughout the Ten Thousand Dragon Nest. It felt as though millions of dragon souls were being stirred by the willpower of the Dragonblood warriors.

Amidst the roar, explosive sounds filled the air. Divine light enveloped Li Qi, Song Mingyuan, Yue Zifeng, Bai Xiaole, Bai Shishi, Yu Qingxuan, and the others, as new scales grew on top of their skins. Some of them displayed glowing dragon runes on their foreheads, while others manifested roaring giant dragons in their manifestations.

Before this, the Dragonblood Legion had been calling out to dragon souls to come to them. Now, with one speech from Long Chen, the situation directly turned around. Millions and millions of dragon souls were fighting to merge with the Dragonblood warriors.

Some dragon souls were too late and actually tried to push out other dragon souls. Long Chen was taken aback by this unexpected turn of events.

In response, all the Dragonblood warriors summoned their newly-formed Dragon Blood Battle Armor and charged forward.

Unexpectedly, Bai Shishi, Bai Xiaole, and Yu Qingxuan were supported by dragon souls as well, while Yue Zifeng was graced by the presence of a white true dragon hovering above him, which added to his icily grand and arrogant demeanor.

“Brothers, this fellow is looking down on us! Let’s show him the true power of the Dragonblood Legion! Just like boss said, beat him until he cries!” Guo Ran shouted. His dragon soul seemed to be affected by the atmosphere, and his triple-layer armor materialized once again.

“Beat him until he cries!”

With this one roar, over seven thousand Dragonblood warriors charged toward the Sovereign clan expert.

The magma exploded as countless dragon souls cried out in unison, shaking the world.

“Ignorant fools! No matter how many ants you gather, can you threaten a dragon?” mocked the Sovereign clan expert, facing the Dragonblood warriors whose morale soared defiantly.

“Keep talking big! We won’t stop until you’re crying!”

No one knew where Guo Ran summoned his courage from, but he was actually the first to reach the Sovereign clan expert. He wanted to say a few words to encourage everyone, but a fist already collided with his nose, silencing him before he could even start.

With an explosive sound, Guo Ran was sent flying through the air, blood spraying from his nose. By chance, he landed near Long Chen, who swiftly caught him.

Tears and mucus streaked down Guo Ran’s face... So, he was the one who had been beaten until he cried.

“Commune with your dragon soul properly. You need to be able to summon your defensive power at will. Your reactions are too slow at the moment,” explained Long Chen briefly as he had no time to comfort Guo Ran. Shoving him to the side, Long Chen charged forward as well.

BOOM!

Right after sending Guo Ran flying, the Sovereign clan expert’s fist smashed Gu Yang’s spear apart and imprinted a fist mark into Gu Yang’s chest, shattering his dragon scales.

Even though Gu Yang had merged with the dragon soul and summoned a new Dragon Blood Battle Armor, increasing his defensive power by over ten times compared to before, he still couldn’t endure this fist.

This one blow almost pierced through him. Finally, Gu Yang had experienced the Sovereign clan expert’s power and understood why someone as powerful as their boss was not his match. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“Wavecutter!”

Just then, a sharp sword slashed down. Its harsh and formidable edge found its mark, striking the Sovereign clan expert's arm with impeccable timing.

BOOM!

Sword Qi exploded in a brilliant firework of divine light, but the Sovereign clan expert’s arm remained completely unscathed. There wasn’t even a mark on his scales.

“What?!”

Yue Zifeng was shocked that his strongest attack was completely ineffective.

“Attack!”

At this moment, the rest of the Dragonblood warriors launched their own attacks. However, the Sovereign clan expert was just too powerful. With just one punch and one kick, he sent the Dragonblood warriors’ formations flying. They were unable to endure a single blow from him.

No matter how they cooperated, no matter what formation they tried, they weren’t worth much in front of absolute power.

Only Long Chen was barely capable of blocking a few of his attacks. The others lacked the necessary power to effectively counter the onslaught.

“Brother, Dragonblood Cross Sla—aiya!”

Guo Ran crossed his sabers, but just as everyone’s power gathered, his sabers exploded, unable to contain everyone’s new power. His technique shattered before he could even unleash it.

Guo Ran seethed with rage as he spat out blood, repeatedly charging toward the Sovereign clan expert only to be effortlessly repelled. Despite this, Guo Ran’s astonishing defense left even Long Chen in awe.

While Long Chen’s bones would shatter from a single blow, Guo Ran’s scales merely cracked before swiftly regenerating, allowing Guo Ran to launch counterattacks. Surprisingly, his defensive capabilities surpassed even Long Chen's.

Yet, his speed was too slow and his movements too clumsy. There was no way he could pose any threat to this expert. Guo Ran cursed the hidden dragon he had merged with for doing this to him. How was he supposed to lead the Dragonblood Legion? He couldn’t just go into hiding the moment a battle started, right?

“Zifeng, don’t force it!” Long Chen suddenly shouted as he saw Yue Zifeng fail three times.

“Boss, what is going on? I...” Yue Zifeng was clearly a bit panicky.

Three consecutive full-power attacks from him had failed to deal any damage to this expert, dealing a huge blow to his confidence.

He had just lost against Luo Changsheng, and this time, his failure felt even more devastating.

Long Chen said, “Don’t doubt yourself! You cannot doubt your sword! Remember, this is your conviction, and it cannot be shaken by anyone! If your slash attacks are ineffective, it only means that your attack method is wrong. Remember the name ‘Wavecutter’! ‘Cutter’ is the essence of the attack, but ‘Wave’ is the target. A wave is always in constant motion, and cutting it means severing its foundation. From the moment you saw this old bastard, you already felt oppressed. When you drew your sword, you hesitated to strike. Zifeng, look at me! Among us, perhaps I am capable of beating him, but only you can threaten his life. Recall your journey! Think back to the footsteps that brought you here, from weak to strong. Listen to the voice of your sword, and say its full name loud and proud. Tell us the complete name of this move!”

Yue Zifeng slowly closed his eyes and clasped the hilt of his sword. At this moment, the world suddenly fell silent.

The Dragonblood warriors and the Sovereign clan expert immediately sensed it. The Sovereign clan expert turned to the distant Long Chen and Yue Zifeng, a trace of shock flickering in his eyes.
