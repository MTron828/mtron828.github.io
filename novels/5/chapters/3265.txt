Chapter 3254 A Strange But Marvelous Idea

“No way, we’re this unlucky?!”

Xu Zixiong cried out in shock. They had just entered the devil sea and could still see land behind them. But they were already being attacked? Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

Qin Feng slashed his saber, and that enormous monster was cut in two. It was nothing more than a Four Peak realm sea demon.

However, after it was slain, the sea around them seemed to boil. Countless sea demons then began rushing over.

“I don’t understand, the few of us aren’t even a snack for them! Why do they want to eat us?!” exclaimed Xu Zixiong.

“Our bodies are the best nourishment for them. It is said that they view our human race as human pills for their cultivation. In the desolate era, our human race was viewed as food for countless other races. They consumed us to strengthen themselves. However, now the human race is stronger, and it’s our turn to kill them. We can extract their essence blood and refine it into medicine. Hehe, it really is a turn of fate,” said Qin Feng. He stood at the front of the flying boat, constantly slaying the sea demons that approached them.

“Then why didn’t they want to eat me when I crossed the devil sea?” muttered Xu Zixiong.

“Perhaps they felt that eating you would affect their intelligence?” joked Qin Feng.

“...”

Countless sea demons attacked. Xu Zixiong, Qin Feng, and Qi Yu killed them, but they were endless. The three of them had no idea when they would be able to kill them all.

Bai Shishi couldn’t help giving a reminder. “Long Chen, this is both dangerous and slow. Don’t tell me that you’re planning on killing your way to the other shore. Do you know that if the deep sea devils are drawn out, then even a World King might not be able to escape? Causing a huge disturbance here will definitely draw them out, and then all of us will be doomed.”

From the start, Bai Shishi had felt that this way of crossing the devil sea was unreliable. They had so many people, so they were too big of a target. It was all too easy to draw the attention of the sea demons.

“Don’t worry. Since you could think of it, I am also capable of that. Do I look like a fool?” said Long Chen a bit irritably. Did he really need a reminder for this?

“Fine, I suppose telling you the truth will only anger you,” said Bai Shishi indifferently.

Long Chen laughed. So, even Bai Shishi could be funny at times. That was beyond his expectations.

“Xiaole, control that three-tailed fish monster,” shouted Long Chen suddenly.

As soon as his voice rang out, their vision darkened. Their flying boat was swallowed by a giant three-tailed fish. Its body was both long and slender, like a pole. It was incredibly fast.

This was a fourth rank sea demon. After killing so many third rank sea demons, they had finally drawn out a fourth rank. Furthermore, it was one of the fastest varieties of fourth rank sea demons.

“Yes!”

Bai Xiaole formed hand seals. At this moment, his Three Flower Pupils activated, and the mark of his eyes appeared within the eyes of the fish.

“Haha, it’s done!” Bai Xiaole laughed. His hard work cultivating with his mother had caused him to grow increasingly familiar with his pupil arts. He instantly controlled this sea demon.

“Well done. Have it carry the flying boat and bring us away,” said Long Chen with praise. Bai Xiaole could finally be depended upon.

This fish was like an arrow bringing them away at shocking speed. Furthermore, there were no waves or wind on the devil sea. By fastening the flying boat to the fish’s back, it was fast, steady, and safe.

Its speed was several times greater than the flying boat. Some sea demons noticed them, but they didn’t have this fish monster’s speed. After chasing a bit, they were lost far behind them.

Bai Shishi couldn’t help laughing when she saw Long Chen’s pleased appearance. This fellow really never walked the normal path. He was actually capable of thinking of something like this.

Bai Xiaole was particularly excited. He felt like the outside world truly was fun. Everything was novel. When he saw that the sea demons were dumbfounded by their appearance and then tried to chase them, only to be flung far into the distance, he laughed. Crossing the terrifying devil sea this way was truly stimulating.

Bai Xiaole was having fun with the three-tailed fish monster, but very quickly, a giant shark appeared and caught up to it. With a single bite, it split the fish monster in two, causing Bai Xiaole to cry out.

This wasn’t a sea demon but a deep sea devil called the Deep Sea Shark Devil. Furthermore, it was an existence at the peak of the fourth rank.

It was also a deep sea devil with shocking speed. Otherwise, it wouldn’t have been able to catch up to them. However, just as it bit their transportation, Long Chen punched its head, and with a flash of lightning, its body stiffened.

“Xiaole, again!” shouted Long Chen.

Bai Xiaole recovered from his shock and immediately used the Three Flower Pupils to control the Deep Sea Devil Shark.

Its head was still dazed from being struck by Long Chen’s lightning, so it couldn’t even resist before falling under Bai Xiaole’s control.

Hanging on one of its fins, they charged forward again, and their speed was even greater than before. This refreshing feeling made Bai Xiaole, Xu Zixiong, and the others cheer.

Even the icy Bai Shishi wanted to smile. Long Chen looked at her. “If you want to smile, then smile. There’s no need to hold it back. People should celebrate when happy. Furthermore, you’re so beautiful. If you don’t smile, it would be a waste.”

Bai Shishi turned to Long Chen. “It seems that your mood is very good. You rarely praise me.”

Clearly, Bai Shishi’s mood was not bad right now. Perhaps she was infected with everyone else’s joy, but this happiness was simple and pure. It was like they had returned to their childhood. She had no urge to stab Long Chen.

“Of course my mood is good. I’ve been promoted. In the future, I can properly brag. Just thinking about it makes me smile,” chortled Long Chen, very pleased.

However, on the flying boat, only the two of them were aware of the matter with the seventh branch academy. Long Chen didn’t state it too explicitly. He could only share how pleased he was with Bai Shishi.

“So you’re such an ordinary person that an empty title is so important to you?” Bai Shishi cocked her head at him.

“Of course it’s important. You have a real title, so that’s why you don’t care about an empty title. We both live in this world, so how can you avoid being one of the many commoners? Furthermore, once I establish the stronghold, I will claim that mountain as its king. My brothers will all come to me. Hehe, at that time, you will understand what a truly impressive sight is,” said Long Chen with a laugh.

The news of the Nine Prefecture Convention had spread far and wide. That told everyone that he was still alive, and they could calmly cultivate. Once they had raised their realms, they could gather once more.

This time, by coming out of the academy, he was prepared to do something big again, letting his brothers know that he had stabilized himself in the immortal world. Those who could come should hurry up and come for some good food and wine.

This something big was to rebuild the seventh branch academy. His name as dean of the High Firmament Academy’s seventh branch academy would spread far and wide.

Seeing Long Chen’s eyes unfocused as if he was in a beautiful dream, Bai Shishi was speechless. She then turned away, and when she did, she suddenly cried out.

“What is that?!”
