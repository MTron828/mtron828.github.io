Chapter 4687 Assistance Through Space

Within the Heaven Earth Cauldron, Long Chen was bound by countless heavenly fate chains to the point that he no longer looked human. Blood trickled down the chains that were clearly intent on crushing him to a pulp.

“Long Chen!”

Seeing this scene, Yu Qingxuan and Bai Shishi lost control and directly charged toward the heavenly tribulation. Despite knowing that they couldn’t help Long Chen, they could not just watch as he was crushed to death.

The rest of the Dragonblood Legion also made a mad dash toward him with only one thought in their minds: even if they had to die, they had to die with their boss.

Witnessing the Dragonblood Legion sending themselves toward their death, the ones attacking them immediately made a path for them.

Just then, a strange change occurred. A chain pierced through the void and struck the Heaven Earth Cauldron.

“What?!”

This bizarre phenomenon startled everyone. Did someone actually dare to interfere in Long Chen’s heavenly tribulation? Was that any different from sending themselves to their death?

People hastily looked at the source of the chain—a passageway through layers of space. At the very end of the passageway, they saw two indistinct figures, but they could tell that the two were women.

Even with multiple layers of space between them, they could tell that the two of them were peerless beauties.

“It’s Big Sister Chu Yao and Big Sister Ruyan!” Guo Ran cried out excitedly, and the Dragonblood warriors also recognized them.

“They’re also undergoing tribulation!” exclaimed Xia Chen as he could see lightning on their side as well. They were also within a heavenly tribulation.

However, their location seemed somewhat special, and the method of their tribulation also seemed different.

“I understand! Boss’s heavenly tribulation has torn through the walls of the world! After sensing his tribulation, they want to help him!” shouted Guo Ran.

Just then, that chain pierced the Heaven Earth Cauldron. The Heaven Earth Cauldron quivered, and an explosive power shot back through the chain.

BOOM!

Those two figures were sent flying, causing Guo Ran and the others to cry out.

Chu Yao and Liu Ruyan had endured a bit of the tribulation’s power for Long Chen. However, its power was so immense that they were injured. Guo Ran and the others had no idea how their injuries were, so they grew anxious.

Just then, another chain broke through the void and struck the Heaven Earth Cauldron, causing an icy chill to fill the world. It felt like winter had suddenly come.

“Big Sister Zhiqiu!”

The Dragonblood warriors cheered as they saw Ye Zhiqiu come to help.

One chain after another suddenly pierced through the void, coming through endless space, accurately striking the Heaven Earth Cauldron.

“Big Sister Meng Qi, Wan-er, Mingyu, Cloud, Little Snow...” Countless familiar auras rose. Seeing this scene, the Dragonblood warriors felt their blood boiling with excitement as they wept. They hadn’t expected all of them to appear at this time.

The chains struck the Heaven Earth Cauldron and pulled away some of its power, reducing the pressure on Long Chen.

Now, the chains binding Long Chen started to loosen, revealing Long Chen’s face once more.

“You meddlesome women, I almost succeeded! How hateful!”

A pair of pitch-black eyes appeared within the cracks of the heavenly fate chains. Those eyes were as dark as the underworld, so dark that they could devour all the light of the world.

As the heavenly fate chains loosened, the darkness in Long Chen’s eyes slowly retreated and vanished. All of a sudden, Long Chen woke up and started to fight the chains.

“Senior, what happened to me?” asked Long Chen. Just now, he felt like his consciousness was so blurry, as if he had lost consciousness.

The Earth Cauldron hesitated before replying, “Nothing. It’s normal to lose consciousness under such terrifying pressure. But congratulations, you passed.”

“This is...”

Only then did Long Chen take note of the situation outside, feeling many familiar auras revitalizing him.

Long Chen raised his head and roared, his fighting spirit exploding as if he had endless energy.

“Meng Qi, Chu Yao, Wan-er, Zhiqiu, Mingyu, Cloud, Little Snow! I can sense you all!” Long Chen’s fighting spirit blazed. “Wait, this aura is... Wilde, my good brother, you’ve also come!”

Long Chen actually sensed Wilde’s aura, exciting him. At this moment, Wilde’s pure and simpleminded appearance appeared in his mind. This foolish child seemed to have grown up.

“There’s another aura... This is... Li Chenggang! He also helped me!” Long Chen was startled.

He had only met this expert from the Calligraphy Sect a few times, so their relationship wasn’t very deep. Unexpectedly, he had also helped Long Chen in this crucial time, risking his life in the process. Li Chenggang was far too nice to Long Chen. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

“What is this aura filled with devil qi?” Long Chen suddenly paused, and an image of a violet-robed Zi Yan plucking a zither appeared in his mind.

“Zi Yan, wait for me!”

Long Chen’s heart shook when he thought of Zi Yan. Sensing a rather ominous feeling, he urgently wanted to see her.

Just then, the sound of a zither rang out in his mind, and it was extremely warm, like the caressing of a cheek. He felt endless emotion within this one sound.

Long Chen hadn’t expected Zi Yan to be able to sense his feelings and even reply with her zither. Now, his heart burned with an intense yearning as he found himself unable to lay eyes upon his beloved women. Fueled by frustration and determination, he vowed to shatter the Heavenly Daos apart.

Long Chen struggled crazily, causing the chains to rumble and boom. As the Heaven Earth Cauldron quivered again, the entire world’s laws grew chaotic.

“This brat is strange! Stop him, or you won’t be able to become the chosen one!” shouted the Celestial race’s Sage King from the other side of the gate.

BOOM!

One of the heavenly geniuses immediately attacked one of the chains striking the Heaven Earth Cauldron, wanting to stop them from helping Long Chen. As a result, this person’s divine weapon exploded, and blood sprayed from his mouth. He almost died.

“Ignore Long Chen! Kill the Dragonblood Legion! Save the world from this scourge!” Luo Changsheng shouted decisively. Holding his nine-ring battle saber, he charged at the Dragonblood Legion.
