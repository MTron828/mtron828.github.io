Chapter 2600 One Blow Breaks the Heavens

“You’re only a discarnate soul! How can you still use Violet Sun Fills the World?!” The elder of the Death Spirit race let out a horrified cry.

The violet sun illuminated all of Resentful Death City, dyeing everything in its color.

All of a sudden, the dark and sinister world became gentle, an aura of tranquility settling over it. The appearance of this violet sun had changed this entire world.

Long Chen was also enveloped by its light and felt endless warmth. He could feel the heartbeat of the world and the call of all living things. The thrum of the Daos pulsed in his head.

In that instant, he felt like the master of the world. The Dao existed for him; the laws prostrated before him. Everything within heaven and earth could be controlled with just a thought.

“This is a Sovereign’s manifestation?”

Long Chen was completely shocked. Now, he truly understood why Sovereigns were undefeatable.

Although this place was Resentful Death City, it was connected to the Martial Heaven Continent. At the same time as Resentful Death City’s aura poured into the continent, the continent’s aura also poured into Resentful Death City.

In Long Chen’s mind, the image of the Martial Heaven Continent appeared in the violet sun manifestation, and he could then hear the call of the Martial Heaven Continent. That feeling was very intimate, like a mother warmly rubbing his face, using her energy to support him.

“Do you feel it? These are the true Heavenly Daos of the Martial Heaven Continent,” said Sovereign Zi Yang.

Long Chen nodded. He felt it. It was extremely moving, to the point where he almost wanted to cry.

He had always thought that the Heavenly Daos wanted him dead, but now he knew that what harmed him was not the real Heavenly Daos. From Sovereign’s Zi Yang’s manifestation, he felt the warmth and support of the Heavenly Daos.

These Heavenly Daos were like a warm mother, whereas the Heavenly Daos that Long Chen usually encountered were an evil stepmother. The difference was immense. Long Chen was feeling this warmth from the Heavenly Daos for the first time.

“Long Chen, there are many unknown things in this world. You have to use your own power to investigate them. But there is one thing that you must remember. No matter what world it is, it cannot be perfect. The best things will always be mixed with the worst things. If you always pursue perfection, you will only be torturing yourself. If you expel all the impurities, there will be nothing left. Don’t let the darkness blind your eyes because there will definitely be light behind that darkness. Otherwise, the darkness would not exist. What is a true expert? It is someone who continues to believe that life is beautiful after facing the darkness ninety-nine times, someone who can use their full feelings to embrace this world,” said Sovereign Zi Yang.

Long Chen silently pondered these words. He understood what Sovereign Zi Yang was trying to say, but he was unable to do the same. He would never be able to achieve that realm.

The Sovereigns were existences with the entire qi flow of the Martial Heaven Continent condensed inside them. While the Martial Heaven Continent gave its full power to them, they embraced the continent’s people without seeking anything in return. They were sages who did their utmost for the world without asking anything in return.

No matter how much scum existed in the Martial Heaven Continent, no matter how much trash there was, the Sovereigns didn’t move to destroy them. Perhaps it was because the Sovereigns stood at a different height, and they could see the light behind the darkness.

However, Long Chen was unable to see it. He had never thought of himself as some sage because all he wanted to do was live with dignity. He didn’t care if someone else had a ‘light’ side to them behind their rotten exterior. Even if someone was a perfectly good person, if they wanted to kill him, he would fight to slay them first.

This was Long Chen’s character that had never changed and would never change. Although he understood the principles behind what Sovereign Zi Yan was saying, he was unable to accept them.

Sovereign Zi Yang simply smiled and patted his shoulder. “I’m just saying this in hopes that one day, when you fall into darkness and despair, you don’t give up. Work hard to see the light behind the darkness. Perhaps, the light is right behind you.”

In that instant, Long Chen felt light explode inside his mind. It was as if he had received some enlightenment, and yet he also felt like he hadn’t grasped anything at all.

After all, Sovereign Zi Yang was not such a long-winded person that would waste his precious time on saying useless things. Long Chen knew that he was pointing him to something, but it felt like he was too stupid to entirely understand.

“It’s fine if you don’t understand. Understanding isn’t much better anyway. Alright, I’m going to make my move.”

As Sovereign Zi Yang stepped forward, dragon roars instantly rang out.

After that, ten thousand dragons charged at Sovereign Zi Yang at once, and Long Chen covered his ears, his head almost exploding. Because of the pressure of the roars, blood even poured out of his eyes, nose, and ears.

“Fuck, what is this crap?!” Long Chen cursed inside. What a ruthless blow to his confidence. He was like an ant in front of these terrifying existences. Without Sovereign Zi Yang, he would be instantly crushed.

“That old fellow fought a Sovereign in his peak state for three whole days. Of course he’s terrifying. A Sovereign stands at the peak of that realm, so you’re still greatly lacking. You’ll understand once you enter the Heaven Merging realm,” said Evilmoon.

Long Chen wiped his eyes, leaving bloodstains on his face. He disdainfully said, “What’s so amazing about him? Didn’t I still manage to slap him in the face?”

Although that was what he said, Long Chen knew that he was just comforting himself. That slap was nothing more than luck because the elder had been focused on Sovereign Zi Yang.

After a while, Long Chen noticed a figure had stealthily come out of the altar. It was Ye Ming. At some point, he had also come out to watch.

“Fuck, let’s wipe him out right now!” said Long Chen.

“Don’t be delusional. You won’t be able to reach him. Just watch,” said Evilmoon.

The ten thousand dragons had formed a formation attacking and binding Sovereign Zi Yang. However, they were completely ignored by Sovereign Zi Yang, who moved straight toward the Death Spirit race elder.

“Ten Thousand Dragon Slaughter!”

At this moment, the Death Spirit race elder’s cane flashed, and the dragons transformed into runes, turning into a giant cyclone around Sovereign Zi Yang.

“Even after all these years, this technique of yours hasn’t improved much.” Sovereign Zi Yang flicked his finger, shooting out a ray of light. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

BOOM!

As a result, a tiny hole appeared within the twister, and it was like a balloon popping. The twister then instantly collapsed.

“Sorry, I don’t have much time. I can’t let you display your trump cards.” Sovereign Zi Yang suddenly slammed his hand forward. After that, the violet sun behind him vanished, and a new rune appeared on his palm. That rune looked like a tiny cauldron.

However, when the Death Spirit race elder saw that tiny cauldron, his expression completely changed. He clenched his bone cane, and light flowed out to envelop him.

A small ray of light then shot out of Sovereign Zi Yang’s palm. Like a sharp sword, it pierced through the elder’s chest, and his body exploded.

The violet light-sword pierced far into the distance, tearing through spacetime. Because of it, Long Chen saw a giant black hole appear within the void.

From that hole, he could see a world of darkness with no life. There was only decay.

Within it, he saw countless eyes and the faces of countless lifeforms that he had never seen before. They stared in shock as the light-sword passed over them.

Sovereign Zi Yan’s attack had not only killed the elder of the Death Spirit race, but he had also torn the wall between worlds and given Long Chen a glimpse into the Death Spirit World.

Long Chen gulped. Despite already dying, Sovereign Zi Yang still possessed this much power just as a discarnate soul. Then just how powerful was he in his peak?

“Do you regret it now?” sneered Evilmoon.

“Just a bit. If I had known, I would have kept this power in reserve. With the power of such an attack, who on the Martial Heaven Continent would dare to touch me?” Long Chen truly felt a bit regretful. How could he have known that Sovereign Zi Yang’s remnant power would be so terrifying? He hadn’t even said anything. Such a strong trump card had been wasted just like this.

At the center of the altar, Ye Ming fled once again after he saw this scene. On the other hand, the Death Spirit race elder was killed, but his cane continued to hang in the air, unleashing ripples.

“Zi Yang, you only have your discarnate soul left! You can’t kill me! In just half a year, I will recover, while you have exhausted your final bit of energy! You’re the final loser in the end!” The elder’s voice rang out from the cane. “You really are a fool. If you had continued to endure and waited for me to set foot onto the Martial Heaven Continent, then under the suppression of its laws, you would have had a chance to kill me. Last time you didn’t kill me because you didn’t understand the secret of the Death Spirit race’s source energy. This time you knew, but you wasted your chance. Tell me, don’t you think that you’re a fool?”

Sovereign Zi Yang nodded. “It truly is a pity. I originally was planning on preserving some energy to help lighten the pressure on him even after killing you. Conveniently, that is also a long-cherished wish of mine. However, he’s tough. He doesn’t need my power, nor does he want it.”

Hearing that, Long Chen almost wept. If he had known that the Sovereign’s power was so terrifying, he wouldn’t have wasted it no matter what. What if he encountered such a terrifying expert in the future? Then he would have no tears to cry.

However, an act still had to be carried out, so Long Chen glanced at the elder and indifferently said, “You’re nothing more than an old ghost. If you dare to step onto the Martial Heaven Continent, I’ll make sure that you can’t leave.”

“You’re domineering enough.” Sovereign Zi Yang smiled and then extended a hand, shooting rays of light throughout Resentful Death City.
