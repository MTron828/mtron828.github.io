Chapter 2617 Barbarian Blood Black Dragon

The Skyscraping World’s aura slowly entered the Martial Heaven Continent. It was a peaceful, auspicious aura that cleansed the soul and made people forget about the mundane world’s struggles.

The beautiful Yue Xiaoqian led the way. After that, Meng Qi, Chu Yao, Tang Wan-er, and the rest of the Dragonblood Legion cheered enthusiastically. Yue Xiaoqian could finally openly lead the original devil race’s warriors onto the Martial Heaven Continent.

Meng Qi and the others felt great pity for Yue Xiaoqian. Even though they had experienced countless dangers, at least they had managed to stay beside Long Chen’s side. Only Yue Xiaoqian was locked inside the Skyscraping World, so they were extremely sympathetic to her.

At this moment, the Martial Heaven Continent’s experts watched in shock as Long Chen walked over to Yue Xiaoqian’s side. He then turned to face the Martial Heaven Continent’s experts.

“I hereby announce that the original devil race is the Dragonblood Legion’s most loyal ally. Anyone who challenges them will be killed without exception.”

Long Chen’s gaze was charged with sharp energy. This was his promise to the original devil race. He would not allow anyone to harm them.

His voice rang through the air and was filled with undoubtable determination. Hence, people’s hearts shook. They rarely saw Long Chen act like this.

“Based on what? The original devil race is our mortal enemy. Just because of a word from you-”

Long Chen raised a finger, and a bolt of lightning blasted apart a shouting elder. That was a sect leader from the ancient family alliance.

“I’m not accepting backtalk today,” said Long Chen coldly.

“You’re too arrogant! Just because you have some support now, do you think you can act like this? Clearly, your ultimate goal was to destroy the Martial Heaven Continent from the start-”

With a point of Long Chen’s finger, another peak Netherpassage expert was killed despite using his full power to defend.

“As I said, I’m not taking any backtalk today. Those who want to die should all step forward. I don’t want to waste my time killing you one by one,” said Long Chen.

Countless people were stunned. Just what was going on with Long Chen? He wasn’t even accepting people asking questions?

“Today, I am announcing this to you, not asking for your opinion. Those who trust me, follow me. I will only risk my life for people who trust me. As for those who doubt me, I have no need to do the same. I also have no duty to explain myself to you. When it comes to the original devil race, understand this: I’m not giving any explanations. My goal is to protect those closest to me. If others want to benefit from that, I won’t decline, but if others want to become an obstacle, I will not hesitate to kill them,” said Long Chen coldly.

“When did this little fellow become like this? Is it a problem with the ninth form of Split the Heavens?” Qu Jianying was startled by Long Chen’s change.

“How is that possible? It will only affect his mind when he actually uses it. His actions are entirely correct. It’s already such a time, so who has time to explain themselves to everyone? Does an emperor need to explain himself to the commoners? A woman’s soft-heartedness will only ruin things,” said the old man.

“What does that mean?” asked Qu Jianying coldly.

“What? What does that mean? I’m just saying that men should-”

“The thing that you said just before,” reminded Qu Jianying.

“A woman’s soft-heartedness…” The old man suddenly turned away, not daring to look at Qu Jianying.

“You old thing, I’m just a woman, so why don’t you explain what you mean by that?” Qu Jianying glared at him.

The old man had carelessly said something wrong, so he looked at Long Chen and said, “Perhaps Long Chen has a good explanation. My mouth just randomly spouted some words.”

Suddenly, a new group of people arrived. Even before they appeared, a strong fishy smell had surfaced.

“The sea demon race?”

Last time, the sea demon race was given a vicious lesson by Daoist Heavenly Feather, and they had been silent ever since then. Later on, there were rumors that Long Chen had gone to the sea demon race and apologized. Under the divine families’ mediation, this matter was temporarily suppressed, but no one was clear on whether or not these rumors were true.

However, the majority of people felt that such a thing was not likely. Long Chen even dared to kill the Sovereign sprout of the divine families, so how could he possibly lower his head to the sea demon race?

Nevertheless, some people also guessed that he had lowered his head in order to unite the Martial Heaven Continent against its enemies. That was why Long Chen had endured such a humiliation.

There were different versions of the rumor. Some said that the sea demon race had a terrifying expert that even the High Priest couldn’t provoke, forcing Long Chen to lower his head.

Some even said that Long Chen actually had the blood of the sea demon race in his veins, or he wouldn’t have the Dragon Blood Battle Armor. Perhaps his blood had returned to an ancestral state.

In any case, there were many rumors that were hard to believe. Some fellows who had nothing better to do always came up and spread such things. They were quite good at acting like they knew more than other people in order to give them a sense of importance.

Due to this, some ignorant people had once more started to suspect Long Chen’s identity. The Dragon Blood Battle Armor truly was not a human technique. If Long Chen was from the sea demon race, wouldn’t that be bad for the continent?

Hence, everyone was shocked when the sea demon race appeared at such a time. Even Long Chen hadn’t expected them to suddenly appear.

Their leader was a very tall woman with a wide shoulder. She wore black scaled armor with exposed arms, which were very white but also coarse. As for her appearance, she had golden hair, a tall nose, and heavy-set pale blue eyes. Her body was quite muscular, with an upside-down triangular form.

Behind her were three men, and one of them made Long Chen almost cry out. Wasn’t that the expert from the Six Horn Sea Serpent race? He had clearly killed him.

However, Long Chen quickly realized that while they were very similar, their auras were a bit different. This person’s aura was slightly weaker.

The other two had auras on a similar level, and they followed close behind the woman like servants. Hence, Long Chen’s heart shook. This woman’s identity was definitely not ordinary.

Everyone’s attention was immediately drawn over to her. No one could sense her aura, but just looking at her made people feel an innate reverence.

When that woman was just three hundred meters from Long Chen, both their bodies trembled. Blood Qi soared out of them, and white and black scales instantly covered their bodies.

“What’s going on?!”

Everyone was startled. The heavens changed color, and a dragon roar rang out. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

Long Chen narrowed his eyes. This woman actually possessed dragon blood as well, forming a resonance with him. His dragon scales automatically appeared.

“The barbarian blood black dragon race. Why would they appear on the Martial Heaven Continent?” Evilmoon was also surprised.

“What is going on?” asked Long Chen stealthily.

“She’s part of the black dragon race, which is specialized in power. According to reason, a place like the Martial Heaven Continent couldn’t possibly produce a barbarian blood black dragon with such a pure bloodline,” said Evilmoon.

Just as they were silently communicating, the woman finally spoke.

“You stole what belongs to me.”

Her voice made everyone jump. Despite it not being loud, the world rumbled and seemed to echo her words.

After that, those with weaker cultivation bases retreated, feeling as if their own Blood Qi was starting to go out of control. This woman was absolutely terrifying.

“You mean the azure dragon reverse scale?” asked Long Chen.

“Correct. It is mine. I spent tens of thousands of years bitterly cultivating just to obtain it, but when I came out of seclusion, it was stolen by you,” said the woman coldly.

Tens of thousands of years? The experts other than a select few like the High Priest were stunned. Just what kind of origin did this woman have?

“As expected. She most likely was sealed in a fetus-like state in order to absorb the Martial Heaven Continent’s aura. Then she would be able to take the azure dragon reverse scale,” said Evilmoon.

“Why couldn’t she just directly take it?” asked Long Chen.

“You don’t understand. This dragon scale’s master was born and grew up on the Martial Heaven Continent. Its dragon vein starts here. The birth of a true dragon is a condensation of an entire world’s lifeline. Although the current Martial Heaven Continent is fractured and damaged, the dragon vein is not completely destroyed. To obtain it requires one to be a lifeform with the Martial Heaven Continent’s aura. Otherwise, you would not be able to obtain its recognition. If you tried to forcibly subdue it, the dragon scale would rather break than submit,” explained Evilmoon.

“She used tens of thousands of years to be recognized as a lifeform of the Martial Heaven Continent? Isn’t that too much?” asked Long Chen.

“What do you know? That’s a true dragon reverse scale. The true dragon is an existence born by the heavens. Although that essence blood wouldn’t help her increase her combat power, it would allow her to break through her limitations as a black dragon and become a true dragon. It doesn’t matter whether it’s the evil dragon race, the black dragon race, or the spirit dragon race, they are all unable to compare to the true dragon race. There is a qualitative difference between them, as the true dragon is the emperor of the thousands of dragon races. Ask yourself, who doesn’t wish to be the emperor of the world? Who doesn’t want to stand at the peak of this world?” Evilmoon snorted disdainfully at Long Chen’s ignorant question.

Only then did Long Chen understand just how valuable this dragon scale was.

Seeing him not reply after a long time, the woman demanded, “What, after stealing my thing, you’re going to act like a mute?”
