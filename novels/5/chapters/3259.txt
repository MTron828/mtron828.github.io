Chapter 3248 Peakless Pill

The sound of a broom sweeping across the ground was constant. At this moment, an elder was sweeping the floor, and beside him stood another elder. The latter was the High Firmament Academy’s dean.

“Long Chen has agreed to it. But I still feel like we are starting a bit too soon. There are still no omens,” said the dean respectfully.

“There’s no choice but to be a bit early. It is precisely because the situation is unclear and the lines of fate are muddled that this must be done. By the time things are clear and the omens have arrived, it will be too late. We are all within the board. No matter how wise you are, can you beat the player controlling the board? Moreover, Long Chen exists outside the board, not restricted by heaven and earth. It said that rashness is worse than calmness, but calmly waiting for that chance to come is worse than taking the initiative and messing up the board some more. In any case, you won’t be constantly controlled,” said the sweeping elder, neither quickly nor slowly.

“But so many powers are watching in secret. If we do things wrongly, then…”

“Right and wrong are relative. There is no absolute right or wrong. Something might seem right at this moment, but after a few centuries or millennia, you will find that it was wrong. Being wrong isn’t something to be afraid of. The real worrisome thing is being so worried about being wrong that you don’t dare to take action. After waiting and waiting, your chance will slip out of reach and you will be fully and truly defeated. We all know that the peace of the immortal world will soon end. It would be best to take action ahead of time. The player waits for the opportunity to ripen, but what is there for us to wait for? If Long Chen is not the destined one, he won’t be able to cause any waves before they’re drowned. There’s no need for you to worry. If he is the destined one, then he exists to defy the heavens. The board will then be flipped. None of the pieces will be able to make the moves that they are supposed to make. That is bad to the player, but good for us. So, don’t be afraid of being wrong. The board is already like this. Even if you want to make the wrong move, there are no wrong moves to make,” said the sweeping elder.

“Disciple understands. But this operation is too dangerous. Should we not notify the Battle God Palace and have them secretly protect him?” said the dean.

“No. The Battle God Palace’s power cannot be exposed.”

“But if we let Long Chen go just like this, it’s no different than sending him to his death.” The dean frowned.

“There is no way around that. Some things look dangerous on the surface, but aren’t actually dangerous. Some things look safe, but can cause a calamity. Long Chen is not like other nine star heirs. He is not so reckless. Since he has agreed, he definitely has his own method. You just need to watch in secret. Are you anxious because your granddaughter and grandson are going?” The sweeping elder suddenly paused and looked at the dean.

The dean was embarrassed and nodded. “If Long Chen goes, Bai Xiaole would be enraged if he didn’t get to go as well. If such a big thing was kept from Shishi, who knows what that stubborn girl would do? After all, she has always been the most outstanding in her generation. If she doesn’t participate in this mission, she will find it unacceptable. It really is a headache.”

Bai Xiaole had now become Long Chen’s faithful follower, the kind that couldn’t be thrown off even if Long Chen tried. After returning from the Luo family’s territory, Bai Xiaole’s entire temperament changed. Because of it, even his father and mother were moved.

The current Bai Xiaole was no longer a child but a true expert who could stand tall. Furthermore, he had begun seriously studying pupil arts from his mother, and the amount of work he was putting in was gobsmacking. He was like a completely different person.

As for Bai Shishi, although she expressed indifference toward the conflict between the Luo family and the Chu family, the dean was well aware she was not happy about this matter.

However, that was not the academy’s matter, and she didn’t have any deep relationship with the Luo family’s disciples. Because of this, Long Chen hadn’t brought her, and there was no way for her to fault him for that.

Even so, the dean could clearly feel that she was displeased over it. If this matter with the branch academy was also kept from her, her stubbornness might make her feel that the academy no longer cared about her and was focusing on Long Chen. That would have terrible consequences.

But to have a group of children go to such a dangerous place, how could the dean be at ease? No matter how high his cultivation base, no matter how dignified his status was, those were still his grandchildren.

Although he didn’t normally show concern for these children, he secretly watched their growth. His emotions were simply buried within his heart.

If these two children were to go with Long Chen without any accompanying experts to protect them, how could he possibly be at ease?

The dean was embarrassed to have this question posed to him. After all, although he had posed his concerns with dignity, the truth was that it was out of selfishness.

The sweeping elder smiled. “The children have grown, and it is time for them to go out for tempering. You cannot protect them for a lifetime. Don’t worry, Xiaole and Shishi are not fated to die young. Let the children go in peace. The future of this world belongs to them, and they will create that future themselves.”

Hearing that, the dean relaxed quite a bit. He thanked the sweeping elder and left.

…

Zheng Wenlong’s efficiency was truly great. On the third day after he left, the Huayun Trading Company’s people sent over an ocean’s worth of ingredients for refining pills.

Those were all the materials that Long Chen needed, and they could not be grown. For example, the essence blood of spirit beasts, gold essence, earth essence, wind spirit stone powder, Xuan water essence, etc. As for plants, he could obtain them in the High Firmament Academy and grow them in the primal chaos space. He could get as many as he wanted.

Coincidentally, Huo Long also awakened at this time. It had devoured the flame devil’s core and was finally able to maintain human form. After that, the first thing she did was hug Long Chen.

Huo Linger was still as fiery as fire. She was very cute, the kind of cuteness that made people like her from the bottom of their hearts.

Also, Huo Linger’s flame energy had grown immensely. However, the flame devil’s flames were restricted by the immortal world’s laws. Rather than strengthening Huo Linger’s flames, they had caused the amount of energy that she could hold to increase by over a hundredfold.

Even though there was no qualitative rise, that was no problem. Looking for higher rankings Heavenly Flames could be done slowly. Anyway, the High Firmament Academy’s Heavenly Flames were all very ordinary, and there was no need to waste money to buy them.

With these materials, Long Chen immediately got to work. He used the Demon Moon Furnace to refine the powders and used the Moon and Star Refining Furnace to refine the powders into pills.

The Daynight Furnace’s god seal had been destroyed by Long Chen, and the item-spirit’s slave seal had been absorbed and erased by Lei Linger. Hence, this pill furnace was renamed by Long Chen to the Demon Moon Furnace.

However, this pill furnace was incredibly powerful. With an item-spirit present but not the ability to control it, he could only use it to refine powders. Through refining these powders, the pill furnace’s item-spirit slowly got stronger. Once its spirituality was strong enough, it could finally work together with Long Chen to refine pills.

Four Peak pills were refined for Four Peak experts based on their needs. There were many kinds of them, and they were normally named by the main requirement.

For example, Bai Shishi required metal energy as her number one priority. Then her Four Peak pills would be called Metal Peak Pills.

The Luo family focused on the bloodline, so their pills were called Blood Peak Pills. Long Chen first refined two furnaces of Blood Peak Pills and then let Huo Linger and the Moon and Star Refining Furnace refine them themselves. After that, he sat to the side and considered the pills that he needed.

After passing his tribulation, the Violet Tower Star’s pill formula appeared in his head. But there was also another formula, the formula for the Peakless Pill.
