Chapter 3910 Old Double Supreme Monsters

For a Divine Venerate to merge their Supreme Blood and Supreme Bone was a million times more difficult than it was for an Immortal King. But someone had actually succeeded.

Furthermore, it was not just one person. Four people succeeded at once. It was like they had discussed things beforehand and agreed to come at the same time from all four directions.

“Switch to defense!” shouted Xia Chen.Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

BOOM!

The twenty-seven hundred Dragonblood warriors coughed up blood at the same time, unable to stop the attacks from these four peerless experts. As a result, their formation instantly collapsed.

Those four were old monsters with white hair. In the three thousand worlds, they could be considered living fossils. They had endured for countless years just for this chance.

BOOM!

Xia Chen went all-out to block one of them, only to be blown back by a single attack. He appeared incredibly weak compared to this elder. Apparently, this elder was not at all weaker than Yin Changsheng, the Nine Underworld Luocha, or Ji Wuming.

Meng Qi, Bai Shishi, the Pill Fairy, and the others hastily tried to assist. However, they were too far, had no time, and were dealing with their own powerful opponents. Thus, they turned pale with fright.

BOOM!

Just as the four of them reached out for Long Chen, a coffin appeared, opening and swallowing Long Chen inside of it. The four of their attacks then struck the coffin at the same time.

“Scram!”

As a cold shout rang out, those four terrifying monsters grunted and tumbled back.

“Mo Nian!”

Xia Chen cried out in delight. Mo Nian had appeared above Long Chen and used this ancient coffin to protect him.

“It’s a sign of respect to bury people vertically…” Mo Nian smiled after protecting Long Chen in his coffin, but he quickly felt that he had misspoken. “Cough, a misunderstanding!”

Just then, those four old monsters roared and charged back. They were Divine Venerates whose Supreme Blood and Supreme Bones had merged, so they were unstoppable.

“Protect boss!”

The Dragonblood warriors roared and gathered once more, preparing to protect Long Chen.

But all of a sudden, Mo Nian pointed his bow at one of those old fellows. As he pulled back his bowstring, the mysterious palace in his manifestation twisted, giving some mysterious power to his bow.

“Limitless Cloud Piercer!”

At this moment, Mo Nian’s unrestrained brashness was gone. His expression was solemn, and his aura had even grown more dignified.

When Mo Nian let go, the arrow instantly crossed through heaven and earth, creating a straight line of pure death.

Seeing such a terrifying attack, that old monster blocked with all his power, but his defenses were like paper in front of that arrow. As a result, he was blasted out of existence along with his weapon.

A dark residue, akin to a black line, lingered in the world where the arrow had passed. Then, in an instant, it erupted in a cataclysmic explosion, causing the fabric of heaven and earth to collapse.

“What kind of power is this?!”

Startled cries rang out. They had just seen four Double Supreme Divine Venerates appear and dominate the battlefield, and Mo Nian instantly wiped one out.

“His manifestation contains sacred energy?”

Although Mo Nian’s energy just now was bizarre, it seemed to contain some kind of sacred energy, which could be considered faith energy.

At that moment, people understood why Mo Nian wasn’t affected by Yin Changsheng’s faith domain. So he also possessed such a power.

“I, Mo Nian, am right here! Anyone who wants to die should come right now!”

Borrowing the intimidation effect after killing that terrifying old fellow, Mo Nian raised his bow arrogantly, looking down on all the heavenly geniuses present.

“Die!”

While Mo Nian’s words scared off the others, he couldn’t scare off the furious Yin Changsheng. With his spear, he pierced toward Mo Nian.

“How many times can you unleash a technique that extracts the power of your manifestation, huh?!” shouted Yin Changsheng.

BOOM!

This time, Mo Nian didn’t dodge. He swiftly and accurately swung his bow to intercept the tip of Yin Changsheng’s spear.

As a result, his spear bent under the impact, and a spring-like force sent them both flying. After perfectly receiving Yin Changsheng’s attack, Mo Nian sneered with contempt, “I don’t know how many in total, but it should be no problem to slaughter eighty idiots like the last one.”

“Keep bragging! If you can unleash such an attack ten times, I’ll eat everyone’s shit!” wagered Yin Changsheng.

“Ah, no wonder your mouth is so smelly. It really was from eating shit. Such a gamble is meaningless. To you, eating shit must be no different than eating a feast,” said Mo Nian with a comprehending nod.

“Die!” Yin Changsheng exploded with rage. In an instant, the figure behind him trembled, and his spear radiated a scorching blaze of divine light. With his divine might rapidly intensifying, Yin Changsheng launched into another fierce attack, channeling all his power into the strike.

Seeing this phenomenon, everyone was trembling. This was the same move that Mo Nian had just used to kill that Double Supreme Divine Venerate. So, Yin Changsheng was also capable of unleashing such a move.

Just as everyone thought that a heaven-shaking exchange would occur between the two of them, Mo NIan’s figure swayed, and he barely dodged in time.

Going through Mo Nian, Yin Changsheng’s spear blasted the void apart, as if the very world was torn through by it. Unfortunately, its power was shocking, but it didn’t strike its target.

“You…!”

Yin Changsheng almost spat out blood. He had never expected that even after extracting the power of his manifestation, he would be unable to lock down Mo Nian. Just as he was thinking of finally determining who was stronger, he ended up wasting all this energy.

“Aiya, is your vision that bad? You missed even at this close range?” Mo Nian laughed after dodging, adding salt to the wound.

“Let’s see how you dodge now!”

Yin Changsheng suddenly turned his attention to Long Chen and the coffin he was in, charging toward it.

“So you want to play this game? So naive. Why don’t you try and hit it?”

Mo Nian looked at him derisively, having an arrow on his bow pointed at Yin Changsheng. The power of his manifestation then flowed into his bow.

At that moment, Yin Changsheng’s hair stood on end. He was already locked down. If he tried to attack the coffin, Mo Nian’s arrow would definitely strike him. Naturally, Yin Changsheng wouldn’t throw away his life just to attack this coffin.

First of all, it was unknown if he could break this coffin in one attack. And even if he could kill Long Chen, this attack from Mo Nian would take his life.

“Shameless bastard!”

Feeling like he was going insane, Yin Changsheng stamped on the air and shot back at Mo Nian. Then, just as he predicted, as soon as he switched his target, Mo Nian put away his bow and continued dodging, refusing to fight him directly.

Yin Changsheng cursed him furiously. After that, he shouted at those three old fellows to keep attacking Long Chen’s coffin. But they had been subdued by Mo Nian’s arrow, not daring to attack again.

Yin Changsheng howled, “You idiots! What are you waiting for?! If you just sit there, Long Chen will fully absorb the sacred dragon scale!”

Yet, to his dismay, his roar elicited no response, so Yin Changsheng gritted his teeth in frustration. “Flame qilin, attack!”

Suddenly, a flaming meteorite descended from the heavens, flying straight toward Long Chen’s coffin.

Within these flames was a mountain-sized flame qilin. At this moment, its aura was actually even stronger than Yin Changsheng’s.

When the flame qilin appeared, Mo Nian’s expression changed. He had thought that the flame qilin was in Yin Changsheng’s spiritual space. Unexpectedly, it came flying out from a completely different direction.

From this flame qilin’s powerful aura, Mo Nian knew that it had the ability to break the coffin. Thus, he wanted to stop it, but Yin Changsheng was already prepared and had fully sealed all his paths to Long Chen.

Meng Qi and the others also tried to stop it, but their opponents unleashed a sudden assault, not giving them that chance.

In the critical moment when the flame qilin was about to reach the coffin, a sudden gust of wind swept through the surrounding area. From the depths of the void, a snow-white claw emerged, extending outward and forcefully striking the flame qilin directly on its head.

BOOM!

The impact caused the earth to explode and astral winds to rage in a furious tempest, leaving behind a trail of holes and scars. At the same time, the snow-white claw exerted an immense force, firmly pinning the flame qilin into the ground, rendering it powerless to resist.

Following that, an enormous wolf whose entire body was snow-white appeared. When everyone from the Dragonblood Legion saw this magnificent creature, an outpouring of jubilant cheers resounded throughout their ranks, shaking the very heavens.
