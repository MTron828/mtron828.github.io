Chapter 3795 Heaven-Shaking Tomb

“Fuck, what are you thinking about? Even if I hate that shameless fellow, I won’t really try to kill him. I’m talking about other business.” Mo Nian shook his head.

“Can you not change the subject so suddenly then? You scared me!” Long Chen really had thought that Mo Nian’s big business was to join forces against his master, making Long Chen sober up from his drunk state.

“Brother, let me tell you. The three thousand worlds are hiding a huge secret. It’s a heaven-shaking secret. An entire era is buried there. Based on my years of archaeology experience, I already have a general grasp over where that giant tomb is,” said Mo Nian.

“We’re going grave robbing? Whose tomb is it?” asked Long Chen. He was also interested. That expression of Mo Nian’s told him that it was truly a huge piece of business.

“I don’t know whose tomb it is, nor do I know what is hidden within it. I crossed several large areas after entering the three thousand worlds. I saw the mountains and plains. I saw the flow of water. Based on the movement of the sun, moon, and stars, I am sure that there is a huge tomb underground. Let me put it to you this way: after joining the Limitless Palace, my immoral master might make me fume with rage, but he also taught me many things. My vision is definitely correct. I went there once. Although I just probed the outer edge, it made my hair stand on end. It was so dangerous that I ultimately retreated and decided to only try it again after becoming an Immortal King. As my brother, you have to help me. However, I still feel like just the two of us aren’t enough. It would be best if you call over Guo Ran and Xia Chen. If the four of us join forces, we should be able to consume this business,” said Mo Nian.

“It’s that terrifying? Even after becoming an Immortal King, you still feel like you don’t have any assurance?” Long Chen was surprised. With Mo Nian’s current power, what was making him so cautious?

“Perhaps I don’t have as much combat experience as you, but I guarantee that no one within the nine heavens has a greater sense of danger toward underground dangers than me, with the exception of my master. After I left that region, the Spirit Mountain Heavenly World opened. I was originally planning on undergoing tribulation somewhere else, but that place was closest to the tomb, so I tried to find some clues within the heavenly tribulation. Guess what happened? Some terrifying monsters appeared within the tribulation. Those monsters brought dark auras with them. Despite them having an Immortal King cultivation base, they made me piss my pants. Furthermore, while undergoing tribulation, I had to look after your brothers in the Dragonblood Legion, so things almost went out of control.

“At the very end, the number one warriors of the nine heavens appeared, the nine star heirs. They started fighting with those monsters. Let me tell you, they were practically the real monsters as they killed those dark monsters. If it weren’t for them, we really might have been doomed. In the end, the nine star heirs and the dark monsters killed each other off. We profited off of their fight and absorbed a huge amount of thunderforce. It could be considered a perfect tribulation. I feel like the reason that the dark monsters and the nine star heirs were manifested by the heavenly tribulation was because of the tomb. The most terrifying thing was that when the tribulation was ending, terrifying phantoms appeared in the sky. Yin Qi covered the sky. However, I don’t know if it was because the tribulation ran out of power, but they ultimately didn’t manifest. I don’t know what they were. To tell the truth, when those phantoms appeared, I was terrified. I even thought about giving up on that tomb. It’s my first time feeling such a thing in this lifetime. However, now that you’re here, I’m in high hopes again. If you can find Xia Chen and Guo Ran, a peak Formation Master and a peak Forging Master, it should increase our odds and make it worth taking the risk,” said Mo Nian.

“That does sound very dangerous, but enticing. You really are evil,” said Long Chen.𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Mo Nian had definitely done this intentionally. He knew just how intensely curious Long Chen was. He managed to draw out Long Chen’s strongest primal desire.

“You’re sure this is big business?” asked Long Chen carefully.

“I swear, it’s definitely big business, of an unprecedented size, so big that it’s unimaginable!” swore Mo Nian.

“Fuck, then let’s do it!” Long Chen clenched his teeth and waved his cup.

Mo Nian laughed delightedly and touched his cup with Long Chen’s. They once more drank, and this matter was set.

The two of them continued to drink a few more cups before they also collapsed and slept on the ground like dead hogs.

It was a sweet sleep, Long Chen’s most refreshing sleep since arriving in the immortal world. He slept for three days. When he woke up, his mind was completely refreshed. He felt full of power.

According to reason, cultivators didn’t need to sleep. But sometimes, this most primitive state could bring some special benefits.

Mo Nian woke up at about the same time as Long Chen. As for the other Dragonblood warriors, they were still asleep. A beautiful attendant was waiting for every single one of them. It went without saying that this kind of service was worth a rental fee of one hundred million immortal king crystals.

The two of them had just woken up when attendants came to wait on them, washing their faces. Long Chen was not used to being served, but Mo Nian had long since gotten accustomed to such a thing.

“Brother, you need to learn how to enjoy life. You have to think about relaxation in order to stay in your peak condition,” said Mo Nian.

“Haha, once you meet Liu Zongying, I hope you can still maintain such a thing,” laughed Long Chen.

“Hehe, that’s why people must enjoy the present, otherwise, they won’t have such an opportunity in the future,” said Mo Nian, not in the least concerned.

Mo Nian wasn’t worried about Liu Zongying. The Immoral Daoist had promised him that she was absolutely safe. That was the only reason he could focus purely on archaeology.

After freshening up, Long Chen and Mo Nian both looked different. One was like a dazzling star, and the other was like an immortal Daoist. Those attendants looked at them fondly.

However, while they saw their handsome sides, they didn’t see the murderous aura within Long Chen or the wretchedness within Mo Nian.

“Let’s go. I’ll bring you to see some people.” Mo Nian brought Long Chen out of the palace.

“Your social circle is quite big!” Long Chen was surprised.

“But of course. If you are to go out, how can you not have any friends?” said Mo Nian, bringing Long Chen to a manor.

To possess any land within Clear Sky City where every inch was worth an enormous sum, the owner had to be an amazing figure. When they walked into the manor, someone immediately warmly greeted them and brought them to a room where there was already a feast prepared.

Mo Nian didn’t stand on courtesy. He sat Long Chen down and started eating. This was a wedding reception. After just eating a bit, new people came in to eat and drink. But when the newlyweds came in, they were startled.

“Brother, I’m sorry, I don’t quite recognize you. You’re…?”

Long Chen was surprised. Was this person not Mo Nian’s friend? He looked over at Mo Nian, only to find that the latter was gone from his seat. Looking into the distance, Long Chen saw that little fellow rubbing his mouth and fleeing.

“What the fuck?!” Long Chen was dumbfounded.
