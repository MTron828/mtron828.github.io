Chapter 4187 Fight?

With a slash of the saber, two Heaven Venerates became headless corpses, unable to form the slightest bit of resistance in front of that saber.

Although these two elders were not innate Heaven Venerates, they were still incredibly powerful. But they should not have sneak attacked Long Chen.

When their spiritual attack was shattered by Long Chen’s will, the backlash shook their souls. With their souls in chaos, their minds practically turned blank. As a result, Long Chen’s saber could instantly sever their necks while they stood there like blockheads. In essence, their fates were sealed the instant they attacked Long Chen.

As the two Heaven Venerates of the Xu family were slain, a cascade of violet blood rained down. Seeing this scene, Luo Bing sighed. It was over. This enmity could no longer be settled.

However, Xia Chen, Guo Ran, and the others almost clapped. This retribution was perfect as these fellows were too hateful.

After a moment of shock, the Xu family’s experts were enraged. Their disciples then took out their weapons, their eyes blazing with killing intent.

However, what startled them was that their mighty family head didn’t do anything after that. Some of them looked at him, only to see him staring at a certain space.

When they followed his gaze, they noticed that a large man like an iron tower had appeared in the air behind Long Chen and the others at some point.

This man appeared to be in his thirties, with tanned skin and flowing long hair that cascaded naturally. Not a hint of his aura leaked, rendering it impossible to discern his cultivation level.

Standing in the air, he was like a nail that had been nailed into heaven and earth. If they hadn’t seen him here, they wouldn’t have been able to sense his existence at all. However, when they did look at him, it was like their souls were clutched by an invisible hand.

It was as though just a thought from him would be enough to wipe out all life. He was silent, just looking at the Xu family’s head.

This individual was the master of the Battle God Palace, and his arrival at this pivotal moment was not by chance. Long Chen had summoned him.

Back then, Bai Zhantang had given Long Chen a spiritual jade. If something that he couldn’t deal with by himself happened, he could activate it and the palace master would personally come.

Long Chen had already activated the spiritual jade when he decided to kill these people. That was the reason the Xu family head had abruptly stopped just now. Only he had managed to sense the presence of the Battle God Palace’s master.

“Fight?”

The palace master eyed the Xu family head for a long time before finally spitting out a single word. This one word contained a heaven-shaking battle intent, and the very laws of the world changed because of it.

Seeing that this existence could cause the heavens to quiver and the earth to rock with one word, the Xu family’s experts were all shocked and terrified. They had to circulate all their power just to resist this invisible pressure.

Xia Chen, Guo Ran, Bai Shishi, Bai Xiaole, and the others were all excited. They hadn’t expected the Battle God Palace’s master to be so terrifying. He was practically a god. With the support of such a terrifying expert, who would they need to fear?

“Who are you?” demanded the Xu family head.

The palace master simply looked at him coldly, not replying. He was frighteningly silent.

“He is the High Firmament Academy’s Battle God Palace’s master! His name… his name isn’t for the likes of you to know!” shouted Guo Ran. The main thing was that Guo Ran didn’t know his name either.

Let alone him, even Long Chen and Bai Shishi didn’t know it. The palace master’s identity was top secret in the High Firmament Academy.

“High Firmament Academy?” The Xu family head’s expression twitched.

Standing beside Long Chen, Guo Ran replied, “That’s right! And this person is our High Firmament Academy’s youngest dean in all of history, Dean Long Chen! Isn’t your Xu family very arrogant? Using numbers and seniority to bully juniors, why don’t you just keep going? The palace master has already said what needs to be said. Are you fighting or not?”

Seeing that the palace master was such a terrifying existence, Guo Ran immediately used him to put these people in their place. He wished that they would try to fight the palace master.

“Family head, let me.”

Just then, a person appeared beside the family head. He had violet runes covering his entire body, looking like tattoos.

“What powerful Blood Qi!”

Sensing his power, Guo Ran and the others were startled. Luo Bing and Luo Ning in particular jumped in shock. This person’s violet blood had been condensed to the pinnacle and was erupting like a volcano. With him around, the world grew illusory, like everything was underwater.

This was a terrifying innate Heaven Venerate. He had been behind the family head the entire time, and no one had noticed him. But now that he stepped forward, heaven and earth changed because of his existence.

When he circulated his violet blood, it felt like heaven and earth were recognizing him as master. The power of heaven and earth was his to command.

“His violet blood energy is even purer than our family head’s!” exclaimed Luo Bing.

“It’s powerful but not necessarily purer,” said Long Chen, shaking his head.

Long Chen had once exchanged blows with Luo Zichuan, and Luo Zichuan had personally taught him. Thus, Long Chen knew far more about Luo Zichuan’s power than them.

Back then, Luo Zichuan was only in the Immortal King realm, but his violet blood’s purity far surpassed that of this innate Heaven Venerate. The only reason Luo Bing had such a feeling was because she was unable to tell the difference between quality and quantity.

When this innate Heaven Venerate stepped forward, the palace master’s eyes lit up. A divine radiance that made people shudder flickered in his eyes.Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

“Hold it!”

Suddenly, the Xu family head stopped this innate Heaven Venerate. Looking at the palace master, he said, “It was nothing more than a minor matter. There’s no need to fight.”

“Family head, you…!” That innate Heaven Venerate was stunned. He hadn’t expected the family head to really retreat. He almost couldn’t believe it. It had to be known that Long Chen had just slain two of their experts!

The rest of the Xu family were also stunned. Just who was this palace master to be capable of making the Xu family retreat?

“Dad?”

That girl called Xin-er looked at Bai Xiaole’s Violet Pupil Nine Tail Fox, clearly unwilling to let it go. After all, she had never been denied anything she wanted.

“We’re leaving!”

This time, even the family head who pampered her did not listen. Just as he turned away…

“Hold it!”

This time, it was Long Chen’s turn.

“Brat, do you want to die?”

The man who led the Xu family’s young disciples turned to him furiously, his killing intent exploding out of him.

However, Long Chen didn’t even look at him. He instead turned his gaze to Bai Xiaole.

“Xiaole, what do you want? You are my brother, and you cannot be bullied for nothing. Do you want her eyes or her life? Boss will help you find justice.”

Upon hearing this, the expressions of all the Xu family’s people changed. They all clutched their weapons angrily.
