Chapter 2896 Competition Begins

“What hole did you roll out of? Did you think your red hair could disguise you as a red-haired tortoise? After being in the academy for so long, did you not learn any manners? I was talking to him, so why are you interjecting?” sneered Long Chen, casting a sideways glance at that red-haired man.

Long Chen originally didn’t want to waste the saliva on talking to these idiots, but Mu Qingyun’s side didn’t have people who knew how to curse back, so he could only step up.

“Courting death!” This red-haired man was Xiang Kejie, a powerful flame cultivator. As soon as he was angered, flames burst into existence around him, turning him into a man of fire and forcing everyone near him back.

“Wow, how amazing!” Long Chen praised him, staring at him with a shocked expression.

“Now you realize this? It’s too late! Long Chen, today, I will-”

“What an amazing technique! If you die, there’s no need for anyone else to do anything. You can just directly cremate yourself without troubling anyone else! Great!” Long Chen raised a thumb at him.

Hearing this, Xiang Kejie almost coughed up blood. Just as he thought that Long Chen was shocked by his power, this sudden turn made him reel.

Other disciples laughed. They were shocked at his power at first, but Long Chen’s comedic ability truly wasn’t ordinary. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

After that, Mu Qingyun and the others’ gloom gradually faded. They no longer felt as vexed. Furthermore, Long Chen’s easy-going appearance did make them feel some confidence.

“Long Chen, if you’re a man, bring out your real ability. A glib mouth doesn’t make a man,” interjected the green-eyed man with the hat on his head. He was Devil Eye Yang Fang.

Long Chen shook his head, wagging his finger at him. “First, it was noble night Chu Kuang who spouted bullshit first. Second, the mouth is also an ability. The Dao is transmitted through the mouth. A glib mouth is the foundation of an instructor. You don’t have that ability. Third, I’m very curious, which master managed to teach all of you this ability to help a dog eat shit? Fourth, and this is the one I’m most curious about, may I ask if you have a dual cultivation Dao-companion?”

Devil Eye Yang Fang was surprised by the final question. He didn’t overthink it. “Of course, and not just one.”

“Oh.” Long Chen nodded as if with sudden comprehension. He pointed at his hat. “No wonder your hat is that color. Love blinds you until you’re green.”

Yang Fang’s hat actually wasn’t an ornament. It was a Spirit item that assisted him with his Devil Eye.

Calling it his green hat was his taboo[1]. It had been years since someone had even dared to mention such a thing in front of him. But now Long Chen said it in front of all these people.

“Long Chen, you are looking to die!”

“With all of you smelly fellows here, do I even need to look?[2]” Long Chen waved his hand under his nose.

“You…!”

Chu Kuang and the others almost exploded with rage. If they were fighting with their mouths, they simply weren’t a match for Long Chen. They finally experienced just how tough his mouth was. One word could choke them all. At this time, their faces were swollen like pigs, and Mu Qingyun couldn’t help being happy. Just the ability of his mouth was something to envy.

In the trial hall, he forced a magistrate to lower his head and apologize to him. Here, he cursed a group of people into being speechless. All the disciples here could be said to have experienced Long Chen’s awesomeness.

The funniest thing was that every time he spoke, the surrounding disciples would laugh and cheer along, supporting him.

Their oppressive entrance plus Chu Kuang’s display of oppressive power had shaken Mu Qingyun and the others’ confidence, but just with Long Chen’s mouth, the tables had turned. Now it was the Unfettered Alliance’s disciples whose morale was soaring.

“I can’t be bothered to waste words on you. We’ll settle the winner in a bit!” Chu Kuang had nothing else to say but to throw out some tough words.

“If you can’t be bothered to waste words, why did you still run over to talk bullshit? Is there too much shit in your heads? You can’t help but spout it? Or is it that your roasting last time caused that shit to ferment? Or did my slap break your head?” said Long Chen disdainfully. After losing in the cursing battle, Chu Kuang just had to say such an empty phrase. It was truly irritating.

“Long Chen!” Chu Kuang’s voice hissed out from the cracks between his teeth. His hatred toward Long Chen could no longer be expressed with words.

Suddenly, the sound of a bell shook everyone’s hearts. After that, the disciples hastily took their positions.

Three chairs appeared in the sky, one in the east and two in the west. Long Chen and the others were in the east.

“Why does that chair look so familiar?” mumbled Long Chen.

“Of course it’s familiar. You’ve sat in it before,” laughed Mu Qingyun. Wasn’t that precisely the head judge’s seat?

Just as she said this, the head judge also materialized on top of the seat.

To the west, Chu Huairen and the other magistrate also appeared. There was one in the east, two in the west, facing each other.

“It’s rumored that this divine competition is also a bet between the head judge and the two magistrates. Apparently, the head judge is very dissatisfied with the Chu family. He has tried to suppress them multiple times and failed, so it seems he wants to use this divine competition to compete with the two magistrates.”

“If it’s actually a gamble, then the head judge will definitely lose. The power disparity between the two sides is too great.”

Although most of the disciples here supported Long Chen, admiring him for his courage and eloquence, power was power. This was not a gamble in which luck would decide the winner.

“Could ants like us understand the bets between giants like them? Don’t waste your time guessing. Just watch the result in peace, right?” said another disciple. Whoever won or lost had nothing to do with them.

“I wonder if it’s possible for us to assert to the head judge that Chu Kuang is cheating,” whispered Mu Qingyun.

The head judge was also looking at Long Chen. When Long Chen saw that gaze, he shook his head. “No need. They’re cheating. But isn’t it the same as how you drew me in as well? What you need to take note of is that this divine competition might not have as many rules to speak of. This is not playing around. This is a true battle and people might die. Be prepared.”

Just at this moment, the sound of a bell rang out once more. The entire plaza instantly became illusory and faded away. Long Chen and the others seemed to have been transported to another world.

“The divine competition starts now!”
