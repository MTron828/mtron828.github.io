Chapter 3692 The Number One Flashy Man of Past and Present

“This fellow also came?”

As soon as Long Chen heard the phrase, he was delighted. He hadn’t expected Mo Nian to also be in this region.

However, if he was around here, why was it that he hadn’t come to see Long Chen after he had caused such a huge fuss?

Following that, loud drumming rang out. Over ten experts were beating drums together. Their leader once more shouted, “The limitless palace in front of the limitless mountain, the limitless trees before the limitless gate, the dreams of heavenly geniuses vanish without a trace as soon as they encounter Mo Nian!”

They then beat their drums again. Long Chen looked over all of them and didn’t see a trace of Mo Nian.

“Fuck, shut up! Did someone die?! What are you shouting for?!” Someone was unable to endure the ruckus and cursed them.

However, no matter how others cursed them, those people continued to sullenly shout the same line over and over again.

“Fuck, keep doing that and I’ll break your heads!” One expert finally blocked them with a blade.

That expert had just stepped forward when the leader of the group had a sword appear in his hand. He then struck as quickly as lightning, slashing off that person’s arm.

That person was shocked. If he hadn’t dodged fast enough, he would have been cut in two. He hadn’t expected this group of fools to actually have an expert amongst them.

“Fuck your mother, you bastard! Do you think that I want to do this?! If it weren't for this stupid curse, would I embarrass myself here?! Fuck, who doesn’t like it?! Come out and I’ll kill you! Who dares to come forward?!” shouted that man, his voice full of hatred and resentment.

He reached out and tore the clothes on his chest. When they saw his body, even Long Chen gasped.

There was a strange hole in his chest. It was around the size of a person’s fist, and black qi was circulating within it. That black qi contained the aura of death.

Looking more carefully, that black qi seemed to have something hairy wriggling inside of it. But it was unclear. That scene gave others chills.

“Fuck, after being cursed, I wish I could die! If you have guts, come and kill me! I’ve long since wanted to die, but I just don’t have the courage to kill myself. Come and kill me! If you kill me, the curse will transfer to your bodies! Do you want to test it?!” That person’s voice was heart-breaking. It was almost crazy, terrifying others.

“That’s the Corpse Devil Curse! What a vicious move!”

A startled cry rang out when someone recognized the origin of that black qi. They clearly knew just how terrifying this move was.

“Fuck, I’ve lost my entire family’s face. I have to spend all day repeating this trash! If I don’t, the corpse poison will devour my soul, paining me until I long for death. Not only that, but I have to shout it somewhere with many people around! Only once enough people hear it does the pain lessen. Stop looking at me and just kill me! In any case, I don’t want to live anymore.” After saying that, this person began beating the drums with the others once more. 

“The limitless palace in front of the limitless mountain, the limitless trees before the limitless gate, the dreams of heavenly geniuses vanish without a trace as soon as they encounter Mo Nian!”

“Big brother, that’s about enough. Activate the photographic jade!” reminded one of the drummers at the rear.

A photographic jade was activated. After that, people saw a big fatty and a little fatty.

When they saw the big fatty, the expressions of the senior experts all changed.

“The Bloodkill Hall’s master, Enpuda!”

Enpuda’s name was something that terrified countless seniors. He was an extremely sinister assassin willing to use any means necessary to achieve his goals. Thus, he was called the despicable assassin, the human devil Enpuda.

They all felt great trepidation toward him. Upon seeing his face, their nerves instantly tensed.

They didn’t know if this was a prelude to Enpuda coming to kill people. All they knew was that Enpuda’s methods were unfathomable. Perhaps some of the monsters that had come here had drawn over his assassins. Thinking of this, quite a few people felt a cold chill on their backs.

As everyone’s attention focused on the big fatty, Long Chen, Guo Ran, and Xia Chen instantly recognized the small fatty. It was Mo Nian.

Suddenly, they heard an explosive sound. Mo Nian took out a shovel and solidly slapped Enpuda’s face with it.

“What?!”

The experts were all filled with disbelief. Someone actually slapped Enpuda in the face?

Most bizarre of all, that little fatty was kneeling on the ground. As for Enpuda, he came flying out of the ground only to be smacked in the face by the shovel, which resulted in him smashing a hole in the ground.Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

Just as everyone was bewildered by this scene, that person put away the photographic jade and continued drumming.

“The limitless palace in front of the limitless mountain, the limitless trees before the limitless gate, the dreams of heavenly geniuses vanish without a trace as soon as they encounter Mo Nian!”

“Hey, little brother, can you activate the photographic jade again?” asked an elder.

That person directly said, “A hundred thousand immortal king crystals! You can buy it and watch it as many times as you want!”

“A single immortal king crystal can buy a hundred thousand photographic jades! Now, you want a hundred thousand immortal king crystals for one photographic jade?! Why don’t you just go rob others?!” raged the elder.

“Then you can buy a hundred thousand and go away. Don’t get in my way. I have to continue working. “The limitless palace in front of the limitless mountain…”

“Fuck, give me one!” Despite knowing he was being scammed, the elder paid a hundred thousand immortal king crystals. That person then happily received them.

“What are you smiling for?! You deserve the Corpse Devil Curse!” The elder was extremely displeased after paying.

However, that person seemed to be used to being cursed like this and didn’t get angry. He directly left after receiving the money, continuing to drum into the depths of the Violet Flame Heaven Capital. Watching as this group of people left, people suspected that this curse was fake. Was this a scam to make money?

However, the photographic jade wasn’t fake. People watched it repeatedly. It really was Enpuda who was slapped in the face. Enpuda had even activated his World King Divine Radiance and his faith halo. That could not be fake.

People surrounded the elder and discussed the photographic jade. Guo Ran couldn’t help sighing. “When it comes to showing off, I’m still a level inferior to Mo Nian. Perhaps only boss can suppress him.”

“I’m not interested!” Long Chen rolled his eyes.

Suddenly, a torrent of blood flew in the distance. They also heard a sound as if someone was being sliced apart. Startled, Long Chen and the others just managed to see that group in the distance being slaughtered. They then let out a cry of disbelief.

“Ji Wuying?!”
