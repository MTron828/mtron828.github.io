Chapter 4663 Killing a Nine Star Heavenly Doyen

Like a phantom, Long Chen emerged out of nowhere and caught the expert by surprise. Before the expert could even sense Long Chen’s presence, he already found himself caught in Long Chen’s grip.

With a deafening sound, Long Chen blasted him apart, turning a generation’s genius into a rain of blood.

His fresh blood tainted the lightning runes, dyeing them red. It was an astonishing sight, and it sent shivers down everyone’s spine.

“A nine-star Heavenly Doyen, a monstrous heavenly genius, died just like that?”

No one dared to believe their eyes.

Heavenly Doyens were revered as beings blessed by the world’s karmic luck. Among them, this individual stood as the epitome of strength. Hence, in theory, his death should have been impossible. Even if he had thrown himself into danger on purpose, he would have been able to escape every time.

Many had seen nine-star Doyens fighting each other before. Peak experts on their level could shatter mountains and rivers, obscure the sun and moon, and fight for seven days and nights without pause.

However, this nine-star Doyen had just died in one blow, without any chance to fight back.

“No!”

Just then, hundreds of thousands of experts cried out mournfully. The slain expert was their race’s peak genius.

They had placed unwavering trust in their leader, with some even speculating that their young master would emerge victorious against Long Chen. Unfortunately, they had been dreaming too much.

“A nine-star Heavenly Doyen? Tch, I thought they would be more of a challenge.”

Long Chen slowly unclenched his hand, now stained with the fresh blood of the slain nine-star Doyen. The blood still pulsated with formidable Doyen power, emitting powerful fluctuations.

Despite the Doyen’s demise, his will remained in his blood. As long as the blood remained intact, his will would persist indefinitely.

Long Chen took out a handkerchief and slowly wiped the blood away before discarding the handkerchief. Remarkably, the handkerchief floated through the tribulation, all thanks to the protection of the essence blood.

The handkerchief drifted directly toward the grieving individuals, who were already overcome with mournful cries.

“You goddamn human, one day you will pay dearly for this! With your blood!”

“Then let’s not wait for another day,” Long Chen retorted with a snort, his hand clenching suddenly. The sky trembled as a lightning sword erupted forth.

At first, this lightning sword was only three feet long, but it rapidly grew once it left his hand. By the time it left his lightning waterfall, it had transformed into a heavenly blade.

However, these people weren’t afraid of him, knowing that Long Chen’s attack would be weakened by the heavenly tribulation. Furthermore, they stood outside the tribulation’s bounds. Feeling safe, they continued to curse Long Chen and his ancestors.

As they continued their tirade, their fury gradually transformed into sheer terror. The lightning sword was already upon them.

“What?!”

BOOM!

It accurately pierced the formation barrier around them and exploded within their ranks, obliterating hundreds of thousands of experts in one go.

Regardless of their status, whether they were Divine Venerates or Heavenly Doyens, none could withstand the onslaught of this attack.

“How can this be?!”

People were filled with disbelief, especially Netherdragon Tianzhao, Yan Tianhua, and the others who had tried to attack Long Chen, only to witness their efforts falter before reaching their target.

Unbeknownst to them, Long Chen’s attack only grew in power while passing through the tribulation, all thanks to Lei Linger. She had absorbed a portion of the laws of the Heavenly Daos and was starting to gain a certain level of control over them. This enabled her to condense some of the tribulation’s power into her attack.

Most importantly, her split bodies had supplied some extra power to the lightning sword before it shot out, and that was why this sword was so terrifying. It was a joint attack from Long Chen and Lei Linger. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

However, others didn’t know this, so they thought that Long Chen could defy the laws of the heavenly tribulation, leaving them in shock.

Just then, heaven and earth shuddered, and the very void started to distort, as if something was attempting to break free from its confines. Within the swirling maelstrom, observers caught a glimpse of a gate taking shape.

“The gate to the ninth heaven has appeared!”

“There is another world hidden behind the gate, a lost world! Whoever opens it will be the favored one of that lost world!”

BOOM!

Just then, Long Chen’s heavenly tribulation grew once more and merged with that of another expert. Like the one before, this expert attacked Long Chen as well.

He was a thirty-meter giant with one eye, his head bald but having marks like a tortoise shell on it. Holding a steel rod in his hand, he charged straight at Long Chen.

As the runes of the rod lit up, a whistling gale erupted, causing countless cracks to appear in the void as if the very sky would shatter from his attack. His power was concentrated to a terrifying level.

BOOM!

However, to everyone’s surprise, a single fist from Long Chen intercepted this terrifying attack. Sparks flew along with a metallic ringing sound. Long Chen didn’t even budge, while the one-eyed giant staggered backward several paces.

Every step of his left behind cracks in the void akin to shattering ice. When he finally regained his footing, everyone gasped. His divine weapon had been completely deformed, resembling a fire poker now.

It was rather comical, but no one laughed. Everyone was only shocked. When they looked at Long Chen, they saw him still in his punching posture, and a layer of blood-colored scales twinkled on top of his fist.

Despite deforming the giant’s divine weapon with a single strike, Long Chen’s fist bore only a faint white mark, which swiftly faded away.

“Heavens, what kind of physical body does he have?! How can he face Saint weapons with his bare hands?!”

Everyone was shocked. The giant’s weapon possessed a powerful aura, so it had to be at least a Saint weapon. How could it deform just like that?

“Die!”

This giant was decisive. With blood still dripping down his hand, he let out a roar and charged back. The tortoise shell marks on his head covered him. In an instant, a desolate qi erupted and enveloped him in strange flames.

“Did he just ignite his essence blood?!”

Shocked cries rang out. This one-eyed giant was actually so ferocious that he had ignited his essence blood, putting everything on the line against Long Chen.
