Chapter 3016 Bring You Out

Luo Bing and the others stared in terror at that giant. Its entire body was covered in runes. When it woke up, the sound of the heartbeat vanished, but instead, its terrifying pressure slowly crushed them. Even its voice caused this entire space to shudder.

It felt as if as long as it shouted, it could blast them to pieces. The person who wrote the bone book wanted someone to subdue it? What a giant joke.

Challenge it? How were they supposed to challenge it? Everyone looked at Long Chen and Bai Shishi. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

“That’s right, we came to challenge you. Activate the formal ceremony,” said Long Chen fearlessly. In his arrogance, he actually included Bai Shishi in his words, causing everyone to jump.

The giant spread its hand. A snow-white ball of light appeared in front of Long Chen and Bai Shishi.

“Place your hand on it and we can start,” said the giant.

“Big fellow, prepare yourself. I’m going to…”

Long Chen suddenly grabbed Bai Shishi’s hand and pressed it down on the globe of light.

Bai Shishi had never expected Long Chen to say such big words with such an arrogant expression just to con her.

Long Chen was quick as lightning, but Bai Shishi’s reaction was even faster. Just as her hand was about to touch the globe, golden light appeared on her hand, and Long Chen felt like he was grabbing an oily mud fish. With a light pull, Bai Shishi escaped his hold.

By the time that Long Chen reacted, his hand was already pressing against the globe. Space seemed to solidify. Everyone stared at Long Chen.

“Serves you right.”

The Heaven Female Alliance’s disciples were originally infuriated when they saw Long Chen con Bai Shishi, but seeing him only con himself, they instantly grew delighted.

Bai Shishi looked at Long Chen’s lifeless expression and slowly smiled.

“What are you smiling about?! This was a huge opportunity, and I actually selflessly gave it to you, but you refused to accept my kindness!” raged Long Chen.

“Please, this opportunity should be left to you. I wish you good fortune.” Bai Shishi’s smile made her even more beautiful. But she clearly didn’t believe in his good intentions.

Just at this moment, the light enveloped Long Chen, and he appeared in front of the giant. The light then spread to cover the entire fighting ring. This light was actually a barrier. Once the barrier was formed, they were unable to hear anything through it.

The terrifying aura from the giant also faded. It felt like a giant mountain crushing them had suddenly vanished.

“Will brother San be alright?” asked Mu Qingyun worriedly. He was like an ant in front of that giant. It was like a single finger could crush him.

“He’ll be fine. This should be a trial. Although this giant is terrifying, it doesn’t have any killing intent. It won’t be killing anyone. That’s why Long Chen would think of conning me,” said Bai Shishi.

Hearing that, everyone relaxed slightly. The Heaven Female Alliance’s disciples felt slightly less malice for Long Chen. Both Long Chen and Bai Shishi had known that this giant had no killing intent, which was the only reason he messed around with Bai Shishi.

Long Chen looked up, and then even further up. This terrifying giant was far too big.

“According to my agreement with Ying Lu, if you can defeat me within the same realm, I will recognize you as master. However, they left me here for too long. While in slumber, I inadvertently condensed a king crystal. No matter how I suppress my cultivation base, I can only suppress it to the peak of the Four Peak realm of your human race. I suppose in order to be fair, as long as you can endure the power of a tenth of my Four Peak realm, it will count as your victory. How is that?” asked the giant.

This giant spoke calmly, but it was like thunder in Long Chen’s ears. It felt like his head would split open.

“Brother, can you speak quieter? My head hurts.” Long Chen held his head. This giant was too terrifying.

“Alright, I’ll do my best to whisper.” The giant nodded and really did lower its voice. However, even then, it caused space to rumble. But at least it was better than before, and his head no longer hurt.

“Let’s start.”

Just as the giant was about to make its move, Long Chen suddenly said, “One moment. How long has it been since you fought with anyone?”

“I don’t know. After losing my bet with Ying Lu, I promised to stay here and wait for people to challenge me. But no one ever came. Then I repeatedly fell into slumber. I have no concept of your human race’s time,” said the giant.

“Then it’s been a long time since you’ve fought?” asked Long Chen.

“Yes.

“Then are you able to accurately control a tenth of your power?” asked Long Chen.

“It’s not easy, but I can try,” said the giant hesitantly.

Long Chen instantly began to sweat. If the giant could accurately control itself to the peak of the Four Peak realm, perhaps it was winnable.

However, this giant hadn’t fought in who knew how many years. If it didn’t control itself properly, wouldn’t he simply be crushed?

“Then I think we should give up on it. There’s still a bit of a problem with my cultivation technique, and I can’t use my full power. I’m at too much of a disadvantage.” Long Chen shook his head.

“Ah? Then you're giving up?” The giant seemed a bit disappointed.

“I don’t necessarily want to give up. I just want to see if we can find a fair way to compete. That's right, you should be from the Heavenly Stone Spirit race, right? The race said to keep their promises the most in the nine heavens and ten lands,” asked Long Chen.

The Heavenly Spirit Race was not part of the human race. Instead, they could be considered stone spirits. They were born from heaven and earth, some of the lifeforms with the longest life spans within this world.

They were said to have kind dispositions, but weren’t too friendly with the human race, because throughout history, they had suffered countless times at the hands of the human race. Wars had erupted between the two sides, causing hideous casualties.

The Heavenly Stone Spirit race’s experts’ cultivation technique was simply sleeping. They could sleep for thousands, tens of thousands, or even hundreds of thousands of years. If they weren’t disturbed, they usually only woke up when they advanced.

After asking some questions, Long Chen learned that this Heavenly Stone Spirit expert was tricked. After losing a bet, it promised to wait for someone to defeat it and become its master.

Once its master died, it would have accomplished its promise. But even after so many years, no one challenged it. It ended up sleeping all the way until now. The Starry River Sect was already destroyed, but it was still sleeping. It wasn’t even aware of what was happening in the outside world.

Upon reaching this point, Long Chen suddenly smiled like a wolf looking at a little sheep.

“Brother, let’s not fight. Why waste the effort? Just directly accept me as master, and I’ll bring you out, restoring your freedom. How is that?”
