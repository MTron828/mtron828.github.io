Chapter 3575

The battleship whistled through the air at great speed, and Long Chen was placed at the core. The view was best here.

From this spot, he could see endless mountains, plains, and bodies of water, but he didn’t see any signs of human construction along the way. Even once they reached the core of the Alldevil Star-Field, he didn’t see any humans.

The majority of this world was wild territory. Even the native experts with maps of the Alldevil Star-Field could only move about in a small area. This world was truly filled with endless potential.

However, to excavate that potential, they had to construct more strongholds and cities. With the cities as the focus points, they would slowly spread, taking over more territory.

The human race had once been so glorious that they occupied half of the Alldevil Star-Field’s land. Regretfully, the human race lost to their own greed. Their former cities and strongholds had long since become covered in wild grass, broken by the encroachment of mighty trees. There was already no way to tell what they originally looked like.

Tu Hu controlled the battleship, pointing out some things to Long Chen on the way. He pointed to some ruins of cities, explaining their history.

“Even an iron wall can break if the interior crumbles. The human race’s power does not need to be questioned, but their greed can blind their eyes, not letting them see clearly.” Long Chen sighed. He had seen such a thing many times. It didn’t matter where he went, this was the common problem amongst the human race.

“To tell the truth, in our current state, we really can’t see much hope. The higher-ups are too stupid,” interjected one of the disciples of the Heavenly Dragon Divine Armor College.

“Silence! How can you rattle the army’s hearts?!” shouted Tu Hu angrily.

“Senior apprentice-brother Tu Hu, aren’t you just trying to lie to yourself? To tell the truth, the reason we follow you is because of your character. If we have to all die together, then at least we won’t be alone. If it weren’t for you and senior apprentice-brother Guo Ran, we wouldn’t even have the desire to fight. The higher-ups are constantly fighting amongst themselves, forming factions that are still fighting each other. There is no way to pull against this crazy tide of the devil beasts with them being like that. What hope do we have?” said that disciple.

After that, Tu Hu wanted to chide him. Yet, after thinking a long time, he could only clench his teeth and say nothing. Clearly, he was also very dissatisfied with the higher-ups.

“Just because you can’t see hope doesn’t mean that there isn’t any. Why complain about the higher-ups? If you have the energy to complain, why not go improve yourself? You can become the higher-ups. Your life is in your own hands. Only complaining is the most useless thing. That will only get you in the habit of pushing the blame onto others. In that case, even if your cultivation base reaches that height and you are in the position of the higher-ups, your attitude will not change, and you will live to become the existence that you detest,” said Long Chen, shaking his head.

Long Chen’s words caused everyone to fall silent.

“Perhaps you feel like you were born at the wrong time. Even before you grew up, calamity struck. That is very unfair to you. But look back at history. Which illustrious figure grew up in a world of peace? Which one wasn’t forced to soar through adversity, to climb out from a pile of their enemies’ corpses? You feel like this is the worst era. That is from the viewpoint of the weak. But to someone strong, this is the best era. Whether or not a blade is sharp always depends on whether the whetstone is strong enough. It is the hard times that create the hero. Every dark era causes heroes to rise up. Don’t look at things from the viewpoint of a supporting role. That is too pitiful. We will be the main characters of this era,” said Long Chen.

“Senior apprentice-brother’s teachings are right.” That disciple that had been previously chided by Tu Hu nodded.

Long Chen smiled and patted him on the shoulder. “Don’t be so pessimistic. All things have two sides. You see how dark humanity’s character is. But that is also how bright humanity’s character is. Do you know? In the outside world, countless young cultivators just like yourselves are trying to charge through the chaotic spatial gateway. They are doing their best to learn what is happening inside the Alldevil Star-Field.”

Long Chen told them about what he had encountered just outside the Alldevil Star-Field. Upon hearing this, everyone’s heart was moved. They thought that the Alldevil Star-Field had been forgotten by the rest of the world. Unexpectedly, there were still so many people willing to risk their lives to charge through.

“How embarrassing. The outside world hasn’t abandoned us, but we’ve given up on ourselves,” said Tu Hu dejectedly.

“Senior apprentice-brother Tu Hu, it was me who said those demoralizing words,” said that disciple apologetically.

“So what if you were the one to say it? The main thing is that I was thinking the same thing,” said Tu Hu, glaring at him.

“Hahaha!” Everyone laughed at that. The tense atmosphere was wiped away.

“Senior apprentice-brother Long Chen, what is going on with the spatial channel?” asked a disciple.

They knew that the spatial gateways leading to the outside world had been closed. They were all guarded by devil beasts, but these disciples didn’t know the exact situation.

It was only after Long Chen explained that they learned that the spatial channel only allowed Divine Lords to enter, and that the wild spatial blades inside would kill even Divine Venerates. But even so, there were still so many people trying to reach them through it.

Although it might sound very foolish, it was also very moving. Those people all hoped to find the rhythm or spatial node of that spatial channel and construct a stable channel. If they could, they would have a way to send reinforcements and save them.

They had not been forgotten. They were not alone. This one point alone gave them endless hope.

After encountering Long Chen, their negativity was swept away. They saw hope and felt full of power. Sometimes, the power of the mind was indescribably marvelous. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

After a few more hours of flying, Tu Hu and the others got off of the battleship. They then patrolled the surroundings for a long time before entering a secret transportation formation. After that transportation, they once more flew off.

The Alldevil Star-Field had quite a few secret transportation formations that could save people’s lives at a critical time. It also allowed them to carry out missions in secret without the Alldevil race being aware of it.

However, the Luo clan and quite a few other powers had betrayed them, resulting in many secret transportation formations being exposed and destroyed. Only a small portion remained. Without them, it would be even more dangerous to send supplies.

A day later, Long Chen finally saw a world covered in a heaven-shrouding grand formation. Tu Hu smiled.

“Senior apprentice-brother Long Chen, this is the Heavenly Dragon Domain. It is overseen by our Heavenly Dragon Divine Armor College. We are absolutely safe here.”

The battleships appeared and got close to the formation. After that, the battleships and the formation’s surfaces had various differing runes lit up.

The battleships then stopped at the edge of the formation. Everyone walked off and went through a checkpoint. This was to avoid enemies sneaking their way in. If Tu Hu and the others displayed anything strange, the formation would instantly kill them.

Tu Hu and the others were long since used to it. They brought Long Chen to the checkpoint, but when they saw the people there, Tu Hu’s expression changed.

“Not good. It’s actually them.”

Just then, the people in charge of the checkpoint spotted Tu Hu and the others. Originally, they were sneering at them with disdain, but when they spotted Long Chen, their expressions changed. They instantly summoned their battle armors and surrounded them.

“How brazen, Tu Hu! You actually dared to bring a spy back with you! Guards, come bring him away!” shouted their leader.
