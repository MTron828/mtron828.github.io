Chapter 3246 Becoming Dean?

Xu Zixiong said that he was about the same as the rest of them, but after spending just one month with Long Chen, he had completely transformed.

If Xu Zixiong was telling the truth, then staying here would be a very wise option. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

“It’s very simple for you to become disciples of the High Firmament Academy. You just need to pass the exam. But if you want to follow me, then let me say that Boss Long San doesn’t keep trash by his side. Not everyone is qualified to be like Xu Zixiong. Even if you become disciples of the High Firmament Academy, you won’t definitely get to follow me. So think this through. In my eyes, all of you are novices with quite a bit of arrogance. I don’t even know where this confidence of yours comes from. The Bloodkill Hall has issued the Bloodkill Order on me. I trust you understand what that means. Without sufficient power, following me is no different than courting death. If you die, then you die, but the main thing is that I would lose face. In the future, wherever I go, I will be the focal point. If you want to be my attendants, you have to have the corresponding power.”

Long Chen’s voice rang out. Only now did those disciples realize that Long Chen had been secretly watching them.

His voice was indifferent and contemptuous, like a king’s voice. Quite a few people disliked this as this was clearly an insult.

But there was nothing they could do. Long Chen was too powerful. Even his weakest subordinate, Xu Zixiong, was so powerful that none of them could last more than three exchanges against him.

“Stop looking down on others! Our families, backgrounds, aptitudes, and everything else are all amazing! Our future cultivation paths are wide and open roads, as our elders have long since arranged things for us. Even if we can’t beat you now, you’ll be tossed behind us in the future!” shouted one of those experts from outside the domain.

“What a joke,” said Long Chen disdainfully. “Does having a family, background, and aptitude mean that you can become an expert? Only an idiot like you would believe it. A good blade must be sharpened. True experts are made through slaughter, while all of you are greenhouse flowers who don’t know crap! Don’t think that being a Primal is something to brag about. Let me tell you, even if Qin Feng was in the Divine Flame realm, in a one-against-one, not one of you would survive three blows of his saber. Trash that hasn’t even set foot into the battlefield dares to spout such big words? Everyone around you must have lied to you to make you think that you’re unrivaled. In truth, you are all trash. If it weren’t because you had come from so far away and that it could count as we are drawn together by fate, I wouldn’t even bother to say anything.”

“You’re too arrogant!”

When Long Chen called them trash, those experts were fully enraged. They all looked like they were about to throw themselves at Long Chen.

“When is Boss Long San not arrogant? You should just return to where you came from and continue living around a bunch of boot-lickers. Pray. Pray that your family’s power continues to rise, otherwise, once a battle erupts, people like you will only be pigs for the slaughter,” said Long Chen. He then turned and left.

These people were truly a group of children. In their families, due to their talent, they had servants praising them, so they weren’t much better than idiots. No matter what he said to them, they wouldn’t understand. He had already given them their chance.

Once he left, those experts felt awkward. What were they supposed to do now? They were unwilling to leave just like this, but if they stayed here, they would feel a bit shameless. No matter what they chose, they would lose face.

“Xu Zixiong, we’re all from the Heavenly Star Domain. I’ve also heard of you. Is this Long Chen really so powerful?” asked one of them suspiciously.

“I don’t know how powerful he is. But a single slap from him is definitely more than enough to kill all of you. Since you know me, you should know the awkward position of my family. You should also know how powerful I am. I kindly advised you, but you actually suspect my boss. I, Xu Zixiong, am quite foolish, but I didn’t expect you to be even more foolish,” said Xu Zixiong coldly, his friendliness vanishing now that they were suspecting Long Chen.

“How about we stay for a while? Otherwise, if we leave like this, what will we say?” proposed one of them.

All of them had said that they would defeat Long Chen and bring photographic jades back to prove it. If they returned empty-handed, what about all that bragging?

“Fine. We’re already here, so we might as well treat it as a vacation,” said another expert.

With those people taking the lead, quite a few people ended up staying in the academy. For some, they felt like they were humiliated and wanted to leave.

However, what were they supposed to say when they got back? After all, all that bragging would come to bite them.

As a result, over five hundred disciples from outside the domain decided to stay. Fortunately, the High Firmament Academy accepted them easily. As long as the disciples followed the rules and paid the tuition fee, the academy didn’t restrict their freedom beyond that.

Furthermore, this was the oldest academy of the nine heavens and ten lands. Although it had declined, its foundation was still shocking. Staying here, they could learn many things. That would also count as not leaving empty-handed.

Over five hundred Primals joined the High Firmament Academy just like that. But the academy didn’t express much joy over it. It was completely an attitude of if you want to stay, then stay. But if you want to leave, then leave. Everything was done according to the rules, and they weren’t given preferential treatment.

As a result, more and more of those disciples felt that the academy was unfathomable. Furthermore, after experiencing the academy’s scripture pavilions, they began to enthusiastically search for things related to their cultivation techniques.

In the High Firmament Academy, you could get practically whatever you wanted as long as you had money. Hence, these hedonistic children were finally shaken.

Upon entering the academy, these disciples began to charge up the rankings. The heaven rankings were for Four Peak disciples. But ever since Bai Shishi and the others had entered the Four Peak realm, the names on the heaven rankings had completely changed.

The Heaven Female Alliance occupied half of the top hundred, while Bai Shishi was ranked one. Her position was unshakeable.

As for Long Chen, Qin Feng, Bai Xiaole, and the others, they weren’t interested. Long Chen didn’t bother competing with Bai Shishi.

With the addition of these experts, the rankings changed once more. The top hundred in particular would change with every passing day. The competition was exceptionally intense.

The entire academy grew livelier due to their addition. As a result, the competitions on the martial stages continued from dawn until dusk.

However, Long Chen ignored all of this and went into seclusion. He had to calm down and comprehend the things that Luo Zichuan had passed down to him. Using them, he would recreate the first form of Split the Heavens.

But just as Long Chen was going into seclusion, the deputy dean found him. “The academy has a mission for you. Are you willing to complete it?”

“What mission?” asked a startled Long Chen.

“How does being the dean of a branch academy sound?” asked the deputy dean with a smile.

“What?” Long Chen couldn’t believe his ears.
