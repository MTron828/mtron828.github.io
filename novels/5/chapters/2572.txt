Chapter 2561 Clash of Divine Items

Ye Zhiqiu was holding her Ice Divine Sword, and in a blink of an eye, it vanished and reappeared in Daoist Heavenly Feather’s hand.

The moment it happened, a streak of cold light swept through the air. This cold light was not aimed at the old woman. It swept behind Long Chen and the others, going far into the distance.

A river of ice appeared wherever the light passed. Space was frozen; laws were frozen. People felt as if that Sword Qi had frozen the void.

As a result, a chilling wind filled the air. The cold was so intense that it could freeze their souls.

Daoist Heavenly Feather hadn’t summoned her manifestation nor accumulated any power. It was just a casual swing of her sword.

From a distance, it looked like a crescent moon of ice had appeared in the void. Just as it was about to strike the ground, it suddenly stopped.

“That’s…!”

Suddenly, someone cried out. At the other end of the crescent moon was a crowned figure.

People then looked over to the sea demon race’s area to see that the crowned elder had disappeared at some point.

After that, they realized that as the old woman was facing Daoist Heavenly Feather, the crowned elder had snuck over to kill Long Chen and the others. But now he was frozen by Daoist Heavenly Feather’s attack.

BOOM!

The giant crescent moon then shattered, fading away like ice fragments in the air along with the crowned elder.

“He was killed…”

Everyone stared in shock, and even Long Chen’s heart was pounding wildly. That crowned elder had given him a sense of immense pressure. Even if he wasn’t as terrifying as this old woman, he was also not an existence Long Chen could fight currently. Using his Heaven Merging cultivation base, he had been trying to launch a sneak attack, only to be killed in one blow by Daoist Heavenly Feather.

After a moment of shock, the Martial Heaven Alliance’s side let out heaven-shaking cheering. A supreme expert had finally appeared to support the Martial Heaven Continent.

No one had expected that the always low-key and amiable Daoist Heavenly Feather was a supreme expert. With her support, they would no longer need to be so afraid of the divine families.

The old man and Qu Jianying, who had summoned the Martial Heaven Virtue Tablet, were also surprised. Daoist Heavenly Feather had actually come out to support Long Chen, even killing the leader of the sea demon race. She stunned all of them.

The sea demons were all horrified. That crowned elder was their demon emperor, but he had actually been killed in one blow. Not even his corpse remained.

“It’s been so long since I fought. I’m not even able to control my power properly. I really have grown old,” sighed Daoist Heavenly Feather.

The old woman’s expression sank, and she harshly clenched her teeth. “Han Zhiqiu, are you trying to become enemies with the divine families? Even if you can control a trace of the Northern Source Sword’s power, you can’t resist us!” Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

“What?!”

“The Northern Source Sword?!”

“One of the Martial Heaven Continent’s five supreme divine items?!”

Every expert trembled, staring in disbelief at the sword in Daoist Heavenly Feather’s hand.

Wasn’t the supreme treasure of the Divine Ice Palace known as the Ice Divine Sword? How did it become the Northern Source Sword of the five supreme divine items?

Far too many shocking things had occurred today, but not one of those things was as shocking as the appearance of the Northern Source Sword.

Even Ye Zhiqiu was startled. She had had no idea that her sword was one of the five supreme divine items.

“I don’t like being enemies with anyone, but if someone tries to bully the weak, I won’t just stand to the side. Please don’t use the divine families to intimidate me. I’ve lived countless years. If the divine families want to play, I don’t mind accompanying you to death.” Daoist Heavenly Feather’s gentle and warm appearance began to change. An icy killing intent began to exude out of her.

At this moment, she was surrounded by whirling Ice Qi that was cracking the space around her. It was as if the world was unable to contain her power.

The current Daoist Heavenly Feather was like a completely different person. Even her words were no longer polite. Instead, they had become icy and domineering.

“You…!” The old woman was shocked.

“Even thousands of years of cultivation was unable to wipe away this part of me. If the divine families want to help me expel this darkness, I would be forever grateful,” snorted Daoist Heavenly Feather.

Domineering. Callous. Murderous. Even Daoist Heavenly Feather’s aura was changing, shocking everyone.

“The Northern Source Sword has not been awakened! It is still unable to threaten the divine families!”

Just at this moment, a pair of hands reached out of the void and pulled it apart. An old man walked out.

“Grandpa!” Ye Liangchen hastily bowed.

The old man nodded to him but didn’t say anything. He looked at Long Chen first and then Daoist Heavenly Feather. He sneered. “Long Chen killed a Sovereign sprout of the divine families, so he must pay with his life. There is nothing else to say.”

“Fuck your bullshit! Zhao Ritian killed so many people in the Star Field Divine World, so us killing him is called retribution. There’s nothing else to say!” cursed Guo Ran.

The old man’s expression immediately sank after he heard that, and he took out a giant bell. When Long Chen saw that bell, his heart pounded wildly. It looked a bit familiar.

“Why does it look so similar to the Eastern Wasteland Bell? Even the patterns are the same. Only its aura is different…”

A majestic aura unfurled from the bell, and it rapidly grew larger. Images of the sun, moon, and stars appeared on top of it.

After that, the sound of a bell resounded through heaven and earth, and its divine might wreaked havoc upon the world.

At this moment, the laws of the Heavenly Daos became visible, appearing as lines in the air. Those lines matched up to the sound of the bell.

“The Eastern Wasteland Bell?!”

A startled cry rang out, shocking countless others. The images and lines on this giant bell were identical to the legendary Eastern Wasteland Bell.

The Eastern Wasteland Bell was the leader of the five supreme divine items. It was said to be the Martial Heaven Continent’s strongest divine item, and it possessed the power to destroy the entire world.

“No, its aura is completely different.” Long Chen was filled with questions as he looked at the bell.

Back then, Long Chen had encountered the Eastern Wasteland Bell in the Immemorial Path. Although it was badly damaged and missing the majority of its body, its aura was filled with a sacred flavor, righteous and pure. Despite its body being broken down, that aura was not missing any pieces.

On the other hand, this giant bell’s aura was vast and majestic, but also sinister, tyrannical, and dark. It made others feel terror, not reverence.

Just at this moment, the bronze fragment in Long Chen’s primal chaos space shuddered, emitting a faint cry.

Long Chen jumped, hastily suppressing it. He couldn’t let it release any fluctuations that the elder would sense.

Long Chen could vaguely tell that the Eastern Wasteland Bell was related to the entire continent’s secrets. Unfortunately, the Eastern Wasteland Bell had vanished and not reappeared ever since back then. If this bronze fragment was exposed, that would probably lead to a calamity.

“It’s just a counterfeit. Its aura is similar but wrong. If you think a fake can suppress me, then you truly are naive,” said Daoist Heavenly Feather coldly.

In her battle state, even her voice became cold, and her aura was growing stronger and stronger. Ever since she grasped the Northern Source Sword, she began to transform into an ice goddess of war.

As her aura was unleashed, the ground began to freeze and shatter. Ice Qi gradually spread, turning this area into a world of ice.

Everyone had no choice but to retreat. Despite being so far away, the Ice Qi still made them feel terrified. They didn’t dare to touch it.

“Big sister Zhiqiu, why didn’t you tell us that your master was so powerful? If you had, we wouldn’t have been shivering in fear,” said Guo Ran. With such a powerful backer, he instantly began to grow arrogant. Even his words became relaxed, unlike before when he didn’t dare to speak in front of a Heaven Merging expert.

Long Chen shook his head. “Please remove the ‘we’ from your statement.”

Gu Yang: “Please remove the ‘we’ from your statement.”

Li Qi: “Please remove the ‘we’ from your statement.”

Song Mingyuan: “Please remove the ‘we’ from your statement.”

Yue Zifeng: “Please remove the ‘we’ from your statement.”

Guo Ran: “...”

The tense atmosphere was instantly fractured. Under Long Chen’s lead and the guys’ disdainful gazes at Guo Ran, it was as if they were refusing to recognize him as one of them, causing Nangong Zuiyue, Beitang Rushuang, and the others to involuntarily chuckle.

They also couldn’t help feeling greater admiration for Long Chen. Even in front of terrifying Heaven Merging experts, he could still joke around. Being able to do that in the face of death was not something many could do.

However, Ye Zhiqiu didn’t smile. She said, “My master taught me through dictation and never displayed any techniques. I had no idea about her true realm. I was once in a bottleneck for three months with a certain technique, and I asked her to display it for me. But she said that her mood wasn’t good, and that as soon as she used her Ice Qi, it would cause her temper to explode and very likely damage our relationship as master and disciple. That’s why I have never seen her display even a single move.”

Everyone came to an understanding. No wonder Daoist Heavenly Feather had suddenly begun to transform from her previous amicable self.

“Hmph, even if it’s a counterfeit, it was created with the Source Qi of the Eastern Wasteland Bell. Considering you haven’t even gained the approval of the Northern Source Sword, it’s enough to handle you,” said Ye Liangchen’s grandfather. He was also the current Ye family head.

The Ye family and the Long family didn’t get along. Meanwhile, the Jiang family was neutral, and the Zhao family had a good relationship with the Ye family. Hence, if the Zhao family was in trouble, the Ye family would naturally step forward.

“Be suppressed!” The Ye family head slammed his hand on the giant bell, sending it smashing toward Daoist Heavenly Feather.

“That will depend on how much skill you have.” Daoist Heavenly Feather coldly swung the Northern Source Sword.

BOOM!

The divine items clashed together, unleashing an explosion of divine light. Endless fragments of spacetime exploded, and ripples containing enough power to destroy worlds spread in every direction. Cracks in the void spread along with them. As a result, everyone turned pale and fled for their lives.
