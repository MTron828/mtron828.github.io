Chapter 4806 Heavens Beyond the Heavens

Upon seeing Long Chen fly into the sky, the Divine Lightning Elder and the others cried out, “Long Chen!”

They didn’t know what had just happened to Long Chen. However, if he flew into the clouds, it would make it much more difficult to protect him.

Within the sky, Long Chen blasted the dark clouds apart. Here, the laws of the Heavenly Daos were condensed in the form of a heavenly screen, and Long Chen forcibly blew a hole in it.

The moment Long Chen did so, he could feel a lot more Heavenly Dao runes swirling here, even several times purer than the Heavenly Dao runes down below.

Fearing that something might happen to Long Chen, the Divine Lightning Elder and the others flew up as well. However, they were stunned by what they saw.

“Heavens beyond the heavens?” exclaimed the High Heaven Elder.

All of them had experienced the process of merging with the Heavenly Daos. However, even they hadn’t dared to break the wall of the heavens; their merger process was a gradual one. If it weren’t for Long Chen, they would have never seen such a thing.

Just as they were shocked, Long Chen didn’t stop. He charged once more and pierced another heavenly wall.

Heavenly Dao runes came flooding out of the opening, each containing a shocking amount of Heavenly Dao energy.

Feeling the energy that was several times greater than that of the level below, the four Elders and Bai Letian were shocked.

“Long Chen, stop! If you enrage the Heavenly Daos, they will send down heavenly punishment. You might be getting some benefits now, but it doesn’t make up for the losses. The karma will definitely be settled in your next tribulation!” shouted the Divine Lightning Elder.

Although they didn’t quite understand the secret behind the layers of heavenly walls, based on their understanding of the Heavenly Daos, they knew the Heavenly Daos had intentionally set up these barriers and would not permit anyone to break these laws.

Now that Long Chen was breaking the walls of the heavens, he could absorb more Heavenly Dao runes. However, if he enraged the Heavenly Daos, heavenly punishment would descend upon him.

Even if he didn’t die, it would definitely invoke terrifying karma, and it would always be settled during the next tribulation, turning it into a sure-death tribulation.

“The heavens provoked me first. You are right... It is best to be cautious and take things slowly. But would that still be me? Why do I cultivate with my life on the line? Is it to be ordinary? The more you are afraid of losing, the easier it is to lose. Who cares about karma? Do the heavens want to settle some karma with me? Fine, it just so happens that I’m also hoping to settle the years of grudge between us!”

Long Chen clenched his teeth. After facing the white-robed Long Chen, Long Chen felt defeated and was enraged, but not toward his heart-devil—rather, toward his own weaknesses.

Despite knowing that his heart-devil had intentionally said stuff to disturb his mental state, Long Chen knew that his heart-devil’s words were correct, so correct that he had no way to retort.

He hated himself for being powerless. Why did he always have to contradict himself? Despite knowing what path was correct, why did he always doubt himself?

In his struggle against his heart-devil, it wasn't his lack of strength that led to his defeat. It was his own internal turmoil, his self-doubt, that held him back. To use his heart-devil’s words, he was incurably foolish, dragging down the cultivation techniques he had learned.

BOOM!

Long Chen tore through the wall of the heavens again. At this moment, the Heavenly Daos raged, and a murderous aura suddenly unfurled, causing the temperature to plummet.

“Long Chen, don’t keep going, or the Heavenly Daos will kill you!” shouted the Divine Lightning Elder.

The will of the Heavenly Daos could not be shaken, not even by Heaven Saints. After all, anyone who cultivated the Heavenly Daos depended on the Heavenly Dao energy to live.

BANG!

Long Chen seemed to have gone insane as he smashed into another wall of the heavens. However, his fist was knocked back this time.

Unfazed by this failure, Long Chen once more charged over, with Evilmoon in his hand.

“Hahaha, yes, this is the Long Chen I know! Who cares about karma? We do what we want!” shouted Evilmoon, exceptionally excited by this turn of events.

Evilmoon’s tip tore through the walls of the heavens. When the ninth wall was torn through, Long Chen found himself within a sea of primal chaos.

“Quick, absorb this primal chaos qi!”

Just then, the Earth Cauldron appeared above Long Chen, and golden light radiated out of it, forming a giant vortex that crazily absorbed this primal chaos qi.

Huo Linger and Lei Linger also emerged, surrounded by flame and lightning runes as they crazily absorbed this Heavenly Dao energy. This Heavenly Dao energy was millions of times greater than what they were absorbing at the start.

Long Chen didn’t know what was going on, but sensing the unbelievably pure Heavenly Dao energy within this area, he stopped thinking and simply immersed himself in it, absorbing this energy as quickly as he could.

The Heavenly Dao runes here were like tiny water droplets, not runes. Once Long Chen absorbed them, he felt like he was swelling with energy. His dragon blood, his stars, his violet blood, and seven-color Supreme Blood instantly grew active, acting like dry riverbeds greedily absorbing rainwater.

All of a sudden, his divine ring appeared, forming a giant whirlpool that absorbed this primal chaos qi, sending it directly into the primal chaos space.

The primal chaos space quivered, and it felt like a new color had been added to it. All the vegetation within it grew excited, and the golden lotus seed in the air fluctuated intensely.

“This is...” Long Chen realized that his reckless actions had accomplished something unbelievable. Even the primal chaos space and Earth Cauldron were joining in.

Long Chen found himself in a state of awe as his body absorbed energy automatically, each cell greedily drinking in the power. Within his starry sea, the violet qi grew denser, his stars shining with newfound brilliance. His dragon blood, violet blood, and Supreme Blood runes surged with rapid growth, propelling his power to unprecedented heights.

Sensing his power climbing rapidly, Long Chen was stunned. He had never expected this recklessness to cause his power to climb so crazily. However, his astonishment was short-lived as the space around him started to fracture, followed by a deafening explosion. The nine heavenly walls shattered, leaving a colossal hole in the sky.

Thrown forcefully from the rupture, Long Chen crashed to the ground. As he surveyed his surroundings upon landing, he couldn't help but gasp in disbelief at what lay before him.
