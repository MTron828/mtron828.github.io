Chapter 3959 Starting From Zero

Long Chen glanced at the imposing figure before him. The man appeared to be in his forties or fifties, towering over Long Chen by a full head.

Despite his stature, he didn’t appear elongated at all because of his solid, thick build. However, his pale and hairless face, as well as his loose skin, made his fatness look more apparent.

From his shoulders down, his body was like that of an upside-down triangle. If he was a muscular man, that would be normal. However, it was extremely odd for someone with such a fat face.

At this moment, this large eunuch and several other smaller eunuchs behind him were looking at Long Chen coldly.

“Long Chen, this place is the palace…” Yu Qingxuan looked apologetic while saying this. Sadly, this was not somewhere else. The rules were even stricter here.

“I understand. There would only be eunuchs in the palace,” said Long Chen. He smiled, but he very much disliked these strange people.

“Stay further back. Maintain a proper distance from the princess.” The eunuch tried to push Long Chen, indicating for him to get away.

However, before his hand reached Long Chen, a powerful force struck him, causing him to grunt and stagger back.

The eunuchs behind him cried out and tried to support him, only to end up being knocked down by him.

“Long Chen!” Yu Qingxuan jumped in shock and hastily grabbed Long Chen.

“I am not someone that just anyone can touch. Next time you try to touch me, I’ll relieve you of your arm.” Long Chen glared at the large eunuch coldly.

“You…!” The eunuch was enraged.

“If you dare to say anything obscene, I’ll take your head off instead. Oh, I have never made empty threats. Do you want to try me?” Long Chen didn’t like trouble, but he wasn’t afraid of it. He didn’t care if they didn’t respect him, but if they were to dare to insult him, he wouldn’t care about their status.

The large eunuch was about to shout curses at Long Chen, but when he met Long Chen’s gaze, it felt like an ancient beast had set its sights on him. In an instant, an intense sensation of death enveloped his heart.

He was also an expert with sharp senses toward danger; thus, he could smell death at this moment.

He was shocked. This was the imperial palace. Who dared to kill people here? However, he couldn't risk his life by uttering a curse or expressing his anger. As a result, his plump figure simply jiggled with rage, and his fists creaked from how hard he clenched them.

“You fool, this is the imperial palace! Do you not want your life any longer?!” demanded Yu Qingxuan.

“I refuse to believe that my father-in-law would kill me.” Long Chen shrugged indifferently.

Yu Qingxuan forgot her anger and blushed when Long Chen said this. She then rebuked him. “How is your face so thick? You haven’t passed the trials yet!”

Long Chen chortled, “I won’t fail at what I want to do. Trust me.”

“Did you get the tablet? I asked my mom to give it to you. With it, you can directly register for the army. With your power, passing the trial will be very easy. After that…”

“Ah… that tablet? I didn’t get it.” Long Chen’s heart warmed when he learned that the tablet came from Yu Qingxuan.

“You didn’t get it?” Yu Qingxuan was surprised.

Long Chen explained what had happened in the hall. Hearing this, Yu Qingxuan grew more and more worried. “Without that tablet, it will be more complicated for you to fulfill the prerequisites. It’ll take much longer!”

“Foolish girl, isn’t that a good thing? For you, I can always spend some time. I already said that for you, I’m not afraid of anything,” said Long Chen with a smile.

“Long Chen, why do you treat me so well?” asked Yu Qingxuan. She knew just how busy Long Chen was. He had many important matters to deal with.nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

It was precisely because she knew this that she didn’t want Long Chen to waste so much time and energy on her. Thus, she did her best to give him a head start.

“Because I like you!” said Long Chen softly.

“Long Chen, I saw many things in big sister Meng Qi’s eyes. Also, all your brothers looked shocked when they saw me. I’m very curious. Long Chen, are you hiding something from me?” Yu Qingxuan looked at Long Chen.

Long Chen shook his head. “I will never hide anything from you. The only reason I haven’t told you is because the time hasn’t come yet. When the time comes, I will tell you everything.”

The reason Long Chen hadn’t told Yu Qingxuan about her previous reincarnation was because he didn’t want her to feel burdened. He didn't want their relationship to be based on the ties of her past life but rather on genuine connection. He also desired to pursue her openly, giving her the joy and fortune that a woman like her deserved.

After all, the pain of reincarnating a thousand times was unimaginable. Long Chen felt that this was the only way to repay her, even if only the slightest bit.

Hearing this, Yu Qingxuan smiled sweetly, and the worry on her brows vanished. “Without that tablet, you can only start from the lowest status and walk your way up step by step. I’m very worried about you… my dear. Your temper will cause you to run into a great deal of trouble!”

Long Chen’s heart melted to hear Yu Qingxuan calling him dear. That was the most intimate thing that she had ever called him.

“Hahaha, I could go from a tiny person in the mortal world who was always bullied to where I am now. That wasn’t because of luck!” Long Chen laughed. With just this one word from Yu Qingxuan, he was overflowing with confidence.

“Princess, your time for receiving visitors is up. You should go back and cultivate,” reminded the large eunuch.

“So fast?” Yu Qingxuan frowned. She had only said a few words to Long Chen.

“Qingxuan, you can go. No need to worry about me. I’ve spent my entire time in the immortal world fighting and killing, so it’s perfect for me to calm my heart and cultivate my character in the Vermilion Bird Empire. With this chance, I can raise my character and temperament to become the most outstanding son-in-law for the Vermilion Bird Empire. I will become someone possessing integrity and talent, wisdom and bravery,” said Long Chen.

Yu Qingxuan nodded. She still had many things to say to Long Chen, but the Vermilion Bird Empire had many rules that she had to abide by. With a heavy heart, she bade her farewell and departed, a tinge of sadness evident in her expression.

The large eunuch glared at Long Chen before leaving along with her.

As for the eunuch guiding Long Chen’s way, he brought Long Chen out of the palace. Once Long Chen was out, he went to get a status plate for himself. That way, he would become an ordinary member of the Vermilion Bird Empire.

Once he obtained the status plate, he went to the Huayun Trading Company. However, he had just passed through their gate when several figures in the distance coldly glanced at Long Chen and vanished.

“The Bloodkill Hall still refuses to give up? Enpuda, are you going to personally come this time?”

Once they were gone, Long Chen turned back and looked at where they had vanished. A sinister smile then appeared on his face.
