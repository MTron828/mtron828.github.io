Chapter 2097 Caught

Zhao Wuji immediately targeted Long Chen as soon as he arrived. His provocation was so obvious that even Ye Zhiqiu was enraged. Icy light began to shine in her eyes.

Long Chen grabbed Ye Zhiqiu and shook his head. Indifferently looking at Zhao Wuji, he said, “Even after being slapped, you haven’t learned your lesson. Were you a pig in your last life?”

Clapping sounds rang out clearly in the distance as Nangong Zuiyue and Beitang Rushuang appeared, walking over. The one clapping was Beitang Rushuang.

Zhao Wuji’s expression sank. An everlasting family wasn’t an existence he could provoke.

“Long Chen, just wait. Once the gathering is over, it will be time for our battle to the death,” sneered Zhao Wuji.

Long Chen tilted his head at Zhao Wuji, curiously asking, “You’ve been constantly provoking me without letting up. Is that intentional?”

His question was a bit strange, but he was confident that Zhao Wuji would understand. A brief flash of concealed shock appeared in Zhao Wuji’s eyes, which was caught by Long Chen.

“Hmph, just enjoy your final moments,” sneered Zhao Wuji. He then turned away and found a seat for himself.

Long Chen looked at Zhao Wuji’s back and narrowed his eyes, pondering.

“What is it? If you’re not confident in beating him, you can refuse to fight. With your big sister here, no one will dare to touch you.” Beitang Rushuang walked over, smiling.

Long Chen tightly held Ye Zhiqiu’s hand, saying, “Thank you for your kindness, big sister. But as you can see, I already have a wife, so again, I cannot-”

“Stop, stop right there! I’m already sick of hearing you say that. If you say it again, I’ll choke you,” said Beitang Rushuang fiercely.

“Hehe, thank you, but I’m not the kind of person to run from a fight,” said Long Chen. It seemed that his expression had made her think that he was afraid.

More and more experts arrived as they talked. There were even a few more than during the auction.

Even now, Long Chen didn’t spot anyone from the Ximen everlasting family. Only the top genius of the Ximen family was missing from the four everlasting families. He didn’t know why.

“The Ximen family is at odds with the Dongfang family. It’s normal for them to not give the Dongfang family some face,” explained Beitang Rushuang upon seeing his questioning expression. “It’s not just the Ximen family. There are quite a few other ancient powers that haven’t come. Either they’re quarreling or their disciples haven’t reached the necessary height to come here.”

A few minutes later, the Pill Fairy arrived. She glanced at Long Chen for a moment but didn’t say anything.

Then Kun Pengzi, Xie Tianzi, Huang Feiyan, and Shi Lingfeng arrived one after another. Long Chen also saw the mysterious Dong Mingyu.

Dong Mingyu still had a large cloak covering her small body. It seemed that ever since arriving, she hadn’t said anything. Furthermore, wherever she sat would definitely be empty of anyone else. No one wanted to sit next to an assassin or have their backs toward her. That would make them feel like they could lose their life at any moment.

Zi Yan also arrived. She calmly sat at the seat next to Long Chen and smiled naturally at him. She didn’t join his exact seat because there were already too many people sitting with him.

When noon struck, everyone was already present. A white-robed Dongfang Yuyang appeared in front of everyone. He gave off a very relaxing feeling.

“Thank you everyone for giving me the honor of attending the Dongfang family’s gathering of past and present heroes. This gathering is not a martial competition, nor is it a chance to fight for fame or profit. This gathering is purely for us to find a way to coexist in peace and unite against our enemies. We all know that this great era is not just ours. The worlds outside the Martial Heaven Continent who are our enemies are also in their great era. We are getting stronger, and so are they. At this time, we cannot be fighting amongst ourselves. That will only reduce the Martial Heaven Continent’s power. We must unite against our common enemies. If we cannot set aside our personal enmities, how will the Martial Heaven Alliance resist the coming of the dark era? Our own deaths won’t even be the worst part. What about our families? What about all the lives of the continent? At that time, we would become the sinners of the continent, or more likely, there will no longer be any history of the continent to record us as sinners,” said Dongfang Yuyang gravely.

Everyone felt a sense of pressure, but no one claimed that he was wrong. He was absolutely right. After every great era had come a dark era. If the continent did not prepare itself, it would pay a miserable price.

“Temporarily setting aside our enmities and working together is acceptable, but there is one person that must die.” Xie Tianzi was the first to open his mouth.

His eyes were strangely demonic. Although he didn’t look directly at Long Chen, his meaning was clear.

“He is correct. If this person is still alive, there is no way that we can work together,” said Kun Pengzi. His voice was calm without the slightest emotion. It merely contained absolute certainty.

Huang Feiyan sneered and looked at Long Chen. She saw that his expression didn’t even twitch. On the other hand, Ye Lingshan and Ye Zhiqiu were infuriated.

“An arrogant person who doesn’t know how high the heavens are and constantly causes trouble shouldn’t exist in this world. The sooner he’s killed, the better. Why make things hard on everyone?” added Shi Lingfeng.

Quite a few experts looked at Long Chen with eyes full of hostility. It seemed they all intensely disliked him.

“Everyone, listen to me. This is directly contrary to the goal of this gathering-” said Dongfang Yuyang hastily.

Zhao Wuji suddenly stood up. “Brother Dongfang, we respect you as a person and respect the contributions of the Dongfang family to the Martial Heaven Continent, but this is a matter of principles. We cannot compromise here! Long Chen’s character is garbage, and he has made enemies with everyone. No one wants to work together with him. But more importantly, his origins are extremely unclear! How was it that an ordinary person arrived at this level? He relied entirely on slaughter to reach his current height! That is clearly the power of a Heaven-Seizer from the legends!”

Everyone’s hearts shook. Heaven-Seizers were taboo existences. They relied entirely on slaughter to live. They took away other people’s lives, absorbing their Heavenly Dao energy, their karmic luck, and even a portion of their cultivation base. They were extremely horrifying existences.

Zhao Wuji looked at Long Chen mockingly, saying, “Although you concealed yourself well, the origins of your cultivation technique are completely unclear. No one recognizes it! To continue skyrocketing with no foundation makes no sense at all. Most importantly, even your Dragonblood Legion is somehow rising with you! How can you possibly explain such a thing?”

“You...!” Ye Lingshan stood, shuddering from rage. Just how many years ago had it been since this matter had been brought up and put to rest? Now he was bringing it up again just to target Long Chen.

Long Chen pulled Ye Lingshan back down. Looking at Zhao Wuji, he extended a hand graciously. “Go on, continue your show.”

“My show? Haha, how laughable! There are so many questionable points about you! Who would be willing to work with you? Just now, I only made two points, but you already can’t sit still? Then here’s a third point! Do you think your collusion with the original devil race was kept perfectly concealed? You’re wrong!”

Zhao Wuji waved his hand, and a dozen bodies appeared. Those people were all unconscious, but upon seeing them, Long Chen’s heart pounded although his expression didn’t twitch.

These people were disciples of the original devil race. Long Chen was very familiar with their energy fluctuations, but he couldn’t react.

Everyone was startled. They looked from these original devil disciples to Long Chen.

“Long Chen, now that you’re caught red-handed, do you have anything to say?” Zhao Wuji sneered at Long Chen, looking like he had already won.

“Is your head devoid of a brain? Does randomly throwing out a few people mean someone is caught red-handed? Fine, well I see that based on our height, I’m your dad. How’s that?” said Long Chen indifferently.

Although he was acting calm, he was actually anxious inside. Just how had these disciples of the original devil race ended up in this bastard’s hands? Long Chen had long since had the original devil race’s disciples leave the continent.

“You...!” Zhao Wuji was at a loss for a moment, and then he suddenly grabbed one of those disciples, clapping the back of that disciple’s head, causing him to wake. Forcibly backing his words with his Spiritual Strength, he shouted, “Speak, who is he!?”

That disciple looked around. He suddenly cursed at Zhao Wuji, but they weren’t human curses, so no one understood what he was saying.

Zhao Wuji punched the disciple’s chest, causing him to cough up a mouthful of blood. “I asked you if you know this person! Talk in the language of the Martial Heaven Continent!” VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

The disciple looked at Long Chen. He sneered, “He’s your dad, hahaha...!”

“Courting death!”

Zhao Wuji directly tore off one of the disciple’s arms and grabbed his neck.

Long Chen was enraged inside. He wouldn’t allow a disciple of the original devil race to be killed in front of him. He was about to make a move when his heart turned cold. That disciple opened his mouth and shouted a name.

“Mixihaweiya!”
