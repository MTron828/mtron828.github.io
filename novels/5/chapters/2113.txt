Chapter 2103 This is Your So-Called Foundation?

“That mist...”

People stared in disbelief at that mist. The moment it appeared, ripples appeared in the space around Long Chen. It was like space was currently freezing. Cracks were appearing everywhere.

“This is the powder of Spatial Stone. It can solidify space, and if any intense fluctuations strike it during that time, it can cause that space to shatter. Everything within that space will be destroyed,” said someone.

People couldn’t help sucking in a cold gasp of air. Zhao Wuji really had money. He was even able to obtain a treasure like Spatial Stone. They also knew that the only reason he had taken it out was because he had been forced to. He was using this powder to restrict Long Chen, and then have his tens of thousands of puppets detonate that space.

“It seems that you’re already out of tricks.” Long Chen’s mouth curled into a cold smile. Zhao Wuji was definitely brainless. Did he not realize that to freeze space, the space had to be still?

Like freezing water, it was much more difficult to freeze running water than water that was still.

Those puppets had taken out enough of the powder to freeze the space during ordinary times, but Zhao Wuji had forgotten one thing in his panic and rage. When Long Chen had destroyed his first eight puppets, he had used the Inverse Dao Water Spirit Flame. Its fluctuations were still present within the air.

These fluctuations could be controlled by Long Chen, and they could be considered Long Chen’s domain. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

As for Zhao Wuji, if he wanted to freeze this domain, it would take several times longer than usual.

Flames burst out of Evilmoon, and Long Chen unleashed a thrust at the puppets charging toward him, sending out a giant saber-image. That giant saber-image was a zone of death for these puppets.

The puppets exploded instantly upon contact. As they exploded, the surrounding space tore and cracked. The space that Zhao Wuji had sealed was twisting, exploding, and distorting. It was like a star imploding from the inside.

BOOM!

That space fully collapsed, forming a giant black hole that pulled in everything within the surroundings. The sand of the desert was sucked away rapidly.

“What terrifying spatial energy. He actually broke the spatial rampart. This attack was probably on the same level as the God Extermination Cannon’s attack.”

“It was a good technique, but it’s too bad his head wasn’t good enough.” While everyone was stunned by this move, some scoffed.

Just as Zhao Wuji thought that Long Chen had been blown to bits, Evilmoon slashed at his neck, coming from a strange angle.

Zhao Wuji was caught completely off guard. He couldn’t understand how Long Chen had escaped from his sealed space. All he could do was raise his hand to block Long Chen’s saber.

Silver sparks flew. Evilmoon was actually unable to pierce his armor.

Long Chen snorted and put Evilmoon away. He grabbed Zhao Wuji’s arm, and using his other hand, he pulled on the scales covering Zhao Wuji’s arm.

Blood splashed. Zhao Wuji let out a screech as Long Chen actually ripped a chunk of his scales off of his arm.

Unexpectedly, those scales brought away his flesh and blood. They were actually growing on top of his body.

“It seems that Zhao Wuji has turned himself into something not human. He has fully merged his armor with his body. No wonder it’s so nimble.”

“He’s quite ruthless. Fusing armor with the physical body and getting it to move as he wishes would definitely cause inhuman pain.”

People felt a chill upon seeing this sight. No wonder the Mechanism Sect’s people were so vicious. They were also vicious to themselves.

“Die!”

Zhao Wuji howled. Having his scales ripped off made every part of him burn with pain. In order to merge with his armor, he had essentially sacrificed his flesh and soul to it. That had been the only way to make his armor as nimble as his own body. Because of it, he could also activate his mechanisms at will.

The pain of having his armor being torn off was like having his fingernails plucked off. He saw stars from the pain.

The wings behind Zhao Wuji fell off, transforming into feathers that shot at Long Chen. The wings actually had their own independent attack.

Those feathers were incredibly sharp, and considering how short the distance between them was, Long Chen was instantly struck. The feathers pierced his armor, immediately making him bleed.

Ye Lingshan jumped at the sight of Long Chen looking like a hedgehog, but covered in feathers instead of quills. Even his armor was unable to block the feathers.

“Many thanks.” Despite being struck, Long Chen smiled. Those feathers vanished from his body. They had actually been taken away by him as well.

“Long Chen’s scales are extremely strong. If it was anyone else, they’d have been torn to shreds,” said someone.

Both of them had scales covering their bodies. Zhao Wuji was extremely unlucky to face an enemy who countered all his techniques.

Long Chen still had a hold on Zhao Wuji’s arm. His other hand was like a hook, tearing into the place where he had torn Zhao Wuji’s scales off.

“AHH!”

Blood splashed as Zhao Wuji let out a mournful wail. Long Chen had now ripped out a chunk of his flesh from the opening in his armor. That sight was hair-raising.

Zhao Wuji cried crazily as he activated all the mechanisms of his armor, trying to repel Long Chen.

Only one arm was free, and his blade was too long to be used at such short range. It had actually become a liability. The attacks of the mechanisms though were endured by Long Chen’s dragon scales as he continued clawing away at Zhao Wuji’s flesh.

Finally, a cracking sound rang out as Zhao Wuji’s arm went flying.

“Zhao Wuji severed his own arm to get away!” exclaimed someone. As that person said, Zhao Wuji was now flying back, having escaped Long Chen’s grasp.

“Keep dreaming.” Long Chen sneered, and at this moment, people suddenly found that a net had appeared beneath Long Chen’s feet.

The other end of the net was wrapped around Zhao Wuji’s feet. No one had noticed this before, but now that Zhao Wuji was fleeing, they noticed it since Zhao Wuji was unable to create any distance between himself and Long Chen.

“That’s the silk net of the Heavenly Horned Dragon Silkworm!” These experts instantly recognized this net to be one of the nets that Zhao Wuji had tried to use to bind Long Chen.

“Weren’t those nets incinerated by the Inverse Dao Water Spirit Flame?”

“No, it is the net that he pierced through at the beginning. The others were incinerated by the Inverse Dao Water Spirit Flame, when he didn’t have time to gather them,” deduced someone else.

Long Chen pulled with his foot, and Zhao Wuji came flying back to him.

Long Chen gave him a punch straight to the face. With a pained grunt, Zhao Wuji almost instinctively swung his blades at Long Chen.

Regretfully, Long Chen tugged on the net below, causing Zhao Wuji to fall back and making his attack miss.

As Zhao Wuji lost his balance, Long Chen grabbed his tail. Evilmoon reappeared in his hand, and he swung it right at the base of Zhao Wuji’s tail. There was the slightest chink in his scaled armor there, and so Long Chen sliced off his tail.

With his tail cut off, Zhao Wuji’s entire body shuddered. That tail was connected to his coccyx. To be able to make his tail move, his nerves extended into it. This cut made Zhao Wuji’s gaze turn black, and he almost fainted.

Seeing Zhao Wuji shuddering from pain, the other experts shuddered sympathetically as well as they imagined what that must have felt like.

“A spider caught in its own web.”

Seeing Zhao Wuji being trapped by his own silk web, this phrase appeared in many people’s heads. Long Chen didn’t give Zhao Wuji any chance to escape.

The two of them began a fight with fists and feet. Long Chen had no choice but to put away Evilmoon as he was unable to pierce Zhao Wuji’s scales. Grabbing Zhao Wuji’s shoulder, he once more ripped off a chunk of scales.

“Is Long Chen trying to strip Zhao Wuji?”

As soon as the first chunk of scales had been torn off, the overall power of Zhao Wuji’s armor had dropped. Then his tail and arm were torn off too, making his armor incomplete. It was no longer as strong as it had been at the start.

“This is your so-called foundation? I’m not seeing anything worth seeing. Or are you just so low-key that you keep your foundation hidden? Fine then, I’ll just search for it bit by bit until I find It.”

With each claw from Long Chen, another chunk of Zhao Wuji’s body came flying off. He was quickly covered in blood. It was an especially ghastly sight.

“Brother Long, why don’t we stop things here? You’ve already won. Forgiveness brings forgiveness. After all, we still have to work together to fight the dark era.” Finally, Dongfang Yuyang walked up.

“No one comes over! Only one of us two is getting out alive today. Whoever comes over will become my enemy!” shouted Long Chen. Zhao Wuji had repeatedly gone against him, even causing the deaths of the original devil race’s disciples right in front of him. Long Chen had to kill him.

He needed to get vengeance for those disciples. But killing Zhao Wuji directly would be letting him off too easily. Long Chen needed him to die in endless pain to make up for his sins.

Suddenly, a large figure charged over, disregarding his warning.

“Long Chen, who do you think you are? Who cares if they become your enemy?”
