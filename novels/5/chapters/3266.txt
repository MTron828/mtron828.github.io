Chapter 3255 Once More Encountering a Ghost Ship

“What a big ship! But why is it so worn down?” exclaimed Bai Xiaole when he saw the ship.

To the side of their flying boat was an incomparably enormous ship in the distance. From so far away, they could see that its mast was high in the heavens, and there was a sail on it as well.

This ship was incredibly worn down as if it had been abandoned for a long time. The mast was rotting, and the sail was ripped. An aura of decay came from it. They had no idea just how many years it had existed for.

At the same time as they spotted it, they noticed that the sea demons that were drawn toward them had vanished. The devil sea instantly became deathly calm. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

“There are Ghost Ships in the immortal world?”

Long Chen stared at that ancient giant ship, feeling stunned. He hadn’t expected to see it in the immortal world.

“Ghost Ship?”

Startled cries rang out. Bai Xiaole quivered. “Legend is that those who encounter Ghost Ships will have terrible things happening to them. Are we going to die here?”

“Don’t jinx us.”

Bai Shishi hit him on the head to make him stay quiet. However, even her heart quivered.

She had also heard of Ghost Ships. It was said that those who saw them encountered misfortune and rarely had good endings. The legend was that the Ghost Ships were reapers of lives. It was unknown if these rumors were true or not.

The Ghost Ship slowly moved across the calm sea, and a strange sound came from it. It was like the wind was blowing its rotten mast.

However, in the devil sea, there was no wind. This sound made their hair stand on end.

As the giant ship got closer, the originally clear sky became covered in a layer of haze. The world darkened.

“Is something terrifying coming out? Is it going to swallow us whole?” Bai Xiaole’s voice quivered. He looked around, afraid of something suddenly jumping out.

“I already told you not to spout nonsense!” Bai Shishi wanted to hit Bai Xiaole. She was also afraid, and he just had to say something like that. She subconsciously got closer to Long Chen.

The strange sound coming toward them was truly just like a wind blowing across a mast. The smell of decay then filled the air. For this sound to ring out within the darkness was like hearing a ghost wailing.

Long Chen suddenly roared. Everyone was already tense, and this roar made them all jump.

“Hahaha!” Seeing their wretched appearance, Long Chen laughed.

Bai Shishi clenched her teeth and hit Long Chen. “What is wrong with you? How can you be in the mood to scare people at this time?”

“Hehe, don’t get mad. It’s just a joke to strengthen people’s guts,” said Long Chen. His appearance made Bai Shishi want to bite him. “Don’t be so nervous. This isn’t my first time encountering a Ghost Ship. Xiaole, have the shark bring us over to it.”

“We’re going toward it?!”

Goosebumps rose on everyone. Long Chen wanted to get closer to this terrifying thing?

“Boss, the shark is too scared to move,” said Bai Xiaole, his voice quivering.

“Alright, you can leave it here. We’ll bring the flying boat over. You can stay here if you want,” said Long Chen.

“No, I’d be more scared by myself! We can go together!” Bai Xiaole had been seen through. He then thickened his face and ordered the shark to bring them over.

“Long Chen, have you really encountered a Ghost Ship before?” asked Bai Shishi.

“That was in the mortal world. When I set foot on it, I saw secrets that were not recorded in history. Now that I’m encountering one again, perhaps this is a kind of fate. I can’t let it slip past me,” said Long Chen solemnly.

Ghost Ships passed through the past and present, and they contained unimaginable karma. Naturally, someone whose life wasn’t tough enough would encounter misfortune if they saw one.

However, Long Chen wasn’t afraid of this. He already had terrible bad luck, so he wasn’t afraid of more.

When they got closer, they found that it was even bigger than expected. Furthermore, it seemed that the laws of the very world had changed.

“Long Chen, we should be careful. Don’t mess around. This thing is absolutely terrifying,” said Bai Shishi, her face pale.

She wasn’t the only one afraid. Bai Xiaole was shaking, and even Qin Feng and Qi Yu had goosebumps. This Ghost Ship was extremely sinister. They didn’t have a good feeling about getting closer to it.

“You can wait for me here. I’m just going to take a look and I’ll be right back.” Long Chen started climbing up the Ghost Ship.

Seeing that Long Chen was climbing up, everyone felt a chill. As soon as Long Chen started, Qin Feng and Qi Yu followed. Xu Zixiong then clenched his teeth and followed behind the two of them.

Only a brother and sister were left on the flying boat. Bai Xiaole was shaking uncontrollably. “You look after the flying boat. I’m going to go with boss.”

If Bai Xiaole left, then Bai Shishi would be the only one remaining. Even with all her power, in front of this legendary Ghost Ship, she still felt terrified.

“Let’s go together.”

Seeing Bai Xiaole going, she didn’t dare to stay here alone, so she followed him up. In any case, the shark was under Bai Xiaole’s control and wouldn’t run.

A line of people climbed up a rusty chain. Long Chen then looked back at them. “Be careful. Don’t let the rust pierce your skin. If that happens, you’ll instantly turn into a withered skeleton.

The chains were gigantic, so Long Chen and the others were like ants climbing on top of it. As the chains were rusty, some of those flakes of rust were very sharp. Strange fluctuations came from that rust.

A Ghost Ship that passed through the past and future was very strange. The rust very likely contained the power of time. Once wounded by it, the power of time might turn someone to dust in an instant.

Everyone carefully climbed up silently. All they heard was the creaking sound of the ship, and it felt like their nerves would explode. If anyone dared to let out a roar at this time, it would definitely scare them to death.

They quickly climbed up. Once they were at the top, Long Chen indicated for them to be quiet and wait a moment. He carefully stretched his head up to take a look at the situation on top of the ship.

Even with Long Chen’s guts, he felt a chill. He saw a bunch of decaying battle armor lying on the ground, and the bodies had long since been turned into withered corpses.

Those corpses looked as if they could have belonged to the human race, but they were strangely large. Their arms also reached past their knees. They didn’t seem to be human.

They were already dead, and yet these corpses remained intact. Just looking at them, Long Chen felt a piercing pain in his soul.

This was the might of experts. Even when dead, their will wasn’t erased. They didn’t permit others to look at them. If these lifeforms were alive, they would definitely be absolutely terrifying.

Qin Feng and the others slowly looked over as well. They saw tens of thousands of terrifying corpses.

Just as they were staring at the corpses, one of those corpses slowly turned its head toward Long Chen and the others.

Long Chen instantly had a bad feeling and covered Bai Shishi’s mouth. Her scream was covered up.

Just then, the corpses began to move. Qin Feng and the others were horrified.
