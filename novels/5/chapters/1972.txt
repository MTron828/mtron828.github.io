Chapter 1962: 1962

Long Chen pulled but actually didn’t manage to tear her clothes . That surprised him . Even armor made out of divine items wasn’t able to block him like this .

Long Chen couldn’t help being further enraged . “Alright, so you actually prepared some moves as well!”

“You dare to blaspheme me? Die!”

Leng Yueyan’s beautiful face turned ice-cold . Suddenly, a divine mark lit up on her forehead, and her divine power erupted like a volcano . As light bloomed from her robes, Long Chen felt an immense force try to blow him back .

The chains binding Leng Yueyan blew apart, and Long Chen coughed up a mouthful of blood .

“Fuck, what about when you blasphemed me?!” Victory or defeat would be decided here . If he couldn’t win here, he would lose any further chance . With a roar, he wrapped his legs around her waist and locked his arms around her neck, refusing to let go .

Light erupted from every part of Leng Yueyan, and a terrifying light in particular came from her eyes . An invisible aura unfurled .

However, just as Leng Yueyan was about to unleash her divine power, the cave shook intensely . Runes appeared along the walls, and a dragon roar could be heard .

“The might of an evil dragon and the energy of the Corrupt God?!”

Leng Yueyan’s expression changed slightly . The entire cave shook as countless runes appeared, suppressing her power .

As for Long Chen, he was holding onto her tightly . The two of them rolled on the ground . Suddenly, Leng Yueyan opened her mouth, and a ray of light shot out .

In that instant, all of Long Chen’s hair stood on end . A sensation of death enveloped him . He instinctively turned his head .

That ray of light shot right past his head, cutting through the cave and piercing the clouds . The entire world shook .

“Fuck, you want to kill me?!” raged Long Chen . Seeing Leng Yueyan open her mouth again, he clamped a hand over her mouth . His divine ring materialized, his Five Star Battle Armor activated, and even dragon scales appeared on his body .

BOOM!

The world shook . Long Chen was truly angry now . Last time, he hadn’t even used any big moves, but now Leng Yueyan wanted to kill him .

“Those who blaspheme me spend an eternity in Purgatory . They are skinned, their souls burned, never reincarnating...” Leng Yueyan’s eyes blazed with light, and some faint runes appeared . She began to chant something .

Long Chen suddenly felt his body weaken as though his life energy faded away . It was some kind of power that surpassed the Heavenly Daos, like an irresistible curse . Long Chen felt like he had dropped into an iceberg .

“It’s death energy!”

Evilmoon suddenly let out a shout, actually flying out of Long Chen’s spiritual space to attack Leng Yueyan’s head .

BOOM!

Evilmoon and Long Chen were both sent flying . Leng Yueyan’s gaze was icy . Killing intent surged within her, and she suddenly appeared in front of Long Chen, grabbing his neck . “The end of life, the peak of death, using my name as Nethergod, I cast you to the Purgatory! Suffer the eight torments...”

Long Chen felt himself grow weaker and weaker . It was like Leng Yueyan was a god of death, stripping him of his life .

“Scram!” Suddenly, a burst of energy came from the primal chaos space as though it had been provoked . A burst of energy erupted out of Long Chen .

Leng Yueyan’s expression changed, and she was sent flying by that burst of energy . She crashed into the wall, causing the cave to shake . ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

Long Chen pounced on her once more . It was unknown where he got the energy, but this time, when he grabbed her dress, he managed to tear it off, revealing her body .

Once her dress was torn, it actually transformed into runes that dissipated into the air . Her clothes had actually been condensed of some law .

Long Chen grabbed the stunned Leng Yueyan and threw her to the ground . She tried to resist, but she suddenly found that there was some terrifying divine power coming from Long Chen that suppressed her .

“If you dare to blaspheme me-!”

“Fuck your blaspheme, didn’t you say that you’re the only one allowed to subdue others? Today, I’ll be the one subduing you!” Long Chen roared . Leng Yueyan struggled intensely . Divine runes appeared in her eyes, but they would always crumble as soon as they appeared .

“You will regret this!” shouted Leng Yueyan .

“I’ve never done anything that I regret!” Long Chen ignored her threats . He would return all the pain that she had given him .

After two hours, Long Chen was still working hard when he suddenly sensed someone else walk in . That person was the red-robed Leng Yueyan .

Leng Yueyan held her bone sword in her right hand and an ancient formation disc in her left . There was a small pillar on the formation disc . It was actually the pillar that she had cut off from the Corrupt God’s altar, but much smaller .

When she walked in, she gasped . The formation disc fell from her hand, and she covered her mouth, filled with disbelief .

Long Chen also became dumbfounded . He glanced from the shocked Leng Yueyan to the other Leng Yueyan who looked like she wanted to kill him .

Long Chen hastily jumped away, rapidly putting on his clothes . He looked at the Leng Yueyan that had just walked in . “Is she your twin or something...?”

Long Chen’s voice shuddered, and he felt a chill . It seemed he had just done something terrible . If it really was her sister, would Leng Yueyan immediately kill him?

However, the two of them were truly alike . Even each of their eyebrows was identical .

The other Leng Yueyan was filled with furious killing intent . She waved her hand, and runes condensed into her original dress .

“Ah, about that... My sincerest apologies...” Long Chen awkwardly apologized to the Leng Yueyan in the imperial dress .

“Shut up! You, a mortal, dared to blaspheme me? I will make sure you suffer eternally within Purgatory!” shouted that Leng Yueyan .

Suddenly, Leng Yueyan began to laugh delightedly . She was laughing so hard that she was shaking .

Long Chen retreated slightly, holding Evilmoon and secretly storing up energy . Leng Yueyan was someone who could become hostile at the drop of a hat . He had to defend against her suddenly attacking him . Even now, he didn’t know what was going on .

“You betrayed me . ” The Leng Yueyan in the dress coldly looked at the other Leng Yueyan .

“No, I didn’t betray you . You are the one who wants to destroy me . I’m just resisting . My birth, my life was all planned by you . Ever since the death of my sister Nianrou, I knew that my parents, my sister, they were all part of the fate that you arranged . You want me to hate this world, but to tell the truth, the only thing I hate is you . You used the death of my sister Nianrou to awaken my killing intent, and then made me brush against death several times . But it was always you . Although I don’t know why you did this, you’ve failed... I am not your chess piece, I am not your tool . I am someone with blood, flesh, and soul . I have someone I love . However, your luck is very good . My man actually used you . How does it taste?” Leng Yueyan smiled like a little devil .

“Shut up!” The other Leng Yueyan glared at her, her whole body shuddering with killing intent .

“Ah, I forgot, my man was just broken in and doesn’t have much experience . It seems he didn’t do a good job . How about you let him gain some more experience before coming to find you again?” laughed Leng Yueyan .

The other Leng Yueyan suddenly smashed her palm forward, while Leng Yueyan slashed her bone sword out .

The sharp bone sword cleanly sliced through her palm . Blood slowly dripped down .

However, when the blood dripped into the ground, it transformed into divine runes, which then merged back into heaven and earth . A faint divine pressure caused space to rumble .

“This is... the blood of a god?!” Long Chen’s expression suddenly changed . Legend was that the blood of gods could not exist in this mortal world .

“I remember now! You’re...!” Long Chen suddenly recalled that when he had undergone his tribulation in the Xuantian Dao Sect’s Devil Abyss, he had once seen someone who looked identical to Leng Yueyan .

“You shut up!” that Leng Yueyan glared at Long Chen with immense hatred . She didn’t even want to hear his voice .

“Long Chen, look at how angry this big sister is . Shouldn’t you apologize to her?” Leng Yueyan looked at Long Chen and smiled warmly .

“Ah, big sister, I’m truly sorry . I mistook you for someone else . I know that a simple apology cannot appease your anger, so... how about this? You can subdue me once just like she did, and I promise not to resist!” Long Chen raised a hand as he swore .

“Fuck off!” The Leng Yueyan wearing a dress looked like flames were about to erupt from her eyes .

Long Chen could only shrug, not daring to say anything . Today had been too strange, and he still didn’t know who this other Leng Yueyan was, or what her connection was to the Leng Yueyan that he knew .
