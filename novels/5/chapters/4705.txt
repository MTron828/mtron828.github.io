Chapter 4694 Blood Sacrifice Saint Weapon

Following Long Chen’s shout, countless blood-colored chains shot out, each chain imbued with immense Blood Qi.

Wu Hun’s expression completely changed at the sight of those chains. With a flash, he vanished, only to be forcefully repelled by a resilient chain.

“These chains are a manifestation of my dragon blood. Though I may not be a pure dragon, my essence blood still holds the power to subdue a treacherous half-breed of the Three-Headed Heaven Devouring Beast race!” shouted Long Chen.

The chains rapidly tightened, giving Wu Hun no time to reply.

When the chains wrapped around Wu Hun, dragon scale marks appeared on top of them, and they became red-hot like heated metal digging into Wu Hun’s flesh.

“AH!”

Wu Hun screamed in pain, his former arrogance replaced by sheer terror.

The Three-Headed Heaven Devouring Beast’s bloodline was ancient and noble, and their divine abilities were ephemeral and mysterious. As a result, Wu Hun had never encountered a worthy adversary, let alone someone who could push him to the brink of death.

On the other hand, Long Chen’s blood came from the mysterious dragon expert, and he believed that his blood would not be inferior to that of anyone else.

If ordinary divine abilities couldn’t kill Wu Hun, then Long Chen would directly compete with him in terms of bloodline. It was a forceful battle of bloodline superiority, without any kind of technique to speak of.

“His aura is starting to drop!”

Seeing Wu Hun in this state, Guo Ran and the others breathed a sigh of relief. Previously, even after Yue Zifeng’s sword impaled his head, his aura didn’t change. Yet now, his aura was starting to fall, and this meant that he could be slain.

“What undying body? Against boss, he’s nothing!” Gu Yang shouted, only to start coughing midway. Although blood came out of his mouth, it didn’t cover up his excitement.

“Kill him now! Without that large fellow, the rest of you can’t beat him!” Just then, a shout reverberated from the gate to the ninth heaven, coming from the elder who had been communicating with Luo Changsheng.

“Attack him now! Eliminate the bane of the earth!” Luo Changsheng was the first to attack. His battle saber sliced through the air with deadly intent, but instead of aiming at Long Chen, it targeted the Dragonblood Legion

“Courting death!” In a fit of rage, Long Chen couldn’t be bothered with Wu Hun. With a furious roar, he brought his fist crashing down upon Luo Changsheng's saber,

BOOM!

The moment Long Chen was distracted, Wu Hun let out a roar and broke free of the dragon blood chains. With a swift motion, he conjured a pitch-black spear into his hand.

Wu Hun had finally taken out his weapon. When his energy flowed into it, three-colored divine radiance enveloped it, pulsating like the awakening of a wild beast. An ominous aura then permeated the air.

BOOM!

Wu Hun’s spear thrust toward the Dragonblood Legion. He knew that if he attacked Long Chen, Long Chen would simply dodge. However, by attacking the Dragonblood warriors, he could force Long Chen to save them.

Long Chen unleashed another punch, and blood flew through the air. He successfully knocked aside Wu Hun’s spear, but his fist shattered from this attack.

“Fool, do you think this spear is an ordinary Saint weapon? If I didn’t have to worry about your Earth Cauldron, you’d definitely die from my full-power attack!” declared Wu Hun. “Come, summon your Earth Cauldron. Once I corrode it with my Three-Headed race’s essence blood, we’ll see what kind of condition it’ll be in, hahahaha!” Wu Hun laughed arrogantly, as if victory was already in his grasp.

“Don’t worry, he can’t use the Earth Cauldron! The Nether Emperor’s divine weapon, the Emperor Blood Silk Net will automatically appear and take the Earth Cauldron away if he uses it!” shouted Netherdragon Tianzhao.

At first, everyone was afraid of Long Chen’s Earth Cauldron. Although it couldn’t be used to kill people, it would have no problem smashing their divine weapons apart.

However, after hearing this, everyone relaxed.

“Then there’s nothing for me to wait for! Blood Sacrifice Saint weapon! Kill them all!”

Fallen Daynight’s disciple spat out a mouthful of essence blood onto his pill cauldron, causing divine runes to illuminate its surface. In response, the cauldron’s aura surged dramatically, emanating a sacred qi that spoke of its true power as a Saint weapon.

Normally, only Sage Kings could fully harness the potential of a Saint weapon. However, as a nine-star Heavenly Doyen who had ascended to the rank of Divine Venerate, Fallen Daynight's disciple had reached a level of power that allowed him to awaken the full might of his Saint weapon. Yet, it came at a steep cost—sacrificing half of his essence blood. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

“Now that I’ve sacrificed my blood to my pill cauldron, let me see if you dare to block this attack with your Earth Cauldron!” Fallen Daynight’s disciple laughed sinisterly. He sent the pill cauldron smashing toward the Dragonblood Legion.

This activated Saint weapon possessed an aura so strong that it was crushing them, making it impossible for them to move.

Undeterred, Long Chen intercepted the attack of a Saint weapon with his fist once more, forcing the giant pill cauldron to come to a stop.

At that moment, a wave of astonishment swept through everyone present, a singular question dominating their thoughts: just what kind of physical body did Long Chen have to be able to withstand the full-power attack of a Saint weapon?

This person cannot be left alive.

All of them had the same thought. If they were to let Long Chen leave here alive, they would never be able to rest easy again.

“He doesn’t dare to use the Earth Cauldron. Everyone, attack!”

Luo Changsheng spat some blood onto his saber and also attacked. Once more, he aimed his attack at the Dragonblood warriors.

Through the probing blow of Fallen Daynight’s disciple, the others also saw their chance, sacrificing blood to their Saint weapons to attack.

“Boss, ignore us! Just make sure to avenge us!”

The Dragonblood warriors clenched their teeth at these despicable people. They didn’t dare to face Long Chen directly, so they had to use them as bait to force Long Chen to defend.

Against so many nine star Heavenly Doyens, Long Chen couldn't do anything but passively defend. Sooner or later, he would be exhausted.

Long Chen’s figure vanished from sight, reappearing in front of Luo Changsheng. Seeing this scene, Luo Changsheng smiled sinisterly. He had raised his power to the peak while waiting for Long Chen to come to him. In his estimation, this battle was already over the moment Long Chen closed in on him.

Simultaneously, Luo Changsheng’s saber quivered, and the golden bone claw above his head blazed with light. The auras of these two divine weapons instantly merged into one.

“I bet you never expected this, right? These two divine weapons are a set, and when their power fuses, nothing can stop their power! You can die knowing that you’ve been outplayed!” Luo Changsheng declared triumphantly as his weapons descended.

The power of two Saint weapons locked Long Chen firmly in place, giving him no chance to do anything. At this moment, even if Long Chen regretted his decision, it was already too late.

In the face of Luo Changsheng’s meticulously prepared move, Long Chen’s expression remained stoic, his eyes emanating a dark, unyielding resolve. With a swift motion, he raised his hand, and a black saber sliced through the air, meeting Luo Changsheng’s saber head-on.
