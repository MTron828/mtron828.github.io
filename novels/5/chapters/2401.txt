Chapter 2391 Heaven Gathering Blood Flame

Translator: BornToBe

Shen Chengfeng immediately panicked upon seeing Long Chen and Ye Qian in close contact. In his panic, his mouth slipped. He should have said that it was forbidden to fight here, but he ended up directly saying that it was forbidden to kill.

Long Chen didn’t recognize Ye Qian, but as the commander of the eighth legion, Shen Chengfeng had to recognize him. If Long Chen’s temper flared, then Long Chen could take his life in one move.

“It’s a misunderstanding! It’s all a misunderstanding!” declared Shen Chengfeng, getting in between them. “Let’s just leave things be.”

Things had yet to even start, allowing Shen Chengfeng to relax slightly. Did Long Chen have one of those legendary constitutions for drawing calamity? It had just been a moment, but he had somehow ended up going against the Divine Pill Division’s Ye Qian.

Ye Qian was not an easy figure to find within the divine families. He was quite elusive, but Long Chen had ended up running into him so quickly.

“Who are you? Do you have a place to speak here? Scram!” shouted one of Ye Qian’s followers.

Shen Chengfeng was wearing his commander robes of the eighth legion, so it was easy to tell his status. However, that person didn’t give a damn about a commander.

Shen Chengfeng didn’t get angry. “For the experts of the Divine Pill Division to not recognize me is normal. But let me express my sympathy for your blindness at such a young age.” Shen Chengfeng gestured toward the clear mark on his robes that indicated his position and name.

“You…!”

“You also don’t recognize that this is Long Chen, the number one person on the watchlist for the Martial Heaven Continent. If it wasn’t for me, the divine families would be losing some alchemy geniuses today. I will tell you directly that he has killed more people than you have ever seen. Don’t say anything about how he’ll be killed as well if he kills you. If you really want to die with him, then you can just pretend I didn’t say anything and continue as you were,” said Shen Chengfeng, gesturing for them to continue. He was also angry with these idiots who didn’t realize that he had just saved their lives. For alchemists like them who only knew how to refine pills, he could kill them as easily as killing chickens.

“You are Long Chen?” Ye Qian’s expression changed. All of them retreated a step.

They knew that Long Chen was a devil king, and nothing could restrict him. He killed heavenly geniuses without blinking an eye. His temper was also infamous, and he never accepted being threatened. He had done countless things that had shaken the world, along with causing countless calamities to befall him. But none of those calamities had taken his life. It could be said that even throughout the entire history of the Martial Heaven Continent, Long Chen was the only one who could court death every day and still be living happily.

The reason that Ye Qian’s expression changed was because Long Chen didn’t know him. He, Ye Qian, was known by everyone in the divine families, but not to Long Chen. If Long Chen had killed him right at the start, that would be far too sullen of a death.

Even if the divine families would then tear Long Chen’s corpse to pieces, he wouldn’t come back to life. To exchange a life for a life was not worth it for him.

“Yes, this is Long Chen, the only person in this world that I love. Young master Ye Qian, I am not blessed enough to receive your feelings. Hopefully, we can end things without any hurt feelings. I trust that with young master Ye Qian’s character and talent, countless women would wish to be with you. Due to my heart already belonging to someone else, I hope that young master Ye Qian can forgive me.” Wan Qing suddenly curled up against Long Chen’s arm, causing Long Chen to stare at her. She wanted him to help her escape her predicament? It seemed that Ye Qian had expressed himself to her. Most likely, she had politely evaded, but Ye Qian had yet to give up.

“Long Chen? You’ve fallen for some toad of the Martial Heaven Continent? Hmph, your vision is lacking,” sneered Ye Qian.

He was the most talented disciple of the Divine Pill Division, someone with unlimited prospects. Any woman he wanted had never refused him.

“What, are you going to turn hostile just because of a rejection? Love must be mutual. Do you think all the women in the world must love you? Someone who thinks like that would be garbage,” said Long Chen.

Long Chen reached out an arm and placed a hand on Wan Qing’s shoulder, pulling her in. Wan Qing leaned her head on his shoulder, intentionally letting Ye Qian see, but acting as if it was natural.

In his hold, with his particular scent in her nose, Wan Qing smiled.

Ignoring the ashen Ye Qian, Long Chen walked over to one of the counters and pointed at an ingredient. “Can I see this Seven Star Snow Lotus?”

The attendant put on a pair of particular gloves. She was about to take it out when Ye Qian shouted, “Hold it!”

Long Chen turned back to look at him. “What? Do you want it?”

Ye Qian sneered, “I don’t want it. I am here to announce a temporary lock on the selling of medicinal ingredients on behalf of the Divine Pill Division.”

“Are you trying to cause trouble?” Long Chen looked at Ye Qian and then looked at his own hand. He tilted his head and stared closely at Ye Qian’s face. He nodded. “Your face isn’t bad. The shape is excellent.”

Not used to Long Chen’s way of talking, Ye Qian didn’t understand what he was saying. He assumed he was insulting him.

“Young master Ye Qian, don’t you think you’re going too far? This doesn’t seem to be the style of the divine families. If such a thing were to be learned by others, what would happen to the image of the divine families?” demanded Wan Qing.

One of the disciples beside Ye Qian shouted, “Slut, shut up! This place isn’t-”

That disciple didn’t even get to finish talking when Long Chen slapped him, sending him flying. This simple slap caused half his face to collapse. He flew in an arc before landing in the distance, unconscious.

Every expert gasped. For a moment, the entire hall was silent as they stared at Long Chen. He actually dared to strike someone from the Divine Pill Division here. Furthermore, it was right in front of Ye Qian.

Shen Chengfeng’s expression had changed as soon as that person had started cursing. He tried to stop Long Chen, but was one step too late.

“Fuck, your face is really big. Did you think a big face would be enough to protect you from my hand?” sneered Long Chen. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

“Long Chen, you are courting death!” roared Ye Qian.

Shen Chengfeng immediately tried to hold Long Chen back, only for Long Chen to push him aside.

“Long Chen, don’t!”

Shen Chengfeng’s vision flashed. He was thrown off as soon as he grabbed Long Chen’s arm. He prayed that Long Chen would hold back at least slightly.

Long Chen’s hand reached out like a sharp claw, reaching for Ye Qian’s throat. Ye Qian snorted and clapped his hands together. A blood-colored light enveloped him.

“Ye Qian’s Heaven Gathering Blood Flame is an inherited flame containing divine energy. It is even capable of incinerating divine weapons!”

As an alchemist, Ye Qian wasn’t experienced with fighting, but his flame was particularly terrifying. Others didn’t even dare to touch it.

The barrier of fire that he summoned was perfect. His control was extremely skillful. There was not a single weak spot.

Ye Qian had absolute confidence in his flame. As long as Long Chen dared to touch it, he would be turned into a roasted pig. Even if he didn’t die, he’d be heavily injured.

Long Chen’s hand slammed into the flame barrier. In that instant, his hand turned the same color as fire. His hand freely passed through it.

In front of everyone’s stunned gazes, Long Chen grabbed Ye Qian’s throat and raised him into the air.

“Courting death? Who, you?” sneered Long Chen.

Suddenly, buzzing passed through the hall. Shen Chengfeng’s expression changed. People had set off the alarm. After that, he shoved one of his stunned vice commanders. “Quick, report this to Elder Long!”

The vice commander woke up and hastily rushed away. Shen Chengfeng almost wanted to cry. Elder Long had told him to stay with Long Chen and look after him so that he wouldn’t cause trouble.

However, after being apart for just a short time, Long Chen had caused a calamity. He didn’t even dare to try advising Long Chen to let go, afraid that Long Chen might crush Ye Qian in a rage.

“Bastard, you are courting death! Release senior apprentice-brother Ye Qian, or-!” One of the disciples roared, only to be kicked away by Long Chen. He coughed up blood and slammed into a stone wall. He slid down, leaving a line of blood on the wall. It was unknown if he was alive or dead.

The people of the divine families trembled. Long Chen was really vicious. He didn’t have any misgivings about their status. They were finally bearing witness to his domineering side.

“Long Chen, what do you want?!” shouted Ye Qian, shocked and infuriated.

“It’s not what I want. It’s what you want. If you want to reincarnate, then just nod. To tell the truth, I’m quite skilled in that,” said Long Chen indifferently.

BOOM!

Suddenly, lightning exploded out of Long Chen’s body. Rumbling rang out as the lightning ended up shattering some kind of invisible energy.

“Play a stupid game like that against me again, and I’ll kill this idiot. If you don’t believe me, just try it.” Long Chen appeared in the sky, lightning wings on his back. He was staring coldly at an old man who had appeared at the entrance.
