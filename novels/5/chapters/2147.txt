Chapter 2137 Tidying Up

The seven blood-colored winged devils were destroyed by Yue Xiaoqian’s sword. After being turned to stone, they were brittle and easily destroyed.

Yue Xiaoqian waved her hand, gathering the seven devil cores. She then flew over to the mother, looking at her worshipfully. “Mom, you’re so powerful!”

“After cultivating for a few thousand years, I finally have a chance to slay some devils. I suppose I’ve finally won some face for our ancestors.” Yue Xihan smiled, gratified. The original devil race existed to slay devils, and now she had finally done that.

They had inherited the devil-slaying arts for countless years but hadn’t had any targets to use them on. Today, they could finally feel some pride in being members of the original devil race.

After those seven blood-colored winged devils were killed, the other winged devils panicked and began to flee for the exit.

“My blood leads the way, my soul opens the path...” Yue Xihan formed new hand seals, and the other experts of the original devil race that she had brought along followed, quietly chanting the same thing as her.

“Condense!”

Yue Xihan let out a cry. All the original devil race’s experts began to shine. A drop of crystalline liquid floated out of every one of their foreheads, flying toward Yue Xihan.

A drop also came out of Yue Xihan’s forehead. It sparkled with a pure light, and a supreme will was contained within that one drop.

All the drops gathered into a ball of water that dropped onto the ground. That ball of water had no aura. It didn’t whistle toward the ground with any speed. But when it fell, the world became still. The only thing moving within the world was that ball of water.

BOOM!

The ball exploded. A ripple spread in every direction, instantly enveloping the battlefield.

The ripple didn’t harm the Magical Beasts. It didn’t even cause their fur to ripple.

However, those fleeing winged devils instantly blew apart. Millions of winged devils were killed by this one attack.

“This...”

Long Chen was shocked. The original devil race’s devil-slaying arts were incomparable. This wasn’t a fight but a slaughter. It didn’t seem to take any effort.

Even the Magical Beasts were shocked. They simply stood there, not daring to move. The drake king, its mate, and its child stood there, quietly staring at the battlefield that was filled with corpses.

Finally, a roar rang out. One of the wild lions bared its fangs at the experts of the original devil race. After all, Magical Beasts were Magical Beasts. Their bloodlines were wild, resulting in their intelligence being very low. They mostly acted on instinct. The other Magical Beasts also began to show hostility toward the original devil race.

The experts of the original devil race began to grow nervous. These were terrifying twelfth rank Magical Beasts, and the original devil race didn’t have any special suppressive effect against them.

“What, do you want to become enemies?” demanded Long Chen, walking forward.

However, he didn’t need to do any more before the drake king let out a growl. Those terrifying twelfth rank Magical Beasts immediately ceased any hostile actions. They just stared.

The drake king came forward with its mate and lowered its head to Long Chen. That posture seemed to be expressing their thanks.

The drake king then made several sounds, seeming to be trying to communicate with Long Chen. But Long Chen wasn’t Meng Qi, and he couldn’t understand.

He suddenly had a thought. He bit his finger, forcing out three drops of his essence blood that he sent flying toward the drake king, its mate, and its child.

When those drops of essence blood appeared, all the Golden Horned Drakes present shivered, staring intensely at the blood. This blood contained the azure dragon’s essence blood. Anything related to the dragon race would sense the divine aura contained within it.

Before this, Long Chen had summoned the Azure Dragon Battle Armor but had been forced to suppress it so that he didn’t release any dragon might. If he had, all the Magical Beasts would have been suppressed by that pressure. Now though, sensing the power within just these three drops of blood, the Magical Beasts stared at Long Chen fearfully.

Being instinctual creatures, these Magical Beasts wouldn’t factor in Long Chen’s cultivation base, or if he was a match for them. This dragon might was enough to make them afraid. This was why Long Chen dared to enter the depths of the wilderness. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

The drake king took the initiative to swallow the drop of blood floating toward it. Marks began to appear on its scales, and its aura vaguely began to transform.

As for its mate, it actually sent both drops toward its child, sending them into its body.

The tiny drake’s body shuddered, and then it fell asleep, not knowing what was going on.

Seeing this, Yue Xiaoqian was once more moved. She looked at her own mother, who was also looking at her with a loving smile.

“Respected expert, thank you for coming to our aid.” The drake king actually began to communicate mentally with Long Chen. That was because Long Chen had left a spiritual mark within his blood so that he could communicate with the drake king.

“No need to be courteous. I possess dragon blood, so we aren’t technically outsiders. Are you the ruler of this world?” asked Long Chen.

“Yes, but also no. This world is split into two portions, and I control the eastern portion. The west is controlled by the Blood Phoenix race. We often fight, but neither one of us is able to dominate the other,” answered the drake king.

Long Chen was startled, not having expected that this wild world was actually split into two factions.

“Then do you know who I am?” asked Long Chen.

“You are one of the lifeforms from the other world who have recently come. We were planning on forcing you back, but then these openings to the devil world appeared here. Powerful winged devils occasionally come out, so we have no choice but to concentrate our attention here. We haven’t had time to handle you,” said the drake king after a moment of silence.

Long Chen smiled. This drake king actually did have some thoughts. It even considered whether to answer truthfully to Long Chen. “Perhaps you aren’t too welcoming toward us, but this could be an opportunity for you. Sometimes a careless investment can have a good return. For example, because you didn’t expel us, we were able to help you during your most critical moment.”

“Correct. Without all of you, we would have died. I have to thank you especially for saving our child.” The drake king nodded.

Hearing this, Long Chen was much more confident. It should be easier for him to get the Magical Beasts to do what he wanted.

“Can you have your people leave for now so we can clean up the battlefield? It seems that they aren’t too friendly toward us,” said Long Chen.

The drake king nodded and began to roar at the Magical Beasts. Those Magical Beasts glanced at Long Chen, some of them ominously.

The drake king immediately gave a real roar, and those Magical Beasts scattered. After they left, Yue Xiaoqian and the others excitedly went through the battlefield. The devil cores of these winged devils were priceless treasures to them.

Wilde also swept through the battlefield. There were over a thousand powerful Magical Beasts that had been slain during this battle, and their huge corpses were his rations.

Long Chen told Wilde not to eat those corpses for now. He wanted to extract their essence blood, crystal cores, and anything useful for alchemy first.

In the end, the only Magical Beast left was the drake king that accompanied Long Chen. After tidying up the battlefield, Long Chen, Yue Xihan, and the drake king went to the huge opening from which the winged devils had come.

This hole was many miles wide. There were two such openings, and they were covered in black qi that made them like gaping mouths. A sinister air came from them.

“These lead to the devil world?” asked Long Chen.

Yue Xihan said, “Not exactly. There are countless devil worlds sprinkled throughout millions of star-fields. Every star-field has countless worlds like the Martial Heaven Continent. This channel can be considered a crack in the chaotic flow of space. The winged devil race is constantly trying to invade other worlds, so when they find one, they will immediately establish a channel to that world. Just like the sects of the Martial Heaven Continent, they view other worlds as resources, and we are their prey. They’ll normally send a few devil races to attack the various worlds. You defended the Xuantian Dao Sect’s abyss against those devils before. The devil race consists of many different species, said to number in the millions. The winged devils are simply the oldest amongst the devil races, and the majority of the devil race belongs to the winged devil race. Of course, they’re also the ones that do the most killing of the human race. Long Chen, if you have this drake king help, I can seal this channel to keep some peace for now,” said Yue Xihan.

“No, we can’t do that!” Long Chen hastily waved his hand.
