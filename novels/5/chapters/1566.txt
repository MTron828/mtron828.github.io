Chapter 1561 Killing Bloodkill 1

Translator: BornToBe

BOOM!

That translucent figure was blown apart by Long Chen’s attack. However, once it shattered, people realized it was just a fake.

Long Chen seemed to have realized it was a fake a while ago and wasn’t surprised at all. His Yuan Spirit shone brighter, and the flames in the sky rapidly condensed.

“Raging Flame Prison!”

Countless flame chains formed a huge net that covered a huge space.

A muffled sound came from a certain region. Long Chen snorted and slashed his saber there.

“Now where are you going to hide?”

A sharp sword appeared in the space Long Chen slashed, blocking his saber. Bloodkill 1’s figure appeared.

Bloodkill 1 coughed up a mouthful of blood and flew back. He was actually unable to receive a single blow from Long Chen.

Bloodkill 1 couldn’t help being shocked. He had known that Long Chen was powerful, too powerful for him to block his attacks. However, he had used a magical art when his sword had clashed with his saber, weakening the power of his saber eighteen times.

If he used this move on anyone else, their power would be reduced to less than a tenth, and he would just have to receive that tiny portion. However, Long Chen’s power was incomparably concentrated, making it so Bloodkill 1 could only reduce his power by about fifty percent. The remaining force caused him to cough up blood, and his sword was damaged. His divine item now had a large nick in it.

Originally, Bloodkill 1 hadn’t planned on participating in this battle. The Dragon Slaughtering Convention had its own goals, and it was being controlled by Pill Valley. Pill Valley, the Xuan Beasts, and the Corrupt path had become the dominating forces behind the convention.

As for the Bloodkill Hall, they had been invited, but Pill Valley had made its intentions clear to them. This matter would be led by Pill Valley. Others could participate, but they had to listen to orders.

So in the end, the Bloodkill Hall had sent Bloodkill 1 and not that mysterious expert. Bloodkill 1 was only sent as a formality.

Bloodkill 1 was very clear on that. He was only here to show his face and show that the Bloodkill Hall’s people had come. This was to give face to Pill Valley.

If the Bloodkill Hall really cared about this convention, they wouldn’t have sent Bloodkill 1 but that terrifying girl instead.

Bloodkill 1 had thought he would just be a spectator and wouldn’t even have a chance to fight. However, just now, Yan Weishan had sent him a secret message to cooperate with the three of them and sneak attack Long Chen.

Yan Weishan knew that Bloodkill 1 wasn’t as strong as the three of them in ordinary combat, but his assassination arts were extremely terrifying. With the three of them drawing Long Chen’s attention, there was a high chance Bloodkill 1 could kill or at least heavily injure Long Chen in one attack.

However, no one had expected that as soon as Bloodkill 1 snuck his way onto the battlefield, before he could attack, he was noticed by Long Chen. It was like Long Chen had long since prepared a trap for him and had simply been waiting.

They didn’t know that Long Chen’s Nine Star Hegemon Body Art had fully memorized the air of the Bloodkill Hall’s assassins. Bloodkill 1’s assassination arts might be marvelous, and he might have a divine item to mask his presence, but he wasn’t able to trick the senses of the Nine Star Hegemon Body Art.

As soon as he had tried to sneak his way over to him, Long Chen had sensed him. Long Chen had waited until he was close enough to launch an attack.

However, Bloodkill 1 was truly amazing. Long Chen had clearly landed an attack on him, but he had used some kind of technique to switch himself out with a fake and dodge his first attack.

Regretfully, Long Chen had already been prepared for him. He was now imprisoned in a cage of flames. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

“Save him!” Yan Weishan’s expression changed. He hadn’t expected Long Chen to be so sly as to have prepared a trap for Bloodkill 1. In this scenario, Bloodkill 1 wouldn’t be able to last for long before being killed. After all, he hadn’t awakened his manifestation.

Yan Weishan was the first to charge out, his golden furnace smashing onto Long Chen’s flame prison, wanting to destroy it.

However, the flame prison was like cotton. His attack made the prison cave in, but it didn’t break.

At this moment, Long Chen was pressing on toward Bloodkill 1. Bloodkill 1 had summoned his manifestation, and his Yuan Spirit was unleashing powerful magical arts that filled the space around him with sword-light. However, he was repeatedly forced back by Long Chen and was hacking up blood.

It went without saying that Bloodkill 1 was very powerful. Even under Long Chen’s torrential attacks, he managed to last three exchanges.

However, he was like a candle flickering in the wind and might be extinguished at any moment. Long Chen was like a ferocious beast, while the former was just a slightly stronger sheep.

“Focus all our attacks on one spot!” shouted Yan Weishan at the other two. He could already tell that Long Chen was too powerful. With the three of them joining hands, even if they could defeat him, they wouldn’t be able to kill him. If Long Chen wanted to run, they wouldn’t be able to stop him. If they lost a powerful helper like Bloodkill 1, this Dragon Slaughtering Convention would most likely end up being a joke.

Hu Xiaolin’s bone claw, Jin Mingwei’s blood gourd, and Yan Weishan’s golden furnace all shrank to just three meters in size. The three divine items began to shine, joining together to smash into Long Chen’s Raging Flame Prison.

With the three of them concentrating all their power on one tiny spot, they knew that despite the flame prison’s flexibility and tenacity, they would still be able to at least create a large hole in it. Breaking just a portion of a magical art should be enough to cause the rest of it to weaken and even crumble.

BOOM!

The three of their divine items pierced Long Chen’s flame prison, delighting them. But their smiles quickly vanished.

The instant that they broke through Long Chen’s flame prison, Long Chen sent Bloodkill 1 flying toward their three divine items. Everything had been calculated perfectly.

BOOM!

The three divine items emitted their divine power, instantly killing Bloodkill 1. Let alone his Yuan Spirit, not even the slightest speck of him remained.

“How vicious. How dare you kill him just because you didn’t want to split the glory? Eat my saber!” Long Chen roared as if they had killed an old friend of his.

Jin Mingwei, Hu Xiaolin, and Yan Weishan almost coughed up blood from anger. Long Chen was actually trying to pin the blame on them for Bloodkill 1’s death?

The thing that infuriated them the most was that their divine items had already flown out, and they had no time to call them back. They had to face Long Chen’s attack without them.

BOOM! The three of them were blown far into the distance by Long Chen’s saber. Yan Weishan coughed up a mouthful of blood as he was a flame cultivator.

“Where’d he go?!” The three of them called back their divine items but suddenly found that Long Chen had vanished.

Suddenly, startled cries rang out in the distance. A black saber-image slashed through the experts that had once attacked the Dragonblood Legion.

Countless experts were blown to bits. The Bloodkill Hall’s experts that had come with Bloodkill 1 were all paid particular attention.

“Dragonblood Legion, other than the neutral camp’s people, slaughter them all!”

Following Long Chen’s orders, the Dragonblood warriors roared ferociously and raised their weapons.

“Boss, I’ve been waiting for you to say that.” Guo Ran was the fastest to reach his enemies with wings appearing on his armor.

“Didn’t you want to kill us just now? Let’s see who kills who!” The Dragonblood warriors crashed down on their enemies like a tsunami. A huge battle erupted.

Countless wooden stakes flew out of the ground. Even faster than Guo Ran, Chu Yao’s attack landed first.

Chu Yao’s goal was clear. She targeted the Empyreans as she was the only Empyrean in the Dragonblood Legion. She immediately trapped five Empyreans and began to attack them.

Guo Ran slashed his saber at the Empyrean who had fought against him at the beginning. Suddenly, his chest plate opened.

Dozens of needles shot out, piercing holes in the Empyrean’s body.

The Empyrean didn’t even have time to recover from his shock when Guo Ran landed a kick that blew up his lower body.

“Did you think your daddy Guo only had that little ability? Fool, I have plenty of peerless techniques!” sneered Guo Ran.

This Empyrean had fought against Guo Ran for hours and had naturally assumed that he had managed to probe most of Guo Ran’s abilities. He hadn’t expected Guo Ran to actually be so sinister.

“Die!” Guo Ran slashed his saber down again as his opponent only had half his upper body left. The poor Empyrean instinctively raised his divine item, which only resulted in the rest of his body exploding. A fist-sized figure of light hastily fled.

However, his Yuan Spirit hadn’t gotten far when Sword Qi crashed down, turning it to dust.

“What the-? Yue Zifeng, you snatched my prey!” cried out Guo Ran.

“Next time you can take mine,” said Yue Zifeng indifferently. He was already attacking another Empyrean.

Li Qi, Song Mingyuan, Tang Wan-er, Gu Yang, and Meng Qi were all attacking. Each of them was fighting a powerful Empyrean. Meng Qi was surrounded by sword-light that formed a blooming lotus.

She had a total of nine hundred and ninety-nine flying swords. These were soul items Guo Ran had poured his blood, sweat, and tears into to forge. The person Guo Ran worshipped the most was Long Chen; however, the one he was most grateful for had recently changed to be Meng Qi.

If it hadn’t been for Meng Qi’s help, there was no way he would have had enough soul energy to nourish his armor considering it was formed of multiple Ancestral items. In order to thank Meng Qi, Guo Ran had spent a huge amount of time and energy to create these nine hundred and ninety-nine flying swords. Soul gold had been smelted into them, allowing them to be controlled easily by Meng Qi’s Spiritual Strength.

With Meng Qi’s powerful Spiritual Strength, these soul items formed a terrifying formation that made her enemies feel like they were surrounded by nine hundred and ninety-nine experts. Her opponent was forced back over and over again. His Heavenly Dao energy might be able to suppress Meng Qi’s Heavenly Dao energy, but it wasn’t able to suppress her soul energy.

Long Chen didn’t glance at the battle after his attack and orders. He immediately returned back to his own battlefield. His attack, kills, orders, and return were all done in an instant.

Just as Yan Weishan and the others were charging over, Long Chen received them midway, not allowing them to interfere with the battle.
