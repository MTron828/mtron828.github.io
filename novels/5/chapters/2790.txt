Chapter 2779 The Five Sovereigns Pass Away

At this moment, the barrier protecting Long Chen was covered in cracks, and the figures of the five Sovereigns were incredibly faint.

“How regretful. We are fated not to bear witness to the final result. Are we going to fade away just like this?” Sovereign Zi Yang sighed. His body began to dissipate from his legs, transforming into tiny runes that flew apart.

Sovereign Mo Li smiled faintly. “Although we can’t see the result, I trust that it won’t let us down.”

Sovereign Qing Xu only stared outside and sighed. It was unknown if he was sighing because he was already dead and couldn’t participate in this battle or something else.

Sovereign Han Wei looked at Long Chen with a hint of longing in her eyes. Her body also began to dissipate.

“While I was alive, my man wasn’t. While my man is alive, I am already dead. I leave my feelings in these heavens, never to be forgotten…” Sovereign Han Wei looked at Long Chen sadly. However, she was just a remnant discarnate soul, powerless to change anything. She had swept through two eras, slaughtering all her enemies, but not one person was able to enter her eyes.

However, now that she was just a discarnate soul, she encountered Long Chen, the first man to enter her eyes. Love was truly an emotion that played with people.

Sovereign Han Wei then looked from Long Chen to Zi Yan and finally smiled contentedly. “Goodbye forever, the one I waited two lifetimes for.”

After that, Sovereign Han Wei faded away, along with Sovereign Qing Xu, Mo Li, and Zi Yang.

Only Sovereign Yun Shang remained. However, his figure was also extremely faint. It clearly wouldn’t last much longer.

BOOM!

Finally, the barrier exploded and countless enemies charged toward Long Chen. The Martial Heaven Continent’s experts were drowned out by their numbers, unable to stop them.

Just at this moment, the image of the Eastern Wasteland Bell in the sky vanished. Its body appeared above Long Chen’s head.

After that, divine light fell from it, protecting Long Chen. On top of the bell was Yun Tian, and his body was wrapped in chains. His appearance was strange, completely different from normal.

Sovereign Yun Shang looked at Yun Tian guiltily. He wanted to say something, but even though his lips moved, no words came out.

“You don’t need to say anything. As your descendant, this is my sacred duty. I am proud of it,” said Yun Tian.

“Thank you.” In the end, Sovereign Yun Shang was only able to spit out two simple words.

“Dad. If there is a reincarnation, I wish to be your son again in the next life.”

Sovereign Yun Shang trembled to hear Yun Tian call him dad. He smiled. But as his body faded, that smile also vanished from this world.

The five Sovereigns had given up everything for the Martial Heaven Continent. Even in death, their soul essence remained to give a final burst of power to protect the continent. They were truly the continent’s protective gods, this world’s greatest contributors.

“Die!”

With the five Sovereigns gone and only the Eastern Wasteland Bell protecting Long Chen, enemies crashed down upon Long Chen.

However, when their attacks struck the Eastern Wasteland Bell’s barrier, a strange power repelled them.

“Blood Sacrifice Guard?”

The High Priest and the others were shocked to see this. Yun Tian had actually used a sacrificial art to create a wall to protect Long Chen.

Now they understood why Sovereign Yun Shang had apologized to Yun Tian. Yun Tian had received the mission to protect Long Chen and was using his own life to carry out this mission.

Once this technique was activated, it could not be stopped. In other words, Yun Tian had sacrificed his life. Whether or not the barrier was broken, his life would be forfeit.

Of the five Sovereigns, only Yun Shang had managed to have a son. With his Heavenly Fate Eyes, he was able to see a glimpse of the future. In other words, he had given birth to a son just for today.

Not only had he sacrificed everything about himself for the Martial Heaven Continent, but even his son took over this mission, using his life to protect this world. His fate was set.

At this moment, the Martial Heaven Continent’s experts couldn’t help being moved to tears. Even the High Priest’s eyes were wet.

“Yun Tian was born to be Long Chen’s companion,” sighed Ma Ruyun.

Yun Tian must have known of his fate long ago. As for Yun Shang, he was filled with guilt toward this son of his. Everything was for the Martial Heaven Continent.

Even as countless experts assaulted the barrier, Yun Tian simply stood on top of the Eastern Wasteland Bell. The chains condensed from his soul and blood fluttered. But no matter how they attacked the barrier, it majestically stood strong.

“Kill!”

Mo Nian charged forward ferociously. In this lifetime, perhaps the only one he was willing to call boss was Yun Tian.

The current Yun Tian was like a candle burning himself to win time for Long Chen. The five Sovereigns had vanished and the barrier had crumbled. This allowed the supreme divine items to return to their masters. With his double Saint barrier and the Central Plains Cauldron above his head, Mo Nian unleashed destructive arrows containing the power of the Central Plains Cauldron. His arrows forcibly slaughtered a path through the armies of invaders.

“Charge!”

When that path appeared, Guo Ran led the Dragonblood Legion through it. Long Chen was the crux of this battle, and everyone was fighting for more time for him.

“Where do you think you’re going?!” The Nine-Headed Lion roared and chased after Mo Nian, only to have icy Sword Qi block his path.

Ye Zhiqiu’s sword froze space, and half of the Nine-Headed Lion’s body lost any sensation when he was struck. Startled, he retreated.

The supreme divine items were now focusing their power on combat, and the Nine-Headed Lion finally sensed their terror. That Ice Qi had invaded his soul, almost freezing it.

BOOM!

Just at this moment, the spatial gates above the Yin Yang World, Ancient Battlefield, Corrupt God Cemetery, and Devil Spirit Mountain rumbled. The gates opened a bit wider.

Following that, terrifying auras came out. More and more experts walked out of the gates.

“Emperors!”

Startled cries rang out. Originally, the experts coming out were Saints with half a step into the Emperor realm. However, when the gates opened a bit wider, experts that had reached the Emperor level came out as well. Upon seeing this, everyone’s hearts turned cold.

“Defend the barrier!” shouted the High Priest. Mo Nian, Wilde, Zi Yan, and Ye Zhiqiu abandoned their opponents, charging over to the side of the Eastern Wasteland Bell. The Martial Heaven Continent’s experts focused all their power there.

However, there were too many enemies. Casualties quickly began to stack up on the Martial Heaven Continent’s side.

“If we only defend, we’ll be at too much of a disadvantage!” shouted Song Mingyuan. This couldn’t continue much longer. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

Everyone knew that this couldn’t be maintained for much longer. However, if they allowed others to attack the barrier, then Yun Tian also wouldn’t be able to last for long.

Right now, the faintest qi of a Sovereign had been condensed by Long Chen, so every bit of time that they could stall was a bit more hope.

However, the four spatial gates continued to slowly open. More and more foreign experts flooded onto the continent. The very sky was cracking as if the world was about to burst.

BOOM!

Suddenly, out of nowhere, spatial gates began to appear above their heads. In total, three additional gates opened.

“It’s doomed!” People’s hearts sank. This really left them with no hope.

“The Xiao tribe’s Xiao Fei is here! Experts of the Immemorial Path are here to reinforce big brother Long Chen!” A mighty voice rang out.
