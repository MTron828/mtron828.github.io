Long Chen lifted with his arms, and the giant boulder was pushed aside. Luo Bing and Luo Ning were then shocked to see the Unfettered Alliance’s disciples inside of the cave behind it.

This cave was now filled with people seemingly on their last breaths. They lay strewn throughout the room, almost like they were dead.

“Brother San…”

Amongst all of them, only Mu Qingyun was barely able to stay awake. However, she had long since reached her limit. Her gaze was unfocused even as she looked at Long Chen. When she saw Long Chen, she let out an extremely quiet cry and slowly collapsed.

With a flash, Long Chen appeared beside her, grabbing her. She then rested her head on his shoulder. Looking up at him, she smiled. “Brother San… I didn’t disappoint you!”

“You did well. For you to be able to endure this long completely surpassed my expectations. But you still can’t fall asleep. Maintain your consciousness. When your essence, qi, and spirit are all exhausted, all that’s left to keep you going is your will. Falling unconscious is a kind of compromise with yourself. It’s lowering your head. You’ve already endured for this long, so keep going. Your energy will quickly recover, and your mental realm will reach an entirely new level. Stand with me slowly. Use your will to move your powerless body. Let your energy reignite throughout your body.” Long Chen slowly helped Mu Qingyun up.

“She has already severely overdrafted her power. If you force her like this, her foundation might be harmed…” Luo Ning couldn’t help giving a warning.

“It’s fine. I have my calculations,” said Long Chen.

Mu Qingyun had absolute trust in Long Chen. Relying entirely on her will, she tried to move her body. When she was standing again, she felt the world spinning around her. She almost fainted.

However, she gritted her teeth, forcefully enduring. After several breaths’ time, the feeling of dizziness slowly faded, and she gradually began to be able to feel her weak body again. An incense stick’s worth of time later, a bit of rosiness returned to her pale face.

“These two are…?” Once she recovered, she noticed Luo Bing and Luo Ning. She suddenly cried out, “These two are the alliance heads of the Immortal Institute!”

Mu Qingyun had met Luo Ning before. However, with the enmity between the God Institute and the Immortal Institute, they didn’t have any relationship.

It was only later that she learned that Luo Ning was the second-in-command of the Immortal Institute’s number one alliance, while the true leader was her big sister. Seeing Luo Bing, Mu Qingyun instantly guessed her status.

“I am Luo Ning. This is my big sister Luo Bing.” Luo Ning gave a quick introduction before looking at Long Chen. “Long Chen, you’re not very sincere. If you want to marry into my Luo family, how can you go around randomly seducing other women?”

“Ning-er! Have some propriety!” Luo Bing dragged Luo Ning behind her. This little sister of hers was sometimes infuriating. She always spoke without thinking.

Mu Qingyun then looked from Luo Bing and Luo Ning to Long Chen. Coming to a realization, she looked at Long Chen with hidden bitterness. “Brother San, you want me to be your little sister because of them?”

Long Chen rolled his eyes. How had such a thing resulted in jealousy? “Don’t talk nonsense. I’m good friends with them, but I see you as a real little sister.”

Although he hadn’t known Mu Qingyun for long, he had a certain understanding of sword cultivators. He didn’t want any romantic feelings to occur between him and Mu Qingyun. If such a thing occurred, her life would probably be ruined.

Hearing this, Mu Qingyun smiled. They were friends, but she was a sister. The degree of familiarity was made clear.

“You…” Luo Ning was about to interject when Luo Bing covered her mouth.

“Ning-er, don’t mess around. Think of a way to save the others.” Luo Bing gestured to the disciples that were strewn about. They all looked to be on the verge of death.

“Don’t touch them for now. Let them wake up naturally,” said Long Chen.

“Brother San, what happened? Everything was going well, but then the will of the flame suddenly multiplied, almost incinerating our power. Our physical power, our bloodline power, our spiritual power, they were all incinerated. We endured as best as we could, but it was too strong. We couldn’t last. I remembered your words to endure, so I suppose I managed to last until you returned, but…” Mu Qingyun still felt some fear toward what had just happened.

Originally, they had all been enduring the broiling of the remnant will of the Heavenly Flame. But when its power suddenly soared, it instantly became like a hellish torment.

“It was due to the Heavenly Flame seed causing a resonance throughout the cave system. It increased the pressure you were under. But I trust that everyone’s mental realms will have advanced after such a tempering. It will be even better than what I anticipated,” said Long Chen.

The Heavenly Flame seed had been taken by him, so the will of the Heavenly Flame here was starting to fade. An hour later, Li Cai and the others began to awaken.

When they awoke, they were incredibly weak. But Mu Qingyun had already recovered. In terms of the mental realm, she had taken an extra step compared to them. She then looked at Long Chen with increasing reverence.

Everyone else looked like they had been struck by a serious illness, but she hadn’t fainted and had leaped to a new level. Because of this, in her eyes, Long Chen had reached the level of omnipotence.

Even Luo Bing and Luo Ning were surprised by Mu Qingyun’s transformation. This practically toppled common sense. She had clearly severely overdrafted her energy, so how did she recover so quickly? Furthermore, Long Chen seemed to have expected such an illogical phenomenon.

When Li Cai and the others woke up, Long Chen had everyone immediately stand and prepare to leave.

“Boss San, can you let us rest for a while? I feel powerless.” Li Cai almost cried. His body was almost numb. It didn’t even feel like his own body.

“Don’t be daft. Hurry up. If you’re too slow, you won’t even have your life afterward,” urged Long Chen. Hence, everyone did their best to walk out.

Once they were out of the cave system, Mu Qingyun took out the flying boat, and they sped off.

However, they didn’t go far. They stopped on a concealed mountain top and activated the flying boat’s concealing formation. From here, they could clearly see Crescent Moon Valley.

“Long Chen, what are you doing?” asked Luo Ning.

“Are you waiting for Chu Kuang to come back?” guessed Luo Bing.

Long Chen nodded. “With Chu Kuang’s character, he probably won’t give up just like this. He should immediately gather his forces and return. He knows that it takes some time to take a Heavenly Flame seed. As long as he’s fast enough, he’ll have a chance to stop us… Hehe, look, he’s here.”

Long Chen suddenly pointed. Through the formation, they clearly saw a group rushing straight toward the heart of Crescent Moon Valley.

“He’s flying through the air! It’s a Four Peak realm expert!” Luo Bing couldn’t help sucking in a cold gasp of air when she saw the elder at the front.
