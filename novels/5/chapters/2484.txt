Chapter 2474 Dragon King Blood Essence Stone

Through the dragon scale’s rune, Long Chen was transported into a different space. There was a giant blood pool here. Rather than calling it a blood pool, it should be called a blood sea.

This blood thrummed with vigorous dragon energy. Standing here, Long Chen could sense countless dragons roaring.

“This is the Ten Thousand Dragon Pool. Only pure-blooded dragons that have received the approval of the dragon king’s heroic spirit can enter here. According to Evilmoon, I am the only human in this world in possession of true dragon essence blood, so I’m the only one who can enter.” Long Chen examined the surroundings.

He noticed that the shore had been turned red by the dragon blood. It was glowing.

“The dragon bone is the nest, while the dragon blood is the sea. The essence blood of successive generations of dragon experts has been accumulated here. Evilmoon said that when a dragon reaches its limit, when it senses its life starting to fade, it will extract its strongest aspect for its descendants. But ninety-nine percent of this essence blood has been used up. It seems that the dragon king must have encountered some terrifying enemy and used up the essence blood for combat power. But in the end, the dragon king still died.” Long Chen sighed.

This blood pool was gigantic. But in comparison to its size, it could be said that what remained was only some dregs at the bottom of the pot.

Despite just being some dregs, it was an enormous amount. Long Chen couldn’t possibly use it all.

For some reason, Long Chen was filled with regret for the dragon king.

Long Chen sat by the shore for a while before slowly approaching. The calm dragon pool began to boil when he approached. Roaring rang out in Long Chen’s ears.

He was no longer able to suppress the dragon blood flowing within his own veins. The Azure Dragon Battle Armor was unleashed.

Dragon roars resounded through the air. Long Chen couldn’t control himself. He was unaware that the moment his Azure Dragon Battle Armor came out, the dragon king’s body on the altar lit up, causing Feng Fei and Zhao Ritian to jump.

If the dragon king was still alive, then considering that the two of them were breaking the foundation of the dragon nest, they would definitely be killed. They turned pale, but they already knew that the divine races had long since discovered the dragon nest and confirmed that the dragon king was dead. What was unleashing this dragon roar?

The two of them stared at the dragon king’s body, bewildered. However, when nothing further happened, the two of them continued releasing the energy of the barrier.

Long Chen had no idea that he had caused the dragon king’s corpse to react. He was now standing before the blood. The boiling blood had calmed down instantly when his Azure Dragon Battle Armor came out.

As the dragon blood in his veins raged, it unleashed a majestic might as if it was a king looking down on others.

“Those qualified to leave their blood here were all existences above the Netherpassage realm. But a king is a king. Even though my realm hasn’t reached that level, the might of a king can suppress all others. The azure dragon is a true dragon, but based on this, it seems that its origins are not ordinary,” thought Long Chen.

When Long Chen had obtained this azure dragon essence blood, he had sworn an oath to the mysterious dragon expert. However, that expert had never communicated with him again, nor was there any connection between them.

The green dragon essence blood and the azure dragon essence blood had both come from the same dragon. Its essence blood was enough to make the blood belonging to tens of thousands of dragons submit.

Long Chen dove into the pool. The essence blood didn’t attack him. However, it also didn’t express any friendliness. He felt as if it was coldly staring at him.

Immense pressure came upon him from every direction within the blood pool, and if it wasn’t for the Azure Dragon Battle Armor, it would have been enough to crush his body.

Long Chen quickly reached the bottom of the blood pool. Here, he saw a fist-sized crystal.

“Blood essence stone, and one from a dragon king at that.” Long Chen couldn’t help being shaken.

Evilmoon had said that that the blood essence stone was the foundation of the Ten Thousand Dragon Nest. First came the blood essence stone, then the four divine bones, and then the rest of the nest.

The blood essence stone was floating at the bottom of the pool and slowly spinning as it did so. Multicolored light shone in the surrounding space around it, but that light only stretched within ten feet of it.

Within that beautiful light was a terrifying power. Every strand of it possessed the power of a dragon king. To the current Long Chen, just touching it might be fatal.

The dragon king was already dead, so this blood essence stone was a masterless object. If he wanted to take it, it would definitely instinctively resist.

“This is crazy”.

Despite saying that, Long Chen still reached out. The instant he touched the barrier, the multicolored light within went berserk. Its killing intent made Long Chen’s hair stand on end.

He immediately retreated. If he angered this blood essence stone, he would be instantly wiped out.

“What to do?” Long Chen was stuck in a difficult place. His dragon blood could suppress other dragon’s blood but not the blood essence stone of the dragon king.

The fact that the blood essence stone hadn’t directly attacked was most likely giving face to the true dragon essence blood within his body. It had just given a warning. If he tried again though, it would definitely attack.

Long Chen just stared at it. As he didn’t approach again, the violent light returned to calm.

Long Chen extended a hand carefully, using his Spiritual Strength to express his good intentions. But either the blood essence stone was declining to communicate with him, or it didn’t have its own consciousness, it entered a berserk state once more, causing Long Chen to instantly pull his hand back.

This time, he saw blood droplets come out of his arm. When he looked closely, he was shocked to find that his arm had cracked.

“This is the backlash? Damn, the dragon king’s power is so great! How could such a terrifying existence die?” Long Chen was stunned. This dragon king was truly worthy of admiration.

No wonder Evilmoon had told him to be careful. If he couldn’t obtain it, he shouldn’t force it, or he would die.

“What a shame that the dragon king is already dead. Perhaps if it was still alive, I could communicate with it. Now, it can only act instinctively.” Long Chen sighed helplessly.

This was a problem that intelligence could not resolve. As for power, that was nonsense. At this time, the old man would definitely accurately say that in front of this absolute power, no schemes would help.

The essence blood stone hadn’t even directly attacked Long Chen, but just touching the power of a dragon king was unbearable for him.

“Fine, I’ll test my peerless move.”

Long Chen took a deep breath. Forming hand seals, the primal chaos space shuddered. Spatial energy enveloped the essence blood stone.

Suddenly, the essence blood stone went berserk. Long Chen wanted to draw it into the primal chaos space, enraging it. A furious dragon cry rang out as it fought.

The primal chaos space shuddered intensely, following which a sacred, indomitable aura rose.

Long Chen was delighted. The essence blood stone had finally provoked the primal chaos bead’s power. Long Chen had never been clear on the primal chaos bead’s power, but he knew it was an extremely terrifying existence. He just didn’t know whether or not it could suppress the essence blood stone.

The essence blood stone’s light intensified. It seemed as if two formless powers were clashing.

Suddenly, an explosive sound rang out from within the primal chaos space, and a boundless pressure appeared. The primal chaos bead seemed to be enraged.

In front of that pressure, the essence blood stone went still. Its power seemed to have been suppressed and it began to float over. Long Chen was delighted.

Just as he thought that he would be able to smoothly obtain it, cracking sounds rang out. Tiny cracks appeared all over the essence blood stone.

Long Chen jumped and immediately stopped the primal chaos bead. When its suction came to a stop, the essence blood stone returned to its original location and appearance.

“Even in front of absolute power, it refuses to submit. It would rather break. Fine, it would be far too regretful to break such a divine treasure. Since it has no fate with me, I’ll leave it to others.” Long Chen sighed. Although he felt unwilling, he decided to give up.

The primal chaos bead had once more proven its power, but regretfully, he couldn’t control it. He couldn’t safely take the essence blood stone.

He had thought that all schemes were useless in front of absolute power. That principle received a blow now when he found that even with absolute power, he couldn’t take the essence blood stone.

“Fuck, is it really something requiring brains over brawn?” Long Chen was extremely unwilling to leave things just like this.

“Calm down. I can think of something.” Long Chen took a deep breath and sat to the side of the essence blood stone. The multicolored light continued to shine brightly. It formed a beautiful image with the essence blood stone at the core of the image. It was like a flower blooming.

Long Chen was staring at it silently when he suddenly shot up. “Could it be?!”

A bone tile appeared in Long Chen’s hand. There was also an image carved into it. Long Chen stared at it in disbelief.Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com
