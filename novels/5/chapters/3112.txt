Chapter 3101 Chu Gan

That person was shocked to find that heaven and earth had been split into three levels. Spacetime was severed, and time was no longer flowing normally. It felt as if he had provoked the entire world. In front of that power, he was as weak as an ant.

As for Long Chen and the others, what they saw was three giant spheres of light appearing on the martial stage. The place where those three spheres overlapped was precisely where that person was.

As the three spheres of light revolved, heaven and earth changed color, and space twisted chaotically. It was as if the world had folded on itself and was overlapping.

This bizarre sight caused countless expressions to change. They had never seen such a terrifying phenomenon before.

“What kind of magical art is that?”

“Spacetime is in chaos. Time is overlapping. This is absolutely terrifying.”

Everyone stared in shock. Bai Xiaole’s opponent seemed to be struggling, but his movements were strange in their eyes. Sometimes he would be moving fast, sometimes he would be moving slow, and sometimes multiple images of him would appear. He was like a fly caught in a spider web, and no matter how he struggled, he was unable to escape.

At this moment, Bai Xiaole’s hand seals were constantly changing, and the light in his eyes shone brightly. Meanwhile, the entire martial stage was shuddering. It began to crack, on the verge of collapse.

Suddenly, everything came to a pause as the space inside the three spheres froze. Bai Xiaole’s opponent was unable to even move now.

He was shocked. Before this, he had at least been able to struggle. But now, space was pressing down on him from all directions. Even blinking his eyes was difficult.

“Do you admit defeat? Blink twice and I’ll count it as giving up, then I’ll let you go,” said Bai Xiaole.

“Not good!”

As soon as he said this, everyone, including Bai Shishi, cried out.

Bai Xiaole’s opponent had clearly lost, and with great difficulty, he blinked twice. Seeing this, Bai Xiaole laughed and the three spheres of light slowly came undone. The spatial power faded.

“Die!” DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

Just as Bai Xiaole’s spatial energy loosened, that person roared furiously. Free from the bindings, he slashed his blade at Bai Xiaole’s head as quick as lightning.

Having not expected this person to go back on his word, Bai Xiaole had no time to dodge. Hence, a sensation of death filled him.

However, just as his opponent was about to kill him, the Three Flower Pupils that had just faded instantly condensed once more. A ray of black light then shot out, piercing that person’s head and killing him.

Bai Xiaole was bewildered. He didn’t even know what had just happened. His Three Flower Pupils had activated automatically.

Bai Xiaole was sent back out. After that, Qin Feng angrily rebuked him, “You fool, you actually had mercy on such a person?! If it wasn’t for boss, you’d be dead!”

At this time, three spheres of light slowly faded from within Long Chen’s eyes. Only then did Bai Xiaole and the others understand. Long Chen’s Three Flower Pupils were connected to Bai Xiaole’s, and it was Long Chen who had taken control of Bai Xiaole’s Three Flower Pupils at the last moment. This mysterious energy was actually able to work even through the formation.

Everyone was still covered in cold sweat from that last moment. It had truly been dangerous.

“I was wrong.” Bai Xiaole lowered his head.

What people didn’t expect was for the strict Long Chen to not criticize him. Instead, he patted him on the shoulder.

“Being wrong isn’t something to be afraid of, as long as you know where you were wrong and don’t make such a mistake again. Growth is the result of constantly making mistakes. When you make a mistake, you pay a price, and that’s what makes you learn the lesson. This isn’t your fault. You have always been in the academy with people protecting you, so you don’t know the wickedness of other people’s hearts. Remember, killing people sometimes isn’t the result of right or wrong, good or evil. It is simply because the other side wants to take your life, and if you want to live, you have to kill them. Unless of course, you are so good and kind that you are willing to give up your own life for your opponent. People do need to have kindness in their hearts, but that also depends on who the target is. A person like that has accumulated the resentment of who knows how many innocent souls. Your kindness toward him is foolishness.”

“Boss, I understand. I won’t be so foolish again,” said Bai Xiaole.

Long Chen had dragged him back from the border of death, letting him understand just how foolish his actions just now were. Within the guilt and shame, for the first time, Bai Xiaole encountered the wickedness of the hearts of people.

Long Chen nodded. Although Bai Xiaole had constantly been beaten as a child, his life had never been in danger. This lesson was definitely a good one for him.

The reason Long Chen dared to have Bai Xiaole attend the Martial Dao convention despite the latter’s lack of experience was because their Three Flower Pupils were connected. Hence, Long Chen had the ability to protect him.

Furthermore, he found that when he activated the Three Flower Pupils through Bai Xiaole, he was easily able to control his power. But when he used the Three Flower Pupils himself, it would draw out the power of the Purgatory Eyes. Why that was the case was something he had yet to comprehend. It was no problem for him to help Bai Xiaole, but using them himself caused a huge backlash.

Qin Feng also didn’t say anything else since Bai Xiaole had accepted his mistake. But the Dragonblood warriors were all straightforward men, and so he was unable to say any comforting words to Bai Xiaole. It was Luo Xue and the others who consoled Bai Xiaole, letting him feel a bit better.

Bai Xiaole had followed Qin Feng’s pointers at the start. The more afraid he was, the more he had to face his opponent directly. It was because the later battles would only be more intense, and there was no time to take things step by step. The face-slap was also suggested by Qin Feng.

Bai Xiaole had done very well, and Qin Feng’s vision was also very sharp. He had calculated that person’s character and knew that this person would be enraged if Bai Xiaole seemed to stall until they were both eliminated. The anger was enough distraction for Bai Xiaole to find a chance to activate the Three Flower Pupils.

Against ordinary experts, Bai Xiaole’s Three Flower Pupils were more than enough. But against peak experts, in a battle where the blink of an eye spelled death, he still didn’t have enough control over his Three Flower Pupils to lock down his opponents. That was why Qin Feng had told him that he had to create an opportunity for himself.

Even though there had been a mistake in the end, overall, Bai Xiaole had managed to overcome his fear of death in this battle. He had taken a huge step toward the ranks of peak experts.

Although he lacked experience, his Three Flower Pupils were truly powerful. He was entirely capable of standing shoulder to shoulder with Primals.

Next was young master Changchuan. His opponent was powerful, but after a few dozen exchanges, he was unable to even force young master Changchuan to use his manifestation. Hence, he directly admitted defeat.

Young master Changchuan still obtained victory easily. Next was Long Chen, and Luo Xue warned him to be careful.

Long Chen smiled. “I would be careful toward others, but I have no need to be careful against the Chu family’s people.”

Long Chen was sent into the martial stage. His opponent at least wasn’t as ugly as the last member from the Chu family. Gazing at Chu Gan disdainfully, Long Chen smiled. That smile was very evil, very sinister, and very chilling.
