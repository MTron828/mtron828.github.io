Chapter 2169 Obtaining the Heavenly Underworld Vermillion Fruit

“You’ve obtained it?” Long Chen got right to the point upon seeing Zheng Wenlong. He didn’t recall ever being so nervous in his life. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

“I didn’t fail your mission.”

Zheng Wenlong was also a bit emotional. He took out an elegant case and slowly opened it. Within it lay a fist-sized fruit.

The fruit was dark red and had star-like spots. Through its exterior, they were able to see countless streams of energy flowing within it, giving off a very dangerous feeling.

“Long Chen, you should check to see if this is the Heavenly Underworld Vermillion Fruit that you were talking about,” said Zheng Wenlong.

Even Zheng Wenlong with his years of handling all kinds of treasures felt that this Heavenly Underworld Vermillion Fruit was more like a poison that would take a person’s life.

“Yes, it’s the Heavenly Underworld Vermillion Fruit. Brother Wenlong, you really helped me out.” Even Long Chen’s voice trembled as he picked up the case.

Having obtained the Heavenly Underworld Vermillion Fruit, he could finally start condensing the Nethergate Star.

“Don’t thank me. It wasn’t cheap to obtain this Heavenly Underworld Vermillion Fruit. It was a trade for ten crystal cores from peak twelfth rank Magical Beasts. Those ten cores all contain dark energy. It’s most likely very beneficial to Tian Xiezi. I’m afraid he’ll be able to control the Corrupt God Ancient Tower even better, and you...”

Long Chen shook his head, completely uncaring. “Let him do as he pleases. As long as I have the Heavenly Underworld Vermillion Fruit, it’s enough.”

“Good. Is Mo Nian still here or has he left?” asked Zheng Wenlong.

“He just left. What is it?” asked Long Chen, surprised by the question.

“Ah, so I was too late. I was going to warn him to be careful. The Blood Emperor’s daughter, Xie Luocha, has sent out a death warrant for him. The entire world is looking for him now. Furthermore, he already has so many enemies just on his own. He might get exposed,” said Zheng Wenlong.

Long Chen suddenly recalled how the Blood Emperor had once been the overlord of the ancient family alliance. Could it be that the Blood Emperor was related to why the ancient family alliance had hunted down the Mo family for so long?

However, Mo Nian hadn’t mentioned it, so it wasn’t appropriate for Long Chen to ask.

Mo Nian had brushed over his fight with Xue Luocha and hadn’t gone into any detail. Long Chen didn’t know what he was thinking.

“He’s already left, but he should be fine. Do you know the story between Mo Gate and the ancient family alliance?” asked Long Chen.

Zheng Wenlong told him a story. The Mo family and the Di family were once loyal to the Blood Emperor. They had been the strongest pillars beneath the Blood Emperor.

Later on, the era of the Blood Emperor passed. His descendants were supposed to continue his position, but while a bloodline might sometimes be strong, it also could decline.

The Blood Emperor had been incredibly powerful, but of his descendants, Xue Luocha was the strongest. The rest only had an ordinary aptitude.

As a result, Xue Luocha had been sealed, waiting for the great era to come. But even the declined Xue family possessed immense influence.

They had continued their glory with the support of the Mo family and the Di family. Later on, the ancient family alliance was established, and the Xue family retreated behind the scenes, resulting in the Mo family and the Di family jointly managing the ancient family alliance.

At that time, the Mo family gave rise to two amazing brothers, one named Hao Xing and one named Hao Chen. Legend was that the two of them had created a paragon art based on the Mo family’s core techniques.

The two of them had risen like shooting stars, their light almost eclipsing that of the Blood Emperor from back in the day. The experts of that time acknowledged them as the two existences with the highest chance of becoming a Sovereign.

It was said that the paragon art the two brothers created was able to transform heaven and earth. If used to its maximum potential, they could peer into the secrets of the heavens.

For some reason, the two brothers of the Mo family vanished from this world. The Di family then had a falling out with the Mo family, joining hands with the other powers of the ancient family alliance to attack the Mo family.

It was said that even the Xue family participated in that attack. There were rumors that said that at that time, the brothers had reached a bottleneck and been unable to break through, resulting in them setting their sights on a relic of the Blood Emperor. But they were noticed, and so the Xue family allied with the Di family to destroy the Mo family for the transgression. The Mo family was fractured and beaten. Let alone restoring their past glory, they were hunted down by the ancient family alliance for many years.

“This is all hearsay though, or perhaps I should say it’s the information that the Di family has allowed out into the world. For the true reasons, you would have to ask the Mo family’s people,” said Zheng Wenlong.

Long Chen snorted. “The Mo family’s people wouldn’t do something like that. Even an idiot would be able to figure out that the Mo family’s sudden rise made the Xue family and the Di family afraid. The Xue family couldn’t produce any outstanding experts after the Blood Emperor and Xue Luocha. Unable to suppress the Mo family and being afraid of being replaced by them, they came up with such a ludicrous reason. Even their excuse was so bad that they couldn’t come up with any details. The cultivation world is just like this. If you want to attack, you can make up any garbage excuse.”

Long Chen sneered. Back in the Phoenix Cry Empire, there had been countless open fights and hidden schemes. But now, he found that their scheming was far superior to the cultivation world.

The cultivation world’s schemes weren’t even schemes. They were overt plots. Everyone knew that what was coming out of their mouths was lies, but they still believed them. If you were strong enough, then even the biggest lie in the world could become true. Even if there were countless holes, countless chances for people to question the story, people would rather believe the lie because doing so was profitable for them.

As a result, facts and truth weren’t important. What was important was profit. As long as there was profit, someone could be mute or deaf. That was already completely normal.

That was why when Long Chen heard any so-called history, he scoffed at it. History is written by the winners, and the winners write history that suits them. They were usually praising themselves, and many times, the reality was far from what they wrote.

“No wonder Mo Nian doesn’t mention this. When the hatred reaches this level, there’s no point talking about it,” said Long Chen.

Although Mo Nian always acted silly, he was carrying a much heavier burden than others. That made him similar to Long Chen. Both of them couldn’t be bothered to argue with others.

Long Chen suddenly thought of the two figures that were in Mo Nian’s manifestation. Were those two figures related to those two powerful experts from the Mo family?

“Long Chen, the large powers have started making moves. The Corrupt path is invading the Righteous path. The ancient races, the Xuan Beasts, the Bloodkill Hall, the ancient family alliance, they’ve all participated as well. The Righteous path is now very stable, and this is all according to Pill Valley’s usual plot. They’ll sway public opinion and many people will point out that the source of all these attacks is you. You should be prepared for this,” warned Zheng Wenlong. After fighting with Pill Valley for so many years, he was very familiar with their moves.

In truth, this move of Pill Valley’s was very amazing, and even if it was used a hundred or even a thousand times, they couldn’t counter it.

Every sect had a very complicated interior. When Long Chen was in the Eastern Wasteland’s branch Dao Sect, there were four families managing it equally. The four families had constant conflicts. After all, every person had their own views and opinions. They couldn’t possibly agree all the time.

Pill Valley’s hands had long since stretched into the Righteous path’s sects. Qu Jianying had been in seclusion for too long, and when she came out, Pill Valley’s infiltration had almost reached the bone.

Long Chen had seen this all very clearly. The Martial Heaven Alliance was like a badly sick person. A simple cure did not exist. To recover, the only way was to cut out the corrupted flesh. That was the only way to remove the toxins. However, Qu Jianying had always been hesitant to do this, and Pill Valley noticed that, making the giant existence which was the Martial Heaven Alliance into a tottering old person.

“Yes, I’m already prepared. I’m not an evil person, but I’m not a good person either. If someone raises their blade against me to take my life, I won’t care if they’re being fooled, or if they’ve done good things in the past. I’ll still kill them mercilessly. It doesn’t matter who they are or why they’re attacking. What matters is that I want to live. So I have no way of fighting shoulder to shoulder with the Martial Heaven Alliance,” said Long Chen somewhat helplessly.

“That’s a consequence of a person with no beliefs. With no morals or restrictions for themselves, they might do anything. Even Magical Beasts have a bottom line and know what respect and gratitude are. But those people will only be grateful or respectful for a while. It’s very difficult for them to maintain it for any length of time. That’s why people are the most frightening rather than Magical Beasts,” said Zheng Wenlong.

Zheng Wenlong took out two more precious medicinal ingredients and a few spatial rings filled with things that Long Chen had asked for.

With Long Chen’s help, the Martial Heaven Continent’s top resources had been gathered in the Huayun Sect and were now slowly circulating. The resources that Long Chen had supplied were forcibly lifting up Zheng Wenlong’s development.

Zheng Wenlong said a few more words before leaving. He was currently extremely busy. As the high grade market developed in the Huayun Sect, the Dongfang family’s business plummeted. Although the Dongfang family did have a powerful foundation, they didn’t have as much variety in their treasures as the Huayun Sect.

Furthermore, the crystal cores of peak twelfth rank Magical Beasts that Long Chen had brought back were shaking the continent. Those crystal cores had a variety of uses and had immediately drawn people over.

Other than that, top grade eleventh tier pills had started to be sold by the Huayun Sect. Pill Valley had them but so did the Huayun Sect. Moreover, the pills sold by Huayun Sect had a fairer price and could be directly traded with no conditions. Even those sects with good relationships with Pill Valley were secretly doing business with the Huayun Sect.

One thing that the Huayun Sect did that was very favorable to them was that they kept the business of their clients confidential. It didn’t matter what sect or power was doing business with the Huayun Sect, they all had secrets, but the Huayun Sect would never expose them unless they had permission from their clients.

That was why the Huayun Sect had always been the most honest business on the continent. People never questioned their integrity.

Once Zheng Wenlong left, Long Chen walked over to the seclusion area.
