Chapter 4520 Absorbing Blood, Awakening Spirituality

“Get over here!” barked the Saint in a stern tone as he walked away from the medicinal field.

The Eternal experts immediately trembled, regretting their earlier laughter. What had been a collective sigh of relief had turned into a provocation, as the Saint had heard it.

Too fearful to lift their heads, these Eternal experts kept their mouths shut, fixating their gaze on their own footsteps as they walked out of the medicinal field.

All of them were on edge. With many years of experience working in this region, they were profoundly aware of the Saint’s volatile temper. Perhaps one of them would meet an unfortunate end here, and their fate would be up to luck now.

As soon as they left the medicinal field, a blood-colored saber slashed through the air, beheading them all.

The Saint was, in fact, Long Chen in disguise. If they had looked at him more closely, they would have easily noticed the imperfections in his disguise.

However, their fear rendered them unable to look at Long Chen directly. Exploiting this psychological pressure, Long Chen successfully played his gamble against them, and it really worked.

Long Chen had a specific reason for luring them out of the medicinal field before attacking. If a fight had broken out, they would have ruined the medicinal field. Also, even if they didn’t resist, just the smell of their blood could harm many of the delicate plants here. If the latter were badly startled, some of them could even die.

Buzz.

In the end, Long Chen’s plan didn’t unfold as he intended. As he slew the Eternal experts, the saber in his hand suddenly radiated a brilliant light, exuding a ferocious aura.

“Not good!”

Long Chen’s expression changed. He hadn’t expected the saber to directly absorb the blood soul power of the slain Eternal experts.

This ferocious weapon seemed like a bloodthirsty fiend awoken from slumber. It actually achieved spiritual awakening at this moment.

The primary issue wasn’t the weapon attaining spiritual awakening; rather, it was the sudden eruption of its aura in every direction.

Long Chen let out a startled cry and hastily charged into the medicinal field. He had thought that he would be able to calmly gather the plants, but the disturbance had undoubtedly alarmed the surrounding experts.

Long Chen panicked. If he had known this would happen, he wouldn’t have used this saber. These medicinal ingredients were all extremely precious, and he had to gather them carefully. Long Chen also needed to study the methods of harvesting some of them without causing any damage, as some would perish instantly if touched incorrectly.

This medicinal field housed the highest-tier ingredients, including the ones comparable to the Thousand Leaf Sacred Light Snow Lotus and the Jade Bone Violet Heart Bamboo. Collecting them required meticulous care, as if they died in the outside world, the primal chaos space wouldn’t necessarily be able to revive them.

However, Long Chen had no other means now. He could only seize as many as possible, risking the possibility of damaging the entire medicinal field due to time constraints. The thought of such destruction caused his heart to drip with blood.

“Don’t move! You’ll damage it!” Just as Long Chen was about to grab one Saint medicinal plant, the Earth Cauldron’s voice rang out. “Leave this to me!”

Long Chen was taken aback. The Earth Cauldron suddenly appeared and cast forth a gentle sacred light that enveloped the entire medicinal field.

“Go block that Saint! Buy some time for me!” commanded the Earth Cauldron.

Long Chen then sensed a terrifying aura and rushed toward it.

“You brazen thief! You must be tired of living since you’ve come to my territory!” Countless alarms blared, accompanied by a resounding roar from above. It was the Saint who had spent two hours chiding the others.

“Hey, don’t misunderstand! I’m on your side!” cried out Long Chen.

The Saint paused for the briefest of moments before detecting that Long Chen’s aura was completely amiss. “Invader! Who do you think you’re trying to trick? Speak, who are you!?”

“You don’t recognize me? I’m your daddy!” Long Chen stared at the Saint in disbelief.

“Die!” the Saint roared furiously. Suspicious of the situation, he had extended his divine sense while speaking. Discovering that Long Chen was alone yet still dared to jest, he was infuriated.

The Saint’s hand reached toward Long Chen, causing space to twist. An enormous hand then appeared in front of Long Chen.

The Saint was enraged, but he refrained from using his full power. He wanted to capture Long Chen alive and save the medicinal field at the same time. After all, If the medicinal field was ruined, not even he would survive.

“Split the Heavens 1!”

Long Chen raised the blood-colored saber. After that, specks of starlight covered the blade, and a howling saber wind erupted.

BOOM!

The hand was cut in two, while the saber wind continued to strike the elder’s actual palm.

Due to the impact, the elder grunted and fell back, blood spraying out of his half-destroyed hand.

“It really is different when you have a good weapon!”

Long Chen was startled by this result as well. He wasn’t in his full power state and had simply used the energy of the star sea in his Dantian. However, this simple attack was enough to injure a Saint.

Although Long Chen knew that the Saint hadn’t used his full power either, Long Chen realized that he could now fight a Saint on equal footing. Most importantly, when his astral energy entered the saber, he experienced a sensation akin to a raging flood finally finding an outlet. Even his Split the Heavens had changed.

Previously, without a decent weapon, Long Chen had to diffuse the power of Split the Heavens throughout the entire saber. It was actually more like smashing than slashing.

Now, armed with a strong weapon, Long Chen could channel his power to the edge of the blade. Even with the same amount of energy, the destructive might was many times greater.

“Hey, stop! I’m telling the truth! I’m really your daddy!” After taking the upper hand, Long Chen didn’t immediately charge over. Instead, he waved his hands frantically.

“Wait... you... Where did you get that weapon?!” exclaimed the Saint. His expression completely changed when he looked more closely at Long Chen’s saber.

Hearing that, Long Chen immediately replied, “I’m from the Asura race. I was given the mission of coming for what you forged for-”

“Bullshit! Die!”

The Saint stamped on the air, and countless afterimages of him appeared throughout heaven and earth.

BOOM!

Suddenly, a fist appeared behind Long Chen. Seeing this, he snorted and raised his saber to block it.

Sparks erupted as Long Chen recoiled and propelled backward. As he glanced back at the fist, his pupils contracted ever so slightly.
