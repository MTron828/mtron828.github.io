Long Chen’s heart shook. A middle-aged man in Daoist robes had appeared, holding a translucent sword.

“Things can end here today. I, Ji Wuming, admit defeat. Ending our hostilities here will benefit everyone!” That middle-aged man spoke coldly to Long Chen. He was actually able to ignore the heavenly tribulation.

The appearance of this middle-aged man startled people. Just who was he?

“So the Unfettered Allseer was actually just the deputy island master. He’s the real master,” said Li Tianxuan with surprise.

Heavenly Fate Island’s Fate Princes were the only ones qualified to inherit the position of island master. Each Fate Prince had a deputy. One stayed inside, while one handled the outside affairs.

It was the deputies who handled the business of Heavenly Fate Island and the outside world, while the true princes focused entirely on cultivation. They rarely set foot out of Heavenly Fate Island for their entire lives.

As for this middle-aged man, he had launched a powerful attack that had almost killed Long Chen, and yet he still hadn’t been sensed by the tribulation. That was extremely strange.

This person possessed a bizarre aura, one that people found difficult to get a clear reading of. As for his weapon, it wasn’t Heavenly Fate Island’s classic ruler but a translucent sword. There were countless stars flickering within the sword. It was like the flow of the cosmos was contained within it. Looking at it would make someone feel like their mind was being drawn in.

“That’s Heavenly Fate Island’s core divine item, the Fantasy Star Sword. Yes, he has to be the real island master,” said Qu Jianying gravely.

Ji Wuming was staring coldly at Long Chen. Long Chen felt a strange but sharp aura lock onto him even through the tribulation.

Long Chen sneered, “Ending our hostilities here? Are you talking nonsense with me? I never provoked Heavenly Fate Island. It was Heavenly Fate Island who went against me time and time again, even using despicable means against the people beside me. Isn’t this current scene exactly what you wanted? And now you want to end things and you think you can scare me with a sword? Let me tell you, there is nothing that I, Long Chen, don’t dare to do!” Long Chen suddenly threw his lightning spear at the divine pool below him without any hesitation.

“Courting death!” Ji Wuming was enraged, and a sharp Sword Qi slashed out. At that moment, everyone clearly saw the stars flow within his sword, and a strange light tore through the void.

BOOM!

Long Chen’s lightning spear exploded, but Long Chen seemed to have expected that. Following his spear were his lightning wings.

Ji Wuming followed up with another slash of his sword, shattering Long Chen’s lightning wings through space.

However, he wasn’t the slightest bit happy after blocking Long Chen’s two attacks. Instead, killing intent surged within him. It was only at this moment that he saw a lightning dragon charge into the divine pool. It exploded, causing the divine pool to crumble.

“Long Chen, I, Ji Wuming, swear that I will kill you!” Ji Wuming’s face twisted. The destruction of the divine pool signified that the root of their karmic luck was gone. Heavenly Fate Island really would vanish from this world.

A layer of mist covered Ji Wuming’s sword, and its brilliance rapidly dimmed. Clearly, the Fantasy Star Sword was linked to Heavenly Fate Island’s karmic luck, and it was now damaged.

As it dimmed, the clouds in the sky shook and immense pressure crashed down. Ji Wuming had no choice but to retreat. He vanished.

Once Ji Wuming was gone, the tribulation returned to its normal state. At this time, people understood that the reason Ji Wuming was able to remain unnoticed by the Heavenly Daos was mostly because of the Fantasy Star Sword. With its power dropping, the tribulation had finally sensed him.

Ji Wuming reappeared beside the Unfettered Allseer. Both of their expressions were unsightly. They looked like they were already dead as Heavenly Fate Island had been destroyed.

Even if its name could persist, it would just be a place, not a sect. If any sect tried to establish itself under the name of Heavenly Fate Island, they would not receive the recognition of the Heavenly Daos. Without the world’s karmic luck, they would be like rootless duckweeds. They would blow away with the slightest breeze.

“He... he really did it. How ruthless!”

The people from Pill Valley, the ancient races, the Corrupt path, the Xuan Beasts, the ancient family alliance, the Bloodkill Hall, and the others all felt their hearts pounding wildly. Long Chen had actually caused the destruction of a sect with countless years of history.

Heavenly Fate Island’s disciples were crying. Their inheritance had been destroyed. They would be people without a home in the future.

“Long Chen, I swear I will make you regret your actions today! I’ll make you live a life worse than death!” roared Ji Wuming.

“Work hard, youngster. I, Long Chen, will await you.” Long Chen snorted. His lightning wings reappeared. At the same time, he put away the lightning channel behind him. The nine lightning drakes vanished, and Lei Long also returned to him. A torrent of lightning beasts now charged toward him. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

What was he doing? Everyone was startled by this. This was the crucial moment of the tribulation. Why was he pulling back everything?

“I’ve fulfilled my first promise. Starting today, the Martial Heaven Continent will no longer have a Heavenly Fate Island. This floating island is now a masterless object. Now I’ll fulfill my second promise. True Immortal Jiaoqi, do you still remember what I said?”

Long Chen waved his lightning spear, forcing back the beasts.

“I told you not to do anything stupid, but you still did it. So you’ve won. Congratulations, you’ve managed to fully infuriate me. Now I’ll send you a gift. Prepare yourself for it!”

Long Chen suddenly flew away at top speed. Seeing the direction he was going, the Xuan Beasts’ leader, Peng Wanli, shouted, “Alert our people to scatter!”

He found that the direction in which Long Chen was going was the headquarters of the Xuan Beasts. If he still didn’t understand what Long Chen was planning now, he would really be an idiot.

The tribulation followed Long Chen, and the giant lightning gate stayed above his head the entire time. Everywhere he traveled was turned into ruined land. It seemed that the tribulation wouldn’t rest until Long Chen was dead.

True Immortal Jiaoqi was dumbfounded. Peng Wanli roared, “I told you to send a message! Are you deaf?!”

“Yes, yes, I’ll do it right away!” True Immortal Jiaoqi vaguely started to feel like he had caused a calamity. He sent a message, but in truth, the other experts of the Xuan Beasts had already sent the warnings back.

“Quick!”

Peng Wanli transformed into the body of a giant Kunpeng. He instantly vanished, hoping to be able to bring as many experts over as possible before Long Chen arrived.

At the same time, he prayed that Long Chen’s lightning tribulation would end soon, hopefully, before he even arrived at the Xuan Beasts’ headquarters.

Peng Wanli was the first to move, and True Immortal Jiaoqi followed with his Qilin War Chariot. Yu Xiaoyun, Xie Wentian, Di Long, Zhong Ziyang, Long Juncang, the Unfettered Allseer, Ji Wuming, and the others were in hot pursuit.

“We should go too. That True Immortal Jiaoqi really is a genius. Long Chen was only going to use his tribulation to destroy Heavenly Fate Island, but he managed to change Long Chen’s mind. That ability is admirable.” Qu Jianying looked at the ruined Heavenly Fate Island.

Countless experts began to chase Long Chen. They couldn’t see him, but even from a great distance, they could see the lightning gate. They definitely wouldn’t get lost.

Long Chen flew for an hour. Because he didn’t kill any lightning beasts during this time, more and more of them were filling the sky.

Eventually, he saw his target and smiled. Countless experts with bows in hand were waiting for him. He had reached the territory of the Xuan Beasts.

A hail of arrows tore through the air. As these arrows were made with the materials of divine items, even Netherpassage experts would be heavily injured if struck.

Long Chen merely snorted, and he slashed Evilmoon. As a result, those arrows were blown apart, but Long Chen was forced back by their immense power. After all, there had been hundreds of divine arrows. That was enough to kill a Netherpassage expert of the second step.

Long Chen’s body suddenly shook. He transformed into eighteen Long Chens that flew in every direction.

The Xuan Beasts were stunned by this sudden change. For a moment, they were unable to tell which one was the true body and which ones were lightning fakes.

With no time, they began shooting arrows. The fake Long Chen’s exploded one by one, until finally, Evilmoon appeared, blowing apart the nearby arrows, exposing who the real one was.

“We’ve found the real one!”

The Xuan Beasts shouted, but their expressions suddenly changed. Due to focusing entirely on Long Chen, they had forgotten about the tribulation.

“Run!”

However, it was too late. Lightning swords rained down from the sky, blowing them apart.

Those experts were only at the peak of Life Star. The reason that they were so strong was entirely due to their special bows and arrows. Clearly, they were just cannon fodder the Xuan Beasts had called to slow Long Chen down.

Long Chen continued past them, spotting a giant stone mountain. There were many caves throughout this mountain. This was the Xuan Beasts’ headquarters.

The Xuan Beasts didn’t understand how to build things. Punching open caves was their forte.

“Today, I’ll destroy your bastard lair.”
