Chapter 2616 Original Devil Race Comes Out

The High Priest smiled. “Without the original devil race, it will be difficult to guard Devil Spirit Mountain.”

Only now did Long Chen learn that his relationship with the original devil race had long since been known by the High Priest.

“But the original devil race…”

“The original devil race is called a devil race, is called the enemy of the Martial Heaven Continent, is called a curse upon this world. However, the laws of the Heavenly Daos are now in chaos and can no longer reject them. As long as they open the channel to their world, they will be able to fight at full power on the Martial Heaven Continent,” said the High Priest.

“But the Martial Heaven Continent will not accept them,” said Long Chen. He did not have confidence in this.

“Why do you need to care? Who said that just because the Martial Heaven Continent rejects them, they are enemies? The Heavenly Daos are no longer the original Heavenly Daos. They no longer represent the will of the Martial Heaven Continent. As the people are ignorant and only hear what they want to hear, how could they possibly know the truth about the original devil race? Without their support, you will face unprecedented pressure from Devil Spirit Mountain, and you won’t have the power to block the other regions. Moreover, this is the only chance for the original devil race to prove themselves. As for the divine families, remember, the goal is only to profit from them. As long as you do it at the right time, we will be the one to profit the most in the end,” said the High Priest.

Long Chen was startled. The High Priest touched upon something that Sovereign Zi Yang had mentioned to him as well. That was that the current Heavenly Daos were no longer the will of the Martial Heaven Continent.

In other words, every time he underwent heavenly punishment, it was the Heavenly Daos that wanted to kill him, not the Martial Heaven Continent. The two were not the same.

Now that the High Priest was also bringing it up, Long Chen understood. Could it be that the Martial Heaven Continent was no longer under its own control?

The gamebreaker?

A bolt of lightning suddenly crashed through Long Chen’s mind, and many things that he hadn’t understood instantly became clear. If this board included the Martial Heaven Continent, then he could understand what the Sovereigns had been trying to say.

Seeing his expression, the High Priest smiled. “Do what you have to do. No one can see the future. As long as you work hard, trust that time will bring you what you need.”

“Many thanks, senior.” Long Chen felt as if many riddles had been undone in that instant, and he saw a clear path. The five Sovereigns had placed their hopes on him, and he had the Wine God Palace, the Divine Ice Palace, the Illusive Music Immortal Palace, and the Martial Heaven Continent’s millions and millions of experts supporting him.

However, Long Chen didn’t reply. Whether or not the original devil race would come out into the world would be up to them.

After all, they had been hunted down generation after generation by the Martial Heaven Continent’s experts. They had been on the verge of destruction. Ordinary people would not be able to accept helping people who had done such things to them.

Using their own lives to protect their enemies? If it was Long Chen, he would be incapable of it. That was why he had to go ask the original devil race their opinion first.

…

“Long Chen!”

When Long Chen returned to the original devil race, the first thing he saw was Yue Xiaoqian. She was pacing in front of the transportation formation and was immediately delighted to see him.

Yue Xiaoqian’s beauty was the same as before, but she had become thinner. That appearance was a bit distressing. When Long Chen saw her, he instantly understood her feelings.

She was struggling, hesitating as to whether or not she should go find him on the Martial Heaven Continent. She wanted to see him, but she didn’t want to bring him trouble.

Long Chen hadn’t realized just how important of a spot he held in Yue Xiaoqian’s heart. After such a long time apart, Yue Xiaoqian had endured a great deal of suffering.

“Xiaoqian, you’ve gotten thinner.” Long Chen rubbed her cheek sadly. She had been working hard this entire time.

“I’m fine…” Even though that was what she said, she couldn’t hold back a few tears. Although she was smiling at seeing him, her emotions overwhelmed her.

During this time, Long Chen had not sent back any word to her, worrying her immensely. She had wanted to go to the Martial Heaven Continent, but her mother, Yue Xihan, prevented her. If her status was exposed, it would implicate Long Chen as well, turning him into the public enemy of the world.

However, the fact that Long Chen hadn’t sent any word at all meant that he was also in a difficult position. Because of this, she was endlessly tormented by her inability to help.

Today, she had finally been unable to endure any longer. She had snuck out, wanting to go to the Martial Heaven Continent. But once she arrived in front of the transportation formation, she hesitated again.

Therefore, when Long Chen suddenly appeared, it felt like she was dreaming. She couldn’t hold back and silently cried into his chest.

Long Chen’s nose soured. Just how had he gained so many beautiful fairies that were willing to do everything for him? But as for him, he wasn’t even able to accompany them. Long Chen cursed himself.

All he could do was hold Yue Xiaoqian tightly, his heart full of shame and guilt. He just wanted to live a peaceful life, but the heavens would not allow it.

After crying for a while, it seemed that Yue Xiaoqian had managed to vent all the grief in her heart. She slowly pulled out of Long Chen’s embrace and saw that Long Chen’s chest was soaked in her tears. She then blushed and pressed a hand there. In a second, water vapor steamed out of his clothes as she dried her tears.

“I didn’t expect that you could even steam my clothes. You truly are a perfect wife.” Long Chen smiled.

Yue Xiaoqian’s blush deepened, and she lightly hit Long Chen. However, her eyes were filled with warmth. “I never said that I would marry you.”

“If you don’t marry me, who will you marry? Does someone else dare to touch my wife?” Long Chen patted his chest, suddenly becoming fierce.

His teasing made Yue Xiaoqian laugh, and she suddenly recalled something. “Long Chen, why have you suddenly come here?”

“I came to propose marriage to your mother,” said Long Chen solemnly.

“Stop messing around. Be serious,” rebuked Yue Xiaoqian.

“I am serious. Yes, I would like to propose that the original devil race returns to the Martial Heaven Continent,” said Long Chen.

Hearing that it was something so important, Yue Xiaoqian quickly dragged Long Chen over to see Yue Xihan.

Long Chen explained the High Priest’s thoughts. “Race leader, I’m only here to ask your opinion. The original devil race can accept or decline. No matter what, it will not change our relationship. You should understand what I’m saying.”

Long Chen was a bit apprehensive. This was definitely something difficult for the original devil race to accept. But since the High Priest had mentioned it, Long Chen chose to make the trip.

Unexpectedly to Long Chen, Yue Xihan was not angry at all. “Child, why are you so nervous? Is there a need to be so cautious when it comes to us? In truth, the Wine God Palace’s High Priest is a good person. Perhaps he knows some of the original devil race’s secrets. Entering the Martial Heaven Continent is a rare opportunity for us because both the Skyscraping World and the Wild World are minor worlds with incomplete laws. Only on the Martial Heaven Continent can the original devil race fully awaken our primordial bloodline. Moreover, killing the devil race that comes out will speed up the process, so this is an opportunity for us.” Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

“There’s such a thing?” Long Chen was surprised.

Yue Xihan nodded. “The Martial Heaven Continent suppressed us with its laws, preventing us from cultivating there before. But as the auras of the other worlds enter, its laws grow chaotic and can no longer suppress us. If we open the gate to the Skyscraping World, the original devil race’s qi will also enter the continent. Our power will fully recover.”

“So you’re saying that you accept it?” Long Chen was pleasantly surprised.

Yue Xihan smiled. “You are the nine star heir. The original devil race will follow you to death, let alone something that benefits us so much. We will support you no matter what.”

Long Chen was extremely moved. This was absolute trust.

“Alright, then I’m confident. I didn’t directly say yes to the High Priest.” Long Chen returned to the Martial Heaven Continent. But this time, he brought Yue Xiaoqian.

Long Chen then told the High Priest about the original devil race’s reply. However, he said that if anyone on the Martial Heaven Continent dared to make things hard on the original devil race, even if it was the divine families, he would immediately become enemies with them.

The High Priest seemed to have long since expected such a reply, so he sent a letter to the divine families.

The divine families quickly replied, saying that if the High Priest dared to vouch that the original devil race would not harm the Martial Heaven Continent, then they could work together. The divine families clearly stated that they would not oppose the original devil race.

A piece of news quickly spread throughout the Martial Heaven Continent. The original devil race was returning.

The original devil race was not full of demons and devils like they thought. They were allies who would help the continent defend against the invaders. This new information caused quite a great deal of chaos.

The original devil race was the Martial Heaven Continent’s mortal enemy, and this was something well known to all. Now they were helping to defend the continent? Was this not letting a wolf inside?

At this moment, the Wine God Palace, Divine Ice Palace, Illusive Music Immortal Palace, Martial Heaven Alliance, and other forces’ experts all gathered in front of the gate to the Skyscraping World.

After that, the void exploded, revealing a giant gate in the sky. As the gate slowly opened, the original devil race’s experts appeared before the Martial Heaven Continent’s experts.
