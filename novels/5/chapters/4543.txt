Chapter 4532 Am I Panicking?

After the blood-colored saber absorbed the desolate beast’s essence blood, it behaved like a starving wild beast that had finally obtained a bite of meat. Its aura intensified, becoming even more bloodthirsty.

The saber’s reaction after slaying the Saint-level desolate beast surpassed its reaction after killing that previous Saint.

Looking at the desiccated corpse, Long Chen was stunned. This Saint weapon of the Asura race was truly terrifying.

Just then, a ray of divine light shot over, and a powerful aura shook Long Chen. Another Saint-level desolate beast was attacking Long Chen with its full power. If he wanted to block it head-on, he would have to use his full power. However, he didn’t want to expose himself yet.

The next moment, Long Chen dove into the spotted tiger’s mouth again, and that attack struck the spotted tiger’s corpse, causing it to flip through the air, but Long Chen was safe.

“This corpse really isn’t ordinary!” exclaimed Long Chen as he came out of its mouth. Since the tiger’s corpse could withstand the blow of a Saint, it had to be even stronger than an average Saint when it was alive.

Unfortunately, the blood-colored saber had stabbed it somewhere vulnerable, leaving it unable to unleash any of its impressive power before it died. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

After coming out, Long Chen put its corpse away and turned toward the beast that had just attacked him. From this simple test, he had a general understanding of this desolate beast’s power. He was certain that even without unleashing his full power, he could fight it.

“Brother Long, don’t panic! We will assist you!”

Just then, two of the mixed beast race’s junior experts came charging over and immediately attacked the horned eagle that had attacked Long Chen, forcing it back.

“Am I panicking?” Long Chen almost laughed. How did they come to that conclusion?

However, their immediate assistance when they saw him in danger showed that they already considered him an ally, which moved Long Chen quite a bit.

When Long Chen thought about it, he knew it wasn’t a simple thing for them to risk their lives to save him. After all, other races often perceived the mixed beast race as mutants, so it must be hard for them to trust others.

However, those two experts might have been talking a bit too big for their britches. After a brief advantage, they quickly started to be suppressed by that horned eagle.

Suddenly, a golden-colored streak of light shot through the air, and the horned eagle let out a mournful bird cry. One of those two experts had stabbed its eye with his spear, piercing deep into its head. It then quivered a few times and fell from the sky.

“It died?”

After killing that Saint-level existence, this expert looked at his own hands in disbelief.

“Look at its butt!” shouted the other expert while pointing at it.

They saw a giant shining arrow stuck to the area below its stomach, so they hastily looked toward Long Chen.

As expected, a giant golden crossbow had appeared in Long Chen’s hands at some point. The arrow it held measured several meters in length, and Long Chen had fired it.

“Damn, Guo Ran’s wares really are top grade. Even the trash he’s discarded is still badass.” Long Chen nodded in admiration.

This was a gift from Guo Ran to Long Chen. Having obtained many Saint-level materials, Guo Ran had upgraded his own equipment, adding an even more terrifying crossbow for himself. However, unwilling to simply throw away his old crossbow, he gave it to Long Chen.

Considering its weight and power, not many people could effectively wield this crossbow. All of those capable of lifting it were specialists in close-range combat, and even if Guo Ran were to give it to them, they wouldn’t be able to use it.

Thus, Guo Ran entrusted the crossbow to Long Chen, knowing that he could use all kinds of weapons. At first, Long Chen didn’t really care about it. He just didn’t dare to reject the gift, considering that Guo Ran considered it as a treasure. To Long Chen’s surprise however, the crossbow wielded such a formidable impact once he started using it.

The golden exploding arrow instantly detonated after piercing its target. In truth, if it had simply struck it, the arrow would have been unable to pierce its defenses, but Long Chen was quite shameless, and his target was the channel from which the horned eagle expelled waste.

There were no defenses to speak of there. Furthermore, the eagle had been focusing on the two of them, and it hadn’t expected someone to launch a sneak attack there

. As a result, one attack was all it took to blast its ass off.

When this exploding arrow detonated, the intense pain rendered the eagle immobile, resulting in it being slain in one move.

“Brother Long, did you do this?” asked one of them in surprise and delight.

“Shh...” Long Chen gestured to be quiet. “Keep drawing the attention of the Saint-level desolate beasts. Let’s work together.”

“Alright!”

Feeling delighted, the two of them charged out. At the same time, Long Chen climbed onto the back of a half-horse half-man expert of the mixed beast race.

“Brother, can we work together? You can be in charge of running, and I’ll be in charge of shooting,” asked Long Chen politely.

“Working together is no problem, but first...you have to open your eyes. I’m not your brother. I’m your big sis,” replied that half-horse expert.

“Oh! Sorry!”

Only then did Long Chen realize that she was a woman. He had misjudged her because of her tall and muscular build, along with her suntanned face.

The half-horse half-woman warrior’s hooves produced ripples as she ran through the void. Remarkably fast and capable of swift turns, she exhibited exceptional agility. Others struggled to keep up with her as she rushed to assist wherever trouble arose. Long Chen had chosen her precisely because he had noticed this point.

“Steady!” shouted Long Chen suddenly. Hearing this, she immediately lowered her speed and did her best to stabilize herself, giving Long Chen the optimal condition to shoot.

Long Chen’s golden crossbow then quivered, and another golden arrow shot out, accurately piercing another desolate beast right where it hurt. That desolate beast let out a shriek before being slain by the mixed beast race experts.

It appeared that the experts from the mixed beast race or the desolate beast race had never encountered a crossbow before, let alone someone who would attack them so shamelessly. Now, the mixed beast race’s side was delighted, while the desolate beast race’s side started to panic.

They still hadn’t noticed Long Chen—a tiny target in this chaotic battlefield.

Toward the end, Long Chen adjusted his shooting technique and used shadowless arrows. Although their killing power was not as great, they moved without making a sound during both the shot and flight. This quality made them even more effective at catching people off-guard.

In less than the time it took for an incense stick to burn. The desolate beast race had lost over ten Saints and hundreds of their top experts, so they started to sense something off. After that, the two golden monkeys suddenly let out a burst of squeaks, commanding countless golden monkeys to charge toward Long Chen.

“Have I been noticed?” Long Chen was startled.
