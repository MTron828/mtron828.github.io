Chapter 4449 Not Just This Little Bit

The giant vortex in the sky—Netherdragon Tianzhao’s manifestation—had engulfed the entire world, yet above it, countless stars twinkled in the firmament. It was as if the onlookers had been transported to a fantasy land. The stars above the nine heavens were projected within the starry sea behind Long Chen, and starlight also radiated around him.

With his Heavenly Doyen rune and manifestation of heaven and earth, Netherdragon Tianzhao had unleashed an awe-inspiring power. However, as Long Chen summoned his starry sea manifestation, the pressure it emanated was no less formidable than that of Netherdragon Tianzhao’s manifestation.

Seeing the unfolding scene, everyone was taken aback. These two were monsters. Their dragon blood power constituted only a fraction of their overall might. Once depleted, they seamlessly transitioned to another form of power.

“Retreat!”

At this moment, Feng Fei gave a sudden order.

“What? Why?” asked the budding Doyen of the Jiang clan.

“Are you stupid?! Do you not see the Dragonblood Legion running?!” cursed Feng Fei as she couldn’t hold back any longer.

This fellow just had to constantly argue with her. No matter what she said, he argued without a good reason.

Having reached her limits, she no longer cared about her status, showing that she was already consumed by fury. If this fool weren’t a prodigy of the Jiang clan, she might genuinely have the urge to kill him.

Feng Fei’s sudden surge of killing intent directly made that budding Doyen jump in fright. Even with his dumbass brain, he realized that Feng Fei was truly angry. She felt like if she didn’t kill this idiot, she’d die of rage.

The moment Long Chen summoned his starry manifestation, the Dragonblood Legion silently retreated. However, this idiot was still foolishly asking “why?”. Did he have crap inside his head instead of brains?

“Stop wasting time! If you’re told to retreat, then retreat!” shouted Jiang Wenyu coldly.

The budding Doyen cowered instantly, realizing that Jiang Wenyu didn’t support his actions. Without uttering another word, he fell back.

However, the majority of people’s focus remained on Long Chen and Netherdragon Tianzhao, so they failed to notice that both the Dragonblood Legion and the Jiang clan had started retreating. They were still standing in their original location, stunned by these manifestations.

“I heard that you cultivate the Starry River of the Sky Art, and you even managed to merge it with a fragment of the Seven Supreme Yang Technique, walking your own path. You really do have some talent. However, do you think this is enough to fight a Heavenly Doyen?” Netherdragon Tianzhao looked at Long Chen indifferently.

Netherdragon Tianzhao had investigated Long Chen beforehand, which showed just how highly he held Long Chen. While many were aware of Long Chen’s association with the Starry River of the Sky Sect, only a few knew of Long Chen’s mastery of the Seven Supreme Yang Technique. This suggested that the intelligence network of the nether dragon race was quite formidable, possibly due to the presence of traitorous humans within.

“What I have is not just this little bit,” responded Long Chen just as indifferently.

“The Starry River of the Sky Art can draw out the astral energy of the nine heavens. However, how will you use astral energy when my Doyen manifestation covers the nine heavens?” inquired Netherdragon Tianzhao.

Everyone was startled. If this Heavenly Dao vortex covered the nine heavens and blocked the astral light, Long Chen would be severed from his source of energy. That meant that Netherdragon Tianzhao’s manifestation perfectly countered Long Chen’s.

If anyone wanted to learn about the Starry River of the Sky Art, it was really easy. After all, the disciples of the Starry River Sect were spread throughout the nine heavens and ten lands, and the Starry River of the Sky Art was not a closely guarded secret. Anyone could approach the Starry River Sect to learn it, as per Long Chen's initial directive to the sect's disciples.

With the rise of the Starry River Sect, many individuals embarked on studying the Starry River of the Sky Art. Hence, most people had an understanding of how the technique worked.

“Call me daddy and I’ll tell you,” said Long Chen.

“You…!” This one sentence shattered Netherdragon Tianzhao’s calm expression. As expected, Long Chen was an absolute scoundrel, and his ability to anger people was out of this world. Netherdragon Tianzhao then roared, “Idiot, do you really think you can compete with me?! I’ve been trying to spare you, but you’re so foolish that you don’t appreciate it. Instead, you keep insulting me!”Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

The vortex above the nine heavens quivered in resonance with his roar, as if his roar embodied the roar of the world, sending shivers down the souls of those who heard it.

Long Chen scoffed, “Spare me? Wow, is that because of your kindness? Because of your generosity? No, it’s because you want to study my dragon blood. Don’t act so noble when your greed is stinking obvious. That will only make me look down on you more. As I’ve said before, I have the true dragon race’s sacred blood flowing through my veins, so I have a duty to clean up the dregs of the dragon race. Since your people are traitors of the dragon race, only one of us can exist in this world. I’ve said this more than once, but you’re still dreaming. Do you still not understand?”

Netherdragon Tianzhao’s expression grew even darker as he became increasingly enraged. Long Chen’s words had completely thwarted the nether dragon race’s plans to extract his secrets, leaving Netherdragon Tianzhao with only one thought—eliminate Long Chen.

However, even if he succeeded in killing Long Chen, performing a soulsearch was out of the question. After all, Long Chen had anticipated the nether dragon race’s intentions, and before his demise, he would undoubtedly erase his spiritual memories to ensure they gleaned nothing.

Against someone like Long Chen who remained resolute against hard or gentle tactics, Netherdragon Tianzhao was at a loss of what to do, his frustration simply fueling his killing intent.

As his anger flared, the vortex above the nine heavens spun wildly. Black qi then surged forth, shrouding the sky and plunging the world into darkness. Just like that, the stars twinkling in the firmament vanished.

“Damn human! Since you want to die so badly, I’ll fulfill your wish!” Netherdragon Tianzhao’s voice resounded like the roars of ten thousand ghouls above the nine heavens.

“Die!”

The vortex quivered, and Netherdragon Tianzhao suddenly lunged at Long Chen like a bolt of black lightning.

However, all of a sudden, the dark sky brightened as specks of starlight emerged from within the vortex.

“What?!”

Everyone was shocked. Netherdragon Tianzhao’s Doyen manifestation was actually unable to fully block the starlight. Then that meant…

BOOM!

A powerful explosion shook the world as two figures collided—a pitch-black fist smashing into a fist covered in stars.

“Not good! Run!” At this moment, countless spectators cried out in terror.
