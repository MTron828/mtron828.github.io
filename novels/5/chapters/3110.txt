Chapter 3099 Bai Xiaole Fights

“After this round, the top five hundred will be decided. The upcoming fights will be very difficult. They will mostly be Primals or those qualified to become Primals,” sighed Mu Qingyun.

The name on her tablet was that of a Primal, and it crushed any wishful thinking she had.

In the last fight, she had used up almost all her power, and she had only recovered to sixty percent now. Against a Primal, she had no hope.

Thus, Long Chen told her to abandon her match. Although she was a bit unwilling, she listened. She didn’t take that risk.

“I’m also against a Primal. Boss, I’m a bit nervous,” said Bai Xiaole. He was the luckiest one out of all of them. He hadn’t encountered any tough opponents all the way until now.

“Although you haven’t awakened a primal bloodline, your talent isn’t inferior to anyone. I expect you to get into the top sixteen. Can you grow up a little?” Long Chen eyed Bai Xiaole.

Bai Xiaole was still too childish, and his path before this was too smooth. Now that he suddenly encountered a Primal, he was panicking a bit. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Moreover, his opponent was quite vicious. All his previous opponents were either killed or crippled, so Bai Xiaole was a bit afraid.

“Don’t worry, this fellow has several weaknesses. Come over here and I’ll teach you.” Qin Feng beckoned to Bai Xiaole. After his defeat, he had been watching the entire martial stage with interest.

Every Dragonblood warrior had been led through countless battles by Long Chen, so they had immense combat experience. Qin Feng’s sharp vision allowed him to instantly see an opponent’s weaknesses.

“Big sister Luo Qing, your opponent is actually Chu Zhen?” Luo Ning looked at Luo Qing’s tablet and was instantly full of apprehension.

The Luo family and the Chu family were mortal enemies. If they encountered each other here, it would be a battle to the death. Only one of them would walk out of the martial stage alive. Either Luo Qing or Chu Zhen would be dying.

Hence, everyone’s heart clenched. Although they knew that the Luo family had come here specifically to counter the Chu family, now that they encountered each other, it still made people nervous.

“No need to worry. I have confidence in my own power,” said Luo Qing.

Long Chen smiled. If miss Luo Qing can eliminate Chu Zhen, then the Chu family’s power will be halved.”

“Halved? Long Chen, you…” Luo Xue and the others were confused until Long Chen revealed his own tablet.

“Long Chen, I’ll share a few of the Chu family’s disciples’ techniques…” said Luo Xue.

“Thank you, but there’s no need. It’s not my ego, but I never investigate my opponents like that. That’s my habit,” said Long Chen.

These words truly were a bit egotistical, but this was truly his habit. It was a principle he had understood after many years. Just as the old man had said, in front of absolute power, all schemes were nonsense.

If you did investigate your opponent and come up with a strategy against them, it showed that you lacked confidence in your own skills. Only people who lacked confidence in themselves would do such a thing.

The old man had told him that the moment he investigated his opponents, he had fallen to a disadvantage. This was not the true Martial Dao.

If you lacked confidence in yourself, you should focus on raising your power and not focusing on using schemes. Forming a habit of such a thing would create a dependence on schemes to win. By that point, it would be too late.

The path of cultivation was like rowing a boat upstream. There were no shortcuts. When you wasted time considering how to beat your opponent, your speed of advancement would drop. And by the time you figured out your plan, those in the same generation as you would have long since surpassed you.

Back then, Long Chen had felt the old man’s principles to not be entirely correct. But after the ultimate battle of the Martial Heaven Continent, he felt his words to truly be of the utmost wisdom.

Looking back, if he had not used little tricks and schemes to handle his problems and instead used the sense of danger and difficulty as the key to unlocking his potential, perhaps the ending of the Martial Heaven Continent’s battle would have been different.

Thus, after ascending, he had no intention of going back to that path. Using little schemes against the weak was nothing more than amusement for himself. Against true experts, crafty plots were ultimately nothing more than worthless jokes.

After experiencing that pain, he corrected his cultivation attitude. Now, he would face his challenges directly.

Just at that moment, Bai Xiaole’s tablet began to flash. He was part of the first group fighting. Qin Feng hadn’t even finished teaching him how to fight his opponent when it started, so Bai Xiaole instantly grew nervous.

Seeing that, Qin Feng whispered a few things into his ears. He was barely done when Bai Xiaole was directly transported to the martial stage.

Once Bai Xiaole was sent in, Long Chen looked at Bai Shishi curiously. “Are you worried about this little brother of yours?”

“Don’t be stupid. In this world, I’m only concerned about myself,” said Bai Shishi coldly.

Long Chen smiled slightly and didn’t say anything. In the instant that Bai Xiaole was sent in, she clenched her fists slightly. He had just happened to see the subtle change in her expression.

Seeing him smile like that as if he was seeing through her, Bai Shishi turned frosty. “I really hate people who think themselves smart.”

“I was never planning on having you like me, so it’s fine.” Long Chen shrugged.

“Stop fighting. Xiaole is starting. How are you in the mood for this nonsense?” Even Lu Mingxuan couldn't bear watching their petty squabble and interrupted them.

Long Chen then focused on Bai Xiaole. His opponent was a fierce-looking butcher.

That expert possessed a tyrannical air, and the killing intent in his eyes seemed to almost condense into a solid form. Just looking at him gave others chills.

Bai Xiaole was clearly nervous. Although he was talented, he had never killed anyone in this lifetime. Because of it, that person’s killing intent was very effective against him.

“Xiaole is at a disadvantage against his opponent’s experience. I wonder if he will be able to beat his opponent,” said Lu Mingxuan worriedly.

“What he needs to do right now isn’t beating his opponent but the fear in his heart. If he can do that, the rest will be no problem,” said Long Chen.

Long Chen was very clear on Bai Xiaole’s potential. If he activated the Three Flower Pupils to their full power, even gods and devils would shake. That was a divine art passed down from an incredibly ancient time, and it surpassed other people’s imagination.

Just at this moment, the martial stage shook and the barrier vanished.

The barrier had just vanished when a curved blade slashed through the air. The next moment, blood splashed and Bai Xiaole’s body was cut apart.

“Xiaole!”
