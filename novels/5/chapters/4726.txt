Chapter 4715 Not Playing Any Longer

The moment Xiuyang threw the bottle at the female attendant, the elder thought to stop it, but it was already too late. Anyway, he didn’t particularly care as she was nothing more than a female attendant. He would just make Xiuyang apologize afterward.

However, unexpectedly, this female attendant seemed to have expected Xiuyang’s actions. Even before the bottle flew out of his hand, her hand had landed on his face.

Xiuyang fell to the ground, knocking down the others. Long Chen bitterly held back his grin as he did his best not to laugh.

“You little slu—!”

POW!

Xiuyang crawled up, only for that attendant to slam her foot onto his nose, crushing his nose flat.

It was a vicious blow that made Xiuyang scream. Snot and tears flowed out of him, and he rolled on the ground in pain.

“You...!”

The elder and the other young experts were shocked, and the youngsters placed their hands on their weapons.

“Child, how could you be so heavy-handed?” scolded Long Chen immediately.

“He attacked me first!” The woman pointed at Xiuyang angrily.

“He’s a guest, and you could have dodged if you wished to. There was no need to be so heavy-handed,” said Long Chen primly. “My apologies for the lack of manners displayed by this young one. She's still inexperienced and has a fiery temperament. After all, she’s never left the High Firmament Academy. I'm certain you remarkable individuals from the Sovereign Emperor Heaven wouldn't stoop to the level of a naive girl who's yet to see the world. Let's just agree to put this matter aside to not harm our friendship.” 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

Instantly, comprehension flashed in the elder’s eyes. So this girl had been placed here intentionally by Long Chen. Previously, he had trapped Long Chen with his words, ensuring Long Chen wouldn't reprimand Xiuyang. Now, Long Chen had turned the tables in a similar fashion.

“It’s all too normal for youngsters to have fiery tempers. We naturally won’t let this harm our friendship.” The elder smiled, but that smile was a bit unnatural.

Now, he understood that this youngster before him was also a wily old fox—one that refused to suffer the slightest loss at that.

“What are you standing there for? Hurry up and tidy things here! No, you should just leave. Have someone with a better temper come,” chided Long Chen.

“Yes.” The female disciple retreated with an aggrieved expression, but once she left and they couldn’t see her anymore, she smiled excitedly. This woman was Luo Ning.

“Hahaha, that was fun!”

Luo Ning clenched her fist, and there was a woman wearing the same robes as her in front of her. She was Luo Bing.

“Don’t you think you went a bit too far?” Luo Bing had seen everything that Luo Ning had done.

“It’s not too far. Senior apprentice-brother Long Chen said it himself. Those fellows don’t have good intentions. It's only fitting to put them in their place here as they deserve no courtesy. Alright, my mission is complete. It’s your turn,” Luo Ning chortled.

Luo Bing shook her head but quickly walked into the room. When she walked in, Long Chen solemnly said, “The tea has been ruined. Switch everything out for new ones.”

“Dean Long Chen, it’s fine. We aren’t here for—”

“No, if we don’t treat our guests with tea, wouldn’t others laugh at my High Firmament Academy for being rude?” Long Chen immediately waved him off.

Luo Bing hastily took away the remains of the tea. At this moment, Xiuyang had been lifted up by the others and was standing. However, his nose was still flat. It seemed that Luo Ning had been too vicious, having used the violet blood race’s qi.

The blood only stopped flowing once Xiuyang consumed a medicinal pill. It went without saying that his medicinal pill was truly not bad, turning his nose soon back to normal. However, the color was a bit purple, making it look a bit odd.

While Luo Bing prepared some fresh tea for everyone, Xiuyang glared at Long Chen furiously. He was no fool. Looking at Long Chen’s suppressed smile, he could tell that Long Chen had planned all this.

When Luo Bing was done pouring tea for everyone, she walked toward Xiuyang with both hands holding a teacup. However, Xiuyang’s leg suddenly whipped out straight for her abdomen.

This time, even the disciples accompanying Xiuyang couldn’t just watch. To attack someone innocent was completely ridiculous, so they all shouted, “Xiuyang!”

The one who had hit him was not even this woman, so directing his anger toward her was not only despicable but also shameful to all present.

As Xiuyang attacked, a flash of killing intent flickered in Long Chen’s eyes. Although he had anticipated that Xiuyang would intentionally make things hard on Luo Bing, he had not expected him to be so rotten.

Startled, Luo Bing cried out and attempted to evade, but in her flustered state, the teacup slipped from her grasp and smashed into Xiuyang’s crotch.

“AH!”

Xiuyang instantly jumped, clenching his crotch and wailing like a miserable ghost.

The elder had the urge to kill this fellow. For him to howl and act like this, he had brought shame to them all.

However, when they looked at Xiuyang’s crotch, they were all shocked. The teacup had shattered, revealing violet liquid within. Shockingly, upon contact with Xiuyang’s crotch, the mixture of tea and violet blood swiftly corroded his flesh until only bone remained.

“My hand!” Luo Bing cried out in terror as she looked at her injured hand, noticing the presence of violet blood seeping from the wound.

Seeing that Luo Bing was still acting, Long Chen waved his hand and dismissed her. Originally, Long Chen had only planned on toying with Xiuyang so that they knew that this wasn’t a place for them to act arrogantly.

However, this bastard had fully enraged Long Chen, and he was no longer interested in playing around.

A black saber directly pierced Xiuyang’s head, cutting his sharp screams abruptly.

”You...!”

The elder and the others were all shocked. The youngsters grabbed their weapons, and the elder’s aura started to rise.

“I’d advise you to not try anything. Otherwise, not one of you will leave this room in one piece.” As Long Chen’s icy gaze swept over them, the temperature in the room instantly plummeted.
