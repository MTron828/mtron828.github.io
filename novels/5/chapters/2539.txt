Chapter 2528 One Roar Shatters the Heavens

The originally faint blue color within Long Chen’s divine ring was now deep blue like the sea. It was evenly matched with the red, orange, yellow, green, and azure colors. All six colors lit up the heavens.

The six-colored divine ring slowly began to spin, with three colors going clockwise and three colors going counterclockwise. Their light illuminated the cosmos, becoming one with all laws and Daos.

The red, yellow, and azure colors were going counterclockwise, while the orange, green, and blue were going clockwise. This opposite spin created an unprecedented divine ring.

The six stars within the divine ring were embedded into the inner ring. The FengFu Star unleashed divine light that illuminated the Alioth Star. The Alioth Star’s light illuminated the Life Fate Star. Then it was the Enlightenment Palace Star, the Divine Gate Star, and the Nethergate Star. Finally, the Nethergate Star’s light shone onto the FengFu Star.

The six stars in his divine ring were the same size and emitted identical fluctuations. They formed a strange loop that reflected upon the divine ring.

Long Chen stood illuminated in the center of this divine ring and six-point star. However, within that divine light, he didn’t appear well. His body was covered in blood, which slowly dripped down his fingertips. Upon striking the ground, white mist spurted out of the ground.

The stones of the ground melted upon contact with Long Chen’s blood as if it was hotter than lava.

“Long Chen!”𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Meng Qi, Chu Yao, and the others were filled with heartache looking at Long Chen. He was covered in wounds, and his physical body had clearly reached its limit. Although he had managed to succeed in summoning the Six Star Battle Armor, the burden was too great.

“You’re crazy.” Evilmoon sighed. It had felt that Long Chen’s body would explode, but his physical body was a bit stronger than expected. However, rather than his body, Evilmoon felt that Long Chen’s will was the most terrifying aspect that enabled this miracle to happen.

Upon reaching the limit of his physical body, Long Chen had used his will to force the Nine Star Hegemon Body Art to adapt to his body. Rather than his body having to meet the requirements of the Nine Star Hegemon Body Art, he was the one forcing the Nine Star Hegemon Body Art to accept his body. This was something that Evilmoon hadn’t thought of.

Although it was a success, the current Long Chen was definitely on the verge of collapse.

“Hahaha, that appearance of yours is quite shocking. But it’s useless. Your physical body cannot handle that power. As long as you use the slightest force, even without any of us doing anything, you’ll explode. How truly laughable. I thought that you had some terrifying trump card, but you are just making us laugh ourselves to death. Hahaha!” Ye Ming laughed.

Long Chen’s body suddenly vanished, and Ye Ming’s laughter disappeared just as quickly. With a roar, he raised the Heaven Devouring Fiend King’s arms to parry a bloody fist.

BOOM!

The altar beneath Ye Ming’s feet instantly exploded, and even the tree roots connected to it crumbled.

The altar that they had been desperately trying to destroy the entire time was shattered in one blow. At the same time, scales exploded off of the fiend king’s arms, and he smashed into the tree trunk.

After that, Ye Ming coughed up a mouthful of dark green blood, which suddenly flowed into the tree.

It was the life essence of the mother tree. Now it was being absorbed back into it.

Everyone was shocked by Long Chen’s power as they were all profoundly aware of how terrifying the altar was. With its barrier up, no one had been able to charge through it.

There had been no way to damage it. Otherwise, Long Chen wouldn’t have been forced to use the karmic hell flames and gather the power of millions of people to attempt to burn it, only to fail. But now, one punch had shattered it.

“Hahaha, good, I underestimated you.” Ye Ming wiped off the blood from his mouth. “However, you’re too late. Even though you cut me off, I’ve gathered enough energy to allow this corpse to recover a tenth of its power from when it was alive. A tenth of the fiend king’s power is enough to challenge experts above Netherpassage. As for you, it seems that your arm won’t be able to endure more than a few more strikes.”

Ye Ming’s last sentence drew everyone’s attention to the arm that Long Chen had used to attack. They found that his arm was badly mangled, and even his bones were revealed.

Long Chen’s current power was absolutely terrifying, but his physical body didn’t match it. At this rate, it would only take a few more exchanges before his body collapsed.

“Long Chen, you’ve lost. Even if I just stand here and let you hit me, how long can you last? Three hits? Five hits? Ten hits? But what about afterward? At most, you can give me some unremarkable injuries, but you will die. Your brothers will all die here. As for your beauties, hehe, well they’ll probably face a fate worse than death,” laughed Ye Ming.

Long Chen slowly walked toward Ye Ming, his footsteps echoing.

“I, Long Chen, rose from the Eastern Wastelands. The path I walked was covered in corpses. I don’t know how many demons and monsters I’ve slain, or how many so-called geniuses who thought too much of themselves. But I’ve never been able to figure out one question. Why is it that despite the world being so big, you all have to target me? I’ve always wanted to live a simple peaceful life where I am free to exist, but you all have to set yourselves against me. I don’t want to kill you, but you send yourselves to me, forcing me to kill you. Now I no longer feel like I am myself. I don’t want to be tyrannical and bloodthirsty. I don’t want to become a fearsome person, but you keep forcing me. Since you all like courting death so much, fine. You’re the ones who forced me, so don’t blame me for killing you all.”

Killing intent and violence exploded out of Long Chen along with his final words. This aggressiveness made even people on his side feel afraid.

When they came to their senses, Long Chen was already charging toward Ye Ming with his fist smashing forward.

“Kill us all? Haha, what a joke. Just you- huh?” Ye Ming’s words were cut off when he noticed that Long Chen’s arm had fully recovered.

In just a split second, Long Chen’s fist landed on Ye Ming’s chest, resulting in the scales covering the fiend king’s chest exploding and the chest caving in. This violent burst of power caused a huge ball of light to appear in the void, a sign that the laws of the earth were shattered.

The fiend king’s body shot back like a cannonball, tearing through the void.

“Not good!” The divine families’ experts were horrified to realize that the fiend king’s corpse was flying toward them.

“Run!”

Regretfully, they were too slow. The fiend king’s body was causing the void around it to collapse, resulting in a mass of the divine families, Corrupt path, ancient family alliance, and Pill Valley’s disciples dying.

The power of the Six Star Battle Armor was truly immense. It was so great that it even broke the laws of the Star Field Divine World. The fiend king’s body had killed over a hundred thousand disciples.

The other disciples turned green with fright and fled for their lives. This battlefield was no longer theirs.

Long Chen didn’t chase after Ye Ming. Instead, he arrived among the sea demon race.

These brainless fools had been the main force of the last attack. They weren’t like the other groups that had been launching sneak attacks. Hence, it was unknown just how many disciples of the Martial Heaven Alliance and the Luo Spirit race they had killed.

“Run!” The sea demon race’s experts instantly fled when he arrived in their midst.

“All of you can die!” Long Chen let out a heaven-shaking roar, and the divine ring behind him suddenly became still. The six stars trembled, and a formless wave of light exploded.

The sea demons had just started running when their bodies suddenly stiffened. Their heads then exploded. In an instant, a giant sphere of death spread around Long Chen. Almost a million corpses fell to the ground, horrifying everyone.

“What kind of technique is that?” Even Guo Ran and the others were horrified. They had never seen such a terrifying attack.

“He used his Spiritual Strength to unleash his domineering will and directly crush their souls. Long Chen’s Spiritual Strength has always been powerful, but now it seems to have merged with his will. Other than peak experts, probably not many people can survive it. The sea demons in particular don’t have powerful Spiritual Strength,” explained Meng Qi. Although that was the theory, to see it in action was truly terrifying.

The sea demon race had come into the Star Field Divine World with one million and five hundred thousand experts. After several encounters with Long Chen and some losses in other areas, they were down to less than a million. Hence, this one roar from Long Chen almost wiped them out. The only one remaining from the sea demon race was the Six Horn Sea Serpent.

“Long Chen!”

The Six Horn Sea Serpent only recovered from the sight of this reality after a long moment of shock. With a mournful roar, he charged over with the Sea God Trident. His manifestation then exploded, transforming into golden flames that enveloped him.

The Six Horn Sea Serpent had gone crazy. He was the future king of the sea demon race, and the experts he had brought along with him were the elites of the sea demon race. They were the cornerstones of his dream of marching onto the Martial Heaven Continent and claiming it for the sea demon race.

Now, everything was gone. In his crazed state, he even sacrificed his manifestation to multiply his power. He wanted to kill Long Chen; nothing else mattered.

Long Chen took a deep breath. Ten Heavenly Qilin Demon Trees within his primal chaos space instantly withered. The cracks that had appeared on his body and arm instantly recovered.

“Die!” Long Chen directly punched the Sea God Trident.
