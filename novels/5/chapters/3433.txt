Chapter 3422 Coming Late

“You’re talking nonsense!” the leader of the Lightning Falcon race shouted furiously. The Blue Eye Bright Scale race was actually so sinister, trying to create a conflict between the Lightning Falcon race and the Sacred Pill Hall.

“This matter has nothing to do with the Lightning Falcon race. The Lightning Falcon race was simply tricked by Long Chen and can’t be faulted. Even we were tricked. If you have to blame someone, blame my Sacred Pill Hall for being careless.” Unexpectedly, the hall master of the Sacred Pill Hall actually spoke up in defense of the Lightning Falcon race.

All powers within the Integral Heaven Star-Field were within the control of the Sacred Pill Hall. When it came to the movements of the Lightning Falcon, Water Mallard, Mammoth Divine Elephant, and other races, the Sacred Pill Hall knew them like the back of their hand. There was no way that the Lightning Falcon race had intentionally drawn Long Chen over to target the Sacred Pill Hall.

First, ignoring if it had any benefit to the Lightning Falcon race, with the simple heads of the demonic beast race, for them to use such a high level scheme against the Sacred Pill Hall was a huge joke. So the hall master directly crushed this accusation of the Blue Eye Bright Scale race.

“Hall master is wise. This matter truly has nothing to do with my Lightning Falcon race. Yuner is still young and has been bewitched by Long Chen. Please don’t blame her,” said the leader of the Lightning Falcon race.

This random Boss Long San had now been confirmed to be the dean of the seventh branch of the High Firmament Academy. In other words, Long Chen was a mortal enemy of the Sacred Pill Hall. So, the Lightning Falcon race’s leader naturally didn’t want to offend the Sacred Pill Hall, because without their pills, his Lightning Falcon race would be crushed.

“Don’t worry. The formation has been activated and he is a turtle caught in a jar. Although we can’t do anything to him within the Divine Lord Immortal Realm, once he leaves, he won’t be able to escape. Furthermore, you are all overestimating him. Many coincidences were lined up in order for him to defeat the genius of the Blue Eye Bright Scale race. He only prevailed due to his scheming. Moreover, there are still many other heavenly geniuses waiting for him inside. Hmph, I want to see just what kind of trick the High Firmament Academy is playing to choose a Four Peak disciple to be a dean,” sneered the hall master. He didn’t think that a youngster like Long Chen was qualified to be a dean.

It had to be known that while the High Firmament Academy had declined, it was still the oldest academy in the world, and the position of a dean from its branch sect was very illustrious. For a youngster to be one was a joke.

The hall master was even somewhat excited by this status of Long Chen’s. If he caught Long Chen, it would be of huge merit. The heavens had practically sent him a gift.

“That’s right. If Long Chen encounters my race’s eighth prince, he’s definitely dead,” said an expert of the Mammoth Divine Elephant race arrogantly.

“I hope that they won’t meet because I want to capture Long Chen alive. It’s a shame that everything within the Divine Lord Immortal Realm is its own world and we can’t communicate with them inside. I suppose it will be up to his luck,” sighed the hall master.

Before this, the Sacred Pill Hall could change the laws of the Divine Lord Immortal Realm. However, it was impossible this time because they had also linked it to the core of the Integral Heaven Star-Field. They didn’t have the power to interfere with the laws of its operation.

Now, the experts of the various races continued to stare at the desolate world in the screen of light. They saw Lei Yuner and Long Chen flying quickly toward the core.

…

Lightning appeared up ahead and thunder rumbled. Experts were undergoing tribulation all around.

“They are weaker people who don’t dare to enter the core region for fear that the heavenly tribulations of other people might crush them. So they choose to undergo tribulation in the outer regions,” said Lei Yuner. Spreading her wings, she pierced straight through other people’s tribulations, conveniently explaining this to Long Chen.

Long Chen nodded in understanding. As they got closer to the core, the ripples of the Heavenly Daos grew stronger. So, the closer to the core, the greater the power of the tribulation. Without great power, undergoing tribulation here was courting death.

More and more people were undergoing tribulation, and Lei Yuner suddenly said, “Not good. There isn’t anyone blocking us. They might have reached the core.”

“What? Is it impossible to enter if others are already there?” asked Long Chen.

“I’m not sure either. But I understand that bitch Wu Ying. For her to not have sent people to block us, she must have other arrangements,” said Lei Yuner.

Lei Yuner was incredibly fast. However, the ripples of the Heavenly Daos continued to grow stronger. Now, the runes of the Heavenly Daos could practically be seen with the naked eye. It was possible to see the operation of the Heavenly Daos here.

The spiritual qi here was abundant, and the Heavenly Daos were complete. This was truly a sacred place for undergoing tribulation, providing endless benefits.UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

In half an incense stick’s worth of time, they finally saw a giant sphere of light. Lei Yuner hatefully said, “Those bastards really did enter first.”

Just as she finished speaking, she reached the front of the sphere. It was a giant barrier. Inside it, Long Chen saw the familiar figures of Wu Ying, the Mammoth Divine Elephant race’s eighth prince, and others.

There were sixteen of them sitting within the barrier. Divine light flowed around their bodies, and they seemed to be receiving some kind of blessing.

BOOM!

A ray of light shot out of Lei Yuner’s eyes and struck the barrier. As a result, a powerful explosion erupted, but the barrier didn’t quiver in the slightest. Instead, Lei Yuner was actually sent flying back.

This was a special divine ability of the Lightning Falcon race that possessed immense penetrative power. It was capable of breaking through all kinds of barriers. But it was like an ant trying to shake a tree when it struck this barrier.

“Bastards!”

Lei Yuner was enraged. Wu Ying and the others smiled inside the barrier as if they had already won.

“Idiot, did you not know? This barrier can only hold sixteen people at most. Once it’s full, the barrier will automatically block others. Even World Kings can’t get in. Hahaha, you have no chance!” Wu Ying laughed arrogantly.

“What a pity. We wanted to wait for you, but the barrier activated automatically. It’s such a shame. Once I obtain the blessing of the Heavenly Daos, killing you will be as easy as killing a chicken. It won’t be interesting at all.” The eighth prince shook his head at Long Chen.

It seemed that he really did feel regretful about it, yet he was also flaunting himself and taunting Long Chen. His expression sparked Long Chen’s rage. He would never forget how the eighth prince had killed the nine star heir.

Killing intent then exploded out of Long Chen. After that, a lightning sphere appeared in Lei Yuner’s hand. She prepared to use the World Extermination Lightning Radiance to break the barrier, but Long Chen stopped her. He knew that this barrier couldn’t be broken with their power.

Just as he prepared to take out his dagger, a gentle voice rang out within his mind.

“Do you want to enter?”

“Who are you?” Long Chen was startled.
