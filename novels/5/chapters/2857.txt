Chapter 2846 Guts

When Heaven Master Yun Yang was done talking, everyone looked at Long Chen. He was still dozing off, stunning everyone. Was he actually so arrogant that he dared to ignore even Heaven Master Yun Yang’s words?

“Boss San- Ah!”

Li Cai saw that Long Chen really did seem to be sleeping, so he reached over to nudge him. However, even before his hand touched him, Long Chen’s hand whipped out quick as lightning, grabbing his throat.

Everyone jumped in shock as blood dripped down Li Cai’s throat. Long Chen had almost crushed his throat.

“Boss San, it’s me…”

Long Chen slowly loosened his grip and then apologized, “Sorry, that was my bad. It’s my reflex.”

Long Chen himself didn’t know why he was suddenly overcome by a bout of drowsiness. He had truly fallen asleep, and Li Cai’s actions had startled him awake. He then instinctively counterattacked, almost causing a catastrophe. Fortunately, he reacted fast enough, or Li Cai’s little life would be gone.

“Congratulations, instructor Long Chen. A large part of your mortal qi has been expelled. With immortal qi gradually entering your body, it results in the body feeling weary. This indicates that your immortal qi has risen greatly during this time,” said Heaven Master Yun Yang.

Only Heaven Master Yun Yang was able to see the truth. If someone advanced too quickly within the Mortal Transcendence realm, their body would need to adjust to it, and that adjustment sometimes involved a deep slumber. Long Chen had fallen asleep not long after sitting.

That was why Long Chen hadn’t reacted to Ming Ze and the others’ provocation. It wasn’t because of how magnanimous he was but that he simply didn’t hear it.

“I’m sorry for my rudeness,” apologized Long Chen.

“Not a problem. You can’t control such a thing. But be careful. If your realm rises too quickly, such a thing will occur more often. You can’t just think about running. Sometimes you have to stop and adjust yourself. A blade must be constantly sharpened,” reminded Heaven Master Yun Yang.

“Many thanks for your pointers. Disciple understands.” Long Chen cupped his fists.

In terms of battle, he had ample experience. But when it came to cultivation, compared to Heaven Master Yun Yang, his experience was lacking. Long Chen still had a long path to walk.

“Boss San, you almost took my life!” Li Cai appraised his wounds, still feeling some lingering fear.

“Sorry. Ever since I started cultivating, most of my time was spent on the border between life and death, so I’m rather sensitive. Don’t worry, I’ll give you some special treatment when we get back as compensation.” Long Chen patted Li Cai’s shoulder.

“Many thanks, boss San! Many thanks!” Li Cai was delighted to hear this. This meant that Long Chen was going to teach him some extra things. Hearing this, the other disciples of the Elite Group were all envious.

After such a long time with Long Chen, their impression of him only grew greater. He was an existence that they could not comprehend, and his power was enough for people to completely ignore his cultivation base.

“Instructor Long Chen, everyone is looking at you. Can you say a few words?” asked Heaven Master Yun Yang.

“About what?” asked Long Chen. He didn’t hear what Heaven Master Yun Yang had said before.

“Boss San, Heaven Master Yun Yang wishes for you to share your experiences with everyone,” said one of the Elite Group’s disciples.

Long Chen then looked at everyone’s expressions and instantly understood. He shook his head. “Actually, Heaven Master, you are already well aware. Are you giving this little one a chance to show off?”

Long Chen truly felt respect for Heaven Master Yun Yang. It was always people with the greatest learning that had the least arrogance. Heaven Master Yun Yang was such an existence.

Long Chen believed that with Heaven Master Yun Yang’s sharp vision, nothing could be hidden from him. However, he still wanted Long Chen to say a few words about his experience. That was a chance to show off in front of everyone. Although Long Chen didn’t care about this chance, he still had to thank the Heaven Master for his good intentions.

“Instructor Long Chen, don’t be courteous. We truly wish to know how you, in just a month, managed to turn a group of trash- cough, a group of ordinary people into a true Elite Group,” called out a disciple, correcting himself midway.

That disciple was embarrassed by his slip of the tongue, but the Elite Group didn’t get angry. Instead, they felt proud. They also admitted that they were trash back then. Long Chen had long since said this.

They didn’t mind others insulting their past because they also looked down on their past selves. Since they had transformed, their pasts were not taboo. They only felt proud of having transformed. This kind of transformation was worthy of pride.

At this moment, Long Chen walked onto the martial stage. Looking at those expectant disciples, he sighed inside.

“The Elite Group’s victory was entirely within my expectations. The reason they won was due to one thing…”

Long Chen paused and looked over everyone before he finally spat out one word.

“Guts.”

“Guts?”

Everyone stared at him in confusion, not understanding what he meant.

Long Chen nodded. “Yes, guts. To put it more concretely, it is the determination to risk their lives. During this month, I didn’t teach them much. All I taught them was that if they wanted to obtain something, they had to go all-out. When you have no supporters, when you have no resources, when you have no favorable conditions, but you still want to change your fate, then your only card is your life. As long as you can bet with your life, you will still have a chance to obtain what you want, changing your current predicament. They spent this month fighting on the brink of death almost every day. After a month of training, they finally gained the courage to risk their lives. This is why their victory was for sure. They were willing to use their own lives, while those that they defeated didn’t have that courage.”

“That…” People still didn’t understand.

“Instructor Long Chen is correct. If you didn’t fight them, you wouldn't know just how terrifying they are. They’re like bloodthirsty beasts. Even if you gave me another chance, I would still lose,” said one of the disciples that had been defeated off of the divine rankings. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

Those who had fought against the Elite Group were too shaken by their auras to fight properly, so their combat power sharply fell. Before the battle even started, they had lost.

“Instructor Long Chen, I wish to know how Li Cai managed to beat Zhong Changsheng, someone who was clearly stronger than him? What technique did he use to beat someone stronger when he was weaker?” At this moment, Zhong Ling ran out and raised her hand high in the air.
