Chapter 2115 Cloud Chasing Divine Ability

All they saw was Long Chen and Xia Chen standing in the sky as if they were spectators looking at a wondrous sight.

“You’ve already done very well. You’ve let me see just how terrifying a formation master is. Don’t worry, you’ll definitely have more chances to perform.” Long Chen patted Xia Chen’s shoulder.

Xia Chen had started his ploy as soon as Zhao Wuji got close. Long Chen had first drawn them into the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow race’s territory.

As soon as they reached the core, the Dragonblood warriors put on a show. That was their display of peeing on Zhao Wuji’s formation. It was on Xia Chen’s orders, and it wasn’t intentionally done to humiliate them but simply to draw their attention.

That was because once the Dragonblood warriors drew their attention, Xia Chen launched a special formation he had prepared just to target their formation.

Once the Dragonblood warriors had left, the scene that Zhao Wuji and the others had seen became an illusion. Once they set off again, they thought that they were heading toward the core, all the while moving further and further away, until they exited the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow race’s ancestral land.

Long Chen had truly borne witness to just how amazing Xia Chen was. Even Long Chen hadn’t expected things to go so smoothly. Due to how smoothly things were going, Xia Chen changed some of his original plans and formations. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

He directly got rid of some of the formations he had set up within the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow race’s territory. If they fought inside their territory, it would cause damage. The grand formation protecting this region had been set up by Xia Chen, and he didn’t want to cause any damage to it unless he had to. So he decided to draw Zhao Wuji and the others far away.

To prevent them from sensing anything, Xia Chen had ordered the Dragonblood warriors to occasionally pass by their formation, making it seem like they were entering an even more tightly guarded region to not draw their suspicion.

As a result, it was unknown if they simply had too much confidence in their own formation or if their killing intent had muddled their heads, but they didn’t sense anything.

By the time they realized that something was off, they had landed within their trap. Xia Chen’s formation activated, killing over three thousand of the Mechanism Sect’s disciples. He also affected their armor, reducing their combat prowess. The Stone race’s people were also affected by the water that was powered by Xia Chen’s formation. Normal water would be automatically repelled by the Stone race’s protective layer of divine light, but this water had soaked them. It didn’t necessarily directly affect their fighting, but it would influence their mental states.

“Long Chen, die!”

Shi Lingfeng was the first to reach Long Chen. His whole body blazed with light as he attacked. Following him were the infuriated Stone race’s experts who wanted to surround Long Chen and make sure that he couldn’t escape.

“If someone as ugly as you hasn’t died, why would I?” said Long Chen as he watched Shi Lingfeng flying at him.

Xia Chen smiled and changed his hand seals. The space behind the two of them split open, and a group of large figures appeared, their giant bodies blocking the sky. An ominous aura caused the sky to shake.

“It’s the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrows!”

Shi Lingfeng, whose rage had clouded his mind, suddenly realized something was wrong. Before he could do anything, the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrows’ attacks arrived.

Each of them was like a mountain. There were five hundred of them, and they all opened their mouths at the same time. The runes on top of their feathers lit up, and a powerful and majestic bloodline power connected each of them.

All five hundred Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrows activated the same divine art. Due to their bloodline connection, their auras merged into one.

“Get out of the way!” Shi Lingfeng shouted at his people. The crystals on his body flashed, and he vanished.

At this moment, a black ray of light came from the mouth of every Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow.

With how big their bodies were, the black lights were hundreds of meters across. They merged into one, transforming into one black gigantic sword of light.

The black light sword passed straight through the Stone race’s experts. Everything in front of it was blown apart.

This was the strongest divine ability of the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow race, and five hundred of them had unleashed it together without holding back at all. Their power even stunned Long Chen.

The black sword passed through the Stone race and then continued onto the Mechanism Sect’s experts. Anyone who touched it was turned to dust.

“This attack actually contains an aspect of oblivion. It doesn’t matter whether it’s stone or armor, nothing can block it.” Long Chen sighed inside. This combined attack of the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow race was probably no weaker than the attack of the God Extermination Cannon.

Long Chen suddenly felt a bit of regret. If he had known that their divine abilities were so frightening, he would have had them directly attack these invaders within their concealed formation. Perhaps they might have been able to annihilate them all.

The reason he hadn’t directly attacked the hidden formation was because such a formation had its backups if it was attacked. It had a defensive barrier around it, and even if they could break it in one attack, anyone who wasn’t killed would be transported away by one of the safety measures of the formation.

As for Xia Chen, he hadn’t made a direct move, instead slowly weakening the runes inside the formation, in the end destroying the transportation formations so that they couldn’t escape.

If he had known that the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrows’ attack was so powerful, then perhaps with this oblivion divine ability, they could have directly destroyed the formation’s defenses along with its escape safeguard. There would have been a possibility of destroying them all right there and then.

Nothing within the path of their attack was left alive. There was only a black void.

Over a thousand of the Stone race’s experts had come, but now only three hundred remained. That was only because they hadn’t been struck by the attack.

As for the Mechanism Sect’s people, they were too concentrated, and although the attack only brushed by where they were, it still killed half of them.

“DIE!” Shi Lingfeng howled, directly charging at the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrows. He had to kill a few of them to avenge his people.

Those five hundred Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrows’ auras rapidly fell. Long Chen had ordered them to concentrate all their power into one attack, so they naturally hadn’t held back anything at all.

BOOM! A figure suddenly appeared in the air, knocking back Shi Lingfeng with his spear.

“The Dragonblood Legion’s first captain, Gu Yang.” Gu Yang blocked Shi Lingfeng, his blood dragon manifestation present behind him. The dragon roared, causing his Blood Qi to soar.

“An ant dares to block me? Die!” Shi Lingfeng roared furiously, feeling insulted because he was blocked by one of Long Chen’s subordinates. His crystals twinkled like stars, and a terrifying aura rose. The earth cracked, and the lake beneath their feet instantly flowed underground.

As Shi Lingfeng unleashed his full power, a single punch from him caused the laws of the world to look like they would shatter. This was the power he had taken out when he had fought Long Chen.

BOOM!

Gu Yang blocked with his spear but was still sent flying. He smashed into the ground, causing mud to splatter.

“Brothers, come help. This fellow’s fist is pretty hard.” Gu Yang wiped some blood off the corner of his mouth. He really wasn’t able to stop Shi Lingfeng by himself.

Shi Lingfeng was startled that Gu Yang could get up after this attack. He was just one of Long Chen’s subordinates but had actually been able to survive his full-strength attack.

The earth suddenly exploded and two mud giants appeared. Runes flowed across the giants, causing them to harden until they were like stone.

“The Dragonblood Legion’s second captain, Li Qi.”

“The Dragonblood Legion’s third captain, Song Mingyuan.”

“Here for pointers!” Li Qi and Song Mingyuan shouted at the same time, their manifestations appearing behind him.

The two earth giants attacked at the same time, and two explosive sounds rang out. Shi Lingfeng punched with both hands, unleashing two giant fist-images that forced back the two earth giants.

“Taste my spear!” Gu Yang’s spear brought with it a giant spear-image that crashed into Shi Lingfeng.

Having been forced to hastily switch to handling Gu Yang after repelling the earth giants, Shi Lingfeng was knocked back. He was enraged. “Bastards, you’re actually earth cultivators!”

He found that once Li Qi and Song Mingyuan appeared, his own earth energy was affected.

Although Shi Lingfeng wasn’t an Empyrean and had no manifestation, the crystals on his body could be considered a natural manifestation born by the heavens. Those crystals absorbed Heavenly Dao energy along with earth energy.

However, once Li Qi and Song Mingyuan arrived, a portion of his earth energy was stolen by the two of them, and it caused Gu Yang to be able to knock him back.

“Brothers, let’s crush him together!” shouted Li Qi, sending his earth giant barrelling toward Shi Lingfeng. Song Mingyuan often worked together with him, making their cooperation seem seamless.

Even with their manifestations present, they could clearly feel that it was much more taxing to absorb any earth energy now, but they knew that Shi Lingfeng must be having the same problem as well.

Gu Yang’s spear danced through the air as the three of them attacked Shi Lingfeng.

Mountains collapsed and the earth was torn asunder as they fought. Shi Lingfeng was completely tied down by the three of them.

“Long Chen, face your death!”

A sinister laugh rang out. At some point, a black cannon had been pointed on Long Chen. Countless runes flowed around it. It was actually the God Extermination Cannon!
