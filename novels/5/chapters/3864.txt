Chapter 3853 Sun Moon Five Element Flag

This was a terrifying divine weapon. The flagpole was ten meters long, looking like a spear, and its entire body was covered in a twisting black-and-white pattern.

With a quiver of this flagpole, the void rumbled. On top of the flagpole, the triangular flag had five blank runes. At this moment, the runes on Long Aotian’s forehead, hands, and feet came off of his body and were embedded in those five spots.

Once the five elemental runes were embedded in the flag, it seemed to come to life. Five-colored divine light burst out of it, and the power of the five elements tore through the void.

“This is the weapon that the Long clan’s patriarch personally created for me, the Sun Moon Five Element Flag. Today, your life will end in front of it!” Long Aotian roared, his hair flying about wildly. He then raised the flagpole, wrapping it in all the power of the world before directly smashing it at Long Chen.

In that instant, it was like all the energy of the world was sucked away by the Sun Moon Five Element Flag. Heaven and earth were about to be crushed.

Facing it, the Minghong Saber came out of its sheath, with stars flowing on top of it. Long Chen instantly transferred the energy of the stars into his saber. As a result, nine hundred and ninety-nine stars lit up on the blade.

“Split the Heavens 4!”

Two divine weapons crashed together, containing all the power of these two peerless experts. It was an exchange to end everything, to kill the opponent or die trying.

The next moment, countless fragments of divine light shot out in every direction. They were like sharp swords piercing the void.

“Not good!”

Yin Changsheng and the others hastily summoned defenses, but they were still one step too slow. Those sharp swords swept through them.nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

Countless experts of the devil race and the Sacred Pill Hall were annihilated by these rays of light. In front of this destructive power, they were like ants, unable to even resist in the slightest.

As the sharp swords tore through the world, flames raged and lightning danced. It was truly an apocalyptic sight.

Following that, they heard an immense explosion as endless fragments of spacetime exploded. Everyone was drawn into that chaotic flow. Their vision twisted and turned.

When space finally calmed down, the heavenly tomb was gone. All the survivors saw was a barren wasteland. This minor world known as the heavenly tomb had been forcibly destroyed.

However, although the heavenly tomb was gone, the Heavenly Boundary Line remained and so was the bronze cauldron. The coffins chained to it were also still floating in the air.

“Damn, that was dangerous.”

Xia Chen and the others stuck their heads out of a coffin. Looking at the ruined world, they felt a chill.

Fortunately, they had been hidden in a coffin, so none of that power reached them. They silently managed to pass through this calamity.

As for Yin Changsheng and Shi Yang, their expressions weren’t very good right now. Of all the experts they had brought with them, only a few hundred remained.

They had been careless to not summon defenses in advance. That terrifying aftermath came before they had time to react, resulting in them only able to protect the ones directly behind them.

Tens of thousands of Supreme heavenly geniuses were killed. Thinking about this, Shi Yang and Yin Changsheng were both shocked and enraged. To not even be able to protect their own subordinates was a naked slap in their faces.

The most infuriating thing was that Long Aotian and Long Chen weren’t even looking at them. The two of them didn’t care about what was happening outside their battlefield.

Long Chen and Long Aotian’s weapons were still locked against each other. Qi waves continued to crash out of the two of them as they tried to suppress the other.

Both of them were badly wounded. There were countless cracks throughout their bodies, and blood oozed out of those cracks, blown away by the astral winds.

They were like two porcelain bottles that had been struck and were on the verge of shattering. However, they both clenched their teeth and endured. Neither retreated. That ominous sight was astonishing.

Even for Yin Changsheng and the others, seeing two people be so ruthless was a first.

Long Chen and Long Aotian were both severely wounded, their lives hanging by a single thread. But neither was even thinking about retreating. Right now, they were seeing who could suppress the other. Retreat represented defeat, and they would rather die than admit defeat.

At this moment, even Mo Nian was no longer in the mood to search for treasures. Victory or defeat would soon be decided.

However, Mo Nian wasn’t worried about Long Chen losing. What he was worried about was Ji Wuming, this terrifying assassin, making a move while both of them were severely wounded. That would be too dangerous.

Suddenly, both of them howled and the essence blood around them ignited. This was clearly a self-mutilating technique to draw out even just the slightest bit more power.

The stars behind Long Chen rumbled and roared. As he had pushed his astral energy to the limit, his stars were flickering, their astral energy exhausted. It could be said to be his most difficult fight ever.

As for Long Aotian, he was in no better condition. The five-colored light around him had retreated and the seven-colored world behind him was now illusory, looking like it might fade at any moment.

BOOM!

Suddenly, Long Aotian’s body shook, and coughing up blood, he flew back.

“Coward! This is why even with my Spirit Blood, Spirit Root, and Spirit Bone, you aren’t a match for me. I, Long Chen, walked out of the mortal world step by step. Everything I have, I obtained myself. As for you, you don’t even dare to risk your life. That only proves that your inner heart is that of a coward. You are afraid of losing. You are afraid of death! The reason that you are so afraid is because you aren’t confident in yourself. Someone who can’t even believe in themself can never become an expert!” shouted Long Chen.

Both of them had reached their limits and were seeing who would be the first to be unable to endure. That person would die. But in the end, Long Aotian was too afraid to do so and ran.

The price of retreating was that Long Chen’s overwhelming power flowed into his body. As a result, Long Aotian hacked up three mouthfuls of blood, and his aura grew listless.

“Idiot, a man knows how to use his brain! My Supreme Blood hasn’t fully awoken yet. How can I waste it on someone as worthless as you?! Killing you is a minor matter that I can do whenever I want! Why foolishly waste my talent on someone like you?!” shouted Long Aotian darkly.

Previously, Long Aotian had said that he would defeat Long Chen in his strongest area. Regretfully, he had failed and now he quibbled about it. That was slapping his own face.

“My seven-color Supreme Blood hasn’t fully awoken, and I can only control the slightest bit of my violet blood. Most importantly, the primal chaos violet blood is not used to strengthen myself. Well, I’m not going to waste words on you. You’re already powerless. On the other hand, I’ve pretty much exhausted my seven-color Supreme Blood, but I still have the majority of my violet blood. You can rest in peace now. Dying to your mother’s family’s supreme technique should make you die happy.” Long Aotian’s voice was already weak, but when he raised his left hand, violet blood gathered into mysterious runes that revolved in the air. A violet spear then slowly condensed in his hand.

When it appeared, terrifying pressure caused this world to shake. The earth slowly sank. This violet blood spear was something gods and devils would flee from.

The Long Aotian that was weakened to this extent was actually capable of summoning such a powerful move. Everyone’s heart clenched.

“Die!”

With a wave of his hand, Long Aotian sent that blood spear piercing toward Long Chen.
