Chapter 4915 All-Out Resistance

Long Chen and Mo Nian made their move at the same time. However, they were quite a distance away from the vice hall master. Although their assault targeted the vice hall master, their true aim was the spot in front of that old bastard.

Long Chen’s saber descended with the grace of a river of stars, while Mo Nian unleashed a single arrow that fragmented into ten thousand arrow images, merging seamlessly into one powerful strike. The might of his attack did not lose out to Long Chen’s at all.

To everyone’s surprise, the vice hall master moved forward as if throwing himself into their attacks.

“Hmph, you overestimate your power. Once I kill him, I’ll deal with you,” snorted the vice hall master. He hadn’t expected them to accurately predict his movements. A dragon image appeared on top of the vice hall master, and he slammed a palm toward them.

BOOM!

This palm strike smashed apart Long Chen’s saber-image and Mo Nian’s arrow, its irresistible power forcing them back.

The difference was too great as they simply weren’t on the same level. When the vice hall master’s heaven vein appeared on him, it felt like heaven and earth fell under his control.

In the distance, Xing Wujiang’s pupils shrank. 

“Run away! He has condensed a complete heaven vein!” shouted Xing Wujiang.

Xing Wujiang’s shout drew out countless startled cries. In comparison, Xing Wujiang’s heaven vein was somewhat illusory, but the vice hall master’s heaven vein was like a solid body. The dragon swirling around him reflected images of mountains, plains, and rivers. As it revolved, the world’s aura merged with him.

He seemed to be the ruler of the world. Let alone fighting him, most people were unable to even summon the courage to fight back. He was like a god.

“You overestimated them. Did you think two pieces of trash would be enough to block me?” The vice hall master sneered and walked toward Xing Wujiang.

“You’re the trash! Your whole family is trash! Explode!”

Mo Nian suddenly formed hand seals, summoning vortexes above, below, to the left, right, front, and back of the vice hall master.

“Those are…!”

Startled cries rang out as weapons emerged from the vortexes. Upon closer inspection, everyone was shocked to discover that these were all high-grade Heaven Saint divine weapons.

However, the auras of these Heaven Saint divine weapons were extremely obscure. Without closer inspection, no one could sense their existence.Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

A total of thirty-six Heaven Saint divine weapons surrounded the vice hall master. When he saw them, his expression changed, and he hastily stopped his advance.

BOOM!

Thirty-six Heaven Saint divine weapons exploded at the same time, turning the area where the vice hall master had stood into a swirling vortex of absolute chaos.

The experts of the Flame Divine Hall turned pale with shock. Who would have expected a Divine Venerate to possess thirty-six Heaven Saint divine weapons and actually have the capability to detonate them?

In truth, these weapons were artifacts Mo Nian had unearthed from underground. They were essentially half-crippled, with most of their item-spirits beyond awakening. When Mo Nian found them, they were of no practical use to him, so he had simply kept them in his pocket.

Today, he finally had a use for them. With a secret art, he detonated all thirty-six Heaven Saint divine weapons, catching the vice hall master off guard.

Just as people questioned whether or not the vice hall master had perished, they heard Xing Wujiang’s panicked shout.

“Run! This move of yours can’t kill him!”

After that, Mo Nian formed hand seals, and one green chain after another shot out, encircling that space like a fish net. Suddenly, the chains tightened.

When the twisting space returned to normal, a wretched figure appeared in everyone’s vision.

This person was the vice hall master, now looking ashen-faced. Deep, frightening wounds marred his face and body, and blood stained his robes.

Although the vice hall master had cultivated a complete heaven vein, resulting in ordinary Heaven Saint divine weapons unable to harm him, he had underestimated Mo Nian’s cunning. Amongst the weapons he had just detonated, some of them were cursed weapons. In other words, the accumulated resentment of their previous masters had been unleashed in the explosion, forming an incredibly insidious curse.

These cursed weapons were far more terrifying than average ones when they detonated. Mo Nian had cleverly mixed them with regular weapons to conceal their presence.

Though the wounds were superficial, being injured by a Divine Venerate disciple was an unspeakable humiliation for the vice hall master.

Having been schemed against by Mo Nian, the vice hall master found himself ensnared by countless green chains as he emerged from the explosion. He snorted in disdain, unleashing a ring of flames that smashed into the chains.

This attack seemed casual, but in truth, the power behind it was enough to instantly annihilate Heaven Saints. However, when this attack struck Mo Nian’s chain net, the latter didn’t break. Instead, it inflated, resisting the attack.

The vice hall master’s pupils shrank as intense unease surged within him. He hadn’t held back with this attack, given the dire situation, yet he was still unable to break free.

Meanwhile, blood seeped from Mo Nian’s seven orifices. Despite the excruciating pain, he gritted his teeth and bitterly endured.

“Damn ant, you think you can stop me?!” the vice hall master roared. Dragon qi swirled around him, and a ring of flames several times stronger than the last one erupted.

“Don’t block him! You’ll die!” Xing Wujiang shouted, his voice tinged with desperation. He had underestimated the vice hall master’s power. Even if he had to sacrifice himself, he couldn’t allow Long Chen and Mo Nian to perish alongside him.

Xing Wujiang was incredibly anxious. He was burning his ancestral mark and couldn’t stop, or everything would be for nothing.

BOOM!

The vice hall master’s flame ring once more struck Mo Nian’s chain net. At this moment, a sacred chanting reverberated throughout heaven and earth, amplifying the tension of the moment.
