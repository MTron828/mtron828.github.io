Chapter 3531

Long Chen transformed into a bolt of lightning that shot through the Soaring Dragon Company’s blockade. He had long since been prepared.

However, he had also been prepared for Wu Yang, Zhao Qingxuan, and the others. But they didn’t appear to block him. Instead, it was these stubborn fellows from the Soaring Dragon Company.

Long Chen now knew that while Wu Yang and the others wanted to kill him, they seemed to view the Heavenly Flame Spirits as more important. Too many people were present for this opening of the Heavenly Flame World, so they couldn’t go back empty-handed.

Thus, after charging through their blockade, Long Chen didn’t tarry. He immediately rushed into the depths.

The Heavenly Flame World was chaotic. There was no sun, no moon, and no stars. But there were two directions that were easy to distinguish.

One was the entrance; a giant whirlpool could be seen there. The other direction also had a whirlpool, but it was thousands of times bigger than the one Long Chen had entered through.

That place was the depths of the Heavenly Flame World, the place where the Heavenly Flame Spirits appeared. That was everyone’s target.

Long Chen then activated the movement art of the Lightning Falcon race, shooting through the air. He was incredibly quick, catching up to some experts up ahead in just a moment.

Those experts were startled. Seeing Long Chen charging past, they wanted to attack him, but he was too fast. Before their attacks even landed, he was already out of sight.

However, the Heavenly Flame World was gigantic. Long Chen didn’t see Wu Yang, Zhao Mingxuan, and the others. He didn't know if it was because they weren’t on the same path as him, or if they had flying boats that were even faster than him.

As Long Chen rushed through the air, he vaguely sensed a streak of divine light flying in the distance. That aura seemed to be from Yu Qingxuan’s war chariot. But he was too far, and the feeling was too indistinct.

Long Chen couldn’t bother with it that much. As he sped through the air, he saw fewer and fewer people. Furthermore, as he got closer to the whirlpool, it grew larger in his vision.

Long Chen flew at full power for six hours. That whirlpool seemed right in front of him, and yet it was always too far to touch. It was simply enormous.

Looking back at the whirlpool that he had entered from, he saw that it was as tiny as a bean. The size difference between the two was truly enormous.

Furthermore, the closer he got to the whirlpool, the denser the flame energy in the air. Huo Linger was already impatient and transformed into runes that stuck on Long Chen’s body, absorbing this flame energy.

Long Chen rushed for a full day until he was finally unable to keep going. The air here was dense. Even with the naked eye, it was possible to see flame runes in the air.

Long Chen felt like he was in a sea of flames. As for Huo Linger, she was exceptionally excited. She was like a dragon returning to the sea, a tiger returning to its mountain forest. She was absorbing the energy here freely.

Before this, due to merging with the Ice Soul Divine Flame, she had used up a great deal of her energy. Although she had managed to gain a trace of the Ice Soul Divine Flame’s power, that energy had not fully recovered.

Now, she was rapidly replenishing her energy stores. This world seemed to belong to her. Here, she was free. She felt better than ever.

Long Chen rested a bit before continuing deeper into the depths. It was just as he expected.

This place was simply enormous. Even though there were tens of millions of flame cultivators rushing in the same direction, he didn’t see a single one.

Furthermore, Yu Qingxuan said that every time the Heavenly Flame World descended, the terrain would be different. Thus, there was no map for this place.

No one knew where the Heavenly Flame Spirits were. They could only rely on themselves to look for them. When Long Chen truly got close to that whirlpool, he finally found that this place seemed to be a completely different world.

All kinds of berserk energy were clashing and merging here. These energies were all flame energy, but these flame energies were split into millions of kinds. They were chaotic, lawless, attacking and rejecting each other.

Sometimes there would be some flame runes in one place, and then just after crossing a single mountain, the flame runes would be different. It was like all kinds of flames were vying for supremacy here, all of them fighting to live.

BOOM!

Long Chen heard a muffled sound in the distance, as well as a miserable cry. Long Chen then rushed over in the direction of that sound.

As a result, after flying a full incense stick’s worth of time, he finally saw a ravaged battlefield as well as bloodstains.

Long Chen touched the blood on the ground. “A late stage Divine Lord of the human race with impressive Blood Qi.”

Looking at the vestiges, Long Chen was surprised. The portions of the ground that had crumbled were not caused by that human expert. It seemed that the human expert had been sneak attacked and killed here. Not even their corpse remained.

Long Chen then saw a giant footprint and didn’t recognize what lifeform it belonged to. Other than that person’s aura, he didn’t sense any odd auras.

“It seems that there was a Heavenly Flame Spirit here. Just as Yu Qingxuan said, they really are vicious. They took that person’s life in one blow.” L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

Long Chen’s gaze shone brightly. Not daring to be careless, he flew a few circles in the vicinity but didn’t notice the tracks of any mysterious lifeform. Helpless, he continued onward.

What left Long Chen depressed was that he saw several recent battlefields, but it seemed that people had either been killed by the Heavenly Flame Spirits or been subdued by them, leaving him with nothing.

Long Chen was starting to panic a bit. It couldn’t be that his damnable bad luck was about to activate at this time, right? If he really was so unlucky to not run into a single Heavenly Flame Spirit, then there would have been no point in coming here.

Just as Long Chen was grumbling inside, he heard explosions in the distance. Long Chen immediately rushed off in that direction. Even if he couldn’t run into one, he’d need to think of a way to benefit from others.

As expected, he quickly saw an expert with overflowing devil qi fighting some fierce tiger wrapped in flames.

That tiger was exceptionally ferocious. As its sharp claws pierced through the air, large ripples would appear in the void. The power of its claws was comparable to a World King’s attack.

“This is a Heavenly Flame Spirit? What pure flame energy!” Long Chen was pleasantly surprised when he saw the tiger. This was his first time seeing a Heavenly Flame Spirit.

This Heavenly Flame Spirit was like Huo Linger and Lei Linger. It represented a pure concentration of energy.

“It has one kind of rune on it. In other words, its power is comparable to an ordinary first Heavenstage World King.” Long Chen carefully examined the tiger and found that while it had countless runes shining on it, they were all of one form.

Before entering the Heavenly Flame World, Yu Qingxuan had explained some differences between the power levels of the Heavenly Flame Spirits to make sure Long Chen didn’t accidentally target the wrong one.

Just as Long Chen was observing the fight between the Heavenly Flame Spirit and the devil expert, Long Chen noticed someone stealthily sneaking over not too far from him.

“Someone is snatching my business?!”
