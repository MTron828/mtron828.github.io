Chapter 4740 Trouble Caused by Face

“These two bracelets have been rubbed repeatedly to make them clean,” said Long Chen as he examined the bracelet in his hand.0

“Long Chen, what is going on? Get back to the point!” urged Bai Shishi when Long Chen suddenly changed the topic.0

Long Chen continued, “Every crevice of the runes on this bracelet has been cleaned perfectly. There’s not even the slightest smudge left…”0

“Long Chen, I’m going to get angry.”3

However, Long Chen ignored her and continued, “But no matter how it is cleaned, even if special perfumes are used on it, it cannot cover the smell of blood.”3

“The smell of blood?” questioned Bai Shishi as she grabbed the other bracelet.1

The moment she touched it, its runes lit up, and metal energy in the surroundings fluctuated intensely. However, Bai Shishi ignored it, her eyes locked onto every rune on it.0

“Liar. I don’t sense anything,” said Bai Shishi eventually.0

Long Chen shook his head. “I don't know what method the vice palace master used, but he intentionally erased the traces so that you wouldn’t detect them. However, I have been in a storm of blood ever since stepping into the cultivation world. He might be able to keep it from you, but not from me. These bracelets bear the vice palace master’s blood. Despite his thorough cleaning, traces of his blood remain. This suggests that the amount of blood that stained the bracelets was so significant that it was impossible to wipe out the vestiges. These bracelets are Saint items, so even the essence blood of a Saint would not be able to invade it. Unless…”0

“Unless what?” asked Bai Shishi urgently.0

“Unless, at that time, the vice palace master was near death, and his powerful will to survive forced his essence blood to carve out all its potential to survive. That’s the only way it could infect these bracelets so deeply,” replied Long Chen.2

“Long Chen… are you telling me the truth? Are you really not lying? You’re not making a story to improve my relationship with my father, right?” asked Bai Shishi slowly.0

“I wouldn’t lie to my beloved woman,” answered Long Chen as he looked into Bai Shishi’s eyes sincerely.1

“Long Chen…”1

Bai Shishi suddenly burst into tears and collapsed into Long Chen’s arms, crying like an aggrieved child. All her emotions poured out. Seeing her like this, Long Chen couldn’t find the words to console her and just silently held her, letting her cry.0

“Long Chen, what am I supposed to do? What can I do?” sobbed Bai Shishi.0

“What do you have to do?” asked Long Chen.0

“Ever since I was a child, I couldn’t understand why my mother would be willing to share a man with another woman. Hence, I looked down on both of them. But now I’m walking down the same path as my mother, and I’ve gone even further…”21

Long Chen nearly chuckled at Bai Shishi’s use of the phrase “gone even further,” but he restrained himself, knowing that any laughter would likely trigger Bai Shishi's anger. How had she ended up choosing such words?3

“Now I don’t even dare to face them. What if they laugh at me? What if they look down on me? Why did he still do this for me? What am I supposed to do? Tell me what I’m supposed to do?” asked Bai Shishi through sobs.0

Only then did Long Chen grasp the depth of Bai Shishi’s turmoil. It appeared that her pride prevented her from facing her father, especially considering her adherence to monogamy, which she had now seemingly strayed far from.3

Bai Zhantang naturally didn’t like Long Chen, given his strong-minded daughter had been won over by a little brat like him. It was only natural for him to not favor Long Chen.6

Indeed, Long Chen was like a source of problems for the father and daughter. Because of him, Bai Shishi was unable to face her father. After all, just how proud had she been back then? Now, his presence served as a constant reminder, akin to a slap in her own face.0

“It’s all your fault!” Bai Shishi punched Long Chen’s chest a couple of times, looking ashamed and vexed.3

“It really is all my fault. How about this? I’ll only marry you,” said Long Chen.3

“You dare?!” This sentence shocked Bai Shishi out of her crying.4

However, seeing his smile, she realized that he was teasing her. Hence, she grew even redder and beat him with her fists. “What are you smiling about? Think of something for me! What should I do? He almost lost his life to send me this gift, and I still treated him like that. He’s definitely hurt.”4

By the end, she was sobbing again. If she was Bai Zhantang, her heart would be broken.0

“Don’t worry about it. Leave it to me. I’ll handle it,” promised Long Chen.0

“How can you deal with it?” asked Bai Shishi as she wiped away her tears, looking at him questioningly.0

“I have my ways. Just leave it to me, okay? Do you trust me?” 0

“If I didn’t trust you, who else could I trust?” Bai Shishi glared at him.1

“Okay then. Let me put on these bracelets for you. Wow, your hands are so pretty! Like shining snow, soft and tender. They’re softer than silk…” Long Chen gently rubbed Bai Shishi's hand, momentarily forgetting about the bracelets.2

“You really are a dislikable man!” Bai Shishi remarked, her face flushed as she playfully pushed away Long Chen's hands.0

Long Chen smiled and carefully placed the bracelets on Bai Shishi. Once they were on her wrist, they automatically shrank, their runes flowing swiftly before gradually melding into Bai Shishi's skin.1

“These bracelets contain a metal attribute cultivation technique and divine abilities!” exclaimed Bai Shishi. As those runes poured into her, countless scenes flashed through her mind.0

These bracelets had a shocking origin—a priceless legacy from a sect. She had no idea how Bai Zhantang had managed to obtain them. Now, she felt even more grateful to him, which then led to feeling even more guilt.0

Bai Shishi hesitated and then clenched her teeth. “Long Chen, should I apologize to him?” 0

“Can you do that?” asked Long Chen.4

Bai Shishi instantly looked like a deflated balloon; her bravery vanished without a trace.0

“There’s no need to do so. I told you to leave it to me,” said Long Chen as he stood up. 0Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“How are you going to do it?” asked Bai Shishi worriedly.1

Long Chen patted Evilmoon on his back. “Problems between men are always resolved with martial might. I’m going to have a competition with him. If I win, his beloved daughter will be married to me.”0

“And if you lose?” asked Bai Shishi nervously.1

“Then I’ll marry his beloved daughter,” answered Long Chen mischievously.9

“I’m being serious!” 0

“Alright. I have my own means. But it wouldn’t be effective if I told you about it. Just wait here for the good news!” comforted Long Chen.1

Hearing Long Chen implore her, she felt a sweet warmth inside of her heart. She had always been stubborn and competitive, so the feeling of being protected instead made her feel warm and steady.1

As Long Chen walked out, he stretched his waist.0

“Tch, what kind of person have I, Long Chen, not faced? Just watch as I deal with him.”4

Long Chen headed straight for Bai Zhantang’s residence.
