Chapter 4611: Familiar Divine Statue

In front of the temple, hundreds of seven-star Doyens from the Three Eye race stood guard, fully locking down the entrance. Amidst them, a woman encased in chains of flame caught Long Chens attention.

This woman was none other than Yu Qingxuan. Her Heavenly Rainbow Flame was blazing around her, forming multiple layers of shields that were blocking the flame chains.

In response, the Three Eye experts were forming hand seals and chanting the Nirvana Scripture.

As the group chanted, the temple started to tremble ominously. Their flames surged higher, and ancient runes danced around the chains. With each passing moment, the chains tightened, exerting relentless pressure on Yu Qingxuans barriers.

Foolish human, give up now and submit to the slave mark! Thats your only chance of getting out alive!

Well give you to the divine son. As for whether you live or die, itll be up to your luck.

The Three Eye experts shouted their demands as they saw that Yu Qingxuan was about to be captured. However, their chanting slowed slightly as they wanted to capture her alive.

Yu Qingxuan seethed with anger. Never had she anticipated that this temple would turn out to be a trap. The instant she approached it, countless chains sprang forth. She would have been able to dodge all the chains, but then these Three Eye experts thwarted her effort.

They had conjured a flame net that seamlessly merged with the flame chains of the temple, instantly trapping her and leaving her with no chance to escape.

Foolish woman, if youre going to be so stubborn, dont blame us for being merciless

Just as that Three Eye expert spoke, before they could even do anything, a resounding dragon cry echoed through the air. In a blur of movement, a dragon tail lashed out, instantly turning them into blood mist.

Long Chen! Yu Qingxuan exclaimed in relief as she caught sight of his figure emerging from the dissipating mist. However, her joy quickly turned to concern as she cried out, Dont come any closer! This temple is a trap!

Ignoring her warning, Long Chen rushed forward and seized the chains in front of her. With a deafening roar, an explosion ensued, and Long Chen was forcefully propelled backward, crashing into a nearby building with devastating force.

Dazed and battered, Long Chen almost spat out blood.

Long Chen, you have to run while you can! There are definitely more people Yu Qingxuan's urgent plea was cut short as her focus wavered, causing one of her protective barriers to shatter under the relentless assault. With only two shields remaining, she found herself struggling to even summon the strength to speak as the flame chains constricted around her.

Enraged by this sight, Long Chen roared with determination, a cascade of stars enveloping him as he prepared to charge forward once more.

Fool, use your right hand! scolded the Earth Cauldron.

Startled, he suddenly thought of the Jewel Blood Jade Orchid image in his right palm.

When Long Chen placed his right hand on top of the flame chains, his hand only felt warm, and the Jewel Blood Jade Orchid image lit up.

BOOM!

The chains ensnaring Yu Qingxuan abruptly exploded, eliciting expressions of relief from both her and Long Chen. Without hesitation, he directly grabbed her and pulled her away from this trap.

Before Long Chen could go far, the surrounding space collapsed around them, engulfing them in a swirling vortex.

The next moment, Long Chen and Yu Qingxuan appeared in a large hall. Ignoring their surroundings, he immediately turned to Yu Qingxuan, concern etched on his face as he asked, Are you alright? Are you injured somewhere?

Seeing how concerned Long Chen was, Yu Qingxuan hugged him tightly. Long Chen was startled by this response but immediately held onto her tightly. In his mind, everything was alright as long as she was fine.

Long Chen, when are you going to get smarter? Dont be so reckless! I was scared to death just now! Holding Long Chen tightly, Yu Qingxuan finally started crying. She had shouted at Long Chen to leave. While she knew that he wouldnt leave, at the very least, he should have known that this place was a trap.

At that time, Long Chen seemed to have gone crazy and didnt care about anything, charging forward regardless of anything. While Yu Qingxuan was moved, she was also worried for him.

Im usually very cool-headed about these things, but when I see you in danger, my head just stops working. Long Chen scratched his head with embarrassment.

In truth, it was just as he said. The instant he witnessed Yu Qingxuan in peril, rational thought fled from his mind. At that moment, nothing else mattered to him but ensuring her safety.

If it hadnt been for the Earth Cauldrons reminder, he would still be struggling with the chains. Thinking back to it, he really was a fool.

Yu Qingxuan bit her lip, her eyes full of warmth as she looked at Long Chen. After all, he was her whole world.

This place is

Only now did Long Chen and Yu Qingxuan pause to survey their surroundings, taking in the grandeur of the temple hall that enveloped them.

Suddenly, the entire hall lit up. Runes on the bricks, pillars, and roof lit up like stars, casting the hall in a holy light.

Long Chens gaze turned to the front where they saw a divine statue. However, a tremor coursed through Long Chen as he laid eyes upon it.

Its her

Before them stood a statue of a woman, seated gracefully upon a lotus throne with her hands delicately positioned in front of her chest, palms upturned as if cradling something within. Her slender fingers resembled the petals of a lotus in full bloom, and it seemed that she was holding something.

Although her eyes were closed, it did not change her peerless beauty. She was like a goddess who stood at the peak of the world, and everyone who saw her could only look up and revere her.

Long Chen had never seen this statue before, but he had encountered this woman in person. He recalled the profound love, gentleness, and warmth that radiated from her presence when he had spoken to her in person.

Looking at this statue, Long Chen was overcome with a bitter sense of longing. He ached to see her in the flesh, rather than as an immutable sculpture frozen in time. Yet, alongside this yearning, a harsh reality shattered his heart. He knew that she was gone forever, never to return.

To his astonishment, the Jewel Blood Jade Orchid suddenly left his palm and slowly floated toward her hands.Diiscover new ùíîtories at nùíêve/lbin(.)c/oùíé

In a sudden turn of events, the hands of the statue started to tremble, and a vivid Jewel Blood Jade Orchid materialized within its grasp. Unlike the imprinted image on Long Chens palm, this orchid seemed imbued with vibrant life, exuding an aura of vitality.

As the living Jewel Blood Jade Orchid ignited, golden flames erupted, enveloping every corner of the hall in a divine glow. The air also resonated with sacred chants, filling the space with an ethereal melody that echoed throughout the hallowed chamber.

Its the Nirvana Scripture! Long Chen and Yu Qingxuan exclaimed at the same time.
