Chapter 3207 Sea Devil

Long Chen’s thunderforce was like tentacles. Any corpse wrapped by his thunderforce was pulled into the primal chaos space.

Although Lei Linger was still refining the black swords sealed in his left eye, that didn’t prevent him from using thunderforce. This thunderforce might not be strong enough against a real expert, but it was more than enough to suck corpses into the primal chaos space.

Seeing Long Chen gather so many corpses in an instant made the experts on the walls jump. Although everyone had astral spaces, it wasn’t for corpses. Astral spaces were viewed as pure lands by most people, and these corpses would infect them with death spiritual qi. It would affect their karmic luck and maybe even reduce their longevity.

Thus, the immortal world’s experts did have astral spaces, but would also have spatial rings or spatial bags to store things.

But those spatial items had limits to how much they could store. Considering how huge these corpses were, they wouldn’t be able to fit too much before they were filled.

As for those top grade spatial rings, they were very expensive. People rarely spent money on such an extravagant thing. There were perhaps only ten to twenty such things in the Ying Prefecture because they were usually not more useful than ordinary spatial rings. 

After the last attack, the spatial rings that people used for these corpses were mostly full now. Usually those corpses were disposed of in some wilderness. Otherwise, even ignoring the rot, the smell would be too disgusting. If they weren’t moved, just the smell would choke the commoners of Ying Prefecture.

Long Chen flew across the wall, gathering all the corpses. The battlefield was instantly cleaned up.

As others were shocked, Long Chen was delighted. These corpses were quickly nourishing the Wood Foundation Divine Trees. They were gradually recovering. The dead medicinal ingredients were also coming back to life and flourishing.

His tribulation had shown him just how important the Wood Foundation Divine Trees were. If they had been strong enough, why would he have been forced to take the risk of using his Purgatory Eyes? As long as he could hold on long enough, Lei Linger would slowly manage to devour the black lightning.

Long Chen didn’t like the feeling of having all his trump cards used up. He preferred having everything under his control because his luck was always lacking. He didn’t like gambling, so he could only trust in his power. 

The Wood Foundation Divine Trees were his greatest protection. He had to do his best to nourish them as much as possible.

After gathering the corpses, Long Chen stood in the air, overlooking the battlefield. The majority of the Deep Sea Crocodile Bulls had already been slain. It wouldn’t be long before the remainders were wiped out.

As the Deep Sea Crocodile Bulls were slain, the army of the Ying Prefecture’s experts started to switch out. The regular Four Peak experts stepped into the battlefield.

Without the threat of the Deep Sea Crocodile Bulls, the other experts could join the fight. Considering how large this battlefield was, it couldn’t be left to just the top experts. They had to be given time to recover. Otherwise, continuous battles would exhaust their power, and if something unexpected happened, they wouldn’t be able to handle things.

Those experts were the core force of the battlefield. They had to be protected. Thus, on the battlefield, it was always the middle and lower level warriors that took the heaviest losses. There was no way around it. This was the cruelty of battle.

Time passed bit by bit. After six hours, the sea demons still showed no signs of stopping. More and more of them were coming out from the depths.

“Long Chen, you should have Qin Feng and Bai Xiaole rest a bit. The sea demons normally attack for three days at a time. The scale of this attack in particular is rather large, so it might last even longer. They’ve used up half their physical energy. They need a break.” Luo Xue and the others returned to Long Chen’s side covered in blood.

They had tried telling this directly to Qin Feng and Bai Xiaole, but they refused to listen, especially Bai Xiaole. He was too delighted by his control over these sea demons.

“You can rest. No need to bother with them. There won’t be any danger,” said Long Chen. He had his own calculations when it came to Bai Xiaole and Qin Feng.

“But that one…” Luo Xue looked at Xu Zixiong who was shouting even louder than the sea demons yet hadn’t killed more than a few of them. She was most worried about him.

He was truly foolish. Even with all his power, he had no idea how to properly use it. Xu Zixiong had come with Long Chen and the others. Moreover, Qin Feng killed those Deep Sea Crocodile Bulls with one stroke of his saber. After they were killed, he killed a whole mass of the other sea demons with each swing.

As for Bai Xiaole, there was even less that needed to be said about him. He was controlling the sea demons and directing them to kill each other. That was even more stunning.

In comparison, Xu Zixiong was incredibly weak. He couldn’t compare to Qin Feng and Bai Xiaole, or even the other Four Peak Primals. He was the weakest of them all, so he could only win back some confidence when comparing himself to ordinary Four Peak experts.

He seemed to have received a mental blow and was doing his best to kill those sea demons. But the results weren’t anything beyond ordinary. 

Considering how hard he was trying, he was definitely rapidly using up his energy. His aura was clearly starting to drop. If this continued, something unexpected could easily take his life. It had to be known that new sea demons might appear at any moment.

“It’s fine. He has been suppressed for a long time. His primal bloodline almost wasted away. If he doesn’t awaken it now, it will regress. It’s up to him to reawaken it,” said Long Chen indifferently.

He had known Wilde the longest, and so he had a certain understanding of the Barbarian race’s bloodline. Wilde had never formally awakened his bloodline, but his essence blood had already condensed chains.

On the other hand, Xu Zixiong had awakened his bloodline, but the runes in his bloodline were still scattered and couldn’t condense into a single link. There was no way he could unleash his full potential like that.

Thus, while his aura was shocking, his actual killing power was curiously low. This was a typical case of having power but no way to use it. The main reason was that those runes in his essence blood had yet to condense.

Practice was progress. Abandoning was regression. Xu Zixiong was forced to live like a bug in a crack in his home. He didn’t dare to show off at all for fear of drawing a calamity.

Thus, although Xu Zixiong had worked hard on his cultivation, he never had a chance to use it, resulting in even his primal runes starting to dissipate. Fortunately, he had come out now. If he had continued like that for three to five more years, his primal bloodline would be gone. This was his best chance to reawaken that bloodline.Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

He needed to get stronger. When that desire grew to a peak, his bloodline runes would sense his need and awaken.

Suddenly, a roar came from deep within the sea. That roar was like thunder from a clear sky, shaking the entire battlefield. Luo Xue and the others’ expressions changed.

“That’s… the deep sea devil race!
