Chapter 3711 Supreme Domain

Everyone clearly saw that just before stamping his foot down, Xia Chen reached out and attached a talisman to the bottom of his shoe.

Xia Chen’s foot then stamped into He Changtian’s chest. He was so fast that he didn’t give He Changtian a chance to react.

As for He Changtian, he was still in a defenseless posture after unleashing that back-arching attack. That wasn’t a position that was easy to move from, so Xia Chen’s foot solidly smashed into his chest.

BOOM!

It was like a volcano exploding. The talisman on the bottom of Xia Chen’s foot exploded, and Xia Chen himself was blown high into the sky from the explosion.

As for He Changtian, his chest caved in and he smashed into the ground like a meteorite. A huge ripple then erupted. Above the ripple was Xia Chen flying back, and below the ripple was He Changtian falling.

When the surrounding people saw that, their expressions changed. Some people decided to quickly retreat.

As He Changtian smashed into the ground, flames exploded in every direction. It was like a star exploding.

The earth quivered. However, there was no giant hole that people had anticipated. There was simply a slight depression with raging flames. Fortunately, the surrounding people had retreated quickly, or they would have been caught up by those flames.

This was the Violet Flame Heaven Capital. The earth had special laws protecting it, so the ground was far tougher. Even the ruins left behind from long ago were very difficult to damage.

At this moment, He Changtian coughed up three mouthfuls of blood. The place where his chest had caved in slowly rose again, and he returned to his original appearance.

“The Heavenly Ruler Seal Battle Armor’s reputation is not for nothing. Even such a terrifying attack is unable to damage it in the slightest.” People looked at the perfectly intact battle armor, as well as He Changtian whose aura had not weakened in the slightest.

They didn’t know how powerful Xia Chen’s attack was exactly, but based on the ear-splitting explosion and the ripple that appeared, it was clearly no ordinary attack.

It had to be known that He Changtian had not had any defenses at the time. He had simply been struck just like that. Without this battle armor, he probably would have died.

At the same time as people sighed over the Heavenly Ruler Seal Battle Armor’s power, they were also awestruck by the power of this talisman cultivator. They had heard of talisman cultivators but had never seen one actually fight. Xia Chen’s talismans were terrifying.

Now they knew why Xia Chen could look so harmless yet give off such an immense sense of pressure. That pressure didn’t come from him but from his talismans.

“You damnable bastard! You’ve really pissed me off! An idiot that relies entirely on external power also dares to show off?!” He Changtian roared furiously.

The crown on his head had long since fallen, and his hair was a mess. His blood ignited into mist as soon as he spat it out.

Following his roar, that blood was like gunpowder that ignited the surrounding space instantly. A majestic Supreme aura unfurled.

“He’s igniting his Supreme Blood?!”

Startled cries rang out. What He Changtian had just spat out was his core essence blood. He was actually igniting that precious essence blood.

It had to be known that Supreme Blood was incomparably precious. It could not be lost without consequences, especially at this time when He Changtian had to maintain his max essence blood in preparation for breaking through to the Immortal King realm.

At this moment, the void beneath He Changtian’s feet exploded and his battle armor blazed. Every scale had its own rune, but now those runes transformed into ancient beasts. It was as if they had come to life. As all their power was being offered up, He Changtian’s power soared by several times.

By sacrificing his essence blood to activate the Heavenly Ruler Seal Battle Armor, he drew out its terrifying power. He now looked like a flame god and once more shot toward Xia Chen.

People could see that this battlefield had become He Changtian’s domain. Endless flames whirled about, blocking Xia Chen’s retreat path. They even pushed him toward He Changtian.

“External power? What a huge joke. As long as it’s a power that I control, it is my power. Your flame energy mostly comes from the Heavenly Daos. Is that not external power? If you want to fight, then let’s fight. Where did so many useless words come from?” Xia Chen sneered. Even in front of He Changtian in this state, he was unafraid.

Xia Chen was overflowing with battle intent. It was like he had returned to the time on the Martial Heaven Continent when he followed Long Chen in battles against all their enemies. The stronger the opponents, the more excited he grew.

“Let’s see how you teleport around in my Supreme domain!” shouted He Changtian, his spear suddenly dancing through the air. Spear-images pierced toward Xia Chen.

He Changtian’s original flame domain wasn’t strong enough to stop Xia Chen from using consecutive transportations throughout it.Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

However, now he was burning his Supreme Blood, and it caused his domain to be connected to the Supreme Blood in his body. If Xia Chen used his transportation art again, He Changtian would instantly know his location and would be able to predict where Xia Chen was going in advance. He had completely broken Xia Chen’s technique, forcing him into a direct clash.

“Your domain is far weaker than Liao Bencang’s faith domain. If I want to use spatial transportation inside of it, can you even stop me? Also, did you think that talisman cultivators don’t dare to face people in combat directly? I’ll show you a talisman cultivator’s true power today,” sneered Xia Chen.

When Xia Chen mentioned Liao Bencang, countless experts were shocked. The name of the Nine Underworld Hall’s master was known to almost everyone. Had Xia Chen previously fought Liao Bencang?

“Dragon Blood Battle Armor!”

Xia Chen roared and a sacred dragon cry rang out, resounding throughout heaven and earth. After that, a layer of golden dragon scales appeared on Xia Chen, and a holy dragon might radiated from him.

“Boss, when did Xia Chen…?!” Guo Ran jumped in shock.

“Did you think that I would only favor you? Xia Chen never abandoned the Dragon Blood Body Tempering Art. I gave him the true dragon essence blood, and he gradually merged with it. Do you think everyone is like you and would require such a fuss?” demanded Long Chen irritably.

Although Xia Chen was a talisman cultivator, focused on pursuing runic arts, he had always kept up with the Dragon Blood Body Tempering Art. Furthermore, his dragon blood could be merged with his talismans before permeating into his body. This was a very simple and painless method to train.

Xia Chen naturally wouldn’t tell Guo Ran about this method because Guo Ran would feel that it was unfair. Thus, Guo Ran hadn’t known about Xia Chen merging with Long Chen’s true dragon essence blood.

Xia Chen was covered in golden scales, and his Blood Qi soared. He seemed like an entirely different person now. His powerful Blood Qi shook countless people’s hearts.

“This… this is a talisman cultivator?!”

Everyone was stunned. How could a talisman cultivator possess such terrifying Blood Qi? That toppled their understanding.

BOOM!

Just as everyone was stunned, Xia Chen actually let out a simple punch at He Changtian’s mighty attack.

“What?!”
