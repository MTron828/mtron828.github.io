Chapter 4296: Supreme Heavenly Eye

“What? Are you looking down on your father? Do you feel like your father is now half-crippled?” Long Zhantian smiled.

“Chen-er wouldn’t dare…” said Long Chen hastily.

Long Zhantian smiled comfortingly. “I’m joking. You don’t need to be so nervous.”

All of a sudden, Long Zhantian sighed and gazed into the distance.

“Chen-er, do you know what the greatest power in this world is?”

Long Chen was startled. “No.”

After all, Long Chen’s understanding of power was constantly being broken. There were instances when he believed something to be the pinnacle of strength, only to encounter something even mightier right after that. He really didn’t know the answer to this question.

“The strongest power is Nirvana,” said Long Zhantian.

“The phoenix race’s power?”

“No, Nirvana is Nirvana. It does not belong to a single race. In this world, it is not just the phoenix that can undergo nirvanic rebirth. The so-called Nirvana is to not lower your head in front of fate, to not lose yourself when you are lost, to not abandon hope in despair, to persevere and find your own light,” said Long Zhantian as he looked at Long Chen. “Back on the Martial Heaven Continent, I encountered a similar situation. At that time, I was struck by a devil curse, and my cultivation base was lost. Every moment felt like a hellish torture. At that time, only your mother stayed by my side. She constantly supported me, believing that I would be able to pass through that moment. At that time, she gave me a verse, and it was that verse that allowed me to survive the days of torment in the Long clan. ‘The weight of the snow presses the branch to the ground. But when the sun rises, the snow melts, and the branch springs back to the heavens.’”

“When the sun rises, the snow melts, and the branch springs back to the heavens…” Long Chen murmured. He then looked at his father with admiration. Both his father and mother were truly exceptionally talented.

“Chen-er, remember this verse from your mother. In life, a person cannot just gallop through like a horse across a plain. There will be mountains, and there will be valleys. When you are in the valley, you cannot become lost and afraid. You must persevere. You must believe that your sun will appear,” said Long Zhantian firmly.

Long Chen nodded. It would be difficult to forget such a powerful verse.

“Come Chen-er. Guard me,” said Long Zhantian.

Upon hearing this, Long Chen’s heart shook. He knew what his father wanted to do.

The two of them then came to a desolate valley. This place was still in the territory of the branch academy, but the academy had yet to be fully reconstructed, so this place was still empty.

As Long Zhantian opened a crystal bottle, a flow of seven-color blood spilled forth, instantly causing this world to quiver with its appearance. After all, this seven-color Supreme Blood had been nourished by primal chaos qi, so it contained a terrifying power that filled Long Chen with trepidation.

He knew that his father wanted to reclaim his essence blood. However, it had been out of his body for too long and had grown up on its own. Thus, Long Chen was worried that his father would not be able to control it.

“Chen-er, don’t worry. Everything is under control.” Seeing his son’s nervous expression, Long Zhantian smiled and indicated for him to not be so nervous.

The seven-color Supreme Blood, once freed from the confines of the bottle, hung suspended in the air, as though it were uncertain of its path. But suddenly, it surged toward Long Zhantian, causing his body to tremble. Following this, his aura began to crazily climb.

BOOM!

An explosive sound came from within Long Zhantian’s body, akin to something shattering. The next moment, the nine heavens rumbled and tribulation clouds gathered.

“Breakthrough?”

Long Chen couldn’t help but feel pleasantly surprised. A single bottle of this blood had allowed Long Zhantian to instantly break the confines of the Divine Flame realm. As a result, his Four Peak tribulation directly descended upon him.

What truly left Long Chen astounded was the complete lack of resistance exhibited by this seven-color Supreme Blood as it seamlessly merged back into Long Zhantian's body. It didn’t fight him at all, leaving Long Chen in utter disbelief.

Following that, seven-colored lightning rained down. Looking up, Long Chen was amazed to see that the scope of Long Zhantian’s heavenly tribulation was even larger than his own Four Peak tribulation.

Suddenly, Long Zhantian raised his right hand, conjuring a seven-colored sword within his grip. This was the Seven Peak Sword, identical in every way to the one Long Chen had summoned.

Long Zhantian’s Seven Peak Sword actually gave off an Eternal Qi as he slashed it at the heavenly tribulation. In an instant, the tribulation clouds shattered, transforming into lightning runes.

Long Zhantian then formed one-handed seals, filling the sky with seven-colored divine radiance that captured all the lightning runes like a net.

As the lightning runes flooded into Long Zhantian’s body, his frail body grew stronger and more robust, causing heroic air to thrum around him.

Every trace of the lightning was absorbed by Long Zhantian, without leaving a single drop behind. Most importantly, even though he had just advanced, not a hint of his aura leaked out. He didn’t seem like someone who had just advanced at all as his aura was shockingly concentrated.

“As expected, with his blood nourished by primal chaos qi, Dad is essentially cultivating with primal chaos qi in the Divine Flame realm, having the same condition as experts of the primal chaos era.” Long Chen was incredibly excited by this discovery. His father had truly benefited from this calamity.

It was no wonder his heavenly tribulation was so terrifying. Just as the dragon expert said, against the experts from the primal chaos era, Long Chen could only say that he was born in the wrong era.

Long Zhantian once more absorbed a bottle of seven-color Supreme Blood, and his body rumbled as his aura broke through.

First Heavenstage of Four Peak, second Heavenstage, third Heavenstage… he directly broke through to the eighth Heavenstage. After that, he opened another bottle.

BOOM!

As Long Zhantian’s aura broke through to the Divine Lord realm, heaven and earth quivered, and tribulation clouds covered the sky once again.

The next moment, countless seven-colored lightning swords rained down from those tribulation clouds.

BOOM!

Just like before, Long Zhantian swung the Seven Peak Sword, cleaving the entire sky apart along with the tribulation clouds. Their lightning runes were then obediently absorbed by Long Zhantian.

Within the span of a few breaths, the entire expanse of lightning-filled skies was completely absorbed by Long Zhantian, without a single drop going to waste.

Long Chen watched in sheer bewilderment. Despite considering himself experienced, he had never witnessed a method of undergoing tribulation as extraordinary as this.

Long Zhantian continued to stand in his original position, his eyes closed, resembling a statue. Yet, he gave off a feeling as if he was on top of the nine heavens, gazing down at the world below.

Long Zhantian slowly expelled a mouthful of turbid qi from his body. When he opened his eyes again, seven-colored markings had appeared in his pupils, with the sun and moon seemingly radiating within them. It was as if the ten thousand Daos were manifesting within his gaze.

“Supreme Heavenly Eye!”

Long Chen cried out in shock. His father had actually awakened this legendary divine pupil. Moreover, the Supreme Heavenly Eye could even be considered superior to the Six Dao Heavenly Eye. Long Chen found it almost unbelievable, even as he witnessed it with his own eyes.
