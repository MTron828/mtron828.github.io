Chapter 2746 The One From Back Then

It was Long Aotian who had come with endless heavenly might. A trace of an Emperor’s aura exuded from his body. With a wave of his hand, the void was torn asunder and the Heavenly Daos were suppressed.

Long Aotian was furious. He had been in the midst of breaking through to the twelfth Heavenstage, the Emperor realm. But at that critical time, he had been disturbed and had no choice but to cease his breakthrough. Furthermore, he paid quite a price just to stabilize his realm at the half-step Emperor realm.

In his fury, he directly killed the two people who had disturbed him. He then activated a soulsearch to learn what had happened.

After that, when he saw his mother nailed to a pillar, screaming, his hair stood on end from fury. He immediately attacked, not holding anything back.

Seeing him arrive, Long Chen smiled coldly. Even if Long Aotian was already a half-step Emperor, Long Chen still didn’t fear this opponent that he had defeated.

Long Chen grabbed Long Aotian’s mother from the stone pillar and turned her into a meat shield in front of him.

“Long Chen, you’re despicable!”

Long Aotian was furious, not expecting Long Chen to actually use his mother as a shield. He hastily pulled back the power of his dragon spear.

As a result, he coughed up blood. A full-power attack could not be pulled back at the last minute like that. It was a taboo in battle. He had essentially just attacked himself.

Staggering back, Long Aotian wiped some blood off of his mouth. He pointed his spear at Long Chen angrily.

“If you’re a man, you’ll have an honorable battle with me!”

“Honorable? Hahaha!” Long Chen laughed thunderously. He disdainfully said, “I’m amazed you could say such a word from your mouth. Did this slut act honorably toward my mother back then? Your entire family is so evil that they didn’t even let off a newly born baby. They took my Spirit Blood, Spirit Root, and Spirit Bone, placing them in your body. For your own plots, you’ve left me to suffer, causing me to be separated from my parents. It’s unknown if they’re even alive. My father and mother were strong enough that all the experts of the divine families were unable to suppress them without using despicable tricks. How was that honorable? Was that the act of a man? It seems that other than my father and myself, the Long family doesn’t have another real man.”

Long Chen’s voice contained the power of his astral energy, and it thundered out of the formation sealing this place, spreading throughout every corner of the divine families.

The disciples of the divine families were startled to hear this. They had no idea what had happened back then. Those that had been alive back then had been told to hide by the higher-ups. Hence, only now did the disciples learn about Long Chen’s origins.

They were all aware of his name, but not that he had been the main character of the huge secret that had become taboo in the divine families from back then. Although the divine families had locked down all the information about it and had not permitted people to discuss it, who wouldn’t be curious about such a major affair? While no one dared to talk about it openly, there were plenty of people discussing it behind closed doors. But since only the core members knew about it, and since over ninety percent of the divine families’ experts had died overnight, all people could come up with were countless guesses.

There were many guesses, many versions of various stories. However, the ones who knew the truth couldn’t say anything because they didn’t dare to.

Of course, during Long Chen’s tribulation, some people had seen some threads relating to this story. Now that Long Chen had fully uncovered this secret, the mystery of Long Zhantian and Luo Ningshuang’s sudden disappearance also became clear.

People were filled with disbelief. Although they had heard countless hypotheses, the truth was far bloodier, far crueler than they could have guessed. They couldn’t accept such a thing.

The official story that the divine families announced was that a divine devil that they had been sealing had broken free, and all their experts had fought to the death to slay it. Supposedly, Long Zhantian and Luo Ningshuang had been killed by it.

With this tragedy exposed, as disciples of the divine families, they couldn’t believe that their higher-ups would be so devoid of conscience.

In the Divine Pill Division, the Pill Doyen stood at the peak of a pavilion, his hands clasped behind him. He stared into the depths of the ancestral lands, at the ancestral palace that Long Chen was in. There was a slightly complicated look in his eyes.

“How unexpected. Truly unexpected…”

Ye Qian was standing beside the Pill Doyen, staring as well. He was filled with shock.

It was unknown if he thought it was unexpected that the divine families had been so shameless back then, or if it was unexpected that Long Chen could escape.

“Qian-er, make your preparations. We will not participate in this matter,” said the Pill Doyen.

“Yes.”

Ye Qian nodded and left. The Pill Doyen muttered to himself, “As expected, someone with the Pill Sovereign’s Divine Radiance won’t die so easily. The Divine Pill Division will not be dragged down by this. Leaving a path to retreat leaves room for the future.”

…

The higher-ups of the divine families all had ugly expressions now. Long Chen’s voice had spread throughout the divine families, essentially ripping open a painful scar.

“Long Chen, since you admit that you are a member of the Long family, do you think that your actions today are appropriate? You have no idea the cause of what happened back then. Why do you think you could leave alive? Wasn’t it because of us?!” shouted Deputy Elder Long angrily.

Long Chen was startled. It was true. He still had no idea how he had escaped that calamity. The Heaven Executioner also hadn’t known. Hence, his heart instantly fell.

“A person shouldn’t be so shameless. Does the reason Long Chen could escape have the slightest bit to do with you?”

Just at this moment, a voice rang out. Unexpectedly, it was Elder Long.

Deputy Elder Long angrily shouted, “Long Qiyao, have you gone mad?!”

He had always trusted Elder Long and viewed him highly despite his talent only being ordinary. He was sharp and most importantly extremely loyal. Hence, the Deputy Elder hadn’t expected him to suddenly come out now.

Elder Long slowly walked over to Long Chen. He said, “Seeing you already grown-up, I’m happy. It can be said that I accomplished my promise from back then. There is no longer any need to hide anything. It was my sons who managed to take you out, and my youngest who sent you away. I stole the Deputy Elder’s insignia back then and had my son disguise himself. He muddled his way into the Heaven Executioner’s abode to take you out. I had seven sons, and I personally watched as their spiritual plates shattered one by one. Fortunately, they accomplished their mission to send you away in the end.”

Elder Long’s voice was calm, but without being aware of it, tears were flowing down his cheek. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

Only now did Long Chen learn who the person that had saved him was. It was Elder Long and his sons.

“I retract what I just said. Other than my father and myself, the Long family has another real man.”

“Elder Qiyao, you traitor!”

The Deputy Elder was infuriated, pointing and cursing at Elder Long. He hadn’t expected that the one to leave this calamity alive was actually Elder Long.

Suddenly, a streak of light flew out, piercing the Deputy Elder’s head and killing him.
