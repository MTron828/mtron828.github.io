Chapter 2615 Not Giving a Chance

“Divine families have arrived!” said Evilmoon suddenly.

“Even in the Heavens’ Wrath state, you can keep an eye on the surroundings? How did you do this?” asked Long Chen.

“Do you think I’m the same as you? This is my second time experiencing this state. Naturally, I’ve gained some experience and resistance to the negative side effects,” snorted Evilmoon.

In truth, Evilmoon didn’t tell Long Chen that the dark evil dragon race had its own divine ability that was a bit similar to the Heavens’ Wrath state. The reason it had lost control the first time was to probe Long Chen’s reaction and test its power.

With the explosion from the first time experienced, controlling it the second time became easy. It was easy for it to control this anger.

However, there were benefits along with drawbacks. Because Evilmoon was able to keep its mind, entering this state would be more difficult every time. On the other hand, since Long Chen couldn’t control his anger, he had no limit as to how many times he could enter this state. He could enter it whenever he wanted.

“On the surface, they came to help us. In reality, they came to benefit from us. That or they’re once more trying to give a show of power. Let’s go. I can’t be bothered to watch their performance.” Long Chen snorted. He gathered the corpses and left.

The demonic beast race had finally started to frown upon seeing Long Chen slaughter the demon kings. They had ordered those at the demon king level to retreat behind the Sovereign seal.

Long Chen didn’t dare to enter the Sovereign seal, which was holding back the strong thirteenth rank demonic beasts. Thus, their only choice was to slowly exhaust him with the weaker demonic beasts. But Long Chen didn’t care about the weaker demonic beasts, so staying here was meaningless.

Long Chen had only just left when Feng Fei, Long Aotian, Ye Liangchen, and Jiang Wuchen arrived with millions of disciples. They closed ranks along the Sovereign seal, preventing the demonic beasts from retreating.

However, by that time, Long Chen was already gone, and the only thing left on the ground was blood.

“That bastard. I wanted to compete a bit, but he already fled.” Ye Liangchen ground his teeth. Even if he couldn’t fight with Long Chen this time, he wanted to compete in how fast they could kill demonic beasts.

However, Long Chen was gone, not giving him a chance to compete, infuriating him.

Four Sovereign sprouts had appeared at the same time, so the demon kings that had retreated behind the Sovereign seal didn’t dare to come back out. They just watched as the demonic beasts left behind were slaughtered.

Feng Fei, Long Aotian, Ye Liangchen, and Jiang Wuchen went out at the same time. With every wave of their hands, the earth was torn apart and blood flowed. Demonic beasts collapsed in huge numbers. Due to this, the demonic beast race was truly stunned. This was their first time seeing such a powerful display from the divine families.

Long Chen didn’t watch. He returned along his original path, arriving just in time to see Huo Linger and the eighth legion slaughtering demonic beasts.

Seeing him return safe and sound, Shen Chengfeng and the others finally relaxed. Once he was back, he led them out. That was because at this time, the divine families’ experts were pouring into the Ancient Battlefield. Long Chen didn’t want to compete with these small fries.

“Let’s split the profits. The corpses are mine, while the Neidan, crystal cores, and what-not are yours,” said Long Chen once they arrived at their camp.

“Long Chen, it’s a bit difficult…” Shen Chengfeng hesitated. If it was during normal times, he would be direct. But this time, they had gained so much that every person’s spatial ring was full. Those spatial rings were normally used to avoid arousing suspicion because what was stored inside could be accounted for. That was why despite having astral spaces, they used these spatial rings. This avoided any suspicion.

However, they had killed so many demonic beasts that they had been forced to use their astral spaces to gather the corpses after their spatial rings were full. Because of it, it was unclear just how many corpses every person had. There was also no way to investigate because investigating another person’s astral space was something exceedingly insulting, a great taboo for a cultivator.

As a result, how much people took out would depend on their own conscience. Shen Chengfeng already felt that this was unfair, but Long Chen had also said that he only wanted the corpses, which were the least valuable part of their gains right now. They had mountains of the crystal cores and Neidans, which was an astronomical sum.

“Don’t worry. We’re brothers. The corpses are enough for me,” said Long Chen.

Long Chen looked at the vice commanders and they immediately gave orders. The warriors got busy, taking out the corpses and removing the Neidans and crystal cores quickly.

Long Chen smiled slightly. Shen Chengfeng was truly steady. This was to show Long Chen how many crystal cores and Neidans there were so that he could see how much he was giving away.

It went without saying that Huo Linger was extremely capable. There was no way to count how many demonic beasts she had killed. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

The eighth legion’s warriors had picked up every corpse, even the ones that were badly burned, to the point that they didn’t let off even the random chunks of flesh.

Long Chen began to gather them into the primal chaos space. They were quickly absorbed, transforming into life energy that nourished the Heavenly Qilin Trees. They then grew once more.

In the end, there was so much that the black soil was unable to devour all of it. A giant mountain of corpses appeared in the primal chaos space.

After several hours, this mountain grew into a colossal size. The Heavenly Qilin Demon Trees had also crazily grown. It seemed that it would take some time before all these corpses were devoured.

After taking the corpses, Shen Chengfeng counted the crystal cores and Neidans. They had three billion of them. This was a number that they had never witnessed before. The majority of them belonged to twelfth rank demonic beasts, while some were thirteenth rank. They could exchange these for an ocean’s worth of points and treasures.

“We’re done splitting the profits. How you divide them up amongst yourselves is up to you. I’m going to leave first.” Long Chen didn’t give Shen Chengfeng a chance to push those crystal cores and Neidans on him. He immediately left, vanishing without a trace.

Hence, Shen Chengfeng and the others stared at the mountains of crystal cores and Neidans in shock. One of the vice commanders finally sighed, “We owe Long Chen far too much. We’ll never be able to pay it all back.”

The eighth legion was originally the weakest existence in the Heavenly Dragon Legion. However, because of Long Chen, their lives had changed.

Their collective power had easily entered the top three, but the ranking competition had yet to occur. They even had an urge to fight for first.

Now, Long Chen had sent them another astonishing gift. How could they not feel an undying loyalty to him?

Suddenly, Shen Chengfeng’s expression changed. He gathered the crystal cores and Neidans. In the next instant, Feng Fei, Long Aotian, Ye Liangchen, and Jiang Wuchen arrived with their army.

“What did you just put away? Why are you being so sneaky?” barked Jiang Wuchen.

Jiang Wuchen and the others had already finished killing the demonic beasts throughout the battlefield. Just as they were investigating if there were any remnants, they saw the eighth legion. They then rushed over just in time to see Shen Chengfeng put something away.

Jiang Wuchen was instantly displeased, feeling like Shen Chengfeng was hiding something from them.

“Reporting to senior Wuchen, we were just tidying up some spoils of battle. You were so fast that I didn’t even sense you. I had no intention of hiding anything,” responded Shen Chengfeng.

“Spoils of battle? The few of you were actually able to gain something?” Jiang Wuchen snorted. It was like he was questioning suspects.

Shen Chengfeng’s expression sank. Jiang Wuchen had not liked the eighth legion for a long time, and Ye Liangchen was the same. That was naturally due to how the eighth legion had gone against orders back in the Star Field Divine World.

After that, Shen Chengfeng took a deep breath and suppressed his anger. “We aren’t qualified to gain from this battle. However, Long Chen came to support us. He killed a few demonic beasts and left us the parts that he didn’t want.”

Ye Liangcheng immediately retorted, “Those aren’t called spoils of battle. That’s charity. Since when did the divine families start accepting other people’s charity? You’ve lost the face of the divine families.”

Shen Chengfeng and the others were enraged. He truly wanted to curse back that if Ye Liangchen had the ability, he could go find Long Chen to complain. Why did he have to take out his anger on them? However, Shen Chengfeng endured it in the end. After all, he belonged to the divine families.

“Those words are lacking. The divine families are currently on the same side as Long Chen. Since we’re working together, we share danger and profit. Brother Liangchen, your words go too far. Commander Shen, since there’s nothing left for you to do here, bring your people away. It must have been hard on you as this sudden assault occurred out of nowhere. I will arrange for replacements for the ones that you lost,” said Long Aotian. The eighth legion belonged to the Long family, so he naturally needed to speak up.

Shen Chengfeng hastily bowed to Long Aotian and then left with the eighth legion. Feng Fei, Long Aotian, Ye Liangchen, and Jiang Wuchen also left.

…

Long Chen did not make any stop after returning to the divine families. He directly returned to the Martial Heaven Continent. At this moment, the air was clearly darker than before. The auras of the other worlds were growing stronger and stronger.

Long Chen first went to the Wine God Palace. After explaining what they had negotiated, the High Priest only smiled and nodded.

“Did you not mention the matter of the original devil race?”

“Uh…” Long Chen was struck speechless, staring in shock at the High Priest.
