Chapter 2610 Demon King

The Heavenly Dragon Legion’s warriors were clumped up, surrounded by endless demonic beasts.

Having lost their defensive structures against this torrent of demonic beasts, they were like a drop of water in the ocean.

Although Shen Chengfeng had immediately noticed that something was wrong and sent someone to request reinforcements, none of them had expected the demonic beasts to suddenly unleash such an assault.

They had never seen such a thing in all their lives. Their defensive structures were blasted apart like rotting wood, and in just a few breaths’ time, ten thousand experts died.

Based on that rate, they wouldn’t be able to last an incense stick’s worth of time before they were all wiped out. Even if their reinforcements came, they would be too late.

“Everyone, activate your defenses!”

Just as they felt despair, a familiar voice rang out in their minds.

“It’s Long Chen!”

That voice instantly reinvigorated the Heavenly Dragon Legion’s warriors. Without hesitation, they entered their strongest defensive state.

“Raging Flames Devour the Heavens!”

A voice rang out like a volcano was erupting, and flames devoured the battlefield, making the demonic beasts scream.

They crazily struggled, but they were unable to extinguish those flames. Those were the karmic hell flames, so there was no way these demonic beasts could extinguish them.

After that, Evilmoon swept through the air, cutting off a dozen heads in one slash. These thirteenth rank demonic beasts were unable to block Evilmoon when they were covered by karmic hell flames.

With the thirteenth rank demonic beasts killed, the other demonic beasts fell into chaos. They rolled on the ground, crashing into each other, all vain efforts to extinguish the flames.

In the chaos, they no longer cared about the eighth Heavenly Dragon Legion. They began to run around, resulting in them igniting other demonic beasts that hadn’t been touched by the flames yet.

“Long Chen, you came! I thought that we would never meet again.” Shen Chengfeng came over, looking at Long Chen gratefully.

Last time, in the Star Field Divine World, Feng Fei and Zhao Ritian had become enemies with Long Chen. Although Shen Chengfeng had refused to participate in the battle, as a member of the divine families, he knew that after that, the two of them might end up in two different worlds.

That was because Shen Chengfeng had directly defied Zhao Ritian’s orders back then. To do so was a betrayal of the divine families, and that was not permitted.

Long Chen had then killed Zhao Ritian in front of everyone from the Martial Heaven Continent. That was a public declaration of war against the divine families.

Because of it, the eighth Heavenly Dragon Legion had been immediately summoned upon returning to the divine families and questioned. This betrayal was worthy of the death penalty.

However, the Long family had come out to protect them. As a result, they hadn’t received any punishment, but they were rejected from the forces belonging to the Jiang, Ye, and Zhao families.

On the battlefield, those three families’ would often scheme against them. As for the Long family, they were busy with their own work and were unable to protect the eighth Heavenly Dragon Legion.

Even if the Long family wanted to protect them, the three other families could prevent that. If they wanted the eighth Heavenly Dragon Legion to die on the battlefield, it would be as easy as crushing a fly.

Shen Chengfeng even suspected that this current assault was the result of the other three families targeting them, and that was why they hadn’t sent any reinforcements. Hence, he had decided to immediately send someone to the Long family for reinforcements.

Unexpectedly, the reinforcements turned out to be Long Chen. Upon seeing him, the Heavenly Dragon warriors that had fought alongside him before were so moved that their eyes reddened.

“No matter what happens between me and the divine families, we will always be brothers.” Long Chen patted Shen Chengfeng’s shoulder.

Shen Chengfeng and the rest of the eighth Heavenly Dragon Legion were all men worthy of respect. Despite knowing the consequences of defying Zhao Ritian back then, they had still done so.

They would rather suffer themselves, take on the title of traitors, and face death than do something that they would regret for the rest of their lives. How could Long Chen not respect such people?

Long Chen also suspected that this was another ploy of the divine families, because when the vice commander had appeared at the transportation formation, Elder Long had had another expression other than shock. It was as if he had wanted to say something but hadn’t said it in the end.

With the Nine Star Hegemon Body Art’s intuition, he didn’t sense any hostility from Elder Long. However, the interior of the divine families was extremely complicated. He would have to slowly resolve things bit by bit.

“Long Chen, how did you end up coming here?” asked Shen Chengfeng.

“For now, the divine families and I have returned to working together. I heard that you were in trouble, so I rushed over. Fortunately, I came in time,” said Long Chen.

“Really?”

Shen Chengfeng and the others were delighted. This meant that they were no longer enemies and could fight alongside each other again.

At this moment, roars rang out in the distance. Long Chen’s flames had killed quite a few of the demonic beasts, but due to how wide an area he had spread them, some of the stronger ones still managed to survive with only their fur incinerated. They once more began to attack.

“This defensive line has already lost its meaning. We should retreat,” said Shen Chengfeng. He was technically commander, but now that Long Chen was here, he couldn’t help turning toward Long Chen.

“Over ten thousand of our brothers have died. Just leaving like this isn’t our style. Follow me,” said Long Chen.

“Yes!”

The eighth legion’s warriors shouted in unison. At this moment, their fear vanished in an instant. It was as if with Long Chen here, these demonic beasts were nothing. Long Chen gave them a feeling of blind trust and safety.

“Huo Linger, come out.”

A flame-robed Huo Linger appeared in the sky. She was wrapped in flame runes and seemed like a beautiful sprite. After that, she waved a sword in her hand, filling the sky with divine light.

Dragon roars then rang out of that divine light, and one dragon after another came charging out at the demonic beasts.

Right now, hundreds of giant flame dragons covered the sky, lighting the world on fire. From this, people could see that Huo Linger wasn’t just powerful in single combat but also in group combat. In single combat, she was able to tie down the Sovereign sprout Ye Liangchen. In a group fight, she was worth an army of ten thousand.

Under Huo Linger’s command, the giant dragons charged through the demonic beasts, devouring them.

After that, Huo Linger herself also entered the battlefield. Even the powerful thirteenth rank demonic beasts were unable to block her sword. With every swing, another powerful demonic beast died. They were hacked apart like melons.

Looking at this scene, Shen Chengfeng and the others were dumbfounded. Although they had seen her fight before, a few coincidences had lined up to allow her to trap Ye Liangchen. However, now she was annihilating this army of demonic beasts all on her own, and it was difficult to believe.

“Brothers, cover the rear and cut down any beasts that slip through the gaps. Gather their corpses; we’ll use the same old rules. The Neidans and what not are yours. I just want their dead bodies.” Long Chen charged on, fighting alongside Huo Linger.

Only then did Shen Chengfeng and the others recover from their shock enough to join in as well. After that, they killed any half-dead fish that slipped through the net.

As they progressed further and further, the ground became covered in cooked corpses. The smell of cooked meat made their expressions grow odd. It actually made them a bit hungry.

“Big brother Long Chen, this is easy!” Huo Linger chopped apart a thirteenth rank demonic beast with another swing of her sword. This flame sword of hers was incomparably sharp.

This sword was condensed from her core flame, which contained all the powers of the flames he had absorbed. It possessed sharpness, explosiveness, the ability to devour, the ability to incinerate souls, and all kinds of other powers. She could use them all.

Huo Linger’s face was flushed with excitement. As a flame spirit, she grew excited at devouring and destroying. This was her nature.

Right now, the army of demonic beasts was unable to stop her army of flame dragons, so in just a few breaths’ time, Huo Linger managed to push the demonic beasts back to the eighth legion’s original camp.

This defensive stronghold was completely wrecked. Adding on the destruction brought by the flame dragons, all that was left was some broken walls.

However, there were some weapons that they managed to pick up in time. There were still some giant crossbows and long-distance divine items that they could use.

In a bit, arrows began to fly through the battlefield, annihilating the demonic beasts that had been badly burned.

As they progressed, Shen Chengfeng saw other defensive strongholds that had also been abandoned. The warriors there had fled. As expected, they were not the only ones attacked.

Suddenly, the sky dimmed and a giant bird appeared in the sky, attacking Long Chen with a claw.

It was a golden Peng, but it was different from the Xuan Beast race of the Martial Heaven Continent. Its wings were golden, but its back was black, its tail was blue, and its claws were a bewitching violet.

This giant Peng actually had four different colors in its body. Such a bird had never appeared on the Martial Heaven Continent. When it showed up, a sinister aura covered the battlefield.

“Long Chen, careful! That’s a demon king!” shouted Shen Chengfeng.

Long Chen slashed his saber at the giant claw. As a result, it was like he had attacked a divine item. A burst of power caused the ground beneath his feet to shatter.

“Inferior human race, face your death!”

Following the claw attack, the Peng’s wings folded, smashing toward Long Chen like two giant blades. Even the void was compressed by these wings.FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m
