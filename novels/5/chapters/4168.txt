Chapter 4157 No Rest Until Death

Guo Ran and the others were stunned. They had been curiously watching the elder and hadn’t expected him to suddenly want to drag them down with him. It was just a curse, wasn’t it? There was no need to go that far.

“You can go by yourself. We won’t accompany you.” Long Chen stepped forward and flicked a single finger at the elder, shooting a bolt of lightning out of his fingertip.

The lightning then pierced through the elder’s head, instantly killing him. However, the fact that Long Chen killed him in one move didn’t shock most people.

After all, that elder was cursed, and his power was suppressed to the limit. Even an ordinary Immortal King would have the power to kill him.

To their surprise though, even after killing him, Long Chen and the others were not cursed. Perhaps the elder had planned on passing the curse of misfortune to them by having them kill him. If that had happened, he really would have brought them down with him.

After the elder was slain, his body grew and transformed into a giant bird. It was an immemorial pelican.

Unable to retain human form after being slain, his true body was unleashed. However, it vanished just as it appeared.

His corpse was thrown into the primal chaos space, and it was instantly devoured the moment it touched the black soil.

Even the black qi on it was devoured by the black soil. Clearly, the curse of the Heavenly Daos was unable to continue within the primal chaos space.

Long Chen was disappointed by the amount of life energy though. That was an innate Heaven Venerate’s corpse, but it didn’t unleash much energy.

“His energy was already taken away by the Heavenly Daos, so this corpse is only an empty shell. I got excited for nothing.” Long Chen sighed to himself. He had thought that he would profit immensely this time, but it turned out that he only pulled in some trash.

“You…!”

Seeing Long Chen was safe and sound and had even taken their patriarch’s corpse, the Pelican race’s experts were shocked and enraged.

“Hand over the patriarch’s corpse, or the Pelican race will have no rest until death against you!” shouted one of the elders of the Pelican race.

The corpse of their patriarch was related to the dignity of their Pelican race. If they allowed his corpse to fall into other people’s hands, it would be an absolute disgrace.

“No rest until death? Alright. As long as you dare to attack, then if a single member of your Pelican race lives past today, I’ll write my name backward,” said Long Chen indifferently.

“Big words! I want to see just how many waves some little humans like you can cause! This place is the domain of the demonic beast race! Do you think that we can be treated like empty air? If you can leave here alive, it would be the greatest insult to the demonic beast race!” shouted the elder of the Pelican race.

The expressions of the experts in the distance twitched. The shameless elder was trying to drag them into this as well.

Long Chen simply smiled and raised his hand. When the flames condensed into the shape of a lotus on his hand, his voice resounded through this world.

“I have a friend who once said something that I really appreciate. He said that reading books is to talk reason with others, but cultivation is to force others to talk reason with you. Your Pelican race refuses to talk reason, so I have no reason to do that. Let us just directly talk with power!”

The flames in Long Chen’s hand rapidly grew. After that, the snow-white lotus covered the sky, and snow began to float through the air.

When the snow landed on the ground, the earth was burned black in an instant. Despite clearly giving an icy feeling, the snow burned through the ground.T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

“It’s the Ice Soul! This is the rank eight Heavenly Flame, the Ice Soul Divine Flame!”

A startled cry rang out in the distance as someone recognized this flame.

It truly was the Ice Soul Divine Flame. However, today, the flame looked different from before.

The original Ice Soul had split her source seed, giving half of it to Huo Linger. Now, Huo Linger finally managed to gain control over the Ice Soul’s source.

The Ice Soul proved to be too powerful, far exceeding Huo Linger’s cultivation base back then. As she didn’t have the power to nourish the Ice Soul Divine Flame, it was in a dormant state all this time.

It was easy for her to control a trace of the Ice Soul’s power, but unleashing its full power was a different story. After all, the Ice Soul had its own characteristics. If she were to unleash its full power recklessly, she would be harmed instead. In fact, she might even be destroyed.

Thus, Huo Linger had only ever used a trace of the Ice Soul’s power before. Anyway, the Ice Soul was also in a state of self-preservation and wouldn’t allow Huo Linger to mess around with it.

However, Huo Linger had spent days and nights absorbing the Moon Flames and Sun Flames, constantly growing. After absorbing the power of the Moon Flames and Sun Flames and turning them into her own power, she started to nourish the Ice Soul’s source.

Fortunately, the Great Desolate Winged Devil’s corpse came on time, transforming into an enormous amount of life energy that made the Moon Tree and Fusang Trees grow rapidly. As a result, an unending supply of energy was transferred to the Ice Soul, causing it to awaken.

The awakened Ice Soul was now unleashing its power. The snowflakes that appeared when Long Chen used its power was the specific mark of the Ice Soul.

“AH!”

Although the disciples of the Pelican race were constantly dodging, the snowflakes were all around the place. The instant any of them touched the snowflakes, their defenses were burned through and their bodies were set aflame. In just a moment, miserable shrieks rang out.

The Pelican race’s experts were finally terrified, feeling like the whole Pelican race had met a calamity today. It seemed that the misfortune of the Pelican race didn’t stop with the patriarch’s death.

“Activate the bloodline barrier! Summon the ancestral spirit!”

With the patriarch dead, the Pelican race still had over ten Heaven Venerates. They directed the disciples into an organized defense, and hundreds of thousands of their experts linked their bloodlines, summoning an enormous barrier. At the same time, an enormous illusory figure slowly condensed behind them.

That was an enormous pelican with an ancient aura. When it appeared, the bloodline and souls of these hundreds of thousands of experts seemed to instantly merge into one.

The barrier sent ripples through the void, an overwhelming force that left even innate Heaven Venerates feeling powerless in its presence.

“Go ahead and attack! If you attack, it’s a provocation to the entire demonic beast race! When the time comes, the demonic beast race will surround you, and all of you will die miserable deaths!” shouted the Pelican race’s elder crazily. Even now, he was still trying to incite others to join their side.

“Is that so? Then I really want to see that! World Extermination Flame Lotus!”

Long Chen unleashed an enormous white lotus. With a sacred divine radiance, it had a long tail trailing it as it smashed into the Pelican race’s barrier. The moment it landed, the entire world seemed to freeze.
