Chapter 4672 Celestial Golden Lines

“Your boss is definitely dead! Our young master has activated the Celestial Golden Lines, and he is now unrivaled! Hehe, wait to see your boss in pieces soon!”

The Celestial race’s experts could no longer hide from the fight thanks to everyone’s pressure and had joined the assault on the Dragonblood Legion.

Thus, when they saw those lines in Luo Changsheng’s eyes, their fighting spirit soared, and they unleashed powerful roars.

“Dragonblood perverts, just you wait, once your boss dies, it’ll be your tur—!”

Just as one of them was shouting within the crowd, a golden sword shot out of the ground, stabbing through his head.

“You damn Celestial race, I’m going to slaughter you all!”

Bai Shishi’s hands were still in a seal, but her face contorted in fury. She was the one who had just killed that fellow just now.

According to Guo Ran’s strategy, the core experts like Yu Qingxuan, Bai Shishi, Bai Xiaole, Yue Zifeng, Xia Chen, Gu Yang, Li Qi, Song Mingyuan, and the others were to stick to the rear. Even if they engaged in combat, they were to maintain restraint, merely controlling the pace of the battle. This fight was left to the Dragonblood warriors so that the Guo Ran and the others could conserve their energy for anything unexpected.

However, Bai Shishi’s temper had always been fiery. Seeing Long Chen undergoing such a dangerous tribulation made her extremely anxious. Combined with constant provocations from the Celestial race, she could no longer contain her rage. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

“Sharp metal energy, golden lotus of the earth!”

Bai Shishi's hand seals shifted swiftly, her fingers resembling blooming lotus petals as golden divine light enveloped her. Beneath her, the ground ignited with golden spots as countless golden swords shot out, piercing through her enemies. This attack spanned the entire battlefield, but its main target was, of course, the hateful Celestial race.

This sudden attack caught those experts off guard. After she had advanced to the Divine Venerate realm, her mastery over her metal energy had reached a pinnacle where a mere thought could unleash such a devastating assault in an instant. The golden swords rained down upon the battlefield, painting it crimson with the blood of the enemies.

Bai Shishi’s heart hurt for Long Chen, and she hated the Celestial race for their duplicity. As a result, she showed no mercy. Golden swords continued to fly out of the ground, forcing her enemies to flee in disarray.

“Shishi, don’t get angry. You have to remember our goal,” warned Yu Qingxuan hastily. The Dragonblood Legion was here to protect Long Chen and be prepared for anything unexpected. Ensuring Long Chen’s safety was more important than anything else.

“Big Sister, don’t worry, I understand. However, I’m going to die of rage if I don’t kill a few of these idiots. That’ll affect the battle later on,” replied Bai Shishi through her clenched teeth. Her meaning was clear: she knew what was important and what was not, so she wouldn’t use any of her core energy. However, she’d go crazy if she didn’t kill a few people now.

Hearing her reasons, Yu Qingxuan helplessly sighed, and Bai Xiaole shrugged. He also had no way to control his big sister. It was a good thing Yu Qingxuan had given her this warning. If it had been him instead, he would have gotten a beating.

However, as long as Bai Shishi knew her priority, everyone let her do as she wished. Her involvement in the battle alleviated the pressure on the Dragonblood Legion, enabling them to rediscover their former level of cooperation during the battle. They wanted to rekindle the old feeling where they could communicate without the need for words.

Just then, an explosive sound came from the sky. Looking up, the onlookers saw a saber slashed through the heavens before smashing into a fist covered in blood-colored scales.

The impact blew the two figures back. The scales on Long Chen’s fist blew apart, to the point that the onlookers could see his bones, but Long Chen had managed to block this attack.

Just then, the lightning dragons reached Long Chen and Luo Changsheng, while the other experts within the tribulation also started to fight those dragons.

The dragons’ claws and tails unleashed devastating blows, carrying with them an immense destructive force that seemed capable of obliterating the entire world.

“Scram!” Luo Changsheng roared. As he swung his saber, those giant lightning dragons were directly cut apart, transforming into lightning runes.

“What?!” Gu Yang and the others jumped in shock. Previously, a single lightning dragon had been enough to injure Luo Changsheng, but now, he was able to cut through several of them at once.

“What’s going on!? His aura hasn’t changed that much!” asked Li Qi.

“It is due to him activating his bloodline ability and the hidden power of his saber. That saber is not ordinary,” replied Yue Zifeng. Having fought with Luo Changsheng before, Yue Zifeng was very familiar with his power.

Hearing that, everyone couldn’t help being shocked inside, and the other experts felt even more admiration for Yue Zifeng. Fortunately, they also had a monster of his caliber with them. Otherwise, Yue Zifeng would have wiped them out back then.

“Die!”

Luo Changsheng held his saber with both hands and then attacked Long Chen, who was entangled with several lightning dragons. Seeing Luo Changsheng charging over, Long Chen forced away those lightning dragons and unleashed a punch.

BOOM!

Long Chen and Luo Changsheng blew each other backward again, but Long Chen happened to crash into a lightning dragon, blasting it apart.

“What is boss doing? If he’s capable of blasting apart these lightning dragons, why isn’t he?” asked one of the Dragonblood warriors. They couldn’t comprehend this.

Unbeknownst to them, Long Chen was stealthily sending drops of his own essence blood into these lightning dragons when he was fighting them. Lei Linger’s will then entered them through his blood.

Long Chen wasn’t planning on controlling these lightning dragons to fight for him; rather, he wanted Lei Linger to merge with their core runes. He had noticed that these lightning dragons could use the dragon race’s divine abilities. Hence, as long as Lei Linger merged with those core runes, she would also have a chance to control those divine abilities.

Since that was the case, Long Chen was in no rush to kill the lightning dragons. He wanted to get as much as he could out of them because he knew that this was only the start. He had to accumulate more trump cards.

Just as Long Chen and Luo Changsheng fought, the other experts finally revealed their terrifying power, destroying one lightning dragon after another. However, to their surprise, they found that the number of dragons was not decreasing at all.

Seeing that they were in a stalemate, one of those monstrous experts snuck his way over to the Sovereign clan expert. He had just gotten close when the Sovereign clan expert’s spear quivered and pierced him through instantly.
