Chapter 4247 Receiving an Eternal Divine Weapon Barehanded

As the assault on the Dragonblood Legion unfolded, Long Chen’s fight also started. However, amidst the chaos, most people couldn’t have a clear view of the battles.

In the end, an explosive sound drew everyone’s attention back to him. They then saw Xu Yifeng smack into the barrier and cough up blood.

The one to send him flying was Long Chen. However, just as Long Chen sent Xu Yifeng flying, countless lily leaves wrapped around him.

Before this, when Long Chen had faced off against Lian Wuying, Xu Yifeng had taken that chance to launch a sneak attack, resulting in him suffering a severe injury at Long Chen's hands. Meanwhile, Lian Wuying had also exploited the situation to unleash one of her formidable trump cards against Long Chen.

Although the observers didn’t see the full thing, they could guess. Xu Yifeng was extremely sinister. He had gambled about whether or not Long Chen would dare to focus on him.

Xu Yifeng’s main goal when launching the sneak attack was just to distract Long Chen. If Long Chen chose to dodge, he would use a follow-up move that would push Long Chen into a passive state. And if Long Chen didn’t dodge, he predicted that Long Chen wouldn’t dare to use his full power against him, or Long Chen would expose an opening to Lian Wuying. Hence, he believed that this sneak attack was foolproof.

However, he hadn’t expected Long Chen to directly kick him as soon as he got close. This outcome deviated entirely from his predictions. He was perplexed as to how Long Chen had detected him so quickly, particularly when Long Chen should have been preoccupied with Lian Wuying.

Furthermore, even if Long Chen had sensed him, Xu Yifeng couldn't comprehend how Long Chen had managed to strike him before his own attack had a chance to connect. Baffled by these circumstances, Xu Yifeng found himself grievously injured, his bones shattered and blood gushing from his mouth, all without a clear understanding of what had just occurred.

However, one thing that Xu Yifeng had predicted came true: his actions had indeed created an opening for Lian Wuying, and she directly unleashed her terrifying trump card.

The lily leaves wrapped around Long Chen. This was the very technique that had turned the dark domain lords into white bones.

Those who cared about Long Chen felt their hearts skip a beat when they saw Long Chen being enveloped by the lily leaves.

To their astonishment, the emerald leaves suddenly became encased in frost before bursting into flames. These leaves then shattered and cascaded through the sky like shards of ice, each fragment bearing white flames burning on it.

“The rank eight Heavenly Flame, the Ice Soul Divine Flame!” A startled cry rang out from someone who recognized this terrifying flame.

“This technique is useless against me.”

Long Chen instantly freed himself from the bindings of the lily leaves, not giving Lian Wuying a chance to complete her technique.

“However, before dealing with you, there’s something more important that I have to do.”

Long Chen’s Kunpeng wings quivered, and he shot toward the injured Xu Yifeng.

Upon seeing this, Xu Yifeng’s expression completely changed. He was still injured, and his Blood Qi was in disarray. To sum it up, he was not in a battle-ready state.

However, without hesitation, he slashed his sword at Long Chen and rapidly fell back.

In response, Long Chen twisted his body, skillfully dodging the Sword Qi without slowing down. Xu Yifeng was shocked; he hadn't intended to harm Long Chen with that attack but rather to buy himself some time.

In his current condition, he simply couldn’t fight. He had to wait until his Blood Qi settled. Seeing that his attack had no effect at all, his heart sank even further. To make matters worse, despite the presence of numerous experts in the vicinity, many of whom were focused on Long Chen, not a single person helped him.

Long Chen’s claw then slammed toward Xu Yifeng.

Buzz.

A violet-gold bell appeared, whistling toward Long Chen.

“Hmph,” Long Chen snorted. This bell might be an Eternal divine weapon, but it was not an offensive one.

Effortlessly, Long Chen’s left hand clawed down on Xu Yifeng, while his right hand punched the bell. A deafening resonance then echoed, shaking people’s ears. Long Chen’s punch sent the violet-gold bell flying.

“What?! Did he just receive the attack of an Eternal divine weapon barehanded?!”

Startled cries rang out once again. Long Chen had managed to send the bell flying with a punch.

However, Long Chen was also sent flying by an immense force. But just before that, his dragon claw had already grabbed Xu Yifeng’s sword.

Just as Long Chen was sent flying, his right hand trembled, and the immense power of the violet-gold bell surged through his arms, channeling into his left hand before releasing through the sword.

As though struck by a bolt of lightning, Xu Yifeng spewed blood from his mouth. His previous wounds had yet to heal, and this injury added to his misery. He could no longer keep a hold of his sword and was sent flying along with Long Chen.

Long Chen’s dragon claw then switched from his sword to his neck, freezing Xu Yifeng. Just like that, he fell into Long Chen’s grasp.

“Long Chen, if you dare to harm Yifeng, I will slaughter everyone in the High Firmament Academy!”

Outside the martial stage, the Xu family head instantly shot up. Veins throbbed on his forehead, and he appeared as if he had gone insane.

All the Xu family’s experts surged to their feet, feeling tense. After all, Xu Yifeng was extremely important to the Xu family, being their hope of rising in the future.

“This fellow from your family is definitely dead. However, slaughtering us is a dream that you can never achieve,” sneered Bai Zhantang. He understood Long Chen far too well. First, the martial stage was blocked off, so the ones inside couldn’t see or hear what was happening outside. But even if Long Chen did hear, he wouldn’t care about this threat.

Furthermore, this Xu family head had the audacity to declare that he would annihilate the High Firmament Academy, an act that had thoroughly incensed Bai Zhantang. Just who did he think he was threatening?Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“High Firmament Academy, do you realize how few of you will survive if you provoke us?!” asked that powerful man who had previously stood beside the Xu family head.

“Is that so? Then let’s try it!” Bai Zhantang sneered at him. The Xu family’s arrogance had long since irritated him.

The palace master was still silent. However, his mouth slowly curled into a dangerous-looking smile.

Outside the martial stage, the Xu family’s experts almost couldn’t breathe. However, inside the martial stage, Ye Wuchen, the Ghost Dao lifeform, Lian Wuying, and the other experts seemed to have no intention of saving Xu Yifeng. They merely observed the unfolding events.

Only Xu Xin-er was shocked and enraged. Xu Yifeng’s power was far greater than this, but he had miscalculated. After being so badly injured, he had no chance to unleash his power. Now, his life was hanging by a thread, and there was nothing she could do.

All she could do was shout, but she had no idea what to threaten Long Chen with. “Long Chen, release him, otherwise-!”

“Meng Qi!”

Long Chen suddenly turned to Meng Qi, who immediately understood. She then closed her eyes and formed hand seals.

Buzz.

A beautiful figure appeared behind Long Chen; it was an illusory Meng Qi. Long Chen then extended a finger.

That finger pierced Xu Yifeng’s forehead in front of countless shocked gazes.
