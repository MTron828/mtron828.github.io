Chapter 4646 Black Saber

All of a sudden, the Ten Thousand Dragon Nest stopped shaking violently, and the temperature dropped drastically, sending a chill down the spines of the Dragonblood warriors.

Yue Zifeng’s eyes snapped open, a glint of determination shining within them. His long hair then billowed as if caught in an unseen breeze, and the image of a white dragon materialized around him, seemingly blessing him with its power.

“I walked through mountains of corpses and seas of blood, transcending the shackles of heaven and earth.

“From the mortal to the immortal, no one could halt my advance.

“From weak to strong, no obstacles could bar my path.

“In the realm of dust and ashes, across the sea of sorrow, through the nine heavens and ten lands, there is nothing I cannot cut. Say my name loud and clear.”

Yue Zifeng murmured quietly, his voice resounding throughout heaven and earth like the decree of a god or the whisper of a devil. The sword in his hand then quivered, imbued with a sharp will. Gradually, the entire Ten Thousand Dragon Nest shuddered in response to his power.

“Wavecutter!”

Yue Zifeng’s voice suddenly transformed from a murmur to a resounding shout, accompanied by a powerful dragon cry. At the same time, his sword flew out of his sheath, unleashing Sword Qi that slashed down on the Sovereign clan expert.

Reacting swiftly, the Dragonblood warriors retreated as the Sword Qi struck the expert directly. The Sovereign clan expert didn’t dodge. Instead, he unleashed a punch, resulting in an explosive clash that shattered the Sword Qi. Yue Zifeng spat out a mouthful of blood at that moment and passed out.

Following that, the Dragonblood warriors saw a stunning scene—the arm of the Sovereign clan expert cracked and shattered.

Suddenly, the Sovereign clan expert raised his head and unleashed a deafening dragon roar that reverberated throughout the Ten Thousand Dragon Nest, causing the Dragonblood warriors to stiffen before losing consciousness and tumbling into the magma below.

The dragon souls, which had been roaring with them, fell silent. Other than Long Chen and the Sovereign clan expert, everyone was unconscious.

Long Chen locked eyes with the Sovereign clan expert, and for a moment, an unspoken understanding passed between them.

“Many thanks, senior.”

Eventually, it was Long Chen who broke the silence.

“No need to thank me. You earned everything on your own. I only followed the rules,” the Sovereign clan expert remarked, shaking his head. “I’m very curious, when I used power beyond the World King realm, why didn’t you get angry? Why didn’t you give up? Did you not feel like it was very unfair?”

“Unfair? This world has never been fair. Ever since I set foot on the path of cultivation, I have always been fighting or on the way to my next fight. My enemies have never been fair to me, and I never complained about this. Other than that, even though you used stronger power, I believe that with your pride, that level of power is still weaker than your power when you were in the World King realm,” answered Long Chen.

“How can you be so sure?” The Sovereign clan expert was a bit taken aback.

“Of course. I trust my vision and intuition,” replied Long Chen as he nodded.

The Sovereign clan expert fell into silence for a moment and suddenly smiled self-mockingly. “Are you intentionally slapping me in the face? You are basically saying that your vision far surpasses mine! Although I did use a stronger power, just as you said, it was not beyond the power I had when I was in the World King realm. I don’t have a physical body in this state, nor is my dragon soul complete. Hence, I had no choice but to use more dragon blood power to make up for this deficiency.”

Long Chen nodded and sighed, “Senior, from you, I have seen the glory of the peak heavenly geniuses of ancient times.”

Long Chen could also be called a peak heavenly genius, so he didn’t admire that many people in this world. However, this senior was one of them.

Unfortunately, just as he said, he didn’t have a physical body, and his dragon soul was incomplete. As a result, he couldn’t unleash his greatest divine abilities and could only replicate them. Of course, the replicas were far weaker than the real thing.

When suppressing his power to the same realm, he was unable to beat Long Chen, so he increased the power of his Blood Qi to make up for his lacking physical body and dragon soul. However, this adjustment led to an imbalanced and ultimately unsatisfying battle for both Long Chen and the Sovereign clan expert.

Currently, everyone from the Dragonblood Legion was lying in the magma, enveloped by divine light. Long Chen observed with fascination as a single drop of blood concentrated on the forehead of each warrior.

This was the reward that the Dragonblood warriors had obtained—the Sovereign scale’s blood. They had obtained the approval of this expert, so Long Chen was extremely grateful to him.

Despite the initial dislike the Sovereign clan expert harbored toward Long Chen, he ultimately bestowed his most precious essence blood upon Long Chen’s comrades.

“I’m ashamed. I misjudged you at first. You and your companions have shown me a different side of the human race. It’s a shame that I cannot have a real fight with you in the same realm, and I’ll never be able to make up for that regret.”

He sighed, gazing at Long Chen with a hint of admiration. “To be honest, I was jealous of you at first. I couldn't fathom how a human could be deemed worthy of the Dragon Sovereign’s favor. Now, I see that my jealousy clouded my judgment.” DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

Long Chen remained silent as he had no idea what to say. This expert was unimaginably powerful, but he actually admitted that he was jealous of Long Chen? This point alone was enough to show that he was not a narrow-hearted person.

“I want to ask you a question,” said the Sovereign clan expert.

“Senior, please go ahead.”

“You were clearly already pressed to the limit by me. Why did you not use your full power? Where is your weapon? It's evident that you can channel your abilities more effectively with a weapon,” asked the Sovereign clan expert.

Long Chen smiled bitterly and replied, “I haven’t had a suitable weapon all this time.”

In truth, Long Chen was bitterly grumbling about this. As he wasn’t a dragon, he lacked the natural weaponry of a dragon, such as claws, a tail, or a dragon horn. He was naturally at a disadvantage to fight barehanded against a dragon expert.

The Sovereign clan expert was momentarily baffled, then suddenly raised his head and burst into laughter. “Ah, I see now! What a pity!”

“Senior, what is it?” asked Long Chen.

“Everything really was fated. If I didn’t intentionally block you, perhaps we would have had a chance to fight. Now, I’ve already scattered my dragon blood power, and my dragon soul is on the verge of collapse. I no longer have the power for another round. Is this the Dragon Sovereign’s punishment for me?”

“Senior...” Long Chen did not understand what he was saying at all.

Just as Long Chen was trying to make sense of the situation, the Sovereign clan expert suddenly disappeared into thin air. In his place, a door materialized atop the ancestral scale that hovered in the sky.

Baffled by this turn of events, Long Chen hesitated momentarily before summoning the courage to push open the door. As the door swung open, an enormous black blade materialized before him.

When Long Chen laid eyes on that black blade, his head buzzed. He stood frozen in place, staring blankly at the weapon before him.
