Chapter 4406 Wanting to Kill a Saint?

“Please rise. I have a deep relationship with the Spirit race, so helping you is part of my duty.” Long Chen held the elder, not allowing him to kneel.

“Race leader Hao Feng, what is the situation? Is our situation good or bad?” asked Bally.

“Sigh, we were assaulted several times. When we parted ways with the Saint, we had over forty thousand people. But now…” Hao Feng shook his head mournfully, indicating the stark reality of their situation as their numbers had dwindled from forty thousand to just a few hundred.

“Oh, that’s right, how did you encounter this hero?” asked Hao Feng.

Bally instantly felt embarrassed, but it didn’t lie and narrated how it had provoked Long Chen and everything afterward.

Hearing this, Hao Feng was speechless and contemplated the unusual turn of fortune. This was a case of profiting from calamity.

“Race leader Hao Feng, master has agreed to help us. Bring us to the Saint!” urged Bally.

“Ah, that…” Hao Feng was hesitant. Clearly, the location of the Saint was a sensitive topic. If Long Chen had any bad intentions toward their Saint, it would spell trouble.

At this moment, Bally’s spiritual fluctuations intensified as it used a secret method to communicate with its people. Hao Feng’s gaze suddenly shifted to the sleeping Little Crane on Long Chen’s back.

“I’m sorry. I was judging a hero as a petty person.”

Long Chen smiled and didn’t mind this. “It’s alright to exercise caution for something this crucial. It’s completely understandable.”

“Many thanks. I will bring you to see the Saint right now,” said Hao Feng. He was hesitant before, but after Bally told him about Little Crane’s identity, he instantly let down his guard.

“Should we rest here first? We need time to recuperate from the last battle,” remarked an Eternal expert.Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

Having just gone through an immense battle, many of them suffered serious injuries. Even the Eternal experts needed to rest a bit.

“Endure it for now. On the battlefield, an instant is all that is needed for everything to change. No one knows what kind of unexpected thing will happen in the next second. The sooner we see the Saint, the better,” said Long Chen.

Hao Feng nodded. That was also what he was thinking. As a result, the injured people could only endure the pain and run.

Long Chen had Bally distribute some medicinal pills to the injured to recover their energy. After consuming these pills, they were reinvigorated and looked at Long Chen with a new opinion.

“Senior Long Chen, are you actually an alchemy master?” asked Hao Feng as he led the way.

“Senior, you can just call me Long Chen. I wouldn’t dare to call myself a master as I only dabble in it,” said Long Chen. Hao Feng was much older than him, so Long Chen naturally felt unnatural being called senior by him.

What Long Chen didn’t know was that these Earth Spirit experts had just arrived in this world of humans, and so they were unfamiliar with the human race’s way of addressing each other. All they knew was that the people here called the strong seniors.

“Race leader Hao Feng, if everyone can endure it, we should speed up. I have a bad feeling,” said Long Chen.

“Alright.” Hao Feng was also very worried about their Saint. After all, when they parted ways, their side was barely able to draw away a few of their enemies. Having failed in diverting their enemies, he had no idea how their Saint fared right now.

As Hao Feng led the way, he repeatedly paused and took out a drop of blood, using it as a guide.

After stopping five times, he had the essence blood transform into an arrow that solidly pointed in one direction. Furthermore, it started to shake intensely.

“Not good. The Saint is injured! Her life is hanging by a thread!” Hao Feng’s expression changed.

“I’ll go with Bally first.”

Hearing this, Long Chen directly spread his Kunpeng wings, and Bally jumped onto his shoulder. With a rumble, Long Chen instantly vanished.

“Quick! Go straight ahead! Please save our Saint!” shouted Hao Feng. All of them rushed after Long Chen as fast as they could.

Long Chen’s wings tore through the void as he flew like lightning. He had his divine sense spreading as far as it could.

Without Hao Feng leading the way, Long Chen could only go in the general direction. The problem was the Saint was also moving, so Long Chen was afraid that he would slip past her.

Heaven and earth twisted around Long Chen as he shot forward with his maximum speed. Bally was incredibly nervous right now.

“Here!”

Long Chen flew for an incense stick’s worth of time before he sensed some weak fluctuations from a battle. Approaching, he felt the aura of experts and saw a shattered space ahead, with divine light filling the sky.

Tearing through space, he then arrived at a battlefield strewn with countless experts. In this area, the earth was already torn asunder and the void was riddled with holes. There were corpses everywhere.

In the blink of an eye, terrifying astral winds raised a wave of earth, and countless experts were sent flying his way.

“It’s the Saint’s aura! Just up ahead!” shouted Bally.

Long Chen could also sense the aura of a Saint without its reminder. However, it was different from that of the red-haired monster, seemingly suppressed by some power.

BOOM!

At this moment, a streak of rainbow light shot through the air and sent hundreds of Eternal experts flying. Finally, Long Chen saw a woman wielding a multicolored bow, with a violet jewel embedded in her forehead.

She looked to be in her late twenties and wore an emerald green dress. However, her arms were bare, revealing horrifying wounds that stained the top of her dress with blood.

Her bow blazed with a light brighter than the sun as she used an unknown divine ability to send hundreds of Eternal experts flying.

However, after this attack, her face paled instantly. Some kind of power seemed to have invaded her body, causing her to lose her light.

“Great Saint!”

Bally let out a heart-rending cry. This woman was precisely their Earth Spirit race’s protector god.

“What Saint? Today, I, Zhao Qingyu, will slay a Saint.”

Just then, an arrogant voice rang out. No one could see the speaker, but an enormous hand directly reached out toward that woman.

Seeing the overwhelming Blood Qi eruption, Long Chen jumped in shock. He had never seen such a terrifying Blood Qi before. Compared to it, the Eternal Qi of these experts was worthless.

“You want to slay a Saint? Then I’ll drag you with me!”

That woman clenched her teeth. All of a sudden, she reached out and touched the gem on her forehead.

“No!”

Bally let out a startled cry, knowing that if she used that gemstone’s power, she would also die.

“Dying alongside such trash isn’t worth it. Let me deal with him.”

As Long Chen appeared in front of the woman, a hand covered in golden dragon scales met the hand overflowing with terrifying Blood Qi.
