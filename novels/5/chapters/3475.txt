Chapter 3464 Rank One Heavenly Fiend, Nine Underworld Luocha

The attack came silently without any warning at all. It was an attack launched right in the gap of a person’s senses, and it was as quick as lightning.

Long Chen himself was startled. He hadn’t expected that someone would be able to approach him without him even sensing it.

The attack was almost at his neck when it appeared, and it was the fastest attack he had ever seen. It was far too late for him to dodge.

Sparks flew. A saber sheath suddenly appeared behind Long Chen, blocking that dagger right at that moment of life and death. Despite that, an immense force was transmitted through it, sending Long Chen staggering forward.

Long Chen didn’t even wait to stabilize himself. The Minghong Saber already slashed behind him.

Metallic ringing once more rang out. Despite there being nothing there before he swung, his saber perfectly blocked the second attack from that dagger.

The two divine weapons then rumbled as they clashed. As their masters fought, so did the weapons. The void shuddered, and only now did Long Chen see who had attacked him.

It was a slender woman veiled in a woman’s head covering. Her hair was short, and her eyes were narrow and icy. If it weren’t for the way that they were focused, they would seem just like the eyes of a dead person.

Also, her aura was completely concealed. Not a trace of it leaked. All her aura was sealed within her body. Long Chen then narrowed his eyes. He had never seen such a cultivation technique.

It had to be known that most people needed to unleash their aura, or if they used too much power, they would injure themselves. They might even cause their own death that way.

However, this person was strangely talented. All her power was locked inside her body, and yet her attacks were still hard and concentrated. Not a trace of her power was wasted.

“You are the Nine Underworld Luocha?” asked Long Chen.Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

“Remember my name, because the owner of this name will kill you,” said the Nine Underworld Luocha. Her voice was just like her, emotionless and dry like a machine.

Suddenly, she vanished from beneath Long Chen’s saber. She left no sign of where she went or how she moved. Her movement art was completely ephemeral.

Long Chen stabbed his saber forward. As a result, the Nine Underworld Luocha that had just vanished reappeared. She hadn’t run just now but instead taken a step back. Her dagger blocked Long Chen’s saber.

A trace of astonishment appeared in her cold eyes. With her special talent, she was a supreme expert within the Nine Underworld Hall. That was why she was bestowed with the name of the Nine Underworld Luocha.

The Nine Underworld Luocha was the title given to the Nine Underworld Hall’s strongest disciple. Only those who had passed through the cruelest Nine Underworld Trial could obtain that title.

As the only one in the past million years to pass the Nine Underworld Trial, her movement art was obtained from that trial. Also, other than the hall master Liao Bencang, no one in the Nine Underworld Hall could see through her movement art. So, she hadn’t expected Long Chen to be able to see through it.

Normally, when she vanished like that, a person would instinctively spread their senses around. But it was at that moment that she would kill them. She had never failed, except for today.

“I don’t remember the names of those I killed because I’ve killed far too many people. I really can’t remember them all,” said Long Chen coldly. The killing intent in his eyes raged like a tsunami.

She was the Nine Underworld Luocha, and her hands were soaked in the blood of nine star heirs. Long Chen seemed to see the sights of countless nine star heirs roaring as they were unwillingly killed.

Suddenly, countless stars lit up on Long Chen’s saber, and it rumbled, shaking the world. After that, the Nine Underworld Luocha’s pupils shrank. She found that Long Chen had somehow locked onto her with a supreme mental energy.

At the same time, his saber seemed to be bestowed with the power of the stars. It was trying to directly crush her. He was actually competing with her in pure brute strength, a clash that would not stop until one of them was dead.

In this state, she could only fight against him as he wished. The moment she thought of dodging or running away, Long Chen’s power would erupt as her power scattered. She would then be instantly destroyed.

“I have never feared anyone when it comes to power.” The Nine Underworld Luocha snorted. A red rune then lit up on her forehead and spread to cover her entire body.

Following that, a giant figure appeared behind her. When it manifested, a dark ominous aura filled the sky.

That figure was clearly humanoid, but the aura that it unleashed seemed more like that of a devil from the depths of hell. It made people’s souls shake.

“Long Chen, be careful! That is the Nine Underworld Luocha, an infamous devil species from ancient times! It was a species that slaughtered endless lifeforms. On a battlefield like this, she can absorb all the leftover resentment of the slain to give her boundless power!” shouted Bai Shishi’s mother when she saw that figure.

She had originally thought that the title of the Nine Underworld Luocha was merely to intimidate others. She hadn’t expected it to be really related to an ancient devil species.

The Nine Underworld Hall had a trial region that had the Nine Underworld Luocha’s soul consecrated within. Anyone who passed the trial would obtain the Nine Underworld Luocha’s inheritance and their blessing.

The Nine Underworld Luocha slaughtered lifeforms to live and absorbed their resentment to cultivate. And on the battlefield, a huge amount of resentment accumulated from those that were slain.

Hence, the Nine Underworld Luocha’s manifestation gave her endless power. On this battlefield, she was unrivaled.

“So what if you know? I abandoned my true name, walking beneath the heavens with the title of the Luocha. The Nine Underworld Luocha is me. I am the Nine Underworld Luocha. When I descend upon the world, the ten thousand races can only quiver beneath my feet and weep,” said the Nine Underworld Luocha coldly.

Her voice had changed once more, and so had her spiritual fluctuations. An ancient desolate aura now came from her body. It was as if that ancient Nine Underworld Luocha from ancient times had been revived.

Long Chen’s Minghong Saber then rumbled, and his power pressed down on the Nine Underworld Luocha’s dagger. Under that immense power, the void fractured like a mirror, the cracks spreading far and wide.

“Who cares if you’re the Nine Underworld Luocha or the Ten Underworld Luocha? In front of me, you can only kneel!” Long Chen pressed down.

“Ignorant fool! An ant like you will never know just how terrifying the Luocha race is!” The expressionless Nine Underworld Luocha was suddenly enraged. It seemed that Long Chen’s despise of the Luocha race was the greatest insult to her.

“The Luocha race is nothing. Do you think you’re fit to fight my- me, Long Chen?!” Long Chen roared, his eyes scarlet. He had almost shouted ‘my nine star line’.

Long Chen’s Blood Qi raged within him like a surging river. As his Blood Qi surged, his meridians and blood vessels widened, increasing his power to the max.

Thinking of how this woman had slain nine star heirs, how those hot-blooded men filled with great dreams had been killed, Long Chen’s hatred overflowed.

“DIE!”

Suddenly, Long Chen and the Nine Underworld Luocha roared at the same time. Both of their powers erupted. At that moment, the world instantly changed color.
