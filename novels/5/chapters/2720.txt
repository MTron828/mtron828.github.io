Chapter 2709 Not To Be Eaten

“Thirteenth tier medicinal pill, Heaven Merging Pill. I’m saved!”

Long Chen cried out in excitement. The Heaven Merging Pill could help him rapidly increase his realm. If he rose all the way to the twelfth Heavenstage, so what if the Blood Fiend Devil Lord and the others became Sovereigns? Couldn’t he still beat them?

“Wisteria Phoenix Gallbladder Fruit, Earth Bone Dragon Saliva Incense, Crouching Dragon Star Soul Grass, Peak Earth Eight Bitter Root… I have this one, and this one…”

Long Chen checked the pill formula and found that many of the ingredients were only at the twelfth tier. Only a few of them were extremely rare ingredients.

Some of those rare ingredients were things he already had, but he simply hadn’t known what to do with them. The Earth Bone Dragon Saliva Incense was actually a type of vegetation that grew like coral inside the Ten Thousand Dragon Nest, and it had its own spirituality. Long Chen had obtained it in the Star Field Divine World but hadn’t known its use. Only now did he find out that after slicing it open, a liquid like colored glass would flow out. That was the main ingredient for the Heaven Merging Pill. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

“I actually have them all? Can it be that the blessing of the five Sovereigns has caused my luck to take a better turn?” Seeing that he perfectly had all the ingredients, Long Chen was pleasantly surprised.

He didn’t recall such a lucky thing having occurred to him before. Things never went this smoothly, so he felt a bit strange about this.

“Refining pills!”

He took out the Moon and Star Refining Furnace, but then the Demon Moon Furnace also popped out.

“Big brother Long Chen, you’re so biased! Why won’t you use me?!” demanded Ling-er.

“Ling-er, don’t fuss. First, watch what we do. The senior furnace will go first with its greater experience. Learn what you can, and then the two of you can refine together,” said Long Chen.

Ling-er needed to refine pills in order to strengthen herself. Meanwhile, the Moon and Star Refining Furnace had also recovered to around sixty to seventy percent after refining pills all this time. Its capabilities stunned even Long Chen.

The Moon and Star Refining Furnace was excellent for refining pills, and it was already warming up as soon as he mentioned the Heaven Merging Pills. Furthermore, the heat was at the perfect level.

Clearly, the Moon and Star Refining Furnace had ever refined the Heaven Merging Pill. However, since it hadn’t fully recovered, its memories were incomplete, so it was acting instinctively. Despite that, it would allow Long Chen to grasp this pill refinement as quickly as possible.

At this moment, one medicinal ingredient after another was refined into powder inside the pill furnace. All the essence was locked inside the powder, and not a trace of it escaped.

“If the fire requirements are so high right at the start, it will probably be insanely difficult when the pill condenses.” Long Chen was excited but also prepared.

Based on his past experience, when starting off to refine the ingredients, they could usually be purified with around thirty percent of the maximum flame intensity. Fifty percent was for the merging of the refined powders.

However, they were already starting off with seventy percent of the maximum heat capacity. It had to be known that when the pill condensed, the greater the intensity of the heat, the more difficult it would be to control. The slightest carelessness and the pill would be turned to ash.

This was Long Chen’s first time refining such a difficult pill. Fortunately, the Moon and Star Refining Furnace had some experience with it. With its cooperation, they were making astonishing progress.

When all the medicinal ingredients were refined, Long Chen increased the intensity of the flame. Even when he was at eighty percent power, it was not enough. Hence, he slowly increased the fire until it reached ninety percent.

However, the Moon and Star Refining Furnace was still requiring more as the flame was not strong enough. After that, Long Chen took a deep breath and unleashed the maximum flame intensity he could muster. In that instant, he became wreathed in flames.

With his attention concentrated entirely on the furnace, he didn’t notice that the room he was in was starting to melt. Because of it, an alarm started to ring out.

Hearing it, Meng Qi and the others rushed in. Long Chen’s room had melted, and fire-red lava was spreading on the ground.

“Long Chen is refining pills. He’s at a critical juncture, so he can’t be disturbed. Everyone should get back,” said Meng Qi.

They were currently in the cultivation rooms of the Martial Heaven Alliance’s headquarters. There were formations protecting this place.

However, those formations were incinerated like paper in front of Long Chen’s flames. Seeing the commotion spreading, Meng Qi and the others could only alert everyone and have them retreat.

“What is that little fellow doing?” demanded Qu Jianying when she rushed over. She was vexed. Was he planning on burning down their headquarters?

“It’s too bad big sister Zhiqiu isn’t here. She might be able to stop the flames from spreading,” said Tang Wan-er.

BOOM!

Suddenly, an explosion came from Long Chen’s pill furnace, and Heavenly Dao energy flowed over, forming a giant whirlpool around the Moon and Star Refining Furnace.

“The pill condensed?”

The flames suddenly retracted. There was a giant hole in the ground and a burning smell in the air now. Everyone rushed over through the intense heat.

“Boss, what pill did you refine?” asked Guo Ran. With his understanding of Long Chen, he was sure it was something good.

“Heaven Merging Pill,” said Long Chen.

At this moment, startled cries rang out. There was actually a medicinal pill for advancing in the Heaven Merging realm? Was it real?

“Boss, give me one! I’m willing to be test subject number one for everyone!” exclaimed Guo Ran.

After that, the pill furnace’s lid popped open. Inside, there were no medicinal pills and only some ashy dregs.

“That’s…” Guo Ran stared.

“A failure.” Long Chen shrugged helplessly.

“You little brat, you destroyed the entire training room for a failure?” demanded Qu Jianying.

“You shouldn’t blame a child when they fail. Say some encouraging words, alright?” said the old man.

Qu Jianying felt that she had gone a bit overboard, and so for the first time she didn’t retort to the old man.

“Hehe, it actually wasn’t a complete failure. Even these pill dregs are very useful. Furthermore, I’ve found that the Heaven Merging Pill is not to be consumed by ordinary people,” said Long Chen. Although it was a failure, he was excited. The Moon and Star Refining Furnace had told him that the medicinal formula he was using was identical to the one that it remembered, but the method of refining it was different. That was what resulted in the failure. But this failure now told him what he had to do.

“Boss, you wouldn’t be leaving us these dregs to eat, right?” probed Guo Ran.

“This thing can’t be eaten. If you eat it, you’ll very likely die,” said Long Chen.

“What?” Guo Ran jumped, tossing aside the pill dregs in his hand.
