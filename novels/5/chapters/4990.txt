Unbeknownst to Long Chen, as he walked into the Jiuli Tower, the Long clan commenced a large-scale construction project, creating one giant formation after another. Throughout the Heavenly Desolation Domain, over ten thousand large formations were built, all centered around the Long clan’s territory, forming a massive network of interconnected formations.

In a secret hall, the three Heavenly Saints and the clan leader had a hand pressed on the Earth Cauldron. Two heaven veins swirled around them, channeling their energy into the Earth Cauldron.

At the same time, a giant whirlpool formed on the roof, through which milky white energy slowly poured into the Earth Cauldron. This energy was the extracted and condensed essence of the entire Heavenly Desolation Domain.

“That idiot Long Zaiye. He also had a complete heaven vein. Even if his arm was cut off and his heaven vein’s energy was broken, if he hadn’t been so rash as to forcibly increase Long Qingyun’s realm, he would have at least been able to help a bit now,” complained Long Yaoting.

“That’s enough. He’s already half-crippled, and his mental state is in ruins. We cannot count on him. We can only grit our teeth and keep going. Let’s combine our energy with the formation to awaken the Earth Cauldron as soon as possible,” said the clan leader.

Complaining now was useless. Other than the patriarch, only the four of them had heaven vein energy. Fortunately, the Heaven Overseer could be trusted to take charge of the Long clan during this time, allowing them to carry out their work in peace. As the four of them continued to focus, streams of energy continuously poured into the Earth Cauldron.

…

When Long Chen walked into the Jiuli Tower, his vision turned dark as he was transported into a long and narrow corridor. Once he was inside, the dark corridor slowly lit up, revealing countless sculptures lining the walls.

Unfortunately, many of those sculptures had fallen apart, so Long Chen couldn’t tell what they depicted. This damage was likely the result of the failed repair attempts the Heaven Overseer had mentioned. Every attempt to fix this place had only caused more damage until it collapsed.𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

Long Chen continued onward, drawn by a light up ahead. As he approached, he saw a sea of flames. Instantly, he felt a turbulent energy crash over him.

“What terrifying energy fluctuations.”

Long Chen’s heart shook. These fluctuations were somewhat similar to those of a medicinal pill, making it feel like devouring them could rapidly advance his realm.

As he continued down the path, he saw that it led straight into the heart of the sea of flames. When he stepped into the flames, he grew even more shocked. This energy was entering his body without his permission, like millions of resentful spirits invading him.

Long Chen walked to the end of the pathway and saw a circular stone staircase here. However, the steps were cracked, likely beyond repair.

Looking down, Long Chen saw a space below the sea of flames. Jumping down would lead him into it, just as the Heaven Overseer had instructed. But Long Chen remembered the Earth Cauldron’s instructions. Without hesitation, he released the rune that the Earth Cauldron had left in his spiritual space.

The Earth Cauldron’s translucent figure appeared in front of Long Chen, surveying the surroundings. “The damage here is worse than I expected.”

“Senior, how are things on your side?” asked Long Chen.

“Everything is going very smoothly. They are concentrating all their power to help me recover,” said the Earth Cauldron. “I can’t stay here for too long. Come to the control platform.”

Long Chen immediately walked over to a broken platform. The Earth Cauldron directed him to pull off the rubble in search of a notch.

After some searching, Long Chen finally found a concave area covered by a pile of rocks. Clearing the rocks away, he was startled to find a handprint.

“Place your hand there and use your seven-color Supreme Blood to activate it,” instructed the Earth Cauldron.

Long Chen did as instructed. The moment his seven-color Supreme Blood flowed into his palm, it shook intensely.

BOOM!

The sea of flames below exploded, and a pillar of fire surged before Long Chen, revealing a martial stage floating in the air. Simultaneously, strange totem patterns appeared in front of him, varying in complexity: some had one line, some had seven lines, and others had nine.

“Choose the one with seven lines,” said the Earth Cauldron.

Long Chen reached out and touched the seven-line totem.

He was instantly pulled into the martial stage. Before he could fully grasp what was happening, he heard the Earth Cauldron’s voice again.

“These resentful spirits are the immemorial devil spirits killed by the Jiuli race, and the power of their cultivation bases was sealed within them. Over countless years, these resentful spirits have been suffering the curse of the Jiuli race’s flames. They want to escape, but the only way to be free is to release the energy in their bodies. As long as you don’t resist, they will release all their energy into you. Your realm will rapidly increase. However, you should be careful. As they release their energy, they will try to take control over your body. They will try to use the pain they suffered to infect you. Be careful.”

Just then, Long Chen felt like millions of ants were biting his skin. It was painful and itchy. Following the Earth Cauldron’s orders, he lowered his defenses slightly. At that moment, countless streams of energy pierced into him and exploded within his body.

Long Chen felt like he had just devoured tens of thousands of peerless-grade pills. The intense impact almost made him cough up blood.

As this energy exploded within him, his aura rapidly climbed. He was shocked to find that he was about to advance.

“Wait a second!” exclaimed Long Chen.

In the past, he had to struggle to break through his shackles, but this time, he had to hold himself back as much as possible. The more he could hold back, the better. This would keep his foundation super solid.

“Earth energy—seal!”

Long Chen formed hand seals to suppress the power erupting within him, holding back his realm from breaking through.

“Again!”

He took a deep breath and formed another seal, allowing countless streams of energy to pour into him.

Just like this, Long Chen managed to suppress it nine times before he could no longer contain the immense power erupting within him.

BOOM!

Long Chen’s aura exploded, blasting the flames around him away.

“First Heavenstage!”

He cried out in delight, realizing that after igniting his realm and falling, his new first Heavenstage was stronger than his former one.

“Come at me!”

Long Chen raised his head and shouted, as countless flames surrounded him again.
