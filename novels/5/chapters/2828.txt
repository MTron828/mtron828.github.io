Chapter 2817 Public Courtroom

Long Chen’s movements were too quick for them to even track with their eyes. They only saw a sword pierce that person’s head and kill him.

Mu Qingyun’s attempt to rush over ended up meaningless. The battle had ended before it even started.

Blood slowly dripped down that sword. Just as it was about to touch Long Chen’s hand, he let go of the sword. Without anything holding it up, the corpse fell to the ground with a plonk.

The sound wasn’t loud, but it shook people’s hearts like a hammer. That was an expert ranked ninety-seventh on the divine rankings. He was called the Iron Claw Soul Snatcher, a former rogue cultivator who had built up quite a reputation for himself before joining the High Firmament Academy.

This person was a vicious, ruthless killer. When he attacked, his opponents were always killed or crippled. Due to his viciousness, he was highly viewed by Zhong Changsheng. He was someone who only took orders from Zhong Changsheng.

When Zhong Changsheng had told someone to kill Long Chen, he had attacked without hesitation. Regretfully, when it came to killing people, Long Chen was the true master.

If they were competing in martial arts, perhaps Long Chen would require some effort to knock him down. But if Long Chen wanted to kill him? It was as easy as raising his hand.

Everyone was dumbfounded, especially those two women beside Mu Qingyun. Their smiles were completely frozen.

Long Chen had given them a sunshiney, unbending kind of impression. He was like a proud man who would rather break than bend. But with his seemingly weak appearance, they also formed an urge to protect him.

However, no one had expected him to kill his opponent in a single move. Most stunning of all was his expression after killing. Although the two women were also cultivators, they had not experienced much killing.

They had seen others kill. But those people always sneered or acted arrogant after killing their opponents. That arrogance was to cover up their nervousness inside.

However, Long Chen’s expression was flat, without the slightest fluctuation. It was as if he had just done something completely insignificant. That coldness made them shiver.

At this moment, another sword appeared in Long Chen’s hand, and he walked toward Zhong Changsheng, his face still icy.

Upon seeing this, Zhong Changsheng’s heart thumped, and his hair stood on end. He felt like a monster had just set its sights on him. A feeling of mortal danger welled up within him, causing him to jump out of his chair and retreat a few steps.

However, after a few steps, his expression became ugly. He was an expert in the Divine Flame realm. Was he actually afraid of a rookie in the Mortal Transcendence realm?

In front of everyone, he had been scared away by Long Chen. As all his face was lost, his embarrassment transformed into anger. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

“Courting death!”

Zhong Changsheng howled and his divine energy erupted. With him as the core, the disciples around him were blasted away.

This qi wave blew back Long Chen’s hair, flapping his robes. All of a sudden, Long Chen frowned and looked at his robes. He paused.

Seeing him stop, Zhong Changsheng thought that Long Chen was scared by his power, and he stepped forward, smashing a fist at him.

BOOM!

Just at that moment, a palm-image blocked his fist, unleashing a shockwave that made the entire palace shake.

Mu Qingyun had taken action. She forced back Zhong Changsheng and then appeared in front of Long Chen. Although her aura seemed to be on the same level as her opponent’s, when they fought, the difference was instantly made obvious.

“Zhong Changsheng, you are too shameless. You are bullying someone with such dense mortal qi? To be on the same ranking as you is an insult to me,” said Mu Qingyun coldly.

At the same time, Mu Qingyun sighed with relief. She had finally managed to help Long Chen. Although she didn’t know why Long Chen would suddenly pause like that, it just so happened that this was the best time for her to take action.

Zhong Changsheng was forced back several steps, feeling shocked and enraged. He had previously fought against Mu Qingyun a few months ago, but now he found that her divine flame had been purified even more, reaching an almost essence-like level.

Although he always lost against her, he always managed to fight twenty or thirty exchanges before being defeated. However, today, he found that the difference between them had widened.

His blood was flipping inside of him, and he didn’t dare to open his mouth at the moment, for fear of coughing up blood.

“Why aren’t you speaking? Have you realized that you were in the wrong now? You can’t even find a way to retort, isn’t that right?” shouted one of the women beside Mu Qingyun.

“You!” Zhong Changsheng was infuriated, but that one word caused his blood to surge up. He hastily clamped his mouth shut.

“What you? Your Prime Glory Alliance suppressed all newcomers and other competition when you were dominating. What? Are others not allowed to mention all the terrible things you’ve done?” sneered the woman. Her mouth was quite sharp.

Zhong Changsheng clenched his teeth and had to wait until his blood stabilized before speaking. Hence, his face was ashen, almost frighteningly so. As for the people beside him, they didn’t know what was going on with him, but they didn’t dare to interject themselves into this matter.

Zhong Changsheng was a very domineering person. If someone interrupted him, it was considered a sin. So none of his people spoke up.

Suddenly, footsteps rang out and countless disciples in blue robes came rushing in. They had wooden rods in their hands. In just a moment, hundreds of them had surrounded this place.

“No need to worry. These are law enforcement disciples. We just have to follow the process,” explained Mu Qingyun quietly to the surprised Long Chen.

Mu Qingyun was very familiar with the God Institute’s rules. These disciples had gotten used to their fighting, so they almost seemed bored with what they were doing.

“Everyone, come along.” The head disciple didn’t make things hard on them. He spoke woodenly.

These disciples were clearly afraid of Zhong Changsheng and Mu Qingyun’s status, so they didn’t dare to be rude. In this aspect, they were far better than the Pill Institute’s law enforcement disciples.

Everyone was brought along, and Long Chen was surprised to be brought into a courtroom.

However, Mu Qingyun and the others seemed relaxed, as if this was routine for them. They were completely indifferent as they followed the process.

The sharp-tongued woman even said a few comforting words to Long Chen, telling him not to be afraid. This matter was provoked by the other side, so the majority of the blame would fall on them.

However, just as she was comforting him, everyone fell silent. An ancient and skinny elder had walked in. Upon seeing that elder, Mu Qingyun and the others, who were originally filled with confidence, became dumbfounded.

“How can it be him? Now it’s troublesome.” Mu Qingyun’s expression twitched.

“What? Is this old fellow your enemy?” asked Long Chen.

“Who is Long Chen? Stand up.”

Just at this moment, the ancient elder slammed his gavel and shouted.

“Who are you? Is the name Long Chen something that you can shout?”

Long Chen’s lazy voice echoed through the courtroom, dumbfounding everyone. Even Mu Qingyun and the others stared at him in shock as though he was a madman.
