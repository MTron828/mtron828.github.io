Chapter 2573 Tit for Tat

The world shuddered. Although the attacker had yet to appear, with only the spear present, a terrifying pressure was unleashed.

“The idiot Blood race has no right to be arrogant. Let’s see just how much power you have,” sneered Long Chen. He stepped forward, his divine ring and Six Star Battle Armor appearing.

BOOM!

Long Chen’s fist smashed into the spear, unleashing a thundering qi wave that shook the void. As a result, a figure appeared. It was a young man of the Blood race.

He seemed surprised, not having expected Long Chen to block his attack barehanded.

“You have some power. No wonder you dare to be so arrogant. However, the human race is trash. No matter how strong you grow, you’re still just prey in the end. You can’t escape the grasp of the hunter.”

The man from the blood race sneered. With a wave of his hand, Blood Qi filled the air, rapidly growing denser.

This was similar to a domain, a domain powered by his bloodline power. It was strangely similar to the manifestation domains of the Martial Heaven Continent’s experts.

“It’s too early to say who is the prey and who is the hunter. Power will decide everything.” Long Chen snorted and charged forward, ignoring his domain. He sent a kick to the Blood race man’s face.

“What shameless boasting. The Martial Heaven Continent’s lifeforms are like chives that are reaped time and time again,” sneered the Blood race man. He clenched his left hand, and the void twisted. Long Chen was pulled toward him. It was as if the distance between them had been shortened.

The Blood race man stabbed his spear at Long Chen’s heart. It was longer than Long Chen’s leg, so Long Chen would definitely be struck first. It seemed that the Blood race man could control spatial energy within this domain.

“Reaping chives? How laughable. Do you even know how many of you charged onto the continent? Do you know how many of you left alive?” Long Chen snorted.

BOOM!

Long Chen had no choice but to switch targets. His foot landed on the spear, unleashing an explosive qi wave. The spear was thrown off target, and Long Chen unleashed a punch at his opponent’s chest.

With his spear knocked aside, the Blood race man also had to unleash a fist in response. His fist was aimed at Long Chen’s chest as well.

Just at that moment, his chest and fist became covered in blood-colored runes that firmly protected them.

Two explosive sounds rang out. Long Chen and the Blood race man’s fists struck the other’s chests at the same time. As a result, Long Chen flew back with a muffled snort.

As for the Blood race man, the shield he had condensed in front of his chest was shattered, and his chest caved in. He coughed up a mouthful of blood.

Seeing him cough up blood, startled cries rang out from the Blood race’s army. Clearly, this man’s status was extremely high within the Blood race. They hadn’t expected him to be at a disadvantage.

“You’re always beaten like dogs and flee, but you still have the face to act arrogant. Does the Blood race not know what shame is?” sneered Long Chen. However, he was shocked inside. This person was on the level of a Sovereign sprout. Furthermore, his attack was a bit strange, causing Long Chen’s chest to have an itching lingering pain.

Furthermore, his blood had turned sluggish for a moment, almost stopping within his body. This was Long Chen’s first time encountering such an attack.

However, this kind of power could not suppress dragon blood. It only had a small effect before he recovered.

Long Chen flew back as he spoke, arriving right in front of the Blood race man and unleashing another kick to his face.

At this moment, the Blood race man was startled that Long Chen had arrived in front of him. Considering the previous exchange, he didn’t dare to keep fighting Long Chen with just his physical body. Hence, he blocked with his spear.

Long Chen’s foot slammed into the spear and smashed the Blood race man into the ground, leaving a giant hole. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

Long Chen stood in the air, looking down on his opponent. He clasped his hands behind him. “You bragged enough to shake the heavens, but your current appearance doesn’t match up to that arrogance.”

The Blood race’s experts were staring in shock, unable to believe their eyes. The Martial Heaven Continent’s experts began to cheer.

“It seems that this person has an outstanding position within the Blood race. But even he isn't good enough in front of Long Chen.”

“For the Martial Heaven Alliance to have gained such a figure, the heavens are truly looking out for the Righteous path. We’re unified and have such an outstanding figure. We’ve reached an unprecedented level. We can definitely triumph over this tribulation!”

The ones who had arrived were all experts who had lived for countless years, elders who were leaders of their individual sects. To put it frankly, when it came to whether or not they themselves would survive this tribulation, they no longer cared so much. They cared more about whether or not their sects’ inheritances would survive, whether or not their disciples would live. Even if they had to die on the battlefield, they could at least face their ancestors with pride if their sects and disciples survived this tribulation.

Now that Long Chen had soared from an insignificant little figure to the point that he had obtained everyone’s approval, both the junior and senior generation felt increasing confidence in him.

Although he wasn’t too likely to become a Sovereign, they believed that Long Chen could lead the Martial Heaven Alliance to victory.

The old man and Qu Jianying exchanged a smile. Long Chen’s charisma had won over all of these elders. The Martial Heaven Alliance had never been so united before. This proved that their vision was correct.

The land quivered and then exploded. The Blood race man charged out like a shooting star, and killing intent overflowed out of him. Blood-colored flames burned in his eyes.

“Little human, you think you can be arrogant?!” he roared, having entered a crazy state. In the Blood race, he was someone with an immense reputation. But as soon as he arrived here, he was injured and humiliated. This was unacceptable to the Blood race.

The battle had yet to start. Both sides were just looking for advantages, one of which was the morale of the troops. This was extremely important to the battle. Morale was the crux upon which victory or defeat turned.

High morale could lead soldiers to unleash even greater power than their normal peak. But low morale would bring forth fear, lack of confidence, and such immense pressure that their power sharply dropped. They could collapse in the first exchange.

By blocking the Blood race’s army all on his own, Long Chen was giving the Martial Heaven Continent a good head start, raising their morale before the battle even started.

The Blood race’s army was the same. Even if the Martial Heaven Continent had no defenses, they wouldn’t immediately launch an assault. They would show off some of their power first to intimidate the continent’s experts, causing their confidence to crumble.

With Long Chen blocking the way, the countless experts inside the Blood race’s army couldn’t just charge out at him. That would be meaningless toward boosting their morale.

Only by defeating him in a one against one could they raise their morale. The previous elder of the Blood race had realized that Long Chen was extremely powerful, and that there was likely no one who could suppress him for now. That was why he had ordered the Heaven Merging expert to sneak attack and capture him.

Regretfully, that Heaven Merging expert was killed in one blow. As for Long Chen’s new, current opponent, he had just arrived. He was intending on winning back some face, only to face further setbacks.

This man of the Blood race also knew just how important this battle was, so he didn’t hold back. Blood-colored runes whirled out of him, and when his spear pierced through the air, it caused multiple cracks in the void.

This terrifying power proved that he truly was on the level of a Sovereign sprout.

“If I’m not qualified to be arrogant, then are you?” sneered Long Chen. His divine ring suddenly began to spin. His astral spaces lit up, and world energy poured into his arms.

He swung Evilmoon with his full power. He didn’t just want to win, but he wanted to win in an overwhelming fashion.

BOOM!

The two divine items met and unleashed an explosion like that of a star. As a result, the Blood race expert’s spear shattered, and his body was cut in two from the shoulder to his waist.

“Damn, Evilmoon, you really are amazing.” Long Chen was pleasantly surprised. The instant their weapons clashed, Evilmoon’s edge suddenly lit up, unleashing a shocking sharpness that the spear was unable to endure.

Although Long Chen didn’t know that spear’s origin, after just a few exchanges, he was sure that it was an extremely powerful divine item. But it had still been destroyed by Evilmoon.

“I’m finally getting the hang of your new six star power, so I can start to merge with it. Hehe, I didn’t expect it to work so well,” said Evilmoon.

Evilmoon had its own power, but it also needed Long Chen’s power to unleash its full potential. After Long Chen had changed the cultivation method of the Nine Star Hegemon Body Art, Evilmoon had gradually started to be able to merge with a bit of Long Chen’s power. Although it was a very small merger, it was enough to multiply its power from before. Evilmoon also hadn’t expected the rise in power to be so high.

“Kill him!”

Evilmoon and Long Chen shouted at the same time. It then lit up once more as it slashed toward the Blood race expert.

That expert had been cut in two, but the Blood race’s abilities were truly bizarre. He didn’t explode, but this was definitely a serious injury. Hence, if he was hit a second time, he would definitely die.

However, a bone claw suddenly appeared in front of him, blocking Long Chen’s attack and saving his life from the edge of death.

Long Chen’s heart shook. The bone claw’s mysterious runes had dissipated a portion of his attack’s power.

At this moment, the bone claw suddenly lit up with divine light and pierced toward Long Chen’s chest.

Just then, a jade hand appeared, catching the bone claw. After that, the bone claw was instantly covered in frost and then shattered into fragments of ice.
