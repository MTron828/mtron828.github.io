Chapter 5053 Mutual Destruction


Two giant Ten Thousand Dragon Nests were flying like two giant mountains filling the sky, radiating immense divine might.

The new Ten Thousand Dragon Nest was black, with dark qi swirling around it, exuding a ghostly aura as if it had just emerged from the gates of hell. The Nether Qi emanating from it sent chills down one’s spine. This Ten Thousand Dragon Nest belonged to the Netherdragon race, Long Chen’s old friend.

Seeing this nest, Long Chen was speechless. Just what was going on? They hadn’t even reached the Glacial Heaven Domain, but his enemies kept popping up one after another. By the time he was in the Heavenly Flame Devil Domain, wouldn’t his enemies be everywhere?

As the two nests flew alongside each other, their energies clashed, causing both nests to shake violently.

“The Netherdragon race is provoking us,” said Bai Yingxue angrily. This was not the first time the Netherdragon race had targeted the white dragon race.

The Netherdragon race’s betrayal was a great blow to the entire dragon race, inciting the fury among the dragon experts. However, the Netherdragon race was too powerful and had too many branches spread throughout the world. Hence, despite the numerous attempts to eradicate them, they always managed to rise once more.

It was later revealed that the Netherdragon race had the full support of the Brahma Pill Valley and the Netherworld. Many of the Netherdragon race’s branches grew in the minor worlds of those two big factions.

As a result, even if the dragon race succeeded in annihilating all the Netherdragon experts on the surface of the world, it wouldn’t be long before they rose again. 

Meanwhile, due to their continual rejection of the Brahma Pill Valley’s “kind intentions”, the white dragon race faced provocations from various factions. The Netherdragon race was one of those factions.

They carried out the Brahma Pill Valley’s orders like wild dogs, fighting the white dragon race and causing some casualties to both sides.Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Furthermore, the dragon race had lost its former unity due to the Brahma Pill Valley’s infiltration. Many were now merely spectators, taking no action to support the white dragon race.

As a result, the white dragon race had suffered quite a bit in recent years, which was why Bai Yingxuan proposed that they be the first to ring the alarm. Even if all of them died here, if they could sound the alarm for the entire dragon race and unify them against this threat, their deaths would be worthwhile.

Now that they faced the Netherdragon race’s provocation again, even the good-natured Bai Yingxue was angry, killing intent blazing in her eyes.

“What will you do?” asked Bai Yingxuan, suddenly looking at Long Chen.

“As long as Senior can block the three-vein Heaven Saints and above, I can help you eradicate the rest,” replied Long Chen solemnly.

“Damn, well said! That was domineering!” Dragonbone Evilmoon’s excited cry rang out in Long Chen’s mind. It found that Long Chen was getting more warlike and confident. 

When they heard this, Bai Yingxue’s jaw dropped, and Bai Yingxuan jumped a bit. Those were some big words.

“Really?” asked Bai Yingxuan.

“Really,” reassured Long Chen.

“Alright, then we’ll fight!” Bai Yingxuan’s expression instantly grew severe.

Buzz.

All of a sudden, the white dragon race’s Ten Thousand Dragon Nest collided with the Netherdragon race’s nest.

With the white dragon race remaining unresponsive after their nests clashed multiple times, the Netherdragon race assumed the white dragon race would quietly endure as they had before. Hence, they hadn’t anticipated this fierce counterattack.

BOOM!

The two nests crashed into each other, and the immense impact shattered the surrounding mountains, causing even heaven and earth to flicker.

After that, Bai Yingxuan charged out, with Long Chen and Bai Yingxue close behind her. In a flash, she appeared atop the Netherdragon race’s nest, a figure of a white dragon materializing behind her. She raised her palm, aiming it at the core of the nest.

The core was the foundation of the nest, equipped with the toughest defenses. Yet, against fellow dragons, it was ironically the weakest point, as it offered little resistance to dragon might. If Bai Yingxuan’s palm struck true, it would cripple the Ten Thousand Dragon Nest in an instant. But just before her palm landed, two figures flew out of the nest and attacked her, trying to stop her palm.

One of them cried out furiously, “Bai Yingxuan, are you crazy?! Are you declaring war on my Netherdragon race?!”

BOOM!

Bai Yingxuan’s palm fell, carrying the weight of the world. Three heaven vein dragon qis flared around the two Netherdragon experts, yet they were still sent flying.

Long Chen was taken aback at the sight. The joint defense of two three-vein Heaven Saints couldn’t block a single attack from Bai Yingxuan. Moreover, Bai Yingxuan had not summoned her heaven vein dragon qi.

“The Dragon Guard captain is actually a three-vein Heaven Saint,” whispered Bai Yingxue.

“She’s that strong?” replied Long Chen, still in disbelief. Though they were all three-vein Heaven Saints, Bai Yingxuan stood on a different level entirely compared to those two.

“The white dragon race actually has two branches: the Dragon Guard and the Dragon Inheritance. One specializes in offense, and the other in defense. The Dragon Guard is filled with warriors with powerful attacks, and the captain is our strongest warrior,” said Bai Yingxue, staring at her leader worshipfully.

Hearing that, Long Chen understood. It was no wonder that while Bai Yingxue looked so gentle, Bai Yingxuan exuded a heroic and tyrannical aura. Despite sharing the same bloodline, their energies were entirely different. So, the white dragon race had its own internal branches.

Just then, Bai Yingxuan’s palm continued its trajectory after blasting the two elders away. With a deafening impact, her palm struck the Netherdragon race’s Ten Thousand Dragon Nest.

The nest shook violently, cracks spreading from its core like shattered porcelain.

“Have you gone crazy?!” shouted one of the Netherdragon experts.

Seeing that their Ten Thousand Dragon Nest had been half-crippled in an instant, the two elders roared furiously. After that, the nest blazed with light, and it surged toward the two of them.

“Since you want to play, let’s play! You’ve destroyed our Ten Thousand Dragon Nest, so don’t even think about keeping yours! Everyone, move out! Destroy the white dragon race’s nest!” With that, the two elders drew upon the power of their Ten Thousand Dragon Nest and charged at Bai Yingxuan once more.

BOOM!

Countless Netherdragon experts came flying out, flooding forth like a torrent from a broken dam, roaring toward Long Chen.
