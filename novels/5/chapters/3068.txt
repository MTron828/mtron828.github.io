Chapter 3057 Who Do You Like?

What Long Chen hadn’t expected was for the one escorting them to be Bai Shishi’s mother. The white celestial horse spread its transparent wings, unleashing a wave of dream-like ripples. It was as if the entire world was no longer real.

“It’s actually an illusion beast!”

Long Chen’s heart shook. Whenever this celestial beast’s wings shook, ripples spread. Wherever those ripples went, Long Chen felt space constantly transform.

However, Long Chen knew that this wasn’t the result of space changing. It was an illusion.

The celestial horse race was very large, and the illusion celestial horses were their emperors, which possessed an innate ability to unleash illusions.

It wasn’t using a divine ability as the runes on its wings hadn’t even been activated. But every light movement of its wings drew people into an illusion. Even Long Chen felt like the world was no longer real. It was severely impacting his senses.

At this moment, Long Chen and the others got on the war chariot. He then waved goodbye to Zhong Ling and the others before entering. The chariot contained its own extremely large space.

Long Chen found a seat beside a window, and there was a tea table there. Luo Bing, Luo Ning, and Mu Qingyun sat with him.

As for Bai Xiaole, he seemed very familiar with the war chariot. He pressed a button on the wall, and a door appeared with a bedroom inside. He then directly fell asleep on the bed.

In truth, ever since he activated the Three Flower Pupils, he often got sleepy. Whenever there wasn’t something exciting to do, he would sleep.

Long Chen knew that this was the result of his Three Flower Pupils just being activated. He wasn’t used to it yet. Having his eyes open for too long would make him feel weary since he couldn’t control the Three Flower Pupils perfectly yet. Now, energy was constantly leaking out of his eyes. He would be fine after getting used to his new power.

Long Chen had also studied the Three Flower Pupils during this time. Through Bai Xiaole, he learned this technique. But this bloodline eye art was not something he could use despite all his knowledge.

There were many kinds of Three Flower Pupils actually. Different bloodlines would activate different kinds of power from them.

For example, Bai Xiaole’s Three Flower Pupils were a kind of spatial energy control. He could unleash this power on its own, or he could use hand seals to use a divine art with this power.

Since Long Chen didn’t have this bloodline power, his Three Flower Pupils were entirely plagiarized. Based on how Bai Xiaole used his Three Flower Pupils, Long Chen activated them as well. But every time, they were destroyed by that black energy. At the same time, his eyes would be left hurting for a long time.

However, through this continuous testing, he finally had some slight gains. He was now testing how he could use the Three Flower Pupils to unleash the black energy.

The dragon race expert had told him that he had to constantly unleash the black energy to avoid being devoured by it. When Bai Xiaole managed to fully master his Three Flower Pupils, Long Chen would also be able to benefit more.

Now, Long Chen, Luo Bing, Luo Ning, and Mu Qingyun sat by the window, drinking tea. As for Bai Shishi, her face remained cold the entire time. She sat in a corner with her eyes closed.

Young master Changchuan no longer had the feeling of being the moon surrounded by stars. He also found a corner to sit in, learning from Bai Shishi and meditating.

The others were also silent, finding their own spots and sitting. The chariot was so huge that let alone thirty people, even three hundred people would be able to sit inside without feeling crowded.

The celestial horse slowly left the academy. As its wings flapped, it pulled the chariot forward.

Looking outside, time seemed to pass by in bouts. With every break, the scene changed, and in just a few moments, they had left the academy’s land.

“What is going on?” exclaimed Luo Ning.

Long Chen explained, “The celestial horse is so fast that it results in spatial compression, creating disconnected spatial layers. There is a formation on the chariot that blocks the impact of this spatial pressure so you still feel very comfortable inside, but what you see outside is the result of different spacetimes appearing. That’s why they appear one by one. Since we’re just starting, they’re probably afraid we won’t be able to endure the impact of this instantaneous acceleration. After a bit, this illusory feeling will fade.”

“As expected of the High Firmament Academy’s youngest Heaven Master in all of history. You really are knowledgeable.”

Just at this moment, Bai Shishi’s mother walked in, smiling at Long Chen.

The Battle God Palace’s disciples instantly stood at attention and bowed to her, treating her reverently.

Bai Shishi’s mother waved his hand, indicating for everyone not to stand on courtesy. She then turned to Long Chen and the others.

“Can I sit here?”

Luo Bing and the others were overwhelmed. They hastily cleared up a spot for her. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

Long Chen said, “Big sister, please sit.”

“Big sister.”

Bai Shishi’s mother stared at him for a moment before laughing. “You know how to talk. You can take advantage while also curry favor.”

Luo Bing and the others were speechless. He was truly brazen and dared to say anything. He was calling the palace master’s wife big sister? Then wasn’t that placing himself on the same level of seniority as the palace master, as well as putting him above Bai Shishi?

Luo Ning stealthily glanced at Bai Shishi. She saw that she was acting as if she hadn’t heard anything. Her face was as cold as ever. It seemed that she also didn’t feel much warmth toward her mother.

Bai Shishi’s mother then sat down. Every single one of her movements appeared graceful and noble. Even the simple action of her sitting gave people a feeling of solemn dignity.

Furthermore, she possessed a certain warmth that truly made her seem like a gentle big sister. It was very comforting.

“Senior, please have some tea.” Mu Qingyun hastily poured a new cup of tea for her.

Bai Shishi’s mother nodded and smiled in thanks. After sipping it, she put down the cup and looked at Long Chen.

“I’m very curious. If you can talk so well and are so skilled at grasping other people’s thoughts, I’m sure many people will like you. To women especially, this fresh and yet dangerous feeling you have possesses fatal attraction. You’ve always been mysterious, and women are all curious. I don’t understand. These three beautiful women beside you all like you very much.”

At this point, Luo Bing, Mu Qingyun, and Luo Ning turned red. Luo Ning hastily cried out, “I don’t like him!”

“Don’t be anxious. Liking is liking. There’s nothing embarrassing about it. I’m curious, Long Chen, do you have anyone on this flying boat that you like?” asked Bai Shishi’s mother.

When she said this, everyone looked at Long Chen. What was going on? What was she trying to do? In the distance, young master Changchuan tensed up. Even the meditating Bai Shishi’s face twitched.
