Chapter 4648 Going to Tribulation

Space exploded, and in a burst of energy, Dragonbone Evilmoon and Long Chen reappeared in the Ten Thousand Dragon Nest. Their sudden appearance startled the slumbering Dragonblood warriors, rousing them from their sleep.

“Evilmoon!”

When they saw Long Chen’s giant black saber that exuded a sinister air, they were filled with disbelief.

“Hahaha, you still remember me, hahaha!” Evilmoon’s laughter reverberated through the Ten Thousand Dragon Nest, sounding like a demonic roar intertwined with a divine howl. Its echoes shook the entire space.

“Long Chen, you should bring them to undergo tribulation. Meanwhile, I’m going to absorb this Ten Thousand Dragon Nest. Hehe, it's been a while since I've had such a feast,” declared Evilmoon.

“Alright.” Long Chen agreed without hesitation. He immediately gathered everyone. During the time Long Chen undid the seal on Evilmoon, the outside world’s aura had changed immensely, with the laws of the Heavenly Daos being extremely active.

The Ten Thousand Dragon Nest had previously acted as a barrier, blocking off much of the outside world’s aura. However, now they could sense the shifting energy of the Heavenly Daos, which indicated that the laws of this world were undergoing some changes.

“How will I find you afterward?” asked Long Chen.

“You won’t need to find me. I’ll come to you the moment I finish absorbing this Ten Thousand Dragon Nest,” replied Evilmoon.

After saying that, Evilmoon plunged itself into the ground, triggering a violent tremor throughout the entire nest. From its point of impact, tendrils of black qi erupted like a spider web, covering the entire nest in its embrace.

“Alright.”

Long Chen led the Dragonblood Legion out of the Ten Thousand Dragon Nest. As they exited, Evilmoon’s black qi completely engulfed the nest, rendering it indistinguishable from an obsidian mountain.

Guo Ran and the others were still in a daze, bewildered by the sudden turn of events. Upon awakening, they were greeted by the sight of Evilmoon, and before they could ask what was going on, Long Chen swiftly brought them out.

Once they were outside of the nest, they realized that new dragon runes had appeared in their blood, accompanied by a profound strengthening of their physical bodies. They felt invigorated, as if imbued with boundless energy.

This feeling was especially pronounced for Yue Zifeng. Following his decisive sword slash, it seemed as though he had broken through some kind of barrier within himself, propelling him into an even higher realm.

This kind of realm was unclear, unlike any cultivation realm, yet he clearly sensed it. He also felt some kind of blessing supporting him, heightening his senses to unprecedented heights.

“Boss, what happened? I clearly lost, but why do I feel like I won?” asked Yue Zifeng.

“You care too much about victory or defeat. That senior from the Sovereign clan praised you so highly that I felt a twinge of embarrassment on your behalf. As a sword cultivator, one who aspires to reach the realm of no others, no self, no victory, and no defeat will break through all barriers of comprehension. Instead of fixating on winning or losing, focus on the sword in your hand. Whether you win or not isn’t important. What truly matters is whether you can achieve your goals under the pressure of that senior,” answered Long Chen.

Yue Zifeng’s heart shook as he acknowledged his struggle with his mental state. Ever since losing to Luo Changsheng, his mental realm had changed significantly. Though he recognized his issue after conversing with Long Chen, fixing the issue was a different concept.

“Let me put it to you this way. That senior of the Sovereign clan looked down on us at first. However, it was your attack that changed his mind and made him approve of us. This approval led him to bestow the essence blood of his Sovereign scale upon all of you. Now, you should know just how precious the blood in you is. The Sovereign clan is the peak existence of the dragon race, so to obtain his approval is an amazing feat,” said Long Chen.

In truth, upon arriving at the Sovereign clan’s Ten Thousand Dragon Nest, Long Chen had vaguely sensed that he would need the Sovereign clan expert’s approval to get the rewards.

However, Long Chen had some special privileges that could force the Sovereign clan expert to aid him whether he wanted to or not.

On the other hand, the Dragonblood Legion didn’t have that kind of privilege. They had to get the Sovereign clan expert’s approval to obtain the Sovereign scale’s essence blood, and they truly hadn’t disappointed Long Chen. Using their own bravery and perseverance, they ultimately obtained the Sovereign clan expert’s approval.

Yue Zifeng emerged as the greatest contributor to their success. His attack, infused with his unwavering will, revealed the true strength and potential of the Dragonblood Legion to the Sovereign clan expert. It was this display of determination that triggered the expert to share his essence blood with everyone.

The Dragonblood warriors had evolved now. Their power had increased tenfold, and this was only the beginning. The dragon blood had recently entered their bodies and had yet to fully integrate with them. Once they underwent the heavenly tribulation, each of them would completely fuse with their new dragon blood.

Upon learning that they had received the essence blood of the Sovereign clan, from an ancestral dragon no less, the Dragonblood warriors were filled with excitement.

When Yue Zifeng learned that it was his attack that had gotten the Sovereign clan expert’s approval, he felt something changed within him.

Although he didn’t have dragon blood in his body, he could sense the support of the dragon soul and the dragon's blessing. Hence, he was extremely grateful to the Sovereign clan expert.

Despite not having any dragon blood in their bodies, Bai Shishi, Bai Xiaole, and Yu Qingxuan had successfully merged with dragon souls. This union had awakened some of the divine abilities of the dragon race within their minds, presenting them with a significant opportunity for growth.

Among them, Bai Xiaole had particularly benefited from this connection. When he utilized the Three Flower Pupils technique, a dragon image manifested within his pupils, amplifying the power of his technique to a remarkable degree.

It was rumored that the dragon race possessed countless branches and divine abilities, covering a wide array of aspects. Their repertoire might even surpass the variety of magical arts within the human race.

As the emperor of the dragon race, the Sovereign clan and those of its bloodline possessed all of those divine abilities. After the Dragonblood warriors merged with the dragon souls and dragon blood, their inherent magical arts would awaken the corresponding divine abilities and fuse harmoniously together.

If the human race’s magical arts were the seeds, then the Sovereign clan’s essence blood was the fertilizer. No matter what kind of seed it was, once planted on this fertile soil, it would quickly grow.

“Now let’s see how they will block the Dragonblood Legion’s rise! Zifeng, next time you encounter Luo Changsheng, cut his head off!” shouted Gu Yang excitedly.

However, Yue Zifeng shook his head, baffling Gu Yang. “What is it?” 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

Yue Zifeng smiled slightly. “Boss is right. Victory and defeat are things only the weak care so much about. The strong only view defeat as a step toward success. A defeat can also be a step forward. I’m no longer that interested in Luo Changsheng.”

Hearing that, Long Chen also smiled. Yue Zifeng had truly comprehended what he needed to.

“Move out! We’re undergoing tribulation together!”

As Long Chen waved his hand, everyone flew out in high spirits.
