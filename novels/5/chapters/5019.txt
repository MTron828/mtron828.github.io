Chapter 5008 One Sword Shocks All

When the martial stage activated, Zhao Qingyu stood calmly, his giant wolf tooth club resting on the stage. He challenged Qin Feng. “Show me your true power. Otherwise, don’t blame me for not giving you a chance.”

Qin Feng replied indifferently, “Against you, I won’t need to go all out. Besides, I don’t know how to fight on a martial stage. I only know how to kill. Sometimes, you don’t need overwhelming power to kill; you just need to exploit an opening. Perhaps against a dragon, I would need to use my full power, but against a rabbit, it’s a bit overkill to do so.”

Despite Qin Feng’s calm and straightforward words, they sounded remarkably arrogant to everyone present.

“How wildly arrogant!” sneered Zhao Qingyu.

Shaking his head, Qin Feng remarked, “No, I am not qualified to be arrogant. I am merely stating the truth. If you think I’m wildly arrogant, that’s because you haven’t met someone truly arrogant. For example, my boss.”

Qin Feng’s casual yet blunt words struck a nerve among the disciples of the four divine clans, fueling their simmering anger.

“Senior apprentice-brother Qingyu, what are you waiting for? Kill him in one move! Don’t let him use another sinister trick like how he did with Ye Qing!” shouted a Zhao clan disciple.

“Trick?” Qin Feng chuckled. “Are you all idiots? Ye Qing died because he made a fatal mistake, not controlling his power well. I don’t need a trick to deal with idiots.”

Qin Feng’s words were a naked insult to those people, provoking Zhao Qingyu's patience to its limit.

BOOM!

Zhao Qingyu’s Heavenly Fate Ring appeared behind him, unleashing a torrent of berserk Doyen power that imbued his giant wolf tooth club with divine light as he launched his attack.

Qin Feng swiftly sidestepped, narrowly evading the swinging wolf tooth club by a hair’s breadth from his forehead. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

This close shave left Long Ziwei gasping, drenched in sweat. Wasn’t that incredibly dangerous?

Zhao Qingyu continued his onslaught, his wolf tooth club whirling through the air in a series of strikes. In response, Qin Feng retreated and dodged with precision, looking like he barely avoided the attacks. Several times, it looked like he would be hit, so some of the Jiang clan’s female disciples cried out.

Beside them, Long Ziwei clenched his fists nervously, his heart about to pound out of his chest. He couldn’t understand what Qin Feng was doing. Without a weapon, Qin Feng risked his life with each passing moment. If he misstepped, he would die.

Seeing how nervous Long Ziwei was, Feng Fei said, “Among true experts, the difference between victory and defeat can be as narrow as a hair’s breadth. They compete in split-second timing. Sometimes, it may only appear dangerous. But when true danger strikes, you won’t see a thing. Zhao Qingyu looks like he has the upper hand, but he is already halfway to death’s door. If he reveals the slightest opening, he will instantly die.”

“He’s that powerful?” asked Long Ziwei, staring in disbelief.

“If he wasn’t, could he bear the title of a Dragonblood warrior? Would he be qualified to follow Long Chen?” counterasked Feng Fei as she smiled.

Suddenly, Feng Fei sighed. “It’s over.”

Long Ziwei was startled as he saw Zhao Qingyu swing his club one final time before taking a step back. Zhao Qingyu had unleashed a rapid barrage of eighty-one attacks before he wielded his club to push Qin Feng back and reposition himself.

However, just as Zhao Qingyu retreated, Qin Feng suddenly drew his sword, striking like a bolt of lightning on the martial stage. Zhao Qingyu roared, raising his club to block Qin Feng’s attack.

BOOM!

The martial stage shuddered violently. Then, Qin Feng leaped backward, calmly sheathing his sword.

“What? He’s not fighting any longer?”

Seeing Qin Feng sheath his sword, everyone was baffled. They stared at Zhao Qingyu, who still had his club raised, frozen in place.

“What just happened?”

After a moment, a sense of unease spread among the onlookers. Zhao Qingyu’s eyes lost focus, and his body started to tremble.

Suddenly, his wolf tooth club slipped from his grasp and clattered to the ground. A line of blood appeared, running from the top of his head down to his nose, jaw, throat, and abdomen.

In a shocking turn, Zhao Qingyu’s body split apart, cut cleanly in two. Countless cries of astonishment echoed through the arena, and even the referees were taken aback.

“This fellow... that strike definitely resembled Yue Zifeng’s style,” said Long Chen.

Long Chen was also surprised. Qin Feng’s Sword Dao had progressed. It appeared that during Long Chen’s absence, everyone had been diligently improving—except for perhaps one person.

“What’s going on? Zhao Qingyu clearly blocked it!” exclaimed someone.

“He didn’t. It was an optical illusion. The sword was so fast that it cut through the fabric of spacetime. That’s why it appeared like Zhao Qingyu blocked it, but in reality, he was a step too slow. Qin Feng’s sword carried the essence of the Dragonblood Legion’s fourth captain, Yue Zifeng,” praised Feng Fei.

This explanation sent a shiver through the surrounding experts. They might not have been familiar with Yue Zifeng, but if such a formidable sword technique only carried his essence, how powerful was he?

Qin Feng had slain a half-step Heavenly Chosen, shocking everyone present. Moreover, he had achieved this feat without revealing his full power. This mirrored how effortlessly he had crushed Ye Qing.

If one were to pinpoint a difference, it would be that Zhao Qingyu had managed to hold on a few breaths longer. But aside from that, the outcome was no different.

A grand half-step Heavenly Chosen had failed to push Qin Feng to unleash his full strength. Had this world gone crazy?

As everyone stared at Qin Feng in astonishment, his expression remained indifferent, as though the deed he had just performed was inconsequential.

“Can this senseless farce come to an end? You guys haven’t even entered a true battlefield; I feel bad bullying you like this,” said Qin Feng, shaking his head.

“Excuse me?!”

Countless people were enraged. Qin Feng’s words seemed to belittle all the heavenly geniuses present, implying they were mere children in comparison.

“You are too arrogant! Today, I’ll make you pay for your arrogance with blood!” shouted someone from the crowd.

Just then, a figure appeared on the martial stage. It was Ye Lingkong, a true Heavenly Chosen. His sudden appearance startled the crowd, causing gasps and murmurs to ripple through the audience. What was even more shocking, Ye Lingkong’s Heavenly Fate Disk also materialized behind him. With a swift motion, his saber slashed toward Qin Feng’s head.
