Chapter 4603 Brahma Divine Son

“The Nirvana Scripture!”

Long Chen was surprised to hear this person start chanting the Nirvana Scripture. When he chanted, this world twisted and turned, and endless flames gathered around him.

These flames engulfed everything, reducing all the Three Eye experts present to ash. Only the individual whose manifestation the white-robed man inhabited remained alive, shielded by intricate flame runes.

Long Chen found himself trapped in a sea of flames, his eyes scarlet with rage. He clenched his fists so hard that they audibly creaked, a vein throbbing on his forehead.

“Who is Lord Brahma to you?!” Long Chen demanded through gritted teeth, his voice seething with anger.

“Foolish ant! You dare to speak the name of Divine Venerate Brahma so casually?!” sneered the white-robed man, refusing to answer Long Chen’s question.

As the flame gathered, it formed a raging sea of fire, its intense heat engulfing Long Chen and searing not just his body but also his soul.

However, the flames of fury in his heart were even more frightening than these flames. He knew that the person before him was closely related to Lord Brahma.

As for Lord Brahma, he was Long Chen’s mortal enemy—a foe he had never seen before but hated to the core. This animosity ran deep, transcending time itself.

“Bring your real body here. I don’t feel like killing the clone of Lord Brahma’s disciple,” stated Long Chen coldly.

In the end, Long Chen managed to resist his compulsion to beat this man up. After all, the latter was nothing more than a projection clone. Killing it was meaningless. Long Chen wanted to kill his real body.

“Who do you think you are to act so ridiculously self-important?” sneered the white-robed man.

“Foolish one, you don’t know who I am. If you did, you wouldn’t dare to speak to me with such a tone,” responded Long Chen just as disdainfully.

“Oh? You’ve managed to pique my interest. Who are you?” asked the white-robed man.

“You don’t know me, but Lord Brahma does,” replied Long Chen solemnly.

“What nonsense. How could my master know you? Unless... no, it’s impossible. Your spiritual fluctuations aren’t that of a reincarnator or a sealed expert,” retorted the white-robed man.

“Fool, everyone knows Lord Brahma. But do you know who Lord Brahma’s father is?” Long Chen’s voice dripped with scorn.

“I...” The white-robed man was baffled. He was at a loss for an answer because he didn’t know it himself.

“Then do you know?” counter asked the white-robed man.

“Of course.”

“Who is he?”

Long Chen swung his sleeve and patted his own chest. “Tis I. Lord Brahma’s father is me.”

“Blasphemer! Face your death!”

BOOM!

The white-robed man’s hand seals changed, commanding flame dragons to roar within the sea of fire and point at Long Chen with their huge mouths.

Long Chen’s soul tightened as an intense sensation of death swelled within him. Eight dragon mouths locked onto him, but this lock wasn’t imposed by the white-robed man or the flame dragons—it emanated from this world.

Before Long Chen could react, the flame dragons unleashed spheres of fire toward him from all directions—front, back, left, right, above, and below—sealing off every possible escape route. There was nowhere to run, nowhere to hide.

BOOM!

All the spheres of fire exploded around Long Chen at the same time, and the intense impact shattered the void, blasting the laws of the world out of existence.

This was a terrifying divine ability, and its most terrifying aspect was its short cast time. Even an experienced fighter like Long Chen had no time to dodge it.

Amid the blazing flames and twisted space, a black figure came flying out and headed straight for the white-robed figure.

This black figure was naturally Long Chen. He had blood all over him. Perhaps the last attack would have killed him if Huo Linger had not helped him block the majority of its power.

Long Chen realized he had underestimated this guy. What truly unsettled him was not just the man’s power, but his remarkable ability to harness the world’s latent energy. Moreover, he could unleash this power with alarming swiftness, catching Long Chen off guard and leaving him with little time to react.

“Hmm, you’re not dead?”

Seeing Long Chen come flying out, that white-robed man seemed shocked. It seemed that he hadn’t expected this.

Just then, Long Chen had arrived right in front of him. The white-robed man sneered, “You survived by the skin of your teeth, but instead of running, you actually came right at me. I really underestimated your stupidity. You can’t harm me, but I can take your life at any time.”

With a snort, the white-robed man formed one-handed seals, and the chanting in the air suddenly changed. The flames that started to scatter condensed again, and this time, countless flame dragons were attacking Long Chen.

In response, Long Chen ignored this. When he was in front of the white-robed man, his scale-covered hand reached for the white-robed man’s throat.

“Idiot.” the white-robed man sneered and ignored his hand because he didn’t possess a physical body here. Long Chen couldn’t touch him.

Just as he was about to continue with his attack, Long Chen’s hand firmly locked onto his throat.

“What?!”

The white-robed man was taken aback. He then looked at Long Chen and saw that at some point, Long Chen’s left eye had turned completely black, akin to a black hole that could suck in all the stars in the sky.

Within this pitch-black eye, three flowers spun, forcing the white-robed man’s clone to become solid. Long Chen’s hand could then catch it.

“Soul refinement!”

Long Chen let out a howl like a god’s roar. The next moment, the white-robed man quivered, and three flowers appeared in his eyes as well, mirroring the ones in Long Chen’s gaze.

Long Chen’s gaze remained fixed on the white-robed man's eyes, the three flowers within his own eyes spinning in perfect synchronization with those in the white-robed man’s.

Suddenly, the white-robed man’s clone exploded, turning into smoke.

...

On a distant mountain peak, a white-robed man with a fair complexion and shoulder-length hair emitted a furious roar. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

With the roar, he expelled a mouthful of blood, his eyes transforming into a fiery red hue. Black blood started to seep slowly from his eyes, staining his face with its dark hue.

“That damn bastard! Don’t let me find you, or I’ll skin you and refine your soul!”

“Divine son, what happened?!”

This roar drew the attention of countless experts in the surroundings. All of them were seven-star Doyens, and there were thousands of them.

“Convey my commands to everyone! Even if you have to flip the heavens, find that bastard for me!”

With a wave of his hand, the image of a black-robed man appeared in all their minds.

“Yes!”

A terrifying bloodlust filled the sky as they set out on their mission.
