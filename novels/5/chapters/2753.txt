Chapter 2742 The Secret From Back Then

Under Long Chen’s forceful torture, the Heaven Executioner finally spat out the secret of what had happened back then. This story was something that only a few people knew of within the divine families.

Back then, the Long family of the divine families had produced a shocking genius. He reached Netherpassage at eighteen and Heaven Merging at twenty. After three more years, he gave up on focusing on his rapid cultivation, instead roaming the surrounding worlds around the Martial Heaven Continent and comprehending the Heavenly Daos. He then created nine completely unprecedented magical arts and divine abilities.

Within the entire continent, the only one who could compare to him was the Sovereigns, and he was said to be the closest existence to the Sovereigns. All the other heavenly geniuses of that time lost their luster when compared to him.

At that time, the Martial Heaven Continent was in a special period. Some young geniuses from a higher world came to the continent in order to gain experience, and one of them was a woman named Luo Ningshuang.

During this tempering experience on the continent, she was attracted to Long Zhantian, and the two of them ended up quickly falling in love.

Other than them, there was another woman from that group who stayed behind. This person was Long Aotian’s mother.

These disciples were supposed to return to their higher world after their tempering experience, but Luo Ningshuang chose to stay, refusing to leave.

It was said that this matter caused quite a few waves. But since the others who had come with her were unable to force her, and there was no way for stronger experts to descend to this world, she remained behind. It seemed that other things had occurred afterward, but the Heaven Executioner was unaware of those things.

The end result was that Luo Ningshuang stayed behind. Two years later, Long Aotian’s mother gave birth to Long Aotian. He had such astonishing innate talent that it shook the divine families.

However, a year after that, Long Chen was born. This time, the divine families were simply stunned. A mutated Spirit Root, a divine Spirit Bone, and Supreme Spirit Blood. That was an immortal sprout.

According to their information, such a talent was something that might not appear once in ten thousand years even in the higher planes. It was at this time that Long Aotian’s mother came up with the plot to steal Long Chen’s Spirit Blood, Spirit Root, and Spirit Bone for Long Aotian.

As for the Heaven Executioner, he had experience in doing such immensely cruel things, so it was he who Long Aotian’s mother went to.

At that time, Long Aotian had reached a full year in age, which according to the Heaven Executioner was the optimal time for this transplant. However, he didn’t dare to do such a thing.

It was Long Aotian’s mother who stole Long Chen without anyone being aware and forced him to do it, saying that she would kill him if he didn’t. She even said that no matter what happened, she would bear the responsibility for it.

As a result, Long Chen met a cruel fate. Long Aotian’s mother then directly reported her actions to the higher-ups of the divine families after it was done, infuriating them. However, when she revealed her status, they didn’t dare to say anything.

At that time, the Heaven Executioner was not yet qualified to participate in a meeting of that level. However, later he learned that she possessed a particularly terrifying background, and that was why she was so fearless.

Furthermore, things were already done. They had taken Long Chen’s innate talent and transplanted it into Long Aotian. What else could the divine families do? Furthermore, she said that Long Chen was already dead. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

The divine families were infuriated, but what had been done could not be undone. It wasn’t as if they could simply kill Long Aotian as revenge for Long Chen.

They also couldn’t allow Long Zhantian to kill Long Aotian’s mother considering her status. Helplessly, the divine families could only advise Long Zhantian and Luo Ningshuang to calm down and slowly come up with a countermeasure.

However, with their son taken, how could they possibly listen? Long Zhantian and Luo Ningshuang went on a slaughter, killing countless experts of the divine families.

In Long Zhantian’s fury, rivers of blood flowed in his wake. With a cultivation base at the ninth Heavenstage of Heaven Merging, he killed the Saints of the divine families. As a result, the power that the divine families had been accumulating for countless years was wiped out, with less than a tenth surviving.

In the end though, Long Zhantian and Luo Ningshuang were suppressed. What the divine families hadn’t expected was that when Luo Ningshuang saw Long Aotian’s mother, she suddenly recognized the latter. The two of them were actually mortal enemies.

Luo Ningshuang’s status was then revealed and the divine families were horrified. Luo Ningshuang was the daughter of an Immortal King of the higher world. She had only run away due to a falling out with her family.

With Luo Ningshuang’s status also revealed, the remaining higher-ups of the divine families were completely enraged. Long Aotian’s mother was incredibly sinister, using the divine families to land a blow on Luo Ningshuang. Now, the divine families panicked.

Long Aotian’s mother’s status was too great for them to provoke. But behind Luo Ningshuang was an Immortal King, also an existence that they couldn’t offend.

After a long discussion, the divine families chose to send Luo Ningshuang and Long Zhantian to the higher plane, allowing the people there to handle both of them. They didn’t dare to make any judgment on this matter themselves.

As a result, the final two quotas that the Martial Heaven Continent had to send people to the higher plane were used on Long Zhantian and Luo Ningshuang. Due to this, Long Aotian’s mother was forced to stay behind.

It was at this moment that the Martial Heaven Continent lost connection to the higher world. The channel was severed, and as a result, no one knew the current state of Long Zhantian and Luo Ningshuang.

On the other hand, Long Aotian and his mother had an easy life afterward. Due to how gravely wounded the divine families were, they were forced to rely on Long Aotian as a supreme genius.

The higher-ups were always infuriated whenever they thought of this. If it weren’t for this matter, there would be no need for the divine families to go through this play. They might even be able to take all the spoils of this battle for themselves.

This was why this matter was considered taboo in the divine families. The only ones who knew were the true higher-ups. Those who knew some of that information and didn’t have high enough status were forcibly captured and had their memories of it sealed. As the greatest humiliation the divine families had ever suffered, this taboo topic was something few people knew of, and ordinary people didn’t dare to mention it.

Hearing all this, Long Chen sighed with relief. His palms were covered in sweat. The situation he had been most afraid of was that his father and mother were already dead.

His father was a genius who slew Saints at the ninth Heavenstage of Heaven Merging. Considering that this matter couldn’t be blamed on his father, the odds that the divine families would execute him were very low. At the very least, they wouldn’t kill such a powerful genius. As for his mother, with such a background, they wouldn’t dare to kill her.

However, although Long Chen knew that their lives had been spared, he was still anxious. They didn’t even know if their son was still alive, so they were probably wracked with worry about him every day. He didn’t know what state they were in after all that worry.

Long Chen asked a few more questions about the divine families, including matters about the star-field’s core. However, the Heaven Executioner didn’t know too much about this topic. All he knew was that the divine families were simply working together with the other powers. The person with the greatest power would be the one to get the core in the end. There was no fair splitting later on.

“Tell me, how do you use your jade pendant?” asked Long Chen suddenly.

“Why would you ask that? AH!” The Heaven Executioner screamed once more and quickly told Long Chen how to use the jade pendant.

“Alright, you can kill me,” said the Heaven Executioner.

“So you actually dared to scheme against me. You really are asking for it. I was planning on letting you die quickly, but you really want to test me,” sneered Long Chen. “If I kill you, your spiritual jade tablet will shatter. Then the divine families will know what happened here. Do you think I’m an idiot like you?”

Long Chen reached out and tossed the Heaven Executioner’s Yuan Spirit toward Lei Linger. She then devoured the Yuan Spirit, sealing him within her body.

“Let’s go. I can bring you out,” said the Eastern Wasteland Bell. It had managed to find this place through the crack between three minor worlds.

“No. I’m going to start my slaughter from here. This is the only place that leads to the ancestral land of the divine families,” said Long Chen with frosty killing intent.
