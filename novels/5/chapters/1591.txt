Chapter 1586 Settled

“What just happened?”

“He... he lost?”

The disciples who had turned red in the face from cheering for Long Chen were all disappointed.

“You little brats, how old do you think Long Chen is? Did you think he could challenge the old man? He was just letting Long Chen show off his skills before. When he fights seriously, of course Long Chen isn’t a match for him. Hurry up and scram. The ones shouting, you should know that the old man heard it all clearly. Prepare your last testaments and graves!” shouted the seventh boss.

Those disciples’ expressions immediately changed. Long Chen was defeated and the old man’s fury was about to explode. Although it wasn’t as exaggerated as the Seventh Boss made it sound, they would definitely have to suffer a beating.

The seven bosses shooed the disciples away. Glancing at each other, they also vanished, leaving behind only the old man and Long Chen.

The old man looked at Long Chen who was wretchedly crawling up from the ground. He didn’t know what he was feeling now. He knew Long Chen had intentionally let him get that last attack in to give him face.

In that instant, he suddenly felt a great deal of self-blame. Even after living so many years, he had to be so competitive. In that regard, he was even worse than a child.

“Come here.” The old man slowly flew to the mountain peak and called out to Long Chen.

Long Chen patted off the dust and also flew over. He smiled at him. “Old man, you’re still so healthy at your age. I’ll probably need to train for another hundred years.”

“Scram. I haven’t grown senile yet. If you won, then you won. Do you think I need you to let me win?” snorted the old man.

Even someone as powerful as the old man had to admit that Long Chen’s physical body was too monstrous. If they just fought with physical power, then he couldn’t suppress Long Chen.

After all, he was already old, while Long Chen was in his prime. Even if he didn’t want to admit it, he had to accept it.

Although the old man was irritated at losing, he was very proud as well. After all, Long Chen was also a disciple of the Heaven Splitting Battle Sect. His glory was the Heaven Splitting Battle Sect’s glory.

“Child, I can understand what you’re trying to say. But...” said the old man.

“Old man, let’s not talk about that for now. Let me ask you, in your generation of disciples, are you the only one left?”

“Yes. The rest all died, either to heavenly tribulation or on the battlefield,” said the old man with a flash of pain in his eyes. He was recalling his memories of his time as a disciple of the Heaven Splitting Battle Sect.

“Were you unable to protect them because you weren’t strong enough at that time?”

The old man was silent for a long time before simply sighing.

“There’s nothing more painful than watching your comrades die in front of you while powerless to save them. In the Spirit World, I lost five hundred of my good brothers, and I’m profoundly aware of that pain and helplessness. Although I didn’t give up any chance to get stronger, the heavens are simply merciless and are set on pulling away everyone I love. That’s why I swore to one day topple these blind heavens. I feel like I didn’t do enough, but you are even worse. For your own face, you’d betray senior Qu’s good intentions. Don’t be in a hurry to interrupt me. Let me finish. You consider senior Qu’s kindness as a kind of charity, a kind of pity, or perhaps a kind of insult. However, do you remember when I first came to the Heaven Splitting Battle Sect? I will always remember how Boss Bao greeted me with two punches. You said that because I didn’t ask for help from the Heaven Splitting Battle Sect, I didn’t treat you as family. But what about now? Aren’t you also doing the same to senior Qu?”

The old man’s expression changed slightly. Huge waves rose in his heart. People were able to see others clearly, but it was difficult to see oneself clearly because there was no mirror.

Now, Long Chen had raised a mirror in front of him, allowing him to see himself. He was too obstinate, never reflecting on his actions. He was willful and had hurt someone without even knowing it.

Long Chen nodded inside. Things were going well. It was time to strike while the iron was still hot. “Old man, the era is changing. Many powerful existences are reviving, and heavenly geniuses are rising like spring bamboo. When the great era comes, the competition will grow even bloodier. For you, senior Qu is willing to take responsibility for everything that happened in the Eastern Xuan Region. Even though she is a Netherpassage expert, being surrounded by enemies like that is still very dangerous. Why does she do that? Isn’t it because of you? Do you not feel anything after she does so much for you?”

The old man looked into the distance, not saying anything. Long Chen suddenly realized just how strong the old man’s feelings were toward Qu Jianying. However, his pride did not allow him to submit to a woman. The old man felt that accepting the jade case was equivalent to lowering his head to Qu Jianying.

“Old man, what if there comes a day when senior Qu Jianying is besieged by enemies and falls in front of you? How would you feel?” asked Long Chen upon seeing the old man struggling.

“Who would dare?!” Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

The old man immediately stood up, his hair standing on end like an angry lion.

“Don’t say something so laughable. People still dare to target the people beside me no matter how many of them I have killed. I guarantee that sometime in the future, someone will target senior Qu Jianying. Struggling over your decision just because of your pride and face shows that you don’t have senior Qu Jianying in your heart,” said Long Chen.

“Bullshit!” The old man furiously grabbed the jade case in Long Chen’s hand. “Hmph, when have I ever been afraid? Isn’t it just looking through this damn thing?”

Seeing him accept the jade case, Long Chen sighed with relief inside. In truth, the old man truly did care for Qu Jianying. It was just that he cared too much about his face.

Both of them were too obstinate and didn’t know how to properly communicate. As soon as they opened their mouths, it was like gunpowder went off. They always ended up saying tough words, words that could easily hurt the other. They might feel regret over that, but they refused to apologize.

Long Chen knew that one reason the Heaven Splitting Battle Sect could be so unreasonable in the Eastern Xuan Region to the point that no one dared to touch them wasn’t just because of how powerful the old man was. Another part of it was because of Qu Jianying’s secret care.

“What are you smiling about? Do I need to beat you?” The old man raised his staff upon seeing Long Chen’s pleased smile.

Long Chen knew the old man’s character. Since he had accepted it, he wouldn’t go back on it. Long Chen had already succeeded. Having achieved victory, he didn’t hold back his smile.

“Old people shouldn’t be so angry all the time. You should learn from me. A man should be tough to outsiders but magnanimous to their family. Who doesn’t have some flaws? Forgiving others for their mistakes isn’t a bad thing. You forgive others, they forgive you. Sometimes there’s no such thing as fairness between two people or any need to talk about reasons. As a man, carrying a bit more, enduring a bit more, doesn’t that only prove how magnanimous we are? Splitting hairs over minor things, is that how a man should behave? If a woman cries when she’s wronged, then a man must smile and wave it off when he’s wronged. This is another kind of cultivation, an even higher realm. Don’t you think so?” asked Long Chen.

The old man looked up and down Long Chen. He nodded. “No wonder you have so many women and don’t end up fighting with them. You really have some talent in this regard.”

The old man truly admired Long Chen. When he had met Qu Jianying in his youth, the two of them had felt extremely strongly for the other, but their tempers had been too explosive.

Whenever they were together, they would argue or fight. At first, the two of them were mostly evenly matched. When they fought, both sides would win or lose some.

However, later, after Qu Jianying broke through to the Netherpassage realm, their arguments grew worse. After all, Qu Jianying had become a Netherpassage expert, and she wished to guide the old man. However, with her temper, she wasn’t suitable for it.

As for the old man, he had never been good at listening to instructions. Hence, their conflicts grew more intense. Qu Jianying thought that the old man was jealous of her, while the old man thought that Qu Jianying was looking down on him. In the end, both sides said many heartless words, and they stopped seeing each other.

They had finally encountered each other again in the Grand Han, and despite both feeling some remorse, they couldn’t put words to that emotion. Instead, they immediately started arguing again, unable to communicate at all.

That was why the old man admired Long Chen. He had always thought Long Chen was a monster for being able to have so many beautiful women who never argued with each other or with him.

In the end, the Heaven Splitting Battle Sect was packed with men. The women played the traditional role of a housewife in the background. Even if there were female disciples, they were all tomboy fighters.

The male disciples all had similar tempers, and that wasn’t something most women liked. As a result, Long Chen was like an exotic animal in that regard.

“Hehe, do you need me to teach you a few tricks?” laughed Long Chen.

“Alright- tch, what are you talking about? Who would need tricks from a little brat like you? Let me just see what’s so interesting about the Netherpassage realm.” The old man was just about to agree when his face flushed. At his age, what was he supposed to learn from a child? How to pick up girls?

Seeing the old man was about to drive him off to open the jade case, Long Chen hastily cried, “Wait a moment! I didn’t just come for this. I need you to teach me the final forms of Split the Heavens!”

“You want me to personally teach you? Hehe, don’t worry, I’ll properly train you!” The old man’s eyes suddenly brightened.

Long Chen felt a chill. This old fellow wouldn't be thinking of getting revenge, would he?!

“Ah, I originally wanted you to teach me, but now I see you’re so busy. Having Boss Bao teach me would be the same, so I’ll take my leave now.” Long Chen stood to leave.

However, he was caught by the old man. “Little brat, weren’t you bragging so arrogantly just now? Today, I’ll properly drill Split the Heavens into you until I’m satisfied.”
