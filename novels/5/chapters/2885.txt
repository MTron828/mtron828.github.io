Chapter 2874 Devil Domain

That person’s voice was like thunder through the air. Echoes continued to ring out, spreading further and further.

With such a huge disturbance, countless experts of the God Institute were rushing over. But when they saw those experts in the air, they all had reverent expressions.

Suddenly, the void shuddered and a figure appeared. This was also a middle-aged man, but one of his sleeves blew in the breeze. He was missing an arm.

The pockmarked elder’s expression suddenly grew exceedingly ugly. He was filled with terror. Others might not recognize the middle-aged man, but he knew that this was the head judge of the Discipline Institute. Other than the institute head, he was the one with the greatest authority in the Discipline Institute.

There were three positions below the institute head with the greatest authority. If there was a major trial, the three of them could make a decision that could even overturn the institute head’s opinion.

This person was the head of those three positions. His status was extremely high, but he came out with just a roar from one of these experts.

“Junior brother Wang Chong greets senior apprentice-brother Zhan Feng,” said the head judge, bowing toward that man. It seemed as if the two were old acquaintances.

That Zhan Feng looked at the head judge, and a trace of sorrow appeared in his eyes. “Brother, after just a few years, the sharpness in your eyes has vanished. It’s painful thinking of the days we fought alongside each other.”

The head judge nodded. “Cultivating is like rowing a boat against the flow. If you don’t advance, you recede. I’ve managed to fully expel the devil poison over these years, but my Dao-heart is already covered in dust. I can no longer regain my old sharpness. But seeing all my senior apprentice-brothers as fierce as ever is comforting.”

Zhan Feng walked over to the head judge and patted his shoulder forcefully. “It’s alright. There are millions of paths in life. Every single one can manifest different wonders. I called you today because of this junior brother’s matter. I trust that you will be able to exact a fair accounting for this. The battle in the devil domain is pressing, and we have to leave soon. I also wanted to see you before leaving. Who knows whether or not any of us will live to return? I’m glad to have seen you again.”

“The devil domain…” The head judge was startled.

Zhan Feng raised his hand. “This isn’t the place to talk about it. I leave things here to you.”

“Senior apprentice-brother Zhan Feng, be at ease,” promised the head judge.

Zhan Feng nodded. After that, his figure vanished, reappearing in front of Long Chen. He looked at him, his gaze as sharp as a sword. It was as if he could see through a person’s soul.

“Your sword. It is rusty.”

“Perhaps it’s a kind of settling. But the corrosion will not reach my true heart,” replied Long Chen.

Zhan Feng nodded. With a faint smile, he also patted Long Chen’s shoulder. “A real man doesn’t need to learn how to conceal their light. The stronger you are, the more responsibility you bear. Junior brother, don’t slack. Grow up quickly. A dragon must soar. How can it muddle with a bunch of mudfish?”

“Junior brother understands.” Long Chen nodded. This Zhan Feng was a true expert just like the Divine Lightning Elder. He was an expert that had killed his way out of mountains of corpses.

This was why they were the same. This was why when Long Chen asked for their help, they directly called out the head judge.

Zhan Feng nodded, and his figure vanished once more. The other experts then cupped their fists toward the head judge and also left. One of them said to Long Chen, “Junior brother, don’t waste time here. Men should go to an even more marvelous world.”

They all vanished just like that, stunning the disciples. To vanish into the void, that was spatial energy. Even Four Peak experts weren’t capable of it.

“What is going on?” The head judge’s gaze swept over the crowd and fell onto the pockmarked elder.

“Reporting, this junior received a report that Long Chen maliciously slaughtered hundreds of disciples from the academy! His crimes are cruel and endless. This junior set up a trap here to capture him in order to investigate this matter clearly!” said the pockmarked elder.

“Tell the truth. Was it to capture and investigate, or to kill and keep the truth quiet? The dead can’t testify, right?” sneered Long Chen.

“How dare you spout your nonsense here?! As an Elder of the Discipline Institute, I don’t even have the authority to punish you. How could I kill you?” raged the elder.

“What a joke. When did the Discipline Institute start acting so sneakily?” said Long Chen disdainfully. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

“This matter is too big, and you can’t be allowed to run away after committing such crimes. The Discipline Institute would be blamed for such a thing,” quibbled the pockmarked elder.

Even as the two of them made their statements, the head judge simply listened, not saying anything.

“Because this matter is too big? Do you take me for a fool? You dare to lie in front of the head judge?” demanded Long Chen scornfully.

“How did I lie? All you do is slander others to cover up for yourself!” raged the pockmarked elder. But this rage was faked since Long Chen saw terror in his eyes. That made him confident. Since Zhan Feng had left things to the head judge, the latter would definitely make an impartial ruling.

The pockmarked elder’s panicked way of casting suspicion off of himself was enough to show that this was not part of his expectations. Long Chen sneered inside. As expected, this kind of person didn’t have much intelligence.

They were truly mudfish. When fighting with them, victory didn’t mean anything. It was nothing worth being proud of. Hence, Zhan Feng didn’t wish for Long Chen to waste his precious time on them.

However, Long Chen knew himself. In the immortal world, he had no backer and no foundation, so he had to build a solid foundation first. He had no one in the immortal world that he could trust, so he had to rely on himself for everything. Only once he had made a solid foundation for himself could he truly reveal his sharpness.

Otherwise, a large tree with no roots would only be in greater danger the bigger it grew. A single gust of wind would rip it up. Now was not the time to reveal himself.

“You say that I’m slandering you. Then let me ask you, since capturing people is the job of the Law Enforcement Hall, when did it become the duty of the Discipline Institute to directly attack others? Is that part of the rules? Don’t say that there wasn’t enough time to report it. Your only responsibility is to report it. Whether or not the Law Enforcement Hall can do their job is entirely outside of your jurisdiction and not your responsibility. Normally, your Discipline Institute is so inefficient that you barely keep up. Why is it that you’re in such a rush when it comes to me? Is it that you’re willing to go all-out after getting paid off by Chu Kuang?” sneered Long Chen.

“You… you’re simply slandering others!” The pockmarked elder’s face turned purple.

The head judge’s presence put him under immense pressure, and all the fear inside of him was dragged out by Long Chen. It was clear to everyone.

“Tell Chu Kuang to come. We’re opening the first grade trial hall.” The head judge’s expression was cold. His orders caused a resounding bell to ring throughout the God Institute.

The sound of that bell caused the terror in the pockmarked elder’s eyes to grow even denser. His body even began to quiver.
