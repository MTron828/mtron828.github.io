Chapter 2193 Twelfth Heavenstage of Life Star

“Hahaha!”

Shi Lingfeng laughed wildly as a giant figure stood behind him. That was an expert of the stone race covered in crystals. There was a third eye on his forehead. His gaze was icy, and a terrifying pressure came from him.

“The three-eyed Stone Emperor, Shi Changsheng.”

The senior generation cried out as they recognized the person within Shi Lingfeng’s manifestation. That was Shi Changsheng.

“Stone Forest Manifests Long Life!”

Shi Lingfeng shouted. His manifestation rumbled as immense power shot out of it. Mountains collapsed, and even the qi flow stream he was in twisted.

When Shi Lingfeng shouted the name of his manifestation, the wind and clouds flickered. A sacred energy came from Shi Lingfeng.

At this time, Long Chen wasn’t paying attention to anything outside himself. He was still crazily consuming pills. Another explosion came from his body, and his flesh split open.

“The eleventh Heavenstage! Good! I hope I can make it in time.”

Long Chen’s eyes were red as the pill toxins grew worse. But without hesitation, he consumed more pills.

These pills had been refined by the Moon and Star Refining Furnace. The more pills it refined, the greater its power grew. Several new runes had activated within it. The runes could create nine smaller furnaces within it, allowing it to refine nine furnaces of pills at one time.

During the past few days, Long Chen hadn’t done anything other than refining Life Star Pills. Now they finally had a use.

However, after reaching the ninth Heavenstage, Long Chen suppressed his aura, not allowing others to sense his aura continuing to explode. Otherwise, they would suspect something about his Nine Star Hegemon Body Art.

As a result of suppressing his aura, the impact on his body worsened, making each advancement cause an even greater pressure on his body.

Dongfang Yuyang and the others’ auras transformed. Heaven and earth were shaking due to their existence. Even amongst the heavenly geniuses present, they were clearly marked as the true favorites of the world, the future rulers of the continent.

The qi flow streams had yet to stop, but they were starting to show signs of weakening. The qi flow eruption was nearing its end.

When people looked toward the sea demon race, their hearts shook. There were actually five experts amongst the sea demons who had similar auras as Ximen Tianxiong and the others. Their Spirit Blood had been activated.

However, those five didn’t move after activating their Spirit Blood. They simply stood guard over the Six Horn Sea Serpent man. His eyes were closed, and it seemed he was still a bit away from reaching full power.

Seeing that Long Chen still focused on advancing, a cold light appeared in Shi Lingfeng’s eyes. He suddenly shot over to the Dragonblood Legion.

“Long Chen, I can’t wait any longer. I’ll take your head right now!” Shi Lingfeng shot over on his own.

The ground split open as Li Qi and Song Mingyuan both summoned an earth giant. The two earth giants swung giant hammers at Shi Lingfeng.

“Scram! In front of my current self, you are just two ants!” Golden light radiated out of Shi Lingfeng. He punched, and the figure within his manifestation also punched.

A giant fist landed, shattering space. The immense power blew apart the earth giants before the first even touched them.

Li Qi and Song Mingyuan’s expressions changed. They began to summon one giant earth wall after another.

The earthen walls were destroyed one by one. A total of one hundred and eighteen of them were blown through before that single fist’s power was exhausted.

“Is this the power of activating one’s Spirit Blood and fully awakening a heavens’ soul manifestation?!” People were shocked by this scene. The current Shi Lingfeng could no longer be compared to the old Shi Lingfeng.

“A prerequisite to activating a heavens’ soul manifestation is activating the Spirit Blood. Only with the Spirit Blood awakened is it possible to connect to a heavens’ soul manifestation. Now, not only has Shi Lingfeng awakened the power of his bloodline, but he can also use the Stone Emperor’s divine abilities through his manifestation. There might not be anyone who can stop him,” sighed another person.

“Have a taste of another punch!” Shi Lingfeng attacked once more.

BOOM!

This time, the fist exploded halfway there. It was blown to bits by an arrow.

“Even receiving a hundred punches would be no problem.” Mo Nian had stepped forward. The two figures within his manifestation were finally clear.

They were two handsome men with sharp eyes. The two of them didn’t seem to be emitting any fluctuations or giving off any sense of danger, but the laws of heaven and earth were drawn to them.

The bow in Mo Nian’s hand began to buzz. At some unknown time, a pair of arm protectors with gloves that didn’t cover his fingers had appeared on his arms. The black bracers had blood-colored runes pulsing on them in accordance with his manifestation.

Mo Nian pulled back the bowstring, and a translucent arrow appeared. A giant whirlpool showed up around Mo Nian. In the instant that he pulled back the bowstring, all the surrounding baleful qi was absorbed by his arrow.

“Mo Gate Hidden Dual Sages!”

Mo Nian’s manifestation shook. His arrow shot out like a bolt of lightning.

Shi Lingfeng had no chance to dodge it. The energy of heaven and earth had locked this arrow onto him. With a shout, he crossed his arms in front of him. The figure within his manifestation also crossed its arms.

Mo Nian’s arrow smashed into both sets of arms. Shi Lingfeng was forced back, leaving a long ditch in the ground.

“This is the power of a heavens’ soul manifestation? It’s too powerful! Just being struck by the outer edges is enough to destroy us!” Other Empyreans stared in shock at this power.

Mo Nian immediately pulled back his bowstring and unleashed another arrow.

“He...”

All the experts were shocked. Was this terrifying arrow just a casual attack? Was it nothing more than an ordinary attack for the current Mo Nian? Was he really human?

Shi Lingfeng smashed his fist forward, blasting apart the arrow, but he was forced back nine steps, the earth crumbling with each step.

Some weaker people in the qi flow streams in his path were forced to flee upon seeing him stumbling into their area.

“Mo Nian, I didn’t expect your Mo family would transform two skeletons into your Mo Gate’s inherited manifestation. How laughable.” Xue Luocha tottered over to Mo Nian, her meteor hammer in her hand.

Mo Nian’s expression immediately darkened, a vein pulsing on his forehead. “The Blood Emperor’s family is full of ungrateful pieces of shit. If I don’t slaughter you today, I won’t be called Mo Nian!” Multiple arrows shot out.

“The Mo family is just a dog my Xue family raised. If you were obedient, we’d treat you well. If you weren’t, then we’d kill you for meat. What’s wrong with that?” Xue Luocha sneered. An imposing man with a crown on his head appeared within her manifestation, unleashing a wave of divine might. She smashed her meteor hammer at him.

Following Xue Luocha, all the ancient family alliance’s disciples were forced to flee. Powerful explosions shook the sky as the meteor hammer blasted through the arrows. Some of the slower disciples to run were blown away, coughing up blood.

“Slut, I’ll definitely kill you today”! Mo Nian roared, truly infuriated. Ten thousand arrows shot out of his bow, raining down on Xue Luocha.

Xue Luocha was enveloped by the rain of arrows, but even from within that rain of arrows, she sent her meteor hammer smashing toward Mo Nian.

As Mo Nian and Xue Luocha began a berserk fight, Shi Lingfeng rushed back, going toward Long Chen who was still consuming pills.

“Kill Long Chen together!” Tian Xiezi also stepped forward. Unexpectedly, a divine halo appeared behind his head.

“A divine son?!”

Shocked cries rang out. After awakening his heavens’ soul manifestation, Tian Xiezi had actually gained the approval of the Corrupt God and was blessed by the divine halo, turning him into the Corrupt path’s divine son.

Kun Pengzi and Dongfang Yuyang also took action, taking advantage of this time.

The curious thing was that Ximen Tianxiong, who had previously attacked, was now just quietly looking at Long Chen, seeming to be thinking about something.

“Boss isn’t ready yet. We’ll win time for him,” said Guo Ran solemnly.

“No need. I’m done.”

Suddenly, Long Chen stopped stuffing pills into his mouth. Just at this moment, the qi flow streams slowed down and faded away. The earth closed once more.

“Boss!”

Guo Ran and the others were shocked by Long Chen’s current state. He was covered in blood, and even his bones were exposed in several spots. His eyes were fiery-red, and his aura was completely unstable. It looked like he might explode at any moment.

“I’m fine. Fall back to the exit. I’ll handle things here.” Long Chen’s voice was so hoarse that it was almost unrecognizable.

Guo Ran waved his hand, and the Dragonblood warriors jumped onto the backs of the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrows. They retreated, leaving only Long Chen.

“Die!”

Tian Xiezi, Kun Pengzi, Shi Lingfeng, and Dongfang Yuyang attacked at the same time. Streaks of divine light shot at Long Chen.

“Scram!”

Long Chen suddenly let out a furious roar that was like thunder. A berserk aura erupted out of his control.
