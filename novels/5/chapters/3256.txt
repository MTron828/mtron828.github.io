Chapter 3245 Helping Each Other

“He’s so powerful?” asked Long Chen.

“Yes, he is powerful. But… he is being chased down by the experts of countless sects and powers. There is no lack of Immortal Kings and World Kings amongst them,” said Zheng Wenlong.

“What?! What did he do?”

Long Chen was shocked. He had thought that he himself was already strong enough, but he hadn’t expected Mo Nian to be even more ruthless. He was actually being chased by experts on that level but was still able to stay alive?

Zheng Wenlong smiled bitterly. “Mo Nian has resumed his old trade. He is studying all kinds of ancient tombs every day, and he’s not picky. Anything he sets his sights on, he will directly excavate. It doesn’t matter what the status of the master of the tomb is, or what kind of place it is. It is said that he has joined the Immeasurable Palace, apprenticing himself under Daoist Que De. It is said that his master is also the target of hate from the entire immortal world. As for Mo Nian, it is truly a case of the student surpassing the master. His graverobbing talent is not at all inferior to his master. Most importantly, his guts are quite big. Even being hunted down, he continues to rob more graves. Wherever he goes, he visits the tombs as well. It’s even more of a rampage than his master back in the day. He has three priceless treasures on him, a drab helmet, some worn-out boots, and a shovel. These three things make it so that even Immortal Kings are helpless against him. Even when World Kings come for him, he can still flee. Tell me, don’t you think he’s terrifying?”

“Damn, even World Kings can’t capture him. Mo Nian’s doing quite well,” said Long Chen, growing envious. It seemed that this fellow had found himself a good master.

“As for the news about the others, I haven’t heard anything. The only reason I heard about Mo Nian is because he’s notorious in the immortal world. It’s been over a year since I ascended to the immortal world. However, almost all my time is spent on studying the immortal world’s treasures and knowledge. I also study appraising techniques from my seniors. This is fundamental to all disciples of the Huayun Trading Company, as every merchant must have a master-level skill in this regard. Just as I smoothly finished this apprenticeship and was preparing to start my business, you appeared.” Zheng Wenlong smiled.

Long Chen nodded. Knowing that Mo Nian was doing so well gave him peace of mind.

Following that, Long Chen told Zheng Wenlong about what he needed. The materials for refining Four Peak pills and the essence blood of spirit beasts could all be provided by Zheng Wenlong.

The only problem was that Long Chen was asking for as many of those ingredients as possible. As Zheng Wenlong had just started his business, there was no way he could act as he had on the Martial Heaven Continent, where he could directly provide anything. There were still many restrictions on him, and he didn’t have that much authority in the Huayun Trading Company.

Knowing this, Long Chen didn’t waste words. He took out a hundred thousand Divine Whisker Daffodils and hundreds of thousands of various top grade spirit pills. Moreover, there were also two thousand treasure pills and quite a few Wood Foundation Divine Trees. Upon seeing this many treasures, Zheng Wenlong was instantly delighted. Long Chen had never disappointed him.

These Divine Whisker Daffodils were filled with spiritual qi, so even a single one of them could be sold for a great price. What about a hundred thousand then? That was a terrifying number.

Other than that, the medicinal pills could also be sold for an unimaginable price. In order for the Moon and Star Refining Furnace to quickly grow, Huo Long had never paused, so the two of them were constantly refining pills. However, most of the pills were no longer useful to Long Chen, and it just so happened that he could leave them to Zheng Wenlong.

Zheng Wenlong was truly worthy of being an elite businessman. He actually recognized the Wood Foundation Divine Trees. At that moment, he was completely dumbfounded.

“Long Chen. This thing…” Zheng Wenlong not only recognized it, but through the patterns of the wood, he could tell just how great these Wood Foundation Divine Trees were. A Wood Foundation Divine Tree capable of bearing fruit! If others knew that someone had cut off the branches of such a treasure, they would definitely curse this person to death.

“As long as you can sell it, I can get you more. I need all kinds of materials urgently as we need to hurry and charge forward. So can it be sold?” asked Long Chen.

“Of course. It can be sold for a very high price. Wood element Immortal Kings can turn the wood into goods, and they can insert wood spiritual energy into it as well. It’s the best thing for assisting the cultivation of a wood element disciple. It’s a treasure for families focusing on wood element cultivation,” said Zheng Wenlong.

“Then how to deal with them will be up to you. I need the resources that I mentioned. Once you return to the Huayun Trading Company, make an assessment and get me those materials for Four Peak pills. It doesn’t matter what element the materials are: metal, wood, water, fire, earth, wind, lightning, light, dark, blood, bone, muscle, or soul. As long as they can be used for Four Peak pills, gather them. If those elements can’t be used on my side, I’ll refine them into pills and you can sell them. I can work fast and won’t make it hard on you,” said Long Chen.

What he was lacking the most was Four Peak pills because the Luo family had so many Four Peak experts. Although the High Firmament Academy definitely had the materials to make the pills, the amount that Long Chen required was astonishing. He couldn’t make things hard on the academy. After all, this was the Luo family’s matter. To use the academy’s things to raise the Luo family’s talents was inappropriate.

“Alright, I’ll bring these goods away, and I’ll immediately start sending you things.” Zheng Wenlong gave Long Chen a list with the names, qualities, amounts, and production dates of various treasures that he had. Even though he was so familiar with Long Chen, giving this list was part of his duties as part of the Huayun Trading Company. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

Once Zheng Wenlong left, Long Chen finally thought of those experts that had come from outside the domain. When he asked about them, he learned that Qin Feng had gathered them at the martial stage so that they could exchange pointers with the academy’s disciples.

Unfortunately, they were disappointed to find that these experts were not strong. On his own Xu Zixiong defeated eighteen of them in a row, with not one person being able to exchange more than three blows with him. In the end, he was bored and had the newcomer Primals who had joined the academy fight them.

However, Xu Zixiong didn’t laugh at them. He knew that when he had first come, he wasn’t much stronger than them. During this time, the reason a gap had been made between them was because he had gone to the Luo family’s Honing Heavenly Staircase, which allowed him to sharpen himself.

He was filled with gratitude toward Long Chen, as well as rejoicing in the fact that he had made the right choice back then. If he hadn’t gotten so hot-headed as to run to the Heavenly Swell Domain, would he possibly be as powerful as he was right now?

The fights between these experts and the academy’s newcomer Primals resulted in those experts only winning a minority of the fights. Moreover, when they learned that Xu Zixiong was nothing more than the weakest person amongst Long Chen’s subordinates, they almost coughed up blood.

They had seen a recording of Qin Feng fighting, and they felt that he was nothing more than a footman. But when Xu Zixiong said that he couldn’t even receive three blows from him, those geniuses were dumbfounded. How come they didn’t see anything outstanding in their photographic jades?

Photographic jades only recorded images but not the true profundities of a person, let alone that invisible pressure and might that appeared on the battlefield.

“I’d advise you to not waste time and join the High Firmament Academy like me. Just follow boss as well,” shouted Xu Zixiong.

Those experts stared at him. That was actually a very moving thought.
