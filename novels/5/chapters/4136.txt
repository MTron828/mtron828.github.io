Chapter 4125: Count Yourself Vicious

The vice leader’s fury was almost out of control. In all his life, he had never suffered such humiliation before.

Moreover, this humiliation was not just his own but also the entire Heavenly Tiger race’s. Unable to accept such disgrace, his killing intent almost took solid form.

In an instant, all the Heavenly Tiger race’s experts entered a combat-ready state. In response, the Fullmoon experts also summoned their manifestations. After all, this was their territory. They would not permit the Heavenly Tiger race to run rampant here.

They were also very moved by how Long Chen had beaten up the Heavenly Tiger race’s vice leader. The Heavenly Tiger race was always aggressive and arrogant, so the Fullmoon race had swallowed a great deal of anger when it came to them. Due to this, Long Chen’s actions were particularly satisfying to them.

As for the Dragonblood warriors, their hands were on the hilts of their swords, their bodies bent like leopards eyeing their prey, ready to unleash a thunderous blow at any moment. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

At this moment, the Dragonblood warriors were filled with fanatic excitement. They seemed to be hoping for the other side to attack, so they could unleash an unbridled counterattack.

As the vice leader’s wound was healing, he did his best to stay calm as he had lost the initiative. Also, he was no longer in his top condition.

If he were to fight and force out Xu Jianxiong, they might not be able to retreat unscathed. But he also wanted to personally kill this brat who had humiliated him to win back his face.

If he did attack though, they would have to fight the entire Fullmoon race, and there would be no going back.

Actually, he had been assigned to investigate the Fullmoon race this time, not fighting them. After all, their Heavenly Tiger race had not made any preparations to fight to the death against the Fullmoon race.

Upon thinking of this, his expression changed multiple times. He was now riding a tiger and couldn’t get off, being in a terrible dilemma. If he attacked, the entire situation would go out of control. But if he didn’t, the Heavenly Tiger race would lose face.

At this moment, the Fullmoon race’s experts also longed for a war. After all, this place was the Fullmoon race’s land, so once the battle started, these people would not leave alive.

As for the consequences of this battle, they didn’t care too much. Now, all their pent-up anger had to be relieved somewhere, otherwise, they would explode.

Time passed bit by bit. Finally, Guo Ran impatiently said, “Hey, are you going to make a move or not? What are you waiting for? How can someone like you be the vice leader of your race? Your face was beaten until it’s swollen like a pig’s face, but you don’t dare to even make a sound? What are you afraid of? Take out your blade and fight! Even if you die, so what? Protecting your race’s dignity is the most important thing, coward!”

Guo Ran intentionally provoked them, as if afraid that he wouldn’t get to fight.

“Shut up!” The vice leader felt like he would explode.

However, he still retained a trace of his rationality. If they were to fight, Xu Jianxiong definitely wouldn’t watch as his people were slain. He would go all-out.

He even suspected that this was a trap designed to bait them into attacking so that Xu Jianxiong would have a righteous reason for slaughtering them.

“Xu Jianxiong, what are you doing?! Come out!” shouted the vice leader.

His voice echoed throughout every corner of the Fullmoon race’s land. However, no one answered. It was unknown if it was because Xu Jianxiong couldn’t be bothered to answer him, or if he truly couldn’t hear him while in seclusion.

“Alright, that’s enough. Instead of being a proper tiger, you decided to become Lord Brahma’s dog. Is his dog food really so delicious? Also, the race leader will not be seeing you, so you don’t need to waste time shouting for him. You came as Lord Brahma’s advance troops to probe the Fullmoon race’s power. To put it frankly, you are already enemies with the Fullmoon race. Fortunately, I’m not from the Fullmoon race, or with my character, I would definitely cut off your head and send it back to your people. Let us not mince words. If you want to probe the Fullmoon race’s power, come try it with your life. Don’t play games. That brat behind you was sent to compete with Xu Changchuan, right? Do you want to know his power as well?” Long Chen pointed at that Supreme heavenly genius from the Heavenly Tiger race.

Long Chen continued, “If you win, you can humiliate Xu Changchuan, and you can bring the traitors along with you to show off as well. Anyway, I really admire your guts. It seems that you don’t know how the character for Death is written. The race leader can’t be bothered with you at the moment, so there’s only one thing left for you to do. Do you want to fight, or do you want to scram? There is no third option.”

Long Chen’s tone was not polite at all, but he was extremely clear. Putting it frankly, they were enemies.

Although things had not truly progressed to a full-blown war yet, it was only a matter of time. If they wanted to make it official, they could come at the Fullmoon race’s experts now.

“Hmph, what qualification do you have to speak? If you have the guts, come out and fight me. We can decide life and death right now,” shouted the Supreme heavenly genius.

After all, he was an extremely powerful heavenly genius with the utmost confidence in himself. Although Long Chen had beaten up his vice leader, this heavenly genius thought that Long Chen had only caught the vice leader off-guard, and this didn’t prove anything.

Therefore, he challenged Long Chen to kill him and win back the face of the Heavenly Tiger race.

Although their goal in coming here had been exposed, as long as they killed Long Chen, it would count as a victory, and it wouldn’t be too embarrassing for them.

“You think you can test me?” Long Chen eyed him and shook his head. “Give it up. I have killed countless people, and I don’t mind killing another one. However, leaving your life to Xu Changchuan is much better. It’s not convenient for me to kill you.”

“You…!” The Supreme heavenly genius was enraged. This was a naked despise for him. When had he ever been looked down so contemptuously? At this moment, his Blood Qi began to rise along with a terrifying pressure.

The vice leader suddenly extended a hand, blocking that young man. After that, he looked at Long Chen coldly. “Brat, count yourself vicious. However, you’ve brought on a calamity for yourself. You will regret it.”

“Alright, if you’re already running away, do you need to play a prelude as well? Just scram. No one wants to listen to you,” said Long Chen lazily, no longer interested in fighting.

Hearing this, the Heavenly Tiger race’s experts were enraged. This fellow’s tone was so evil; he didn’t give them any face.

“We’ll see!”

The vice leader ultimately left with his people. While they left, Guo Ran and the others clapped enthusiastically for them and some even whistled. Unable to bear it anymore, one of the Heavenly Tiger race’s people coughed up blood from rage.

“Alright, we’re leaving too!” When Long Chen bade farewell to the Fullmoon race’s experts, the latter’s expressions immediately changed.

“You can’t! If you leave now, you might run into the Heavenly Tiger race’s people. Then…”

“That will depend on their luck.”

Long Chen smiled and left with his people.
