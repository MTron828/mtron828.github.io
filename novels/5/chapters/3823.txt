Chapter 3812 Heavenly Boundary Line

“What an idiot. I knew that he wouldn’t be able to hold himself back.”

The void rumbled. In the midst of the transportation, Xia Chen activated a second transportation, and they just managed to see the city’s formation exploding. Xia Chen then laughed.

“For such a foolish person to be able to cultivate to that realm, the heavens really are blind.” Mo Nian was speechless. This fellow wasn’t much smarter than his fool of a son.

“But he really is powerful. What realm has he reached?” wondered Xia Chen. The pressure that the city lord had given off was quite terrifying.

“Is he a legendary existence that transcends a Divine Venerate?” guessed a Dragonblood warrior.

Long Chen shook his head. “No, he should be a Divine Venerate. His fluctuations have not changed from that realm. But they are simply a hundred times stronger.”

Mo Nian nodded. “That’s true. Although I look down on him, if he were to go all-out, we wouldn’t be able to beat him. We’d have to flee. Fortunately, my fleeing abilities are unparalleled. I’m not afraid of anyone, no matter how powerful they are.”

In order to be safe, they underwent multiple transportations to quickly create distance from Silver Moon City’s domain. They then found a secluded place to rest for a bit. Just now, in order to block the city lord’s attack, Long Chen had directly used up thirty percent of his spiritual yuan. The city lord truly was a terrifying existence.

After resting a bit, they found another city and started moving to Clear Sky City.

Although the city lord was powerful, with so many of them together, they weren’t worried. They might not be a match for him fighting alone, but with Mo Nian and Yue Xiaoqian present, if the three of them joined forces, they would be able to stall him for some time. In that case, everyone would have time to get away.

Furthermore, the city lord might not dare to actually chase. If he were to press Long Chen, Long Chen might just sneak back into Silver Moon City and destroy his title of city lord. This was the so-called principle of people with nothing to lose not being afraid of those with something to lose.

A day later, they finally arrived in Clear Sky City. Seeing over a thousand Dragonblood warriors, all of them wept and cried out excitedly like a group of children.

That very day, Mo Nian held another feast to celebrate their reunion. Meeting again in the immortal world was truly difficult.

“Curious. Why aren’t boss Gu Yang, Song Mingyuan, Li Qi, and Yue Zifeng here?” After celebrating, Jiang Lei couldn’t help asking this question.

“I’ve asked around. The three thousand worlds are split into two regions. There is a so-called Heavenly Boundary Line separating the east and west. If you wish to cross, you must wait until the primal chaos qi eruption. Only then will the Heavenly Boundary Line vanish. At that time, the three thousand worlds will become one. Also, the Heavenly Boundary Line is like a barometer. Everyone is watching it. In truth, there are many monsters lying in the dark waiting for it to vanish and for the primal chaos qi to erupt. Those brothers are either not in the same region as us or are also waiting to accumulate power for the primal chaos qi eruption,” explained Mo Nian.

This explanation let everyone relax. They were also full of anticipation for the future.

They had gathered over a thousand Dragonblood warriors here, and they were all Supreme heavenly geniuses now. However, only half had World Domain divine items that matched them.Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

One reason was because there simply weren’t that many World Domain divine items, while another reason was that a weapon needed to match the user. To have a sword user swing around a hammer was simply not realistic.

Although Xia Chen and Guo Ran’s current circumstances did allow them to create World Domain divine items, they were only able to create the lowest level World Domain divine items. Their power couldn’t compare to the World Domain divine items that they had found.

Creating World Domain divine items required an extremely high level comprehension of the Heavenly Daos. In comparison, the forging skill was secondary. This lack of comprehension was Guo Ran’s weak point, and he was not capable of making any breakthroughs at the moment.

If it weren’t for his battle armor being a set with his saber, his saber wouldn’t be able to match the World Domain divine items of other experts.

Other than this, the other reason that Guo Ran and Xia Chen couldn’t quickly make some World Domain divine items for everyone was because they didn’t have the time. Thus, for now, the Dragonblood Legion could only be temporarily left half-unequipped.

Within Clear Sky City, they were one hundred percent safe. Long Chen then ordered the Dragonblood warriors to keep training where they were. They had to start practicing their formations again. At this moment, the Dragonblood Legion would be reformed.

As for Long Chen, Mo Nian, Yue Xiaoqian, Guo Ran, and Xia Chen, they stealthily left Clear Sky City and went westwards.

Three days later, they arrived in a desolate wilderness. There were giant ragged mountains, but not a single blade of grass grew on them. After that, an air of desolation blew by. With the slightest breeze, dust and sand blew into the air. The whistling wind was like a mad melody played by the world.

“Countless heroes, as well as immense history, are buried within the three thousand worlds. Who knows how many truths are buried here? This world is a mix of sewage. We cannot see the origin of this world and the lifeforms that inhabit it. Who muddied this world? What was their goal?” Dirt slipped through Long Chen’s fingers. He couldn’t help being emotional when he sensed the antiquity of this yellow soil.

Only after ascending did Long Chen find that the Martial Heaven Continent was just the starting point of some conspiracy. As his cultivation base grew, he saw more and more things. He sensed that he was getting ever closer to the truth. But the closer he got, the less he could see.

The three thousand worlds had an entire era buried within it. However, even here, they couldn’t see anything clearly. It was like invisible hands had separated them from the truth. It was like there was only a single piece of paper between them and the truth.

However, there was no way for them to pierce this paper. Despite clearly sensing the truth right there, despite smelling its scent, they couldn’t see it.

“As expected of a dean. Even your words are moving. However, don’t worry. The truth is right beneath our feet. I believe that as long as we start digging, we’ll find it. The truth can’t run away.” Mo Nian took out his shovel with a mischievous laugh.

He started digging and was very careful. He dug multiple holes and didn’t dig too deeply at once. Suddenly, some marks lit up on his shovel. He was actually measuring something.

Long Chen and the others didn’t comprehend this. They silently watched as Mo Nian dug more and more holes. After over ten holes, he finally stopped.

He took out a piece of paper and quickly drew a diagram. It was a lake with all kinds of lines within it. At the center was a single straight line that cut the lake in half.

“It’s a bit troublesome.” After eyeing the diagram for a long time, Mo Nian sighed solemnly.

“What is it?” asked everyone hastily.

“This heavenly tomb is perfectly cut by the Heavenly Boundary Line, which means the core is right on the Heavenly Boundary Line. However, we cannot touch the Heavenly Boundary Line. It is said to be a rope that came from a mysterious world. It will only vanish when the time comes. But before the time comes, touching it is equivalent to touching the laws of an entire world. Even someone on the level of Silver Moon City’s lord would definitely die,” said Mo Nian.

“So the core must be of utmost importance?” asked Long Chen.

Mo Nian nodded. Long Chen smiled. “Just because Silver Moon City’s lord wouldn’t dare to touch it doesn’t mean that us brothers wouldn’t dare to. Let’s go. Who cares about some heavenly tomb or Heavenly Boundary Line? We can decide after we take a look first.”

“Hahaha, I knew that I couldn’t scare you off. Let’s go! Even if it’s a pool of dragons or a den of tigers, we have to take a look!”

Mo Nian laughed and led them directly into the depths of this desolate land.
