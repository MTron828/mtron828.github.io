Chapter 3659

There was a thumb-sized hole in Enpuda’s chest, and scars stretched out of it like a spiderweb. It looked to be an old injury.

This wound pierced all the way through Enpuda’s body. Even though the outer area had healed, the core still had blood seeping out of it.

“Master, how were you injured?! Who did it?!” Ji Wuming was shocked.

“This happened forty-seven thousand years ago. I was stabbed by someone,” said Enpuda.

“Forty-seven thousand years ago? But…” Ji Wuming looked at the wound speechlessly.

Just who was capable of injuring an expert like Enpuda? And even if they could wound him, how were they capable of inflicting a wound that wouldn’t heal even after so long?

“Master, are you using this wound to warn me not to be arrogant? You want me to reserve myself? Disciple knows his mistake.” Ji Wuming once more apologized.

Enpuda shook his head. “No, this wound isn’t something that I kept intentionally. It is a wound that I am unable to heal. The energy of nightdark resides within it, and it is a kind of powerful curse. It won’t affect me during the day, but every time the dark night descends, the wound splits open. It has been affecting me for forty-seven thousand years. Otherwise, I would have long since advanced and killed that idiot Liao Bencang.”

Ji Wuming was completely shocked. What kind of power could resist even his master’s faith energy?

“Master, who did it?”

“Ye Wusheng. A name that shakes the heart of countless people in the nine heavens and ten lands, the assassin of the night. She has a nickname: Silence of the Night[1]. As soon as you mention the Silence of the Night, everyone from the senior generation quivers. Furthermore, Silence of the Night is an ancient desolate manifestation. Her nightdark energy is one of the most terrifying laws, and this wound she inflicted on me is something that even Divine Venerate Brahma is unable to heal. As long as Ye Wusheng doesn’t die, her curse will follow me forever. This is why I have only mobilized my avatars for so many years. My true body must remain here. I have been accumulating faith energy all these years in preparation of removing her curse. Other than killing her, this is the only way to break this curse,” said Enpuda.

Ji Wuming’s heart pounded wildly. He had not expected there to be someone so terrifying in this world. He finally understood what it meant for there always to be heavens beyond the heavens.

Enpuda straightened his clothes once more. He lightly said, “In that battle forty-seven thousand years ago, I almost fell to Ye Wusheng’s hands. If Divine Venerate Brahma didn’t come in time, there would no longer be an Enpuda in this world. Since I haven’t seen her in so many years, Ye Wusheng has probably advanced to the Divine Venerate realm. However, I have also profited from this injury. I had more time to focus on spreading my believers and gathering faith energy. While my realm stayed stuck at the peak of the World King realm, it caused my foundation to grow even steadier. By guarding against pride and impatience, my mental realm has also grown stronger. I have comprehended many of the principles that Divine Venerate Brahma expounded. Even though I am only a World King, an ordinary Divine Venerate will simply be slaughtered in front of me. Once I become a Divine Venerate, I will once more challenge Ye Wusheng. I will repay the humiliation that she gave me a hundredfold.”

A sinister smile appeared on Enpuda’s face. His hatred for Ye Wusheng had already sunk into his bones.

Enpuda continued, “I showed you this wound to tell you to put away your arrogance and inflated heart. As an assassin, those two things are the greatest taboos. They can take your life at any time. When I said that there were many people in the same realm that could fight you, I simply wanted you to know that you aren’t unrivaled. One of those rivals is Dong Mingyu, Ye Wusheng’s disciple. According to my current information, Dong Mingyu has awakened the nightdark manifestation, meaning that she is exceptionally talented, to the point that she is receiving Ye Wusheng’s true inheritance. Ye Wusheng is extremely prideful. Although she has accepted a few ordinary disciples, no one has ever been looked upon so favorably. But Dong Mingyu has been following Ye Wusheng all this time and has passed through countless trials. She also assassinated a half-step Divine Venerate a full month earlier than you.”

“What?!” Ji Wuming was shocked.

It had to be known that to assassinate that half-step Divine Venerate, he had pushed himself to his limit, and he still almost failed to kill his target. But then, Dong Minggyu had assassinated a half-step Divine Venerate a month earlier than him?

He knew that Dong Mingyu was even younger than him. Regretfully, even Enpuda could not obtain the full information on Dong Mingyu. If he were to learn that Dong Mingyu was also an ascender from the lower plane, he would be even more shocked.

“Wuming, remember, an assassin can never be arrogant. Otherwise, they will not be far from death. An assassin is a viper hiding in the dark. Who cares how powerful the target is? The only question is whether or not you can bite their vitals in one blow. If you can, then all their power is meaningless. They are ultimately only prey that falls to your hands. A calm heart, speedy reactions, accurate calculations, and a cool head, these are the most important things to an assassin. They might even be more important than your assassination arts,” said Enpuda.

“Disciple understands. Master, don’t worry, disciple won’t let you down.” Ji Wuming bowed. The current him had once more returned to his calm and reserved self.

Seeing him lacking the slightest impatience or arrogance, Enpuda smiled and nodded. He was very satisfied with this disciple of his.

“Has your little brother’s death caused any reaction from your family?” asked Enpuda.

“Master is wise. You had me let him think that he was unrivaled. Even when he strutted around me, I didn’t let him affect me, making him look down on me. After learning a few superficial techniques, he called himself the Bloodkill Hall’s number one expert. Also, after buying a few disciples and having them support him, he swaggered around the world. I even mentioned it to my father several times, but they ignored my warnings. Now that he’s dead, they can’t blame me. I can simply say that Ji Wuying sent me the seed of his Supreme Bone before his death to avenge him. As for master’s actions, they are untraceable. Furthermore, even if they suspect anything, it’s meaningless. I now have two Supreme Bones, so who can do anything to me? With your support, none of them dare to do anything to me. Based on the information my trusted aide in the family transmitted to me, the Ji family is currently sending experts to the Heavenly Talisman Star-Field to chase after Long Chen’s group,” said Ji Wuming with a smile.

Enpuda nodded. “Everything is going as predicted. After your brother’s death, your father will definitely be suspicious, but he can’t do anything. The Ji family will be yours, and my Bloodkill Hall will also be yours. As long as he isn’t a fool, he can only accept it. As for revenge, don’t force it. Just put on an act. Long Chen has a close relationship with the Wine God Palace, and they are not a good existence to provoke. Rather than alerting him of your existence, it would be better to patiently wait for your chance.”

“Alright. Then I’m going to talk to my father,” said Ji Wuming. Seeing that Enpuda had no further instructions, he bowed to him, and his figure slowly faded away.

Once Ji Wuming left, Enpuda touched the wound on his chest. An expression of rancor then appeared on his face.

“Ye Wusheng, just wait. Once my disciple kills your disciple, I will personally cut off your head.”
