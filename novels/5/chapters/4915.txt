Chapter 4904: Falling for a Trap

“What is it doing?!”

Long Chen felt like he would go crazy from rage. He had laid down his own dignity to self-mutilate himself, but the Sword Tooth Blood Ginger actually fled when he was still miles away.

If it weren’t for the Nirvanic Charge Pill, Long Chen wouldn’t have done such a thing to himself. But even after this, it had still fled.

Was this thing really something on the level of a Heaven Saint? Even after Long Chen sealed ninety percent of his power and looked like he was on the verge of death from his injuries, it still ran away?

Long Chen finally understood why the Sword Tooth Blood Ginger was so hard to obtain; it was far too elusive. As it had dove underground, the violet crystal heavenly eye was unable to find it, so everything Long Chen had done was for nothing.

“How useless.” The Earth Cauldron also spoke angrily, but realizing that it had misspoken, it hastily explained, “I was talking about it, not you.”

Long Chen didn’t know whether to laugh or cry. Did the Earth Cauldron even need to explain this? He hadn’t misunderstood it from the start, but now that it tried to explain itself to him, Long Chen started overthinking.

Clearly, even the Earth Cauldron hadn’t thought that the Sword Tooth Blood Ginger would be so cowardly. According to reason, the Long Chen should pose no threat to it at all.

“Ugh, since I am going to act, I have to go all out,” remarked Long Chen as he gritted his teeth.

“What do you mean?” asked the Earth Cauldron.

“Maybe there’s something on my body that raises its alarm, but I don’t have time to think about it. I can only keep going!” replied Long Chen as he was unwilling to give up just like this.

Long Chen started tottering, and after a while, he collapsed on the ground, pretending to pass out. His aura grew weaker and weaker as if he might die at any moment.

One hour, two hours, three hours… half a day had passed without anything happening.

“Senior, is what you said really true? Is the Sword Tooth Blood Ginger truly a bloodthirsty tree demon?” Long Chen’s confidence was starting to flag. He had used himself as bait, yet it seemed to be ignoring him completely. Was he not enticing enough?

The Earth Cauldron replied, “The Sword Tooth Blood Ginger is truly a ferocious kind of tree demon, but it is also gutless and crafty. Once it decides on a prey, it will spend decades or even centuries setting up a trap for it. When it finally attacks, it launches a sure-kill strike. Once it captures its prey, it will go into hiding to slowly digest it. As the master of the hunt, it is extremely wary and patient. I feel like you don’t have much hope if you just wait here for it to make a move. After all, the Sword Tooth Blood Ginger normally hunts actively. Furthermore, the moment it senses that you are dangerous, it will avoid you forever.”𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

“How irritating. I don’t have enough time,” sighed Long Chen. He helplessly “woke up” from his pathetic state and took out one medicinal pill after another. A powerful fragrance instantly spread through the air.

Long Chen didn’t consume them directly. Instead, he crushed them into a paste and applied them to his wounds. These pills were of an extremely high quality, healing Long Chen’s wounds rapidly. However, he didn’t let them heal too fast. As he crushed the pills, the medicinal fragrance grew stronger and stronger. Even as some of the paste landed on the ground, he ignored them.

As he peacefully recovered, the Earth Cauldron suddenly said, “It’s back!”

Long Chen also sensed it and immediately shot up, causing the Earth Cauldron to curse, “Fool, you’re going to scare it away!”

As expected, the moment Long Chen stood up, the surroundings became deathly silent. That subtle fluctuation also vanished instantaneously.

Long Chen looked around in alarm and sat back down, looking relieved. He then continued applying the medicine.

“Ah, I see…”

The Earth Cauldron instantly understood Long Chen’s intentions. The Sword Tooth Blood Ginger was even more sly than it had imagined; it knew how to test Long Chen. Just now, it had intentionally released the slightest fluctuation. If Long Chen had acted indifferently, it would be evidence that it was a trap for the Sword Tooth Blood Ginger.

However, since Long Chen had reacted to it, the Sword Tooth Blood Ginger was now assured that there was no trap. The Earth Cauldron hadn’t expected it to have reached such a high level of intelligence. It was truly treacherous.

Even so, once it left, it didn’t come back. After applying the medicine, Long Chen consumed another pill and then entered a meditative state. Divine light flowed around him as he rapidly recovered.

The moment he entered a meditative state, the ground beneath him exploded, revealing nine leaves that covered the sky. Their sharp teeth surrounded Long Chen.

Long Chen was “shocked” and hastily punched the leaves. There were only muffled sounds as if his punches landed on cotton. He was unable to release his power effectively.

The next moment, Long Chen was sucked underground. As he struggled, he found that these strange leaves had bizarre runes on them that were constantly countering his attacks, blocking ninety percent of his power.

If it’s so strong, why is it so gutless?! Long Chen cursed inside as he struggled against the Sword Tooth Blood Ginger.

BOOM!

Suddenly, a crack appeared between two leaves, and without hesitation, Long Chen charged through. As a result, two more leaves appeared, their sawtooth edges layering on top of each other like two sets of sharp teeth. The space before him darkened once again.

Within that darkness, Long Chen was struck by some kind of whip and spat out blood. He didn’t even know where that whip came from.

“Senior, release your seal! I’m going to be beaten!” cried out Long Chen. Even as he spoke, he was struck three more times by the whip.

Most terrifying of all, within this dark space, Long Chen’s senses were suppressed, causing him to not be able to discern which direction was up or down, let alone sense where the danger was coming from. With ninety percent of his power sealed, he stood no chance against the Sword Tooth Blood Ginger.

“Now still isn’t the time. It’s still testing you. Endure a bit longer,” responded the Earth Cauldron.

Within the darkness, one vine-like whip after another struck Long Chen. He was barely able to hold on.

Suddenly, a terrifying suction force appeared, and the surrounding space collapsed. Just then, runes flashed on Long Chen’s body, illuminating this dark space. Finally, Long Chen saw a mouth filled with sharp teeth in front of him.

“Die!” Long Chen roared. Evilmoon appeared in his hand, and he swung it down with all his power.

“Split the Heavens—Six Forms in One!”
