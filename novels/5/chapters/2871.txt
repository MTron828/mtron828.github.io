Chapter 2860 The Early Bird Gets the Worm

It was a bowl of soy milk. Hence, Li Cai was moved and looked around.

“Don’t get so emotional. Someone won’t treat you so well just because you carried them once,” said Long Chen.

“Then who was it?” asked Li Cai.

“It was me,” said Long Chen.

“Boss San, you treat me so well?” Li Cai was even more moved.

“Tch, you were grinding your teeth so loudly at night that I had to stuff some beans in your mouth to keep you quiet. You made the milk yourself, so you can drink it,” said Long Chen irritably.

They had been too exhausted to even hear such a thing at night. They probably wouldn’t have woken up even if thunder boomed right above their heads. At this moment, Li Cai’s embarrassed expression made them laugh.

“I was wondering why my mouth felt fishy,” mumbled Li Cai.

After a night’s sleep, everyone was refreshed. They then walked down the flying boat. Looking through the forest, they felt like the colors were more vibrant than yesterday.

“Does the world feel different?” asked a disciple. They were unable to tell exactly what was different.

Long Chen said, “It is because of the improvement in your mental strength. The constant threat of death stimulated your mind. At the same time as you look at the world, your mind automatically activates, giving birth to mental energy. This mental energy will then sharpen your sense of danger. Although it’s still very weak, it might be able to save your life at a critical moment.”

This explanation delighted everyone. They had made such an improvement in just a single day. If they continued like this for a month, wouldn’t they only grow even more powerful? Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

“Don’t get carried away. Boss San told us that this kind of benefit is only for novices. Because you haven’t experienced anything like this before, it has the best effect the first time you experience it. The effect won’t be as obvious the second time and onward. Well, boss San won’t be using the same method for you once it loses effect. Things will only get harder, but you’ll also make more gains. If you want to get stronger, grit your teeth and persevere,” reminded Li Cai.

Back then, Li Cai and the others had also gone through this and knew what these disciples were thinking. It went without saying that Li Cai was a very successful teacher’s aide. He knew what to say at the right time.

After breaking down their unrealistic ideas, he also gave them hope, making them realize that the path in front of them was even harder but also filled with unimaginable benefits. They had already gained so much just by following Long Chen for a day. That was an addicting feeling.

After walking out of the flying boat, they saw that there was a giant canyon in front of them. The forest ended here, and not a single blade of grass grew within the canyon. It was all black stone with a faint scorching heat coming from within. It looked strange and desolate.

“We’ll continue in the same formation as yesterday. Let’s go,” said Long Chen, leading the way into the valley.

Compared to how on edge they were yesterday, the entire group was clearly better off today. Seeing that her group had improved so much in just one day, Mu Qingyun’s eyes shone with excitement.

“You’re the leader. A leader must maintain an air of mystery. If your emotions are written all over your face, you won’t have a leader’s style,” said Long Chen with a smile upon seeing the beaming Mu Qingyun.

After yesterday’s talk, Long Chen felt a bit closer to Mu Qingyun. However, it was different from the feelings between a man and woman. Mu Qingyun seemed to truly view him as a big brother, so Long Chen no longer needed to be so careful around her.

“With brother San present, I don’t need that,” laughed Mu Qingyun.

Long Chen nodded. “Alright, it’s time to increase your power. Here, take this medicine.”

Long Chen tossed Mu Qingyun a little bottle. Mu Qingyun then asked, “What is this?”

But even as she asked, she was already drinking the medicinal liquid inside.

“It’s bitter!”

Mu Qingyun shivered with the taste. It felt like it was stuck in her throat.

“Good medicine tastes bitter. This medicine was specifically made by me for you, but its effect is rather slow. You’ll feel it later.”

Long Chen continued leading the way. Only once they were deeper did everyone find that this valley was absolutely gigantic. They couldn’t see the end. All they could see were stones that had been scorched black and emitted a metallic shine.

“It’s getting hotter…”

As they advanced, people started to feel like they were being broiled. They began to sweat.

They touched the rocks but were surprised to find that the rocks were actually cool. They didn’t know where this heat was coming from.

“This is the will left behind by the Heavenly Flame. It directly roasts the person’s soul. The heat you feel isn’t real heat but a misperception. Eighteen thousand years ago, a powerful Heavenly Flame seed was born here. It already had its own spirit and began to transform. Its power was unimaginable. After that, a terrifying beast wanted to devour it, so the two fought. This place is the edge of their battlefield. Once we reach the core, your souls will feel like they are being baked. You might see illusions or even heart-devils. Remember to protect your heart and not be disturbed,” warned Long Chen.

As expected, after another hour, some disciples turned pale. Their eyes became scarlet.

Long Chen gave them some medicinal liquid to alleviate their symptoms a bit and then continued onward.

“Brother San, I…” Mu Qingyun suddenly spoke up, her voice quivering.

“Don’t get emotional. Continue feeling it.”

Mu Qingyun was finally sensing fluctuations from her sword. Just as Long Chen had anticipated, there were flame runes carved into Mu Qingyun’s sword. It was a fire attribute sword. In this place, where a Heavenly Flame seed had been born, the sword sensed the flame energy and its fluctuations became clearer.

As for the medicinal liquid that he had given her before, it was to temporarily boost her mental strength. Hence, for her to finally sense the fluctuations of her sword was natural.

Eventually, some disciples could no longer endure. They began to talk nonsense, and there were even signs of them going insane.

Long Chen had everyone pause here, and those disciples gradually calmed down. After two hours of rest and letting everyone get used to this place, they pressed onward.

They repeatedly stopped on the way before finally arriving at the core of the valley.

There was a giant cave opening in front of them. Long Chen then walked over and suddenly squatted down, his expression changing slightly.

“Someone else arrived before us?”
