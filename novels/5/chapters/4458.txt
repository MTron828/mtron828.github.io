Chapter 4447 Evenly Matched?

As the black hole shrank, its suction range contracted, yet its suction force only intensified.

It could be likened to a river dam. When it was fully opened, a mighty crash of waves followed. However, with a smaller opening, the water pressure became even more concentrated.

Moreover, the higher concentration of spatial blades added to the peril. At first, only sporadic spatial blades appeared across several dozen miles, but now, within a mile radius, thousands manifested. Each blade possessed the sharpness of an Eternal divine weapon, leaving Long Chen and Netherdragon Tianzhao covered in cuts. If they were to be struck in the head, they could very possibly die.

Despite that, the two of them continued their bloody battle without holding back in the slightest. Their attacks were still as sharp as ever.

“Are they planning on dying together?!” cried out one of the Jiang clan’s budding Doyens.

“Why can’t they continue their fight outside?! If this continues, they’ll both die!” added the other budding Doyen.

The two of them then looked at Jiang Wenyu, hoping for him to answer. However, Jiang Wenyu didn’t reply and just looked at Feng Fei.

At this point, Feng Fei couldn’t be bothered to argue with them. She said, “This is the difference between them and you. They are true experts.”

Immediately, the expressions of the two guys twitch. This was just like cursing them.

They were about to argue, but they were directly silenced by a glare from Jiang Wenyu. After that, he looked at Feng Fei and patiently waited for her to keep speaking. Now, even the Jiang clan’s Eternal experts were listening to her.

In fact, even other experts around them were paying attention to her as they watched the fight.

Many people had heard that Feng Fei was an ascender from the same world as Long Chen. Thus, she knew him best.

“Long Chen and Netherdragon Tianzhao are both very prideful individuals, having ascended to their current heights through trials of fire and blood. Their competition goes beyond mere power—it extends to their wills, pride, and courage. As they were both unrivaled existences in the same realm, they have absolute confidence in themselves. Neither is willing to believe that there might be someone within the same realm who can best them. So, they willingly plunged into this perilous situation because the first to succumb to fear and retreat would be deemed the loser in this battle,” explained Feng Fei.

“But isn’t that foolish? If you were stronger than someone but still let yourself be caught in a black hole, how did that count as a victory? Why is finding a more suitable place to fight a loss? What kind of logic is that?” demanded one of the Jiang clan’s budding Doyens.

Feng Fei glared at him. “Can a frog at the bottom of a well speak of the ocean? Can a summer bug speak of the cold? Can a small fry understand the will of a noble?”

“You…!”

“Do you know what the true Dao of cultivation is?” asked Feng Fei.

“What?” This person was startled by the sudden question.

“Do not argue with someone stupid about right and wrong.”

That budding Doyen immediately retorted, “I don’t think you are right.”

“Then you are right,” said Feng Fei.

Seeing Feng Fei suddenly admit that he was right, he was startled. He hadn’t expected her to admit defeat so quickly.

However, as he noticed people casting odd glances his way, he quickly realized that she was implying he was foolish, provoking his anger.

After saying that, Feng Fei ignored him. There was no way for her to communicate with someone so stupid.

Fortunately, there were only a few idiots like this in the Jiang clan’s junior generation, or the Jiang clan would be doomed.

While he didn’t even understand what Feng Fei was saying after she had explained it so clearly, the surrounding experts mostly understood.

Clearly, Long Chen and Netherdragon Tianzhao were both prideful individuals, and their pride refused to let them lower their heads.

In their minds, this black hole was a fair martial stage, and whoever left it would lose.

This logic might be incomprehensible to that budding Doyen. After all, his pride was simply hot air, while Long Chen and Netherdragon Tianzhao’s pride had been carved into their bones.

Someone with only hot air would bend after a single beating. However, those with pride carved into their bones would rather have their bones shattered to pieces than bend.

This was why Feng Fei described him as a frog at the bottom of a well. Just because he was a budding Doyen didn’t mean that he was a true expert. He was actually 108,000 miles away from the level of true experts.

The intense battle inside the black hole continued, but the black hole was rapidly shrinking—ten miles, nine miles, eight miles…

The smaller it grew, the more intense their battle became. Their blood flew everywhere, and there were countless spatial blades around them. However, that still didn’t stop the two of them.

This scene gave people chills. It was their first time seeing such a ruthless battle.

After a while, the black hole was only a few meters wide, and everyone’s heart clenched.

They still aren’t coming out? If they stayed there any longer, would they ever come up again?

It was so nerve-wracking that they could only hear their own heartbeats.

This scene further proved Feng Fei’s words. The two of them were unwilling to step out of the black hole, as neither of them was willing to admit defeat.

Finally, the black hole fully vanished, and silence descended into the world.

“It’s over. They died!”

Buzz.

Just as everyone thought that both of them had been devoured and would be lost from this world for eternity, the void suddenly shattered like a mirror, revealing two figures in front of them.

Covered in more blood than ever, the two of them bore numerous additional cuts, resembling individuals who had just gone through a meat grinder.

Yu Qingxuan covered her mouth, unable to hold back tears. Seeing Long Chen in this state, she felt like her heart was being stabbed.

Bai Shishi was slightly pale, and she clenched her fists, her nails digging into her palm. Blood oozed out of her hands, but she didn’t even notice it.

In truth, even the Dragonblood warriors had been nervous just now. If Long Chen had been sucked into that black hole, perhaps he would have never come back.

Long Chen and Netherdragon Tianzhao stood resolute. Streams of black and golden blood slowly trickled down their bodies. However, before the blood could touch the ground, it transformed into mist and was drawn back into them.

“Monstrous. They are absolute monsters!”Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

A budding Doyen’s shuddering voice broke the silence. Now, he knew the difference between them.

The two of them had fought to a bloody mess and were still capable of shattering the void and escaping from it.

“Is this the strongest power of the junior generation? It’s enough to make me give up!” said another budding Doyen.

As for the two engaged in battle, they gazed at each other with stoic expressions. The space between them seemed to solidify because of the tension.

“In terms of dragon blood power, we are evenly matched. But you will still lose,” exclaimed Netherdragon Tianzhao.

“Is that so?” asked Long Chen lightly.

“Just now, I was only using my dragon blood energy. But now…”

Suddenly, the void rumbled, and an enormous vortex appeared throughout the world. The heart of this vortex was pointed right at Netherdragon Tianzhao.

“Now the real fight starts!” Netherdragon Tianzhao shouted. A shocking scene then played out.
