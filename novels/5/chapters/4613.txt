Chapter 4602 Life End Pill

BOOM!

A mountain shattered, sending dust and stones swirling through the air as a colossal beast collapsed

Tens of thousands of Three Eye experts cheered, celebrating their collective effort in slaying the formidable creature. It had been extremely ferocious, and they had lost quite a few people to take it down.

However, just as they were going to enter its nest and take the precious medicine inside, they saw a black-robed man walk out. Their fury exploded as they saw that the medicine inside was gone.

“You little thief, hand over your life!”

Witnessing their hard-earned harvest snatched away by another, the Three Eye experts blazed with fury.

“Tch, is this stealing? Don’t you think it’s more like snatching?” said Long Chen disdainfully.

“Kill him!”

A seven-star Doyen was the first to charge at Long Chen, but with a swift slap to the face, Long Chen sent him hurtling through the air, crashing into the ground and leaving a sizable crater. The experts behind him were caught off guard and were also sent flying by the force of the impact.

Before the other top experts could even reach Long Chen, he dispatched them with a powerful kick, sending them tumbling through the air. The Three Eye experts stood stunned, not expecting Long Chen to be so powerful.

Even though Long Chen had switched out his blood, he shouldn’t be able to beat up seven-star Doyens like beating children. However, these Doyens simply didn’t have the actual power that their Doyen status should have. Though they possessed the aura of a seven-star Doyen, they fell short in actual strength.

When they attacked, their power was even a bit weaker than some six-star Doyens. Such strength posed no threat to Long Chen.

“How dare you steal from us?! If our master learns of this, he will definitely extract your soul and subject you to eternal torture!” shouted one of them.

“Master? Who is your master?” asked Long Chen directly. In truth, this was the only reason he didn’t directly kill them.

“Do you think you’re fit to hear our master’s name?! Die!”

One of the seven-star Doyens suddenly took out a medicinal pill. Upon seeing it, Long Chen’s eyes widened in recognition.

“A Life End Pill? Is that real?” Long Chen exclaimed in disbelief.

Before he could process the situation, the individual swiftly consumed the pill, crushing it with his teeth.

“Master, thank you for your pity and mercy. You let me defy the heavens and change my fate. From the ranks of mediocrity, you allow me to rise to the ranks of experts. Today, I will sacrifice everything to repay your benevolence. Almighty master, your servant is about to enter the cycle of reincarnation. Please hear my call and let me reincarnate as your most loyal servant in my next life...”

Long Chen stared in disbelief as this expert prayed devoutly. After that, flames appeared all over him as he ignited his essence, qi, and spirit.

“Is he crazy?” asked Long Chen with disbelief. This person didn’t hesitate to consume a Life End Pill.

It was a violent poison pill capable of letting a person unleash dozens of times their strength—an extremely heaven-defying pill.

However, it was no ordinary poison; it was said that those who consumed it were defying the natural order to gain power, an act frowned upon by the heavens.

Therefore, anyone who consumed it would not enter the cycle of reincarnation. The Heavenly Daos would not permit their existence, and so they would be eradicated.

Even Long Chen had never refined this kind of pill. This was a taboo, one that even the great Pill Sovereign did not touch.

However, this person did not hesitate to consume it. Furthermore, he spoke of his next life, so he clearly didn’t know what this pill signified.

BOOM!

As the person’s aura surged and he ignited in flames, he charged at Long Chen, his hands slashing through the air like claws.

In a single devastating strike, he condensed all his power into this attack, his ferocious aura distorting the space around him.

However, just as he thought that this attack would kill Long Chen, a hand covered in scales slammed forward, reducing the claw and him to a mist of blood.

“Powered-up weaklings are still weaklings. Even if you get a hundred times stronger, what can you possibly achieve?” Long Chen’s voice dripped with cold disdain.

They were fundamentally not experts. They relied solely on medicinal pills to elevate their realm, akin to paper tigers. With just a touch, they crumbled.

Paper tigers, regardless of their strength, remained paper at the core. Their thickness did not change, rendering their newfound power futile. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

Despite witnessing the swift demise of their comrade at Long Chen's hands, the remaining Three Eye experts displayed no fear. With defiant roars, they charged forward once more.

It seemed that not all of them possessed Life End Pills. Despite knowing that they were sending themselves to their deaths, they continued to charge at Long Chen like madmen.

In response, Long Chen showed no mercy. He killed their strongest experts with his palm, and none of them could stop him.

It seemed that these people didn’t even understand what death was. Even as their comrades fell, they didn’t react and continued to charge. The crazy light in their eyes was rather frightening.

Long Chen’s gaze remained apathetic. These lifeforms were no more than killing machines, so he naturally wouldn’t bestow them any of his pity or sympathy.

However, he was in no rush to kill them all. He killed them one by one as they charged at him. When he had killed over thirty of their top experts, he finally sensed something.

Buzz.

One of those Three Eye experts had their third eye open. After that, his manifestation burst open, revealing a white-robed figure.

When this white-robed figure appeared, the temperature of the world soared, setting the air ablaze. The world was twisting from this heat, and everything became like a mirage.

“Master!”

Seeing the figure, all the Three Eye experts instantly calmed down. They stopped attacking Long Chen and kowtowed toward that white-robed figure.

“You’re finally showing yourself!”

Long Chen gazed at that figure indifferently as he had expected this.

“You’re very brazen.”

The white-robed figure spoke with a man's voice, devoid of any hint of age but dripping with arrogance.

“A little, but I can’t compare to you. As an alchemist, you actually used medicinal pills to brainwash people. Are you not afraid of karmic retribution?” Long Chen’s voice was cold and laced with accusation.

“Hahaha!” The white-robed man laughed derisively. “Karmic retribution? What a foolish question. The fact that you even mention it shows that we are simply not on the same level. You may as well meet your end here!”

With a flourish of hand seals, the world ignited in flames, and a sacred chanting filled the air. At the sound of that chanting, Long Chen’s killing intent solidified.
