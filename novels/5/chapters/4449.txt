Chapter 4438 Are You a Mixed Breed?

“You will pay the price of your insolence!”

Netherdragon Tianzhao’s voice echoed throughout heaven and earth, as if the very world was transmitting his will.

His voice didn’t just echo throughout heaven and earth; it also reverberated within everyone’s minds. They were powerless to resist it.

Netherdragon Tianzhao’s wrathful will was transmitted through the Heavenly Daos. This demonstrated the terrifying aspect of a Heavenly Doyen.

The Heavenly Daos were just a tool for him and could be controlled effortlessly by him. In his presence, the heavens had to bow to him.

Before this, he had only used the might of the nether dragon race, intending to crush Long Chen with his dragon power. However, Long Chen’s skill at infuriating people was simply unmatched. Each of his words accurately struck the nether dragon race in their weak spots. Overwhelmed by anger, Netherdragon Tianzhao couldn’t hold back anymore and used his Doyen power.

Although this roar of his didn’t injure anyone, it was immensely shocking, showing the true terrifying side of a Heavenly Doyen.

At this moment, his black dragon blood domain rapidly expanded, pressing down on Long Chen’s golden domain.

Netherdragon Tianzhao’s black domain was now over ten times larger than Long Chen’s, completely surrounding and compressing it. Under this pressure, Long Chen’s domain started to deform, looking as if it would explode at any moment. However, no matter how it was pressed, it didn’t explode.

Netherdragon Tianzhao was well aware that Long Chen still had hidden cards to play. Even if he crushed Long Chen’s golden domain, it wouldn’t be enough to kill Long Chen.

However, shattering Long Chen’s golden domain would symbolize that the nether dragon was superior to the true dragon. After all, this battle wasn’t just a competition between the two of them but also a showdown between the nether dragon race and the true dragon race.

On the Dragonblood Legion’s side, Bai Shishi, Yu Qingxuan, Bai Xiaole, and the others were clenching their fists, their palms covered in sweat.

Little Crane was still hiding in her aunt’s embrace, covering her eyes. She didn’t dare to watch, but she would occasionally peek through the cracks between her fingers.

On the other hand, Guo Ran, Xia Chen, and the rest of the Dragonblood Legion weren’t worried at all. Their confidence in Long Chen was off the chart. Having followed Long Chen for so many years, they believed that no matter what kind of monster he encountered, as long as they were in the same realm, Long Chen would not lose.

In their hearts, this was an iron rule, so they were calmer than everyone else.

Long Chen’s golden dragon blood domain was deforming and making creaking sounds as if it would explode with just the slightest bit of pressure. However, it never happened.

Now, Long Chen no longer provoked Netherdragon Tianzhao. He wasn’t in the mood to. Instead, he focused on the dragon blood runes within his dragon tendons, which were undergoing a transformation.

The egg-like cores were growing, resembling tiny curled-up tadpoles at first, making their shape difficult to tell. However, as Netherdragon Tianzhao's power stimulated them, they seemed to incubate, and their curled-up forms gradually spread out.

After stretching out, they still didn’t look like dragons but more like earthworms. However, they suddenly tightened as they were forced to compress.

This compression triggered a vast and explosive power to erupt from them, sending dragon blood energy throughout every inch of Long Chen's body. It felt like he was struck by lightning, and his dragon blood energy entered a completely new state.

It was a qualitative uplift, and Long Chen was delighted by this unexpected discovery. When stimulated by danger, the Dragon Blood Body Forging Art would automatically draw out its potential and improve.

At first, using dragon blood energy to fight Netherdragon Tianzhao was a stretch for Long Chen. After all, he wasn’t part of the dragon race, lacking their massive bodies to store up so much energy. This was a significant drawback compared to the pure-blooded Netherdragon Tianzhao. Long Chen realized that using this weakness to fight against his enemy’s strength was very foolish.

However, who asked him to inherit the mysterious dragon expert’s legacy? Since he had taken up its inheritance, he had to clean up any traitors for it. As a result, Long Chen had to use the dragon expert’s technique to fight Netherdragon Tianzhao. Even if Long Chen lost this way, he still had to do it.

Otherwise, the mysterious and prideful dragon expert would be greatly disappointed. With this in mind, Long Chen simply gritted his teeth and pressed forward with this foolish fighting style.

Of course, he hadn’t expected his dragon blood runes to advance. Realizing this, Long Chen hastily calmed himself and shouted, “Hey, you’re quite arrogant for someone so weak. I already told you that a loud throat doesn’t matter or donkeys would rule the world. Is this your so-called nether dragon divine abilities? The pride of the nether dragon race? Could it be that this is really all your power? How foolish.”

Countless jaws dropped. They had thought that Long Chen was pressed to the point of not being able to speak. Unexpectedly, he remained relaxed enough to insult his opponent.

“I’m only defending against your domain, not even attacking. Yet, you still can’t do anything? It seems that the nether dragon race really is nothing in front of the true dragon race. I’m just a human and only have the slightest trace of true dragon blood. But you, a pureblooded nether dragon…”

Suddenly, a bewildered expression appeared on Long Chen’s face. He shifted his gaze to the nether dragon race leader in the distance and then back at Netherdragon Tianzhao. His mouth moved a few times, and he gasped in shock.

“Could it be that you’re not pureblooded and are a mixed breed?”

Countless people almost coughed up blood. In this tense atmosphere, Long Chen suddenly said such a thing?

Numerous glances turned toward the nether dragon race leader, whose expression was as dark as the bottom of a pot. His teeth were clenched so hard that they were about to shatter.

If this were not a duel between two youngsters, the dragon race leader would have joined in and crushed this bastard. Long Chen’s sharp tongue and toxic remarks were unparalleled. Even in all his years, the dragon race leader had never encountered such a venomous person.

“You insolent wretch, you’ve crossed the line!” Netherdragon Tianzhao roared, his rage causing his hair to stand on end. His contorted face seemed on the verge of spewing flames as he forcefully slammed his hands together.

BOOM!

His domain exploded, transforming into a black halo that expanded in all directions, nearly enveloping the spectators. They then fled in terror.

Netherdragon Tianzhao’s domain had surged to an astonishing scale, leaving the onlookers stunned.

Once the domain reached its limit, Netherdragon Tianzhao’s hand seals changed, causing the giant domain to shrink rapidly. A berserk power then radiated, crushing everything in its path.Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com
