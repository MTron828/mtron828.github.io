Chapter 4054 Enemies on a Narrow Road

“The heavens really do look after my Soaring Dragon Company. Could it be that this was all foreordained? Long Chen, you destroyed so many of my branches, but today, you’ve brought me the Earth Cauldron. Excellent. Hand over the Earth Cauldron, and I’ll let you live.”

At this moment, an elder with white hair and a beard blocked their path. In the wake of his arrival, heaven and earth rumbled, and a powerful pressure descended upon the scene. His voice was so powerful that it left people in a state of daze.

“A Heaven Venerate!”

They were so unlucky. The random spot that they chose actually had a Heaven Venerate standing guard over it.

This elder’s pressure alone was incredibly powerful, countless times stronger than an Earth Venerate. Now, they could see that the difference between an Earth Venerate and a Heaven Venerate was very great.

They were fearless toward Earth Venerates, but against Heaven Venerates, they were like ants.ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

To make it even worse, other than this white-haired elder, over twenty three-flower Earth Venerates were surrounding Long Chen and the others as well, leaving them with no chance to escape.

“Don’t resist!” shouted one of them.

“Of course, my bad luck never fails me. Just my luck to stumble upon the Soaring Dragon Company again,” muttered Long Chen, a wry smile crossing his face as he looked at the experts of the Soaring Dragon Company. He then slammed his hands together and summoned a flash of golden light.

“Dragon King Battle Armor!”

Amidst a resounding dragon cry, the sacred might of a dragon surged forth, shattering the oppressive pressure wielded by a Heaven Venerate.

“Cloud Dragon Immolation Claw!”

Long Chen didn’t dare to hold back in the slightest against a Heaven Venerate, thus, he instantly started with his strongest trump cards. A dragon claw then reached out of his divine ring toward the Soaring Dragon Company’s Heaven Venerate.

“A dragonfly trying to shake a tree. It is laughable that you don’t know your own power. As a Heaven Venerate, heaven and earth are me, and I am heaven and earth. A little Immortal King like yourself thinks that you can defy the heavens?”

The Heaven Venerate simply sneered and formed hand seals. The next moment, the ten thousand Daos rumbled, and primal chaos qi flowed into a barrier in front of him.

BOOM!

Long Chen’s giant dragon claw smashed into the barrier, causing the void in millions of miles to crack like a mirror. It was like the entire world was shattered by this attack.

However, Long Chen’s expression changed. With this attack, he had figured out the secret of the Heaven Venerate realm. He also knew why Divine Venerates were split into Mortal, Earth, and Heaven Venerates.

A Mortal Venerate’s power came from themself, and an Earth Venerate borrowed the power of the ten thousand Daos. However, a Heaven Venerate was different. They were existences that had merged with heaven and earth. Thus, to fight a Heaven Venerate was akin to fighting heaven and earth.

Having merged the three flowers into one, there was no longer a distinction between them and the world. Therefore, a Heaven Venerate was the true master of any world that they went to. If Long Chen wanted to beat one, he had to have the power to destroy an entire world.

At this moment, Long Chen’s aura made the Heavenly Daos rumble, causing the cracks in the void to constantly heal and break. Those Earth Venerates were unable to even get close to him and were forced back, coughing up blood. They were shocked. The current Long Chen was even stronger than what the rumors said.

The Soaring Dragon Company’s Heaven Venerate was also shocked. “How powerful. But even so, how can you fight heaven and earth? Just hand over the Earth Cauldron. Seeing how talented you are, I can make an exception and accept you as-”

Just then, an arrow appeared right in front of him and pierced straight through his Heavenly Dao defense. Seeing it, he jumped in fright and hastily extended a hand.

BOOM!

The arrow exploded on his palm, causing the Heaven Venerate’s expression to change. This arrow might have broken through his barrier, but it didn’t possess any actual killing power.

In other words, even if he had allowed the arrow to reach his face, it wouldn’t harm him at all. His hasty block was just an instinct.

Just as he had a bad feeling, Long Chen’s dragon claw pressed down, and due to the distraction, his barrier shattered.

BOOM!

The sharp claw raked through his barrier and struck his body. When it reached him, divine light erupted from his body. The elder was blown into the distance, but he didn’t seem injured.

“When merged with heaven and earth, you can borrow the power of heaven and earth to attack and defend. To kill a Heaven Venerate, you must possess the ability to destroy the power of heaven and earth.” Long Chen’s heart shook. He had figured out the power of a Heaven Venerate. In order to kill one, you would need to be able to shatter heaven and earth. Otherwise, it was useless.

However, this Heaven Venerate still felt his blood flipping inside of him from being struck. Long Chen’s sacred energy had given him a great deal of pressure.

Thus, he felt shocked and enraged. It was said that all those beneath Heaven Venerates were ants and that the Heaven Venerate realm was a dividing line within the cultivation world. All those who could fight across realms ended up failing when it came to the Heaven Venerate realm.

No matter how strong the Earth Venerate was, they still wouldn’t be qualified to challenge a Heaven Venerate. However, a little Immortal King like Long Chen actually possessed such immense power. The elder was in disbelief.

Long Chen’s potential was too terrifying. If they allowed him to grow up, he might become a legendary existence.

“Heaven and Earth Displacement! Strip away the ten thousand laws! Condense the formation!”

Suddenly, thousands of talismans surrounded that Heaven Venerate. Following Xia Chen’s shout, the talismans ignited.

The Heaven Venerate’s expression completely changed as he found himself cut off from all of heaven and earth. He instantly realized that Xia Chen’s formation had temporarily cut him off from the world. With this, he wouldn’t be able to rely on the power of heaven and earth to fight.

“Dragonblood Cross Slash!”

In an instant, the power of all the Dragonblood warriors poured into Guo Ran. Guo Ran and Xia Chen’s combination was perfect. Just as the formation took effect, the Dragonblood Cross Slash fell.

The Heaven Venerate roared, “Ignorant brats, do you really think that a Heaven Venerate without the power of heaven and earth is like a fish outside of water?!”

As he formed hand seals, a strange flower appeared behind him, possessing only three colorful petals and lacking any stamens. When they spun, he unleashed a punch.

BOOM!

The Dragonblood Cross Slash exploded. The attack containing all the power of the Dragonblood warriors, an attack that could instantly slay an Earth Venerate, was unable to stop an attack from a Heaven Venerate.

“Divine Dragon Pendulum Tail!”

Just after the Heaven Venerate destroyed the Dragonblood Cross Slash, Long Chen’s leg whipped out, and a giant dragon tail whistled toward him.

“You-!”

The Heaven Venerate was enraged. Long Chen and the others’ attacks were combined perfectly, giving him no chance to breathe.

He had just used the power of his manifestation to shatter the Dragonblood Cross Slash when another powerful attack came from Long Chen. He now realized that everything beforehand had been preparation for this one attack.

Most infuriating of all, he had no way to stop it anymore.

BOOM!

The impact sent Grand Dao runes flying through the air. When the sound of bones breaking rang out, that Heaven Venerate hacked up blood and shot back like a shooting star.

Two unlucky fellows were struck by his body and blown apart. After all, Earth Venerates were simply unable to endure that terrifying power.

“Let’s go!”

Long Chen was a bit pale. To unleash two of his ultimate attacks in such a short time was extremely taxing to him. His body wasn’t quite able to endure it.

“You want to leave?! Leave behind the Earth Cauldron first!”

BOOM!

Suddenly, the void quivered, and a giant claw crashed down toward Long Chen and the others. Long Chen’s expression changed. So there had been another Heaven Venerate hidden in the surroundings.
