Chapter 4079 Ye Clan Heavenly Genius Ye Wuchen

Before them stood a young man in white robes, his back adorned with two crossed swords. His face, though handsome, exuded an icy demeanor brimming with arrogance. Upon his arrival, he didn’t even look at the experts in the surroundings who were whispering amongst themselves. It was like he looked down on everything within this world.

When he came down, the giant Shadow Qilin trailed in his wake, sending even the Heaven Venerates trembling with fear. None dared to approach him, held back by the overwhelming aura he exuded.

“He condensed three flowers in the Immortal King realm. He… he’s probably a supreme genius that can aim to become a Heaven Venerate within a hundred years…”

Ninety-nine percent of Heaven Venerates only managed to awaken their third necessary flower after becoming a Divine Venerate. After all, Double Supremes Divine Venerates could comprehend the workings of heaven and earth, using their own body to reflect the Dao and search for the power that worked with them within heaven and earth.

Using their Double Supremes as a foundation, they would draw in the third force in pursuit of the realm where three gave birth to all things.

It had to be said that Double Supremes who became Divine Venerates were already rare existences, but beyond that, those who could condense the third kind of power were far rarer. First, ignoring the difficulty, the time required to reach such a high level of comprehension was enough to cause countless people’s longevity to run out.

Even if a person could condense the third kind of power and summon the three flower manifestation, it required a huge amount of energy to merge the three flowers into one and become one with heaven and earth.

Thus, by the time they became Heaven Venerates, they already exhausted seventy to eighty percent of their essence energy, and it was essentially impossible to recover.

To put it another way, it was like a person who had used up all their energy to climb to the peak of a cliff, only to find that there was nowhere to stand upon reaching the peak. They could only hold on to the peak with all the energy that they had left in them in order to not fall.

Having reached the Heaven Venerate realm, they possessed the power to look down on all others. However, it was very difficult for them to maintain this height. In order to maintain this realm, they could only burn their longevity and wait for death.

Having worked so hard and so long to reach this point, even if they knew that they were quickening their deaths, they refused to give up. In other words, they were not afraid of death, but they were afraid of losing the glory of being Heaven Venerates.

A Double Supreme could condense three flowers, but their flowers would be called acquired three flowers. On the other hand, some geniuses naturally possessed all three kinds of energy, and upon reaching the Immortal King realm, the flowers were all awakened. They were called innate three flowers.

The difference between the two was immense. If an innate three flower expert managed to climb to the Heaven Venerate realm within a hundred years, they would receive the protection of heaven and earth. Then the Heaven Venerate realm would not be their ceiling, and they could pursue even greater heights.

In other words, there was no need for them to burn their longevity to maintain their realm. Furthermore, with the protection of the Heavenly Daos, when their manifestations were activated, they were backed by more than ten times the Heavenly Dao energy compared to that of the acquired three flowers.

Essentially, Triple Supreme Immortal Kings already had a path paved for them to the Immortal King realm. If they could become Heaven Venerates within a hundred years, they had a chance to reach the Eternal realm and possess longevity as long as heaven and earth, essentially becoming a legendary existence.

Thus, when this man appeared, he caused a huge disturbance. Countless people stared at him in shock and awe.

Very quickly, several elders of the Ye clan also arrived, and one of them had an incredibly swollen head. It was the Ninth Elder that Long Chen had slapped silly, and his swelling had yet to settle.

These were all Elders of the Ye clan, but they all came subserviently to the white-robed man’s side.

The young man looked over the battlefield and coldly said, “You idiots. The Ye clan’s face has been lost by you.” He pointed at the Ninth Elder. “After being beaten to this point, you still have the face to live? How could such cowardly trash appear in my Ye clan?”

The Ninth Elder didn’t dare to make a sound and just quivered. If this young man were to learn that this life of his was only preserved by begging, then he would definitely die.

However, for the white-robed young man to call the Ninth Elder a coward for wanting to live irritated all the Heaven Venerates. For them, just maintaining their realm was a constant strain on their longevity. They already wouldn’t have that much longer to live. Of course, they cherished whatever time they had.

Like a young man cursing someone with one foot in the grave, he didn’t even consider their point of view.

“Reporting, they had a terrifying expert of the Undying race with them. The three of us together were unable to beat him,” said the Ninth Elder.

The Ninth Elder didn’t even have a chance to report what had happened before the white-robed man came and immediately decided to settle things himself at the battlefield. However, things were already over by the time he arrived.

The reason why the Ninth Elder and the others managed to arrive right after him was to report what had happened to him.

“If you couldn’t beat them, why didn’t you reveal that you were from the Ye clan?” demanded the white-robed man.

“We told them, but those unreasonable people didn’t care. Also, that black-robed fellow seems to possess an extraordinary background, as the Heaven Venerate of the Undying race treated him subserviently, even calling him master,” said the Ninth Elder hastily.

He had no choice but to make it out as if Long Chen and Uncle Tree were incredibly powerful. That was the only way that his loss wouldn’t be viewed as too embarrassing.

“Hmph, so what? The Ye clan is not afraid of the Undying race!” declared the white-robed man.

“They also said… said…” The Ninth Elder gulped.

“What did they say?” demanded the white-robed man.

“He said to tell the Ye clan not to provoke him, that his temper is bad. He has given us two warnings and won’t be giving any more. If we provoke him again, then he, Boss Long San, will play with us to the end,” reported the Ninth Elder woodenly.

“Courting death!”

With a roar, three-colored divine radiance appeared behind him, piercing the void and causing countless cracks to appear. Heaven and earth almost crumbled because of his anger.

It was like a single thought from him could destroy heaven and earth. That terrifying divine might caused even Heaven Venerates to quiver.

It was because Heaven Venerates needed to summon their manifestations to unleash the power of heaven and earth. But this white-robed man was able to control heaven and earth's power at will.

“Hmph, who does he think he is to dare to act arrogant in front of my Ye clan? I, Ye Wuchen, will test him.” Ye Wuchen turned to the Ninth Elder. “Hand over your blood soul mark. I’ll chase them down.”

This so-called blood seal mark was the tracking seal that the Ninth Elder had placed on Long Chen and the others. It was only thanks to it that they had managed to pursue them to this place.

However, when it was mentioned, the Ninth Elder’s expression changed. “My blood soul mark has been forcibly erased.”

“Nonsense! A Heaven Venerate’s blood soul mark can’t be erased so easily, except by an Eternal expert!” shouted the startled and enraged white-robed man.VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

“But… it really has been erased!” cried out the Ninth Elder.

In truth, he was lying. When Long Chen let him go, he took the initiative to take back his blood soul mark. It was to show his sincerity, as well as because he was afraid that Long Chen would kill him if he didn’t.

Now that it was brought up, he didn’t dare to say that he had taken it back himself, so he could only place the blame on Long Chen and the others.

This inadvertently caused the white-robed man’s expression to change. This lie made him think that Long Chen and the others were actually incredibly powerful.

“Hmph, you idiots. I’ll give you a month. You must give me a detailed report on their status by then!”

The white-robed man snorted and jumped back onto the Shadow Qilin. After that, the Shadow Qilin roared and shot into the clouds, vanishing.
