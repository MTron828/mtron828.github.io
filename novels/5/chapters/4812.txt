Chapter 4801 Thorny Problem

Long Chen wasn’t the only one stunned. Everyone else also stared at Bai Letian in disbelief.

“Dean, aren’t you making things too hard on Long Chen?” asked the Divine Lightning Elder.

To leave a mission that none of them could accomplish to Long Chen, first of all, that was putting too much pressure on him. Other than that, wasn’t that announcing that they were powerless? How could they leave such a thing to a member of the junior generation? They couldn’t be so shameless.

On the other hand, the simple-minded Bai Zhantang didn’t think that far ahead and suggested, “How can we let a disciple take the burden of something so big? If someone has to bear this burden, let me.”

Bai Zhantang patted his chest, but his two wives rose at the same time and moved over.

“What are you two doing?” asked Bai Zhantang, looking at the two of them in confusion. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

His two wives were clearly creating distance between them, silently vetoing his suggestion.

Although both of them felt that it was wrong to give this problem to Long Chen to solve, they didn’t argue against it since it was the sweeping elder’s opinion. Hence, they immediately created a distance between them and Bai Zhantang to avoid him thinking that he had their support.

Long Chen smiled bitterly. “Dean, you are pushing me beyond my ability.”

None of these experienced experts had a solution to this problem, so they were giving the problem to a Divine Venerate disciple? Even Long Chen felt like this was too much.

“Dean Long Chen, you don’t need to feel any pressure. We will be the ones fighting, and you just need to give us the strategy,” said Bai Letian, making it sound so easy. But if this strategy went south, the High Firmament Academy would be doomed. The number one branch related to the academy’s future, and the High Firmament Academy could only stake everything on one gamble right now. At this moment, who would dare to take the lead?

Seeing that Long Chen was worried, Bai Shishi’s mother felt sorry for her future son-in-law. She softly said, “Long Chen, if a problem can’t be solved, it is because we have yet to find the key. This key sometimes has to be found and sometimes has to be made. When we don’t even have the outline of the key yet, it might be best to just keep an eye on any changes. Time is sometimes also a part of the key. When it comes to big things like this, we need the right people at the right place and at the right time. We can slowly gather power and more chips to use as we wait for our chance. We can simply take things one step at a time.”

Long Chen felt a bit better after hearing that. She was entirely correct. Although they would definitely have to reclaim the first branch academy sooner or later, it wasn’t that urgent.

With Long Chen’s hasty nature, he was thinking of how to immediately resolve the situation, but he came up empty. However, after hearing this, he felt much more relaxed.

Bai Xiaole’s mother added her own thoughts. “Big Sister is correct. Time is very favorable to us. Big Sister, Zhantang, and I are soon going to become Heaven Saints. We can also wait for the palace master to return. Then our power will reach an unprecedented peak. You don’t need to feel that much pressure.”

“Where is the palace master?” asked Long Chen, only thinking of him now. The palace master’s power was absolutely terrifying, but Long Chen didn’t see him here.

“The palace master said that he had something extremely important to handle. He said he’d be back in half a year to a year, but he didn’t give us any details as to where he was going,” replied Bai Xiaole’s mother.

To leave at this critical time, whatever it was, it had to be important. However, for something as major as taking back the first branch, they needed the palace master. If they had to wait for him, then there was no need for Long Chen to be hasty.

“The two of them are correct. A meal is eaten one mouthful at a time, and a journey is taken one step at a time. Dean Long Chen, I believe that your top priority should be to get accustomed to the laws of this world. Once your body resonates with the laws, you will no longer be rejected by the Heavenly Daos. Once all of you have gotten used to it, I can take you for a stroll around the first academy, and you can start planning our next steps,” explained Bai Letian.

Long Chen nodded and walked away. Watching him leave, the Divine Lightning Elder smiled bitterly. “How embarrassing. How can we leave such a difficult matter for a Divine Venerate disciple to handle?”

It truly was embarrassing. A group of Heaven Saints were actually powerless, so they had a disciple take charge of their issue, causing them to feel a burning sensation on their faces.

“If it was up to me, who cares about those devils? Who cares if they come from beyond the heavens? We’ll just slaughter them. If one attack isn’t enough, we’ll attack a second time! If that’s not enough, then ten times! We’ll kill them all sooner or later!” declared Bai Zhantang.

The High Heaven Elder shook his head. “Vice Palace Master, you are not yet aware, but those devils are absolutely terrifying. We tried a probing blow while you were gone, and it did not go well.”

“How so?” Bai Zhantang was shocked. The High Heaven Elder was the leader of the four protector Elders, his power unfathomable. Other than the palace master, he was the one that Bai Zhantang respected the most in the academy.

However, even the High Heaven Elder was afraid of these devils? He even described them as absolutely terrifying.

“Those devils...”

Bai Letian interrupted, “We can discuss this later. Right now, it is more urgent for us to establish a new foothold. We are in a difficult position now, and we cannot guarantee that the other side will not use any more sinister moves. Even with the High Firmament Divine Sword in hand, we have to be cautious. No matter how difficult our situation is, we must guarantee the safety of our disciples.”

After saying that, Bai Letian looked at Bai Shishi’s mother, and she immediately said, “My junior sister and I have found a good spot. Although that place is occupied by devils, we can easily take over it with our power. But with the sneak attack this time, our enemies seem to have a perfect grasp of our movements. If we do make this move, I worry that it is entirely within their predictions...”

It was difficult to do anything when their every move was under the purview of their enemies.

The High Heaven Elder said, “That is not impossible. We have to be on guard. Now that the academy’s disciples are here, we need to be even more cautious. The junior generation is the hope for the academy’s future.”

The Divine Lightning Elder and the others nodded. If that sneak attack were to occur when the disciples were here, no one knew just how many of them would have lost their lives in the chaos.

They were all worried and couldn’t come up with any good strategy. Thinking of their dilemma, Bai Letian sighed and smiled bitterly.

“It seems that everything is within the sweeping elder’s calculations. We should just listen to him.”

All of them looked at each other, thinking of what Bai Letian had just said: When there is no strategy to try, instead of messing around, leave the troublesome problem to someone with the means to deal with it.
