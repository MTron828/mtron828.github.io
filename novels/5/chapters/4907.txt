Chapter 4896 Underground Gate

Long Chen felt like a giant mouth had just devoured him as everything turned black. Within this darkness, space and time were in chaos. A powerful tearing force threatened to tear him apart if he wasn’t in the Dragon Blood Battle Armor state.

Long Chen continued to fall, without being able to stop it. He then sensed someone not too far from him. Without even thinking about it, he swung Evilmoon in that direction. In any case, there were only three of them here, so he would attack first and talk later.

Sparks flew, temporarily lighting up the darkness. Long Chen’s saber struck a blood-colored ruler—the weapon of the Blood expert.

The Blood expert’s Heavenly Fate Disk had long since been activated, and blood mist shrouded him. Even as a Heavenly Chosen, he had to unleash his full power to withstand this pressure.

Thanks to the brief sparks, Long Chen spotted the devil expert as well, and the latter was quite far from him.

Long Chen snorted, “I’ll deal with you first then. Hand over all your treasures!”

Suddenly, a powerful suction force came from Evilmoon, causing the iron ruler to stick to it. The Blood expert was startled, as he had never faced such a bizarre technique before. Moreover, they were still falling rapidly, which made it difficult for him to control his body. He was instantly drawn right to where Long Chen wanted him to be.

As Long Chen pulled Evilmoon, his left foot swung out toward the family jewel of his opponent. With his iron ruler stuck and seeing Long Chen’s kick approaching, the Blood expert could only bend over and slam his left elbow into Long Chen’s foot.

Just as they clashed, the Blood expert’s elbow blazed with light, and blood-colored runes shone through his robes. This seemingly casual blow was actually a killing technique.

However, his attack missed as Long Chen’s kick was a feint. By bending over, the Blood expert had essentially delivered his head right to Long Chen. Instantly sensing danger, he tried to turn, but his vision flashed.

Long Chen slapped him sixteen times, the crisp sounds resembling a string of firecrackers. After those sixteen slaps, the Blood expert's face swelled, and he grew lightheaded. Just then, his mouth opened wide.

At this moment, Long Chen’s hair stood on end, and he instinctively raised Evilmoon in front of him.

“Damn!” Long Chen grunted. Half his body went numb as he flew backward.

The Blood expert had actually spat out a three-inch dagger—another terrifying Heaven Saint divine weapon—toward Long Chen. This tiny blood-colored dagger was powerful enough to almost make Long Chen spit out blood. Most terrifying of all, he hadn’t sensed it at all before it was unleashed. If it weren’t for his quick reactions, he would have been instantly killed.

Long Chen couldn’t help but ask, “How treacherous. You were actually hiding a weapon in your mouth. Tell me the truth, what kind of weapon do you have in your butt?”

His killing blow had been blocked, and now Long Chen was even mocking him. As a result, the Blood expert was enraged. His rage stemmed from the fact that this dagger was one of his core divine weapons, mostly used to increase his cultivation speed. It was a legacy treasure of his race. Every generation would impart their life’s full comprehension into the dagger before passing it on to the next. With this dagger, he essentially possessed the accumulated knowledge and combat experience of dozens of generations of experts. It was his secret killing tool, rarely used but never failing when deployed.

However, today, even at this close distance and after a perfect setup, Long Chen managed to block it. When he heard Long Chen’s taunt, flames almost burst out of his eyes. Yet, with both of them falling rapidly, he was unable to charge at Long Chen and could only glare at his arrogant act.

“Don’t fall into my hands, or I’ll make you regret coming to this world!” threatened the Blood expert.

“Hurry up and hand over your treasures, or you’ll regret coming out of your mother’s—cough, you know,” countered Long Chen arrogantly as he rested Evilmoon on his shoulder.

The Blood expert roared, “Fuck you! We just opened the underground gate when you came here! It’s only because of you that it went out of control!”

“Oh, you still haven’t gotten the treasure? It seems that I arrived just in time,” replied Long Chen, his expression brightening. It seemed that the treasures were here. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

“Indeed. It just so happened that we were missing a blood sacrifice. Your arrival is perfect.” The devil expert’s sinister sneer rang out in the darkness.

Long Chen laughed. “I feel like sacrificing the two of you and then taking the treasures myself is the way to go.”

“Treasures? Do you even know what’s inside?” sneered the Blood expert.

“Who cares? As long as they’re treasures, they’re related to me by destiny. All masterless treasures are mine. All treasures with masters are also mine. In any case, as long as I want it, it’s mine,” replied Long Chen indifferently.

The Blood expert and devil expert snorted at the same time.

“Ignorant!”

“Idiot!”

BOOM!

Suddenly, this space shook, and Long Chen stopped falling. The abrupt halt felt like he had smashed into something, nearly causing him to spit out blood. After stabilizing himself, he immediately took a step in the direction where he remembered the Blood expert had been.

The Blood expert was also dazed by that sudden impact. Before he could stabilize himself, Long Chen’s Saber Qi arrived in front of him.

With a furious roar, the Blood expert swung his iron ruler and somehow managed to accurately block Long Chen’s attack.

However, Long Chen’s strike had the advantage of initiative, while the Blood expert’s block was hasty and unsteady. Still reeling from the impact, the Blood expert was sent flying despite his defense, spitting out a mouthful of blood.

After sending him flying, Long Chen had no chance to follow up. Borrowing the rebound force from striking the Blood expert, he spun back, and Evilmoon sliced through the air behind him.

BOOM!

Evilmoon struck a giant steel rod as the devil expert had come to assist. When these two divine weapons collided, Long Chen retreated several steps, while the devil expert tumbled into the distance.

“Tch, is this all you got? Even if the two of you joined forces, you wouldn’t be a match for Huo Qianwu. How dare you act arrogant in front of Boss Long San?” snorted Long Chen.

Long Chen rested Evilmoon on his shoulder, gazing at them scornfully. After repeated probing blows, he found that both of them were at least one level weaker than Huo Qianwu. With that, he was sure of victory.

Buzz.

Suddenly, this dark world lit up, and upon seeing his surroundings, Long Chen jumped in fright.

“Fool, you didn’t even know what kind of danger you threw yourself in! Now there’s no escape for you!” shouted the Blood expert. He wiped off some blood from the corner of his mouth, smiling sinisterly at Long Chen.
