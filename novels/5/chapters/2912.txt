Chapter 2901 Menacing Beast Meets Menacing Human

Long Chen and the Berserk Blood Mammoth stared at each other. Eventually, Long Chen said, “What are you looking at?”

Hearing his voice, the giant mammoth quivered and took a few steps back. There was a hint of fear in its eyes.

The observers were in an uproar when they saw Long Chen scare off such a powerful Berserk Blood Mammoth just like that.

“Rumor is that higher level devil beasts possess some intelligence. This Berserk Blood Mammoth seems to have sensed something,” said an instructor.

There were many different kinds of devil beasts, and not all of them were brainless. Some had an intelligence not inferior to humans.

“Seems like the ominous beast has encountered an ominous human,” said Luo Ning.

“A mutated devil beast’s intelligence is a bit higher than an ordinary devil beast. Otherwise, it wouldn’t have abandoned Mu Qingyun who repeatedly injured it to kill others. But it truly is incomprehensible why it’s so afraid of Long Chen,” said Luo Bing, feeling shocked. Just what was Long Chen hiding? Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

“Either listen to my orders, or die. Choose,” said Long Chen.

The Berserk Blood Mammoth quivered, seemingly struggling. In the end, it knelt down and lowered its head, its long trunk forming a bridge.

Long Chen smiled and then slowly calmed the raging dragon blood in his body. Just now, he had unleashed his dragon might to suppress this Berserk Blood Mammoth. He had only been testing it out and hadn’t expected it to be so effective.

The dragon might was still so useful in the immortal world. In front of countless shocked gazes, Long Chen trod over the mammoth’s trunk to the top of its head. Even Mu Qingyun and the others were dumbfounded.

“Kill them!” When Long Chen gave an order to the Berserk Blood Mammoth, it instantly stood and roared, turning to charge through the other beasts.

With its giant body, it was like a war chariot blasting through mice. Those beasts were unable to receive a single blow from it.

Its tusks glowed, and everywhere they went, blood and flesh flew. Those beasts were like pieces of paper in front of it.

“Heavens!”

Long Chen stood atop the Berserk Blood Mammoth’s head, appearing like a divine king overlooking the battlefield. That air around him moved the hearts of countless women.

There was a wild charisma around Long Chen, one full of danger and could not be tamed, and yet it was this wildness that possessed such killing power.

One man and one mammoth rampaged across the battlefield.

As for Chu Kuang’s side, they entered the Devil Slaughter Path half an incense stick’s worth of time after Long Chen’s side. However, due to having so many more experts, they quickly caught up.

Long Chen’s side had barely crossed a fourth of the Devil Slaughter Path when Chu Kuang’s side reached the one-third point.

It was because Chu Kuang’s side had Gu Fei, Tang Yaochen, Li Chengbei, Xiang Kejie, Yang Fang, and the others. They were all strong experts of their own powers, so these beasts were nothing in front of them.

Due to their crazy charge, they left behind the rear where over ten of their members died. On the other hand, Long Chen’s side’s steady advance still had yet to meet a single casualty.

Slowly but surely, Long Chen’s side was being left behind by Chu Kuang. But the addition of the mammoth instantly cleared their path.

With such an asset, the beasts in the path were quickly flattened until only a few were left.

“That’s cheating! It’s completely unfair!” raged Chu Huairen.

Chu Kuang’s side was slaughtering the beasts, but Long Chen was actually controlling the strongest beast to slaughter the other, turning this into a play. Chu Huairen was unable to remain still when he saw the vicious beasts on Long Chen’s side falling one by one.

“Cheating? Didn’t someone say that such a thing was strictly against the academy’s rules, and that no one would dare to cheat? That they would be courting death? Why has your tone changed all of a sudden? When things were unfavorable to Long Chen, you didn’t say anything about it being unfair, did you? As one of the three leaders of the Discipline Institute, a person cannot have a narrow, biased heart. There are countless people watching here, so take note of your position. Otherwise, it will affect the academy’s prestige. My Discipline Institute cannot carry such a bad name,” said the head judge.

The other magistrate glared at Chu Huairen. That one gaze had many meanings. Some things couldn’t be randomly said out loud, or they would be denounced. If it was reported to the dean, it would be very troublesome.

Hence, Chu Huairen sat back down, his expression extremely ugly. Everyone knew he was definitely in a bad mood.

Before this, when the Berserk Blood Mammoth first appeared, although it couldn’t be said that he had laughed at Long Chen, he had said that no one could cheat here, so it could only be blamed on Long Chen’s bad luck. But now that Long Chen controlled it, he switched sides, saying that it was cheating. That was a complete loss of face.

Heaven Master Yun Yang and Dong Ming exchanged a glance, both of them shaking their heads, clearly looking down on this kind of person.

At first, the Berserk Blood Mammoth hadn’t been going all-out while executing Long Chen’s orders. However, everything changed after Long Chen had stealthily given it a medicinal pill.

That pill ignited its hot blood, and so it began to cooperate with Long Chen. When it did its work well, he slipped it another pill.

With two pills down, it began to really put in some effort and instantly responded to Long Chen’s orders. It was even more obedient than housepets with slave marks.

After a few rampages, the Devil Slaughter Path was sparse with beasts. With everyone else following up, more and more of them were killed. And when there were only ten left, the door at the end of the path opened.

Mist flowed out. They could vaguely see a mountain within that mist, and at the top of it was a flag.

That was the divine flag. Any group that seized it would be victorious. This was the final crux upon which this competition hung on.

“Everyone, follow me!”

Long Chen shouted and charged forward with the Berserk Blood Mammoth. With victory in sight, the Unfettered Alliance’s disciples roared and chased after him.
