Chapter 2402 Earth Rank Top Tier Tribulation Pill

Translator: BornToBe

“What is that? How can it be so big?”

When they saw that pill, everyone was surprised. It was even a bit bigger than an adult’s fist. Even giant pills were only the size of a baby’s fist, so the size was definitely off. Furthermore, the pill was black and covered in thick veins. Its appearance was definitely not that of the Hundred Dao Merger Spirit Pill.

Lightning arrows rained down from the tribulation at the pill. Long Chen actually made no move to stop them, simply allowing them to strike the pill.

Shockingly, those veiny marks on the pill actually lit up and blocked the tribulation. The lightning shattered on contact with it.

“Is that really a medicinal pill?”

People were unable to believe their eyes. That black ball seemed to possess the aura of a medicinal pill, but they didn’t sense any of the fluctuations of a spirit pill.

It was just a black ball hanging in the air motionlessly as it was struck by lightning.

Long Chen stood beside it. He was also not reacting to the lightning arrows. Ever since his last tribulation when Sovereign Mo Li had stabbed him with his sword, he found that his internal organs that had been blasted apart had become stronger after recovering. Lightning was no longer able to invade them. Even Long Chen didn’t know if this was a gift that Sovereign Mo Li had given him.

This level of tribulation was nothing to Long Chen. As for Lei Long, it didn’t even have a desire to consume this level of lightning. It had also gotten picky, and lightning that wasn’t strong enough was no longer worth consuming.

Seeing him standing so indifferently in the face of this lightning assault, one of the divine families’ young women suddenly said, “You know, Long Chen isn’t actually that hateful. He’s pretty handsome.”

As soon as she said this, the surrounding male disciples glared at her, causing her to shut her mouth.

However, even though they didn’t like Long Chen, they had to admit that the current Long Chen was definitely attractive. Everyone’s gazes were attracted to him, but he seemed completely unaffected by them. People suddenly realized that his expression also hadn’t changed when they had been taunting him. He didn’t seem pleased or dazzled at all. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

It was a stark contrast to how Ye Qian had seemed after refining the Hundred Dao Merger Spirit Pill. One acted as if he was unmatched in the world, while another was silent.

According to reason, this was the best moment for Long Chen to mock the people that had taunted him, but he didn’t say anything. Those disciples of the Divine Pill Division felt like they had been silently slapped by his disdain.

The tribulation continued to grow stronger, until crunchy sounds began to come out of the pill.

“The pill’s going to break!”

Cracks appeared on the pill. Everyone looked at Long Chen, only to see him watching indifferently.

Finally, the lightning grew so strong that the pill couldn’t endure it. Pieces of it began to fall off.

“What?!”

When the black pieces fell off one by one, people found that inside was a red pill that had been covered by a black shell.

“The black shell was the pill veil?! If the pill veil is already so powerful, then how powerful is the actual pill?!”

A pill veil was not rare. Many people would refine a pill veil to protect the pill. That was to maintain the medicinal energy within the pill and make sure that it didn’t leak outside.

A pill veil was normally very weak, but Long Chen’s pill veil was strong enough to block this terrifying lightning.

When the red pill appeared, the tribulation grew stronger once more. An incense stick’s worth of time later, it also began to crack.

“What?! This is also a pill veil?!”

Shockingly, when the red exterior shattered, it revealed a violet pill inside. The red layer was also a pill veil.

“Two layers of pill veils? How did he do that?!” One of the Elders of the Divine Pill Division cried out in shock. It was hard enough to refine a single pill veil while refining the pill, so the concept of refining two was so difficult that it only existed in theory. No one would ever do such a thing in reality. By the point that a pill veil was refined, the pill was essentially finished. There was no need to take the risk of destroying the entire pill just to create a second layer.

The lightning grew stronger again, growing berserk as if it had to destroy this pill.

The violet pill suddenly exploded into powder, making everyone jump.

One of the disciples suddenly laughed. “Hahaha, it was a failure…”

Just as he laughed, he realized everyone was looking at him like they wanted to slap him. Even enemies wouldn’t laugh at other alchemists for having a pill fail a tribulation. This kind of display was a complete disgrace.

“It isn’t a failure. That violet layer was also a pill veil. Just what kind of pill did Long Chen refine?”

A pill the size of a baby’s fist appeared within the violet dust. It was as white as jade, glowing like the moon. The plaza was illuminated by its sacred light, making people feel like they were in a daydream.

“How beautiful!” Some of the female disciples couldn’t help sighing in wonder.

The five-colored pill lightning in the sky suddenly condensed. It transformed into one giant five-colored sword the size of a mountain. It had condensed the full power of the tribulation. Then it whistled toward the pill with endless destructive power.

BOOM!

A hand reached out and caught the lightning sword, shattering it. It transformed into lightning runes that filled the plaza.

The pure white pill was immersed within the sea of lightning runes. Suddenly, runes lit up all over it. Flower petals began to bloom beneath it.

The petals began to absorb the lightning, growing larger and larger. Every petal represented a Dao.

Looking closely, there were ninety-nine petals. They supported the pill like stars around the moon. Everyone was straining their necks just to get a better look.

The lightning faded, leaving behind that sacred flower. At the center of that flower was a pure white pearl. This sight was deeply imprinted within the minds of everyone who saw it. It was a sight that they would remember for the rest of their lives.

Ye Qian was pale. Seeing that flower, he was unable to say a single word. It felt like he had lost his soul.

He had lost, and very miserably at that. He had never imagined that he would lose to someone from the same generation. Furthermore, the difference was so immense.

Everyone was silent. The Divine Pill Division’s disciples didn’t dare to say a word. Now there was a trace of reverence in their eyes when they looked at Long Chen. His Pill Dao had reached a height that they couldn’t even hope of reaching.

They were the ones unqualified to carry his shoes. When they thought back to their mocking, they realized just how ignorant and childish they had been. They didn’t dare to say a word because their faces hurt too much. Although many people were questioning whether this was really the Hundred Dao Merger Spirit Pill, they were afraid of further slapping their own faces.

Long Chen waved his hand. The petals around the pill faded, and it floated over to Long Chen. When it landed in his hand, the radiance filling the world vanished. Looking closely, people were able to see ripples within the pill that seemed to be manifesting some kind of Dao charm. It was as if the pill contained its own world.

“Marvelous. I didn’t expect to be able to personally witness the birth of an earth rank top grade tribulation pill.” Finally, the Pill Doyen stood and clapped.

“Senior is praising me. This Hundred Dao Merger Spirit Pill cannot be said to have reached the earth rank due to not having its spirit awaken yet,” said Long Chen.

“Awakening the spirit should be nothing more than lifting a hand to you. You’re too modest.” The Pill Doyen smiled.

Long Chen returned the smile. Not continuing on that topic, he hesitatingly asked, “Senior, I’m embarrassed to say this too directly, but I wonder if you can take the initiative a bit. I’m rather busy, so I have to go soon…”

The Pill Doyen clapped his forehead. “Hahaha, I’ve grown muddled with age.” He turned to the frozen Ye Qian. “If you are willing to bet, you must be willing to lose. Hand over what you staked.”
