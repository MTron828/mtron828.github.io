Chapter 4875 Once More Descending Upon Heaven Screen Mountain

“What? How long has it been?” asked Long Chen, startled. It felt like only a few minutes had passed, so how could hours have gone by?

When Long Chen and Mo Nian walked out, they saw a golden chariot waiting for them, and Xing Wujiang was standing beside it with no one else around. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

Normally, the city lord mansion was bustling with activity, but now it appeared deserted. Long Chen and Mo Nian hurriedly approached, not dwelling on the absence of people. Mo Nian quickly apologized, “Big Brother Wujiang, sorry for making you wait!”

“Long Chen, are you alright?!” Xing Wujiang exclaimed, startled by Long Chen’s pale face. He appeared as if he had just been rescued from drowning.

“I’m fine,” replied Long Chen with haste. Gazing into that scene had sucked away all his energy. Luckily, this was just a kind of emptiness, not an actual wound. As long as he rested, he could recover.

Xing Wujiang said, “Get on then. You can rest on the chariot. The time for the opening of Heaven Screen Mountain has passed...”

“What?!” Long Chen and Mo Nian both jumped.

“It’s fine. I’ve had the Square Heaven Seal stall. Heaven Screen Mountain will not open before you arrive,” added Xing Wujiang.

There was an optimal time to open Heaven Screen Mountain, but due to Long Chen, Xing Wujiang delayed it. However, no matter how long he stalled, he couldn’t push it beyond a few hours without exhausting a significant amount of the Square Heaven Seal’s power.

Opening Heaven Screen Mountain was not a casual task. Even with the Square Heaven Seal’s power, it required careful preparation and attunement with the mountain’s laws. Once their energies merged harmoniously, the ideal moment for opening would present itself.

Missing this optimal opening window would likely require the Square Heaven Seal to recuperate for several decades before it could attempt to open Heaven Screen Mountain again.

Mo Nian and Long Chen hastily boarded the chariot, which then rose into the sky and departed from the city lord mansion.

From the chariot, they could see the full scope of Devil Fall City. However, Long Chen and Mo Nian were shocked by how deathly silent it was. Other than the unending buildings, they couldn’t even find the shadow of a person. Was this really the Devil Fall City that they knew?

“The Square Heaven Seal will enter a weakened state after expending its core energy to open Heaven Screen Mountain. Many people are concerned about the impending battle, so they’ve left,” explained Xing Wujiang.

“Has the Feather Spirit race left?” Long Chen asked anxiously, as they were the ones he was most concerned about.

“Yes. They were amongst the first to leave, and they even moved their sacred mountain,” answered Xing Wujiang.

Hearing that, Long Chen and Mo Nian relaxed. All of a sudden, Long Chen looked at Xing Wujiang and waved his finger up and down.

Xing Wujiang looked into the distance. “In a bit, I will borrow the Square Heaven Seal’s power to send you in. You’ll have to endure the pressure. Prepare yourselves.”

“Alright.” Long Chen and Mo Nian both nodded, exchanging a look. They both knew that from this moment on, they couldn’t speak freely. Outside of the city lord mansion, everything they did was under the observation of the Square Heaven Seal. They shouldn’t inadvertently raise its suspicions.

When they had flown a certain distance out of the city, the city quivered, and a ray of golden light shot through the void. The golden chariot then entered that spatial channel.

In a short moment, the channel closed behind them, and Long Chen’s pupils shrank. Just before the channel closed, he saw a giant head quivering beneath Devil Fall City.

Devil Fall City had now become an empty city, and even Xing Wujiang had been sent out. Now, the devil head could do whatever it wanted with no one being the wiser.

Perhaps it was so obedient because of this fat chance. Long Chen glanced at Xing Wujiang. His expression was completely calm, and he even gave Long Chen a faint smile.

Long Chen and Mo Nian both felt a sense of pressure. If Mo Nian could not take the corpse, the fully bedeviled Square Heaven Seal would be a lost cause.

If that were to happen, the divine weapon that generations of the Xing family’s ancestors had worshiped would turn traitor. This result was unacceptable to any of them.

“What a pity. If only the Square Heaven Seal could wait a bit longer,” Evilmoon sighed.

“What is it?” asked Long Chen.

“If you give me a bit more time and let me get stronger, once I refine the Emperor Blood Silk Net’s power, I can consume it directly,” replied Evilmoon.

“Once you refine the Emperor Blood Silk Net, you mean you will be able to devour the Square Heaven Seal?” Long Chen couldn’t help being shocked. Didn’t that mean the Emperor Blood Silk Net was a treasure on the same level as the Square Heaven Seal?

“If it was in its strongest state, perhaps it wouldn’t work. However, it is basically half dead. Consuming it is nothing difficult. Long Chen, work hard. Get that corpse and don’t let it merge with the head. Once I get stronger, I will feast,” remarked Evilmoon.

“Mo Nian already views the corpse as a must-have. Ignoring everything else, even if it was just for Big Brother Wujiang, we’ll definitely do everything we can to not let the devil creature resurrect.”

“Tch, this really pisses me off. I have so much power but don’t have the ability to unleash it. I feel like I’m going to go crazy,” cursed Evilmoon.

When Evilmoon devoured those dragon souls and came to control its new body, becoming its master, it learned how terrifying this weapon was.

However, Evilmoon was still too weak to control this divine weapon, so it needed to rely on Long Chen’s power every time, which caused it to feel like trash. This situation was even worse than when it was sealed in the mortal world, which was unacceptable to an entity as prideful as Evilmoon.

“Don’t worry, I believe it won’t be long before the name of Dragonbone Evilmoon resounds throughout the nine heavens and ten lands,” reassured Long Chen. He could understand Evilmoon’s feelings, but in the end, their path had to be taken one step at a time; some things couldn’t be rushed. The more they hurried, the more likely there would be problems.

At this moment, space quivered intensely again as the golden chariot tore through the void. They then saw a mountain range covered in a black heavenly screen. Even from inside of the chariot, they could sense an air of decay coming from it. This place was filled with the aura of death.

“Heaven Screen Mountain. Hehe, I’m back,” Mo Nian chuckled with a hint of excitement in his eyes.
