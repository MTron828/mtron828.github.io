Chapter 2092 Related to the Sovereigns

Hand seals began to appear on top of the stone stage, blossoming like flowers and revolving around a medicinal pill. That pill was like the bright moon surrounded by stars. It appeared especially mysterious and dazzling.

“A top grade eleventh tier medicinal pill, and furthermore... it has the mark of heavenly lightning! It’s a tribulation pill!”

The experts here all had immense experience and instantly recognized this medicinal pill’s quality.

Huang Feiyan in particular began to tremble. Although she didn’t recognize what this pill was, she could sense its power.

As those hand seals blossomed, soul energy crazily rushed toward it, surging through the walls. This pill was condensing the soul energy of all things within heaven and earth. It was a truly shocking scene.

After three breaths’ time, the middle-aged man said, “This pill’s name is the Thousand Hand Soul Condensing Pill. It is an extremely rare tribulation pill. Let alone in the current age, even in the ancient era, such a pill was rarely seen. I’m sure everyone here is aware that any eleventh tier medicinal pills that still exist were nourished through special formations and never went through tribulation. That’s because the odds of a pill surviving tribulation are too low. It is said that the odds are one in ten, but in reality, as an alchemist, I can tell everyone that the actual chances definitely do not surpass one in a hundred. Just refining a top grade eleventh tier medicinal pill is as difficult as ascending the heavens. Sometimes, it doesn’t just rely on power but also luck. Even a grandmaster of the Pill Dao may not manage to refine a top grade eleventh tier pill in their lifetime. Some grandmasters strived their entire lives to do so only to fail, and countless geniuses of the Pill Dao have lost their lives in pursuit of refining a top grade eleventh tier pill. That’s why this Thousand Hand Soul Condensing Pill is so precious. Please don’t misunderstand, I’m not saying this to embellish this medicinal pill. This pill was offered by a certain heavenly genius, and it doesn’t matter to my Dongfang family how much it sells for...”

It wasn’t the Dongfang family’s? People were stunned. Who would actually auction off a tribulation pill?

Instantly, quite a few people glanced at Long Chen. Long Chen narrowed his eyes. This appraiser really said a lot of extra words. Was he trying to make a target of him?

“Long Chen, is this Thousand Hand Soul Condensing Pill yours?” asked Beitang Rushuang.

“Yes.” Long Chen nodded. There was no need for him to lie to them.

“You really are an idiot! How could you sell off such a precious tribulation pill!?” Beitang Rushuang was shocked.

“I need money.” Long Chen shrugged. He wasn’t born rich like her.

Beitang Rushuang looked at him like he was a wastrel. That made Long Chen laugh. This pill was something he could refine as many of as he wanted. This treasure in other people’s eyes was nothing to him.

Although the middle-aged man hadn’t directly said that the owner of this Thousand Hand Soul Condensing Pill was Long Chen, most people had already guessed it. The news of Long Chen obtaining the Moon and Star Refining Furnace and the Nine Lotus Soul Condensing Pill had already spread.

As for this Thousand Hand Soul Condensing Pill, it had a similar effect as the Nine Lotus Soul Condensing Pill. If someone had both, it truly was possible to sell one.

“Although I’m sure you’ve guessed the effect of this Thousand Hand Soul Condensing Pill, let me give a brief explanation. It nourishes the soul, but that’s not all. It will leave a seed within the Yuan Spirit. Like this, the consumer and the pill will become one, and for one year, the pill will continue nourishing the soul. The Thousand Hand Soul Condensing Pill’s essence is to nourish the soul with all Daos. Furthermore, this pill is most likely ten times greater than an ordinary top grade eleventh tier pill. That’s all I have to say. The starting bid is five hundred underworld spirit beads, and each bid must be fifty beads greater than the last. Let the bidding commence!”

Even the middle-aged man was getting excited. As an alchemist, auctioning off a tribulation pill was also a kind of honor.

“One thousand underworld spirit beads!” Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

Huang Feiyan immediately doubled the price, indicating that she had to obtain it.

“One thousand one hundred!”

However, her high bid didn’t scare off others. Beitang Rushuang also took action, immediately adding another one hundred.

“Do you want this Thousand Hand Soul Condensing Pill?” asked Long Chen.

“Fool, who wouldn’t want such a treasure?” Beitang Rushuang rolled her eyes.

Long Chen stared blankly at her before realizing the issue. These ancient monsters had definitely consumed medicinal pills to increase their Spiritual Strength. With their status, even top grade eleventh tier medicinal pills weren’t out of their reach.

However, every pill could only be eaten so many times before it lost its effect. Normally, a pill would only have half the effect if someone had already consumed an identical pill. By the third pill, the effect would have dropped by half once again. Moreover, the fourth pill would have almost no effect.

Their bodies already had a resistance toward ordinary top grade eleventh tier pills. If they wanted to power up again, they would need something much stronger, and so a tribulation pill was their best option. Only a tribulation pill could stimulate their potential with one hundred perfect effect.

Other than Long Chen, practically everyone wanted to increase their Spiritual Strength immensely. So these spiritual medicinal pills always went for high prices.

“One thousand three hundred!”

“One thousand five hundred!”

...

The price crazily rose. It quickly broke past two thousand. At that point, Beitang Rushuang shook her head and gave up.

Although this Thousand Hand Soul Condensing Pill was valuable, there was no way to buy it at a reasonable price. Everyone was fighting for it. The final price would definitely be beyond its actual value.

People were still fighting over it when the bid broke past two thousand.

“Two thousand eight hundred!”

“Two thousand nine hundred!”

“...”

At two thousand nine hundred, the bidding was done by just two people.

One was Huang Feiyan, while the other was the Pill Fairy Yu Qingxuan. That was a bit surprising. They didn’t know why the Pill Fairy wanted the Thousand Hand Soul Condensing Pill.

“Pill Fairy, this Thousand Hand Soul Condensing Pill is very useful to me. If you are generous today, I will definitely repay you in the future,” Huang Feiyan actually spoke softly to the Pill Fairy.

The Pill Fairy hesitated before saying, “This Thousand Hand Soul Condensing Pill is different from ordinary tribulation pills. It was refined with some special techniques. I’m very interested in it, so forgive me for not being able to concede.”

Huang Feiyan was enraged once again. She had already taken on a humble attitude, almost begging her, but the Pill Fairy refused.

“Getting angry is an instinct, but controlling your anger is a skill. Anger cannot resolve problems. Only by calming down can you find the key to resolve your problem,” said Kun Pengzi calmly. He was sitting to the side, his eyes closed in meditation.

Huang Feiyan took a deep breath, calming herself down. She said, “Pill Fairy, if you are interested in this pill, then how about you let me have it, and I will lend it to you to study for ten days? How is that?”

Huang Feiyan now realized that the Pill Fairy wasn’t interested in the medicinal effect but the techniques used to refine it. As for Huang Feiyan, she wasn’t interested in those alchemy techniques, so she had finally figured out a way for the two of them to compromise. In truth, she was a bit afraid of the Pill Fairy.

After all, Pill Valley almost controlled the lifeblood of all the pills on the Martial Heaven Continent. No one knew just how much wealth they had gathered over the years. In any case, it was definitely an unimaginable amount.

That was why Huang Feiyan didn’t dare to challenge the Pill Fairy in wealth. Furthermore, Pill Valley and the Xuan Beasts were not enemies. They could even be considered allies. There was no need for them to fight.

The Pill Fairy considered Huang Feiyan’s request and then nodded. “That’s acceptable.”

“Many thanks!” Huang Feiyan was delighted, thanking her graciously. In the end, for the price of two thousand nine hundred and fifty underworld spirit beads, the Thousand Hand Soul Condensing Pill entered her pocket.

The bid of two thousand and nine hundred underworld spirit beads had been made by the Pill Fairy, so Huang Feiyan had no choice but to increase the bid by fifty. Despite that, she was crazy with joy.

“That’s clearly cheating,” said Long Chen hatefully.

If the two of them had continued competing, he would have been the one to benefit most. As it was possible to consult with other potential bidders, what was the point of an auction?

“That’s about enough. A normal top grade eleventh tier pill would go for around thirty underworld spirit beads. Ten times that price is three hundred, while this price is almost a hundred times that. It’s a huge amount of money, so you should be happy,” consoled Nangong Zuiyue.

“This price really is high. Long Chen, did you know in advance that Huang Feiyan and the Pill Fairy would fight over it, so you put it up for auction?” asked Beitang Rushuang suspiciously.

“What are you nonsensically spouting?” Long Chen glared at her.

Other than Ye Zhiqiu, the others laughed. In truth, Long Chen had only calculated in Huang Feiyan. He hadn’t thought that the Pill Fairy would join in.

He knew that Huang Feiyan would go all-out to obtain this Thousand Hand Soul Condensing Pill. Originally, Long Chen had been planning on bidding against her just to drive the price up, but then the middle-aged man, that idiot, had said too many words, exposing him as the owner.

Fortunately, the Pill Fairy had competed against Huang Feiyan, driving the price up a bit. Two thousand nine hundred and fifty underworld spirit beads was an unimaginable amount to Long Chen.

With the Thousand Hand Soul Condensing Pill auctioned off, everyone’s attention once more focused on the middle-aged man.

He took a deep breath, announcing, “This next item is special. Look at it closely because... it is related to the Sovereigns!”

When his final words rang out, it shook the hearts of every expert present.
