Chapter 4025 Silver Wing Blood Falcon

The Feather Cry Empire's experts stood stunned as twenty battleships smashed into their capital like cannonballs.

Seeing the impending disaster, countless people cried out in shock and scrambled to avoid it. However, the attack was so swift and unexpected that most of them couldn’t dodge in time.

Ten Lightning Thunderclap Battleships and ten Blue Flame Battleships, each laden with Heavenly Lightning Crystals and Heavenly Flame Crystals, collided with the ground, resulting in a world-shaking explosion upon impact.

The devastating blast rocked the area as flames and lightning spread, killing the surrounding experts, leaving destruction and chaos in its wake.

In an instant, the glorious capital was razed to the ground, leaving Qin Yu in a state of shock and rage. He actually thought that the battleships had gone out of control. But when he saw Long Chen and the others in the air, he understood.

“Warriors of the Vermilion Bird Empire, the time to protect the Vermilion Bird Empire’s people and dignity has come! The enemies before you are not humans, they are bloodthirsty jackals! Raise your weapons, pierce the armor of your enemies, cut off their heads, and protect your families in the empire! On the battlefield, there is no mercy, no compassion. What you need is the courage to fight to the death against your enemies, the courage to face death and fear without retreat!”

“Kill!”

Long Chen shot toward Qin Yu, his Blood Qi rumbling like wild thunder.

“You are Long Chen? Brat, you’re courting death!” Qin Yu finally understood that Long Chen and the others had disguised themselves as the experts from the Violet Thunderclap Empire and the Blue Flame Empire to cause a calamity for him.

Just now, the detonations of those battleships had killed countless experts, which were mostly his empire’s elites, causing Qin Yu’s heart to drip blood.

Thus, seeing Long Chen coming at him, Qin Yu exploded with killing intent. His three flowers then quivered, and he unleashed a claw at Long Chen, instantly using his sharpest killing blow.

As the sharp claw raked through the air, an enormous claw-image filled the sky, resonating with the Heavenly Daos. The moment he made his move, all of heaven and earth fell under his control.

BOOM!

Long Chen’s fist then smashed into the claw, spreading a ripple through the world. In the end, both Long Chen and Qin Yu grunted and fell back, being evenly matched.

“What?!”

Long Chen, an Immortal King, was able to fight evenly against a three-flower Earth Venerate, someone two major realms above him. The Feather Cry Empire’s experts couldn’t believe their eyes.Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

BOOM!

Following that, there was another intense explosion. To everyone’s surprise, Yu Qingxuan was attacking a white-haired elder, who was also a three-flower Earth Venerate. She and the other imperial disciples once more joined forces to fight a three-flower Earth Venerate.

However, this three-flower Earth Venerate’s power was actually inferior to Lan Tianba. That was because his realm was entirely created through piling up medicinal pills and outside forces.

If Lan Tianba could be considered a half-step three-flower Earth Venerate, then this person was a quasi three-flower Earth Venerate. As a result, after receiving one blow from Yu Qingxuan and the others, he already hacked up blood.

Yu Qingxuan, Zhu Yunwen, and the others were dumbfounded by this sight. During their intense fight with Lan Tianba, they had sustained numerous injuries, and on their way to this place, they had only managed to partially recover their strength. Thus, they had anticipated another grueling and bloody battle. But to their surprise, this elder turned out to be considerably weaker than expected.

“Is he a fake?” shouted Yu Qianxue.

“Who cares? Kill him first!” responded Zhu Yifeng.

They then joined forces against the elder. As for the other experts of the Feather Cry Empire, they tried to help as well, but the imperial disciples forced them back.

Although the detonation of the battleships had killed a portion of their experts, there were still millions and millions of them. In truth, the Vermilion Bird Empire was at an absolute disadvantage just by looking at the number. Fortunately, the imperial disciples had completely transformed themselves, so they simply slaughtered their enemies, decimating the Feather Cry Empire’s experts.

Meanwhile, Long Chen was fighting Qin Yu. As the fight went on, the Blood Qi in his body circulated even faster and stronger.

After learning the Dragon Soul Body Forging Art, Long Chen’s essence blood, spiritual qi, and bones all had spherical runes inside of them. They were burning, like a melting glacier, unleashing an endless flood of energy throughout Long Chen’s body.

Every time Long Chen’s fist struck out, the void collapsed, as if heaven and earth could not contain his power.

On the other hand, Qin Yu, the Empire Lord, had his three flowers revolving behind him. As he did so, the ten thousand Daos rumbled, and countless runes flowed on top of his body. He was clearly going all-out.

“Your Blood Qi is deficient, as well as your soul. Have you been consumed by wine and women?”

As Long Chen fought, he began to force back Qin Yu. Slowly, he realized that his opponent seemed to be in a weakened state and not trying to hold back.

Clearly, Qin Yu’s aura was slightly stronger than Lan Tianba’s, but his actual combat power was a level weaker. So, it was very curious.

Long Chen knew that this was their final chance for a sneak attack. In a bit, the destruction of the Blue Flame Empire would quickly become widespread knowledge. There was no chance for another sneak attack, so Long Chen wanted to test himself against a powerful expert.

“Ignorant brat, if I hadn’t just sacrificed a large portion of my essence blood and soul, would you even be able to receive three attacks from me?!” raged Qin Yu.

Following his roar, the earth began to shake, and a giant sacrificial altar broke out of the ground. On it, there was a totem pole of an immemorial devil bird.

It seemed to be a falcon with sharp claws that looked to be made of gold, but its wings were silver. As for its eyes, they were filled with an ominous light.

“Oh, to awaken it, you sacrificed your blood and soul. No wonder you’re so weak,” said Long Chen.

This Silver Wing Blood Falcon was also an immemorial beast, known to be bloodthirsty and ferocious. In order to worship such a heroic spirit, you had to offer it enough blood soul energy as tribute.

Furthermore, in order to awaken it, Qin Yu had sacrificed a huge amount of blood soul energy from others to it, but it still wasn’t enough. In the end, he sacrificed a portion of his own blood soul energy to awaken it.

When this totem appeared, a berserk fearsome aura radiated throughout the world. After that, a giant figure flew out of it. It was the Silver Wing Blood Falcon.

In an instant, it locked onto Long Chen, seemingly sensing his powerful Blood Qi. Even without orders from Qin Yu, it already opened its mouth and inhaled, causing a giant vortex to appear.

Before Long Chen could react, he was sucked into the Silver Wing Blood Falcon’s stomach. Long Chen’s disappearance then caused Yu Qingxuan and the others to cry out.

It happened so suddenly that even someone as powerful as Long Chen had no ability to resist. He was instantly devoured.

“Great heroic spirit, enjoy this top grade sacrificial offering!” shouted Qin Yu.

“A little Silver Wing Blood Falcon thinks it can devour true dragon essence blood? Are you not afraid of biting more than you can chew?”

Just then, Long Chen’s sinister voice rang out from within the Silver Wing Blood Falcon’s stomach. They then heard a roar that was like a god’s.

“Dragon King Battle Armor!”
