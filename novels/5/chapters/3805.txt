Chapter 3794 Big Business

This palace had over two hundred people enthusiastically chatting in it. When Long Chen and the others walked in, those people’s eyes instantly turned red. They openly wept and cried out.

“Boss!”Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

These people were all Dragonblood warriors. Long Chen practically couldn’t believe his eyes. Every single one of them was filled with emotion, afraid that this was a dream.

“Alright, alright, that’s about enough. Today is a great day of celebration for the Dragonblood Legion. I’ll be the host!” shouted Mo Nian.

Dozens of beautiful attendants walked in, bringing them to the highest level of the palace. This was a giant banquet hall.

This place was extremely luxurious. Even the carpets were made of the fur of demonic beasts that had reached the Divine Venerate realm. The pillars, the walls, they were made out of the highest grade materials. Just the air of luxury alone shook them.

The table was already covered in the finest delicacies. They were mostly delicacies that Long Chen had never seen before. From the bowls to even the utensils, they were all made of materials used for creating World Domain divine items. It was the epitome of elegance and luxury. Mo Nian had clearly gone all-out for this celebration.

“Brother, thank you,” said Long Chen emotionally.

“A minor matter. I reserved this entire palace. The reunion of your Dragonblood Legion requires a decent place,” chortled Mo Nian, pleased with himself.

“You reserved the entire palace? How much money was that?” Jiang Lei jumped in shock.

“It was nothing. One day is a hundred million immortal king crystals. For now, I’ve only booked it for a month. I reckoned that Long Chen, you would definitely arrive within a month. I left such an obvious signal and spread it everywhere. If you still didn’t notice it, hehe, then you would simply be too foolish,” laughed Mo Nian.

Long Chen blushed slightly. In the Violet Flame Heaven Capital, he had seen those people playing the drums and gongs, but he really hadn’t taken much note of them.

“It seems that you’re rich now? It just so happens that I can benefit from you.” Long Chen sat down without courtesy.

“Hehe, this is nothing. Brothers, today is the joyful reunion of the Dragonblood Legion. We have to properly drink!” Mo Nian raised his cup.

Everyone cheered, but Long Chen waved his hands first for everyone to put down their cups.

“If we’re going to drink, we have to drink the best.”

Long Chen then took out the Wine God Palace’s wine. As soon as he unsealed the jug, a strong wine scent made the Dragonblood warriors salivate. They were like locusts as soon as they smelled it.

“Damn, this is definitely the divine wine of the Wine God Palace! I won’t say anything else. I won’t ask for much. Just split me half, not one drop more!” Mo Nian also jumped up when he saw this wine.

Mo Nian was also fond of wine. He had gathered many fine wines during this time, but no matter how great those wines were, they simply could not compare to the Wine God Palace’s wine.

Mo Nian had once managed to find three jugs of the Wine God Palace’s wine in a tomb. Even so, he only got to drink half a jug before his master, the Immoral Daoist, stole the rest. Mo Nian directly turned hostile.

However, the Immoral Daoist was simply immoral. He drank it all, not leaving Mo Nian a single drop. Hence, now that he was seeing this wine again, he instantly lost his calm.

“A minor matter. Come, brother, let’s drink until we collapse to celebrate our reunion.” Long Chen directly tossed out hundreds of jugs. Everyone drank together.

The fine wine came out one bowl after another. These life-and-death brothers didn’t talk about their pasts or their hardships. For them, they could communicate with just a look. All that was left was to drain their bowls before filling them again.

They drank for a whole day and night. In the end, everyone else collapsed and slept on the ground. Only Long Chen and Mo Nian were still drinking.

However, they had also drunk so much that their tongues felt swollen. Even their words were slurring.

Both of them talked about their times in the immortal world. Mo Nian’s luck was good. After receiving the Immoral Daoist’s pointers, he quickly acclimated to the Limitless Palace’s cultivation technique, and his cultivation base rapidly advanced. Ever since he ascended, he hadn’t encountered a single person who was a match for him within the same realm.

However, he had his own troubles. The Immoral Daoist gave him three treasures: a pair of worn-down boots, a helmet, and a shovel. At first, he thought that he was being conned, but later he realized that these three things were priceless treasures.

These priceless treasures needed the death qi from tombs in order to grow. Fortunately, Mo Nian specialized in that on the Martial Heaven Continent. With his experience, he easily robbed tombs. As a fellow master, he quickly assimilated all the knowledge of his master.

However, the most vexing thing to Mo Nian was that his immoral master would pay him a visit every few days and then take away all the treasures that he had plundered.

None of his defenses worked. Even the things he hid in his astral space were taken by his immoral master. Every meeting resulted in him being looted, so Mo Nian had the urge to beat up this shameless old fellow.

However, the Immoral Daoist’s cultivation base still remained a mystery to him. No matter how quickly Mo Nian advanced, the Immoral Daoist was still far above him. Mo Nian had no choice but to be obedient.

This time, Mo Nian had just parted with the Immoral Daoist for a short time by escaping to the three thousand worlds and had already accumulated quite a bit. It could be said that Mo Nian’s work was the fastest way of gathering money. He had all kinds of treasures he had obtained from tombs.

However, thinking of how the Immoral Daoist was soon going to plunder all of them again, Mo Nian got angry. He booked this entire palace not just for face, but mostly because the Immoral Daoist would just plunder him again. Hence, he might as well just spend it all first.

As for when Mo Nian asked about what Long Chen had experienced, he found that his little bit of misfortune was practically a blessing compared to what Long Chen had gone through.

“Brother, I’m sure now. You are bound by bad luck. You end up running into every annoying thing possible.” Mo Nian touched cups with Long Chen and drank again. This was a toast of sympathy for Long Chen’s bad luck.

“I’ve long since gotten used to it. It’s fine. My luck isn’t all bad. At the very least, I got to meet so many friends. Big brother Xia Guhong, big brother Wu Tian, they’re peerless heroes. If we have a chance, I’ll definitely introduce you to them,” said Long Chen.

“I’ve heard of Xia Guhong. He is definitely a peerless hero. I want to meet him.” Mo Nian gave him a thumbs-up.

“Speaking of, have you found Liu Zongying?” asked Long Chen.

Mo Nian’s expression suddenly changed. Seeing this, Long Chen jumped in horror, but Mo Nian waved his hand. “Don’t misunderstand, she’s fine. I just haven’t found her yet. The irritating thing is that my immoral master has calculated where she is, but he refuses to tell me. I’ve crossed through various heavens, doing archaeology as I search for her, but I’m unable to find a single clue. Tell me, don’t you think that this bastard master of mine is maddening?”

“If I had such a bastard master, I’d definitely beat them up,” said Long Chen. He had drunk too much and immediately raised his fist in righteous indignation for this brother of his.

“Brother, remember that big business I mentioned to you before?” Mo Nian suddenly looked around and whispered to Long Chen.

Thunk.

Long Chen dropped his cup to the table.

“Are you planning to…?”
