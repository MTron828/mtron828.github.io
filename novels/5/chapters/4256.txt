Chapter 4245: Kill Until Rivers of Blood Flow

“Hahaha!”

Mo Nian waved the black dagger and laughed.

“You idiots. What Long Chen can do, I, Mo Nian, can also do. Yan Wuji, you shit-eating idiot, you fell for it!”

Yan Wuji had been pursuing Mo Nian the entire time. But after Xu Yifeng attacked Long Chen, he was startled and slowed down.

He didn’t realize that the moment Long Chen let go of the black dagger, an invisible figure brought it to Mo Nian.

Moreover, everyone’s attention was on Long Chen, not Mo Nian, which enabled Mo Nian to succeed with ease.

Another pillar of light was gone. This time, the entire martial stage grew unstable, shaking as if it might crumble at any moment.

Now, a lot of experts panicked. Three of the nine light pillars were already destroyed. When the first two had been shattered, the martial stage wasn’t affected at all. However, upon the destruction of the third pillar, the entire martial stage began to tremble. Even the very fabric of space grew increasingly unstable.

“They’re trying to drag us all with them! Kill them quick!”

“Kill them, or we’re the ones who are going to die!”

“If the martial stage explodes, none of us will survive! Stop watching and kill them!”

Countless people grew terrified and began to shout crazily. In their eyes, Long Chen and Mo Nian were trying to kill everyone.

“Long Chen and Mo Nian are the ringleaders, but they also have comrades! Don’t let them off! Kill all these evildoers together!”

This roar came from one of the human race’s factions. This faction’s experts then took out their weapons and pointed them at the Dragonblood warriors.

“Kill! Kill them all! Then Long Chen will be distracted!”

“That’s right, there are many of Long Chen’s women there! If he wants to kill us, then we’ll kill his loved ones!”

“Kill them! Tear them to pieces! Make Long Chen pay a bloody price!”

The experts of the human race, who were closest to the Dragonblood Legion, brandished their weapons, their faces twisted with fury.

“Idiots. Long Chen and I are saving you! If these pillars are not broken, the formation in the martial stage will turn into a blood ceremony, opening some unknown gates. Then everyone will die!” Mo Nian cursed those human experts.

“Scram, you grave-robbing bastard! Who would believe your lies?! Blood ceremony? Unknown gates? Your lies are getting more and more absurd! Do you think we’ll fall for your nonsensical tales? What we know is that you are destroying the martial stage, trying to get us all killed!” A vehement curse erupted from the human race’s side. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

“Kill!”

Just then, a furious roar rang out, as their anger and fear were all unleashed on Long Chen’s faction. Countless experts wielded their butcher’s blades and charged forth with murderous intent.

What infuriated the Dragonblood warriors the most was that some of these people were the ones whom they had saved on the staircase. However, those weaklings didn’t dare to actually attack, so they were shouting in the crowd.

“Boss ever said that weaklings can only cast their anger out on even weaker people. But the strong wield their blades against the strong. Whether it is in the human race, demon race, devil race, or others, this statement stands true. When reason cannot be discussed, you must use your fists. We live for slaughter; only slaughter will teach this world respect!” Guo Ran slowly raised his giant crossbow toward those experts.

“Brothers, use their blood to illuminate this world!”

Guo Ran’s crossbow unleashed a bolt of divine light that exploded amongst the closest experts. The next moment, blood flew everywhere as the curtains to an immense battle were opened.

“Kill!”

Guo Ran’s arrow was unable to stop them and only provoked their wrath even further, turning them into angry beasts.

“How satirical. The human race respects the devil race, the Ghost Dao, the demonic beasts, but doesn’t respect themselves. They don’t have the courage to fight other races, but will raise their butcher’s blades against other humans without mercy. Kill! Kill them until the heavens darken, until rivers of blood flow, until mountains of corpses form!” Gu Yang raised his spear, his eyes filled with fury.

He didn’t know why the human race had to kill each other, why they couldn’t trust themselves, why at this time, they would continue to fight amongst themselves. It was the peak of idiocy.

However, even if you had overwhelming intellect, such a thing could not be avoided. Right now, they could only resolve their problems with the most primitive, barbaric method.

When the opposing experts from the human race charged over, Gu Yang took the lead in confronting them head-on. As his Eternal spear let out a heaven-shaking cry, his Blood Qi ignited.

BOOM!

A Triple Supreme was directly blown apart along with his weapon in a single strike.

With his manifestation behind him, Gu Yang’s Blood Qi soared, and strange runes lit up all over his body. He looked as though he was possessed by a primordial beast.

Gu Yang’s spear was unstoppable, dealing fatal blows to anyone it struck. He effortlessly crushed multiple Triple Supremes with just one strike each, displaying his exceptional combat prowess.

BOOM!

Suddenly, Gu Yang’s spear struck another spear, and this blow caused the void to shatter.

Shockingly, this mysterious spear was another Eternal divine weapon. Both experts continued to clash fiercely, their spears locked in a deadly contest and their eyes locked onto each other, emanating a ferocious killing intent.

“Eternal clan, Zhao Qiankun. Remember this name, because you will die in my hands,” said that person coldly.

“Long Chen’s subordinate, first captain of the Dragonblood Legion, Gu Yang. You don’t need to remember my name. I’ve killed too many people, so I don’t require others to remember it.”

Gu Yang snorted and unleashed a burst of power. The two of them simultaneously withdrew, creating some distance between them. However, just as they separated, they swiftly converged once more, colliding like two shooting stars in a fierce clash.

This time, the collision became even more intense. The clash between two Eternal divine weapons sent shockwaves rippling through the outer Sage King Prefecture, causing it to tremble and quake.

The two retreated and crashed together again. With absolute confidence in their brute power, they didn’t bother to use flashy techniques, relying only on the simplest, purest form of strength to overpower the other side.

BOOM!

BOOM!

BOOM!

The repeated collisions sent shockwaves through the spectators’ hearts, inducing a throbbing pain in their heads. It felt like their heads might explode just from the sheer impact. After all, this was not only a clash between two people but also between two Eternal divine weapons.

“This Gu Yang really is powerful. Zhao Qiankun is the Eternal Zhao clan’s top heavenly genius, born with divine power and undefeated in battles. He’s even a candidate for the next clan leader. Yet, Gu Yang is able to fight him evenly!” A startled cry came from outside the martial stage. Zhao Qiankun’s reputation and power were well-known, while Gu Yang was just one of Long Chen’s subordinates. Hence, for him to be able to fight an expert like Zhao Qiankun on equal footing shocked countless people.

Not too far from them, Li Qi and Song Mingyuan also made their moves. Their opponents were also terrifying heavenly geniuses with their own Eternal divine weapons.

“Eternal Ye clan, Ye-”

At this moment, another expert from the Ye clan appeared. As three of the four captains had found opponents, this expert shot toward Yue Zifeng.

Yue Zifeng didn't wait for the individual to finish uttering his name. His sword directly sliced through the air, and blood sprayed forth. The voice of the Ye clan's expert abruptly ceased.
