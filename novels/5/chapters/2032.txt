Long Chen noticed that when the stone statues were fighting themselves, the runic swords would vanish. The beasts were clearly bound by a formation. As long as he destroyed one of the beasts, it would break the formation.

Long Chen repeatedly smashed one of the stone monsters. Normally, in the secular world, households with status would have two stone lions guarding them. But these two stone monsters had the bodies of lions, the wings of falcons, plus a horn and a tail each. Long Chen didn’t recognize what they were.

Long Chen struck the statue harder and harder. The entire palace was shuddering. Those experts that had entered a meditative state were startled awake, unable to stay in that state with this disturbance.

All those experts stared in shock. Had Long Chen gotten addicted to destroying things? Did he also want to destroy the Brahma Divine Palace?

BOOM!

Divine light exploded, and some kind of fragments flew through the air.

Those fragments were the rod that Long Chen had been using. It had exploded.

“Not good!”

Some of the fragments of that divine item flew toward them, piercing their bodies. One of the Corrupt experts was rather unlucky and was cut in two. Fortunately, it didn’t hit his head, or he’d have died.

Long Chen was crazy. Even his divine item couldn’t keep up with him, but Long Chen didn’t mind. That divine item had belonged to Man Batian, so he didn’t care about it.

These stone statues were extremely tough. Even the explosion of a divine item hadn’t harmed them. However, the one that Long Chen had been beating was damaged. Its divine runes had been broken, even though its actual body was still intact.

With its formation destroyed, its attacks came to a pause. Long Chen reached out to grab it.

“It’s so heavy!” Long Chen was shocked. Having seen that the monster’s feet were able to leave the ground, he knew that it wasn’t one with the stairs. But he actually wasn’t able to pick it up.

“Five Star Battle Armor!”

Only once he activated the Five Star Battle Armor did he barely manage to lift it into the air. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

“Get in here!” Long Chen immediately sucked it into the primal chaos space.

BOOM!

The entire primal chaos space shuddered as it thudded to the ground. Even Evilmoon and the Heaven Flipping Seal were startled.

“Heavenly Meteorite Stone!” Evilmoon let out a startled cry. It recognized the stone that the statue was made of. “Haha, this is good stuff!”

BOOM!

Just at that moment, the other stone statue was tossed in. Hearing that it was something good, the Heaven Flipping Seal flew toward it.

“Fool, get back!” shouted Evilmoon. But the Heaven Flipping Seal ended up touching the stone statue. Before it could even attempt absorbing its energy, it was sent flying by a terrifying power. Several cracks appeared on its body.

Evilmoon cursed, “You idiot, you can’t absorb it that way. Go absorb more energy. Once you recover, I’ll teach you how to handle it.”

The Heaven Flipping Seal obediently went back to the divine pillars like a chided child.

The experts outside were stunned. Their eyes almost popped out when they saw Long Chen actually take away the two stone statues.

After putting away the two stone statues, Long Chen turned to the rest of the palace. His attention was drawn towards the eighteen stone pillars in front of the palace. Those stone pillars were gigantic. They were what propped up the gates of the palace.

He was like an ant in front of them. He grabbed one of the pillars, but even with the Five Star Battle Armor, he wasn’t able to make the pillar budge in the slightest.

“I’m not even close. Even the Azure Dragon Battle Armor wouldn’t work.” Long Chen couldn’t help shaking his head.

If he could at least rattle the pillar with the Five Star Battle Armor, then he might try bringing out the Azure Dragon Battle Armor. But if he wasn’t even close, then there was no point in trying.

“Are you joking? Each one of these pillars is made of the Heavenly Meteorite Stone. They’re millions of times heavier than those stone statues. A single one of them is as heavy as a star. Don’t waste your time,” said Evilmoon.

“Ah? Then I can’t suck in this palace?” asked Long Chen.

“There’s no way to talk with you.” Evilmoon almost cursed him. “Those two stone statues were added later. But the rest of the palace was made by just one whole piece of Heavenly Meteorite Stone. For you to actually want to take it all away, your brain must not work.”

Hearing that, Long Chen immediately gave up. It seemed that this treasure had no destiny with him.

“Seeing a good treasure but not being able to take it away is so painful!” Long Chen sighed.

Evilmoon said, “I really look down on you. It was never yours in the first place, so what are you so pained for?”

As for the experts outside, seeing Long Chen trying to move that stone pillar but not being able to make it budge, they found it shocking and funny. So Long Chen really had been planning on destroying the entire palace.

Unable to take the pillars, Long Chen could only leave things like that. He walked toward the gates. The word Bahma appeared on top of the gates.

When that word appeared, divine power surged out, forming a golden praying mat beneath Long Chen’s feet.

“Heavens, he can actually get in?”

“Has he received the acknowledgement of the palace?”

“How is that possible?!”

Seeing that praying mat, everyone was stunned. Could the attack of the stone statues really have just been a test? Having passed the test, could Long Chen enter?

They felt like they were going crazy. How could Pill Valley’s rules be so messed up? Someone who destroyed everything they owned could be allowed to pass through so easily? Where was the logic in that?

“You want me to kowtow? Do you think you’re qualified?”

Killing intent appeared in Long Chen’s eyes. Perhaps to others, this was just some grace, but this was an insult to Long Chen. That feeling came from the pride within his soul.

Just as everyone was filled with envy that Long Chen could kowtow and be sent into the palace, Long Chen raised Evilmoon and slashed apart the praying mat.

“What?!” Jaws dropped. They couldn’t believe their eyes.

BOOM!

The praying mat transformed into runes. The sight of it shocked people. Long Chen had refused? Just what was he thinking?

“Do you think that you, Brahma, are so amazing? Would you even dare to accept my kowtow? I don’t need your approval to take what I want. I’ll take it myself,” sneered Long Chen.

In truth, Long Chen was intentionally releasing his fury. He wanted to awaken his other will and probe its secrets.

His actions seemed to have provoked the palace, and divine light condensed, transforming into a blinding sun. It was like the entire world was about to be crushed.

In front of that divine pressure, every expert outside involuntarily knelt on the ground. The rage of a god could not be blocked.

Long Chen’s divine ring shuddered. Long Chen didn’t take any action though. He simply allowed his body to react.

His 108,000 stars and the primal chaos bead shook. Some kind of energy slowly grew within them.

“This is the power of the primal chaos bead!” Long Chen focused closely on these changes. It seemed that this was a way to control the primal chaos bead. However, he didn’t have time to closely examine it before the world shuddered.

Long Chen’s will clashed with the pressure of the palace. The sky dimmed. It was like eternal night had descended.

However, while that darkness came suddenly, it also left quickly as if it had never been present. But for some reason, the palace’s terrifying divine pressure had vanished.

“Too bad it was too quick. I didn’t get to see how it worked.” Long Chen sighed inside. The primal chaos bead possessed terrifying power. It was his absolute treasure, but he had no idea how to use it.

Currently, all he could do with it was draw things into the primal chaos space and then suppress them. But when it came to living things, he would need to bring them in through his spiritual space first. The Scarlet Blood Spirit Fish had been brought in that way.

However, when fighting, could he possibly draw his enemies into his spiritual space? Was that any different than suicide?

Long Chen had been constantly thinking of ways to unleash the power of the primal chaos bead outside, and now he finally saw some hope. However, that feeling had faded too quickly for him to sense it.

The primal chaos bead seemed to have suppressed the Brahma Divine Palace’s divine pressure. Long Chen walked in and didn’t receive any more attacks. He pushed open the gates.

The gates were extremely heavy, and even when Long Chen was going all-out, they only slowly opened. They were thousands of meters thick, and his arms hurt from the effort. Finally, a crack appeared that he walked through.

As soon as he entered, the gates slammed shut.

The sound of the slamming shut startled those experts awake. Some of them flew over, wanting to enter as well.

However, the divine pressure that had previously been suppressed by the primal chaos bead once more flared.

“Not good!” Those experts’ expressions changed.
