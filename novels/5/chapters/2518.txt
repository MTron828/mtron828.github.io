Chapter 2508 Impending Crisis

Cloud’s huge body was blasting through the Heaven Devouring Black Armor Corps. She had already mastered all the divine abilities of the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow race. Her feathers had fully bloomed and she was unstoppable.

However, the numbers of the Heaven Devouring Black Armor Corps were too great. They still impacted her speed. Some of them managed to catch up from the rear, but they were wiped out by the Dragonblood Legion.

One of them was caught by Wilde. He took a bite out of its head, chewing half of its head with its helmet.

A moment later, Wilde spat it out. Everyone was speechless. The Black Armor Corps were essentially dead spirits. How could they be eaten?

“Mo Nian, let’s go on ahead. Everyone else, stick together and follow when you can,” shouted Long Chen.

After saying that, Long Chen and Mo Nian sped off. Mo Nian unleashed an arrow with the Heaven Swallowing Sun Hunting Bow, tearing a path through the Black Armor Corps. The two of them then sped down the path.

Even though their numbers were immense, they weren’t as many as the Corpse Devouring Armored Spiders. Before the gap closed, Mo Nian shot another arrow, keeping the path open. The two of them quickly passed through the barricade.

They quickly managed to see the battlefield ahead. Yun Tian’s sword was dancing through the air, his white robes fluttering. However, his robes now had blood spots on them. That fresh blood was like plum blossoms, appearing particularly conspicuous.

In front of Yun Tian was Zhao Ritian, Feng Fei, and the Pill Fairy. The only one missing was Ye Ming, and the three of them were blocking Yun Tian. Feng Fei’s divine sword and the Pill Fairy’s Daynight Furnace were blazing with divine light. They had actually taken a defensive posture.

As for Zhao Ritian, he had summoned a golden giant with a giant hammer. A powerful swing of this hammer showed that he had recovered to his peak state.

Zhao Ritian, Feng Fei, and the Pill Fairy’s auras were all in their peak state. Only Yun Tian’s aura had dropped.

Despite that, the three of them were in a defensive state. It seemed that they didn’t want to defeat Yun Tian. They simply wanted to trap him here.

“Which one do you want?” Long Chen asked Mo Nian.

“I’ll take Feng Fei. I’ve long since found her dislikeable,” said Mo Nian.

“Alright, then I’ll handle Zhao Ritian again.”

The two of them reached the battlefield. Long Chen immediately summoned his full power.

“Azure Dragon Battle Armor! Five Star Battle Armor!”

Long Chen’s divine ring burst into existence. This time, Long Chen didn’t need to slowly increase his power as he had gained full control of the power of the azure dragon. He entered the battlefield with a merciless slash of his saber.

“Zhao Ritian, I’ll cut off your perverted rod and see how you screw the heavens!” Long Chen’s roar was like thunder, with his attack arriving at the same time.

“Long Chen, we’ve been waiting for you for a long time!” Zhao Ritian sent his golden giant’s hammer smashing toward Long Chen.

“A loser also dares to say such big words? Today, I will definitely kill you!”

BOOM!

Zhao Ritian’s giant hammer was shattered. Evilmoon’s Saber Qi continued to blast the golden giant into pieces.

“Last time I was careless, but now I’ll definitely kill you, you arrogant bastard.” Zhao Ritian was infuriated to be called a loser. His defeat last time was his life’s greatest humiliation.

A rod appeared in Zhao Ritian’s hand, and he shot through the air. Endless golden mountains appeared within his manifestation, giving off divine light that flowed into his body.

The Heaven Suppressing Dragon Coiling Rod erupted with divine light. It emitted an immense pressure that it hadn’t possessed last time.

Last time, Zhao Ritian had been weakened and hadn’t been able to unleash the Heaven Suppressing Dragon Coiling Rod’s full power. Now that he was in peak condition, he was finally able to bring out its full potential. He wanted to wipe away his disgrace in one blow.

The world shuddered as the Heaven Suppressing Dragon Coiling Rod’s power continued to grow. It was like it was sucking in all the world’s energy.

BOOM!

The divine items smashed into each other, unleashing a huge qi wave. Despite this wild explosion of power, the giant tree whose crown they were under didn’t budge in the slightest. Not even the branches swayed.

Evilmoon and the Heaven Suppressing Dragon Coiling Rod pressed against each other, one blazing with divine light and one shrouded by black qi. Black and gold clashed.

In the distance, it was like beautiful fireworks were exploding. Arrows were flying through the air as Mo Nian fought Feng Fei.

Just like Long Chen, Mo Nian unleashed his full power from the start. The Heaven Swallowing Sun Hunting Bow’s runes were fully activated. He displayed the full power of his bow with every arrow.

In front of a Sovereign sprout, Mo Nian wasn’t the slightest bit careless. Every twang of his bowstring was like the explosion of a star. Every arrow he shot was a world-destroying blow.

As for Feng Fei, a vague image of a phoenix would appear within her sword-light. The phoenix filled the air with an ancient will that made a person’s soul quiver. Feng Fei was also using her full power.

“Big… brother Yun Tian, are you alright?” shouted Long Chen. Calling him big brother was a bit embarrassing though. After all, he called Sovereign Yun Shang big brother as well, so calling Yun Tian big brother felt a bit strange.

However, if he called him anything else, it would feel like they were distant, with no brotherly feel whatsoever.

“You came at the right time. I’m going to stop Ye Ming. He cannot be allowed to consume the Heaven Devouring Fiend King’s corpse spirit energy, or the Star Field Divine World will fall under his control,” said Yun Tian.

With a slash of his sword, he sent the Daynight Furnace flying. Just as he pushed through that opening, a heavenly diagram descended from the sky and enveloped him.

“Get through me first!” shouted the Pill Fairy coldly. She had actually taken out the Brahma Divine Diagram. She had brought both of Pill Valley’s priceless treasures.

Chanting filled the air as the Brahma Divine Diagram appeared. The world became illusory, and Yun Tian was sucked inside. At the same time, the Pill Fairy entered the world of the diagram with the Daynight Furnace.

Long Chen’s heart shook. The Brahma Divine Diagram was an extremely strange treasure. He had also been sucked inside of it before, but at that time, it had only been under the control of the vice master of Pill Valley’s Flame Divine Palace.

The power of the Brahma Divine Diagram depended on the power of its master. At that time, Long Chen had barely escaped. Now that it was under the control of a divine daughter, its power would be even greater. Long Chen wasn’t worried about Yun Tian being killed, as a Sovereign’s son wouldn’t die so easily. But Yun Tian’s words were worrisome. It seemed that Ye Ming was in the midst of doing something even more frightening. He had to be stopped.

Now that Yun Tian was trapped within the Brahma Divine Diagram, he was in a different world. There was no way for them to communicate. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“You dare to get distracted at this time? Long Chen, you really deserve death!” Just as Long Chen’s head was rapidly working, his arms shook. Zhao Ritian’s Heaven Suppressing Dragon Coiling Rod’s power rapidly grew.

In Zhao Ritian’s eyes, for Long Chen to actually dare to talk to Yun Tian during their fight indicated that Long Chen looked down on him. And this enraged him fully.

Golden light poured from his manifestation into the Heaven Suppressing Dragon Coiling Rod. Its divine light grew to a blinding level.

The Heaven Suppressing Dragon Coiling Rod was a terrifying divine item, and even Zhao Ritian could only unleash its potential in his peak state. Last time, he didn’t view Long Chen as a real opponent, resulting in him no longer possessing the power to fully activate it by the time he needed to.

This time, he was in peak condition. His manifestation power poured into it.

The pressure from the Heaven Suppressing Dragon Coiling Rod grew greater and greater. Seeing this, Long Chen roared, and an azure dragon appeared swimming above his scales. A dragon roar resounded through heaven and earth.

It was only once the image of the azure dragon appeared that the true power of the Azure Dragon Battle Armor was unleashed.

This image could not be summoned directly. It required the full circulation of his azure dragon essence blood.

“You’re the one who deserves death. You shameless idiots went four against one and still have the face to call yourselves Sovereign sprouts? What a joke. In my eyes, you’re like proud dogsh*t. Scram!” Long Chen’s voice suddenly resounded with the dragon roar. Evilmoon’s dragon marks lit up, unleashing a sinister and bloodthirsty aura that turned the world cold.

BOOM!

Golden light shattered as Zhao Ritian was blown back. He stared in shock. Even with his full power, he was still suppressed by Long Chen in terms of pure power.

“I really dislike people like you who view others as trash, as if the world lives for you. Who do you think you are?” Lightning wings appeared on Long Chen’s back. He vanished, appearing like a phantom before reappearing right in front of Zhao Ritian and hacking down his saber.

Golden light exploded. It was like a sun had been destroyed.

Long Chen’s hands trembled as he was blown back. As for Zhao Ritian, he wildly hacked up blood while holding the Heaven Suppressing Dragon Coiling Rod. When competing with pure power, he was instantly injured.

Evilmoon unleashed a sinister light. He was just about to press the attack when a tear appeared in the Brahma Divine Diagram. Yun Tian’s voice came from within.

“Long Chen, you have to kill Ye Ming quickly! He is beneath the tree. If you don’t kill him now, it will be too late!”
