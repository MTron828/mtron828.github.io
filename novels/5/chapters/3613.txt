Chapter 3602

Three hundred battleships of the Heavenly Dragon Divine Armor College flew through the air in the diamond formation. As a result, the Heavenly Dragon Domain’s experts raised their heads and pointed excitedly, their blood heating up.

“Is our Heavenly Dragon Divine Armor College finally starting to counterattack?”

Cheers rang out. Ever since the Alldevil Star-Field was sealed, the human race was forced into a passive state of defending. They had never taken the initiative to strike back.

The majority of the commoners had no idea what exactly was happening. Hence, the human race’s silence in the face of this assault left the commoners uneasy and afraid.

However, today, the Heavenly Dragon Divine Armor College’s battleships had no intention of hiding themselves. They flew out in confidence, giving off a wild and domineering air.

Although these commoners didn’t know what was happening, just based on this sight alone, they knew that the Heavenly Dragon Divine Armor College was preparing to counterattack for the first time. They would have a frontal clash with the Alldevil race.

As the battleships flew through the air, the commoners of the Heavenly Dragon Domain raised their arms and cheered them on as encouragement for the warriors of the Heavenly Dragon Divine Armor College.

Long Chen, Guo Ran, Xie Liuer, Leng Hui, and the others stood within the first battleship. Seeing countless commoners cheering them on emotionally, some of them felt so emotional that they wept. They felt their blood heating up.

“I never thought that I would see such a scene in this lifetime.”

Leng Hui’s voice was emotional as he saw endless figures cheering them on frantically. They cheered so loudly that they lost their voices, and yet they still cheered.

He was clenching his fists, his blood almost boiling within him. Even as one of the four heroes, he had never experienced such a feeling.

“A hero lifts the heavens up and envelops everyone within their heart. They will work until their dying breath for the people. The people have entrusted all their hopes to you. In their eyes, you are the heroes that will save all of them, the most glorious gods. In this world, there is a kind of responsibility that cannot be shirked without dishonor, there is a kind of relationship that shares trials and tribulations, and there is a kind of camaraderie that faces life and death together. Only once you have experienced the true baptism of blood and fire will you understand just how valuable life is. Only then will you understand what respect and gratitude are.” Long Chen looked down on the masses. Seeing countless emotional gazes, he sighed.

War was cruel. It was bloody, terrifying, and loathsome. But sometimes, fighting was the most important part of protecting the world and peace.

It was a very conflicting idea, but it was the reality. If people didn’t have an enemy to fight, they would start fighting amongst themselves. There would then be countless Wang Zixus, and there would be countless people silently dying to internal strife.

It was this kind of internal strife that caused the most damage to the human race. It was like toxic vermin constantly corroding the human race.

In order to survive when times of crisis came, the human race would quickly unite, and internal strife would vanish. The toxic vermin would then enter a state of slumber, and the human race would gradually grow stronger.

Long Chen had seen too much and had experienced a great deal. He wanted to advise everyone not to fight amongst themselves and join forces against their common enemies.

However, this was not a reasonable world. Even if you understood all the reasons and principles, there would always be ignorant people. You might have no other choice. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

Only when the whip struck your own body would you know pain. Only when the nail was stabbed into your body would you understand suffering. Only once you were lost and knew pain would you understand repentance. But when the pain vanished, you would return to your old state, powerless to change anything.

Looking at the endless figures below the flying boat, Long Chen felt many emotions. The human race was truly something that he loved and hated.

“I’m going to make a name for myself this time. People don’t need to remember my Leng family, but they have to remember my name, Leng Hui! I will not live beneath the light of my family! I will display my own light!” declared Leng Hui.

Disciples from illustrious families were followed by glowing prestige. That was their glory and the proof of their status. But that light was also suffocating.

After all, all their accomplishments and contributions belonged to their families. No matter what you did, people would think that your accomplishments were only thanks to your family. No matter how hard you worked, your merits would not be counted as your own, but as your family’s.

Whether it was Leng Hui or Xie Liuer, they had a dream to have their own accomplishments, ones that surpassed their ancestors’. Their light would then eclipse their families’ light, and their families would shine because of them.

Long Chen’s words caused their blood to burn passionately. They had to grasp this chance to fight. They would unleash all their power for the human race.

“Dean Guo Ran truly has farsightedness. Our Heavenly Dragon Divine Armor College is moving out in force first. As the first ones, we are the example that everyone will follow. When we win the war, our Heavenly Dragon Divine Armor College will definitely be considered the number one hero.” Xie Liuer looked at Guo Ran and praised him.

“Are you mocking me? Are you doing that on purpose?” said Guo Ran a bit unhappily.

“What?” Xie Liuer was dumbfounded. Was her boot-licking not good?

Guo Ran irritably said, “What farsightedness? I’m just listening to my boss. I’m only carrying out orders.”

Xie Liuer was embarrassed. She had actually thought that this was Guo Ran’s decision. Now that she praised Guo Ran for it, it did sound a bit satirical.

“Then is there still enough time for me to praise boss Long Chen?” Xie Liuer bitterly smiled.

Long Chen shook his head. “There is no farsightedness on my part. This is all the old dean’s arrangements, and we are only carrying out his plan. He has paved the path for us, and now we just have to walk down it. This battle will be our opening battle, the opening act. So, we cannot just win. We must win beautifully. We must put on such a show that the rest of the human race is won over. That will allow our Heavenly Dragon Divine Armor College to lead this war.”

Leng Hui, Xie Liuer, and the others nodded. The position of the leader of this war was very important. The human race in the current Alldevil Star-Field was like a plate of scattered sand. They had to be united to win this war, but the leader had to have the necessary power to gain the trust and approval of the rest of the humans.

“All battleships hear my orders, enter combat state!”

Long Chen suddenly shouted. After that, countless runes lit up on the battleships, and the grand formations were all activated to their maximum power. Clear Rain City could already be seen far in the distance.

When they got closer, they saw mountains of corpses piled atop the walls. They almost drowned Clear Rain City. Moreover, the grand formation of the city was filled with holes, looking like it might collapse at any moment.

“Bastards! Clear Rain City sent an urgent request for aid to all the major powers of the human race! How is it that no one else is here?!” Guo Ran was enraged when he saw no other reinforcements outside or inside the city.

Leng Hui and Xie Liuer were also enraged. It had to be known that they had first gathered their troops and prepared the battleships for a large battle before moving out. They had taken a bit more time, so the other reinforcements should have gotten here first.

But they didn’t see a single other person that had come to help. If they had arrived any later, the millions and millions of commoners inside the city would have been annihilated.

“Warriors of the Heavenly Dragon Divine Armor College, slaughter every last one of our enemies! Use their blood to play the overture of the human race’s counterattack!”

Following Long Chen’s shout, the three hundred battleships charged straight into the core of the battlefield.

Divine light shot out of the battleships, blasting apart the devil beasts. After that, blood mist filled the world.

“Leave! It’s a trap!”

The city lord of Clear Rain City was covered in blood fighting inside the city, and seeing those battleships, rather than feeling the slightest joy, he roared furiously.

When the battleships reached the core, the surrounding space collapsed and spatial gates opened like the eyes of fiends, covering this entire world. Their enemies had long since set up a heaven-encompassing net here.

“We know it’s a trap, but we came anyway. Brothers, if you want to be powerful warriors, your chance has come!” Upon seeing the endless devil beast army pouring out of those spatial gates, Long Chen’s battle intent instantly ignited.

“Kill!”

Guo Ran’s blood was boiling. He took the lead, his Devil Dragon Battle Armor appearing around him. Wielding Dragonbone Evilmoon, he charged out first.
