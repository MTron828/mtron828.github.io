Chapter 3383 Underworld-Nether War

That enormous entity flew right over Long Chen and the others’ heads. It smashed a huge hole into the ground where it landed.

Long Chen saw that it was a leopard whose spots were like black clouds. It was as big as a mountain.

Its head had been smashed in as if something had struck it. It then struggled in pain a few times after it landed on the ground before dying.

“Underworld Cloud Dark Tiger race?”

Leng Yueyan was startled. This Underworld Cloud Dark Tiger race was quite a famous race in the Netherworld. They had branches throughout the Netherworld.

They were considered one of the ten strongest beast races in the Netherworld and possessed supreme authority. No one dared to challenge them. Anyone who did so would have the Netherworld’s millions of beast races set upon them. Moreover, anyone that had previously provoked the Underworld Cloud Dark Tiger race had essentially been wiped out. They were quite domineering and possessive.

Originally, Ming Cangyue had thought that it was just a normal fight between Nether Beasts. But seeing that one side was the illustrious Underworld Cloud Dark Tiger, she sensed that things weren’t as simple as she had hoped.

Long Chen reached out and tossed the Underworld Cloud Dark Tiger into the primal chaos space before continuing to creep forward. When they climbed up a tall mountain, a terrifying scene entered their eyes.

Countless winged humanoid lifeforms were fighting a crazy battle against the Underworld Cloud Dark Tiger race. There were corpses as far as the eye could see. Those humanoid lifeforms were even bigger than the Underworld Cloud Dark Tigers and wielded huge clubs. With every swing of their clubs, the void was torn apart. Any Underworld Cloud Dark Tigers struck had their bones broken.

At the core of the battlefield, those winged giants had clearly taken the advantage. They had surrounded and were besieging a group of Underworld Cloud Dark Tigers. The Underworld Cloud Dark Tigers were clearly weaker and unable to stop them. They were constantly killed one by one, and it seemed that the battle was already reaching its end.

“Nether Blood Giant race! They are battling the Underworld Cloud Dark Tiger race? Furthermore, it seems that they are intent on wiping them out. Is another Underworld-Nether War starting?” said Ming Cangyue in shock.𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

“What is an Underworld-Nether War?” asked Long Chen.

“Ah, the Netherworld has millions of races, but at the roots of all of them, they can be split into two factions. One is the Underworld race, and the other is the Nether race. The bloodlines between the two are different, and they have viewed each other as enemies for countless years. It is unknown just how many Underworld-Nether Wars sparked throughout history. However, ultimately, both sides remained evenly matched. After both sides are ground down and wounded, the war ends and they go home to rest. Once they get strong again, they once more start a war as if they’ll never get tired of it. There’s essentially no way to resolve the conflict between the two sides. When they fight, they fight to wipe out the other side. It doesn’t matter who attacks who. They will wipe out the other side entirely. They won’t have any mercy,” explained Ming Cangyue.

Only then did Long Chen learn that the Netherworld actually had such a story within it.

“However, we don’t need to worry. Whether it’s the Underworld race or the Nether race, they don’t have any direct conflicts with us. Our Nethergod race doesn’t have any conflicting interests with them. As long as we don’t join their battle, they won’t make things hard on us,” said Ming Cangyue, relaxing quite a bit.

“Hehe, that’s good. Once they leave, I’ll clean up the battlefield.” Long Chen smiled. Such a good thing had finally come for him. His luck had taken a turn for the better.

He had reached the twelfth Heavenstage of the Four Peak realm and would quickly reach the Divine Lord realm. Then he could condense the Violet Tower Star. Those corpses should allow the Devil Eye Water Lilies to reach the fourth tier, and then he could start refining Violet Tower Pills.

Thinking of when he would condense the Seven Star Battle Armor, Long Chen felt a burning anticipation. The Six Star Battle Armor had followed him from the mortal world all the way to now in the immortal world. It was as sharp as ever.

However, he could clearly sense that the power it gave him was starting to lag behind. It was still as sharp as ever, it was simply that his 108,000 stars had changed.

Due to igniting the divine flames and possessing the new Golden Dragon Battle Armor, it could be said that the boat had risen with the tide, but the boat had not grown.

Once he condensed the Seven Star Battle Armor, Long Chen was sure that the boat would instantly become a giant ship. It would be able to soar above the starry sea of 108,000 stars. At that time, he would truly have grown tough wings.

Leng Yueyan and Ming Cangyue naturally didn’t join in the fight. Just watching was excellent. There were no buildings or constructions nearby, meaning that there were no gods in the surroundings. Otherwise, the gods would probably already be allied with the Underworld Cloud Dark Tiger race.

After all, the support of the Underworld Cloud Dark Tiger race would make it so that an ordinary person wouldn’t dare to touch them. This was further proof that no other gods had discovered this land. That was a good thing for Long Chen and the others.

Furious roars continued to shake the heavens, but Long Chen quietly watched. Seeing the endless corpses, he almost started drooling.

Other than Leng Yueyan and Ming Cangyue, Long Chen didn’t have any good feelings about the Netherworld. The Netherworld had once invaded the immortal world and could be considered the immortal world’s enemy. Moreover, a fellow from the Netherworld had also fought Long Chen for the Heavenly Rainbow Flame.

He asked Leng Yueyan and Ming Cangyue how it was possible for the Netherworld’s lifeforms to enter the immortal world. Their answer was that they could only cross in places where the wall between the Netherworld and the immortal world was weak. When the spatial energy was at its weakest, it was possible to force open a channel. However, opening that channel required a huge amount of resources and also required the backer of someone on the level of a World King.

Furthermore, such a channel was unstable. Only lower level cultivators could pass through. There was a realm and power restriction, so stronger people were unable to pass through those small channels. Otherwise, they would cause the entire channel to crumble. Everyone within it would then be sucked into the chaotic flow of space.

Long Chen had been hoping that the two of them could open a path for him as well. Then he would be able to return to the immortal world. But it seemed that this wasn’t possible.

It seemed that if he wanted to return to the immortal world now, his only option would be to enter the chaotic flow of space again. But the exits were not stable. What if he was stuck inside for centuries without running into a place where space happened to be collapsing in a good spot?

He didn’t want to use that method. But after he obtained that mysterious broken sword, he felt that there was hope. He just still hadn’t figured out how to use it best.

Moreover, he also didn’t want to part with the two of them. The two of them depended on the Netherworld to live. Because of this, Long Chen was unable to relax considering that they were threatened by many things, so he was still waiting.

After two hours, the battle ended. All the Underworld Cloud Dark Tigers were slain, and those giants gathered, seemingly counting their numbers. They then gathered the corpses of their people and prepared to leave.

However, when they flew up, one of them spotted Long Chen and the others. It was originally just a random glance that meant nothing. However, that fellow then took a second look at Long Chen and suddenly pointed at him. Shouting, all the giants suddenly charged over at them and instantly surrounded them.
