Chapter 3656

People couldn’t believe their ears, especially the experts from the Spirit Rune Pavilion. The pavilion master was already dead. Was Xia Chen still not willing to let the Spirit Rune Pavilion off?

“Xia Chen, we are willing to worship you as pavilion master! But you can’t share the sacred treasure that our ancestors left behind with the public. That… that really is unbearable!” One of the Spirit Rune Pavilion’s elders couldn’t help stepping forward.

“That’s right. You’re our new pavilion master. Everything here is yours, so there’s no need to do this!” cried out another elder.

To them, what was important wasn’t who the pavilion master was. What was important was that the giant tree known as the Spirit Rune Pavilion didn’t collapse.

It had to be known that if the Spirit Rune Pavilion’s sacred land was opened to the public, tens of thousands of ancient talismans and tomes would be lost. The talismans of the desolate era were priceless treasures left behind by their ancestors, so how could they be shared with the public?

This proposal of Xia Chen’s moved the hearts of the other sects. However, they didn’t dare to randomly speak here.

The Spirit Rune Pavilion’s sacred land had been locked for countless years. That was why, while they did desire it, they had never thought of obtaining this ancient inheritance.

Ever since the gate to the sacred land was opened, these powers started forming a good relationship with the Spirit Rune Pavilion. Their goal was obvious.

The fact that the Spirit Rune Pavilion had opened their holy land practically set it in stone that they would rise to the top of the Heavenly Talisman Star-Field. It was only a matter of time. If these sects sucked up to them now, they would still be in time. Hopefully, their sects wouldn’t eventually be erased due to not having a good relationship with this future overlord.

This was also why Gongsun Xuan and Gongsun Ziyi had chosen to use this occasion to make a move on Xia Chen. They had been hoping to use these people to deal with him together. After all, it was a chance for them to show their loyalty. However, nothing went as they had hoped. This particular scheme had ended before even starting.

In any case, these people truly were moved by the thought of obtaining the treasures within the sacred land.

“In truth, there’s no need for junior brother Xia Chen to do this. All talisman cultivators are a family. If there’s anything that one doesn’t understand, everyone can study it together. Opening up the secrets of the Spirit Rune Pavilion does seem a bit inappropriate,” said a half-step Divine Venerate.

“After all, the Spirit Rune Pavilion possesses the most ancient inheritance of the Heavenly Talisman Star-Field. It needs its own solid foundation,” said another elder.

All of them were courteous. They were clearly saying that they wouldn’t be so greedy. They didn’t want to offend the Spirit Rune Pavilion.

Just sharing a few talismans would be more than enough. Their goal was to get some soup while the Spirit Rune Pavilion took the meat.

On the other hand, the expressions of the experts from weaker sects weren’t very good. If this happened, they probably wouldn’t get any benefits. Let alone soup, they wouldn’t even get to lick the bottom of the bowl.

In the end, it was power that counted. People like them didn’t even have the right to interject. They could only endure.

However, they were all surprised when Xia Chen said, “Well, I came to the Spirit Rune Pavilion only to learn. My goal has always been to follow my boss. Even if this grandfather and granddaughter duo didn’t die today, I wouldn’t be staying here. Also, when I said that there won’t be a Spirit Rune Pavilion after today, it isn’t because of my enmity with the two of them. It is because the Spirit Rune Pavilion’s existence is a disgrace for the Heavenly Talisman Star-Field.”

“Ah?”

Everyone looked at each other, not knowing what Xia Chen was saying. Just how was the Spirit Rune Pavilion a disgrace?

“When I opened the sacred land’s gate, I saw a record left behind by a senior. That senior had sealed himself in the sacred land right before his death. His physical body remained, but he had no head. When I read what he left behind, I learned that he had no face to see future generations so he intentionally destroyed his head…”

When Xia Chen opened the gate to the sacred land, he saw a corpse and a sealed suicide note. The note recorded the origin of this sacred land.

The truth was that in that ancient battle, every sect had participated. Back then, the Spirit Rune Pavilion was actually only a third-rate sect. If they only didn’t join the others in that battle, that would be one thing. But they actually took advantage of the chaos to sneak into some other sects and steal their secrets.

Those sects that they stole from were essentially all third-rate sects as well. They didn’t dare to go to second-rate sects.

The battle from back then was truly apocalyptic. Although the human race won in the end, it was a miserable victory. The supreme sects and experts fought to the death and were wiped out.

Even amongst other sects, less than one percent of their inheritance remained. The line of talisman cultivators then received a heavy blow and never managed to recover from the loss. As for the Spirit Rune Pavilion, due to not participating in the battle and sneaking in some benefits, they managed to preserve quite a bit of their power.

At that time, the pavilion master hid all the treasures that he had stolen. Those treasures could not see the light of day in that era. Otherwise, others would all know what the Spirit Rune Pavilion had done.

Thus, those secret treasures were passed down one era after another, and they still didn’t dare to take them out. The secret of these treasures was passed down from pavilion master to pavilion master only. At the time of the seventh generation pavilion master, the seventh generation pavilion master made a heavy decision.

He directly sealed himself and all the treasures inside, placing a talisman on the gate that was almost impossible to decode. That was the origin of the sacred land.

That seventh generation pavilion master viewed the actions of his ancestors as a disgrace. Hence, he sealed himself inside in wait for a destined person to expose the truth. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

As the pavilion master, he didn’t have the courage to reveal the truth himself. But continuing to keep the secret was something that his conscience would not allow him to do. Ultimately, he made such a decision, leaving everything to future generations.

When they heard this explanation, the Spirit Rune Pavilion’s experts were dismayed. They couldn’t believe that their ancestors would do such a horrible thing.

It was everyone’s first time hearing that the Spirit Rune Pavilion actually possessed such a dirty history.

So much time had passed, so they didn’t know how they should judge the Spirit Rune Pavilion’s ancestors. They were cowards who feared death, but it was due to them that these ancient inheritances were preserved. However, to say that this was an accomplishment would only cause people to look at them with scorn for their methods.

“These treasures are the collective wisdom of our ancestors, so it should be shared amongst all talisman cultivators. According to the seventh generation pavilion master’s will, when these ancient tomes see the light of day once more, they should be shared with everyone to atone for the sins of the Spirit Rune Pavilion. Hence, I will act according to the seventh generation pavilion master’s will. This learning will be shared with everyone who wishes to learn. Perhaps that is the only way for the Spirit Rune Pavilion to apologize for their crimes. Other than that, the reason I said that the Spirit Rune Pavilion is gone after today is because I don’t want the disciples and elders to carry the sins of their ancestors. Thus, the Spirit Rune Pavilion is hereby disbanded. Everyone can find new homes.”

After saying that, countless people were delighted. Whether it was to Xia Chen or the seventh generation pavilion master, they were filled with gratitude. Such magnanimity was admirable.

“Let’s go. We’ll take a look at the sacred land together.” Xia Chen led everyone to a hidden location.
