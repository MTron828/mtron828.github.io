Chapter 3095 Qin Feng Vs. Chu Zhen

“Crap. Chu Zhen is a Primal.” Luo Xue’s expression changed. She looked at Qin Feng and hesitated.

She wanted to tell him to just abandon the match. But she knew that he was a very prideful existence. If she actually said something, Qin Feng would probably be too prideful to give up.

Long Chen also couldn’t help frowning. Qin Feng’s luck was really bad. However, it was already the third round of eliminations, so there were only a few people left. Encountering a Primal was unavoidable.

Long Chen looked at him. “How many moves?”

Qin Feng hesitated. “I suppose ten.”

Long Chen shook his head. “That’s too many. At most, five. If you cannot slay him in five moves, you will no longer have a chance.”

“What?”

Lu Mingxuan and the others were stunned. Rather than advising Qin Feng to give up, Long Chen was telling him to win within five moves? Win against a Primal? How was that possible?

Just at that moment, Qin Feng’s tablet began flashing. He smiled slightly. “Boss, I’m going.”

After that, Qin Feng vanished, appearing on the martial stage. He was actually amongst the first.

“Long Chen, you actually sent him to fight Chu Zhen. Your heart really is big.” Luo Ning couldn’t help shaking her head.

Long Chen said, “Don’t judge a person’s power by the cultivation base that you see. That’s very dangerous. Just watch, and you will see what a true battle is. A warrior that has gone through the baptism of blood and fire is definitely not what you imagine.”

Luo Bing and the others couldn’t help being curious. It seemed that Long Chen had just as much confidence in Qin Feng as Qin Feng had in Long Chen.

Just at this moment, the opponent arrived. Unexpectedly, Chu Zhen’s appearance was rather startling.

Chu Yang and Chu Kuang might have been very hateful, but their looks had been above average. On the other hand, Chu Zhen’s face was particularly long, like a donkey’s face. His forehead was both flat and pointed, and even his jaw was pointed.

It gave people an urge to find a hammer and smash his head a few times to flatten it a bit.

Other than that, he had a long scar on his face that was perfectly placed so that with another slash of a blade, there would be a perfect X scar on his face.

“Your father and mother really were lazy. Why not put in the work instead of doing it half-heartedly? I really don’t get the point of that scar.” Lu Mingxuan muttered to herself.

Luo Bing and the others didn’t know what she was saying, but considering her character, they understood that she was always dirty.

“It’s probably that the blade went too deep during the Cesarean section,” said Long Chen casually. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

This sudden turn caught them off guard, and a few chuckles escaped Bai Shishi and the others.

“It’s too bad that they can’t hear you on the martial stage, or just that would be enough to make Chu Zhen die of anger. Then Qin Feng could easily win,” said Luo Xue.

“Shh, they’re talking.” Luo Bing pointed.

When Chu Zhen appeared, he smiled slightly at Qin Feng. “Little fellow, I heard that you are Long Chen’s subordinate? Then today is the day of your death.”

Every single movement within Silver Moon City was under the eyes of the hosts. The Chu family was enemies with the academy, and so they naturally sent people to keep an eye on Long Chen and the others. Investigating this newcomer, Qin Feng, was simple.

“Please don’t smile. It’s really ugly. To use my boss’s words, when your parents birthed you, did they make a mistake? Did they lose the baby and end up raising the placenta?” asked Qin Feng.

Lu Mingxuan burst into laughter, lacking the slightest image of a lady. Luo Ning also laughed until she cried.

“Brother San… Did you really say such a thing?” asked Mu Qingyun, also laughing.

Long Chen was speechless. He had cursed so many people in this lifetime, how could he remember them all? This fellow Qin Feng, why did he have to drag him into this?

Chu Zhen’s long face instantly twisted with killing intent. “Brat, I’ll make sure you suffer first.”

Just at this moment, their block began to flash, indicating that battle was imminent. Divine light then flowed out of Chu Zhen’s sinister smile. He was like a tiger pondering how to torture his prey.

Qin Feng took a deep breath and closed his eyes. He then grasped his saber on his back. At this moment, blood-colored marks began to appear on his body. They seemed like scales.

As the barrier between them disappeared, Chu Zhen instantly vanished, reappearing right in front of Qin Feng.

“So fast!” Luo Bing and the others were shocked by this speed. At some point, a red claw casing had appeared on his hand. Even through the martial stage, they could sense its sharpness.

Those claws unleashed flame energy as they tore through the air, looking as if they would ignite the void.

Long Chen narrowed his eyes. Those flames had Lord Brahma’s aura. As expected, the Chu family’s people were Lord Brahma’s dogs. All their cultivation techniques were related to him.

This once more proved his guess that the Chu family’s resurgence was thanks to Lord Brahma’s support.

The instant Chu Zhen’s sharp attack fell, Qin Feng’s saber also slashed through the air. It wasn’t aimed at the claws but at Chu Zhen’s waist. As the saber slashed through the air, a faint dragon cry could be heard that shook the entire stage.

Chu Zhen’s expression changed. He had originally been planning on capturing Qin Feng in an instant and making him beg for life and then eventually beg for death.

He had been unable to sense any threat from him. But the instant that this attack came, his hair stood on end. A sensation of mortal danger caused him to feel a chill.

Originally, he had thought that his protective layer of divine light should be enough. That would show Qin Feng just how miniscule he was in comparison. But he was shocked to find that there was no way this protective divine light could stop Qin Feng’s attack. If it landed, he would be cut in two.

BOOM!

Chu Zhen managed to block Qin Feng’s saber with his claws. Sparks flew and the martial stage shuddered.

At that moment, Qin Feng’s Blood Qi unfurled and the marks on his body grew brighter.

“Dragon Blood Battle Armor!”

Qin Feng roared and his aura transformed, becoming wild, domineering, and bloodthirsty. In that instant, he seemed to become a different person, causing everyone to jump in shock.
