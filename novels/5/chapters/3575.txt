Chapter 3564

“Many thanks for saving my life, senior!”

Long Chen hastily rose. Although he had fallen unconscious at that time, his spiritual perception was still active.

After fainting, he could still recall a bit of what had happened. He knew that Xia Guhong had saved him. He also knew that this was a terrifying existence with an incredible background.

“There’s no need for such courteous words between us. In that battle, you severely overdrafted your soul. It seems that you need to properly rest for a while.” Xia Guhong handed Long Chen a bowl of wine.

Long Chen drank it and was startled. Xia Guhong laughed. “This is soul nourishing wine and was made by a junior apprentice-sister. I’m not capable of making such a gentle wine.”

As soon as the wine entered Long Chen’s throat, it spread throughout his body, forming a current that slowly entered his mind-sea.

His mind-sea was filled with countless cracks, as if it was about to shatter. The damage to his soul far surpassed the injuries to his body in terms of severeness.

While using the Starry Sea Births Violet Qi manifestation, his Spiritual Strength was rapidly used up. When he drew the astral energy in particular, that was like trying to control a wild horse. It also required immense power to control, or if he had lost control, that terrifying power would have caused his own body to explode.

It was Long Chen’s first time controlling such energy. If it weren’t for his powerful Spiritual Strength, there would have been no way he could have controlled it.

As the wine’s energy entered his mind-sea, his soul repaired at a speed visible to Long Chen’s eye. This wine was gentle but powerful. It was far better than the soul nourishing pills that Long Chen had refined for himself.

Long Chen sighed in admiration. The Wine God Palace’s experts were truly unfathomable existences. This was truly a land of hidden dragons and crouching tigers.

After Long Chen finished the wine, Xia Guhong poured him another bowl. Long Chen was embarrassed to have Xia Guhong doing this for him and tried to do it himself, but Xia Guhong stopped him.

“Looking at you, I seem to see myself as a youth. Someone full of spirit, someone with no restrictions. It really is good to be young!” Xia Guhong sighed with a hint of reminiscence in his eyes.

“Senior…”

“What senior? It sounds so formal. Cultivators live for countless years, and seniority means little. You can call me big brother Guhong,” said Xia Guhong.

Upon hearing this, Long Chen’s heart warmed. Several figures appeared in his mind at this time.

“What? You think that I am old?” Seeing Long Chen fall into deep thought, Xia Guhong smiled.

“No. Big brother Guhong, you suddenly remind me of some other big brothers. They were just as heroic as you. They were true men that raised the heavens,” said Long Chen hastily.

“Oh? For you to call them true men that raised the heavens, I really want to meet them,” said Xia Guhong, instantly interested.

Long Chen’s eyes reddened slightly. “Regretfully, they will never have a chance to meet big brother Guhong.”

Xia Guhong reminded him of Yun Shang, Qing Xu, Mo Li, Zi Yang… the Sovereigns of the Martial Heaven Continent. Every time Long Chen thought of them, he felt great reverence, as well as sadness over their loss.

When Xia Guhong asked about it, Long Chen gave him a simple story about the Sovereigns and what they had done for the Martial Heaven Continent. Xia Guhong couldn’t help being moved.

“What a shame, a true pity. In the immortal world’s nine heavens and ten lands, I’ve seen endless heavenly geniuses and heroes. But other than junior brother, no one else is able to enter my eyes. They would have as well, but they’ve long since turned to dust. Supreme heroes can only appear one at a time in this world. They don’t even have an equal to drink with. What a shame!” Xia Guhong sighed, clearly feeling respect for the Sovereigns as well.

Long Chen always felt that the five Sovereigns were supreme, incredibly talented, and wise. They created their own unique techniques and had stood at the peak of the continent since forever. Those were true peerless heavenly geniuses. Compared to them, he was nothing more than mediocre.

Long Chen had comprehended many things from the five Sovereigns. Even in the immortal world, he had never met an existence that could stand alongside them. The five Sovereigns were still supreme in his heart.

Whether it was in terms of cultivation base, aptitude, comprehension ability, wisdom, or feelings, they were flawlessly perfect. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

A little Martial Heaven Continent had produced five supreme Sovereigns. As for Long Chen, in all his time in the immortal world, it didn’t matter what a person’s cultivation base or status was, they were still lacking that kind of nobleness that came from a Sovereign.

“Big brother Guhong, there’s no need to feel sad. Once my Dragonblood Legion gathers, there will be plenty of people that can accompany you drinking. I don’t mind saying that every single person in my Dragonblood Legion is a true man,” said Long Chen comfortingly.

“Good. Then I’ll wait for your good news. Bring your brothers to the Wine God Palace. Big brother doesn’t have anything else, but the wine definitely won’t be lacking.” Xia Guhong laughed heroically.

Long Chen and Xia Guhong drank dozens of bowls of wine, both feeling especially delighted. However, Xia Guhong only drank his own wine, while Long Chen couldn’t drink that wine due to his injuries.

As they drank, Long Chen talked about his Dragonblood Legion. Drinking and talking, they were getting along swimmingly.

“Big brother Guhong, don’t just listen to me talk. Tell me about yourself. Tell junior brother your story,” said Long Chen, raising his bowl to him.

“Me?”

Xia Guhong came to a pause. It was as if he was sinking back into his memories. Maybe he was tidying his thoughts, trying to think of where to start.

However, after a long while, Xia Guhong shook his head. “No, there’s nothing to tell. I’ve forgotten many things. Brother, you’ve drunk about enough. Any more won’t benefit your injuries. You should rest. I still have some wine to brew, so I’ll go take a look.”

Xia Guhong rose and left, leaving Long Chen stunned. Watching him leave, Long Chen felt an indescribable feeling.

“As a youth, you don’t know the flavor of worry, but still say that you’re worried to appear mature. But now that you know the flavor of worry, you say that the cold chill is a sign of a good autumn.”

Long Chen looked at the wine in his bowl ruefully. Xia Guhong was an era’s monarch, an overlord who had left his name on history. He must have gone through an unknown number of storms in his life.

However, when Long Chen asked about his past, it seemed to have touched on something in his heart, leaving him in no mood to drink.

“No one can live a perfect life. Even the monarch of a nation, a mighty Divine Venerate, still has things that don’t go as he wishes.”

Long Chen didn’t have much of an understanding of Xia Guhong, but all the discussions that had gone on about Xia Guhong’s origins back in the Dragon Blaze Prefecture were heard by Long Chen. This was a supreme expert with his own story. But it seemed that he didn’t wish to talk about his past.

Perhaps whenever he thought about his past, the pain was greater than the joy. True experts would not complain to others. They would only silently endure their suffering.

Long Chen finished the wine in his bowl. After that, his mind sank into the primal chaos space, and he saw a scene that he didn’t dare to believe.
