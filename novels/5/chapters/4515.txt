Chapter 4504 Peerless Assassin

The translucent figure emanated an icy presence, causing everyone to feel as if they had been thrust into an icehouse, freezing their very souls. Even their minds grew sluggish.

Luo Bing and Luo Ning, in particular, were profoundly affected. It seemed as if their blood had stopped flowing.

“Not bad. No wonder Di Qing died. But your bloodline sets your fate in stone,” said the translucent figure before completely vanishing.

“You must be Ying Tian. If you possess the ability, I’d like you to see my fate!”

Long Chen snorted and suddenly twisted through the air, just in time to dodge a strange sword that sliced through the air. It looked identical to the previous Lifehunter expert’s sword. However, this sword’s aura was countless times stronger.

The moment the sword cleaved through the air, it tore the very void and disrupted the Heavenly Dao runes around it, revealing a giant tear that could hardly be mended by the Heavenly Daos.

This sword possessed terrifying destructive power that surpassed the scope of an ordinary Saint weapon. Even just a simple slice from it unleashed such devastation.

“You are fast. But can you dodge the next one?”

BOOM!

Long Chen’s seven-color sword shot out, piercing the void. However, it missed the target. Within that broken space, a blurry figure could vaguely be seen.

Long Chen’s attack was actually off, startling him. This fellow was far stronger than the one that Long Chen had slain, and he was almost impossible to sense. Even the Nine Star Hegemon Body Art’s senses faltered in gauging his presence.

Previously, back in the High Firmament Academy, Long Chen could pinpoint the Lifehunter expert’s location due to the blood staining the Lifehunter expert’s sword. However, facing this terrifying assassin, Long Chen didn’t dare to let that sword get close to him, understanding the peril it posed to his life.

The two had not really exchanged blows. However, this fellow sent shivers down Long Chen’s spine.

Long Chen launched a series of relentless attacks, causing the void to repeatedly erupt. However, the majority of his strikes failed to find their mark. In fleeting moments amidst the destroyed space, he could only see some blurry figures.

“You’re too slow, and your perception isn’t sharp enough. It seems that I overestimated you,” sneered that figure.

Hearing this, Long Chen maintained an unwavering expression, but his gaze grew sharper. He knew that his opponent was trying to provoke him and make him lose his cool.

In battles against assassins, maintaining a calm demeanor was crucial, akin to a strategic game of chess—one wrong move and there would be no way to turn the tables.

Power only mattered if you could execute your moves well. On the other hand, a sharp mind, accurate judgment, unwavering resolve, and calm demeanor held greater importance in this case.

Although the old man did say that schemes were useless in front of absolute power, if the power levels were on par, the assaults of an assassin became nearly unstoppable.

After all, assassins possessed the innate ability to discern weaknesses in their opponent’s moves, and the truly outstanding ones could even create some openings out of nothing.

Long Chen had asked whether or not this person was Ying Tian, but the latter didn’t reply. This deliberate non-response was also a form of mental attack, and whoever could apply greater pressure to the other side held the upper hand.

Since this person didn’t admit to being Ying Tian, Long Chen also couldn’t be certain. In the absence of a clear identity, an ordinary expert might inadvertently be careless and reveal an opening.

A sharp sword silently thrust toward Long Chen’s back, but Long Chen ignored it and swung the Seven Peak Sword in front of him.

BOOM!

Amidst the eruption of the void, another sword materialized in front of Long Chen. The attack from behind him was actually a feint, and the real decisive blow came from the front.

The feint convincingly mimicked the characteristics of a real strike, capturing the right aura, pressure, and resonant sound. It was so well-made that it could deceive anyone. Within the Dragonblood Legion, other than Long Chen and Yue Zifeng, everyone else had fallen for it.

Long Chen’s slash destroyed the space in front of him, causing that translucent figure to retreat. He was as quick as lightning, giving no time for Long Chen to launch consecutive attacks.Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

The most frightening thing about assassins was that they wouldn’t let you unleash your full power. Many powerful experts had met their end at the hands of assassins with ostensibly weaker strength.

Everyone knew that assassins were capable of killing people across realms. That was because they would always grasp their target’s weaknesses first. Once identified, the battle would essentially be over.

Despite his attacks not landing at all, Long Chen was still calm, devoid of any trace of panic. Only by maintaining his calm could he prevent his opponent from finding an opening.

Otherwise, once his heart fell into disorder, his senses would no longer be as sharp. Faced with his opponent’s peerless assassination arts, such a lapse could spell the end of everything.

Just then, a sword materialized on Long Chen’s left, accompanied by another one on his right. The dual assault approached from distinct angles, both striking with almost identical speeds.

When these two swords emerged, Long Chen’s Seven Peak Sword vanished. In its place, a flame lotus manifested in his left hand, while a lightning sphere crackled to life in his right.

“This is what I was waiting for!” Long Chen exclaimed. Simultaneously, flames and lightning erupted. Two translucent figures materialized this time, surprising onlookers with the realization that these two attacks originated from two different individuals; it wasn’t a matter of one being fake and the other real. Had Long Chen attempted to block them as before, it could have proven fatal.

Lightning and flames mixed, turning this world into a flame sea heavenly tribulation domain. Now, those two figures had nowhere to go.

Lightning and flame runes were glued to those two figures, leaving them with nowhere to hide. The runes seemed to embed themselves in the translucent forms, as if they had taken root within the very essence of the figures.

Just then, two pretty maidens charged out of the lightning and flames, attacking both of those figures.

As for Long Chen, he shot toward Huo Linger’s side. Forming quick hand seals, he ignited his seven-color Supreme Blood, and millions of Seven Peak Swords appeared behind him.

“Now where are you going to run? Supreme Blood Ignition, Ten Thousand Swords Fly!” Long Chen roared. In response, millions of swords coalesced into an unending sea of blades, engulfing his targets and leaving them with no opportunity to retaliate.
