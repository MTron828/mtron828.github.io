Chapter 3673 Unmatched

Liao Bencang’s sword unleashed a wave of sword-light that covered all three of them. Long Chen felt the space behind him freeze and actually shove him forward.

Long Chen’s divine ring rumbled. Under that powerful force, his seven-color divine ring exploded and turned into a six-color divine ring.

His expression instantly changed. It wasn’t that his divine ring was unable to bear this attack, but the moment Liao Bencang attacked, the world’s energy disappeared around him. The power of heaven and earth was no longer enough to maintain the seven-color divine ring.

Moreover, it wasn’t just Long Chen who experienced this. Guo Ran and Xia Chen’s expressions also changed. This world was now Liao Bencang’s domain. He was an omnipotent god here.

Liao Bencang didn’t give them much time to consider this. His sword fell and the world quivered. Even combining forces, the three of them were blown back. Xia Chen then coughed up blood.

Xia Chen’s talismans required the spiritual qi of heaven and earth to use. Only then would they be able to unleash their maximum power. Hence, within Liao Bencang’s faith energy domain, his talismans were greatly affected.

“Split the Heavens 3!”

Long Chen was appalled. The seven-color divine ring had been reduced to the six-color divine ring. His power was also rapidly diminishing. This faith energy was gradually shrinking the amount of Heavenly Dao energy that he could absorb.

In fact, within this domain covered by the net of faith energy, he wasn’t able to even draw in astral energy. At this moment, all he could do was stake everything in a single blow.

A giant saber-image rose like a tempest as Long Chen instantly started off with his strongest attack. If he didn’t go all-out now, he would have no chance to do so in a bit. He would only grow weaker and weaker in this domain.

Guo Ran also realized the same thing and raised his black saber. His Supreme Bone glowed. Just like Long Chen, he used the third form of Split the Heavens.

As for Xia Chen, even as blood was leaking out of his mouth, he didn’t tarry. After forming hand seals, eighteen talismans converged, shining brightly and forming a blood-soaked phoenix. It flew toward Liao Bencang with an ominous air.

Liao Bencang snorted. “Ignorant brats, I’ll show you the difference between us! Nine Underworld Heavenly Edict Slash!”

His sword quivered. After that, the giant lotus beneath his feet suddenly appeared behind him. It glowed and merged into his sword before he slashed it at the three of them.

BOOM!

All the attacks crashed into each other. As a result, the void splintered and divine light exploded. Long Chen, Guo Ran, and Xia Chen were all blown back.

Long Chen hacked up blood. He was at the front and endured the greatest impact. As for Guo Ran, he was next and was also blown back. Luckily, Xia Chen was slightly better. He was further away and had time to react. He wasn’t injured this time.

At the same time as Long Chen coughed up blood, Liao Bencang coughed up blood as well. The sword composed of faith energy shattered and the faith lotus was also gone.

After the clash, Long Chen stabilized himself in the air as quickly as he could. Putting away the Minghong Saber, he extended his hands. Flame energy then exploded out of his left hand, and lightning runes thundered out of his right arm. Following that, the sound of lightning and fire crashing together resounded throughout heaven and earth.

“Double Dragon Destruction!”

A lightning dragon and a flame dragon twisted around each other and tore through the world straight toward Liao Bencang.

This attack contained Lei Linger and Huo Linger’s full powers. Now that their powers were perfectly matched, they formed a resonance, perfectly working together to unleash the maximum power of this attack.

Wherever the double dragons passed, the world collapsed. A giant spatial tear formed in this domain. They arrived in front of Liao Bencang in an instant.

Liao Bencang hadn’t expected Long Chen to be able to unleash such a terrifying attack so quickly. Although he had managed to block their attacks, he was injured as a result and had yet to recover from the impact.

This attack from Long Chen wasn’t his own power, but Lei Linger and Huo Linger’s full powers. Hence, he just needed to use his Spiritual Strength to balance their powers, allowing him to unleash the attack quickly.

BOOM!

Liao Bencang was struck head-on by the Double Dragon Destruction. His body exploded. As for the Double Dragon Destruction, it continued onward and struck the giant net. After that, the net quivered and this net that not even the mysterious dagger had managed to break actually became covered in countless cracks.

This attack’s area of effect was enormous. If it had been concentrated into a single point, it should be enough to directly blast a hole in the net at least a dozen meters wide.

Just as Guo Ran and Xia Chen were about to cheer over their victory, faith energy flew through the air. They were in the form of millions of lotuses and suddenly converged into Liao Bencang’s body once more. Also, he wasn’t the slightest bit injured.

Guo Ran and Xia Chen were stunned. Such a terrifying attack hadn’t injured him in the slightest? Did Liao Bencang possess an undying body?

“Fools. This is nothing more than an avatar. As long as there is faith energy, I cannot be killed. This is my absolute power. Now, do you idiots know the meaning of despair?” Liao Bencang sneered at the stunned Xia Chen and Guo Ran.

Xia Chen and Guo Ran were truly horrified. They had never come into contact with faith energy. This power was practically unrivaled.

“Idiot, the main reason you are capable of suppressing us is due to the realm difference. If we became Immortal Kings and condensed a Heavenly Dao Crown, then even under your faith energy suppression, the three of us could beat you like a dog,” retorted Long Chen.

Although those two attacks were unable to cause substantial damage to Liao Bencang, Long Chen could see through some of the essences of faith energy.

Faith energy was not unrivaled. After those attacks, Liao Bencang’s faith energy had clearly plummeted. The exhaustion was astonishing.

Other than that, Long Chen also realized that the giant lotus was actually Liao Bencang’s World King Divine Radiance.

The World King Divine Radiance was something that could only be manifested in the mid stage World King realm. Furthermore, not all World Kings were capable of doing so. It was a kind of recognition from the Heavenly Daos. It was the crown of the Heavenly Daos, the halo that appeared behind the heads of World Kings. It was a symbol of their status.

In the same vein, when heavenly geniuses advanced to the Immortal King realm, they would also condense a halo. But it was not called the World King Divine Radiance; it was called a Heavenly Dao Crown. However, only a Heaven tier Immortal King could condense it.

Long Chen had not spotted Liao Bencang’s World King Divine Radiance this entire time. Now, he finally understood that Liao Bencang had merged his World King Divine Radiance with his faith energy.

If the three of them became Immortal Kings and condensed Heavenly Dao Crowns, the suppression would definitely not be so bad.

“Then if my true body were to descend, I would only need a single finger to kill all three of you. Your words are meaningless. You can just die,” Liao Bencang sneered. His body suddenly shook, and he shot at Long Chen. However, in that instant, Long Chen mysteriously vanished. When he reappeared, he was by the giant net.

Just as Long Chen vanished, Guo Ran came flying in. His Supreme Bone glowed as he punched Liao Bencang.

“Scram!”

For some reason, seeing Long Chen run away gave Liao Bencang a bad feeling. He then slashed at Guo Ran with his sword, and Guo Ran was sent flying back, coughing up blood.

However, what shocked him was that Guo Ran was blown back in a strange direction. He actually arced toward Long Chen.

“Liao Bencang, let us meet again. Next time, I’ll take your head.”

Long Chen shut his right eye. In an instant, his left eye turned pitch black, and a sinister energy erupted. The Purgatory Eyes were activated.
