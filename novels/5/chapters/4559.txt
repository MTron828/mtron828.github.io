Chapter 4548 Rest In Peace

No longer holding back, Feng You spread her wings, and flames burst out of her. Even though a lot of experts filled the battlefield, Feng You was like a crane amongst chickens, standing out among all of them.

The mixed beast race’s experts were frightening to behold, so the people around them hastily fled, leaving them alone.

As a result, the mixed beast race’s experts passed through the crowd like a hot knife through butter. They all roared, their fighting spirits fully igniting.

For countless years, the others had treated them like dirty mutants, rejecting their existence. So, as they scared away all of those powerful races, they felt like they were unleashing all the years of resentment.

In truth, these factions were retreating mainly due to Feng You’s frightening aura. They were unwilling to clash with such a terrifying expert right at the beginning, as they would just take hideous losses before things even started.

After all, there was still quite some time until the gates opened. If they got gravely injured here, let alone being in the first batch of experts to enter, perhaps they would just meet their end on this chaotic battlefield.

Now, the mixed beast race was in high spirits. Their warriors had arrived with the determination to fight to the death. Some had not come to enter the Fantasy Spirit World but to display their bravery in front of the countless races of the world, to demonstrate that the mixed beast race was not to be underestimated or bullied.

As a result, all the races here knew that they weren’t a good target to provoke. They had to think twice before provoking the mixed beast race.

As the mixed beast race advanced, Long Chen sat on the back of the half-horse expert, holding his crossbow. Any time one of their people was in danger, he would use a single arrow to resolve it.

Long Chen was now manifesting Guo Ran’s character. In any case, he felt some joy while doing so, especially when he killed the enemies without them knowing. Their lost and regretful gazes brought him a particular sense of accomplishment—the joy of conning people to death.

“To ascend to the heavens, one must have morals. How can you be willing to toss your comrades’ corpses into the wilderness? Fine, dust to dust, earth to earth. It’s up to me to be a good person and let them rest in peace.”

Long Chen sanctimoniously started to gather the corpses on the ground. Many people didn’t even know if they would survive to leave this world, so they couldn’t be bothered to take their people’s corpses. In fact, some of them intentionally let Long Chen into their territory so that he could clean it up.

As a result, Long Chen almost shouted with joy. Corpses of various races entered his pocket, and he didn’t discriminate. They all landed on the primal chaos space’s black soil.

Long Chen’s earth energy wasn’t particularly strong, but he didn’t have a problem gathering the corpses on the ground. The corpses rapidly vanished, devoured by the primal chaos space.

The black soil had devoured countless bodies now, so its devouring ability had become truly terrifying.

Also, these corpses were mostly World Kings. Although some were powerful Heavenly Doyens, they were not taxing for the black soil to devour, nothing more than a snack for the primal chaos space.

In a bit, life energy rapidly spread throughout the primal chaos space, prompting all the vegetation to grow crazily.

Although these corpses were not from Saints, those who could come here were elites amongst elites, so their bodies also unleashed a shocking amount of life energy.

Long Chen was unable to contain his smile. Silently gaining wealth was truly amazing.

The mixed beast race continued onward, but in two hours, their progress slowed down because the people ahead of them were getting stronger and stronger.

At this time, Long Chen could vaguely see two giant gates. Although they were still far away, he could sense terrifying spatial fluctuations from them.

“It seems that those are the entrances to the Fantasy Spirit World and Void Spirit World.” Long Chen’s heart heated up. He knew that the Dragonblood warriors were advancing to the Void Spirit World.

Long Chen wanted to fly out right now and gather with them. However, he didn’t dare to do so, as even a Sage King wouldn’t dare to fly over the heads of so many powerful heavenly geniuses.

Anyone who did so would become a live target, practically asking to be killed. In this chaotic battlefield, a single person’s power was minuscule, so they had to rely on an army to survive.

As the mixed beast race advanced, they reached a group of people wearing blood-colored robes. Their sleeves and collars had special marks on them to represent their sect.

When these people appeared in front of the mixed beast race, they slowed down, and one of the experts of the mixed beast race called out, “Friends of the human race, can you-”

He had yet to finish speaking when one of those experts swung his sword, almost beheading him.

Fortunately, just as the sword slashed down, an arrow pierced that expert’s chest, reducing most of his power. Otherwise, the person from the mixed beast race would have been cut in half.

The mixed beast race’s people seethed with anger. Due to being with Long Chen all this time, they had dropped their guard against the human race and would rather not barge through with brute force. At the very least, they had to give Long Chen some face. However, the other side didn't think that way. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

“On the battlefield, other than yourself, everyone else is an enemy. If courtesy mattered, would the mixed beast race have fallen to this state?” shouted Long Chen.

This shout was the warning they needed. Without any further misgivings, they roared and charged forward.

“Foolish mixed beast race, who gave you the guts to offend my Blood Gauze Sect? Kill them all!”

After that, a sinister sneer rang out, and the crowd parted. Long Chen was slightly surprised to see four humans with auras on par with Yan Baichen.

“Kill that woman!”

The four of them immediately targeted Feng You, as they thought that she was the only threat. Not caring about any rules, they swung their weapons toward her.

Even one against four, Feng You slammed her spear forward and forced all of them back. To their surprise, their combined attack was unable to injure Feng You.

“Capture the weakling!”

One of them shouted and actually abandoned Feng You to charge at Long Chen.

“Fuck, you dare to treat me like this?!”

“Long Chen!” Feng You’s expression changed. She immediately charged over to save him, but the remaining three experts blocked her together.

“Die!”

At this time, the fourth expert reached Long Chen, but just as he raised his weapon, his vision darkened.

Pow!

A large hand slammed into his face, sending that person flying like a shooting star, with his blood flying everywhere. Seeing this scene, everyone fell silent.
