Chapter 2476 Azure Dragon Seal

The rune on Long Chen’s forehead slowly faded. Long Chen felt as if something new had appeared in his memories.

Long Chen slowly extended a hand. Lines had appeared within one of the scales on his palm.

When he clenched his fist, space shuddered and rumbled. Just by clenching his fist, ripples appeared in the void.

“This is…!” Long Chen was startled and delighted. He looked at the rune on his palm with disbelief.

“The Azure Dragon Seal? I didn’t expect you to awaken this divine ability,” said the elder.

“Is this move very amazing?” asked Long Chen excitedly.

“This Azure Dragon Seal… amongst the adult true dragon race’s thirty divine abilities… it is the weakest,” said the elder hesitantly.

“What? I feel like it’s very powerful!” Long Chen looked at his hands. The power from the upgraded scale made him feel like he could tear apart the void. How could this be the weakest?

“To the true dragon race, the Azure Dragon Seal is the least useful technique. It is sometimes used to strengthen one part of the body. But the true dragon race’s physical body is incomparably powerful, so this technique is meaningless. It is the weakest in defensive power and killing power… Cough, you wouldn’t be feeling bad about me saying these things, right?” The elder seemed embarrassed to say these things.

“No, it’s not your fault. It might be meaningless to the dragon race, but it’s useful to me. I’m not a true dragon, so I can strengthen my body with this. I’ll be able to take on divine items with my bare hands now. My strongest fighting style is close range, so this Azure Dragon Seal is perfect for me,” said Long Chen with a laugh.

“Alright, I was feeling pity for you, but now it seems that you like this technique. I won’t mention the other world-destroying divine abilities of the true dragon race. This attitude of yours is truly good. Just how many cultivators could achieve this kind of calm? No wonder that-” The elder suddenly shut his mouth.

Long Chen didn’t notice this oddity. He said, “My luck has always been bad, so if I didn’t have a way to comfort myself, I’d have probably killed myself a long time ago. I’m used to it. Senior, are you the dragon king? I feel like this dragon nest’s growth and birth seems to reflect the growth of the entire cosmos. Can you let me see how the Ten Thousand Dragon Nest was created?” The principles behind the Ten Thousand Dragon Nest were related to the essence of the universe.

The elder stared at Long Chen and suddenly laughed. “Everyone who comes here comes in search of treasure, but none of them realizes what the true treasure is. Congratulations, you are the first one capable of seeing so deeply.”

Long Chen probed, “Senior, are you about to say something along the lines of but, however, unfortunately, and such?”

“Hahaha!” The elder laughed heartily before saying, “However, unfortunately, this treasure isn’t something that can be given. It can only be comprehended by oneself. This is a true Grand Dao, something that cannot be transmitted through the mouth, nor can it be written down. The secrets of the universe are seen differently by everyone.”

“Alright. I don’t really get it, but it sounds pretty amazing. Since I can’t have it for now, I won’t think about it,” said Long Chen. He knew that he wouldn’t have good enough luck to obtain such a treasure. If someone as powerful as this unimaginably strong dragon king refused to tell him, then he had to have his reasons. Perhaps even he didn’t dare to break some taboos.

“Is the one down in the dragon source that’s absorbing my energy your friend?” asked the elder suddenly.

“Ah, you must be talking about Evilmoon. Yes, that’s my life and death partner,” said Long Chen.

“Are you sure? It used to be someone stronger than me. By absorbing the energy of the dragon source, it is weakening Yun Shang’s seal. The dark evil dragon race is the most bloodthirsty, most violent, and most evil of the evil dragons. I still have some power and can stop it if you wish. Otherwise, once Yun Shang’s seal is broken, the first one it will devour is you,” warned the elder.

“No, I trust it completely. Evilmoon will not betray me. It’s not just my weapon or a gambling chip. I trust Evilmoon with my life. Senior, please allow it to absorb whatever it wants,” said Long Chen.

Although Evilmoon was wicked, for some reason, Long Chen sometimes formed a resonance with it. Perhaps he himself was also wicked, making them a perfect match. Birds of a feather flock together? He didn’t know, but he refused to believe that Evilmoon would betray him.

What he didn’t know was that his conversation with this elder was being heard word for word by Evilmoon.

“What a fool.” Evilmoon sighed. Now it understood why Yun Shang had left it to Long Chen.

It found that it was being infected by Long Chen’s feelings. An existence who had never had feelings to move was finally moved. The word partner had felt completely foreign to it before.

The elder nodded. “Then I won’t bother it. Let’s talk about the Azure Dragon Seal. It is a dragon blood rune that can enter an offensive and defensive state. When you clenched your fist, it was in an offensive state, but you still haven't gained control over its essentials. It is different from the human race’s magical arts. There is nothing about the cooperation between the heart, mind, and soul. Due to being the most basic divine ability, it also has no hand seals. It only requires the correct application of your essence blood.”

The elder raised a finger and touched Long Chen’s shoulder.

Just like that, Long Chen’s shoulder was pierced. Blood splattered, and the pain startled Long Chen. “Senior, you…”

Despite his current state with the Azure Dragon Battle Armor, this elder casually injured him without him being able to resist. If the elder wanted to kill him, wouldn’t he be dead in one blow?

The elder pointed at his wound, and only when Long Chen looked closely did he see runes appear on the dragon scales around the wound. Those runes were healing his wound without him circulating his life energy. In just a few seconds, the wound healed.

“Do you see? The rune is the same, but the color is different. The red rune represents offense, while green represents defense. If you were part of the dragon race, you wouldn’t need to actively defend. Your dragon blood would automatically switch from offense to defense to block this attack. However, you haven’t nurtured the reactions of your dragon blood, causing it to be too slow. It should have instantly healed, but instead took this long. If you want to control this technique, you’ll need to work hard on controlling your essence blood. Here, attack me now with your most proficient technique,” said the elder.

With almost no hesitation, Long Chen unleashed a slap. It was only once his hand was moving that he realized this was wrong, and he hastily switched it to a claw toward the elder’s chest.

Long Chen’s movements were extremely fast, but the elder easily caught Long Chen’s wrist. He instantly felt like his wrist had been caught by a steel lock. He found himself unable to use the slightest bit of power.

Long Chen was startled by this. Was this the power of a dragon king? No, the dragon king had lost his physical body and was nothing more than a strand of soul essence. How could he possess such power? Just how strong had he been before?

“Your movements were incorrect. For humans, it is correct for the will to move first. But the dragon race uses brute power. Our fighting style is violent and domineering. It is direct with the goal being to crush all opposition. As long as you are strong enough, it doesn’t matter what technique you use. Even a fart can make an army collapse. If you aren’t strong enough, then no matter what technique you use, it’s just a monkey’s play. You won’t be able to resonate with your dragon blood if you fight like this. Without the power of your dragon blood supporting you, the rune will become weak. Try again. This time, don’t use your spiritual yuan or soul energy. Forget about them. Use only brute power. That is the power of the physical body,” said the elder, pushing Long Chen back several steps. His gaze became sharp like a strict teacher.

Long Chen gratefully nodded. He took a deep breath and clenched his fists. His essence blood flowed within his body rapidly, rumbling. A rune lit up on his fist.

Just as Long Chen began to accumulate power, his essence blood began to boil, and power burst through his veins like a volcano exploding. At this moment, Long Chen experienced what it meant for his dragon blood to resonate with the Azure Dragon Seal. He easily condensed all his power into his fist.

With a shout, Long Chen smashed his fist at the elder. The void collapsed, as if unable to bear this power.

The elder exploded. The space that they were in vanished, and the red essence stone appeared in front of him.

“Senior!” Long Chen let out a startled cry.

However, no one replied. It was like everything had been a dream. Long Chen stared at the essence blood stone in front of him.

Eventually, Long Chen bowed deeply toward the essence blood stone and took it. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

Upon touching it, he felt a close connection to it. He knew that the dragon king had inserted the essence blood within the stone into his body, resulting in this connection.

Long Chen realized that its power had weakened immensely. He estimated that the elder had inserted at least half of its power into his body.

Within the blood pool, all the essence blood of the dragons prostrated toward him. It was as if he had become the dragon king.

Long Chen formed a hand seal, sucking the blood pool and the essence blood stone into the primal chaos space.

After that, Long Chen returned to the entrance. When he passed through the barrier, he once more appeared beneath the reverse scale of the dragon king’s corpse.

He had only just appeared when countless sharp arrows shot toward him.
