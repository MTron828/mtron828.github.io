Chapter 3571

BOOM!

Long Chen’s slap sent that black-armored elder tumbling back. The immense force shattered his helmet, revealing an old face that was a bloody mess.

Long Chen’s slap contained shocking power and great skill as well. He had struck the man in the small crack of his helmet, which was why it was destroyed.

The battle armors here were all very well made. That helmet was made of several pieces that could be meticulously controlled.

When fighting, it was possible to cover the entire head or expose it entirely. Long Chen had taken advantage of this trait to shatter that helmet. It was precise and vicious.

At this moment, the elder coughed up blood, and his teeth sprayed through the air. He then struck the other black-armored experts behind him, knocking them away. The entire scene became chaotic.

“Enter the city!”

Long Chen shouted and grabbed Tu Hu beside him, flying over to the city. The others immediately controlled the battleships to follow behind him.

By the time the black-armored elder stabilized himself, Long Chen and the others were already right in front of the city. The city’s experts immediately activated the formation to draw them in.

“Bastard!”

The black-robed elder was ashen with rage upon seeing them enter the city. Their entire plan was now in ruins.

“Should we directly attack and completely wipe them out?” suggested another black-armored expert.

BOOM!

As a result, the elder directly punched that person in the head. Sparks flew, and with a grunt, that person was sent flying.

“Are you an idiot?! What did we work so hard to set up this trap for?! Grow a brain!” The elder had nowhere else to unleash his anger, so that unlucky fellow became his target.

That fellow didn’t get up even after a long time, and the people beside him were too afraid to help him. They just foolishly stood there, not making a sound for fear of facing a similar fate.

“Something unexpected happened. It seems that this person isn’t a native expert? Did someone from the outside world get in?” said another person. This person was also a World King, and his voice sounded rather old.

The black-armored elder shook his head. “It should not be possible. So many experts of the Alldevil race are guarding the channel. Not even a fly could get through.”

“Although those Alldevil fellows are strong, their heads aren’t very good. It is still possible for someone to slip through in a moment of carelessness. We should send some people to confirm. If a large number of experts get through the channel, things won’t be so simple,” said that person.

The black-armored elder sank into thought. “Fine, send someone to ask. The Alldevil race really isn’t reliable.”

“And what about our side? Should we change the plan? We’re already exposed and they won’t fall for it again. In that case, perhaps we should directly…” That person looked at the city and made a throat-cutting gesture.

The black-armored elder shook his head. “It’s no good. Anyway, even if we’re exposed, it’s not that important. Surround them. I refuse to believe that they will abandon everyone in this city. Even if they know the danger, they will still take the risk to send them some goods. We’ve only exposed a fraction of our forces. Even if they come with ten times what they did this time, we can still devour them.”

With that, no one else spoke. They just looked toward the city. For some reason, they felt waves of unease when they looked at that black-robed man. This youngster made them feel afraid.

…

“Many thanks for saving my life.”

Once they were in the city, with countless experts around, Tu Hu took off his armor and thanked Long Chen respectfully.

The others also took off their armor, looking at Long Chen. If it hadn’t been for Long Chen, they would have died out there. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

That black-armored elder would have definitely killed them in the most brutal, humiliating fashion in order to grind away the morale of the people in the city. Hence, every single one of them was grateful to Long Chen.

However, what shocked them was that this black-robed man that had saved them was nothing more than a mid stage Divine Lord. Yet, he was able to destroy the armor of a World King with a slap. It was truly beyond their imagination.

“I want to ask you, is the Guo Ran you mentioned about this tall, with a single hairline like this? He also has a small gourd-shaped birthmark on the back of his left hand…” said Long Chen.

“Yes, yes, yes! Big brother, you know senior apprentice-brother Guo Ran?” Tu Hu cried out excitedly. The others who had come with him looked at Long Chen with astonishment.

“Yes, I know him. I’m very familiar with him.” Long Chen smiled. How could he not know Guo Ran?

When they learned that Long Chen knew Guo Ran, Tu Hu and the others instantly grew friendlier. After all, although Long Chen had saved them, they still had to be on guard against him.

Through their explanation, Long Chen learned that Guo Ran had managed to do quite well for himself inside the Heavenly Dragon Divine Armor College. In just over a year, he went from an ordinary disciple to a Heaven Master.

His powerful talent in forging shone brightly, and he became one of the four heroes of the Heavenly Dragon Divine Armor College, having countless worshippers. He was very famous even within the entire Alldevil Star-Field as a whole.

“Big brother, are you not a native to the Alldevil Star-Field?” asked one of the disciples.

“Correct, I’m from another star-field. I broke through their barricade to come here. I was originally planning on saving just one person and conveniently picking up some wealth, but I didn’t expect to have such an unexpected gain. There’s no need to question my identity. I have no malice toward any of you,” said Long Chen.

That person blushed. Although Long Chen said that he knew Guo Ran, how could they trust him just like that? If he was with their enemies and was intentionally tricking them to gain their trust, they might be doomed.

However, just who was Long Chen? It was impossible for him to not know what they were thinking. In order to prevent them from beating around the bush, he got straight to the point.

“My apologies for our rudeness. For a hero like you to descend upon my Clear Rain City, please hurry in and rest. This isn’t the place to talk.” A late stage World King that had been standing to the side the entire time finally had a chance to interject.

Tu Hu also felt bad. For them to just be standing on top of the city walls and talking was truly awkward. It was more like an interrogation.

“Big brother, please come in. That’s right, I still haven’t asked for your name yet,” said Tu Hu.

“Long Chen.”

“What!?”

When they heard Long Chen’s name, everyone from the Heavenly Dragon Divine Armor College jumped, their jaws dropping. They stared at Long Chen in disbelief.
