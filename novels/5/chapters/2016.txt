Long Chen left, leaving behind countless spectators who were still dazed. This Man Batian was absolutely vicious.

As for Xiong Tianba, he was infuriated. He couldn’t stop his bleeding. The rod that Long Chen had used had unleashed immense dragon might when activated with the power of the azure dragon, and it had caused him to lose his ability to heal his wounds.

A manifestation that was not acknowledged by the Heavenly Daos was viewed as cheating by the heavens. Even his original Heavenly Dao Recovery ability had lost a great deal of its effect. Under the strange gaze of countless experts, he had an urge to find a hole to bury himself in.

“Man Batian, I swear I will avenge this enmity!” roared Xiong Batian. He then also left after saying some vicious words. However, when comparing how Long Chen had left to how he was leaving, the difference was immense.

As for the dual sword wielding Lu Zichuan, he had a disdainful smile, but he also didn’t say anything.

The various experts were quite pleased inside seeing this result. They had been able to see Xiong Tianba suffer so much. After all, being part of the human race, although they did their best to suppress that feeling, they still felt refreshed. The Xuan Beasts and ancient races were just too hateful.

“However, Xiong Tianba at least let us see how powerful a manifestation is upon being fully awakened. Even though he isn’t blessed by the Heavenly Daos, he is able to unleash the full power of his world energy, while we are only able to use thirty percent. He’s actually quite unlucky. Not only was his manifestation crippled, but he also ended up running into a monster like Man Batian. Empyreans that haven’t awakened their manifestations probably can’t match either of them.” One expert made a rather neutral evaluation.

“You’re right. If his manifestation was truly awakened, he would be blessed by the Heavenly Daos, and his Heavenly Dao energy would have merged with his world energy. Then Man Batian definitely wouldn’t have been a match for him.”

“But how could it be so easy to fully awaken a manifestation? Talent, willpower, opportunity, and luck. You can’t be lacking even one. Moreover, you also need patience. We all have to patiently wait. The more impatient we are, the more chaotic our mental realms and the more difficult it will be to awaken our manifestations. Xiong Tianba is a perfect example of what we shouldn’t do. Empyreans are favored by the heavens. The Heavenly Daos will decide which one of us awakens our manifestation first. Anyone who tries to break that rule is definitely courting death.”

Fully awakening a manifestation was extremely difficult. Even though there were countless geniuses rising, even though there were countless people whose manifestations were just one step away from awakening, not one person had achieved it on the continent yet.

They were all waiting. But as time passed, more and more people reached the same level as them. They might be surpassed if they kept waiting.

The pressure these geniuses were under was immense. Each of them hoped to be the favored son of the heavens and run ahead of the others.

However, if they wanted to really get ahead of others, they couldn’t be disrespectful to the heavens. They couldn’t cheat their way forward.

Xiong Tianba had ended up giving a perfect example for everyone. Now they didn’t dare to even think about cheating like he had. It was better to patiently wait.

“Xiong Tianba is essentially crippled. This defeat will definitely be a fatal blow to him. Others are all advancing, while he’s stuck in his original spot. He’ll only be thrown further and further behind,” said someone.

“Hmph, what do you know? You’re such a fool. Do you think Xiong Tianba is someone you can discuss?” Suddenly, one of the distant Xuan Beasts opened his mouth. “The reason Xiong Tianba was at a disadvantage was because he suffered some injuries due to forcibly awakening his manifestation. He can only use eighty percent of his real power right now. The reason he came out before fully recovering is because he wants to enter Brahma secret realm. Inside, he can borrow the power of the gods to recover, and if he obtains their blessing, he might be able to restore his manifestation and truly awaken it. Pill Valley’s higher-ups have already arranged things to be more convenient for him. Just watch, next time the two of them meet, Man Batian will definitely be the one to die. You neutral people are opportunists who don’t understand anything. All you know how to do is spout nonsense.”

Those experts’ expressions sank at being criticized by this Xuan Beast, but before they could retort, the Xuan Beasts left.

“Fuck those idiots from the Xuan Beasts! Long Chen really needs to bully them more! They’re too hateful. Hopefully, Long Chen can enter as well and kill them,” said one neutral expert.

“Don’t get angry. It’s meaningless. We’re basically only here to watch the fun and see if we can dredge up anything good. After all, the Xuan Beasts are allied with Pill Valley, while we’re not. Let’s go.”

The spectators began to scatter. However, many of them continued to discuss Man Batian and Xiong Tianba, as well as discussing Xiong Tianba’s goal in the Brahma secret realm.

Long Chen had slipped away in his carriage. Without a mount pulling him, he felt strange. He had an urge to get a Xuan Beast to pull his carriage, but then he felt that it would be too arrogant. Even Man Batian wouldn’t be so arrogant.

He could only continue in his carriage with no mount, no longer crashing forward like before. With Pill Valley not that far ahead, he didn’t dare to act too exaggerated.

Long Chen looked down at the barren ground below him and recognized this place to be one of the former seven danger zones of the Martial Heaven Continent: the Heaven Devouring Forest.

The Heaven Devouring Forest had been damaged by the fire of Pill Valley thanks to Long Chen’s incitement. Then in the Spirit World, they had been destroyed by Long Chen.

Now the heaven-reaching forest had vanished. Back when he had first seen the Heaven Devouring Forest, he had been stunned by the terrifying tree monsters. But now, it had vanished from this world.

“Great heroes are born on the Martial Heaven Continent; the true Dragon rises arrogantly above all. Unrivaled divine power shatters heaven and earth, a power that looks down on all others. Nowadays, mediocrity is everywhere; people think of themselves as amazing without realizing others are laughing at them. The divine valley and ghost forest are still present, but the Master Long San of that time has vanished!”

Back then, someone had come up with this humorous poem. Reciting it, Long Chen didn’t know what feeling he had. The divine valley was still present, but the ghost forest was gone.

When he had fled from Pill Valley, the Pill Fairy had appeared in front of him. Instead of stopping him, she had given him her symbol in hopes that he would be able to slip away. He would never be able to forget that kindness.

As for now, he was like water and fire with Pill Valley. There was no way to mediate things between himself and Yu Xiaoyun. As for the Pill Fairy, she was currently receiving Pill Valley’s god inheritance.

“How stupidly dramatic.” Long Chen cursed. He wasn’t afraid of any enemy, but he was afraid of facing the Pill Fairy. If the Pill Fairy was standing in front of him, would he really be able to bring himself to kill her?

As he got closer to Pill Valley, he saw more and more experts. He saw people from the ancient races, the Corrupt path, the ancient family alliance, the Xuan Beasts, and even some people from Heavenly Fate Island.

The people from Heavenly Fate Island had different auras from regular cultivators, making them easy to recognize. However, they were no longer wearing robes of Heavenly Fate Island. They were wearing disciple robes of other sects. It seemed that Heavenly Fate Island’s elite disciples had been snatched up by the various large sects.

The four Fate Princes were dead, the Unfettered Allseer had been killed by the Dragonblood Legion, and Ji Wuming had fallen to Long Chen’s hands. Heavenly Fate Island was truly and fully done. Those disciples had naturally found other paths for themselves.

Long Chen also saw several black-robed figures on his path. They covered up their faces, making it so others couldn’t recognize them. They didn’t have any auras around them, and even looking right at them, it was impossible to sense their existence.

Clearly, these were assassins from the Bloodkill Hall. For them to be openly walking around in daylight, Long Chen had an urge to kill them.

He had destroyed the statue of the Killing God, and there was no way for him to settle things with them. The Bloodkill Hall had tried to assassinate him multiple times before his anger had been provoked and he had started counterattacking.

The most infuriating time was when he had found one of their strongholds and their leader had said that once he managed to survive a few more assassinations, their enmity would end.

Long Chen still remembered how arrogant that person had been. It was like other people’s lives were nothing, and if the Bloodkill Hall wanted to assassinate someone, they could only endure. That was why Long Chen had smashed their statue of the Killing God, making it so there was no way to reconcile their hatred.

“Fuck, just wait. Once we’re in the Brahma secret realm, I’ll teach you all why roses are red,” muttered Long Chen.

The Bloodkill Hall was quite crafty. In his last tribulation, there had been some disciples of the Bloodkill Hall hiding amongst the enemy experts. They had tried to assassinate people from the Dragonblood Legion, but those assassins that had fought back then were expendable. Although some were killed, they weren’t true elites. The Bloodkill Hall had been holding those back.

Continuing forward, he finally arrived at a large empty space. This space was where the transportation formation to enter Pill Valley was. He had come here before. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

However, this giant space was now packed with powerful experts, and even Long Chen jumped in shock.

“Where did this many powerful experts come from?!”
