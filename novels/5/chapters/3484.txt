Chapter 3473 Mysterious Mirror

“You’re going to leave?”

Bai Shishi was startled. Long Chen wasn’t just planning on leaving the academy but also the entire Darklight Heaven?

Long Chen nodded. This time, although he hadn’t killed the Nine Underworld Luocha, he had gained a great deal from her.

Through the burning soul refinement, Huo Linger had obtained this image of a mirror from her memories.

That mirror reflected the nine heavens and ten lands. The specks of light flashing within it had the auras of nine star heirs.

Based on Long Chen’s guess, this mirror was a divine item used for probing where the nine star heirs were. It was like a pair of eyes overlooking the nine heavens and ten lands.

It was no wonder that nine star heirs were discovered so easily. This time, Long Chen had found the position of the mirror and was preparing to destroy it. That way, the nine star heirs would be able to grow in peace.

However, this time, it would be very dangerous. The heaven that he was going to was called the Violet Flame Heaven. The Violet Flame Heaven was said to be one of the three most intact heavens from that ancient desolate battle.

Countless powerful sect inheritances existed, and they were almost all within those three heavens. Compared to the Violet Flame Heaven, the Darklight Heaven was a pile of ruins.

Long Chen also noticed another problem. Despite his fame spreading far and wide, up to now, he had only found Qin Feng and Qi Yu. He still had no information on the others.

That meant that the Dragonblood warriors were mostly not within the Darklight Heaven. If he wanted to gather the Dragonblood Legion again, he had to leave this place.

“Then we can go together?” probed Bai Shishi.

Long Chen shook his head. “If we both go, who will guard the seventh branch academy? I am going to leave by myself.”

“You can leave the academy to the main academy!” said Bai Shishi hastily.

“Shishi, listen to me.”

Long Chen suddenly held Bai Shishi’s hands. He solemnly said, “Our High Firmament Academy has many aspects that even you don’t know about. Before this, the elders carried our burden. Now that we’ve grown up, we have to learn how to lift that burden. We should take as much responsibility for ourselves as possible. The academy isn’t having such an easy time because of it. Once I leave, this place will be entrusted to you. I hope that you can protect everything of mine that is here. Properly cultivate and raise your power so that you can help me in the future.”

Bai Shishi’s heart warmed with Long Chen holding her hands. But for Long Chen to leave on his own, she was still unwilling. Her eyes reddened.

“How long will it take?” Bai Shishi bit her cherry lip.

Seeing her in this state, Long Chen also felt a current of warmth in his heart. This stubborn girl had managed to make him unwilling to part with her.

“It won’t take long. Have you forgotten? Our High Firmament Academy has branches spread throughout the nine heavens and ten lands. Once I go there, I will find the ruins of another branch academy, and then we can be together once more. I believe that at that time, you will have fully mastered the inheritance of that senior. I’ll rely on you to protect me in the future,” said Long Chen with a smile.

Only then did Bai Shishi also smile. She was a bit gratified, and she even felt a bit bad about her sentimentality.

There was no choice but to say that when women were drawn into the whirlpool of romance, intelligence went out the window. She believed whatever Long Chen said without overthinking it.

Bai Shishi’s smile was like a flower, and Long Chen was struck dumb by it. He couldn’t help sighing, “Your smile is so beautiful. It would be nice if you could smile more frequently.”

“I will only smile for you, not for others,” said Bai Shishi, still smiling.

“To have the favor of the High Firmament Academy’s number one beauty is the blessing of several lifetimes. Speaking of which, where did that fellow Xu Changchuan go?” When Long Chen thought of the academy’s number one beauty, he also thought of the old number one handsome man, Xu Changchuan.𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Bai Shishi shook her head. “Ever since the Nine Prefecture Convention, he has vanished. He has never appeared again or sent back any word.”

“Last time, he said that something popped up in his family and he needed to go back. And then there’s been nothing…” Long Chen found it curious.

Although they had started with some disagreement, later they had gotten to know each other better. Long Chen didn’t dislike his character.

After Long Chen had privately taught him how to pick up girls, they had settled their misunderstandings. So, for him to suddenly vanish was a bit sudden.

“That fellow comes from an area forbidden to life, which conceals a heaven-shaking secret. They’re very mysterious. When he came to the academy and revealed his status, he shook the entire academy. But that overbearing show-off style of his was dislikeable, so I found him annoying,” said Bai Shishi.

Although Xu Changchuan was very handsome, he had an overbearing pride in his bones. That pride was something that Bai Shishi also had. Thus, when he said that he wished to pursue Bai Shishi, he had already missed his chance.

Just how prideful was Bai Shishi? The two of them had instantly ended up at odds, and both their sharp lights opposed each other. It wasn’t wooing but fighting, seeing who could subdue the other. It was very childish.

Thus, no matter what kind of sincerity Xu Changchuan had taken out, it was considered a provocation in Bai Shishi’s eyes, and she disliked him. There was even one time when she had been so enraged that she almost tried to kill him. If it hadn’t been for her mother stopping her, perhaps she really would have killed him.

However, ever since Long Chen appeared, Bai Shishi was influenced quite a bit. This fellow who never acted according to common sense always caught people off guard.

Long Chen was truly a mysterious existence that made her curious. She couldn’t help wanting to see through him.

However, the closer she got to Long Chen, the more she found him mysterious. Sometimes he was warm, sometimes he was domineering. Sometimes he was as crafty as a fox, sometimes he was as fierce as a tiger. Sometimes he was a wise sage, but sometimes he became an idiot who caused a mess.

To sum it up, she was unable to tell just what kind of person he was. But as she stared at him, without being aware of it, she was drawn to him. By the time she sensed the danger, she was unable to extricate herself.

Furthermore, the longer she knew him, the more she felt herself maturing as well. She saw problems clearer. Thus, when she compared Long Chen and Xu Changchuan, the latter seemed to be an immature child. It was also due to this that she no longer found Xu Changchuan so detestable.

Now that Long Chen mentioned Xu Changchuan, Bai Shishi also grew curious. It couldn’t be that due to his failure, knowing that he wasn’t a match for Long Chen, this fellow dejectedly ran away, right? But she couldn’t say such a thing out loud.

On the other hand, Long Chen felt that Xu Changchuan’s disappearance didn’t quite make sense. But as for the exact situation, perhaps only Xu Changchuan himself knew.

The area forbidden to life, a region that others couldn’t touch. Everything inside was secret. Xu Changchuan himself had never divulged anything about it to others. Thus, he himself was also a mystery.
