Chapter 4271 Seven Star Battle Armor

“I really am afraid. On such a complicated battlefield with so many enemies, I’m afraid that I can’t protect them. So I’ve been holding back, making sure to use every bit of my power effectively. As for you? What are you afraid of? Are you afraid that you can’t beat me? Is that why you are waiting for an opportunity, waiting for others to help you? The barrier doesn’t seem like it will disappear for a while, so you shouldn’t hope for the outside world’s experts to help you. As for within the barrier, those people are focused on the karmic luck runes, so you also can’t count on them,” said Long Chen lightly.

Long Chen and Long Aotian had faced each other many times, leading them to be very familiar with each other. Due to this, it was difficult to determine a victor between them in an instant. If no one else interfered, in the end, the ultimate winner would be decided by absolute power.

Both Long Chen and Long Aotian still hid their trump cards, but both of them had different goals and reasons for doing so.

“You are wrong,” said Long Aotian coldly.

“How am I wrong?” asked Long Chen.

“You are wrong in that you are too conceited. You think that I’m holding back because I’m waiting for an opportunity? I’ll tell you. I haven’t unleashed my full power because I was unable to unleash it before. Do you not find it curious? I obtained your Spirit Blood, Spirit Root, and Spirit Bone, but up until now, I’ve only used the power of your Spirit Blood. Why is that?” said Long Aotian.

“If my guess is right, you need to rely on the primal chaos qi from this gate to gradually activate them. At the start, the primal chaos qi was only enough to activate the seven-color Supreme Blood. After you managed to activate the violet blood, you finally started using it. But after this much time, the Spirit Root and Spirit Bone should have absorbed enough primal chaos qi. You should be able to activate them now, right? What are you waiting for?” asked Long Chen lightly.

“You… you knew?” Long Aotian was startled.

Long Aotian suddenly felt like Long Chen had seen through everything.

“Impossible! You’re definitely randomly guessing!” roared Long Aotian, panicking slightly.

“If you feel that way, whatever,” said Long Chen.

“If you really knew, you would have gone all-out to kill me from the beginning! You wouldn’t have let me activate them!” shouted Long Aotian.

“If I killed you then, my Spirit Root and Spirit Bone would have stayed dormant. If I were to reclaim them then, it would damage their spirituality. I wouldn’t do something so foolish,” said Long Chen lightly.

People were stunned to hear their conversation. They still had trump cards? Moreover, Long Chen’s goal was to extract Long Aotian’s Spirit Blood, Spirit Root, and Spirit Bone? Just what made him so confident?

“What nonsense. There’s no way you were thinking so much. You’re just acting calm to cover up the fear in your heart,” said Long Aotian. He suddenly spread his arms and roared, causing a thunderous sound to come from his Dantian. Following that, the sound of his bones creaking erupted, and divine light slowly lit up on his abdomen.

“Heavens, he’s not a true Triple Supreme yet!”

Suddenly, a startled cry rang out in the surroundings. The audience had been so consumed by Long Aotian's overwhelming might that they failed to notice that, unlike the other peak experts present, he had yet to merge his three Supremes.

At this moment, the power of Long Aotian’s Spirit Root, Spirit Blood, and Spirit Bone merged together, and the violet qi and primal chaos manifestation behind him twisted, condensing into a giant multicolored flower.

The mysterious flower bore three rotating petals, its presence eerily silent and devoid of any aura. However, as it revolved, it set heaven and earth into motion. The ten thousand Daos and laws danced in its wake, forming halos of light that enveloped Long Aotian, as if the very cosmos was worshiping him.

“Three flowers merge, one with the heavens. Even the ten thousand Daos offer worship. This is a manifestation of an original Triple Supreme! If he does not fall, he can even aim to become a Human Emperor!”

It was unlike everything people had ever seen. None of the Triple Supremes present had been able to evoke this phenomenon where the ten thousand Daos worshiped them during the merging of their three Supremes. This was a legendary manifestation.

Seeing this scene, the Long clan’s experts cried out excitedly. This signified that the Long clan would produce a Human Emperor. A Human Emperor? That was an existence at the apex of the world. The ten thousand races would be forced to submit to them, and the Long clan would stand at the very peak of the world.

The other experts were taken aback, a mixture of awe, envy, and a hint of killing intent. Everyone knew that the other races would not permit a Human Emperor to appear again.

Long Aotian was surrounded by divine radiance as the laws were worshiping him. The ten thousand Daos enveloped him as if he were a heavenly emperor, a sacred existence that could not be offended.

Suddenly, Long Aotian’s sword pierced toward Long Chen, unleashing a ray of Sword Qi instantly. The ten thousand Daos and laws were all absorbed into this one blow.

BOOM!

The sword-light narrowly missed Long Chen’s cheek. Following that, a black channel appeared, stretching beyond the horizon. This narrow black channel hung in the air, with countless runes coursing through it, emitting terrifying ripples.

People were utterly shocked by this blow. The power behind the sword-light contained the terrifying power of the world laws, and it completely toppled the understanding of many individuals. It was no longer adequate to describe this sword simply as powerful.

“Do you see? This is my true power. If I had aimed my sword half a foot to the left, you would already be dead.” Long Aotian pointed his sword at Long Chen, his eyes filled with confidence.

Long Aotian could feel endless power flowing within his body. In that instant, all traces of his fear and anger vanished, replaced by unwavering confidence.

With a single stroke of his sword, he broke through the dome of the heavens, a sight that moved even ghosts and gods into tears, instilling fear and astonishment in all who witnessed it.ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

“If you had aimed half a foot closer, I’d have dodged. You know that you cannot lock me down, which is why you are acting arrogant. This arrogance is an act because you are not confident enough. This only proves that no matter how strong you get, you cannot erase the fear in your heart,” said Long Chen lightly.

The reason Long Chen hadn’t moved just now was because he had read through Long Aotian’s intentions. He hadn’t even batted an eyelid.

However, even if he had read Long Aotian’s intentions, people couldn’t help but admire his guts. If this attack had landed, not even ten thousand lives would be enough to withstand it. Long Chen was truly confident.

“Bullshit! You damn mixed breed!”

Long Chen’s words swiftly knocked Long Aotian from his lofty throne. His face twisted, and his three-flower manifestation quivered as he directed his sword toward Long Chen.

“Your mouth really is repulsive. Did your parents die too early before they could teach you some manners? After stealing someone else’s things, you still dare to act so arrogant? Today, you will pay the price in blood.”

Following that, Long Chen’s gaze sharpened. His black robes and long hair began to flutter, and an explosive power welled up within him.
