Chapter 4605 White Bone Desert

Long Chen didn’t continue looking for medicinal ingredients. After all, there was something more important waiting for him here.

Furthermore, he was also competing with Lord Brahma’s disciple, so he didn’t dare to tarry.

“Big Brother Long Chen, I’m sorry. I reacted too slowly back then. I didn’t come out to help immediately.” Huo Linger’s apologetic voice rang out.

When the white-robed man attacked, she didn’t come out immediately, resulting in Long Chen being injured. Hence, she felt guilty.

If she had taken action earlier, even if only passively defending, Long Chen’s injuries would have been less severe.

Huo Linger and Lei Linger possessed unique powers that were intrinsic to them. After all, it was exceedingly rare for spiritual bodies to have control over their own power. This stemmed from the fact that no master would let their spiritual bodies do so, mainly due to the inherent risks involved.

If a spiritual body had a slave seal on it, the scenario would be different. In that case, the master could unleash the spiritual body’s power with a single thought, and the spiritual body would be compelled to comply even if it desired otherwise.

However, Huo Linger and Lei Linger operated differently, and despite their connection to Long Chen’s soul, they couldn’t immediately react to a sudden attack.

It was this slight delay that allowed the white-robed man’s attack to land before Huo Linger could react, ultimately leading to Long Chen’s injury.

“Foolish girl, it’s not your mistake. Our cooperation is almost flawless, and I don’t believe that you reacted too slowly. I believe that fellow’s Nirvana Scripture affected your reaction time,” consoled Long Chen.

“Really?” Huo Linger’s eyes lit up.

With their souls connected and their utmost trust in each other, they could fight freely and effortlessly. Thus, even without a slave seal, Long Chen was connected to their power. Long Chen never doubted his connection with Huo Linger. That was why his first suspicion was that this fellow’s Nirvana Scripture was capable of affecting Huo Linger.

Considering that Huo Linger had been in the primal chaos space, the Nirvana Scripture shouldn’t have been able to influence her. However, the Nirvana Scripture was the number one flame scripture of the nine heavens and ten lands, and even the Earth Cauldron acknowledged that it was a terrifying existence.

Based on Long Chen’s analysis, there were only two explanations for the situation. The first one was that this Nirvana Scripture could penetrate the primal chaos space and affect Huo Linger from a different space.

However, there was another possibility to consider. The Nirvana Scripture could have limited Long Chen’s senses toward flame energy, as well as his ability to circulate his own flame energy.

As Long Chen served as Huo Linger’s link to the external world beyond the primal chaos space, any effects experienced by Long Chen would also impact Huo Linger.

Regardless, Long Chen couldn’t shake the feeling that he had only glimpsed another aspect of the Nirvana Scripture’s power, and this glimpse filled him with a fervent desire to obtain it.

Long Chen saw countless experts as he sped through this land. Some were attacking the beasts in the surroundings head-on, and others were launching sneak attacks. However, the further he went in this area, the stronger the beasts were.

Long Chen personally witnessed an Earth Dragon variant unleash a wave of breath that annihilated tens of thousands of experts who had come for its treasure.

Its breath even annihilated seven-star Doyens, not allowing them to flee. Moreover, these seven-star Doyens were real experts, not quasi-Doyens like the medicine slaves.

Taking advantage of the distraction, Long Chen dove in and grabbed a fruit that looked like a jujube pit.

Feeling something amiss, the Earth Dragon seethed with rage and attacked Long Chen, but Long Chen had fled rapidly. As the Earth Dragon didn’t dare to leave its territory, after roaring a few times, it returned dejectedly.

Long Chen saw many precious medicinal ingredients that he had never seen before. Whether he recognized them or not, he made sure to collect them all, preferring not to overlook any potential treasures.

To maintain his momentum, Long Chen proceeded in a straight line, only deviating to collect items that were directly in his path, regardless of any disturbances he heard in other areas.

As Long Chen continued his advance, despite no longer encountering any members of the Three Eye race, he suddenly detected an aura similar to that of medicine slaves.

However, he ignored it and continued rushing forward. Several days later, he found that the surrounding world had gone silent. He could neither hear the roars of wild beasts nor find any other cultivators.

This place was now frighteningly quiet, causing the air to be filled with a sense of danger. It was so suffocating that even Long Chen felt his soul quivering.

“It seems there are some fatally dangerous things here!”

Long Chen saw a misty cloud up ahead. Unable to see into it, he didn’t know what was hidden inside.

Moments ago, Long Chen could still discern the roars of other experts and beasts echoing in the distance. However, in an instant, it was as if all sounds were abruptly severed by an invisible blade, leaving behind an unsettling silence.

But no matter how dangerous it was, for the Nirvana Scripture, Long Chen had to advance. Thinking that the disciple of Lord Brahma might also be after the Nirvana Scripture, Long Chen refused to retreat.

When Long Chen stepped into this mist, his hair instantly stood on end. An intense sensation of danger welled up within him as he felt like he had entered a domain of death.

Within the dense mist, Long Chen found his spiritual perception severely suppressed, along with his vision.

His senses were constrained to a mere hundred miles. While this might seem considerable, it paled in comparison to the vast size of the beasts he encountered, some of which spanned thousands of miles. This bit of distance was unable to give him any sense of security.

A light sound rang out beneath Long Chen’s foot. Looking around, he realized that there was no longer any grass or stone in the surroundings; it was a desert.

This desert was white. However, what scared him shitless was the realization that the sand beneath his feet was not sand at all—it was composed of countless bone fragments.

Long Chen had stepped onto a white bone just now. Its surface was covered in densely packed runes, which showed that its master’s power was formidable.

However, the bone had deteriorated to such an extent that even the slightest touch caused it to crumble into dust.

The bone’s runes were a deep blood-red hue, indicating that its master had died not long ago, likely within ten days. Yet, it looked like it had eroded for millions of years. It didn’t make sense.

Long Chen’s vigilance intensified at this revelation. Clearly, others had already ventured into this area. Faced with the unknown dangers of this realm, only those with unwavering confidence would dare to press forward.

As Long Chen advanced through the bone-laden desert, a python silently appeared out of the mist and leaped at Long Chen’s neck.
