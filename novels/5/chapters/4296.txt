Chapter 4285 Reincarnation of the Barbarian King?

Among these new experts of the Barbarian race, one female warrior in particular stood out, making Guo Ran and the others’ eyes pop out.0

This woman was even larger and sturdier than Wilde, and her Blood Qi was many times stronger as well. Her aura was not at all inferior to half-step Eternals.0

Although she was extremely large and robust, her figure was still well-proportioned. If she became a normal-sized human, she would be considered a beauty.0

However, her overwhelming Blood Qi made it seem like a wild dragon was slumbering within her body, leaving people awestruck and too afraid to approach her.0

Wilde seemed to instantly become a coward when he saw this woman. He then hid behind the Dragonblood Legion, shouting, “I’m not going back! I want to be with Brother Long!”0

The mighty and indomitable Wilde who had shaken the ten thousand races was now like a child that was throwing a tantrum, making countless people speechless.0

“And where is your Brother Long?” asked that woman.0

“My Brother Long… my Brother Long is…” Wilde didn’t know how to reply.0

“Wilde, listen. Your Brother Long had to leave. Once he’s back, we’ll find him together. You also saw that with your current power, you still can’t help your Brother Long much. You need to eat more, sleep more, and grow into a powerful man. Only then can you beat up the bad people,” comforted the woman gently just like speaking to a child.0

She also cast a glance at Guo Ran and the others, causing them to understand what was going on. Wilde’s position in the Barbarian race was very particular, and no one could force him to do anything. Hence, they had to advise him to return to the Barbarian race.0

Long Chen had bought them a year, and no one should waste this time. After all, Wilde’s best cultivation environment was in the Barbarian race’s land.0

“Wilde, listen to this big sister. Go back for now, and when boss is back, we’ll come find you. Go and eat the best meat. We’ll see each other soon,” said Guo Ran.0

“Really? Don’t trick me! They’re always tricking me, saying that they’ll bring me to Brother Long tomorrow, but tomorrow never comes!” Wilde suddenly began to cry. It seemed that he was venting all of his grief.0

Guo Ran and the others felt bad. Tricking such a kind and naive child like Wilde was too cruel.0

However, if they didn’t say this, Wilde wouldn’t leave. Thus, Guo Ran forced his tears to stop and smiled. “Good brother, how could we trick you? Go back, eat a few meals, sleep a few naps, and we’ll be there.”0

“Alright, I’ll listen to you. You have to come find me!” Wilde finally assented.0

Only then did the woman from the Barbarian race walk over to them and pull Wilde up. To Guo Ran and the others, she gave a warning glance. “To tell the truth, we dislike the human race, and we don’t agree with Wilde going with you guys. We won’t let our future king follow a human. However, Long Chen has changed our opinion of the human race, so we are willing to give you one chance. I hope your human race won’t disappoint us again.”0

Guo Ran was lost, not knowing what she was talking about. However, he solemnly swore, “I may not know what you’re talking about, but since boss is not here, I will respond with boss’s words. First, Wilde is our brother, and we will walk through mountains of blades for any of our brothers. We will sacrifice our lives and be crushed to dust for our brothers. Second, from top to bottom, our Dragonblood Legion is full of iron-boned men. We do not fear seas of blood or mountains of corpses. We don’t need anyone’s pity or aid. Third, our Dragonblood Legion’s word is worth its weight in gold. Enmities must be avenged, and kindness must be repaid. Anyone who does help us will be remembered. If you do not like us, you don’t need to join us because of Wilde. We can each mind our own business. But if Wilde is in trouble, you must tell us. Even if we must cross the nine heavens, we will come to help you. You must promise me this, otherwise, even if boss isn’t present, our Dragonblood Legion will fight to the last person to prevent you from taking Wilde away.”0

Guo Ran’s words were polite but unyielding. That was because the Barbarian woman’s words irritated him. It was as if she was speaking to them from a high position and practically taking pity on them as if they were trying to beg the Barbarian race for help, like they were trying to rise with the Barbarian race’s help.0

After all, every person in the Dragonblood Legion had immense pride in themselves, so they were unable to accept such an insult. Perhaps if Wilde wasn’t here, they would have turned hostile.0

Wilde’s expression also changed. Although he wasn’t very intelligent, he could clearly distinguish people’s emotions.0

“What are you doing?! Are you trying to make them angry?!” shouted Wilde at the Barbarian woman.0

That woman was baffled. She didn’t even know what had made them so angry.0

“I’m not going back with you! I don’t want you! I’m not going to marry you! I hate you!”0

Wilde furiously threw off her hand. Caught off guard, she stumbled back.0

“Young friends, please calm down. Youngsters just don’t know how to talk, so let me take over.” At this moment, an elder from the Barbarian race walked over. This elder was also large and had a shocking Blood Qi. However, he had a very kind face, and his voice was also particularly gentle. It was unlike the rest of the Barbarian race where their normal voice was like raging thunder.0

“Grandpa!” That woman’s eyes reddened and she cried out sullenly.0

In truth, this person was the leader of the Barbarian race. However, all disciples of the Barbarian race called him grandpa, not race leader.0

The leader of the Barbarian race waved his hand at the woman, indicating her to be silent. To Guo Ran, he said, “You are all good children. It has been many years since heavenly geniuses like yourselves have emerged among the human race. I hope that you won’t blame Lovely. Our Barbarian race once suffered greatly at the hands of your human race, leaving a very deep wound. But these are things of the past, so let’s not bring them up now. You should all work hard on raising your cultivation bases. Do not waste the time that Long Chen fought so hard to secure for us.”1

Guo Ran and the others’ hearts shook when they heard this. It seemed to be related to some history that was covered up by the human race. After all, there was no deep-seated hatred without a cause. Perhaps the human race really had done something terrible to them.0

“We will follow senior’s instructions.” Guo Ran cupped his fists to him.0

“Wilde, say goodbye to your friends!” said the race leader.0

Wilde unwillingly waved goodbye to Guo Ran and the others. It seemed that this grandpa was the only existence that Wilde didn’t dare to rebel against. However, when Lovely reached out to hold Wilde’s hand again, it was thrown off once more. Wilde was still angry with her.0𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

The race leader couldn’t help but shake his head when he saw that. He then waved goodbye to Guo Ran and the others before leading the Barbarian race’s experts away. However, he didn’t even glance at Feng Xinyue, the palace master, the dean, or the others.0

“It seems that this Wilde is the reincarnation of the Blood Barbarian race’s Barbarian King. The Blood Barbarian race’s former glory might shine once more.”0

Feng Xinyue murmured as she watched them leave, her voice filled with emotion.0

“The reincarnation of the Barbarian King?!” Everyone cried out in shock.
