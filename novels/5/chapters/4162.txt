Chapter 4151: Long Clan’s People

BANG!

Two palms struck each other. But there was neither a heaven-shaking explosion nor an eruption of divine light. The earth didn’t even crack.

.

However, the Black Tortoise race’s elder grunted and involuntarily staggered back. After that, two of his subordinates hastily went to support him.

To everyone’s surprise, blood instantly sprayed from their mouths, and they tumbled back. The people behind them hastily dodged. As for the blood that came out of them, not one drop was wasted. Guo Ran once more caught it all with his bowl. Seeing it, Xia Chen was overjoyed and hastily poured it into his bottle.

Once this essence blood was blended with other materials, it would become top grade inscription fluid that could be used to create various high level talismans. It could also be added to other inscription fluids to increase the power of the talismans.

Guo Ran and Xia Chen eyed the elder in particular. This fellow was an innate Heaven Venerate. If he were to cough up blood as well…

One held a golden bowl, while one was holding a bottle. They were like two hungry people eyeing a meal.

Seeing both of them, that elder was enraged. After that, he looked at Xu Jianxiong in disbelief. Just now, he had actually been at a disadvantage.

Although part of it was due to his power being out of balance from missing Long Chen, Xu Jianxiong had only launched a casual blow, so they should have been evenly matched.

However, Xu Jianxiong was completely unmoved, while he was forced back. It was clear that he had lost.

Although this one move wasn’t enough to prove that Xu Jianxiong was stronger than him, it did indicate that Xu Jianxiong was, at the very least, not weaker than him.

This elder had mistakenly believed that the Fullmoon race had already declined to the point where Xu Jianxiong's power, despite being an innate Heaven Venerate, would be a far cry from his. That was why he had dared to come to humiliate the Fullmoon race.

However, this one blow showed him that the Fullmoon race was not as weak as he had imagined. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

“Why are you sticking out your neck, you old tortoise? Are you asking for another slap?” Long Chen peeked from behind Xu Jianxiong and further insulted the elder.

Hearing this, the Fullmoon race’s experts almost laughed. On the other hand, the Black Tortoise race’s experts bristled, killing intent exploding out of them. As long as their elder gave the order, they would immediately attack to kill.

Xu Jianxiong didn’t say anything and just looked at the elder coldly. This elder was the Black Tortoise’s race leader. As long as he gave the word, a large battle would instantly erupt.

Despite his shock and anger, this elder couldn't shake the growing unease gnawing at him. It felt like they had kicked a metal plate.

If they were to fight here, it would be soldiers against soldiers, generals against generals. Experts above the World King realm could fight, but they couldn’t take any lives without fear of being struck by misfortune.

Thus, the ones to fight would really be the younger disciples in the Immortal King realm. Just now, Long Chen and Xu Changchuan had both launched attacks, displaying their terrifying power. Long Chen’s slap in particular had made stars spin in his eyes.

Even if this elder had been caught off guard, Long Chen had indeed rattled his protective divine light, a feat that most Heaven Venerates couldn’t do.

After thinking it through, in the end, he didn’t give the order and only said, “The prideful Fullmoon race is actually colluding with the human race. You really have fallen.”

Xu Jianxiong was about to reply when Long Chen took his chance to speak. “Isn’t that still better than your head-lowering race? At the very least, we are mutually respecting each other and mutually benefiting. As for you, you got slapped in the face by a member of the human race and don’t even dare to let out a fart. Even as you lower your tortoise head, do you feel no shame mocking others?”

Xu Jianxiong almost burst out laughing. The human race really did have greater eloquence, further proving that cursing people required talent.

“You…!”

The Black Tortoise race’s leader quivered with rage, his face purple. He was going to explode with rage. All he wanted was to crush Long Chen right here and now.

He almost coughed up blood from anger. But what made him almost die of rage was that Guo Ran and Xia Chen were staring at him fanatically, as if waiting for him to cough up blood so they could gather it.

His face gradually went from purple to black, and terrifying runes began to swirl in his eyes. He seemed to be on the verge of going crazy. Even Xu Jianxiong was shocked by that, so he secretly circulated his own power, ready to fight at any moment.

Ultimately, the Black Tortoise race’s leader managed to control himself. Without saying another word, he turned and left. He didn’t dare to say anything else for fear that blood might come out.

“Goodbye to the heroes of the head-lowering race! Many thanks for your gifts!” Guo Ran courteously sent the Black Tortoise race off, and he even had Xia Chen shake his bottle in front of them. That bottle was now full of the Black Tortoise race’s essence blood.

The Black Tortoise race’s experts glared at Guo Ran furiously, clenching their teeth. But without the order from their leader, they endured it and left.

However, from their gazes, it was clear that this enmity was set in stone. They would definitely try to get vengeance.

“Have you heard of the head-lowering black turtle? They cower inside their little shell, refusing to face reality. I can’t believe that they were able to even endure this,” said Long Chen. He had truly expected a large battle to erupt.

The Black Tortoise race had come to insult the Fullmoon race, only to get slapped in the face repeatedly, and then they actually managed to endure that humiliation and leave. They didn’t even try anything and simply left. That was a bit outside his expectations.

Originally, Long Chen had thought that they would at least have their disciples probe the disciples of the Fullmoon race. They had to at least try it to probe the Fullmoon race’s power.

Long Chen also wanted to see the power of these immemorial races. He hoped that the Dragonblood warriors could get some experience, or they would be at a disadvantage when a real fight occurred. Thus, their attitude disappointed him.

“Changchuan, not bad,” said Xu Jianxiong. “If you managed to do this without needing a reminder from someone else, it would be even better.”

Xu Changchuan blushed. It seemed that his guts were still too small, and he also wasn’t smart enough to realize what Xu Jianxiong wanted. On the other hand, Long Chen had long since realized it. Xu Jianxiong didn’t need to say it so bluntly for him to understand.

“Found it. It’s here!”

After a full day of traveling, Xu Jianxiong finally found a pile of ruins and smiled.

Long Chen couldn’t see anything amazing about this place, but it also wasn’t convenient for him to ask. The Fullmoon race immediately got to work on setting up a residence here.

The Fullmoon race had just managed to construct the residence when one of their disciples came running in.

“Reporting to the race leader and senior apprentice-brother Long Chen, there’s someone outside who wishes for an audience. They say they are from… an Eternal clan, the Long clan.”
