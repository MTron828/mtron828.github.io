Chapter 4822 Local Celebrity

After slipping out of the academy with Long Chen, Mo Nian took out two aura-concealing talismans. Both talismans were yellowed with age, indicating they were from a different era and likely dug out by Mo Nian himself.

Mo Nian explained that these talismans would not just conceal their auras but also screen them from the detection of karmic luck sensors. This way, the two of them could avoid the spying of the Brahma Pill Valley. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“Brother, it’s not that I’m trying to bring you down, but what’s going on with you? You were targeted by so many people in front of the gate to the ninth heaven when you first arrived in the Sovereign Emperor Heaven, but you didn’t leave their corpses littering the land? That isn’t your style, is it?” asked Mo Nian as the two of them traveled. Due to Mo Nian needing to recover, they weren’t in any rush.

After being inflicted with the curse, Mo Nian instantly thought of Long Chen. At first, Mo Nian had thought that he needed to go to the High Firmament Academy’s main academy, but fortunately Long Chen had already come to the Sovereign Emperor Heaven. Otherwise, Mo Nian wouldn’t have lasted long enough to get to Long Chen.

After that, Mo Nian hurriedly rushed off. Hearing people mentioning Long Chen’s name, he asked around and discovered that they were among those who had targeted Long Chen

Mo Nian instantly stopped caring about any courtesy and directly used a soulsearch. He then learned where the High Firmament Academy had set up their temporary camp, but when he arrived there, Long Chen and the others had moved to their new stronghold. Mo Nian was already exhausted by then. Fortunately, he managed to reach Long Chen before he hit his limit.

“You also feel like it’s not my style?” Long Chen was surprised.

“Of course. Back when we swept through the Martial Heaven Continent, it didn’t matter who got in our way. If people blocked us, we killed them. If gods blocked us, we slew gods. I don’t understand why you let them off when they clearly wanted you dead. Giving leeway everywhere isn’t your style. Didn’t you ever say that you would never let off anyone who threatened your life, and it didn’t matter if they were good or bad people?” said Mo Nian.

“Did I say that?”

“Of course. Have you forgotten? They were your own words! Who cares if someone is good or bad? Neither one has the right to strip you of your life. The only one who can control your life is yourself.”

Mo Nian stared at him and continued, “What? Have you forgotten? Were you possessed? Hey, tell me, where did we first meet?”

“Tch, stop that nonsense,” snorted Long Chen. “If I was possessed, would I risk my life to save you? Based on what? Your big face?”

“That’s true.” Mo Nian nodded. “Hold it, what do you mean? My face is very handsome!”

Perhaps Mo Nian wouldn’t mind other insults, but his slightly pudgy face was a sore spot for him. After all, it was true.

“Mo Nian, to tell you the truth, I am still dealing with my heart-devil...” Long Chen couldn’t help but sigh.

This was a secret that Long Chen had not shared with anyone else, but he confided in Mo Nian. It wasn't a matter of distrust toward the others; rather, they couldn't assist him with it, and revealing it would only cause them to worry needlessly.

However, Mo Nian was different. Long Chen had complete trust and confidence in him.

“A heart-devil?” Mo Nian was shocked. He had not expected someone as strong as Long Chen to have a heart-devil.

Long Chen didn’t conceal it and told Mo Nian about his conflict with his heart-devil in detail. After telling Mo Nian about it, Long Chen felt relieved of a heavy burden.

Sometimes, an unshared secret of the heart could become an overwhelming weight that one couldn’t bear alone.

“Damn, that fellow is that strong?”

“He’s incredibly strong. I don’t know how his power is rising so much,” said Long Chen.

“Oh, I understand!” Mo Nian suddenly nodded. “No wonder I feel like you don’t have your old sharpness. Your heart-devil has been tormenting you. In truth, it’s very simple. Why are you paying him any attention? If you are stronger, he should be the one vexed. If you aren’t strong enough, you’ll be consumed sooner or later, so why worry? Your heart-devil is just one of your countless enemies. Even if you can beat your heart-devil, can you guarantee that you’ll beat every enemy in the future? Even if you can beat every enemy, can you guarantee that you’ll never face death or failure? Life is like a firework. We just need to blaze as brightly as we can. Why would we worry about when the curtain drops?”

Mo Nian’s speech shocked Long Chen. After all, Long Chen had said the same things in the past. He instantly felt like he had received a revelation, and a shackle on his heart instantly came undone.

“Hahaha!” Long Chen chuckled, his laughter a blend of self-mockery and satisfaction. He realized that while people could offer advice to others, they often struggled to apply those same principles to themselves. Perhaps this discrepancy stemmed from the difference between being actively involved in a situation and observing it from the sidelines.

No matter how strong his heart-devil became, would it become stronger than Lord Brahma? Even Lord Brahma couldn’t spook him, so why could a heart-devil? It was laughable.

“Thanks for that. I feel better. You’re a good brother,” said Long Chen as he patted Mo Nian’s shoulder.

“Hehe, of course. However, I am curious about your heart-devil. If there’s a chance, I’d like to meet him. If we share the same thoughts, I don’t mind taking him as a brother too, hahaha!” Mo Nian laughed.

Before this, perhaps Long Chen would be irritated, but now that the knot in his heart was undone, he didn’t mind this joke.

“So when did you get here?” asked Long Chen.

Mo Nian counted on his fingers. “I’m not too sure. The majority of my time was spent underground, and the flow of time was also different in some places. I’d say more than half a year but less than a full year.”

“You really are dedicated to your work.” Long Chen was speechless.

“A person must be committed! Since I’ve chosen this line of work, I’m going to reach its pinnacle! But don’t underestimate me. I’m no longer the old Mo Nian. Now, I’m a major character in the Sovereign Emperor Heaven. Although I wouldn’t dare to say that my name can shake the whole world, I’m at least a local celebrity,” bragged Mo Nian.

Suddenly, Mo Nian took off the talismans on them, turning their auras to normal. They had arrived at an ancient city.

As soon as the two of them appeared, the guards by the gate stared in shock at Mo Nian, clearly recognizing him.

“There’s no other way. I also wish I could live a low-key, normal life,” bragged Mo Nian again as he shrugged helplessly.

“You goddamn, immoral bastard! Mo Nian, hand over your life!”

After a moment of shock, killing intent exploded out of the guards. They drew their weapons and immediately attacked. In an instant, Long Chen’s impressed expression changed.

“You’re this kind of local celebrity?”
