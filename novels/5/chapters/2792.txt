Chapter 2781 The Wolf God Awakens

Illusory figures walked out of the spatial gates, the aura of divine Daos flowing around them. Right now, everyone’s soul involuntarily quivered. They actually had an urge to kowtow.

“Are those really gods?!”

Shocked cries rang out as they felt an instinctual fear. Gods stood above the mortal world. They were existences that controlled the fates of mortal experts.

As soon as they appeared, the world trembled as if it couldn’t contain their existence.

“Not good. The channel has been mostly opened. Although the gods are unable to descend with their true bodies, spiritual clones can pass.” Ma Ruyun’s expression changed. He hadn’t expected this battle to draw even god incarnations over.

Although Ma Ruyun was a follower of the Wealth God, he didn’t have the ability to have the Wealth God’s power descend.

The other side clearly viewed this battle as something that they had to win at all costs. Hence, they didn’t give the Martial Heaven Continent any chance. Once Ye Ming and the others had the god incarnations possessing them, they would be on a completely different level. They could then be considered demigods.

Furthermore, there were still the endless armies of invaders. Although the reinforcements from the Immemorial Path, the Spirit World, and the Star Field Divine World were powerful, they were only able to maintain an absolute defense against them. A counterattack wasn’t possible.

In other words, they could only watch as those god incarnations descended. The High Priest then looked toward Long Chen and saw that a vague Sovereign crown had condensed on his head.

Perhaps it was precisely because of this that the Nine-Headed Lion and the others were so panicked that they had done this. If Long Chen did become a Sovereign, it would be a disaster for them.

At this moment, the void trembled and Ye Ming’s eyes changed. He seemed to have become a different person as divine energy gushed out of him. Also, a vague figure could be seen behind him.

Ye Ming was the first to complete the god incarnation, and he immediately shot toward Long Chen.

“Stop him!” shouted Mo Nian. The four supreme divine items attacked together.

BOOM!

As a result, Wilde, Mo Nian, Ye Zhiqiu, and Zi Yan hacked up blood, flying back. Even their combined power was unable to stop the demigod Ye Ming.

“A group of ants thinks they can stop me?”

Ye Ming’s voice was strange and coarse. It was layered on top of the other, as if two people were speaking at the same time.

Ye Ming then charged forward. But suddenly, the ground split open and giant wooden stakes flew out, cutting the world in two. The Life God Tree and the mother tree had summoned a wooden wall.

“The descendants of the Immortal Spirit race also dare to court death?” The current Ye Ming was possessed by a god’s incarnation. It could even partially be said that a god was controlling him.

That god clearly recognized the origins of the Life God Tree and the mother tree and knew that they weren’t fighting races.

Ye Ming’s spear blazed with light. The powerful divine energy instantly ignited all of its runes. With a single thrust, that giant wooden wall exploded, appearing incredibly weak in front of Ye Ming. In his demigod state, he had entered a different kind of realm, above all of them.

However, this kind of possession would definitely cause immense harm to the body being possessed. A mortal body was not capable of containing a god.

If it weren’t for this pressing situation, the Nine-Headed Lion and the others definitely wouldn’t have used this move. If Long Chen did become a Sovereign, none of them would be able to suppress him. If Long Chen managed to close the spatial channels, they would all be killed.

However, at the same time, their blood and souls were suppressed and being damaged. As time passed, their souls would eventually reach the point where they simply died. This god possession was extremely dangerous, but the power they gained in exchange was extremely terrifying. Ye Ming was unrivaled in this state.

The High Priest, Ma Ruyun, Ling Yunzi, and the other experts joined forces with Mo Nian and the others to fight Ye Ming, but they were still being pushed back.

If it weren’t for the protection of the mother tree and the Life God Tree, they would be in danger of being killed. But even with their full power, Ye Ming was slowly getting closer to the core.

In the distance, three more explosions rang out, and the Nine-Headed Lion, the Alldevil Heavenwalker, and the Blood Fiend Devil Lord’s bodies quivered. The figures of their gods appeared behind them, causing the world to shake.

The three of them had completed the god possession. Thus, everyone’s hearts sank. Even a single Ye Ming already required everyone’s power to slow down. If three more attacked at the same time, there would be no way to block them.

Furthermore, at this moment, the giant egg on the Yin Yang World’s altar began to break. Large pieces of its shell fell.

“Hahaha, the wolf god is waking up!” The Blood Fiend Devil Lord was delighted. Unlike Ye Ming, he hadn’t taken a shortcut to become a Sovereign, so his foundation was solid. Hence, even though he had the god incarnation possessing him, he was mainly the one in control.

The shell broke apart, revealing a giant snow wolf. Its white fur slowly stood on end. At this moment, a terrifying aura rose. It was like an ancient beast had awoken to slaughter all life.

Its aura was terrifying and ominous, making people’s souls quiver. It slowly stood but seemed a bit weak, its body shuddering.

It began to sniff around. It then licked up a piece of its shell and bit down. As a result, a metallic ringing rang out. The shell that was tougher than a divine item was actually crushed and consumed by it.

Its aura grew even more terrifying when it devoured the shell. Its fur grew brighter, making it appear even more divine.

In just a few breaths’ time, it had consumed its entire shell. As it ate the shell, its body went through an immense transformation. It stood, showing taut lines on its body that was filled with wild energy.

However, from the start, it hadn’t opened its eyes. It seemed as if it couldn’t open them.

“Using my blood, I give light to the heavenly wolf god!” The Blood Fiend Devil Lord formed hand seals and spat out a mouthful of blood. It then transformed into two runes that embedded onto the wolf god’s eyelids. “Mighty wolf god, open your eyes! Kill as much as you please on this hunting ground!”

The giant snow wolf slowly opened its eyes. At that moment, Meng Qi let out a startled cry. That gaze… it was incredibly familiar.

The Blood Fiend Devil Lord stood in front of the snow wolf and pointed at the battlefield ahead, shouting, “Mighty wolf god, all the lifeforms ahead of you can be slaughtered as you please! Unleash your-”

BOOM!

Suddenly, the Blood Fiend Devil Lord’s voice was cut off. The snow wolf’s claw fell, slamming into his body. As a result, the earth shuddered and giant cracks spread in every direction, instantly covering half of the Central Plains.

The land was almost shattered, but its power wasn’t the most shocking thing. It was the fact that it would attack the Blood Fiend Devil Lord after awakening.

For a moment, both friends and foes were simply stunned. Even Ye Ming, who was possessed by a god, stared in disbelief at the snow wolf.

When the snow wolf pulled back its claw, the Blood Fiend Devil Lord had vanished. He was dead in both body and soul, not even his corpse remaining. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

“He… died?”
