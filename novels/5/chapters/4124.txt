Chapter 4113 Whetstone

BOOM!

After the impact, the dark domain lord was sent flying by Xu Jianxiong’s spear, while Xu Jianxiong was also forced back a great distance.

The dark domain lord flipped through the air, letting out a furious roar. But to everyone’s surprise, it actually vanished after roaring.

“What…?”𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

The Fullmoon experts were all astonished.

“Race leader, did the dark domain lord flee?”

Xu Jianxiong nodded. “Dark domain lords do not possess intelligence and are unafraid of death. However, once their dark energy is mostly used up, they’ll retreat to their nest to rest. Once it recovers its dark energy, it will return. Cough…!”

“Race leader!”

Xu Jianxiong coughed up blood, horrifying the Fullmoon experts. If something happened to their leader, their Fullmoon race would be doomed.

“Stop screaming. It’s a good thing. I intentionally didn’t use any divine abilities and allowed it to injure me, alright? Thanks to it, the bottleneck that I’ve been stuck at for years has started to loosen. After all, only the threat of death can stimulate my body’s desire to get stronger. That’s why I didn’t kill it. It’s my hope of breaking through. Long Chen, you were thinking the same thing too, right?” Xu Jianxiong looked at Long Chen with a trace of admiration.

Long Chen nodded. “That’s right. Directly killing a powerful opponent is such a waste, as only a powerful opponent can force out my potential. In order to live, I must constantly get stronger. And in any case, you and Uncle Tree are both here. I think I can use this opportunity to force myself to grow. That will prepare me for the monsters at the Sage King Convention.”

“Hahaha, good! A man should have this courage!” Xu Jianxiong laughed. Looking at Long Chen, he felt like he was seeing himself in his youth.

Back then, he was also fearless, doing whatever he wanted to do, being unrestrained. But after becoming the leader of his race, he had to settle down. In everything he did, he had to consider and plan every possibility first.

In truth, a large reason for his bottleneck was related to taking over his position. So, now that he found such a good opponent, he naturally wasn’t willing to kill it.

After a bit, more dark creatures came flooding over from the distance, and in response, the Dragonblood warriors stepped forward. With Xia Chen and Guo Ran holding the line, there was no danger to their lives. After all, one had the grand formation, while the other had the golden crossbow. In this manner, the Heaven Venerate creatures were picked off.

As a result, the Dragonblood warriors fought brazenly, akin to inexhaustible killing machines sweeping through the battlefield, blowing away everything in their way. Before long, the corpses piled up once again.

Long Chen immediately drew those corpses into the primal chaos space. Now, the life energy in the primal chaos space was so dense it was almost liquid. As a result, the medicinal ingredients were growing rapidly. The Moon Tree and Fusang Trees were like withered riverbeds blessed by rain. As they greedily absorbed the life energy, their listless leaves once more glistened. All in all, they grew at a rate visible to the naked eye.

Most exciting of all though was the golden lotus seed. Its light had fully recovered, and it was growing even brighter. Long Chen even saw golden marks appear on top of it.

Although he didn’t know its origins, he knew that it had to be a shocking existence.

Right now, he didn’t know why killing these dark creatures caused the golden lotus seed to change, but he didn’t mind. In this world, there were many things that people could never understand, so he didn’t bother to find out.

“If the Fullmoon race’s warriors had a tenth of their power, who would dare to look down on us?” Watching the Dragonblood warriors fight like wolves and tigers, even the Heaven Venerates were amazed. They couldn’t help sighing.

Although the Dragonblood warriors were only late stage Immortal Kings, their killing power was absolutely astonishing. They always killed their opponents in the most efficient way.

Once, these people even saw two Dragonblood warriors work together to kill a Heaven Venerate dark creature in just three moves.

With their flawless combination, that dark creature was completely led by the nose, its head cut off before it could unleash any of its power.

“Long Chen, may I ask you how you trained your subordinates?” asked an elder of the Fullmoon race.

Long Chen shook his head. “Senior, they aren’t my subordinates but my brothers. They are comrades that I can entrust my life to. Also, the reason we could reach our current height isn’t from training but because we were forced to. The heavens forced us to the brink of death. If we were forced back a single step, we would face a retribution that we could not recover from. So, other than fighting to the death, what else can we do? We want to control our own fates, but we don’t have free resources or powerful backgrounds. The only card we have in our hands is our lives. It can be said that everything we have was won through risking our lives. You envy us, but how can we not envy you as well? If one had a choice, who would be willing to risk their lives all the time? Who wouldn’t want to live a peaceful life?”

Long Chen looked at the Dragonblood warriors fighting and couldn’t help feeling a bit helpless. This was a helpless world. Since they had chosen to challenge fate, they had to fight to the end, until one day their lives truly were in their own hands and not arranged by others.

The experts of the Fullmoon race were all moved by his words, and they also considered his words carefully. In theory, the Fullmoon race had always been working hard to rise once more. But had they really been working hard? Or did they just say it with their mouths?

Just over four hundred Dragonblood warriors were absolutely slaughtering the endless dark creatures. The power that each of them unleashed made even the old fellows feel a chill.

However, the Dragonblood warriors’ skills were not something that they were born with. They were all acquired through risking their lives. Behind their fierce and undefeatable appearance was an incalculable amount of hardwork and blood.

Compared to them, the Fullmoon race’s disciples were like privileged children, flowers raised in greenhouses. They had not experienced the frost and wind, so how could they truly grow?

“Race leader…” One of the elders turned to Xu Jianxiong.

“Go!”

Xu Jianxiong knew what they wanted. They were envious of how powerful the Dragonblood warriors were and wanted their disciples to endure a trial of blood and fire as well.

Previously, the Fullmoon race had always focused on reducing casualties as much as possible. But while that kept their population high, it reduced the quality. It didn’t mean that the Fullmoon race was inferior to before, but they were so afraid of losses that they made their disciples experience too little, resulting in their people not growing up into true experts.

As a result, the peaceful lives of the Fullmoon race’s disciples came to an end, as they were all sent to battlefields to fight.

The Dragonblood warriors fought for six full hours. Toward the end, their arms were numb, and it was only when they couldn’t swing their swords any longer that they retreated to the formation.

Thankfully, Xia Chen’s formation had shocking defensive power. As long as no Heaven Venerates reached it, it was simply impossible to shake it.

However, even if Heaven Venerates appeared, they would be killed by Xia Chen and Guo Ran’s combined forces. When the Dragonblood warriors recovered, they would continue killing.

On the other hand, Long Chen didn’t participate in the battle, honing his power the entire time. Other than occasionally cleaning the battlefield, his attention was focused on the depths of the battlefield.

Suddenly, Long Chen stood up. His Kunpeng wings then spread, and he shot out.

“Uncle Tree, Uncle Xiong, help me hold the line. If I’m in danger, please save my little life.”
