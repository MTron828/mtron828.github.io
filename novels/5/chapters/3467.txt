Chapter 3456 Xu Zixiong's Barbarian Blood Power

Of everyone that had undergone tribulation, only Bai Shishi, Qin Feng, and Qi Yu were awake. The others were still asleep.

They had severely overdrafted themselves. Fortunately, Qin Feng and Qi Yu were Dragonblood warriors with strong bases and firm wills, so they woke up sooner than the others.

However, for the others, those ancient corpses had brought fear, and then the pain of the forced lightning tempering had also injured their minds. They needed to rest longer.

After all, not every person was like the Dragonblood warriors and had experienced so many trials and torments, creating a will as firm as a boulder.

“Martial-uncle.”

When Long Chen entered the training hall, the first person he saw was Luo Changwu going through the disciples, checking on them one by one.

Luo Changwu had stayed here this whole time. Long Chen had already told everyone to respect him and view him as another member of the seventh branch academy. They couldn’t neglect him.

Thus, Luo Changwu had almost absolute authority to come and go around. However, he had remained here this entire time.

Every day, every few hours, he would investigate the bodies of the Luo family’s disciples. Every single time he did so, his emotions would stir and wouldn’t settle for a long time.

This time, these children had truly transformed because of this tribulation. Every single one of them had managed to awaken their ancestral bloodline under the pressure of death, which meant their potential had been excavated to the limit. If he hadn’t personally witnessed it, he still wouldn’t believe it.

Even now, he felt like he was dreaming. He was afraid that he would wake up and everything would return to as it was before the tribulation.

When Long Chen arrived, Luo Changwu hastily rose, but Long Chen pressed him down and sat beside him.

“Martial-uncle, it seems that you don’t trust me,” said Long Chen, seeing the lines of blood in Luo Changwu’s eyes. He was clearly worried and anxious.

“How can you say that? Is this not because I’m worried that this group of disappointing children won’t be able to endure?” Luo Changwu laughed awkwardly.

He truly was worried. These disciples had their minds and spirits in chaos after the tribulation. Moreover, the flames of their souls had almost been extinguished. In other words, they were only the slightest bit more alive than dead people.

Compared to other families, the Luo family cared more about every member of their family. It wasn’t simply caring more about those with the most talent. Every descendant was like their own child, and they had to be cherished. 

Thus, seeing all these children in this half-dead state, as the head of the family, he was naturally worried. But as time passed and they recovered, he stopped worrying.

After the worry came excitement. Every time he checked, he found that these children’s bodies had strengthened a bit. After the storm of worry came joy. Even as an Immortal King, these tumultuous emotions were difficult to endure. That was why Luo Changwu seemed so weary.

“I already told you. The academy’s Elders are here, so there’s no need for you to worry,” said Long Chen.

“I know that the Elders are trustworthy. But how can I leave my family’s disciples for others to look after?” said Luo Changwu.

This was the most exciting time of his life. Enduring through this was the least he could do.

Long Chen then looked toward the distant Bai Xiaole whose face was pale white. He had clearly overdrafted his soul greatly.

After all, his physical body wasn’t strong, so the lightning tempering was many times more painful for him than others.

When Long Chen checked on him, he saw that his physical body had fully recovered. Only his soul was still badly damaged.

According to the elder beside him, Bai Zhantang and his two wives had just left. Bai Xiaole’s mother wanted to help Bai Xiaole recover but was stopped by Bai Zhantang. Unable to endure seeing her son in this state while she was powerless to help, she then left.

Long Chen nodded. Bai Xiaole needed to recover on his own because external forces would spoil his current condition. Even the gentlest energy could have an influence.

However, Bai Xiaole was indeed in a dangerous state. His soul was on the verge of collapse. Thus, his soul and will had to struggle, drawing out all their power to protect their master from dying.

If someone were to help Bai Xiaole in this state, it would be like throwing him a lifejacket. He would quickly pass through this moment.

However, that would cause him to lose out on this tempering opportunity. Long Chen hoped for Bai Xiaole to create a lifejacket for himself without anyone saving him. What was important wasn’t the lifejacket but the ability to create one.

Long Chen then fed Bai Xiaole a medicinal pill. This pill guaranteed that the flame of his soul wouldn’t extinguish, but it was only a final barrier. If he wanted to wake up, he would need to rely on himself.

If within ten days he still didn’t awaken, then someone would be forced to intervene to wake him up. Otherwise, he really would die.

“Boss…”

Just then, Xu Zixiong woke up. After waking up, he felt full of energy, and his mind and body were in top condition. In fact, it felt like he had so much power that he would explode.

His current state made everyone jump. Xu Zixiong’s aura was even more terrifying than Qin Feng and Qi Yu’s now. This was completely unexpected to everyone.

“Barbarian blood energy?”

Long Chen was also surprised. Long Chen sensed an aura that was somewhat similar to Wilde’s from Xu Zixiong. This was the aura of the Barbarian race. He hadn’t expected this tribulation to cause Xu Zixiong’s Barbarian blood to show signs of returning to its ancestral state.

The Barbarian race was a species from the primal chaos era. Legend had it that despite appearing similar to the human race, they were not the same. The Barbarian race didn’t cultivate divine abilities. In this case, they were a bit similar to the demonic beast race, relying on bloodline inheritances.

However, their power was such that they shook the ten thousand races. Legend had it that in the primal chaos era, the giant Barbarian race could move mountains and overturn seas with a wave of their hands. Even dragons and phoenixes were their food.

Although Xu Zixiong had a trace of Barbarian blood, it was so diluted that it was almost gone. It was like a candle about to extinguish.

However, after this tribulation, the candle was revitalized. Moreover, it was no longer a candle but a prairie fire. This was something that Long Chen hadn’t anticipated.

Long Chen then pressed a hand against Xu Zixiong’s shoulder. His vast energy erupted in an instant.

As a result, Xu Zixiong was caught off guard and coughed up blood. Bai Shishi, Luo Changwu, and the other Elders present jumped in shock, not knowing what was going on.

Xu Zixiong’s head buzzed. The threat of death instantly activated all the power within him.

Xu Zixiong’s body quivered and countless runes on it lit up. Following that, his body began to grow. It was like a wild beast was awakening within his body. His power crazily climbed.

“Remember this state and this feeling. This is called the Barbarian Blood Battle Body. Starting today, it is your strongest move.”

Long Chen pressed down once more on Xu Zixiong and smiled. He had misjudged this fellow. His potential was truly not bad. At this moment, a new fierce general had appeared in the Dragonblood Legion!𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com
