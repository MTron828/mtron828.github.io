Chapter 2766 Killing Move

The devil race’s Emperor was covered in cracks, looking to be on the verge of exploding.

“All Manifestations Are the Devil!”

Suddenly, the army of the devil race roared in unison, and devil qi exploded out of every single one of them. As they chanted some kind of scripture, a rune lit up on their foreheads. After that, the cracks appearing around their Emperor’s body quickly healed. In just a few breaths’ time, the cracks vanished.

“Idiot! Your broken coin can’t kill me!” sneered the devil race’s Emperor.

His devil qi was now linked with the devil qi of the entire devil army. With that, he managed to resist the allure of the Major World Golden Coin.

“You are wrong. What will kill you is not me, nor is it the Major World Golden Coin. It is yourself,” said Ma Ruyun. Upon forming hand seals, the Major World Golden Coin began to slowly rotate.

At that moment, every lifeform, including those from the Martial Heaven Continent and the other worlds, felt a bout of dizziness.

As a result, the devil race’s Emperor coughed up a mouthful of blood. The pressure he felt instantly multiplied, and the desires that had been suppressed erupted. His body once more became covered in cracks.

As for the devil race’s army, their bodies also shuddered. They were clearly affected as well. However, now that their power was linked, they could not pull back. Otherwise, if their Emperor died, it would be an unbearable blow to their race.

Their souls were connected to their Emperor in order to share his burden. It was essentially spreading the power of the Major World Divine World so that they each shared the burden.

Ma Ruyun couldn’t help sighing. “As businessmen, we don’t like killing. This idea was Long Chen’s, so don’t blame me when you die.”

Suddenly, the Major World Golden Coin’s inner square quivered and countless figures appeared. Those figures all had a mark on their foreheads, and it was a golden Devil character.

Yue Xiaoqian appeared, leading the experts of the original devil race. As they had been accumulating their power for a long time, the Devil Suppressing Divine Seals on their foreheads thrummed with power. On the other hand, the devil race’s Emperor was filled with fear. He let out a terrified roar, “No!”

Divine light descended, falling onto his body. As a result, his devil qi became stagnant. Even with the entire devil race’s army gathered together, he was temporarily suppressed.

A few breaths’ time might not be anything significant during normal times, but now it was fatal. Without the support of his army, his body instantly inflated.

BOOM!

As his body exploded, devil qi and essence blood blasted apart the golden coins. Even the Major World Golden Coin was blasted back. Because of the powerful impact, the entire Martial Heaven Continent shuddered, and the water of the Martial Heaven Sea-Ring burst, forming a tsunami in the air. It then crashed down on mountains and submerged cities.

If the commoners of the Martial Heaven Continent were not being protected at the core, it was unknown just how many people would have died here.

The devil race’s army was also implicated. Their heads exploded, and only a bit more than ten commanders survived due to not participating.

“Bait reinforcements and then kill them all. Ugh, this kind of move is not for business.” Ma Ruyun shook his head. This move of Long Chen’s was truly vicious. When Long Chen had learned of the Major World Golden Coin, he had come up with three tactics involving it and the original devil race in countering the devil race.

The tactic that they had used this time was one of those three. Originally, Long Chen hadn’t had much hope for this plan because it required a certain amount of luck. He felt that his luck would never be that good.

The other two tactics would be slightly less effective, but if done properly, they could still instantly wipe out a quarter of the devil race’s combat power.

What Long Chen hadn’t expected was that since he had only come up with the plan, while the main character was actually Ma Ruyun, there was no bad luck. Ma Ruyun was a wealthy and lucky man, not someone cursed with abysmal luck like Long Chen.

At this moment, the bodies of the devil race’s army fell from the sky, and everyone could only stare in stunned silence. Even Ma Ruyun himself shuddered. This blow was truly vicious, so vicious that it made him uneasy. After all, he was a businessman, not a killer. For all these lives to be destroyed because of him…

“Wealth God, bear witness. Disciple does not have a slaughtering heart…” prayed Ma Ruyun.

Suddenly, the Martial Heaven Continent shuddered along with the divine families’ immortal palace, the devil race and the demonic beast race’s altars, and the Blood race’s giant egg. The land began to rapidly rise once more.

“Not good! Too many were killed in an instant! Their blood soul power is too much!” Ma Ruyun’s expression suddenly changed.

Zi Yan’s zither music possessed a strange power that caused the blood soul power from the dead to dissipate, meaning that the Heaven Devastating Bracelet and the altars of the others couldn’t absorb that power.

However, this blow had been too vicious. They had killed too many, and her zither music was not able to remove it all. Since that was the case, a huge amount of power filled the air, providing the Heaven Devastating Bracelet and the altar endless energy.

As a result, the earth exploded as the Heaven Devastating Bracelet contracted, seemingly wanting to crush the world.

As for Long Chen, he was still chasing down Ye Ming who was fleeing like a rat. His entire body was covered in blood, and Long Chen was constantly landing more blows on him.

Just as the devil race’s army was wiped out, the Corrupt God Cemetery’s space exploded. Resentful Death City finally pierced the walls of space and entered the Martial Heaven Continent.

In that instant, Ye Ming’s Sovereign crown became fully solid and golden. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

“Hahaha, finally!” Ye Ming suddenly roared and a qi wave exploded out of his body. It was so powerful that Long Chen was blown back a few miles.

Upon seeing this, Long Chen’s heart shuddered. Ye Ming’s aura had changed. Originally, Ye Ming could be considered to have reached half a step into the realm of a divine Dao. But now he was fully within it.

“Be suppressed!”

Ye Ming suddenly smashed a palm at Long Chen, which caused the world and its laws to crumble. Fragments of spacetime flew.

This was the true power of a Sovereign, the power that a Sovereign should possess. With a single blow, heaven and earth collapsed.

BOOM!

Even with his full power, Long Chen was sent flying back. It felt like he had been struck by a star, and he coughed up a mouthful of blood.

Stamping on the ground, he stabilized himself. “Not good. I don’t have enough power to use the true Six Star Battle Armor. Without it, I can’t fight against a true Sovereign.”

“Long Chen, I will pass my final bit of energy to you and help you become Sovereign.” Suddenly, a message rang out in Long Chen’s mind.
