Chapter 3650

When they heard of the Heavenly Soul Lock Talisman, all the experts’ expressions changed. They stared at Xia Chen in horror.

The Heavenly Soul Lock Talisman was rumored to be an ancient secret art. Almost all the major sects had records of the Heavenly Soul Lock Talisman, but none of them were able to replicate it.

The legend had it that it was one of the highest core techniques of a talisman cultivator. When a person’s soul energy reached a certain limit and was even recognized by the soul of the Heavenly Daos, with their mental energy, they could control talismans from immense distances.

Moreover, those talismans could be their own or others. Legend had it that at the highest realm, a single thought could kill millions of experts.

Even in the desolate era, when the human race finally climbed up and produced endless heavenly geniuses, only a few people had reached the realm of the Heavenly Soul Lock Talisman. As for after that ancient battle, this kind of divine art basically became a legend. Whether or not it was even true was a question.

But Xia Chen was able to cause that person’s talismans to detonate from across space with just a shout. That was clearly the effect of the Heavenly Soul Lock Talisman. Thus, people were aghast.

If Xia Chen even comprehended the Heavenly Soul Lock Talisman, then… People couldn’t help looking at Gongsun Xuan. They finally formed a bit of doubt about his words.

Xia Chen was a peerless genius. Even the Heavenly Soul Lock Talisman that had befuddled the talisman world for countless years was solved by him. Then it seemed that solving an ancient talisman and creating an unprecedented talisman was also not that difficult for him.

On the other hand, Gongsun Xuan hadn’t made any advancements in so many years. For him to suddenly become a Heavenly Talisman Master truly did seem suspicious.

Quite a few people put away their disdainful expressions and grew cautious. They stealthily fell back. Those crafty fellows felt like they had caught a scent of something out of the ordinary.

Xia Chen glared at Gongsun Ziyi. “I was very grateful to you for how well you treated me. I have always repaid kindness with kindness, enmity with enmity. You supported me, helping me in my cultivation. In return, I helped you solve so many talismans of the ancient era. You could have become Talisman Grandmasters any time you wanted. I’ve already repaid you for what you gave me. As the favors between us are done, let us discuss our enmities. You told me to open the sacred land and set up a trap when I did so, trying to take my body and spirit root. There’s nothing good to say about that. Today, only one of us can live to see tomorrow’s sun.”

Xia Chen clenched his teeth. Every word he said contained a powerful conviction. He was innately a kind person, but when a kind person was taken advantage of, they became a ferocious beast. The current him only had hatred in his heart. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

Gongsun Ziyi shivered and felt a chill in her soul. She had never thought that the always-refined and amiable Xia Chen would suddenly become a wild devil.

“Hmph, such big words mean nothing! You have no proof. Whatever lies you make, they are baseless! Your lies will be uncovered later. Now that the grand formation has been activated, the three of you won’t be able to escape even if you grow wings! Are you slandering me before your death just to disgust me?!” sneered Gongsun Ziyi, forcing herself to remain calm.

“Won’t be able to escape even with wings?” Xia Chen raised his head and laughed. “You’re right, even with wings, you won’t be able to escape. Do you still remember? I told you that I was in the midst of studying the desolate era’s Yin Yang Heaven Sealing Talisman. Why don’t you open your eyes and look more closely? What is that talisman on the top of the formation?”

Everyone curiously looked up. They suddenly noticed that at some point, a giant translucent diagram had appeared there.

It was a Yin Yang Taiji diagram. However, because it was very translucent, it couldn’t be seen without looking closely. That Taiji diagram slowly spun and that spinning seemed to contain the cadence of life.

This Taji diagram didn’t give off any aura or pressure. It didn’t seem powerful at all.

However, all those that saw it had their expressions change. Legend had it that the Yin Yang Heaven Sealing Talisman was capable of sealing an entire world. Other than the actual master, no one could break it.

Unless you could exhaust an entire world’s power, there was no way to forcibly break it. But if you did exhaust the world’s power, it would collapse, and everyone inside would die with the world.

“Don’t worry, my Yin Yang Heaven Sealing Talisman has less than a hundredth of the original talisman’s power. It can’t contain an entire world. It can’t even contain the entire Hidden Dragon Prefecture. But it has enough power to control the Spirit Rune Pavilion’s grand formation. All the formations within the Spirit Rune Pavilion have lost their effect, and their power is absorbed by the Yin Yang Heaven Sealing Talisman. If you want to leave, you’ll need to break the Yin Yang Heaven Sealing Talisman. But if you do, all of that power will explode along with the Spirit Rune Pavilion’s three hundred and sixty thousand formation disc foundations. Then everyone inside here will be blasted to smithereens,” sneered Xia Chen.

Naturally, the three of them had come prepared. Gongsun Xuan had set down a heaven-encompassing net for Xia Chen, but Xia Chen seemed to be worried that the net wasn’t strong enough, so he added another unbreakable layer.

“It seems that you have confidence in yourselves!” said Gongsun Xuan. His voice was still calm as if everything was under control.

“Of course. We’re full of confidence.” Long Chen finally spoke.

Xia Chen was too angry at this moment, so Long Chen had no choice but to step in. This child was too emotional, and it might affect the fighting in a moment.

Gongsun Xuan finally looked at Long Chen. He indifferently said, “I forgot about you since you weren’t saying anything. I didn’t expect the number one academy of the nine heavens and ten lands to make a child like you dean.”

Long Chen smiled. “The future of the immortal world belongs to the young. As for old men like you who refuse to die, you act sanctimoniously while holding a belly of evil tricks. It really is a misfortune for the Spirit Rune Pavilion to be led by a pavilion master who robs men and prostitutes women! A shame, such a shame!”

“How is it a shame?” snorted Gongsun Xuan disdainfully.

“It’s a shame that the Spirit Rune Pavilion could be so lucky as to survive the battle of the desolate era only to end in such a peaceful era. Don’t you feel that it’s a shame?” asked Long Chen.

“Haha!” Gongsun Xuan laughed. “Big words! You want to destroy my Spirit Rune Pavilion? Little brat, you don’t even know that your death is at hand. Laughable.”

“You say that my words are big? I feel like you’re the one saying big words. You’re even more arrogant than me. Those who say that my death is at hand have long since gone to see a Yama King. Let’s stop wasting time with words and acts. Weren’t you precisely stalling to mobilize other forces? If you use some old fellows and attack together, you can reduce the damage here to a minimum. Don’t worry, I will give you ample time. Even if all of you attack at once, it’s no problem. I already gave all of you your chance to survive. If you can’t grasp it, don’t blame me. I don’t mind killing everyone in the formation. It doesn’t matter what trump card you have or what sinister scheme you cooked up. Bring them all out. Today, us three brothers will show you what it means for schemes to be absolutely meaningless in front of real power.” Long Chen’s gaze swept over the crowd grandly.

“You really do say big words! Pavilion master, I’m sorry, but I can’t wait any longer. This Long Chen’s head is mine!”

Ji Wuying finally lost patience. His figure suddenly vanished from his original location.
