Chapter 3018 Terrifying Junior Brother

Long Chen himself was stunned. He saw that one of the Heavenly Stone Spirit race’s giant’s arms was covered in cracks as if it would shatter at any moment.

He was unable to beat this terrifying giant, so he had used the primal chaos bead’s power. His goal had only been to show his power to prove that if they were in the same realm, he could defeat him. Although there was a hint of cheating, after all, the primal chaos bead was still part of his power.

However, he hadn’t expected the consequences to be so severe. The giant’s arm was almost destroyed.

“Is your arm alright? Are you alright?” asked Long Chen hastily.

“Master, don’t worry. I’m fine.” Even as the giant spoke, his arm’s runes came to life, moving across his arm and healing the cracks.

Seeing that he was fine, Long Chen relaxed. He felt even greater shock at the primal chaos bead’s power.

Currently, he was unable to control its power. He had to draw in other people’s power to disturb it into a counterattack if he wanted to use it.

On the Martial Heaven Continent, he had drawn in the Heaven Devastating Bracelet, provoking the primal chaos bead. It unleashed a single attack that destroyed it without even giving it a chance to fight back.

Just now, he had done the same with this giant’s power. Thankfully, that giant’s power didn’t contain any malice. The primal chaos bead merely reflected the power. Otherwise, if it was angered, the primal chaos bead might have just killed the giant.

Long Chen still understood far too little about the primal chaos bead. This mysterious bead he had obtained in the mortal world’s Jiuli secret realm was still hiding countless secrets.

“Wait a moment. Jiuli secret realm, Jiuli immortal characters? Jiuli race? Could it be…” Long Chen suddenly had a thought. Was the primal chaos bead related to the mysterious Jiuli race?

Long Chen had come into contact with quite a few ancient immortal characters. It was difficult for him to comprehend other kinds of immortal characters, but he found it very easy to learn Jiuli immortal characters. Perhaps they were connected.

“Master, please place the slave mark.” The Heavenly Stone Spirit race’s giant finally opened its mouth when he saw Long Chen’s bewildered expression.

“No need. I trust you.” Long Chen recovered his wits and shook his head.

This simple and honest giant made Long Chen think of Wilde. He felt him to be very pitiable. He had been tricked here and been in slumber for so long, and yet he still had to keep his promise. He was so foolish that it hurt his heart. He was just like Wilde.

“No, part of the promise is for you to place a mark. I will then help you out once. Only then will the promise be fulfilled,” said the giant.

Long Chen rolled his eyes. As expected of the Stone Spirit race. Even his head was made of stone. There was no bending.

Long Chen was already aware of his temperament. If he didn’t place a slave mark, he wouldn’t listen. Not wanting to waste the time, Long Chen directly placed a spiritual mark.

“This is…” This spiritual mark stunned the giant.

“You trust me, and I trust you. This equal contract leaves my life in your hands and your life in my hands,” said Long Chen with a smile.

This mark connected their souls. Either side could kill the other now. It was truly something that could only be done between two people with utmost trust in each other.

“Thank you.” The giant knelt on one knee and carried out an extremely ancient form of etiquette towards Long Chen. That was the highest expression of respect in the Heavenly Stone Spirit race.

“That’s enough. There’s no need for us to be so courteous to each other. Don’t call me master either. Although you’ve lived countless years, you’ve experienced too little. I won’t stand on courtesy. You can call me brother San,” said Long Chen unashamedly.

“Brother San!”

The giant instantly called him brother.

For such a terrifying existence to call him brother, even Long Chen felt pride.

“What’s your name?”

“I have no name. When I was born, my people told me to go out for tempering. After condensing the king crystal, I have to return to my race and be bestowed a name by our leader. However, I encountered Ying Lu not long after I went tempering, then I lost my bet with him and was stuck here. Actually, I really want to return home and see my father and mother. They’re definitely worried after not seeing me for so many years,” said the giant sadly. He no longer seemed like an expert, but a child that had gotten lost.

“Don’t worry. Once we get out, I’ll help you return home,” said Long Chen.

He felt a bit of disdain for that Ying Lu. That fellow had actually taken advantage of such an innocent soul. He was absolutely shameless.

“Come. Don’t resist. I’ll bring you to my spiritual space,” said Long Chen.

The giant nodded. Since their souls were connected, he suddenly vanished. He was now in Long Chen’s vast spiritual space.

In the distance, he saw a giant gate. Even compared to his giant form, he was tiny in front of that gate.

A star shone within the gate. That was the Divine Gate Star. The giant suddenly said, “I feel like I’ve seen that star before.”

Long Chen jumped in shock. “Do you know where you saw it?!”

“Let me think… It seems… at the top of the divine statue, there’s a star diagram. That star seems a bit similar to this star,” said the giant.

Long Chen was delighted. It seemed that this stone statue actually contained its own world. They were at the bottom of the statue, but the top also had its own space.

This giant had an innate divine ability, the Heaven Merging Eyes. He was capable of seeing through space. This world was practically transparent to it. That was why the person from the Starry River Sect had called him the Heaven Merging Stone Spirit.

Hearing this, Long Chen immediately rushed out of the fighting ring. Luo Bing and the others’ ears were rumbling, because the roof was still unstable. Chunks of it constantly fell despite the four pillars holding it up. It looked as if it might collapse at any moment. They hadn’t heard anything that Long Chen had said to the giant even after the barrier was broken. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

Seeing Long Chen return safe and sound, and the giant had vanished, everyone was about to ask him what happened when Long Chen directly said, “Let’s go quickly. This place is going to collapse.”

Everyone followed the path forward, and just as they did, the rear shook. The giant fighting ring vanished.

This fighting ring was its own space. Due to countless years passing without anyone watching over it, it was severely damaged. After the impact of the giant, it collapsed.

Long Chen led them to the abdomen of the divine statue. However, he didn’t see a staircase leading up further.

“There is an invisible door on the left. Push it open and it will lead to the top,” said the giant within Long Chen’s spiritual space.
