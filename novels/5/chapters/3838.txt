Chapter 3827 Moon Flame

The Vajra Blood Bat flew into the void, shuttling through this space as lightning.

Long Chen waited and waited. Finally, he swung the Minghong Saber again, striking the Vajra Blood Bat. It was then smashed into the wall again.

Before it could recover, Xia Chen sent a talisman flying out. It then enveloped the Vajra Blood Bat and lit up, turning the bat immobile.Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

After sucking away the primal chaos qi in its body, the talisman flew back. The Vajra Blood Bat’s body hadn’t changed in the slightest.

Long Chen then picked up its corpse and sighed. “The Vajra Blood Bat’s physical body is so powerful that it’s difficult to describe. Fortunately, its body is small. If it grew into an enormous existence, there probably wouldn’t be any lifeform capable of subduing it. Even without primal chaos qi, its physical body remains perfectly intact. That proves that it’s something good-”

Just then, the Ghost Dao lifeform on Long Chen’s shoulder cried out and vanished.

As for the Vajra Blood Bat, it suddenly moved and shot toward Guo Ran, causing him to jump.

“Don’t mess around!” shouted Long Chen. The Vajra Blood Bat flew back into Long Chen’s hand. The Ghost Dao lifeform had actually possessed it and intentionally scared Guo Ran.

These Ghost Dao lifeforms were all very playful. They liked to scare whoever was easily frightened. Just now, Guo Ran really had jumped in fright.

“I didn’t expect it to be able to control this Vajra Blood Bat’s body. Furthermore, its speed hasn’t dropped. It seems that this Ghost Dao lifeform might have been a flying lifeform in its life,” said Yue Xiaoqian.

This Ghost Dao lifeform was able to easily control this Vajra Blood Bat’s corpse. They hadn’t expected this. Previously, these lifeforms had been able to control the corpses, but they were only capable of simple movements.

“Good, we’ve gained a helper.” Xia Chen smiled.

This Ghost Dao lifeform seemed to have become much more confident after gaining this body. It actually led the way forward. However, it then suddenly flew back.

Following that, the passageway began to shake. All their expressions changed. Over ten evil corpses were roaring and charging over.

“This fool, how could it drag over so many at once?!” Everyone jumped in horror. The Vajra Blood Bat had instantly disturbed over ten evil corpses.

“There’s no way around it. We can only fight.”

At this moment, Long Chen’s divine ring appeared and the Minghong Saber rumbled. He attacked a lifeform with a pair of wings on its back.

BOOM!

These evil corpses were only in the Immortal King realm. But even so, he had to use his full power just to suppress them.

Just as the lifeform staggered back and prepared to counterattack, a talisman accurately landed on its forehead. It instantly turned still.

Mo Nian also slammed one down with his shovel, and with a flick of his finger, Xia Chen sent a talisman out and sealed it.

Long Chen, Mo Nian, Yue Xiaoqian, and Guo Ran all attacked. They didn’t need to fight these evil corpses directly. All they needed to do was create a chance for Xia Chen to seal them.

However, those lifeforms were too powerful. The five of them used up a great deal of power in order to seal those lifeforms.

“Their physical bodies are way too strong. All of them are simply overflowing with brute power, so they really are difficult to deal with,” said Mo Nian solemnly as he eyed the sealed corpses.

These evil corpses were only in the Immortal King realm. But the five of them still found it taxing to deal with them all.

After all, they were underground right now, and the laws of the Heavenly Daos were different. They were also in a limited space. They didn’t know if they could summon their manifestations in this space, and even if they could, they didn’t know whether or not their manifestations would be suppressed.

Fortunately, these were evil corpses in the Immortal King realm. If they encountered evil corpses at the Divine Venerate realm whose bodies were still perfectly intact like this, that would be too dangerous.

It was unknown how many lifeforms were buried within this heavenly tomb. Previously, the lifeforms in the last tomb had decayed. But the ones here were fully intact. Not even their flesh and blood had withered.

In comparison to the evil corpses that they encountered at the start, these evil corpses were much stronger. There was practically no way to explain their power. It was Mo Nian’s first time feeling a lack of confidence in grave robbing. This was definitely the most dangerous place he had ever come to.

When Xia Chen retracted his talismans, two human corpses instantly turned to dust. But the others didn’t decay at all. Despite having the primal chaos qi extracted from them, their physical bodies remained intact.

Looking at those bodies, Long Chen and the others couldn’t help shivering. Even after so many years, these corpses were still intact. That was terrifying.

Long Chen looked at those corpses and suddenly had a thought. The next moment, his mind entered the primal chaos space. He saw that the wooden door had produced over ten small kernels.

However, what shocked him was that the Wood Foundation Divine Trees inside the primal chaos space were starting to wither. Their life energy seemed to be sucked away.

Moreover, it wasn’t just the Wood Foundation Divine Trees. The medicinal plants he had planted were also starting to wither. Only the Seven Treasure Colored Glass Tree and Heavenly Dao Tree were unaffected.

“These kernels are its sprouts? Are they absorbing all the life energy?” Long Chen’s heart shook. If this was true, wasn’t that too domineering? It seemed that this was the first time such a thing had occurred in the primal chaos space.

While it didn’t dare to touch the Seven Treasure Colored Glass Tree and the Heavenly Dao Tree, the rest of the vegetation here had their life energy forcibly absorbed.

The Devil Eye Water Lilies seemed to be resisting with all their might. However, their leaves were already starting to wilt slightly. They couldn’t stop it.

The Devil Eye Water Lilies were vegetation from the Undying race, so they were incredibly tough. Moreover, they had already reached the sixth tier, equivalent to the human race’s World King realm.

Due to the Wood Foundation Divine Trees reaching their limit, before the Seven Treasure Colored Glass Tree arrived, all the nutrients were absorbed by the Devil Eye Water Lilies, causing them to grow rapidly.

Now that the door was thrown in, in order to be reborn, it crazily absorbed all the life energy in this place. After the life energy in the soil was absorbed, it began absorbing the life of the other vegetation.

With the current state of the Devil Eye Water Lilies, it seemed that they wouldn’t be able to last much longer. At that time, everything within the primal chaos space other than the Seven Treasure Colored Glass Tree and the Heavenly Dao Tree would die.

With a thought, Long Chen grabbed the corpses of those lifeforms and tossed them into the primal chaos space.

When they entered the primal chaos space, the black soil was like a hungry wolf. It instantly devoured those corpses, unleashing a huge wave of life energy. The vegetation in the primal chaos space sucked up this energy like they were on the verge of death.

Most importantly, there was the slightest trace of primal chaos qi left within these corpses. Xia Chen was unable to absorb that final trace, but here, it was unleashed.

The primal chaos qi instantly caused the entire primal chaos space to grow active. Even the golden lotus in the sky seemed revitalized.

Suddenly, a light sound came from the wooden door. A thumb-sized kernel broke open, and a black shoot grew out of it.

That black shoot had just appeared when a clump of black flames enveloped it. The soft shoot was completely immersed in fire.

When this flame appeared, in the distance, Huo Linger suddenly jumped out and ran over.

“This is… the Moon Flame? This isn’t the Fusang Tree, it’s the Moon Tree!” Long Chen’s whole body shook.
