Chapter 3782 On Our Side?

Two giant hands appeared within the nine heavens, and seven stars flowed on top of those palms. Heaven and earth quivered because of this pair of hands.

They were like hands of the heavens, the hands that controlled this world. Even the heavenly tribulation was quivering uneasily. As the hands pulled, a giant tear appeared in the sky.

The prison of lightning pillars also began to creak. As if they had a consciousness, they resisted the power of the hands, and the two were in a deadlock. It was an unbelievable phenomenon.

BOOM!

Suddenly, the giant lightning prison exploded, transforming into a sea of lightning. The heavenly tribulation was forcibly torn apart by those hands.

“You dare to enslave the great nine star line? Who gave you the guts?!”

The nine star heir’s roar pierced through the world, and it seemed to also pierce through the restrictions of spacetime. It was as if he was speaking from the past to the future.

Just then, Kun Tu coughed up blood once more. He was being besieged by six nine star heirs. Even going all-out, he was forced back miserably.

Even without physical bodies, even though only their wills remained, their replicas were still indomitable. Kun Tu finally understood why three thousand nine star heirs could fight one billion Beast Venerates at the same cultivation base. They were truly fierce.

However, Kun Tu was also quite fierce. Going all-out, he gambled his life, exchanging injury for injury. He specifically targeted the pits of their stomachs and killed over ten of them. After absorbing their lightning, his aura grew crazily.

Long Chen was also in danger. He was covered in blood after killing twenty-seven nine star heirs.

What shocked Long Chen was that these nine star heirs didn’t need any weapons. They only used their fists or maybe their feet to attack. Every time they attacked, seven stars would light up on their hands or feet. With that support, they could directly receive Long Chen’s Minghong Saber, causing his hand to bleed from the backlash.

The most difficult thing for Long Chen to endure was that every clash caused their thunderforce to invade his body. It was like oil being poured into his blood. 

If it weren’t for Long Chen’s combat experience as well as Lei Linger helping him absorb that invading thunderforce, he’d have long since been killed.

“Senior, what can I do? Is there any way for me to grow? Otherwise, I’m going to be beaten.” Watching Kun Tu absorbing the thunderforce and rapidly advancing as he fought, Long Chen shouted in his mind.

However, the dragon expert seemed to have vanished. No matter how he shouted, there was no response.

Suddenly, the speaking nine star heir vanished. When he reappeared, he was in front of Long Chen. Seven stars revolved on his hand as he reached toward Long Chen.

Long Chen slashed his saber, but it was easily caught by this hand. His other hand reached for Long Chen’s abdomen.

Long Chen’s body was covered in scales, but they might as well be paper in front of that hand. That hand directly pierced Long Chen’s body.

“Boss!”

Jiang Lei was shocked and immediately rushed over, only to be kicked away by that nine star heir. Despite it clearly being a great distance away, an invisible force sent Jiang Lei flying. He grunted and then smashed into the ground, leaving a giant hole. He was covered in earth.

Long Chen was shocked and enraged. Killing intent exploded out of him, and black runes appeared in his eyes. He prepared to unleash the Purgatory Eyes.

“A variant amongst the nine stars? Walking down the wrong path of the cultivation technique? A weak physical body? Have the nine stars changed? What? My nine star line is now being hunted down like prey?!” Suddenly, the nine star heir spoke. However, his voice only rang out in Long Chen’s mind, but it was not spiritual communication. That voice seemed to come from the FengFu Star.

“AHH!”

The nine star heir roared, his violent killing intent soaring into the heavens. That berserk power directly blew away the other nine star heirs along with Kun Tu and the others.

“How can this be?! How could this happen?!”

That nine star heir seemed to go crazy. Long Chen himself was buffeted by his furious power, and blood poured out of his seven orifices. His physical body was almost torn apart.

However, Long Chen didn’t activate the Purgatory Eyes, feeling a sense of familiarity from this nine star heir. If this person recognized his status, he wouldn’t harm him.

Suddenly, that nine star heir quivered. He muttered, “So that’s the case. No wonder.”

“As fellow nine star heirs, you won’t make things hard on me, right?” probed Long Chen. He also didn’t speak. He tried to communicate with Spiritual Strength, as his status as a nine star heir couldn’t be exposed to the public.

This nine star heir slowly pulled out his hand, and Long Chen’s body could move now. However, there was a large hole in his body where fresh blood poured out. It was a horrifying sight.

“Many-”

Long Chen was about to thank him when multiple nine star heirs appeared around him. They extended their hands, and lightning swords manifested.

Countless lightning swords then stabbed through Long Chen’s body. He instantly became a porcupine.

“AHH!”

Even Long Chen couldn’t help screaming in pain. This thunderforce caused his essence blood to boil. It was a pain that he had never experienced before.

Lei Linger helped him absorb the thunderforce raging in his body. But there was too much, and she was only able to absorb a very small portion of it. The majority of it continued to wreak havoc throughout Long Chen’s body.

“Release my boss!”

Just then, Jiang Lei came flying out, howling. He was covered in blood. That single kick had almost killed him. Despite that, seeing Long Chen in this state, he still came flying back.

As a result, he was immediately surrounded by over ten nine star heirs. Each of them stabbed a lightning sword into his body, turning him into a porcupine as well. These nine star heirs were unbeatable.

“Jiang Lei… don’t be afraid… they’re on our side…” Long Chen transmitted to Jiang Lei. Even though he was screaming in pain, his mind was still clear.

Jiang Lei was also screaming. This thunderforce being injected into his body seemed to be trying to blow him up.

The essence blood of the Beast Venerates within his body was being burned by the thunderforce. His meridians were burning. Although he was in immense pain, he found that as this essence blood was burned away, his meridians were rapidly widening. As the flames burned, he was absorbing their energy. After that, the impurities were erased by the thunderforce, once more purifying his essence blood.

“Your physical body is too weak, so we can only help you do this much. Brother, you have to grow up faster. Don’t lose the face of the nine star line.”

After saying this, all the nine star heirs suddenly exploded, transforming into lightning runes that scattered throughout heaven and earth.Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com
