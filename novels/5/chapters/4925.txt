Chapter 4914 Merger

The devil head was enormous, the size unimaginable to most people. Even after the passage of countless years, it hadn’t rotted. The devil head had two horns and protruding fangs. While its eyes had dried up, it still gave off a dark green light like two lanterns.

The Square Heaven Seal hovered above the devil head, its once imposing size now diminished, resembling more of a crown atop the demonic figure.

Originally, the Square Heaven Seal represented Devil Fall City, but the city had lost its former grandeur. Its buildings lay in ruin, overrun by decay, rendering it a desolate ghost town.

Although Xing Wujiang had prepared himself, when he saw the state of Devil Fall City, he quivered. He was filled with pain.

The Square Heaven Seal was the legacy divine item of the Xing family. Yet, in Xing Wujiang’s generation, it had turned against their family, ultimately leading to the downfall of Devil Fall City. Born and raised within the city, Xing Wujiang held countless memories of its former glory. Devil Fall City had once been the source of his pride and joy. But now…

The devil head halted its advance, lingering at a distance away from the devil corpse, its gaze fixed upon Xing Wujiang. All of a sudden, it opened its mouth.

“Wujiang… it’s me!”

A very gentle voice came out, like a kind woman speaking to her own child. This mother-like murmur was filled with emotion.

“I know it’s you…” Xing Wujiang struggled to maintain composure, but as he spoke, his voice quivered with emotion. His grief surged uncontrollably. To the disciples of the Xing family, the Square Heaven Seal had always been their supreme elder. Hence, its betrayal was something he couldn’t bear to accept.

“My child, don’t be sad. You should be happy for me. I’ve gained control over it. From now onward, I’m going to get stronger and stronger until no one can bully our Xing family. The blood debt will be repaid with blood. I don’t want you to live while bearing the humiliation of our loss. I will restore the Xing family’s honor. Child, believe in me. My feelings for the Xing family have never changed. Come with me, and the name of the Xing family will resound throughout the nine heavens,” said the devil head.

Tears welled in Xing Wujiang’s eyes as he shook his head. “You are no longer the same Square Heaven Seal. Ever since you permitted the four noble families to return, I know you’ve changed. You were unwilling to remain alone, nor were you willing to remain under the control of my Xing family. Perhaps you didn’t feel this way when the Xing family was in its golden era, but now that the Xing family has declined, you no longer wish to guard us. That’s why your first move was to sever my line of descendants. Once I die, you will be free.”

Xing Wujiang’s words weren’t filled with anger; instead, they were actually infused with respect. Despite the Square Heaven Seal’s actions against him, he still held it in the highest regard.

The Square Heaven Seal was silent for a moment before replying, “That was my foolishness. I was enticed by the devil soul. However, I’ve completely suppressed it, and its will can no longer affect me. Now, all that needs to be done is to let the head and body merge, and I will have full control over it. We can enter the great era together and search for the Xing family’s people. Ever since the immemorial battle, the Xing family has been scattered throughout the world. However, I believe they still exist. Wouldn’t it be great to reunite with them?”

The Square Heaven Seal’s voice was gentle and enticing, extremely moving. However, Long Chen was alarmed as every single word contained a bewitching art, aimed at the weakest part of Xing Wujiang’s heart.Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

Long Chen’s heart tensed up. If Xing Wujiang was enticed by the Square Heaven Seal, it would be over. No one would be able to stop the devil corpse from reviving.

Fortunately, Xing Wujiang shook his head. “There’s no point in saying this. Do you recall the Xing family’s ancestral teachings? First, the Xing family’s disciples cannot collaborate with the devil race, and second, they cannot harm the human race. Yet, you’ve absorbed devil energy and merged with it, violating the first law. Furthermore, harnessing the devil corpse’s power to strengthen yourself will undoubtedly result in the deaths of countless humans, defying the second ironclad law…”

The Square Heaven Seal’s voice grew dark and brutal in an instant. “What dogshit laws?! I’ve had enough of them! Has there ever been a true right and wrong in this world? If someone is wrong, it simply means they are weak. As long as you have enough power, whatever you do will be right! Why can’t we slaughter the human race? Do you realize that the majority of the Xing family’s disciples perished at the hands of fellow humans in the immemorial battle? Why were they allowed to betray us, yet we’re forbidden from retaliating? Tell me, why?!”

The Square Heaven Seal’s voice was brimming with resentment and bloodlust. The devil head’s eyes also grew harsh, and the vast devil might started to surge.

Long Chen’s heart shook. At that moment, he felt a resonance with the Square Heaven Seal. Its way of thinking was actually very similar to his own. Like the seal, he also hated betrayal. To seek vengeance for such treachery, he might indeed resort to any means necessary. If he were the Square Heaven Seal, perhaps he might have also chosen such a path.

The Square Heaven Seal continued to shout, “In the world, the strongest faction is the Brahma Pill Valley. You might have been young, but you’ve witnessed the heinous atrocities they’ve done! And then what? How many people still sing their praises? How many of them invert black and white for them? Who dares to criticize them? That includes these people from the Flame Divine Hall. So many people stand by their side despite knowing the truth. When conflict arises, will they show mercy because you’re in the right? Tell me, what defines right and wrong in this world? I simply want to restore the Xing family, to protect the Xing family! Is that so wrong?!”

Xing Wujiang’s face twisted with pain, and he didn’t respond. Yet, as he remained silent, the Square Heaven Seal radiated with a brilliant light. Gao Jianli, Cao Guofeng, and the others’ golden seals trembled and then vanished.

When they reappeared, they were beneath the devil head. Seeing this, Long Chen and Mo Nian tensed up.

Just then, Xing Wujiang suddenly kowtowed to the Square Heaven Seal, stunning it. It delightedly asked, “Have you thought it through?”

“I’m sorry…” Xing Wujiang sobbed.

“Good child, there’s nothing to be sorry about. We—”

“I’m sorry to you… and my ancestors. I was unable to protect you…”

Suddenly, Xing Wujiang’s violet-gold seal exploded, and a rune that looked identical to the Square Heaven Seal appeared between his hands.

Xing Wujiang suddenly made his move, appearing in front of the Square Heaven Seal and slamming his hands down on it.

“Treachery!” The Square Heaven Seal roared. The moment Xing Wujiang’s hands slammed onto it, the entire world shook. The Square Heaven Seal ignited.

Just as Xing Wujiang made his move, Long Chen and Mo Nian shot at the vice hall master.

“Six Forms in One!”

“Thousand Edge Arrow!”
