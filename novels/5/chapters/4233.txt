Chapter 4222 Domineering Ruyan

Countless sharp wooden spears shot out of the ground, tearing through the ranks of the devil experts. Also, those wooden spears seemed to have poison on them. As soon as someone was pierced by them, their body stiffened and fell.

Dozens of devil experts hung on each wooden spear, their lives extinguished.

An area of a hundred thousand miles became a forest of corpses, and it all happened so suddenly. The devil experts had not expected someone to attack them here.

Only a small portion of extremely powerful existences had managed to sense something wrong at the start, and they either blocked or dodged the wooden spears.

“Undying race?! What are you doing?!”

A devil expert roared furiously, suddenly realizing that the area they were passing through was occupied by the Undying race.

Furthermore, these wooden spears had the aura of the Undying race on them. It just couldn’t be faked.

“I’m not doing anything. I just felt like you were displeasing to the eye, so I wanted to clear up my view.” An icy, arrogant voice rang out.

Following this statement, two women appeared in front of them. One was dressed in black, while the other wore a vibrant emerald-green dress. It was the woman in a black dress who had spoken, causing Long Chen’s heart to pound wildly.

The woman in the emerald-green dress was like a beautiful elf queen who had walked out of the depths of a primal forest, possessing a natural and pure aura. Her raven-black hair cascaded down to her waist like a flowing waterfall, and her eyes sparkled like a constellation of stars.

“Chu Yao!”

Long Chen couldn’t help but cry out. This woman was precisely Chu Yao from the Phoenix Cry Empire. The air surrounding her had changed a great deal, but her eyes remained the same.

Chu Yao looked at Long Chen emotionally. Because they were too far, she could only wave as hard as she could to him.

As for the other woman beside her, she looked icy and arrogant. Guo Ran and the others stared at her in shock.

“Is that really Liu Ruyan? How could her aura change so much?”

Guo Ran and the others almost didn’t dare to believe it. Long Chen himself was also unsure if this really was Liu Ruyan. If she wasn’t standing beside Chu Yao, Long Chen wouldn’t have recognized her.

While she was dressed in black, she had an emerald crown on her head, and powerful Undying Qi swirled around her, forming a terrifying force field. Even though she was standing on the ground, she gave off a feeling of being high above and looking down on all others.ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

Furthermore, behind her were countless experts solemnly bowing toward her, and they remained a respectful distance behind the two of them, seemingly very reverent toward both of them.

“Since when did your Undying race lower yourselves to the likes of the human race?!” shouted a devil expert.

“Die!” Liu Ruyan raised her slender hand and clenched it. In an instant, that devil expert’s expression underwent a dramatic shift.

BOOM!

He immediately reacted, slashing his weapon behind him and flying forward.

The next moment, the space around him collapsed. Countless willow branches flew out like serpents, attacking him from every direction. This devil expert’s tough body was like a paste in front of these branches, instantly pierced through.

“AHH!” He let out a terrified shout. After that, three kinds of runes appeared around him, and the aura of a Triple Supreme appeared.

Startled cries rang out. This person was actually a Triple Supreme, but he was unable to block a single one of this woman’s attacks.

Abruptly, his body stopped struggling, and his screams vanished. Every drop of his essence blood was sucked dry.

As the willow branches were retracted, the devil expert’s body fell to the ground and shattered like a fallen statue.

This attack was sudden, bizarre, and terrifying. Even a Triple Supreme was directly killed without the ability to resist.

Furthermore, before dying, he had swung his weapon behind him and fled forward. That meant that his sense of danger had only been triggered from the rear, but that was wrong. Liu Ruyan’s attack had come from all directions. In other words, Liu Ruyan’s attack had even tricked his senses, causing countless people to be terrified of her.

Liu Ruyan slowly pulled back her hand, her face just as icy as ever. “This fellow Long Chen is very dislikable, but you cannot kill him. I will kill anyone who wants to kill him.”

Liu Ruyan’s words were icy and exceptionally domineering. Adding on to how she had just easily exterminated a Triple Supreme, countless people were shaken by it.

“How arrogant, Undying race! Are you declaring war on the great devil race?!” shouted a devil expert.

Another powerful devil expert stepped forward, also a Triple Supreme. However, his wings were golden, and his eyes seemed to emit flashes of lightning. He was definitely an even more powerful existence than the last.

“My Undying race has been arrogant for more than just a few days. If you want war, you can have it. But anyone who wants to kill Long Chen will be slain,” said Liu Ruyan indifferently.

Liu Ruyan’s display was incredibly domineering, leaving no space for the other side to retort. However, the name of the Undying race was truly frightening, so no one wished to offend her.

The Undying race was famous for being difficult to deal with. Furthermore, they were protective of their own members. Not only was their combat power immense, but they also possessed undying bodies that made it extremely difficult to kill him. No one wished to offend them.

“It seems that your Undying Willow race cannot represent the entire Undying race, no? Liu Ruyan, aren’t you overestimating yourself?” Suddenly, a strange voice rang out from within the Undying race’s territory.

This left others befuddled, but Liu Ruyan seemed to not find it strange at all. She didn’t even look at that person and just said, “My Undying Willow race is the emperor race of the Undying race and the overlord of the Undying Demon Forest. As for your Devil Eye Water Lily race, you are nothing more than stray dogs that don’t know honor. If I cannot represent the Undying race, can you?”

Suddenly, the Undying race’s experts opened a path, and a group of experts walked out.

There were men and women amongst them numbering in the millions. Their auras were all powerful, and their gazes were hostile.

“As the time changes, some people cannot keep up. Perhaps the position of the emperor should also be changed.” A woman with a seven-colored lotus hairpin walked forward and sneered at Liu Ruyan.

“Even if we were to abdicate the throne, it wouldn’t go to your Devil Eye Water Lily race’s possession. Even if you give imperial robes to a monkey, a monkey is still a monkey. They don’t have the slightest air of a king,” retorted Liu Ruyan.

It seemed that the two of them were mortal enemies and were very familiar with each other, going straight to the point.

“Hahaha, what can a sharp tongue do? Since you want to protect Long Chen, then my Devil Eye Water Lily race will cut off his head!”

After saying that, millions of Devil Eye Water Lily experts instantly vanished.
