Chapter 4411 Playing This Game?

A giant sword and a giant saber—two giant weapons that looked like they were wielded by gods shattered the sky.

BOOM!

The two immense weapons then exploded at the same time, unleashing a dazzling burst of divine light so intense that onlookers couldn't keep their eyes open.

As their vision was momentarily seized, a wild qi wave blasted them. It was so powerful that even the Eternal experts felt as if they were being torn apart, prompting them to flee into the distance.

However, before they could get far, they were devoured by the terrifying qi wave, akin to ants carried by the tide.

When the dazzling light dimmed and calmness returned to the world, people saw a bottomless abyss. Long Chen hovered in the air above the abyss, panting heavily and covered in bleeding wounds, yet his gaze remained composed.

On the other hand, the giant dragon beneath Netherdragon Tianye had vanished, along with his once overwhelming Blood Qi. His massive form had withered.

Staring in shock at Long Chen, he had never imagined that Long Chen would be able to withstand his attack.

“This is the attack of a Doyen? It isn’t bad.” Long Chen nodded.

It was truly powerful, but it wasn’t beyond reason. If Long Chen had had a good weapon, he wouldn’t have been injured.

On the other hand, Netherdragon Tianye had paid a terrifying price to unleash this attack, exhausting the majority of his essence blood to the extent that even his manifestation disappeared.

Long Chen looked at Netherdragon Tianye and remarked, “This so-called Doyen power involves gathering the power of heaven and earth, usurping the role of the Heavenly Daos to control the world, and merging with heaven and earth to command the laws of the universe. It’s a bit similar to a Saint’s power. No wonder senior Ye Ling said that your full-power attack is equivalent to half the power of a Saint. This force not only carries destructive capabilities but can also compel the laws of the world to yield. The bindings of the Heavenly Daos and a spacetime lock are all encompassed within it. It's no surprise you were able to lock me down. The power of a Doyen is interesting. It’s my first time being locked down by someone in the same realm.”

It was truly Long Chen’s first encounter with such a situation. Normally, even people with higher realms were unable to lock Long Chen down because his soul and will were too strong to be confined.

However, just now, he had been firmly locked down, rendering him unable to dodge. Netherdragon Tianye hadn’t given him any chance to get away. Despite this, Long Chen was not afraid of him in a direct clash.

Still, this realization left Long Chen feeling uneasy. The palace master had advised him to run as far as he could when facing a Saint, and it seemed that this form of restraint was part of the reason. While Long Chen could remain unafraid of Netherdragon Tianye after being immobilized, if he faced a Saint, he would definitely be in trouble.

“Damn human, what are you getting arrogant for?! I’m still not a true Doyen and am simply on the verge of becoming one. Once I truly awaken my fate divine seal and become a Heavenly Doyen, you’ll only be able to kneel beneath me!” roared Netherdragon Tianye, gnashing his teeth and glaring at Long Chen with rancor.

“What a pity. My time is very precious, so I can’t wait for you that long.” Long Chen shook his head and sighed.

“And what does that mean?” asked Netherdragon Tianye coldly.𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

“What else could it mean? Is your head full of crap?” Long Chen couldn’t help but wonder.

He was somewhat curious. Netherdragon Tianye had lost, yet he still appeared fearless. Did he not fear death?

“Do you dare to kill me?” Netherdragon Tianye suddenly thought of something and laughed.

Pow!

Long Chen suddenly vanished and appeared in front of Netherdragon Tianye, sending him flying with another slap.

“Is there anything in this world that I don’t dare to do?”

As lightning wings appeared on Long Chen’s back, he shot after Netherdragon Tianye, slapping the other side of his face.

Pow!

“Didn’t you say that you would destroy my entire family?”

Pow!

“Weren’t you going to destroy my sect?”

Pow!

“Didn’t you call me ignorant?”

Pow!

“Didn’t you call me foolish?

Pow, pow, pow, pow…!

Long Chen delivered a series of resounding slaps to Netherdragon Tianye's face, leaving it a bloody mess.

“Who let you be a traitor?”

“Who let you be arrogant?”

“Who let you act wild?”

Each question was emphasized with a forceful slap. Netherdragon Tianye roared repeatedly but was powerless to resist.

After all, he had just unleashed his strongest technique and was in an extremely weak state. His Blood Qi was now empty. Regarding Long Chen’s slap, while it was sharp and impossible to guard against, its actual killing power was very low. Even after enduring so many slaps, Netherdragon Tianye wasn’t dead or even unconscious.

“You damn human, you dare-?!”

Pow!

“Just you wait-!”

Pow!

Long Chen suddenly stopped slapping and just grabbed his throat, lifting him up. Now, Netherdragon Tianye no longer had any of his former arrogance, looking like a dead dog instead.

Seeing this scene, the experts fighting against the Earth Spirit race abruptly stopped in their tracks and fell back. They just stared at Long Chen in horror. Curiously though, not a single one of them came to help Netherdragon Tianye.

As they gazed at Long Chen, their expressions were marked by sheer terror. Netherdragon Tianye had been decisively defeated, a defeat that left him visibly drained of energy. On the other hand, Long Chen still had immense reserves of power left, highlighting the stark difference between them.

In other words, Long Chen still had the power to fight. Once he joined forces with the Earth Spirit race, they would definitely be crushed, and who knew how many of them would lose their lives then?

Once the combat ceased, the Earth Spirit race also halted their actions and regrouped. They had no choice but to stop. Having been constantly fighting for their lives over the past few days, they were thoroughly fatigued. They would have long since collapsed if it weren’t for their powerful wills.

“If you have the guts… kill me…” spat out Netherdragon Tianye.

The next moment, Long Chen’s hand pierced into Netherdragon Tianye’s chest just like that. Netherdragon Tianye screamed as a palm-sized dragon scale was forcibly ripped off of him—his reverse scale.

“You wanted to play this game with me? I know you wanted to trigger the power inside of this reverse scale when your life was under threat. Quite shrewd, but you forgot that even though I’m not of the dragon race, I possess the dragon race’s inheritance. Furthermore, it is the most primal inheritance of all. Did you think that I wouldn’t see through your scheme?” sneered Long Chen.

Long Chen tossed the reverse scale into the primal chaos space. Runes directly flashed on top of the reverse scale, and a terrifying aura was rising out of it. However, the moment it entered the primal chaos space, it instantly went still.

“You…!”

At that moment, Netherdragon Tianye’s eyes were finally full of terror.
