Chapter 4466 Move Out, Esoteric Spirit World

“If you want to, then go!”

The sweeping elder simply smiled as if he had long since expected this.

With an awkward tone, Long Chen said, “However, with just the Dragonblood Legion’s power, doing such a big thing feels a bit reckless. I need the academy’s support as well.”

“That’s easy. I’ll help you!” The palace master promptly offered his assistance, patting his chest before the sweeping elder could respond.

The sweeping elder then looked at the palace master, but the latter didn’t dare to meet his gaze. The palace master had intentionally said this first so that the sweeping elder wouldn’t be in a good spot to refuse.

The sweeping elder slowly rose and grabbed his broom once more. The two children hastily stood up as well.

As the sound of his sweeping resumed, the sweeping elder said, “There’s always more dust to be swept up. As soon as you’re done sweeping, more dust appears. Sigh, there’s nothing that can be done.”

The palace master was lost. The sweeping elder’s words sounded as though he were talking to himself. Uncertain whether the sweeping elder was displeased with him or expressing agreement, the palace master just stood there in confusion.

“Many thanks!”

On the other hand, Long Chen was delighted. After bowing to him together with the palace master, they left.

When they were on the way, the palace master couldn’t help asking, “What did the sweeping elder mean by that?”

Long Chen smiled. “He meant there’s always trash to clean up in this world. As soon as you’re done cleaning up one batch, another batch is there waiting for you.”

“Then doesn’t that mean cleaning it is meaningless? Is the sweeping elder saying that he doesn’t agree with your decision this time? Does he not want us to waste the effort?” asked the palace master in confusion.

“No, no. Palace master, you are thinking in the wrong direction. If endless dust keeps coming, why does the sweeping elder spend all day cleaning the academy?” asked Long Chen.

“Well…” The palace master fell silent, not knowing how to reply.

“There’s endless dust, and there’s no stopping it. However, this world still needs someone to sweep up the dust. While it looks like they’re working for nothing, as long as they’re here, this world will be relatively clean. The sweeping elder’s broom purifies the academy, as well as people’s hearts and souls. I don’t have such a profound realm, so all I can do is eliminate the trash through brute force. By sweeping the ground, the sweeping elder is subtly telling us what we should do,” explained Long Chen.

“What? If it was such a simple answer, why did he have to make it so complicated?” The palace master found himself at a loss for words. This, he thought, was the distinction between the human race and the dragon race—or perhaps, more broadly, between the human race and all other races. Some humans spoke in such a roundabout way that it left people scratching their heads, irritating others.

Given the palace master’s status, anyone who spoke to him typically got straight to the point, and anyone who didn’t would get a beating. But of course he couldn’t do such a thing to the sweeping elder.

“His words are profoundly aligned with the Heavenly Daos, encompassing many levels. They are enough to cultivate to the pinnacle of the Dao and measure the ten thousand laws of the world. If we were to try to comprehend them, we could come up with countless meanings. However, I’m too foolish to understand more than the most basic meaning. Hehe, but in any case, he’s agreed to our new mission,” explained Long Chen.Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

“Your human race makes things too complicated. My dragon race has a simpler approach. Power is the ultimate arbiter, not words,” the palace master remarked, shaking his head.

“I approve of that too.” Long Chen nodded.

Compared to the dragon race’s cultivation method, the human race’s techniques were incredibly complicated and obtuse. Worst of all, the more profound the principle, the less clearly it could be explained.

The dragon race operated differently. Their divine abilities were handed down through generations, and the younger generation just had to briefly study them.

In contrast, the human race did possess bloodline inheritances, but magical arts couldn't be transmitted through the bloodline alone. They had to be studied and comprehended on your own.

There was a difference between bloodline inheritance and comprehending things on your own. If your comprehension was lacking, you would be unable to inherit your ancestors’ magical arts. In other words, if the humans were too lazy, they would be doomed. Thus, the human race’s inheritances were many times more complicated than other races, but that also had its advantages. This meant that these magical arts could be passed down through secret tomes.

Furthermore, these magical arts did not have stringent bloodline requirements. Some of them could be used regardless of bloodline.

Even some magical arts that were already extinct could be revived as long as they were recorded, giving future generations the chance to unlock them. This was something that other bloodline inheritances could not replicate.

To sum it up, every single race had to have its own advantages to be able to survive to this point. Otherwise, they would have long since been washed away by the river of time.

The dragon race possessed its own set of advantages, while the human race had its distinct strengths. It was challenging to determine which was superior or inferior; each had its merits.

“Are you ready?”

The palace master and Long Chen arrived at the Dragonblood Legion’s residence. At this moment, the five thousand-plus Dragonblood warriors had already gathered, as had millions of the Earth Spirit race’s army under Ye Ling’s command.

What shocked the palace master was Ye Xue. She was standing beside Ye Ling, and Heavenly Dao runes were flowing around her as if prostrating toward her. She had clearly become an awakened Doyen.

“No wonder you’re in such a rush to attack the Esoteric Spirit World. So you already have a true Doyen,” said the palace master.

Ye Ling said, “In truth, It’s a bit hasty for us to attack now. But Dean Long Chen said that the faster the better.”

Long Chen nodded. “Helping the Earth Spirit race reclaim the Esoteric Spirit World is crucial. Furthermore, I trust that those fellows in the Esoteric Spirit World are aware of our intentions and are starting to prepare. If we are too slow, they might be fully prepared by the time we are ready. Hence, striking while the iron is hot is better. Before the impact of killing Netherdragon Tianzhao is gone, we will strike the Esoteric Spirit World. However, according to race leader Ye Ling, the Esoteric Spirit World has two Saints on their side and even managed to enlist a Saint from another world to force the Earth Spirit race out. To reclaim the Esoteric Spirit World, we will be facing at least three Saints. So I’ve come to ask the palace master’s help.”

Three Saints? I can finally exercise a bit. The palace master’s eyes lit up, and he rejoiced inside. On the outside though, he simply declared, “Leave those Saints to me.”

Hearing that, the Earth Spirit race was delighted. With the palace master’s aid, everything would be easier. Soon, they would make their enemies pay back the blood debt they owed.

“Move out!”

Long Chen gave the order, and an army of millions charged out of the High Firmament Academy, heading straight for the Esoteric Spirit World.

This time, he had no intention of moving secretively. He brazenly swaggered right up to the Esoteric Spirit World, startling countless experts on the way who then quickly spread the word.

“We’ve arrived!”

When they reached the gates to the Esoteric Spirit World, the expressions of the Earth Spirit race’s experts changed. That was because these gates had been sealed shut by a barrier.
