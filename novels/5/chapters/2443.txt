Chapter 2433 Flow of Time

Translator: BornToBe

“There’s no need to panic. The ten days I am referring to is the time that will pass on the Martial Heaven Continent. The flow of time within the Star Field Divine World is different from ours. If it hadn’t been ruined, the time proportion would have been a thousand to one based on the ancient records. The flow of time is much faster inside of it. It can be considered just like when you use a transportation formation. The longest transportation formations of the Martial Heaven Continent can make it feel like several minutes have passed while you sit in it, but in reality, not that much time will have passed. Although the damage to the Star Field Divine World has altered the flow of time, ten days on the Martial Heaven Continent will be like a year within the Star Field Divine World. That is the only reason we dare to let all of you inside. Otherwise, we wouldn’t dare to send the continent’s greatest forces inside at such a dangerous time,” said the Pill Doyen.

This explanation made people relax. One year was a decent amount of time at least. Ten days wasn’t enough to do anything.

The various questions inside people’s hearts had been answered. They were now itching to enter. Their worries about the Sovereign seals breaking while they were inside were also settled.

Only now did they realize that the divine families had taken that into consideration from the start. Furthermore, the seniors from the divine families would most likely be standing guard over the dangerous areas on the continent during this time.

“Once you enter the Star Field Divine World, it will be recorded by the laws inside. When time is up, you will be automatically transported outside. Of course, this only refers to those still alive. The dead will not be coming back. Prepare yourselves. Enter your optimal states. The Star Field Divine World is in constant flux, so no one can predict where you will end up upon entering. If your luck isn’t good, you might just fall into a spatial crack and be instantly devoured,” said the Pill Doyen gravely.

“What…?” That dumbfounded quite a few people. This was all dependent on luck? If they really did end up right inside a spatial crack, that would be far too unlucky. No power would save them then.

“That is why it is said that luck is also a kind of power. Draw lots to decide who will enter first. Fifty thousand people can enter at a time, so the various powers will have to enter in batches. The heads of each power should come up to draw the lots,” said the Pill Doyen.

“Lingshan, you should go for me,” said Long Chen to Ye Lingshan. He then turned to the warriors of the Martial Heaven Alliance. “Everyone, form up into teams of fifty thousand. I will make arrangements in a bit. Don’t worry about the spatial crack; the chances of that happening are very low. The karmic luck of fifty thousand people will make it essentially an impossibility.”

The Pill Doyen’s final words really frightened people. They couldn’t help being apprehensive about their own bad luck, but they were comforted to hear this.

“Big brother Long Chen, what about the Xuan Beasts?” asked Cloud.

Cloud was the current leader of the Xuan Beasts. Although she was powerful, she didn’t have much experience in this regard.

“Go pick lots for now. I’ll arrange things,” said Long Chen.

The Xuan Beasts had been completely unified under the rule of the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow race. Furthermore, due to the Myriad Spirit Diagram, they had been completely won over and no longer held any wariness toward Long Chen. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

When the lots were drawn, the order was the Corrupt path, Pill Valley, the ancient family alliance, the divine families, the Xuan Beasts, the sea demon race, and then the other powers such as the Bloodkill Hall.

Those other powers were not even allowed to pick. This ordering wasn’t actually important. Entering first wasn’t necessarily a good thing, and entering last wasn’t necessarily a bad thing. No one grumbled about it.

“Long Chen, I’ll wait for you inside the Star Field Divine World. I will personally cut off your head.” The Corrupt path walked past, with Tian Xiezi making a throat-cutting gesture at Long Chen.

“Courting death!” This insulting action enraged the Dragonblood warriors.

“Leave it be. A defeated general also dares to say such big words? Save your energy. You should prepare a will and make sure you can die in peace,” said Long Chen lazily.

“You…!” Tian Xiezi was not a match for Long Chen when it came to a battle of the tongues. He was half killed just like this.

“Let’s go. Fighting with words here is meaningless.” The mysterious man beside Tian Xiezi spoke up. Tian Xiezi immediately shut his mouth and walked in. The first batch of fifty thousand Corrupt experts vanished.

Following that, the second batch of Corrupt experts entered. They quickly passed through.

“Dragonblood warriors, split yourselves into teams of five hundred and join the other groups,” said Long Chen.

“Long Chen, won’t splitting up your Dragonblood Legion be dangerous?” asked Ye Lingshan, surprised.

“Don’t worry about it. The current Dragonblood Legion is no longer the old Dragonblood Legion. Five hundred people is the perfect amount. Once we enter the Star Field Divine World, we will use our own special communication method to quickly link up with each other. That’s the best way to preserve everyone’s safety,” said Long Chen confidently.

The current Dragonblood Legion was not only all at the third step of Netherpassage, but their equipment had also been remade by Guo Ran and Xia Chen. Their condition was perfect.

Other than that, when Long Chen had infiltrated the Yin Yang World, he had saved experts from the Blue Star Continent. Luo Chuan and the others had given him their strongest techniques as thanks.

During this time, the Dragonblood warriors had been training hard in mastering those techniques. With the Dragon Blood Body Tempering Art as their base, they were able to use all of those techniques. Now, every one of them had mastered dozens of amazing divine arts. Most importantly, those divine arts had never appeared on the Martial Heaven Continent, so they could easily catch an enemy off guard.

Five hundred people was a base unit within the Dragonblood Legion, and their killing power was definitely astounding. So Long Chen was confident in letting them split up.

As long as they didn’t encounter the likes of Tian Xiezi or Di Feng, they were more than strong enough to protect themselves. Since everyone was being transported to different places, the chances of encountering each other were very low.

The first thing to do upon entering was to think of a way to gather back together. That was the most important thing.

The eight hundred thousand disciples of the Martial Heaven Alliance when added to the three hundred thousand disciples of the Xuan Beasts meant that they had a total of twenty-two groups. The Dragonblood warriors were easily split up, and any groups that appeared rather weak were personally led by Gu Yang and the others.

Meng Qi joined Cloud’s group, while Chu Yao, Tang Wan-er, Ye Zhiqiu, Dong Mingyu, and the others on that level split up.

There was no way around it. They had no choice but to take risks. The Martial Heaven Alliance needed the Dragonblood Legion, but the Dragonblood Legion also needed the Martial Heaven Alliance.

Once they were split up, Meng Qi looked at Long Chen worriedly. “Are you coming with us?”

Long Chen shook his head. “No. My luck has always been bad. I’ll go by myself to avoid implicating anyone.”

Long Chen also wished to go with them, but he decided to go by himself in the end. That would be more beneficial for everyone. No one else was more confident than him in his bad luck.

“Wilde, you go with big sister Wan-er. Don’t get lost,” said Long Chen.

Wilde’s body had grown even larger. He was like a monster in human form. His skin was covered in strange lines, and it felt like a beast was sleeping within his body. Once he erupted, he could destroy the world.

Even the Dragonblood warriors no longer quite dared to get close to him, because his current aura was absolutely terrifying.

“Brother Long, I want to go with you!” Despite growing more and more frightening, Wilde’s character had not changed. He was still the same simple, foolish oaf as back then.

He had been apart from Long Chen for a long time, and after finally reuniting, they had to separate once more. His pure reaction was heartbreaking.

“We will end up together. Our first goal is to reunite within the Star Field Divine World. Big sister Wan-er needs your protection, understood?” said Long Chen.

“I understand. I’ll protect big sister Wan-er. Whoever dares to come, I’ll smash them to death.” Wilde thumped his own chest, causing the air to vibrate. Some people in the distance jumped in shock.

Wilde had been within the original devil race’s world during this time to gather food. His body was constantly growing. Even Long Chen felt a frightening feeling coming from him.

Of the top class experts of the Dragonblood Legion, Tang Wan-er was slightly weaker, so he had Wilde go with her.

“Everyone, the goal is to gather into one group as fast as possible upon entering, understood? As for hidden treasures, they are secondary. Even if you obtain any treasures, you need the power to keep them,” said Long Chen.

“Understood!”

Everyone replied in unison. Long Chen had no need to worry about them growing greedy for treasures. After all, this was the Star Field Divine World, a place filled with unimaginable dangers. They were all grateful that Long Chen would take the risk of splitting up the Dragonblood Legion to keep them safe.

“Alright, then it’s almost our turn. Line up.”

“Long Chen, we might end up in very different places with Cloud and the others. The divine families will be entering between us,” said Meng Qi worriedly.

“Yes, I know. But there’s nothing that we can do about it. You’ll have to gather the Xuan Beasts and then join the Martial Heaven Alliance. The divine families probably won’t make things hard on you, but you can’t discount all of them. There’s no need to be courteous to them,” warned Long Chen.

Five million experts of the divine families were entering. Although he had offended the Ye family, they were just one of the four families. In this scenario, to vent that personal enmity with him upon the Xuan Beasts and the Martial Heaven Alliance should be a very unlikely scenario. The Ye family wouldn’t dare to publicly lower themselves to that extent.

“It’s our turn. Let’s go.” Long Chen nodded goodbye to Meng Qi and Cloud. He and the rest of the Martial Heaven Alliance’s warriors started walking toward the portal.
