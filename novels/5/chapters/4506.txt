Chapter 4495 Killing a Saint

BOOM!

The sphere of lightning exploded, but unlike before, it didn’t haphazardly release lightning in a chaotic explosion. Instead, it transformed into lightning swords that accurately locked onto each expert.

The lightning swords pierced through many nether dragon experts, causing them to convulse before ultimately collapsing.

Other than a bloody hole in them, there was no other visible injury on them. Nevertheless, once pierced, the fire of their souls and their Yuan Spirits were instantly extinguished.

In a single sweeping attack, countless experts met their demise. As their lifeless bodies tumbled to the ground, onlookers in the distance gasped.

It had to be known that amongst them were several Eternal experts and Heavenly Doyens, but they were all felled in one move by Long Chen.

Long Chen waved his hand, causing his lightning chains to grab and toss them into the primal chaos space.

The reason Long Chen had used a huge amount of Spiritual Strength to lock onto each of them was to keep their corpses intact for the black soil of the primal chaos space.

Just as Long Chen tossed those corpses into the primal chaos space, five figures shot at him from five different directions.Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

After they witnessed Long Chen unleash this devastating attack, a unanimous thought echoed in the minds of the five: this individual could not be left alive.

All five Saints launched simultaneous attacks, wielding five Saint weapons. These five attacks contained all of their power.

As a result, spacetime twisted, and the entire world seemed like it would explode. The collective force of the five Saints unleashing their most potent attacks was something that would kill the nether dragon race leader if he wasn’t fully prepared.

However, despite all this, Long Chen did not panic at all. A bronze cauldron materialized above his head, enveloping him within its protective embrace.

BOOM!

Five Saint weapons struck the cauldron at almost the same time. As countless runes lit up on the bronze cauldron, a sacred pressure erupted and crushed those five Saint weapons.

The five Saints were fully intent on killing Long Chen to get rid of this potential threat. However, as Long Chen unveiled the bronze cauldron, a chill swept through their hearts.

Only at that moment did they recall that Long Chen possessed a bronze cauldron, rumored to be a primal chaos divine item. This very cauldron had succeeded in annihilating the nether dragon race’s Saint item, which even harbored a Saint soul.

By the time Long Chen took it out, it was too late for them to put away their weapons. Long Chen also gave them no chance to feel regret.

In the end, their Saint items exploded, and the five of them hacked up blood. The destruction of their Saint items resulted in a severe backlash affecting them all.

Given that their souls were tightly linked to their Saint items, the destruction of these items created a tear in their souls. They writhed in agony, screaming while clutching their heads in torment.

“Divine ring! Battle armor!” Long Chen put away the Earth Cauldron. In an instant, the Seven Star Battle Armor and divine ring appeared, causing a sea of stars to quiver. A sacred light then emanated from Long Chen, piercing the heavens.

The heavens yielded to this radiance, and the stars in the cosmos appeared to heed his summons. When starlight fell, the cosmos seemed to manifest within the world.

Astral energy gathered within Long Chen. At this moment, Long Chen realized that he had finally reached the peak power of the Seven Star Battle Armor.

After that, information flooded his mind, but he had no time to check it. He shot after one of the injured Saints.

Just as Long Chen unleashed a punch, countless stars seemed to merge with him, forming what seemed like battle armor crafted from stars. On his own, he embodied the supreme might of the cosmos.

It was like Long Chen had gathered the blessing of all the stars above the nine heavens. The might of this one punch could annihilate heaven and earth.

In response, that Saint roared with fury. Enduring the pain of his soul being torn, he thrust his sharp claw toward Long Chen’s fist.

“Damn human, return my Saint item!”

Although he had lost his Saint item, this claw of his was a condensation of his life’s cultivation, and it was almost on par with a Saint item. He was confident that he could tear Long Chen apart.

BOOM!

Starlight exploded as Long Chen’s fist forcibly blasted that claw apart, causing the Saint to scream in terror.

BOOM!

Following that, Long Chen’s fist blasted through the Saint’s head as well. The latter’s Yuan Spirit suddenly flew out, and instead of fleeing, went straight for Long Chen’s head.

“Another blessing?” Long Chen was startled but delighted. This fellow also wanted to try possessing him?

“No, it’s a curse!”

Suddenly, Long Chen saw countless sinister runes appear on the Saint’s Yuan Spirit, and he realized that this wasn’t a possession.

“Ice Soul Divine Wall!” Long Chen shouted, and a translucent barrier appeared in front of him. As the Yuan Spirit crashed into it, countless runes stuck to it like mud.

These runes instantly froze and then ignited. After all, this wall was made of the Ice Soul Divine Flame’s power. When those runes ignited, some kind of black qi erupted.

Long Chen hastily retreated. The place he had just been in had now been turned into a giant hole by that terrifying black qi, and it even corroded the Ice Soul barrier. If Long Chen had retreated any slower, he would have been struck.

Long Chen was enraged, knowing that such a good thing wouldn’t happen to him twice. He had almost lost his life just now, which triggered his killing intent.

“Lightning Flame World Extermination!” Long Chen roared. With lightning in his left hand and flames in his right hand, he slammed them together, devouring that Saint’s Yuan Spirit.

“Save me!”

After launching that curse, the Saint’s Yuan Spirit was getting weak. As a result, he was powerless to resist Long Chen’s counterattack.

Finally recovered from the pain of having their souls torn, the other four Saints hastily rushed over.

Using their divine abilities, the four of them joined forces and attacked Long Chen at once. As combat veterans, they knew that attacking was the best way to create opportunities. If Long Chen was intent on killing their comrade, he would have to face their joint attack.

Long Chen was incensed. The Earth Cauldron couldn’t block divine abilities.

However, he was unwilling to give up on killing this fellow. With a cold snort, divine light exploded out of him. His seven-color Supreme Blood and violet blood were unleashed, forming two barriers around him. Simultaneously, stars coalesced to form a third protective barrier.

“Courting death!”

Seeing that Long Chen dared to keep attacking while taking on their attacks, the four Saints were enraged.

BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!

Their attacks blasted apart Long Chen’s defenses, yet their force was significantly depleted after penetrating those three layers of protection.

Despite that, Long Chen spat out blood. After all, while weakened, these attacks retained some formidable power of the Saints.

Withstanding the injuries, Long Chen didn’t dispel Lei Linger and Huo Linger’s power. Lightning and flames mixed, crushing that Saint’s Yuan Spirit.

Long Chen waved his hand and snatched that Saint’s body. His Kunpeng wings then shimmered, and he transformed into a streak of light, soaring away.

“You old ghosts, just you wait! When I become a Divine Venerate, all of your heads will fall!”

Long Chen’s resolute voice reverberated through the air even after he vanished from sight. He left behind only those four unsightly Saints, as well as a group of dumbstruck lifeforms.
