Chapter 3340 Pool of Dragons, Nest of Tigers

When they got close to the Vile Dragon Domain, they activated the flying boat’s camouflage system. This was an extremely high grade flying boat with many abilities that would make others sigh over it.

Camouflage was one of its abilities. However, this wasn’t truly hiding but was simply flying silently while covering up any aura. It would then reflect the surrounding scenery. Without looking closely, it would seem as if the flying boat was merged with heaven and earth.

However, this also greatly reduced the flying speed. But Long Chen wasn’t in a rush. It just so happened that he needed some time.Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

Buzz.

Long Chen’s aura suddenly began to rise. Qin Feng and the others jumped in shock and hastily activated the flying boat’s formations for him.

After that, a rumbling rang out within the flying boat. Long Chen’s aura poured out as if it had escaped a dam. No matter how Long Chen tried to control it, he couldn’t stop it. He had advanced to the fourth Heavenstage of the Four Peak realm.

It had to be known that he had just entered the third Heavenstage when he arrived in the Heavenly Rainbow Domain. Now in just a few days, he reached the fourth Heavenstage. This speed was truly shocking.

The fourth Heavenstage was also the mid stage. This time, his aura grew immensely. His physical body was also strengthened, as well as the flames of his 108,000 stars.

His aura only stabilized after a full two hours. Long Chen then took a deep breath. If he had fully unleashed his aura in the flying boat, it would have exploded. Fortunately, this flying boat was strong enough that his aura didn’t leak and disturb the surrounding lifeforms.

“If boss had reached the mid stage in the Heavenly Rainbow Domain, it would have been much easier…” said Xu Zixiong.

Long Chen shook his head. “Even if I had reached the mid stage, that battle wouldn’t have gone any differently. Everything was arranged before our arrival.”

He understood Xu Zixiong’s meaning, but he knew that even if he had been in the mid stage, he would not have the power to reverse the tides. Yan Xu treated the Heavenly Rainbow Fairy as a must-have, and Long Chen couldn’t stop such a terrifying existence.

However, the reason why Yan Xu had devoured the Heavenly Rainbow Fairy but not the Heavenly Rainbow Flame was unknown. Long Chen’s only guess was that it might be related to faith energy, or perhaps the Heavenly Rainbow Fairy had something else that Yan Xu urgently needed.

Although Yan Xu had only appeared through the void, its power had caused the ten thousand Daos to collapse. That terrifying power deeply shook Long Chen. That was the most terrifying power he had ever seen before.

Yan Xu hadn’t been targeting him, but a single thought from it could destroy him, or perhaps destroy the entire Heavenly Rainbow Domain.

However, it hadn’t done so. That gave off the stench of a scheme. But for now, Long Chen couldn’t figure it out.

The flying boat slowly advanced. Long Chen also consolidated his aura, adapting to his new power as fast as possible.

“Boss, what are we doing back in the Vile Dragon Domain?” asked Qi Yu.

Bai Shishi had returned to her previous iciness. She sat beside the window with her eyes closed. No one knew what she was thinking, but she seemed to have forgotten their previous awkwardness.

Seeing that, Long Chen was relieved. He said, “Naturally, it’s to ignite the divine tower and restore the seventh branch academy. Last time, I managed to imprint the divine rune on the foundation stone. As for the altar in Zhaoming Ancient City, while they burn the altar, the energy stones activate and their energy will then be absorbed by the divine rune. The divine rune has already germinated within the foundation stone. During this time, Jiang Yuhe and the others have followed their promise. People have been working every day to activate the foundation stone, so it’s already awakened. All that’s left is to place the divine tower on the foundation stone and it will ignite. Then everything will be done.”

Hearing this explanation, everyone came to understand Long Chen’s plan. He had made his calculations long in advance.

“Are you not worried about them breaking the altar or doing something to it?” asked Bai Shishi suddenly.

Seeing Bai Shishi looking at him as if nothing had happened between them, Long Chen’s expression was a bit odd. He laughed, “Of course I’m not afraid. The altar itself isn’t a problem. They can investigate it as they please as the energy stones aren’t in it. Burning the altar activates the formation inside of it, which then activates the energy stones through space. Even if people find that the altar is strange, they definitely can’t find the energy stones. So, even if it had been a failure, there would have been no loss. Furthermore, that formation was extremely crude. It looks just like something a fool did to mess around. They can study it all they want without finding any clues.”

“Boss is wise.” Qin Feng laughed delightedly. Long Chen really did make things airtight when he handled things.

“Don’t be in a rush to flatter me. Although things have been arranged well, I have no assurance at all that it can succeed. That Devil Eye Water Lily definitely went insane after what happened last time. It knows that we might come back, so it probably has some special defenses waiting for us,” said Long Chen.

The flying boat slowly flew over Vile Dragon Valley. Everything was as it had been here, as if nothing had ever happened. But it was precisely due to this that people started to have bad feelings.

Past the Vile Dragon Valley was the gloomy forest. To be safe, Long Chen had everyone consume an aura concealing pill to further keep themselves hidden.

“Boss, why don’t we put away the flying boat and walk there? That might be a safer choice,” suggested Bai Xiaole. This flying boat was gigantic, and even the camouflage system couldn’t guarantee it would not be sensed.

“You’re wrong. Whether it is Vile Dragon Valley or that sinister forest, everything is under their surveillance. Anyone who enters will immediately be sensed. The Undying race’s intelligence isn’t high, and they have one-track minds. They definitely think that we will follow our old path,” said Long Chen.

After being in contact with Liu Ruyan for so long, although she had never been friendly with him, he could tell what kind of character she had. She was essentially someone who had never used their brain, or perhaps it should be said that she could not come at things from a different angle. The one time that he had called her wood-brained, she had almost killed him.

Thus, Long Chen had a general understanding of the Undying race, and he was sure that the Devil Eye Water Lily was just as wood-brained. Otherwise, it wouldn’t have allowed Long Chen to cut off its seed pod.

The flying boat gradually slowed down, and they quickly reached the crater where that ancient corpse was buried. They could see through the flying boat’s formation. All of a sudden, Long Chen and the others gasped.

At the edge of that crater were countless black dragons patrolling through the dark. They were like vipers waiting for prey, and not the slightest aura leaked out of them.

Within the pool, the Devil Eye Water Lily appeared rather listless without its seed pod. Long Chen then saw several dark figures down in the pool, but he didn’t dare to probe them spiritually for fear of being sensed.

Clearly, the Devil Eye Water Lily had found reinforcements. It was probably still thinking of regaining its seed pod.

Long Chen already had Jiang Yuhe and the others spread the word that they were going to reclaim the ruins. The Devil Eye Water Lily definitely believed those rumors, which was why it was patiently waiting.

“It’s like I dug my own grave this time!” Long Chen felt helpless. Those rumors he had spread were originally just for tricking his enemies. But the Devil Eye Water Lily actually took it seriously. Now it might be troublesome.

The surroundings were filled with tens of thousands of black dragons. But Long Chen couldn’t retreat. He slowly sent the flying boat toward the foundation stone.
