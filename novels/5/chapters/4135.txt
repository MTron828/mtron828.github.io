Chapter 4124: Let’s Talk Nicely

This slap shocked people even more than his previous move to capture the traitor of the Fullmoon race. After all, no one had expected him to dare to attack the vice leader of the Heavenly Tiger race.

As a result, no one had been on guard for this slap, and the vice leader tumbled across the ground. The immense force completely deformed his face.

“Courting death!” Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Upon seeing this, the Heavenly Tiger race’s experts roared furiously and attacked. How could they allow their vice leader to be beaten?

On the other hand, the vice leader of the Heavenly Tiger race was still befuddled from being slapped. His head was buzzing. Never in his dreams would he imagine that someone would dare to slap him in the face.

After slapping him to the ground, Long Chen naturally wouldn’t give them a chance to counterattack. He grabbed the vice leader’s neck and swung him around, using him as a weapon against the Heavenly Tiger race.

Those experts all wanted to attack Long Chen, but seeing Long Chen swing their vice leader at them, they hastily retreated.

Being treated like this, the vice leader was enraged and summoned dark red runes all over his body. When they lit up, Long Chen felt a sharp pain in his palm. It felt like he would be forced to let go.

However, Long Chen sneered, his fingers transforming into sharp hooks with gleaming golden dragon scales. He then drove his newly formed dragon claw into the vice leader's neck with unwavering resolve.

As a result, the vice leader’s body trembled, and the runes that he had just summoned dimmed, his fear becoming palpable.

Although the Heavenly Tiger race was an immemorial demonic beast, their neck was one of their vital spots. Actually, all tiger demonic beasts had a weak spot at the back of their necks.

In the mortal world, ordinary tigers carried their cubs by biting down on the back of their necks. When bitten there, the cubs wouldn’t struggle in the slightest and would obediently be carried by their mothers.

Although the Heavenly Tiger race could be considered the emperor of the tiger race, they still were not immune to this weakness. In an instant, the vice leader went limp, afraid of being killed.

With killing intent brimming in his eyes, he roared, “Foolish human race, do you know what you’re doing?!”

His furious roar resulted in another forceful slap to his face, splitting his cheek open and causing blood to pour forth. The intense pain of the blow left him reeling, and he came close to fainting.

“You are courting death! Release our vice leader, or-”

Long Chen didn’t reply and just slapped him once more. The Heavenly Tiger race’s vice leader might be a natural Heaven Venerate, but with the back of his neck caught, he couldn’t form any resistance. Furthermore, just how terrifying was Long Chen’s power? With three slaps, half of the vice leader’s head turned into a mess of flesh and blood. His current appearance was horrifying.

Now, let alone the Heavenly Tiger race’s experts, even the Fullmoon race’s experts were dumbfounded. That was a natural Heaven Venerate, a monster on the same level as their race leader.

However, such a figure was caught and repeatedly slapped by Long Chen this easily? They couldn’t believe it.

Anyway, these three slaps ignited their blood. The Fullmoon race and the Heavenly Tiger race might not be considered mortal enemies, but their relationship was never good as they looked down on each other. Although their relationship had not devolved into an all-out war, there was already quite a bit of friction.

Thus, now that Long Chen was beating their vice leader, the Fullmoon race felt incredibly refreshed. On the other hand, the Heavenly Tiger race’s experts were enraged and on the verge of attacking. The only thing holding them back was the fact that their vice leader was in Long Chen’s hands. Unable to attack nor retreat, they were incredibly enraged.

“Release our vice leader! If you have the guts, have a one-against-one battle with me.” Suddenly, a young man in the crowd stepped forward and shouted.

When this young man appeared, Guo Ran and the others were shocked, as his Blood Qi was incredibly powerful, and three-colored runes floated around him.

“A triple Supreme!”

This person was a true Supreme, someone who had merged their Spirit Blood, Spirit Root, and Spirit Bone in the Immortal King realm. As soon as he appeared, the aura he exuded gave them a sense of immense pressure. He was definitely the strongest Immortal King that they had ever encountered.

In front of that challenge, Long Chen simply slapped the vice leader’s face again.

“What… what are you doing?!” demanded the Supreme heavenly genius.

As a reply, Long Chen slapped the vice leader’s face again, seeming completely fearless. No matter what was said, he would slap the vice leader.

The Heavenly Tiger race’s experts felt like they were about to go crazy. Long Chen refused to stop slapping their vice leader no matter what they said.

“Brat, if you have guts, just try to kill me!” roared the vice leader crazily.

Immediately, a saber pierced through his back and out his chest, spurting out a lot of blood. Time seemed to stand still. Long Chen had simply stabbed the Minghong Saber through the vice leader’s body, his saber pointing at the heavens. He had released his grasp on the vice leader’s neck, but his saber now contained apocalyptic power that could shatter the vice leader’s body.

In that state, the vice leader didn’t have the slightest ability to resist. As long as Long Chen unleashed the power in his saber, even a natural Heaven Venerate like him would still be killed.

Now, the vice leader was finally afraid. Before he came to the Fullmoon race, he hadn’t viewed any of them seriously. In his mind, other than Xu Jianxiong, everyone else was trash.

Yet, against all expectations, a little Immortal King had grabbed hold of his vital spot and left him in this wretched state, with no chance to turn things around. In other words, his life was entirely in Long Chen’s hands.

“What did you say just now? Can you repeat it?” asked Long Chen with a light smile.

However, that smile was even more terrifying than the sinister face of a fiend. Now, the vice leader knew that this young fellow could kill people without blinking.

“Alright, I admit defeat! What do you want?” demanded the vice leader.

Perhaps against true experts, if his technique was inferior to his opponent’s, a fight to the death on the battlefield was nothing embarrassing.

However, if he were to die to an Immortal King brat, that would be ridiculous and completely not worth it. He didn’t want to die with such disgrace.

“Yes, now you’re right. Youngster, don’t have such a temper. If you have anything to say, we can talk nicely,” said Long Chen.

Hearing this, the vice leader almost coughed up blood from rage. Did a brat like Long Chen just call him a youngster? That was the greatest irony.

“What do you want?” he demanded once more.

“It’s very simple. Hand over those traitors. Use their lives to exchange for yours,” said Long Chen lightly.

In an instant, the traitors of the Fullmoon race twitched. However, before they could react, the experts of the Heavenly Tiger race immediately knocked them down and sealed their mouths, not allowing them to plead for mercy or curse them. They naturally knew that their vice leader’s life was not comparable to these traitors.

As if afraid of Long Chen reneging on the deal, they directly tossed the traitors to the Fullmoon race and then glared at Long Chen.

“Don’t worry, I, Long Chen, always keep my word.”

Long Chen smiled and swung his saber, throwing the vice leader off of it. But as soon as the vice leader was free, his gaze grew sharp with hostility.

Just then, the other experts of the Heavenly Tiger race clenched their weapons, their auras climbing.

“What do you want?”

Long Chen looked at those experts disdainfully, blood slowly dripping from his saber.

“Kind words cannot advise dead ghosts. If you want to die so badly, I’ll fulfill your wish.”

Like a prelude to impending doom, heaven and earth were devoid of any sound. However, the atmosphere was charged with sharp killing intent as the Dragonblood warriors slowly reached for the swords on their backs.
