Chapter 4099 Deliberately Making Things Hard

“Guests from far away, come take a break in my Fullmoon race!”

Although it seemed as if he disliked the human race, the race leader still gestured invitingly to Long Chen and the others.

“Race leader, they…” Xu Changchuan pointed at the people who had attacked him.

“Seal all the gates! Without my orders, no one may open them!” shouted the race leader.

It seemed that he didn’t wish to deal with internal matters of the race in front of outsiders. That was understandable, as he didn’t want others to laugh at them. First, he would handle the matter of Long Chen and the others before dealing with the rest.

“Please, go ahead.”

The race leader beckoned to Long Chen. It went without saying that as the leader of his race, he was quite precise in terms of etiquette. He didn’t treat them rudely just because their cultivation bases were lower.

Long Chen then cupped his fists and led everyone to follow them forward. Up ahead was a beautiful mountain range. The scene here was picturesque. Clouds and mist winded the land, and the gentle moonlight gave everything a mysterious feeling.

On the way up, no one spoke. Actually, none of the Heaven Venerates dared to say anything, and some of them were pale. Those were the ones to attack Xu Changchuan. They hadn’t expected him to really manage to get back, so they felt uneasy. As for the other Heaven Venerates, they seemed to understand something.

They quickly arrived at a mountain valley with a giant figure at the end of the path. Upon seeing it, Long Chen and the others’ hearts shook.

It was a colossal rhinoceros, its form suspended amidst the heavens and became a part of the constellation's embrace. With its head held high, it directed its gaze toward the luminous full moon.

Now, it was clear that the Fullmoon race was a demonic beast race. That giant rhinoceros gave off its own divine radiance, and it seemed to be nourished by the light of the moon. Long Chen and the others sensed endless power within it.

It was like a single move from that rhinoceros could destroy heaven and earth. That shocking feeling made even Long Chen feel miniscule.

“That is our Fullmoon race’s ancestral spirit, our almighty totem. Anyone who bears malice toward my Fullmoon race will be executed by the ancestral spirit,” said the race leader.

Long Chen couldn’t help frowning. What was that supposed to mean?

“My Fullmoon race is always direct and straightforward. We disdain using schemes, playing word games, and mixing right and wrong. So, any outsider who comes here must go through this process. It is an ancestral teaching for us to distinguish good and evil,” said the race leader.

“Although I don’t like it, I respect your customs,” said Long Chen.

This method of the Fullmoon race was a bit humiliating, but for them to not hide it and instead get straight to the point, that was refreshing. If he hadn’t mentioned it, they wouldn’t have even known about it.

The race leader nodded and continued leading them forward. There was a large open space ahead.

In the surroundings, there were no palaces like in the human race’s territories. Instead, it was a giant outdoor plaza with a feast prepared for Long Chen and the others.

“Today, I’d like to thank you all for helping Changchuan and bringing him here. I represent the entire Fullmoon race in thanking you.”

The race leader was extremely direct, not adding anything superfluous. He then raised his cup of wine.

Long Chen raised his cup as well and touched his cup to the leader’s cup.

The race leader continued, “May I ask who you are?”

“The High Firmament Academy’s seventh branch dean, Long Chen,” answered Long Chen with the same approach.VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

This title of his startled everyone, including Xu Changchuan and the race leader.

Clearly, they were well aware of the reputation of the most ancient academy in the nine heavens and ten lands. Long Chen was so young, yet he had claimed the throne of the dean in one of their branches? Was that a joke?

“No wonder Changchuan would ask you for aid. You really aren’t some ordinary person. Personally, I tend to be rather direct. So tell me, what do you want?” asked the race leader. He was shocked by Long Chen’s title, but he trusted Long Chen to not be lying about it.

“Changchuan told me that if he becomes the successor to the Fullmoon race, he can provide the life-forbidden area as a place for me to rest if I need it. He also said that we could collaborate in the future in exploring it,” said Long Chen.

“What nonsense are you babbling?! How can such a thing be randomly permitted to anyone?! Xu Changchuan has colluded with foreign races, selling out the Fullmoon race! A coward like that cannot be allowed to be the heir to the Fullmoon race!” shouted a Heaven Venerate.

“When did the great Fullmoon race ever sink into begging other races for aid? That is a complete disgrace in itself. But Xu Changchuan has even sold out the Fullmoon race’s benefits in doing so! He has betrayed the race and must be executed!”

“Race leader, it doesn’t matter what the reasons are. Those are all internal matters of the Fullmoon race. Xu Changchuan sold out our race to live, and that is already touching the bottom line of the Fullmoon race. He cannot be allowed to rule the Fullmoon race. We won’t accept it!”

One Heaven Venerate after another stood up to criticize Xu Changchuan.

“Are you saying that I should have just died to your sinister schemes?!” raged Xu Changchuan.

He had only asked Long Chen for aid because he had no other choice. Now, these people were actually using that against him?

But then, Xu Changchuan was too young. These old fellows only had to say a word to make him feel too enraged to properly argue.

“For someone competent, all troubles and difficulties are merely trials. Even in front of a life-and-death trial, you can’t lose your bottom line. However, you, Changchuan, sold out your own race just to live. What qualifications do you have to become the race leader? What face do you have to even live?” demanded a Heaven Venerate righteously.

“You…!” Xu Changchuan pointed at him furiously. If there wasn’t someone holding him back, he might have directly attacked this Heaven Venerate.

Suddenly, they heard the sound of clapping, and everyone's attention was drawn to the source. The clapper was Long Chen.

“Amazing, truly amazing. Race leader, if I were you, I’d slaughter these old fellows right now,” laughed Long Chen.

“Oh? And why is that?”

The race leader was surprisingly calm. As for those Heaven Venerates, they sneered. Just as they were about to insult Long Chen, they heard the race leader speak, so they swallowed their insults.

“Because they are slapping you in the face, no?” Long Chen shrugged.

“You little brat, you dare to spout slander? The human race is nothing good! Do you think that your words can deceive the race leader?!”

“My Fullmoon race is always direct and straightforward. We disdain using schemes, playing word games, and mixing right and wrong.”

Long Chen didn’t even look at them. He simply rose and took on the exact appearance of the race leader when he spoke those exact words. Everyone knew exactly who he was imitating.

Once he repeated those words, everyone fell silent, and those sneering Heaven Venerates twitched, looking like they had been slapped.
