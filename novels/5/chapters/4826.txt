Chapter 4815 Time To Slaughter Heaven Saints

Long Chen stood in the air, his aura fluctuating. Despite his pale face, his intense killing intent permeated the entire space.

Evilmoon was aimed at the seven figures shrouded in mist. They clearly wished to conceal their identities, but the immense pressure emanating from them revealed their true nature as Heaven Saints.

These seven Heaven Saints had long since been hiding in the surroundings, silently observing the battle unfold without any urgency to intervene.

Seeing the Celestial race’s Heaven Saint going in without them, they had assumed that there would be no need for them to do anything after that. However, Long Chen had created an ending none of them would have predicted—slaying a Heaven Saint.

Although the Celestial race’s Heaven Saint had a destroyed foundation, his power could not be underestimated. Theoretically, he should be able to exterminate a Divine Venerate with a flick of his hand, but Long Chen’s attack had just turned him to dust, shocking these Heaven Saints. All at once, the same thought appeared in all their heads: Long Chen could not be left alive.

When they appeared, Long Chen pointed Evilmoon at them, his voice filled with unquestionable confidence as he issued a warning. The mention of the name "Long Zhantian" caused them to halt their advance immediately. After all, he required only a single clone to wipe out a terrifying Heaven Saint.

Their hearts quivered with fear as they instantly grasped the significance of Long Zhantian's clone appearing at the gate to the ninth heaven. The implication was clear to them, so they couldn’t help but hesitate.

Long Chen’s father was a ruthless character. If they killed Long Chen, Long Zhantian would not hesitate to pay any price to avenge him. The mere existence of Long Zhantian served as the ultimate deterrent against their actions.

“Don’t be afraid! We just need to clean up the battlefield afterward. No one will know!” shouted a Heaven Saint.

“Is that so? Do you think you’re capable of such a thing? The majority of you have gone to attack the academy’s headquarters. Are you sure that they’ll be returning alive?” sneered Long Chen.

“You... what are you talking about?!”

“I set up a trap. The Dragonblood Legion came here alone just to gamble with you,” replied Long Chen coldly, resting Evilmoon on his shoulder.

The devil lord on the ground was still struggling but unable to escape Bai Shishi’s bindings. Meanwhile, the other devil creatures had been annihilated by the Dragonblood warriors. The Dragonblood warriors now gathered behind Long Chen and seemed ready to fight, showing no hesitation even against Heaven Saints.

“Xia Chen, have you found it yet? Where is that barrier?!” transmitted Guo Ran urgently as both sides stared at each other.

Xia Chen’s number one priority was to find the mechanism that controlled the barrier capable of suppressing a Heaven Saint's cultivation base. However, even after dedicating considerable time to the task, he still couldn’t find it.

“The barrier here is probably under someone’s control. Otherwise, these Heaven Saints wouldn’t be so fearless,” Xia Chen muttered through clenched teeth, his frustration evident.

He had scanned the surroundings many times with his formation disc but had yet to find the energy source of this barrier. He could only sense some subtle fluctuations.

If he was given enough time, he would be able to trace those fluctuations back to the source and lock down the core of the barrier. However, they didn’t have that much time.

Xia Chen was also anxious as they were facing seven Heaven Saints. Even a single Heaven Saint wasn’t something that they could deal with.

“I don’t believe that crap! If the rest of you don’t have any guts, I’ll do it!”

One large lifeform with a singular horn stepped forward, launching a fist at Long Chen and the others with the full power of a Heaven Saint.

This lifeform was quite sly. Despite throwing a full-power punch, he didn’t expose his innate divine abilities or manifestation, making it impossible for them to tell his origins.

Guo Ran jumped to the front and crossed his sabers in front of him, shouting, “Dragonblood Cross Slash!”

Long Chen then touched Guo Ran’s back, while Gu Yang, Li Qi, and Song Mingyuan’s palms pressed on Long Chen’s back. As all the Dragonblood warriors put their hands on the person in front of them, their Blood Qi ignited with the intensity of the ten thousand dragons roaring.

A giant ten thousand dragon diagram then appeared above their heads. All their dragon blood power and individual power linked perfectly and poured toward Guo Ran. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

Guo Ran’s sabers blazed with power and accurately slashed onto the Heaven Saint’s giant fist with the full power of every Dragonblood warrior.

BOOM!

Upon impact, that enormous fist crumbled, and a rain of blood descended.

The lifeform's hand was destroyed, and the mist surrounding him dissipated, revealing his true form—a being covered in blue scales with a bull's head.

His eyes widened in disbelief, mirroring the astonishment of the other Heaven Saints present.

Meanwhile, Guo Ran staggered. Long Chen simply grabbed him and pulled him behind for protection. Guo Ran’s injuries had worsened, so Long Chen immediately tried to take their enemies’ attention.

“Looks like you underestimated us. Did you think we would come here if we didn’t have some confidence? I’ll tell you the truth. You might be able to ruin our plan this time, but you won’t be able to kill us. We can’t beat you, but we are entirely capable of leaving.

“Now you have two options. One is to attack us, and we’ll immediately flee. Our mission will end in failure, but I will remember this. I’ve memorized the form of the bull head. Finding you won’t be anything difficult. When my father comes back, he’ll kill your seniors, and I’ll kill the juniors.

“Your second option is to immediately leave, and we will continue with our mission. You haven’t caused us any real damage, so we can let things rest as is. Why don’t you tell me what choice you wish to pick?”

When the bull-headed lifeform heard this proposition, his expression grew extremely ugly. However, they all remained silent. They were all afraid of Long Zhantian, so they didn’t know what to do.

Long Chen didn’t push them further. While they didn’t move, spiritual fluctuations were going on among them. They were clearly communicating.

Just then, Xia Chen’s formation disc lit up, and a screen of light enveloped this region. Those Heaven Saints’ expressions darkened as they sensed their auras plummeting.

“Not good!”

In an instant, they had a bad feeling. At this moment, Evilmoon mercilessly slashed down on them.

“Brothers, it’s time to slaughter Heaven Saints! Don’t leave a single one alive!”
