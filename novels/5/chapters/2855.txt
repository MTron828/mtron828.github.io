Chapter 2844 One Shocking Move

Amongst the crowd, Zhong Changsheng was infuriated. He finally couldn’t endure any longer. According to the rules, he had to accept the challenge, or his third place ranking would be taken by Li Cai.

Normally, the challenges for the spots on the Human-grade divine rankings had to occur at the start of the month. But this month was special. The competition was occurring in the middle of the month.

In this competition, if a person took someone else’s ranking, they would have to accept if someone else challenged them for their new position. In other words, only by winning twice could they stay in their new position. Thus, the order and choice of challenges were very important.

“Since you want to die, I’ll accept.” Zhong Changsheng walked up. As soon as he walked through the barrier, it became a sealed space.

Zhong Changsheng’s expression was gloomy. That wasn’t because he viewed Li Cai as a serious opponent but because he thought that Long Chen was intentionally humiliating him with this challenge. Even if he won, it would still be a disgrace for him to have to fight someone so weak.

“Did Long Chen feed you a bear’s heart and a leopard’s guts? You dare to challenge me? Although killing people isn’t allowed here, making you half-dead is still no problem.”

“If I lose, I don’t mind losing my life. However, boss San said that if I don’t defeat you, I should just kill myself with a piece of rotten tofu. I am the captain of the Elite Group. I cannot lose our dignity, so I’m sorry to say that I might be a bit heavy-handed in a bit. Be careful, I don’t want you to blame me if I kill you by accident.” A broadsword the thickness of a palm appeared in Li Cai’s hand.

This was a weapon that Long Chen had specifically picked out for him, and it perfectly suited his power. He then pointed it at Zhong Changsheng, his body bending slightly. His eyes were sharp like a falcon’s, and the formless air of an expert appeared around him.

Both the disciples and instructors were moved by this. Li Cai’s current aura was shocking. They could sense it even from outside the stage.

“How can this be? How can trash suddenly possess such a powerful aura?”

“It’s only been a month! What did they go through? It seems like they’ve completely transformed!”

Although it was just a starting posture, his movements, his gaze, and the steady way he carried that broadsword all added up into a stunning transformation. Everyone looked at Long Chen, only to see that he was sitting amongst the Mortal-ranked instructors. His eyes were closed, and he wasn’t even watching. It was as if this challenge didn’t interest him.

BOOM!

Just at this moment, the battle started. Holding the broadsword with both hands, Li Cai slashed it at Zhong Changsheng and sent the latter flying back.

Zhong Changsheng was stunned at Li Cai’s shocking power. He actually wasn’t able to block it and was forced back.

As a result, cheers rang out from the Elite Group. This one blow gave them great confidence.

In the past ten days, they had been undergoing hellish training. Long Chen almost wiped away all the confidence they had accumulated before.

At this moment, Zhong Changsheng’s sword began to shine. He thrust his sword, unleashing a hundred rays of light that were like a lotus blooming. It was perfectly refined.

“He directly took out his trump card?” Mu Qingyun was startled. She had fought against Zhong Changsheng multiple times, and he knew that this was the move he had spent the most time drilling. He was actually forced to use it so quickly.

This sword attack was a mix of illusions and real attacks. What looked real was fake, and what looked fake was real. It was a very difficult attack to deal with.

What shocked everyone was that in the face of Zhong Changsheng’s powerful attack, Li Cai didn’t retreat. Instead, he charged head-on with his broadsword.

BOOM!

The refined sword-light then shattered, and Zhong Changsheng was sent flying, this time smashing into the barrier and bouncing back, coughing up blood.

“Impossible!”

Now, even Mu Qingyun and the others were shocked, unable to believe their eyes. Zhong Changsheng’s trump card was broken so easily?

The next moment, Li Cai’s sword was already pressed up right against Zhong Changsheng’s throat.

“You’ve lost.” Li Cai’s voice resounded throughout the plaza.

Two moves. In just two moves, the position of third rank on the divine rankings was taken.

The Elite Group erupted into cheering, filled with excitement. Now they knew that not all opponents were as monstrous as Long Chen.

Li Cai was never able to last more than three exchanges against Long Chen, and now the third rank Zhong Changsheng was unable to last three exchanges against Li Cai. Hence, the Elite Group had a new assessment of their current power and was no longer as dispirited as before.

Now they knew why Long Chen hadn’t said any words of encouragement or given them any pointers on their way back here. It was because he understood their power.

“I won’t submit!” Zhong Changsheng roared furiously. This shout drew countless people’s scorn. Someone who refused to admit defeat was the most contemptible.

“You won’t submit? That’s fine. I’ll beat you until you submit. Boss San taught me, so I can’t lose his face. I heard that you’ve even provoked boss San? Today, I’ll show you that the two of you are in completely different dimensions.” Li Cai actually retreated, putting away his broadsword.

Li Cai was filled with worship toward Long Chen. He finally understood just how terrifying his growth was in this one month. He was filled with confidence.

Seeing Li Cai actually give Zhong Changsheng another chance, the disciples erupted into an uproar. Was this confidence or arrogance? Li Cai actually viewed the third rank’s position as a game. It had to be known that this position was something that countless people wanted. Was he not afraid of all his gains flying away in an instant?

They looked toward Long Chen, only to see that his eyes were still closed. He didn’t seem to care about anything happening. It was as if he was sleeping.

“I was careless just now! Let’s see how you beat me this time!” Zhong Changsheng’s sword-light suddenly expanded, and a sharp image appeared on the edge of his blade.

“Divine energy manifesting outside?”

“Has he already ignited his divine flame seed?!”

The disciples cried out in shock. Only those that had ignited their divine flame could begin unleashing divine energy. Hence, Zhong Changsheng could be considered half a step into the Divine Flame realm.

“Die!” Zhong Changsheng furiously slashed his sword, and waves of giant sword-images flew out, filling the entire martial stage. Even Mu Qingyun jumped. She hadn’t expected Zhong Changsheng to have condensed his divine flame seed in just a month.

In return, Li Cai shouted and straightforwardly charged over. He was instantly consumed by the sword-images.

BOOM!

Another explosion occurred and the endless sword-images vanished. Li Cai’s chest was pierced, while Zhong Changsheng was lying far away, struggling to get up. After a few failures, he suddenly coughed up a mouthful of blood, and his body began to violently twitch.

“Medics!” Ming Ze shouted, and some healing experts immediately rushed over. They examined both of their bodies. One reason they were here was to help heal people during these challenges, but the other reason was precisely for this situation, where two parties were injured. They would decide whose injury was lighter, and thus who was the winner.

“Zhong Changsheng has lost. The third place position is changing owners.” They announced the result after their examination. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

“The competitions can continue now.”

Ming Ze looked at Li Cai and then at Long Chen. A smile filled with deeper meaning appeared on his face.

The Elite Group’s disciples instantly got excited. Now was their time to show off.
