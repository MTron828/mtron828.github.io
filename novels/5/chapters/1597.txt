Chapter 1592 Bring Me In

Translator: BornToBe

There was a huge castle ahead, with giant gates opened outward. The gates had huge rivets that were many miles long.

Standing in front of this giant gate, humans seemed as miniscule as ants. What was beyond the gates was shrouded in primal chaos. It was impossible to see anything inside.

The Gates of Hell did not have the guards of legend like the Ox-Head and Horse-Face. There was nothing around except primal chaos.

Just as Qu Jianying was not far from it, she saw two figures enter it, vanishing within without a trace.

Due to the great distance, Long Chen hadn’t managed to see whether those two were human or some other species.

Suddenly, a figure appeared not far from Qu Jianying. It was a giant colorful tiger. When it passed by Qu Jianying, it glanced at her and then ignored her, going straight into the gate.

Even its huge, mountain-like body was miniscule in front of the giant gates.

Qu Jianying hesitated for a moment before also entering.

Just at that moment, the vision faded. The dark aura vanished, and the sun appeared in the sky again.

Long Chen and the old man both took a deep breath. Only now did Long Chen realize he was covered in sweat.

The atmosphere of the Netherworld was too nerve-wracking.

“It really is a damnable place.” The old man wiped some sweat off his forehead.

“Old man, why did the vision end? Did you run out of energy?” asked Long Chen. This memory was not complete.

“It’s not that I ran out of energy but that this memory was only this long. You might not know this, but it’s very difficult to remember anything about passing through the Netherworld. Practically, everyone has their memories of that time stripped away by some mysterious energy. Jianying’s Spiritual Strength is exceptional, and I don’t know what technique she used to preserve some of her memories, but doing just that is already extremely heaven-defying. As for what’s behind that gate, even she is powerless to remember anything about it. However, this is already very helpful to me. Without it, I would probably fail to get past that bridge.”

The old man felt some lingering fear. Qu Jianying’s caution had just saved his life.

With the Heaven Splitting Battle Sect’s men’s characters, that bridge was too dangerous. At the very least, these memories had guaranteed his safety for the first part.

“When are you planning on attacking the Netherpassage realm?” asked Long Chen.

“I was interrupted this time, and seeing these memories has almost been an impact. Since I used up some of my life and death energy, I would need a month to recover to my peak state. I’ll only attempt it at that time.”

Activating the memories Qu Jianyinng had left behind had taken quite a bit of energy. The old man would need to fully recover before attempting his breakthrough.

“Then... can I discuss something with you?” probed Long Chen.

“What?”

“Well... I just want to ask, can you bring my Yuan Spirit with you when you make your breakthrough?”

“Are you insane?!”

The old man immediately jumped up. This brat really was crazy. Could someone come back alive from the Netherworld?

“Don’t panic just yet. I was thinking that I could have my Yuan Spirit enter your mind-sea. When you attack the Netherpassage realm, I’ll come along too. That way, I’ll be able to stroll around the Netherworld,” said Long Chen.

“Absolutely not! You saw how dangerous the Netherworld is. Your Yuan Spirit might be powerful, but you’re just at the Soul Transformation realm. What if some law exterminates you?” The old man shook his head vehemently. This brat’s guts were too big.

When attacking the Netherpassage realm, the body would die. However, there would be a small seed of life left behind. Without this seed, it would be impossible to return from the Netherworld. Only a Netherpassage expert who had succeeded would be able to return and activate the seed of life, completing a full nirvanic rebirth. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

However, if you died in the Netherworld, that seed of life would vanish. That was true death.

Long Chen’s method might sound plausible in theory, but it was definitely impossible in reality. Who knew what would happen?

“Old man, just listen to me. My cultivation technique is a bit special and is very sensitive to danger. In all these years, the reason I could brush so close to death constantly is thanks to my cultivation technique. There’s something I need in the Netherworld, and I couldn’t sense any danger. In other words, other than whatever is beyond that gate, I should be absolutely safe. Do you not understand my character? I’m more afraid of death than anyone. I have so many hot-blooded brothers and beautiful women to return to. I can’t just throw my life away,” said Long Chen solemnly.

Now that Long Chen put it this way, the old man reconsidered. Although Long Chen was young, he was meticulous. He rarely made a mistake in his plans.

Since Long Chen was so set on doing this, on taking such a giant risk, he had to have his own reasons.

After hesitating, the old man finally clenched his teeth. “Fine, if you want to go crazy, I’ll accompany you. However, you have to promise me that you’ll return alive. The Heaven Splitting Battle Sect needs you too.”

Long Chen understood. If the old man failed his breakthrough, then the Heaven Splitting Battle Sect would lose the pillar holding it up.

Boss Bao and the others might be strong, but they hadn’t fully matured yet. If Long Chen also died inside, the Heaven Splitting Battle Sect would be doomed.

“Don’t worry, no one can take this life of mine, not even the heavens.” Long Chen patted his chest confidently. He was delighted inside.

The two of them returned to the Heaven Splitting Battle Sect. They decided that Long Chen should return in one month.

At the same time, the old man told him that the Heaven Splitting Battle Sect’s divine spring had been revived. Bao Buping and Chang Hao had already entered, and it wouldn’t be long before they could advance to become Empyreans.

Based on the density of their divine spring, other than Bao Buping and Chang Hao, there was enough to give rise to two more Empyreans, and the old man asked Long Chen if he wanted two of his people to go through it.

During normal times, the divine spring was nothing more than decoration, or perhaps a kind of symbol. However, the world had changed. Karmic luck was subtly shifting. Divine springs could now be activated to produce stronger experts.

However, Long Chen didn’t accept. Li Tianxuan had also asked Long Chen about this, saying that the Xuantian Dao Sect’s divine spring had gathered so much karmic luck that it could allow ten disciples to undergo its baptism.

Long Chen had directly said that the Dragonblood Legion wouldn’t take a single one of those spots, and Li Tianxuan could use them as he pleased.

Li Tianxuan had simply nodded. Both of them could understand what the other was thinking with just a look.

Long Chen had found that Li Tianxuan understood him very well. There was no need for him to say too much.

Long Chen didn’t want to rely on the Xuantian Dao Sect. He understood his bad luck far too well. If he leaned on a mountain, it would collapse; if he relied on a sea, the sea would dry up.

If he was too dependent on the Xuantian Dao Sect, he would bring a calamity to the sect. That was why he did his best to rely on his own power to advance.

Previously, Long Chen hadn’t put much confidence in the existence known as karma. However, after dealing with his bad luck for years, he ended up believing more and more that he was an unlucky star.

That was why no matter what he did, he had to be careful not to implicate anyone. Perhaps others wouldn’t understand such a thing, but Long Chen found that Li Tianxuan seemed to be able to read his mind, and both understood and supported his decisions. And it made Long Chen feel very grateful.

Having refused the Xuantian Dao Sect’s spots, he naturally wouldn’t take the Heaven Splitting Battle Sect’s.

Since the old man needed to rest, Long Chen didn’t overstay his welcome. Bao Buping and Chang Hao were in the midst of the baptism of the divine pool so he didn’t disturb them either. After saying goodbye to the bosses, he went to the Eastern Xuan City and found Zheng Wenlong.

As soon as he arrived at the Huayun auction house, Zheng Wenlong came over with two spatial rings.

“One of these is your portion of the current profits from the sale of those medicinal pills. There’s a total of eighty million spirit crystals. The other one contains two hundred million which is a loan I got from the higher-ups. My pocket’s a bit tight lately, and most of my wealth is tied up in assets that can’t be turned into money in a short time. After two months, I should have some more money to support you,” said Zheng Wenlong.

“Many thanks. Having a god of wealth as a friend really is nice.”

Long Chen smiled and accepted the two spatial rings. He was extremely grateful. Having Zheng Wenlong as a friend was truly a blessing. He had helped Long Chen out greatly.

“The medicinal pills you gave me last time should be enough for you to reconstruct the Xuantian Dao Sect, but you have to know that changing objects into money takes time. I’ve just taken on the Eastern Xuan Region’s business, and most of my wealth is still in assets. Turning that into money is a bit difficult. But don’t worry, you can continue with your construction as I continue to make more money. According to the plan you sent me, this shouldn’t stall your construction,” said Zheng Wenlong.

“Alright. Then I’ll thank you for your trouble, brother Wenlong.” Long Chen cupped his fists in thanks.

After chatting a bit more with Zheng Wenlong, Long Chen learned that he really didn’t have it easy. Most of his wealth was tied up right now, and the amount he had given him was the maximum amount possible.

Long Chen didn’t say too many courteous words. He knew that giving him this much money so quickly would reduce Zheng Wenlong’s potential future profit. He recorded his favor in his heart. As long as he didn’t die, he would return this favor with interest.

After saying goodbye to Zheng Wenlong, Long Chen returned to the Xuantian Dao Sect. As soon as he arrived, he saw a very bustling scene.
