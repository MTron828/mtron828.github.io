Chapter 3184 Refining the Dragon Scale

At this moment, a dragon roar resounded through the air, crumbling the mountains surrounding Long Chen instantly. Even space collapsed and the laws of time twisted. In this chaos, fragments of spacetime flew about.

Long Chen’s white dragon scales instantly exploded, and he became a bloody mess.

Right now, the golden dragon scale’s domineering will was stripping away his azure dragon essence blood. Golden light slowly flowed into Long Chen’s body.

Just as Long Chen was absorbing the golden dragon essence blood, a group of figures appeared in the distance, watching Long Chen secretly. Amongst them were Bai Shishi’s mother, Bai Xiaole’s mother, Bai Zhantang, as well as over ten white-haired elders.

One of them in particular was someone that Long Chen would recognize. It was the elder that he had encountered the first time he entered the Divine Scripture Pavilion. It was the elder cleaning up the bookcases.

Other than him, the other elders were so old that their wrinkles were deeper than tree bark, and their eyes were white with age. They seemed so old that they couldn’t even open their eyes.

Moreover, Bai Zhantang and his wives didn’t even dare to breathe loudly in front of them. They were filled with reverence for them.

“Has the spatial barrier been set up?” asked the bookcase elder.

“Reporting to the dean, I’ve set up three layers. No one should be able to look into this space,” said Bai Xiaole’s mother.

This elder was precisely the High Firmament Academy’s current dean, Bai Letian. Long Chen would definitely jump in shock if he learned this.

“Add another two layers,” said Bai Letian after a moment’s thought.

“Yes.” Bai Xiaole’s mother nodded and vanished.

“Dad, you don’t trust in Xiaoyu’s power?” asked Bai Zhantang.

Bai Xiaole’s mother possessed the Three Flower Pupils and a powerful spatial power, so the barriers that she set up could not be seen through by others, especially not with three layers. For the dean to request an additional two layers was too much in Bai Zhantang’s opinion.

“I naturally believe in her power. But Long Chen’s matter involves major affairs. I have no choice but to be cautious,” said Bai Letian.

Before Bai Zhantang could reply, Bai Shishi’s mother pulled on him and gave him a look. Only then did he shut his mouth. She said, “Long Chen really is amazing. Without competing with the true dragon’s will, he has obtained its approval and started the merger.”

“His body is like a dragon’s. If he wasn’t a nine star heir, I would suspect him to be the reincarnation of a dragon. But how can a nine star heir be related to the dragon race? Furthermore, his cultivation technique has deviated from the realm of the nine stars. It’s inexplicable,” said the elder.

“Letian, you dragged us out of our coffins just for this little fellow?” asked one of the other elders. His voice was rough and dry, like wood rubbing. It was as if he hadn’t spoken in ten thousand years.

“Letian wouldn’t dare to disturb the Immortal Elders for such a thing. It was the will of the master sweeper,” said Bai Letian.

Hearing that, those elders no longer said another word. They turned to Long Chen.

Long Chen didn’t know that so many experts were watching him in secret. But even if he knew, he wouldn’t care.

The golden dragon scale didn’t fight him at all, and the dragon blood slowly merged into his body. He didn’t know if this was special treatment because it was related to the descendant of the dragon expert, but it was only when the dragon blood entered his body that he understood just how terrifying it was.

He was already at the peak of the Divine Flame realm, and his physical body had reached a terrifying level. But as soon as a single drop of this blood entered his body, his flesh exploded and his bones shattered. His body appeared incredibly weak in front of it.

The golden dragon blood repeatedly destroyed his body and meridians before repairing them and destroying them again. They were strengthened several times with every rebirth, but it still wasn’t enough.

The pain of his meridians being destroyed was difficult to endure, but it didn’t affect his consciousness. This was only possible because of his willpower.

Eventually, his meridians had been reborn over a hundred times and stopped breaking. His meridians had obtained the approval of the dragon blood.

The meridians were the most important network in the human body. Only when they were strong enough could they carry immense power throughout every part of the body.

The meridians didn’t just need to endure bloodline power, but they also had to endure the impact of spiritual yuan, divine flame power, thunderforce, flame energy, and other kinds of power. Hence, the strength of the meridians was essential.

Now that his meridians were strong enough, the dragon blood began to circulate through his body. His body rumbled.

Long Chen then fell to the ground, limp like dough. His bones shattered and his skin split open. Nail-sized fragments of his bones began to pierce out of his skin. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

“Bone replacement…” Long Chen was covered in sweat. The pain of this bone replacement far surpassed the pain of having his meridians reborn. Furthermore, it wasn’t done in one go.

His new bones were several times stronger but still didn’t meet the requirements of the golden dragon blood. As a result, Long Chen underwent a brutal torture. He didn’t know how many times his bones were replaced, and fragments of bones formed a small hill around him.

Finally, his bones reached the necessary strength. His flesh then began to be torn apart and restored, but this pain was no longer terrifying to Long Chen.

Long Chen stood up, allowing his flesh to be stripped away and replaced. Blood dyed the earth red, but he didn’t care at all. In order to fully transform, he needed to expel that remnant power.

His body continued to grow stronger and stronger. After that, golden lines began to appear on his newborn flesh. He could already sense its terrifying power.

The golden dragon blood continuously strengthened his body. At this moment, golden dragon scales gradually appeared on his body. Those scales shone brightly as if they were made of gold.

When the final drop of blood exited the scale and entered his body, the dragon scale transformed to dust. As for Long Chen’s golden scales, they blazed with light, and a brilliant dragon roar once more resounded throughout the heavens.

With Long Chen at the core, a golden ripple spread in every direction. Wherever that ripple passed, the void exploded and the ten thousand Daos crumbled. Suddenly, a barrier of light appeared, but it instantly shattered.

The ripple then smashed into the next barrier. That barrier instantly became covered in cracks and shattered after a few seconds as well.

Standing in the distance, Bai Zhantang sucked in a cold gasp of air. He finally understood why Bai Letian wanted five barriers.

“This is a true dragon’s sacred power?” Bai Shishi’s mother stared in shock.
