Chapter 4133 Scram or Die

Long Chen passed through the barrier and was surprised by what he sensed.

“This pressure, isn’t it a bit similar to the Vermilion Bird pressure inside the trial by fire? Is the Vermilion Bird Empire’s divine beast an Eternal expert?”

“I’m not sure. The secrets of the Vermilion Bird Empire are only transmitted from emperor to emperor. However, the pressure really is a bit similar. But the Vermilion Bird’s pressure was sacred, while this pressure is violent and also contains boundless resentment. It’s unpleasant,” said Yu Qingxuan.

“But of course. The Vermilion Bird is worshiped, while this winged devil is nailed here. The circumstances are completely different. The winged devil naturally gives off a different feeling,” said Long Chen.

Long Chen and Yu Qingxuan had experienced this kind of pressure in the trial by fire, so this violent pressure was nothing to them.

The two of them smiled and talked as they walked through. As for the Dragonblood warriors, they paused for a moment upon crossing the barrier, but they continued following Long Chen immediately after that.

Seeing their nonchalance, the expressions on the Fullmoon race’s disciples changed. Although Long Chen and the others could be considered their own people, it was still quite a painful slap in the face for them to be stuck at the entrance while Long Chen and the others easily passed through.

In truth, the reason they were unable to stay within the barrier wasn’t because the actual pressure was so great, but because of the impact on their wills.

The Fullmoon race’s disciples indeed spent all year fighting the dark creatures. However, everything was always under control, making it not very dangerous. Thus, their combat experience could be considered acceptable, but in terms of will, they were still lacking.

Thankfully, the pressure from this Great Desolate Winged Devil was a perfect opportunity for them to temper their wills. With so many outstanding people only a few thousand miles from its body now, the Fullmoon race’s disciples were triggered. At the very least, they couldn’t lose the face of the Fullmoon race.ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

After multiple attempts, many of their disciples managed to stabilize themselves within the barrier. However, enduring the overwhelming pressure proved to be an agonizing ordeal, as it gnawed at the very core of their souls, filling them with a profound and haunting dread.

Only people who had truly been tempered by blood and fire could be fearless toward death, so they were still lacking in this regard. Although they managed to enter, they were forced to pause at the outer edge.

As for Long Chen and the others, they had gone far beyond. The most outstanding disciples of the Fullmoon race followed behind him for an incense stick’s worth of time before finally being forced to pause.

Currently, amongst hundreds of thousands of disciples, less than ten thousand were managing to stick behind Long Chen. The elders of the Fullmoon race were already starting to record their names.

The potential of these disciples was gradually revealed in front of the pressure from the Great Desolate Winged Devil. Although it couldn’t be a precise judgment of a person’s future peak, it could be used as a reference.

After all, the Fullmoon race’s resources were limited, so the elders had to consider how they would split those resources. The best resources had to be used on the edge of the blade.

After advancing for an hour, another barrier appeared in front of their group. Just like that, Long Chen and the Dragonblood warriors passed straight through.

As for the Fullmoon disciples, they were stopped. Of their ten thousand disciples, only over three hundred managed to walk past this barrier. The rest felt their souls stinging with pain when they entered, so they had no choice but to retreat.

Xu Changchuan told them not to be impatient. The worst thing would be for them to injure themselves due to some rash stubbornness. That would affect their display in the Sage King Convention.

Three hundred people followed the Dragonblood Legion deeper. When they were no more than thirty thousand miles away, another barrier appeared. This time, only Xu Changchuan alone managed to walk through with Long Chen and the others.

Influenced by the backs of the Dragonblood warriors, the Fullmoon disciples clenched their teeth. They hated themselves for being weak. The Fullmoon race had raised them carefully, but they were actually inferior to any ordinary warrior of the Dragonblood Legion. Were they really part of the prideful Fullmoon race?

As for the Dragonblood warriors, after going through that barrier, they finally started to feel immense pressure. It was a pressure on their souls and bodies.

The pressure of the Great Desolate Winged Devil gradually took physical form. As the ground had been under this pressure for countless years, it was like metal, so when struck by a weapon, it only caused sparks to appear.

Because of the pressure, the air was filled with invisible blades constantly cutting their bodies. Thus, Guo Ran shamelessly summoned his battle armor, and Xia Chen summoned a runic armor.

As they continued onward, there were fewer and fewer people in the surroundings. However, those that remained all had powerful auras.

Long Chen’s group continued, not one person falling behind, so this spectacle moved countless experts. Some people were already asking about their origins.

“There’s another barrier. Qingxuan, you should stay behind. You won’t gain any benefits from this place, so this is about enough.” Long Chen suddenly paused.

The pressure of the Great Desolate Winged Devil was a way to temper the soul, but it was meaningless to Yu Qingxuan. Long Chen didn’t want her to take the risk and be injured.

Yu Qingxuan obediently nodded and didn’t continue onward, simply watching as Long Chen and the others continued onward.

Just a few dozen steps more and all the Dragonblood warriors suddenly staggered, almost falling to the ground. Creaking sounds came from their bones. It felt like an entire world’s pressure had fallen on their shoulders.

“Damn, what powerful pressure! We’re not even close to the corpse, but its pressure alone can crush a person apart!” exclaimed a Dragonblood warrior.

At this point, they were still three thousand miles away from the corpse, but the pressure had instantly grown tens of times. Even with the Dragonblood warriors’ terrifying physical bodies, they felt like their Blood Qi was flipping inside of them. There was a danger of them being crushed to death.

“If it was alive, killing us would take nothing more than a thought!” Xia Chen’s voice shuddered. This was the most terrifying existence they had ever seen.

However, if such a terrifying existence had died here, then the existence that killed it must be on an even higher level.

In front of this Eternal corpse, it was as though they were weaker than ants. They were unable to imagine what kind of expression it had fought right before its death.

At this point, the Dragonblood warriors paused. Only Long Chen and Xu Changchuan could continue onward.

Xu Changchuan’s body was starting to shake, and his breathing was ragged. He was also finding it difficult here, but he still persevered.

The two of them continued until they gradually reached the core. When they arrived, Long Chen was surprised that quite a few figures were swaying three hundred miles from the corpse.

Not too far in front of Long Chen was a group of people kneeling on the ground, kowtowing to the corpse. Long Chen was startled. But when he sensed the devil qi from their bodies, he instantly understood.

“Inferior human race, it is forbidden to approach the Great Desolate Devil Saint! I’ll count to three! If you don’t scram, you’ll die!”

Without even looking back, their leader coldly warned Long Chen and Xu Changchuan when both of them got closer.

“Who do you think you are? Do you think Boss Long San needs your permission to go wherever he pleases? If you don’t want to die, then scram! Don’t hold up Boss Long San’s plan to get rich.”

Long Chen snorted and swaggered straight toward those people, causing all of their gazes to concentrate on him.
