Chapter 3788 Mo Nian’s Intentions

“This rascal even came here?”

Long Chen and Jiang Lei saw two Supreme experts wrapped in chains. One was beating the drums, and the other was beating a gong. Both their expressions were so ugly as if they were mourning their mothers. But they still broke their throats shouting.

Countless people looked at them oddly as if they were crazy. They were like convicts and didn’t even dare to look at anyone. They just struck the gong and drum as they shouted.

“The limitless palace in front of the limitless mountain, the limitless trees before the limitless gate, the dreams of heavenly geniuses vanish without a trace as soon as they encounter Mo Nian!”

These two Supreme experts spread their voices far and wide. Long Chen noticed that as they shouted, the strange runes on the chains binding them would dim ever so slightly.

Countless people pointed at them and whispered amongst themselves. They all felt it to be strange. These two didn’t look like crazy people.

“Sensing their auras, they just underwent their tribulations and became Immortal Kings. Did the heavenly tribulation break their heads?”

People looked at them oddly. Those chains weren’t piercing their bodies. They were very loose and could easily be thrown aside, but the two of them continued to stay in them. They just continued to beat the gong and drum like idiots, repeating that strange verse.

“The limitless palace in front of the limitless mountain, the limitless trees before the limitless gate, the dreams of heavenly geniuses vanish without a trace as soon as they encounter Mo Nian!”

Finally, after saying it again, the runes on their chains vanished. They fell from their bodies, and the two of them looked as if they had been freed from a prison sentence.

“If we do it three more times, it’s over! Let’s start now!” said one of them.

“Fuck!”

The other expert didn’t have his restraint. It seemed that he wanted to unleash all his anger, so he punched his drum with all his power.

As a result, the drum exploded. The other person’s expression changed, but before he could say anything, the chains that had just fallen from them once more tightened around their bodies.

The chains instantly became covered in runes. At the same time, a black rune appeared on their foreheads. Terrifying death qi came from those two runes, causing everyone around them to jump.

“You idiot! Mo Nian said that after repeating it ten thousand times, we have to beat the gong and drum again in order to remove the curse! Now look at what you’ve done! You destroyed the drum! We’ll never be free from the curse! Go fuck yourself!”

The other expert roared like he had gone insane and directly punched that person in the head.

That person seemed to also feel immense regret and anger for his actions, and his reaction was a bit slower. As a result, he was directly killed.

The other experts watching jumped in shock. How could he kill his own comrade like that?

That guy was also startled. He had only been angry and hadn’t been trying to kill his comrade. Unexpectedly, it wasn’t just because of a lack of defense. It seemed that the comrade’s condition was weird as well.

“Ah! No!”

That guy’s expression suddenly changed. He thought of something exceedingly terrifying. Suddenly, the death qi swirled around him. After that, his flesh began to rot, and his aura of life faded away. His body turned to dust in just a moment, leaving everyone horrified.

“Who were they? What did they do? Who did they offend?”

“They mentioned Mo Nian in that verse of theirs. It was probably that person who forced them to do this.”

As people discussed things, Long Chen walked over and took a look. He looked at the dust they had transformed into and suddenly picked up the gong.

This gong didn’t look to have anything special about it. But there was a strange round part at the very center.

Long Chen rapped it a few times. The sound was a bit off. It was hollow.

Long Chen then punched apart the gong, and a fist-sized item fell to the ground. It was a compass.

“Damn, this fellow actually has such means. It seemed that in the Violet Flame Heaven, those people also had this thing in their gongs. It’s too bad that I didn’t think of it.” Long Chen only came to understand when he looked at the compass in his hand.

The needle spun a few times in his hand before finally settling in one direction.

“He wants to reunite!”

Long Chen smiled. Looking at the compass, it felt like he could see Mo Nian’s mischievous smile.

“Put down that compass!”

Suddenly, a group of people walked out of the ground. Three of them were Supreme Immortal Kings. Judging by their auras, they had just undergone tribulation.

The experts present had seen everything. Seeing Long Chen pick something out of the gong, they immediately thought that he had obtained some treasure. This location was outside the city, and they had numbers, so they directly came to rob him.

“Kill them. I don’t need anyone left behind,” said Long Chen indifferently, not even looking at them.

Jiang Lei’s lightning sword was already flying out of its sheath. Thunder rumbled and that group of over ten experts were covered by this single attack.

Jiang Lei’s meridians had been widened by the nine star heirs. He was now capable of instantly unleashing his peak power.

BOOM!

Lightning devoured this region. People only saw lightning and nothing else. Just like that, those experts, including the three Supreme experts, were instantly killed.

Their weapons fell to the ground; the lightning faded, leaving behind only a ditch.

Jiang Lei gathered the weapons. These were all powerful weapons, as the weaker weapons had been destroyed along with their owners.

When Jiang Lei sheathed his sword, the lightning vanished. His expression was so calm as if nothing had happened.Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

In truth, Jiang Lei had been itching to fight. His powerful meridians were able to endure a greater force, so he didn’t need to slowly unleash power bit by bit to avoid injuring his meridians.

They were now giant channels capable of instantly unleashing his power. In a life-and-death fight, he would be able to unleash all his power without hesitation in just a few moves.

If he had wanted to kill those Supreme experts before, he would have needed some effort due to his meridians not being strong enough. Now, he instantly unleashed eighty percent of his power.

As for the other side, they were barely capable of unleashing fifty percent. Furthermore, their haste caused their power to drop. That was why Jiang Lei could so easily kill them in one move without any special technique.

This move shook everyone else. Previously, quite a few people had been eyeing the compass. But now, they didn’t even dare to make a sound.

“Let’s go meet up with Mo Nian.” Long Chen clenched the compass and laughed. He was full of anticipation.
