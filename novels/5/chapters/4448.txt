Chapter 4437 Who Is the Inferior One?

Two angry dragon roars shook the world. When Long Chen and Netherdragon Tianzhao attacked, two giant dragon images appeared above the nine heavens.

One black and one golden dragon manifested above the sky, exuding a vast dragon might.

BOOM!

Netherdragon Tianzhao and Long Chen's fists collided, unleashing torrents of black and golden light that engulfed the world in a furious tempest. Astral winds then swept away the clouds, forcing the spectators to retreat even further.

“Are the two of them monsters?” cried out the Jiang clan’s budding Doyen.

Although the spectators knew that awakened Doyens were incredibly powerful, they had never expected the two of them to unleash such terrifying power without summoning their manifestations or relying on Heavenly Dao energy. This was purely a clash of physical strength.

Everyone was stunned. Those who could stand here were all powerful figures, and they could tell that these two were clashing with their raw physical power.

In other words, the power of their physical bodies had reached the point of suppressing the Heavenly Daos and the laws of the world, exceeding the scope of their understanding.

A Heavenly Doyen was powerful because of their Doyen power, not their physical bodies. However, Netherdragon Tianzhao wasn’t even using his Doyen power, and Long Chen followed suit.

This was the clash of the two most formidable physical bodies the onlookers had ever seen. Two enormous force fields appeared, one emanating in golden hue and the other shrouded in black.

People could clearly see Netherdragon Tianzhao covered in black dragon scales, as well as Long Chen in golden dragon battle armor. Their domains violently clashed against each other.

Both of their Blood Qi surged, igniting and intensifying in potency.

The resonating dragon cries persisted as Long Chen and Netherdragon Tianzhao remained in a deadlock. With one hand behind their backs, they relied purely on their dragon blood domains to fight.

“You are merely a human who absorbed some dragon blood, and I am a Doyen of the noble nether dragon race. To use a dragon blood domain to fight me… you really overestimate yourself,” said Netherdragon Tianzhao coldly.

Spectators were astonished to witness Netherdragon Tianzhao maintaining such a powerful domain while effortlessly conversing. Moreover, his voice remained steady and his Spiritual Strength unwavering. This indicated that he had not unleashed his full power.

Normally, summoning such a terrifying domain would require the undivided attention of even Eternal experts, rendering them unable to chat like this. Hence, Netherdragon Tianzhao’s ability to effortlessly do this struck fear into the hearts of people.

“Are you trying to make me laugh to death? Noble? If the nether dragons were noble, why would you join the Netherworld and ruin your pure bloodline as dragons? Is becoming a dog of the Netherworld really noble?” scoffed Long Chen.

Long Chen stayed fearless even against this dragon blood domain. Under Netherdragon Tianzhao’s pressure, Long Chen sensed the dragon blood in him undergoing a transformation.

Back then, the mysterious dragon expert had imparted its cultivation technique to Long Chen—the Dragon Soul Body Forging Art. After cultivating it to the next stage, Long Chen then transformed his dragon blood into egg-like cores.

Within those cores resided dragon-shaped runes that had taken on an embryonic form, and they maintained that state until now.

Unfortunately, Long Chen’s connection with the dragon expert was severed after that, so there was no one to guide him with the Dragon Soul Body Forging Art. As a result, Long Chen’s progress in it had stagnated ever since.

Now though, under Netherdragon Tianzhao’s dragon blood pressure, Long Chen’s dragon-shaped runes seemed to be stimulated and were starting to grow once more.

Long Chen had completed the transformation of his dragon blood into dragon tendons, so he could store the excess dragon blood energy in his tendons now. As the dragon-shaped runes became clearer, Long Chen’s dragon blood energy also grew increasingly pure and vast.

Long Chen’s dragon blood seemed to have endless potential, allowing him to feel extremely relaxed under this pressure. So, he had responded to Netherdragon Tianzhao’s mockery with a sharp retort that not only infuriated Netherdragon Tianzhao but also cut deep into the heart of the entire nether dragon race.

From the leaders to the subordinates, furious killing intent appeared in their eyes. If their looks could kill, Long Chen would have died countless times over.

When it came to the nether dragon race, many people knew that they were traitors of the dragon race, having sided with the Netherworld. However, no one knew the details.ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

Of course, even if they knew, they wouldn’t bring it up for fear of drawing a calamity upon themselves and their families. This was a taboo subject.

For Long Chen to reveal this in front of countless people, it went beyond merely slapping the nether dragon race in the face. This was akin to ruthlessly picking at their most ancient and sensitive scab.

“Inferior human, how dare you spout such nonsense?!” shouted Netherdragon Tianzhao.

“Inferior nether dragon, are you not clear on the truth? Since you could betray the dragon race, you’ve long since lost your spine. Why worry about other people talking behind your back?” asked Long Chen lightly.

BOOM!

Suddenly, Netherdragon Tianzhao’s dragon blood domain ignited, and black flames appeared throughout it.

His domain rapidly grew. Originally, both of their domains were the same size, but now the black domain instantly grew ten times larger, devouring Long Chen’s golden domain.

As the black domain grew and the dragon might raged, it was like millions of invisible dragons were violently attacking the surrounding area. Its explosive power forced the spectators to retreat even further.

Netherdragon Tianzhao was enraged. He seemed to have lost patience and was no longer playing this little game. He wanted to crush Long Chen right here and now.

“You damn human! You’ll pay the price for blaspheming the great nether dragon race!”

His thunderous roar sent shockwaves through the world, leaving the spectators in a dazed state.

Finally, everyone here could personally experience the terrifying side of a legendary Heavenly Doyen.
