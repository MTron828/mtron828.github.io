Long Chen chased down the ship with all his rage. However, the flow of space was chaotic here and so were the laws of the world. Because of these, Long Chen’s speed was affected. He could only watch as the ship flowed further and further away until it vanished.

Long Chen clenched his teeth furiously. He then smashed his fist on the surface of the sea, causing an explosion of water. Flames of fury burned inside him.

If he had properly looked after Bai Fang and Bai Rui, the two of them wouldn’t have died. He was careless, thinking that because no one recognized him here, he could relax his tense nerves. He hadn’t expected this Soaring Dragon Company, which was said to be on the same level as the Huayun Trading Company, would be so shamelessly sinister.

Long Chen then took a deep breath. Getting angry now was meaningless. He looked back at the whirlpool in the distance and calmed down.

Just now, that voice wasn’t a real voice; it was more like the expression of a feeling. Long Chen could hear the other side’s meaning.

That existence had noticed his Ghost Sovereign mark and thus decided not to absorb his essence blood. It even sent him out.

“Could it be that the people on the middle and low levels are sacrifices that the Soaring Dragon Company is giving it? Is it afraid of the Ghost Sovereign? Or does it have some relationship with the Ghost Sovereign? Thus it decided to let me off?” Long Chen sank into thought.

There was a terrifying existence at the bottom of the whirlpool. Compared to its cultivation base, he was like a speck of dust.

The Fiend Devil Eye. Long Chen had also heard of it before. Legend had it that it was a gate to the fiend devil world. There were terrifying fiend devils at the bottom.

However, such a thing only existed in legend, as no one had seen it. Furthermore, the academy’s books had no mention of such things, so Long Chen had always felt them to be nothing more than a story.

“Soaring Dragon Company!”

Thinking of this group of despicable little people, Long Chen’s anger, which he had just calmed down, rose once more.

Long Chen had promised to protect that brother and sister. Although he had told them not to leave him, this failure still stemmed from his carelessness. That was the only way that the Soaring Dragon Company had managed to deceive Bai Fang.

He had thought that after ending up so far from the Heavenly Swell Domain, he would have some temporary peace. But the cultivation world was full of dirty mud that dragged people down into its depths. Moreover, there were countless vipers and crocodiles hiding in that mud. One slip-up and your boat would capsize.

Suddenly, he heard the sound of a strange wind. It was like a sobbing sound, and it grew closer and closer. As it sounded like ghouls crying, it gave others chills.

“It’s the aura of a Ghost Ship!”

Long Chen was surprised. Sensing the direction, he rushed off toward that sound.

…

Half a month later, the Soaring Dragon Company’s ship slowly approached the dock. There was an endless stream of people coming and going on the dock.

The entire dock was tens of thousands of miles long, and all of it was for the Soaring Dragon Company’s business. This place was the Violet Flame Heaven, and it had a particularly bright blue sky. Also, the spiritual qi was abundant, and the Heavenly Daos were auspicious. It was suitable for cultivation of all lifeforms.

The Violet Flame Heaven was a cultivation world that countless experts dreamed of reaching. It was one of the three best-preserved heavens from after that ancient battle.

At this moment, tens of thousands of ships were coming and going on the dock. They were mostly merchant ships and hunting ships. This place was one of the Soaring Dragon Company’s strongholds in the Violet Flame Heaven, and it was bustling. They almost monopolized all the water transport in this area.

The ship that Long Chen had originally been on slowly got closer to the dock. However, no one came off nor were there any cheers. It was silent.

Following that, experts of the Soaring Dragon Company came out one after another, carrying cases off of the ship.

“Senior Qi Hong, it’s been an arduous journey. These people weren’t sacrificed?” A World King greeted them, but he was a bit surprised to see these cases.

That lead elder on the ship was called Qi Hong. Qi Hong said, “These people have good aptitudes. It would be a shame to sacrifice them to the Fiend Devil Eye. Place slave marks on them and toss them into the primordial desolate world to extract ores.”

“Senior Qi Hong, why is your expression like that? Did you run into some difficulty?” asked that World King curiously.

“Don’t bring it up again. When killing pigs, we ended up encountering a wild boar. It was quite fierce and almost caused the ship to flip over. I had to sacrifice two people of the Shi clan before I settled it and tossed it into the Fiend Devil Eye to be killed,” said Qi Hong, clenching his teeth irritably.

“No way! Of the nine Heavenstages of World King, only those in the first Heavenstage can pass through the wall between heavens harm-free. Were three first Heavenstage World Kings unable to suppress him?” asked that World King in amazement.

“Ugh, I’m not talking about it. It’s all in the past. Is senior Yu Shu present? I have an important thing to report to him,” said Qi Hong.

“Qi Hong, get the hell out!”

Just then, a heaven-shaking furious roar rang out and killing intent filled the land. This roar that sounded like it came from a celestial devil echoed throughout the entire dock over and over again.

The originally sunny sky instantly darkened. As black clouds covered the sky, endless death qi filled the world.

Everyone was shocked. As for Qi Hong, his hair stood on end. He recognized Long Chen’s voice.

He hastily looked into the distance, only to see a black ship far in the distance where the water met the sky. As the ship appeared, the entire world changed color, becoming dark and deathly.

This dock belonged to the Soaring Dragon Company, but over ninety percent of the people on it belonged to other powers.

They were renting the dock of the Soaring Dragon Company to come and go, and they had paid quite the yearly fee to them. On the other hand, the Soaring Dragon Company’s own ships constituted only a very small portion of the ships. They were only in charge of maintaining order.

The millions of experts carrying out their business were dumbfounded when they saw the world change color. When looking into the distance, their eyes almost popped out.

“Ghost… Ghost Ship!” Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

Seeing a rotting ship emitting endless black qi that infected the world, they felt like they were seeing a ship of death from hell.

On top of the ship was a black-robed man erupting with killing intent. The black qi of the Ghost Ship was merely a bit of decoration compared to his killing intent, making him appear like a devil god who had come to reap lives.

“It’s him! Quick! Activate the grand defensive formation immediately!” shouted Qi Hong in terror.

“Who is he?” shouted the other World King.

“He is that one I was talking about!”

“Didn’t you say that he was already dead?!”

“How should I know?! I clearly tossed him into the Fiend Devil Eye! Who knows how he got back out?!” Qi Hong was filled with terror and panic. Long Chen had come back for retribution.

“What is going on? How can a person control a Ghost Ship? What kind of calamity did you provoke?!” That World King grew increasingly horrified. Even his tone was no longer polite.

Ghost Ships were unlucky existences, and even World Kings were afraid of them. Now, a person was actually in control of a Ghost Ship and steering it right toward them. This surpassed the scope of everyone’s understanding. It was something that didn’t even exist in legend.

“Everyone unrelated to this matter should get out of the way now! Boss Long San is going to slaughter everyone remaining!”

Long Chen roared. He then spotted Qi Hong from a great distance. Upon thinking of Bai Fang and Bai Rui who had died miserable deaths, his eyes almost spat out flames.
