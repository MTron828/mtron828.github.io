Chapter 3675 Profiting from Disaster

“Big brother Long Chen, you can rest. Huo Linger and I will guard you!”

Three days later, Lei Linger and Huo Linger hopped out of the primal chaos space.

Two beautiful maidens, one in violet robes and one in red robes appeared. Both of them were manifestations of violent power, yet their eyes were gentle and warm. They were adorably cute.

What surprised Long Chen was that the always reserved Lei Linger that didn’t like to speak was suddenly being very active. That made Long Chen happy.

Lei Linger and Huo Linger were like a pair of sisters standing beside Long Chen.

Furthermore, Long Chen noticed a subtle change in their auras. Their auras seemed to be a bit more spiritual. They seemed a bit closer to the human race. He didn’t know if it was due to unleashing the Double Dragon Destruction with all of their power, causing faith energy to end up merging with them.

This time, their Double Dragon Destruction was too powerful, to the point that even Liao Bencang’s body was unable to endure it and exploded. They had exhausted a huge amount of his faith energy.

If the two of them were capable of unleashing such an attack a second time, perhaps the result of that battle would be rewritten. It had to be known that even an unrivaled power like faith energy was broken by the two of them.

Lei Linger and Huo Linger were both pleased. Clearly, they also sensed the change in themselves, and they were delighted.

“Amazing. Lei Linger, a trace of flame energy has appeared in your body, and Huo Linger, a trace of thunderforce has appeared in yours! In the future, when you use the Double Dragon Destruction, you might really be able to destroy the very heavens!”

This was the result of the faith energy mixing with both of their full powers in that attack.

Every time the two of them unleashed all their power like that, they would pull back whatever remnant energy was hanging in the air to recover. This time, they ended up pulling in a bit of faith energy as well.

Furthermore, this faith energy contained both of their energies as well, resulting in both of their energies appearing in their bodies.

This subtle change made Long Chen sigh in wonder. He had been wondering how he could make them merge their power better. Now, their cooperation would be flawless.

Lightning and flames couldn’t be truly merged. In truth, their Double Dragon Destruction was a detonation of their own energies at the same time, resulting in amazing destructive power.

When it came to actually merging them, throughout all their years and countless attempts from Long Chen, they were unable to do so. But now, they managed to accomplish it with Liao Bencang’s help.

Faith energy was truly mysterious. It was unfathomable. But it managed to resolve a problem that Long Chen had been unable to solve for so many years.

Just seeing Lei Linger’s warm smile, Long Chen could tell that she was influenced by Huo Linger’s character. Both of their spirits were connected, turning them into true sisters who were closer than blood. There was no longer the slightest rejection.RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

“Big brother Long Chen, I suddenly feel like I have a body of flesh and blood too. I can sense the circulation of the Heavenly Daos. I can feel the growth of all living creatures. I can sense the emotional changes in people. Am I now a human?” Lei Linger hugged Long Chen’s arm and smiled delightedly.

Lei Linger and Huo Linger had truly gone through an immense change this time. Their spiritual fluctuations were also more intense, and they were able to differentiate their own feelings.

“You’re people, just like me. We’re all good people.” Long Chen smiled.

Lei Linger and Huo Linger were spiritual bodies. Even if they had human feelings, they weren’t really human. They were spirits of the Heavenly Daos.

However, they had been with Long Chen for so long that they thirsted to be like him. Long Chen naturally wouldn’t be so foolish as to break that dream of theirs.

“Hehe, we’re people too!”

Lei Linger and Huo Linger held hands and jumped around delightedly. They truly were like pure children. However, these two children possessed a power that would terrify countless people.

With Lei Linger and Huo Linger helping to guard them, Long Chen focused entirely on refining pills.

Ten days later, Xia Chen and Guo Ran came out of seclusion. Thanks to the pills that Long Chen gave them, they were fully recovered.

“It’s so vexing. I thought that with a Supreme Bone, I could dominate for at least a few years. I didn’t think that I’d be the one beaten in less than a month after obtaining it. Where is the justice?” grumbled Guo Ran.

In truth, when he obtained the Supreme Bone, he wasn’t thinking about dominating for a few years but for a lifetime. He would walk to the pinnacle of the Martial Dao, becoming an existence that all others looked up to. Saying just a few years was to express that he wasn’t so arrogant.

Even all three of them combined had been beaten by Liao Bencang. If Long Chen hadn’t used the Purgatory Eyes, the three of them would have been killed. It was truly an impact on him.

“You’re not bad. You’ve profited from this disaster. Has the faith energy caused the runes in your body to loosen? When you pull the runes back in, they will merge into the very essence of your bones. Those runes will now fully merge with you, giving you a perfect merger with your Supreme Bone. It’ll be just like your real arm. You should thank Liao Bencang. If it weren’t for his faith energy, you wouldn’t be able to reach such a perfect merger without at least a few years!” said Xia Chen.

“Really?” Guo Ran was filled with disbelief. But when he moved his arm, he was delighted. “It’s true! I really did profit from this disaster! This arm…”

Guo Ran jumped around delightedly, waving his arm. He moved his fingers agilely. He found that when it came to forming hand seals, this arm was even more agile than his original arm.

It had to be known that despite connecting the Supreme Bone, it wasn’t really his arm. It would be better to say that it was his weapon. He could use it but not as well as his actual arm.

“Hahaha, I, Guo Ran… Cough, well, I won’t brag for now in order to not slap my own face.” Just as Guo Ran was able to say some grand words, his recent beating reappeared in his mind. He wasn’t even in the mood to brag.

Although Long Chen had said that Liao Bencang would be terrifying, in any case, Guo Ran had still been beaten badly by a World King without any ability to retaliate. That made him sigh depressedly.

“Xia Chen, what about you?” asked Long Chen.

“I’m fine. This faith energy really did restrict me. Within that domain, my talismans and formation discs were badly affected. Some talismans directly lost all effect. In the future, I can only avoid people like that as much as possible,” sighed Xia Chen.

Xia Chen’s talismans and formations discs drew a large portion of their power from the Heavenly Daos. If the Heavenly Daos were locked down, then their effect would drop. In this battle, he was the one who had the toughest time. It was the feeling of having power but not being able to unleash it that was most aggravating.

“Boss, where do we go now?” asked Guo Ran.

“Let’s first go to the Wine God Palace. Just yesterday, big brother Xia Guhong sent me a message. He probably has something he wants to discuss.”

After saying that, the three of them put away everything. Guo Ran took out a flying boat and flew away.
