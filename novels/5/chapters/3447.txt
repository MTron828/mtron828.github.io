Chapter 3436 Lightning World Destruction

The power of that spear was incomparable. It was an attack capable of piercing through the wall between worlds. Back then, Wu Tian had used this attack to make a path for Long Chen back to the immortal world.

Thus, Long Chen was profoundly aware of how terrifying this attack was. If he tried to block it, he would definitely die. Let alone him, even a World King was incapable of blocking this attack.

The moment the spear pierced the Elephant Emperor War Chariot, Long Chen spread his arms, summoning eighteen lightning shields.

These lightning shields were as flimsy as paper in front of that spear and instantly pierced through.

However, they were not there to stop it. The moment the first one was pierced, Long Chen dodged to the side.

Long Chen’s dragon scales shattered and his blood sprayed out. He had managed to dodge the spear, but even just the shockwaves of its divine might left his body a bloody pulp.

Long Chen’s heart was cold. This attack had been replicated by the Heavenly Daos. So, based on the divine might, it couldn’t compare to Wu Tian’s attack.

Despite that, it was more than enough to kill Long Chen. With the heavenly tribulation locking onto him, if it hadn’t been for the Elephant Emperor War Chariot and the eighteen lightning shields, he would have definitely died.

The Elephant Emperor War Chariot bought him the time he needed to dodge, and the eighteen lightning shields gave him the right timing to start dodging. If he had dodged too early, the spear would have locked onto him a second time. If he had dodged too late, it would have pierced him.

Thus, these eighteen shields were not to stop the spear, but to give him the proper calculations to dodge. The moment the first shield was broken, he dodged at just the right time.

The spear then continued past him, striking the barrier below. That tough barrier instantly became covered in countless cracks.

Inside the barrier, the Sacred Pill Hall’s experts turned green. The barrier was only a little bit away from shattering. It was something condensed with the faith energy from Lord Brahma’s divine statue.

As for inside the war chariot, the eighth prince was hacking up blood. Half of his body was gone.

“You’re not dead? Then I’ll send you on your way.”

Long Chen was also covered in blood, but he didn’t mind. They were superficial wounds that didn’t affect him.

Lightning wings appeared on his back. After that, he shot toward the war chariot and grabbed it. With a howl, he smashed it against the cracking barrier.

“No!”

The eighth prince cried out in horror. He tried to escape, but his body was no longer listening to his orders. He could only watch as the war chariot smashed toward the barrier.

BOOM!

The crippled war chariot exploded along with the eighth prince. The barrier then quivered and finally shattered.

“The heavenly tribulation is over! Kill him together!”

Only then did the hall master react. The heavenly tribulation was over and they could finally join in as well.

The leaders of the various powerful races instantly shot toward Long Chen. The heavenly geniuses of their races had all been slain, without anyone remaining. So, they were all infuriated and demanded vengeance.

On the other hand, the flying beast race’s experts were led by the Lightning Falcon race, and they didn’t move.

“Keep up the act.”𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

Hearing the old race leader’s reminder, the current leader of the Lightning Falcon race quickly reacted. If they didn’t join the fray as well, their previous act would have been for nothing.

“Kill! Kill that bastard Long Chen who repays kindness with enmity!”

The leader of the Lightning Falcon race charged out with the major figures of the flying beast race. But even as the fastest expert, he was very slow. They couldn’t possibly try to kill Long Chen, or that would truly be repaying kindness with enmity indeed.

As the heavenly tribulation vanished, Long Chen’s body rumbled and his fluctuating aura stabilized.

He had successfully advanced to the Divine Lord realm. During the tribulation, he had possessed some of this aura, but that aura was transient, as weak as mud.

Now that he had fully advanced, his aura was as solid as steel. The current him was in control of a Divine Lord’s power.

“Four Peaks condense to become the lord of the heavens.”

Sensing the endless power in his body, Long Chen finally understood the meaning of this phrase that described the Divine Lord realm.

A lightning sphere appeared in Long Chen’s left hand. Just then, the shattered lightning runes that were the result of Wu Tian’s shattered spear transformed into lightning dragons that condensed within his hand.

It was at this moment that the hall master and the other experts reached Long Chen. Their divine weapons swung toward him.

Long Chen smiled mockingly. “I’ve profited this time. Not only did I pass through the tribulation safe and sound, but I even got rid of a Sacred Pill Hall in this world.”

The lightning sphere in Long Chen’s hand suddenly expanded, containing violent destructive power. Upon seeing it, the hall master and the others’ expressions changed.

This lightning sphere contained the will of Wu Tian’s attack, so they sensed the threat of death coming from it.

“Get away!” A World King hastily stopped himself and fled.

“Too late. World Extermination Lightning Radiance!”

Long Chen shoved the lightning sphere forward. That direction was where Lord Brahma’s statue was.

BOOM!

It was like the explosion of the sun. Divine light shook the stars and fragments of spacetime flew about.

The leader of the Lightning Falcon race jumped in shock when he saw this. He hastily led his people to retreat. Fortunately, they had been the last to join in, and so they were the fastest to get out of the way.

The divine light surged out like the devil’s tongue. Anything touched by this light disintegrated. Even half-step World Kings were unable to resist that terrifying power.

The flying beast race’s experts were the fastest to retreat, but some shockwaves still reached them, sending them flying. Fortunately, they were far away enough from the core area that they only coughed up blood.

The lightning destroyed space and time, leaving desolate astral winds in its midst. Now, the remnants of flesh and destroyed buildings floated in the wreckage. There were even divine weapons being blown about in the astral winds, and some unlucky fellows were pierced by those weapons.

After the devastation was over, the terrain had completely changed. The previous glorious city was gone. All that remained of it was a single statue.

Other than this statue, as far as the eye could see, there was no other human construction. This attack was truly earth-shattering.

One figure after another came out of the ground. These were World Kings. However, they were covered in dirt and blood. Within the core of the World Extermination Lightning Radiance, only World Kings were capable of surviving.

Within the deathly silence, the sound of flowing water rang out. In the distance, they saw a black-robed man with a blood-colored saber on his shoulder apathetically peeing on the divine statue’s head.
