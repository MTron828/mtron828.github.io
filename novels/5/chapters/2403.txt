Chapter 2393 Pill Competition

Translator: BornToBe

“How much money? To use such a vulgar word to weigh my household, it seems you really are a poor ghost,” sneered Ye Qian.

Long Chen curled his lips. “Despite your eyes looking like that, they at least managed to see that truth. So tell me, how many points are you worth? If it’s not enough, I’m not interested.”

The three hundred thousand points in his hands were not enough for these medicinal ingredients. The cheaper ones were already twenty thousand points, with the more expensive ones being over a hundred thousand points.

He guessed that some of these ingredients might be unique items. Due to not being able to produce more of them, they became especially precious. Based on what he had seen, there were many of them that he wanted, so he needed more points to buy them. For Ye Qian to challenge him to an alchemy battle was perfect.

“Points? Hahaha, if you want to calculate according to that, I have at least one hundred million points. Do you want to gamble?” sneered Ye Qian.

“What kind of gamble? What are the stakes?” asked Long Chen.

“It’s very simple. There are eight hundred and seventy-three twelfth tier pill formulas within the divine families. You can pick any one. As for the stakes, I know that you’re a poor ghost, so I won’t want your points. All you’ll have to do is kneel in the divine families’ plaza for three days and bark like a dog. How’s that?” Ye Qian was extremely confident.

“Big brother Long Chen, don’t bet with him. You don’t have any chance of winning,” said Wan Qing. She had witnessed Ye Qian’s terrifying alchemy arts. She was much weaker than him and had seen that he had been holding back. She hadn’t even managed to get him to bring out his full abilities.

Although Long Chen had also taught her alchemy arts, and the Pill Fairy herself felt great admiration for his alchemy technique, he was not a pure alchemist. He spent the majority of his time cultivating. He was under immense pressure just to survive.

On the path of alchemy, being stagnant meant going backward. No matter how great Long Chen’s alchemy arts were, having not used them for so long, there was no way they could have made any real advances.

Based on Wan Qing’s estimate, at best, Long Chen’s current skill in alchemy was only one level greater than hers. That level was not enough to challenge Ye Qian.

“What? Even fairy Wan Qing is worried about you losing. It seems you really are a spineless coward,” sneered Ye Qian.

Long Chen smiled and told Wan Qing, “Although I haven’t focused on alchemy the past few years, it’s enough to handle him. If my hands have gotten rusty, then I can just take off my shoes and use my feet to beat him. That will show him what a true expert is.”

“You…” Ye Qian’s expression darkened. Long Chen was looking down on him far too much. Ye Qian admitted that in terms of martial might, he was a far cry from Long Chen. But he had absolute confidence in his alchemy. Long Chen was nothing to him in that regard.

The Elders of the Divine Pill Division also turned gloomy. Long Chen really was so arrogant as to not care about the divine families’ alchemy arts.

On the other hand, the Pill Doyen was still standing there expressionlessly. If you were to look at him, he wouldn’t seem like some supreme Pill Doyen. He seemed more like an ordinary elder who had come to watch something interesting.

“Then does that mean you agree to the bet? Let’s go to the Divine Pill Division for the competition,” said Ye Qian, gesturing.

“Slow down. Although winning should be easy for me, on the off chance…” said Long Chen.

“On the off chance that you lose? What, you don’t dare to bet? Did the mighty Long Chen gain his fame by going back on his word?” snorted Ye Qian.

“Shut up. Do you think I’m that Ye Lingfeng of your Ye family?” responded Long Chen disdainfully.

“Nonsense. I might be surnamed Ye, but I’m not a member of the Ye family. Don’t think yourself clever,” sneered Ye Qian.

“Ah, no wonder that fellow wanted me to kill you just now. So you’re not from the same family. If you had just said that earlier, I might have given you some more face. Little fellow, how did you end up offending that idiot for him to want you dead? Did you give him some infertility pills?” asked Long Chen.

Ye Yaochen’s expression sank. “Long Chen, don’t try to sow dissension where none exists!”

“Long Chen, don’t play this game with me. You aren’t a good person either. Are we betting or not?” demanded Ye Qian. From this sentence, one could tell that Ye Qian detested Ye Yaochen on the same level as Long Chen.

“Well, continuing from where you interrupted me, of course I couldn’t possibly lose, but what about the off chance that we end up drawing?” asked Long Chen.

“What a huge joke. You can’t possibly lose, but a draw? If it’s a draw, I’ll give you twenty million points. It’ll be up to you to have that ability,” sneered Ye Qian.

“Alright, since you want to lose so badly, I’ll bet.” Long Chen laughed confidently.

Wan Qing grew uneasy, but there was nothing she could do about it now.

The Pill Doyen simply smiled, while one of the elders behind him shook his head. “This Long Chen is so reckless. He can’t possibly beat Qian-er.”

This elder was the division head of the Divine Pill Division. He oversaw everything occurring in the Divine Pill Division, and his position was only second to the Pill Doyen. The Pill Doyen rarely bothered with the Divine Pill Division, so it could be said that the division head was the ruler of the Divine Pill Division.

The division head was Ye Qian’s master, and he was well aware of Ye Qian’s alchemy arts. There were many areas where Ye Qian had already surpassed him. In terms of alchemy, Ye Qian could only be rated as monstrous, so he was of the same attitude as him. Long Chen couldn’t possibly win.

The Pill Doyen said, “You’re wrong. Qian-er has already lost.”

“What?” The division head looked at him in shock.

“Senior Pill Doyen, may I ask you to be the judge in this matter? I don’t want someone to lose and then renege on the deal.” Long Chen cupped his fists to the Pill Doyen.

“It just so happens that I have nothing else to do. It’s been a long time since the last pill competition in the Divine Pill Division. I’d like to watch it. Lu Feng, spread the news. The competition will begin in two hours. Anyone who wishes to watch may enter the divine pill plaza.”

Lu Feng, an assistant to the division head, nodded and left. The crowd began to grow excited for the show.

“Long Chen, I’ll watch how you embarrass yourself. I’ll await the show in the divine pill plaza.” Ye Qian sneered and walked away. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

“This child has no manners.” The Pill Doyen indifferently shook his head.

“Senior, let me apologize. Qian-er is still young and is immersed entirely in alchemy. He truly is lacking in manners. I’ll give him a proper lesson later,” said the division head.

“Being arrogant isn’t a bad thing, but past a certain point, it’s not a good thing.”

The Pill Doyen shook his head and left. The fact that Ye Qian hadn’t even greeted him before leaving was clearly rude. The division head hastily followed behind him.

The crowd immediately flowed out to the plaza. Even some of the people overseeing the wares were unable to stay still. They also wanted to go watch. Hence, they hastily looked for people to take over, with some offering to pay a large price to have them take over their shift.

“Long Chen, I’ll look forward to seeing you crawl like a dog. Hehe, it’ll definitely be marvelous,” laughed Ye Yaochen.

“The shape of your face isn’t bad,” said Long Chen with a faint smile.

“You…!” Ye Yaochen was infuriated but also afraid. He was truly afraid of Long Chen’s slap. He had never witnessed anyone within thirty meters of Long Chen managing to escape his slap.

Countless people had seen his slap, but for some reason, the people he struck were unable to dodge it. Although this move had no killing power against an expert’s tough body, the mental damage was truly frightening.

Despite being a fourth step Netherpassage expert, Ye Yaochen was maintaining a certain distance from Long Chen. For Long Chen to say that the shape of his face was not bad, that was clearly a provocation. But he had no intention of getting any closer, so he gloomily left.

With him gone, the only ones remaining beside Long Chen were Wan Qing and Shen Chengfeng. Neither of them were happy.

Wan Qing shook her head. “Long Chen, are you really confident?”

Long Chen laughed and rubbed her head. “Foolish girl, do you think I’d do something if I wasn’t confident? Years ago, I was capable of teaching you alchemy. Years later, I’m still able to teach you. Just watch as I show you what true alchemy arts are.”

Wan Qing relaxed slightly and smiled sweetly. After that, the three of them walked out of the treasury. The eighth legion’s warriors were awaiting them, all of them looking at Long Chen oddly.

“Enough with the stares. Do you have the drums and gongs?” asked Long Chen.

“Yes.”

“Good. You’ll be holding another performance today. Help me display the song that made the eighth legion famous.” Long Chen laughed, causing the eighth legion’s warriors’ expressions to grow even odder.

Shen Chengfeng didn’t know whether to laugh or cry. Was Long Chen really not the slightest bit afraid? He had bound himself and the eighth legion to Long Chen, so he could only follow to the end.
