Chapter 4394 Your Teeth Aren’t Bad

“It’s a Double Supreme World King!” A startled cry rang out.

Based on that person’s aura, they could tell how strong he was. The previous Feather race experts were no more than ordinary Supremes, and this person was much stronger.Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

Furthermore, he was extremely confident. As soon as he received the news, he charged over to kill Long Chen.

Crack!

“AH!”

Just as people thought that there would be an immense battle, all they heard was a single scream. The Feather race expert's hands and feet were brutally torn off.

Subsequently, blood sprayed through the air as his wings met the same fate. Long Chen then delivered a forceful kick, sending him sprawling away.

In an instant, it seemed the scene had shifted dramatically. People only saw Long Chen gripping a pair of bloodied wings as he declared, “Scram. Bring forth your race's strongest expert.”

Flames erupted from his hands, and he incinerated those wings.

“How vicious….”

People were shocked. Those wings not only symbolized the Feather race’s status but also contained the essence of their life's cultivation. By tearing off and destroying these wings, Long Chen had effectively crippled this Double Supreme, inflicting significant harm and humiliation upon him.

“Just you wait!”

The Double Supreme seethed with pain and sorrow, grappling with an unprecedented sense of disgrace. He flew off, leaving the scene in a hasty departure.

“Little Crane, are you scared?” Long Chen then turned to Little Crane, softening his voice. He tried to shield her view with his body, but a sense of guilt lingered. Fighting in front of Little Crane felt like desecrating a holy land.

“No, I’m not. They’re all bad people, and I don’t like them. I don’t feel good when they get close to me,” said Little Crane.

As an auspicious beast, Little Crane inherently didn’t like killing or fighting. Also, the tainted air of the outside world was abhorrent to her, causing her rainbow radiance to recede.

In reality, it hadn't disappeared; it was merely dormant within her. Little Crane chose not to expend her own energy purifying this dirty world. She knew that with her power, she would be unable to purify this world. So she refrained from attempting it. Instead, she just observed silently.

Long Chen looked into her pure white and black eyes and solemnly asked, “Do you want to go now? We’ve played quite a bit today.”

Long Chen truly did feel bad staining her eyes with bloodshed. He felt like an absolute sinner doing so.

“No, no! Mom told me I have to see more of the world! I have to learn what is right and wrong, good and evil. She also said I have to use my own eyes to judge whether this world is beautiful or ugly!” said Little Crane hastily.

Hearing that, Long Chen was moved. These words were definitely not something that Little Crane could come up with on her own. Did her parents really want her to see this?

However, looking at her pure face, Long Chen hoped that she would only see beautiful things.

“Big Brother Long Chen, please don’t make me go! I’ll be obedient! I’ll listen to you!” Little Crane pulled on Long Chen’s hand, looking very pitiful.

She actually thought that she had done something wrong to make Long Chen angry. That appearance of hers was truly heartbreaking.

Long Chen then hugged her, lightly kissing her forehead. “How could I make you go? As long as you don’t want to leave me, I will always stay with you.”

“Big Brother really is the best!” Little Crane hugged Long Chen tightly and kissed Long Chen’s face, making him laugh.

“Even with death approaching, you still don’t realize it. How foolish! Hand over that girl. You’re going to die anyway, so don’t implicate her.”

A group of people approached, seven in total, with the leader possessing a long tail and a body covered in scales.

These individuals emanated potent Blood Qi and Devil Qi, indicating their affiliation with the devil beast race. The devil beast race was normally classified as a low-tier lifeform within the nine heavens, as even Heaven Venerates of their race were unable to take human form.

However, that didn’t truly mean that all of them were low tier. When the world gates opened, powerful devil beasts walked through the nine heavens, dispelling the notion that the devil beast race was inherently inferior. They just hadn’t encountered any devil beasts with pure blood.

Just like the demonic beast race, pureblooded devil beasts possessed terrifying power and their own powerful inheritances. Moreover, they were inherently explosive, readily unleashing their full strength over the slightest provocation. Thus, people did not wish to antagonize them.

“A Triple Supreme!” A startled cry rang out.

Everyone here recognized the leader of this group, a powerful Triple Supreme. It was no wonder he dared to provoke Long Chen.

As a matter of fact, this Triple Supreme was far stronger than the human race’s Triple Supremes, as he had grown up in places abundant with primal chaos qi. In terms of cultivation, he had a huge head start over them.

When this Triple Supreme appeared, a powerful pressure crashed down, suffocating many experts to the point of not being able to do anything.

“You’re the one who’s going to die! My Big Brother Long Chen will never die!”

Little Crane was displeased to hear them saying that Long Chen would die, so she made a face at them. On the other hand, hearing her words, Long Chen laughed. This little girl really was adorable.

Seeing her, the Triple Supreme smiled sinisterly. “Little girl, I might not know who you are, but I know that eating you will be greatly beneficial to me.”

He stuck out two rows of sharp teeth resembling those of a saw, radiating a terrifying aura. That sinister appearance scared Little Crane into hiding behind Long Chen again.

"These teeth aren't bad," Long Chen remarked, studying the formidable dentition and nodding in approval.

This Triple Supreme didn’t know what Long Chen meant by this. Thinking that Long Chen was scared of him and trying to suck up to him, he let out a disdainful smile. He then waved his hand at his subordinates, indicating for them to attack.

His subordinates were all powerful Double Supremes. As they launched their attacks, blood-colored crocodiles materialized in their manifestations.

Aware of Long Chen’s toughness, they directly summoned their manifestations. Furthermore, they attacked at the same time, leaving Long Chen with no chance to counterattack. Their objective was clear: to eliminate Long Chen swiftly and seize Little Crane before the Feather race's reinforcements arrived.

Extending a hand, Long Chen summoned a seven-color shield in front of him. Their attacks shattered on contact with the shield. Furthermore, the six of them suddenly exploded without having the chance to grunt.

The Triple Supreme’s expression changed, and he suddenly turned and fled. However, Long Chen grabbed his tail and swung him through the air.

“I already told you, your teeth aren’t bad.”

BOOM!

The Triple Supreme was smashed into the ground by Long Chen.
