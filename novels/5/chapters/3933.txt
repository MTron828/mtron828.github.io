Chapter 3922 Each Harboring Their Own Thoughts𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

“It’s a seal! He actually sealed his own power!”

Guo Ran couldn’t believe his eyes. That heaven-shaking battle was fought while under a seal? In other words, Kun Tu had yet to reveal his true power.

“I knew it. Kun Tu and Long Aotian aren’t even breathing hard. Neither of them has brought out their true trump cards, yet you still refused to believe me.” Only Mo Nian revealed no sign of shock as if everything was within his expectations.

“We weren’t talking about Kun Tu and Long Aotian! We were saying that the Nine Underworld Luocha was the weakest of the three of them, and that she would either run or die first!” Guo Ran stubbornly clung to his analysis.

“Tch, I’m not criticizing you, but you are clearly lacking in terms of observation. However, don’t worry, big bro will help you. Have you not noticed? Whether it was when that giant was slain, or when Shi Yang and Yin Changsheng were killed, none of the three twitched in the slightest. Eh? Where’s Weng Tianyao?” Mo Nian suddenly realized that he couldn’t find Weng Tianyao.

Everyone was startled. Weng Tianyao was supposed to be fighting Lei Linger, right? Where did they go?

Looking around, they saw a lightning tower in the distance. Right now, Lei Linger was sitting on top of it, forming hand seals, seemingly absorbing power from within the tower.

When they looked closely, they saw Weng Tianyao struggling within it. He had actually been drawn into the tower, and his core runes were being stripped off of him one by one by Lei Linger.

Lei Linger had actually set her sights on Weng Tianyao’s core runes. If she could merge with those runes, she would have the human race’s aura. As the human race was the most spiritual of the ten thousand races, she would grow even more intelligent after absorbing these runes.

Seeing this, people could no longer feel such intense hatred for him. There was even a touch of sympathy on their faces now.

Just think about it. Both of his divine weapons had been taken by Lei Linger, and even his core runes were being extracted by her at this moment. If the runes were taken, he would no longer be a Supreme heavenly genius.

Now, trapped in his own lightning tower, he had to fight for his life in despair. Most likely, even he himself knew what kind of fate awaited him.

“Oh, what was I saying just now?” Mo Nian suddenly clapped his forehead, having forgotten the original conversation after this distraction.

“Something about us not noticing something, and that those three didn’t react even after the others were slain?” reminded Bai Xiaole. He had been listening very intently.

“That’s right. Do you not see? Kun Tu and Long Aotian’s gazes are still apathetic. It is normal for powerful fellows to feel that way. But why is it that the Nine Underworld Luocha can act the same way even though she is clearly weaker than them? Isn’t that curious?” said Mo Nian.

“Curious. If her power is weaker, why doesn’t she run? What is she waiting for?” asked Bai Xiaole.

“Just because you look weak doesn’t mean that you are actually weak. For example, you look weak, but to tell the truth… well, you are indeed weak,” said Mo Nian.

“...”

“Of course, even if you are weak, if you summon the Violet Eye Nine Tail Demon Fox, you will still be a supremely terrifying fellow. If it wasn’t being held back by you, it would have swept through this battlefield before Long Chen even came out. Only a handful of people here could beat it. After all, even in its weakened state, all on its own, it managed to protect us from Long Chen’s roar. We all saw how much power it endured. Tell me, are you weak or strong?” asked Mo Nian.

“Then are you saying that she will also…!?” exclaimed Bai Xiaole.

Mo Nian shook his head. “All I can say for sure is that she still has some trump cards up her sleeve. I can’t say for sure what they are, but it seems that all three of them have the same thought. Once they’re the last man standing, they’ll unleash their greatest trump card to kill Long Chen. After all, they’re very prideful. Even now, they are not afraid of Long Chen and want to beat him solo.”

This deduction shook people’s hearts. Mo Nian was quite meticulous, and his analysis was very reasonable. Guo Ran and the others had been thinking too simply.

If it really was as Mo Nian said, then the three of them were truly terrifying. Having just broken his seal, Kun Tu emanated an ever-surging aura along with earth-shaking Blood Qi. As a result, even from such a distance, everyone could feel an immense aura pressuring them. It was unimaginable how a person’s Blood Qi could become so powerful that it suppressed the very Heavenly Daos.

“Everyone, don’t look down on our enemies. Focus on your recovery. These three fellows are very terrifying, so let’s not let any accidents occur due to our negligence,” said Yue Zifeng solemnly.

Everyone nodded. Previously, they had used up all their energy to block the attacks of millions and millions of experts, so they were no longer able to help Long Chen.

However, even if they couldn’t help, they shouldn’t be hindrances. If something happened and someone were to suddenly attack them while Long Chen was facing those three, it would be troublesome.

Meng Qi then summoned a spiritual domain to help them rapidly recover. Regretfully, they had no wood element warriors here, or there would be no need for Meng Qi to do this.

At the same time, they couldn’t help finding it curious. There were only twenty-seven hundred Dragonblood warriors here. Where were the rest?

They were also anticipating many other familiar faces, for example, Chu Yao, Liu Ruyan, Tang Wan-er, Ye Zhiqiu, Zi Yan, Wilde, and so on. If they had come to the three thousand worlds, they definitely would have come here.

Hence, the Dragonblood warriors were filled with questions, but now wasn’t the time to deliberate on such things. They just focused on recovering as quickly as they could.

“Fuck, if I was in my peak condition, that Kun Tu would definitely be mine to kill. I’d then show the world the marvelous image of me shooting a Kunpeng down.” Mo Nian felt super displeased when he saw Kun Tu’s power soaring. He was also a peak expert. However, because of Long Chen, he had no chance to show off today.

“All of you can stop wasting time. Just bring out your full power. If I didn’t have an agreement with a senior not to use any magical arts, I wouldn’t have let you live this long. I’m supposed to beat you with only the physical body and the divine abilities of the dragon race. Furthermore, I have to beat you in your strongest state. I’ve been giving you plenty of time to store up energy. If you still don’t make your move, don’t blame me for not giving you that chance.”

In front of Kun Tu’s seal release, Long Chen’s expression was still calm, as if everything was within his expectations. Seeing Long Chen’s act of arrogance, the three of them were instantly enraged.

“Long Chen, you’re too arrogant! Today, I’ll show you the true trump card of the Asura race! Even if I have to die, I’ll drag you down with me!”

After saying this, the Nine Underworld Luocha’s face suddenly twisted. Her skin then split open, and fresh blood poured out of her body.

“Great Asura God, hear your descendant’s call! Hell of ceaseless pain, help me slay the blasphemer of the Asura God!”

Following her summons, the space behind her exploded and a mouth full of teeth devoured her.

A strange lifeform that was wrapped in chains and wielding a sickle emerged. With the blue flames burning around it, it exuded a dark and sinister aura, causing the entire world’s aura to change. When the people around looked at it, their souls felt cold, as if they had been dropped into hell.
