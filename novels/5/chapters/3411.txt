Chapter 3400 Lei Yuner

It was a small and tender girl with silver hair. She wasn’t slender but was very well-proportioned, with the right curves in all the right places.

Her eyes were silver, and lightning runes could vaguely be seen flickering within her pupils. When she blinked, a destructive energy came out that made it so others didn’t dare to look directly into her eyes.

When she appeared, countless startled cries rang out. 

“The Lightning Falcon race’s princess, Lei Yuner!”

“The Lightning Falcon race is a powerful immemorial race, and Lei Yuner is the first in ten thousand years to be born with an ancestral bloodline. She is the future empress of the Lightning Falcon race. She actually came.”

“Heavens, that’s a true peak heavenly genius! This human actually enters her eyes? Just how many lifetimes of fortune is that?”

Lei Yuner was famous, so countless people recognized her. At the same time, they grew envious of Long Chen.

It had to be known that the Lightning Falcon race had risen to the peak in the immemorial era. They were nobility amongst demonic beasts. Because of that, countless demonic beasts wished to marry into their race, but never had a chance. The Lightning Falcon race was too proud to marry other demonic beasts. So, normal experts could only look up at them.

For this proud princess to actually accept a human as a housepet, that was a huge honor and a huge blessing for the human.

Long Chen then looked at this pretty silver-haired girl. He couldn’t help smiling. “What? Do you want me to be your battle pet?”

The silver-haired Lei Yuner looked at him and also smiled. “Not a battle pet. It will be an equal spiritual contract. But I have to be the dominant one.”

Startled cries rang out. Lei Yuner was intending on forming an equal contract with a human?

This was linking them together spiritually. One person’s glory was both of their glory; one person’s loss was both of their loss. It was a tight connection that essentially turned them into comrades. This would essentially turn Long Chen into Lei Yuner’s future husband.

Countless demonic beasts were driven crazy with jealousy. Had Lei Yuner gone crazy? There were so many noble-blooded demonic beasts in front of her that she wasn’t looking at. Why did she choose a human?

It had to be known that those noble demonic beast races very rarely married with the human race. They had their own pride and refused to allow their pure bloodline to be wasted on humans.

Only second-rate demonic beasts were willing to marry with the human race, using them to get closer to the Heavenly Daos. Then there was a slight chance of an ancestral bloodline showing up.

But even with an ancestral bloodline, there was also the bloodline of the human race mixed in as well. There were many unknown variables. Whether or not it would be a good thing could not be said until the very end.

Hence, truly powerful demonic beast races were opposed to marrying with the human race. As for someone as noble as the Lightning Falcon race, for their princess to actually want to form an equal spiritual contract with a human drove countless demonic beasts crazy.Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

“Princess, you are tarnishing the noble bloodline of the Lightning Falcon race! You must think of your responsibility! Have you taken the face of the Lightning Falcon race into consideration?” One of the demonic beasts couldn't help stepping forward and crying out.

He was exceptionally emotional because he also came from a noble demonic beast race. The Lightning Falcon race’s princess was a target that countless experts were pursuing.

If Lei Yuner were to form that contract with Long Chen, it would be like watching a noble crane marry a toad for them. It was completely unacceptable.

“Please, princess, humans are so petty and low. If you allow him to stain the noble bloodline of the Lightning Falcon race, won’t that be a humiliation to the mighty Lightning Falcon race?”

Others also stepped forward, unable to endure such a thing. They were all powerful demonic beasts with their own backgrounds.

As they advised Lei Yuner, they also glared at Long Chen furiously. They looked like they wanted to tear him to pieces.

“Human brat, if you’re smart, you’ll immediately leave!”

“If you dare to enter the Divine Lord Immortal Realm, I swear on my family’s name to tear you apart.”

“A toad like you shouldn’t get crazy dreams, otherwise… Big brother, don’t get angry! I misspoke!”

The final person to threaten Long Chen suddenly saw someone glaring at him furiously. Only then did he note that the latter was someone from the Golden Toad race and was extremely powerful.

The Golden Toad race was also quite powerful. Although it couldn’t compare to the Lightning Falcon race, it was also an existence with an ancient inheritance. This race detested hearing people use toads as insults, so that person hastily apologized.

“My affairs are my own. I don’t need others to interfere. All of you, scram. Otherwise, don’t blame me for being ruthless in the Divine Lord Immortal Realm,” snorted Lei Yuner. Her gaze roved around the crowd with lightning runes flickering within her eyes. Seeing this, everyone instantly shut their mouth.

“So? What do you think? With my status and background, it’s not a bad deal for you,” said Lei Yuner sincerely, turning back to Long Chen.

The surrounding people no longer dared to make a sound, but flames were about to burst out of their eyes. They glared at Long Chen. It seemed that as long as Long Chen dared to say yes, he would instantly die a miserable death.

Long Chen laughed. If it was before, just due to these gazes, even if he didn’t say yes just to anger them, he would definitely do something to drive them crazy. However, this time, he ultimately shook his head and simply said, “Many thanks for your kindness, but I know my position. I’m not qualified to pursue you.”

Long Chen made it sound very humble. He knew that this girl was not ordinary. Her eyes contained a penetrative power, so he knew that she had seen something, which was the only reason she was making such a play.

The surrounding experts relaxed slightly, but they still glared at Long Chen with contempt. It was as if they were saying, count yourself smart.

“Am I not good enough for you?”

Lei Yuner smiled and leaned in closer to Long Chen until she whispered right into his ear with a voice that only he could hear.

“You have true dragon essence blood, the power of wild lightning, the mark of the Butterfly Spirit race, as well as the aura of the rainbow crane on you. If you reject me, I will tell everyone your secrets. I don’t mind telling you that the demonic beast race is quite violent. Any one of those things will draw countless experts targeting you. They will be jealous, and if they can’t subdue you, they will destroy you. I know that you're very powerful, but once you enter the Divine Lord Immortal Realm, with so many people targeting you, let alone searching for treasures, you won’t even get a chance to make your advancement. You might even die inside. Now, do you understand your current position? You better agree now.”

Lei Yuner’s eyes flickered with lightning runes as she stared at Long Chen. The two of them were only a few inches apart, and her face was filled with utmost confidence.

Long Chen narrowed his eyes. This Lei Yuner really wasn’t ordinary. She had actually seen through so many things. However, Long Chen indifferently shook his head.

“I don’t accept any threats.”

This response made Lei Yuner’s smile vanish. It was replaced with an icy cold.
