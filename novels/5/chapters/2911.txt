Chapter 2900 Berserk Blood Mammoth

Mu Qingyun’s sword danced through the air, and sword-light flickered. In just a moment, those beasts collapsed to the ground.

“How amazing!” Luo Ning watched in admiration as Mu Qingyun swept through those beasts. They collapsed before her, not even their blood able to touch her robes. She wove through their midst gracefully.

Behind her, Zhong Ling, Zhong Xiu, Li Cai, and the other powerful disciples formed up squads with the other disciples, charging through the beast wave.

Mu Qingyun had picked out the strongest beasts to kill, leaving some weaker ones for Li Cai and the others. That way, it would reduce the danger and increase their efficiency.

“What elites? Even in the face of deviled beasts, they can remain calm and suppress the fear in their hearts. Not bad, not bad.” Heaven Master Dong Ming couldn’t help praising.

These were no ordinary beasts. They had the blood of devils in their bodies, and that gave them a frightening aura that applied additional mental pressure on their opponents.

An ordinary disciple would be naturally afraid, but Heaven Master Dong Ming didn’t see much fear in the eyes of the Unfettered Alliance. Their combat power wasn’t suppressed.

Such an ability was the most difficult to gain, but Long Chen had managed to teach it to them in one month. During this time, he had taught them how to face their opponents head-on.

Even though they did feel fear, this fear no longer locked their limbs and turned their minds blank. Furthermore, the sight of Mu Qingyun at the front slaughtering these terrifying beasts gave them endless confidence. As they killed the beasts one by one, their fear gradually faded, and their battle intent rose. Their movements gradually became easy and relaxed.

In the first clash on the Devil Slaughter Path, only a few people were injured. Things then quickly stabilized. They pressed forward with no deaths.

The Unfettered Alliance’s display shocked everyone watching. The combat power displayed by those ordinary disciples was even more shocking than Mu Qingyun’s sword-light. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

For a genius to suddenly soar was no surprise. That was because many geniuses would accumulate their power in order to unleash a blazing light. However, Zhong Ling, Zhong Xiu, Li Cai, and the others couldn’t count as geniuses, especially not Li Cai and the other members of the Elite Group that had been considered trash. But their display today amazed even Four Peak experts.

People couldn’t help looking toward Long Chen. Just what kind of method had he used to turn this group of ordinary people into elites?

Ignoring everything else, even if they lost the competition, their fearless will on the battlefield meant that it was very likely that the inner academy would still accept them as elite disciples through a battlefield trial.

When everyone looked at Long Chen, they found that he was just standing amongst the disciples, overlooking the entire battlefield. He had no intention of helping against these beasts.

Long Chen was originally prepared for any mortal danger, but he was comforted to see that these Unfettered Alliance’s disciples really weren’t bad. They were handling things without him.

BOOM!

Suddenly, the land shuddered and a giant figure charged over, trampling over the other beasts in its path.

Mu Qingyun was startled. She slashed her sword, but when it struck its tusk, a metallic ringing rang out. She didn’t manage to sever that tusk.

“That’s a true devil beast, the Berserk Blood Mammoth! What’s going on?! There’s not supposed to be pure-blooded devil beasts on the Devil Slaughter Path!” exclaimed an instructor.

The immortal world’s devil race was terrifying and strange. Moreover, their blood possessed the ability to infect others. Those infected by their blood would be devilized, becoming bloodthirsty and violent.

It was rumored that the devil race had appeared during the era of primal chaos. There were many mysteries when it came to them. Regular beasts that filled this world might reproduce quickly, but they weren’t that harmful.

On the other hand, the devil race was completely different. If a devil beast died, its corpse would be consumed by other beasts, and they would be infected by their devil blood, transforming into devilish beasts. They were even more ferocious. They would go mad at the sight of blood, fighting until the last drop of blood.

The beasts for the Devil Slaughter Path were picked out one by one. But now, a pure-blooded devil beast had appeared, and that shocked everyone. This kind of mistake was unforgivable as such a thing could wipe out the entire squad. The lives of the disciples could not be used like this. Whoever bore responsibility for this matter would very likely be executed.

“Is someone cheating?! What difference is this from slaughter?!” raged someone.

Countless gazes glanced toward Chu Huairen, making his expression sink instantly.

“The ones in charge of this competition are the God Institute’s instructors. What are you looking at me for? Such a thing is strictly against the rules of the academy. Who would dare to cheat? Are they courting death?”

With that, people couldn’t help looking toward Heaven Master Yun Yang. Before he could say anything, the head judge said, “This is not a mistake and is simply an unforeseen event. That Berserk Blood Mammoth has only mutated recently. You can see that from the blood marks that are still on its tusks. These beasts were prepared three days ago, so this accident most likely occurred during this time… It can only be said that Long Chen’s side has bad luck.”

Just at this moment, the Berserk Blood Mammoth charged at Mu Qingyun, its tusks wildly smashing through the air. She repeatedly dodged and attacked, but her sharp sword-light was unable to break through its tough hide. She was only able to leave some superficial cuts.

With its giant body, those cuts were nothing. Hence, this was not an opponent that Mu Qingyun could defeat. It only grew angrier as Mu Qingyun dodged.

Suddenly, it let out a roar and the void shuddered. It suddenly gave up on Mu Qingyun and charged toward the other disciples behind her.

“Watch out!”

Mu Qingyun cried out. If that terrifying Berserk Blood Mammoth charged through them, it was unknown how many people would be trampled to death.

“Brother San!” Mu Qingyun could do nothing about it, so she could only plead for Long Chen’s assistance.

With a flash, Long Chen appeared in front of the rampaging Berserk Blood Mammoth. Its eyes were completely scarlet, but when it saw Long Chen, it suddenly dug its legs into the ground.

The Berserk Blood Mammoth’s thick legs left long lines in the ground before it came to a stop less than five meters from Long Chen. Dust and dirt almost covered Long Chen.

Long Chen simply looked at the Berserk Blood Mammoth, which looked back at him. One giant figure and one small figure simply stared at each other for several breaths’ time, neither side moving.

“What’s going on?”
