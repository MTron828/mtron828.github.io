Chapter 4855 A Saber That Makes Ghosts Weep and Gods Cry

“Will this really work?” After stabbing Evilmoon into the star cloud martial stage, Long Chen sensed Evilmoon absorbing the energy of these special bricks. He couldn’t help feeling a bit uneasy.

“What’s wrong? They can just make more of these bricks. Concentrate. I’m going to activate the Split the Heavens runes to their limit. I’ll lead the way this time. You don’t need to do anything,” replied Evilmoon.

At this point, Long Chen couldn’t stop it anymore, so he allowed Evilmoon to absorb the devil bone runes in order to activate Split the Heavens.

The brick that Evilmoon was stabbing into shattered, and cracks rapidly spread in every direction.

“Isn’t the star cloud martial stage supposed to be able to accurately judge a person’s destructive power? I’ve never heard of anyone capable of damaging it!” Some powerful seniors had lived countless years, witnessing countless clashes on this very stage, but they had never seen someone damaging the stage.

“For the star cloud martial stage’s evaluation to be wrong, either Long Chen possesses some lost art that allows him to throw off its senses, or he commands some supremely powerful divine weapon that exceeds the scope of the star cloud martial stage,” explained a Heaven Saint, sighing.

In truth, there had been previous cases of the star cloud martial stage making a misjudgment, but the most recent one dated back millions of years. It was so distant in the past that most people had forgotten about it. Moreover, that incident only resulted in the destruction of a single brick, making Long Chen's current actions far more terrifying.

As the second Split the Heavens rune on Evilmoon ignited, followed by the third and fourth, the bricks beneath Long Chen's feet shattered after losing their rune energy. The cracks spread across the entire stage as Evilmoon absorbed their energy. Eventually, seven Split the Heavens runes lit up on Evilmoon, and two black dragon figures coiled around it.

All of a sudden, every brick on the martial stage exploded.

BOOM!

When Long Chen raised Evilmoon, a giant saber-image tore into the sky, breaking through the barrier and shooting above the nine heavens. A sharp killing intent shook the stars above the nine heavens.

“Not good!”

Having a bad feeling, Cao Guofeng spat out a mouthful of blood, no longer caring about being secretive. Clenching this blood, he conjured a blood rune on his palm.

“Split the Heavens—Seven Forms in One!” Long Chen shouted, swinging Evilmoon down along with boundless devil pressure.

As Evilmoon cleaved down, the very laws of heaven and earth collapsed around it. It was an attack that even sent shivers down Long Chen’s spine.

Back then, Long Chen had unleashed all seven forms in one, but it was completely different from this one.

Evilmoon had absorbed the power of all the devil bone runes scattered throughout the martial stage. This concentrated power formed a singular attack, slashing toward Cao Shaoqing. Overwhelmed with terror, Cao Shaoqing felt like a tiny ant, realizing he was powerless to escape his inevitable fate of being slain.

“No! Gate Master, save me!” Unexpectedly, Cao Shaoqing directly gave up and fled.

“This idiot!” Cao Guofeng cursed when he saw this. After that, he roared, “Raise the Ten Thousand Blood Flag!”

With the barrier breached, Cao Guofeng's voice reached the inside of the martial stage. Upon hearing Cao Guofeng's order, Cao Shaoqing calmed down a bit. He then turned and thrust the Ten Thousand Blood Flag toward Long Chen's incoming attack.

Suddenly, a blood rune appeared on its pole, identical to the one in Cao Guofeng’s hand.

“Controlling a divine weapon through space?! Has your Iron Blood Gate lost all its dignity?!” Only now did Yu Luo take note of Cao Guofeng’s actions. The four Protector Elders raised their bows, prepared to shoot him to stop his support. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

“Seniors, calm down. Leave it to Long Chen,” remarked Mo Nian as he hastily rose to stop them.

The four Protector Elders hesitated. Just then, they heard an immense explosion from the martial stage. Evilmoon had collided with the Ten Thousand Blood Flag.

Shockingly, the Ten Thousand Blood Flag was sliced in two by Evilmoon. Afterward, Evilmoon continued its strike toward Cao Shaoqing. The moment Evilmoon touched Cao Shaoqing, he exploded, and even his Blood Soul Battle Armor crumbled. However, that wasn’t all—the giant saber image continued its trajectory beyond the martial stage.

BOOM!

The spectator stands were hacked apart. Fortunately, that spot was a pathway, with no one sitting there.

The people on the edges of the martial stage were terrified, their hair standing on end, jaws dropped, and bodies quivering uncontrollably. They were too frightened to even move.

This attack stunned even Heaven Saints, instilling fear in everyone and rendering the entire area deathly silent.

Long Chen was still in his slashing posture, while the Ten Thousand Blood Flag had lost its light upon encountering Evilmoon, with its runes vanishing entirely.

The once-majestic martial stage now lay in ruins, and as everyone gazed upon Long Chen’s figure, they were utterly shocked. Through this single attack, they finally understood how Long Chen had become the youngest dean in the history of the world's top academy.

Suddenly, the silence was broken by someone spitting out blood. All eyes turned toward the source of the muffled sound to see Cao Guofeng, the leader of the Iron Blood Gate, coughing up blood in shock.

Evilmoon let out a satisfied belch. “That really was a scrumptious meal. Those bone runes and blood runes were just what I needed!”

Evilmoon appeared extremely pleased. Although Long Chen didn’t understand why Evilmoon required these things, it seemed that Evilmoon had greatly benefited from this encounter.

Long Chen then rested Evilmoon on his shoulder and slowly turned toward Cao Guofeng, lazily saying, “Hey, old fellow whose face I slapped, if you don’t accept defeat, feel free to send more disciples of your Iron Blood Gate to challenge me... Or you can come up personally.”

In an instant, everyone’s gaze turned to Cao Guofeng, and the atmosphere grew tense.
