Chapter 3681 The Grand Dao is the Pinnacle of Simplicity

“Senior apprentice-brother Tian Yu’s calculations are truly accurate. Long Chen really did come out to face the challenge.”

A female disciple of the Wine God Palace smiled at the winged devil expert.

Hundreds of experts from the Wine God Palace were gathered. The table was covered in delicacies and wines.

Other than some experts that were traveling throughout the world, everyone within the Wine God Palace had already gathered.

The winged devil expert smiled. “Long Chen isn’t a person with patience. I refuse to believe that he could endure this. Furthermore, that Guo Ran is the master of wishing for more chaos. He would definitely drag Long Chen out for this fight. Senior apprentice-brothers and sisters, junior apprentice-brothers and sisters, a good show is about to start. Let me offer the first toast to everyone.”

Everyone laughed and raised their cups. Xia Guhong laughed, “I wonder if Long Chen knows that we’re watching behind the scenes, will he turn hostile on us?”

“He won’t go so far as to turn hostile. But we’ll probably have to pay for our sins with wine.” Just then, a voice rang out.

“High Priest!”

Everyone jumped. Seeing the white-robed and white-haired High Priest, Xia Guhong and the others hastily rose and bowed.

“High Priest, weren’t you wandering the world?” The winged devil expert couldn’t help asking. When Long Chen asked about seeing the High Priest, the High Priest wasn’t present.

“It was a lie for Long Chen. It’s still not time for us to meet. Everyone, sit. We’ll watch the show together. Haha, this opportunity really is rare!” The High Priest laughed.

Since the High Priest had said this, everyone laughed and turned their attention to the gate. The people at the gate couldn’t see them here, but the High Priest and the others could see everything.

When Long Chen agreed to discuss the Dao with Qing Yu, Qing Yu revealed a wild joy. Even though he did his best to cover it up, everyone with sharp eyes saw it clearly.

The disciples of the Tea Divine School had set up a large platform. It was like a martial stage with all kinds of gold and embroideries to make it appear extremely luxurious. However, in Long Chen’s eyes, it was simply a facade to cover up their shortcomings.

Long Chen knew that as they set up this grand stage, their disciples activated photographic jades to record everything.

In the future, they would rely on these photographic jades to tear down the name of the Wine God Palace and raise their own fame.

The Dao discussion stage was quickly set up. It was simply a formality to make it look official so that others couldn’t say that their photographic jades were fake.

Long Chen and Qing Yu sat on the Dao discussion stage, and a ceramic tea table was placed before them. Long Chen didn’t say anything and just watched them perform.

“Then let the Dao discussion begin!” Seeing that all the arrangements were complete, Qing Yu smiled with a very pleased laugh. His tone became much more courteous.

“Up to you!” said Long Chen indifferently.

“Today we are discussing the Tea Dao and the Wine Dao. I don’t understand much of the Wine Dao, but-”

“If you don’t understand the Wine Dao, why are you discussing the Dao with me? Are you trying to waste my time?” Long Chen didn’t stand on courtesy. He directly turned and walked away.

“Hahaha!”

Inside the Wine God Palace, laughter came from the various experts. Long Chen’s response was perfect.

Qing Yu was enraged but hastily said, “I was just being modest by saying that I don’t understand the Wine Dao much.”T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

Long Chen was in the midst of pretending to leave when he heard that and sat down once more. He then indifferently said, “If you do understand it, why don’t you tell me what the Wine Dao is?”

“I…”

Qing Yu stumbled, trying to think of a good response. He even began to sweat. Long Chen had completely broken his rhythm.

However, he quickly calmed down and said, “The Wine Dao is just like the Tea Dao in that they are drinking Daos. Through taste, you can experience the hundred flavors of the world and comprehend the world’s ten thousand Daos.”

Long Chen was startled. The flustered Qing Yu had actually come up with such a fine answer in such a short time. That didn’t quite make sense, did it?

Long Chen’s gaze then swept toward the distance, and a cold smile suddenly appeared on his face. He had grasped a very subtle spiritual fluctuation. It seemed that someone was giving this Qing Yu pointers. It was no wonder that this fool could say such a thing.

Long Chen now understood why these little ants dared to come here so arrogantly. They were backed by someone.

Long Chen had figured out what this Tea Divine School had come here for. They were intending on participating in the three thousand worlds and were planning on using the Wine God Palace to make a name for themselves in preparation.

“Fuck, I’ve seen shameless people but not someone this shameless. If you’re going to be so shameless, don’t blame me for slapping you,” sneered Long Chen inside.

Qing Yu’s confidence instantly inflated after answering Long Chen’s question, and he returned to his arrogant self. “The Tea Dao and the Wine Dao have similarities, but I believe that there is a higher and lower differentiation to be made between the two. What do you think about that?”

“You are called Qing Yu, correct? Qing as in young and Yu as in feather?” Long Chen answered with another question.

“Yes. Is there a problem?” asked Qing Yu.

“No wonder you’re so immature. At this young age, your feathers haven’t even grown out, but you dare to be so immature. For you to be able to live to this point, it means that your ancestors chose good locations for their graves,” said Long Chen solemnly.

“You…!” Qing Yu was enraged.

Long Chen flapped his hand at him. “Don’t get mad. I’m not cursing you. I’m just telling the truth. Your luck really is good.”

Qing Yu’s expression sank. “Stop changing the subject. We are discussing the Dao. Answer my last question.”

“Your last question? Oh, you said that between the Tea Dao and the Wine Dao, there is one that is higher and one that is lower? So you must mean that the Tea Dao is greater, right?” said Long Chen.

“Correct. The Tea Dao is taking tea from trees and plants, using the simplest method, perhaps frying, heating, drying. You then infuse it with the natural spring water of heaven and earth, and it is complete. The so-called Grand Dao is the pinnacle of simplicity. The simpler something is, the closer it is to the original flavor of the Heavenly Daos. As for the Wine Dao, all kinds of complicated procedures are involved. The fermentation, simmering, storage, and other processes have long since broken the original principles of natural simplicity. The Tea Dao is a natural Dao, while the Wine Dao is an artificial Dao that you created with your own efforts. How can something artificial be as beautiful as a natural Dao? That is what determines which is higher and which is lower,” said Qing Yu proudly.

“Well said, senior apprentice-brother Qing Yu!”

“Senior apprentice-brother Qing Yu truly is worthy of being a genius of the Tea Dao! This comprehension is admirable.”

“No wonder master says that Qing Yu’s comprehension of the Tea Dao is unprecedented. We are bearing witness to this fact.”

Before anyone else could say anything, the disciples of the Tea Divine School that had come with Qing Yu heaped praises on him.

Guo Ran, Xia Chen, and even Long Chen looked at them, feeling dumbfounded. Seeing Qing Yu’s natural and easy expression, it seemed that he wasn’t the slightest bit embarrassed by all of this praise. His face didn’t redden in the slightest.

“My eyes have been opened to the world.”

Guo Ran and Xia Chen were both amazed and said the same thing at the same time. Guo Ran thought that his face was already very thick, but compared to Qing Yu, his face was practically as thin as paper.

“You are saying that what is natural is definitely better than something artificial?” asked Long Chen with a smile.

“But of course,” said Qing Yu without hesitation.

“Well then, people are born naked. Shouldn’t you maintain your natural state? What are you wearing clothes for? If all of you dare to take off your clothes in front of everyone, I will admit that you are correct,” said Long Chen, chortling.

Xia Chen and Guo Ran’s gazes instantly fell upon those beautiful female disciples that had come from the Tea Divine School. Their eyes were full of anticipation.
