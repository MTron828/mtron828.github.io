Chapter 2525 Hating My Weak Self

The primal chaos space inside of Long Chen shuddered, and the majority of the karmic hell flames hanging in it were sucked away into the outside world.

Using the World Extermination Flame Lotus had exhausted Huo Linger’s core energy. As Long Chen no longer had the power to unleash it at full power again, he could only draw out the karmic hell flames.

The karmic hell flames immediately unleashed an intense blaze that rushed toward Ye Ming. Any members of the Black Armor Corps that were touched by them were incinerated.

The karmic hell flames were powerful, but Long Chen had to conserve a small portion of them for Huo Linger. Once she could devour them, she would be able to manifest herself as karmic hell flames.

As for the karmic hell flames that he took out into the world, they were constantly exhausted and would sooner or later extinguish.

“You still want to use this move? Naive.” Ye Ming sneered. He ordered the Black Armor Corps to charge straight at Long Chen. Their bodies suddenly began to swell.

BOOM!

Explosions echoed as thousands of them began to detonate, blocking Long Chen. This time, the void was sent into wild chaos that forced Long Chen back.

“I have countless warriors at my disposal, and they can use their lives to show their value. This tree’s defensive will is on the verge of vanishing completely. Then I can absorb all of its energy and have the fiend king recover to fifty percent of its peak power. At that time, even if experts above Netherpassage come, I can still wipe them out with a wave of my hand. You fools really did get dragged down by Long Chen. I’ll give you one last chance. Other than Long Chen and the Dragonblood Legion, as long as you retreat, I will give you a path to live,” announced Ye Ming.

“Shut up! You despicable demon, do you think the Righteous path would believe your lies? You’re the naive one. You’re just going to wipe us out as soon as we separate, aren’t you? Your word is worthless!” cursed one of the Righteous disciples.

Explosions continued to echo as the Black Armor Corps’ warriors detonated in front of Long Chen. He was unable to get past them.

Ye Ming was truly vicious. Tens of thousands of warriors were detonating with every blink of an eye to block Long Chen.

“Big brother Long Chen, prepare yourself. The Life Spirit God will open a path for you!” shouted La Wei from the rear.

All of a sudden, the sky darkened and cloud-like leaves flew out, creating a channel. Everything within that channel was peaceful. The detonations were unable to shake it.

“Idiots, I won’t let you pass.” Zhao Ritian suddenly appeared in front of Long Chen, smashing the Heaven Suppressing Dragon Coiling Staff at him.

“You irritating dwarf, come and fight me!” Wilde charged over with the door bolt. In terms of power, other than Long Chen, only Wilde could face Zhao Ritian directly.

“Scram you dumb oaf!” Zhao Ritian snorted and ignored Wilde, continuing to attack Long Chen.

“Long Chen, don’t waste your time on him. Leave him to us,” transmitted Chu Yao. Her senses were telling her that the mother tree’s will was growing weaker and weaker. It was like a dam was about to burst. All that life energy was going to burst forth.

Chu Yao, Liu Ruyan, Tang Wan-er, and the others attacked Zhao Ritian. Wooden stakes, willow branches, and wind blades coiled around him. Zhao Ritian roared furiously.

Seeing that Zhao Ritian had been blocked, Feng Fei appeared, pointing her sword at Long Chen.

“Leave her to me.”

Suddenly, two voices rang out at the same time. One came from Zi Yan, while the other came from Dong Mingyu.

The Seven String Sea Suppressing Zither suddenly quivered, and its previously gentle zither music became filled with a murderous aura. Zi Yan’s manifestation appeared behind her.

The sound of the tide resounded throughout heaven and earth. There was an endless sea within her manifestation. Immortal mist spiraled out of the sea, while an ancient zither floated in the sky.

The ancient zither blocked out the sun. There was a figure beside the zither, her long fingers dancing over the zither strings. With every note, the world rumbled.

“This zither… could it be…?!” Feng Fei’s expression instantly changed upon seeing the ancient zither.

Invisible blades suddenly appeared in the air, falling upon Feng Fei.

The blades pierced through the void as zither music played. Their tempo was identical.

Feng Fei repeatedly slashed her sword, blasting apart the blades. The sound of the blades exploding merged with the music, making it even stronger. The murderous aura also grew.

Bells began to appear in the air, smashing toward Feng Fei.

The air suddenly transformed into a sea of musical instruments. There were bells, flutes, sound bowls, and countless others. The zither was like the king of these instruments, pressing them onward.

As the tempo increased, the attacks got more concentrated, and the power grew along with it. The sky trembled. It was as if the music had become the Dao, as well as the heavens.

Everyone was stunned, not having expected the Zither Fairy to possess such power. She was actually able to use her music to trap Feng Fei.

Before this, the Dragonblood Legion had been worrying about how to stop Feng Fei with Mo Nian exhausted. But Zi Yan had truly given them a nice surprise.

Feng Fei’s manifestation rumbled behind her, and a phoenix cry rang out. Her sword unleashed waves of divine light that blasted apart the images of the musical instruments.

However, every time one of them was broken, her head would shake. They were not real, but they contained their own curious laws. When they exploded, strange sound waves would spread.

A note would appear within the zither music whenever she broke one. Gradually, she found that her own actions were sinking into the tempo of the music. She couldn’t stop herself from fighting according to Zi Yan’s rhythm.

Feng Fei was stunned. If Zi Yan could control the tempo, then she would fall under her control.

“God Extermination Slash!” Feng Fei’s sword suddenly exploded with light, and her Sword Qi enveloped the heavens. As a result, a giant explosion drowned out the music, blasting apart all the instruments.

Feng Fei finally had a chance to escape Zi Yan’s control. She then shot after Zi Yan to kill her once and for all.

However, just as she moved, her expression completely changed. As the void trembled, she shook and suddenly retreated. Her sword raised toward her own throat.

Sparks flew as the sword just barely managed to stop a dagger that was about to reach her throat.

The dagger then vanished and kept appearing around Feng Fei’s body repeatedly. Feng Fei’s sword danced. In the blink of an eye, the dagger had clashed with her sword dozens of times.

She could only sense the dagger but not the wielder. It curiously flashed around her, as if it was an emissary sent from hell to take her life.

Finally, in the final clash, she vaguely saw a small figure holding the dagger, but that figure then faded along with the dagger.

Dong Mingyu had tried to assassinate Feng Fei, but Feng Fei was too powerful. She managed to block Dong Mingyu’s assassination attempt.

When she vanished, Feng Fei was pale. Just now, any mistake could have gotten her killed. Every single attack had been a killing blow.

Just at this moment, she felt something hot on her neck. She heard startled cries from the distant disciples of the divine families.

“Senior Feng Fei has been injured!”

They all saw a thin cut on Feng Fei’s neck, and blood slowly dripped out.

Just at this moment, thin lines appeared in the void, slashing toward Feng Fei like sharp blades. Through Dong Mingyu’s attacks, the advantageous position that Feng Fei had made for herself vanished. She fell into dangerous straits once more.

The lines were like zither strings slicing through heaven and earth. When Feng Fei slashed them, zither music exploded in the air. This zither music was actually backed by Feng Fei’s own power.

With Feng Fei held back by Zi Yan, along with a terrifying assassin like Dong Mingyu lurking, there was no way that she could stop Long Chen.

Long Chen made a rush for Ye Ming. As for Gu Yang, Yue Zifeng, Nangong Zuiyue, and the others, they went off to assist the elders of the Luo Spirit race against the four divine generals. The others clashed against the Black Armor Corps in a desperate battle. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

“Long Chen, taste my trident!”

The void suddenly trembled, and two figures came rushing over. At the front was the Six Horn Sea Serpent, while Hu Feng was chasing him.

It seemed that the Six Horn Sea Serpent had immediately rushed back after escaping his bindings. The Sea God Trident raged with the sound of a giant tsunami.

BOOM!

Long Chen was startled. The Six Horn Sea Serpent seemed to have awakened some kind of power since their last battle. This trident’s power was truly terrifying. Even blocking with his full power, Long Chen ended up coughing up blood.

Just as Long Chen was knocked back, a spear silently appeared behind Long Chen, piercing through his chest.

“Long Chen, in the end, you still died to my hands.” Dongfang Yuyang smiled contemptuously, having appeared behind Long Chen.

“Long Chen!”

In that instant, it felt like time had frozen. Long Chen had been heavily injured by two powerful experts, and that spear was piercing his body. His life was in Dongfang Yuyang’s hands.

“Big brother Long Chen!” Qi Li and La Wei were nearby. Qi Li immediately sent her mount flying over.

“Don’t!” shouted Long Chen

However, his shout was too late. Qi Li’s arrow was caught by Dongfang Yuyang, and with a flick of his wrist, he sent it piercing through Qi Li’s body, also piercing the Golden Scale Blue Eye Eagle.

“Big brother Long Chen… the prophesied son… you will definitely lead us… to reclaim the mother tree… definitely…”

Even as Qi Li’s body fell from the sky, her eyes were filled with an intense thirst as she looked at Long Chen.

BANG!

BANG!

BANG!

Long Chen’s heart pounded. Darkness manifested from the depths of his eyes, and his aura turned icy and eerie.

“I hate my weak self.” Looking at the spear piercing out of his chest, Long Chen slowly grabbed the tip.

BOOM!

The spear exploded.
