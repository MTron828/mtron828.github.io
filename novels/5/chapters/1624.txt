Chapter 1619 Spiritual Test

Translator: BornToBe

The one who had appeared was a young woman in emerald-green robes. She was one of the Skywood Divine Palace’s Elders. As a wood cultivator, she gave off a gentle feeling. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

She was a Life Star expert. Following her shout, those people stopped, glaring at Long Chen.

“Since everyone’s a guest, why fight with your lives on the line? Young lady Han, you have a violet golden invitation card and can enter without registering. There’s no need to make things hard on others,” said the Elder while looking at the palanquin.

“I was sleeping and don’t know what happened. Since you’ve come, I’ll give you face. I can’t be bothered to deal with him. Let’s go.” A woman’s voice came from within the palanquin. She also didn’t want to cause trouble as this was the Skywood Divine Palace’s territory.

“Brat, count yourself lucky. Just wait. Don’t let me learn who you are-”

Pow!

One of the experts said some vicious words as they left, but before he could get them all out, he was sent flying by a slap from Long Chen.

“You’re the lucky ones. Hurry up and scram. Since when did dogs start talking so much?” Long Chen was irritated. Did these people really want him to kill them before they would be obedient?

“Arrogance! You are provoking me!” raged the woman in the palanquin.

“Hmph, a granddaughter of some branch alliance master isn’t worth me provoking. Youngster, you overestimate yourself,” said Long Chen disdainfully.

The most irritating people were the ones like this, who provoked others whenever they opened their mouths, yet cried that others were provoking them when they spoke back. Idiotic!

The fact that Long Chen said this showed that he knew exactly who he was speaking to, but he still treated her like this. That shocked everyone. If Long Chen really had such backing, why was he lined up with everyone? People of his level all got some special treatment.

“Hahaha, good! Then you can be arrogant for now. Once the Jade Lake Pageant starts, I’ll make you kneel for mercy!” laughed the woman in the palanquin. In all her years, this was her first time encountering someone who dared to take that tone with her.

Long Chen shook his head. He couldn’t be bothered to argue with a brainless princess. Their intelligence wasn't on the same level.

“Let’s go!” Following the woman’s orders, the others continued carrying her on her way. They glared at Long Chen, but they didn’t say anything again.

They really had to have something broken in their heads. They clearly could have just flown over if they had such special treatment, but they had to force people out of their way. Was that the only way for them to feel superior in the Southern Xuan Region?

Long Chen was feeling more and more loathing toward that group. He couldn’t understand what kind of mental illness they had. He supposed they were just lucky. If the Xuantian Dao Sect was in the Southern Xuan Region, he’d have long since helped cure them of their illness.

Long Chen sighed inside. The Eastern Xuan Region had been mostly cured. Did he have to be a traveling doctor in the other regions now?

Once she left, the Elder made an apology to everyone. She said that everyone should just calmly wait to register. As long as they met the standards, they would definitely be able to attend the Jade Lake Pageant. She calmed the emotions of the crowd.

“Thank you. If it weren’t for you, I...” The woman who had almost been whipped finally had a chance to thank Long Chen. If it weren’t for him, she’d have been struck in the face. That scar would have followed her for a lifetime.

“There’s no need to be courteous. Actually, I’m not that good of a person. I just felt angry seeing certain people’s actions, so I wanted to vent,” said Long Chen.

“I should tell you this... you shouldn’t attend the Jade Lake Pageant. Although there are many opportunities during it, that Han Feifei isn’t so easy to provoke. Furthermore, a genius from the Central Xuan Region is attending too, Di Xin. Di Xin is the son of the first wife of the master of the full ancient family alliance, Di Long. Not only does he have that special status, but he’s also extremely terrifying. There has never been anyone who has managed to last longer than three exchanges against him. He’s an unimaginably terrifying Empyrean. Here are a few travel expenses for you for coming this far, but please leave now so you aren’t implicated,” said the woman sincerely. She handed Long Chen a spatial ring. When he looked inside, he saw over a thousand spirit crystals in it.

For a rank seven Celestial like her, that was probably all her savings. Long Chen couldn’t help smiling slightly, his heart warming. He never asked for others to pay him back for helping them, but he did rather care more about whether they appreciated it or not.

If on the other hand, after he had saved her, she had stealthily slipped away, acting like she didn’t know about how she had implicated him, that would make him feel uncomfortable.

“Di Long? Why does that name sound familiar?” Long Chen suddenly felt that this name was familiar. It seemed that it had been brought up before, but he hadn’t been paying much attention at that time.

Now that he heard this name again and learned of his status, it seemed his position and cultivation base were not any inferior to Qu Jianying.

“Thank you, but I have to attend the Jade Lake Pageant. I can’t leave. As for Di Xin or Han Feifei, I’m very curious about just how much ability they have to be so arrogant. There’s no need for you to worry about me. My life is quite tough.” Long Chen smiled. Of course his life was very tough. He had even charged out of Purgatory. As for a little Jade Lake Pageant? Insignificant.

The woman couldn’t help but sigh sadly. She didn’t bother trying to advise Long Chen any longer. The crowd continued onward.

After half a day, they arrived in front of a huge gate. Some people were busy registering the participants and allowing them to enter. Long Chen saw that everyone needed to show their identity plate and also get their spiritual fluctuations tested. They were confirming whether the participants met the standards of soul cultivators to enter the Pageant.

When it was Long Chen’s turn, the female disciple who received his identity plate only stared blankly. She looked up at him. “Sorry, you aren’t from the Southern Xuan Region...”

“What? Can’t people from other regions also attend?” asked Long Chen.

This was different from what he had expected. If people from other regions weren’t allowed to attend, then what had he rushed over here for?

“Wait, no, that Di Xin isn’t from the Southern Xuan Region either. Why can he attend?” raged Long Chen.

“Don’t panic just yet. Geniuses from other regions can attend, but in order to show consideration to the people of this region, the test standards for them are increased by a hundred times. I hope you can understand,” said the disciple politely.

“A hundred times? Alright, then test away.” Long Chen was confident he could pass.

Quite a few people were shocked that Long Chen came from a different region. There were very few disciples from other regions that had the power to attend the Jade Lake Pageant. The test was something only a few strong soul cultivators could pass, and to have its difficulty increased by a hundred times made it almost impossible.

“For natives, their soul value must reach ten thousand points to enter. As for you, you’ll need to reach one million points at least. Di Xin also had to take this test to enter, so we aren’t being biased. Of this, you can be sure,” said the disciple.

“If he can pass, then I can too. Just test me.” Long Chen shrugged.

As soon as he said this, someone laughed. “How shameless. Does he think he can compare to Di Xin? Laughable.”

“Di Xin is a peerless heavenly genius. A little puppy can’t compare to him. Little people shouldn’t say such big words,” added another.

Clearly, Di Xin’s fame was quite great, and there were quite a few supporters of his in the crowd. For Long Chen to say that he could also pass had immediately caused quite a few disdainful snorts to ring out.

Long Chen ignored them. “How do I do the test?”

“Normally, we just need to use the spirit testing stone, but it caps out at twenty thousand points. You’ll need to use the spirit testing tablet.” The disciple waved her hand, and a thirty-meter tablet appeared behind her. There was a red line carved onto it with red liquid flowing within. Along the line were several clear lines marked with numerical values written in immortal characters.

When that tablet appeared, startled cries rang out. “The very first mark is a hundred thousand, while its maximum is one million five hundred thousand! Is there really such an existence in this world?”

“Didn’t they already say that Di Xin passed?”

“Hehe, Di Xin practically isn’t human. Hopefully, this guy won’t fail to even reach the first marker, or it would be too embarrassing.”

“Is he covering his face because he’s afraid of embarrassing himself? At least he made his preparations first.”

Long Chen had a hood on, blocking the upper half of his face. As for his identity plate, only the female disciple had seen his name there. The others had no idea who he was. They thought he was wearing a cloak to act mysterious.

“Yao-er, are you sure that Long Chen’s Spiritual Strength can compare to Di Xin’s? If he embarrasses himself, it’ll be difficult to let him in,” said the Skywood Divine Palace’s master within the main palace.

“Palace master, don’t worry. I understand Long Chen’s Spiritual Strength the most. Di Xin had a soul value of 1,200,000. Long Chen will definitely score higher,” said Meng Qi confidently.

Meng Qi, Chu Yao, and Tang Wan-er had great confidence in Long Chen. They knew just how monstrous his Spiritual Strength was.

“To start the test, place your hand on the spirit testing spot. You can unleash your Spiritual Strength there,” said the disciple.

Long Chen nodded and placed his hand on a red-colored square sensor stone. The countless mocking voices made him smile coldly. The Spiritual Strength in his mind-sea surged out.
