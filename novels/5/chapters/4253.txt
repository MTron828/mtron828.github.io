Chapter 4242: This World Requires Reverence

Lian Wuying had personally taken action. Using absolute force, she directly exterminated one of the terrifying dark domain lords, shocking everyone.

Even more shocking than that, she gave the order for the Undying race’s experts to attack, and they flooded toward Long Chen.

Millions and millions of Undying experts poured toward Long Chen like a flood. Seeing this, Liu Ruyan’s side also shot into motion. The Undying Willow race led another faction of the Undying race’s experts, rushing toward Long Chen’s side as well.

However, curiously, Liu Ruyan didn’t directly intercept Lian Wuying’s troops. Instead, the two of them directly rushed toward Long Chen practically side by side.

“Brave warriors of the devil race, Long Chen has our blood on his hands! He is the mortal enemy of the devil race! Anyone who kills him will be a true warrior of the devil race!”

Following that, the devil race’s army also began to move. Although they had repeatedly taken heavy losses on the martial stage, they were still numerous.

“Warriors of the Blood race, the time to avenge our race’s people has come! Slaughter them!” The Blood race’s experts also made their move.

“Long Chen is brothers with Wu Tian! Anyone who cuts off his head will be favored by the Nether Emperor! It’s just up to who has that ability!” A furious roar came from the Netherworld’s experts.

“Shadow race’s warriors, the target is right there. Long Chen’s head is mine. As for the heads of the others, take them as you please.” The Shadow race’s princess led hundreds of thousands of experts from the Shadow race to suddenly vanish into mid-air.

“Long Chen’s life belongs to the demonic beast race! We won’t let other races take it first! The time for my demonic beast race to rise has come! Warriors, it’s time to show this world the new demonic beast race!”

A roar came from the demonic beast race, but in truth, countless demonic beast experts had been rushing toward Long Chen before this person shouted.

Enemies flooded Long Chen’s camp from all sides, immediately singling him out as their primary target. This sudden shift in the situation left the majority of observers utterly stunned.

“What is going on? Why are they targeting Long Chen all at once?!” demanded Bai Zhantang.

“Because Long Chen has the ability to destroy those pillars of light. Thus, they have to eliminate him as quickly as possible,” said the palace master.

“Could they all be…?!” Bai Zhantang was shocked. It seemed that all these people were acting under the banner of avenging enmity while concealing their true intentions.

“They’re in danger!” Bai Shishi’s mother clenched her fists, her palms sweaty. Long Chen’s scant group was now the target of practically all the races’ powerful experts.

“Hahaha!” However, upon seeing all these enemies charging toward him, Long Chen actually raised his head and laughed. “A pack of fools. Even when you’re being used, you don’t realize it. There’s no need for more words. Let us speak with our weapons!”

Long Chen turned toward the Dragonblood warriors. Seeing the familiar faces, Long Chen was filled with intense emotion.

“Brothers, in the Martial Heaven Continent, we ended up together because of battle, and now we are reunited in battle once more. We live for battle, to cut down all the injustices beneath the heavens. Others view us as pawns, ants, and fools, but we know that while a person’s life might be as weak as a piece of paper, a person should live like an unyielding stone. We have fathers, mothers, and brothers, and in their eyes, we are not ants. We are the sun and moon, the pride of their lives. Without us, their world would become dark. Thus, we cherish our lives more than anyone. It is precisely because of this that we cultivate with our lives on the line, that we fight with our lives on the line. Only then can we live with dignity. Brothers, open your throats and roar! Take out your weapons and kill! On the battlefield, there is no right and wrong, only victory and defeat, life and death! Anyone who wants to take our lives is an enemy, and there is only one thing to do to our enemies! Kill!”

Long Chen’s voice gradually intensified as he spoke until it was like rolling thunder splitting apart the heavens.

His final word in particular caused the entire world to dim and a haze of blood to appear in the air. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

The next moment, the entire world turned scarlet, both inside and outside the martial stage. It was like a bloody air was growing, as if foretelling something.

“Kill!”

“Kill!”

“Kill!”

The Dragonblood warriors drew their weapons and roared, forming a resonance with Long Chen’s command. In that moment, the Dragonblood warriors’ souls seemed to have become closely connected.

“Kill!”

“Kill!”

“Kill!”

There were also the disciples of the Starry River Sect, the High Firmament Academy, the Battle God Palace, and the other heavenly geniuses who had come to assist Long Chen.

This speech set their blood ablaze. As of now, there was no longer any fear in their hearts, only an overflowing will to fight.

As death was no longer able to make them afraid, with their blood blazing, only by killing their enemies could they unleash their emotions.

Just as Long Chen finished raising their morale, a sword slashed down like a meteorite at him, its power shaking the martial stage.

It was Ye Wuchen. This time, Ye Wuchen’s manifestation was present, and his Blood Qi was blazing. With the three-colored divine radiance flowing around him, his aura was dozens of times stronger.

Ye Wuchen no longer wanted to conceal his power. In his full-power state, he prepared to kill Long Chen in an instant.

On the other side, the fabric of space twisted and turned. That ephemeral Ghost Dao lifeform appeared once more, his manifestation flowing, resembling a giant skeletal structure. Sinister Ghost Qi swirled around it, accompanied by the anguished cries of countless ghosts.

As his aura erupted like a volcanic eruption, he let out a claw that caused his manifestation to tremble. Following that, a white bone claw also reached out of his manifestation.

The two claws seamlessly fused together, giving rise to thousands of claw-like images that materialized in the air.

“Ten Thousand Claws Return to One!”

Suddenly, the Ghost Dao lifeform shouted, and those thousands of claw-images merged into one, a single normal-sized white bone claw.

After shrinking, this claw didn’t make any sound. It was deathly silent, like the silence before death.

Long Chen slowly turned his head to them. As if he didn’t even see both of their terrifying attacks, he coldly said, “This world requires reverence, for it is only through reverence of power that people can learn to cultivate a respectful heart. Dragon King Battle Armor!”

BOOM!

When Long Chen’s seven-colored divine ring appeared, it was accompanied by a majestic dragon cry. With his body covered in 108,000 dragon scales, he was like a blazing golden sun illuminating the world.
