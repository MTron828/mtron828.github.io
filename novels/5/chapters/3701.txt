Chapter 3690 The Human Race’s Most Flourishing Era

The Violet Flame Heaven Capital was one of the oldest cities within the Violet Flame Heaven. It was said that this city was actually a pile of ruins, ruins so big that they were unimaginable.

It was located at the heart of the Violet Flame Heaven. But contrary to the Darklight Heaven, the Violet Flame Heaven was split into blocks, as there were many areas that could not be crossed. In fact, for some areas, you had no choice but to traverse through a different heaven, or go through somewhere like the Netherworld or devil world to reach them.

Thus, there was no one capable of traversing the entire Violet Flame Heaven. After all, some sealed areas were hiding an unknown number of monsters. Those monsters would normally not appear, but once they did, they would cause huge waves in the world.

When Guo Ran’s flying boat approached the Violet Flame Heaven Capital, all he saw were ruins. A solemn and stirring aura assaulted them.

Also, Long Chen’s blood began to unconsciously circulate faster, and his hands quivered slightly. Long Chen was startled, not knowing what was going on.

“There really is battle-hungry blood in your body. The call from millions and millions of years ago is forming a resonance with your blood,” said Xia Guhong with a touch of praise.

“Big brother, are you saying…!” Long Chen was shocked.

Xia Guhong nodded. “Yes. This place was the core of the battlefield in the desolate battle. The number of lifeforms that died in that battle is uncountable, and every inch of this land is dyed with their blood. Because of it, every wisp of air is infected with endless resentment. Ancient desolate devils are buried within this place along with the heroes that slew them. But then, the stars changed, and the Heavenly Daos erased countless marks of that battle, as if that battle’s only mark would eventually be carved in a history book. As time passes, people’s memories of that time also grow dim. Perhaps they are unwilling to look back, or they simply don’t dare to. Or perhaps… they feel like history won’t repeat, so they choose to forget.”

Xia Guhong eyed this ruined world and sighed. This one sigh contained many complicated emotions.

Long Chen knew that Xia Guhong had experienced far more than him. He stood at an unfathomable height, so the world he saw made him sigh with emotion. As for Long Chen, all he felt was overflowing battle intent.Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

He could sense fear, anger, unwillingness, reluctance, and other emotions in the air. They were the leftover wills from the human experts right before their deaths. They remained even after the erosion of time for millions and millions of years. 

It wasn’t just Long Chen who could feel them. Guo Ran and Xia Chen were also affected by the air here. Their gazes grew sharp, and killing intent welled out of them.

They had followed Long Chen for so many years in bloody battles, so they were extremely sensitive to this kind of aura. At this moment, they felt like they could see countless humans in a blood-soaked battle, slaughtering devils and monsters. Because of this, they had the desire to go back through the river of time and join the battle.

As the flying boat slowly got closer, they saw an astonishing sight. In the distance, there was a giant black hole in the void. It was like a gaping maw devouring the world.

The black hole was surrounded by spatial cracks, which were constantly reforming and healing. It was vaguely possible to see some terrifying spatial blades whirling within, and terrifying sounds came from the darkness. They were like divine beasts roaring yet also like ghosts wailing.

“The battle of the desolate era was millions and millions of years ago. Has the world not healed from it?” asked Guo Ran, his voice quivering as he looked at the black hole.

With their current cultivation base, if they unleashed their full power, they could break through the walls of space. But whatever damage they did would quickly heal.

Like slashing a blade in the water, the surface of the water might be broken for a while, but it would eventually return to its original appearance over time.

However, the scars from the desolate era still remained until now. Just how terrifying was the person who caused this scar?

“The desolate era is said to be the human race’s strongest era. The human race’s experts of that time could shatter the stars and the moon and destroy the foundation of the world. We aren’t capable of even influencing their remnants.” Xia Guhong looked at the black hole with many emotions.

“I’ve never heard of that. Shouldn’t the wheel of history continue to move forward? The human race went through millions and millions of years of development, making all sorts of new inventions, standing on the shoulders of those who came before us. The human race is blooming with talent. We should be greater than before!” exclaimed Guo Ran.

Ancient humans might be powerful, but according to reason, through the efforts of countless generations, the human race should have surpassed them by now.

After all, the human race wasn’t like demonic beasts who only relied on bloodline inheritances. The human race had both bloodline inheritances and the inheritance of history. Because of them, the human race’s techniques could be passed down through written word.

With numbers, they could build an unprecedented roaring fire. As everyone had worked hard to progress, the current human race had given rise to countless new paths. But Xia Guhong said that the human race had declined compared to back then? They found it hard to accept.

Xia Guhong shook his head. “In the desolate era, the human race could barely survive by hiding between the cracks. It was an extremely difficult time for us. But then the human race produced an almighty expert who created their own peerless divine cultivation technique, leading the human race to the very peak. We slew demons, devils, ghosts, and monsters, and for the first time, the human race stood at the pinnacle of the ten thousand races. Long Chen, you often say that humans are the spirit of the ten thousand races, blessed with the special care of the Heavenly Daos. But the truth is, before that person appeared, the human race was not the spirit of anything, nor were they cared for by the Heavenly Daos. The human race was only the slaves of the various races. But that almighty expert forcibly slaughtered our enslavers until their blood rained down from the heavens. Eventually, the nine heavens lowered their heads, and the Heavenly Daos gave us their favor, accepting the human race as supreme. It was only after this moment that the human race truly rose, having the blessing of the Heavenly Daos. We then truly started to comprehend the Heavenly Daos that enabled us to create our own cultivation techniques and abilities. Guo Ran, I know that you have immense talent in forging, but don’t get complacent. In that era, the human race was the chosen ones of the heavens. Their minds were blessed with divine light, and the ten thousand Daos and laws were open to them. Their comprehension was far greater than the current human race.”

Hearing the way that Xia Guhong described it, that the ten thousand Daos and laws were open to them, that their minds were blessed with divine light, Long Chen, Guo Ran, and Xia Chen were shaken. This state, was it not precisely the state of being blessed by the Seven Treasure Colored Glass Tree?

Guo Ran fell silent. Under the light of the Seven Treasure Colored Glass Tree, his mind was like a gushing spring, and endless ideas just came flying out. It was like no problem was too difficult for him.

If the people of that era really did have such a constant blessing, then they truly weren’t something that the current people could reach.

Guo Ran and Xia Chen had made astonishing gains just from short moments of the Seven Treasure Colored Glass Tree’s blessing. Because of this, they were unable to imagine the wisdom of the people of that era.

“Big brother, who was the almighty expert that you mentioned?” asked Long Chen.

Xia Guhong simply smiled at Long Chen and didn’t respond. But that smile already told Long Chen the answer.

Long Chen’s heart pounded wildly. As expected, that person had to be the Nine Star Master, the man who caused the nine heavens to lower their heads.

“Then wouldn’t the Nine Star Hegemon Body Art be created before the Heavenly Daos recognized the human race?” Thinking of this, Long Chen was even more shocked. The Nine Star Master had essentially blazed an entirely unprecedented path. But by changing the Nine Star Hegemon Body Art’s cultivation path, was he not also blazing his own path?

BOOM!

Suddenly, a heaven-shaking explosion erupted in the distance. Violent auras struck them.

“People are fighting! Let’s take a look!”

Guo Ran cried out excitedly and sent the flying boat hurtling over.
