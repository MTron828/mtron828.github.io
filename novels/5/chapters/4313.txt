Chapter 4302 Brazen Idea

The force of the impact sent the battle-ax flying. As for Long Chen’s finger bone, there was only the slightest white mark on it, and that mark vanished instantaneously as if nothing had happened.

Long Chen’s wound quickly healed. Even the seven-color blood that had flowed out ended up flowing back in.

“This is incredible!” Long Chen exclaimed, overwhelmed with shock and delight. He could hardly believe it. His bones were on par with an Eternal divine weapon!

“Your bones have been strengthened by the Supreme Bone, and those chaotic lines are actually a kind of formation. However, this formation is so complicated that no one can possibly understand it. When the battle-ax struck your fingerbone, your Supreme Bone lit up, and I sensed an energy flowing from it to your fingerbone. It was too fast for me to sense its path clearly, but I guarantee that the force you’ve seen so far is just a fraction of what the Supreme Bone can achieve,” said the dragon expert.

Even an existence as powerful as the dragon expert was unable to see through the full power of the Supreme Bone, so Long Chen’s understanding of it was barely scratching the surface.

“Hehe, I really am a genius. Now that I have my Supreme Bone back, I can block Eternal divine weapons with my barehand. That’ll scare the experts from that world!” Long Chen grew excited at the thought.

With the return of his Supreme Bone, Long Chen felt an unprecedented surge of strength welling up from within. Although he didn’t know how to properly use his Supreme Bone yet, its passive defense was enough to make him unafraid of any potential injuries.

With bones as hard as Eternal divine weapons and the boundless life energy in the primal chaos space to sustain him, Long Chen essentially had an undying body.

If he had possessed such power during the Sage King Convention, he could have swept through all his enemies without anyone’s help. Even if he couldn’t beat them, he could exhaust them to death.

“Don’t be too pleased. The Supreme Bone has only just been activated, and you don’t even know how to use it properly. Blood Condensation and Bone Forging are now complete, and I aided you in finishing Tendon Transformation. All that remains are Meridian Opening and Qi Condensation.”

“Alright. Then I’ll do Qi Condensation first.”

“Go ahead.”

Long Chen nodded and concentrated. Within his Dantian was a clump of qi. That was his Spirit Root.

The Spirit Root was like a flame sprout emitting strange fluctuations. Long Chen felt like its breathing was in sync with heaven and earth’s breath, as though it was on the same wavelength as the world.

However, Long Chen didn’t understand the significance behind this wavelength. In most people, the Spirit Root would be situated in the dantian, serving as their core, the main thing that determined a person’s talent.

Long Chen had asked Meng Qi, Chu Yao, and the others about their Spirit Roots, but they couldn't provide a clear explanation. They simply mentioned that their Spirit Roots would exhibit unusual fluctuations during breakthroughs in realms or when they had significant insights into the Heavenly Daos. However, they couldn't elaborate on the specific functions or significance of their Spirit Roots.

The Spirit Root was extremely mysterious. It seemed to serve as the link that tied them to the entire world, and it could also be considered the foundation of a person’s intelligence. It was what decided a cultivator’s future.

As for how to use a Spirit Root, even after flipping through countless ancient tomes, Long Chen was unable to find a precise answer. His understanding of the Spirit Root remained quite obscure.

Even ancient sages with their own comprehension of the world were unable to give a precise definition of a Spirit Root.

Since Long Chen didn’t have a proper Dantian, this clump of qi simply hovered above his Dantian area, with the starry sea beneath it.

Buzz.

With a thought, Long Chen guided the clump of qi into the starry sea. He then clenched his teeth and started to form hand seals.

The next moment, the 108,000 stars rumbled and shook, and each star unleashed a ray of divine light at the clump of qi. In return, the clump of qi quivered and suddenly inflated, emitting a blazing divine light that shot into all 108,000 stars. It was like a sea flowing into thousands of rivers. Long Chen’s stars suddenly ignited, their auras growing explosively.

However, cracks started to appear on the stars, and Long Chen and the dragon expert cried out in horror.

“Not good!”

“Stop!” shouted the dragon expert.

“I can’t!” Long Chen was already trying, but he couldn’t control this qi.

“The stars are going to explode!” Long Chen shouted. If his 108,000 stars exploded all at once, then he would definitely be blasted out of existence.

Just as Long Chen thought that he was about to die, a strange light enveloped him.

“The Sage King divine radiance?”

Long Chen was delighted. The Sage King divine radiance appeared and started to nourish the stars with its energy, causing them to gradually settle down.

Following that, a flame seedling appeared on top of every star, and both Long Chen and the dragon expert cheered in relief.

“Success!”Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

Long Chen’s Spirit Root had merged into the starry sea. This had been an absolutely crazy idea, and both of them knew just how difficult and dangerous such a thing was.

Unexpectedly, they had succeeded with the help of the Sage King divine radiance. Long Chen's Spirit Root was now firmly rooted in the 108,000 stars, which meant he would have 108,000 Spirit Roots in the future.

Although splitting it into so many pieces had made each of them extremely weak, so weak that their existence was about to fade away, Long Chen knew that if he nourished them, he would be a hundred thousand times stronger than an ordinary expert.

Now that Long Chen had succeeded with Qi Condensation, the two of them were incredibly excited. This was Long Chen’s first time feeling lucky.

Looking at the flame seedling of his Spirit Root on every star, Long Chen was full of anticipation for the future.

“Next is Meridian Opening. Take advantage of this luck to finish it all at once,” advised the dragon expert.

Long Chen nodded and formed hand seals. In an instant, his violet blood flowed through all his meridians.

To Long Chen’s surprise, his violet blood and his meridians harmonized perfectly, with no signs of rejection at all. His meridians absorbed his violet blood rapidly, causing one rune after another to condense in his meridians, significantly strengthening them.

Long Chen’s meridians didn’t get any wider, but their toughness was crazily rising. Previously, his meridians could be likened to straw, but now they had transformed into something akin to immortal metal. The difference was tremendous.

“Hahaha, that was so easy! I’m really lucky, hahaha! With meridians this powerful, I won’t have to worry about any backlash no matter how powerful the technique is!” Long Chen laughed with excitement, having successfully completed his Meridian Opening.

Before this, whenever he wanted to use a big move, he had to first consider the impact on his meridians. A single mistake could injure his meridians even before unleashing the technique, which could easily be fatal.

However, with his newly strengthened violet blood meridians, Long Chen was confident that even if he channeled all of his power into a single technique, his meridians could effortlessly withstand it. This realization filled him with exhilaration, and he couldn't help but shout in excitement.

“Excellent. Now, I have another brazen idea. What do you think? Do you want to try it?” The dragon expert laughed mischievously.
