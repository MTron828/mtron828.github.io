Chapter 3736 Rush of Excitement

“Shameless bastard, inferior lifeform, my Ice Soul never submits to anyone! Do you think that tormenting me like this will make me obedient? Even if I die, my unyielding will will be inherited. You might imprison my body in this world, but you can't trap my will. Once I die here, the circulation of the Heavenly Daos will cause the new Ice Soul to possess an unyielding will. It definitely won’t land in your hands.”

The woman glared at Long Chen. Her gemstone-like eyes contained immense haughtiness and iciness.

She was a peerless beauty wearing snow-white robes. Even trapped in this cage, her peerless air was not covered up. She was like a caged empress. Even in this situation, she possessed an air of arrogance that looked down on the rest of the world, one that would never submit.Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

“Idiot, open your eyes! I came to save you!” cursed Long Chen. This Ice Soul was not at all like the Heavenly Rainbow Fairy. The Heavenly Rainbow Fairy was kind and gentle, but this Ice Soul was completely unreasonable. She had almost taken his life just now.

“Do you think that mixing in with the crowd with a trace of Ice Soul’s energy will win my trust? Fool, you’ve tried this move on me countless times already. I won’t fall for it. Since you sent yourself to me, I’ll take that Ice Soul energy and slaughter everyone here!” The white-robed woman’s eyes were full of killing intent. She suddenly began forming hand seals.

Buzz.

Huo Linger cried out. She was originally inside Long Chen, but a terrifying power pulled her off of him at this moment.

“Are you crazy?!” Long Chen was enraged. He hadn’t expected the Ice Soul to be so unreasonable. He grabbed Huo Linger.

Suddenly, the world quivered and the eight chains clanked. Divine light exploded out of them, suppressing the woman’s power.

Despite that, Huo Linger was already pulled over by an invisible power. Long Chen pulled but suddenly found that he was unable to keep hold of her. Huo Linger screamed. She did not possess the slightest ability to retaliate in front of the Ice Soul.

“Who would have thought? You also have a trace of Yan Xu’s power. Excellent. I’ll use your power to slaughter all your companions.” The white-robed woman was a bit surprised.

“If you dare to harm her, I will kill you!”

Long Chen’s fury exploded. But even as his killing intent exploded, Huo Linger was a spiritual body caught by that woman. He was unable to attack and could only watch as Huo Linger was pulled into the cage.

Long Chen currently only had one functioning eye. But at this moment, it instantly turned black, and a terrifying dark energy gushed out. Just as Long Chen was about to use the Purgatory Eyes, the white-robed woman stopped her actions.

At some point, a lotus appeared on Huo Linger’s forehead. It was a golden lotus. The moment it appeared, the white-robed woman’s killing intent instantly vanished. She stared blankly at the golden lotus.

Suddenly, she let go. Huo Linger regained her freedom and instantly shot back into the primal chaos space, not daring to come back out.

“So you really did come to save me,” the white-robed woman murmured to Long Chen.

“Fuck that! I’m not saving you anymore! Your death no longer has anything to do with me!” Long Chen cursed furiously. This woman actually dared to think of devouring Huo Linger? That was touching his reverse scale. He was barely stopping himself from using the Purgatory Eyes.

The woman looked at the enraged Long Chen. Her mouth moved as if she was trying to say an apology, but she didn’t actually say anything.

Long Chen checked on Huo Linger. He found that although she was traumatized, she wasn’t injured. Long Chen then snorted and turned to leave.

“You can’t leave. This grand formation is under their control. With your low cultivation base, you will be sending yourself to death like this. I was rash just now. In order to make it up to you, I will give you my last bit of power,” said the white-robed woman.

“No need. I can get out without you,” snorted Long Chen.

A black dagger then appeared in his hand. He had already checked the formation. It wasn’t made of faith energy, so the black dagger could break it.

If not, he would use the Purgatory Eyes. Worst-case, he would just be blind for a few days but still have his spiritual perception. As long as he didn’t fight, it wasn’t a big problem. In any case, he didn’t want to talk with this woman.

“You should let me send you out,” said the woman.

“Send me out? I’m the one sending you out. If I can’t obtain you, no one can!” declared Long Chen angrily.

The white-robed woman looked at Long Chen. “These chains and this cage are made from Heavenly Flame Essence Gold, and there are first generation Jiuli runes carved into them. They cannot be broken…”

Before she was even done speaking, Long Chen’s black dagger struck the chains. As a result, sparks flew and the chains snapped.

However, this time, they weren’t sliced through as easily as tofu. Although the chains were broken, they shook Long Chen’s arm, causing his hand to bleed.

“The Great Desolate-!”

The white-robed woman’s pupils shrank. She cried out but suddenly thought of something and clamped her mouth with her hands.

BOOM!

Suddenly, the void exploded. She put aside her shock, and with a cold snort, waved her hand.

The next moment, the cage binding her exploded. Long Chen then severed the other side of the chains, taking them along with the fragments of the cage. He knew that these things were definitely treasures. He would bring them back for Xia Chen and Guo Ran to research.

Just then, the barrier above his head rumbled. Hundreds of thousands of experts from the Sacred Pill Hall appeared above him. Every single one of them was forming hand seals and stood on top of the barrier, looking down on Long Chen.

Even those three Divine Venerates had taken action. A formation disc appeared in each of their hands, erupting terrifying divine might. Long Chen felt like an entire cosmos was crushing him from above.

All of them had terrified expressions. They were igniting their essence blood to support the grand formation.

At this moment, the glacier beneath Long Chen’s feet rumbled. Long Chen felt like all his bones would be crushed. As for those disciples of the Sacred Pill Hall, before they even knew what was happening, they were sent flying by a terrifying force.

Long Chen snorted and was about to charge out. He knew that as long as he left the peak, the pressure would lessen. He could break free from the weakest spot.

But suddenly, his arm tightened. The white-robed woman had grabbed him.

“Lend me your flame energy!”

“No!” Long Chen responded angrily.

The white-robed woman said, “Lend me power! Let me vent my wrath! I’m willing to share all my energy with that young lady!”

Hearing that, Long Chen felt a rush of excitement.
