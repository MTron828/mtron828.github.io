Chapter 2721 Wall of Ascension

After two months, Long Chen had refined hundreds of giant pills, and the ordinary pills he had refined numbered in the hundreds of thousands.

Meng Qi, Chu Yao, Tang Wan-er, and the others had poured their Spiritual Strength into Ling-er in order to help him refine pills. During this period, they had not cultivated at all.

The pills that they had previously refined had essentially been used up by the Dragonblood Legion and the Mo family’s disciples. If they didn’t send more, the others would have to stop absorbing medicinal pills.

However, with Long Chen gone, they didn’t need to refine so crazily. One furnace of pills would be enough for the Dragonblood Legion to absorb for a day.

Other than refining pills, they also started focusing on their own cultivation. Tang Wan-er in particular hadn’t even had time to refine the divine bone.

As Meng Qi and the others started focusing on their cultivation while still refining some pills, Long Chen entered the Yin Yang World along with the Dragonblood Legion. However, he was disguised and snuck in.

The giant egg in that canyon had vanished. Long Chen then killed one of the Blood race’s chiefs and gathered one of his memories from a soulsearch.

It was a memory of a giant egg on an altar. That was the egg that Little Snow was in. Countless experts of the Blood race were surrounding it, seemingly nourishing it with their bloodline power.

This was the only useful image he saw, but it was enough. He was sure that Little Snow was fine. Those experts were all kneeling toward the egg with no malice.

After that, he retreated out of the Yin Yang World and discussed things with Mo Nian and the others. They concluded that they would continue as they were.

In any case, they had an unending stream of medicinal pills. They could use those to cultivate while they delayed their enemies from cultivating.

Time was extremely important to the Martial Heaven Continent. They had to hinder the Alldevil Heavenwalker, the Blood Fiend Devil Lord, Ye Ming, the Nine-Headed Lion, and the others from becoming Sovereigns. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

Mo Nian told Long Chen not to worry about them. They had four supreme divine items, so there was no danger to them, nor were they being reckless.

They used medicinal pills to cultivate, and then when the time was right, they would take a stroll throughout the other worlds. Their enemies seemed to have admitted defeat.

As long as Mo Nian and the others didn’t charge into the depths, the invaders simply allowed them to disturb the laws of the world. They no longer bothered facing them directly. Instead, they simply accepted that everyone’s cultivation speed would be slowed. In the end, they still had an absolute advantage, so there was no need to bother with Mo Nian and the others.

When Long Chen asked about Yun Tian, he found that no one knew where he was. It was as if he had vanished.

On the other hand, Hu Feng had told them that he was in seclusion. His Gambling Heavenly Dao inheritance was different from other inheritances, and he needed to enter peaceful seclusion. When the final battle came, he would come out.

Yun Tian was gone without a trace. It was unknown if he was in seclusion or doing something else.

After learning this, Long Chen said a few words to Mo Nian and then left to see the High Priest in the Wine God Palace.

The High Priest was still the same tranquil, composed elder as before. It seemed the prospect of impending doom didn’t bother him.

“The High Priest is quite refined,” praised Long Chen.

“Refined? No.” The High Priest shook his head. “This is intoxication, an intoxication that cannot be extricated from. Come, sit.”

Long Chen slowly sat before the High Priest. The High Priest took out a small jug of wine and poured a cup for Long Chen, pushing it toward him.

“Your cultivation base hasn’t changed at all. It seems that you’ve been busy,” said the High Priest.

Long Chen took a sip of the wine and instantly felt a wave of relaxation go through his body. Heavenly Dao energy blossomed within his chest. It was as if this one sip of wine contained all of heaven and earth, giving endless enlightenment.

After exclaiming in admiration over the wine, Long Chen said, “Yes, disciple has been busy refining pills. However, honing a blade is not a waste of time. I’ve come to ask senior some questions. Do you know any secrets regarding the Eastern Wasteland Bell? I am currently searching for it, but I have no leads.”

Long Chen was a bit vexed. He had taken out the fragment of the Eastern Wasteland Bell to see if he could use it, but he was unable to cause any reaction to come out of it.

He had even asked the Central Plains Cauldron and the Western Desert Ax, but neither of them had any methods. They were also unable to sense the Eastern Wasteland Bell.

Long Chen had a kind of bad feeling when it came to the Heaven Devastating Bracelet below the Martial Heaven Sea-Ring. Although the sea demon race had mostly been wiped out, the Heaven Devastating Bracelet remained a tumor on the continent.

The Central Plains Cauldron had told him that the Heaven Devastating Bracelet was also recovering. Even if the four supreme divine items joined forces, they might not be able to destroy the Heaven Devastating Bracelet. Furthermore, even if they could, they themselves would be too badly damaged to help with the rest of the dark era.

Without them, the Martial Heaven Continent would have no divine items to stop their enemies’ world divine items. With no other options, Long Chen came to the High Priest.

The High Priest sipped his wine. After that, he slowly put down the cup and looked at Long Chen. “I don’t know that much about the Martial Heaven Continent, especially the five supreme divine items. The reason I fully support you is because the Wine God sent down an edict ordering the Wine God Palace to do everything to help you.”

“Then does that mean that the Wine God can help us?” asked Long Chen.

“You still don’t understand. The gods are not on the same spatial plane as us. They are on a higher plane, unable to descend to our world. This world can only be ascended from but not descended to. Just sending down a simple edict requires paying a huge price, as the wall of ascension blocks all things coming from a higher plane. If a god wished to descend to the mortal world, it would either destroy the mortal world, or the god would be suppressed by the wall of ascension. As the core of a star-field, it is even more difficult for a god to send an edict here. The chances of success definitely do not exceed ten percent.”

“The wall of ascension? It will even suppress gods? How is that possible?” asked Long Chen.

“The wall of ascension can be passed through from our side, but then there is no coming back. The gods might send down hundreds or thousands of messages, but only one or two will pass through the wall of ascension. Those messages are all extremely weak and can only be received by their divine statues. We can receive those messages, but we don’t have the means to transmit information back to the gods. Of course, there are differences among gods. Some are stronger and some are weaker. Perhaps the stronger gods can do so. For example, Pill Valley’s Lord Brahma and Fallen Daynight. That is why you must be careful of Pill Valley’s Yu Qingxuan. Perhaps she has the ability to call a god to possess her body.” The High Priest’s expression suddenly became serious. Even he felt a sense of danger when it came to Yu Qingxuan.
