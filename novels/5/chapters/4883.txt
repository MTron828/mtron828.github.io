Chapter 4872 Devil Fall City's Revolution

At this moment, the four noble families openly went against Xing Wujiang, their leaders surrounding him with raging killing intent. The entire Devil Fall City trembled from their power.

“Heavens, Devil Fall City is going through a revolution!”

The Violet Palace Sect’s Gao Jianli pointed his sword at Xing Wujiang, shouting coldly, “Xing Wujiang, as the city lord, you have constantly broken Devil Fall City’s laws. Today, you must abdicate no matter what!”

“Peh, after losing the last half of your face, your courage has certainly grown. If the four of you don’t want to submit, then go ahead and attack,” Xing Wujiang retorted with a hint of disdain.

Even though Xing Wujiang was alone, he exuded powerful pressure on his enemies. He hadn’t even drawn his weapon, simply standing there. It was clear he didn’t regard the four of them as threats.

Suddenly, Gao Jianli waved his hand, and a golden seal flew into the sky. At this moment, Cao Guofeng, the Heaven Heart Hall’s master, and the Yellow Spring Pavilion’s master also summoned their golden seals.

These four seals came from the east, south, west, and north, floating in the sky above Devil Fall City. When the four of them lit up, the entire Devil Fall City trembled once again.

After that, the gates of the city slammed shut, and a screen of light enveloped Devil Fall City, locking down this giant marketplace. Seeing this scene, countless people panicked.

“Xing Wujiang, do you see? Even without your master seal, we can still control Devil Fall City. Your position as city lord has long since become an empty title!” shouted Cao Guofeng.

Usually, locking down Devil Fall City required the consent of the four golden seals and the master seal. In special circumstances, just three seals would be enough, but amongst them had to be the master seal.

However, today, they managed to do it without Xing Wujiang’s consent. This one point proved that the master seal’s power had diminished. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

“Xing Wujiang, hand over the violet-gold master seal. Due to our many years of friendship, we will spare your life!” declared Gao Jianli.

Millions of experts within Devil Fall City quivered with fright, unable to escape. They could only watch the battle for the city lord position unfold. What they feared most was Xing Wujiang being pushed to the brink of madness. He might drag everyone in Devil Fall City to accompany him in death.

However, Xing Wujiang remained calm and smiled lightly as if everything was under his control. Their provocation actually made him feel a sense of pity.

“What are you smiling about?!” shouted the Heaven Heart Hall’s master.

“He’s smiling about how you look like ghosts but still covet the position of city lord!” countered Mo Nian from below.

Mo Nian’s mouth was indeed vicious. He knew it was taboo to mention the looks of the Heaven Heart Hall’s master. Otherwise, she wouldn’t have been so jealous of Race Leader Yu Luo back then.

Hearing Mo Nian’s taunt, the Heaven Heart Hall’s master trembled with rage, her face twisting into an ugly expression. She shouted, “You idiots of the Flame Divine Hall, how long are you going to wait?!”

“You’re the idiot! Your whole family are idiots, you ugly, dead, old bitch!” When this furious roar rang out, a group of figures appeared. They were Jiang Yiban and the others from the Flame Divine Hall, and they looked enraged.

Their goal was to kill Long Chen, so they had avoided the detection of the main seal and stayed hidden in Devil Fall City.

Their plan had been going well. After Cao Yuyang lured Long Chen out, Jiang Yiban and the others would capture him. If Xing Wujiang tried to interfere, the four of them would stop him.

Jiang Yiban feared Xing Wujiang partly because of the latter’s power, so he preferred not to confront Xing Wujiang directly. However, the most dangerous aspect was that Xing Wujiang could harness the power of the Square Heaven Seal. If he were to use that trump card, Jiang Yiban would have no chance of winning.

Now that things had developed to this point, they didn’t know if it was due to Long Chen’s lucky break or Cao Yuyang’s misfortune. At first, they had been in the middle of a strategy meeting, with Cao Yuyang present. However, while they were ironing out the finer details, Cao Yuyang left, and the news that Long Chen and Mo Nian had come out reached his ears.

Cao Yuyang immediately acted according to the plan. However, Long Chen and Mo Nian easily dealt with him. He didn’t even have a chance to display his strength before he kicked the bucket.

Perhaps Cao Yuyang was still crying on his way to the yellow springs. According to the plan, the moment Long Chen made a ruckus, the real experts would capture him. If Long Chen dared to attack, the four noble families’ experts would have an excuse to capture him, which would definitely disturb Xing Wujiang. Once Xing Wujiang emerged, the four heads would seal him, and they could capture the big fish and the small fish at the same time.

However, Cao Yuyang wasn’t aware that his father and the other heads were in the midst of discussing the finer details. They wanted to make sure that their plan went perfectly.

Hence, when the bait known as Cao Yuyang was destroyed, Cao Guofeng practically went crazy and immediately rushed over.

At that moment, the four family heads and Xing Wujiang had torn off all pretenses. According to the plan, the Flame Divine Hall’s people were supposed to take action, but they refused, which enraged the four family heads.

After all, as long as Jiang Yiban and the others attacked to capture Long Chen, Xing Wujiang would be forced to save him. This would then create an opening to attack Xing Wujiang, giving them an upper hand.

The four of them were waiting for the right time to catch Xing Wujiang off guard. Although it was a four-against-one, they didn’t dare to rashly take action as they knew how strong Xing Wujiang was. Hence, when the Flame Divine Hall’s experts refused to attack and Xing Wujiang acted like everything was under control, they felt very nervous.

In the end, the Heaven Heart Hall’s master snapped when Mo Nian cursed her. Due to her intense anxiety, she directly cursed the Flame Divine Hall’s people, forcing Jiang Yiban and the others to reveal themselves.

“Attack!” shouted Jiang Yiban as he waved his hand, sealing the space around Long Chen. Four Heaven Saints from the Flame Divine Hall then summoned their flame chains and charged toward Long Chen and Mo Nian.

“Flame Divine Hall, have you really considered the consequences of your actions?” asked Xing Wujiang.

“You should worry about yourself. Do you not know what kind of situation you’re in? Can you afford to worry about others?” countered Jiang Yiban, shaking his head.

“Alright. Then you can’t blame me.”

When Xing Wujiang raised his hand, a violet-gold seal appeared in it. Gao Jianli and the others looked at him scornfully, thinking that his violet-gold seal was already obsolete, unable to control the Square Heaven Seal. But then...

BOOM!

All the old fogeys were shocked to see countless runes surge out of the ground, forming a giant wave that condensed into a pillar of light shooting toward those four Heaven Venerates of the Flame Divine Hall.

“Shit!”

Jiang Yiban’s expression completely changed, and Gao Jianli and the others’ scornful expressions vanished without a trace, replaced by dumbfounded horror.
