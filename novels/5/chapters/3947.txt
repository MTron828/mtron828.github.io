Chapter 3936 Blood Flame Sorghum

Long Chen then summoned Guo Ran and Xia Chen. After finding a secluded place outside the Wine God Palace, Long Chen then took out those immemorial corpses.

The Wine God Palace was a holy land, and Long Chen felt like taking out corpses there, even if it was in a seclusion cultivation room, would be a kind of blasphemy to the Wine God Palace.

After he took out the corpses, Guo Ran and Xia Chen began to record the runes on them. Those runes were almost impossible to find in the current era, so every single one of them had great research value.

The two of them spent three days copying them all down. After that, Long Chen tossed the corpses back into the primal chaos space. He kept them on the black soil, letting it slowly absorb them.

When the three of them returned to Wine God Palace, Long Chen summoned the Seven Treasure Colored Glass Tree, and the two of them began to study these runes under its light. Their minds were a hundred times clearer than normal under its influence.

As they crazily studied all the runes, they picked out the most valuable ones. Some of them came from the corpses’ bodies, but some also came from their weapons or even from the ground around the heavenly tomb.

The two of them made many tiny annotations as they worked, afraid that they would no longer understand these runes after the light of the Seven Treasure Colored Glass Tree faded.

After seven days, the seven of them had picked out hundreds of runes and studied them intensively. Although it was only a tiny portion of the hundreds of thousands of runes that they had recorded, these were the very best of them. Just understanding all these hand-picked runes would take some time.

Although they had a general understanding of them now, activating and using them would require a long period of testing and analysis.

After all, these immemorial runes could be considered divine inheritances of the immemorial era, so a single complete immemorial rune was of incalculable value. It could be said that Xia Chen and Guo Ran were profiting immensely.

Seven days later, Long Chen put away the Seven Treasure Colored Glass Tree and told them, “I’m going to the Vermilion Bird Empire. Are the two of you staying in the Wine God Palace or coming with me?”

“Boss, you’re going to propose to big sister Qingxuan, so we won’t disturb you. Xia Chen and I have discussed it. Right now, we only have a basic plan for the Dragon Mark Battle Armor and Dragon Mark Battle Swords. We need to slowly test out the details. Thus, I’m thinking of first gathering the Dragonblood warriors in the Violet Flame Heaven. Only once they actually wear it will we know how effective it is. Last time, I recorded where every single one of them was. The Violet Flame Heaven has three hundred and sixty of them, so I want to gather them first. Then we will base the Dragon Mark Battle Armor and Dragon Mark Battle Swords on their requirements. If they can use them, then the others should also have no problem with them,” said Guo Ran.

Long Chen nodded. “Then I’ll trouble you. Don’t forget to ask around if there are other Dragonblood warriors present who didn’t enter the three thousand worlds. If you can find them, gather them all.”

Only twenty-seven hundred Dragonblood warriors had gathered in the three thousand worlds, meaning there were many more who hadn’t entered. After all, there hadn’t been a single member of the healing corps present.

Without the healing warriors, the Dragonblood Legion was only a sharp blade with no flexibility, easy to shatter. It was not a state that was suitable for long-term battles.

Last time, if they had had the healing warriors present, they wouldn’t have to worry about being injured, and without those misgivings, their combat power would have been much greater.

Since Xia Chen and Guo Ran were going to search for the Dragonblood warriors scattered throughout the Violet Flame Heaven, then they might as well spend a bit more effort on searching the entire place for some other Dragonblood warriors that hadn’t been in the three thousand worlds.

“It’s no trouble for us. Boss, you’re the one in trouble,” laughed Guo Ran. He patted his chest confidently, indicating to just leave this matter to him.

“How am I in trouble?” demanded Long Chen, laughing involuntarily.

This time, he was going to openly and righteously marry Yu Qingxuan. To put it frankly, he was picking up a girl.

“Hahaha!”

Guo Ran and Xia Chen laughed. Xia Chen said, “It definitely will be trouble. The Vermilion Bird Empire’s history is immense, and their inheritance is shocking. Big sister Qingxuan is their imperial princess, so within her veins flows the noble Jiuli bloodline. Boss, if you want to pursue her, it won’t be that simple. Furthermore, you’ve offended Eunuch Wei. Even before you get to the Vermilion Bird Empire, you’ll probably have to deal with all kinds of trouble.”

“Tch, this is nothing to your boss. I don’t dare to say anything else, but your boss is very confident when it comes to picking up girls! As for that Eunuch Wei, he’s nothing more than a hopping clown. He’s not even worth mentioning.” Long Chen simply smiled, not at all worrying about Eunuch Wei.

After Meng Qi gave her nod of approval, Long Chen felt like he had received a sacred edict from the empress herself. He was now on an imperial order to pick up a girl. No one could stop him from openly pursuing Yu Qingxuan.

Xia Chen and Guo Ran were even more blunt than Long Chen. After talking, they directly left the Wine God Palace, leaving it to Long Chen to say their goodbyes to Xia Guhong.

“You wish to go to the Vermilion Bird Empire? Have you prepared a betrothal gift?” Xia Guhong looked at Long Chen oddly. He had thought that Long Chen would go to great lengths to procure a betrothal gift.

“How do I have time to get some betrothal gift? Am I not the best betrothal gift there is?” Long Chen laughed.

Xia Guhong also laughed. “Little fellow, your skin really is thick. Going empty-handed would be rude! Fortunately, I already prepared a little gift for you. Here are ten jugs of top grade blood fire sorghum wine. It is the favorite wine of the emperor of the Vermilion Bird Empire, Yu Xiaoyun. Furthermore, this wine is split into nine grades, and he only ever drank the third grade. Even then, he praised it as a divine wine. You’ve drunk the seventh grade before, and this is the ninth grade, the top grade. Senior apprentice-brother Li Shi’s special peerless divine brew started eight thousand years ago. Right now, there are only twelve jugs. Making more will require a blood fire sorghum to fully mature. That is something that can only be done ten thousand years from now. Thus, these ten jugs of blood fire sorghum wine are exceptionally valuable. I had told senior apprentice-brother Li Shi about your matter, and he didn’t hesitate to bring out these ten jugs. You have to remember this favor.”

Long Chen was extremely moved. This senior Li Shi was someone he had met before. He was a terrifying flame cultivator. Although Long Chen was unable to see through his cultivation base, and he was very humble, his wine was hot and powerful. A single gulp could make someone fall unconscious for days. When Long Chen drank his wine, he ended up unconscious for three days.VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

The Wine God Palace’s seniors all treated him very well. As a result, Long Chen respectfully received the wine and put it away solemnly.

“When the time comes, we’ll see. If his mood isn’t good, it would be a waste to give him such good wine,” said Long Chen painfully.

Xia Guhong laughed. “You’re too stingy. You want to marry his daughter, so what are a few jugs of wine in comparison? If Yu Xiaoyun knew what you were thinking, he probably wouldn’t even let you into the Vermilion Bird City.”

“Wait, you said his name… was Yu Xiaoyun?” Long Chen’s expression suddenly changed. That name gave him a slightly bad feeling.
