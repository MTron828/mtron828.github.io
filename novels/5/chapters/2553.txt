Chapter 2542 Giant Demonic Forest

BOOM!

The giant rhinoceros was sent tumbling back by Long Chen’s punch. After that, a huge wave of earth exploded, and even the other three thirteenth rank beasts were affected and staggered back.

“Damn!” Guo Ran’s jaw dropped. Those thirteenth rank beasts were incredibly powerful. Back then, they had been forced to flee miserably by them.

Yue Zifeng’s Sword Qi was only able to leave a cut on their necks and unable to cause any lethal wounds. Hence, this scene was hard to believe.

However, while the rhinoceros was sent tumbling back, fresh blood poured out of Long Chen’s arm.

“As expected, it’s still no good. This power is too violent. No matter how careful I am, it’s useless.” Long Chen looked at his bloody arm and sighed. However, he was also pleasantly surprised by how powerful the Six Star Battle Armor was, and he looked forward to when he could fully control it.

Long Chen retreated from the state of the Six Star Battle Armor. After that, he slashed Evilmoon at the rhinoceros’s neck, shouting, “Zifeng!”

Yue Zifeng instantly understood and unleashed a streak of Sword Qi.

Long Chen’s attack caused a cracking sound to ring out when it landed on the rhinoceros’s neck. Although he managed to break its bones, he was unable to sever its head.

Just at that moment, Yue Zifeng’s attack accurately landed on the wound Long Chen had made. Blood splashed and a mountain-sized head flew into the air.

“What?” Long Chen jumped, not having expected Yue Zifeng’s attack to actually kill it. He had thought that at most, Yue Zifeng might be able to cut apart its bones and not its whole head.

“It’s thanks to boss’s saber attack just now. Because of it, I managed to break through a bottleneck that has trapped me for many years,” said Yue Zifeng excitedly.

When Long Chen used the true essence of the eighth form of Split the Heavens, it gave Yue Zifeng the spark of insight he needed to break through his bottleneck. His Sword Dao required comprehension, and Long Chen’s insight allowed him to understand an aspect of his Sword Dao as well. This understanding was then what allowed the power of his Sword Dao to soar.

BOOM!

Just at that moment, Wilde’s door bolt smashed into the golden eagle. Both sides were knocked back.

“Again!”

“Alright!”

Long Chen and Yue Zifeng grabbed hold of that opportunity, once more attacking from the left and right. Sword Qi and a saber-image sent the eagle’s head flying.

After two attacks, a hint of rosiness appeared on Yue Zifeng’s face. He was just about to attack the third thirteenth rank beast when Long Chen suddenly shouted at him.

“Zifeng, stop. Retreat.”

Yue Zifeng stared at him blankly, but he still flew back.

Long Chen grabbed Wilde and also retreated, but he didn’t forget to grab the two corpses on the ground.

“Guo Ran, attack!” shouted Long Chen.

As a result, arrows rained down and miserable roars came from those beasts as they fell. The poison dragons’ poison was so powerful that even these powerful beasts were only able to struggle for a few breaths’ time before dying.

“Boss, I…” Yue Zifeng suddenly felt the world spinning around him, like he was about to faint.

“Your soul was affected. Just now, there was definitely something wrong with your two attacks. The Saber Dao is not a match for your Sword Dao. You can use it as a reference, but you can’t imitate it,” said Long Chen.Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

After Yue Zifeng had unleashed his second attack, Long Chen noticed something off. Yue Zifeng’s Spiritual Strength could only be considered average because a sword cultivator did not cultivate the body, the soul, or magical arts. They only cultivated the sword in their hand. Other than their Sword Dao, everything else about them was lacking.

The eighth form of Split the Heavens required a domineering Spiritual Strength as a foundation. It was very different from the Sword Dao’s light and graceful attacks. Although Yue Zifeng’s comprehension skill was very high, he had yet to completely think it through and had already put his new comprehension to use. Because of this, his attacks just now had deviated slightly from the Sword Dao, resulting in a backlash.

That was why Long Chen immediately gave the order to retreat. If they were surrounded by those beasts, he wouldn’t be able to look after both Wilde and Yue Zifeng.

BOOM!

As expected, even thirteenth rank beasts were unable to endure the poison. A spotted tiger finally fell to the ground once it was turned into a hedgehog from the rain of arrows.

It had been struck by tens of thousands of arrows. Despite the arrows barely being able to pierce its tough hide, the poison was too strong.

The other thirteenth rank beast also let out one last unwilling roar before collapsing.

As for the other beasts charging out, they also fell to the ground. A mountain of corpses quickly piled up.

“Wilde, hold the line. Quickly clean up the battlefield!” shouted Long Chen. He had the Luo Spirit race’s warriors suppress the channel with their arrows, while the others quickly grabbed all the corpses.

After just a few seconds, rumbling came from the channel, and more and more thirteenth rank beasts came flying out. Seeing that, Long Chen immediately gave the order to retreat.

Long Chen and the others quickly retreated to outside the barrier. In just a moment, the space within the barrier was already packed with powerful beasts. Amongst them were over ten thirteenth rank beasts. They roared furiously, but they didn’t dare to charge out of the blue light.

Long Chen led everyone away. Finding a secluded place, they began to count their spoils of battle.

“Zifeng, are you alright?” asked Long Chen.

“Boss, I might need to go into seclusion to fully digest this spark,” said Yue Zifeng.

Long Chen nodded. He then sent Yue Zifeng back to the mother tree, the best place to go into seclusion. Once Yue Zifeng had fully explored his new insights, Long Chen believed that he would be much more terrifying.

The four thirteenth rank beasts’ corpses were given to Wilde. As their meat possessed such immense power, even Wilde could only eat them one mouthful at a time. Also, It was a good thing that he was immune to poison and could eat the two beasts that had been poisoned to death.

As for the other corpses, Long Chen tossed them into the primal chaos space. The Heavenly Qilin Demon Trees had grown slightly listless after he activated the Six Star Battle Armor and needed to heal his arm, but with the addition of millions of corpses, that loss was negligible.

There were so many corpses that there wasn’t enough space to place them all. Hence, Long Chen ended up with a mountain of corpses on top of the black soil. They were slowly devoured.

After that, the abundant life energy caused the Heavenly Qilin Demon Trees to grow wildly.

Since there was no way for Long Chen to grow a forest of mother trees, he could only focus his attention on the Heavenly Qilin Demon Trees. They had originally reached a height of three hundred meters, but as the huge amount of life energy filled this space, they quickly grew.

After just two hours, all the corpses were absorbed, and the Heavenly Qilin Demon Trees reached a height of three thousand meters.

They had grown ten times taller, but the amount of life energy they contained was more than a hundred times greater.

At this point, they finally grew out of their sapling state. Branches and leaves had sprouted, growing in every direction.

“Let’s go back to the Poison Dragon Abyss.”

Long Chen was so excited that he almost started shouting. If the Heavenly Qilin Demon Trees had possessed this much life energy in the last battle, he would have dominated the battlefield.

Even if he was constantly injured and healing while he fought, he would be able to exhaust them to death. As long as he wasn’t killed in an instant, it could be said that he also possessed an undying body.

As for the Dao wounds in his body, although the mother tree was powerless to heal them, the Heavenly Qilin Demon Trees caused them to quickly heal now that their life energy had reached such a level. As a result, Long Chen could be said to have recovered to his peak condition.

After that, they returned to the Poison Dragon Abyss. As Long Chen’s Spiritual Strength had essentially recovered, Evilmoon unleashed its dragon pressure once more. On their way, Guo Ran and the others killed the terrified poison dragons and harvested their poison sacks and other things.

This time, Long Chen went deeper than before, and he finally saw the giant Ten Thousand Dragon Nest. But at this point, his Spiritual Strength ran out once more. After cleaning up the battlefield, he didn’t wait for more poison dragons to come out, and they retreated again.

They then returned to the beast valley and unleashed their poison arrows, killing the beasts. After using up their poison arrows, they hunted again in the Poison Dragon Abyss and so on. Things repeated themselves.

After a full seven days, Long Chen didn’t have any idea just how many poison dragons he had killed or how many beasts they had gathered.

In any case, just Wilde already had two hundred and thirty thirteenth rank beast corpses. That was not counting the ones he had eaten.

Moreover, the Heavenly Qilin Demon Trees were flourishing. They had finally reached a height of three hundred miles.

Every one of them contained an astonishing amount of life energy. It felt like Long Chen had an endless spring of life now.

“Boss, the poison dragons have all been killed.” Guo Ran shrugged, standing inside the Ten Thousand Dragon Nest.

“Damn. It’s too bad the four divine bones have had their energy sucked away. Well, if not for that, it wouldn’t have been able to produce so many poison dragons,” said Long Chen regretfully.

“Alright, call out Zhao Ritian to do his work. He can absorb the Ten Thousand Dragon Nest. There’s definitely an enormous amount of immortal metal contained within it.”
