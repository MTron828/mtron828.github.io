Chapter 1390 Scram!

Translator: BornToBe

“That direction is-!”

BOOM!

The earth shook and a plume of smoke rose from the distance. Because it was so far, they first felt the earth shaking before they heard the sound.

“The Mystic Peering Formation has been destroyed!”

That direction was where the Mystic Peering Formation was. The Xuantian Tower had unleashed an attack to destroy it.

Long Chen coldly stared at the shocked Life Star experts. “Did you fools think that sucking up to Pill Valley would allow you to do anything? After being used by Pill Valley, you still don’t realize you’re just idiotic cannon fodder. You might have forgotten, but while Pill Valley is strong, its interior is currently in a mess due to the chaos Long San caused. They’re too busy to bother with anything else right now. You fools weren’t even able to see this, and yet you still came to add fuel to the fire. If I try to talk reason with you, you play your games to avoid me. If I play your games, you start acting as shameless as possible. Well now, I’m not going to beat around the bush. In the future, I won’t be talking reason with any of you idiots. No matter who it is, either fuck off or fight! From top to bottom, from the Xuan Master to the workers, my Xuantian Dao Sect’s blood is hot, and our spines are straight! If you want to come suppress us, you can try and suppress us with your lives! That’s the only thing left to say. Any more words are meaningless. Scram!”

Long Chen’s words echoed through the air, and killing intent erupted out of him, causing the world to change color. An undefeatable will shook their hearts.

“Scram!”

“Scram!”

“Scram!”

The Dragonblood warriors, the Xuantian Dao Sect’s elite disciples, the inner sect disciples, the outer sect disciples, all of them roared.

Their voices seemed unstoppable. The air became saturated with the will of every member of the Xuantian Dao Sect.

“This kind of cohesiveness is something only Long Chen is capable of,” said Li Tianxuan emotionally.

“Of course. Even an old man like me feels my blood heating up. I almost want to shout with them,” laughed Liu Cang.

When Long Chen had roared, they had also been affected. They had felt something stir in them that they hadn’t in a long time.

The Tower Department Head bitterly smiled. Even someone like him had an urge to go out and dominate the battlefield, so it could be imagined what the young disciples were feeling.

Now they fully understood why the Dragonblood Legion’s warriors would be so united and follow Long Chen so unswervingly. That was because he possessed a charisma that could make others willing to fight to the death for him.

The Xuantian Dao Sect’s disciples had never been this united before. It was the result of Long Chen creating miracle after miracle, which had caused the Xuantian Dao Sect’s reputation to rise to the point that their light blinded the rest of the Eastern Xuan Region.

Any sect’s disciple would feel a sense of belonging and pride in their heart. But before, the Xuantian Dao Sect hadn’t done anything in particular to enforce this, so their hearts were scattered. It was Long Chen’s arrival that had caused everyone’s hearts to unite. Li Tianxuan had noticed that after the battle on Devil Spirit Mountain, after Long Chen had managed to defeat the Corrupt path’s Gui Yan, the Xuantian Dao Sect’s unity had been elevated to an unprecedented level.

There had been several times when outsiders tried to infiltrate the Xuantian Dao Sect and bribe its disciples to incite disharmony. But no matter what they offered, they were unable to shake those disciples’ hearts. They weren’t even able to buy a single worker.

Li Tianxuan knew that the reason they followed the Xuantian Dao Sect so loyally was because of Long Chen. Long Chen had become the idol of everyone here. He was essentially a god-like existence to them.

They all believed that as long as Long Chen was here, the Xuantian Dao Sect would continue to rise. They felt that just being in the same sect as him was a supreme glory. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

That was why when that worker had been bullied, he hadn’t said a word until they started insulting Long Chen. Then he would fight to the death to protect Long Chen’s glory.

With the millions of people in the Xuantian Dao Sect roaring at once, those Life Star experts turned pale. They could only leave dejectedly.

They were finally afraid. A single person’s power wasn’t something to be afraid of. The most terrifying thing was a power that was fully united from top to bottom.

No matter how solid the foundation, there were always weaknesses. But it was different with the Xuantian Dao Sect.

This time, the attitude of the Xuantian Dao Sect was clear. Long Chen’s position was no lower than Li Tianxuan’s in the Xuantian Dao Sect. Becoming enemies with Long Chen was becoming enemies with the Xuantian Dao Sect. Thus, trying to drive a wedge between them was impossible.

With the Life Star experts leaving, the disciples of the Xuantian Dao Sect let out heaven-shaking cheering. This victory belonged to all of them. Furthermore, Long Chen had finally reappeared. All the disciples cheered and surrounded Long Chen, like stars surrounding the moon.

They shouted until their throats were sore. Their gazes were fanatical. Li Tianxuan had concealed the truth so well that everyone in the Xuantian Dao Sect had been worried for Long Chen. They were aware that the Xuantian Dao Sect had been searching everywhere for medicine, and with the people provoking them right outside their door, a shadow had been cast over the sect.

However, today, Long Chen had reappeared, healthier than ever. Fighting against two peak heavenly geniuses, he had even managed to kill one. That made these disciples so excited that they didn’t even know what to do. They could only cheer crazily to express their emotions.

Meng Qi and Tang Wan-er were filled with pride. This man who was revered as a god was the one they loved.

Long Chen also felt emotional. He greeted these disciples as best as he could. In truth, no one in the world was completely good or completely bad.

Each person’s heart had a dark side. But some people could suppress that side, and some couldn’t. The most terrifying thing was for a person to be corrupted by their dark side without even realizing it. They would feel that what they were doing was correct, that they were right, and that no matter how vile their actions were, they wouldn’t need to feel any guilt.

Back when he had first arrived at the Xuantian Dao Sect, he had disliked this place. People were scheming against each other every day.

Yet today, through the Nine Star Hegemon Body Art, he could sense everyone’s emotions. Everyone here had absolute trust in him.

Perhaps only trust could give birth to belief, and once a person had a belief, it would form a guide for them.

People without any belief would have no bottom line and be easily drawn into depravity. That was terrifying.

However, if their faith was wrong, it would be even more terrifying. They would become crazy people filled with bigotry.

On one hand, there were the Wine God Palace’s disciples who believed in their Wine God and that the Wine Dao could lead them to the Heavenly Daos. They lived leisurely without any struggles.

There was also the Huayun Sect’s disciples. Their faith was in the Wealth God, and they believed that the Business Dao could lead them to the Heavenly Daos. Using their wealth, they could get rid of hunger and pain. They lived as businessmen, and so they treated their customers well. They also helped out countless poor people.

One of them detached themselves from the rest of the world, while one was intricately connected with the world. But in the end, what they pursued was the wealth of the mind and of the heart. They spread their happiness to others.

On the other hand, there were the Corrupt path and the Bloodkill Hall. The Corrupt path believed that the weak were prey to the strong, and that the weak could be slaughtered at will. Their version of the Heavenly Daos was one where only the strong would survive.

The Bloodkill Hall wasn’t much better, focusing on their Assassination Dao. They believed that every person in the world had sins that made it so they could kill them without any guilt. Killing people simply reduced the sin in the world. They were the servants of the Killing God, and were carrying out their divine mission.

In truth, each belief had its own principles and justifications. They were all paths that pursued the Heavenly Daos.

However, the path to the Heavenly Daos was built on the Human Dao, on the Mortal Dao, as a foundation. The goal was for the heavens and man to be one. Otherwise, cultivation wouldn’t begin with the body. There would be no Qi Condensation, Blood Condensation, Tendon Transformation, Bone Forging, Meridian Opening. The concept of building up Houtian power to step into the Xiantian realm wouldn’t exist.

Since it was a process of constant evolution, then the point was to undergo constant changes without losing touch with the source. What changed was just the outside, but not the heart.

Through cultivation, a person became stronger. But no matter how powerful they became, no matter how many magical arts they mastered, no matter what heights they reached, their innate character was something that shouldn’t change.

For example, mankind should treasure family, friends, and love. The foundation of how to conduct oneself was rooted in humbleness, righteousness, bravery, dedication, etc.

Yet, many people’s desires grew along with their martial power. They became arrogant and prejudiced.

It was like a dynasty ruled by a royal family. The dynasty started in the hands of a wise ruler and was destroyed in the hands of a corrupt ruler.

That was because they became too arrogant, believing themselves to be an omnipotent god. In the end, the foundation that had given them what they had, was destroyed.

Without the Human Dao, where would the Heavenly Daos come from? If you couldn’t even be a proper person, how could you cultivate the Heavenly Daos? That was why Long Chen didn’t believe in any god.

Some beliefs were wrong, so he wouldn’t believe in them. Some beliefs were correct, but they didn’t suit him. He had to walk his own path.

“Well done, Long Chen.” When Long Chen walked into the inner sect plaza, Li Tianxuan, Liu Cang, and the Tower Department Head were already standing at the center.

“Many thanks for your praise. If you praise me for a few more hours, I’ll be even happier.” Long Chen bowed. But that naughty smile was completely improper.

Perhaps only Long Chen would dare to speak to the Xuan Master like this in the Xuantian Dao Sect. However, Li Tianxuan was already used to the fact that this little fellow liked to speak without restraint, so he wasn’t offended. Instead, it made them seem even closer. Long Chen truly viewed the Xuan Master as a family elder, not a sect leader. The latter was a professional title, while the former seemed more intimate.

Li Tianxuan smiled and nodded. He had all the disciples go back and rest for now. Then he brought Long Chen to the peak of the Xuantian Tower alone.

“Not bad. You’ve managed to remove the curse. It seems you’ve already obtained the second volume of the Nirvana Scripture. And I heard you flipped the entire Pill Valley on its head. The name of Master Long San is shaking the entire world. Let me hear your marvelous story.”

“Ah, it was just me blindly messing around. It’s not even worth telling,” said Long Chen bashfully.

Although that was what came out of his mouth, his hands were already starting to gesture enthusiastically.
