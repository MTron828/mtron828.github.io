Chapter 4298 Domineering Purgatory Eyes

The heavenly tribulation rumbled as Long Zhantian’s seven-color divine radiance enveloped it. This divine radiance possessed immense Blood Qi.

Following that, a shocking phenomenon occurred. The heavenly tribulation quivered and seemed to fall under the control of some kind of force. A seven-color vortex then swirled up in the sky and fell on Long Chen.

If others were to see this scene, they would definitely be stupefied. The heavenly tribulation had been imprinted with a spiritual mark by Long Zhantian. In other words, Long Zhantian had taken control of the heavenly tribulation.

Just as this light enveloped Long Chen, the seven-color Supreme Blood in Long Chen’s body erupted, causing his body to unleash seven-color divine radiance. An explosive aura then unfurled with Long Chen at the center.

The surrounding mountains were blasted away, and seven-colored waves scoured heaven and earth. Long Chen was like a wild dragon that had been woken from hibernation and wanted to devour mountains and rivers.ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

With his eyes closed, Long Chen entered a deep meditative state, unaware of the events unfolding in the external world. Long Zhantian’s seven-color divine radiance was constantly flowing into the heavenly tribulation and then slowly entering Long Chen’s body through it.

Suddenly, Long Zhantian stood up and Long Chen rose at the same time. Both of their movements were identical.

Long Zhantian smiled with gratification. He was now linked with Long Chen, as this was the only way for him to transmit his runes to Long Chen.

Long Zhantian then raised a hand, conjuring a seven-colored sword in his grasp. Likewise, an identical sword also appeared in Long Chen’s hand.

BOOM!

Long Chen and Long Zhantian then slashed their swords down at the exact same time, splitting the void apart and causing two bottomless ditches to appear in the ground.

However, Long Zhantian frowned. The ditch he had slashed open was perfectly smooth, but Long Chen’s one was bumpy.

“Chen-er’s physical body is so powerful that he’s not used to relying on bloodline power. It’s harder for him to control it…” Long Zhantian murmured to himself and switched the sword to a spear. He stabbed the void, and then the spear transformed into a shield.

As Long Zhantian repeatedly summoned different weapons and unleashed different attacks, Long Chen was like a reflection following his movements.

“Although he hasn’t reached the level of perfect control, this is enough.” Long Zhantian finally smiled. These were techniques that Long Zhantian had comprehended during his time in confinement. Now, he was directly transmitting all of his comprehension to Long Chen through the heavenly tribulation.

At this moment, Long Zhantian raised his head to look at the heavenly tribulation. Its power was running out and was about to end, so Long Zhantian abruptly closed his eyes. When he opened them once more, seven-colored divine radiance appeared in his pupils, revealing the Supreme Heavenly Eyes.

As soon as Long Zhantian reopened his eyes, Long Chen mirrored the action. A seven-colored pattern emerged in Long Chen's eyes too. However, the moment the seven-colored design surfaced, it was overwhelmed by darkness.

“Ah!”

Long Zhantian suddenly cried out in agony as a sharp pain seared through his eyes, causing blood to flow.

“Dad, what is it?!”

Long Chen was woken from his meditative state. Seeing his father’s eyes bleeding, he was shocked.

“I’m fine. It’s nothing.”

Long Zhantian waved his hand to signal Long Chen not to panic. Meanwhile, the heavenly tribulation faded. Long Zhantian was pale, his aura somewhat a bit weak, but he was now an Immortal King.

“Chen-er, I tried to transmit the Supreme Heavenly Eyes to you, but your Purgatory Eyes are too domineering to permit it. But this also proves that your Purgatory Eyes are even stronger than the Supreme Heavenly Eyes. This is a good thing,” said Long Zhantian.

Long Zhantian took out a black cloth, which Long Chen swiftly accepted and used to cover Long Zhantian's eyes. After that, Long Chen gave him a healing pill.

“Chen-er, you have run into shocking opportunities. There’s no limit to your future. To have such a son is your dad’s greatest pride…” Long Zhantian rubbed Long Chen’s cheek lightly, smiling.

“Dad, you…” Long Chen was startled.

“I’m overjoyed to have reunited with you, but I still have something important to do. I cannot accompany you any longer,” said Long Zhantian.

“Dad, are you going to leave?!” cried out Long Chen.

Long Zhantian nodded. “I miss your mom. I don’t know how she is right now, but I have to find her.”

Long Chen nodded in understanding. He knew that his father would have to find his mother, but he hadn't anticipated how urgent the matter was to him.

“Dad, you’re injured. You…” Long Chen tried to keep him behind.

Long Zhantian brushed Long Chen off with a smile. “This injury is nothing. I just temporarily won’t be able to use the Supreme Heavenly Eyes. Anyway, I just awakened them and don’t know how to properly use them yet, so it makes no difference. As for my current state, although I just advanced to Immortal King realm, my power…”

Long Zhantian flicked his finger, and a ray of seven-colored divine light shot out, leaving a large hole in the void. This casual blow actually pierced straight through the walls of space.

Seeing this scene, Long Chen jumped in shock. Although he was capable of the same feat, he would have to be in his full-power state to do so. On the other hand, Long Zhantian had casually flicked his finger and was able to produce an attack comparable to Yue Zifeng’s all-out blow. This meant that if someone like his father had intentions to harm him, then at this distance, he wouldn’t even have a chance to fight back.

“Now are you at ease? Although I don’t have as many trump cards as you, I’ve been studying the seven-color Supreme Blood for many years. I have the necessary power to be confident. Furthermore, I have the seven-color manifestation rooted in primal chaos qi. Once I undergo my World King tribulation, I will have a primal chaos manifestation. In this aspect, I am ahead of you,” said Long Zhantian.

“I just feel like you should absorb all your essence blood first before leaving. I’d feel better like that,” said Long Chen.

Long Zhantian shook his head. “My World King tribulation cannot be done in the Nirvana Overflow Heaven with you. Both of our World King tribulations will probably spread far and wide. Thus, once one of us undergoes tribulation, the laws of the Heavenly Daos might be so greatly shaken that it will affect the other person. You are currently capable of undergoing your tribulation right now, so I would advise you to finish your preparations and complete your tribulation before everyone else does. If everyone else absorbs too much primal chaos qi, it will affect your tribulation.”

Long Chen could only nod. He was unwilling to part with his father after such a short reunion, but Long Zhantian patted his shoulders.

“Chen-er, you have many treasures on you, but you still don’t know how to use them. Despite sitting on a gold mine, you have to act like a miser. However, your father believes that you will find the key to opening your treasures. I’m going. Since we’re all men, let’s not cry. When I find your mother, I will immediately come to find you.”

Long Chen bit his lip and nodded. Despite being viewed as a peerless hero by many, he felt like an ordinary child at this moment. After a brief reunion with his father, they had to part once more.

“When the sun rises, the snow melts, and the branch springs back to the heavens," Long Zhantian recited. He departed without a single tear shed. As he disappeared, his voice lingered, echoing through the vast expanse of heaven and earth.
