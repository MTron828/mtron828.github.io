Chapter 2398 The Former Master of the Moon and Star Refining Furnace

Translator: BornToBe

“Leaving us both with one chance is because I’m busy. We now have one set each and can bring out our true skills,” said Long Chen indifferently. He had completely changed. Now that he was serious, he definitely possessed the air of a master.

“Then I’ll show you.” Ye Qian’s fury and arrogance finally faded. Now he understood that like himself, Long Chen also had absolute confidence. If he continued like this, the one to lose in the end might be him.

Ye Qian waved his hand. An ancient pill furnace appeared before everyone, and every alchemist present grew envious.

“The Dragon Phoenix Cosmos Furnace. I’m finally getting to see this priceless treasure in person.”

All the Divine Pill Division’s disciples stared at it, and the cry of a phoenix and dragon could vaguely be heard. Clouds began to gather in the sky, with Heavenly Dao energy surging over. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

This was an extremely ancient divine furnace. An alchemist using it would find refining pills much easier.

“Take out your pill furnace. If you don’t have one, I don’t mind giving you one,” sneered Ye Qian.

Although he now viewed Long Chen as an opponent, he couldn’t hold back his rage at being conned thrice, in addition to having his throat held inside the treasury.

“I really don’t have a good pill furnace. Why don’t you give me one?” Long Chen also sneered. He waved his hand, taking out a pill furnace that was covered in rust and looked worn down.

Everyone was silent, but then the Divine Pill Division’s disciples began to laugh.

“What a poor ghost. He’s actually using such a rusty furnace to compete with senior apprentice-brother Ye Qian? Why not just take out a chamber pot?”

Feng Fei frowned. One of her attendants was about to stand again, but Feng Fei shook her head. “These fools don’t even know what a priceless treasure that is. In a bit, they’ll know how blind they are.”

Even the Elders of the Divine Pill Division were startled. What was Long Chen thinking by using such a broken furnace? Was he trying to insult the Divine Pill Division?

However, the Pill Doyen’s body shuddered. His eyes were filled with disbelief.

“The Moon and Star Refining Furnace? Is this real?” The Pill Doyen actually stood and walked over to Long Chen.

“Senior, you recognize the Moon and Star Refining Furnace?” This time, it was Long Chen’s turn to be surprised. He hadn’t expected someone to recognize it.

“Of course I recognize it. How could I not recognize the leader of the ancient era’s ten great pill furnaces?” The Pill Doyen respectfully rubbed the Moon and Star Refining Furnace. He sighed, “The ancient records state that the Moon and Star Refining Furnace’s final master was Yan Qingsheng. In a battle alongside the Sovereign, the alchemy grandmaster Yan Qingsheng fell, while the Moon and Star Refining Furnace was broken. Who would have thought that the ancient records were wrong? It is still present, but it’s badly damaged. Although its soul has gradually awakened, it’s still a very long way from being fully restored.”

This was Long Chen’s first time hearing most of this information. He hadn’t known that the Moon and Star Refining Furnace’s origins were even greater than he had thought. It was the head of the ten great pill furnaces of the ancient era!

Right now, its soul was too badly damaged, and he could only communicate with it simply. An item-spirit was different from a human, and its core was badly damaged.

He hadn’t expected that this cauldron that the Mechanism Sect had sent his way thanks to the Dongfang family would end up profiting him so immensely.

“Long Chen, if you are interested, my Divine Pill Division will give you a nice price for it,” said the division head.

As soon as he said this, killing intent appeared in Long Chen’s eyes. He vanished, appearing in front of the division head and grabbing his throat. “Do you want to try repeating what you just said?”

Long Chen’s sudden hostility made everyone jump. Furthermore, did he not realize he was holding the throat of the division head?

With his left hand holding his throat, Long Chen’s other hand was pressed against his chest. Destructive power thrummed in his palm. As long as he released it, the division head would be blasted apart.

The division head was furious at this. He had just asked if Long Chen wanted to sell his furnace, but Long Chen somehow became crazy. He didn’t dare to do anything, afraid that Long Chen would really kill him.

Alchemists were not martial cultivators. They had very weak bodies, and a lack of battle experience meant that even a fourth step Netherpassage alchemist could be easily killed by Long Chen at such a close distance.

The various experts present began to take out their weapons, surrounding Long Chen.

“Everyone, stop!” shouted the Pill Doyen. He turned to Long Chen. “Long Chen, my apologies. He is not a martial artist and doesn’t know certain rules. On account of this old man’s face, can you forgive him this one time?”

The divine families’ people didn’t dare to believe their ears. The Pill Doyen was actually apologizing to Long Chen? Had the world gone insane?

Long Chen gloomily tossed the division head to the side. “On account of senior Pill Doyen’s face, I’ll let you off. If not for him, even if the master of the divine families came, I’d still kill you.”

Free from him, the division head furiously shouted, “You-!”

The Pill Doyen said, “Shut up. This is the result of your own ignorance. In the divine families, our pill furnaces are all inherited, so you don’t know the rules of the outside world. A pill furnace with its own spirit like the Moon and Star Refining Furnace will not easily choose a new master. Once chosen, it will not find another master unless the previous master dies. The master of the pill furnace is the same, and they will protect their pill furnace with their life. You wanted to buy his pill furnace without even understanding this? That’s one of the gravest insults. If Long Chen said that he wanted to buy your wife, what would you do?”

The division head fell silent. He hadn’t heard of such a thing before. The other members of the divine families also came to an understanding.

Seeing that the division head really hadn’t known about such a rule, Long Chen’s expression softened slightly. Just now, he had really wanted to kill him.

Thanks to the Pill Doyen’s explanation, the misunderstanding was cleared up. But even if he had been mistaken, the division head couldn’t apologize to a member of the junior generation, especially not after Long Chen had grabbed his throat and made him lose face.

The Pill Doyen sighed. “The Moon and Star Refining Furnace was actually damaged to such an extent. That battle must have been terrifying. Yan Qingsheng was a grandmaster of the Pill Dao. Of the current pill formulas used in the world, hundreds were created by him. He was able to progress the techniques of ancient alchemists and innovate new ideas, allowing future generations to become closer to the Pill Dao easier. It can be said that he is a monument in the history of alchemy, someone with unmatched contributions to the path of alchemy. Most admirable of all, even when the dark era came, he chose to participate and died in battle. While it saddens me that he died, his heroism is moving.”

“Many thanks for informing me about the history of the Moon and Star Refining Furnace. Its item-spirit is still too injured and just woke up. It was unable to tell me about this history.” Long Chen cupped his fists.

“For the Moon and Star Refining Furnace to accept you as its master means that you are definitely a match for it. Well, haha, it seems that I’ve said too much. The competition can continue.” The Pill Doyen looked once more at the Moon and Star Refining Furnace before returning to his seat.

Everyone was deathly silent. Those disciples of the Divine Pill Division in particular felt a fiery hot sensation on their faces. Their blind mocking had now turned into a giant slap in their faces.

Ye Qian looked at the Moon and Star Refining Furnace. He was unable to tell what was so amazing about it, but the Pill Doyen’s words were still ringing in his ears.

The leader of the ten great pill furnaces of the ancient era. As for his Dragon Phoenix Cosmos Furnace, although it was a priceless treasure, it wasn’t qualified to enter the top ten. In fact, its history could not be traced back to those times.

“Long Chen…”

“If you dare to get an idea about my pill furnace, I’ll kill you right here. Don’t test my bottom line. At such a close distance, no one can stop me from killing you,” said Long Chen preemptively.

No matter how famous the Moon and Star Refining Furnace was, he had never viewed it as a tool. It was one of his companions. If someone wanted him to use it as a gambling chip, it would be one of the worst insults.

Ye Qian snorted. “So what if you have a good furnace? Its body is broken and its item-spirit has yet to fully awaken. You can’t beat me with that.”

Ye Qian suddenly patted the Dragon Phoenix Cosmos Furnace. Two pillars of divine light soared into the sky, intertwining like a dragon and phoenix.

A medicinal ingredient entered his pill furnace. He was finally starting his alchemy, and the atmosphere tensed once more.
