Chapter 3261 Yuhua Patriarch

“Senior apprentice-sister Yu Xuan, I’m fine.” At this moment, warmth appeared in Qi Yu’s hardened eyes. But there were also conflicting feelings behind them.

“Qi Yu, I believe in you. You definitely wouldn’t do anything like that!” That Yu Xuan was Qi Yu’s lover. As soon as she declared this, Qi Yu’s eyes reddened. He wasn’t afraid of being harmed by others. Mountains of blades, seas of blood, he was unafraid of all of them. But he was afraid of the person closest to him not believing in him.

He was touched by her words. To have such a lover, even death would be worth it.

“It doesn’t matter if you don’t believe it. So many people personally saw it, so he was the one to kill those disciples.” A sinister voice rang out filled with disdain and contempt.

Long Chen turned toward the source of the voice and saw a fair-skinned man standing amongst a group of disciples. He swaggered over here.

This person’s gaze possessed both a demonic charm and sinister air. No matter how Long Chen looked at him, the latter didn’t seem to be a good person.

Long Chen instantly knew who he was. As expected, as soon as he appeared, Yu Xuan furiously said, “Jiang Baihe, don’t slander people! Qi Yu never acted in such a way. He has always acted magnanimously and in an upright fashion. Everyone in the Yuhua Palace can see that. He has never bullied the weak, nor did he have any enmity with those new disciples. Why would he kill them?”

“You’ll have to ask him if you want to know why he killed them. Why are you asking me?” Jiang Baihe sneered. He was extremely haughty. He then cast a glance at Long Chen and the others. When his gaze fell on Bai Shishi’s face, his eyes brightened.

Yu Xuan was truly beautiful, but compared to Bai Shishi, she lost her splendor. Hence, Jiang Baihe’s eyes shone brightly as he eyed Bai Shishi.

“Shut your mouth!” 

Jiang Baihe was about to say something to her when Long Chen directly interrupted him. He couldn’t be bothered to speak with such a person.

“Yu Xuan, let me introduce you. This is my boss, Long Chen, whom I always told you about.”

Qi Yu’s mood was good. As long as Yu Xuan believed in him, then even if the heavens collapsed, he wasn’t afraid.

Hearing this, Yu Xuan immediately bowed to Long Chen. Long Chen then appraised her. She seemed to be both kind and stubborn, the type to take a personal stance against bad people.

Long Chen returned her greeting and smiled. “My brother’s vision really is good. The two of you are a good match. I just have one question. If the Yuhua Palace is destroyed today, will you hate him?”

“I…”

Yu Xuan was stunned, and she stared in shock at Long Chen. Although Qi Yu had told her that Long Chen was the strongest person in existence, looking at his cultivation base, she really couldn’t believe that he was that powerful.

Furthermore, Long Chen was saying such brazen words in front of everyone, including her master. So, she didn’t know how to respond to it.

The elder that had come with her was her master, the vice palace master. He always treated her and Qi Yu very well. Qi Yu’s primal bloodline had been awakened thanks to her pleading with her master for aid.

“Hahaha, you keep saying that you’ll destroy my Yuhua Palace. As I see it, you’ve gone mad!”

“I’ve seen this brat before! He got famous in the Heavenly Swell Domain’s Nine Prefecture Convention! Have you forgotten?”

“Does he not know that the Nine Prefecture Convention is a gathering of novices? Here in the Heavenly Star Domain, he is trash.”

The disciples near Jiang Baihe sneered at Long Chen. Their appearance was like they wished to trample Long Chen beneath their feet.

“Xiaole, have them shut their mouths. Forever,” said Long Chen indifferently.

Suddenly, space quivered and those disciples that had opened their mouths suddenly had their heads explode. Over ten experts died just like that.

After that, Bai Xiaole slowly undid his hand seals, and the mark of the Three Flower Pupils slowly faded. He exterminated those experts effortlessly.

Bai Xiaole had trained on the Honing Heavenly Staircase and had gone through his mother’s training. He had finally become a true warrior. Also, he had fully comprehended that there was no need to have any mercy against enemies, nor did he have to have any misgivings.

At this moment, the Yuhua Palace’s experts were shocked and enraged. This bizarre pupil art killed people out of nowhere. It was terrifying.

All those dead disciples were Jiang Baihe’s followers, and they were also Primals. Such powerful existences had been instantly killed, so how could the others not be afraid?

“Courting death!”

The palace master roared furiously. As he did, the terrifying might of an Immortal King erupted and a palm smashed toward Long Chen and the others.

Seeing this, Long Chen snorted and extended his hand. Just as he was about to summon his bone saber, an ancient voice rang out.

“Jiang Weizhong, with your current actions, do you feel that you are unrivaled beneath the heavens? You think that you don’t need to place anyone else in your eyes, huh?”

“Ancestral patriarch!”

When they heard that voice, the senior members of the Yuhua Palace cried out in shock. They recognized this voice.

This patriarch had not appeared in thousands of years, and they hadn’t expected this matter to disturb him.

“Patriarch, this group of people goes too far! There’s someone pretending to be the dean of the High Firmament Academy, and they even killed disciples of the Yuhua Palace! They must be executed for their sins!” declared the palace master.

Suddenly, a stooped elder appeared in front of everyone. He was an exceedingly old person. His snow-white eyebrows drooped down all the way to his chest, and the wrinkles on his face were so deep that they looked like bark.

However, his eyes were exceedingly deep. He was old but not decrepit, giving others an unfathomable feeling.

With his arrival, everyone from the Yuhua Palace, including the palace master, hastily knelt on the ground.

“Greetings, patriarch!”

This elder ignored their actions. He only looked toward Long Chen and smiled.

“Is the noble sweeper of the academy still doing well?”

“His body is still healthy, and he’s still sweeping the ground every day. He is well,” said Long Chen. He was surprised by this elder. He hadn’t expected the Yuhua Palace to have such an existence.Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

His aura could not be judged, and he was a monster that should be called a living fossil. This was something that Long Chen hadn’t factored into his calculations.

However, based on his tone, this elder seemed to know the sweeping elder. Even so, as Long Chen wasn’t sure what this elder’s plan was, he said, “Senior, this junior came today not to cause trouble, but to obtain justice for my brother. I have the seal right here. I truly am the dean of the High Firmament Academy’s seventh branch. Senior can take a look.”

“You naturally aren’t a fake. It was my Yuhua Palace that lacked manners. This isn’t the place to talk. Why don’t we go chat in the palace?” The patriarch’s tone was very polite.

“Then I’ll disturb you.” Just like that, Long Chen followed the patriarch toward the main palace. As for the palace master, his expression was rather ugly, but he could only follow as well.

Once they were in the palace and everyone was seated, Long Chen got straight to the point.

“Senior, I wish to know, according to the rules of your noble palace, what is the punishment for killing members of the same sect?”
