Chapter 4231: Divine Ability Crushing

The one to shout to Long Chen was a Dragonblood warrior. He was shouting with all his might from the other end of the martial stage.

He was overwhelmed with emotion. At the start, things were too chaotic for him to spot Long Chen in the crowd.

However, Long Chen's World Extermination Flame Lotus acted as a beacon, instantly catching his attention. He immediately recognized this potent trump card of Long Chen's.

Moreover, this Dragonblood warrior was not alone; an entire group of Dragonblood warriors were also calling out to Long Chen. Previously, Long Chen had been wondering about why so few of his brothers had managed to reunite this time.

As it turned out, a portion of them had actually been here, in the mirror world. Now that both worlds had merged, even more Dragonblood warriors were reunited.

Now that Long Chen had shown up in front of them, they instantly jumped up and wanted to traverse the entire martial stage to reach him.

“Wait for me!”

Long Chen shouted and flapped his Kunpeng wings, pointing the Minghong Saber in front of him. He then shot out, his body spun rapidly like a drill, obliterating any dark creatures in his path.

Long Chen was incredibly fast and unstoppable. In just a few breaths’ time, he had traversed half the martial stage, passing by the center. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

On the way, it was unknown just how many dark creatures he had killed. This time, an immeasurable number of experts, both inside and outside the martial stage, were left astounded. They couldn't fathom the technique Long Chen had employed to eliminate the dark creatures.

Strange ripples were flowing out of the tip of Long Chen’s saber, coalescing into a barrier of light resembling the tip of a spear. Any dark creatures that touched it were killed.

“That isn’t the human race’s magical arts!”

“Hmph, that is my Kungpeng race’s divine ability, Kunpeng Void Breaker. This little human must be killed!” roared an expert of the Kunpeng race from outside the martial stage.

The fact that the Kunpeng race's wings had been refined by a human was a source of disgrace for their kind. Furthermore, Long Chen was currently manifesting a divine ability that had nearly been lost within the Kunpeng race. This revelation left them both astounded and infuriated.

It had to be known that this divine ability rarely appeared in the Kunpeng race, almost like a legend. Kunpeng Void Breaker was one of the Kunpeng race’s strongest movement arts. It was rumored that when this technique was refined to the pinnacle, it could pierce through the very stars, transcend the boundaries of the world, and grant the user the ability to roam the cosmos.

Hence, the fact that Long Chen was showcasing this technique before their eyes filled them with envy, intensifying their sense of disgrace.

“Damn human race, you dare to blaspheme my Kunpeng race?! Die!”

When Long Chen passed by the central area, the void suddenly split open, giving rise to an immense figure—a gigantic Kunpeng. With a mere unfurling of its wings, it blasted apart countless dark creatures.

The enormous Kunpeng then blocked Long Chen’s path. It was a terrifying expert of the Kunpeng race, one who was already enraged after failing to obtain the karmic luck bead. Hence, upon seeing Long Chen using the Kunpeng race’s divine abilities, its rage could only be unleashed on him.

Suddenly, it opened its mouth, and divine light flowed through its feathers. The next moment, an enormous sharp blade was spat out at Long Chen.

The attack was exceptionally swift and precise, leaving Long Chen with no room to maneuver. Everyone could instantly tell that this was a true expert with extensive battle experience.

As the divine radiance surrounding Long Chen clashed with the sharp blade, a startling spectacle unfolded. The spinning ray of divine light that was Long Chen pierced straight through that Kunpeng’s open mouth and out the back of its head. Following that, an enormous force directly blew apart that Kunpeng’s body.

“What?!”

Shocked cries reverberated throughout the area. That Kunpeng couldn't even withstand a single strike from Long Chen. Long Chen seemed to dismiss it entirely, destroying its attack and killing it in a single motion.

The most shocked ones were the experts of the Kunpeng race. They were well aware of just how powerful that sharp blade was, yet Long Chen had easily shattered it. When their two divine abilities clashed, the sharp blade instantly weakened.

There was only one plausible explanation—the rank difference between these two divine abilities was so immense that one was completely crushed.

Within the Kunpeng race, a rigorous hierarchy was in place, determined partially by one's bloodline purity and partly by the rankings of their divine abilities.

After all, the same divine ability could exhibit varying levels of power when wielded by different individuals. If that slain Kunpeng’s divine ability had achieved the third grade, then Long Chen’s divine ability must have reached the fifth grade.

A mere one-rank difference between divine abilities would cause the weaker divine ability to be crushed. This kind of phenomenon was not that common among the human race but was often seen in the demonic beast race.

As Long Chen was able to slay that Kunpeng so easily, his mastery of their divine abilities must be far above that of the Kunpeng. This outcome left countless Kunpeng experts feeling uneasy. The fact that a mere human could wield their divine ability to such an extent was an intolerable disgrace to the entire Kunpeng race.

This interference didn’t stop or even slow Long Chen down. He continued speeding through the air.

In another few breaths, after slaying countless dark creatures, Long Chen had crossed the entire martial stage and finally arrived at the other world’s human race’s side.

“Boss!”

The Dragonblood warriors came charging out, their eyes red and even their voices choked with sobs.

Likewise, Long Chen was also emotional. He then reached and embraced them one by one as fiercely as he could.

These Dragonblood warriors hadn’t known that Long Chen was on the other side. Seeing him arrive so suddenly, this reunion caused tears to spill to the ground.

After that, Long Chen took a quick count and saw that there were close to three thousand Dragonblood warriors here, essentially all his brothers whom he hadn’t seen in the three thousand worlds.

Furthermore, their powers were extremely uneven. Quite a few of them had very weak auras and hadn't even reached the level of Supremes. Upon closer look, some of his brothers even wore tattered clothes and cracked armor, indicating they had faced tough challenges without access to good resources for growth.

"Brothers, it's been tough on you," Long Chen said, his emotions welling up. Seeing his hot-blooded brothers in such a state was heart-wrenching.

Many of them weren’t particularly strong, and Long Chen couldn't help but wonder how many perilous situations they had faced on their journey to reach this point? Despite their weakness, they still managed to come here just to reunite with him. Thinking about this, Long Chen was filled with guilt.

Long Chen cherished his brothers deeply; they were all exceptional comrades. However, he couldn't help but feel like he had failed them as their leader. They had to endure so much suffering on their journey.

“If it’s so hard, why not just die and get it over with? Do you want this lord to send you on your way?”

Just as Long Chen and the others were lost in their emotions, a sinister voice rang out.
