Chapter 4356 Flipping Heaven and Earth

An icy voice rang out. Following that, a man in white robes with a scholar’s band on his head walked out.

This white-robed man was handsome and refined, looking more like a studious scholar than a cultivator.

However, when the crowd saw that man, startled cries erupted as they recognized his status. At that moment, a character slowly dimmed on the back of that woman.

Everyone behind the woman saw the timely appearance of the “Defend” character just as she was about to be pierced by the arrow. This one character had saved her life.

“One of the four immemorial sects, the Calligraphy Sect!”

That unique aura belonged exclusively to disciples of the Calligraphy Sect. Only they had the ability to command characters in such a manner, using them to delve into the Dao and incorporating them into their mystical arts.

“Many thanks for saving my life, senior apprentice-brother.” It was only then that the woman realized her savior was this scholarly man, and she hastily cupped her fists toward him.

The scholar smiled slightly and reciprocated with a courteous gesture. “My lady’s heart is righteous. To dare to speak out against other people’s slander, this little scholar finds it admirable. Truly, your spirit does not lose out to that of a man.”

The woman was instantly a bit embarrassed after hearing this praise. For a while, she didn’t know what to say.

“Hey, your four immemorial sects never get involved in worldly affairs. What do you think you’re doing right now? Have you gotten tired of hiding in your tortoise shell and want to stand out?” sneered someone in the crowd.

Covered in scales and emanating a powerful Blood Qi, this person had to be from the other races. His voice resonated with a powerful and thunderous aura, and most terrifying of all, he had primal chaos qi swirling around him, proof that he had managed to root himself into primal chaos. In the future, he had a chance of reaching the Eternal realm.

To root into primal chaos signified that the cultivator had obtained the recognition of the primal chaos’s Heavenly Daos—a kind of admission ticket to an exam. Only with this qualification could one attempt to reach the Eternal realm.

In the past, the idea of reaching such a level was unimaginable because there was no primal chaos qi. How were you supposed to root into primal chaos then?

However, with the gates to the other worlds open, primal chaos qi had flooded the Nirvana Overflow Heaven, offering everyone a chance to root themselves in primal chaos. Yet, having an opportunity was just that—an opportunity. Only incredibly talented geniuses could manifest rooting into primal chaos within the World King realm.

It was rumored that those who could achieve this feat in the World King realm had a one-in-a-thousand chance of reaching the Eternal realm. If they could only attain this level in the Divine Venerate realm, their likelihood of reaching the Eternal realm would drop to less than one in a million.

Although many heavenly geniuses were rising throughout this world at the moment, people capable of rooting themselves into primal chaos remained extremely rare. They were experts amongst experts, elites amongst elites.

This scaled expert was precisely such an expert, and his tone was also extremely aggressive. He went as far as calling the four immemorial sects cowards, clearly looking down on them.

However, the scholar’s expression remained unaffected by the mockery. He calmly remarked, “My Calligraphy Sect does not engage in worldly affairs. We harbor no intention of rousing anyone’s ire. However, in the end, the Calligraphy Sect is a human faction. We naturally cannot just stand by and watch as the human race’s righteous warriors are slain. As for standing out, how is fighting for the human race considered standing out?”

“Cut the crap! Have you come to help the Starry River Sect?!” demanded the scaled expert.

“I did not come to help. I came to watch. In the Calligraphy Sect, senior apprentice-brother Li Chenggang told me that the unrivaled hero of this world is Long Chen. I feel great reverence for senior apprentice-brother Li Chenggang, so I came all this way because I wish to see the style of this hero of his,” said the scholar.

“So you’re on the same side as Long Chen. Then there’s no need to keep talking. Hand over your life!”

The scaled expert suddenly stamped on the air, shooting toward the scholar. He had no misgivings about starting a fight just like this.

BOOM!

The scaled expert’s sharp claws raked through the air, and primal chaos qi burst out of him. He immediately launched a full-power blow, leaving no room for discussion.

Many were taken aback by his audacity. While the four immemorial sects might not participate in worldly affairs, they were well known for having unfathomable power. Was he not afraid of the Calligraphy Sect’s reprisal?

The scholar, both startled and infuriated, hadn't anticipated the scaled expert starting a fight in such a manner, let alone aiming for his life. Hence, his temper flared.

“The Calligraphy Sect’s disciples are not afraid of the likes of you.”

The scholar swiftly formed one-handed seals, conjuring a “Shield” character on his palm. With a forceful clap, he spread his hands, and the character hovered between them.

Two shields of divine light then materialized around his hands, each measuring about one foot in length. Immortal characters flowed on top of them along with sacred light.

BOOM!

The scaled expert’s claws slammed onto one of the shields, causing it to explode. However, his arms turned numb from the impact.DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

BANG!

Following the destruction of one shield, the other one lunged toward the scaled expert. Surprisingly, it left the scholar’s hand and struck the scaled expert’s chest.

The scaled expert spat out a mouthful of blood. Caught off-guard, he instantly suffered a significant injury.

“What?!” Startled cries rang out. This disciple of the Calligraphy Sect was too strong, wasn’t he?

However, some discerning experts could see that it wasn’t that he was so powerful, but that this scaled expert was too careless. He had thought that this simple move would crush this seemingly weak scholar and was caught off-guard by the counterattack.

“Victory has been decided. You’ve lost, and any further fighting is meaningless. Anyway, I didn’t come to fight. I only came to watch,” said the scholar indifferently, choosing not to press the attack.

The scaled expert’s eyes still had stars spinning in them, and he spat out more blood. After a brief moment of rest, he slowly rose.

“You’re the one who lost! Your damn human race will all die!” he suddenly roared, and his manifestation burst into existence behind him—an enormous blood crocodile. A berserk Blood Qi pressure then crashed down when he opened his mouth.

A blood-colored ray of divine light shot toward the scholar, advancing with a snake-like motion.

“Courting death!” The scholar was enraged. This scaled expert didn’t show any gratitude for his mercy and instead unleashed an innate divine ability to kill him.

“Flipping Heaven and Earth!” the scholar shouted. He took out a scroll that was densely packed with immortal characters. As he pressed his hands against it, countless immortal characters lit up, forming a water-like screen of light before him.

Buzz.

The blood-colored ray of divine light didn’t explode when it landed on the scroll. Instead, people were stunned to see it bounce off and return to the scaled expert.

Struck by his own attack, the scaled expert exploded and transformed into blood mist.

As for the scholar, his face turned as pale as paper after blocking this attack. Clearly, reflecting that attack came at an immense price.

“Damn human race! Pay for my son’s life!” A furious roar rang out. An enormous claw then slammed toward the scholar. Time seemed to freeze as a terrifying pressure rendered everyone incapable of movement.

Clearly, an Eternal expert had joined the fray. The father of the scaled expert had arrived too late to save his son and could only watch as he was slain. Overwhelmed by grief, he went berserk and launched an attack against his son's killer.

BOOM!

Just as everyone thought that this scholar was done for, a hand appeared in front of him and forcibly intercepted that enormous claw.

When they saw who it was, countless people’s blood ignited with an unrivaled passion. The resounding cheers of the people echoed through heaven and earth like a tsunami.
