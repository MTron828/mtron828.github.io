Chapter 2168 Zheng Wenlong Arrives

The old man left. After that, the Dragonblood warriors and the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow race began to clean up the battlefield.

Seeing the corpses of the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrows, Cloud wept. A shadow crossed the hearts of all the surviving Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrows. Along with that shadow was endless hatred.

“Don’t cry. Although they died, they did it to protect our honor. They are the heroes of the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow race. Furthermore, even though we were outnumbered thirty to one, you’ve shown the world your power. The Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow race will never be viewed as weaklings to be bullied and hunted again,” announced Que Yuzhu.

That encouragement lifted their spirits slightly. The corpses were gathered, to be buried in their ancestral land.

“I’m sorry, race leader Que.” Long Chen came over to Que Yuzhu. It was his carelessness in sending Gu Yang, Li Qi, and the others that had resulted in so many casualties.

Just now, he had glanced around and estimated that at least hundreds of the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow race’s elites had been killed. That was a huge blow to them.

Que Yuzhu shook her head. “I should be apologizing to you. The Kunpeng race and the Nine Heavens Divine Phoenix race have always been our enemies. We were the ones who implicated you.”

“Big brother Long Chen.” At this moment, Cloud jumped into Long Chen’s embrace like a child, crying, “I was useless. I couldn’t beat the bad people. I couldn’t protect my family.”

Long Chen hugged Cloud tightly, comforting her. “You’re already very powerful. You just came out of seclusion and haven’t fully mastered your divine abilities. Once you do, you’ll definitely be able to beat them.”

Cloud’s divine abilities were truly frightening, especially the Divine Sparrow Swallows the Heavens. If she was a bit stronger or had better timing, then even Kun Pengzi might have been killed.

Cloud’s potential was immense, but she hadn’t had enough time to grow. There was no way for her to compare to an Emperor’s heir in terms of foundation. Just being able to reach her current level was already very worthy of praise.

“Really?” Cloud wiped away her tears.

“Of course. You’re amazing. You just didn’t have enough time. Kun Pengzi is much older, and while sealed, he was nourished with divine elixir. But as long as you work hard, you’ll definitely be able to beat him one day. I promise you.” Long Chen rubbed Cloud’s head.

“Alright, then I’m going to train right now! I’ll definitely defeat those bad people and get our vengeance.” Cloud directly flew into the Myriad Spirit Diagram and continued her cultivation.

There was a special space inside where she could freely practice her divine abilities and learn to control them.

“Boss, we lost face for you.” The Dragonblood warriors also apologized.

“That was an army of twelfth rank Xuan Beasts, but you stopped them at the door. That’s already great.” Long Chen waved his hand dismissively.

Long Chen did not have the slightest intention of blaming them. Just three thousand people had been able to block the enemies from charging in. That had been the right choice because if they had charged in, then they would have massacred the weaker members of the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow race and might have disturbed Chu Yao and the others.

However, by being focused on blocking them there, they had been forced to watch as experts of the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow race died one by one. Some of those experts had been their friends, people they had exchanged pointers with.

“What are you all scowling about? Losing and winning are very normal. Let alone you, even I wasn’t able to kill Kun Pengzi. Furthermore, even though it was a sneak attack, weren’t you the ones to kill more of them? Also, it won’t be long before we get our vengeance. When the time comes, just kill them all for me,” said Long Chen.

“Boss, how much longer until that vengeance? We can’t wait.”

“Even if you can’t wait, you have to. Go and rest, but don’t slack off. These people have crap for brains. We can’t expect them to act like normal people, so we have to be prepared for another battle at any moment,” said Long Chen.

“Yes.”

The Dragonblood warriors went back to rest, with only a portion standing guard and patrolling.

Meng Qi came over, looking pale. The destruction of the original true feather during that battle had shaken her Yuan Spirit, so Long Chen told her to rest.

After that, Long Chen and Mo Nian found a place to sit. Looking at the ruined battlefield, they both sighed at the same time.

“What are you sighing about?” asked Long Chen.

“I’m sighing because I couldn’t kill Kun Pengzi. If I had been at my peak, perhaps I could have gotten rid of him and have my name shake the continent,” said Mo Nian regretfully.

Kun Pengzi was a true heir of an Emperor, with that Emperor’s blood flowing in his veins. His bloodline was the strongest amongst the Xuan Beasts. If he was killed, that would truly be a heaven-shaking affair.

Mo Nian took out a new set of robes from a spatial ring. “Back in the day, we met during a battle between the Righteous and Corrupt paths. I remember that fellow was called Yin Luo, right? We were still so weak back then. But by working together, we cut off his leg. Now we’re stronger, but working together, we weren’t even able to cut off a leg from Kun Pengzi. Actually, I don’t want to make extravagant demands. Just one of his wings would have been good.”

Thinking of Yin Luo, Long Chen smiled. That fellow had truly been miserable.

The first time, he and Mo Nian had joined hands, managing to cut off Yin Luo’s leg. Then it was his arm, and the last time, Long Chen cut off half his body. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

However, Yin Luo didn’t die to Long Chen’s hand in the end. Due to his consecutive defeats, he was consumed by a heart-devil, and while attempting to break through to a higher realm, he lost his life to the heart-devil.

“It’s not that we’re weak but that Kun Pengzi is too strong. He had a powerful daddy, someone who could challenge a Sovereign. But our dads just swatted our bottoms when we did something bad. There’s no way of comparing.” Long Chen shook his head. He picked up a handful of sand and watched it flow between his fingers.

Mo Nian sighed. Disregarding his new clothes, he lazily lay on the ground, looking up at the sky. “This is an era of competing with foundations and daddies. I’m at least better than you; my ancestors left me the Five Element Sun Hunting Bow. But you didn’t get anything. The Five Element Sun Hunting Bow’s final seal hasn’t been undone, or I’d have been able to kill him.” But after saying that, Mo Nian became vexed. “However, that Kun Pengzi’s manifestation isn’t fully awakened, nor did he fully activate that halberd. He’ll definitely also be stronger by the time I fully release the Five Element Sun Hunting Bow. It’s unknown if I’ll be able to kill him then. Fuck.” Mo Nian slammed the ground with a fist.

Long Chen stretched and also lay on the ground. He didn’t say anything.

“Hey, what are you thinking about?” asked Mo Nian.

“What can I be thinking about? When the time comes, I’ll settle my debts with them.” Long Chen used his hands as a pillow and closed his eyes.

“You don’t have any cultivation base advantage or any divine item that you can use. What are you going to use to make them pay their debts?” demanded Mo Nian.

He really did admire Long Chen. To be able to fight against Kun Pengzi without a divine item was impressive.

If Mo Nian hadn’t had the Five Element Sun Hunting Bow, he would have been forced to run from Kun Pengzi. No, he probably wouldn’t even be able to run away.

“I can sense Evilmoon is about to awaken. To tell the truth, I’m really depressed about it. I have such a powerful divine item in my hands, but all I can do is hack with it like it’s a normal saber. Every time I clash with divine energy from divine items, I end up at a disadvantage. Once Evilmoon wakes up though, I’ll show them why flowers are red.” Long Chen smiled.

“Give it up. By the time Evilmoon awakens, their divine items might have awakened as well. Then you’d still be at a disadvantage,” said Mo Nian.

These experts from the ancient era all had trump cards. They were making preparations for the qi flow eruption.

“I’m not in the habit of losing over and over again. Losing once is enough,” said Long Chen.

His trump cards didn’t stop at Evilmoon. What he was lacking was just a bit of time.

“Fine. I’m going back to Mo Gate’s ancestral land. I need to see my fiancee and give her the Heavenly Dao Fruit that you gave me. I feel like although she’s fierce, she truly does care for me.” Mo Nian stood, patting some dust off his pants.

“You still haven’t given it to her?” Long Chen was startled. He had given Mo Nian that Heavenly Dao Fruit a while ago.

“It’s not easy for me to go back as I don’t want to expose the location. But I have no other choice this time. I have to awaken my Spirit Blood. I’ll be back soon. Hopefully, I can kill at least one of them before they awaken. Bye.” Mo Nian left.

“Boss, brother Wenlong has arrived.”

Mo Nian had just left when a Dragonblood warrior rushed over. Hearing that Zheng Wenlong had come to him, Long Chen immediately thought of a certain matter. His heart raced as he rushed over.
