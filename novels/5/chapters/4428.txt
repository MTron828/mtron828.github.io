Chapter 4417 Ye Xue

“That is… we don’t dare to ask for such a thing. Our enemies will not let things rest as they are. Besides, the High Firmament Academy is the main target of the various worlds. If we go there, it will give them the perfect excuse to launch an attack on the High Firmament Academy,” said Ye Ling.

The High Firmament Academy stood at the peak of the world before the Esoteric Spirit World was sealed. Obtaining their protection was something she could only dream of.

However, the High Firmament Academy had fallen from its glory; it was no longer the venerable institution of the past. The once shining beacon of the human race had lost its brilliance.

As a result, experts of various worlds harbored intentions of destroying the academy, an act equivalent to shattering the human race’s final hope. It would deal the most devastating blow imaginable to the human race.

Currently, they were still unable to figure out the truth about the High Firmament Academy, so they didn’t dare to make any rash moves.

However, if the Earth Spirit race were to seek asylum in the High Firmament Academy, the other two major powers of the Esoteric Spirit World would use this excuse to launch an attack and test the current state of the High Firmament Academy.

All the major factions were still eyeing the High Firmament Academy, eager to discern what was genuine and what was not. They were like hyenas surrounding their prey.

Due to this reason, even though the Earth Spirit race faced the imminent threat of destruction, Ye Ling was unwilling to bring a calamity to the High Firmament Academy. The Earth Spirit race held onto its integrity and would prefer extinction over endangering others in such a manner.

Hearing this, Long Chen simply smiled. “We really hope that they’ll use this excuse to attack.”

This smile caught Ye Ling off-guard, so she stared at Long Chen in confusion.

Long Chen continued, “Race leader Ye Ling, since I dare to offer such an invitation to you, I am confident we can handle them all. Please don’t worry about it.”

Ye Ling was moved. “But you’re just a disciple of the academy. This matter should be discussed with your higher-ups. Otherwise, something awkward might occur.”

Seeing Long Chen’s young age, Ye Ling naturally thought that Long Chen was just a disciple of the academy. Even if he were the academy’s most outstanding disciple, he wouldn’t have the authority to make such decisions.

What if she led her people to the academy only to be halted at the entrance? Perhaps the Earth Spirit race had indeed declined, but they had their own pride. They wouldn't stoop to begging outside for favors.

That was one concern, but her biggest worry was that if Long Chen’s higher-ups didn’t give him face, Long Chen might do something unthinkable in his fury. In such a scenario, she wouldn't know what to do.

Although she had just met Long Chen, she could see that he was someone who kept his word. If he was forced to take back a promise, he might resort to extreme measures.

Little Crane came running over, seemingly tired of running around and playing. Catching the tail end of their conversation, she promptly interjected, “Big sister, my big brother isn’t a disciple. He is the youngest branch dean in the history of the High Firmament Academy.”

Little Crane’s face was still rosy from running around. However, she was extremely happy after playing so much. When she told Ye Ling about Long Chen’s status, her face flushed with pride.

“You… you are a dean of the High Firmament Academy?” Ye Ling was stunned.

“I’m ashamed to fill this spot with my meager abilities. It’s only temporary,” said Long Chen with a smile.

“Please be at ease. I wouldn’t invite the Earth Spirit race to come if I didn’t have the authority. Although I am young, I suppose I could also count as meticulous. I’m sure I’ve taken everything you are worried about into consideration. So please, race leader Ye Ling, you don’t need to have any misgivings over this.”

Hearing this, Ye Ling was filled with gratitude. This was what it meant to send charcoal in snowy weather. At their critical moment, Long Chen’s helping hand was far too important for the Earth Spirit race.

Ye Ling was about to thank him again, but she suddenly thought that she had said her thanks so many times today that it was getting tedious. Let alone someone like Long Chen who didn’t like formalities, even she was getting tired of it.

She immediately agreed to go to the High Firmament Academy. She then gathered all the experts of the Earth Spirit race and told them her decision.

When they heard that Long Chen was a dean of the High Firmament Academy, they were startled and delighted. The High Firmament Academy was lending them a helping hand? Finally, they could see the light at the end of the tunnel.Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

Little Crane was particularly delighted that everyone would go to the High Firmament Academy with them. That meant that she would have more playmates.

However, before going to the High Firmament Academy, they had to gather all the Earth Spirit race’s members that had been scattered around the place when they fled.

Back then, they couldn’t do anything but scatter in every direction, which resulted in them being easily picked off one by one. Now that the danger had passed, they had to quickly gather once more.

Fortunately, as the race leader, Ye Ling had a special ability to call her people. Many experts of the Earth Spirit race quickly gathered here. The Earth Spirit race constituted a vast community, and their joint characteristic was that they were all born from the earth.

Ye Ling was originally a Nine Leaf Immortal Grass. As for Bally’s Earth Mound race, to put it in human terms, they were essentially… potatoes.

The origins of the Spirit race remained shrouded in mystery. Nevertheless, according to legends, during the primal chaos era, the Heavenly Daos gathered all the kindness of the world's spirits into one, sowing the seed of kindness.

Just like that, primitive lifeforms with pure kindness in their hearts all grew sentient, liberating themselves from the constraints of their mortal forms. They then condensed their spirituality, becoming the embodiments of goodness. Taking on human form, they cultivated the Heavenly Daos, comprehended the myriad laws, traversed the sea of bitterness, and existed above the other lifeforms in the world.

Therefore, the Spirit race was an extremely special existence. They existed throughout all of the nine heavens and ten lands. However, the most prevalent form among them was the spirit plant Spirit race.

Spiritual plant lifeforms were part of the Spirit race if they were kind. Conversely, they were considered demons if their nature leaned toward malevolent, as seen in demonic trees and flowers, some proving even more ruthless than devil and demonic beasts.

To sum it up, the defining criterion for identifying the Spirit race was their kindness, not their breed or bloodline.

Hence, seeing all the Earth Spirit race’s experts, Long Chen’s eyes were opened to the world. He saw many lifeforms with strange forms, making Bally's appearance seem comparatively ordinary. Among these lifeforms, several were notably feeble despite possessing relatively high cultivation bases; their actual combat prowess was severely lacking.

For example, someone like Bally had the cultivation base of a Heaven Venerate, but it didn’t have any powerful attacks. All of its power lay in fleeing.

With the increasing presence of experts from the Earth Spirit race, a growing number of women emerged among them. These flower-type lifeforms, while lacking combat power, possessed exceptional healing abilities. They immediately started helping their people recover.

After seven days, millions of their people had gathered. However, Ye Ling’s expression grew increasingly solemn instead.

“Race leader Ye Ling, what troubles you?” asked Long Chen finally.

“My only disciple. I haven’t received word from her this entire time, so I’m worried about her,” said Ye Ling nervously. “I thought that I would be doomed, so I told her to leave me. That would leave behind a seed for the Earth Spirit race. But now…”

Long Chen was instantly speechless. Why hadn't Ye Ling mentioned this earlier? According to her, her disciple was extremely powerful. Theoretically, she should have been the first to respond to her call.

It had been seven days, so who knew what could have happened to her? However, complaining was useless, so Long Chen quickly thought about the possibilities.

“Do you have a secret art to determine her general location?”

“Yes, but I would need to be within a certain range from her,” replied Ye Ling.

“It's concerning that she hasn't appeared after all this time. Something must have happened, and we must save her as soon as possible. Race leader Ye Ling, come with me.”

The next moment, Long Chen summoned a flame girl and a lightning girl—Huo Linger and Lei Linger.

“Can both of you protect everyone for me? If anyone dares to get close to the Earth Spirit race, kill them,” instructed Long Chen.

“Big Brother Long Chen, don’t worry. Leave this place to us!” promised Huo Linger.

Long Chen nodded and told Little Crane to patiently wait here. Long Chen then summoned his Kunpeng wings and flew off with Ye Ling.

Arriving at an ancient city, Long Chen directly kicked away the lifeform guarding the transportation formation and activated it.

After seven transportations, Ye Ling suddenly cried out, “I can sense Ye Xue’s position!”

When Ye Ling pointed in a certain direction, Long Chen directly flew off. However, as he saw a sprawl of extravagant new buildings, he was startled. He was actually very familiar with this place.

BOOM!

Long Chen shattered the gate with a kick, and the experts guarding it were sent tumbling away, not knowing what was going on.

“Idiots of the Long clan, hand over Ye Xue! Otherwise, I will slaughter you all to the last!”

Long Chen’s shout resounded throughout every corner of the Long clan.
