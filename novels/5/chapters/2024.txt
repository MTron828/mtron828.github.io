“What?”

The disciples couldn’t believe their ears.

“What, you don’t understand? I’m robbing you. Now do you get it? My pocket’s been embarrassingly empty lately, so I need some side business to make up for it. After all, I have a big family and so many people to feed. It’s hard on me. I have no other choice, so I have to do this work to get some money,” said Long Chen with an evil chuckle.

“Long Chen, for better or worse, you are a peerless heavenly genius. How can you do such shameless business?” raged an ancient race expert.

“Me, shameless? You have yet to see me when I’m shameless. Either hand over the money, or scram.” Long Chen swung Evilmoon, unleashing a powerful gust.

“Bastard, you’re going too far! You actually want to rob us? Everyone, kill him!” roared one of the Xuan Beasts, taking the lead in charging forward.

However, before he could even charge out of the channel, he was slain with a simple slash of Long Chen’s saber. Even his Yuan Spirit didn’t escape.

The other experts’ expressions changed. They found that their power was severely limited within the channel.

“This spatial channel has its own laws. To prevent it from being broken, it suppresses Heavenly Dao energy. In other words, you are unable to absorb Heavenly Dao energy to support your attacks inside. You’ll have to accept the fact that even ten thousand of you together wouldn’t be able to get past me. Hehe, so you should be obedient. I’m not too evil. I’ll only take ten million spirit crystals as my toll,” said Long Chen.

“Ten million?! Why don’t you go rob someone for that amount!”

“Exactly, I’m robbing you right now. Let me put it clearly: if you don’t pay up, don’t even think of entering. The Brahma secret realm will only be open for a set amount of time. Once time’s up, it will close. As for me, I have plenty of time, so I can wait it out.” Long Chen took out a chair and sat at the exit of the channel. He stabbed Evilmoon into the ground beside him.

Those experts were infuriated. They were being robbed? Something like being robbed existed only in stories for them. Every one of them was a powerful Empyrean. Anywhere they went, they were treated with great reverence. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

“Bastard, we won’t let you do as you please! We have money, but we’re not giving it to you!” roared one of the ancient race disciples.

“Up to you. In any case, I’m only here for a look. I can’t enter the core region. There’s nothing for me to fear. If you want to wait, I’ll wait.” Long Chen’s lazy appearance infuriated those experts even more.

More and more experts appeared within the channel, with the people at the back not knowing what was going on. Two experts were forced out of the channel by the pushing, but when Long Chen raised Evilmoon, the two of them immediately cried out in terror and fled back inside.

As the news spread to the back, an uproar erupted. They immediately reported this matter to Pill Valley.

When Pill Valley’s people heard this, they couldn’t believe their ears. Long Chen was actually forcing people to pay a fee to enter their Brahma secret realm? Had he gone crazy from poverty? Just how did his head work?

“Long Chen, can you have the slightest sense of shame? What do you mean by this path was opened by you, these trees were planted by you? This is Pill Valley’s secret realm. It has nothing to do with you!”

“Hmph, when I passed through here, I kicked away a stone that opened the path,” sneered Long Chen.

“Then what about planting trees?”

“I just planted some seeds and pissed on them so they can grow up healthy. They’ll be shooting out of the ground in just a few years. If you don’t believe me, you can come and take a look in a few years.”

“Long Chen, have some shame!”

“This is just reality. When I treat you reasonably, you act shamelessly to me. When I act shameless, you act like some saints. It doesn’t matter. In any case, if you want to pass, you have to pay up. However, the money you pay isn’t just for using my path. It also comes with some protection,” said Long Chen.

“What are you talking about?”

“Having taken your money, I would be embarrassed to take the initiative to attack you. So for the rest of the Brahma secret realm, as long as you don’t attack me, I won’t view you as enemies. After all, how could I treat my customers so badly?” said Long Chen.

Hearing that, people were enticed. If they paid this money, they wouldn’t need to worry about Long Chen attacking them. That would remove the greatest threat.

“But ten million is too much. My sect has a dozen people,” said one person.

Long Chen looked at him and found that he was from a neutral power. “Neutral disciples can get a discount. You only have to pay a million.”

The neutral experts were delighted by this. As supreme experts, they definitely had the ability to pay ten million spirit crystals, but that still was a painful price. On the other hand, a million wasn’t that much.

“I’ll pay.” One of the neutral camp’s experts suddenly walked forward.

“Bastard, can’t you have some backbone?!”

As soon as that person stepped forward, he received a torrent of curses, mostly from the ancient races, Xuan Beasts, and the Corrupt path.

Long Chen might be giving a discount to the neutral experts but not them. This first person paying up would only start a chain reaction.

As if he didn’t hear the cursing, the man walked over to Long Chen and handed over a spatial ring. Long Chen saw a neat million spirit crystals inside.

“Hehe, thanks boss.”

Long Chen accepted the money with a bright smile. He used what he had learned from the Huayun Sect, maintaining a grateful attitude to anyone who gave him money.

The man was startled by that attitude. He laughed, “To be called boss by the number one expert of the junior generation, these spirit crystals weren’t wasted.”

“If you like it, how about I call you boss twice for another million?” said Long Chen.

How was Long Chen a supreme expert? He seemed more like a money-grubber. Some people even wondered if this person was really Long Chen. It couldn’t be that he was a fake, right?

The man shook his head and flew away. This place was the Brahma secret realm. Each moment wasted was an opportunity or lucky encounter that he might lose out on.

The experts still in the channel were no longer able to hold back. Some people had already entered the Brahma secret realm before them and were searching for the priceless treasures that they wanted to obtain. They couldn’t wait.

Another expert stepped forward and handed over a spatial ring to Long Chen before leaving. Then more and more people came forward, holding back their anger.

“Haha, many thanks. I wish you all good fortune in the Brahma secret realm!”

Long Chen happily accepted all their money, looking infatuated with his newfound wealth. The image of a supreme and vicious expert was wiped away from people’s minds.

“Hold it, come one by one. Hey, little fellow, who do you think you are? You’re from the ancient family alliance!”

Long Chen suddenly grabbed one of them. That person was no longer wearing robes of the ancient family alliance. Disguising himself as someone from the neutral camp, he had tried to save some money.

“Then I’ll make up the nine million.” Being exposed, that person could only suppress his anger and hand over more money.

“Make up for it? Are you trying to dupe me? The cost of trying to fool me is ten times the original price. I won’t take the original toll. Just hand over your punishment fee.” Long Chen’s expression darkened. The way his amicable air transformed was faster than the turning of a page.

“You...”

Evilmoon suddenly swung up and pressed against that person’s neck. His hair stood on end as a sensation of death enveloped him.

Only now did people confirm that this was the true Long Chen, not some random bandit.

“Are you paying or not?” demanded Long Chen frostily.

“I’ll pay, I’ll pay!” However, that man then said, “But I don’t have so many spirit crystals.”

“If you don’t have the money, you can pay with treasures. If you have no treasures, then you can pay with your life. Up to you. My tiny little business can’t accept IOUs.” Long Chen made Evilmoon twitch, causing that person to jump in terror.

In the end, he handed over seven million spirit crystals, as well as a half-step divine item to make up for the remaining spirit crystals.

After accepting his money, Long Chen’s bright smile instantly reappeared. “Many thanks, boss. Hopefully, I can encounter some more good clients like you.”

Hearing that, some other experts that had already disguised themselves as being from the neutral camp quietly took off their disguises.

“Big brother, here is my money!”

Suddenly, a woman came out of the crowd and handed over a spatial ring to Long Chen.

It was a young lady who only looked to be sixteen years old. She possessed a strange charm to her. Her skin was pale white and her eyes were large. There was a nine-tailed mark on her forehead.

This was someone from the ancient races’ Nine Tail Demon Fox race. The Nine Tail Demon Fox had vanished from the Xuan Beasts, but some of their bloodlines still flowed amongst the ancient races.

The Nine Tail Demon Fox’s combat power wasn’t the greatest, their fame lay in the overwhelming beauty of their people. Both their men and women possessed a natural charm that was difficult to resist.

Rumor was that their bewitching arts were incredible, but as for how incredible they were or how they were used, no one knew.

Now, this woman with the mark of the Nine Tail Demon Fox came shyly to Long Chen. She didn’t know whether to toss the spatial ring to Long Chen or hand it to him directly.

“What amazing bewitching arts!” exclaimed Long Chen suddenly.
