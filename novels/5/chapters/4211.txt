Chapter 4200 Martial Stage Staircase

Amidst a deafening rumble, the immense martial stage ascended from the earth. Its ascent exerted tremendous force, compressing and distorting the entire prefecture, ultimately forming a ring encircling the martial stage.

The martial stage was enormous, nearly matching the size of the original Sage King Prefecture. Meanwhile, the outer region of the prefecture had become a circular viewing platform.

When the primal chaos qi gushed forth, immortal mist covered the entire prefecture. With every breath, the people around experienced a profound sense of relaxation and rejuvenation in their bodies.

“Legend has it that every time the Sage King Convention appears, it will bring new changes to the world. Every Sage King will receive the concentration of karmic luck from the ten thousand Daos, becoming the king of the entire world!” exclaimed someone excitedly.

To be able to bear witness to such an event was already an immense blessing, so everyone was excited.

The various heavenly geniuses also grew restless. Meanwhile, the senior generation could only watch and sigh at the fact that they were born too early. They were not qualified to attend this Sage King Convention.

Countless young disciples, on the other hand, were staring at the martial stage, their blood boiling. This martial stage belonged to them.

The disciples of the High Firmament Academy quickly gathered on the edge of the martial stage. On the plaza, the palace master stood composed, looking at the martial stage calmly.

Behind the palace master, Bai Zhantang and the other vice palace master assembled, and further behind them stood Bai Shishi’s mother, Bai Xiaole’s mother, and a group of experts wearing the Battle God Palace’s robes.

Hundreds of thousands of disciples had gathered in the plaza. But when Bai Shishi, Bai Xiaole, and the others looked around, they didn’t spot Long Chen.

“What is your boss doing? Why isn’t he here?” demanded Bai Shishi.

“We don’t know either!”

Guo Ran and Xia Chen were also panicking. Although they knew that the activation of the martial stage would take some time, not seeing their boss at this time worried them.

The Dragonblood warriors were also anxious. Many of them had not seen Long Chen since the Martial Heaven Continent, so they wanted to see him more than anyone.

“And where is Qingxuan?” asked Bai Shishi.

“Uh… I don’t know.” Guo Ran felt even more awkward now. His guess was that their boss had gone to get Yu Qingxuan, but he didn’t dare to say it to Bai Shishi.

“When we left the Starry River Sect, Big Sister Qingxuan was still in seclusion. We don’t know the exact details,” said a Dragonblood warrior.

Although Long Chen had told them all to go to the High Firmament Academy, as Yu Qingxuan had been in a critical state in her seclusion, they hadn’t dared to disturb her.

“Oh, Big Sister Qingxuan, you’re here!”

Guo Ran suddenly called out, and everyone followed his gaze to see the white-robed Yu Qingxuan walking over.

Seeing Yu Qingxuan, Bai Shishi tensed slightly and cupped her fists to her. “Junior Sister Bai Shishi greets Big Sister Qingxuan.”

While breaking through the bottleneck of Pill Dao, Yu Qingxuan was unaware of the unfolding events. Thus, when she came out, she was surprised to find that Long Chen and the others had gone. Regrettably, when she left the Starry River Sect, the High Firmament Palace had also disappeared.Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

Yu Qingxuan hastily returned the greeting. “Big Sister Shishi is too courteous. Ever since our meeting in the three thousand worlds, I’ve been missing you. Now that we meet again, I can see that big sister is shining more brightly than ever. No wonder that Long Chen is always thinking of you.”

Bai Shishi blushed slightly. As for this shine, Yu Qingxuan seemed to be referring to how Long Chen was accompanying her.

However, this response did make Bai Shishi happy. When it came to these feelings, Bai Shishi was extremely pure and inexperienced, so she believed anything that Yu Qingxuan said.

Up ahead, Bai Zhantang and his wives couldn’t help but stealthily glance back.

Seeing Bai Shishi’s blush, Bai Zhantang instantly muttered, “She’s normally so strong, but at this critical time, she gets scared. She’s at a disadvantage right at the start. Since when did my beloved daughter call herself a junior?”

Bai Zhantang could see that Bai Shishi wasn’t a match for her opponent. She was completely red after a single exchange, causing Bai Zhantang to feel particularly depressed.

“And what’s wrong with that?” The face of Bai Shishi’s mother instantly turned cold, and she viciously pinched Bai Zhantang’s waist.

As a result, Bai Zhantang’s body directly straightened, the pain making him clench his teeth. These words of his had not just offended Bai Shishi’s mother but also his other wife.

That was because, between the two of them, there was no senior or junior. It was only because Bai Shishi’s mother was two years older than Bai Xiaole’s mother that the latter called her big sister. It had nothing to do with who was the first wife and who was second.

However, Bai Zhantang must have a death wish. Seeing his own daughter call herself a junior irritated him. If he had just muttered it to himself, it would have been no problem, but saying it out loud in front of his wives was just asking for it.

Bai Zhantang also realized that he had misspoken. Looking at their enraged gazes, he hastily admitted defeat, gesturing to them to calm down as everyone was looking.

This disturbance had drawn the gazes of those around them. Even the palace master couldn’t help but turn back to look at him. However, the palace master didn’t say anything and just turned away.

“It’s fine, keep going. We didn’t see anything.” The other vice palace master smiled slightly and also turned away.

The others then turned away with odd expressions as well, acting like they hadn’t seen anything.

Bai Zhantang felt betrayed. These fellows were normally his life-and-death brothers, but at this moment, no one helped speak up for him.

“Let me make this clear, Shishi is my beloved daughter, and she has the right to pursue her own happiness. Don’t cause trouble, or I won’t forgive you,” warned Bai Shishi’s mother.

Bai Zhantang immediately nodded like a chicken pecking for corn, and only then did his wives let him off. Further behind them, Bai Shishi was now holding hands and chatting with Yu Qingxuan, smiling.

Seeing that smile, her mother sighed with relief. Considering how prideful and aloof Bai Shishi normally was, she actually didn’t have a single good friend by her side.

Only Bai Shishi’s mother understood the loneliness her daughter concealed beneath her tough exterior. Hence, while she was uncertain about what the future held, at this moment, she was content to see her daughter smiling so genuinely.

“Big Sister Shishi, where is Long Chen?” asked Yu Qingxuan eventually.

In truth, Yu Qingxuan had wanted to ask this question ever since her arrival, but she had refrained from asking too abruptly, not wanting to offend Bai Shishi. Thus, she had patiently waited until this moment to ask.

Bai Shishi, taken aback, responded, “Shouldn’t Long Chen have been with you?”

Just then, the martial stage quivered, and giant staircases appeared on its edges, one being quite close to the High Firmament Academy’s side. As soon as those staircases appeared, countless disciples flocked toward them.
