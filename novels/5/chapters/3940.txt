Chapter 3929 Out of the Tiger’s Mouth, Into the Wolf’s Throat

BOOM!

With a heaven-shaking explosion, Long Chen’s hand broke and his arm turned numb. He grunted as his insides flipped inside of him.

“Enpuda!”

This attack had come completely silently, and Long Chen had only blocked it thanks to his instincts. After blocking it, Enpuda’s face instantly appeared in his mind.

At this moment, sand and rubble were flying about, while the sun and moon had lost their light. Long Chen suddenly realized that this place was undergoing an immense battle.

Long Chen was blown back by Enpuda’s dagger. He didn’t even see Enpuda’s figure, but a deathly aura locked onto him at this time.

With a roar, Long Chen’s saber danced. He unleashed thirty-six slashes, and thirty-six explosive sounds rang out so close together that it sounded like a single sound.

Long Chen was shocked. Enpuda’s attacks came too quickly, so quickly that Long Chen couldn’t even see them. Long Chen was relying entirely on his instincts to block the attacks.

It was like he was blind, not knowing where his opponent was. He could only rely on his sense of danger to randomly attack.

This was Long Chen’s first time having a true fight with Enpuda, and only now did he understand just how terrifying Enpuda was. The Enpuda that Long Chen had seen and fought before was an act. Today, he had given up the act and was truly intent on killing Long Chen.

Under this wild storm of attacks, Long Chen didn’t even have a chance to summon his battle armor. He could only block as best as he could without making any mistakes.

BOOM!

Suddenly, a saber tore through the heavens, and the void exploded. Enpuda’s pudgy figure finally appeared.

It was Xia Guhong who had forced him out. Three three-colored divine flowers were revolving behind Xia Guhong. Wielding a saber, Xia Guhong was like a supreme god.

“Damn fatty, you dare to sneak attack me?!”

Just as Xia Guhong forced out Enpuda, the infuriated Long Chen landed a slap on his fat face. As a result, Enpuda’s body rolled into the distance.

Long Chen was shocked by Enpuda’s power. He had been pressed to the limit by Enpuda’s unending stream of attacks. If it weren’t for Xia Guhong, he would have died.

Suddenly, the space all around Long Chen exploded and countless experts appeared. Long Chen instantly spotted Weng Taibei, the Kunpeng race’s ancestor, the monsters from the devil race, and others.

Those old fellows also had three divine flowers behind them. As the flowers revolved, they seemed to be one with the heavens. Their terrifying auras then crashed down on Long Chen, making him feel his body would explode.

“Long Chen, you little brute! Return Luocha’s life!”

When Liao Bencang let out a roar, faith energy erupted around him. He also had three divine flowers behind him, but his flowers were only one color. Meanwhile, Xia Guhong and the others had three colors.

“If you want to kill my brother, you’ll have to see if I, Xia Guhong, assent first!”

Xia Guhong snorted and slashed his saber. No matter how Liao Bencang tried to get past him with some tricky movement art, he was accurately struck and forced back.

BOOM!

Liao Bencang was sent flying. In front of Xia Guhong, he still wasn’t strong enough.

A Kunpeng then spread its wings that covered the heavens. As that enormous figure opened its mouth, divine light shot out.

The Kunpeng race’s ancestor was unleashing its innate divine ability. When that divine light appeared, even Long Chen was locked down by its power.

Long Chen’s soul felt like it was going to be torn apart. He was shocked to find that even a simple lock was almost unbearable for him. Such an attack was enough to kill him millions of times over.

However, in front of this divine ability, Xia Guhong smiled coldly. He held his saber with both hands, one on the hilt and one on the blade itself. He was using the saber’s blade to receive this terrifying ray of divine light.

BOOM!

The divine light fell on Xia Guhong. But at this moment, a divine mark lit up on Xia Guhong’s saber, taking the form of a sparrow with a dragon head. When this mark lit up, the Kunpeng ancestor’s attack directly shattered.

Fragments of divine light then shot through the air like sharp swords, blowing apart the clouds and piercing rocks. As a result, the city below crumbled. These buildings which had endured the passing of countless years without falling were unable to resist these fragments of divine light.𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

“Die!”

Suddenly, the four elders of the Alldevil race roared. Almighty devil qi erupted as they joined the fray.

“Back then, I made you flee for your lives. Today, I can do the same.” Xia Guhong swept out his saber, and the dragon sparrow mark once more lit up.

With an explosive sound, Xia Guhong was forced back a few steps, while those four old monsters of the Alldevil race were sent flying like shooting stars. Even one against four, Xia Guhong was unmatched.

“Even if you all come together, so what? Let’s see who will live to walk out of the Violet Flame Heaven Capital.”

Xia Guhong’s saber rumbled. Standing in the air, he seemed like the celestial emperor that stood above the mortal world, possessing an unspeakable domineeringness and calm.

At this moment, Long Chen realized that they had been fighting for a while. They probably realized that their disciples had died and wanted to kill Long Chen, so Xia Guhong was naturally fighting them off.

“Long Chen, you brute, return my Wild Blade and Heavenly Lightning Tower, or I’ll make you beg for death!”

Weng Taibei glared at Long Chen furiously, his eyes scarlet. Those were the national treasures of the Violet Thunderclap Empire, but they had actually fallen into Long Chen’s hands.

“Not just those weapons! Hand over my source runes as well!” In the distance, Weng Tianyao was glaring at Long Chen, his eyes full of rancor.

“Lei Linger, you didn’t kill him?” Long Chen was surprised.

Lei Linger apologetically said, “I’m sorry big brother Long Chen. I felt pity for him, so I didn’t kill him.”

Lei Linger had taken Weng Tianyao’s lightning sword and lightning tower. After that, she even absorbed his source runes, leaving him essentially half-crippled. In the end, she didn’t give him the killing blow and let him go.

Long Chen smiled. “Not bad, not bad. You have your own feelings now and have the power to judge right and wrong for yourself. You no longer act only in accordance with my will. That’s great. I’m very proud of you.”

Seeing Long Chen not blame her and actually praise her, Lei Linger was relieved. It went without saying that a half-dead Weng Tianyao meant nothing to Long Chen. But on the other hand, the fact that Lei Linger could now think for herself made him very happy. She had grown.

Wanting to take things from Long Chen’s hands? They had to be dreaming. Long Chen completely ignored Weng Taibei and Weng Tianyao. His disdainful expression was all the reply that they needed.

This expression enraged all of them because their descendants or disciples had been killed or dealt grievous blows by Long Chen.

“Xia Guhong, I, Weng Taibei, am going to kill this little brute! Let’s see if you can actually stop me!” Weng Taibei let out a roar. A lightning spear appeared in his hand, thundering clearly.

Looking at his ferocious appearance, Long Chen stealthily asked the dragon expert, “Senior, if they all attack me, can I use the bronze cauldron to kill them? I don’t like how arrogant they’re acting.”
