Chapter 2150 Jian Wuchen’s Origins

The End of the Heavens Valley. It was a land of death where nothing grew, and it was all hard stone with countless cuts and scars.

These scars were left behind by the various experts that had fought here. Their remnant aura made it so no vegetation could grow here.

Let alone vegetation, no insects or beasts would dare to get near here. They would be slain by the broken remnant laws.

When Long Chen arrived, he saw a sea of people had gathered around the valley. Experts from various sects and powers had surrounded this place.

Clearly, news of Jian Wuchen’s challenge of Yue Zifeng had spread throughout the continent. A match between peerless sword cultivators wasn’t a show that anyone wanted to miss.

Startled cries rang out when Long Chen’s golden flying boat appeared. “Long Chen’s come!”

“Yue Zifeng is the fourth captain of the Dragonblood Legion. I wonder if Long Chen will make a move when the time comes.”

“Unlikely. After all, Jian Yuchen is challenging Yue Zifeng. Unless Yue Zifeng doesn’t come, no one will have a valid reason for interfering in their battle.”

“Jiang Wuchen has never faced defeat. He’s a genius who dominated a generation. As for Yue Zifeng, he’s a brilliant genius, but he’s from the junior generation. He hasn’t reached the same level of prestige as Long Chen, so why would Jian Wuchen challenge Yue Zifeng? Isn’t that a case of bullying the weak?”

“That’s true. Yue Zifeng is just a captain of the Dragonblood Legion. Jian Wuchen’s challenge is a loss of status.”

“You’re all unaware. In truth, Yue Zifeng and Jian Wuchen are from the same sect.” An old man suddenly opened his mouth.

“What? How is that possible?”

“It’s true. Jian Wuchen was once a disciple of the Heavenly Sword Gate,” said the elder.

“If they’re from the same sect, why would they want to kill each other?”

“Because Jian Wuchen was expelled from the sect as a renegade.”

The elder’s words shocked everyone. Jian Wuchen was actually a disciple of the Heavenly Sword Gate? But then why were there no rumors about it?

“The Heavenly Sword Gate is rather isolated and rarely interacts with the rest of the continent, entirely immersing itself in the way of the sword. They only have a few disciples and experts, so people don’t know much about them. But it is a fact that Jian Wuchen was a disciple of the Heavenly Sword Gate. There is a historical record of it. However, as to why the Heavenly Sword Gate would expel such a genius from their sect, no one knows,” said the elder.

Hearing that, people came to their own guesses about why Jian Wuchen would challenge Yue Zifeng. Was it to humiliate the Heavenly Sword Gate? If that was the case, Jian Wuchen must feel quite the hatred for the Heavenly Sword Gate.

“Long Chen, over here.”

Long Chen’s flying boat had just arrived when someone called out to him. Long Chen turned to see the fiery-figured Beitang Rushuang.

Long Chen flew over and put the flying boat away. Before he could even open his mouth, Beitang Rushuang hatefully said, “Let me first warn you not to bring up anything romantic, or I’ll shoot you into a sieve.”

Long Chen laughed. It seems that those words of his truly possessed destructive power. He actually made Beitang Rushuang afraid of them.

“Long Chen, this Jian Wuchen is quite powerful. Do you feel like your subordinate can win?” asked Beitang Rushuang.

“Let’s make one thing clear first. Yue Zifeng isn’t my subordinate but my brother. As for whether or not he can win, I don’t know either. All I know is that Yue Zifeng’s comprehension of the Sword Dao is the most terrifying of everyone I’ve known. There shouldn’t be a problem,” said Long Chen. “Do you know how strong Jian Wuchen is?”

Beitang Rushuang told Long Chen about Jian Wuchen’s history. “Based on what I’ve heard, the reason Jian Wuchen was expelled is because he didn’t listen to his master’s orders. He secretly went into the Heavenly Sword Gate’s inheritance land and learned the Sword God Dao Canon.”

“Why would he do that? As long as he stayed within the Heavenly Sword Gate, wouldn’t he have learned it sooner or later?” asked Long Chen

“I don’t know. This information isn’t entirely solid,” said Beitang Rushuang. “Only the Heavenly Sword Gate would know the exact details. But what I heard was that he was still at the Xiantian realm when he was expelled. I don’t know if he encountered some miracle or if it was enlightenment from the Sword God Dao Canon, but his sword arts suddenly progressed explosively, allowing him to dominate his generation. In his era, he was an unrivaled existence. I heard he went to the Heavenly Sword Gate a second time, begging to be accepted, but the Heavenly Sword Gate locked their doors and refused to see him for three days and nights. It is said that in his fury, he swore to kill all the Heavenly Sword Gate’s disciples. As a result, the sect master of that time personally went out to kill him in response, but it’s unclear what happened afterward. Some say that Jian Wuchen was killed by the gate master, while others say that the gate master had mercy in the end and decided to accept him into the Heavenly Sword Gate. Either way, there are plenty of stories and no way to verify them. All that can be said is that after that, Jian Wuchen never reappeared in the world until now. I didn’t expect that he would also have been sealed. He has regained the arrogance of a sword cultivator and slain quite a few people.”

“It seems that this Jian Wuchen isn’t a good egg then?” muttered Long Chen. Someone who would betray his sect and then curse the sect that had given him everything he had was definitely garbage.

Although he didn’t know much about the Heavenly Sword Gate, he knew that Ling Yunzi had joined it, and that Yue Zifeng could be considered Ling Yunzi’s disciple, making him also a disciple of the Heavenly Sword Gate. With Long Chen’s understanding of Yue Zifeng, he knew that if Yue Zifeng didn’t feel any respect for the Heavenly Sword Gate, he wouldn’t have accepted going there.

“I’ve seen him before. He is incredibly arrogant. It’s irritating how he acts like everyone should be beneath his sword. If only I had a reason to, I really would want to test him.” Beitang Rushuang patted the bow on her back. Clearly, Jian Wuchen hadn’t left a good impression on her.

However, by patting the bow, waves appeared on her chest. Long Chen took the sight in. Beitang Rushuang wore skin-tight black leather armor which clung tightly to her skin. That made Long Chen swallow hard.

“Brat, you want to die, is that it? Where do you think you’re looking with your perverted eyes?” Beitang Rushuang clenched her fists and waved one of them beneath Long Chen’s nose menacingly.

“Miss Beitang, your body is really amazing. Do you have some kind of secret art you can teach my women?” Long Chen ignored Beitang Rushuang’s threat and praised her.

“You... you pervert.” Beitang Rushuang turned red. Long Chen was absolutely shameless, and he didn’t bother concealing it at all.

“Don’t curse others. This is innate. Praising a beauty for the truth is better than sweet-talking, right? Don’t be so stingy and share,” said Long Chen, shamelessly.

“Bastard, this is all natural!” raged Beitang Rushuang through clenched teeth.

Countless experts had secretly drooled over her, but no one had ever come up to her and asked her for advice on such a matter.

Fortunately, there wasn’t really any pervertedness in Long Chen’s eyes, or Beitang Rushuang might really bring out her bow and shoot holes through him.

“How regretful,” sighed Long Chen.

“Bastard, if you keep looking, I’ll tear your eyes out!” warned Beitang Rushuang.

Long Chen obediently pulled his gaze back. It was difficult because her body was extremely eye-catching.

Looking behind her, Long Chen saw dozens of young disciples from the Beitang family, all of them being awakened Empyreans. Although they concealed their auras, Long Chen could still sense a powerful pressure from them. They were all experts amongst experts.

However, most of them were men, and they were glaring at Long Chen coldly with a trace of hostility.

Long Chen realized that his teasing had been heard by them. It seemed that they were very dissatisfied with how he treated Beitang Rushuang.

On the other hand, the few women didn’t show any hostility. Instead, they seemed to be curious. Perhaps they couldn’t imagine how this sloppy fellow before them was the Long Chen that had shaken the entire continent.

“Have you been busy lately?” Beitang Rushuang relaxed slightly once Long Chen wasn’t looking at her so hotly.

“Me? I’m not busy. I’ve repented and mended my eyes. I’m no longer killing people. I read some books and drink some tea. A while ago, I suddenly had an impulse to go chat with a Sovereign about life,” said Long Chen.

The women behind Beitang Rushuang laughed, while the men looked at him disdainfully.

“You shouldn’t brag every time you open your mouth. Good friends don’t talk that way,” said Beitang Rushuang.

“What? I’m not bragging. It’s the truth. Fine, you don’t have to believe it,” said Long Chen indifferently.

“Can a person die from not bragging for a day? Tell me then, which Sovereign did you go find for a chat?” asked Beitang Rushuang.

“It was with-”

Suddenly, a ruckus occurred in the distance. Long Chen looked over, and his jaw dropped.

“Why would he come here?”
