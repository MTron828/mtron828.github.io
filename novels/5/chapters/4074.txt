Chapter 4063 Warrior of the Starry Sky

This was a large, long-haired man who was a whole head taller than Long Chen and extremely muscular. Also, his upper body’s scarlet, copper, and bronze-colored skin was covered in strange marks.

At this moment, he was standing within the barrier, his body bound by chains that connected him to the ship from below and above.

From what Long Chen could see, those chains had black qi swirling around them. It seemed that some energy was being slowly injected into his body.

Even from a great distance, Long Chen and the others could sense the terrifying primal chaos qi coming from this person's body. Even if Uncle Tree didn’t say anything, they would have been able to tell that he was from the primal chaos era.

However, the lifeform gave off no aura of life as though it was a corpse. But why would a corpse be bound with chains?

Just then, one of those strange lifeforms appeared in front of the barrier and slowly extended a hand. At this time, Long Chen finally saw what it was holding. It was a thumb-sized crystal.

The crystal then merged into the barrier and transformed into threads like a spiderweb that wrapped around the long-haired man.

When those black threads merged into his body, the chains on him quivered. Long Chen then saw strange fluctuations on top of the chains.

“It’s absorbing this person’s life energy?! He’s not dead?!” Long Chen was startled. This lifeform from the primal chaos era wasn’t dead? It still had life energy to absorb? That was too terrifying. A lifeform from the primal chaos era, was that not a true living fossil?

“It seems that these lifeforms and chains are absorbing his life energy so that he doesn’t wake up. Master, take a look. All of these lifeforms are walking like machines, using the black crystals to absorb his life energy. This expert from the primal chaos era has such astonishing life energy that they can only use this method to prevent him from awakening. It seems that this entire Ghost Ship is set up as a prison, and the only one in this prison is him,” deduced Uncle Tree gravely.

Long Chen nodded. “That seems to be the case. We just have no idea what kind of background this lifeform has. Should we save him or not? If he turns on us, we’ll have died to our own hands.”

Long Chen continued to examine the long-haired man. Although he was just silently standing there like a corpse, Long Chen could sense the apocalyptic power within his body.

Once he woke up, let alone him, even a Heaven Venerate would only be an ant in front of this existence.

From Uncle Tree’s expression, it seemed that this expert was many times stronger than him as well. They simply weren’t on the same level.

“Senior, senior, wake up. What is going on? What should I do?” Long Chen called out to the dragon expert with his soul.

However, the dragon expert didn’t reply. Even when Long Chen shouted several more times, he still got nothing. Just as Long Chen thought that he couldn’t reach the dragon expert, its voice suddenly rang out.

“A Warrior of the Starry Sky? You’ve actually encountered him?” The dragon expert’s voice was filled with a hint of astonishment.

“Warrior of the Starry Sky? That sounds a bit familiar. I feel like I’ve heard it before.” Long Chen felt like he had heard this name before, but he wasn’t able to recall where.

“Of course it’s familiar. Back in Pill Valley, that girl Wan Qing asked you about the origin of shooting stars, and you came up with some ridiculous story about you being an unrivaled Warrior of the Starry Sky who would give her shooting stars. You don’t remember your own cons?”

Long Chen was embarrassed. No wonder it sounded so familiar, so he had come up with that name himself. He hadn’t expected the random name he had tossed out to be a true existence.

To alleviate his embarrassment, Long Chen asked, “Senior, can he be saved? Should I save him?”

“You can save him, and he won’t attack you. The Ghost Sovereign is trying to turn this guy into his puppet. That is why he left him with the slightest trace of life. However, a Warrior of the Starry Sky possesses an extremely strong lifeforce. If his life energy was not being constantly kept in check, he would quickly awaken. That’s why they are using this barrier and crystals to bind him. They don’t want the flame of his life to extinguish, but they also don’t want him to awaken,” said the dragon expert.ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

Long Chen felt much more at ease after hearing that. After all, the enemy of his enemy was his friend. If the Ghost Sovereign wanted to do something, Long Chen should stop him whenever he could. Even if he couldn’t get anything good from it, he didn’t mind.

Normally, the core of something was located at the center or head. However, this Ghost Ship’s core was actually located at the tail.

There was a giant rudder here, which was sealed. But fortunately, Long Chen already had some experience. By inserting Spiritual Strength into it, it quickly reacted. Once he could control the rudder, he could guide the Ghost Ship wherever he wanted.

However, this time, Long Chen didn’t just want to control the direction but also the entire Ghost Ship.

Enduring the pain, he took off the eyepatch. As his left eye creaked open, a chilling scream nearly escaped his lips, despite his remarkable pain tolerance.

From deep within his eyes, the hell flower manifested once more, causing the rudder to quiver. At that moment, everything in the Ghost Ship appeared within Long Chen’s mind’s eye.

Grimacing in agony, Long Chen covered his left eye with a trembling hand. He could no longer see out of it. To use it repeatedly without it fully recovering was exacting a heavy toll on it.

After a moment, Long Chen wiped off the blood flowing out of his eye. Afraid that Yu Qingxuan would feel worried, he only returned after he was able to control his expression.

With this new information, he knew that this Ghost Ship had three levels. The Warrior of the Starry Sky was bound in the middle level, and the crystals were from a chest in the lower level.

Just like that, the puppets were constantly going from the lower level to the middle level, their movements robotic.

Originally, there was a barrier between the two levels. But with Long Chen’s new control over the Ghost Ship, this barrier had no effect on him. He then arrived at the chest of crystals and saw countless thumb-sized crystals here, all of them containing an immense amount of life energy.

Long Chen had no idea what use these things could have, so he simply tossed them into the primal chaos space. With that, the puppets just began to randomly rove around the chest since there were no crystals.

Having lost their purpose, those puppets were like idiots not knowing what to do.

After that, Long Chen had Xia Chen steer them, and they directly used this giant Ghost Ship to travel.

Long Chen and the others stood guard over the Warrior of the Starry Sky. On the seventh day, the latter’s hand quivered, exciting Long Chen and the others.
