Chapter 2414 Karmic Flames Burn the Heavens

Translator: BornToBe

Long Chen began to circulate the Nirvana Scripture. His face was serene. One note after another came out of his mouth.

As peace fell over the world, one rune after another appeared, filling the air around him like shooting stars. Those were runes condensed of the world’s flame energy.

With these flame runes in the air, it felt like it was night, with stars hanging in the sky.

Endless flame energy gathered here, forming a whirlpool of stars around Long Chen. As more and more of them appeared, Long Chen’s chanting grew louder. He went from the first volume of the Nirvana Scripture to the second volume.

As the world’s flame energy gathered around him, Long Chen managed to sense the karmic hell flames dancing within the ancient pagoda.

The karmic hell flames were responding to him. It was like by gathering all these flames, he had gathered a pack of hyenas against the lion king. It seemed that they felt provoked.

The karmic hell flames were attempting to charge out of Purgatory, but they were unable to break the seal.

“Last time I was only able to summon the karmic hell flames because Leng Yueyan had opened the path to Purgatory. But this time, I can rely on the karmic hell flames to come out on their own.” Long Chen took a deep breath. The chanting changed once more. The words he was chanting transformed into runes that merged into heaven and earth.

It was like gods were chanting, filling the world with an unspeakable divine might.

With the third volume of the Nirvana Scripture, the flame runes moved of their own accord, forming a pair of giant wings on Long Chen’s back.

Those flame runes were expressing absolute allegiance to Long Chen. They were willing to be used by Long Chen, willing to become a part of him.

Such a scenario had never occurred before. Although he had previously used the Nirvana Scripture to control the world’s flame energy, this time, the flame energy was becoming one with him of its own accord. Before this, he had been forcing the flame energy to be his, but now, the flame energy was willingly doing what he wanted. The two were completely different concepts.

The pagoda was shaking intensely. Long Chen could sense the karmic hell flames going crazy inside. It was like a king was being provoked.

Suddenly, a stream of flames came gushing out of the bottom of the pagoda, and a wave of heat ignited the world.

The karmic hell flames had finally broken out of their seal. Endless flames were charging out from underground. Wherever they went, the earth began to melt. Those flames roared at Long Chen in the form of giant beasts.

“Big brother Long Chen, I need those flames! Toss me inside later. I’m going to refine myself!” exclaimed Ling-er.

It was unknown what materials had gone into making the Demon Moon Furnace. At that time, Ling-er had yet to awaken her spirit, so she had no recollection.

Now though, she was capable of sensing what would benefit her and what wouldn’t. All item-spirits had sharp intuitions for this kind of thing. Ling-er could sense that the karmic hell flames would be very beneficial to her.

“No problem. Just wait a bit.” Long Chen was delighted to see the karmic hell flames had finally come out. His flame wings shuddered, and one small flame lotus after another rained down from them, exploding amongst the karmic hell flames.

The giant flame beasts formed of the karmic hell flames were originally holding back slightly, seemingly somewhat afraid of Long Chen. However, this action infuriated them, and like oil had been tossed onto the fire, they charged into the air, attacking him.

Seeing that, without a word, Long Chen turned and ran. This seemed to further antagonize the karmic hell flames.

The karmic hell flames burst forth like a dam had been broken. They poured into this world, igniting heaven and earth.

“Mo Nian, you can start,” transmitted Long Chen through the Heaven Flipping Seal in Mo Nian’s astral space.

Long Chen brought the karmic hell flames flying toward the Nethergod’s palace. Wherever he went, the earth vanished.

“Hong Yaoyang, you little ghost, get the fuck out here. Today, I, Long Chen, am going to beat the crap out of you!” Long Chen announced himself as soon as he arrived.

Within the palace, the icy-faced Hong Yaoyang had his hands clasped in front of his chest. He was seated on a prayer mat, a divine seal flickering on his forehead. Five-colored light was shining behind him, moving according to a set rhythm. It seemed that he was doing some kind of cultivation.

All of a sudden, a knocking sound rang out, and a crack appeared in the mark on his forehead. His body shuddered and his divine energy collapsed. He suddenly coughed up a mouthful of blood, which transformed into runes that merged back into heaven and earth.

“Courting death!”

Hong Yaoyang furiously waved his hand. A door suddenly opened, and an armored person was sucked toward him. Hong Yaoyang grabbed his throat, filled with killing intent.

“Did I not say not to disturb me when I’m in seclusion?! Do you want to die? What is your excuse?!”

Hong Yaoyang’s voice was frighteningly cold. Just now, he had been in a critical state of his cultivation, but this person’s disturbance had ruined everything. He was on the verge of killing this person in his rage, but since this person was a loyal follower of his for many years, he held back.

“Master, this lowly one had no other choice but to disturb you… Just now… someone has challenged you to battle,” babbled the person in his grip.

“Challenging me? They’re really courting death. I’ll go take a look. My mood isn’t good today.”

Hong Yaoyang tossed that person aside. He started walking, and his expression suddenly changed upon seeing the karmic hell flames surrounding his palace.

Hong Yaoyang immediately activated the palace’s protections. Divine light enveloped it. “How did the karmic hell flames get here?!”

“It was too sudden! We have no idea what is happening. If there wasn’t any other option, I wouldn’t have dared to disturb you!” reported his follower.

Hong Yaoyang’s expression grew dark. The karmic hell flames were flames from Purgatory. They burned all things possessing karma, which included mortals and gods.

“Why didn’t you say so earlier?!” Hong Yaoyang clenched his teeth. The karmic hell flames had enveloped the palace. He needed to maintain the defenses and was unable to go investigate what was going on in Purgatory.

If he left, the palace would be incinerated. If his throne was destroyed, he would be done for. For a moment, he was unable to come up with any way to handle the karmic hell flames.

He flew out of the palace and stood on the peak. Suddenly, he saw a black-robed man standing atop a pill furnace smiling at him.

“It’s you?!”

Hong Yaoyang’s eyes almost popped out of his head. He couldn’t believe that Long Chen was here.

“Hong Yaoyang, you have some guts. Instead of being grateful for the lesson I gave you, you actually dared to harbor resentment. Today, I’ll make sure that the lesson sticks. Prepare a diaper because I won’t be leaving without beating the crap out of you.” Long Chen and the pill furnace were completely covered in flames. They were like a lonely boat within an angry sea.

The beasts that the karmic hell flames had manifested were crazily attacking him, but the other flames had formed a giant barrier around Long Chen, protecting him.

With the support of the third volume of the Nirvana Scripture, other than the karmic hell flames, all other flames had to listen to him. Those flames were helping him block the karmic hell flames of their own accord. At least for a short time, the karmic hell flames were unable to touch him.

Long Chen’s guess was that he should be able to control the karmic hell flames, but his current power was too low to make them submit. That was why they were fighting against him for supremacy. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

The Demon Moon Furnace had grown to many times its original size, appearing like an island floating within the sea of flames. Ling-er was absorbing the karmic hell flames for herself.

When he asked her what she was doing, Ling-er was unable to say. Long Chen’s guess was that the Demon Moon Furnace was originally created with the karmic hell flames.

Most likely, there hadn’t been enough karmic hell flames at the time, resulting in many areas of her body being improperly refined. That was why Ling-er was using them to refine herself again.

Standing within the sea of flames and staring at the shocked Hong Yaoyang, Long Chen felt a sense of pride. Perhaps the only one who dared to challenge a god in his realm was him.

Regretfully, there was no way to use a photographic jade to record what was happening here. Otherwise, if he could spread it throughout the Martial Heaven Continent, it would definitely terrify his enemies.

Hong Yaoyang’s expression was gloomy. He suddenly snorted and pointed a finger. As a result, divine light condensed into a sword and pierced through the air.

However, in that instant, Long Chen vanished, hiding himself within the Demon Moon Furnace. The Demon Moon Furnace sank within the flames.

As a result, his sword pierced through the karmic hell flames, blasting a hole through them. Hong Yaoyang turned green.

The karmic hell flames began to rage. They crashed upon the palace like a tsunami.
