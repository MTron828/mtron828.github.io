Chapter 3836 Asura Manifests All Things

BOOM!

It seemed that the Nine Underworld Luocha was even angrier than Long Chen. She actually butted in and started attacking Ji Wuming herself, leaving even Long Chen dumbfounded.

“Are you fucking crazy?!”

Ji Wuming’s cheek was cut to the bone by the Nine Underworld Luocha, so he was shocked and enraged.

“You idiot, I already warned you to scram! But you just have to get in my way over and over again! Since that’s the case, you can just die first before I slaughter him!”

The Nine Underworld Luocha was infuriated. She had lost to Long Chen last time and had been humiliated, so she wanted to wipe away that humiliation.

After all, she was different from Ji Wuming. She wanted to openly defeat Long Chen for her vengeance. If Long Chen was being affected by other factors, then even if she killed him, it wouldn’t be enough to wipe away her humiliation.

If that happened, Long Chen would be dead, and the shadow over her heart would become impossible to erase. This shadow would then affect her Dao-heart, and she might never be able to walk out of this shadow.

As a result, she wanted to beat Long Chen in his best condition without interference. That was the only way to make her Dao-heart flawless, fully erasing the shadow that Long Chen had left her in.

From the start, she had said that Long Chen was hers. Furthermore, she had said it more than once.

Ji Wuming’s first attempt at assassinating Yue Xiaoqian had angered Nine Underworld Luocha. His interference was affecting her fight with Long Chen.

She had then warned him, only for him to do the same thing again. With her temper, it was understandable that she would start attacking Ji Wuming.

“Asura Manifests All Things!”

She roared and her manifestation quivered. After that, the giant figure within it vanished, transforming into an enormous world.

This world was filled with mountains of bones and seas of blood. It was an Asura world filled with death. It was like a battlefield where you had to kill in order to live.

When her manifestation suddenly changed, her aura transformed as well. All kinds of runes appeared in her eyes. Lightning flashed when she opened and closed them.

“I can’t wait any longer! Today, I’ll make you kneel and beg for mercy!”

Even her voice had changed. It was like her voice was coming from another world, echoing endlessly.

The next moment, her sword fell. The entire heavenly tomb quivered due to her attack, and Ji Wuming’s concealment art was actually broken by her.

“You really are an unreasonable madwoman!”

Ji Wuming shouted furiously. This madwoman actually attacked him instead of killing Long Chen. He felt like he might explode in anger.

Seeing the Nine Underworld Luocha take out her strongest manifestation that caused the ten thousand Daos to rage and space to be compressed, he found that he was unable to conceal himself within the range of her manifestation. He could only fight her directly.

“You really are a chicken-hearted idiot!”

The Nine Underworld Luocha also shouted back at him, her sword slashing down mercilessly.

“You’re as much of an idiot as your master!”

Ji Wuming shouted. He was a cool-headed assassin, but facing the Nine Underworld Luocha, even with his calmness, he felt like he might explode from rage. This madwoman simply couldn’t be reasoned with.

With a shout, runes lit up on his left and right hand. He activated both of his Supreme Bones. His dagger appeared in his right hand in front of him, while the palm of his left hand was placed behind him.

BOOM!

The space behind Ji Wuming exploded. That wild power then spurted out of his hand and crashed into the wall of this room. As a result, the wall collapsed and countless corpses came tumbling down.

Ji Wuming didn’t want to fight the Nine Underworld Luocha directly. He actually drew her power in from the front and released it out the back. He himself only endured a tiny part of her power. The majority was released behind him.

“Useless fellow, when are you going to fight like a man?!” shouted the Nine Underworld Luocha disdainfully. She once more attacked, this time even more ferociously.

“Only an idiot like Liao Bencang could raise a fool like you! If you’re going to fight like this, why even be an assassin?!” Ji Wuming felt like he might explode from rage.

The Bloodkill Hall and the Nine Underworld Hall’s disciples were both assassins. Assassins sought to kill their target with the smallest price possible; that was simply the basics. To fight directly with all one’s power was taboo.

The Nine Underworld Luocha actually mocked him for not fighting her directly? If it was anyone else, he naturally wouldn’t even care about it. But for the future successor of the Nine Underworld Hall to say such a thing, he felt like he might cough up blood.

“You’re cowardly rogues! We’re expert assassins. You keep playing such despicable games, but expert assassins like us practice skill. To put it frankly, you are degenerates, scum! The Assassination Dao requires confidence in oneself. What nonsense is that about fleeing as soon as you fail to kill your target in one blow? You simply have no confidence in yourselves and came up with an excuse to cover it up. If you have no guts, then just say that you’re a coward. Why spout so much nonsense? This is why our Nine Underworld Hall looks down on you the most,” sneered the Nine Underworld Luocha as she continued to press the attack.

“You… you… fuck you!”

Ji Wuming’s eyes were red with rage. He wanted to retort, but what was he supposed to say to someone crazy? It was the first time in his life that he was driven to simply cursing someone.

“You’re just like your master. You say the right things but lack any real ability. What? Is your Bloodkill Hall still drumming up skin-deep business?” Seeing Ji Wuming be so enraged, the Nine Underworld Luocha felt an unprecedented sense of accomplishment. Whether it was Enpuda or Ji Wuming, they were both shrewd schemers. To be able to enrage him to this point was definitely something to be proud of.

Ji Wuming’s face was dark with rage. However, he still maintained his rationality. In front of the Nine Underworld Luocha’s tempest of attacks, he continued to avoid fighting her directly.

He naturally wouldn’t be so foolish as to fight her directly. That would only result in both of them being seriously wounded. In the end, Long Chen would be the one to benefit.

Originally, he was only planning on attacking Yue Xiaoqian to throw Long Chen and the others’ formation into chaos. In truth, his real target was Xia Chen. Attacking Yue Xiaoqian was only a preparation for assassinating Xia Chen.Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Xia Chen was a formation master and was comparatively easier to deal with. Furthermore, considering how skilled he was with formations, killing him was the priority to make sure that Long Chen and the others couldn’t get away.

However, in all his calculations, he hadn’t calculated that the Nine Underworld Luocha would actually abandon Long Chen to attack him.

At this time, Long Chen was just watching the Nine Underworld Luocha chase down Ji Wuming wretchedly. He was a bit lost. He even suspected that the two were scheming against him together somehow, so he watched them closely.

However, even after a long time of observation, he didn’t notice any signs of some scheme. Only then did he join the battle and start attacking the devil experts coming at them.

“Wait, where is Yin Changsheng?!” Suddenly, Long Chen noticed that they had neglected someone.

At the same time, the Fusang Tree beneath his feet quivered. Long Chen instantly realized that Yin Changsheng had taken advantage of the chaos to try to take the Fusang Tree.

“Put that down! That’s mine!”

Long Chen shouted and shot toward the crown of the Fusang tree like a bolt of lightning.
