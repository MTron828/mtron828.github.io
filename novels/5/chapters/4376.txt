Chapter 4365 True Power

“In this world, the greatest power instills fear, giving rise to reverence. It’s then through reverence that one grasps the essence of gratitude, and to comprehend both reverence and gratitude is to fathom the true meaning of power. You are nothing but a foolish elephant. How dare you speak of power? Do you not know that a summer fly cannot speak of ice, and the frog in the well cannot speak of the ocean?”

The sea of stars behind Long Chen flowed, resonating with the stars above the nine heavens. This world was then shrouded in starlight.

Seven stars that were radiant like suns stood out prominently. Encircling a central core star, the rest of the stars formed two triangular formations, and the center Violet Tower Star unleashed a torrent of violet qi, its essence coalescing into a vast sea.

Within Long Chen’s Dantian, 108,000 stars quivered in unison. He was igniting the power of his Spirit Root.

This marked Long Chen’s first time using the power of his Spirit Root. Once it was ignited, Long Chen had the feeling of being rooted into the ten thousand Daos.

Once adrift like rootless duckweed, he had now found solid ground and understood the martial concept of “power starting from beneath the feet”.

After Long Chen had reclaimed his Spirit Root, his comprehension of the Nine Star Hegemon Body Art rose to another level. He finally understood just how important a root was.

“You’re the one who’s ignorant! A little human talks of power?! What a huge joke!”

The Dragon Elephant’s fist merged with the enormous fist of his manifestation and smashed toward Long Chen without mercy.Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Everyone could see that this Dragon Elephant’s manifestation had summoned its ancestral power. Two distinct forces were converging, creating a fusion that transcended the constraints of spacetime—an irresistible power.

Seeing this scene, the human experts grew worried. This manifestation exceeded the power of the Dragon Elephant expert alone. It was practically cheating as he summoned the ancestral power of the whole Dragon Elephant race.

“The human race isn’t qualified to speak of power? You really know nothing about true power. Today, I’ll make you understand what it is.”

Long Chen’s seven star diagram suddenly grew and soared into the sky, shaking the starry sky. In an instant, the Violet Tower Star at the heart of the seven stars blazed with violet divine radiance, dyeing this world in its color.

BOOM!

People didn’t even see Long Chen move and only saw violet light fill the sky. Following that, the enormous Dragon Elephant manifestation exploded.

“What?!”

An enormous figure shot through the air, crashing into the ground and creating a giant hole. The Dragon Elephant couldn’t even maintain human form and used his true form to receive the shockwaves of this attack.

In human form, he was more agile. However, his defensive power was greater in his Dragon Elephant form.

Even so, everyone with sharp eyes instantly saw that the Dragon Elephant had lost one of his front legs.

BOOM!

Suddenly, the earth exploded, and the Dragon Elephant expert reappeared in human form. He was drenched in blood, and one of his arms was severed all the way to the shoulder. Long Chen had obliterated that arm in their last exchange.

“How is this possible?!”

Disbelief gripped the experts of the Great Desolate World. They had all thought that the last attack would kill Long Chen for sure. After all, no one had ever survived such a devastating attack.

Yet, to their astonishment, Long Chen not only survived but also crushed the Dragon Elephant’s manifestation and his arm. They refused to believe this.

The seven-star diagram behind Long Chen revolved, and the star at the center of it was different from the other six stars. It was pointed at Long Chen’s back, channeling a torrent of power into him.

In the past, such concentrated power would have instantly overwhelmed him. However, the present Long Chen had evolved to the point where he could withstand such an immense power surge. Reclaiming his Spirit Blood, Spirit Root, and Spirit Bone, as well as undergoing the baptism of the heavenly tribulation had completely transformed him.

Standing in the air, Long Chen was still in his punching posture, and a wild delight shone in his eyes.

“This is the true power of the Nine Star Hegemon Body Art. The previous me hadn’t even mastered a single strand of its hair.”

Long Chen had always felt that something was amiss with his Nine Star Hegemon Body Art. He thought that he had taken the wrong path. He also had a persistent feeling that the power within the Nine Star Hegemon Body Art should be far greater than what he could unleash.

Now, his suspicions were confirmed. The power he controlled back then was truly just the tip of the iceberg. However, he hadn’t gone off the wrong path, and his cultivation path was also correct. The limitation stemmed from the fact that his physical body was too weak, so his body was instinctively protecting him, leaving him unable to tap into more power from the Nine Star Hegemon Body Art.

In other words, the more power he used, the greater risk to himself there was. Altering his body’s instincts was also not an option unless he wanted to kill himself. The amount of power he used was definitely within the range that he could control.

It wasn’t that the Nine Star Hegemon Body Art lacked power, nor was his cultivation path wrong. The main issue had been his lack of strength.

Now that he was strong enough, his body was no longer instinctively preventing him from tapping into greater power. This allowed him to comprehend more of the secrets of the nine stars and raise his comprehension.

This fist of his not only shattered the Dragon Elephant manifestation but also his bottleneck. Enlightenment struck Long Chen head-on, clearing his head. Concepts that had eluded him were incomparably obvious now.

Long Chen maintained his punching posture not for display but to linger in that profound sensation. The sense of perfection was etched deeply into his consciousness, an experience he was hesitant to relinquish. Immersed in this feeling, he hesitated to move, as he was afraid that it would vanish.

The sensation of having everything under control, of the ten thousand Daos of heaven and earth being within his grasp, was an unprecedented experience for Long Chen. This fist let Long Chen see the true terror of the Nine Star Hegemon Body Art.

“Boss is mighty!” Guo Ran cheered excitedly.

It was only after a moment that Guo Ran and the others recovered from their shock. Their boss was as strong as ever and would definitely be able to strut around wherever he went. Others might have bullied him before, but now he could bully them back.

Guo Ran’s shout drew others out of their stupor, waking them up from their dreams. They then looked from Long Chen to the Dragon Elephant expert, who was missing an arm. Finally, they accepted this reality.

Following that, heaven-shaking cheers erupted from the human race’s side. The strongest heavenly geniuses between the two worlds clashed, and Long Chen completely crushed his opponent!

“Damn bastard! I can’t lose!”

The Dragon Elephant expert suddenly let out a furious roar. raising his hand to summon a golden spear. This peculiar Eternal divine weapon bore strange marks and was crafted from the tusk of a Dragon Elephant from the desolate era—an heirloom passed down through the Dragon Elephant race. As the spear materialized, an ominous qi instantly locked onto Long Chen.

“DIE!” The Dragon Elephant expert bellowed, thrusting the spear forward. To everyone's astonishment, his robust physique rapidly withered the moment he executed this attack. His essence blood was sucked dry by the spear.

BOOM!

This abrupt shift caught Long Chen off-guard, and by the time he reacted, the spear was already upon him. In a swift move, Long Chen extended a hand and caught the speartip. The overwhelming power of the spear flooded into him.

The void beneath Long Chen’s feet exploded, and he was pushed further and further back. It was his first time feeling shocked ever since the battle started.

The Dragon Elephant expert roared, stabbing Long Chen with all his power. However, the speartip remained half an inch away from Long Chen’s head. That tiny distance was like an invisible barrier that could not be broken through.

Just then, the space behind Long Chen twisted. A figure materialized in silence, wielding a sharp bone blade aimed at the back of his head.

“Watch out!”

Guo Ran and the others’ expressions completely changed. This figure appeared out of nowhere, and no one had sensed its existence before this.
