Chapter 2186 A Chaotic Battle Begins

Huang Feiyan’s head soared into the air, and her vitality rapidly faded. Her final shout still hung in the air.

Cloud let out a resounding bird cry, a cry of hatred and released humiliation. The Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow race had been humiliated for so many years. With Huang Feiyan’s blood, they had started up their path for vengeance.

The void suddenly exploded as a giant Nine Heavens Divine Phoenix appeared, its claws reaching toward Cloud. It was the leader of the Nine Heavens Divine Phoenix race. Seeing their strongest genius be killed, he went crazy. Since he wasn’t able to save Huang Feiyan, now all his hatred was cast onto Cloud.

This Nine Heavens Divine Phoenix had lived for countless years. His very core was igniting as he went all-out against Cloud.

“Cloud, don’t face him directly!” shouted Meng Qi. This Nine Heavens Divine Phoenix was too powerful. There was no meaning in facing him directly.

Seeing Cloud directly fly back within the qi flow stream, the Nine Heavens Divine Phoenix roared, “The Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow race is a pack of inferior cowards! You don’t even have the courage to fight?!”

Cloud’s anger soared once more and her wings spread. She would fight for the honor of the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow race.

The leader of the Nine Heavens Divine Phoenix race was delighted to see this. All his feathers suddenly emitted streams of divine light. He was igniting his own essence blood and longevity to unleash an all-out attack to kill Cloud.

However, just as his divine ability was brewing, a blood-colored arrow pierced his eye. Blood rained down, and he let out a miserable shriek.

Everyone’s gazes first turned toward Mo Nian, only to see him raise his hands innocently. “It wasn’t me.”

“I swept through the four seas, crossed a thousand mountains, caused huge billows in heaven and earth. With one arrow, the cosmos shakes. If you need a peerless divine archer, you can come find Guo Ran! In the future, I’ll thank everyone for calling me the Divine Archer Guo Ran.” Guo Ran waved a greeting to the attacking army. He was standing so conspicuously like he was worried others might not see him. That smile on his face was as arrogant as possible, and he held a large blood-colored crossbow.

Before others could react, Cloud activated a divine ability, using her wings as sharp swords that slashed through the leader of the Nine Heavens Divine Phoenix race. He was instantly killed.

That leader was truly unlucky. His full-power divine ability was interrupted midway, causing the power he had accumulated to grow chaotic and almost explode. He had barely managed to suppress that power and stop himself from exploding when Cloud’s attack arrived.

“Cloud, come back,” called Meng Qi, worried about further provocations. On the other hand, the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrows cheered.

Guo Ran began to shoot his crossbow repeatedly, every time causing the head of a Xuan Beast to explode. People weren’t even able to see his arrows before they struck. His arrows were so fast that even Spiritual Strength was unable to grasp them.

“Hiding and secretly shooting people is shameless. Is the entire Dragonblood Legion like this?” Ximen Tianxiong furiously charged into the qi flow stream, attacking Guo Ran.

“Shi Lingfeng is missing an eye, so it’s understandable that he’s blind. But are you also blind? Can you not see this giant crossbow of mine? How can it be called hiding and shooting secretly?” mocked Guo Ran. A ray of light shot out at Ximen Tianxiong from his crossbow. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

“Insignificant. You can’t do anything to me!” Ximen Tianxiong didn’t even seem to pay attention to it. As if knowing the future, he swung his saber, shattering the arrow.

Guo Ran wanted to shoot again, but Ximen Tianxiong had arrived in front of him. Hence, Guo Ran could only put away his crossbow and pull out his dual blades.

“Then let me experience the amazing abilities of the everlasting families. I want to see if they’re as amazing as the legends say,” said Guo Ran. The metal feathers on his wings transformed, becoming a hardened carapace around his wings. From the back, he looked like a beetle, and that beetle shell looked exceptionally tough.

BOOM!

Guo Ran’s saber met Ximen Tianxiong’s, and Ximen Tianxiong was surprised to find that his saber was actually blocked.

He had activated his manifestation and was not holding back. But he was unable to suppress Guo Ran in terms of power.

“Hehe, are you surprised? I’ll tell you. This is another state of my armor, one with the power runes activated. The reason I retreated before was to give the spotlight to my boss, otherwise, he’d get mad at me. But did you really think I only had that little bit of ability? If I was so weak, how could I sit in the position of general of the entire Dragonblood Legion? Little fellow, you’re too naive.”

The runes on Guo Ran’s wings grew brighter. Following that, the light flowed into his arms and then his sabers.

“Today, I’ll show you the power of the Martial Heaven Continent’s number one battle armor. Try to survive my tempest of attacks.”

Guo Ran began to repeatedly slash his sabers, his arms spinning like wheels, unleashing dozens of attacks in the blink of an eye.

“What kind of crap is this?!”

Guo Ran’s figure was no longer visible. All that was visible was repeated saber-images. Guo Ran was like a tireless machine with his repeated attacks.

Ximen Tianxiong, a supreme genius, a survivor of countless battles, had never seen such a thing. He was repeatedly forced back. The current Guo Ran was like a hedgehog, and worst of all, this hedgehog’s quills were constantly spinning around it. For a moment, Ximen Tianxiong didn’t know how to counterattack.

“Li Qi, let’s go handle Shi Lingfeng.” Song Mingyuan saw Shi Lingfeng charging over. He and Li Qi went over.

Shi Lingfeng’s head had been cut off by Long Chen, but the Stone race was blessed by the heavens. He had reconnected to his body and didn’t look like he had even been injured. However, since he had lost a great deal of his core energy, his aura had dropped. Li Qi and Song Mingyuan were both earth cultivators whose power came from the same source as Shi Lingfeng. They had previously managed to fight against him, and now they did the same, stopping him in his tracks.

“Xue Luocha, last time we couldn’t determine a winner. This time we should settle things.” Mo Nian flew out to face Xue Luocha.

“Hmph, back then, you were nothing more than a bandit for my Blood Emperor family. Do you think you’re fit to fight against me?” Xue Luocha no longer maintained her fake cute voice facing Mo Nian.

“If you want to provoke me, there’s no need to use words. Just your face is enough. I wonder, with the Blood Emperor being as thin as a stick of bamboo, did he copulate with a pig to end up having you?” mocked Mo Nian.

“Die!” Xue Luocha’s fleshy body quivered as she attacked with her meteor hammer.

“If a pig like you hasn’t died, why would I die?” sneered Mo Nian.

BOOM!

Mo Nian’s bow quivered. An arrow shot out, but before it reached Xue Luocha, it exploded.

This was an exploding arrow not used for harming enemies. Just as it exploded, a silent arrow shot through its midst at Xue Luocha’s neck.

Xue Luocha seemed to have a great understanding of Mo Nian’s techniques and was prepared. She raised her arm, blocking the arrow.

“Can you not fight like a man?” sneered Xue Luocha.

“Can you not look like a woman?” responded Mo Nian. Eighteen consecutive arrows rained down.

Xue Luocha and Mo Nian both had a certain understanding of each other’s techniques. They had previously fought each other, with one being the chaser and one being the runner. Mo Nian was a long-range fighter, so the battle between the two of them was the most senseless.

Back in the Heaven Splitting Battle Sect, if Tu Qianshang had not arrived and joined forces with him, there would have been no way for him to heavily injure her. Now, once again, they fell into a battle of attrition.

Sharp wails broke through the clamor of the battle to strike people’s souls. Tian Xiezi had come, waving his soul summoning banner. Black qi swirled out of the Corrupt God Ancient Tower above him, as he also charged into the qi flow stream.

“I’ll handle him,” said Tang Wan-er. But she was stopped by Meng Qi.

“Perhaps your power isn’t inferior to his, but you don’t have a suitable divine item. You can’t handle the Corrupt path’s top divine weapon.”

Tang Wan-er’s power had grown explosively, but wind-attribute divine materials had been almost used up on the Martial Heaven Continent. Tang Wan-er was missing a true divine item that suited her.

Even Guo Ran hadn’t been able to forge something that suited her during this time. But if she had a suitable weapon, she wouldn’t need to fear anyone.

“Let me.” Ye Zhiqiu walked forward.

“Zhiqiu, how about we go together?” probed Chu Yao.

“No need. My master is watching. I will give her a satisfactory display to let her be at ease,” said Ye Zhiqiu.

She walked out of the crowd gracefully. A ripple passed through the air with every step like she was walking on water.

These ripples then froze, becoming ice lotuses. Once she took her next step, the ice lotuses shattered.

Ye Zhiqiu looked to be walking slowly but appeared in front of Tian Xiezi in an instant. Without any words, her sword slashed down. Ice Qi froze space, turning the surrounding world into a world of ice.

In the distance, Daoist Heavenly Feather smiled. “She has finally obtained its acknowledgment.”
