Chapter 2799 Destitute Guo Ran

This was a tranquil forest of towering trees. Every tree here was huge, even bigger than the Star Field Divine World’s mother tree.

Such giant trees had actually formed a forest stretching far beyond the horizon. A blood-colored moon hung in the sky.

This blood moon was very large. Furthermore, it was a constant in the sky. It didn’t move. Its light nourished this forest.

Deep within the forest was a long-haired elder. He sat on top of a mountain, basking in the light of the blood moon. He seemed to be breathing in its radiance.

Suddenly, he opened his eyes. A middle-aged man appeared before him. The elder asked, “You still haven’t found the wolf emperor’s sprout?”

The man shook his head, causing the elder to sigh, “That one slip caused us to lose the wolf emperor’s egg. There are too many powers that worship us. It’s impossible to tell where it went. It’s been a million years with still no news…”

“Ancestor, Lord Brahma’s side has sent word…”

“Tell him to scram as far as he can and stop disturbing our Moon Howling Heavenly Wolf race. We will not be threatened. If he doesn’t like it, we can fight to the death. There are no cowards here,” snorted the elder.

This elder was the ancestral patriarch of the Moon Howling Heavenly Wolf race. This was their ancestral land, the Blood Moon Divine Domain.

Another person came over, respectfully reporting, “Someone from the Nine Underworld line came, asking to see you.”

The man frowned. “The Nine Underworld line has nothing to do with us. Those despicable assassins can scram.”

“Wait…” The elder suddenly asked, “Why did they come?”

“They said that they noticed a member of our race in a lower plane. It had the mark of a blood moon on its forehead…”

“What?!”

Both the middle-aged man and the elder shook, filled with disbelief.

…

“Let go of me! I have to find my brother Long!”

Wilde roared angrily, transforming into a giant form. But he was still pushed down by another giant hand. His struggling tore a massive hole in the ground, but he was unable to escape that hand.

He was surrounded by a group of giants who were even bigger than him. All of them possessed powerful physical bodies, to the point that their Blood Qi looked like it was about to explode.

“Your brother Long isn’t in the same domain. You won’t be able to find him,” said the giant pressing him down with a smile.

The surrounding people seemed to be watching happily. They were smiling, and yet when one of them spoke, his voice was like thunder booming in the air.

“I still have to find him! He treats me well. You don’t treat me well!” roared Wilde. However, he was like a baby fighting adults. The power that he was so proud of was useless.

After two hours, he was finally out of energy and stopped struggling. His stomach grumbled thunderously.

A giant dish thumped onto the ground in front of him. There was a giant earthen dragon on the dish.

Without a word, Wilde grabbed it and stuffed his face. As soon as he recovered, he tried running away, only to be grabbed by someone. The same scene repeated itself.

The surrounding people seemed to have already gotten used to this. They continued watching. They were like giant mountains soaring into the grounds. But it wasn’t mountains, it was giants. Their shoulders were amongst the clouds.

These giants smiled with gratification as they watched Wilde. One of the elders said, “ The Barbarian King’s reincarnation has actually been sent here. It seems that there’s hope for our Barbarian race.”

“Just as our karmic luck was about to run out, the Barbarian King’s reincarnation appears. Our line can once more soar.” F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

“Little girl, you have Enpuda’s aura on you. It’s a bit dislikable. But your talent, aptitude, and that look in your eyes has moved me. I can see your desire to get stronger. I can break the rules and accept you as a disciple, but you must promise to endure the pain of cleansing your soul in order to remove Enpuda’s mark on you. Are you willing?” asked a woman in tight clothing and short hair.

“As long as I can get stronger, I am willing to do anything.”

The speaker was Dong Mingyu. Before her was an existence who struck terror in the hearts of countless people.

“Good. Starting today, you as my, Ye Wusheng’s, disciple. But remember, you are only a disciple. If you want to become my personal apprentice, you can deliver Enpuda’s head to me first. That can be considered a formal gift between master and apprentice,” said the short-haired woman.

“That’s just what I wanted.” Dong Mingyu nodded. She hated this despicable Killing God.

The woman smiled slightly. Dong Mingyu seemed to please her. Holding her hand, she vanished into the void with her.

…

Yue Zifeng stared at the lofty mountain in front of him. An overwhelming sword will filled this entire world. At the peak of the mountain was a sword. The sword was stabbed not only through the mountain, but through the sky as well. The stars revolved around it, giving off endless majesty.

“Boss, take care of yourself. When we meet again, I’ll protect you.”

Yue Zifeng took a deep breath and began climbing the mountain. From the sky, he was like an ant climbing a giant mountain. However, his footsteps persevered staunchly.

…

“Big brother, I’ve admired the Heavenly Dragon Divine Armor College for a long time. I’ve come a long way to study here. I beg of you to let me join in the trial. Once I pass, we will be apprentice-brothers. With my talent, I will definitely soar and repay you when the time comes.”

Guo Ran had spent seven days here to learn how people spoke here. This was the Divine Armor College’s registration stand. There would only be one chance to enroll every three years. It was said that it was the strongest college for forging armor within this star-field. There was an endless stream of people applying.

However, just applying cost three hundred immortal crystals. To Guo Ran who had only just ascended, that was an impossible price. He didn’t have any of this world’s currency.

He had tried to go to a pawnshop and sell what he had, but when he took out the divine materials of the Martial Heaven Continent, he was directly kicked out.

If it wasn’t due to how weak he was, people would probably have beaten him, thinking he was trying to waste their time. The lower plane’s divine materials were trash here. People wouldn’t take it even if you gave it to them.

Helplessly, Guo Ran could only resort to begging, hoping to muddle his way in. As long as he could take the test, he was confident that he could pass. After all, in terms of battle armors, he had devoted himself for a long time. Joining this college was paramount to his future.

“You again? Scram! This isn’t a charity! Can someone as poor as you even afford to build a single set of battle armor? Don’t joke,” scoffed a disciple.
