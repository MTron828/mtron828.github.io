Chapter 3657

Upon arriving at the Spirit Rune Pavilion’s sacred land, people saw endless ancient tomes and talismans. They also saw a headless skeleton.

At this moment, all of the Heavenly Talisman Star-Field’s experts walked over to the skeleton and kowtowed. They felt great admiration for this senior.

As a pavilion master, he crushed his own head to atone for his ancestors’ sins. That wasn’t even his own sin, yet he was willing to give up his life to make up for the sins of his ancestors. How many people were capable of assuming such a burden?

Upon entering the sacred land, Xia Chen looked around. Nothing had changed. He knew that while Gongsun Xuan and Gongsun Ziyi were busy hunting him down, they weren’t in the mood to investigate these things. Anyway, they simply didn’t have the power to study these things.

In front of everyone, Xia Chen made an inventory of ancient books, talismans, tomes, inscriptions, and other treasures. Starting today, these things would be shared amongst all talisman cultivators.

They could flip through them, copy them, and do whatever they wanted with them. But the treasures had to stay here. This sacred land now belonged to everyone. Anyone was qualified to study these, but they definitely could not allow anyone to bring them away or damage them.

This sacred land would be the sacred land of the entire Heavenly Talisman Star-Field. Eighteen top sects would join forces to guard it, and they couldn’t let the slightest accident happen to this place.

The people to copy them had to be experts of the top eighteen sects. They also had to monitor anyone coming and going. If anyone even dared to form a wicked thought toward this place, they would be the enemy of the entire Heavenly Talisman Star-Field and summarily executed.

Xia Chen spent ten days making a copy of all of these things. Many of these talismans were things that he had studied, but there were many that he had neglected due to not having any use for them at the time. He would have to study them in the future slowly.

The Spirit Rune Pavilion’s signboard was torn down during this time. As for the resources in the treasury, Xia Chen ordered people to directly exchange them for money and distribute it amongst people. A slightly bigger portion was given to those poorer sects, while those powerful sects were given a bit less. That was because those with power didn’t need to worry about running out of money, while the poorer ones had difficulty just surviving. Xia Chen hoped to lessen the pressure on them at least a bit.

As for Xia Chen himself, he didn’t take any portion. He even exchanged a few of his own valuable things for money to distribute.

To use his words, he had come to the Spirit Rune Pavilion with nothing. Now that he was leaving, he didn’t want to take anything other than knowledge. There was nothing he could do about the Spirit Rune Pavilion being disbanded. At least, he could feel a bit more at peace if he did this.

Countless people felt admiration for Xia Chen’s actions. They also sighed over how blind Gongsun Ziyi was. Just how many women would dream of having such a good husband? But she actually wanted to kill him. In the end, she simply destroyed herself.

Once the copies were done, Xia Chen accepted an invitation from the senior experts to expound on the Dao. Xia Chen then shared his own experiences and knowledge with everyone.

This one Dao discussion lasted three days and nights. Countless experts came to listen. Seeing those experts’ reverent and worshipful appearances, Guo Ran was jealous.

“Showing off silently really is the strongest. I thought that I already did very well, but this fellow immediately tossed me into the dust. Where is the justice?”

Long Chen and Guo Ran sat in a restaurant, staring at the sea of figures around Xia Chen. Long Chen smiled. “Xia Chen is using his real ability, using runes to enter the Dao. Every single one of his words contains profundities and gives food for thought. As for you?”

“Me? What about me? Did you see that I used a single arm to beat up Bloodkill Hall’s number one genius?!” quibbled Guo Ran stubbornly.

“Give it up. That Ji Wuying was an idiot. I refuse to believe that he’s the Bloodkill Hall’s number one genius. Unless Enpuda got crap in his head, he wouldn’t raise such a pig. Let me put it to you this way. I mentioned my fight with the Nine Underworld Luocha. Even without a Supreme Bone, within the same realm, she could easily slay Ji Wuying. Ji Wuying wasn’t able to unleash even a fraction of his Supreme Bone’s power before fighting you in a direct clash like a dumb dog. Have you seen such a stupid assassin before?” asked Long Chen.

“Well… that doesn’t matter! He said that he’s the Bloodkill Hall’s number one expert, so he must be the Bloodkill Hall’s number one expert!” Although Guo Ran continued quibbling, his tone weakened a great deal.

Through this reminder, it truly seemed that there were some problems with this fellow. Was an assassin who fought people directly really an assassin?

“I’ve seen the Nine Underworld Hall’s palace master, Liao Bencang. I’ve also seen the Bloodkill Hall’s palace master, Enpuda. To tell the truth, both of them gave me a similar sense of pressure. It’s simply that in terms of intelligence, Enpuda is far ahead of Liao Bencang. Perhaps I’d believe it if Ji Wuying was from the Nine Underworld Hall, but if you were to say that he was from the Bloodkill Hall and someone that Enpuda personally taught, I’d refuse to believe it even if you beat me to death.” Long Chen shook his head.

“Boss, are you saying that he wasn’t from the Bloodkill Hall? Was he a fake?” asked Guo Ran.

“No. His movement art is truly the Bloodkill Hall’s technique. Furthermore, those people that I killed that day were also true assassins of the Bloodkill Hall,” said Long Chen.

“Boss, you’re confusing me. Is Ji Wuying from the Bloodkill Hall or not?” asked Guo Ran.

“Tch, I’m confused too. He’s definitely from the Bloodkill Hall, but I have no idea what Enpuda raised such an idiot for,” said Long Chen, feeling vexed.

Enpuda was a crafty old fox. He definitely wouldn’t raise such an idiot. But it was impossible for someone with a Supreme Bone to appear in the Bloodkill Hall and have Enpuda not notice. So the question was, what was his goal?

Even Long Chen couldn’t see through Enpuda. That damn fatty had a stomach full of sinister schemes. Long Chen had to be wary of him.

“Who cares. Enpuda is just a World King. Do we need to fear him?” Guo Ran shrugged the confusion off.

However, Long Chen shook his head. “Your ego is getting inflated. Let me tell you, your performance this time was only so perfect because Ji Wuying was cooperating with you idiotically. It doesn’t mean that you really have the power of a Supreme expert. Other than that, you should not view Enpuda as inferior just because you’ve seen some half-step Divine Venerates. You should understand that all those people are immortal cultivators, while Enpuda is a god cultivator. He has believers throughout the nine heavens and ten lands. Even though he is a World King, his faith energy allows him to unleash the full power of a World Domain divine item. World Domain divine items are said to possess enough power to destroy an entire prefecture. Have you seen such power yet?”

“No, not yet.”

“All the half-step Divine Venerates you’ve seen are immortal cultivators. Since you haven’t seen a true god cultivator yet, you can’t imagine how terrifying they are. As for an expert like Enpuda, he can sweep through those half-step Divine Venerates. Don’t get too confident, or you’ll suffer a miserable defeat,” warned Long Chen.

Guo Ran truly was growing too confident with his new Supreme Bone. Long Chen had to knock him down a bit, or this fellow would really think that he was unrivaled.

Three days later, Xia Chen finished expounding the Dao. In front of countless reverent gazes, the three of them left the Heavenly Talisman Star-Field.

…

In a dark and secluded palace, Enpuda was sitting in a swirl of white mist. That white mist was made of faith energy.

“Master, my Supreme Bone has finally awakened.” Another figure silently appeared within the palace just like a specter. If Long Chen and the others were present, they would definitely be shocked because this person was the person that Guo Ran had just slain, Ji Wuying.
