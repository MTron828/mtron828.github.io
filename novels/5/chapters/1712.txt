Chapter 1707 Defending the Channel

Translator: BornToBe

A group of large men appeared in front of the spatial gate, and they all had huge broadswords. The ones at the front were Bao Buping and Chang Hao. The disciples of the Heaven Splitting Battle Sect had come!

“Haha, I thought that you had forgotten about us!” Bao Buping looked at the endless Empyrean Winged Blood Devils charging through the channel.

“Brothers, time to get to work.” Chang Hao raised his broadsword. A huge sword-image slashed out.

“Split the Heavens 5!”

A thousand disciples of the Heaven Splitting Battle Sect followed Chang Hao, raising all their broadswords together. A thousand attacks merged into one giant arc that slashed through the Empyrean Winged Blood Devils.

The Empyrean Winged Blood Devils roared furiously as they resisted, but despite that, this one attack killed the majority of them.

These Empyrean Winged Blood Devils were on the Life Star level, and their wings had bone-like supports growing out of them. Their defensive power was clearly much greater, but even they were unable to resist the Heaven Splitting Battle Sect’s disciples’ merged attack.

This merged attack even shocked Long Chen. He had never thought of the possibility of Split the Heavens being able to merge. For the power of a thousand people to merge together so perfectly was extremely difficult.

“We just got here and directly ran into some tough bones.” Bao Buping and Chang Hao were surprised that they hadn’t managed to kill all the Empyrean Winged Blood Devils in the channel. They were very clear on how powerful this merged attack was. Of course, this ability to merge Split the Heavens was one reason the Heaven Splitting Battle Sect had once been the head of the three great sects.

Originally, Bao Buping and Chang Hao had been planning on giving Long Chen a nice surprise by slaughtering them all, but their expected perfect result never appeared.

“Of course, if they weren’t tough, why would I call you? Everyone else, prepare yourselves! Assist the brothers from the Heaven Splitting Battle Sect in killing the Empyrean Winged Blood Devils. Make sure no fish slip out of the net!” shouted Long Chen.

At this moment, the Empyrean Winged Blood Devils had recollected themselves and were attempting another charge. The channel wasn’t very long. They could cross it in just a few seconds.

“Split the Heavens 5!”

The first attackers retreated one step, while another one thousand disciples replaced them, unleashing an identical attack.

BOOM!

This time, the Empyrean Winged Blood Devils were prepared. The ones at the front were killed, but the others behind managed to endure the impact and charge through.

In their defensive states, they were too tough to kill. Half were killed, but half managed to charge through.

“Meng Qi, Chu Yao, Wan-er, Ruyan, Cloud, and Zifeng, attack together. Win us some buffer room,” shouted Long Chen.

Following his orders, the six of them attacked at the same time. Six long-range attacks exploded through the spatial channel. Those Empyrean Winged Blood Devils were instantly killed, with no one managing to survive.

This made Bao Buping and Chang Hao’s expressions twitch. A thousand of them hadn’t been as powerful as the six of them. That was too embarrassing.

“What are you lazy fellows doing? Summon your manifestations! Are you holding back your spiritual yuan until you have kids?!” shouted Bao Buping.

The Heaven Splitting Battle Sect’s disciples roared and summoned their manifestations. These three thousand disciples were all rank nine Celestials.

These three thousand disciples were the elites of the Heaven Splitting Battle Sect. The Heaven Splitting Battle Sect hadn’t had that many disciples originally, but now that the world’s karmic luck was changing, the old man had spent all that karmic luck on these three thousand disciples. The power of these three thousand elites was truly terrifying.

Originally, Bao Buping and Chang Hao had been planning on going into the Devil Abyss with Long Chen, but after Long Chen had learned how powerful these disciples were, he had decided to keep them back as a trump card. Hence, he had Zheng Wenlong send him a long-distance transportation formation disc.

Long Chen had made Bao Buping and Chang Hao wait on standby as a killer trump card. He had predicted that there was a high chance of him being sneak attacked during this battle.

After all, there were plenty of channels within the Devil Abyss that led to all the large sects. Anyone could go through any of them to sneak attack the Dragonblood Legion.

That was why Long Chen had arranged warning indicators around the area they had been defending in the Devil Abyss. As long as a large number of experts got close to them, he would immediately be alerted of it.

He had thought that the sneak attackers would be from the Corrupt path, the ancient races, or the Xuan Beasts. However, it had ended up being Heavenly Fate Island.

If experts from Heavenly Fate Island wanted to sneak attack him, then those preparations he had made would be useless.

As a result, the Heaven Splitting Battle Sect’s disciples had come into play.

When they unleashed their full power, their killing prowess exploded. The three thousand disciples divided into three waves, cycling their attacks. At the same time, Meng Qi and the others were assisting. All of them forcibly blocked the channel.

“This is not a solution. Although we’re only using the fifth form of Split the Heavens, it’s still using up too much energy. It’s only a matter of time until we’re out of energy.”

After an incense stick’s worth of time, each of the Heaven Splitting Battle Sect’s disciples had used the fifth form of Split the Heavens over ten times. The exhaustion was starting to grow.

“There’s no way around it. We’re stalling. This channel doesn’t look like it will close for several hours. We have to defend it until the Xuan Master comes.”

“Boss, if this continues, I’m going to be the first one to be unable to endure,” said Guo Ran bitterly.

He saw that his kill points were stagnating, while others were still crazily gaining points. It wouldn’t be long before they surpassed him.

“What are you thinking about at such a critical time?!” raged Long Chen, wanting to kick him.

The channel had been forcibly opened, so it would need a long time to close again. It could be imagined how the monstrous existences on the Devil Slaughter Rankings were going all-out to get a higher rank.

Just as everyone was crazily defending the channel, cracking sounds appeared. Shockingly, two more channels opened around the main channel.

“There are supreme experts on the other side using the unbalanced spatial energy to tear open two more channels!” shouted Meng Qi.

“Die!” Those channels had just opened when hundreds of Empyrean Winged Blood Devils charged through.

“The Dragonblood Legion will defend the left channel, while the Heaven Splitting Battle Sect will defend the right channel,” ordered Long Chen.

“What about the main central channel?” shouted Bao Buping.

“You guys just need to defend your channel. Leave this place to me.”

With Evilmoon in hand, Long Chen charged over to the main channel on his own.

“Long Chen!”

Everyone jumped in shock, but the situation was too urgent for them to bother with it. Meng Qi, Chu Yao, and the others rushed over to the left side. There were already hundreds of Empyrean Winged Blood Devils here.

They needed to be immediately killed. As their numbers increased, it would be more difficult to block the channel.

Liu Ruyan and Chu Yao unleashed a combination move. It was one of their ultimate moves. Countless wooden stakes and willow branches came from above and below, killing the Empyrean Winged Blood Devils.

Bao Buping and Chang Hao led their people over to the right channel. The power of the Heaven Splitting Battle Sect’s disciples showed itself now.

In the face of hundreds of Empyrean Winged Blood Devils, the three thousand disciples unleashed Split the Heavens three times. Their three attacks crashed down like three waves, slaughtering their opponents and allowing them to quickly block the channel.

They had just blocked their channel when Meng Qi and the others also managed to kill their Empyrean Winged Blood Devils and start blocking their channel.

“Raging Flames Incinerate the Heavens!” L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

Golden flames exploded out of Long Chen, covering the space around the channel.

The Empyrean Winged Blood Devils had no choice but to fly through the flames. However, these flames were the Heaven Incinerating Flame. Although these Empyrean Winged Blood Devils were on the Life Star level, meaning it was no longer lethal against them, it didn’t mean that it was completely ineffective. At the very least, it blocked their sight.

The Empyrean Winged Blood Devils could only charge through blindly. That naturally wasn’t as effective. The main thing though was that Long Chen was standing within this flame domain. Evilmoon was in his hand, and its runes began to shine. A faint blood-colored light appeared on its edge. Evilmoon was also fighting alongside him.

Saber-images flew through the air, killing the Empyrean Winged Blood Devils that were blindly charging through. Long Chen’s Saber Qi was so sharp that it cut through them like tofu.

“Evilmoon, you’re not bad,” praised Long Chen.

He hadn’t expected Evilmoon, which was clearly a heavy-style martial weapon, to be able to unleash such sharp attacks. It seemed he only knew very little about its abilities.

Evilmoon was finally in possession of a bit of its own power and could help Long Chen. This bit of help made Long Chen’s attacks incredibly powerful.

However, this help exhausted its energy, so unless it was an important moment, Evilmoon also wouldn’t be willing to do this.

It was still sealed, meaning it couldn’t recover its energy. Every bit it used up would be gone, and it would be difficult to replenish it. So the reason Evilmoon didn’t help much wasn’t because it was stingy, but because it had no choice.

Long Chen had no need to charge through the channel. If he went any further, the channel’s power would suppress him. All he had to do was stand outside it, unleashing a rain of attack that killed any Empyrean Winged Blood Devils that attempted to charge past him.

However, as he killed and killed, Long Chen began to feel that something was wrong. The number of Empyrean Winged Blood Devils coming through the main channel was starting to drop.

BOOM!

Suddenly, an explosive sound came from the back, and Long Chen heard some familiar startled cries. Abandoning his channel, he hastily flew out to witness an infuriating sight.
