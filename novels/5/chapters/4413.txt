Chapter 4402 Killed in One Blow

The void ruptured as the Seven Peak Swords shredded through the constraints of spacetime, leaving tens of thousands of thin black lines etching the world.Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

The Seven Peak Swords covered all of heaven and earth. Hence, despite the instant retreat of these Eternal experts, they couldn't escape death. In a heartbeat, they became riddled with holes, akin to sieves.

After piercing through them, those Seven Peak Swords vanished, and the void slowly healed. However, the once-mighty Eternal experts now lay lifeless, transformed into mere corpses.

Their bodies descended slowly as if time itself was moving sluggishly. The onlookers couldn’t help but stare in shock. This scene was so surreal that they felt like they were dreaming.

Long Chen’s attack gave no one any time to react; it unfolded too swiftly, leaving the impression that it was over before it even started.

“Dad really is a genius. He was even capable of coming up with such a technique. I’m just a dumbass compared to him.” Long Chen slowly separated his hands.

This technique was imparted to him by Long Zhantian. Being able to directly unleash the full power of the seven-color Supreme Blood, it made Long Chen entirely fearless in group battles. Even in moments of crisis, he could instantly resolve everything with this move.

This seven-color Supreme Blood was Long Chen’s core energy, a force he could unleash directly. However, its main drawback lay in the fact that the tremendous detonation power had a significant impact on him.

As a result, Long Chen was reluctant to use it casually and had refrained from employing it until this moment.

While fighting these Eternal experts, Long Chen found that after reaching the first Heavenstage of the World King realm, his control over his power had grown, making him want to test this move, and the power of this move was even greater than he had imagined. It was unleashed almost instantaneously, not giving anyone any time to react. Moreover, its killing power was even greater than that of the World Extermination Flame Lotus.

To be fair, the World Extermination Flame Lotus would definitely be more powerful than this if Long Chen and Huo Linger unleashed their full power, but that would require him to use the Nirvana Scripture, and it would give the other side time to prepare.

On the other hand, this technique directly ignited his Supreme Blood, allowing him to instantly unleash a devastating attack.

In the end, killing power was the most important thing, and attacks that caught the other side off-guard were the most effective.

Back when Long Zhantian first passed on this technique to Long Chen, he repeatedly warned Long Chen not to force it, or he would injure himself. That was because Long Zhantian’s Supreme Blood Ignition was different from other experts’ blood ignition. They did it in a slow process, but Long Zhantian’s technique was an instantaneous eruption.

The primary idea was to unleash all the power in a single blow, leaving the other side with no time to react. However, this approach also provided no buffer for the user. As a result, this technique was perilous not only for the enemies but also for the practitioner. This single move nearly drained all of Long Chen’s seven-color Supreme Blood, and it would take at least a day for him to recover.

After unleashing this move, other than feeling a burning sensation throughout his body for a few breaths, Long Chen didn’t feel anything else.

“This proves that my constitution has yet to reach its limit. I can try an even higher level of detonation next time,” remarked Long Chen as he clenched his fists excitedly. His physical body was even stronger than he had expected.

This self-created blood ignition art was extremely domineering. Long Chen had merely utilized its initial level as a test, and now, he was confident about pushing its limits further. This technique would undoubtedly evolve along with his realm.

Long Chen then waved his hand, and several corpses soared through the air, entering the primal chaos space. They were tossed onto the black soil.

Silver Moon City was gone. The terrain underwent a total transformation, with void fissures still visible. What was once a bustling city now resembled hell on earth.

“Master is mighty!” Bally came over with Little Crane, wearing a flattering expression. While aware of Long Chen’s might, it hadn’t expected his power to reach this level.

In the cultivation world, immense power held the greatest charisma, and it resonated across all races.

Originally, Bally had harbored grievances over having a spiritual seal placed on it, but now, it perceived this as a supreme honor. In fact, becoming Long Chen’s servant felt like the greatest stroke of luck in its life. Just standing beside Long Chen filled it with an unprecedented sense of glory.

After a moment, Long Chen’s divine ring vanished, and the starry sea was gone. His fluttering hair and robes came to a standstill.

Long Chen’s killing intent also dissipated. He looked at Little Crane, and upon seeing her warm smile, he held her hand. “I’m sorry. There are always bad people interfering. Let’s go play somewhere else.”

“Hehe, I’m not afraid! Watching Big Brother Long Chen punish bad people is also fun! Once they’re gone, people won’t be harmed by them, and this world will be more peaceful. If it really is peaceful, it won’t feel so bad to come out and play!” Little Crane giggled.

Seeing that she didn’t feel any sense of self-blame or fear, Long Chen fully relaxed. However, Little Crane’s rainbow light had been suppressed within her and could no longer be unleashed externally. Long Chen could comprehend how difficult it was for her to be in such an environment.

After all, she needed her rainbow radiance to block the outside world’s dirty aura and preserve her purity. However, brutality and killing were rampant everywhere in this world. Where could Little Crane possibly find peace? Was she destined to spend her entire life secluded in the rear mountains of the academy?

“No, this world also has many pure places. Perhaps I can create a haven for her.” Long Chen suddenly formed such a thought as he gazed into Little Crane’s slightly weary eyes.

“Big Brother Long Chen, suddenly I feel sleepy,” Little Crane yawned.

Long Chen knew that the deaths of so many Eternal experts had unleashed a surge of negative emotions, and they would impact her somewhat. Gently picking her up, Long Chen carried her on his back, and Little Crane fell asleep just like that with a sweet smile.

As Long Chen’s gaze swept over the battlefield, countless lifeforms instantly quivered with terror.

“Go back and inform your seniors that Boss Long San is back. The Darklight Heaven is no longer what it used to be. If you don’t want to die, take it easy. Otherwise, you might just force Boss Long San to handle the situation. Then, begging for mercy won’t even be an option.”

After saying that, Long Chen departed, with Bally trailing closely behind. Their figures disappeared, leaving behind the ruined Silver Moon City that looked incredibly desolate. Following that, the name of Boss Long San spread throughout the Darklight Heaven like a tsunami.
