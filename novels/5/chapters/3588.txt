Chapter 3577

Guo Ran had the same appearance as before. However, now there was a touch of age on his face. It seemed that he had matured quite a bit.

However, when he saw Long Chen, he was like a child that had been aggrieved. The emotions that he had been suppressing for a long time burst out.

Tu Hu and the others who were familiar with Guo Ran were all dumbfounded. They didn’t dare to believe that their hero would kneel in front of someone else and weep.

Long Chen’s eyes also reddened. He reached out to lift Guo Ran. “Get up. You’re now one of the Four Heavenly Dragon Heroes. Don’t embarrass yourself here.”

Even though that was what Long Chen said, he was also choking back some sobs. Tears flowed down his face as well. As for Guo Ran, he continued to tightly hold Long Chen’s leg, refusing to let go. Long Chen cursed, “Hurry up and let go! I don’t want to embarrass myself!”

Long Chen pulled Guo Ran up. After that, Guo Ran sobbingly said, “Boss, I thought that I would never see you again in this lifetime.”

Seeing that Guo Ran’s face had lost some of its old youthfulness, Long Chen felt a bit sorry. This brother that had been with him since long ago had always been like a child that refused to grow up. He could always be unrestrained and free with Long Chen by his side.

For him to have matured so much during this time meant that things had truly been very bitter for him.

“What nonsense. As soon as I heard some news about you, I immediately came here, right? Our Dragonblood Legion still needs to fight together in the immortal world. What will we do without you?” Long Chen wiped away his tears and shook Guo Ran’s shoulders hard.

“That’s right. Without me, Guo Ran, even heaven and earth would lose their splendor, hahaha!” Guo Ran laughed. After seeing Long Chen again, his entire body relaxed. He seemed to once more return to his original character.

Just then, a fragrant breeze attacked Long Chen. A woman tightly hugged him.

“Hey, who… Oh… Xie Qianqian…” Long Chen was startled at first, but he quickly realized that this woman was precisely Xie Qianqian, someone who had gone through Purgatory with him.

It was only after giving him a fierce hug that Xie Qianqian let go and said with a touch of bitter grumbling, “You scoundrel, you said that you would come find me, and you came so late.”

“In the end, I still came, right? Beautiful lady, you’ve grown up!”

Long Chen looked at Xie Qianqian more closely. He found that she had truly grown up. Compared to the last time they met, that underripe flavor of a young maiden was gone, replaced with a bountiful maturity.

Xie Qianqian glared at him. “I waited a long time for you, but you never came. I could only marry someone else. You came too late!”

Long Chen laughed. “That’s alright, I already have so many wives at home. I’m not missing one or two.”

Long Chen and Xie Qianqian might have gone through life and death together, but they had never gotten involved romantically.

“Hmph, you still don’t know how to talk. Can’t you act remorseful?” Xie Qianqian glared at him.

“Haha, it’s not bad for you to be able to find someone to marry. When I knew you, you were as skinny as a chopstick. I couldn’t even tell the difference between the front and the back. What am I remorseful for?” scoffed Long Chen.

“You really need a beating!” Xie Qianqian beat Long Chen with her fist and then dragged over a man beside her. “Let me introduce you. This is my husband. He helped me in my most difficult time. I had nothing to repay him with, so I married him. If you had come earlier, I might have married you!”

“Greetings, brother Long. Many thanks for looking after Qianqian.”

This man was an early Immortal King and looked very refined. He definitely looked like a well-behaved and honest person. Even when Xia Qianqian hugged and joked about marrying Long Chen, he didn’t get angry. Instead, he actually looked at Long Chen gratefully. This was definitely a pure-hearted and kind person. Xie Qianqian’s vision wasn’t bad.

“Brother, it’s been hard on you.” Long Chen patted him on the shoulder sympathetically.

“And what is that supposed to mean?!” raged Xie Qianqian.

“Guo Ran, you are in collusion with a spy?! You have betrayed the human race! Do you have anything to say?”

Just as they were speaking, countless experts surrounded them. One young man in silver armor stepped forward with raging killing intent.

“Leng Hui!”

Tu Hu and the others’ expressions changed.

Leng Hui was one of the Four Heavenly Dragon Heroes, one of Guo Ran’s main opponents. He was willing to do anything just to apply pressure on Guo Ran. Hence, Guo Ran’s people all hated him to the bone, wishing to feed him to animals.

“Fuck your mother, now that my boss is here, do you think that I’m afraid of you? All you do is frame, entrap, and splash sewage on me. If it weren’t for those old bastards supporting the few of you, I’d have long since kicked out those balls of yours! What dogshit four heroes, if your forces weren’t constantly suppressing me, would I be in this state? I’ve endured all this humiliation for so long to learn new skills, not to fight with you. However, you’ve repeatedly been thorns on my sides. Before this, I was afraid because if I left the Heavenly Dragon Divine Armor College, I’d have nowhere to go. Now that my boss is here, I’m immediately leaving this damned place! All of you can go kill yourselves! That is all.” Guo Ran directly cursed Leng Hui.

Those familiar with Guo Ran in the Heavenly Dragon Divine Armor College were dumbfounded. Today’s Guo Ran was practically a completely different person.

Usually, Guo Ran was steady, wise, and knew how to endure. First planning and then acting. He never cursed people like this. First, he hugged Long Chen’s leg and cried, and now he directly cursed Leng Hui. People began to suspect that Guo Ran had been possessed by someone.

What they didn’t know was that Guo Ran had never been a steady and wise person. He had acted like that only because he was forced to. For over a year, Guo Ran had been suffering silently.

In the Heavenly Dragon Divine Armor College, he finally experienced his boss’s pain and what it meant to rise through pressure. No matter how gray the future appeared, he had to give the people beside him hope. He couldn’t be discouraged, he couldn’t be negative, and he couldn’t shirk things. He wanted to face them directly, but his power was also not enough.

During this one year, Guo Ran himself didn’t know how he had managed to hold himself up. That was why as soon as he saw Long Chen, he couldn’t hold back and wept. If he didn’t, he felt like he would go insane.

With Long Chen present, he had his old confidence back. That confidence stemmed from Long Chen. Just like before, his confidence in Long Chen was practically blind.

Having all his burdens suddenly cast aside made him instantly relax. Even if he had to face an immense army, as long as Long Chen was by his side, there was nothing to fear.

“Since you admit that you’re a spy, then there’s nothing else to say! Come capture him! Anyone who dares to resist is to be executed!” shouted Leng Hui.

“Anyone who dares to move will not see tomorrow’s sun. However many people that come is how many that I’ll kill.”

Long Chen clasped his hands behind his back and looked at those experts lightly. Huo Linger’s True Fire Sword’s light circulated brightly, ready to reap lives at any moment.

“What big words! Then show me just who dares to be so arrogant in my Heavenly Dragon Divine Armor College.”

A group of elders appeared and they all possessed powerful auras. They were all late stage World Kings. Their leader looked coldly at Long Chen.

“Deputy dean!”

Tu Hu and the others cried out in alarm. This elder was the deputy dean of the Heavenly Dragon Divine Armor College. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Brat, were you the one talking just now?”

The deputy dean came before Long Chen with a group of experts, eyeing Long Chen up and down.

Pow!

Long Chen directly slapped the deputy dean in the face. “Who do you think you’re talking to?”
