Chapter 4794 Come and Bite Me

When the Heaven Saint’s arm exploded into ice fragments, countless experts were shocked.

None of them had expected that Long Chen’s flame would be able to destroy the arm of a Heaven Saint.

Furthermore, as the frost and snow spread, they sensed flames burning in every speck of ice. It was both terrifyingly hot and chillingly cold.

It was like a mix of ice and fire—a power that could destroy the very world.

Luckily, it works.

Long Chen might look composed, but he secretly breathed a sigh of relief. He had tried to use astral energy to destroy this arm, only to find his efforts futile as he couldn't infuse his astral energy into it. He then tried to use dragon blood power to crush it, yet he found that a Heaven Saint’s physical body was too powerful.

Having assumed an unyielding stance, Long Chen had no choice but to summon forth the Ice Soul Divine Flame, Huo Linger’s strongest power.

Although the Sun Flame and Moon Flame were ranked above the Ice Soul, the Sun Flame and Moon Flame’s essence they had was not purer than that of the Ice Soul Divine Flame.

After all, Huo Linger’s Ice Soul Divine Flame possessed half the core of the true Ice Soul Divine Flame. Bing Po had split her essence with Huo Linger, condensing it into an Ice Soul seed. Sooner or later, it would grow to become the true Ice Soul Divine Flame.

As for the Moon Flames and Sun Flames that Huo Linger absorbed daily, their flame essence was mostly used to nourish the Ice Soul Divine Flame. That was why its growth was so terrifying.

At this moment, the Ice Soul Divine Flame did not disappoint Long Chen and managed to destroy the arm of a Heaven Saint. In other words, it had the ability to harm Heaven Saints.

“That flame, it can’t be! The Ice Soul Divine Flame?!”

“To be able to merge flames with ice to this extent, perhaps only the Ice Soul can do so.”

“What a terrifying existence! Long Chen’s trump cards keep coming out one after another!”

The onlookers were shocked when they realized what this flame was. No one had expected Long Chen to control the Ice Soul Divine Flame.

Long Chen’s power was like a bottomless well. Back when he fought Yue Wuxu, many anticipated a close match, only to realize that Yue Wuxu was nothing in front of Long Chen.

When a Mortal Saint appeared, people thought that Long Chen would finally lose. Yet, he annihilated the Mortal Saint in one blow. Similarly, when confronted by an Earth Saint, Long Chen swiftly vanquished him in ten exchanges.

The more they watched, the more they realized that Long Chen’s power was bottomless. In fact, even after all this fighting, his aura didn’t drop at all. He seemed like he was still in his peak condition. Seeing him, people finally understood what a true monster was.

“Long Chen!” the Heaven Saint of the Celestial race roared furiously, his hair standing on end like an enraged lion about to tear its prey apart.

Long Zhantian's devastating blow had inflicted grave wounds upon him, wounds that he had managed to temporarily suppress through the use of a secret art. If he directly returned to the Celestial race and asked for help, it was highly likely that he would be able to recover.

However, with his arm now destroyed, he was no longer complete. Even if he got the aid of the Celestial race’s experts, there was little they could do to fix him. His cultivation realm was on the brink of collapse, leaving him consumed by bitterness and remorse.

If only he hadn't been so reckless, he wouldn't find himself in this dire predicament. But in this world, regret was ultimately useless.

“Come and bite me then,” Long Chen taunted arrogantly, beckoning with a finger.

Blood once more sprayed out of the Heaven Saint’s mouth. With a sudden turn, he vanished without a trace. He could no longer suppress his wounds, so he had to return to the Celestial race’s headquarters. Otherwise, he might just lose his life.

Once he was gone, the spatial gate to the Celestial race vanished without a trace. There was no way for anyone to directly go over there anymore.

Even if the spatial gate opened again, against Bai Letian who wielded the High Firmament Divine Sword, the Celestial race’s experts still wouldn’t be able to let out a single fart.

At this moment, the various factions brought their disciples away. Quite a few of them felt so worshipful toward Long Chen that they wanted to greet him, but their elders simply dragged them away. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

“Do you think the phoenix flies along with sparrows? Does a dragon play with shrimp? Do you think you’re qualified to interact with that kind of monster? If you want to be friends with him, you must reach a suitable height first. Otherwise, what’s the point? Are you asking to be humiliated?”

Their words were hard to hear, but they were true. Long Chen was an existence that could even slay Earth Saints. Even though he was in the same generation as them, there was a massive gap between them.

“Keep working hard on cultivation? Otherwise, you won’t even be qualified to be friends? Don’t you know how wide the gap is?” A young nine star Doyen sighed sadly before leading his people away.

In his world, this nine star Doyen was a supreme heavenly genius, one who had united everyone in his world. But here, he felt like he had come to a boundless ocean; his little bit of power was unable to cause a ripple.

As many experts left, they were still in shock after witnessing what a true expert was. However, they also felt some hope because just like them, he wasn’t a native of the Sovereign Emperor Heaven. If Long Chen could do this, then why couldn’t they? Although their chances might be remote, that was better than no chance.

“Dean Long Chen, I trust that you’ve been well since we last met!” said Bai Letian as he smiled at Long Chen. The sharpness in his eyes had vanished, and he once more returned to his amicable self.

“Greetings, Dean Bai. Thank you for saving me. I didn’t expect you to have hidden your true power so deeply,” replied Long Chen. At this moment, he finally saw Bai Letian’s cultivation base—a true-blue Heaven Saint.

Back when Long Chen first met Bai Letian, the latter seemed like an Immortal King. Afterward, no matter how Long Chen grew, he was unable to see through Bai Letian’s cultivation base. Now, he finally understood just how terrifying this dean was.

At the same time, he was completely speechless. From top to bottom, the High Firmament Academy had been putting on an act. Thinking of how serious Bai Letian’s expression had been when he appeared in front of Enpuda with the High Firmament Divine Sword’s scabbard, Long Chen almost laughed.

To put it frankly, a single fart from Bai Letian would have been enough to crush Enpuda. Yet, he had acted so seriously. As expected, as people aged, they truly grew more cunning.

Bai Letian smiled and was about to speak when a group of people walked over to Long Chen’s side. Long Xihe and the others hastily bowed when they saw these people.

“Greetings, Heaven Overseer!”
