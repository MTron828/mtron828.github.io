Chapter 5005 Qin Feng vs. Ye Qing


Long Chen observed Ye Lingkong with a knowing look. He understood Ye Lingkong’s intentions perfectly—his aim wasn’t Qin Feng; it was Long Chen himself.

Ye Lingkong seemed extremely confident, suggesting he had some tricks up his sleeve. He knew well that challenging the head umpire was historically forbidden. The head umpire held the authority to disqualify anyone attempting such a challenge from the competition.

However, Ye Lingkong could use Qin Feng to provoke Long Chen, making Long Chen relinquish his position as the head umpire and challenge him instead.

“Hey, what are you talking about? You’re a Heavenly Chosen, a ranked heavenly genius of the Ye clan. Are you really going to challenge a five star Heavenly Doyen? Do you not have any shame?” One of the Jiang clan’s female disciples spoke up for Long Chen.𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

“I’m not the one challenging him. I will send a disciple of the Ye clan to fight him. And who said he was a five star Heavenly Doyen? He is clearly concealing his Doyen fluctuations. It can trick others, but it can’t trick me,” Ye Lingkong sneered.

Countless people turned to Qin Feng, who maintained his composure and simply gazed back at Ye Lingkong.

Ye Lingkong pressed on, his tone carrying a hint of provocation. “I’ve heard rumors of the Dragonblood Legion’s arrogance. Are they too afraid to accept a challenge from someone in the same realm?”

His words were clearly aimed at Long Chen, a deliberate provocation that even the most oblivious could discern.

Unperturbed, Long Chen continued to nonchalantly trim his fingernails with a knife. “That won’t do. Misusing my authority to gain advantages from public resources is unjustifiable.”

Perceiving Long Chen’s response as hesitation, a referee from the Ye clan immediately interjected, “Head Umpire, you’re mistaken. If there is a conflict, it should be resolved immediately. That is the only way to maintain a harmonious environment in this competition, don’t you think?”

Countless disciples erupted in applause at his words as Long Chen had said a similar thing before.

Acting like he was in a difficult position, Long Chen responded. “But what if someone gets seriously hurt? How can we maintain harmony then? I should warn you that the Dragonblood Legion’s warriors slaughtered their way out of mountains of corpses and seas of blood. When they fight, they aim to kill. I’m very worried about someone dying. I fear for lives being lost. Perhaps removing the threat is the wiser choice...”

“Are you a coward? If so, just admit it and we’ll leave it at that. I won’t force you. I’ll spare your subordinate’s dog life,” sneered Ye Lingkong.

Ye Lingkong was extremely rude, but his rude remarks were aimed at Qin Feng, not Long Chen, which left Long Chen without grounds to punish him.

However, Qin Feng maintained a slight smile, seemingly detached from the confrontation, while Long Ziwei beside him simmered with anger.

Long Chen sighed audibly, sensing Ye Lingkong's determination. “It seems you are dead set on doing this. Then I must ask all of you. If something goes wrong and the higher-ups demand an explanation…”

“Don’t worry, we all agree! If there are repercussions, all of us will take the blame!” interjected a referee.

The other referees nodded, signaling their willingness to shoulder any consequences of this fight. They all hoped for the Ye clan disciple to eliminate Qin Feng. That way, they could at least vent a bit. After all, being suppressed by a young disciple like Long Chen was extremely irritating to them.

“Qin Feng, what do you say?” asked Long Chen, feigning concern as he turned toward Qin Feng.

“This concerns the honor of the Dragonblood Legion, and I am willing to stake my life for our honor. If I perish on the martial stage, I can only blame myself and no one else. Boss, don’t grieve for me or seek revenge. A man must live with dignity. If it’s to defend the Dragonblood Legion’s glory, I will face death with no regrets,” declared Qin Feng passionately, looking determined to face death.

Qin Feng’s words stirred many present, particularly the mercenaries, who felt their blood heating up.

Long Chen himself was nearly moved to tears by Qin Feng’s impassioned speech. His power had risen, and his acting skills remained sharp as ever.

“Very well, then I shall activate the martial stage. Life and death are left to fate. No one can fault another. Ye Lingkong, who will fight from your side?” Long Chen turned to Ye Lingkong, awaiting his response.

As an icy-faced man with two swords on his back stepped forward, quite a few of the Ye clan’s disciples cried out in excitement.

Despite being only a nine star Doyen, he clearly commanded respect within the Ye clan, indicating his formidable strength.

“Ye clan’s Ye Qing seeks guidance. Let’s determine who is stronger, and let fate decide life and death,” the disciple declared confidently, announcing his name before stepping onto the stage.

Long Chen looked at Ye Qing with a touch of scorn. Ye Qing seemed to worry about Long Chen’s vengeance once he killed Qin Feng, so he said this first.

“Very well, let us see your true power on the martial stage! Activate the life-and-death martial stage!” proclaimed Long Chen.

Without delay, the referees swiftly initiated the activation. Qin Feng and Ye Qing were brought onto the martial stage quickly as if they were afraid of Long Chen reneging his decision.

As a screen of light rose, the referee quickly retreated. After all, the life-and-death martial stage required no referee.

“Quick, inform Big Sister Feng Fei! Tell her someone is bullying Long Chen and she needs to come!” urged one of the Jiang clan’s female disciples.

“There’s no need. I’ve already sent a message, so she’ll probably arrive soon.”

The female disciples continued their incessant chatter. From their expressions, they didn’t seem to have much confidence in Qin Feng.

With a calm expression, Qin Feng looked at Ye Qing from the other side of the barrier, not releasing his aura. He appeared nonchalant and unprepared for combat.

“Fool, do you think you can deceive me this way? I won’t fall for it,” sneered Ye Qing.

He believed Qin Feng was feigning weakness, akin to how Lin Hu had initially appeared weak only to turn the tide later. Hence, Ye Qing scoffed at Qin Feng for using the same act. 

BOOM!

Ye Qing’s manifestation appeared behind him, unleashing a powerful aura that startled even Long Ziwei. It was so strong that it was almost on Long Ziwei’s level. 

Drawing both swords, Ye Qing crouched low, resembling a coiled leopard ready to pounce. His posture suggested he would strike with lightning speed, leaving no opportunity for his opponent to react.

In an instant, the barrier separating them dissipated. With a shout, Ye Qing moved like a phantom, going in a strange arc on the martial stage. He instantly appeared behind Qin Feng.

“What?!”

Long Ziwei was stunned by the lightning-fast movement technique. It was so swift that even an experienced fighter of his caliber might have struggled to react in time.

“Die!” Ye Qing’s sinister smile widened as both swords thrust toward Qin Feng’s back like lethal fangs

Blood sprayed into the air. Just as Ye Qing’s swords were about to pierce Qin Feng’s back, Qin Feng dissolved into smoke. In a swift counterattack, a sword plunged through Ye Qing’s back, emerging from his chest.
