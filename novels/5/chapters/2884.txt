Chapter 2873 Unbound by Laws or Rules

This sudden attack came without any warning. It was a kind of formation. Once it was activated, space instantly froze.

Luo Bing, Luo Ning, Mu Qingyun, and the others were enveloped by a ray of divine light. Runes bound them, making them unable to move.

As for Long Chen, the instant that the light appeared, he instinctively retreated. He had no time to warn the others.

The net fell, its strings moving like serpents, wrapping around everyone. Other than Long Chen, everyone else was caught.

Long Chen’s heart shook. He suddenly realized that something was off. This was a place where flying boats were constantly coming and going. But now, it was empty.

He suddenly understood that Chu Kuang’s background was even greater than he had expected. Chu Kuang had actually managed to empty such a large and busy space in order to set up a trap for him. The Chu family was actually able to act so brazenly within the God Institute.

All of a sudden, a hand silently reached toward Long Chen, and a vortex of space appeared around him, slowing him down.

This was a terrifying Four Peak expert. With space in flux, he blocked all of Long Chen’s escape paths.

Long Chen was shocked and infuriated. The Chu family really didn’t care about any laws or rules. They actually prepared a sneak attack for him here.

In the face of this terrifying existence, he couldn’t dodge. He either let himself be captured, or he fought with his life on the line.

Since the other side dared to attack him so openly here, it was very possible that they intended to kill him as well. Then they would fabricate some accusations against him.

As a flame lotus suddenly appeared on Long Chen’s palm, the locking force lessened against him, and he temporarily regained his freedom.

He spun, his hand slamming toward his back. He then managed to see his attacker. It was a gloomy elder who had triangular eyes and a face covered in pockmarks.

The elder was surprised to see that Long Chen was able to move under his pressure. Just at that moment, the lotus flower on Long Chen’s palm flew off.

BOOM!

Flames exploded, unleashing giant ripples in space. After that, heat ignited the air.

Long Chen felt like his hand had struck hard iron. His palm quivered painfully, and his wrist was dislocated. An immense force then sent him flying.

As for the pockmarked elder, he was forced back three steps in the air. His palm was ignited by the flames and the sharp pain shocked him.

“Old bastard, just wait!” Long Chen’s sleeve had been blasted apart. Everyone could see rage and killing intent blazing in his eyes.

“You slaughtered fellow members of the academy! Now you’re offending your superiors as well, refusing to submit to your trial! There is no saving you. You can simply die!” The pockmarked elder also had killing intent in his eyes. He stepped toward Long Chen.

However, just as he moved, lightning erupted beneath Long Chen’s feet, and he jumped onto the flying boat. The door hadn’t been closed because normally there were people guarding the flying boats to prevent anyone without permission from taking them.

Long Chen rushed to the control panel and slammed his hand on a red button.

“You dare?!”

Countless runes lit up on the flying boat, making the elder’s expression completely change. Long Chen was actually unleashing all the power of the flying boat into a single attack. However, that attack wasn’t aimed at him but at the transportation formation.

“Is there anything in this world that Boss Long San doesn’t dare to do?” As Long Chen spoke, a ray of light shot out of the flying boat straight toward the transportation formation.

BOOM!

The transportation formation instantly exploded. Rubble and fragmented runes flew through the air.

This kind of minor transportation formation was so common in the academy that they numbered in the thousands. They were provided to the disciples to save time coming and going through the academy. They didn’t have much defensive power, so it was instantly destroyed.

The instant that the formation was destroyed, the entire academy shuddered. Alarms rang out. Just an instant later, the void twisted and countless figures appeared.

The High Firmament Academy’s transportation formations were all connected to a grand formation underground. With one destroyed, the alarm instantly drew the experts of the academy.

These experts emitted terrifying auras. In front of them, these disciples were as insignificant as ants. It was like a single gaze from them could wipe the disciples out.

“Damn. So the High Firmament Academy’s foundation is truly frightening.” Even Long Chen was shocked. The people that were appearing were all exceedingly terrifying existences above this Four Peak elder.

Furthermore, they all looked to still be middle-aged with powerful Blood Qi. They were like kings looking down on them.

These experts had grave and serious expressions as if they were prepared to face powerful enemies. They were already ready for battle, but when they looked around, they didn’t see any powerful enemies. They only saw a group of trapped outer academy disciples.

“What is going on here?” demanded one of them. He gloomily glared at the pockmarked elder. His tone was not at all courteous. Instead, it seemed enraged.

“Senior, it was-” The pockmarked elder was also terrified. He pointed at Long Chen, casting the responsibility onto him.

“I was the one who broke the transportation formation and drew seniors of the Battle God Palace out. I know that seniors are busy fighting in the devil domain, and I know that those who are resting in the academy are recuperating from their wounds. I shouldn’t disturb your recuperation, but there is someone so despicable that he is ignoring the academy’s rules to kill me and then cover it up. My cultivation base is too low to beat this bastard, but I’m also unwilling to just be killed. Thus, I could only come up with such a plan to make this matter bigger and have the higher-ups handle it and find justice for me.” Long Chen cupped his fists toward the man.

That man was startled, and he stared at Long Chen closely. He saw Long Chen’s tattered black robes, as well as the instructor plate on his waist. Such a combination was curious.

He suddenly laughed and nodded. “I understand.”

“Senior, don’t listen to his nonsense! He slaughtered innocent members of the academy! I-” The pockmarked elder was shocked to hear such a thing. He knew just how terrifying these people’s statuses were. If they believed Long Chen, then things would be over for him.

“Shut up!”

Another person in the air shouted, “Do you think that we’re as blind as you? We’re already clear on what kind of person this little fellow is, because we’re all the same.”

Mu Qingyun and the others were still unable to move, but they were stunned to see such powerful experts descend.

These terrifying existences said that Long Chen was the same as them? What was that?

“Where is the head of the Discipline Institute? Come out!” shouted that person, his voice resounding throughout the academy.
