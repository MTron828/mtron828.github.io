Chapter 2138 A New Collaboration

“What is it?” asked Yue Xihan. While the winged devil race was not continuing their attack, this was their chance to seal this channel.

For the winged devil race to reopen a new channel was very difficult. Even if they could manage it, the timeline would be several years into the future.

“We can’t. Without the threat of the winged devil race, the Magical Beasts will turn on us. We have to leave this channel. Only when there is profit can any relationship be steady,” said Long Chen.

“Alright, we aren’t skilled in this regard, so I’ll leave it to you,” said Yue Xihan. Perhaps it was because they had been stuck in the Skyscraping World for too long, but she wasn’t used to plotting like this.

Long Chen nodded and began communicating spiritually with the drake king. He gravely said, “This superior of mine has said that this channel was opened by the winged devil race, and we can’t break it. So it’ll be hard on you in the future. The winged devils will continue to attack you. You should prepare for a long-term battle.”

“They’ll return?” asked the drake king.

Long Chen nodded. “They won’t just return, they’ll bring even stronger members.”

The drake king fell silent. This was a bolt from the blue to it. It didn’t know how to face it.

Ask me for help, please? How am I supposed to start if you don’t ask? Long Chen waited for what felt like half the day, but the drake king didn’t say anything.

Finally, Long Chen had to take the initiative. “How about this? We can help you defend this channel. We can protect this world together. However, to protect this channel, we need some underground ores to build some tools. So can you stop these Magical Beasts from attacking us while we excavate the ores?”

That was Long Chen’s goal. He wanted the ores, but he also wanted the original devil race defending this location, because by slaying the winged devils, they could obtain devil cores to upgrade their divine seals. With the drake king’s approval, they could explore more of this world and find more ore deposits.

They didn’t know how old this world was, but it seemed that no one had ever extracted the minerals below the ground. It was unknown just how many resources there were to be found.

In comparison, the Martial Heaven Continent’s resources had been almost exhausted. Any small ore deposit would cause a huge fight.

Without the birth of new resources, the large powers were only fighting over what they had as their pockets grew tighter. If they could properly use this wild world, Long Chen would get an endless supply of resources.

“That probably won’t work.” The drake king shook its head.

Long Chen had been in the midst of thinking about how to further develop things when the drake king’s words extinguished those dreams. He felt a chill.

“Why not? Do you not want us to guard this channel?” In his view, this was a mutually beneficial agreement.

“It’s not that. Our bloodlines have regressed too far. To tell the truth, without your blood, my head would still be cloudy. All the Magical Beasts here are the same, and those who can maintain clear heads are few and far between. Even I am often attacked by others, so I have to kill a few every now and then. Those Magical Beasts can’t control themselves, and I also only rule over half of them. The strongest Magical Beasts of this world are not permitted to come here by me, because if they do, they won’t differentiate between friend or foe. Although I am the king of this place, I can’t control those Magical Beasts. Even if I agreed, it wouldn’t work. You saw it just now. Those Magical Beasts should have thanked you for saving us, but that feeling of gratitude was quickly overwhelmed by their instincts to kill you.”

Magical Beasts were Magical Beasts, wild and berserk. The drake king had only managed to become king through slaughter.

Although it was able to gather a portion of Magical Beasts to fight here, one reason was because its own pressure was present as it fought alongside them, while another reason was that Magical Beasts were warlike, so getting them to fight was comparatively easy. But getting them to not attack Long Chen and the others? Impossible.

Long Chen sighed with relief. As long as the drake king agreed, everything else could be handled.

“Then how about this? We will guard this channel and mine the ores. We won’t take the initiative to provoke any of you. But if your people take the initiative to harm us, can we kill them?” probed Long Chen.

“Of course. It would be best if you killed all those disobedient fellows. The thing is, do you have that power?” The drake king doubted that Long Chen could eliminate those Magical Beasts that threatened its position.

Compared to humans, these Magical Beasts were dumb. The drake king didn’t even think of the possibility that once all its fellow Magical Beasts were killed, it would be isolated. Long Chen said, “We can naturally handle them. All we need is your approval. I’ll draw out a region where you tell your subordinates not to attack us. As for those who don’t listen, I’ll help you teach them a lesson, making your position even more stable here. Do you trust me?”

“I trust you,” said the drake king.

“Why?”

“Your bloodline is very noble. We should listen to your orders.”

Long Chen was a bit startled. He suddenly looked into the drake king’s eyes and saw a faint blood-colored dragon mark.

“Oh? You aren’t a drake. You should be called a member of the dragon race.” That mark was natural. It could not be acquired.

“It must have true dragons amongst its ancestors, but their bloodline regressed, going from dragon to drake. This is the consequence of mixing multiple bloodlines,” said Yue Xihan.

A serpent could transform into a python, a python could transform into a drake, and a drake could transform into a true dragon. But a dragon could also regress if its bloodline power faded, transforming back into a drake, and even going all the way back into a serpent.

“How regretful,” sighed Long Chen. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

“That’s also why its power stands at the peak of the twelfth rank but it cannot take that final step. Its bloodline limits it from breaking through that final barrier,” said Yue Xihan.

Long Chen nodded. Turning back to the drake king, he said, “Don’t worry, I possess the bloodline of the true dragon. You can sense my sincerity. We won’t let you suffer a loss in this cooperation. Later on, I will try to think of some way to stimulate your bloodline and allow you to break your shackles, transforming from a drake to a dragon of the thirteenth rank.”

Hearing that, the drake king trembled with excitement. It immediately thanked Long Chen. It had been stuck at this barrier for many years. It had lost hope of such a thing, but it trusted Long Chen. Perhaps it was because it had never been tricked in its life, or due to the true dragon bloodline, but it didn’t doubt Long Chen’s words at all.

Long Chen had the drake king deliver its proclamation to its subordinate Magical Beasts. He and Yue Xihan then returned to the channel. Yue Xihan said, “Youngsters have some interesting ideas. Like this, we’ll really be killing two birds with one stone. We’re clearly the ones benefiting, but they’re grateful to us.”

“It’s not like it’s not mutually beneficial. Without us, this entire world might have been destroyed by those winged devils,” said Long Chen. “Now we can really start mining. I’ll send over a portion of the Dragonblood Legion to guard against any attacks from Magical Beasts. We’ll also need to start some large-scale arrangements for these two channels. The drake king has said that this region will surely be safe from Magical Beasts’ attacks. So we only need to set up some basic protections against them just in case. The rest should be entirely focused on building devil-slaying formations.”

“Defending against Magical Beasts isn’t our specialty, but when it comes to slaying the devil race, we have our natural talents. There won’t be a problem.” Yue Xihan smiled. The original devil race finally got a chance to show their glory after being bullied for so many years.

The entire original devil race was invigorated after this battle. They had finally experienced just how effective the devil-slaying arts they had practiced and drilled for countless years were.

“I’ll immediately call over Guo Ran and Xia Chen to start things off, and you can arrange the elites of your race here. These two channels will be the hope of our future. Have the winged devils die without one being able to return,” said Long Chen.

These two channels were bait for the devil race’s experts to come. As long as the original devil race could slaughter them all before they could return to report, these two channels would be cornucopias for the original devil race.

Yue Xihan examined the two channels. The strongest devils that could pass through were the devils of the winged devil king race. No stronger races could enter. Hence, defending this channel shouldn’t be very difficult. The only thing that made her worry was the Magical Beasts.

Two days later, Xia Chen, Guo Ran, Gu Yang, and three thousand members of the Dragonblood Legion arrived.

Seeing three thousand people with awakened manifestations made Yue Xihan jump in shock. The current Dragonblood Legion was shockingly powerful.

When Guo Ran and Xia Chen learned that this wild world’s ores could be mined as they pleased, they almost went crazy with delight. Without a word, they got to work.

This entire wild area immediately became bustling with activity. Long Chen didn’t slack off either. He had to start refining pills again.
