Chapter 1952: 1952

The ancient war carriage was pulled by a ferocious Magical Beast . It was a nine-colored flying horse

“A mid twelfth rank Magical Beast!”

The Netherpassage experts’ expressions changed . This nine-colored celestial horse was comparable to Netherpassage experts of the second step . It might even possess the power to one-shot early Netherpassage experts, but such a terrifying Magical Beast was actually pulling a carriage for someone .

Divine runes flowed on top of the carriage, causing space to twist . It was clearly a powerful divine item in its own right .

A giant man walked off from the carriage . He held a blood-colored halberd .

“Wasn’t the Qilin Battle Halberd damaged in the Yin Yang World?” Whispers rang out as people recognized this person to be the Xuan Beasts’ genius, True Immortal Jiaoqi .

What they didn’t know was that the Qilin Battle Halberd was a special weapon of the qilin-drake race . There were actually nine of them, eight held by the Elders with the greatest authority in the race, while one was bestowed to the genius with the greatest potential .

True Immortal Jiaoqi had been bestowed that Qilin Battle Halberd, but it had been broken by Leng Yueyan’s bone sword . Now he held one that only Elders were qualified to use, and it was even stronger .

True Immortal Jiaoqi had advanced to the second Heavenstage of Life Star . Not only had he been given the most powerful halberd, but he also had the Qilin War Chariot . Those two divine items were the strongest weapons possessed by the qilin-drake race .

He still refused to accept his defeat from last time . If he had possessed such powerful weapons at that time, he might not have lost to Leng Yueyan . With them, he had come to take his revenge against Long Chen and Leng Yueyan .

However, Leng Yueyan was already set to be executed, so he had no chance to get his revenge from her . That was why he was searching all over for Long Chen . When he heard that he was in the Eastern Xuan City, he immediately rushed over here .

The nine-colored horse was as quick as lightning, second only to the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow in terms of speed . However, he was still one step too slow because Long Chen had already left .

Not seeing Long Chen, he saw the brawl down below and he shouted, “Tell me, where did Long Chen go?”

“Why would I have to tell you?” The one who true Immortal Jiaoqi had picked out was actually the man that had just rebelled against his father . He was still rebellious .

“Inferior human race, die!”

True Immortal Jiaoqi suddenly pointed a single finger . A burst of wind shot over .

Within that burst of wind could be heard the faint cry of a qilin and drake . The young man suddenly found that he was unable to move . The Heavenly Dao energy that he relied on had been stripped away from him .

“Watch out!”

It was his father who shot into motion, appearing in front of him and raising a divine item .

Bang!

That quasi divine item exploded, and True Immortal Jiaoqi’s attack struck the father in the shoulder, turning it into a mass of blood and flesh .

“Dad!” the young man shouted, his eyes red . He wanted to charge out and attack, but he was too weak to even move under True Immortal Jiaoqi’s pressure .

“Just half-step Netherpassage . I’ll send you two on your way . ” True Immortal Jiaoqi instantly saw through the father’s cultivation base . If it weren’t for that divine item, the two of them would have already died . He unleashed an identical attack with his finger, but this time it was even more powerful .

“Dad!”

“True Immortal Jiaoqi, just what do you think you’re doing?!” Furious roars rang out amongst the crowd, but True Immortal Jiaoqi ignored them, a cruel smile on his face .

As for the father, there was some kind of powerful energy on his mangled shoulder that was trying to wreck the rest of his body . He didn’t have the power to resist .

He was very unwilling . He wanted to save his son at the very least, but he was powerless . In front of absolute power, everything was useless .

Bang!

Just as the father and son were about to be killed, a palm blocked the attack in front of them .

“What?!” Everyone was startled . True Immortal Jiaoqi had already advanced to the Life Star realm and controlled world energy . Just who was capable of so easily brushing aside his attack?

They hastily focused, seeing a young man standing there . Behind him was a giant die slowly spinning .

“It’s Hu Feng! The heir of the Gambling Heavenly Dao!”

That die was a sign of who he was and the special divine item that only the Gambling Heavenly Dao possessed .

“Hu Feng, what are you doing here? Does the Gambling Heavenly Dao want to stand by Long Chen and become enemies with the rest of the world?” demanded True Immortal Jiaoqi .

There were many legends of the Gambling Heavenly Dao . However, in actual history, there were only a few records of any fights against them . True Immortal Jiaoqi’s battle intent began to rise .

Hu Feng shook his head . “What am I doing here? Why act stupid? Do you really think others don’t know how many despicable acts your side has done in the name of hunting Long Chen? The Gambling Heavenly Dao might not interfere with the rest of the world, but I really can’t bear to just keep watching . Is bullying the weak really so satisfying? Oh, also, don’t get so arrogant as to think that your so-called alliance can represent the entire world . ”

The ancient races, the Corrupt path, the Xuan Beasts, all the groups that were no longer harmonious with the Righteous path claimed to be hunting down Long Chen . But behind that mask, just how many other experts had they killed because they were suspected of harboring Long Chen?

The entire continent was covered in a storm, with many talented disciples no longer even daring to leave their sects . They didn’t know when they might disappear for no reason .

Most of the factions on the continent had seen it happen, but the majority did not dare to get angry or say anything . They chose to endure to protect themselves .

Now that True Immortal Jiaoqi had appeared, their suppressed anger flared . They knew that the Xuan Beasts and the others were doing this deliberately .

“What a joke . Anything that happens is all due to Long Chen . If he wasn’t hiding and dared to take responsibility for his own actions, how could so many people have been implicated by him?” sneered True Immortal Jiaoqi .

Hu Feng smiled faintly . “I’m not here to talk reason with you . If talking reason actually worked, there wouldn’t be war, and there wouldn’t be cultivation . Long Chen is already gone . You’re too late . Even with this nine-colored horse, you can’t catch up, so you should leave . The Gambling Heavenly Dao’s disciples don’t like to meddle with other people’s business, but if you go too far, I’ll have to stop you . ”

“Stop me? Good, then let me see whether or not you have that ability . I’ve heard that the Gambling Heavenly Dao is miraculous . Hopefully, you won’t disappoint me . ” True Immortal Jiaoqi pointed his Qilin Battle Halberd at Hu Feng, killing intent appearing in his eyes . He had clearly been waiting for these words .

“Why bother? Aren’t you being so oppressive because you hope someone will counterattack and you will have an excuse to start a fight? Last time, alliance head Qu Jianying didn’t let you have this excuse, so you’ve resorted to this . You really leave us with no leeway . Even neutral factions have become your chess pieces . It seems you wish to disturb the deep waters of the Martial Heaven Continent . I really can’t understand what your goal is . ” Hu Feng shook his head .

After hearing this, a few disciples’ hearts hook . Only now did they learn that Qu Jianying had expelled Long Chen to avoid a war throughout the entire continent . Their sect masters had never mentioned this to them .

“That’s enough nonsense . Come out and fight!” True Immortal Jiaoqi flew out of the city, while his horse also flew away with him . They were so fast that others couldn’t track them .

True Immortal Jiaoqi was a giant whose arm was thicker than Hu Feng’s whole body . On the other hand, Hu Feng was slender and looked like he might be blown away if true Immortal Jiaoqi blew on him . If it weren’t for the giant die behind him, others wouldn’t even think he was a cultivator . ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

“Die!”

Once Hu Feng walked over, True Immortal Jiaoqi immediately attacked and shot through the air . The point of his finger had shocked people with their power, and now that he was using his halberd, the Heavenly Daos rumbled .

“Life Star Empyreans are capable of using world energy, while Xuan Beasts can combine the power of their bloodline with their world energy, giving them even greater power,” said a Netherpassage expert of the Righteous path .

“That’s right . In the Life Star realm, the Xuan Beasts and ancient races have a natural advantage . The human race only takes back the advantage in the Netherpassage realm involving comprehension . I wonder whether this heir of the Gambling Heavenly Dao is as amazing as the legends say . If not, he really might die,” said another elder .

BOOM!

True Immortal Jiaoqi’s halberd finally struck, but it stopped right in front of Hu Feng who still had his hands clasped behind him . In front of him was a giant domino that was blocking the halberd .

“What is that?”
