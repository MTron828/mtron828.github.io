Chapter 2445 Spies

Translator: BornToBe

“What?”

Everyone present was startled. Did they really have spies amongst them?

The Dragonblood warriors came to a sudden understanding. No wonder this sudden attack had felt so strange. Even now, they didn’t know how their enemies had managed to find them.

The Dragonblood warriors were closer than brothers, so they hadn’t considered this possibility. Now everyone was filled with indignation.

“I’m sorry. I, Zhang Zhengfeng, can only use my death to apologize.”

Suddenly, one person walked out. Upon seeing him, quite a few people were shocked. Those people were rather familiar with him.

“Zhang Zhengfeng, you… you… How could you do this to your sect? What about senior apprentice-sister Lingshan’s trust?!” One of his close friends pointed his sword at him, his eyes red. It was precisely due to how close they were that he was unable to accept this.

Zhang Zhengfeng bitterly smiled. “All those things are meaningless now. No excuse can make up for my sin.” He then suddenly knelt toward Long Chen. “Senior apprentice-brother Long Chen, I entrust everything to you.”

Zhang Zhengfeng slammed his own head with his hand, and his body collapsed. He had shattered his soul.

“You fool, why?!” The disciple who had pointed his sword at him openly wept.

“Zhang Zhengfeng was a man. But there are some who are really despicable.” Long Chen suddenly pointed his finger.

One person in the crowd twitched. Before he could say anything though, his head was pierced by a lightning arrow.

“Senior apprentice-brother Long Chen-!”

Another person tried to speak, but Long Chen snorted. Now it was too late.

Another lightning arrow flew out, killing him.

“There were a total of four traitors. One of them was killed in the chaos. Of the remaining three, one could count as a man and admitted his sins. He can count as having atoned. Those who know them should gather their corpses for their families,” said Long Chen. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

“Boss, what is going on?” asked a Dragonblood warrior.

“When I killed the ringleaders, I investigated a portion of their memories in their fragmented souls. So I knew about the traitors, but I can’t blame them. Their families were being used as hostages to control them. If the person you cared the most had their life in someone else’s hand, what would you choose? So this matter can end here. As for them, you can tell their families that they died in a battle between the Righteous and Corrupt paths. After all, in the eyes of their families, they are their pride. But for us, although we can sympathize, we cannot forgive them. Death is their best choice,” said Long Chen helplessly.

These traitors had caused thousands of deaths. But while they felt immense hatred for them, people were unable to fully blame them. If their positions were switched, what would they choose?

“Who did it? We have to avenge them,” said someone hatefully.

So many people had died. They had to extract a price from someone. Compared to these four traitors, the ones who had caused this were the ones extorting them.

“Based on their memories, I wasn’t able to find out the entire truth. But it will be revealed soon,” said Long Chen.

Long Chen suspected that it was done by Di Feng, but there was no concrete proof. He didn’t want to immediately accuse him, because he was sure that the truth would be revealed in just a short time.

“Clean up the battlefield. I want to be ready to move out again within half an incense stick’s worth of time,” ordered Long Chen.

After giving orders, Long Chen took out the compass and began to search for other groups of Dragonblood warriors. He found three other groups that were getting closer. Most likely, they had rushed over upon receiving the distress signal.

“Boss!”

The first group quickly arrived with their original group of fifty thousand. They were delighted to see Long Chen but shocked to see the corpses.

This group hadn’t encountered any attacks yet. In fact, things had been going very smoothly. They had killed a Scarlet Blood Drake, allowing them to obtain quite a bit of dragon blood.

That dragon blood was actually of a decent quality. It wasn’t rejected by the evil dragon essence blood in their veins, and they believed that it was possible for them to refine it. However, they hadn't done that yet. They were waiting for Long Chen’s approval to do so.

Long Chen explained what had happened, causing their expressions to change. Long Chen announced, “There is no going back from certain things once you’ve done them. The previous three people are the best example. I know there must be people that are being controlled in every group. You still have time, so come out now.”

The disciples of the Martial Heaven Alliance looked at each other. The atmosphere instantly grew tense.

“Senior apprentice-brother Long Chen, they aren’t just threatening my family. They put a slave seal on my soul. I-”

One disciple nervously stepped forward. He had only spoken halfway when black lines spread across his face like a wriggling centipede. Startled cries rang out.

Long Chen snorted and pointed a finger. His Spiritual Strength surged out, and this sinister mark spread across his arm. Long Chen actually absorbed the curse.

“Senior apprentice-brother Long Chen!” cried out that disciple.

Lightning suddenly flickered across his arm, causing the mark to fade away. When it was about to vanish, Long Chen suddenly stopped.

He allowed the mark to grow back, and then he sealed it in one place.

Long Chen felt that destroying these curses might be sensed by their enemies. But sealing them shouldn’t raise an alarm. In any case, they were unable to threaten him.

Seeing him so easily handle the curse seal, over ten people stepped forward.

“Don’t say anything. Eat this pill first. Its medicinal energy will temporarily stay within your souls, but don’t activate it. Once you activate it, it will destroy the curse, and that might be sensed by the other side. We’ll have to beat them at their own game. As for your families, don’t worry. As long as we’re alive, no one will dare to touch them,” said Long Chen.

He hadn’t expected there to be seventeen people here being controlled, so he distributed medicinal pills to them. This kind of spiritual curse was unable to cause him any trouble.

At that time, the other two close groups arrived. Long Chen once more explained, and another batch of experts stepped forward for him to give them medicinal pills.

In order to be safe, Long Chen unleashed his spiritual pressure and questioned whether or not there were more traitors. As a result, two people were unable to endure the pressure and cracked. They were immediately killed by Long Chen.

Those people weren’t being controlled; they were true spies. There was no need to keep them. Their souls had restrictions that would cause their souls to shatter if they were investigated.

The four groups were now united, with two thousand Dragonblood warriors and one hundred and eighty thousand experts of the Martial Heaven Alliance. Although they didn’t have any top experts guiding them, they were no longer worried about an attack.

“Join our compasses together to spread the word,” said Long Chen.

It went without saying that Xia Chen and Guo Ran were geniuses. Their compasses could be linked together by multiple users to be able to sense others better. It could even transmit some simple information.

The fact that there were traitors made Long Chen sigh inside. It seemed that Ye Lingshan hadn’t done a good enough job. Or perhaps the people that she entrusted felt that others would also be sincere.

However, in such a giant group, who could guarantee that no one had been bought? Even if that wasn’t the case, it didn’t represent that everyone was of one heart.

Long Chen hadn’t had time to deal with such a thing, nor had he thought that Ye Lingshan would make such a mistake. As a result, things were going badly.

Originally, Long Chen was planning on using the tools that the spies were using to sniff them all out, but he found that the other side was very crafty. He was unable to sense where their enemies were, as the communication tools that they had were only one way and used for sending information to their enemies.

“Whatever. Wasting time with the weaklings isn’t worth it.” Long Chen shook his head. If they just waited around, they would waste too much time. Hunting down their ambushers would use up too much of their valuable time here.

They did their best to transmit the information as far as possible, but it was unknown if it was received. Those people only had one compass that was unable to reply to them at such a distance. It was up to luck.

“Curious. If they didn’t enter at the same time as us, why would they appear here?” asked one person suspiciously.

“Do they have maps? They were looking for a specific spot, and they just happened to run into us?”

“That’s not likely, right? No one has a map of the Star Field Divine World.”

“A map?” Long Chen nodded. “The Martial Heaven Alliance doesn’t have, but perhaps ancient existences like the everlasting families possess some information. However, there is one power in particular that has a complete map of the Star Field Divine World.”

“The divine families?”

Everyone’s expressions changed. Could it be…?
