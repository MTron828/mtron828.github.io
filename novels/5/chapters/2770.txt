Chapter 2759 Ling Yunzi vs. Gui Si

“Master!”

Ling Yunzi looked at Yue Zifeng. “I told you last time, a sword cultivator cannot have fear in his heart. You attacked so forcibly because you didn’t have the confidence to win. The moment you thought about stalling instead of winning, you already lost. A sword is a double-edged blade. Whether it harms the enemy or yourself is decided by just a thought. With every move, you must seek to defeat your enemy. If your heart holds fears, it’s like your sword is sheathed. If your sword is buried, it is impossible to comprehend the true essence of the Sword Dao. You only wanted to stall for Long Chen, and so you fell from the Sword Dao. No matter how powerful the enemy is, as long as your sword is in your hand, you can forget everything else. The only way that you are inferior to me right now is that you forget your sword. Remember these words. They are my final lesson to you.”

Yue Zifeng respectfully said, “Disciple understands. I will follow master’s teachings.” Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

Yue Zifeng was aware of why he had been defeated so quickly. It was because he hadn’t thought that he could beat Gui Si. Long Chen had told him that this was an existence that had fought against Sovereign Zi Yang for three days and nights, and that naturally worried him.

Just like Ling Yunzi said, a sword that was sheathed could not unleash its sharpness. How was he supposed to fight like this? It was a major taboo of sword cultivation.

“So it was you.” Gui Si retreated and his arm quickly healed. He stared in shock at Ling Yunzi.

Previously, he had chased away Mo Nian and the others, and had been baited into coming to the Martial Heaven Continent. At that time, a sword had suddenly slashed out of the void, destroying his body.

Now that he was struck by his sword again, he instantly recognized this sword will. The one who had attacked him that day was also Ling Yunzi.

What shocked Gui Si was that Ling Yunzi was not young or old. He was not a talented genius from this era, nor was he some old monster. He had clearly missed his golden period of cultivation, so how had he progressed to this level?

“Yes, it was me. I heard that you previously fought Sovereign Zi Yang. I’m not very talented, but I hope to see what great techniques you used to fight against him.”

Ling Yunzi stepped forward and slashed his sword. No shocking phenomenon occurred, no manifestation appeared behind him, and no rumbling rang out. It was a slash that was as light as a feather, but it caused Gui Si’s expression to completely change.

“The support of a divine Dao?! Impossible!” Gui Si cried out and waved his staff. A giant bone claw appeared in the sky, smashing toward Ling Yunzi.

That giant bone claw was then cut in two by Ling Yunzi’s sword like tofu.

After that, the broken claw fell to the ground, causing the earth to shake. A wave of dust rose.

As quick as lightning, Ling Yunzi appeared right in front of Gui Si, once more slashing his sword. This sword encompassed every direction. Although there was no lock, it was unavoidable.

His sword then landed on Gui Si’s staff and divine light exploded, devouring the heavens.

“The power of a divine Dao!”

A divine Dao was not a kind of power that belonged to this world. It was also a transcendent power, and it shattered the laws of heaven and earth.

“An expert has no fear. Fear indicates that you don’t have enough confidence in yourself. If you lack confidence, your mind is not resolute. If you are not resolute, your sword will is flimsy. With a flimsy sword will, how will you match the Sword God’s radiance? With the Sword God’s light supporting you, you can go to heaven or hell, slay demons or devils. The sword sweeps everything before it. What is the point of fear?”

Ling Yunzi’s voice rang out for Yue Zifeng to hear. The reason that Yue Zifeng had been defeated was not that he wasn’t strong enough, but due to his own heart being clouded by worries and fear. If he kept this kind of heart, there would be no way for him to resonate with his sword any longer.

During their recent seclusion, Ling Yunzi had passed down an extremely profound heart technique of the Sword Dao to Yue Zifeng. It was a technique that resonated with a divine Dao. To comprehend it, a sword cultivator had to have faith, and their faith was in the Sword God. But it was different from other inheritances.

Sword cultivators did not worship a statue nor did they kowtow to a god. Instead, they used their sword to peer into the heavens. Once they reached the required realm, they would naturally feel the power of that divine Dao. They would then be able to draw that power into their bodies and use their sword to cleave apart other Daos.

The Sword God was prideful. Other gods required faith energy and worship, but he disdained gathering faith energy from lower planes. He also didn’t teach anyone. However, when a person’s realm in the Sword Dao reached a certain level, they could sense the power of his divine Dao. They could then absorb it without restrictions.

Through Ling Yunzi’s pointers, Yue Zifeng finally understood why he had not been able to sense that power even after being taught how to. It was because he wasn’t confident enough and was still unable to become one with his sword.

Yue Zifeng slowly closed his eyes, gathering his mind. As Ling Yunzi fought, Yue Zifeng attuned himself to that power.

Ling Yunzi’s sword danced. Every strike appeared simple and plain, however, when they struck Gui Si’s staff, it was like a star had exploded. An apocalyptic power erupted.

Ling Yunzi’s sharp attacks forced Gui Si further and further back. The latter had no ability to retaliate.

Their battle drew the attention of countless experts. Not many people knew of Ling Yunzi, but now that he appeared, he gave them a surge in morale.

The old man, Qu Jianying, Li Tianxuan, and the other senior experts also participated in the battle. Right now, the Heaven Splitting Divine Sect and the Xuantian Dao Sect’s disciples joined forces. The Xuantian Tower blazed with divine light, suppressing the invaders. Meanwhile, Hua Shiyu, Zhao Ziyan, Mu Qingxuan, Su Mo, and the others fought beneath the protection of the Xuantian Tower.

The Heaven Splitting Divine Sect’s disciples were even more aggressive. Bao Buping and Chang Hao led the disciples in unleashing waves of Split the Heavens. The eighth form was used as if it cost nothing, and they would occasionally use the ninth form.

With the support of the Heaven Splitting Divine Tablet, all the Heaven Splitting Divine Sect’s disciples entered the Heavens’ Wrath state, which gave them terrifying power.

Due to Meng Qi and the others refining so many pills, they ended up with a few extra that could be given away. From it, the Heaven Splitting Divine Sect’s disciples had gotten a large share.

These disciples almost never consumed medicinal pills, so their bodies had yet to build up resistance from consuming too many pills. Since this was the case, the effect was several times greater for them. They had over thirty thousand disciples who had reached the ninth Heavenstage, while Bao Buping and Chang Hao had advanced to the Venerate realm.

They were like a killing machine on this battlefield, sweeping through their enemies. Other than the Dragonblood Legion, they were the strongest group.

Mo Nian, Wilde, and Ye Zhiqiu had supreme divine items. The invading armies were unable to get past them no matter how they threw their numbers at them. However, the Emperors were still just standing to the side, so Mo Nian and the others started to feel uneasy.

“Long Chen, something’s wrong. They seem to be waiting for something,” said Evilmoon.
