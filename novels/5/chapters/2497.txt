Chapter 2487 Taking the Divine Bones

“The divine bones have appeared!”

Everyone was delighted and tried to take the divine bones. However, the explosion of the barrier was still unleashing waves of power. Some people even coughed up blood from trying to charge through those waves.

Only Long Chen was able to pierce through that wave to grab one of the divine bones.

Feng Fei’s gaze turned cold. Long Chen’s power wasn’t enough to fight her currently, so he had given up on Zhao Ritian.

“The divine bones belong to the divine families!” shouted Feng Fei.

“Are they yours just because you say so? Then I say that the entire universe is mine,” sneered Long Chen, ignoring her.

Feng Fei panicked. She swung her sword at the flame prison, only for it to twist slightly. She didn’t manage to break it, and the flames continued to burn intensely.

Inside the flame prison, Zhao Ritian had no more power to speak. It was unknown if he was even alive, so Feng Fei’s panic grew. Long Chen was truly sinister. This flame prison was both tough and flexible. Breaking it would take quite a bit of time.

If she wanted to instantly break it, she would have to kill Long Chen. But Long Chen was refusing to fight directly against her and went for the divine bones instead.

If she tried to kill Long Chen, he would dodge her. Even in his weakened state, he wasn’t someone she could kill quickly.

At that time, Zhao Ritian would definitely be dead. Feng Fei couldn’t just watch as he was killed, so she needed to destroy the Heaven Trapping Flame Prison. But then the divine bones would fall into Long Chen’s hands. No matter what she did, Long Chen would be the winner. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

“This damn Zhao Ritian!”

Feng Fei wished Zhao Ritian had died earlier. If he had just listened to her and not been so arrogant, Long Chen wouldn’t necessarily have become enemies with them over the divine bones.

BANG!

One explosion came from Feng Fei striking the Heaven Trapping Flame Prison. Another explosion came from the divine bones. Long Chen had just been about to touch the first divine bone when a foot-thick barrier of light forced his hand back.

“There’s another layer of defense!” Long Chen was startled. “Not good, I used up too much of my dragon blood energy. I can’t obtain the barrier’s approval.”

This barrier was set up by the dragon king. If Long Chen could use the dragon blood energy from the dragon king, he would be able to take the dragon bones directly.

However, his dragon blood energy had been used up in his fight against Zhao Ritian. This barrier no longer recognized him.

Seeing that Long Chen was forced back, Feng Fei calmed down. She repeatedly attacked the flame prison, every one of her blows causing the world to tremble.

As people were shocked at Feng Fei’s power, they were also shocked at the flame prison’s power. What kind of magical art could repeatedly block a Sovereign sprout’s attacks?

They were unaware that the flame prison was being supported by the Nirvana Scripture, meaning that this entire world’s flame energy was supporting it. Feng Fei was currently trying to break the entire world’s flame energy.

This was also why someone like Zhao Ritian could be trapped inside. Only those personally experiencing this attack would know just how powerful it was.

Feng Fei was truly powerful. With each of her attacks, she exhausted a portion of the flame energy. It was unknown what kind of power she was using.

“Big brother Long Chen, she’s too powerful. This world doesn’t have enough flame energy, so I can’t stop her much longer!” transmitted Huo Linger.

“It’s fine. Don’t force yourself. Once this world’s flame energy is exhausted, release him. Don’t harm your source,” replied Long Chen.

Huo Linger was at too much of a disadvantage facing Feng Fei alone. After all, the enemy was a Sovereign sprout. Long Chen didn’t want Huo Linger to risk herself.

The other experts were also trying to take the divine bones, but they were unable to charge through the waves of power as quickly as him. They were doing their best to get closer.

“That’s right!” Long Chen suddenly took out the bone tile, using it. This was the bone tile that had absorbed the dragon king’s essence blood stone.

As a result, the light barrier around the divine bone grew gentle, and it didn’t force Long Chen back. Long Chen finally managed to grab the divine bone. Without a second glance, Long Chen tossed it into the primal chaos space and shot toward the second divine bone.

“What?! Long Chen already obtained a divine bone?!”

“The barrier’s power is weakening!”

The other experts’ eyes reddened. Those divine bones could be considered a step toward becoming a god or immortal. Furthermore, after taking one, the barrier’s power had weakened considerably.

They crazily charged forward, but while they were still several hundred meters away, they were unable to get any closer. That made them roar helplessly. The difference in power was too great. Despite the divine bones being right in front of them, they didn’t have the power to take them. That feeling of powerlessness made them feel like weeping.

BOOM!

Flames exploded. Feng Fei finally shattered the Heaven Trapping Flame Prison, and Zhao Ritian’s black body appeared.

Feng Fei suddenly slammed her foot on his body, causing him to explode. Everyone jumped.

After putting in all that work to save him, her only goal had been to personally kill him? Had this world gone crazy?

Just at this moment, Long Chen managed to grab the second divine bone and shot off toward the third one. The barrier’s power weakened once more, but most of the experts had given up their desire to fight for the divine bones.

It was because Feng Fei was now charging over furiously. Whether or not they could grab one of the divine bones, they wouldn’t have a chance to enjoy it anyway.

Feng Fei hesitated between the third and fourth divine bones. Instead of going directly at Long Chen, she charged toward the fourth one. She would get one first before anything else.

If she chased after Long Chen and he managed to take the third and fourth divine bones, she would gain nothing on the off chance that she was unable to kill him.

“This divine bone is mine.”

Just at that moment, a white-robed figure charged over, fighting against Feng Fei over the fourth divine bone.

Everyone was shocked. Just who would dare to fight Feng Fei over the divine bone? When they saw who it was, a startled cry rang out from everyone.

“The Pill Fairy!”

It was the Pill Fairy Yu Qingxuan. No one had seen her before, so she had to have just arrived.

The dragon nest’s interior was like a maze. It wasn’t necessarily the strongest bunch that would arrive here first.

As for why Feng Fei and Zhao Ritian were able to reach this place so quickly, it was because they had a map.

The Pill Fairy’s arrival made Feng Fei coldly shout, “The divine bones here belong to the divine families. It has nothing to do with you, so scram!”

Feng Fei was truly angry now. Zhao Ritian had lost to Long Chen, and Long Chen had taken two divine bones. Moreover, she wasn’t confident in being able to force them out of him. Now all she wanted was one divine bone, but someone else actually dared to interfere.

“All things in this world were created by the gods, so they belong to the gods. As a divine daughter, they are mine,” retorted the Pill Fairy icily.

The Pill Fairy was blazing with divine light. Her very voice caused heaven and earth to echo her, as if responding to her.

Long Chen’s heart shook. After not seeing her for so long, the Pill Fairy’s divine energy had grown even more powerful. Her spiritual fluctuations had also transformed.

A sharp pain wracked his heart. The original Pill Fairy was already dead, or perhaps it should be said that she had been taken over by this divine energy. There wasn’t a single part of her left.

As the pain wracked his heart, flames of fury rose inside of him toward Lord Brahma and Fallen Daynight. They had actually turned the kind Pill Fairy into a puppet.

Long Chen grabbed the third divine bone. After obtaining three, he didn’t go over to the fourth one, nor did he go help Mo Nian.

Instead, he just stood there, summoning his divine ring to help him recover. He watched the fight between Feng Fei and the Pill Fairy.

“You lowly wench, you’re courting death!” Feng Fei furiously swung her sword at the Pill Fairy.

“Blaspheming a divine daughter is disrespect to the gods. You’re the one courting death.” The Pill Fairy snorted and waved her hand. Pill Valley’s divine item, the Daynight Furnace, appeared in the air.

BOOM!

Feng Fei’s sword slashed into the Daynight Furnace, sending it flying. Space collapsed, and it was possible to see a black space appear devouring everything inside of it. Everyone hastily retreated from it, afraid of being sucked into the chaotic flow of space.

Feng Fei’s expression changed as she was also knocked back by the Daynight Furnace. She shouted, “Assimilating with divine energy is still a form of external power. It will never reach the peak.”

Feng Fei held her sword with both hands, and a ray of light shot out of her forehead, illuminating it. Her manifestation grew, and the fierce beast unleashed an ancient aura.

Feng Fei’s aura completely transformed. After that, she slashed her sword, unleashing a harsh streak of sword-light.

“Power is power. There is no external or internal power as long as you can control it. As for reaching the peak, it doesn’t matter. All that matters is being able to kill enemies. Those are the edicts of the gods.” The Pill Fairy formed hand seals, her voice emotionless. The Daynight Furnace flew back, and divine flames wrapped around the Pill Fairy’s body. This was a flame that could burn all things. The Daynight Furnace grew brighter and brighter. Under her control, it began to revolve.

BANG!

Feng Fei’s sword landed on the Daynight Furnace, unleashing a blinding explosion of light. As a result, both of them retreated and coughed up a mouthful of blood. In this full-power exchange, both sides were injured.

Everyone was shocked that the Pill Fairy could injure Feng Fei. When had the Pill Fairy grown so powerful?

Just at this moment, perhaps due to not being able to endure the impact of their attacks, the final barrier around the divine bone below them shattered, and it flew into the air.
