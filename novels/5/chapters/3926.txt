Chapter 3915 One-Shot Underworld Eye Giant

“This isn’t a solution! We’re going to run out of energy soon at this rate!” shouted Bai Xiaole.

“Don’t worry, as long as boss smoothly absorbs the dragon scale, everything will be settled. Just hold on,” said Guo Ran confidently.

However, there were too many attacks coming from the outside. The power of these attacks was being transmitted through the barrier and dispersed through their bodies. As for their own energy, it was being rapidly depleted. In just a few breaths’ time, over half of their energy was used up.

At this rate, they wouldn’t be able to last for more than three waves of attacks. Then the barrier would shatter, and they would be out of energy, like sheep waiting to be slaughtered.

However, they were already trapped, so they could only place their hopes on Long Chen.

“Scram! Long Chen’s life belongs to me, Long Aotian!”

Suddenly, a heaven-shaking roar rang out. Following that, the figure of the sun and moon lit up, and a five-colored flag whistled over.

“The Sun Moon Five Element Flag! It’s Long Aotian!”

Mo Nian and the others cursed inside. At this critical moment, Long Aotian had also come.

BOOM!

The Sun Moon Five Element Flag slashed down, instantly piercing the barrier, making all of them cough up a mouthful of blood.

The Sun Moon Five Element Flag was a peak divine weapon, containing the powers of metal, wood, water, fire, earth, light, and dark. When these seven powers were combined, they instantly pierced through the barrier created by Mo Nian’s coffin.

As the barrier was destroyed, countless experts flooded in. In their eyes, Long Chen had become a piece of rich meat that they had to get a bite of.

In response Little Snow unleashed a sphere of exploding wind blades, killing countless experts. Even Double Supremes were unable to block this attack.

However, after unleashing this attack, Little Snow’s aura plummeted. Due to working together with everyone to defend the barrier, it had exhausted its energy. This final blow was everything it had left.

Mo Nian also moved to block Long Aotian, only to be sent flying by the Sun Moon Five Element Flag.VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

In order to protect Long Chen, Mo Nian had used up the most energy. As a result, he could no longer receive a single attack from Long Aotian.

Beside him, Meng Qi was blocking the Underworld Eye Giant’s attack. But as she had used up too much Spiritual Strength, she was blasted out of the battlefield along with her bell.

Chaos ensued as an overwhelming tide of experts surged from all directions, overwhelming Bai Shishi, the Pill Fairy, Yue Zifeng, and the others.

“Watch out!”

Meng Qi shouted a warning at Bai Shishi. Her golden bell then left her, shooting out to guard Bai Shishi’s back.

BOOM!

It then blocked the sneak attack from the beast cultivator, saving Bai Shishi.

“Big sister, are you alright?”

Bai Shishi was in the midst of fighting the Underworld Eye Giant and hadn’t noticed the beast cultivator approaching her from behind. Without Meng Qi’s aid, she would definitely be seriously injured or dead. So when she saw blood dripping out of the corner of Meng Qi’s mouth and her weakened gaze, she felt guilty and aggrieved.

“It’s fine as long as you’re alright.” Meng Qi forced out a smile. She was already out of Spiritual Strength, so that blow had damaged her soul. It was painful, but she could still endure.

“Big sister…” Bai Shishi felt even guiltier.

“Good sister, since we’re sisters, we’ll be sisters for life.” Meng Qi seemed to see through Bai Shishi’s thoughts and smiled.

Bai Shishi nodded. Despite how prideful she was, after seeing Meng Qi, she was won over by that fairy-like aura of hers. In this world, Meng Qi was the only woman who could make her submit.

“Xiaoqian!”

Meng Qi suddenly turned in a certain direction and cried out. Yue Xiaoqian hadn’t gone to the barrier because she was the only one suppressing Shi Yang. However, there was also no one guarding her, so when Shi Yang launched an attack against her, she couldn’t evade the blow, causing her to cough up blood. After that, the devil sacrifice technique that she had been suppressing broke free of her seal, making Shi Yang’s aura grow explosively.

“Long Chen, you trash, it’s time for you to die!”

The Sun Moon Five Element Flag pierced through the air at Long Chen, but at that moment, a rainbow radiance descended upon the world. The Pill Fairy clasped her hands together, rainbow flames burning on her forehead. For the price of burning her own lifeforce, she summoned a shield for Long Chen.

“Qingxuan, don’t!”

Upon seeing Yu Qingxuan summon a shield with her very life, Meng Qi’s expression changed. She charged toward her recklessly.

This scene made her think of the final battle of the Martial Heaven Continent; it was just so similar. Was Yu Qingxuan going to experience another reincarnation?

As Meng Qi's voice pierced the air, it wasn't just her who reacted with alarm. Yue Xiaoqian, Dong Mingyu, Guo Ran, Xia Chen, and Yue Zifeng all cried out and rushed over. They did not want that scene to replay.

However, they were a step too slow. They could only watch as Yu Qingxuan was once more dying...

BANG!

Just as the Sun Moon Five Element Flag was about to strike the Pill Fairy, a hand covered in golden scales caught it, causing the berserk Sun Moon Five Element Flag to grow still, its endless power vanishing.

“Why must you be so foolish? That attack could have taken your life!” A gentle voice rang out beside the Pill Fairy’s ear.

Looking in delight, the first thing she saw was a warm pair of eyes. After that, tears slowly flowed down her cheeks. “I don’t know either, but I can’t watch you die. I would rather die in front of you.”

The Pill Fairy now felt waves of fear coming over her. She was an alchemist, not a true flame cultivator, so her true strength lay in alchemy and not fighting.

She had also known that this action of hers would cause her death, but she had been willing to do so. She didn’t want Long Chen to die.

Long Chen reached out and gently wiped away her tears, softly saying, “You’ve already sacrificed yourself a thousand times for me. From now on, it’s my turn to block the wind and rain for you. With me present, no one can hurt you. Just trust me!”

Looking at Long Chen’s sincere and loving face, the Pill Fairy nodded. She seemed to have forgotten the surrounding battlefield, forgotten the endless fierce beasts attacking them. As long as Long Chen was present, she didn’t need to be afraid.

“Die!”

After the Sun Moon Five Element Flag was caught by Long Chen, Long Aotian pulled it with all his might but was unable to even shake Long Chen’s hand. After three futile attempts, he furiously summoned his manifestation.

By summoning his manifestation, his power soared, but his hand suddenly shook. He could no longer keep a hold of the Sun Moon Five Element Flag as it was taken by Long Chen.

Long Chen then flung the Sun Moon Five Element Flag away, which transformed into a streak of light shooting in a certain direction.

In an instant, it pierced a giant figure rushing over, causing a rain of blood to fall. That huge figure then collapsed, its soul extinguished.

“What?!”

To their surprise, this giant figure was actually the terrifying Underworld Eye Giant. He was actually slain in one blow from Long Chen.
