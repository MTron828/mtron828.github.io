Chapter 4150: Black Tortoise Race

Long Chen had not anticipated that this place would be the complete opposite of his expectations. Instead of the lush and vibrant environment he had imagined, he found himself in a desolate wasteland, where spiritual qi was scarce. Everywhere he looked, he could only see the remnants of crushed ruins.

The buildings had long since collapsed and decayed, while the land was riddled with wounds. As far as the eye could see, he could only see desolation without a trace of vitality. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

It felt like a god-forsaken land, a place where birds didn’t defecate and hens didn’t lay eggs. How could this kind of place be the Sage King Prefecture?

However, the crowd in the distance told them that this place was truly the Sage King Prefecture. They hadn’t gotten lost.

“Let’s go. We’ll see if we can find it!” Xu Jianxiong took out an ancient map. Based on the surroundings, he led them in a certain direction.

Long Chen found that it wasn’t just the Fullmoon race that was looking for something. Other races had maps and bone runes in their hands, also searching for something.

“Uncle Xiong, what are you looking for?” Long Chen couldn’t help asking curiously. In truth, everyone was also curious; they just hadn’t spoken.

“I’m looking for the Fullmoon race’s spot,” said Xu Jianxiong with a smile. “In the immemorial era, our Fullmoon race could count as an above-average race, so we naturally had our own seat in the Sage King Convention. However, we’ve recently declined, and our seat was taken by others. Many people have already forgotten our Fullmoon race. But it’s time to reclaim our spot.”

Hearing this, the Fullmoon race’s experts trembled with excitement. What the Fullmoon race was about to reclaim was not just their spot but also their dignity.

Long Chen didn’t understand how they were able to find anything within these ruins. Furthermore, what was the point of that spot?

“Hahaha, isn’t that the Fullmoon race? You’ve also come to participate in the Sage King Convention? I heard that you’ve missed several Sage King Conventions lately. I thought that you had vanished from the ten thousand races!” Suddenly, a group walked over from ahead, and their leading elder was the one speaking.

“Black Tortoise race!”

The countenance of the Fullmoon race’s experts changed noticeably. It was evident that these newcomers belonged to another race with a history of unfriendliness toward the Fullmoon race. They had clearly come to cause trouble.

“Give him a beating,” transmitted Long Chen to Xu Changchuan.

“What?” Xu Changchuan was startled.

“Fine, I’ll do it.”

The Black Tortoise race’s experts had just walked over with mocking expressions when Long Chen appeared in front of their lead elder. Without a word, he slapped this elder in the face.

The Black Tortoise race and the Fullmoon race harbored a deep-seated blood feud between them that was carved into their bones and souls. Although the Fullmoon race had not gone out of the life-forbidden area for several generations, upon encountering the Black Tortoise race, their blood began to boil.

However, even though they felt hatred for the other in their bones, they were both immemorial races with powerful experts. As a result, they wouldn’t easily attack the other, especially not at this time.

Thus, the Black Tortoise elder’s only goal had been to taunt and intimidate the Fullmoon race. They had never expected that a member of the Fullmoon race would dare to launch a direct attack against them.

Long Chen’s slap caused an explosive sound, sending that elder flipping through the air. But Long Chen also felt a stinging pain in his palm.

“What a tough tortoise shell!”

Long Chen was surprised. The slap had landed without the elder showing even the slightest sign of being on guard, yet it had still triggered his protective runes. His reaction speed was quite fast.

The other experts of the Black Tortoise race were enraged, and the closest Heaven Venerate immediately smashed a fist at Long Chen.

However, just as he attacked, a bone spear flickering with silver light pierced his armpit, causing blood to spray. It was Xu Changchuan.

He had been too slow to react when Long Chen first nudged him, but after Long Chen attacked, he quickly reacted.

Xu Jianxiong had already said that he wasn’t worried about trouble; he was only worried about the Fullmoon race not having the courage to cause trouble. In truth, he had been waiting for such a group to appear. So far, the display from the Fullmoon race’s disciples, including Xu Changchuan, was barely acceptable to him.

However, with Long Chen’s reminder, Xu Changchuan took advantage of this opportunity and shot out his silver spear at the perfect time.

In truth, it wasn’t that Xu Changchuan’s timing was perfect but that Long Chen was standing at the perfect angle. The instant the Heaven Venerate attacked Long Chen, he fully exposed his side to Xu Changchuan.

But then, that Heaven Venerate could also be considered an expert. He instantly switched from offense to defense and was only stabbed in the armpit.

Just as his blood sprayed out, a golden bowl flew out and caught every single drop of the fresh blood.

That bowl then flew into Guo Ran’s hand. After securing this blood, he used the bowl to sense its fluctuations. When the runes on the bowl lit up one by one, Guo Ran couldn’t help crying out excitedly.

“Yes! So the legends are true! Tortoise blood really is a great supplement!”

“Hey, I need it. Using it as a supplement would be a waste!” Xia Chen grabbed the bowl from Guo Ran. He then solemnly poured the blood into a bottle.

Black Tortoise essence blood was a top grade material for inscribing runes. Furthermore, this was the blood of a Heaven Venerate Black Tortoise. It was truly rare. Xia Chen had been looking for it for a long time but had only gained a bit of blood on the Immortal King level. He hadn’t even found a single drop at the World King level.

“Damn, there are so many tortoises! If we were to bleed them all, that’d be a decent sum!” Guo Ran eyed the hundreds of thousands of Black Tortoise experts in front of them, a greedy light appearing in his eyes. It was like he was looking at mountains of gold.

“You little bastard, die!”

At this moment, the elder that Long Chen had sent flying with a slap roared. When his pressure appeared, heaven and earth changed color. It felt like this world was being crushed by a star, and their bodies would explode. They couldn’t move.

The elder smashed a palm at Long Chen. This elder’s power was truly terrifying. In his enraged state, he had unleashed his full power. Long Chen actually wasn’t a match for him.

“Old bastard, you should die instead.” Long Chen retorted and suddenly retreated.

The moment he retreated, the enraged elder’s expression changed. He had already locked down Long Chen. According to reason, Long Chen should be unable to move and only able to accept his death.

Long Chen escaped his lock, so the elder’s attack shot past where he was, going straight toward Xu Jianxiong.

Xu Jianxiong snorted and extended a hand as well toward his palm.
