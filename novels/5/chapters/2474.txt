Chapter 2464 Crushed

Translator: BornToBe

Facing Tian Xiezi’s attack, Long Chen raised Evilmoon in front of him and calmly waited for it to land.

Endless power was circulating within his body, and it came from his 108,000 astral spaces. Upon stepping into the Samsara realm, Long Chen finally understood the essence of the Netherpassage realm.

Before this, his astral spaces were like individual blocks contributing a portion of their power to him. But with his new life and death energy, it was like they had been unsealed. Their power united, circulating according to a specific rhythm. It was like they had formed into a formation, giving him incalculable power.

At this moment, rather than fear, Long Chen felt a thirst for a powerful opponent to test just how strong his new power was.

BOOM!

Tian Xiezi’s spear smashed into Evilmoon, unleashing an explosion of divine light that destroyed the surroundings. Only the life and death spring seemed protected by some kind of law. The rest of the surrounding space had been wrecked.

An aura of destruction continued to hang in the air. Meng Qi and the others were still beneath the spring, not daring to come out. They were truly shocked at Tian Xiezi’s power. But when the twisting space stabilized, they saw Long Chen standing in his original location. He hadn’t budged an inch.

“Heavens, he blocked it!” Some disciples snuck their heads out and had to confirm that they weren’t just seeing things. Others followed, but they remained ready to dive back at the slightest notice. This spring had become their protective talisman.

“Hahaha, boss really is boss. Tian Xiezi’s attack can’t even rattle him!” Guo Ran laughed so arrogantly as if he had been the one to block Tian Xiezi’s powerful attack.

“This is impossible!” Tian Xiezi roared. He hadn’t held back in the slightest just now, but Long Chen had easily received it. He refused to believe this.

The stars within Long Chen’s divine ring were like a vast universe. Tian Xiezi felt as if his attack had been launched into that universe and dissipated without causing a ripple.

“There was definitely something wrong. Why don’t you try again?” Long Chen nodded along with Tian Xiezi’s judgment.

Tian Xiezi furiously attacked once more, causing startled cries to ring out from below. Guo Ran and the others dived back down. Tian Xiezi wasn’t even accumulating power before unleashing his attack.

However, they were startled to find that there was no earth-shaking explosion this time, nor was there furious divine light. There was only a muffled bang before things fell silent.

Guo Ran and the others cautiously looked through the water, not daring to stick their heads up again.

Tian Xiezi stared in shock. His hand trembled.

“Now this shows that there wasn’t a problem. I understand how to use Samsara power to dissipate an opponent’s attack now.” Long Chen smiled.

In the first attack, he had used his life and death energy to block it. At that moment, he had sensed that while a portion was blocked, resulting in a huge explosion, another portion was absorbed by his Samsara power.

In the second attack, he chose not to block it, instead circulating his Samsara power to easily dissipate the attack without the slightest harm.

This allowed him to experience the immense difference between the third and fourth steps.

Originally, his 108,000 astral spaces hadn’t given him the immense advantage he had expected within the Life Star realm. With others only having one astral space, no matter how big they were, they couldn’t be bigger than his astral spaces combined. His astral spaces had to be at least ten times greater than other people’s.

However, he had never felt himself to have such a huge advantage in that regard. It was only now that he felt like he might weep from emotion. The advantage of his 108,000 astral spaces was materializing now.

Tian Xiezi’s full-power attack was easily absorbed by his astral spaces without causing a ripple. He wasn’t even qualified to injure him.

“Prepare yourself. It should be my turn now.”

Long Chen suddenly turned hostile. The stars within his divine ring blazed with light, and a majestic energy soared within Evilmoon.

Tian Xiezi was sent flying simply by the soaring power. Without even raising a hand, just Long Chen’s rising power was enough to blow him back.

Tian Xiezi was horrified. His power was still locked onto Long Chen. He hadn’t loosened his lock in the slightest, but Long Chen had easily knocked him back.

“Have a taste of my saber.”

Long Chen slashed Evilmoon without any technique. It was a simple slash. However, the world fell silent; time faded away. As everything else was frozen, only Long Chen’s black blade slowly moved through the air. Time? Speed? They were all meaningless.

Tian Xiezi sensed just how profoundly terrifying this attack was. This attack filled heaven and earth, so there was nowhere to run. The only thing he could do was receive it head-on.

With a howl, blood-colored runes ignited around his body once more. He raised his spear.

BOOM!

Evilmoon slashed down, seemingly both incredibly slow and fast. There was no mighty hurricane following it, but when it struck Tian Xiezi’s spear, Evilmoon’s power instantly erupted.

Tian Xiezi’s spear exploded and fragmented runes flew out. Those runes were wailing. They were the countless resentful spirits sealed within the spear.

Upon obtaining their freedom, they should have been grateful to Long Chen. However, they had been sealed so long that they had lost any rationality. They charged at Long Chen, howling for his life.

A dragon’s roar rang out, and Lei Long devoured those resentful spirits in an instant. With that, the world returned to calm, revealing Tian Xiezi.

Tian Xiezi’s arms were gone, and his entire body looked like fractured porcelain. He was covered in deep cracks. It seemed that he was on the verge of death.

Even while igniting the divine energy of a divine son, Tian Xiezi was unable to block a single blow from Long Chen who was in control of Samsara power. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Long Chen quickly followed up with another slash of his saber. It was a casual blow once more.

“Corrupt King Shield!” Tian Xiezi summoned a giant blood-colored shield, only for it to be instantly shattered. Not even divine energy could stop Long Chen.

Despite blocking the attack, the shockwave resulted in Tian Xiezi’s fractured body exploding. Through the blood, a translucent figure appeared.

“Long Chen, just wait!” With his physical body destroyed, Tian Xiezi couldn’t fight any longer. A mark appeared on his forehead, and he began to fade away.

“You’re overthinking it. If it wasn’t to kill you, do you think I’d take the risk of breaking through? Raging Flame Prison.” Long Chen sneered. With no need to form hand seals, flame chains appeared in the air and bound the surrounding space.

In that instant, the rest of the world was cut off. This flame prison was not just physical, and Tian Xiezi’s fading figure returned.

Tian Xiezi spread his arms, summoning a runic spear. He struck the cage repeatedly but was unable to break through it.

“I won’t make the same mistake twice. That Six Horn Sea Serpent got away last time, but I can make up for it now. This flame prison is now my strongest restraining technique. It will make sure my opponents can’t run after being defeated. I was originally planning on using it after injuring you together with my brothers, but I didn’t expect that you would be so cooperative as to not even see through my lightning clone. If you had, you would have had a fifty percent chance of using your divine energy to get away. But now, your physical body is destroyed, and your divine energy is exhausted. You have no chance to run,” said Long Chen.

Huo Linger was Long Chen’s strongest support now. She was the best option for preventing Tian Xiezi from getting away. He had known from the start that Tian Xiezi had to have many life protecting talismans. Beating him was easy, but killing him was hard.

Tian Xiezi’s expression was sinister. Blood runes appeared in his hand, and he began to chant a sutra. The blood runes quickly covered his whole body.

Long Chen was started and quickly made the flame prison shrink down.

“Too late.” Tian Xiezi sneered. When his body was fully covered in blood runes, he flew into the flame chains, his body seeming to melt and pass through.

“Long Chen, you cost me all the faith energy I was blessed with. Just wait, I swear I will have my vengeance!”

Just as Tian Xiezi was saying some final fateful words, a translucent dagger stabbed through his back and out his chest. The blood runes covering his body rapidly faded.
