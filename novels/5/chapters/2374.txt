Chapter 2364 Deputy Elder

“The world of the divine families is probably the same as the entire Martial Heaven Continent. Seeing how big it is, I even suspected that this is the major world, while the Martial Heaven Continent is just a minor world,” said Long Chen deliberately as he watched endless mountains pass by them.

As expected, Shen Chengfeng said, “This world of the divine families is still a minor world. You only think that the Martial Heaven Continent is small because it is damaged.”

“So you’re saying that it is incomplete?” asked Long Chen.

“Yes. The Martial Heaven Continent is no longer a complete star. It is less than a hundredth of its original size,” said Shen Chengfeng, seemingly unaware of Long Chen’s probing for information.

“Then that battle from the immortal era must have been one that could destroy heaven and earth,” said Long Chen.

It was called the battle of the gods, and it had caused the Martial Heaven Continent to become incomplete. After that battle, the Martial Heaven Continent had started to recover, but then the first dark era had come. Then the second, and the third.

Every dark era caused immense damage to the continent. Countless ancient tomes and inheritances were destroyed, lost to time. History became muddled.

Now, there was no longer any way to confirm anything that had happened back then. People could only make their own judgments as to what was fiction and what was real.

However, Long Chen believed that the divine families had managed to retain a complete history of what had happened, so he was probing Shen Chengfeng.

“Yes, the battle of the gods was apocalyptic. They were the true experts,” said Shen Chengfeng.

However, Shen Chengfeng didn’t say anything further about those gods. Theoretically, people who knew such history would like to tell a bit of it to others to prove their own learning, but Shen Chengfeng didn’t. It was unknown if he didn’t know, or if it was taboo to mention it.

Just as Long Chen was pondering how he could extract more information from him, a range of giant mountains appeared ahead of them. They were steep and tall, looking like swords stabbing into the sky.

These mountains were made of tough stone, and there were many caves built into them. Those caves all looked ancient and mysterious.

The two of them were sitting in a large flying boat, but in the face of these mountains, they appeared especially small. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

“There are a total of ninety-nine Heaven Spirit Peaks. Every one of them is supported by formations to make cultivating inside much faster than on the Martial Heaven Continent. The energy of the Heavenly Daos is also concentrated to make comprehension easier. This is why I feel great admiration for the geniuses on the continent. You’re all born at a starting line so much further back than us, but within that bitter environment, you still managed to claw yourselves out. You’re the real geniuses. If you were born in the divine families and had these resources, your accomplishments would be far greater,” said Shen Chengfeng.

Shen Chengfeng had only reached his current level thanks to these superior conditions. The difference was immense.

Long Chen smiled. “I’ve never believed in that starting line thing. Cultivation is a marathon with no end. You run until you die. Running quickly and being ahead of others isn’t necessarily a good thing. Although it makes others envious, it makes you a target as well. If you’re slower, it’s much more stable. You’ll understand what it means to accumulate resources for success and have the power to go all-out later. Such a person can soar with just one opportunity.”

This made Long Chen think of Ling Yunzi. He was a typical case of how a flash of insight could cause someone to soar.

“Long Chen, that vision and wisdom is truly admirable.”

“Haha, you must be joking, right? Everyone knows that when my head gets hot, I’ll jump into laughably childish traps.”

Shen Chengfeng laughed along with Long Chen. That was true. When provoked, Long Chen would easily jump into other people’s traps.

After laughing, he gradually grew solemn. “The interior of the divine families has a very strict bloodline ranking. Long Chen, if you wish to obtain more from the divine families, you have to learn how to endure. The divine families do not like outsiders. You fought with one of senior Feng Fei’s guards, but she didn’t wish to quibble with you. If she had, you would be in trouble.”

“What kind of trouble? Would the divine families go back on their promise to me?”

“Worse. You would be defeated and very likely killed.”

“Oh?”

Shen Chengfeng sighed. “You might not be able to accept it when it’s just me saying that, but you will slowly come to understand just how deep the foundation of the divine families is. Feng Fei comes from the Jiang family. If it was one of the other families, the Long family would be able to support you. But the Jiang family is something even the Long family cannot provoke. That’s why I felt like I should warn you. I feel like your best shot at soaring is by working together with the Long family.”

Just at this moment, the flying boat arrived halfway up a giant mountain. There was a terrace there.

“Long Chen, Elder Long is inside. I was planning on going after bringing you here, but I feel like I’ll probably be leaving with you,” said Shen Chengfeng.

Long Chen didn’t know what he was referring to. They walked into a large cave with a palace built inside it.

“Long Chen, you’ve been busy. You only arrived at this time.” Long Chen heard Elder Long’s voice as soon as he walked inside. He saw Elder Long and another Elder sitting to the side, facing the central seat inside the palace. A very lean old man was sitting there.

The man looked like an ancient scholar. Although he saw him right there, Long Chen was unable to sense his existence. It felt like he was one with heaven and earth.

“Above Netherpassage?”

Long Chen’s heart shook. As expected, the divine families had existences above the Netherpassage realm. This old man’s eyes were turbid, but in the instant that their eyes met, Long Chen felt like he had been seen through completely.

This was a terrifying expert, someone who had reached a height that Long Chen could not comprehend.

“Long Chen, is it? Excellent. In a place with so few resources like the Martial Heaven Continent, you were able to walk to this point with your own efforts. Even throughout all of history, there haven’t been many capable of doing such a thing. No wonder even a Sovereign favors you,” said the old man.

“Many thanks, senior, for your praise. This junior was only able to reach this point through luck,” said Long Chen modestly. Even he had to be a bit reserved in the face of such an expert.

“Luck? Based on what I know, your luck has never been good. Youngsters don’t need to suppress their own light. If you waste your youth on the conservativeness of the old, it’s not a good thing. Sharpness should be unleashed, or it signifies the end of your martial path is drawing near.” The elder smiled kindly.

“Many thanks for senior’s teachings.” Long Chen cupped his fists.

“Long Chen, let me introduce you. This is our Long family’s Deputy Elder. Other than the head of the family, he is the one with the greatest authority in the Long family,” said Elder Long.

Other than the family head, there were four Deputy Elders with the greatest authority. If the four of them were united, they could even overrule the family head.

This particular Deputy Elder was the leader of the four of them, having an extremely high status.

“Long Chen, I know of your past. I very much like your character and how you act. With the dark era coming, it is time to be united against invading races. The Long family is willing to give you some help. I would like to tell you that the Star Field Divine World is to be opened soon. If we’re fast, it should be open in half a month, but it could take up to a month. You and your Dragonblood Legion should prepare yourselves,” said the Deputy Elder. “Other than that, I also wanted to see you personally. Elder Long has told me much about your excellence, and I also find you very satisfactory. Due to Elder Long praising you as a powerful force in your own right and as a leader, I would like to ask you to go to the Ancient Battlefield. Things have been difficult there recently. Shen Chengfeng returned to request reinforcements, and it just so happens that you are here as well. I would like to ask you to go with Shen Chengfeng there. As for what to do, I’m sure you understand.”

“You wish for me to command the eighth Heavenly Dragon Legion? Isn’t that too much? I’m not familiar with the fighters or environment or even the enemies. How am I supposed to lead them?” asked Long Chen.

It seemed that the Deputy Elder was probing his commanding skills. After all, Elder Long had said that if he did well, the divine families would consider letting him direct the battle against the dark era.

“Difficult doesn't mean impossible. Only difficult things are worth doing. Go. We will quietly wait for your good news,” said the Deputy Elder.

Long Chen left, still stunned. This had come out of nowhere. He hadn’t even had a chance to ask what was inside the Star Field Divine World before being given this task. Outside, Shen Chengfeng was waiting for him.

Once the two of them were gone, Elder Long asked, “How is this child?”

“His eyes made me think of another wild and uncontrollable fellow. It’s a pity…”

The Deputy Elder sighed, a bitter light filling his turbid eyes. Elder Long and the other Elder exchanged a glance, also thinking of that person.
