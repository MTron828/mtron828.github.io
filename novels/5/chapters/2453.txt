Chapter 2443 Bone Tile

Translator: BornToBe

“This aura…” Upon seeing the giant tree, Long Chen was shocked. Why was it that this tree had such a similar aura to the Spirit World’s Life God Tree?

Qi Li and La Wei both piously kowtowed. The giant tree unleashed a gentle light from its leaves that illuminated the forest.

A group of experts from the Luo Spirit race came over. They wore slightly different clothes than Qi Li and the others. Upon seeing Long Chen, their expressions changed. Before they could say anything, the giant tree quivered ever so slightly, and a shocked expression came over them.

“This is Long Chen. He-” started Qi Li.

An old man walked out of the crowd. “The Spirit God has ordered for this precious guest to be brought inside.”

He beckoned welcomingly. Long Chen nodded and followed them inside.

The closer he got to the giant tree, the more familiar he felt it to be. Its aura was extremely similar to the Spirit World’s Life God Tree.

The Spirit World had been invaded, and the Life God Tree had been damaged. However, Long Chen had given it the life soil of his primal chaos space, so it should be mostly recovered by now.

When Long Chen got closer, he saw countless experts of the Luo Spirit race looking at him vigilantly. They were as numerous as ants. They had to be counted in the millions.

Qi Li explained that their Luo Spirit race was spread out, and the stronghold that they had been at was just one tiny branch. He was surprised.

Now Long Chen understood why La Wei had previously said that he wouldn’t dare to go see the Life Spirit God. There were countless experts here. If he really had bad intentions, he wouldn’t be able to leave alive.

There were at least thousands of experts on the same level as Qi Li’s father here. Furthermore, there was a feeling of even greater pressure from the towering tree.

Despite already being beneath the crown of the tree, it took them a full hour of going in a straight line before they arrived at its trunk.

The bark had scale-like patterns. Life Qi invigorated Long Chen.

More and more of the Luo Spirit race’s experts appeared. They jumped down from the branches. It seemed that they viewed its leaves as stairs.

“There’s no need to cause such a huge disturbance, right?” Long Chen felt the pressure increase. More and more experts were gathering here.

Qi Li and La Wei were also nervous. They had never witnessed something like this. They didn’t know why bringing Long Chen over to see the Life Spirit God would shake the entire Luo Spirit race.

Those who could remain by the side of the Life Spirit God were all elite figures of the Luo Spirit race. Qi Li’s heart pounded hard. Someone like her was only qualified to spend half a month every year cultivating here.

Only those with excellent talent or those who had made outstanding contributions were allowed to stay here longer. Every single person here could be said to have a higher status than her.

Suddenly, an old man with a white beard slowly descended. Long Chen was startled to find a pair of emerald wings on his back. They looked like two giant leaves.

The elder held a wooden staff, and although he was not large, he gave off a tranquil feeling.

“Greetings, great prophet!”

Every single member of the Luo Spirit race fell to their knees. Qi Li and La Wei were startled and hastily knelt as well. This was a legendary figure that they had never seen before.

This prophet was the emissary of the Life Spirit God, the one who gave them the god’s decrees. He was the only one who could communicate with the Life Spirit God, and the strongest existence within the entire Luo Spirit race.

“Someone above the Netherpassage realm.”

Long Chen’s heart shook. He couldn’t sense any aura coming off of this old man, but he could sense a majestic life energy that shook him deeply.

“Hello, expert from another world. Let me represent the entirety of the Luo Spirit race in welcoming you.” The old man solemnly bowed with his left hand holding his shoulder.

Long Chen hastily said, “I wouldn’t dare to accept. This little one didn’t manage to bring any gifts.”

Long Chen was unable to understand why someone as powerful as the prophet would be so respectful to him.

“You’re too courteous. Your arrival is the greatest gift to the Luo Spirit race. You are from the Martial Heaven Continent, correct?” asked the prophet.

“Yes.” Long Chen’s heart shook once more. How had he known? Was it because he was actually a prophet capable of seeing the future?

“No need to be surprised. There was once an expert who left behind something for us to give to you,” said the prophet. A bone tile appeared in his hand.

The bone tile was around the size of a fist. It sparkled brightly like a gemstone, but it gave off a very frightening pressure. All the experts of the Luo Spirit race involuntarily stepped back, turning pale.

There were blood-colored marks flickering inside of the bone tile. It was like it was pulsing with demonic blood. Long Chen carefully received it. When he held it, he could clearly feel an immense, slumbering power.

“Senior, have you gotten the wrong person?” asked Long Chen. How could someone have left this thing for him?

The prophet smiled. “As long as you came from the Martial Heaven Continent, you are the right person. That senior from back then said that as long as someone from the Martial Heaven Continent came here, we were to give this to you.”

“Who was that person?” asked Long Chen. He was surprised to hear that this prophet was even calling them senior.

The senior shook his head. “It’s unclear. This was told to me by the last generation prophet, who was told this by his predecessor and so on. No one knows the details.”

“It’s from so long ago?” Long Chen was now deeply shaken. Was this left behind by someone who was also from the Martial Heaven Continent?

If so, then what power did they come from? Were they not afraid of this item ending up in the wrong person’s hands?

“May I ask what this thing is used for?” probed Long Chen.

The prophet shook his head. “We were only in charge of passing it to you. As for the details, I apologize, as we really don’t know.”

Long Chen could only put aside the bone tile for now. “Senior, I wish to obtain a detailed map. Is that possible?”

“Of course.” The prophet waved his hand. A leaf fell from the tree, shrinking down until it was only the size of a coin. “Press this against your head and use your soul to sense it. You will obtain the information.”

Long Chen pressed the leaf against his forehead. He instantly felt like he was flying. The higher he went, the more that he could see.

He saw the tree crown he was beneath. He flew higher and higher until he saw the stronghold of the Luo Spirit race that he had been in. He also saw the spatial crack and the end of the giant forest. On the other side was a barren desert. Then he saw the end of the desert.

He found that he was on an island. There were many other islands nearby. As he saw further, he suddenly found that this world was like a jigsaw puzzle that had been smashed.

“Is it really as the Pill Doyen said? This place was fragmented after an immense battle? If that’s true, who could have done such a thing?”

Long Chen was stunned. This place was huge, far surpassing his imagination. He didn’t know just how many times larger it was compared to the Martial Heaven Continent.

One fragmented world after another appeared in his mind. Many places were filled with crossing spatial cracks that were like gaping maws.

“What is that?” Long Chen suddenly noticed a black river in the distance. It stopped this world from extending any further. It was as if someone had intentionally cut this place in two. It felt like there was more on the other side of the black river, but he couldn’t see anything past it. The black river was so wide that he couldn’t even begin to estimate how wide it was.

“The Star Field Divine World was formed of its own star field, in other words, it was formed of many worlds just like the Martial Heaven Continent. No wonder it is so huge.”

The leaf fell from his head. It quickly withered, vanishing without a trace before it even touched the ground.

Long Chen slowly opened his eyes. “Many thanks, senior!”

Long Chen then turned to La Wei and pressed a finger against his forehead. “La Wei, I have yet to give you anything from our chance encounter. I will transmit how to control the Golden Scale Blue Eye Eagle’s slave mark to you.”

La Wei was shocked that Long Chen was passing it to him and not Qi Li. He quickly understood though.

“Senior, I still have things to do, so I’ll leave for now. Many thanks for the map.” Long Chen cupped his fists. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

However, Long Chen’s expression suddenly changed. He took out the compass once more. It was dinging. One of the groups of the Dragonblood Legion was releasing a distress signal, and it was of the utmost urgency.
