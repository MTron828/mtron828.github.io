Chapter 1587 Sixth Form of Split the Heavens

Translator: BornToBe

“Bend your front leg.”

Whack!

“More weight on your back leg.”

Whack!

“Lean forward more.”

Whack!

“Keep your abdomen tight.”

With each critique, the old man’s staff whacked Long Chen somewhere, making the latter clench his teeth. The old man was definitely getting his revenge.

“The sixth form is different from the first five forms. Before, you only had to rely on your acupuncture points to unleash the power of Split the Heavens. However, the sixth form uses one’s aura to draw out the energy of heaven and earth. So if you want to use the sixth form, you must have a powerful enough physical body to endure that energy. Remember, this movement must be done perfectly, or the energy flowing through your body will become stuck. If that happens, let alone unleashing your attack, you won’t even be able to move,” shouted the old man to the side as he fixed Long Chen’s posture. “Alright, continue according to what I just taught you. Slowly circulate your aura. Remember, don’t touch the fifty-four acupuncture points in your body.”

Long Chen complied. This wasn’t difficult for him. The only difficult thing was this strange posture. When he had attacked before, it had always been natural. He had never been forced to follow through with a prescribed form.

Space shook as energy began to surge toward Long Chen. The old man kept his face stern, but he was surprised. Long Chen really was a monster. His control over his spiritual yuan was perfect.

He sighed inside. This level of skill could only have come from being forced to reach this level. Long Chen had forced himself to draw out all his potential. No one knew how much he had suffered to reach this level of skill.

Originally, the old man had been in the mood to continue beating him; however, with Long Chen’s current display, he felt too bad to do so. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

“Not bad. Stabilize your aura and don’t touch your spiritual yuan. Have your will enter the first acupuncture point and activate it. Remember, just activate one,” said the old man.

Long Chen followed the old man’s instructions. His spiritual yuan was still calm as using one’s will to activate an acupuncture point was very difficult. Before this, he would connect all the corresponding acupuncture points at once. And now, not only did he need to do it one by one, but he also had to make sure not to touch his spiritual yuan.

Activating Split the Heavens had almost become a reflex. As soon as he activated the first acupuncture point, his spiritual yuan wanted to rush forward. However, his control was still great enough that he only had to struggle for a moment to suppress that spiritual yuan.

The instant he activated his first acupuncture point, Long Chen looked into the sky, surprised. There was nothing there, but he felt something there connected to his mind. It was like his senses had extended outside his body.

“Little fellow, you’ve actually found your spiritual eye,” exclaimed the old man.

“What is this?” asked Long Chen.

“Foolish brat, the Xuantian Dao Sect has its myriad techniques revolving around the Dao, while the Heaven Suppressing Magic Sect has its endless magical arts. However, the Heaven Splitting Battle Sect only has the Battle God Sacred Canon and the nine forms of Split the Heavens. Do you know why despite only having these two things, we were the leader of the three great heavenly sects?”

“I really don’t.” Long Chen shook his head. He didn’t know that much about the Heaven Splitting Battle Sect or its past. He had never asked either.

“You’ve already broken the Heaven Suppressing Magic Sect’s divine spring, removing them from this world. But you should know that back in the day, their name was enough to shake the Martial Heaven Continent. As for the Heaven Splitting Battle Sect, we were even above them. Although I wouldn’t dare to say that we were the rulers of the continent, there was definitely no one who dared to provoke us. Then we declined because the upper half of the divine tablet was lost, causing us to lose the inheritance of the nine forms of Split the Heavens. Before you went into Devil Spirit Mountain, our strongest technique was the sixth form of Split the Heavens. However, even the sixth form is incredibly powerful, far more so than the fifth form. The thing that you’re sensing right now, it is a complementing place to your acupuncture points. It is like another eye that allows you to see everything around you clearly. Now, continue activating the next eight acupuncture points.”

Long Chen nodded and continued according to his previous experience. Activating the second acupuncture point was even easier than activating the first.

The feeling he had up above him increased. From there, he was able to see himself clearly. The angle was completely different.

He continued, activating the first nine acupuncture points. These were the acupuncture points required for the first form of Split the Heavens. However, now that he was activating them with the technique of the sixth form, something was different about them.

He felt like there were nine eyes in the sky, giving him nine angles to survey the world. This was an extremely strange state.

“This way, when I fight, I’ll be able to track my enemies easier and find openings to attack!” exclaimed Long Chen.

When fighting, he usually relied on his divine sense to keep an eye on his surroundings. However, in an intense fight, the powerful fluctuations harshly limited his divine sense, making his senses dull.

Now, he would be able to see everything around him clearly. When he fought powerful enemies in the future, he would be able to fight even more freely.

“Correct. The first nine acupuncture points correspond to your sight. You can use the spiritual eye to keep watch on your surroundings. Furthermore, there are no limits. You’ll be able to see through bewildering formations. Even in an illusion formation, even if your eyes are blinded, your spiritual eye won’t be. You’ll be able to see through what’s false,” said the old man proudly.

The sixth form of Split the Heavens was where Split the Heavens showed its true worth. If it weren’t for it, the Heaven Splitting Battle Sect might have been destroyed long ago.

The Heaven Splitting Battle Sect didn’t have any magical arts. If they encountered a spiritual attack or were lost in an illusion formation, they would be doomed. It was the sixth form of Split the Heavens that made up for that deficiency. The sixth form had reached an even higher realm.

The thing that shocked the old man was how quickly Long Chen had opened his spiritual eye. Boss Bao and the others had spent three months training in the sixth form before sensing the location of their spiritual eye.

However, back then, they had also been at the Soul Transformation realm, which made it exceptionally difficult to train in the sixth form. That was why their progress had been so slow.

By the time they were capable of using their spiritual eye to examine their surroundings, it had been over a year since they had started training in the sixth form. As for Long Chen, he had not only instantly opened his spiritual eye, but he also managed to make use of it without any instruction.

That shocked the old man. Now he really wanted to know how terrifying Long Chen’s talent was.

“Continue to the next acupuncture point,” said the old man.

Long Chen continued. When he activated the tenth acupuncture point, he paused slightly.

“This acupuncture point relates to the sense of hearing?”

“Correct. Continue. There’s no need to stop. I want to see how many acupuncture points you can activate at once,” said the old man.

Activating the acupuncture points like this would require a great deal of soul energy. Once Long Chen reached his limit, the old man would be forced to help Long Chen. All of his fifty-four acupuncture points had to be fully activated this time.

By activating them the first time, it would give the user experience and reduce the exhaustion for the next time. Then they would be able to unleash the sixth form.

The eighteenth acupuncture point... the twenty-seventh acupuncture point... the thirty-sixth acupuncture point... Long Chen activated them all without finding it taxing at all.

He found that the first nine acupuncture points corresponded to sight, while the next nine corresponded to hearing. Then the next nine corresponded to smell. In that instant, he had felt an absolute clarity toward his surroundings.

When he activated the thirty-sixth acupuncture point and a wave of scents assaulted him, his throat became itchy. He had an urge to puke. It was like he was tasting the air, the soil, the grass, and even the insects in the grass.

The old man was once more shocked. He hadn’t expected Long Chen’s Spiritual Strength to be so powerful.

Long Chen continued. On the forty-fifth acupuncture point, he found that it corresponded to the sense of touch. He felt all his pores opening. It was like everything around him was touching him. The breathing of the fresh grass, the swirl of the wind, and even the movements of the insects in the soil were sensed.

“Good. Before training in the sixth form, one must first cultivate six kinds of senses. The first five senses are sight, hearing, smell, taste, and touch. As long as these five senses are awakened, then any illusion art will be useless against you. Try to see if you can open the final sense. Don’t hesitate. I’m here if you need me,” said the old man.

Seeing Long Chen’s unnatural expression after activating all these senses, the old man thought that Long Chen had almost reached his limit. He didn’t know this was from being disgusted.

However, after reaching the fifth sense, Long Chen didn’t taste as much of what he didn’t want to, and he continued.

His Spiritual Strength was practically limitless, and he activated fifty-four acupuncture points in one go. The instant he activated the fifty-fourth acupuncture point, the space around him shook. Long Chen felt like he had become the ruler of this space. Within this domain, everything was within his control.

Just as he was delighted, the old man whacked his staff at Long Chen’s waist. It was quick, sudden, and at such close range. There was simply no time to dodge.

However, just as it was about to touch his waist, a hand moved as quick as lightning, catching it.
