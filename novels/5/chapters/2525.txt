Chapter 2515 Nine Star World Extermination Flame Lotus

A divine light of annihilation caused the void to shudder. The Brahma Divine Diagram faded away as the Pill Fairy and Yun Tian ceased their battle.

The Pill Fairy stared in shock at Long Chen. Hearing the chanting in the air, she was filled with disbelief. “How is this possible? Why is this third volume of the Nirvana Scripture in his hands? This version of the scripture can only be passed down through the mouths of the gods… How can someone who has blasphemed the gods obtain a god’s inheritance?”

On the Martial Heaven Continent, the only one capable of receiving the third volume of the Nirvana Scripture was her. Not even her father, Yu Xiaoyun, could obtain it, nor any other past valley masters.

Theoretically, she should be the only one capable of controlling the third volume of the Nirvana Scripture. But most importantly, Long Chen’s third volume was different from hers. It seemed completely limitless.

Only the Nirvana Scripture was capable of controlling all flames in the world. Metal, wood, water, fire, earth. Beast flames, demonic flames, Earth Flames. There were millions of varieties, but control over the third volume of the Nirvana Scripture meant control over all these flames, whether it was the fire element in the air, the magma underground, or the beast flames within the bodies of living creatures.

Unbeknownst to the Pill Fairy, even her Nirvana Scripture was useless in the Netherworld. But Long Chen had managed to use it to summon the flames within the Nethergod’s palace.

The sacred chanting resounded throughout heaven and earth, filling the Star Field Divine World.

“It’s senior apprentice-brother Long Chen’s voice! He’s calling us!”

Experts of the Righteous path heard it and rushed over in the direction it was coming from. As the pillar of the Righteous path, they all went to assist him. More and more of the Righteous path’s experts began to gather.

“Let’s go, our future leader is definitely with Long Chen as well.” The experts of the Xuan Beasts also rushed over.

A great distance away, there was another giant tree. Beneath the tree was an army of the Luo Spirit race’s warriors. They were already combat-ready, and their eyes were closed in meditation.

As soon as they heard that chanting, their eyes flew open and they stood up.

An elder with emerald wings on his back also stood. This person was the great prophet of the Luo Spirit race. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“Warriors of the Luo Spirit race, the call for vengeance is summoning us. How many years, how many generations have we dreamed of taking back our mother tree, of taking back our territory, of taking back our home? So many of our warriors died in that battle. Their eyes closed with hatred and resentment. How many of us have bitterly endured until we turned to dust without seeing any hope of reclaiming our home? Today, the time for vengeance has come. The prophesied son has come. His voice is the signal for our attack. Warriors of the Luo Spirit race, let us take back our mother tree alongside the prophesied son!” The prophet’s voice was hoarse with emotion and contained a determination to fight until death.

His sentiment was echoed through the millions of warriors of the Luo Spirit race.

“Reclaim the mother tree!”

“Reclaim the mother tree!”

“Reclaim the mother tree!”

The earth suddenly burst apart. The giant tree they were under actually rose out of the ground along with the earth covering its roots.

“Move out!”

The giant Life Spirit God shot off in Long Chen’s direction. The warriors on top of it had electric gazes with killing intent surging out.

Amongst them was a man and woman who were filled with anticipation. Beside them was a Golden Scale Blue Eye Eagle.

This man and woman were La Wei and Qi Li. This new steed of theirs had been given to La Wei by Long Chen.

While giving it to La Wei, he had expressed that he had no intentions toward Qi Li. Long Chen had given this steed to La Wei to give him an additional thing to be proud of, so he didn’t need to feel inferior being with Qi Li.

Hearing that Long Chen was the prophesied son, the two of them were both excited, especially Qi Li. She had actually once saved this prophesied son. That made her feel heroic.

“We’re finally going to fight alongside the prophesied son. Even if we die, we have to reclaim the mother tree.” Qi Li clenched her fists, a determined light in her eyes.

…

The void continued to rumble as if thunder was crackling. The void was twisting so badly that it had turned into a hazy sea of red. Flames raged, whirled, and exploded. It was as if the apocalypse had come.

Suddenly, all the chaos vanished without a trace. The petals of Long Chen’s giant flame lotus were now fully covered with stars.

The nine petals had nine stars on each of them, a total of eighty-one stars that seemed to be invisibly linked together.

They were arranged according to a mysterious sequence. It was as if they manifested the very nature of the world.

“Boss’s World Extermination Flame Lotus… it has finally reached perfection.” Xia Chen stuttered. He had spent a lifetime studying all kinds of diagrams. He had never seen such a diagram though. This was a divine diagram that represented the very origin of the world. It could manifest into ten thousand Daos.

“What are you all staring for? Dig! Boss Song, Boss Li, get digging! Big sister Chu Yao, great heroine Ruyan, set up a barrier! We need ten layers, no, at least twenty barriers! As many as possible! Xia Chen, get the formation ready. If we die to boss’s technique, it would be far too aggravating. Wilde, what are you just staring for? Get over here!” shouted Guo Ran.

Although they were a great distance away from Long Chen, Guo Ran didn’t dare to be careless. This technique might very well be fatal.

“Little trash Ritian, why don’t you come over and see if I can take some more gold?” Once Wilde ran over, Guo Ran saw Zhao Ritian staring at them. He instantly knew that Zhao Ritian was planning something. Most likely, he wanted to ruin their defenses.

However, when Guo Ran tossed out some bait, Zhao Ritian hesitated and gave up. He returned to his dwarf form and slammed the ground with his hands. The ground instantly turned golden, and he dove into a metal mountain.

“Big brother Yun Tian, big brother Mo Nian, come over here!” beckoned Guo Ran.

Mo Nian was already flying over. His physical body was not that powerful, so he didn’t want to pay a huge price just to survive Long Chen’s technique.

On the other hand, Yun Tian shook his head. “No need. You should hurry up so you don’t make Long Chen worried. He’s waiting for you.”

Yun Tian stood there with his sword in hand. Despite the blood on his white robes, he was indescribably suave. Guo Ran and the others couldn’t help thinking that this was truly worthy of a Sovereign’s son. This was the appearance of a true expert!

At the same time, they knew that Yun Tian had spent a great deal of his energy chasing after Ye Ming and fighting off the others. The reason he didn’t come was because he was worried about Feng Fei, the Pill Fairy, and Zhao Ritian launching a sneak attack.

“Brace for impact!” Guo Ran suddenly gave the order. The land swallowed the Dragonblood Legion. At the same time, countless wooden stakes and roots covered the land. A layer of rock-like earth also protected them.

Dozens of layers of defenses quickly formed, causing even Yun Tian to nod. Such a powerful defense was something even Zhao Ritian and the others would need some time to get through.

“World Extermination Flame Lotus!”

The giant flame lotus finally left Long Chen’s hand and fell toward the altar.

“Fully activate the Soul Assimilation Reincarnation Grand Formation! Protect the altar!” roared Ye Ming. His dark energy flowed out to support the altar.

Ye Ming was finally a bit regretful. He shouldn’t have entered the altar’s protection. If he had been fighting Long Chen, Long Chen wouldn’t have had a chance to unleash this technique.

He had been careless. In order to speed up the revival of the fiend king, he had personally come to be the main pillar of the Soul Assimilation Reincarnation Grand Formation. He had thought that Long Chen wouldn’t be able to do anything to the barrier’s defenses. However, he hadn’t expected Long Chen to display such a terrifying technique. It had surpassed the limits of the Netherpassage realm.

However, regret was too late at this time. He could only unleash all his power to support the formation and resist Long Chen’s attack.

The void exploded, and fragments of spacetime flew out as the lotus fell. The world was consumed by fire. Even the giant tree was ignited.

BOOM!

The flame landed like a meteorite. The earth rapidly collapsed, and then the eighty-one stars began to surge with energy.

“Explode.”

The eighty-one stars suddenly inflated. The energy within the lotus became unstable.

BOOM!

A heaven-shaking explosion caused the entire Star Field Divine World to shake. A giant mushroom cloud soared into the sky, and then a giant wave of fire unfurled.
