Chapter 2928 Can’t Afford to Offend

Li Cai was stunned. Have him slap Four Peak experts in the face? Did he dare?

“Are you a fool? You’ll risk your life on the battlefield, but you don’t even dare to do this?” cursed Long Chen.

Hearing this, Li Cai clenched his teeth and stepped forward. He threw caution to the wind and slapped one of them in the face, producing a clear sound.

As a result, his own hand became numb from the impact. Red swelling rose from it.

“You’re courting death!”

The one who had been slapped roared furiously. He didn’t dare to believe that these people dared to kill him, and being humiliated by these Mortal Transcendence disciples made him feel infuriated enough to punch Li Cai.

However, as soon as he moved, Long Chen slapped him as well, sending him flying. That person’s face immediately swelled up, and he directly fainted.

“Stop!”

Suddenly, a shout rang out, and a group of middle-aged people wearing Elder robes came flying over. These people had far stronger auras. Although they were also at the Four Peak realm, their auras were condensed to the limit. They had reached the peak of the Four Peak realm.

The leading middle-aged man saw Long Chen and was astonished. “Long Chen, why are you here?” However, as soon as he said this, he realized that Long Chen must have come to check into the inner academy.

Long Chen didn’t know the middle-aged man, but the latter knew Long Chen. He had watched the divine competition, and Long Chen had left a very deep impression on him.

With their arrival, someone went to pick up the person Long Chen had sent flying. At this moment, the Zhang Peng that had lost his bird was still twitching on the ground, so someone placed a palm on the back of his head, making him fall unconscious so that he wouldn’t have to suffer.

With the arrival of these Elders, the Unfettered Alliance’s disciples put away their weapons and stood behind Long Chen.

The leading Elder then looked at Long Chen. He essentially understood what had happened already, but formalities dictated that he asked, “What happened here?”

Before Long Chen could reply, one of the Four Peak disciples took the lead. “Elder, this black-robed fellow is rude and unreasonable. He ignored our warning and disturbed the rainbow cranes!”

The Elder’s mouth curled. As expected, these four didn’t know how terrifying this black-robed fellow was. Otherwise, they could have avoided this calamity.

After babbling for a long time, Long Chen was described as someone whose sins were overflowing, someone who had broken countless rules and deserved to be expelled from the academy, or perhaps directly executed.

The Elder didn’t believe that Long Chen would do such foolish things. Hence, he looked at Long Chen when that fellow was done. Long Chen said, “Mu Qingyun, you explain. If someone interrupts me while speaking, I might not be able to stop myself from killing him.”

Hearing this, those two Four Peak disciples were enraged. But before they could speak, the Elder gave them a glare. These two didn’t know anything about the rules, so it served them right.

Mu Qingyun explained what had happened. When the Elder heard that one rainbow crane had transformed into human form and even asked Long Chen to play with her, he was shocked.

The rainbow cranes were one of the High Firmament Academy’s auspicious symbols. Even the dean was completely ignored by them, but one of them wanted to play with Long Chen?

“This matter is too big. I need to report this higher up. However, Long Chen, you’ve just joined the inner academy… No, it should be said that you haven’t even joined the inner academy yet, but you’ve started to make enemies for yourself. That’s not good for your growth,” said the Elder. He admired Long Chen, but this temper of his would make it difficult for him to advance in the academy. After all, the academy was filled with hidden dragons and crouching tigers. There were plenty of monsters.

“Desperate times call for desperate measures. I cultivate in order to live with dignity. I can wave off people acting arrogant and sneering at me, but I will not allow someone to twist my collar because that is not just a simple humiliation. If it weren’t for my good mood, or perhaps that everything here is being monitored, this world would have four more lonely ghosts,” said Long Chen.

When others brandished their claws at him, Long Chen could view them as simply hopping clowns. He couldn’t be bothered with them.

However, for someone to dare to grab these clothes that were as precious as his life, well, if there was no surveillance here, that person would have definitely died. Crippling just a single bird off of his name was being courteous.

The Elder nodded. “I understand what happened. They truly did things wrong, but your conduct was also slightly extreme. I am not authorized to make a judgment on this matter. Go and check in. I will have to report this matter to the Discipline Institute. If they wish to pursue it, they will notify you.”

“Many thanks.” Long Chen cupped his fists to this Elder. Another trial? He was used to it. In any case, he had a foot to stand on, so he wasn’t afraid of such trouble.

In the academy, it was impossible to avoid trouble. The more you wished to avoid trouble, the more troublesome it would be. If Long Chen conceded a step today, he would be forced to concede more and more in the future.

This was why Long Chen was no longer planning on being low-key. He would barge into the inner academy with the most forceful stance. This was the fastest way to stabilize himself here. He had no time to waste.

Watching as Long Chen flew away in the boat, the two Four Peak disciples were dumbfounded. “Elder, why are you so biased toward them? Are you going to let them off just like this?”

“Pay attention to your choice of words. What do you mean by biased?” said the other Elder irritably. “Are you fools? If we didn’t come here, you would have been lucky to escape with your lives. You don’t even know who they are, yet you dare to cause trouble for them?”

“We saved you, but you actually say that we are biased toward them? Hmph, we should have waited a few more minutes before coming.”

Those Elders were all displeased with this accusation. They had all seen Long Chen’s battle, so they knew that he was a vicious character who killed without batting an eye. On the other hand, these lucky fellows had walked past the border of death but had yet to realize it. They were truly foolish.

At this moment, the leader of these Elders looked at the two of them profoundly. “My junior, as your old senior classmate, I’ll give you some advice. You shouldn’t just cultivate your cultivation base. You should cultivate your head too. Don’t be a fool and charge right into the tip of a spear. There are some people that you just can’t provoke. You should know who the number one expert of the outer academy is.”

“Of course we know. It’s Chu Kuang! Once he enters the inner academy, we’ll be folded under his subordinates. How could we not know?” said that disciple.

“The four of you really did get folded under his subordinates,” said one of the Elders with an odd expression. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

Seeing the disciples’ confusion, the head Elder said, “Chu Kuang has passed to the other side. If you wish to continue following him, then you were doing the right thing just now. Bring the other two away to recover. If you wish to pursue this matter, then you can make a report to the Discipline Institute. But I’d advise you not to waste the effort. There won’t be any results.”

The two of them were shocked. They had been on duty the last few days and hadn’t received any news from the outside world. Hearing that Chu Kuang had died, they hastily left to hear the gossip.

Watching them leave, the Elder sighed. “The inner academy is full of hidden dragons and crouching tigers. There are plenty of monsters. Now that another vicious character has been thrown in, things might boil over in the inner academy.”
