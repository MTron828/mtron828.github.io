Chapter 4092 Flying Horse

“Qingxuan, what is it?” asked Long Chen.

“Is it really alright for us to do this?” Yu Qingxuan hesitated before stating her thoughts.

Long Chen looked at Yu Qingxuan. He knew that she had a good and honest character, so she naturally felt guilty when doing such things.

Thus, Long Chen told her about how the Soaring Dragon Company was sacrificing living people to the fiend eyes, and how the Bai clan’s brother and sister had been tricked. He spared no detail of their treachery.

“How can the Soaring Dragon Company do this?! They sell out their own race?!” Yu Qingxuan was stunned to hear this story, brimming with rage.

At first, when Long Chen clashed with the Soaring Dragon Company in the Violet Flame Heaven, she thought that he was simply irritated with how arrogant they were acting, so he taught them a little lesson. Little did she expect such a deep enmity between them.

Long Chen and Uncle Tree’s conversation in the fiend eye was also secret, limited to just the two of them. Even so, Long Chen hadn’t been trying to keep secrets from her. He just didn’t want her beautiful eyes to see the ugly side of humanity.

However, since Yu Qingxuan had asked, he felt that it would be best to tell her. Otherwise, she would think that he was going too far.

“Didn’t the guild master say something about this? When a businessman has no bottom line, that is the most frightening thing. As long as there are profits to gain, who cares about being the same race? They’ll even sell out their own father and mother. I don’t have the power to destroy them yet, so all I can do is rob the rich to help the poor, using their wealth to equip ourselves until the day we can completely wipe them out of existence,” said Long Chen.

“Long Chen, I’m sorry. I… I shouldn’t have questioned you.” Yu Qingxuan suddenly turned red.

Long Chen smiled. “Foolish girl, why can’t you question me? I’m also a person who can make mistakes. If I do make one, you have to bring it up. Don’t let me go further and further down the wrong path.”

“How can you be wrong? I trust you.” Yu Qingxuan giggled.

Long Chen also smiled, but inside, he told himself that all people made mistakes. The truly frightening thing was not realizing you had made a mistake in the first place.

“Boss, are we going to the next one?” asked Xia Chen excitedly. He was addicted to this. This feeling of instantly becoming rich was unmatched.

Before Long Chen could say anything, it was Guo Ran who scolded him, “You make it sound so easy. You’re only in charge of unlocking the runes. Boss and us are the ones putting in all the work. Are you trying to make us die of exhaustion?”

After plundering three of their branches, other than Xia Chen, everyone else was already panting. They had used up all their energy and couldn’t keep going.

Long Chen nodded. “Guo Ran is correct. Let’s not be careless. The three Heaven Venerates that we encountered are not fighting Heaven Venerates.”

“Not fighting Heaven Venerates? What does that mean?”

“Those three Heaven Venerates in the Soaring Dragon Company, and even the guild master, are only in the Heaven Venerate realm as a sign of status. To put it frankly, they are the absolute bottom rankers of the Heaven Venerate realm. True Heaven Venerates are far stronger,” said Long Chen.

Just as he said this, the void rumbled and the heavens split apart. Xia Chen’s flying boat instantly became locked down by immense divine pressure that came from every direction.

“Ignorant brats, you dare to rob my Soaring Dragon Company?! None of you will leave here alive!”

When this furious roar rang out, a large group of experts appeared around Long Chen and the others. The Heaven Venerates of the Soaring Dragon Company had caught up to them.

“They’re quite fast.”

Even after being caught, no one showed any hints of panic. Long Chen stood atop the flying boat, looking coldly at the nine Heaven Venerates in front of them.

“Brat, who are you? To dare to plunder the Soaring Dragon Company, are you prepared to die?” barked the leader.

Other Heaven Venerates and Earth Venerates had completely surrounded them. They wouldn’t give Long Chen and the others any chance to escape.

“Tch, what garbage words. You don’t need to speak. If you want to set up a formation, just set it up. There’s no need to draw my attention. If I wanted to leave, do you think that you could catch up to me? Do you think I'm as stupid as you?” sneered Long Chen.

Their leader had intentionally shouted at them to draw their attention while the others set up themselves in a specific arrangement around them, every single one of them holding a formation disc. It seemed that they wanted to capture Long Chen and the others alive.Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

However, just who was Long Chen? How could he not tell? This level of ploy was far too low.

Just as Long Chen said, if he really wanted to flee from them, he wouldn’t be in a flying boat. Xia Chen would set up an indeterminate transportation formation, and then they would be gone without a trace.

“You mean that you lured us here on purpose?” asked the elder darkly. He suddenly had a bad feeling.

“It doesn’t count as luring. Whether I leave or not is my matter, whether you chase or not is your matter, so whether or not we meet is up to everyone’s destiny!” said Long Chen lightly.

At this time, Uncle Tree was standing right behind Long Chen. He knew that his time had come.

As for the Soaring Dragon Company, when they saw Uncle Tree, their expressions changed as they recognized his status.

When they first arrived in the Nirvana Overflow Heaven, Uncle Tree’s power was still in the midst of recovering from the fiend eye. That was why the Ye clan’s three Elders had misjudged his power.

However, now, Uncle Tree’s power had recovered to the point that the aura of the Undying race was unmistakable. It was now much more difficult for him to fully conceal his aura.

“The Undying race has no enmity with my Soaring Dragon Company, right? Do you represent the Undying race? Are you challenging us to war?” demanded the elder. His fear of Uncle Tree was clear.

As fellow Heaven Venerates, he was well aware that the Undying race’s Heaven Venerates far surpassed them. Even though they had nine Heaven Venerates on their side, they still might not be able to subdue Uncle Tree.

“I don’t represent the Undying race. I just listen to my master. If my master wants me to kill you, I’ll kill you,” said Uncle Tree lightly.

“Master?”

That Heaven Venerate was stunned, unable to believe his ears. The grand Undying race was willing to become someone else’s servant?

Just then, the void rumbled and a group of flying horses flew through the void, their vast pressure causing ripples in the world.

The celestial horses surged through the void, bearing passengers on their backs. Among them, two flying horses exuded remarkably astonishing auras – they were none other than Heaven Venerate demonic beasts.

Upon seeing them, Long Chen’s expression finally changed. He thought that the Soaring Dragon Company’s experts must have come. Anyone who could control Heaven Venerate demonic beasts had to be extraordinary.

However, he quickly noticed that the Soaring Dragon Company’s expressions also changed. They were thinking the same thing as him. They thought that these people were on Long Chen’s side.

The flying horses whistled above Long Chen and the others. When they went past, both Long Chen and the Soaring Dragon Company’s people sighed with relief.

However, just as those flying horses were about to vanish, one of them suddenly turned back, leading the others back.

Long Chen and the Soaring Dragon Company’s people instantly tensed up again, preparing themselves for an immense battle.

The flying horse then slowed down and stopped in front of them. After that, a woman came off the horse.

This woman’s beautiful eyes were filled with disbelief. Long Chen was also stunned when he saw her.

“How can it be her?”
