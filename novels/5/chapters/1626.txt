Chapter 1621 Eat It For Me

Translator: BornToBe

“The soul testing tablet... it exploded.”

Everyone was deathly silent. They were simply stunned.

A red light soared into the sky. The soul energy that had been released in that instant terrified everyone. They felt incredibly miniscule in the face of that energy.

They looked at the fractured testing tablet. That scene was one that they wouldn’t be able to forget for a long time.

In the palace, Meng Qi, Chu Yao, and Tang Wan-er laughed. This result was not unexpected at all for them.

On the other hand, the palace master was stunned. She had long since heard of Long Chen, but she only knew he possessed heaven-shaking combat power. She had never heard that he was an even more terrifying soul cultivator as he had never used soul arts in his battles.

What she didn’t know was that although Long Chen had his terrifying soul energy, he didn’t have the time or energy to train in soul arts. He didn’t even fully understand the Nine Star Hegemon Body Art, so he had no time to be distracted.

That stone tablet had a powerful formation supporting it. There were records of people reaching its maximum testing value in history. However, there had never been a case of someone’s Spiritual Strength causing it to explode.

In other words, Long Chen’s Spiritual Strength had far surpassed the testing limits of the stone tablet. Now, no one knew just how high his soul value was.

“Did you see that? If you did, then hurry up. What? Don’t tell me I even need to prepare chopsticks for you before you start eating.” sneered Long Chen toward the people who had mocked him before but were now speechless.

These disciples’ expressions immediately became unsightly. They had never expected Long Chen to suddenly unleash a second burst of Spiritual Strength that not only broke past the one million point mark, but also caused the soul testing tablet to shatter.

Although they had said some big words before, how were they supposed to eat the testing tablet? Those people didn’t know what to answer. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

“Eat it for me!” shouted Long Chen.

Long Chen had never had any intentions of letting these people off. They were too irritating. He hadn’t provoked them, but they had constantly insulted him. He was no saint, and if they irritated him, he would make sure that they were irritated too.

Was it very refreshing to curse others? Well, it was time to pay the price for that enjoyment.

“Brat, don’t go too far! You should know, I am-”

Pow!

Long Chen slapped him across the face with one hand and caught his throat with the other. Long Chen then used his first hand to pick up a fist-sized stone and shoved it into that person’s mouth.

Once it was shoved into his mouth, Long Chen punished his cheeks, breaking the stone and forcing the fragments down his throat.

That person was like a chicken and had no ability to resist at all. His eyes rolled back into his head.

“Sharp blades cause wounds that can be healed quickly, but the anger from insults doesn’t wear off until it’s vented. Originally, my mood was very good, but I ended up running into idiots with vicious mouths like you. You’ve ruined my mood, so you better eat all these stones for me. Even if I have to break your heads to stuff them down your throats, they’re going down.” Long Chen’s gaze swept across the others as he held onto that disciple.

Those disciples immediately felt like they were being stared at by a god of death. As long as Long Chen willed it, they would lose their lives.

“It’s over! Long Chen seems to be really angry now!” Tang Wan-er looked at Long Chen’s eyes from the image.

Meng Qi helplessly smiled. “It’s well within expectations. His temper was never good, and he almost tried to kill Han Feifei just now. As for these people, they were really dislikable. They kept trying to anger him. Well, now they’ve angered him.”

Chu Yao shrugged, expressing her helplessness. Long Chen was angry now, and no one would be able to stop him.

“Sir...” The testing disciple wanted to advise Long Chen to just have these disciples apologize and let this matter end like that.

“This matter has nothing to do with you. If this place isn’t suitable, I won’t make things hard on you. I’ll drag them somewhere else for them to fulfill their end of the bargain. But if you want to be a mediator, then I’m sorry to tell you that today, they have to either eat these stones for me or die. There is definitely no third path,” interrupted Long Chen.

Long Chen was a human, and he had emotions. Originally, he had been happy to come here, but now he had a belly full of anger.

He didn’t bully others, but he wasn’t the kind of person to take hits without hitting back. Since they wanted to irritate him, he would make sure that they weren’t having a good time.

“Who are you?! Do you know-”

Long Chen pointed a finger, and a lightning arrow flew out, causing half that person’s body to explode.

Everyone was shocked. Long Chen had attacked twice, both times too quickly for them to react and without any warning.

Everyone here was a genius, and even the weakest was a rank seven Celestial. However, by the time any of them could react, Long Chen’s attack was already done. They realized that in front of him, they didn’t even have the slightest ability to resist.

“Either eat it or die. This is the price of your foolishness. Perhaps you’ve gotten used to having a vicious tongue by relying on your status to harm others without them being able to retaliate. However, your luck today isn’t good because my good mood is gone. No one can save you now. So let me repeat it one last time. Eat it or die. You can choose for yourself.” Long Chen’s voice didn’t contain the slightest emotion, and it rang out in everyone’s ears. His icy killing intent made them all shiver.

The two women Long Chen had spoken with were shocked. They had never imagined that the kind and warm man would instantly transform into a life-reaping demon king.

One of the disciples quivered and knelt. He grabbed a piece of stone, crushed it, and placed the fragments in his mouth. He really ate it.

He had no choice but to eat it. Long Chen had locked onto the people who had provoked him with his Spiritual Strength. As soon as they resisted, they knew that Long Chen’s lightning attack would mercilessly cut them down.

If they didn’t eat it, they would die. If they ate it, they would only lose face. In the end, under the threat of death, they submitted.

Following the first one, all those experts, who had said that Long Chen would have to lick their shoes if he didn’t succeed, bent down and crushed a piece of stone, putting the bits into their mouths.

Seeing them start eating the stone, Long Chen’s expression softened slightly. He turned to the testing disciple. “Can I enter now?”

“Yes, of course!” The disciple personally led the way for him, bringing him away from this place.

Once Long Chen left, the disciples eating the stones finally stopped. Their expressions were frighteningly gloomy.

One of the disciples punched a rock, raging, “What a bully! How dare he humiliate us like this?! I’m going to report this to my grandfather. We’ll mobilize the entire sect’s power to kill him!”

“I’d advise you to endure it.”

A man with a sword on his back and a strong aura spoke indifferently from the crowd.

“What do you mean?!” raged that person. If this man wasn’t a rank nine Celestial, while he was just a rank seven Celestial, he might have already attacked him.

“Before this, I went to the Eastern Xuan Region and attended a convention. I think this person comes from the Eastern Xuan Region,” said the sword-bearing man.

“So what if he’s from the Eastern Xuan Region?” That person had yet to understand what the sword-bearing man was saying.

“The Eastern Xuan Region?”

However, other people let out startled cries.

“Could it be...” All their expressions changed. When the Eastern Xuan Region was brought up, they thought of one person.

That person had challenged and defeated the entire Eastern Xuan Region. He had annihilated dozens of sects. Both the Righteous path and the Corrupt paths were shaken by his slaughter. During the Dragon Slaughtering Convention, he had killed until there were mountains of corpses and rivers of blood.

“Heavens, is it really him?!” The woman who had pushed into Long Chen due to the crowd covered her mouth, filled with shock.

Back then, she had felt him to be familiar, but she couldn’t recall knowing such a person. Now, she finally recalled where she knew him from.

Her heart pounded. Not even in her wildest dreams would she have thought that she’d end up intimately touching such a legendary figure by chance.

However, she was curious. Didn’t the stories say that Long Chen was cold-blooded and merciless? He had slaughtered countless people with his vicious means. However, even when she had crashed into him, and when he had saved that other woman, he had only punished the evildoers. Although his methods were tyrannical, they were righteous too. He didn’t seem as a bad a person as the stories made him out to be.

“Is it really... him?” The disciple who had spoken quivered. The others in the same position as him also quivered. They began to sweat.

“I was too far away at the time to see his face. But his face... it’s very familiar.” The sword-bearing man didn’t say anything more after this. Instead, he went to register.

After hearing that, the others didn’t dare to say any more vicious words. Some of them came from top sects, but Long Chen had destroyed at least a hundred sects on his own. How could they dare to provoke him further? Although they weren’t sure it was him, their courage had been broken.

In the end, everyone obediently registered. From start to end, they didn’t bring up that name again, as if it was taboo, as if saying it would bring bad luck on them.

Long Chen didn’t make those people finish eating the whole stone tablet. However, they had to eat at least a bite. This way, they could count as even.

Being led by the female disciple, as soon as he entered a set of gates, a peaceful and natural air rushed over him.
