Chapter 2380 Going Back on One’s Word

Translator: BornToBe

The third legion’s warriors were all kneeling in front of Feng Fei’s carriage, looking like the very image of aggrieved people.

The curtain to the carriage was pulled open, and a tall woman walked out. Her face was icy but attractive.

“This Feng Fei… she’s not as beautiful as I imagined,” whispered Long Chen.

“That’s her servant!” replied Shen Chengfeng.

“Damn, even the servant is so arrogant? Then what of the master?” Long Chen’s lips curled. This maid was already seemingly looking down on everyone, to the point that Long Chen had thought that she was Feng Fei.

The servant pulled open the curtain, and out walked a woman in a red dress. As soon as she appeared, an invisible pressure unfurled.

That woman was definitely far more beautiful but also colder. Her hair was tied up in a high bun, with a golden phoenix pin as an accessory. Her beauty was enough to make others collapse, but that beauty wasn’t something that others could enjoy. It felt like looking at her was committing a sin.

She also had many ornaments on her. Her slender fingers had rings, her wrists had bracelets, her neck had a necklace, and even the string binding her hair was a divine item.

Seeing those various ornaments, Long Chen’s eyes widened. He had previously thought that he had money, but no, this was true money.

His vision was sharp enough to recognize that the golden threads weaving through her hair were a divine material that Guo Ran had looked far and wide for. The Dao Seeking Spirit Gold.

Guo Ran disliked cultivating, so he was always looking for other things that could strengthen himself. Other than his armor, he had thought of a cultivation suit, something that could passively increase his cultivation base even while sleeping. However, although he had designed such a suit, he was lacking many things. One of them was the Dao Seeking Spirit Gold, something that could not be bought on the Martial Heaven Continent.

Feng Fei walked out of the carriage with four female attendants standing behind her. Her gaze didn’t even glance at Ye Lingfeng. Instead, she looked at Long Chen.

“Greetings, senior Feng Fei!”

Shen Chengfeng and the others hastily went down to one knee. Only Long Chen continued to stand there, becoming extremely conspicuous.

“Brazen!” One of Feng Fei’s attendants began to shout.

Feng Fei raised her hand, stopping her. She said, “I hear that you can count as quite the figure on the Martial Heaven Continent. I didn’t expect you to be so shameful.” 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Long Chen shook his head. “Oh? What have I done that is so shameful?”

Feng Fei had clearly received some information in the distress signal or had noticed something from the battlefield. “Your glib mouth makes people look down on you even more.”

“Haha, I’ve never needed others to not look down on me. I don’t live for others to watch me,” laughed Long Chen. “Senior Feng Fei, I know you’re very busy, right? You are in the heavens, and I am on the earth. There’s nothing for us to discuss. There’s also a communication problem between two people from such different places. Let’s both get back to our own work. We still have many things to do. This little home of ours is unworthy for a goddess like yourself, so we won’t invite you in for a stay. Other than that, we just took back our camp, so we have a lot of work to do. I hope you’ll forgive us for our poor hospitality.”

Long Chen turned back to the people behind him. “What are you all kneeling foolishly for? Shouldn’t you get to work? You shameless fellows, all you know how to do is goof off. If the demonic beasts come back, what are we going to do? Clean up the battlefield and repair the camp. We have work to do.”

“You…” Frost appeared on Feng Fei’s face. Within all the divine families, only a few people dared to speak to her like this. Long Chen was turning her away? He was essentially telling her to leave.

“You can’t take them! Those are ours!” roared Ye Lingfeng, getting in their way.

“Damn, you’re this shameless?” Long Chen stared in shock at Ye Lingfeng. “Just now, you swore in front of everyone that as long as we helped, the spoils would be ours.”

“That… that was coerced and can’t count!” declared Ye Lingfeng.

Although backing out was an extreme loss of face, compared to the huge losses he had taken, he didn’t care. Without these spoils of war, he and the rest of the third legion would have to go through many bitter days.

The fallen warriors would have their families compensated partly by the divine families and the legion. If the legion didn’t have the money, the divine families would cover that payment and the legion would have to make up for it later.

The eighth legion didn’t dare to make any big moves partly because they couldn’t afford to lose any more members.

This time, the third legion had lost thousands of warriors, and ignoring their other losses, just the compensation for their deaths would bankrupt them. If they didn’t have these corpses to make up for those losses, they might even have to sell their chariots and the Divine Dragon Tyrant Crossbow to pay for it all.

Without those weapons, they would just be like the eighth legion. It was unknown just how many years it would be before they could recover.

Those huge losses made Ye Lingfeng not care about his face. The points were more important. By borrowing Feng Fei’s pressure, he wanted to force Long Chen and Shen Chengfeng to spit out those spoils.

“Coercion? Hahaha, commander Ye, from the start, you’ve been using schemes. We wanted to take back our camp, so you drew over many demonic beasts to harm us. When we realized this, we fled, and you were ensnared in your own trap. You begged us for help, so we risked our lives to save you. Now you say it was coercion? Hahaha, so these are the teachings of the divine families? You want senior Feng Fei to settle things for you? Alright, then let me see how senior Feng Fei decides on this matter,” said Long Chen.

Feng Fei’s expression sank. The information she had received was that Long Chen had harmed the third legion by using demonic beasts to trap them. But now she understood that things weren’t so simple.

She was angered by this. Ye Lingfeng actually dared to send out a false report. If she had directly suppressed Long Chen, she would have been used by Ye Lingfeng.

“Senior Feng Fei, don’t listen to his nonsense! We were suddenly attacked by demonic beasts and unable to handle them. This is a coincidence!” explained Ye Lingfeng in a panic upon seeing killing intent within Feng Fei’s eyes.

Feng Fei coldly said, “You’re safe now, so my responsibility is done. For anything else, you should find the Heaven Executioner to deal with it. I don’t have time for this nonsense. If you dare to lie to me again, don’t blame me for being vicious.”

Feng Fei turned and entered her carriage. It quickly vanished beyond the horizon.

With Feng Fei gone, Ye Lingfeng was dumbfounded. Long Chen clapped his hands. “Commander Ye, you’ve really opened my eyes to the world. I’ve never seen such shamelessness. But even so, it’s just embarrassing to you. Scram. You only conned yourself. I’ll wait for you to report us to the Heaven Executioner if you wish.”

“Long Chen, just wait! The Ye family won’t let you off!” roared Ye Lingfeng before leaving. The three war chariots were now a bit broken down, and they tottered slightly as they flew through the air. The Divine Dragon Tyrant Crossbow was also moving slowly in such a way that people were worried that it might fall.

“Victory!”

The eighth legion’s warriors cheered. They had never seen tactics played like this. They had taken back their camp and gained countless corpses without spilling a single drop of blood.

Upon cleaning up the battlefield, they realized why Ye Lingfeng would be so shameless as to go back on his word. There really were enough corpses here for him to do that. There was also a line of corpses that stretched far into the distance as a result of Ye Lingfeng shooting the Divine Dragon Tyrant Crossbow on his way here.

“Reporting to the commander, in the distance, the corpses suddenly vanish. Ye Lingfeng must have secretly taken them.”

“Let him. We can just treat it as charity to a beggar. The eighth legion is now rich enough not to be so petty,” laughed Long Chen.

Going through the battlefield took a full day. Once everything was tallied up, Shen Chengfeng almost jumped. The points that they could be exchanged for could strengthen the overall power of the eighth legion by ten times.

However, just at that moment, the higher-ups from the divine families sent orders requesting Long Chen and everyone from the eighth legion to return for an investigation. Their camp would temporarily be left to the second legion.

“This will probably be trouble,” sighed Shen Chengfeng.

“It’ll be fine. I’m used to this kind of thing.” Long Chen patted Shen Chengfeng’s shoulder with a smile. After passing the camp to the second legion, they returned to the divine families. This time, he should be able to learn more about the interior of the divine families.
