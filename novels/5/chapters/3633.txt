Chapter 3622

Endless figures came out from the depths of the Alldevil Star-Field. As their violent devil qi filled the sky, the clear sky instantly became black night. A murderous aura also filled the world.

This was an aura that Long Chen recognized. Back then, that beast of the Alldevil race that he had unleashed in Pill Valley also possessed such an aura.

“If we’re surrounded by the Alldevil race, that will be troublesome.” Guo Ran’s expression changed.

“It’s fine. They’re not coming for us. They’re probably going to Hongying City,” said Long Chen.

“Boss, how do you know?”

“If they are after us, they should be coming at us from every direction. Even if they can’t lie in wait in every direction, at the very least, they should be cutting off our path of retreat. Since they came out of the depths of the Alldevil Star-Field, they were probably attracted by the battle. My guess would be that the Alldevil race wishes to take advantage while the Luo clan and us engage in a life-and-death battle, which would result in both sides being badly wounded. After that, they would come and wipe us all out,” said Long Chen as he eyed that endless devil beast army.

“No way! Didn’t the Alldevil race care deeply about spiritual contracts? Would they betray their oath so recklessly?” Leng Hui didn’t dare to believe it.

“That so-called spiritual contract is like a contract between businessmen. Many of the finer details are actually traps. Such things can’t be relied upon. After all, the Alldevil race is essentially a branch of the devil race. To do business with a group of devils, the Luo clan’s people really are foolish. I originally had a headache about dealing with the families of those traitors. Now, it seems that I don’t need to worry about them.” Long Chen sighed with a complicated expression.

Although he hated the traitors, many amongst their families were truly innocent. Perhaps when they were born, their families had betrayed the human race, and they simply didn’t understand.

After dealing with the traitors, there were still their descendants. Long Chen would let them off. But even if Long Chen let them off, would the rest of the Alldevil Star-Field forgive them for the sins of their ancestors?

To get rid of weeds, you had to pull them out by the roots. An autumn chill would soon blow through this land. Of course, Long Chen would not permit the Alldevil Star-Field’s experts to kill the women and children. While he was here, the Alldevil Star-Field’s people wouldn’t dare to touch them.

But what about after he left? It would be difficult for those people to escape their deaths. After all, many people had died to the Luo clan’s traitors. Their ancestors left them with a blood debt that had to be paid.

Despite all of Long Chen’s wits, he had a headache when it came to the descendants of those traitors. He didn’t know what to do with them.

However, now that the Alldevil race’s army had come. Long Chen already knew what kind of fate those traitors had in store for them.

Their battleship flew through the air. As expected, the Alldevil race didn’t chase them. They quickly saw the sun once more. Looking back in the direction of Hongying City, they merely saw a black world that made them feel cold.

Long Chen took out a jade tablet. He looked at it for a long time before sighing and giving it to Guo Ran.

Guo Ran eyed it in confusion. “An image transmission jade?”

This image transmission jade was a pair with the heaven peering jade. The heaven peering jade was used for spying, while the image transmission jade was what received everything from the heaven peering jade.

After giving Guo Ran the image transmission jade, Long Chen walked to the tail of the battleship. He quietly looked into the distance without saying a word.

Guo Ran and the others looked at each other, not knowing what Long Chen meant by this. Leng Hui suggested, “Should we activate it and take a look?”

Everyone was very curious. They looked at Guo Ran, and Guo Ran activated the jade, causing an image to appear in the air. After that, startled cries rang out.

It was an image of Hongying City. Countless devil beasts were in the midst of devouring the corpses of the human race. The Luo clan’s Qingying Battleships were blazing with divine light as they fought off the devil beasts, trying to escape their encirclement.

“The Alldevil race really has reneged on their agreement. They're slaughtering the traitors!” Xie Qianqian was shocked.

Hongying City was a complete wreck. It was ruined beyond recognition. Other than the Qingying Battleships, there was only a tenth of the original battleships.

Those battleships were trying to break free with the lead of the Qingying Battleships. Despite them doing their best to get through the devil beasts, there were simply too many of them.

BOOM!

Suddenly, a huge explosion shook the land, and a giant figure smashed a staff down on one of the Qingying Battleships.

It was a giant figure dozens of miles tall with a white staff. The staff looked like it was made out of jade and was covered in strange marks. When it struck the Qingying Battleship, it smashed it into the ground, leaving a crater.

The giant roared, shaking the heavens and causing the land to darken. Moreover, his devil qi filled the world, and his eyes were like two blazing suns. Standing there, he caused the ten thousand Daos to wail. Guo Ran and the others were horrified. They had never seen such a terrifying existence before.

“Slaughter all the humans! In the Alldevil race, what I, Alldevil Tianye, say is what counts! The ones to form contracts with the human race have been killed by me. Their agreement is void with us!” shouted the giant, charging at the Qingying Battleship just like that. His staff then smashed down.

The Qingying Battleship that he had just smashed down was struggling up when it was once more struck. After that, its protective divine light shattered and countless cracks covered it. When it struck the ground this time, it fell apart and armored experts came tumbling out.

They had just appeared when countless devil beasts charged up and devoured them.

“Heavens, he destroyed a Qingying Battleship in two attacks?! Just who is he?!” Leng Hui, Xie Liuer, and the others’ expressions all changed.

It had to be known that the Qingying Battleships were said to be unrivaled. Their offense, defense, and speed were all unmatched, and it was precisely due to this that people felt such hatred for the Luo clan. The Qingying Battleship was made to slay the Alldevil race, but they used it to kill humans.

The human race both loved and hated the Qingying Battleship. But no matter what, the Qingying Battleship was still the strongest battleship in people’s hearts. That was unquestionable.

However, this strongest battleship was destroyed in two strikes by that expert who called himself Alldevil Tianye. They were horrified.

Although Long Chen had also destroyed the Qingying Battleships, this Alldevil Tianye did it even more directly. He used pure power to destroy them.

Most terrifying of all was that his aura was clearly only in the Divine Lord realm, but his power surpassed a late stage World King.

Following Alldevil Tianye’s roar, his devil qi swirled around him. He then summoned a manifestation, and with a single strike of his staff, he destroyed all of the Qingying Battleships.

“Boss, boss, look!”

Guo Ran suddenly cried out in terror. Long Chen was startled and hastily ran back over. Looking at the image, when he looked at Alldevil Tianye, Alldevil Tianye suddenly turned and looked at him. It was as if he was seeing Long Chen and the others through space.

“He has spotted us!”

Guo Ran and the others were so terrified that their hair stood on end. A bloodthirsty devil beast had set his sights on them.
