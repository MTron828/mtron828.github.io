Chapter 4030 Rich Boy Bringing Wealth

BOOM!

As Long Chen's golden scales lit up, they enveloped the entire sky with golden divine light, resembling golden battle armor.

Moreover, the brilliance of this golden light was so intense, akin to the radiance of the sun, that it rendered people unable to open their eyes in its presence. Along with its appearance, Long Chen’s overwhelming aura shook the world.

“Did you think that the likes of you could stop me?”

With a thunderous roar, he summoned the Dragon King Battle Armor. It had to be known that after cultivating the Dragon Soul Body Forging Art, the armor now possessed an unparalleled level of might.

Hence, Long Chen exploded with power. While channeling the corporeal and incorporeal powers in his body, he had the desire to shatter heaven and earth with a punch.

At this moment, the Alldevil expert charged at Long Chen with his spear, and the power of a three-flower Earth Venerate crashed down upon him.

The spear was like a demonic dragon striking from its cave, letting out a furious roar. However, when a golden hand caught the spear head, that wild spear instantly turned silent. Even the spear’s runes rapidly dimmed until they vanished.

“Run!”

Seeing this, all the other experts of the Alldevil race rushed forward to assist. As for the attacker, he was shocked. His spear, once fierce and unyielding, now seemed as helpless as a mad dog facing a mighty dragon, losing its connection to him.

A chilling sensation of death then engulfed the elder, prompting him to flee even before the others could shout at him to do so.

“Do you think that you can run?”

Long Chen then snorted and shoved the spear, and it instantly reached that elder of the Alldevil race.

In front of countless shocked gazes, the spear pierced through the elder’s body and continued to strike the other experts of the Alldevil race that were rushing over.

The spear was shockingly fast, and another three-flower Divine Venerate smashed his own spear at it to block it.

BOOM!

As a result, both of the spears exploded, and that Alldevil race’s elder hacked up blood, unable to receive even a single attack from Long Chen.Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

“Useless trash, scram! Long Chen’s life is mine!”

At this moment, Kun Tu’s icy voice rang out, and a golden wing slashed down like a heavenly blade.

Unable to react in time, Long Chen was smashed into the ground by the wing. That enormous wing practically pierced through the earth, causing cracks to spread beyond the horizon.

Even the three-flower Earth Venerates were left trembling in fear by the overwhelming might of this attack. Such ferocity was unheard of in their lifetimes.

What was most astonishing was that this devastating power emanated solely from the physical prowess of the body. Devoid of any fluctuations from the Heavenly Daos, it was a force that struck with the swiftness of lightning and proved challenging to detect beforehand

Seeing that huge Kunpeng figure, all the people here were filled with awe. The Kunpeng race was indeed worthy of being a legendary supreme existence.

Just as everyone thought that the battle was over and that Long Chen was smashed apart by that blow, Kun Tu’s giant body began to quiver.

“What?!”

The earth continued to crack, and Kun Tu’s wing pressed deeper into the ground. The ground was deforming from the immense power.

“Long Chen’s still not dead?”

Everyone was shaken. Long Chen hadn’t had any defenses just then, so that attack should have been fatal.

“No, he’s not pressing down, he’s…!”

At this time, they were horrified to see that Kun Tu’s claws were bracing against the ground not to press down with his wing, but in an attempt to drag his wing out of the ground.

It was as if something under the ground was dragging his wing into the earth.

Even the Kunpeng patriarch’s expression changed. He then transformed into a giant Kunpeng and grabbed Kun Tu, dragging him away.

The next moment, a rain of blood fell. Kun Tu was pulled away, but his wing was forcibly ripped off.

“AHH!”

Kun Tu shrieked in pain. These wings were the greatest treasure he had obtained from their ancestral lands. As for his original wings, they had been torn off by Long Chen, practically crippling him.

So, in order to gain greater power, Kun Tu had ventured into the ancestral lands and inherited an ancestor’s wings. However, as those wings possessed his ancestor’s runes, after merging with them, he was unable to control his realm and directly soared into the World King realm.

According to reason, that was a good thing. But in truth, it was like plucking out sprouts to make them grow taller, severely damaging his foundation. He would quickly find himself reaching his cultivation limit.

However, Kun Tu no longer cared about it. The impact of being defeated by Long Chen in the three thousand worlds was a serious blow to him. If he couldn’t get his revenge, let alone reaching his limit, he would probably have never been able to advance out of the Immortal King realm.

Inheriting these wings caused his power to soar. Even then, these wings weren’t his, so in order to truly display their power, he required time to merge with them.

But when he received news of Long Chen’s whereabouts, how could he wait? He directly charged over. As a result, the foundation of his wings was superficial, and now one of them was forcibly ripped off.

“Long Chen!”

Kun Tu roared. This was not the result that he had wanted, completely different from what he had anticipated.

Before coming, he had thought of countless ways to torment Long Chen. In fact, he had even thought about what move to use on Long Chen in order to prevent himself from accidentally killing Long Chen.

So, now that his wing had been torn off again, he was overwhelmed by shock and rage. His head was blank. After all, the reality was far too different from his goal.

Even the Kunpeng patriarch hadn’t expected this. What infuriated him the most was that Kun Tu had explicitly told him that he had reached the third step of merging these wings with his body.

However, for his wing to be torn off just like that, it was clear that he hadn’t reached that step. In his urgency to kill Long Chen, Kun Tu had actually lied to the Kunpeng patriarch.

That giant wing vanished. After that, space twisted, and Long Chen appeared with Kun Tu’s original wings.

Long Chen was amazed to find that this wing possessed an immemorial aura, which made him realize that these wings were not ones that Kun Tu had grown again, but treasures that he had inherited.

Also, only a very small portion of this wing’s runes had been activated. Clearly, Kun Tu was unable to unleash their full power, but he had still come to get revenge.

Now, Kun Tu was no longer an enemy in Long Chen’s eyes, but an adorable rich boy sending him wealth.

Long Chen had just refined his wings and was still immersed in his joy over their speed, but Kun Tu was already in a rush to send him another set.

At the same time, Long Chen was grateful to the dragon expert. If it was up to him, he would have already killed Kun Tu in the three thousand worlds. Then he wouldn’t have such a nice treasure.

“Did no one teach you to give gifts in pairs? If you’re going to give me such a nice gift, I’ll respectfully receive it!”

Long Chen shot after Kun Tu with flames bursting out of his body, making him look like a blazing sphere.

“Ignorant brat, die!”

Seeing this, the Kunpeng patriarch roared furiously. Long Chen was actually ignoring him and coming straight at Kun Tu. That was a complete disdain of his existence.

He immediately attacked, his sharp claws raking through the air, sealing Long Chen’s path.

However, what no one had expected was for Long Chen’s body to suddenly explode before these claws even touched him.

In that instant, the Kunpeng patriarch’s expression changed. As he turned around, a scene of horror greeted him: Kun Tu let out a piercing scream and a cascade of blood followed. Behind him stood Long Chen, holding yet another bloody wing.
