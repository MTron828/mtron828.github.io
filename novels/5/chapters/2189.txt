Chapter 2179 The Peerless Beauty, Xue Luocha

In a distant stream of qi flow, hundreds of thousands of the ancient family alliance’s experts had gathered.

During this time, the experts of the continent had tried charging into the streams of qi flow. Any rank nine Celestial or Empyrean could freely enter and receive the blessing of the qi flow.

However, rank eight Celestials and below couldn’t enter. They were rejected by the qi flow, so they could only absorb the qi scattered through the air. That was the difference between those blessed by the heavens and those not. Empyreans were given the meat, while the rest were given some diluted soup, and only a few drops at that.

The ancient family alliance was a giant organization. As more and more of their members arrived, the number of people in their stream of qi flow swelled to over seven hundred thousand. Although the Martial Heaven Alliance in comparison was close to ten million people at this point, the ancient family alliance’s group was still a spectacular sight.

Within their large group, an extravagant carriage appeared. A man and woman walked out, holding hands. The beauty that Mo Nian was referring to was the woman.

Meng Qi, Chu Yao, Tang Wan-er, and everyone’s gaze immediately fell on that woman. They were all confident in their own looks, so they wanted to see what this peerless beauty looked like.

However, when they saw that woman, they held back choked cries, covering their mouths.

“How is she? Beautiful, right?” laughed Mo Nian.

“Mo Nian, your tastes are growing heavier.” Even Long Chen was shaken by this woman’s appearance.

She was wider than she was tall, and she was actually taller than Long Chen. From a distance, she looked like a large balloon. Her neck was nonexistent. As for her head, all her facial features were scrunched up in one spot. Her eyes were two narrow slits.

She tottered as she walked, her flesh trembling. It was like a mountain of meat moving.

Beside her was a more conventionally attractive man. The two of them made a striking pair.

“That’s... Di Feng?” Long Chen recognized the man. It was Di Long’s son.

“Hehe, so you still remember him. Di Feng had a wedding just three days ago, and that’s his wife.” Mo Nian laughed delightedly.

“Are you saying that she is...?”

“Yes, that woman is the Blood Emperor’s family’s top genius, the Blood Emperor’s daughter, Xue Luocha.”

Long Chen’s jaw dropped. He suddenly recalled the two descendants of the Blood Emperor that he had encountered before. When he had asked if Xue Luocha was beautiful, they had said that she was beautiful enough to eclipse the moon and shame flowers. Now he understood. Even the moon would hide upon seeing her, and flowers would turn away, too embarrassed to look at her.

As Xue Luocha tottered across the ground, her arms bounced like large carrots. They swung back and forth, swinging with a waist that was indistinguishable from the rest of her body.

In all of Long Chen’s life, it was his first time feeling sympathy for one of his enemies. Seeing Di Feng’s wooden expression, the hostility Long Chen felt for him vanished.

Seeing Xue Luocha, every man present involuntarily shuddered.

“I never thought that Di Feng was a real man before. But even such a woman doesn’t satisfy him. You can tell he wants more. Tell me, grandmaster Long Chen, can you explain why he would desire such a thing?” chortled Mo Nian.

“It cannot be said in too much detail.”

“Then give a general explanation.”

“I already said, it cannot be said that she’s too thin.”[1]

Mo Nian looked at Xue Luocha’s terrifying girth and instantly understood. He couldn’t hold back another laugh.

“It must be hard on Di Feng. This is truly a case of being too far away to help.”[2] Long Chen sighed, exchanged a glance with Mo Nian, and then the two of them laughed once more.

“What are the two of you talking about?” demanded Liu Zongying, lost.

“Cough, we were saying that the two of them were drawn together by fate. They’re a perfect match for each other,” lied Long Chen.

Meng Qi and the others were red. Having experience with Long Chen’s scoundrel ways, they knew he lied. Although they didn’t understand completely, they could guess his general meaning.

Di Feng was holding hands with Xue Luocha. His hand was enveloped by a mass of flesh. Just the sight of it was comical.

“Di Feng is truly blessed. He can reach just by standing there,” praised Mo Nian.

This time, Liu Zongying seemed to understand. Xue Luocha was tall and her chest was gigantic. Just one of them was larger than Di Feng’s head. When standing still, his head was on the same level as her chest.

“Mo Nian, you bastard, if you envy him so much, why don’t you just go?!” raged Liu Zongying.

Mo Nian rolled his eyes. Liu Zongying didn’t seem to be able to tell the difference between good and bad things. All he was doing was relishing in the downfall of his old enemy, and she was getting jealous.

Even Tang Wan-er found it funny and wasn’t able to get jealous of Xue Luocha. As expected, no matter in which field, there was always someone stronger.

Long Chen and Mo Nian’s scoundrel-like chortling made Meng Qi and the others laugh. The two of them were top figures on the continent with countless worshippers, but now they didn’t seem to possess the slightest air of supreme experts.

Long Chen and Mo Nian’s laughter reached Di Feng’s ears. He was enraged, but he couldn’t react. This was the wife that Di Long had arranged for him, and it had been impossible for him to decline. He was also a figure capable of shaking the world, but now he was being laughed at.

“Husband, don’t be angry. It’s not healthy for you. Those two blind fellows will be killed by me in a bit,” comforted Xue Luocha quietly.

“Then why not just attack now? I don’t want to look at them for one more second!” raged Di Feng.

“Husband, calm down. Now isn’t the time to truly take action. Just wait a moment and watch the scene change,” said Xue Luocha.

By this point, it had been an hour since the qi flow eruption had started. Practically, all the continent’s experts had flown over.

Those part of a faction joined their faction. Those without a faction could only occupy a qi flow stream suitable to them. They couldn’t pick a big one since they were worried about others taking it from them, while picking a small one was letting themselves down.

The true power of the continent was revealed. Many powerful sects had come. Even some sects that rarely showed their faces in the ancient era had come out.

The Skywood Divine Palace, the Illusive Music Immortal Palace, the Divine Ice Palace, the Heaven Reaching Ancient Castle, countless powerful forces had taken their own positions. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

Zi Yan was with eight thousand of the Illusive Music Immortal Palace’s disciples, standing in a qi flow stream. Every one of them was sitting cross-legged, a zither resting on their knees.

Rather than competitors for the qi flow, they seemed more like musicians waiting for a chance to perform.

They had occupied a large stream, however, they didn’t occupy it alone. Other powers were allowed in as long as they didn’t disturb them.

The seniors of the various powers had also come. However, they were unable to step into the qi flow streams because they were not the main characters of this era. They were rejected by the qi flow.

Outside of the Divine Ice Palace’s stream, Daoist Heavenly Feather was standing quietly, looking up at the sky where the qi flow streams soared and then slowly spread throughout the continent.

The senior generation of the Divine Ice Palace was standing behind her. The majority of them were women, and the faintest warmth appeared in their eyes when they saw Ye Zhiqiu.

As fellow ice cultivators they could sense her current state. Although she was now in the Dragonblood Legion, the mark of a disciple of the Divine Ice Palace was still on her.

The arrival of Daoist Heavenly Feather put quite some pressure on the other seniors. She was so old that it was frightening. Her looks had been frozen in time. She still looked like a young beauty, but her name alone was able to shake the continent.

Suddenly, the earth began to shake, and the rumbling in the air grew quiet. Even the qi flow streams grew gentle.

“The true eruption is about to start. The bloody slaughter is about to begin as well.” Daoist Heavenly Feather sighed.

As the ground stopped trembling, the qi flow streams grew gentler. However, as time passed, the aura of the Heavenly Daos within the qi flow streams grew stronger, and the spiritual qi was more condensed.

Spiderweb-like cracks covered the earth. Every criss-cross became a qi flow stream. As for the place Long Chen occupied, it was the core of all the streams.

BOOM!

After a brief moment of calm, the second eruption came. It was ten times stronger than before.

“Long Chen, this qi flow stream isn’t something a traitor of the Martial Heaven Continent can occupy!” Dongfang Yuyang finally took action, leading the Dongfang family’s disciples over to Long Chen’s qi flow stream.

Following Dongfang Yuyang, several others moved. Ximen Tianxiong, Tian Xiezi, Kun Pengzi, and Xue Luocha led their people over.

The real battle was about to erupt!

[2] This expression that means too far to be able to help is literally written as ‘a whip that cannot reach’. The character for whip can sometimes mean penis.
