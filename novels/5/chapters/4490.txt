Chapter 4479 Miraculous Golden Lotus Seed

“You sense him again?!”

Long Chen’s expression completely changed. Last time, he had severed Yu Qingxuan’s connection with the Nether Emperor, ensuring she was no longer a daughter of the Nether Emperor. However, she could now sense the Nether Emperor’s presence again.

“I feel like he is staring at me, as if he’s omnipresent, watching every move I make. It’s as though a sinister presence is lurking in the shadows, observing me. I can’t shake this feeling, and it’s only intensifying,” expressed Yu Qingxuan fearfully.

Upon discovering that she was a daughter of the Nether Emperor and destined to be consumed by him, she had to accept her fate. However, everything changed when she crossed paths with Long Chen. Suddenly, she found herself reluctant to accept the grim destiny that awaited her. She didn’t want to die and wanted to be with Long Chen forever. For the first time, she was confronted with the fear of losing something precious.

“Big Sister, don’t worry. We’ll stand by your side and fight the Nether Emperor together,” promised Bai Shishi, holding her hand.

Long Chen’s expression also grew serious. He then asked the Earth Cauldron, “Senior, what do I have to do to fully sever the connection between the Nether Emperor and Qingxuan?”

“To be a daughter of the Nether Emperor is to be a seed of the Nether Emperor. They are the seeds sown by the Nether Emperor for his revival. Unless you can kill him, this connection will not vanish,” explained the Earth Cauldron.

Long Chen sank into thought. The implication was evident—this connection could not be severed, and the Nether Emperor would be able to find her at any moment.

A surge of anger coursed through Long Chen. Qingxuan’s fear pained him, yet he found himself powerless in the face of this inescapable fate.

“The golden lotus seed you possess is miraculous, and its blessing can temporarily shield Yu Qingxuan from the Nether Emperor’s gaze. However, this effect has a time limit. Once she can sense the Nether Emperor again, you will need to carry out the blessing once more,” said the Earth Cauldron.

Hearing the Earth Cauldron characterize the golden lotus seed as miraculous, Long Chen felt a mix of astonishment and joy. As one of the ten great primal chaos divine items, the Earth Cauldron wouldn’t casually label anything as miraculous. Hence, the origins of the golden lotus seed had to be shocking.

Long Chen hadn’t expected the seed given to him by the mysterious Aunt Gong in the Heavenly Flame World would be a treasure of this caliber.

“Can I give the seed to Qingxuan?” asked Long Chen hastily.

“This golden lotus seed isn’t something that can be given away casually. There are certai—well, some things are better left unsaid. Just understand that you are the only one who can use it,” replied the Earth Cauldron.

Hearing this, Long Chen was shaken. It seemed that the golden lotus seed was of extraordinary importance.

After that, Long Chen told Yu Qingxuan to sit still, while he communed with the golden lotus seed. Obediently following his will, the small golden lotus seed materialized above Yu Qingxuan. As its divine light enveloped her, Yu Qingxuan quivered. The fear and nervousness on her face instantly softened, and she seemed to relax instantly.

As more light fell on her, a golden mark appeared on Yu Qingxuan’s forehead, looking identical to the mark of the golden lotus seed. After this mark materialized, Yu Qingxuan smiled contentedly. She could no longer sense the will of the Nether Emperor; she felt free.

Then, the golden lotus seed returned to the primal chaos space. It seemed that carrying out this blessing hadn’t depleted much of its energy, which brought relief to Long Chen.

“Long Chen, I’m free! I can no longer sense the will of the Nether Emperor,” said Yu Qingxuan excitedly.

“The golden lotus seed’s blessing can temporarily shield you from the Nether Emperor’s senses. At the very least, you won’t sense his presence for several months. If you ever feel it again in the future, just let me know, and I’ll carry out the blessing again. This will also help assess the effectiveness of the blessing,” explained Long Chen.

The Earth Cauldron was the one predicting the expiration date of the blessing. However, as the exact time wasn’t something it could confirm, they would need to test it first.

Yu Qingxuan nodded obediently. Free from the oppressive gaze of the Nether Emperor, she felt considerably more at ease, and her bright smile lightened the atmosphere.

The three of them continued to talk and laugh, unaware that night had fallen. They eventually lay down on the ground, with Yu Qingxuan on Long Chen’s left side and Bai Shishi on the right.

Long Chen rested on the ground, looking at the starry sky as his mind immersed in the stars. Through his heightened senses, he caught the mental whispers between Yu Qingxuan and Bai Shishi. The soothing melodies of birds and insects filled his ears, evoking an unparalleled sense of peace within his heart.

Suddenly, Yu Qingxuan raised her head and rested it on Long Chen’s shoulder. Under the starlight, Bai Shishi could see Qingxuan’s smile and wink.

Immediately, Bai Shishi blushed. Yu Qingxuan wanted her to sleep on Long Chen’s other shoulder, but Bai Shishi was too embarrassed to do so.

Suddenly, a powerful hand drew her in, intensifying Bai Shishi's blush as she instinctively struggled. However, Long Chen persisted and firmly nestled her head against his shoulder.

Bai Shishi felt a wave of embarrassment, but after a brief struggle, she succumbed, sensing her heart pounding. As she was overwhelmed, her chat with Yu Qingxuan also came to a halt.

The world became silent as the two of them were using Long Chen’s shoulders as pillows. All they could hear was each other’s breathing and heartbeat. At this moment, the world seemed to freeze.

Long Chen stealthily patted Bai Shishi’s shoulder, causing a quiver from her as she bit her lip, holding back tears that threatened to spill.

In an instant, Bai Shishi comprehended Long Chen’s feelings. Although it was just a light pat on the shoulder, it conveyed a depth of emotion that resonated fully with her.

Bai Shishi knew that Long Chen liked her but struggled to get closer to her, always cautious not to say something that could provoke her. She also knew that Long Chen had many wives, yet she still chose to be with him. Given her prideful nature, only she knew how much grief she had to endure.

Long Chen was well aware of her sacrifices. However, mutual understanding required time, and the two of them hadn't had many moments alone to navigate and explore these emotions together.

Even so, Long Chen couldn’t afford to spend so much time with his women. Hence, although it was just a pat on the shoulder, Bai Shishi could sense the depth of Long Chen's feelings for her.

At that moment, she felt like all her sacrifices were worth it. At the very least, Long Chen was always thinking of her, caring for her, and carefully protecting her feelings.

Enveloped in the tranquil sounds of each other’s heartbeat and breathing, the three of them drifted into sleep. As the sun gradually rose, warming the earth, the abrupt gust of wind startled them awake.

“Big Brother Long Chen, the academy has sent an urgent summons for you,” announced Ye Xue from a great distance.DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎
