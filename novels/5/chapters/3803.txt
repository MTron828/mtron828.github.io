BANG!

When that devil expert was smacked by the shovel, his body stiffened. He directly flew into the hole that Mo Nian had just dug. By the time his body landed, his life aura had completely vanished. He died just like that.

Long Chen jumped in shock. Previously, when Mo Nian’s attack had killed the first Divine Venerate, he hadn’t found it to be surprising. But this shovel didn’t seem to possess much power, and yet after being struck, their souls directly scattered.

Just like that, Mo Nian was like a ghost, striking seven Divine Venerates in a row. Those devil experts’ expressions completely changed. Only at this moment did they realize that this wretched-looking fellow was actually a terrifying monster.

“Run!”

One of the surviving Divine Venerates directly led the retreat.

But all of a sudden, Mo Nian’s shovel vanished and was replaced by an ancient black bow. It was covered in black scales and had nine snake heads on top of it. Each side had four, with one in the center. When Mo Nian pulled back the bowstring, those black scales unleashed black ripples that condensed into a black arrow.

In that instant, heaven and earth changed color. The sunny sky became covered in a black curtain, and a chilly death qi shook the entire world. It was like the life of the entire world was sucked away.

When Mo Nian released the bowstring, a black streak of lightning left the bow and transformed into hundreds of arrows.

Those arrows flew in strange arcs to pierce the bodies of the devil experts. The instant the devil experts were struck by the arrows, their bodies stiffened and they fell from the sky.

Mo Nian once more switched weapons, taking out his shovel again. Before their corpses even fell to the ground, he appeared beside them and struck them one at a time with his shovel, sending them into his hole.

He then covered the corpses with dirt. His movements were clean and practiced. With a few pats, the earth returned to its normal appearance as if nothing had happened.

After all of that, Mo Nian took out a bag. Walking around that land, he grabbed something from the bag and threw it into the sky, solemnly chanting, “Dust to dust, earth to earth. Life is bitterly floating across the sea of desires. Now that I have sent you to the yellow springs, this life’s karma is passed to the next life. On the three great paths to the yellow springs, walk the southwest. Don’t look back. This life will never return.”

After saying that, the thing Mo Nian had thrown into the sky slowly floated down. It was yellow paper money. Mo Nian actually held a spiritual ceremony for the devil experts he had killed.Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

If people hadn’t seen him kill so ruthlessly and take his victims’ weapons and treasures, if they only saw his current appearance of weeping for the sadness of humanity, they really would be tricked by him and take him to be some wise Daoist.

“May I ask if this great Daoist’s ceremony can allow those departed souls to rest in peace and live a life of peace forever?” Long Chen walked over, smiling at Mo Nian’s divine act.

Mo Nian quivered when he heard his voice. He then turned to look at Long Chen, and his eyes widened. He was delighted. But he suppressed those emotions and solemnly said, “Sir’s words are lacking. We are people who cultivate the Dao. We are all living, and we all accumulate karma. This karma follows people even to the next life. Only living people can reform and turn over a new leaf, giving them a chance to lighten their karma.”

“To put it bluntly, it’s an act of the dead people for the living to see?” said Long Chen.

“Ah, sir is wise. Admirable. This poor Daoist sees that you are exceptionally talented. Those pure bones, that pure gaze, I can see that there is a great business to be done between us. I wish to collaborate with you. Is sir interested?” Mo Nian managed to keep up his solemnity at the start, but his last two lines were clearly filled with a wretched flavor.

“Hahaha!”

The two of them exchanged a look and laughed at the same time. The two of them then hugged emotionally. They were finally meeting again.

Mo Nian also hugged every single Dragonblood warrior present. These old friends of the Martial Heaven Continent felt incomparably close.

“Wait for me. The ritual isn’t complete yet. I’m still missing the final step, but I’ll be done soon!”

Mo Nian proceeded to circle the burial land three times clockwise and then three times counterclockwise. He continued to chant and only finished after spouting a large mass of words.

“What is up with the ritual? Why go to such great lengths?” asked Long Chen.

“Exactly! It’s so irritating! After killing people, I actually have to bury them and perform a ritual for their souls! This is the rule of our Limitless Palace. I have to respect it. That’s why I rarely kill people now. Normally, I won’t bother unless I’m forced to. I really envy you. You can kill people and just forget about it. But I have to kill, bury, and then perform a ritual. It’s so troublesome.” Mo Nian shrugged helplessly

However, a pleased smile then appeared on his face. “Long Chen, in the immortal world, my name is far more resounding than yours! I am the next palace master of the Limitless Palace, and I’ve already awakened the Limitless Immortal Palace manifestation. From now on, just follow me, your big brother, and I guarantee that you’ll have good food to eat and spicy wine to drink.”

Long Chen smiled. Mo Nian’s character really hadn’t changed. On the Martial Heaven Continent, he had been secretly competing with Long Chen to be the most famous person on the continent.

Now that they were in the immortal world, he really hadn’t let up. He still wanted to be above Long Chen in fame.

“Mo Nian, you bastard, you absolute brute!”

Mo Nian had just finished saying this when countless experts appeared over the horizon like a flood. Their numbers were in the millions, and there were people from various races. Just the Divine Venerates alone numbered more than a hundred.

“Run! Enter the city!”

Mo Nian directly patted his butt and fled into the city.

“Didn’t you say that if I followed you, I’d have good food to eat and spicy wine to drink? What happened to that?” asked Long Chen as he followed. Mo Nian had just finished bragging when he slapped himself in the face.

“There’s definitely no problem with the eating and drinking but nothing else,” said Mo Nian shamelessly.

“What? How are you able to say something so shameless? Fine, you really are stronger than before,” said Long Chen. The people charging over were gnashing their teeth furiously. It was as if Mo Nian had killed their fathers and stolen their wives. That was the level of hatred they had for him.

“What’s going on? Why do they hate you so much?” asked Long Chen.

“Who knows? You also know who I am. Other than being fond of archaeology, researching historical remains, uncovering the secrets of the ancients, continuing their inheritances, I’m not interested in anything else,” said Mo Nian bashfully.

Hearing that, Long Chen instantly understood. Mo Nian had definitely robbed their ancestral tombs. However, these people came from hundreds of different races. Long Chen didn’t know how many tombs Mo Nian had robbed to cause so many people to chase after him.

Suddenly, divine light shuddered above the city, and countless sharp blades condensed, pointing at those people.

“Halt! Only humans are allowed in Clear Sky City. The rest of you must stop or be executed.”

With that shout, that tide of experts came to a stop. In the end, Long Chen, Mo Nian, and the others walked into the city under their torrent of curses and verbal abuses.
