Chapter 3712 Ten Thousand Flames Burn the Heavens

Xia Chen’s fist smashed into He Changtian’s spear tip. As a result, a giant sphere of light erupted between them. It was like two worlds colliding.

BOOM!

Astral winds raged. Their spear and fist remained locked in the air, neither moving even an inch.

Both of their battle armors shone brightly as they tried to suppress the other. But they remained deadlocked. Was neither able to defeat the other?

“Wow, I didn’t expect junior brother Xia Chen to be so powerful!” Yin Ting was delighted to see Xia Chen be so powerful. He actually blocked that spear barehanded.

All the Vermilion Bird Empire’s experts were delighted to see this. They clenched their fists as if that could help Xia Chen fight.

“Boss, when did Xia Chen get so strong?” Guo Ran was dumbfounded. This was too strong, wasn’t it? It was only because Guo Ran had a Supreme Bone that he dared to receive divine weapons with his bare hand. But Xia Chen didn’t have one, so how could he do this?

“Xia Chen was originally very strong. It’s simply that he was restricted by Liao Bencang’s faith domain on the Nine Underworld Island, so he never had a chance to display his power. Furthermore, he’s smart. Look more closely. Every single one of his dragon scales has a tiny talisman embedded within it. 108,000 scales, 108,000 talismans. For him to activate so many talismans at once, tell me, how could he not be strong?” asked Long Chen.

With Long Chen’s reminder, Guo Ran looked more closely. He saw the tiny talismans now, but they were so small that they couldn’t be seen without looking very closely.

“I knew it! This fellow’s Dragon Blood Battle Armor is almost as strong as yours! So it’s because of the support of so many talismans.” Guo Ran nodded. If it was like this, he didn’t feel it to be too shocking. In fact, he felt it to be simply natural.

Xia Chen’s talismans were all amazing. A single talisman had shocking power. If there were so many talismans together, then it was only natural for them to be so powerful.

BOOM!

Suddenly, the light between the two of them exploded. Both of them were blown back as the two of them ended up even.

“You only rely on talismans! Do you think that relying on those external powers is enough to survive?!” He Changtian sneered and once more shot toward Xia Chen.Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Just talismans? You really are foolish. If it weren’t for your Heavenly Ruler Seal Battle Armor, if it weren’t for the talismans on it, you would already be a corpse. You dare to say such big words?” retorted Xia Chen. He Changtian kept accusing him of using external powers, while forgetting that the majority of his combat power stemmed from his battle armor.

He Changtian was enraged but had no way of arguing. His mocking now became a slap to his own face.

At this moment, He Changtian’s spear quivered and ten thousand spear-images shot out. He was expelling all of his anger.

With the protection of the Dragon Blood Battle Armor, completely barehanded, Xia Chen swung his fists and dragon cry rang out. Without retreating, he received He Changtian’s attacks just like that.

As a result, rubble flew through the air, and flames devoured the sky. The spectators were all amazed. A battle on this level was truly rarely seen.

“What is going on? Talisman cultivators actually fight in close range? Brothers, I’m also a talisman cultivator. Why did my master never tell me about this?” shouted someone in the crowd.

“Most importantly, he’s in close-range combat against someone possessing Supreme Blood. Is he challenging our understanding of the world?” shouted someone else.

Talisman cultivators, spirit cultivators, soul cultivators, magic cultivators, and others had weak physical bodies. This was simply common knowledge. However, Xia Chen was toppling that common knowledge. If they didn’t personally see it, they wouldn’t believe it.

Xia Chen and He Changtian continued to fight. Xia Chen’s fists danced against the flying spear. Both of them were fighting intensely.

Long Chen smiled as he watched Xia Chen fight. This fighting style was very similar to his own. Xia Chen was clearly imitating Long Chen’s close-range fighting style.

However, Xia Chen’s power stemmed mostly from the talismans on his dragon armor. His dragon blood was only the vector carrying the power of his talismans. After all, he wasn’t really a close-range fighter. There was some loss in the power transfer, and that was difficult to avoid.

Despite that, it was more than enough to fight He Changtian. After all, Long Chen had never lost to anyone in close-range combat. For Xia Chen to be able to learn this much was enough.

However, at this time, Xia Chen’s talismans began to flicker badly. Guo Ran also noticed this problem. “Boss, it seems that if this continues, Xia Chen won’t be able to last much longer?”

Long Chen nodded. “Xia Chen’s talismans are still affected in He Changtian’s domain. His talismans should normally be able to absorb the energy of heaven and earth as an unending supply of energy. With this number of talismans together, it's practically equivalent to a sect’s grand formation. But it’s only been an incense stick’s worth of time before they start flashing. That’s a warning that the amount of energy that they’re absorbing is unable to keep up with their energy usage. But don’t worry, Xia Chen is currently borrowing He Changtian’s power to test his talismans’ power and endurance. He hasn’t used his true trump cards. Hehe, the real thing has yet to appear.”

As expected, as they continued to fight at this intensity, Xia Chen began to show signs of weakening. He was gradually forced back by He Changtian. Although it wasn’t to the point of being defeated, he was clearly the one being pressed.

“As I said, relying on external power means nothing! If you have no power yourself, all that awaits you is death!” shouted He Changtian. Seeing Xia Chen weakening, He Changtian’s Blood Qi circulated rapidly, and his aura strengthened once more.

“Heavens, He Changtian still wasn’t using his full power? He was waiting for this!”

“He wants to decide life and death in the next few moves! He’s not giving Long Chen a chance to save him!”

People could tell that He Changtian was hell-bent on killing Xia Chen and was waiting for this chance to suddenly overwhelm him.

People glanced at Long Chen, looking for his reaction. But unexpectedly, there was no reaction at all from Long Chen. He was still calmly watching.

“Heavenly Ruler Seal Revival, Ten Thousand Beasts Appear, Wild Lion Awakening, Devour the Nine Heavens!”

He Changtian swept out his spear and formed seals with his other hand. As his entire body began to burn, tens of thousands of rays of divine light shot out of his armor. Every light contained its own flaming beast.

Tens of thousands of beasts appeared at once, instantly locking down this entire space. Just like that, all the beasts that had been sealed in the Heavenly Ruler Seal Battle Armor were awakened at once, and their sharp killing intent instantly locked onto Xia Chen.

Furthermore, the Heavenly Ruler Seal Wild Lion within He Changtian’s manifestation actually stuck half its head out of the manifestation.

It roared, and the tens of thousands of beasts opened their mouths. Flames then shot out like furious arrows toward Xia Chen.

“Die! Ten Thousand Flames Burn the Heavens!”

He Changtian roared. Those flames all converged on Xia Chen, who was instantly devoured by a domain of death with nowhere to run.
