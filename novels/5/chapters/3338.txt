Chapter 3327 Heavenly Rainbow Chooses a Master

One of the supreme experts was slain by Long Chen just like this. His fresh blood filled the air. However, his blood mist was so dense and didn’t scatter for a long time. It was as if his will still remained, unwilling to fade away just like this.

Long Chen was too terrifying. His power, speed, reactions, and experience were all at the top. He was practically invulnerable.

Just then, rumbling rang out. At some point, the rainbow hydrangeas stopped falling. A rainbow light then appeared in the sky.

“The Heavenly Rainbow Flame seed!”

Startled cries rang out. This signified that the Heavenly Rainbow Flame was about to choose a master. Long Chen had endless rainbow hydrangeas behind him. Ninety-nine percent of them had been absorbed by him.

Just then, Mo Yan’s hydrangeas lit up. A pillar of divine light erupted out of them and landed on the seed of the Heavenly Rainbow Flame. It quivered and also emitted a ray of light that fell on Mo Yan.

“How can this be?! The Heavenly Rainbow Flame is choosing Mo Yan?!”

The human spectators were shocked and enraged. They couldn’t believe their eyes. Long Chen had obtained so many rainbow hydrangeas, but he wasn’t chosen?

“Hahaha, I am the destined one! The Heavenly Rainbow Flame is mine!” Mo Yan laughed excitedly.

However, his laughter was suddenly cut off by the stroke of a bone saber. Long Chen shot toward him furiously. He had gathered so many rainbow hydrangeas, but the Heavenly Rainbow Flame actually chose Mo Yan. That was intolerable. Feeling furious, Long Chen shouted, “Since you’re the destined one, I’ll be taking your life!”

“With just you? Keep dreaming!” Mo Yan laughed and suddenly formed one-handed seals. Countless runes then lit up on top of his spatial gate. After that, chains shot out and merged into his back. He pointed his spear at Long Chen.

BOOM!

A huge explosion caused all light to vanish from the world. The sun and moon turned dark, and the immense explosion shattered people’s eardrums. They were unable to hear anything.

This time, the one to be sent flying was Long Chen. Blood dripped down his hand and his bone saber. It was the first time that he was injured today.Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

“Hahaha, do you think that I didn’t come prepared? No matter how strong you are, Long Chen, you are nothing more than an ant in front of the devil world’s laws.” Mo Yan laughed, countless black runes appearing all over his body. Every rune contained the laws of the Devil Dao.

The current Mo Yan had finally used his ultimate trump card. With the support of the devil world’s laws, he was unmatched.

Just then, the rainbow hydrangeas on his body ignited, and the Heavenly Rainbow Seed in the sky was also burning. He was communing with the Heavenly Rainbow Flame, wanting it to acknowledge him as master.

“The current me can kill you like killing chickens. You should bless your fortune that I’m obtaining the Heavenly Rainbow Flame right now. I can spare your dog life,” laughed Mo Yan.

It wasn’t that he didn’t want to kill Long Chen but that the support of the devil world’s laws had a time limit. He had to finish obtaining the Heavenly Rainbow Flame during this time and leave. Otherwise, he would be doomed once he lost this power and everyone collapsed on him.

“Not good. That’s a barrier made of the devil world’s laws. Only Earth tier Immortal Kings and above can get through it.”

“Even the strongest amongst us are only at the Spirit tier. What do we do? Can we only watch as he steals the Heavenly Rainbow Flame?”

“Even if we had an Earth tier Immortal King, it won’t matter. The barrier doesn’t permit Immortal Kings to enter.”

People were anxious at seeing Mo Yan begin absorbing the Heavenly Rainbow Flame. That was the worst-case scenario that they had been hoping to avoid. But anxiousness or panic wouldn’t have any use now.

Just then, a giant saber-image tore into the heavens, stabbing into the starry sky.

“It’s Long Chen!”

Startled cries rang out. Long Chen’s illusory saber-image gradually grew solemn, and the surrounding stars shuddered. In that instant, a sharp will began to brew. This was an ultimate power capable of cutting through all the bindings of heaven and earth.

When this saber-image appeared, everyone suddenly felt difficult to breathe. Their souls hurt. Just the aura of this saber-image almost made their souls collapse.

“I, on the other hand, don’t wish to spare your dog life. What’s so great about the devil world? Sooner or later, my Dragonblood Legion will trample the devil world. Split the Heavens!”

Long Chen roared, shaking the world. After that, his bone saber slashed down. The giant saber-image seemed to bring down the river of stars with it.

People felt like the energy of heaven and earth was sucked up without leaving a drop by this saber.

The world changed color. As this saber contained the will to split heaven and earth, all laws collapsed in front of it.

Mo Yan’s expression changed. Even while being supported by the devil world, he felt a sensation of mortal danger coming from that saber.

However, there was no dodging it. So, he howled and absorbed as much power from the spatial gate as possible. The Ten Thousand Devil Diagram on his wings then ignited, and he stabbed his spear at Long Chen.

BOOM!

As a result, Mo Yan’s wings exploded and the chains on his back disintegrated. Furthermore, half of the spatial gate had collapsed, and half of Mo Yan’s body was gone. He was almost killed.

After this attack, Long Chen was also knocked back. But he didn’t seem injured at all. His lightning wings flapped, and he shot toward Mo Yan again.

Now, Mo Yan trembled and a sense of terror appeared in his eyes. Even such a terrifying attack hadn’t injured Long Chen? If Long Chen unleashed a similar blow, he would definitely die.

Clenching his teeth, Mo Yan suddenly smashed his rainbow hydrangeas with his hand. As they shattered, he failed to gain the Heavenly Rainbow Flame’s acknowledgment. The Heavenly Rainbow Flame in the sky then shuddered and the sea of flowers behind Long Chen lit up.

“Mo Yan has given up! The Heavenly Rainbow Flame is picking its second choice, Long Chen!” Cheers rang out from the human experts.

Mo Yan had given up on the Heavenly Rainbow Flame since he was about to be killed. As a result, there was no longer any chance of him obtaining the Heavenly Rainbow Flame. Even if everyone else died, the Heavenly Rainbow Flame wouldn’t choose him.

However, there was no way around it. He had sacrificed a secret treasure of the devil world to draw the Heavenly Rainbow Flame’s attraction. This was a major matter that the devil world had been preparing for countless years.

Even so, the result was something that he had never expected. Long Chen actually had the power to break the laws of the devil world. So, in order to protect his life, Mo Yan had no choice but to abandon the Heavenly Rainbow Flame. It was his only option.

The Heavenly Rainbow Flame now turned to its second pick, Long Chen. Just as it turned toward him, all the others attacked him. Whoever was chosen by the Heavenly Rainbow Flame would naturally become the biggest target.

“Long Chen, I, Mo Yan, will definitely kill you today!”

Mo Yan howled furiously. It was unknown what secret art he used, but his body instantly recovered. He took out a bead.

When this bead appeared, devil flames ignited. He then inserted the bead into a notch at the front of his spear.

His spear rumbled. It was like an ancient devil beast had awakened. After that, an ominous aura shook people’s hearts. He charged at Long Chen.
