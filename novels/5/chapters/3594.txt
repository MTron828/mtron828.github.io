Chapter 3583

Guo Ran couldn’t believe his ears. The dean was actually willing to abdicate his position for Long Chen? What was going on?

Long Chen shook his head. “Dean, I trust that with your methods and wisdom, you must have the ability to deal with the current crisis.”

This dean was far too steady. That unflustered appearance made him seem unfathomable. He was a true sage. Long Chen refused to believe that someone like him was really helpless in this predicament.

Xue Yifan shook his head. “To save people, you must first save the heart. To save flowers, you must first save the roots. If the heart dies, if the root withers, then no matter how many times you save it, it’s the same. It will still not be able to escape its fate of being destroyed. The best medicine for saving the heart of the people is a hero, a hero that can lead an entire era. That hero can shine a light for people to follow, saving their souls. It can purify what is rotten. To answer your question, an old man like me doesn’t just have an old body but also an old mind. The times have already changed. Even if I do my best and settle this current crisis, it won’t change anything. When the next crisis descends, old-timers like myself will already be buried, and the Alldevil Star-Field’s human race will still be destroyed.

“The human race here is already completely rotten. Hence, we need a new seed that is full of life to give hope to this world, to correct the system of values here, and to unite this plate of scattered sand. That is the only way to truly save the Alldevil Star-Field. A hero’s light can affect generations, even dozens of generations. It can last through a thousand years, through all ages. All people worship heroes and will follow in their footsteps. That will allow them to see further and not be lost within what they see before them. Only when humans have a belief in their hearts do they have bottom lines and know respect and gratitude. Only then can the human race experience a thousand tribulations without falling.”

Long Chen nodded. As expected of this wise dean, his words were truly moving, and it made Long Chen think of the five Sovereigns.

They had died for countless years, yet people still remembered them. People were still filled with respect and gratitude toward them. Thus, no matter how chaotic the Martial Heaven Continent became, the light of the five Sovereigns continued to shine in their hearts. Even in times of despair, they still had hope.

“That’s an amazing status! Boss, why don’t you try it!? In any case, it won’t come at any loss to you.” Guo Ran was moved by this. If they settled this crisis, their names would be immortalized in history. Then that would really be badass.

“If we must try it, then it should be you. How big of an influence can an outsider like me cause? You are different. You are one of the Four Heavenly Dragon Heroes, a disciple native to this place. A hero must be a native in order to be in touch with the common people. Only then can their voice be persuasive,” said Long Chen.

“Me? No, no!”

Guo Ran shook his head like a rattle. “I definitely can’t. A little person like me can’t raise such a big flag.”

This fellow had once more returned to that person who simply wanted to follow Long Chen without worrying about anything. To have him profit and show off, he naturally wouldn’t disagree. But to have him do everything himself would make him immediately beat the drum of retreat.

“Guo Ran, you’ve learned a great deal during your time in my Heavenly Dragon Divine Armor College, right? Now that the college has trouble, don’t you think it’s unreasonable for you to simply leave?” Xue Yifan looked at Guo Ran with a smile.

Guo Ran instantly sat up straight. With a bitter expression, he said, “Dean, I will never forget your favor of raising me. Even if you have me cross a mountain of blades or a sea of boiling oil, I will not frown in the slightest. But I really can’t do this. If I die, then that is because I didn’t study hard enough and my techniques are inferior. Dead is dead; I won’t complain. But to have me lead the Heavenly Dragon Divine Armor College and even the entire Alldevil Star-Field? If I die, how would I face the people behind me? I cannot carry this responsibility!”

Xue Yifan smiled with a gratified expression. “Not bad. I didn’t pick the wrong person. After throwing off that flashy outer shell, you are a hero inside. You are mainly lacking confidence. If dean Long Chen didn’t come, when the devil beast army came and pressured us, when it was a time of life and death, when you had no other choice, you would not flee. You would still raise this flag.”

For Guo Ran to say such a thing, Xue Yifan was very pleased. This proved that his vision was still sharp. But Long Chen’s arrival had ruined his plans.

“That’s enough. Let us do this. Having received the favor of others, when they ask for aid in return, Guo Ran, you have no room to leave,” said Long Chen.

“Boss, I…” Guo Ran instantly began to panic.

“Can you please grow up a bit? You are the Dragonblood Legion’s general. Can’t you even do such a small thing? Furthermore, what are you afraid of? Won’t your boss be right here the whole time?” Long Chen angrily clapped Guo Ran on the back of his head, scolding him for failing to improve.

After that, Guo Ran realized that Long Chen was right. He still had his boss to cover him from behind. If he really couldn’t do it, he could always shove it all to his boss, and his boss would carry it.

“Hahaha, good, then with boss’s support, I will definitely show off in a flashy way this time! Don’t worry boss, I won’t make you lose face!” promised Guo Ran, laughing confidently. He seemed to already be seeing himself leading an army of millions of battleships, crushing their enemies heroically.

Seeing Guo Ran laughing arrogantly, Xue Yifan smiled. But Long Chen glanced at him. “And how will you show off? There are still quite a few people waiting for you outside to put you in your place.”

Guo Ran’s smile instantly stiffened. “That’s right. Those fellows are all targeting me. How am I supposed to lead them?”

“That will depend on yourself. If a hero wants other people’s approval, there is always one shortcut.” Xue Yifan smiled and took out a golden tablet. He then gave it to Guo Ran.

“Proxy dean?!”

Guo Ran was stunned after looking at this tablet.

“What? Are you dissatisfied? The proxy dean is on the same level as the actual dean, with almost the same authority. Once the proxy dean takes their position, they are observed for ten years, and if they pass and contribute great merits, they can be the real dean after a vote from the assembly. The rules are not broken. Dean Guo Ran, do you have any further questions?” asked Xue Yifan with a smile.

“But if I have this tablet, will they really respect me?” Guo Ran didn’t quite believe it.

“Does whether or not people respect you have anything to do with this tablet?” asked Xue Yifan.

“What…?”

Long Chen couldn’t bear continuing to watch. Guo Ran was truly foolish. Even now, he didn’t understand Xue Yifan’s intentions. “This tablet gives you the right to lawfully kill people. Anyone who disobeys you, you can kill. You kill until they submit. Now, do you understand?” Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

“Dean Long Chen is really smart. Well, the rest is up to you. I won’t send you off,” said Xue Yifan.

Long Chen and Guo Ran then walked out of the palace gates. As soon as they did, they were surrounded by a mob.

“It’s time for you to show off.”

Looking at this hostile group, Long Chen crossed his arms in front of his chest and smiled.
