Chapter 2835 Guess?

Long Chen went to the end of the valley. At this moment, the dispirited disciples were hanging their heads there. Hence, he shook his head inside. They really were a pile of useless trash.

They had only come to the academy to pass the time, so the majority of their time was spent playing around. They skipped class so often to the point that the thirty-six people of the Elite Group rarely even met each other.

Originally, the Elite Group had forty-three people. However, some had left midway, saying that the academy was too hard.

The remaining disciples didn’t know about those people leaving, so Long Chen had borrowed three people from Mu Qingyun to dress up as them, and they were completely unaware.

These people had never even set foot on the battlefield, so deceiving them couldn’t be easier. The thirty-six of them had not noticed a single clue.

As soon as Long Chen arrived, those disciples stood at attention. They were all filled with terror toward Long Chen, afraid that a single wrong action would cause him to kill them.

Long Chen’s gaze swept through them. After that, his gaze eventually fell on a slightly chubby man amongst them.

“Step forward.”

That chubby man cautiously stepped up. The fat on his face jiggled, but no one laughed at him. They all knew none of them would be any better than this if they were the one facing Long Chen.

“What’s your name?” asked Long Chen.

“Guess!” exclaimed the fatty.

A sword came out of its sheath. Long Chen pointed it at his head, frowning. “Not bad, you have guts. But I don’t like guessing.”

“Instructor Long Chen, you misunderstand. He’s just stuttering. His name is Li Cai[1],” said a disciple cautiously. This disciple was close to the fatty, so he spoke up for him.

The fatty was crying out of terror. Hence, he was filled with gratitude toward this brother of his who spoke up for him. He had never been so moved in this lifetime.

Long Chen was surprised. He then pulled back his sword and shook his head. “You can’t even say your own name without a lisp. If you didn’t have a powerful background, just reporting your name might have ended up with you dying.”

“Yes, yes, I’ll change the way I report my name in the future!” shouted the fatty, nodding like a chicken bobbing for grain. As a result, the fat on his face shook like waves on the sea. However, no one dared to laugh, afraid that they might draw a calamity onto themselves.

Long Chen nodded. “These bones of yours are good. Although your work ethic is trash, causing you to waste your potential, your father and mother managed to pass down their innate talents to you. You are the strongest in this regard amongst everyone.”

“Really?” Li Cai was surprised, not expecting to get such praise from Long Chen.

“With your wide shoulders and thick neck, you’re the perfect model for a body cultivator. The explosive power of your arms is good, but you’ve never trained your legs. Without a steady foundation, your upper body can’t unleash its full power. If you have properly cultivated upon entering the academy, right now, you should be able to defeat the third ranker on the Human rankings, Zhong Changsheng,” said Long Chen.

“What? That’s impossible, right?” Li Cai was shocked. That was something he had never even dreamed of.

“There’s nothing impossible about it. Starting today, you’re the leader of the Elite Corps. Your goal isn’t to get on the divine rankings but to defeat Zhong Changsheng,” said Long Chen.

“What? Can I really do it?” exclaimed Li Cai.

“Of course you can. If you can’t, I’ll kill you,” said Long Chen indifferently.

Li Cai’s delight was extinguished. If he didn’t beat the third ranker, he would be killed?

“Stand properly. I’ll train you first as an example for everyone,” barked Long Chen.

Hearing this, Li Cai stood straight. Long Chen then reached out and patted a nearby boulder. After that, the boulder that was several times larger than a person shattered into pieces as easily as tofu, stunning the other disciples.

Someone with such dense mortal qi was unable to use immortal arts or divine abilities. In other words, he had shattered that boulder with just the power of his physical body.

A long strip of stone then came out of the shattered boulder. Long Chen tossed it onto Li Cai’s shoulders.

As soon as it landed, Li Cai’s feet sank. His legs sank beneath the tough dirt.

“I… I can’t hold it…” Li Cai almost coughed up blood, and his body trembled. The stone was about to fall.

Just at this moment, a nocked crossbow pointed at him. Long Chen coldly said, “If you put it down, I’ll kill you.”

Li Cai instantly began to sweat. He didn’t dare to put down the stone, so he bitterly endured.

After a few breaths’ time, Li Cai began to feel like he was about to die. However, just at that moment, Long Chen tossed another stone onto Li Cai’s shoulders.

Li Cai instantly began to lose his balance. He started swaying.

“Stop flailing, or I’ll kill you,” ordered Long Chen.

“I can’t! I’m going to die! I feel like I can’t breathe!” cried out Li Cai.

“That’s just the lure of your laziness. With your talent, this bit of weight is nothing. What you need to do is force out your talent. If you can’t, then you’ll be destroyed by your lazy side.” Long Chen snorted and tossed a third rock onto him.

He then added a fourth and fifth. The other disciples were dumbfounded. Those stones were so heavy that they couldn’t hold up a single one. But even now, Li Cai was still standing. He was holding seven pieces.

After that, the moment Long Chen mercilessly added the eighth piece, Li Cai’s legs suddenly quivered. They suddenly grew, tearing open his pants.

BOOM!

Li Cai howled, and all eight pieces were blown into the sky. The ground beneath his feet was blasted away by astral winds.

“What?”

Li Cai’s legs were a whole level thicker than before. Through his torn pants, it was possible to see some lines that had appeared on his skin.

Li Cai himself was stunned. He stared at his own legs, dumbfounded by the power that he sensed coursing through them.

“I suppose that counts as an initial awakening. Your bloodline has been revived. Why don’t you try jumping?” said Long Chen calmly. It was as if he had long since known this result.

Li Cai jumped as hard as he could, and he flew over thirty meters into the air, causing the other disciples to jump in shock.

“Ah!” Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

However, his power wasn’t evenly distributed during his jump, causing him to begin flipping in the air. In the end, he fell face-first into the ground, leaving only his legs wriggling in the air. That was a both startling and funny sight.

“I… I’m this amazing?!” Li Cai crawled out of the dirt and stared at his legs in delight. He felt like he had been reborn.

“It’s not you, it’s your parents that were amazing. They passed this asset to you, and you sat on it for so many years. You should have been able to awaken it as a teen, but you waited until now. Now, you can still look so ecstatic over something like that?” Long Chen shook his head disdainfully.

Suddenly, Li Cai knelt on the ground, exclaiming, “Instructor Long Chen, I beg you, teach me how to cultivate! I want to get stronger and get revenge!”

[1] His name is Li Cai, but when he says his name, he says Ni Cai, meaning ‘you guess’.
