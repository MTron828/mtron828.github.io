Chapter 2625 Mid Stage Heaven Merging

“Senior Feng Fei, why are you so serious? Did I say something wrong? I’m just asking you a question just like you asked me one. I didn’t get angry, so why would you?” Ye Lingshan cocked her head at Feng Fei.

Ye Lingshan smiled faintly. In the past, she would definitely feel inferior in front of someone like Feng Fei. After all, Feng Fei’s cultivation base, position, and status were all so high.

However, ever since she had gotten to know Long Chen, she had found an extremely beautiful quality within him. That was shamelessness.

Just like this, Long Chen could spout the most nonsensical words out with a serious expression. He wouldn’t feel the slightest shame over that.

As she got closer to Long Chen and understood his experience, she realized that shamelessness was a display of confidence. Only after going through those experiences could someone face life calmly.

Hence, she was no longer feeling inferior or cowardly. As she wasn’t comparing herself with others anymore, she wouldn’t envy them. She knew that every person was their own unique individual, and no one was inferior to anyone. At the end of the day, a heart lacking jealousy wouldn’t fawn on others, and a heart lacking darkness could advance in the face of death. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

The current Ye Lingshan had truly grown steady and calm. What had happened in the Star Field Divine World had greatly stimulated her.

Now when she looked at Feng Fei, Ye Lingshan felt like she was looking at her old immature self. The difference in realms was too immense.

“A sharp tongue. Is that what you learned from Long Chen?” snorted Feng Fei, not having any way to retort.

“I didn’t learn much from Long Chen, but at the very least I learned not to suck up to others or bend myself backward for others. Respect must be mutual. You represent the divine families, but I represent the Martial Heaven Continent. Although I’m not as strong as you, our positions are equal. So, senior Feng Fei, when you speak, it would be best to dampen that temper of yours. That way, we will be able to communicate more peacefully,” said Ye Lingshan indifferently.

Ye Lingshan was refreshed inside as Feng Fei had constantly been speaking down toward her. Ye Lingshan had been ignoring her the entire time, but every person had a point where they were pushed too far to endure any longer.

Long Chen had once told her not to bother with what was wrong with other people’s heads when they spoke like this to her. If she didn’t want to slap them, she could use words to crush them. If you simply gave in to their arrogance, they would only look down on you. Slap them once and they’d be much more obedient.

As expected, Feng Fei no longer spoke. After all, she represented the divine families, so she couldn’t be rash.

Seeing that, Ye Lingshan turned away. When facing the Martial Heaven Continent’s experts, she announced, “Enter combat state. Be ready to assist the Dragonblood Legion at any moment.”

“Yes!”

The Martial Heaven Continent’s experts replied in unison, their voices like thunder. They had all heard Ye Lingshan’s words just now and were incredibly refreshed from that.

This entire time, while they were jointly guarding this place with the divine families, the divine families’ disciples were constantly looking down on them. Therefore, this verbal retaliation from Ye Lingshan was incredibly satisfying to them.

Within Devil Spirit Mountain, the Dragonblood Legion was like tigers crushing the devil race’s army. The devil race’s millions of experts were crushed rapidly.

The Martial Heaven Continent’s experts felt their blood heating up as they watched. The Dragonblood Legion was incredibly powerful, and the devil race’s experts were unable to stop them.

Quite a few people here had participated in the battle yesterday and had personally experienced the terror of these devil experts. Even though their power was suppressed ever so slightly on the Martial Heaven Continent, they were still frighteningly powerful.

Even Ye Liangchen and Jiang Wuchen’s elite guards found it taxing to fight against them. In the end, quite a few casualties had appeared amongst the elite guards.

However, now the Dragonblood Legion had charged into Devil Spirit Mountain and slaughtered those powerful enemies. That bloody scene was so inspiring that some people had an urge to charge in as well.

The Dragonblood Legion had just over ten thousand people, but they were forcing an army of millions to retreat. The void exploded, revealing channels from which more experts of the devil race came pouring out.

These new experts were clearly elites as quite a few of them were within the thirteenth rank. At this moment, evil qi filled the air.

“Captain-class experts, pick out those old thirteenth rank monsters. Everyone else, maintain the Heaven Trapping Killing Formation!” shouted Guo Ran. He also picked out one of those thirteenth rank experts for himself.

Meng Qi, Chu Yao, Tang Wan-er, Ye Zhiqiu, Gu Yang, Yue Zifeng, and the others charged out at those old monsters.

When more experts arrived, Liu Ruyan summoned her true body, and her branches streaked through the air, tearing through her enemies. After that, their essence blood was quickly absorbed, and they turned into desiccated corpses in an instant.

As someone from the Undying race, Liu Ruyan possessed a fierce blood, meaning that she was innately bloodthirsty. Their essence blood was not just making up for her own energy, but also making her stronger.

“The Dragonblood Legion didn’t go all-out yesterday, or that Alldevil Heavenwalker wouldn’t dare to be so arrogant. What is the Dragonblood Legion planning?” Feng Fei’s expression grew cold.

When she saw the Dragonblood Legion’s terrifying power, she recalled how they had been here yesterday. If they had been fighting like this last time, Ye Liangchen and Jiang Wuchen wouldn’t have been defeated so miserably. At the very least, Jiang Wuchen wouldn’t have had his leg cut off.

“Why are you not answering?!” demanded Feng Fei when Ye Lingshan didn’t respond.

“You were asking me?”

Ye Lingshan looked at her, not understanding. “What does the Dragonblood Legion fighting have to do with me? If you have to ask someone, go ask Long Chen.”

“You…” Feng Fei ground her teeth furiously. “Since everyone is working together, we should be united, not watching as others get attacked.”

“Those words of yours are a bit hurtful. Did you not see how many warriors the Martial Heaven Continent sacrificed in the battle yesterday? If it wasn’t for the original devil race coming, the casualties would have been even greater. That group of experts stood up to the Alldevil Heavenwalker and were slaughtered because of it. If it wasn’t for Ye Liangchen and Jiang Wuchen’s carelessness, how could those warriors have ended up killed by him?

“If they weren’t killed and their Devil Suppressing Divine Seals stayed in effect, would we have suffered so many casualties? It was the result of their deaths that caused the devil race to no longer be suppressed, allowing the Alldevil Heavenwalker to cut off Jiang Wuchen’s leg. If Yue Xiaoqian hadn’t come at that time, your big brother would already be dead. All of this can only be blamed on your side’s lack of ability. Why are you trying to blame others now? Is this the greatest ability of the divine families?” Ye Lingshan’s expression grew cold as well. She was no longer as courteous as before.

Feng Fei’s face alternated colors as her teeth creaked. However, she was unable to find an opening to retort.

Suddenly, space exploded within Devil Spirit Mountain, and more and more thirteenth rank experts appeared. One giant hand even descended from the sky, causing the void to splinter.

“That’s a mid stage Heaven Merging expert!” Feng Fei’s expression suddenly changed.
