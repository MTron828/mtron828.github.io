Chapter 4072 Eternal Clan, Heavenly Divinity Race

“Fine, since you’re courting death, you can just die!”

Long Chen’s fury ignited. Just what was going on? When he did good deeds, he still ended up being faced with animosity? Had he gone crazy, or had the world gone mad instead?

Guo Ran and the others were also irritated. Were these people brutes? Even animals should know to thank people who helped them!

As the Heaven Venerate managed to escape, Uncle Tree apologized, “I’m sorry, I’m too used to the Nether Emperor’s formation, so I was slow with my attack. Because of that, he escaped.”

For many years, Uncle Tree had relied on the formations of the fiend eye to subdue his targets, so his dexterity had regressed. Otherwise, this Heaven Venerate would definitely die.

“It’s fine. It doesn’t matter that he escaped. It’s not like we could kill everyone here,” consoled Long Chen.

“Release me!” Ye Wenxuan shouted loudly, interrupting them. His lower body had already decayed, but he was still caught in Guo Ran’s grasp, powerless to resist. However, his mouth continued to threaten them. “If you don’t-”

Long Chen didn’t bother talking to him anymore. With a single point of his finger, he pierced Ye Wenxuan’s head, channeling his Spiritual Strength. He directly did a brute force soulsearch.

“Eternal clan, Heavenly Divinity race?”

Through this soulsearch, Long Chen learned that this Ye Wenxuan came from an Eternal clan that was called a part of the Heavenly Divinity race.

An Eternal clan was an existence that had an Eternal expert standing over it. This so-called Eternal realm was the one above a Heaven Venerate. In this realm, it was said that you would be immortal and undying, possessing longevity as long as the universe.

In the mortal world, the so-called gods and immortals referred to these experts. They were existences that countless cultivators never had a chance of encountering in their entire lives.

When Long Chen first heard of this Eternal realm, he first thought of that sweeping elder in the High Firmament Academy.

Little Crane had told him that the rainbow crane race possessed an exceedingly long lifespan. She had already seen several generations of deans, but that sweeping elder had sent off several generations of rainbow cranes. In Long Chen’s mind, only an Eternal expert possessed such a terrifying lifespan.

The title of an Eternal clan indicated that this family possessed an Eternal expert or had once produced an Eternal expert, possessing an Eternal inheritance.

As for this Heavenly Divinity race, they appeared in the immemorial era. When the so-called Heavenly Divinities were born, a heavenly manifestation appeared. Thus, they were called the gods of the heavens, celestial beings that obeyed only the will of the heavens.

After the immemorial era, those heavenly manifestations stopped appearing, so Heavenly Divinities became a thing of legend. Long Chen hadn’t expected Ye Wenxuan’s background to be an Eternal clan that was the descendant of Heavenly Divinities. It was no wonder that he was so arrogant.Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

Regretfully, Ye Wenxuan’s soul was protected by sacred energy, so Long Chen was barely able to grasp any information at all. Everything was inaccessible, from the rest of the information about his clan and the things that couldn’t even count as secrets in his family.

After Long Chen killed Ye Wenxuan, the other experts’ expressions changed, and they looked at Long Chen in horror. They could not believe that a group of foreigners actually dared to kill Ye Wenxuan. They had brought about a calamity.

Long Chen’s gaze then swept over them. The experts around had the same robes as Ye Wenxuan. On every robe, golden threads formed the Jiuli immortal character for their Ye family name, so it was easy to recognize. When Long Chen looked over them, those people’s hair instantly stood on end. It felt as if a wild beast had set its sights on them, leaving them with a chill in their spines.

In truth, Long Chen had the urge to do more soulsearches and see just what was so special about this Ye clan. However, if even a heavenly genius like Ye Wenxuan could only have this little bit of information, then he would probably get even less from the others.

“You, get out here. I’m going to ask you a few questions. If you don’t want to die, you’ll answer them. If you want to die, just kill yourself now so we can save time.” Long Chen pointed at an old Earth Venerate.

The Earth Venerate quivered but managed to walk forward. Putting on a cool appearance, he said, “You can ask, but I can’t say anything relating to the secrets of my Ye clan even if you kill me.”

“I’m going to ask, and you’re going to answer. Anything more or less and you’ll die,” said Long Chen coldly. He then asked, “What is this place?”

The elder cleared his throat and hastily replied, “The Jiangning Prefecture.”

“Is this the territory of your Ye clan?” asked Long Chen.

“No. We were asked to deal with the sea demon tide.”

“Asked? Did that cost money?” sneered Long Chen.

“Ye… yes.” The elder was a bit embarrassed.

Long Chen looked at the elder contemptuously. He didn’t even need to ask more to know what was going on.

“Tell me, in the Jiangning Prefecture, is it possible to ask other powers for help?” asked Long Chen.

“Ah… well…”

The instant the elder hesitated, Guo Ran slapped him in the face, causing him to stagger. “My boss asked you a question! You dare to hesitate? Next time, it won’t be a slap in the face but my blade through your neck!”

That person was shocked and enraged. He, a grand Earth Venerate, was slapped in the face, and it was by a little Immortal King brat. It was a huge humiliation for him.

But looking at Uncle Tree beside Long Chen, he could only endure. That was an existence that had even scared off a Heaven Venerate.

“It is of course possible to ask others. However, the Jiangning Prefecture has a good relationship with my Ye clan, so naturally they asked us for aid first,” said the elder, swallowing his anger.

“Your Ye clan really came up with a good scheme. You used the sea demon tide as a trial by fire. With it, not only can you temper the combat power of your disciples, but you can even make money. Most importantly, you get others indebted to you while profiting.” Looking at the group of people that stared at him with conflicting expressions, Long Chen knew what was going on.

On the battlefield, the Ye clan had joined forces with the disciples of certain powers to clean up the sea demons. The original experts here didn’t get that chance.

After all, the bodies of sea demons were filled with treasures. A sea demon tide was indeed a calamity, but it was also an opportunity. With righteous indignation, the Ye clan actually barged in to reap all the benefits from the natives and even forced them to pay a cleaning fee when doing so, making the Jiangning Prefecture owe them a debt.

Based on the crap from Ye Wenxuan and the Heaven Venerate, Long Chen knew most of what was going on. By looking at the infuriated expressions of the experts in the distance, their expressions that were mixed with resentment and fear, everything was clear.

“Hmph, what Eternal clan, what Heavenly Divinity race. Their manners are crap. You’ve already lost the face of your ancestors,” sneered Long Chen.

He had seen shameless people but not to such an extent. Such a major force was actually fighting over some scraps with this group of low level cultivators? It was completely ridiculous.

The elder was red from being exposed, but he didn’t dare to make a sound, afraid that Long Chen would directly kill him otherwise.

“I know that your Ye clan will come for me. So, help me tell them that I don’t care about them being an Eternal clan or being part of the Heavenly Divinity race. Don’t provoke me. If Boss Long San gets angry, the consequences will be very severe for you all.”

After saying that, Long Chen waved his hand. They all got on the flying boat, and under the gazes of countless people, they flew off.
