Chapter 4220: Refining the Soul Through Space

“Brothers, don’t worry, we are here! You are not fighting alone!”

Heroic cries rang out one after another, as more and more humans flew to Long Chen’s side. They were like a spear stabbing into the torrent of dark creatures.

There were quite a few Triple Supremes amongst them. As the top figures of their factions, they slaughtered these dark creatures easily.

An open space was quickly cleared up, and those experts managed to reach Long Chen and the others through this space.

“What are you doing?”

However, to their surprise, just as they managed to open a path, numerous people from Long Chen’s side actually charged out of it.

At first, they even thought that these people had come to aid them, but before they could even feel moved by that, they realized that something was off. These people didn’t even greet them and just flew right by them. The brave experts had come to aid them, but these people were actually using them to flee from this place.

This unexpected turn of events left these brave experts enraged. “Are you even humans?! Don’t you have the slightest sense of loyalty in your bones?!”

However, mere curses were unable to stop these cowards from leaving. They still fled, lowering their heads so that they didn’t show their faces. Some of them even directly put on masks.

“So you know how to cover up your face! You already have no face at all, so what’s the point?!” cursed someone. He would be glad to kill these people himself.

Long Chen had protected these cowards, but at this critical time, they actually abandoned Long Chen and his companions. The experts who had come to assist them were completely enraged by this. It was like they viewed them all as idiots.

“Ignore them. In any case, we’re only doing what we want to do,” said a Supreme heavenly genius.

Some had come to save them and some were fleeing. Who was a hero and who was a coward was clear here.

“Brother Long, we’re here to help.”

The first wave of experts quickly reached their camp. After that, they began to find places for themselves within their defensive line.

“Words cannot express my thanks. Your arrival is my greatest motivation,” said Long Chen emotionally

From a distance, Long Chen’s emotional reaction made people think that he felt relieved at being saved. Hence, they sneered at him.

Only Meng Qi, Yu Qingxuan, Tang Wan-er, and the others familiar with Long Chen knew that the reason Long Chen was so moved was because these people were true hot-blooded righteous men, the pillars of the human race. They let Long Chen see hope for the human race.

Meng Qi and the others were all smiling emotionally. They knew that Long Chen had precisely been waiting all this time just for them. They had come to save Long Chen, all without realizing that they had managed to save themselves.

As millions of experts had come to aid them, the situation was temporarily stabilized. These experts were truly not bad. There were over a hundred Triple Supremes, and the others were also quite powerful.

“Brother Long Chen, you are a good person. Don’t listen to those trolls. You’re a real man, and we really admire you,” said one of them.

“Hahaha, for you to risk your life to aid us at this perilous time is enough to show me that you’re a hot-blooded man. Once the Sage King Convention is over, I will definitely drink with you all until we all collapse!” Long Chen laughed heroically.

“Hahaha, good!”

These people laughed as well, their arrival amid all this mounting pressure indicating their readiness to confront death. Every single one of them was an honest and straightforward man.

“You can drink in the netherworld instead!” At this time, someone sneered at them from a distance, intentionally spreading their voice just to infuriate Long Chen and the others.

This person was very cunning, hiding his presence within the crowd. Furthermore, amidst the sea of dark creatures, locating him among billions of experts was as challenging as finding a needle in the ocean.

“Die!”

Long Chen suddenly shouted, his voice like thunder piercing through the crowd. Following that, one person in the crowd screamed in terror.

He was holding his ears tightly, but blood continued to flow, seeping through his fingers. It was like he was being tortured.

Suddenly, his head exploded, and his screams came to an end.

His body then fell limply to the ground, his life extinguished in an instant.

“Idiot. Did you really think that I couldn’t do anything to you? Other than stabbing people in the back, people like you have no other skill. The human race is only forced to the brink because of idiots like you. I only let you live for so long to see just how much hope the human race really has. Now, the seeds of hope have appeared, so you are no longer useful,” declared Long Chen. He then turned to Meng Qi.

Meng Qi nodded and slowly raised her hands. Her slender fingers slowly made a few seals.

Suddenly, a translucent ripple spread out of her, causing countless screams to ring out amongst the crowd.

Hundreds of people clutched their heads and fell to the ground, screaming like pigs being slaughtered. Their whole bodies quivered, their faces full of terror. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

“Refining the soul through space? How is that possible?!”

Startled cries rang out, especially from other soul cultivators. Soul cultivators possessed the ability to pinpoint a person's location within a crowd by the resonance of their voice and soul. However, in this vast assembly, with voices layered upon voices, and the mouth-clackers intentionally blending their spiritual fluctuations, it became an immensely challenging task.

Even if someone managed to locate them, launching a spiritual attack from such a distance was an entirely different matter. Unless one had previously affixed a spiritual lock on an individual while they were speaking, accomplishing this feat was virtually impossible.

However, a spiritual lock would definitely be noticed, after all, everyone here was an expert. There was no way Long Chen and the others could place a spiritual lock on someone without them noticing, unless their Spiritual Strength was ten thousand times greater than that of the other party.

BOOM!

Suddenly, some of those screaming guys chose to self-detonate. What made it even more alarming was the swiftness of their actions. As a result, several people were caught in the explosions and coughed up blood.

“What a sinister woman! Stop!”

That person had just spoken when his head flew into the air. No one knew what had cut off his head.

Everyone was shocked. To be able to kill someone at such an immense distance, without anyone being aware of it, was absolutely terrifying. They didn’t even know who did it.

Just then, rumbling sounds rang out, and a lot of dark creatures with golden marks came out of the passageway. Some of those marks were actually dark gold. When Long Chen saw those creatures, he couldn’t help but narrow his eyes.

“That’s the aura of dark lords!” Guo Ran and the others cried out in shock.

“Xia Chen, you know what to do,” said Long Chen.

“Hehe, understood.”

Xia Chen laughed and waved his hand, releasing hundreds of flying talismans that formed a large sphere, which then rapidly compressed.

Space began to compress until it was a palm-sized ball. After that, the ball suddenly vanished, reappearing in the devil race’s territory.

BOOM!

As the ball exploded, that strange odor once more erupted, causing the devil race’s experts to panic.
