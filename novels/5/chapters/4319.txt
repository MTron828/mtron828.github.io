Chapter 4308 Eternal Essence Blood

The black tortoise received a backlash from smashing into the golden-winged devil as well and was now upside down, its legs pointing toward the sky. Long Chen then took advantage of this chance and struck the black tortoise’s eye with a seven-color spear, having made ample preparation for this move.

The enormous spear pierced through the black tortoise’s eyes, and its power detonated within its enormous head.

BOOM!

When the black tortoise’s head exploded, mud-like flesh and blood flew out of its eye sockets, nose, and mouth.

Long Chen was as pale as a sheet of paper after this attack. He did manage to kill the black tortoise with it, but he had no more power to do anything else.

While the black tortoise was dead, the golden-winged devil was still struggling to recover and run. Long Chen shouted, “Stop it!”

BOOM!

Guo Ran followed Long Chen’s example and attacked the winged devil’s eye. However, the winged devil simply turned its head, and Guo Ran’s saber struck its eye socket.

Guo Ran’s saber directly shattered and the backlash almost made him cough up blood.

“Yin Yang Heaven Locking Formation!”

At this moment, Xia Chen tossed out thousands of talismans at once, which condensed into chains that locked themselves to heaven and earth, binding the golden-winged devil to the ground.

However, the winged devil roared and struggled, causing those chains to snap one by one. Xia Chen was shocked. Despite being severely wounded and on the brink of death, the winged devil possessed the strength to shatter his runic chains. Its power surpassed his expectations.

“Guo Ran, quick!” shouted Xia Chen.

Guo Ran had initially been disheartened by the loss of his saber. However, upon hearing Xia Chen's call, he swiftly retrieved his golden crossbow.

“Exploding arrow!” Guo Ran shouted as he shot a golden arrow at the winged devil, and it accurately entered the winged devil’s mouth.

BANG!

The golden-winged devil quivered, and smoke came out of its seven orifices. Within a matter of seconds, it slumped limply to the ground, motionless.

With the golden-winged devil dead as well, the three of them could finally wipe off their cold sweat. Eternal experts were truly terrifying, even on their deathbeds.

Guo Ran touched the winged devil’s wings, and they let out a metallic sound. Its wings were actually comparable to Eternal divine weapons.

“Don’t slack off! Gather the Eternal blood! Too late and it’ll lose its divine nature!” shouted Xia Chen when he saw Guo Ran studying the winged devil’s body.

Meanwhile, Xia Chen had already run over to the five-color black tortoise’s side and taken out tools to gather the essence blood.

Whether it was devil blood or demonic beast blood, it was an excellent material for runic inscription. As for essence blood on the level of an Eternal expert? That was a priceless treasure! They were the necessary ingredients to create Eternal talismans and Eternal divine weapons.

Xia Chen had never dreamed that he would be able to gather fresh Eternal essence blood, and not just any, but of the highest purity.

In truth, Xia Chen had once bought some half-step Eternal experts’ essence blood, but it had been sealed for countless years, leading to the loss of most of its essence. Even then, Xia Chen had treated it as if it was a priceless gem.

During the Sage King Convention, Xia Chen had managed to gather the essence blood of quite a few half-step Eternals, a feat that brought him immense joy.

However, the fresh essence blood from genuine Eternals was in an entirely different league. As Xia Chen sensed the divine nature of this essence blood, he realized it was over ten thousand times more potent than that of the half-step Eternals. He almost went mad with disbelief, questioning if he might be dreaming.

The two of them swiftly gathered the essence blood while Long Chen summoned his divine ring. With the eruption of his two bloodlines, he rapidly recovered.

Long Chen was delighted to find that the abundant primal chaos qi in this place significantly accelerated his recovery rate. In less than the time it took for an incense stick to burn, he had already bounced back to eighty percent of his full strength.

Long Chen knew that the environment was just one aspect that supported his rapid recovery. The other significant factor was the powerful recovery ability of his seven-color Supreme Blood and violet blood.

Xia Chen and Guo Ran had finished gathering the essence blood. Now, they were working together to take off the tortoise shell, but their weapons were unable to cut the tortoise’s flesh.

Guo Ran wanted the tortoise shell as it was a natural Eternal divine item. With it as a shield, he would be invincible.

“Let’s not waste more time. We should take a look at what’s underground,” said Long Chen as he stopped them.

Unless they had Dong Mingyu’s dagger, cutting apart this black tortoise’s flesh would take a long time, and they didn’t have that much time.

Long Chen proceeded to place both of the corpses into the primal chaos space. However, he didn’t immediately toss them into the black soil. After all, they were true Eternal corpses, and their bones held immense value as treasures. In particular, their bone runes possessed significant research value, so it would be far too wasteful to just decompose them.

The three of them arrived at the hollow concave that the black tortoise had laid down on. Xia Chen then squatted down and examined the ground. “Yes, there is a formation operating underground. I’ll connect to it.”

After taking out a dozen formation discs, in just a short moment, Xia Chen had constructed a small-scale transportation formation.

Buzz.

Space twisted, and the three of them found themselves in a gloomy space.

The underground world resembled an imperial palace, but a significant portion of it had already crumbled. Around them were countless broken formation runes. After looking around for a bit, Long Chen found that they were in a corner of the palace.

“This place was indeed occupied by the human race back then.” Looking at the surroundings, Guo Ran was startled.

"This formation seems to be an energy replenishment formation, and the external pressure likely activated it," murmured Xia Chen as he inspected their surroundings. "The black tortoise seems to have regarded this as a place to rest and heal. But what's keeping the formation operational after all these years?"

Xia Chen then took out another formation disc and started walking carefully as if he were looking for something. Long Chen and Guo Ran didn’t understand, so they simply followed behind him.

The palace was shrouded in a layer of dust several inches thick, giving it an ancient and desolate appearance. The atmosphere felt eerie and unsettling.

“It should be here. Guo Ran, help me out,” Xia Chen finally said, pointing at a wall after an extended period of searching.

Guo Ran retrieved a brush and meticulously swept away the accumulated dust from the wall. His skilled movements indicated that this wasn't his first time undertaking such a task. His brushing was exceedingly gentle, causing the dust to fall away layer by layer. As a result, runes began to emerge on the wall, and a gate materialized before them.

After studying the runes on it, Xia Chen took out two formation discs and placed them on the gate. Following that, he started to form a hand seal.

The two formation discs immediately illuminated, causing the gate to swing open slowly. Once it parted, the three of them saw a scene that stunned them.
