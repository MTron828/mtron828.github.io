Chapter 4291: Long Clan’s Patriarch, Long Tianyao

“Long Chen, what do you think you’re doing?!”

The Grand Elder came flying out in a panic. He was the one to shout at Long Chen to stop.

Unfortunately, his shout was for nothing as Long Chen had already slain that elder. The problem was that this elder’s status was extremely high. His seniority was on the same level as that of the patriarch.

“What am I doing? Can you not see it clearly? Why ask if you already know the answer?” asked Long Chen coldly.

Hearing his answer, the Long clan’s experts were shocked and enraged. They couldn’t believe that Long Chen dared to kill someone on the same level as their patriarch right in front of them.

“As a disciple of the Long clan, you have the Long clan’s blood flowing through your veins! How can you kill people from your own clan? Even if he was in the wrong, he was still your ancestor. How could you kill him?! This is completely disgraceful!” shouted the Grand Elder furiously.

Even the Grand Elder couldn’t contain his anger any longer. However, his wrath was not solely directed at Long Chen; it also extended to the half-step Eternal who had just died.

.

Upon returning to the Long clan, the Grand Elder had used his authority to start advocating for the clan to abandon Long Aotian and invite Long Chen over. That was the only way to improve their relationship with Long Chen.

After all, Long Aotian was a mistake from the start, and the Long clan couldn’t stay on the side of a mistake the entire time. Now that they had an opportunity to correct this mistake, they had to grasp it.

However, what he hadn’t expected was that everyone in the Long clan, from top to bottom, was highly against this stance. They viewed Long Chen’s conduct as brash and cruel.

In their opinion, even if Long Chen had defeated Long Aotian, taking back his own Spirit Blood, Spirit Root, and Spirit Bone should have been a discussion with the Long clan. After all, in order to nourish the three, the Long clan had spent the majority of their accumulated resources on Long Aotian. They had basically impoverished themselves for Long Aotian.

Now that everything was taken away by Long Chen, the Long clan was enraged. Many of them were proposing to slay Long Chen no matter the price to reclaim his Spirit Blood, Spirit Root, and Spirit Bone.

Furthermore, they had to act quickly. Otherwise, if too much time passed, the Spirit Blood, Spirit Root, and Spirit Bone might start losing some of their divinity.

There were even suggestions to use Long Zhantian’s life to blackmail Long Chen into coming so they could capture him.

No matter how the Grand Elder tried to advise them, more and more voices rose up against Long Chen. They all thought that Long Chen was too wild and couldn’t be controlled, making him unfit to inherit the Long clan. Even with Long Aotian's current disability, they preferred saving him over accepting Long Chen.

The Grand Elder felt like he was going crazy, but even the patriarch didn’t view Long Chen favorably. Unable to find any other means to change their minds, the Grand Elder had been arguing with the higher-ups all this time.

This was one of the reasons why the Long clan’s atmosphere was so tense. The Grand Elder possessed immense authority, but he could not force people to change their minds. Neither side could persuade the other, leading to an ongoing deadlock.

The Grand Elder had personally witnessed just how terrifying Long Chen was. Furthermore, the Spirit Blood, Spirit Root, and Spirit Bone that Long Chen had taken were originally his, so this couldn’t be called stealing.

However, talking reason with them was pointless, so the Grand Elder felt extremely helpless over this matter. From the start, he had hoped for Long Chen to return to the Long clan.

When Long Chen arrived, the Grand Elder was in the parliament hall, where the higher-ups were arguing about Long Chen’s matter. None of them were aware that Long Chen had taken the initiative and came himself. And by the time the Grand Elder rushed over, Long Chen already decided to kill one of their most senior experts. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

When Long Chen killed that elder, the Grand Elder’s heart sank, especially when he saw the palace master behind Long Chen. He directly knew that today was not going in the direction he wanted.

“Long Chen, not only did you destroy my Long clan’s genius, but you even slaughtered our elder! Who gave you the guts to act this way?!”

Just then, a cold shout rang out, and a white-haired elder walked out with a dark, imposing expression.

“Patriarch!”

All the Long clan’s disciples immediately cupped their fists to this elder. He was the head of the Long clan, their patriarch, Long Tianyao.

“No one needed to give me any guts. I was simply capable of it. Destroying your Long clan’s genius was to take back what is mine, and killing your Long clan’s elder was because he was courting death. You can’t blame anyone else for this,” responded Long Chen coldly.

Even in front of the Long clan’s patriarch, Long Chen’s face was still icily arrogant. The Long clan had tried to cold-shoulder him at the gate. At that moment, Long Chen knew that there was no way of resolving today’s matters peacefully.

As a result, it didn’t matter what status the other side had. Long Chen didn’t care. Since everyone had decided to be hostile, he didn’t need to hold back anymore.

An elder beside the patriarch coldly chided him, “Long Chen, you are also a member of the Long clan. Everything you have is thanks to the Long clan, including your Spirit Blood, Spirit Root, and Spirit Bone. Without the Long clan, would you even exist? Now, you even dare to kill your ancestors. That is the greatest sin of betrayal, yet you showed no signs of guilt or regret. That’s enough to tell that you are a coldhearted killer. The Long clan gave you everything, so when the Long clan needs your aid, you should help. We poured countless resources into Long Aotian’s body, and your Spirit Blood, Spirit Root, and Spirit Bone could only display their greatest effect in Long Aotian’s body. As a member of the Long clan, you should take responsibility and return your Spirit Blood, Spirit Root, and Spirit Bone to Long Aotian.”

Upon hearing that, the palace master’s expression sank. These words had clearly antagonized him. It seemed that he had never seen anyone so shameless before.

“Hahaha!” On the other hand, Long Chen laughed furiously. “You want to play this game with me? You really are blind. You say that I’m a member of the Long clan? What has the Long clan ever given me? My body is from my father and mother, so it would be a disgrace for me to not take back what they gave me. You call that a betrayal? This body of mine was a gift from my parents, so this gift must be cherished. If someone wants to kill me and I don’t resist, after I die, my parents will be heartbroken. Wouldn’t that be an even greater betrayal?

“No one is qualified to strip others of their lives as they wish. Not even parents are qualified to do that to their children, let alone some old fogey that wanted to die. Most laughable of all, you call me coldhearted and demand me to hand over my Spirit Blood, Spirit Root, and Spirit Bone just like that? Are there maggots in your head? After living for so long, you were actually able to say something so stupid with a straight face. Could it be that all your years of cultivation were spent on refining this thick skin of yours? How else could you possibly manage to say something so shameless? Is this the result of sacrificing all other skills just to thicken the face?”

“You…!” That leader quivered with rage. In truth, his argument was full of holes and contradictions as he was not an eloquent person. He usually relied on his high seniority to discipline the junior generation.

When it came to the junior generation of the Long clan, they wouldn’t dare to argue with him. But as for Long Chen, he instantly poked holes in all his arguments.

“Brat, by acting so arrogant, are you not afraid that we will kill your father?!” shouted that elder furiously.

“If my father is missing a single hair on his head, I will turn the Long clan into a slaughterhouse.”

After being threatened, Long Chen’s eyes instantly turned black, and his killing intent exploded. It was like he had become a wild killing god, one that was on the verge of going out of control.
