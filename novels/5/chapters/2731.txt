Chapter 2720 Deadlock

“They want to use numbers against us? How ruthless.”

Mo Nian tried barging through the Corrupt God Cemetery three times, only to be forced back thrice as well. He didn’t even have a chance to enter Resentful Death City.

“They’ve sacrificed a portion of their troops to allow the others to cultivate peacefully. The Undying race really is ruthless.” Gu Yang nodded.

“Not only are they ruthless, but they also have the capital to do so. With just our numbers, killing a few million experts through sneak attacks while also being on guard against that old monster will take forever.” Mo Nian felt trapped.

Long Chen had said that the sneak attacks had to be focused on absolute safety as a priority. He didn’t want to see any losses amongst them. But if they didn’t take any risks, every sneak attack would only kill a few thousand to ten thousand of the Undying race’s experts. Ten million experts of the Undying race were enough to stall them.

“We have to disturb them somehow. Resentful Death City is focused entirely on allowing Ye Ming to advance as quickly as possible. His cultivation speed is astonishing. Once he becomes Sovereign, the Martial Heaven Continent will be in trouble. Although it might not reach the point where he can dominate the continent, he would be able to deal grievous damage with sneak attacks,” said Mo Nian gloomily.

Once Ye Ming became Sovereign, on his own, he would be able to constantly launch sneak attacks, grinding away all the experts of the Martial Heaven Continent. From then on, they would never have a moment of peace.

If that happened, they would be unable to continue disturbing the other worlds, allowing the invaders to focus entirely on cultivation. Then the Blood Fiend Devil Lord, the Nine-Headed Lion, the Alldevil Heavenwalker, and the others would become Sovereigns as well.

“Senior, this relates to the life and death of the Martial Heaven Continent. You have to help me out this time. I must charge into Resentful Death City and interrupt them.” With no other options, Mo Nian could only beg the Central Plains Cauldron for aid. It had the power to do so, but it was still in the midst of recovering, and using its power so recklessly would extend the time it needed to recover.

The Central Plains Cauldron said, “No need to rush. Your helpers have come.”

A group of people appeared just as it spoke. Their leader was a giant with a giant ax on his back. Every step of his caused the world to shake.

“Wilde!”

Mo Nian was delighted to see Wilde, Guo Ran, Xia Chen, and the rest of their group. He asked, “Why are you here?”

Guo Ran laughed, “Everything is under boss’s control. He knew they would play this kind of game, sacrificing some cannon fodder to protect the rest of their troops. According to boss, we should gather our power, attack them, and then run.”

Zi Yan and Yue Zifeng arrived with their group just at that moment. Ye Zhiqiu’s group was right on their tail.

Nangong Zuiyue, Beitang Rushuang, Ximen Tianxiong, Ye Lingshan, and the others had also arrived. Since all four supreme divine items were present, Mo Nian instantly became arrogant again.

“Brothers, kill them!”

“Kill!”

The Dragonblood Legion was gathered and they charged into the Corrupt God Cemetery.

An old monster immediately attacked them. However, with a slash of Ye Zhiqiu’s sword, ice and snow blew through the world, and that old monster’s hand instantly froze solid.

That old fellow hastily retreated. The current Northern Source Sword had recognized Ye Zhiqiu as its master. Unlike Mo Nian, Ye Zhiqiu was a perfect match for the Northern Source Sword, as both had ice attributes. Ye Zhiqiu could use her own ice energy to invoke the power of the Northern Source Sword, so it didn’t deplete the Northern Source Sword’s core energy.

Even this old fellow of the Undying race suffered immensely under its blow. Mixed with shock and anger, he was about to counterattack when a giant ax smashed down from the sky.

BOOM!

The elder coughed up a mouthful of blood and was sent flying into the distance. He was almost cut in two.

With him gone, a giant opening appeared in their defenses. Mo Nian and the others were like a sharp arrow piercing through their midst, charging into Resentful Death City.

Without wasting a breath, Mo Nian unleashed a heaven-shaking arrow, throwing the laws of the world into chaos, interrupting their cultivation once more.

“We’re done! Leave!”

After accomplishing this task, they didn’t wait for a response and immediately retreated.

Their group then did the same to Devil Spirit Mountain. After shaking the laws there, they rushed to the Ancient Battlefield and then the Yin Yang World.

Their goal wasn’t to kill. It was only to interrupt the invaders and make sure that they couldn’t peacefully cultivate. In any case, they had four supreme divine items on hand. Even if they encountered terrifying enemies, they could still retreat unscathed.

Those four worlds were all infuriated. They tried to kill Mo Nian and the others multiple times, but the four supreme divine items were simply too powerful. With their power, they always managed to escape. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

Furthermore, as they worked together, their cooperation improved and their strikes became even more precise. The four worlds were tormented endlessly, infuriating them.

They naturally did the same thing and launched attacks on the Martial Heaven Continent in order to shake the laws of the world.

However, the Martial Heaven Continent was the core of a star-field. Even if it was already badly damaged, it still wasn’t something their worlds could compare to.

Their attacks were only able to shake a small part of the continent, not even a tenth of the entire Martial Heaven Continent. It was essentially meaningless.

Moreover, they had to pay a price for this conduct. When they entered the Martial Heaven Continent, the formations that Xia Chen had set up made it easy for them to enter but hard to leave. Illusion formations, soul bewitching formations, heart-devil formations, and others made it so that they were unable to find their way back. Other than some fish that slipped through the net, the rest were slaughtered.

The four worlds had sacrificed quite a few people but had not achieved their goal. They gradually became truly dumbfounded. Only now did they realize just how foolish it had been to disturb the Martial Heaven Continent. They had essentially shot themselves in the foot.

Helplessly, they could only try to cultivate in this disruptive state. But like this, any dreams of rapidly advancing were extinguished.

The only thing that comforted them was that the ones harassing them were the apex experts of the Martial Heaven Continent. If they were constantly attacking, then they also didn’t have time to cultivate. Both sides were sacrificing.

They settled with this kind of result. However, what they didn’t know was that with the medicinal pills that Long Chen, Meng Qi, and the others were refining, the Martial Heaven Continent’s experts didn’t need to enter a meditative state to cultivate effectively.

They fought as they absorbed medicinal energy. Although it did impact their cultivation speed, it made sure that their foundations were incomparably solid.

As Mo Nian led the Dragonblood Legion against the invading worlds and drew them into a stalemate, Long Chen spent two full months refining medicinal pills.

On this day, the final furnace of pills was finished. After that, Long Chen told Meng Qi and the others to continue with their refinement. Leaving his clone and Ling-er behind, he then set off on his own.
