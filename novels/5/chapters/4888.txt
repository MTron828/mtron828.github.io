Chapter 4877 Heaven Screen Mountain Opens

“Explanation?”

Xing Wujiang looked at the vice hall master with disdain. “Your Flame Divine Hall has been secretly supporting the four noble families to target my Xing family. You’ve secretly killed quite a few of my people. If someone deserves an explanation, it’s me.”

Even in front of the Flame Divine Hall, Xing Wujiang didn’t back down at all.

In truth, whether it was the Flame Divine Hall or the Brahma Pill Valley, they had both been secretly supporting the four noble families behind Xing Wujiang’s back, encouraging them to fight the Xing family.

Although Xing Wujiang was well aware of it, due to the Flame Divine Hall’s power, he had had no choice but to accept it.

However, it was different now as Xing Wujiang no longer had any misgivings. Even against the vice hall master, he refused to take a single step back.

“If you want to accuse someone, you should show some evidence first,” replied the vice hall master with a cold tone.

Feeling impatient, Mo Nian said, “You should just give it up and stop playing these childish games. No need to make excuses for your actions. No one believes them anyway.”

In truth, Mo Nian or Long Chen disliked this kind of worthless banter. Even after doing countless wicked things, they still had to act like the victim—how disgusting.

Had the world ever truly known justice? These civilized bastards would simply put a veil over their faces when they did bad things. In truth, everyone was very clear on their doings.

Long Chen and Mo Nian had encountered such motherfuckers countless times—those who committed wicked deeds yet cloaked themselves in self-righteousness.

Sometimes, the two of them would rather deal with devils and fiends than them. These people were far more sinister and treacherous than devils.

Long Chen indifferently said, “Do you understand? If you didn’t, I’ll make it clear. He’s saying to let out whatever fart you’re holding back.”

Mo Nian also added, “Quickly!”

Long Chen and Mo Nian’s banter combo was practically flawless, not giving the vice hall master any chance to interject. At this moment, everyone from the Flame Divine Hall was raging with killing intent.

These two had so brazenly insulted their vice hall master while ignoring them; it was simply unprecedented. Who would dare to be so rude to the Flame Divine Hall?

Countless experts stared at Long Chen and Mo Nian in disbelief. Only a small fraction of the gathered individuals here were from Devil Fall City, so most did not recognize the two of them. Witnessing the audacity with which they openly mocked the esteemed vice hall master of the Flame Divine Hall, these experts were utterly stunned.

That girl called Qianwu was quivering, barely suppressing her rage. At this moment, the vice hall master still didn’t let her attack; he looked at Mo Nian calmly.

“And you are?”

Mo Nian smiled slightly and took a step forward. After taking a deep breath, he looked up at the sky. Seeing that, Long Chen instantly rolled his eyes. This again. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

As expected, Mo Nian waved his hand through the sky, loudly proclaiming, “The limitless palace in front of the limitless mountain, the limitless tree before the limitless gate, the dreams of heavenly geniuses vanish without a trace as soon as they encounter Mo Nian! That’s right, I am the hero of justice, the one who seeks the truth, the one who shuttles through endless space and time! I swim through the river of history and pursue the essence of life. I am the great scholar who is restoring the world’s truth—Mo Nian!”

Mo Nian’s long introduction flowed off of his tongue smoothly, causing even Long Chen to wince, goosebumps rising on his skin. He couldn’t help but shiver as Mo Nian spouted the most shameless thing he had ever heard.

Although Guo Ran was similar, when it came to flashiness, as expected, no one could match Mo Nian’s level. It was like they were constantly competing to be flashier than each other.

Without exception, every expert stared at Mo Nian with mouth agape. Those present were either remarkably talented young heavenly geniuses or influential figures like sect masters. Yet, they had never heard such brazenly arrogant words uttered aloud, especially in the presence of the vice hall master. Saying such a thing required more than just simple bravery!

The reactions varied among the experts—some were astonished, some scornful, while others, like those from the Flame Divine Hall, gazed at Mo Nian with contempt and anger. However, the vice hall master's expression remained surprisingly calm.

It went without saying that the vice hall master possessed great restraint. He shook his head and replied, “The limitless palace? Never heard of it. Mo Nian? Never heard of that name either. Compared to the youngest dean in the history of the High Firmament Academy, your light is like that of a firefly.”

“Hahaha!” Long Chen and Mo Nian both laughed.

Mo Nian barely suppressed his laughter as he said, “It seems wisdom doesn’t grow with age. How dare you use such a childish play against us? Someone with your intelligence is capable of becoming a vice hall master? It seems that I should go to the Divine Flame Hall when I have time. I’ll be your hall master in no time.”

While such a tactic might seem naive against the likes of them, for some heavenly geniuses—especially the prideful ones—it could be truly fatal. All it took was one sinister seed planted in the heart for it to take root deeply.

However, this kind of seed couldn’t survive against Long Chen and Mo Nian. Even though both of them liked to con each other occasionally, it didn’t affect their brotherhood. Thus, when they heard the vice hall master’s words, they laughed so hard that tears almost came out.

The vice hall master’s composure was remarkable. Despite everything, his expression remained unchanged. Calmly, he replied, “It’s just the truth. I’ve never heard of your name.”

“You haven’t heard my name, but maybe you should ask your friends if they recognize me?” Mo Nian said, looking around.

Instantly, countless people started avoiding eye contact, and their expressions had grown extremely odd.

After a moment of silence, someone cursed Mo Nian, “What dogshit are you?! Who would recognize you?! Fuck off!”

Although he said that, based on his furious gaze, it was obvious that he did recognize Mo Nian. He just refused to admit it.

In truth, quite a few people here knew Mo Nian. After all, he had visited the final resting place of their ancestors. Yet, if they admitted it, it would be like telling everyone about the awkward incident in their families. Thus, they weren’t willing to admit to it.

Suddenly, the space behind Xing Wujiang twisted, forming a spatial gate that slowly opened, revealing an ancient city. That city was Devil Fall City.

“Brothers, prepare yourselves. The Square Heaven Seal is about to open Heaven Screen Mountain,” transmitted Xing Wujiang. He then placed a hand on both of their backs.

BOOM!

Suddenly, a streak of light shot out of Devil Fall City, passed through the spatial gate, and smashed into the barrier around Heaven Screen Mountain, forcibly ripping the barrier apart.

“Now!” Xing Wujiang shouted and pushed Long Chen and Mo Nian straight into the hole in the barrier.
