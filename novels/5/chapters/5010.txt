Long Chen’s palm slammed onto a thirty-foot rock. This rock was called a training rock, a common tool for those with some level of status in their private training rooms.

The runes on this rock could absorb the force of any impact, and a special testing formation was embedded within it to measure the power of the impact

This training room was prepared for a one vein Heaven Saint, meaning the rock had to be able to endure the full power of a vein Heaven Saint.

The rock itself wasn’t inherently special; it was the formation inside that allowed it to rapidly absorb any power unleashed on it and accurately judge its force. When Long Chen’s palm struck the training rock, it didn’t budge in the slightest. In fact, it didn’t even cause any dust to fall.

“Huh? Was it a failure?”

Long Chen was baffled. His violet blood energy had been sucked dry by this attack. What was going on? He then eyed his palm. A violet cross slowly faded on his palm until it was gone.

“Where’s the number? Do the Long clan’s training rocks not give a number? They seem different from the academy’s training rocks. Shouldn’t there be some display? Or do you need to activate it first? Tch, how can one of the four divine clans have such garbage training rocks?” grumbled Long Chen.

This full-power attack had exhausted almost all of Long Chen’s violet blood energy, but the training rock didn’t even budge. Long Chen checked all over the stone and muttered, “What broken thing is this?!”

Not finding any control mechanism after checking everything, Long Chen angrily slammed his palm on the training rock.

As a result, a large hole directly appeared in the training rock. Feeling like his hand had just slammed onto snow, Long Chen realized that the inside of the training rock had turned to dust.

Suddenly, the entire rock crumbled, disintegrating into countless particles that cascaded to the ground. The formation platform was obliterated, reduced to smithereens.

Long Chen eyed the fine particulates and then his hand. He was so stunned that he couldn’t even speak.

“That… that’s too exaggerated!” Long Chen jumped in fright.

Long Chen’s heart pounded crazily. He felt like he was dreaming. Did this not mean that this attack had the power to annihilate a one vein Heaven Saint?

“Even a one vein Heaven Saint wouldn’t necessarily be able to block this attack. You truly do have that power. However, to actually kill them with this move will be very difficult,” remarked the Earth Cauldron.

Although this attack was powerful, it wouldn’t kill one vein Heaven Saint unless they didn’t even use their weapon. After all, most of this attack’s power would be blocked by the weapon.

In reply, Long Chen chuckled happily. “Hehe, that’s fine. If we’re just using our bare hands, I can kill them with one palm. By the time they want to use their weapon, they’ll already be on the path of reincarnation.”

“That is true. Considering your realm, a one vein Heaven Saint likely won’t use their weapon on you,” said the Earth Cauldron.

“Senior, how are you doing?” asked Long Chen.

“They’re working hard, hehe!” chuckled the Earth Cauldron, its chuckle no longer carrying the sacredness it once had after being influenced by Long Chen’s wretchedness.

“Haha, that’s good. It seems that we’re both profiting in this trip to the Long clan.” Long Chen laughed. They really had profited this time.

The Earth Cauldron said, “Don’t waste your time. You should continue with the seven-color Supreme Blood’s God Slaying Cross and then the dragon blood’s God Slaying Cross. The violet blood’s God Slaying Cross was the gentlest, its power like water. It harms the inside but not the outside. Hence, the training rock appeared unscathed on the surface but had collapsed within.

“However, the seven-color Supreme Blood is far more explosive. Controlling seven kinds of energy is hard and could harm you. Be careful. Yet, once you master it, its might will be even greater than the violet blood’s. The destructive force of seven energies combined is unimaginable, but it comes with a significant backlash. It will definitely be a burden on your body. You’ll have to get used to it slowly.

“Next, you will use the dragon blood for the God Slaying Cross. The dragon race is extremely prideful and disdains cultivating the divine abilities of other races, so it will be harder to control. Using dragon blood for the God Slaying Cross will only surpass the one with the seven-color Supreme Blood by a bit. The improvement is slight, but it’s still necessary to master.”

“Why bother?” asked Long Chen. If the increase wasn’t significant, why invest so much effort? After all, Long Chen already possessed the dragon race’s divine abilities.

Moreover, the odds of Long Chen having to use both essence blood to unleash this technique consecutively were very low. If he couldn’t beat his enemy in two attacks, his dragon blood’s God Slaying Cross wouldn’t make a difference.

“That’s the preparation for you to cultivate the true God Slaying Cross,” replied the Earth Cauldron.

Long Chen nodded. It seemed this was all for the next step, so Long Chen didn’t tarry. He immediately called someone to switch out the training rock and then went back into seclusion.

Just as the Earth Cauldron had mentioned, the moment Long Chen tried using the seven-color Supreme Blood to cover the starry sea, a problem occurred.

The seven-colored Supreme Blood represented seven different kinds of energy and laws. When they covered the stars, these seven energies went out of balance. As a result, Long Chen needed to exhaust a huge amount of Spiritual Strength to control them and maintain the balance.

It was quite hard. Long Chen spent a whole day testing various methods without making much progress. Attempting to cover the stars with his seven-color Supreme Blood like he did with his violet blood resulted in only half of them being covered, at most.

Unable to think of any other way, Long Chen cast out the energy of his seven-color Supreme Blood haphazardly throughout the starry sea. He then attempted to organize the chaotic energies, trying to connect them.

Days passed—one, two, three... On the fourth day, after numerous setbacks, Long Chen finally succeeded in maintaining a delicate balance and covering his entire starry sea.

Next, he summoned the seven-color starry sea. As he condensed the Cross Blood Rune, blood suddenly sprayed from his mouth. This distraction instantly disrupted the starry sea’s equilibrium and wounded him.

Long Chen had to begin the process anew. On the seventh day, Long Chen finally condensed the cross.

BOOM!

Long Chen’s palm thundered into the training rock, shaking the entire immortal cave. Countless formations were pierced through, and the walls cracked under the force of Long Chen’s attack.

“Hahaha!”

Long Chen raised his head and laughed. “This is really badass!”Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates
