Chapter 4232: Grand Yan Human Emperor

Long Chen and the Dragonblood warriors were talking when an ear-piercing voice rang out, enraging all the Dragonblood warriors.

They then looked over to see a group of yellow-robed human experts nearby.

They were particularly garish. This shade of yellow was normally for emperors, believed to be intricately tied to their karmic fortune. Without the corresponding karmic luck, most cultivators would not wear this shade of yellow.

In the Vermilion Bird Empire, Long Chen had learned about the origins of these yellow robes. The imperial children all wore yellow not just as a symbol of status but as a continuation of karmic luck.

Even if the Vermilion Bird Empire were to be destroyed, as long as the imperial bloodline remained, they would continue to wear yellow robes to prove that the spark of their inheritance was not extinguished yet.

However, if they were so afraid of exposing their status that they didn’t dare to wear these yellow robes, then the final spark of their imperial line’s karmic luck would be gone, along with any hope of revival.

It was only after Long Chen discovered this in the Vermilion Bird Empire that he suddenly realized Xia Guhong consistently wore yellow robes. In essence, Xia Guhong hadn't abandoned all hope for the Grand Xia's revival.

The experts outside the martial stage were startled to see these people. They almost couldn’t believe their eyes.

“Descendants of the Human Emperors!”

This time, even the seniors of the High Firmament Academy were moved. They hadn’t expected to see them here.

“The Five Emperors once reigned supreme, suppressing all factions. I didn’t expect the Human Emperors’ descendants to appear here. Furthermore, look at the karmic luck divine ring behind their heads. It is shining brightly. Their line has started its resurgence,” said the vice palace master. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

“The legacies of the five great Human Emperors are mostly gone without a trace, with the sole known exception being a descendant of the Grand Xia Human Emperor, who resides exclusively within the Wine God Palace. I actually thought that the inheritance of the Five Emperors was already lost, with only the Grand Xia’s lineage teetering on the verge of extinction. Hence, it is truly astonishing to witness the emergence of other descendants from the Human Emperors now. I wonder which line they’re from,” mused Bai Shishi’s mother.

The Grand Xia Human Emperor was Xia Guhong’s ancestor. Legend had it that during the ascendance of the human race, they gave rise to the five Human Emperors—an era marked as the pinnacle of human glory. They brought peace to the four corners of the world, conquered all lands, and earned the acknowledgment of the myriad races, establishing the human race as the supreme ruler.

However, one ancient battle caused the human race to decline. It was so long ago that there was no tracing its roots, leaving people without a clear understanding of what had happened.

In any case, the reappearance of the Human Emperors' lineage, in such a formidable fashion, should have brought joy to the human race. However, for some inexplicable reasons, their descendants were actually picking a fight with Long Chen, causing the High Firmament Academy’s side to worry.

Within the martial stage, the Dragonblood warriors glared at the numerous descendants, their numbers reaching into the hundreds of thousands. Leading this group was a pale young man exuding an icy aura of arrogance. Despite his youth, his eyes possessed the air of someone who had witnessed the transformations of the world.

Even though this person’s aura was somewhat reserved, he unmistakably possessed an imperial pressure around him, a noble air. Standing within the crowd, he appeared like a crane among a flock of chickens.

It was like he was an emperor, and even though they were standing at the same height, somehow people had to look up to him.

At this moment, he was looking at Long Chen coldly. Those sharp words were also spoken from his mouth.

“What a slappable face. Did you think that a yellow tortoise shell would protect your head from being cut off? Since all of us are part of the human race, I will kindly give you one warning. Don’t provoke me. I don’t care what illness you have,” said Long Chen icily.

Long Chen didn’t know who these people were, but even if he did know, it wouldn’t matter. For this guy to provoke him out of nowhere, he was clearly up to no good.

Long Chen could sense that this young man’s aura was powerful, but he didn’t care. Not provoking anyone didn’t mean that he was afraid of trouble.

“How brazen! To dare look down on the Human Emperors’ descendants, do you believe me when I say that nine generations of your family will be executed?!” said one of the Human Emperors’ descendants. Most of them were provoked by Long Chen’s response. However, Long Chen couldn’t be bothered to pay attention to the one who threatened him. Even if that person wasn’t a complete idiot, he wasn’t much better than the arrogant young man.

“I don’t care if you’ve been buried for too long, causing your heads to get affected, but I’ll repeat it once more. Do not provoke me, or I guarantee that you’ll regret it,” said Long Chen to their leader.

After Long Chen said this, many experts came to a realization. No wonder some of these people had very odd auras. This descendant of the Human Emperors was most likely a sealed expert.

However, it wasn’t just him. Quite a few experts by his side also had to be sealed experts. As for when they were sealed, no one could guess. Most likely, they were awakened for this Sage King Convention.

Their auras were after all different from that of the current era’s experts, so they were most likely heavenly geniuses from ancient times. This revelation shocked some people, but what really astounded them was Long Chen’s sharp vision that instantly discerned this fact.

At this moment, the High Firmament Academy’s seniors all sighed inside. Hearing his words that were filled with gunpowder, they knew that Long Chen had triggered another powerful enemy, and a very terrifying one at that.

“Hahaha!”

That descendant of the Human Emperors laughed, his voice full of arrogance.

“You might not have heard of me, but I’ve heard of you. I know that you’re very arrogant, however, I particularly like arrogant people. I, Yan Wuji, am going to unite the human race, ending this era of trash fighting for supremacy. In order to do that, I get rid of any stubborn trash that can’t be controlled. You will be the first.”

“The Yan family? So he’s a descendant of the Grand Yan’s Human Emperor, Yan Nantian!”

When this person reported his name, many people cried out. So he was the descendant of the illustrious Human Emperor of the Grand Yan Empire. They finally knew his origins.

“Of the five Emperors, the Grand Yan Human Emperor’s power was ranked second, and he had a feud with the Grand Xia Human Emperor. However, since the Grand Xia Human Emperor had the Grand Xia Dragon Sparrow, the Grand Yan Human Emperor was always suppressed. Some people even said that the Grand Yan Human Emperor was the strongest, and if he had a primal chaos divine item, he would have been the leader of the five Human Emperors,” commented one elder.

“That doesn’t sound right. If the two Human Emperors had a feud and the Grand Xia Human Emperor had a primal chaos divine item, why didn’t he just kill the Grand Yan Human Emperor and end the feud?” Someone else raised a suspicion.

“Because someone did not permit him to do so.”

“What person could make a Human Emperor obediently listen to their orders?”

However, there was no reply. It was unknown if he didn’t know or if he didn’t dare to say it.

Yan Wuji shocked everyone when he reported his status, triggering a wave of discussion from the people around. However, Long Chen simply laughed.

“You want to unite the human race? Are you trying to make me laugh to death? Your ruler qi is simply incomparable to that of Big Brother Xia Guhong.”

“You know Xia Guhong?”

Suddenly, killing intent exploded out of Yan Wuji, causing the people by his side to immediately clench their weapons.
