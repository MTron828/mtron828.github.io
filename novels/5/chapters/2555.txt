Chapter 2544 Creating a Side Door? Tenth Heavenstage of Netherpassage

“What are you doing?! Don’t be impulsive!” Evilmoon cried out in shock, feeling like Long Chen had gone mad.

The life and death energy within Long Chen’s divine ring was vainly trying to create a five-point star. However, that energy suddenly exploded, and Long Chen coughed up a mouthful of blood.

“You’re crazy. You want to forcibly change the circulation of your cultivation technique?!”

This was no ordinary cultivation technique. The Nine Star Hegemon Body Art was something that even made Evilmoon feel afraid. It definitely had a frightening origin.

Now that Long Chen had cultivated it in the wrong order, he wanted to forcibly change the foundation of the technique. But was that really possible?

Every cultivation technique that was inherited had been passed down by countless generations who had already improved them as much as possible. It could be said that after going through thousands and thousands of revisions, they had even received the approval of the Heavenly Daos. Hence, every cultivation technique that remained in the world could be said to be as perfect as possible.

Even a regular Battle Skill or magical art was essentially set in stone and could not be changed, let alone a technique like the Nine Star Hegemon Body Art.

Despite Evilmoon’s roars, Long Chen didn’t stop. Furthermore, Evilmoon knew Long Chen’s character. He wouldn’t change his decision no matter who tried to convince him. In the end, Evilmoon fell silent, sighing.

The five-point star kept appearing within Long Chen’s divine ring and then exploding. As a result, Long Chen repeatedly hacked up blood. Looking worried, Guo Ran ran over, only for Long Chen to gesture for him to stay away.

He had no other path to walk. He had no Dantian, so he couldn’t cultivate other cultivation techniques. The Nine Star Hegemon Body Art was his only option.

“You’re going to break and bend to my will!” Long Chen roared furiously. The sixth star quivered, forcibly changing the shape of the five-point star.

Suddenly, cracks covered Long Chen’s entire body. It was as if he was about to explode.

“Long Chen, stop. A cultivation technique on this level cannot be changed by anyone, not even a god.” Evilmoon finally couldn’t help interjecting again. If this continued, Long Chen would die.

“I refuse to believe it. Since it chose me, it shouldn’t try to tease me. Since it is mine, it has to serve me. I will not be controlled by it. I am me, and no one can control me. I’m going to gamble. From today onward, it will submit to me. This Nine Star Hegemon Body Art is mine!” Long Chen clenched his teeth. He vaguely realized something.

However, this realization could not be confirmed, and since he had no other choice, he could only gamble. If he won, he could continue on his path. If he lost, everything would come to an end.

All of Long Chen’s spiritual yuan, physical energy, and Spiritual Strength poured into his astral spaces and then flowed toward his six stars. This was opposite to the normal flow of the energy of the six stars entering his astral spaces and then the rest of his body.

Rumbling rang out and berserk power clashed against the five-point star in his divine ring.

As a result, the five-point star was repeatedly destroyed and reformed. With every explosion, Long Chen’s body was heavily injured, but these injuries were not being healed by the primal chaos space’s life energy.

Perhaps it was due to coming from the same source. It could be considered harming himself, so it was different from his other injuries. If this continued, perhaps he really would die.

However, Long Chen didn’t budge. Even as he didn’t heal, he continued to stubbornly suppress the five-point star.

The five-point star had been broken dozens of times now, every time reforming according to its original circulation.

On the other hand, Long Chen was covered in blood and was on the verge of collapse. Looking at him, Guo Ran was appalled but had no idea what he could do.

Anyone else would give up after failing so many times, but Long Chen didn’t. He had to succeed no matter what.

As a result, the ground turned red with his blood. Every failure caused fresh blood to splatter out even more.

Evilmoon wanted to stop Long Chen, but it understood him. To give up or change his mind implied that he was giving up fighting against his fate…that he was giving up hope.

His cultivation path had been severed, resulting in his combat power never advancing again. To the prideful Long Chen, he would rather die than accept such a conclusion.

If Long Chen didn’t continue cultivating, then even ignoring that he would never fulfill any of his dreams, he and the Dragonblood Legion would be facing a miserable death as soon as they left the Star Field Divine World.

Hence, Long Chen had no choice but to gamble. However, after being in contact with him for so long, Evilmoon had no confidence in Long Chen’s luck.

“Yun Shang, as the first generation Sovereign, you wouldn’t have misjudged him, right…” Evilmoon sighed silently, praying for Long Chen.

Long Chen’s body cracked like porcelain, signifying that he had reached the limit. He had failed ninety-nine times.Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

“Ninety-nine failures are fine. Just one more time… I’m going to do it…” Long Chen clenched his teeth, or he tried, but he lacked the energy to do so.

His body was now no longer under his own control. A light touch from someone else could shatter him.

All his energy had been exhausted. All he had left was only enough for one final attempt at shattering the five-point star.

The first ninety-nine tries were all repeats of the same failure. Now, his power and body had reached their limits. This was truly his last attempt.

If he gave up, he would still have his life. If he continued trying, there was practically no chance of success. In all the previous ninety-nine attempts, the five-point star had not shown any sign of submitting.

At this time, a normal person would hesitate. But Long Chen didn’t.

BOOM!

The five-point star in his divine ring exploded again, and Long Chen’s body was given the final blow to its destruction. As he collapsed, the five-point star slowly reformed just like before.

Long Chen could vaguely feel his body collapsing as his consciousness descended into darkness.

“Failure? I’m sorry everyone…”

Long Chen’s consciousness sank deeper and deeper. He felt like he had descended into a bottomless hell.

“You are you, but you are not you. So why do you have to be like this? Why do you refuse to give up?”

A faint sigh rang out from within the darkness. The voice contained a gentle note, as well as sorrow.

“Cough…”

A coughing fit pulled Long Chen out of the darkness and into the real world. Immediately, he felt a sharp pain throughout his entire body.

“I’m… still alive?” This intense pain felt like a good thing.

“Boss… you’re awake.” Guo Ran cried out emotionally.

“Help me sit up. I can’t breathe like this.” Long Chen weakly lay there.

Guo Ran carefully propped Long Chen, taking out something for him to lean on.

“Boss, did you end up bedeviled?” asked Guo Ran.

From the side, Guo Ran had essentially watched Long Chen as he tried to kill himself. Guo Ran had no idea what Long Chen was doing. It was only when Long Chen collapsed that he ran over. At that time, he found that Long Chen’s aura was gone, and the flame of his soul was extremely weak.

He panicked. Moreover, he was no healer. If he made the wrong move here, it might only quicken Long Chen’s death. His head turned empty, but just at that moment, Long Chen woke up.

“Fuck, it was still a failure. Once I recover, I’ll have to try again.” Long Chen took a deep breath, which caused his wounds to flare up.

Long Chen instinctively used the primal chaos space’s energy to heal, but then he remembered that these wounds weren’t being healed by the primal chaos space. However, at this moment, his wounds began to rapidly heal on their own, and in just a few breaths’ time, his wounds were gone. Other than his spiritual yuan and Spiritual Strength still being empty, his body was normal.

“What…?” Long Chen was pleasantly surprised. After that, he consumed a few recovery pills.

After recovering a bit, he summoned the divine ring to replenish his energy faster. However, when he called it out, he noticed something off. His aura was different from before.

“I’ve reached the tenth Heavenstage?”

Long Chen realized that his aura had grown, and his spiritual yuan was more condensed. His Spiritual Strength was also a bit stronger. That was a sign that he had advanced.

After that, Long Chen circulated his little bit of life and death energy, but when he circulated it, the six stars in his divine ring slowly appeared.

He was in a normal state and not the Six Star Battle Armor state. At this moment, the five-point star once more appeared in the divine ring.

However, this five-point star no longer possessed its stubborn will. Following Long Chen’s will, it instantly changed shape, and the six stars absorbed the little bit of life and death energy he had remaining.

“Congratulations on succeeding.” Evilmoon sighed. This was inconceivable, incomprehensible. According to reason, it was impossible for Long Chen to succeed.

“Hahaha, success!” Long Chen suddenly raised his head and laughed. He felt like crying from emotion.

Only someone who had experienced despair and finally regained hope would know just how moving that feeling was. In that instant, Long Chen became filled with confidence toward the future again.

“Long Chen, there are some things that I shouldn’t say at this time, but I can’t help it,” said Evilmoon after hesitating.

“Speak. I know you don’t want to give me a blow while I’m down, right?” Long Chen still smiled.

“Correct. You have managed to change the method of cultivating your technique. But that also signifies that you have completely deviated from the original path of the Nine Star Hegemon Body Art.”
