Chapter 1960: 1960

Xie Wentian attacked, his palm seeming to fill the sky . There was nowhere to run as it crashed down toward Leng Yueyan and Long Chen .

“Only noticing now is too late . In the end, you’re a disciple of the Corrupt God . Can you really resist the energy of the Corrupt God?” Leng Yueyan swung her sword . There was a glimmer to her sword that had not been present before .

Xie Wentian’s palm-image was sliced apart, and Leng Yueyan’s Sword Qi continued, leaving a bottomless ditch in the ground that continued beyond the horizon . Anyone that had been there was killed, whether at the Life Star realm or the Netherpassage realm .

Leng Yueyan sliced the space behind her and pulled Long Chen inside it along with her . Looking back at Xie Wentian, she said, “Thank you for your help . As thanks, I won’t kill you . ”

Just like that, Leng Yueyan and Long Chen vanished within the tear in space .

“Sect master... . . ”

The Netherpassage experts were pale and dumbfounded . Just what kind of existence was Leng Yueyan?

Xie Wentian’s expression was ugly . Killing intent raged within him as his fury reached a peak .

Leng Yueyan was just a Life Star disciple, and he should be able to slay her easily . However, somehow she had absorbed a portion of the Corrupt God’s energy .

That energy was what allowed them to call out to the Corrupt God . The Corrupt God sensed their calls through it and sent down traces of its divine energy as a bridge so that they could hear its voice . However, before they had finished the ceremony, it had been broken by Long Chen, and a portion of that energy had actually been absorbed by Leng Yueyan .

That pillar was where the Corrupt path’s faith energy was gathered . Even a divine item would be unable to cause any damage to it . But Leng Yueyan had sliced through it easily .

Xie Wentian wouldn’t fear her normally, but he couldn’t block the energy that belonged to the Corrupt God . Because he was a follower of the Corrupt God, how could he fight against his god?

So, Xie Wentian was filled with rage . All his world-shaking power was unable to be released . He could only watch as Leng Yueyan brought Long Chen away .

Looking at the part of the pillar that remained, he knew that this was a disgrace . An unprecedented humiliation .

Suddenly, a rune lit up in the sky . That rune rapidly spun and divine energy descended .

“It’s the Corrupt God’s directive!”

Xie Wentian let out a startled cry and hastily knelt on the ground . The other experts also knelt .

This kind of thing had only occurred twice in all of the Corrupt path’s known history . This was the third time, and everyone was shaking with excitement . This was a communication with a god .

A rune fell onto Xie Wentian’s hand and his whole body shook . Following that, the divine energy faded .

Shockingly, the pillar that Leng Yueyan had broken had actually been restored .

“The sacred Corrupt God’s power is limitless!”

All the Corrupt experts let out cries of emotion . Some of them were even crying . They were fanatics who had just seen their god .

Only Xie Wentian was still stunned . There had only been a simple message in that directive: do not provoke that girl .

Just what kind of existence was Leng Yueyan? She had broken their sacred pillar and killed so many of their experts, but the Corrupt God’s directive was to actually not provoke her .

Xie Wentian looked up at the sky for a long time without saying anything .

“The Corrupt God wishes for all talented disciples on the level of Empyreans to gather at the great totem for the divine blessing . ”

All the Corrupt path’s experts were delighted . They hastily returned to their own sects, alerting their disciples to come over .

A portion of these experts also sent word to the other strongholds . This was a divine blessing, something that might not occur in tens of thousands of years .

Xie Wentian had many questions, but he also relaxed slightly . At least, the Corrupt God didn’t punish them .

After walking over to Xie Luo, Xie Wentian pointed a finger at his son’s head . He respectfully said, “Thank you for your care, Corrupt God . ”

Xie Luo, who was on his last breaths, became wrapped in divine light...

...

When Leng Yueyan dragged Long Chen into a tear in space, Long Chen finally lost consciousness .

During this time, he seemed to be able to hear Leng Yueyan’s soft voice and vaguely feel a pair of hands cleaning his body .

After an unknown amount of time, Long Chen slowly opened his eyes . His body had fully recovered . Even the primal chaos space’s World Trees had revitalized .

It had to be known that during the battle, the World Trees had long since withered .

“Evilmoon, how long was I sleeping?” asked Long Chen .

Back then, Long Chen hadn’t had the slightest bit of energy . Hence, Evilmoon and the Heaven Flipping Seal could only retreat to his spiritual space .

“It’s already been three months,” said Evilmoon .

“That long?” Long Chen was startled .

“What do you think? Without such a long time, do you think you could have recovered? Your body was about to crumble back then,” said Evilmoon irritably .

“What’s wrong with you?”

“I’m fine . I’ve recovered, and I’ve also benefited . When the altar’s formation was destroyed, I managed to absorb a bit of divine energy . Hehe, I’ll also have a trump card in the future,” chortled Evilmoon .

“Where is Leng Yueyan?” Thinking of Leng Yueyan, Long Chen felt a chill inside . He had no idea of that girl’s terrifying origins .

“No idea . She brought you here and looked after you for two days before leaving . She has never returned, so she might have really left . ”

She had left?

Long Chen felt a bit of disappointment . He had risked his life to save her, and she had left just like that?

“Are you awake?”

Suddenly, a tender figure appeared in front of Long Chen . There was a warmth in Leng Yueyan’s eyes now, as well as a rare smile . Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“Yup . I’m also fully recovered . ” Long Chen smiled . So Leng Yueyan hadn’t left .

Leng Yueyan was like a steep mountain that made people look up to it with reverence and despair . This mountain only looked down on others coldly . However, there were emotions between Long Chen and Leng Yueyan . Deep within Long Chen’s heart, he felt a strong sense of accomplishment . This was the illness of men . The stronger the woman, the more accomplished the man felt upon conquering her .

Although Long Chen wouldn’t say that he had conquered Leng Yueyan, at least everyone in this world saw that she had feelings for him .

The two of them simply looked at each other . Leng Yueyan smiled and bent down . Their faces were less than an inch away . Everything about Leng Yueyan was perfect, a perfection that shouldn’t exist in this world .

Long Chen’s heartbeat quickened . Leng Yueyan was like a poisonous rose that had a fatal charm to men .

Just as Long Chen was expecting a tender kiss, Leng Yueyan paused . She smiled . “Since you’ve recovered, then let’s properly settle our debts!”

Long Chen felt a sharp pain from his thigh . At some point, Leng Yueyan had stabbed her bone sword into his leg . His defenses were useless .

“Are you mental?!” raged Long Chen . This crazy woman’s head was definitely not normal . She actually repaid kindness with enmity .

Long Chen pushed his hands forward, wanting to push on Leng Yueyan’s chest, but she slipped away like a phantom .

“Hehe, why so angry?” laughed Leng Yueyan . She was delighted, like a little devil .

“Is your head sick? If you have some illness, tell me . I have plenty of medicine . If you eat enough, I guarantee it can cure you!” raged Long Chen . This girl went hostile faster than the flipping of a page .

“I’m not sick . You’re the one with a brain illness . It was clearly a deathtrap, but you still went . Don’t you agree that you must have a brain illness?” Leng Yueyan chortled .

“Fine, I admit I have an illness . ” Long Chen couldn’t help sighing . “This was actually something that you set up, but I actually risked my life charging in...”

Long Chen felt himself to be very laughable .
