Chapter 3203 Going to the Ying Prefecture

Long Chen found Luo Bing and Luo Ning. The two of them had advanced to the Four Peak realm in Crane Cry Valley. Furthermore, they had each found a rank six blood rune and smoothly refined it.

Luo Bing had even managed to grab a rank seven rune. Unfortunately, she hadn’t had the power to subdue it. In the end, she wisely chose to let it go.

Reality showed that her decision was correct. After she absorbed the rank six rune, she had used up most of her energy. She almost failed in the middle of her tribulation, and it was very dangerous.

Fortunately, both of them had obtained a rank six rune, as well as three rank four runes. That made the two of them incredibly excited.

Now, the two of them had stabilized their realms solidly at the first Heavenstage of the Four Peak realm.

Long Chen had expected the two of them to be delighted, but when he said that he wanted to visit their family, they dodged his gaze. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

Luo Bing said, “Long Chen, your eye isn’t healed yet. Why not go later?”

“Why? Is it not convenient?” Long Chen was startled.

“It’s not inconvenient…” Luo Bing stalled.

“Aiya, I’ll say it. The Luo family is surrounded by enemies and doesn’t want you to get involved for fear that the Luo family will owe you a greater debt,” said Luo Ning directly.

“Surrounded by enemies?” asked Long Chen.

“Well…” Luo Bing still hesitated.

Luo Ning irritably said, “What is there to hide about? If the family head asks about it, I will bear the responsibility. The Ying Prefecture borders the devil sea. To the left, it borders the Sheng Prefecture. It’s unknown if it’s the Chu family’s doing, but a huge number of devils have started pouring out of the devil sea and attacking the Ying Prefecture’s cities. As for the Chu family, they are also secretly gathering their forces, seemingly in preparation for a sneak attack. Hence, the Luo family has entered its war state. The family head might consider it inappropriate to tell you these things, so we weren’t supposed to tell you.”

Long Chen curled his lips. The Luo family was really rigid. They didn’t want him to get involved because they didn’t want to owe him anything further?

Long Chen had advanced to the Four Peak realm and was freely capable of using the power of his divine flames. His dragon blood had also fully merged with him during the heavenly tribulation. Hence, he didn’t fear anyone below the Immortal King realm.

“Ning-er, if the family head learns that you told this to Long Chen, you’ll be punished,” scolded Luo Bing.

“What’s there to be afraid of? If I have to be punished, then I’ll be punished. For the Luo family, if I didn’t even have this bit of courage, I wouldn’t be fit to be a descendant of the Luo family,” said Luo Ning indifferently.

“Gather your things. I’m going to report this, and then we’ll immediately leave,” said Long Chen. He wanted to go to the Luo family. He felt that the timing was good as he wanted to investigate his mother.

Although the academy didn’t restrict his movements, he had to tell them where he was going first. This was simply manners, the foundation of being an adult.

Long Chen first found the deputy dean, and as expected, the deputy dean didn’t say anything about it, just telling him to be careful.

After that, he wanted to go see Bai Shishi’s mother, but he found that she wasn’t in the academy and neither was Bai Zhantang or Bai Xiaole’s mother.

Since that was the case, he could only go back. At this moment, Luo Bing, Luo Ning, and the others were ready.

The Unfettered Alliance’s disciples, the Luo Gate’s disciples, they all gathered excitedly.

“What are you doing? You’re disciples of the academy. This is a private matter and not something arranged by the academy. How can I bring you out as well?” Long Chen looked at these excited fellows speechlessly.

Those disciples were instantly disappointed. Mu Qingyun’s mouth moved a few times, but she didn’t say anything.

Looking at her, Long Chen said, “I know what you’re thinking, but remember, you are a sword cultivator. To cultivate the sword is mostly to cultivate the mind. Getting infected by so much murderous aura will affect your realm. The sword is the lord of all weapons, the only one that can be worn as an ornament. Do you understand?”

Mu Qingyun nodded. “I understand. I’ll listen to brother San.”

Long Chen smiled. For her to say such a thing meant that she didn’t really understand. But if she didn’t understand, then she didn’t understand. There was no way for him to explain it more clearly. She could only rely on herself to comprehend it.

“Boss, I have to go!” declared Bai Xiaole, afraid that Long Chen would toss him away.

Xu Zixiong also said, “Me too, I want to bear witness to the Dao Dawn Domain-”

“It’s the Heavenly Swell Domain,” corrected Qin Feng.

“Yes, the Heavenly Swell Domain. I want to see what the sea demons of the Heavenly Swell Domain look like. When I crossed the devil sea, I didn’t see a single one. So infuriating,” said Xu Zixiong.

“Don’t show off. If you had encountered a sea demon then, you would no longer exist in this world,” said Qin Feng. This fellow actually knew how to show off his accomplishments.

Hearing this, Xu Zixiong blushed. After that, Long Chen looked at everyone. “If the Luo family’s disciples wish to return home to work for the Luo family, then there’s naturally nothing wrong with it. As for the rest of you, there is no such thing. If you want to get stronger, you don’t need to always stay with me. The High Firmament Academy has countless experts registering, so there will be plenty of heavenly geniuses for you to compete against. The rankings of the inner academy will change every day. All of you should learn from that competition. Go do your own things.”

In the end, Long Chen only brought Qin Feng, Bai Xiaole, and Xu Zixiong along with Luo Bing and the rest of the experts of the Luo family. They numbered slightly over thirty people.

“Why haven’t I seen young master Changchuan and Bai Shishi lately?” asked Long Chen on the flying boat.

“Young master Changchuan directly left without saying anything after his tribulation. He was in a great rush. As for Bai Shishi, after your tribulation, she went to the Field of Bitter Reincarnation. It seemed that she was provoked,” said Bai Xiaole.

“Is she crazy?”

Long Chen was shocked. Bai Shishi had also gone to do the bitter reincarnation trial? Although she was powerful, that was a trial that targeted a person’s mental strength and will. She wasn’t too skilled in this regard, so she was going to face endless torment.

“I feel the same. Who knows? She’s always been cold, so no one knows what she’s thinking.” Bai Xiaole shrugged.

Long Chen shook his head. He recalled Bai Shishi’s stubbornness. Perhaps his tribulation was what had provoked her.

However, it had to be known that he had faced off against heavenly tribulation from the day he entered the cultivation world. If she wanted to increase her mental strength and will, there were many ways to go about it. There was no reason to go to such extremes. One accident and her mind might be damaged.

However, she was simply that stubborn. No one could change the decisions that she made. But if she succeeded, her mental realm would definitely transform, and her metal energy would become unmatched. She would be like an unsheathed sword.

Long Chen and the others sat on the flying boat, going through several transportation formations for two days before arriving at the Ying Prefecture. As soon as they arrived here, the smell of blood assaulted them.
