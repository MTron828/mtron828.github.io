Chapter 1153 Defeated and Fleeing

Translator: BornToBe

“I’m looking forward to it.” Long Chen rested Blooddrinker on his shoulder. His hair constantly billowed as he sensed energy surging out of him. He didn’t know if the Nine Star Hegemon Body Art was connected to the Green Dragon Battle Armor, but up until now, he found that using the Green Dragon Battle Armor was able to unleash the full power of the Nine Star Hegemon Body Art.

It was only with the support of the Green Dragon Battle Armor that he was able to bear using one hundred percent of his 108,000 immortal platforms’ power. Tightly holding Blooddrinker, he felt like his body was about to burst with energy.

As for the horned man, he raised his trident. The illusory figure behind him transformed into a rune that merged with his trident.

“Fool, now you should realize that you’re definitely going to die today!” The horned man glared at Long Chen. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

Long Chen narrowed his eyes. He icily said, “Using the power of your ancestral blood and the essence of your ancestor’s soul to activate a King item’s power?”

“Correct. Although it can’t fully activate the King item, it’s enough to kill you!” The horn on his head began to shine with a dazzling light, and it gathered onto the trident.

Heaven and earth rumbled as his trident rapidly grew. It pierced through the clouds, reaching a monstrous height that made others feel like ants, as if they might be annihilated at any time.

But Long Chen just calmly stared without making any movements. Blooddrinker was beginning to shiver, like a lion whose territory was being intruded on.

He pointed Blooddrinker to the sky, and a blood-red saber-image soared into the sky.

“Cliff Breaking Heaven Propping Slash!” The horned man’s pupils shrank. He hadn’t thought that Long Chen would also be able to activate his King item. He hastily attacked, not giving Long Chen any time to store up energy.

“Split the Heavens-... 3!”

Just as Long Chen was preparing to use the fourth form of Split the Heavens, a bad feeling rose in his heart, and he forcibly switched to the third form.

The huge saber-image crashed against the trident. The world suddenly descended into endless darkness. That was a result of mass spatial twisting, and when everyone’s vision recovered, they saw that the sea had been cut apart. They thought they even saw the ocean floor which was also cracked.

Both Long Chen and the horned man flew back. Long Chen vomited a mouthful of blood, his meridians shaking.

In that critical moment, he had switched from the fourth form to the third form of Split the Heavens. He had forcibly gone from connecting thirty-six acupuncture points to twenty-seven. But because the thirty-six acupuncture points had been connected, he could see that just trying to use the fourth form had caused his acupuncture points to be covered in cracks.

“Fortunately I switched in time, or my meridians would have been completely destroyed! How is the fourth form of Split the Heavens so monstrous?!”

Long Chen felt a wave of fear. He had already nourished the runes for the fourth form of Split the Heavens. Since he could instantly unleash the third form, he should have been able to use the fourth form.

But when he tried, a sensation of crisis had filled his heart and he had changed to the third form. And yet, he still received a heavy backlash.

He had never tried activating the fourth form. He had been wanting to test it out, but that almost caused a disaster.

When Long Chen flew back, he wasn’t able to find any sign of the horned man. He had fled somehow.

Seeing his enemy had fled, he relaxed slightly. As a result, he coughed up another mouthful of blood. He hastily circulated the primal chaos bead to heal.

But Long Chen was shocked to find that the meridians he had cracked from attempting to use the fourth form were recovering very slowly.

“Is there some kind of secret with the fourth form of Split the Heavens?” wondered Long Chen.

“What is it, Long Chen?” Meng Qi and Tang Wan-er came over. They both saw that his expression was a bit ugly.

“I’m fine. I’m just irritated that he got away.” Long Chen shook his head.

Previously, he had been so confident. He had been sure he would be able to fight to the death against that horned man. But he had still escaped.

But even if he hadn’t run, Long Chen no longer had any assurance of killing him. His damaged meridians made it so he couldn’t use his full power.

Instead of defeating his enemy, his own energy had injured himself. Long Chen was extremely irritated. Such a stupid thing had actually happened to him.

“What the hell happened?!”

Just at this time, Su Mo and Mu Qingxuan’s group arrived. They had been attracted by the huge disturbance. Seeing countless corpses and everyone covered in blood, cleaning up a battlefield, they jumped in shock.

“You weren’t attacked?” asked Meng Qi with surprise.

“No? Everything was normal. What happened here?!” cried Mu Qingxuan.

“Now’s not the time to talk about it. Gather all the disciples. We’re going back to Xuantian City,” said Long Chen.

On the way, they explained what had happened. Mu Qingxuan and Su Mo were shocked. They hadn’t expected the Heaven Suppressing Magic Sect to be so crazy as to attack the Xuantian Dao Sect’s disciples.

“But why didn’t they attack us?” asked Mu Qingxuan.

“Perhaps it’s to prevent the Xuantian Dao Sect from going crazy. If all the new disciples are killed, at least they’ll have the old disciples to continue their inheritance. But if the old and new disciples are killed, that would leave them with no options. Then the Xuantian Dao Sect would have a true fight to the death with them.” Long Chen could only come up with such a guess.

However, while this was the most logical guess he could come up with, he knew the Heaven Suppressing Magic Sect’s idiots didn’t know what logic was. Despite thinking about it from a hundred different angles, he couldn’t figure out just what they were planning.

“Is there still no news from Gao Xianyang?” asked Long Chen.

“No. It seems they’ve turned off their communication runes. We can’t even find them.” Su Mo, Wang Zhen, and the others shook their heads.

“Boss, you don’t think that...” asked Gu Yang.

“There’s no proof, so it’s meaningless to guess. Furthermore, that seems unlikely. Gao Xianyang isn’t an idiot, and he knows doing such a thing has no benefit to him. Starting today, we’re staying within Xuantian City until the beast tide,” said Long Chen.

“But then when the beast tide occurs, the number of sea demons will reach a terrifying level,” said Su Mo.

All of them had now realized that the beast tide this time was going to be extremely terrifying. When they went out hunting, cleaning out the ninth rank sea demons in one area took them a long time. If they didn’t take advantage of this time to kill some more, then when the beast tide occurred, their numbers would be inestimable.

“It’s fine. I have a plan for that. As for the Heaven Suppressing Magic Sect, they lost so much this time. Tens of thousands of their disciples were killed, and only two escaped. With their idiotic character, it’s very likely that they’ll return to get revenge. They have more disciples than us, and it’s too easy for them to ambush us on the sea. But as long as we hold back our troops, they won’t dare to attack Xuantian City. Then that would no longer be as simple as conflicting views between two sects. They don’t dare,” said Long Chen.

“Why don’t we report this to the sect?” probed Mu Qingxuan.

“There’s no need. The Xuan Master already told me that anything can happen here, and that we needed to resolve whatever happens ourselves. Furthermore, what do you think they’d do if we reported it? The Elders can’t enter this region. Do you want the sect to send outer sect disciples? Isn’t that just suicide for them?” Long Chen shook his head.

“But-” started Mu Qingxuan.

“Qingxuan, Long Chen is the commander. He has his own plans, so don’t keep asking. Don’t you feel like you’re being a worrywart?” said Su Mo.

“You! You’re saying such a thing to me? Tonight, don’t come to my room!” declared Mu Qingxuan. But she quickly realized she had misspoken. She turned red and fled.

Everyone else looked oddly at Su Mo. Long Chen clapped. “Who would have thought that senior apprentice-brother Su Mo would be this efficient? Congratulations, congratulations!”

“Senior apprentice-brother Su Mo is mighty!”

“Senior apprentice-brother Su Mo is domineering!”

“Senior apprentice-brother Su Mo is mighty and domineering!”

Gu Yang and the others seemed to wish the whole world would be in chaos, and they cheered along.

Su Mo looked like he wanted to cry. He had just wanted to give some advice and hadn’t expected to fall into such a situation. If he had known this would happen, he wouldn’t have even opened his mouth.

Under everyone’s sight, he could only force a smile and leave. But everyone was well aware Su Mo was about to have a rough couple of days.

After this, they did a check of their losses. The Ten Thousand Insect Guild had suffered the most, while the Heaven Female Alliance had lost a few hundred people. The Dragonblood Legion had a couple of dozen people injured, but no one had died. That was the result of Guo Ran’s armor.

Long Chen had Wang Zhen bring in a few people from Su Mo’s group. Su Mo’s group contained the disciples who had come from the Divine Beast Mansion, Hegemon Hall, and Flame Gate.

Su Mo had a few of his experts lead them, but it was difficult. As for the Heaven Female Alliance, they only accepted women, so only Wang Zhen could lead them.

Long Chen had Wang Zhen take in ten thousand new disciples, causing him to jump. He didn’t dare to lead that many people, because the battle had caused his side’s power to drop. He felt he was unable to convince so many people to follow him.

“Whether or not you can lead your people isn’t dependent on how strong you are, but whether or not you can treat each of your subordinates as a brother. As for the strength aspect, leave that to me. I will allow your power to grow explosively in a short amount of time.” Long Chen patted Wang Zhen on the shoulder.
