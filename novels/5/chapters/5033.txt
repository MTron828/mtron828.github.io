Chapter 5022 Laying All the Cards on the Table

Long Chen knew what Long Tianrui wanted to say the moment he saw the look in her eyes. It was his first time feeling such a headache dealing with a woman.

Most importantly, he couldn’t classify her as an enemy or a friend, nor label her an idiot or a genius. The way her mind worked was simply incomprehensible to an ordinary person.

“Fairy Tianrui, please give me pointers!” The man facing Long Tianrui bowed deeply before drawing his own weapon. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Long Tianrui nodded, turning to look at her opponent. She didn’t say anything and just stared. Her opponent took a step back and pointed his weapon at Long Tianrui, but he suddenly stiffened.

The space on the martial stage seemed to have frozen, causing all the spectators to feel baffled.

What was going on? Long Tianrui was clearly indicating for him to attack. Why wasn’t he moving? Furthermore, Long Tianrui was just staring at him.

On the martial stage, the martial stage was covered in a strange aura. Long Chen’s heart shook when he felt it.

It felt like there were millions of Long Tianrui on the martial stage, looking at him from every possible angle. No matter how he moved, she would see it clearly. There was no concealing anything from her gaze.

In fact, her gaze seemed able to pierce his soul and expose all his secrets. A powerful Spiritual Strength had filled the entire arena, one that could make a person’s will crumble.

Long Chen realized that this was Long Tianrui’s perception, but it was his first time encountering such a terrifying perception. It felt as if any move he could make was within her predictions, and he couldn’t escape or resist no matter what. It was enough to drive someone into despair.

This level of perception was most likely an innate gift, an extremely terrifying talent. Long Chen looked at Long Tianrui, and she looked back at him. The martial stage seemed almost frozen in time.

At this moment, the disciple facing Long Tianrui started to tremble. Sweat dripped down his forehead, revealing just how hard he was struggling.

At first, Long Tianrui’s gaze was on him, and the immense pressure made him feel like his will would crumble. However, when Long Tianrui shifted her gaze to Long Chen, the pressure instantly lightened. At that moment, the disciple was no longer Long Tianrui’s opponent; he felt more like an umpire, or more accurately, a spectator.

Finally, a clattering sound broke the silence as Long Tianrui’s opponent was unable to keep hold of his weapon, which fell to the ground.

Long Tianrui retracted her perception. The disciple seemed to lose any support holding him up and collapsed, panting for breath.

“Long Tianrui wins!” announced Long Chen. He sent that disciple out and also left. While Long Tianrui was powerful, Long Chen wasn’t afraid of her. He was just scared of her crazy ideas. Giving her no chance to speak, Long Chen directly fled away.

After returning to his residence, Long Chen recalled Long Tianrui’s terrifying perception, still feeling shocked by it. Her innate talent could make a person incapable of even summoning the courage to attack her.

Most importantly, that was only the tip of the iceberg. Who knew how much power lay behind her emotionless expression?

“No wonder she wants to find a powerful person to have children with. If she found someone ordinary, it would be an absolute waste for this innate talent to not be transmitted to the next era!” Long Chen wondered aloud. He suddenly felt like he understood Long Tianrui a bit better.

Should I consider...?

Hey! What are you thinking?

Long Chen expelled those impractical thoughts from his head. He then took out the violet crystal heavenly eye again.

The Brahma Pill Valley’s experts had finished setting up their formations. They had encircled the Heavenly Desolation Domain in countless formation discs, each emitting a ray of light into the sky. Using the heavenly eye, he saw that the entire Heavenly Desolation Domain was encased in a cage.

“Hehe, it seems that the Brahma Pill Valley is willing to put in the capital to capture me!” Long Chen chuckled. He even felt a bit proud of himself.

However, Long Chen knew they viewed him so highly because of the High Firmament Academy, not because he had killed one of their vice hall masters.

The palace master had returned to the academy and reclaimed its land, making the High Firmament Academy no longer an easy target for the Brahma Pill Valley. Consequently, their attention turned toward Long Chen.

If the Brahma Pill Valley captured Long Chen, it would be a serious blow to the High Firmament Academy. That was why they were going to such lengths.

Long Chen’s gaze swept out. He noticed several isolated figures working on the outskirts of the Long clan’s territory, setting up a second layer of formations.

Long Chen looked more closely. Although he was not a formation master, he had learned quite a bit from Xia Chen. He recognized it as a trapping formation.

The outer formation screened off the heavens and tricked people’s senses, while the inner formation aimed to trap Long Chen. Once completed, even a two heaven vein expert wouldn’t be able to escape its grasp.

Upon seeing this, Long Chen was first baffled but quickly realized the truth. It seems that these old fellows aren’t fools. They didn’t tell the Brahma Pill Valley about the Earth Cauldron and want to keep it for themselves.

If the Brahma Pill Valley knew about the Earth Cauldron, they wouldn’t bother with these useless things. What formation could possibly block the Earth Cauldron? Wouldn’t they just end up having a hole smashed into them?

Upon seeing this trapping formation, Long Chen instantly realized what the four divine clans were up to.

“Hehe, good. I’ll reap them all together,” Long Chen snickered, a vicious light in his eyes.

Long Chen’s enmity with Lord Brahma had long reached a point where coexistence was impossible. The destruction of the Martial Heaven Continent ultimately lay at Lord Brahma’s hands.

Though the dragon expert had used its supreme abilities to evacuate the continent’s lifeforms before its destruction, the toll of that battle was immense. The fallen warriors of the Dragonblood Legion would never return. Thinking about them, Long Chen was filled with grief. This enmity could not be settled. Although he couldn’t deal with Lord Brahma himself, killing his followers was a viable option.

“Senior...” Long Chen called out to the Earth Cauldron.

Just then, a rune appeared in Long Chen’s hand, and the Earth Cauldron’s voice resonated around him. “I am at a critical juncture. Hand this rune to Qin Feng. When the time comes, I will send them away safely.”

Just as Long Chen was about to ask the Earth Cauldron about the timing to ensure Qin Feng and the others’ safety, he realized the Earth Cauldron had already planned it out.

With this assurance, Long Chen finally felt at ease. After stealthily passing the rune to Qin Feng, he went back into seclusion. When he emerged, he could unleash the dragon blood God Slaying Cross eighty times in a row, finding it easier each time. It was different from his expectations, indicating he was nearing the requirements set by the Earth Cauldron.

Arriving at the competition grounds, Long Chen saw Qin Feng and the mercenaries gathered together, no longer scattered among the spectator stands. At that moment, he knew today was the day they would lay all their cards on the table.
