Chapter 2480 Smoothly Making Money

The metal fist that was bigger than a mountain shattered into countless pieces.

Not only was the fist shattered but the earth as well. Everyone clearly saw a metal giant that was beneath the ground break into multiple pieces. A piece that was thousands of meters long was half of its head.

Those giant fragments tumbled through the air. A finger fell toward the dragon corpse and was knocked back by the barrier.

One person’s eyes lit up, and he took the risk of going outside the barrier, grabbing the finger.

However, his expression quickly changed. He was unable to put it away. This one finger was too heavy for him to move.

“What good stuff.” At this moment, Mo Nian also took action. Seeing a giant arm fragment flying over, he took out his bow. Divine light lit up as it struck the arm.

The void rumbled. Using some unknown technique, Mo Nian managed to stop the arm’s momentum and easily move it to his astral space.

“Damn, this is a kind of alloy formed from hundreds of immortal and divine metals!” Mo Nian was delighted and quickly gathered up seven large fragments. One of them was the largest piece, a piece of the head.

“Bastard, you dare to snatch my source metal? I’ll exterminate your entire family!” shouted Zhao Ritian, shocked upon seeing Mo Nian taking his giant spirit puppet’s fragments.

“Idiot, do you see anyone paying attention to you?” Mo Nian sneered and flew toward another fragment. However, before he could take it, it melted into the ground.

Mo Nian was startled to see that and hastily went to grab another fragment, only for the rest to all melt away. This place was Zhao Ritian’s domain.

“So petty. What’s wrong with taking a few pieces of your rotten metal?” Mo Nian curled his lips. Looking at the metal he had gathered in his astral space, he smiled. Those fragments were all treasures.

In the distance, Feng Fei’s heart pounded. She hadn’t expected Long Chen’s true power to be so great.

Zhao Ritian’s giant spirit puppet was made of countless immortal metals. It was incredibly tough and powerful as it was the core of his manifestation’s power.

Zhao Ritian’s manifestation was no ordinary manifestation. All the immortal and divine metals within it had been gathered for him by the Zhao family.

It made it look like Zhao Ritian was very rich, as if he had the ability to summon metals as he wished, but of everyone present, only Feng Fei knew how wrong that was.

Every time Zhao Ritian fought, he was burning money. That was because he was exhausting the metals he had gathered.

In order to keep up with that consumption, every time he went to a new place, he would gather the various metals in the ground.

When he fought, he could transform the land into his manifestation, absorbing any ores for his own use. If there was enough ore, he could keep up with the demand. But if the earth was barren, he would have to burn up his own stock.

Using up his stock was a painful thing for Zhao Ritian, while his giant spirit puppet was essentially a condensation of all his stock.

The reason he was able to turn the world into his manifestation was due to the metals he had gathered beforehand. The fragments of the giant spirit puppet that Mo Nian had taken were incredibly precious to him, and the fact that they were taken drove him crazy.

Absorbing the outside world’s metal and turning it into his source metal was a time-consuming process that required constant attention from him.

Although Feng Fei had known that Long Chen was very powerful, she had always felt that he wasn’t a match for her. That was her judgment as an expert. She had never been wrong before, but the fact that Long Chen had shattered Zhao Ritian’s giant spirit puppet made her feel like her judgment was no longer accurate. Perhaps she had to classify Long Chen as an expert on the same level as her.

As for Long Chen, he seemed to be a wild dragon in human form. With a body of flesh and blood, he was crushing Zhao Ritian’s Million Metal Body, completely suppressing him.

BOOM!

Zhao Ritian’s arms exploded. Long Chen was unstoppable. His power only continued to grow.

“Zhao Ritian, can you summon your puppet out again? Don’t worry, I have an understanding of Long Chen. He looks strong, but it’s a cover. If you summon a few more of those puppets, he definitely won’t be able to endure! I look favorably upon you, so don’t disappoint me!” encouraged Mo Nian.

This encouragement was clearly lacking any good intentions. All he wanted was to take more of Zhao Ritian’s source metal.

Other than Mo Nian, no one else had gained anything. Now, quite a few people tensed up in secret, thinking of how they might be able to sneak in some metal for themselves.

Every part of Zhao Ritian’s puppet was a priceless treasure. Taking a single piece was invaluable.

“Don’t hesitate. Listen to people’s advice! Look at how badly you’re being beaten! You don’t seem much stronger than a dog like this. Hurry up and fight back! Live up to your name and summon your puppet!” shouted Mo Nian.

At this time, Zhao Ritian was being continuously beaten back by Long Chen, unable to even retaliate. Every one of Long Chen’s punches left a dent in his body.

Zhao Ritian was shocked and infuriated. Long Chen’s power seemed limitless. Even after all this fighting, there were no signs of him starting to grow tired. Instead, his power grew.

In his vexed state, Mo Nian’s fanning of the flames made him feel like he would explode.

“Shut up! I don’t need you to encourage me! Once I kill Long Chen, you’re next!” roared Zhao Ritian. The distraction resulted in Long Chen landing a foot on his chest, leaving another large dent in his body.

“Tch, and you call yourself Ritian? What an arrogant name,” sneered Mo Nian. “Who can’t Ritian? As long as you’re a man, all you have to do is take off your pants and lay on your back. Do you think a badass name makes you amazing? With this name, I’m worried that you’ll pass away today.”[1]

Nangong Zuiyue and Beitang Rushuang reddened at how crass Mo Nian was speaking.

Feng Fei also glared at Mo Nian icily. This was the first time anyone had dared to speak like this before her.

“Girl, what are you looking at? If you want my pure body, just give up. This body belongs to someone else,” said Mo Nian in reply to Feng Fei’s glare, undaunted.

“Mo Nian, you had best reserve yourself a bit. Don’t force me to kill you,” said Feng Fei icily.

“Me, force you? Ha, haha, hahaha! What a great joke! Is there anyone in this world who dares to force the divine families to do anything? Isn’t it always the divine families forcing others? I haven’t even started settling the debt that the divine families owe the Mo family for harboring the ones who murdered our people, and you want me to reserve myself? The divine families really are interesting!” Mo Nian laughed arrogantly.

Although the last sneak attack against the Mo family had been mostly targeting Long Chen, it was an insult toward the Mo family.

In fact, perhaps if they had been targeting the Mo family, Mo Nian wouldn’t be so infuriated. But their only goal had been to force Long Chen out. The Mo family had actually been treated as an insignificant chess piece, and that was the greatest insult.

Although Mo Nian hadn’t mentioned that matter again, it didn’t mean that he had forgotten about it. He was extremely vengeful. He was ready to avenge this matter when he had a chance.

However, before he had even mentioned it, Feng Fei had further antagonized him, infuriating him.

“That matter has nothing to do with me. Don’t act wild around me,” said Feng Fei coldly.

“It has nothing to do with me? As expected of the shameless divine families. You cut yourself off from responsibility just by saying it has nothing to do with you. When they attacked the Mo family and my brother chased the killers to the Di family’s territory, who was it that stopped my brother? My brother doesn’t like fighting women, but you still forced him to fight. Let me tell you, when I fight, I don’t see a difference between men and women. There are only dead or living enemies. If you don’t like it, let’s fight right now. We can see if I’ll have mercy on you like Long Chen did,” said Mo Nian.

The space behind Mo Nian began to shudder as his battle intent rose, causing everyone else to jump. Mo Nian was actually challenging Feng Fei?

In the distance, Long Chen sighed. Mo Nian really had a skillful mouth. In his words, the draw between himself and Feng Fei had somehow turned into him having mercy on her.

Feng Fei was also enraged now. When had she ever required someone to have mercy on her? Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

“Since you want to stand up for Long Chen, come over and fight.” Killing intent blazed within Feng Fei. She was prepared to kill Mo Nian.

Mo Nian smiled and was about to speak when space shuddered as another figure arrived.

“Mo Nian, you think you can challenge senior Feng Fei? I, Di Feng, will handle you.”

Everyone was startled to see that the ancient family alliance’s Di Feng had arrived as well.
