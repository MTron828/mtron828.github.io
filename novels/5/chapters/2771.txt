Chapter 2760 Devil Soul Refining Song

Long Chen also had a bad feeling. As more time passed, Resentful Death City got closer to breaching the wall of this world. Part of it was already past the spatial wall.

Furthermore, as it moved toward the Martial Heaven Continent, Ye Ming’s power slowly rose. Hence, Long Chen estimated that Resentful Death City had to be hiding some kind of secret.

The reason that Gui Si was capable of fighting Sovereign Zi Yang for three days and nights was definitely related to Resentful Death City.

As for Ye Ming, he wanted to become a full Sovereign, which required Resentful Death City to enter the Martial Heaven Continent. He seemed to be guiding it in, while the rest of the Undying warriors simply charged at Long Chen to buy time for him. Their old Saints even threw themselves to their deaths to threaten Long Chen.

Long Chen looked at the altars, immortal palace, and coffin set up in the distance. He said, “They are most likely offering up the power of those who die. A portion of their power is then directly absorbed by the altars and sent to the Blood Fiend Devil Lord, the Alldevil Heavenwalker, the Nine-Headed Lion, and probably Long Aotian. With this attack, it doesn’t matter if they kill the people of the Martial Heaven Continent, or if their own people die. They are all turned into fertilizer so that those four can explosively leap to become Sovereigns.”

Long Chen could sense the auras of the Alldevil Heavenwalker, Blood Fiend Devil Lord, and Nine-Headed Lion starting to greatly change. Although they were still in a slumbering state, the auras of Emperors could be sensed from them. Perhaps they had silently advanced to the Emperor realm.

“Then what are you going to do?” asked Evilmoon.

“It’s a move with no counter. As long as people die, their energy will be absorbed. Wait, no…”

Long Chen’s expression suddenly changed, and he thought of an extremely bad possibility.

Suddenly, the world quivered. As Long Chen’s divine sense spread, he found that the entire continent was starting to rise.

“Not good. The Heaven Devastating Bracelet has started to contract. The Eastern Wasteland Bell is no longer able to suppress it.” Long Chen’s heart sank.

The Heaven Devastating Bracelet was doing the same thing as the altars. It was absorbing the power of the experts once they died. It was their true killing move.

Just at this moment, the Northern Source Sword, the Western Desert Ax, and the Central Plains Cauldron began to shine brightly. Their images appeared in the sky.

The image of the Eastern Wasteland Bell also manifested. All the four supreme divine items showed up, and recesses appeared in the sky of the Martial Heaven Continent, one in the east, west, north, and center. Their images perfectly entered those spaces.

Only the southern spot remained empty. An empty space shaped like a zither appeared, but the Southern Sea Zither didn’t appear.

After that, the entire world shuddered once again, and the Heaven Devastating Bracelet’s contraction temporarily stopped.

“You want to stop the Heaven Devastating Bracelet? Keep dreaming. Divine families, what are you doing? Have the Southern Sea Zither make its move,” the Kunpeng Emperor shouted at the immortal palace.

Everyone came to a sudden comprehension. So the Illusive Music Immortal Palace was actually part of the divine families. They could be considered the divine families’ eyes and ears, as well as their claws and fangs.

At this moment, the void split apart and a group of people appeared. Upon seeing them, Long Chen’s body involuntarily trembled in rage. Killing intent exploded within him.

“Illusive Music Immortal Palace!” Long Chen clenched his teeth, wanting to charge over and slaughter them right now.

The Illusive Music Immortal Palace’s people that came were all old monsters. No disciples of their younger generation appeared, and the one leading them was the Music Master.

The Music Master’s old kindly aura had transformed into vicious brutality. The mask had been torn off.

“It seems that at this crucial moment, you still need my Illusive Music Immortal Palace.” The Music Master looked over the battlefield. Spotting Long Chen in the distance, she sneered, “Do you hate me? Too bad that even if you hate me, you can’t do anything about it. All of you will be destroyed along with the Martial Heaven Continent.”

“Zi Yan!”

After the Music Master shouted, Zi Yan woodenly appeared beside her. Her eyes were completely lifeless like she was a puppet, and her face was so pale that it hurt to see her like that.

“Old bitch, you won’t have a good death!” Long Chen roared furiously, but he couldn’t charge over because no one could be Ye Ming’s match other than him. He was worried that Meng Qi and the others wouldn’t be able to stop him. But seeing Zi Yan’s haggard, blank face, Long Chen was crazy with rage.

“You spoke wrongly. You’re the ones who won’t have a good death.” The Music Master then laughed sinisterly. “Zi Yan, attack the Central Plains Cauldron. As long as the Central Plains Cauldron is attacked, their formation will instantly become unbalanced. That was how their formation was broken back in the day. We can repeat the same play as back then, hahaha!”

After that, the Southern Sea Zither appeared in Zi Yan’s hands, while seven old crones moved behind her, their hands emitting rays of light into Zi Yan’s body. She was like a puppet moving to their strings.

Those rays of light were the Southern Sea Zither’s zither soul. In order to guarantee that there would be no accidents, it was being controlled jointly by all seven of them, and through it, they controlled Zi Yan.

Zi Yan’s fingers expressively moved across the seven strings, and notes began to ring through the air. It was like an overture of death, phonetic symbols that took all life.

“Zi Yan, wake up. The time for vengeance has come.” Suddenly, a voice rang out within Zi Yan’s mind. That voice felt like it was coming from a distant world.

Zi Yan’s body quivered. His lifeless eyes gradually recovered their luster. However, these changes were not noticed by the Music Master and the others who stood behind her.

“Zi Yan, attack.”

Seeing Zi Yan stopping suddenly, the Music Master shouted. She also formed hand seals at the same time, and a rune appeared on Zi Yan’s forehead.

This was the slave heart mark, a rune that controlled a person’s mind. Those who fell to this rune would essentially become another person’s puppet, incapable of resisting.

“You want me to attack?”

Zi Yan suddenly turned back, staring at the Music Master with a gaze that was so sharp it felt like two blades were stabbing the Music Master’s heart.

“You…!” The Music Master suddenly had a bad feeling.

Blood splashed.

Zi Yan’s hand streaked across the Music Master’s throat, and her thin fingernail cut off her neck. As a result, a headless body fell.

Zi Yan’s sudden turn caught all the Illusive Music Immortal Palace’s experts off guard. The seven old crones controlling the zither soul were about to make their moves when the light blazing in their hands suddenly flew out of their control and entered the Southern Sea Zither.

“How is that possible?!” All their expressions changed. This zither soul was under hundreds of their seals? How could it have run off?

“You…!”

The Music Master’s head was in Zi Yan’s hand, staring in terror and shock at Zi Yan. Right now, Zi Yan’s old warmth had vanished, and her face was frighteningly cold. Killing intent that had never existed before flickered in her eyes.

“Since you want me to attack, I won’t stand on courtesy.”

Zi Yan suddenly crushed the Music Master’s head with her hand and extracted her Yuan Spirit.

“You used me to harm the person that I love the most. How about I use your souls to play the Devil Soul Refining Song?”

Zi Yan’s fingers once more fell upon the zither strings, and all the heads of over ten thousand experts of the Illusive Music Immortal Palace suddenly exploded.
