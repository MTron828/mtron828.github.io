Chapter 3244 Only I, Mo Nian, Will Rise to Glory

As soon as Long Chen entered the inner academy, he was surrounded by a group of experts. There were hundreds of them, all Primals. They had come from outside this domain.

After Long Chen spread his name in the Nine Prefecture Convention, countless experts near the Heavenly Swell Domain came to challenge him. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

Xu Zixiong was one of them, but he was the luckiest. As his head wasn’t very good, he had actually barged through the devil sea on his own, so he was the fastest.

The others had to use the Huayun Trading Company’s merchant ships, paying an impressive price to come here. They were all hot-blooded youngsters with outstanding talent and immense arrogance. As soon as they saw Long Chen’s overbearing display in the photographic jade, they were provoked. They came to challenge him, and through beating him, their names would resound even louder.

Defeating famous experts was the fastest way to fame. Youngsters all possessed their own pride, and their heads were simple. Hence, they always liked to walk shortcuts.

Because of this, although the price to pass through the devil sea hurt, it was a price that they were willing to pay.

It was only when they arrived at the High Firmament Academy that they were completely dumbfounded. Many fellow challengers had come, just to line up. In the last few days, it was unknown how many fights had erupted between them. Some people always felt themselves to be special and cut in line.

None of them were willing to take a loss lying down. Thus, all kinds of fights broke out between them. There were over ten people that the High Firmament Academy had to rescue.

Hence, when Long Chen arrived, those idle experts immediately swarmed him.

“Long Chen, I was first! I challenge you to a fight!”

One of those experts was afraid others would get the lead, and he immediately charged at Long Chen, unleashing a punch. Powerful qi waves surged out of him. His power was very much not bad.

BOOM!

However, people didn’t even get a look at what happened. They only saw that expert get sent flying like a shooting star, smashing into a giant stele.

That stele was for the earth rankings of experts. There was a formation protecting it, and that person simply smashed into it like an egg and slid down. Even egg yolk dripped out. When he slid down the stele, his shape no longer resembled a human.

“Scram. I don’t have time for this nonsense.” After sending that person flying away, Long Chen ignored these people, heading straight for his residence.

At this time, Elders of the academy carefully peeled the shattered ‘egg’ off of the stele.

“Good, he can still be saved. Send him to the infirmary!”

“Why are all of you doing this? Do you not know that there is a phrase in the Heavenly Swell Domain: provoke a Yama King, but don’t provoke Boss Long San. Youngsters really don’t have any respect. What a shame.”

Those Elders dragged the limp ‘egg’ away with them, while other Elders cleaned up the egg yolk on the stele. Everything was quickly cleaned up.

Those experts from outside the domain were dumbfounded. They hadn’t even seen how this person was defeated. They were confused, not knowing if they should stay here or leave.

“Hey, don’t be dejected. My boss is busy and doesn’t have time for you, but we all have time. Furthermore, my boss isn’t someone that anyone can challenge. Why not beat me, and then you’ll win the qualifications to fight him? Come, we can fight in order of who came first. Don’t worry, I won’t be as fierce as my boss. As guests that came from so far, we martial friends will make sure not to go too far,” said Qin Feng.

That instantly made those challengers feel better. After all, they had crossed the devil sea to come here. They couldn’t return empty-handed.

“These experts must have quite a few techniques that you haven’t seen before. We can exchange pointers, and it will benefit you. Furthermore, the academy’s disciples can watch and also learn. Don’t miss this chance,” whispered Qin Feng when he saw that Bai Xiaole and Xu Zixiong were confused. Only then did everyone realize why Qin Feng was so enthusiastic.

As a result, they received these challengers. They requested the academy to arrange a martial stage to exchange pointers.

Once the news spread, countless disciples were excited and came over to get the best seats to watch.

Long Chen ignored all those. With just a single glance, Long Chen could tell the depth of these challengers. Perhaps their talent wasn’t bad, but their true combat power wouldn’t be much stronger than Xu Zixiong when he had come. They were all arrogant fellows who thought themselves to be peerless geniuses and wanted fame.

True experts naturally wouldn’t waste all the time and effort to cross domains just to challenge him. That was because true experts didn’t need approval from others, nor did they care about fame.

“Brother Long, it’s been many years, but you are still the same as ever!”

Zheng Wenlong also appeared the same as before, steady and refined. But when he saw Long Chen, he couldn’t help spreading his arms and folding Long Chen into a fierce embrace.

“This is great. Us brothers have finally been reunited. I feel much steadier inside now,” said Long Chen emotionally.

The battle of the Martial Heaven Continent had thrown Zheng Wenlong into immense danger, while Long Chen had done his best but hadn’t had the ability to save him. Fortunately, he had survived on his own.

“It’s all thanks to the Wealth God that we have met once more. I know that my path to wealth will once more shine gloriously. I’m sure you don’t mind me putting it like that, hahaha!” Zheng Wenlong laughed. The two of them were both filled with emotions at being reunited.

“Of course I don’t mind. This is the core of a businessman. I’m at ease with you handling my business,” said Long Chen, smiling. Zheng Wenlong was the businessman that Long Chen trusted the most. He could even entrust his life to him.

“When I first entered the immortal world, I had to start all over. The Huayun Trading Company’s rules are all fair. The greater your business, the better you do, the greater privileges that are afforded to you. Fortunately, I received the Wealth God’s care. I can rapidly rise, and you are my main benefactor!”

“Hehe, between the two of us, there’s no need for courteous words. You’re going to embarrass me if you put it like that,” laughed Long Chen.

Long Chen and Zheng Wenlong had mutually helped each other for a long time now, and their cooperation had brought both sides immense benefits. With Zheng Wenlong’s arrival, Long Chen felt much better about the future.

“Have you heard anything about people from the Martial Heaven Continent?” asked Long Chen.

“I only heard some news about Mo Nian. That fellow’s name is an existence that shakes the nine heavens and ten lands. It really is a case of only Mo Nian rises to glory!” sighed Zheng Wenlong.
