Chapter 2867 Companion Ore

Flames wrapped around Long Chen like protective clothing. Huo Long was already in control of a bit of the Scarlet Spirit Flame’s power.

With this protection, he didn’t fear the lava here. He dived down. The bottom was at three hundred meters. Here, he spread his divine sense, allowing him to see things within several meters. He quickly found a stone egg.

This stone egg was the size of a human. It was just like a goose egg. There were countless runes on top of it. The lava around it twisted and turned.

“This is the companion ore of the Heavenly Flame seed.” Long Chen was delighted. His intuition was correct. As soon as he saw this egg, knowledge about it entered his mind.

It was as if he had originally known these things, but so much time had passed that he was unable to recall them. But when something appeared to trigger them, he remembered.

Long Chen grabbed the egg. A light sound came from below. It was like something down below had broken. He pulled it into the primal chaos space and looked down.

There was a flower-shaped throne below the egg. It was what had given birth to this companion ore.

Long Chen snapped off the ore, and a tiny little bead slowly condensed on the throne. When the companion ore was taken off, a new one was born.

However, it was tinier than a grain of sand right now. For it to grow to the old size would take tens of thousands of years. This companion ore could be considered the food of the Heavenly Flame seed. It absorbed the energy of the ore to grow.

When the companion ore’s energy was exhausted, it would crumble. Then a new ore would be born in wait for the next Heavenly Flame seed.

The Heavenly Flame seed was born from the heavens. The companion ore was born from the earth. First the companion ore appeared, drawing the power of the Heavenly Daos to condense a Heavenly Flame seed.

This term, companion ore, was something that people had called it from the start. It was unknown who started this, but it seemed to go against the proper order of who was first. No one knew why people continued to call it that.

The companion ore’s energy was the foundation of the Heavenly Flames seed’s growth. Once Huo Long finished refining the Heavenly Flame seed, it could then absorb this companion ore’s energy, strengthening it further. It could be said that Long Chen’s gains this time were truly immense.

Long Chen looked at the throne next. It absorbed the power of the earth to give birth to the companion ore. If it was taken, the power within would probably be around the same level as the actual companion ore. However, once it was taken, there would never be another companion ore born here. There would never be another Heavenly Flame seed here.

Long Chen shook his head. Although he didn’t care about some curse from the heavens, ruining such a natural wonder wasn’t worth it. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

The lava surged as Long Chen flew out. Luo Bing and Luo Ning had already grown a bit anxious waiting for him.

“Sorry for making you wait,” said Long Chen. His mood was particularly good right now.

“As long as you’re alright, it’s fine.” Luo Bing smiled.

“Ah, I should apologize. This Heavenly Flame seed is, to me…” said Long Chen.

This Heavenly Flame seed was first found by Luo Bing and Luo Ning. Now it had fallen in his hands. If it was something else, he would probably return it to them. But this Heavenly Flame seed’s significance was far too great for him.

“No need. We would have died here if it weren’t for you. Even if Chu Kuang didn’t come, it’s unknown whether or not we would have been able to capture it this time. There would have been danger either way. We won’t hold this against you, so don’t worry,” said Luo Bing.

Luo Bing was already beautiful, but when she smiled, it was like a flower blooming. Long Chen grew a bit foolish when he looked at her. He wondered if his mother looked like her. He only knew that her voice was soft and gentle.

His feelings towards his mother grew stronger. Seeing him staring at her so intently, Luo Bing blushed and turned away.

“Hey, Long Chen, do you not know how to talk? My big sister and I take you as a brother. Are you planning on seducing my big sister?” demanded Luo Ning, waving her hand in front of Long Chen.

“Ning-er, you’re a woman. How can you talk like that?” chided Luo Bing. She also had no way to handle her little sister. Her way of talking was so direct that it was too much.

Long Chen was embarrassed. Staring at her like that was truly wrong. “Sorry, I was reminded of something else when I saw you. I hope you won’t take offense.”

This apology now made Luo Bing a bit embarrassed. She didn’t know what to say to alleviate this awkward atmosphere.

“Long Chen, why do we feel a strange closeness with you? What attribute is your immortal seed?” asked Luo Ning.

This so-called mortal seed referred to the Spirit Root after transcending mortality. It could be considered a transformation of the Spirit Root. There were all kinds of attributes, metal, wood, water, fire, earth, find, lightning, light, dark. Some complimented each other. Some suppressed each other. It was possible for similar elements to feel closer, which was why Luo Ning asked this.

Long Chen smiled. “It has nothing to do with the immortal seed. The reason we feel close might be because we will be part of the same family in the future.”

The family that he referred to was his mother’s family that they were also part of. But the two of them were unaware of that. Who would have thought that Long Chen would say something so explicit?

Seeing Luo Bing flush, Long Chen instantly realized that he had misspoke. But now he didn’t know how he should explain himself.

Right now, he still couldn’t expose his identity. One reason for that was because according to his information, his mother had had a falling out with her father, causing her to run to the lower plane where she fell in love with Long Zhantian and gave birth to him. Whether or not his status would be recognized by the Luo family was still unknown.

The other thing was that if he did reveal who he was, if that information spread, it would not be favorable to him.

After all, he hadn’t killed Long Aotian. Long Aotian would report what he knew to the Long family of the immortal world. If Long Chen’s status was revealed now, it might draw endless hunters.

“Becoming a family is no problem, but you had better be prepared. The Luo family’s women don’t marry out. If you want to marry in, it’s possible though,” said Luo Ning very magnanimously.

“Ning-er!” scolded Luo Bing. How on earth could she speak about such a topic so shamelessly?

“So there’s such a thing?” Long Chen smiled.

“There wasn’t before. But over twenty years ago, something happened in the family that enraged the family head. After that, the Luo family’s women weren’t permitted to marry out.” Luo Ning shrugged indifferently.

“What happened?” asked Long Chen, his heart pounding.

Luo Ning said, “The family head’s daughter-”

“Ning-er! How can you randomly discuss the family head’s matters? Have you forgotten the family’s rules?” shouted Luo Bing.

Long Chen’s heart pounded like a drum. He had a feeling that the person that the two of them were talking about was his mother.
