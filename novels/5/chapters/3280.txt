Chapter 3269 Lifeform of the Ghost Dao

Underworld ghost seed, an ancient secret. Legend was that they were the source of all the chaos in the immortal world. They were part of the Ghost Dao and had always been infiltrating the immortal world.

Those people who had underworld ghost seeds implanted in them became puppets for the Ghost Dao but appeared normal on the surface.

Many experts were even completely unaware that they were underworld ghost seeds. It was similar to a slave seed rooted deep within their soul.

Furthermore, it would silently accumulate a mysterious power. The legend was that many invaders of the Ghost Dao had infiltrated the immortal world back in ancient times. The underworld ghost seeds then became lackeys for the Ghost Dao, allowing them to attack the immortal world from the inside and outside, dealing serious damage.

The current immortal world still had many ancient battlefields overflowing with ghost qi. Also, people didn’t dare to set foot there because countless lifeforms of the Ghost Dao were buried there.

The lifeforms of the Ghost Dao were absolutely terrifying, which was why all their expressions changed when Long Chen mentioned an underworld ghost seed.

Jiang Baihe’s eyes had turned black, and he emitted a sinister light. Now, black qi revolved around him, and his aura had completely changed. His current appearance was chilling.

When Jiang Baihe extended a hand, the giant golden scepter flew into his hold, transforming into a nine-foot-long form.

“Damnable human race, you ruined all my work. I’ll definitely kill you today.”

Jiang Baihe’s voice had also changed, becoming sharp and thin. It pierced people’s ears like a needle.

The current Jiang Baihe was no longer human. His consciousness had been completely dominated by the underworld ghost seed.

“That will depend on whether or not you have that ability. Speaking of which, let me ask you something. I once encountered a Ghost Ship and saw many death spirits on top of it. Are those the same as you?” asked Long Chen lightly.

Jiang Baihe’s black eyes seemed shocked. He coldly said, “Brat, you really have big guts. You even dare to enter a Ghost Ship. You’ve been infected by immense karma. You and your family, everyone connected to you, will die miserable deaths.”

Hearing that Long Chen had entered a Ghost Ship, the Yuhua Palace’s experts were stunned. They felt a chill on their backs.

When others saw Ghost Ships, they instantly fled, afraid of being infected by misfortune just from an extra glance.

However, Long Chen was actually aboard one of those Ghost Ships? What were his guts made out of?

“Tch, I’ve seen many secrets, so I’m not afraid of trouble. No wonder I felt Jiang Baihe was so loathsome and I wanted to crush him. So it was you. I’m curious, legend says that when underworld ghost seeds appear, calamity will descend, and the people will be in peril. So does your arrival indicate that the immortal world’s era of peace is coming to an end?” asked Long Chen.

In the Luo family, Luo Zichuan had mentioned that the immortal world’s peace was about to be broken. Long Chen was still unclear on what that meant.

Luo Zichuan had only mentioned it and not explained it. But with the Ghost Ship he had seen on the devil sea and this underworld ghost seed here, Long Chen felt like he had gotten a sniff of something unusual.Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“No matter how your human race cultivates, you will still be livestock to be slaughtered. Asking so many questions is meaningless,” sneered Jiang Baihe.

Long Chen smiled. “Ah, no wonder people say ghosts are shrewd! It seems that the lifeforms of the Ghost Dao really are smart! So you won’t leak any useful information! Then let me see just how powerful the lifeforms of the Ghost Dao are.”

Long Chen suddenly slid forward. Despite moving in an arc, he gave people the feeling that he was going straight.

Just as he attacked, Jiang Baihe also made his move. Black qi erupted from his body and coiled around his scepter. He formed a hand seal with his left hand.

BOOM!

The bone blade and the golden scepter collided, unleashing an explosion of black qi and golden light. Long Chen rapidly pushed back Jiang Baihe.

“This is the power of a cultivator of the Ghost Dao? It doesn’t seem to be anything special,” said Long Chen disdainfully.

Suddenly, a pair of bat-like wings appeared on Jiang Baihe’s back. After that, the void shuddered and his retreat came to a stop.

Those bat wings spread, unleashing a wave of sinister aura. Two sharp bone nails then appeared on the tips of the wings, and they stabbed toward Long Chen.

Those three-feet-long nails unleashed an ear-piercing sound, as if the ten thousand Daos were even pierced by them.

Long Chen shoved him back and retreated, just narrowly avoiding those bone nails.

“If it weren't for the suppression of the laws here, how could you even receive three blows from me?!” shouted Jiang Baihe. With his wings spread and his golden scepter, he pressed the attack against Long Chen.

Moreover, countless eye designs appeared on his wings, which continued to emit black qi. The air of death filled that black qi. It was as if the laws of heaven and earth were being corroded.

Attacks rained down from Jiang Baihe’s wings and scepter. Surrounded by black qi, he was like a ghost king. He repeatedly forced Long Chen back.

“That black qi seems to contain a similar aura to the auras on the Ghost Ship. They really are from the same place.” Long Chen’s heart shook. If Luo Zichuan was correct and the immortal world’s era of peace was about to come to an end, then this fellow and the group behind him were one of the causes.

Jiang Baihe’s sudden eruption of power and Long Chen’s forced retreat left the Yuhua Palace’s experts with complicated expressions. At this point, they didn’t even know who they should be cheering for.

If Jiang Baihe had turned into an underworld ghost seed, then he had to be killed. The underworld ghost seed had fully merged with him already, and they could no longer be separated. If they left him alive, he would cause a calamity.

Furthermore, if news spread that the Yuhua Palace dared to keep an infected Jiang Baihe, countless sects would join forces to wipe them off the map.

They all knew that this Jiang Baihe was no longer the old Jiang Baihe. He was already under the control of a lifeform of the Ghost Dao. All that remained of him was this husk.

Long Chen’s bone saber danced as he fought. He quickly began to take back the advantage. Even against three terrifying weapons, he was still fighting freely.

The patriarch once more pressed a hand against Jiang Weizhong. After that, the bindings on him vanished and he regained his freedom. However, his face was ashen now. He seemed to have aged several decades in an instant.

He knew that Jiang Baihe was already dead. The genius of their Jiang family that appeared only once every ten thousand years was dead.

Despite him being filled with hatred and resentment, the patriarch said, “Who would have thought that Jiang Baihe’s body would have an underworld ghost seed planted inside? However, all things have their own karma. If Jiang Baihe’s heart was firm, how could he have been infected by a ghost seed? Your vision was shortsighted as you only wanted a quick return. If you had properly taught him, instead of helping him clean up his messes, perhaps he wouldn’t have ended up like this. When he was fifteen, due to some unintentional words, he cruelly slaughtered someone, and you suppressed that matter. At seventeen, he assaulted and killed the woman of the Meng family. You were the one who went out and secretly gave them compensation to settle. You were unaware that your conduct drove him step by step into the abyss. Only then did the underworld ghost seed choose him…”

“Patriarch, you…” Jiang Weizhong was startled.

“Not mentioning it doesn’t mean that I didn’t know about it,” said the patriarch.

“Then… Why didn’t you stop it? If you had…” Jiang Weizhong’s voice quivered.

“Would stopping it have any use? I even came out of seclusion this time just to stop things, but what did you do? In the end, good and bad will get their retribution. The bitter wine that you brewed will have to be swallowed by you. You can’t blame others.” The patriarch shook his head and sighed.

BOOM!

Just then, an immense explosion shook the battlefield. Jiang Baihe suddenly raised his head and roared. Death qi swirled beneath his feet.

When people looked at the current Jiang Baihe, all their expressions changed.

“What monster is that?!”
