Chapter 3272 Qi Yu Returns

As Long Chen brought Bai Shishi and the others away, Qin Feng looked at the distant palace and sighed.

“There’s nothing to sigh about. Qi Yu has found a home for himself, and he’s accompanied by a great woman. We can be at peace with that,” said Long Chen.

Although that was what he said, in the end, he didn’t know what he felt about Qi Yu staying here. By staying here, it was fated that Qi Yu wouldn’t climb as high.

However, every person had their own will. Long Chen couldn’t force it, especially not when it came to love. Yu Xuan had helped Qi Yu out immensely, so for Qi Yu to stay behind was only right.

“Boss!”

Suddenly, they heard someone shouting, and Long Chen and the others saw Qi Yu rushing over to them. Long Chen’s expression sank.

Although he found it a bit hard to accept that Qi Yu would leave the Dragonblood Legion, it would be even more unacceptable for him to simply abandon his companion.

“Boss, listen to me! I… I explained it to Yu Xuan, and she agreed with me,” said Qi Yu hastily. “I told her that the appearance of an underworld ghost seed indicates that a great tribulation will likely befall the immortal world. Once the war starts, who will be safe? When the time comes, would I have to watch as the Ghost Dao’s experts slaughter everyone I care about? What if we have children and I can only watch as they are killed? We cannot endure such unimaginable pain. So, Yu Xuan has agreed with my decision. I have to get stronger, and only then can we live with dignity. If we aren’t strong enough, then even if we hide in the Yuhua Palace, we will be powerless to resist when calamity strikes. She loves me, and I love her. She has promised to wait for me until I can provide a safe and stable home for her.”

Hearing that, Long Chen’s face softened. “You aren’t lying?”

“Boss, how could I have the courage to do such a thing? She really has agreed with me. She isn’t here herself because she’s worried that she won’t be able to handle saying goodbye. So I came by myself…” Qi Yu’s eyes reddened slightly. Clearly, he was also unwilling to part with Yu Xuan.

Yu Xuan had helped him pass through the most difficult days of his life. He was unwilling to part with this warm and gentle woman, but there was also no helping it.

He wasn’t the only one who sensed how serious the problem was. Just from the expression of the patriarch, it could be seen just how grave the implications of an underworld ghost seed were.

It was precisely due to this that everyone in the Yuhua Palace was deeply worried, and Yu Xuan was no exception. Thus, she didn’t stop Qi Yu from leaving.

Long Chen then nodded and patted Qi Yu’s shoulder. He smiled slightly. “Brother. Welcome back.”

Seeing that Long Chen didn’t decline, Qi Yu was overjoyed. He had been worried that Long Chen would reject him due to Yu Xuan.

“Good brother, let’s all work hard so that we can live with dignity. When we climb to the peak with boss, we’ll create our own peaceful world. Then we can all marry and have children. We can spend our days drinking and eating, playing with our children!” Qin Feng laughed. He was delighted that Qi Yu had returned.

The heavy atmosphere from encountering an underworld ghost seed lightened due to everyone’s joy at Qi Yu’s return. After that, they went to a nearby valley and killed some pheasants. They wanted to cook them by the river for celebration.

“Boss, what is an underworld ghost seed? You should know a bit about them, right?” After eating, Qin Feng couldn’t help asking this question as he poured a bowl of wine for Long Chen.

Everyone’s ears perked up. Even Bai Shishi put down her wine and looked at Long Chen.

Long Chen finished his wine and solemnly said, “This matter is an ancient secret, and there are only some fragmentary mentions within the records of the academy. Some of what I know came from those fragments, while some are what I guessed based on the questionable period within history. When speaking of the Ghost World, it is not too different from the Netherworld. However, the Netherworld and the Ghost World are two different worlds. Based on the six Daos, you would have the Hell Dao and the Hungry Ghost Dao. But if you view them purely based on the six Daos, it would be a bit contradictory and wouldn’t make sense. Thus, all you need to know is that the Ghost World possesses its own independent world with its own laws just like the Netherworld. The Netherworld is where living creatures go to when they die. However, based on what I know, not every lifeform goes to the Netherworld after dying…”

When Long Chen mentioned this, he thought of Leng Yueyan and Ming Cangyue. They were gods in control of a Netherworld.Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

Long Chen knew more about the Netherworld than others. But when it came to the Ghost Dao, it was such a mysterious existence that even he was unable to come into contact with it.

Long Chen continued, “Furthermore, it appears that speaking of the Ghost Dao is taboo in the immortal world. I’ve gone through many texts, and whenever the topic starts to shift to this area, they will simply brush it off and not give any details. As for the underworld ghost seed, I don’t really know much. I wanted to grab Jiang Baihe’s underworld ghost seed to study it, but it really was ruthless. I almost got injured by it.”

Hearing that vague explanation, everyone was disappointed. But Long Chen smiled.

“There’s no need to be nervous. What will come, will come. Worrying won’t help. But based on what we saw today, the immortal world will very likely be flipped on its head soon. What we need to do is gather all the brothers of the Dragonblood Legion before that day comes. Otherwise, if we are all scattered when the calamity strikes, we’ll be beaten one by one,” said Long Chen.

Qi Yu nodded. In the Yuhua Palace, the patriarch’s worried expression had told him that the immortal world was not the free world of gods and immortals that he had imagined.

In this place, there was also fighting; there was also killing. In fact, this place might be worse than the Martial Heaven Continent. At the very least, on the Martial Heaven Continent, people cared about relationships. That didn’t hold so strongly in the immortal world.

People in the immortal world possessed long lifespans, and an ordinary cultivator could live for thousands of years effortlessly. So, they could reproduce tens or even hundreds of generations of people. They might not even know how many children they had, let alone care about their relationships.

It was precisely due to this merciless immortal world that Qi Yu cherished the warmth that Yu Xuan had given him. That was why he had to get stronger to protect her. Within this chaotic world, he would create a peaceful home for her.

If he wanted to get stronger, he had to follow Long Chen. The other Dragonblood warriors were the same. They had to join forces in order to protect themselves.

“Now what?” asked Bai Shishi.

Long Chen’s smile suddenly turned mischievous. Bai Shishi stared at him oddly, not knowing what this smile indicated.

All of a sudden, Long Chen waved his finger and pointed behind him. Bai Shishi instantly understood.

When a sword came flying out of its sheath, golden light exploded. It slashed in the direction that Long Chen pointed.
