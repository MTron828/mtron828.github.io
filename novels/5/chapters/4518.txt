Chapter 4507 Great Desolate Beast

At some point, that giant vortex had shrunk. If it closed, Long Chen wouldn’t even have a place to cry.

During Long Chen’s confrontation with the ugly assassin, the vortex started to contract. However, engrossed in the battle, he didn’t notice the change in the vortex.

By now, all the junior experts from Darklight Heaven had entered, leaving Long Chen as the sole individual yet to pass through.

Hence, he pushed his Kunpeng wings to the limit as he rushed toward the vortex. The opening was now only a few miles wide and was on the verge of closing. Fortunately, Long Chen was fast enough, and just as it was about to close, Long Chen charged in and vanished.

A powerful suction force drew Long Chen into a spatial channel, and Long Chen saw an endless starry sea before him.

Streaks of starlight flew by him. Long Chen felt like he had entered a spacetime channel. However, he also felt a terrifying pressure crash down on him from every direction.

“How hateful…”

Long Chen felt squeezed, his bones creaking. The spacetime energy pressing on him was so intense that blood started to ooze from his eyes, nose, and mouth.

Long Chen instantly thought of that assassin. He suspected that the assassin knew the secret of this channel and had intentionally stalled Long Chen to make him suffer this terrifying pressure.

“Bastard!” Long Chen roared. The terrifying spatial energy was so powerful that he felt like he would explode. Veins throbbed on his forehead as he resisted it.

In the end, Long Chen found himself ensnared in the schemes of the ugly man. Shocked and incensed, he wondered if the cunning man had truly orchestrated the entire scenario. If he really had planned all of this, he was truly terrifying. It suggested that he might not have even unleashed half of his true power, and he was inclined toward using intelligence to beat his opponents.

From the moment he attacked, he had set up a plan to place himself in an unbeatable position. His scheming skill ran quite deep.

“I can’t…!” Under this pressure, Long Chen’s skin became red, and his golden scales and astral runes appeared around him. His violet blood, dragon blood, and seven-color Supreme Blood automatically surged to life, instinctively activating to shield him.

Clearly, Long Chen was already on the brink of death, and his instinctual response was to resist with every ounce of his power.

Just as Long Chen felt like he couldn’t endure any longer, the spacetime channel exploded. After that, the terrifying pressure vanished. As countless fragments of spacetime flew about. Long Chen shot out like a shooting star, entering a new world.

BOOM!

Long Chen collided with a mountain, causing it to tremble as dust and dirt scattered through the air.

Long Chen was embedded into a cliff made of blood-colored stones. Even once he smashed into it, the rock remained intact after the impact. Long Chen, however, spat out blood, bearing the toll of the forceful collision.

This cliff was incomparably tough. The impact against it shook Long Chen’s organs, and stars spun in his eyes. Long Chen was shocked. Just what kind of cliffside was so strong?

Just as Long Chen was still dizzy, a heaven-shaking roar rang out, and Long Chen saw a giant black ape in front of him.

This devil beast wasn’t particularly large, only a few dozen meters tall. However, its berserk aura sent shivers down Long Chen’s spine.

A brutal killing intent exploded out of it as it lunged toward Long Chen, its feet unleashing ear-piercing explosive sounds as it stepped across the void.

“Fuck, how can I be this unlucky?!”

Long Chen was going to cough up blood from rage at this rate. Having just entered this world and still heavily wounded, he now found himself facing a Saint-level black ape.

This black ape’s Blood Qi contained desolate qi, indicating that it was an ancient great desolate species. Even with all of Long Chen’s learning, he was unable to recognize what exactly it was.

However, its terrifying Blood Qi was many times stronger than that of an average Saint. As Long Chen had almost been killed by the pressure of the spatial channel, he didn’t dare to fight it now.

Even in his top condition, he wouldn’t dare to fight such a powerful Saint-level desolate beast, let alone when he was injured so heavily.

His Kunpeng wings spread, and he shot away like a shooting star.

BOOM!

Long Chen had just fled when that black ape smashed into the cliff, blasting it apart.

Countless rays of divine light shot out of the cliff like a firework. Seeing this scene, Long Chen’s eyes almost popped out of their sockets.

“It is a Saint-level immortal metal deposit!”

No wonder the cliff was so tough—it harbored a deposit of Saint-level ores within. While Long Chen lacked the knowledge to distinguish various ores, the aura alone suggested that it was a priceless treasure.

At this time, the black ape opened its mouth. The world darkened as a blood-colored sphere appeared in its mouth.

When that sphere was pointed at Long Chen, he suddenly found that he couldn’t move. The entire world seemed to freeze around him.

The black ape was so powerful that it could control this entire space. Here, Long Chen became nothing more than a live target.

BOOM!

The blood-colored sphere shot toward Long Chen. With nowhere for him to run, he could only face it head-on.

However, if he were to block the attack of a Saint-level desolate beast, it would be no different than courting death.

Long Chen was about to summon the Earth Cauldron. While the Earth Cauldron was invincible against physical attacks, against divine abilities, its effect was not that good. Long Chen didn’t know if he could block this attack.

Unexpectedly, Lei Linger flew out of the primal chaos space and summoned a lightning sea around her.

“Big Brother Long Chen, leave this to me!”

Suddenly, Long Chen switched places with Lei Linger.

“Lei Linger!” Long Chen cried out. Just then, Lei Linger was blasted to bits by that sphere. Even someone as powerful as Lei Linger was unable to endure the attack of a Saint-level desolate beast.

“Don’t worry, I won’t die!”

Within the sea of lightning, Lei Linger’s figure recondensed. It went without saying that she was truly powerful. She was safe and sound.

“Let’s run!” Huo Linger also appeared. Along with Long Chen, they were staring nervously at that black ape.

“We can’t run. It’s already locked onto me. All we can do is kill it!”DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

Long Chen gritted his teeth, and a ruthless light appeared in his eyes.
