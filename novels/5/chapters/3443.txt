Chapter 3432 Destroying the Divine Lord Immortal Realm

The eighth prince, Wu Ying, and the others summoned their manifestations and activated their bloodlines. As a result, pillars of light soared into the heavens. Thereafter, they took out their weapons and charged at Long Chen.

They had been waiting a long time for this moment, as they wanted Long Chen’s Heavenly Dao mark. So, they instantly launched a thunderous attack.

Sixteen peak experts attacked at once, and their combined forces caused the entire Divine Lord Immortal Realm to shake. Even a World King wouldn’t dare to receive their attacks.

In front of their all-out attacks, Long Chen raised his head and roared. His dragon scales shone brightly. As divine light poured into his fist, he unleashed a single punch.

What the eighth prince and the others didn’t expect was that Lei Yuner had also joined in and her lightning spear stabbed toward Long Chen.

Suddenly, the void shuddered and a screen of light appeared between the two sides. It was like a giant mirror, and it had one hundred and eight bone fragments embedded on it.

Every bone fragment contained a rune. Seeing this scene, the hall master cried out in shock.

“Impossible!”

Those bone fragments were the core formation of the Divine Lord Immortal Realm. When just a single one was exposed, he had been worried enough. Now, so many had appeared. If they were crushed, the entire formation would be destroyed. In fact, even the entire Auspicious Cloud Prefecture would be wiped out.

The core of the formation had been taken out. Just who in the world possessed that ability?

BOOM!

Long Chen, Lei Yuner, the eighth prince, Wu Ying, and the others’ attacks all smashed into the mirror. The mirror quivered after receiving all their attacks.

Following that, cracks covered the bone fragments, and the mirror suddenly shattered.

The eighth prince and the others were dumbfounded. They didn’t know what was going on. If this mirror was Long Chen’s, he wouldn’t have attacked it, no?

“I have accomplished my mission. I’m going to start a slaughter now,” said Long Chen, looking at the broken mirror.

Everything had gone according to plan. The core of the Divine Lord Immortal Realm had to be destroyed. However, it couldn’t be destroyed with just one person’s power, or the energy imbalance would cause the energy of the Integral Heaven Star-Field’s core that had been extracted to this place to explode. Even the protector spirit couldn’t control such an explosion.

That was why Long Chen needed to borrow the power of many people. Adding on the cooperation of the protector spirit, the core of the formation was smoothly destroyed. Thereafter, she regained her freedom.

“Thank you. I know I can’t advise you, but I definitely will not go back on my word. Don’t worry about that.” The woman’s voice rang out once more.

Just as she said this, space twisted and the world collapsed. Everyone was shocked to find that they couldn’t move.

The experts in the plaza were horrified. They saw cracks cover the formation. And from the cracks, waves of destructive aura came through.

“Run!”

It was unknown who shouted first, but there was no need for this shout. Everyone already fled like they had seen a ghost. The World Kings ran faster than anyone else.

They sensed death from the broken formation. The Divine Lord Immortal Realm was about to break, and Long Chen and the others were about to appear before them again. To make things worse, the heavenly tribulation would follow him.

If they hadn’t escaped the range of the heavenly tribulation by then, once it locked onto them, this tribulation would become a World King’s tribulation. Ignoring whether or not they could endure that, everyone below the World King realm would be instantly killed.

Furthermore, the aura of death coming from this heavenly tribulation was even more terrifying than their tribulations back in the day. It was truly ominous. It was these old fellows that had lived the longest that were most afraid of death.

The race leaders directly summoned their true forms and brought their people away. At this moment, the advantage of the flying beast race was revealed. The Lightning Falcon race was the fastest, and they instantly fled out of the Auspicious Cloud Prefecture City.

Just then, the barrier around the plaza exploded. As a result, a terrifying power ravaged the surroundings, and countless buildings were destroyed.

Lightning flowed like seawater, filling the world with destructive aura. To make things worse, astral winds ravaged the earth, and black tribulation clouds rapidly spread across the heavens. The entire Auspicious Cloud Prefecture was covered by them.

Those World Kings felt a burst of fear. Fortunately, they had fled quickly. Only now that they personally sensed the heavenly tribulation’s aura did they understand just how terrifying it was.

“This is no heavenly tribulation! This is heavenly punishment!” A World King cried out in shock. This heavenly tribulation was entirely destructive power without the slightest trace of life energy.

“The Auspicious Cloud Trading Company!”

Another startled cry rang out. The heavenly tribulation had destroyed the Auspicious Cloud Trading Company. People’s expressions contorted in pain just thinking about the countless treasures inside.

However, it wasn’t just the Auspicious Cloud Trading Company. Countless buildings were also destroyed by the black lightning swords. The black swords were incomparably sharp and cut through the buildings like mud. Furthermore, this place had been peaceful for too long. The runes on those buildings were for extending the lifespan on the buildings, not increasing their defensive power. It was because no one dared to run amok here.

Thus, the entire Auspicious Cloud Prefecture collapsed like an earthen tile. Even the demonic beasts felt aggrieved as they watched this, let alone the Sacred Pill Hall’s people.

At this moment, the void exploded. Long Chen and the others appeared at the heart of the heavenly tribulation. Long Chen then looked up at the sky and coldly said, “What a familiar feeling.”

The Divine Lord Immortal Realm had been destroyed, so they were sent back out to the Auspicious Cloud Prefecture. When they came out, the heavenly tribulation’s aura also changed. To Long Chen, the previous heavenly tribulation was like calm lake water, warm and peaceful.

But now, it was a raging sea, and its huge waves contained destructive power. It was truly the heavenly tribulation that he knew.

The Divine Lord Immortal Realm had had a supreme grand formation controlling it. Now that it had been destroyed, the heavenly tribulation returned to its normal appearance.

As for the Sacred Pill Hall’s grand formation that had locked down the entire Auspicious Cloud Prefecture, due to the people fleeing, they had to shut it down.

Once they fled, the heavenly tribulation erupted and they were no longer able to activate it. So, they could only watch as the work of millions of years was destroyed just like this. The hearts of the Sacred Pill Hall’s people were dripping with blood.

“Kill Long Chen! Whoever kills him will have their entire race be blessed with free medicinal pills from the Sacred Pill Hall for their lifetime!” shouted the hall master.

Hearing that, everyone was moved. It had to be known that the greatest expense of every race was medicinal pills. Now, anyone who killed Long Chen would get a lifetime supply of pills? This offer was truly attractive.

However, in the heavenly tribulation, there were only eighteen people. Other than the eighth prince, Wu Ying, and the others, there were only Lei Yuner and Long Chen.𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

“Yuner, as the race leader, I order you to not participate in their battle!” shouted the leader of the Lightning Falcon race.
