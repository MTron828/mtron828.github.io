Chapter 3825 Main Tomb

This half-beast was smacked to the ground by Mo Nian’s shovel, but its body was so tough that it wasn’t injured at all. After rolling a bit, it jumped back up.

“Don’t be afraid, it’s being controlled by this group of tricksters!” said Long Chen hastily.

With that, Mo Nian looked through Long Chen’s vision to see that there was a lifeform of the Ghost Dao inside of this half-beast’s body. It had actually entered this corpse.

“What? They have this ability?” Mo Nian was shocked.nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

Just then, the half-beast’s warhammer clattered to the ground. These Ghost Dao lifeforms were listening to the orders of the little fellow on Long Chen’s shoulder, so they gathered weapons according to Long Chen’s wishes.

“A perfectly preserved World Domain divine item! Its runes are also runes of the immemorial era with its core energy intact. Those treasures we obtained outside can’t even compare to this!” Guo Ran held the warhammer with delight.

“The forging and inscription arts of that era are completely different from ours. We can clearly see a glimpse into the past with this. This will greatly benefit our research of immemorial forging arts!” exclaimed Xia Chen.

The World Domain divine items that they had found in the outer region of the tomb were already badly damaged due to how much time had passed. Hence, it was difficult to tell what kind of forging arts had gone into their making.

At this time, more corpses began to move. The Ghost Dao lifeforms were entering the corpses and gathering their weapons and battle armor.

Seeing this, Guo Ran and Xia Chen were incredibly delighted. The battle spoils were all gathered, and they prepared to properly research them.

From over ten thousand corpses, they received more than three thousand weapons and two hundred battle armor, as well as some other divine items.

“Hey, lower your head. Stick out your horns.” Guo Ran picked up a hammer and called out to one of the Ghost Dao lifeforms working.

That lifeform was in control of a bull-headed half-beast. The half-beast possessed no weapon, but its horns had been noticed by Guo Ran.

The horns had golden runes on them. Although countless years had passed, those horns were still shining brightly and gave off immense pressure.

The Ghost Dao lifeform was very obedient. It lowered its head and simply allowed Guo Ran to repeatedly smash his hammer on the half-beast’s horn. It took over ten blows of all Guo Ran’s power before one of the horns broke off.

This half-beast’s physical body was shockingly powerful. Guo Ran’s Supreme Bone was actually sore from the chore, and his hand was bleeding. Only then did he manage to take off one horn.

Looking at the golden runes covering the horn, as well as the heart-palpitating aura flowing around it, Guo Ran almost began to drool.

“This is something good. Those runes should be an innate formation. As long as you find the entry point, you can unleash its divine abilities. If you stick this onto your helmet, you’ll appear flashy, and it will have a practical use. It’s practically perfect for you.” Xia Chen examined the horn closely and gave his evaluation. This horn had runes even on the outside, so it was definitely a rare treasure.

“Hehe, good brother, you really understand me.” Guo Ran laughed and was already placing that horn on his helmet, gesturing. Just as Xia Chen said, with this golden horn on his helmet, Guo Ran instantly appeared awe-inspiring. The style of his entire battle armor looked different now, as it was filled with a murderous and terrifying air.

Guo Ran and Xia Chen got to work, directing the Ghost Dao lifeforms to gather all the treasures here. In the end, they took them all.

The only regretful thing was that these lifeforms were only able to control these corpses in a very rudimentary fashion. They could not unleash their combat power.

Otherwise, if Long Chen could lead such a powerful army, just how amazing would that be? The other thing was that these Ghost Dao lifeforms didn’t actually possess much energy. The time that they could control these corpses was limited. Moreover, controlling such a huge body put quite a burden on it. So, after a bit, they had to stop and take a rest.

Xia Chen and Guo Ran eyed the treasures here. As for Long Chen, Mo Nian, and Yue Xiaoqian, they were studying the small clumps of black qi on the foreheads of these corpses.

Suddenly, the little fellow on Long Chen’s shoulder spoke again, seemingly understanding what Long Chen was studying.

“It’s saying that this black qi is what protects their body from decay. These Ghost Dao lifeforms also rely on absorbing this black qi to survive. When they have nothing to do, they come here and eat this black qi. They also ask you not to break these corpses,” said Long Chen.

“How strange. This heavenly tomb’s arrangement isn’t the same as the legends say. Furthermore, the arrangement of these corpses also doesn’t make sense. This is a bit outside my area of expertise,” said Mo Nian, shaking his head.

Long Chen and Yue Xiaoqian exchanged a look. This fellow really did like to show off. If he didn’t understand, then he should just say he didn’t understand. He kept acting like everything was within a small gap in his learning. What kind of gap was that big?

“Mo Nian, do you not feel like this so-called heavenly tomb is a conspiracy?” asked Long Chen.

“A conspiracy? You mean… That’s impossible…!” Mo Nian was startled. He understood what Long Chen was saying, but he didn’t dare to believe it. “The heavenly tomb is supposed to be built because of the will of the heavens… Theoretically…”

“But I have many suspicions. Something is wrong. We should go slowly. If we really can’t see anything, we’ll try asking this little fellow,” said Long Chen. He kept having a feeling that there was something off about this heavenly tomb.

The black qi on the foreheads of these corpses also felt wrong. It was like they were touching something extremely dangerous.

This cave gave him the same feeling as the pit that he had found deep within the mortal world’s Devil Spirit Mountain. It made him also think of the giant skull beneath the Immemorial Path bound by five golden chains. In the end, there were also the endless stars covered in chains that he had seen through the dragon expert’s eyes. It was a very bad feeling.

Once they gathered everything, the Ghost Dao lifeforms continued to lead the way. They entered the next tomb cave. With them leading the way, everything went very smoothly.

They went through over ten such rooms and gathered countless treasures. Xia Chen and Guo Ran were about to go crazy.

Xia Chen found a record relating to runes inside the spatial ring of one of those corpses. Some of the immemorial era’s runes were explained in it, so that was a huge treasure to him.

On the other hand, Long Chen, Mo Nian, and Yue Xiaoqian didn’t gain anything because the so-called treasures were unable to interest them. They only left the treasures to Guo Ran and Xia Chen to deal with.

“Three threes is nine, two nines is eighteen. In other words, all the rooms on this side have been fully explored. The heart of the tomb is up ahead,” said Mo Nian. He was constantly looking at his map.

There was now a giant passageway ahead of them, one that was ten thousand miles wide. It was practically an entire world of its own. Although the other end of the passageway was deathly silent, looking at it caused their souls to hurt.

Long Chen opened his hand. Seeing that the hairpin’s needle was pointing straight toward the end of the passageway, he took a deep breath.

“Let’s go. The greatest secret should be hidden within this main tomb.”
