Chapter 3991 Long Chen’s Mission

“Imperial Father, this child was unfilial and has embarrassed you in front of everyone. I’ve lost the face of the royal family. Please punish me.”

Once the diplomatic emissaries left, Crown Prince Zhu Yunwen suddenly walked over and kowtowed shamefully.

Following that, the other princes and princesses were overcome by guilt and shame and kowtowed as well.

This time, their display was far too embarrassing. Before this, they had thought that they were above others.

However, with this one competition, they learned just how cruel reality was. They had always been living in a dream that they weaved for themselves. In front of true experts, they were nothing.

Zhu Yifeng in particular was clenching his teeth, his eyes red. All of them awaited punishment.

However, to their surprise, Yu Xiaoyun smiled kindly.

“Your display today was good. I am gratified!”

“Imperial father…!”

All the princes and princesses were shocked. In all their memories, Yu Xiaoyun had always been extremely strict and harsh with them. They couldn't recall a single instance when he had spoken to them with such a gentle expression.

Moreover, they had all been defeated today, which was a huge humiliation as they had lost the face of the imperial family. But rather than punishing them, Yu Xiaoyun was comforting them? They were completely bewildered. They even wondered whether he was saying the opposite of what he thought for some reason. Thus, not one of them dared to speak.

Xu Xiaoyun slowly stood and walked over to them, personally lifting them up one by one. There was a rare smile on his face.

“You are all my good sons and daughters, good models for the Vermilion Bird Empire. However, being born in the imperial family is your misfortune. You do not have the freedom of the commoners or the warmth of family. Also, you have to endure more and race as if your life's on the line right from the start. I know that you’re all tired, that you’ve all had it hard. I have seen everything. In truth, I feel bad for you. I wish I could be like a normal father and dote on my children, to watch you grow without looking for any results. I wish I could sit in front of a house and watch as my children played…”

“Imperial father…”Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

This was their first time feeling the warmth of fatherly love from Yu Xiaoyun. Hence, these princes and princesses’ eyes all reddened.

“However, I cannot. In this world,many things are already predetermined. From the moment you were born, you had to carry your own mission. We are the heirs of the Vermilion Bird Empire, the successors of the Jiuli bloodline. It is fated that we cannot just be ordinary side characters. Thus, we can only demand far more from ourselves. The Vermilion Bird Empire has millions and millions of commoners who entrust their lives to us. Thus, the burden on our shoulders does not permit us to slack off in the slightest. The humiliation given to you from the battles today has shown you the difference. You know where you are lacking now, and this makes you feel ashamed. But what I saw was that you were willing to die on the martial stage despite knowing that you couldn’t beat your opponent, that you were still driven by honor in the face of death. I saw the pride of the Vermilion Bird in you. I saw the nobility of the Jiuli bloodline. A temporary defeat means nothing. Use this shame to drive yourselves onward. That is the most important thing. Children, rise. Today, I’ll accompany you to drink until we collapse, hahaha!” Yu Xiaoyun laughed, his voice full of satisfaction and gratification.

The princes and princesses were moved, feeling ashamed. They returned to their seats, but the pain in their hearts didn’t allow them to drink.

“Long Chen…” Yu Xiaoyun turned to Long Chen.

“Does His Majesty have some grand reward for me for my contributions today? I don’t need anything. Just betroth Princess Qingxuan to me and that will be all!” Long Chen smiled and struck while Yu Xiaoyun’s mood was good.

“Your contributions?! You want a reward?! You almost ruined my plans today! Not beating you is already a good thing for you!” snorted Yu Xiaoyun.

Long Chen was about to casually retort when a flash of comprehension struck him. He suddenly glanced at Jiang Huixin and Xu Lanxin, seeming to have grasped something.

When Yu Xiaoyun, Jiang Huixin, and Xu Lanxin saw that expression, their hearts shook. Had this fellow really seen through their plan? How could that be?

“No matter what, I didn’t lose face for the Vermilion Bird Empire, right? Let us just treat it as reward and punishment canceling each other out. I won’t take any reward, and I won’t accept any punishment. We can count as even,” said Long Chen.

“Hmph, a nice thought. I heard that you have some fine wine, cough cough… Do you really need me to continue?” said Yu Xiaoyun.

Long Chen was speechless. Was the emperor really so shameless?

However, his father-in-law had spoken, so Long Chen naturally wouldn’t be stingy. He brought out hundreds of jugs of fine wine from the Wine God Palace. It was many times better than the wine that the imperial family normally enjoyed.

The fragrance alone was enough to intoxicate them, to make them forget about their grievances. After that, Yu Xiaoyun raised his cup to everyone and drank three cups in a row, quickly settling the awkward atmosphere with wine.

“Imperial Father, this time, the eight empires…” Seeing that the emperor was in an excellent mood today, Zhu Yunwen was so brazen as to ask a question.

However, Yu Xiaoyun waved his hand, stopping him. “The state banquet today has become a family meal. Let’s not talk about matters of the empire. Everything is under control. Children, there’s no need to worry about it.”

After he said that, the atmosphere relaxed a great deal. Seeing him in such a good mood, Zhu Yifeng was so bold as to ask to be excused. After all, he wanted to see his mother, so he left.

“Brother Long, I didn’t know my own power when we first met at the city gates. I apologize for any offense I’ve given you. If I have a chance, I hope I can get some pointers from brother Long.” The Crown Prince raised his cup and walked over to Long Chen, speaking respectfully to him.

This action instantly drew everyone’s attention. The princes and princesses were all amazed by Long Chen’s sharp attacks, quick reactions, agile movement art, and exquisite techniques.

Even though they were all in the Immortal King realm, Long Chen was far stronger than them. Even someone as powerful as Weng Tianyao didn’t have any chance to retaliate in front of him. Furthermore, he had even handled three-flower Earth Venerates with ease, looking down on the experts of eight empires. Just how domineering and arrogant was that?

If they had half of Long Chen’s abilities, then they wouldn’t have lost so much face today. Thus, when the Crown Prince went over, they all raised their cups to Long Chen to express their respect.

“You’re too courteous. We’re all family, so don’t talk like an outsider. Here, cheers!” Long Chen laughed and touched his cup to Zhu Yunwen’s. He naturally wouldn’t let such minor matters weigh on him.

Seeing him be so straightforward, the princes and princesses were delighted. They all toasted to Long Chen. It wasn’t long before people started collapsing as the Wine God Palace’s wine was very powerful.

After drinking about enough, Yu Xiaoyun stood. “Today’s family feast can end here. Long Chen, I have a mission for you! Tomorrow, take a trip to the Philosopher Institute.”

Long Chen was startled. “Have you thought this through? If I go, perhaps the Philosopher Institute will be torn down!”

“Up to you!”

Yu Xiaoyun only left behind three thought-provoking words before turning around and leaving.
