Chapter 4675 Virtue and Fortitude

A lightning spear pierced through Long Chen, stunning all the experts present.

“Boss!”

The Dragonblood warriors cried out in shock. How could their boss succumb to a single blow?

Even Luo Changsheng, Yin Jiushang, and the others had not expected the Sovereign clan expert’s attack to be so fast. It happened so swiftly that there was no opportunity to dodge.

Suddenly, a clear sound reverberated through the air, and people were shocked to see only half of the spear in the Sovereign clan expert’s hand. The other half was embedded in Long Chen’s chest.

As the half of the lightning spear slowly diminished, it was absorbed by Long Chen. Even Long Chen himself was shocked, let alone the onlookers. The moment he was struck, he thought he was doomed. But unexpectedly, this thunderforce was unable to harm him.

His Scarlet Dragon Battle Armor was like a bloodthirsty beast, while the thunderforce of this tribulation was like the most appetizing flesh and blood to it. If it weren’t for the Sovereign clan expert calling it back, the entire spear would have been absorbed by him.

“I see. The Scarlet Dragon Battle Armor’s slaughter will has merged with your own slaughter will. Every scale on you has accumulated an incalculable amount of resentment from the dead, which comes from all the lifeforms that you’ve killed. They’ve finally found a place to attach to. Now that this resentment has been ignited, it will absorb all energies that will strengthen them. You should be careful. They were killed by you, so they definitely won’t be willing to listen to your orders. Once they grow to a certain extent, they will devour your soul,” warned the Sovereign clan expert.

The sacred Sovereign clan’s ancestral dragon used this technique to see what the problem was, and he was shocked.

The Sovereign clan’s scarlet dragon also underwent a trial by fire of slaughter. Naturally, every dragon would accumulate resentment from the lifeforms they killed, but it would never affect the shape and color of their scales.

Long Chen’s Scarlet Dragon Battle Armor, however, was so red that it was turning black. Its shape had also undergone a transformation, indicating an unimaginable number of lives extinguished by Long Chen’s hands. Furthermore, the only ones capable of leaving their resentful spirits on Long Chen had to at least be in the same realm as him.

Hence, the Sovereign clan expert really wanted to ask just how many lifeforms Long Chen had slain. Yet, even if he asked, it would be futile. From the Martial Heaven Continent to the immortal world, Long Chen had fought countless battles, so how would he know the numbers?

“I’m not afraid. I have always conducted myself in an open and candid manner. My heart, my conscience is clear. I feel no guilt toward the heavens, the earth, others, or myself. When they were alive, I killed them. Now that they’re dead, I will still suppress them. They want to devour me? That grand ambition of theirs will never be realized. Hehe, how interesting. All their resentful spirits are with me? Doesn’t that mean they’ll forever be with me?” asked Long Chen.

“That is correct. They will haunt you until the day you die,” replied the Sovereign clan expert solemnly.

“Hahaha, that’s excellent!” Long Chen suddenly laughed.

The Sovereign clan expert was baffled. Anyone would feel fear and anxiety upon learning that they were haunted by resentful spirits. But Long Chen was happy? Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

“Why are you laughing?” he asked.

“Now I’m at ease. So when I kill them, their resentful spirits adhere to me? So they don’t go to the underworld or enter reincarnation? In other words, as long as I don’t die, they will never reincarnate and never be able to harm more people, right? Isn’t that a good thing? If I work harder, I can kill even more of them, and this world will eventually become a peaceful one, hahaha!” Long Chen felt delighted.

Long Chen was truly excited inside. The Sovereign clan expert’s words gave him hope. After seeing this world, he realized that there were far too many bad people, so many in fact that he couldn’t even kill them all.

However, now he saw a new goal. As long as he worked hard, he could kill the world’s evil people to the very last. To eliminate evil from the root, wasn’t that a good thing?

“Such virtue and fortitude... no wonder you won His Majesty’s favor!” The Sovereign clan expert nodded, his lightning spear returning to its original appearance. “Well, there’s not that much time. The power of the heavenly tribulation will not last forever. Let us have a real battle today!”

BOOM!

At this moment, the void beneath his feet exploded. As a dragon cry rang out, his spear howled as well.

“Sovereign Dragon Piercer!”

This time, his attack wasn’t fast. But the void as far as the eye could see twisted, forming a strange hollow. It was like the world was on the verge of collapse.

“Cloud Dragon Immolation Claw!”

Long Chen didn’t dare to hesitate and directly summoned his divine ring. A blood-colored dragon claw then stretched out of it, grasping the lightning spear.

BOOM!

It was like two worlds colliding. The void erupted in a violent explosion, tearing the very fabric of the sky apart. The impact sent both Long Chen and the Sovereign clan expert flying. The space behind them collapsed, forming a giant black hole that threatened to devour everything.

“It’s the gate to the ninth heaven!”

Suddenly, a startled cry rang out from outside of the tribulation. At this moment, people realized that with this attack, the spatial gate in the distance had suddenly grown much clearer.

“Could it be that this person is the real chosen one of the heavens?”

Suddenly struck by a thought, all these experts looked at the Sovereign clan expert.

Previously, this gate was extremely vague, looking like it wasn’t even there. But after the Sovereign clan expert appeared, it started to grow distinct, and after he attacked, the gate grew much clearer.

“He’s the real chosen one! Anyone who defeats him can open the gate and become the new son of the nine heavens!” Luo Changsheng shouted. Hearing this, everyone within the heavenly tribulation was looking at the Sovereign clan expert with a greedy light in their eyes.

“We can’t let Long Chen defeat him! Otherwise, once he obtains the recognition of the ninth heaven, he will have an undying body and exist as long as the ninth heaven!” exclaimed Luo Changsheng as he shot at the Sovereign clan expert.

“Scram! What crap is this son of the nine heavens? Do you think the great dragon race cares about some son of the nine heavens?! You are blaspheming the dragon race!” The Sovereign clan expert was enraged. These people actually called him the son of the nine heavens?

The dragon race had always disliked the bindings of the Heavenly Daos, especially the true dragon race. They existed to break the restrictions of the Heavenly Daos and live a life of freedom beyond the nine heavens. How could someone as prideful as them consider the heavens as their father?

BOOM!

The spear of the Sovereign clan expert swung through the air, bringing forth some lightning that sent Luo Changsheng flying, blood spraying out of his mouth.

At this moment, the other experts within the tribulation also charged at the Sovereign clan expert. After Luo Changsheng and the Sovereign clan expert exchanged blows, they saw lightning jump from the Sovereign clan expert onto Luo Changsheng, a sign that Luo Changsheng had absorbed a bit of the lightning energy.

In their minds, the person who could obtain the most thunderforce from the Sovereign clan expert would become the chosen one of the heavens.

“Attack!”

The experts within the tribulation went crazy, unleashing their full power against the Sovereign clan expert.
