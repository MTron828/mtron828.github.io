Chapter 2430 Turn the Tables

Translator: BornToBe

The knowledge of existences known as Sovereign sprouts had spread throughout the continent thanks to Feng Fei’s descent.

A Sovereign sprout was someone with a chance of becoming a Sovereign. Even if they didn’t become a Sovereign, as long as they didn’t die, they would definitely reach the realm of Emperors.

Mo Nian had inherited a Nethergod’s mortal husk and absorbed the energy within the divine pool. All the experience that Hong Yaoyang had before becoming a god and all his peak techniques were in Mo Nian’s possession.

It could be said that the current Mo Nian possessed a terrifying power. However, he couldn’t instantly master all those techniques. He needed to gradually grow accustomed to them before being able to unleash his full potential.

Hearing that this mysterious man could be a Sovereign sprout, Mo Nian was startled, but he also had an urge to fight. He had the combat experience of a Nethergod, which was enough for him to be arrogant.

“Long Chen, leave him to me. I want to test him myself.” Mo Nian’s eyes blazed with a desire for combat.

He never had the justification to fight Feng Fei, so he had never had a chance to fight someone on that level. But this mysterious man was from the Corrupt path. He didn’t need an excuse to fight him.

Mo Nian knew Long Chen’s intent was to avoid extra casualties by immediately eliminating this man as a threat, but he wanted to fight him by himself.

Long Chen was hesitant. Once they entered the Star Field Divine World, if this fellow were to hunt down the Righteous disciples, then other than he and Mo Nian, no one would be able to stop him.

He hoped to eliminate him now to remove this threat, but since Mo Nian wanted to test his power, he was caught in an awkward position.

Just at this moment, a beautiful carriage broke through the void and appeared in front of everyone.

“It’s Feng Fei!” This carriage was well known to be Feng Fei’s carriage. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

“How regretful.” In the distance, a muscular horned man spat on the ground irritably.

This person was the prince of the Six Horn Sea Serpent race who had fought against Long Chen over the largest qi flow stream during the qi flow eruption. Long Chen had beaten him and made him flee.

When the sea demon race had later tried to cause trouble for him, Long Chen had poisoned the Martial Heaven Sea-Ring, forcing the sea demon race to lower their heads to him.

At that time, he had even made conditions for their surrender, ordering them to break Dongfang Yuyang’s legs. The sea demon race really had followed his orders and given a beating to Dongfang Yuyang, which had raised quite a fuss at the time.

However, after that matter, the sea demon race had fallen silent. They only resurfaced now that the Star Field Divine World was opening.

Not only were they participating, but they also had one million five hundred thousand experts. They were the ones who had brought the most people.

The sea demons found beneath the sea were more numerous than the lifeforms on the continent. This time, they had brought out all their elites. Every one of them could be considered a true expert.

Due to not having a good relationship with the races on the land, they were standing in their own region at one of the edges.

When the prince saw Long Chen and the Corrupt path about to start fighting, he got excited. But now that Feng Fei had come, this battle would definitely be stopped.

It wasn’t just the sea demon race that was disappointed by this. The ancient family alliance’s people were the same, especially Di Feng.

Feng Fei’s carriage was surrounded by her bodyguards and attendants. They opened the door, and the beautiful and icy Feng Fei walked out.

She looked over at the crowd. Upon spotting Long Chen, her eyes brightened ever so slightly. She nodded toward him. “It seems your recovery went well. You even have the energy to stir up trouble. Very good, very good.”

Her voice was emotionless. The two very goods that she said made some people wonder what she meant.

Last time, Long Chen and Feng Fei had fought with their Spiritual Strength, resulting in both sides being injured. Therefore, Long Chen’s reputation had risen throughout the entire continent.

After being injured, Feng Fei had said that they would have another competition once they both recovered. It was unknown whether Feng Fei’s words indicated that they might fight right now.

“Where did you see me stirring up trouble? You just give verdicts without knowing what happened? Calling you stupid is really not wrong,” sneered Long Chen.

Long Chen hated Feng Fei’s arrogance. It was as if she thought that whatever she said was right, and others couldn’t argue. As soon as she arrived, she labeled him a troublemaker.

“Long Chen, you really are brazen!” shouted one of the attendants furiously.

“Fuck, can you not change your phrases? I feel my ears rotting from hearing the same thing over and over and over again. Did your teacher never teach you any other words?” Long Chen looked at that bodyguard. It seemed that he had a rather special status amongst the bodyguards, as he was always the one to speak.

Every time he did speak, he never said anything new. If it weren’t for the distance between them, Long Chen would definitely slap him.

“You…!” That bodyguard was actually the strongest amongst Feng Fei’s bodyguards, and he was even further enraged.

Feng Fei raised a hand, cutting him off. Looking at Long Chen, she said, “Words are meaningless. We will have a battle sooner or later. Hopefully, you can find some miraculous encounters inside the Star Field Divine World, or it would be too boring.”

Long Chen shook his head, not even feeling an urge to speak to this woman.

“Feng Fei, why are you targeting my brother so much? Have you fallen for him?” asked Mo Nian suddenly, looking from Feng Fei to Long Chen with a sudden realization.

Long Chen twitched with a desire to slap Mo Nian. This fellow really was cut from the same cloth as Guo Ran. He conned him just the same. Meng Qi and the others were standing right there.

“Bastard!”

“Shut up!”

“You dare to blaspheme senior Feng Fei?!”

“Someone like you should be tossed into the tongue-ripping hell.”

Feng Fei turned pale from rage. She clenched her fists, never having been insulted like this in her life. She was so enraged that she couldn’t speak, but her attendants took her place.

As if not seeing Feng Fei’s killing intent or Long Chen’s furious gaze, Mo Nian laughed, “Don’t be embarrassed, it’s far too normal for men to have multiple wives in this day and age. Who doesn’t want to go around hugging girls left and right-”

Suddenly, a gong appeared and struck Mo Nian in the back of his head. The clanging sound made everyone jump.

Mo Nian had been in the midst of rattling when that gong struck him. His head was ringing. He furiously demanded, “Who hit me-”

However, Mo Nian instantly deflated upon seeing who had hit him. He awkwardly said, “Zongying, what’s wrong?”

“What’s wrong? You also want to be like a certain womanizer? Having multiple wives is normal, so you’re not normal? You want to go around hugging girls left and right? Speak, who are you planning on hugging? What, am I not enough for you? Tell me who you’re planning on hugging!” Liu Zongying began banging the gong on Mo Nian’s head, dumbfounding people.

As Mo Nian protected his head, he just allowed her to hit him. “I was talking about Long Chen!”

“You were talking about him, but are you saying that you never thought about it yourself? You’re pretty envious, huh? You’re jealous of him!”

The sight of Mo Nian being scolded by a woman, who had clearly just entered the Netherpassage realm and had a weak aura, was startling and funny to the various experts present.

“You deserve it.” Long Chen clapped. Retribution had finally come. Who had asked Mo Nian to con him? Now, he ended up having conned himself.

Feng Fei and the others also looked at Mo Nian oddly, not knowing how to react to this.

“Dear wife, there’s so many people here. Give me some face. If you want to hit me, wait until we’re home and there’s no one around,” implored Mo Nian.

“Hmph.” Liu Zongying snorted and turned away, temporarily letting Mo Nian off.

Upon seeing Long Chen’s satisfied smile, Liu Zongying walked over to Tang Wan-er. She handed the deformed gong to her. “You can’t indulge men. If you can get past things, then get past them. If you can’t, turn the tables on them.”

Long Chen’s expression instantly darkened. What was that supposed to mean? Tang Wan-er smiled and received the broken gong, even thanking her.

After this, Mo Nain hid in the crowd, no longer as arrogant as before.

Feng Fei took a deep breath and calmed herself. “The time has come. Everyone, follow me.”

Feng Fei took out a pitch-black object. Before they could see what it was, she made a cut with it through the air.

“A World Piercing Divine Stone. The divine families actually have an existence from legends.” Xia Chen cried out in shock.

A giant crack appeared in the void. Feng Fei walked in first, followed by everyone else.

Once they entered, they found themselves in a world completely different from the Martial Heaven Continent. Even the laws present were subtly different.

Everything was dark and dusky. It was like they were passing through a channel of spacetime. They felt their bodies twisting. Those with weaker cultivation bases were revealed.

Liu Zongying was pale, and Mo Nian reached out to support her, lessening the pressure on her.

Suddenly, the channel vanished and they appeared atop a giant platform. When they looked around, countless startled cries rang out.
