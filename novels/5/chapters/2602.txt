Chapter 2591 The Terrifying Blood fiend Devil Lord

“Even if you all fight together, so what?!”

The Blood Fiend Devil Lord let out a devilish roar. A giant eye suddenly appeared in his blood sun.

The eye popped open like an ancient beast had been awoken. After that, endless chains shot out of the blood sun, wrapping around the Blood Fiend Devil Lord and then spreading in every direction.

“Not good!” Gu Yang and the others let out startled cries. That energy was not something a human could fight against. Those chains contained the energy of an entire world.

BOOM!

Their attacks were blasted apart, and every one of them coughed up blood.

“Blood Sun Illuminates the World, Blood Dragons Devour the Heavens!”

The Blood Fiend Devil Lord’s Blood Qi ignited, and his power erupted like a volcano. The chains transformed into blood dragons that attacked Meng Qi and the others. Taking advantage of when they were injured, he intended to wipe them all out.

“Dragonblood Cross Slash!” Just as the dragons flew out, Guo Ran slashed his sabers. Dragon roars resounded throughout the world. This was the concentrated power of all the Dragonblood warriors.

A giant cross wreaked havoc through the void as it shot toward the Blood Fiend Devil Lord. Fragments of spacetime flew through the air.

The Blood Fiend Devil Lord’s expression changed. He had actually forgotten about Guo Ran. This fellow he had viewed as insignificant was unleashing such a powerful attack at this critical moment.

Right now, his chains had only just scattered, and he didn’t have time to pull them back for offense. Hence, his energy poured into the golden halberd.

BOOM!

With no other choice, the Blood Fiend Devil Lord was forced to receive Guo Ran’s attack. Huge waves erupted in the void, spreading throughout the entire battlefield.

Guo Ran’s body trembled, and he coughed up a mouthful of blood. As for the Blood Fiend Devil Lord, he was forced back several steps, every step causing the land to collapse.

In the end, he couldn’t stop himself from spitting out a mouthful of blood. He was injured. Even his blood sun dimmed slightly, and the eye within it vanished.

Just as he spat out blood, a dagger silently appeared behind him, stabbing toward his heart.

“Courting death!” the Blood Fiend Devil Lord roared furiously. The runes on his body suddenly flew out.

Dong Mingyu’s figure was revealed, and she was sent flying by those runes. An unhealthy rosiness appeared on her face just before she vanished once more.

Just at this moment, the blood dragons that the Blood Fiend Devil Lord had sent out were met by endless willow branches. Explosions rang out as the willow branches exploded along with the blood dragons.

The towering willow instantly became bare. The stars were fully revealed as Liu Ruyan used up every last one of her branches to block the blood dragons, leaving only a trunk.

Meng Qi and the others were horrified. Liu Ruyan had been forced to use up all of her branches to block that attack. Without Liu Ruyan, they probably wouldn’t have survived it.

“Count yourselves lucky this time. The next time I step onto the Martial Heaven Continent will be a bloody baptism for your human race.” The Blood Fiend Devil Lord sneered and retreated back into the Yin Yang World.

The Martial Heaven Continent’s experts were silent. This Blood Fiend Devil Lord was absolutely terrifying. There was no way to match him.

The Dragonblood Legion was already so powerful, and yet their strongest experts were unable to beat him. His arrival cast a shadow on their hearts. He was so powerful that it invoked despair.

He had yet to even set foot into the Heaven Merging realm. Once he did, would there be anyone who could stop him?

“You should count yourself lucky. If our boss was here, you wouldn’t be leaving alive,” sneered Guo Ran, refusing to come out as the weaker party.

“Hmph, Long Chen? I’ll kill him next time. You small fry should scram. You should celebrate getting to keep your worthless lives for now,” snorted the Blood Fiend Devil Lord. With a quiver from his blood sun, the seven Sovereign sprouts hastily appeared behind him, and they all vanished.

The Blood race’s experts also left. But they didn’t forget to say such mocking and intimidating words to the Martial Heaven Continent’s side before leaving.

“How regretful. We were lacking one supreme expert. If Long Chen was here, or maybe Mo Nian, he wouldn’t be able to leave.” Dong Mingyu appeared once more, her face pale. “Guo Ran’s Dragonblood Cross Slash drained most of his energy and gave him quite the injury. He truly is powerful. I didn’t get to fully activate my god curse energy before being forced back by him, or he’d be dead. He might look powerful, but he only left because he ran out of energy. If Long Chen or Mo Nian was here stopping him, we would have had a high chance of killing him. Regretfully, Wilde is still sleeping. If he was here as well, we might have succeeded.”

Dong Mingyu was also injured, but she felt regretful that they hadn’t killed him. They had just been the slightest bit away from it.

Meng Qi smiled comfortingly and wiped some blood off of Dong Mingyu’s face. That blood belonged to the Blood Fiend Devil Lord. “The Blood Fiend Devil Lord has an entire world’s karmic luck concentrated within him, so we can’t rely on luck to kill him. He belongs to Long Chen, not us. You don’t have to feel conflicted about it. Isn’t it better to leave him to Long Chen?”

“That’s right, boss will definitely knock his teeth out!” said Guo Ran confidently.

“Hmph, if he weren’t so slippery, there would be no need for Long Chen. I would have exhausted him to death myself,” said Liu Ruyan stubbornly.

Meng Qi and Chu Yao exchanged a smile. Liu Ruyan was particularly stubborn when it came to Long Chen.

Liu Ruyan was truly powerful. If the Blood Fiend Devil Lord had continued fighting, then considering her undying body, she really might have been able to defeat him.

However, defeating him was a different concept from killing him. He wouldn’t be so foolish as to continue fighting here when he couldn’t win. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Sister Ruyan’s power truly is amazing. We got to witness the Undying race’s power. You were our main force this time,” said Meng Qi.

“That’s true. Sister Ruyan was our protector this time. You’re definitely much more reliable than Long Chen,” praised Tang Wan-er.

As expected, Liu Ruyan’s expression finally softened slightly. She had a suppressed smile like she didn’t want to smile but couldn’t help it, and it gave a much warmer feeling considering how icy she was.

“Why didn’t any peak experts come?” Only now did Guo Ran realize that not one person on the level of Mo Nian, Nangong Zuiyue, Beitang Rushuang, Hu Feng, or Yun Tian had come despite the huge disturbance.

“Do you think everyone is so bored? Most people are still in seclusion in preparation for the Heaven Merging realm. The alliance head even said that we must be prepared for this breakthrough,” said Meng Qi.

The Dragonblood Legion had only managed to fully prepare thanks to the resources provided by Long Chen. They had already reached the peak of Netherpassage.

Many experts were busy making preparations for a perfect breakthrough. However, the Dragonblood Legion didn’t need to have that thought. That was because every time they underwent seclusion, there was always Long Chen controlling it. They had always had a one hundred percent success rate at tribulation, so they had no need to worry about that.

It was only when Meng Qi mentioned it that they recalled not everyone was like them, treating tribulations as a simple affair.

After all, even Empyreans could fail a tribulation. As soon as that danger appeared, there would be nothing else that they could do. That was why they made so many preparations beforehand. They weren’t like them.

“How regretful. If more of them had come, the Blood Fiend Devil Lord wouldn’t have been able to escape so easily. He would need to leave a bit behind at least,” said Guo Ran.

His unprecedented show-off act had been disturbed by the Blood Fiend Devil Lord. He had become the main character, while Guo Ran was reduced to a secondary character, irritating him.

“Ah, I’m so stupid!” Guo Ran suddenly slapped his leg.

“What is it?” asked Gu Yang.

“It’s nothing. I should have invited some of the peak experts in advance,” said Guo Ran.

In truth, that wasn’t what he was thinking. He had just recalled how Long Chen had said that the Blood race was weak to poison. Perhaps he could have used some of his mechanisms to instantly poison the Blood Fiend Devil Lord, then they might have been able to deal a serious blow to him. In his weakened state, they would have had a chance to kill him.

However, he couldn’t say that, or he would be looked down on for forgetting such an important detail. It was better to keep this failure to himself.

“Lingshan, the Blood Fiend Devil Lord has appeared. There’s no need to have so many experts standing guard here,” said Meng Qi.

Ye Lingshan nodded. If it weren’t for the Dragonblood Legion being here, the Blood Fiend Devil Lord could have wiped out all the defenders all by himself. However, it also wasn’t possible to leave such an important defensive point unguarded.

“Leave a smaller number of people here as a formality more than anything else. The Blood race won’t be launching any large-scale attacks any time soon. Although the Blood Fiend Devil Lord has his blood sun, he can’t stay in the Martial Heaven Continent for long. Furthermore, with his status, he won’t be taking action against so few people,” said Guo Ran.

Ye Lingshan thought about it and nodded. Hence, she withdrew eighty percent of the people guarding this place.

Just as Ye Lingshan was arranging this, within a deep ravine of the Yin Yang World, the Blood Fiend Devil Lord suddenly coughed up three mouthfuls of blood, causing his seven Sovereign sprouts to jump in shock.
