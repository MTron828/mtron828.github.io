Chapter 3988 Complete Defeat

Long Chen’s voice was like thunder echoing throughout the hall, as if to make sure everyone heard him clearly. It was precisely because of this that everyone was so shocked.

The emperor and the empresses were also shocked by this statement, as even experts on their level had misjudged Weng Tianyao’s power. His thunderforce had already reached the point of returning to the true essence.

Although Weng Tianyao had not unleashed any of his true power, just the ease with which he caught a divine weapon barehanded showed that his power was unfathomable.

However, Long Chen actually dared to say that he would defeat such a genius within three moves, betting his own life on the line. Did he really have such assurance?

The princes and princesses were especially moved as Long Chen’s domineering will filled the room. They had never seen someone so domineering before.

On the other hand, Weng Tianyao was shocked and enraged as Long Chen was clearly looking down on him. Actually, he had come to wipe away his previous humiliation, but when Long Chen said that he would kill him within three moves, the fear deep within his heart was triggered.

After all, back in the three thousand worlds, he had been completely crushed, along with his confidence and pride.

Thus, when he returned to the Violet Thunderclap Empire, Weng Taibei personally brought him to a secret realm to train, which caused his power to undergo a qualitative leap. After that, when he heard that Long Chen was in the Vermilion Bird Empire, he directly came with the diplomatic envoy, wanting to fight Long Chen again and avenge his defeat.

However, this bet from Long Chen successfully triggered the fear in his heart, causing him to feel numb. This was the heart-devil that Long Chen had given him after crushing him.

“What? You don’t dare? Did your guts break after I whooped your ass in the three thousand worlds? If three moves is too many, then we can do one move. If you can last one move against me, I’ll kill myself right here and now. How’s that? Don’t tell me that you still don’t dare,” said Long Chen coldly.

“One move?!”

Everyone’s eyes almost popped out upon hearing this. Had Long Chen gone crazy? Killing Weng Tianyao in one move?

“You are courting death! I-”

“Silence.” Just as Weng Tianyao was unable to endure it anymore and wanted to agree, the elder beside him stopped him. “This is a friendly exchange of pointers, so how can it be turned into a personal duel for selfish reasons? Yao-er, it was wrong of you to lose control and injure someone. Hurry and apologize to His Majesty.”

Weng Tianyao seemed afraid of this elder. Although he didn’t know why the elder would do this, he still bowed to the emperor and said some nonsense about how it was an accident. However, everyone knew that it was a big fat lie.

The elder then turned to Long Chen and indifferently said, “You are nothing more than a commoner, so you should take note of your status. In this place, the Vermilion Bird Empire can protect you. But once you leave the empire, you are nothing. Since you’re here taking asylum, you should know how to tuck your tail in and be an obedient dog.”

That provocation actually made Long Chen smile. “It’s true, compared to yourselves, I don’t have the experience of acting like a dog for a lifetime. I wouldn’t dare to compare myself to you in that regard. You wish to anger me? You wish to drive a wedge? You should give it up. You’re here to support Weng Tianyao, right?”

“Of course. As his master, I will naturally support my apprentice,” said the elder with a smile.

Long Chen also smiled. “Then I’ll just say this. If I, Long Chen, want to kill someone, there is no one in this world who can stop me.”

“Hahaha, then I’ll eagerly await you.” The elder laughed as if he had just heard the world’s funniest joke.

“Long Chen…” Yu Qingxuan held Long Chen’s hand, afraid that he was going to do something foolish and fall into their trap. The eight empires had clearly come prepared to attack them.

At this moment, the atmosphere in the banquet hall was very tense, and the princes and princesses were all enraged, filled with righteous indignation. These diplomats had gone too far.

“It seems that the last battle wasn’t very good. Why not have this prince come out and experience the teachings of your Vermilion Bird royal family?” At this moment, an expert from the Heavenly Ruler Seal Empire stood.

Clearly, he was excluding Long Chen with his challenge as Long Chen was not a member of the royal family.Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

“I will exchange some pointers with you.”

At this moment, the icy Yu Qianxue stood. She had long since been nursing a bellyful of fire.

“Princess Qianxue’s name is well known, but I just wonder whether that is all you have,” said that Heavenly Ruler Seal Empire expert.

“There’s no need to exchange words. Let’s just talk with our true abilities!” shouted Yu Qianxue.

The two of them then entered the martial stage. When Yu Qingxuan’s sword came out of her sheath, flames erupted. She immediately unleashed her most explosive attack.

However, Yu Qianxue only managed to take the advantage for three moves. Seeing this scene, Long Chen shook his head. Yu Qianxue’s power did not to be questioned, but her actual perception in combat was extremely lacking. She clearly lacked actual combat experience, so she wasn’t actually much stronger than Zhu Yifeng.

As expected, on the fifth move, the counterattack was launched and her initiative was obliterated. She was then sent flying by the ninth move.

Just as that expert of the Heavenly Ruler Seal Empire was about to launch a vicious blow, the two were sent out of the martial stage.

“Qianxue, you’ve lost,” announced Yu Xiaoyun coldly.

Hearing this, Yu Qianxue bit her lip, and her eyes were a bit red. However, she had no choice but to admit that she had lost.

Long Chen looked from Yu Xiaoyun to Zhu Yifeng who was clenching his teeth furiously. He seemed to understand something.

Following that, the experts from the eight empires took turns challenging the Vermilion Bird Empire’s princes and princesses. As a result, other than the crown prince Zhu Yunwen, who barely managed to hold on against his opponent for over a hundred exchanges, everyone else lost within ten moves.

Now, all those princes and princesses had ugly expressions. They couldn’t even look at Yu Xiaoyun anymore. This time, they had lost all their faces.

Sixteen battles ended in sixteen utter defeats. Compared to these experts, they were practically nothing.

“Princess Qingxuan, I heard that your master is the master of the Blazing Heaven Divine Sect. Would you be willing to exchange pointers with this little brother?” Another expert of the Heavenly Ruler Seal Empire stood up, his gaze examining Yu Qingxuan without restraint. Three young experts had come from the Heavenly Ruler Seal Empire; all of them were princes.

Under Long Chen’s urge, Yu Qingxuan had ignored all the challenges. She knew that if she was injured or humiliated, Long Chen would immediately become a devil, and everything would instantly go out of control.

Yu Qingxuan shook her head. “I am immersed in the Pill Dao, not the Martial Dao. I also don’t like fighting with others.”

That expert laughed lecherously. “Hahaha, I like that timid and refined character. I heard that Princess Qingxuan is not yet betrothed, right? Why don’t you marry me?”

Upon hearing this insult, Yu Qingxuan’s expression instantly changed. She was about to grab Long Chen when she found that he had vanished. After that, startled cries rang out amongst the experts of the Heavenly Ruler Seal Empire.

That prince was blown apart by a golden fist, transforming into a burst of blood.
