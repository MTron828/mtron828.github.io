Chapter 3806 The Most Evil Race is the Human Race

“Changing the Nine Star Hegemon Body Art can be said to be more difficult than ascending the heavens. The last two times, you were able to succeed due to a combination of smarts, power, and luck. But it will be different this time. The Seven Star Battle Armor can be considered a dividing line for the nine star heirs. Before the seven stars, all nine star heirs are around the same level. But after condensing the seventh star, a difference will be shown due to their individual talent, willpower, aptitude, perseverance, intelligence, concentration, and other factors. The difference between them widens at the seventh star. Have you not found that even though they all condensed the Seven Star Battle Armor, only one person amongst the nine star heirs was capable of tearing apart the heavenly tribulation with his bare hands? He shattered the will of the heavenly tribulation, denying the heavenly tribulation from enslaving the nine star heirs. That is the difference. The Heavenly River Blood Sea was created from one billion Beast Venerates dying alongside three thousand nine star heirs. But in truth, half of those billion Beast Venerates were killed by that person. That person also wasn’t killed by the Beast Venerates but died to a different race,” said the dragon expert.

“Whose hands did he die by?” asked Long Chen furiously. Every nine star heir was a hot-blooded man, a true warrior. He wanted to avenge them.

“The person who killed him is also dead, so it would be meaningless for you to know. That battle back then is not something that you can imagine. All you need to know is that without a corresponding power, everything else is worthless. Fame, position, dignity, pride, they mean nothing. The culture and civilization of the cultivation world? That is nonsense that your human race uses to deceive themselves and others. This world has always been a wild world of savages. It is always power that decides everything. Your human race’s most foolish point is that you wish to use your kindness to correct evil lifeforms, all without understanding that the most evil race is your human race,” said the dragon expert.

Hearing that, Long Chen sank into thought. He ultimately bitterly smiled and said, “Although it hurts to hear, I have to agree with you.”Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

“Your human race is the most contradictory race. Good and evil, light and dark, they all merge deep within your soul. That is why your human race’s character changes the most. Kindness and evil are decided by just a single thought. You are a lifeform that walks between two extremes. No one in this world can understand you, not even yourselves. I once personally witnessed your human race walk to glory. I also saw you destroy your own divine altar and fall from it. Most laughable of all, even your human race doesn’t know why you did so. As for myself, even as a spectator, I don’t understand why such a scene would play out.” The dragon expert sighed with endless memories flowing through its mind.

“Senior doesn’t need to sigh. Once I create my own divine altar high above the ten thousand Daos, such a thing will never occur,” said Long Chen.

“You have such assurance?” said the dragon expert curiously.

“Yes. I am absolutely assured. As long as I don’t die, I will definitely reach the peak. As long as I reach the peak, this world will change because of me,” said Long Chen confidently.

The dragon expert was silent for a while before saying, “Your human race isn’t trustworthy. However, I am willing to trust you. Little fellow, your character is very much to my taste.”

“Hehe, then trust me. That trust won’t be mistaken,” said Long Chen. With the support of an existence living from the primal chaos era, he felt like his future prospects were limitless. “Senior, why is it that after absorbing so much primal chaos qi, I don’t feel anything, while my brother absorbed less than one percent of what I absorbed and already condensed an embryonic Heavenly Dao Crown?”

“That fellow is as weak as a chicken. He won’t be able to absorb much primal chaos qi in total. However, his luck is definitely excellent though. The Heavenly Daos look after him. This is what it means for the Dao of the heavens to always be fair. Amongst experts in the same realm, he is definitely the one with the weakest aptitude. The Heavenly Daos naturally give him some compensation. Thus, he is definitely one of the fastest to condense a Heavenly Dao Crown,” said the dragon expert lightly.

Long Chen didn’t know whether to laugh or cry. He only glanced at Guo Ran bragging in the distance. If he were to tell him the truth, this fellow might start crying.

However, thinking about it, Guo Ran’s current power was thanks to Long Chen forcibly dragging him up. But his natural talent and aptitude couldn’t be changed.

Perhaps Guo Ran truly was powerful now, but in the eyes of Heavenly Daos, he was a chicken that could not be any weaker. For a weak chicken to cultivate to this point, perhaps the Heavenly Daos were moved and took pity on him, looking after him a bit more.

“Senior, when will it be time to take your dragon scale?” asked Long Chen.

“Now still isn’t the time. I am still calculating fate. When the moment comes, I will naturally tell you. Right now, you can do whatever you want to do,” said the dragon expert.

“Then can I try breaking through the void again to absorb more primal chaos qi?” asked Long Chen.

“Primal chaos qi is like a dragon vein. It is in constant motion, so you wouldn’t be able to run into it every time. Furthermore, now still isn’t time for the dragon vein to formally appear. There’s no rush to condense a Heavenly Dao Crown. You also don’t need to worry about the primal chaos qi not appearing before the three thousand worlds close. The three thousand worlds cannot close without that primal chaos qi appearing,” said the dragon expert.

Since this method wouldn’t work, Long Chen gave up on it. He then began circulating the Nine Star Hegemon Body Art to quickly restore his violet qi.

With his Starry Sea Births Violet Qi manifestation, his 108,000 stars were like wells from which his violet qi burst out. In less than half a day, his violet qi was eighty percent restored.

After that, he left his seclusion. As long as he didn’t go to fight right away, his violet qi would be fully restored in a few hours. There was no need to meticulously focus on restoring it.

By the time he had recovered to eighty percent, Mo Nian and Yue Xiaoqian had reached about the same point. As for Guo Ran and Xia Chen, they had fully recovered. Guo Ran in particular didn’t even need to focus and meditate to recover. He just needed to activate his embryonic Heavenly Dao Crown and he quickly recovered. He was fully recovered in just an hour.

The current Guo Ran was delighted and constantly studying his Heavenly Dao Crown. However, every person’s Heavenly Dao Crown was unique just like their manifestation. Each Heavenly Dao Crown possessed its own unique abilities, and each person would need to research those abilities themselves.

Long Chen felt like Guo Ran’s Heavenly Dao Crown would probably not have any special abilities. After all, those special abilities were based on a person’s talent, willpower, and hardwork. This fellow was lacking in all areas. But Long Chen didn’t want to knock him down, so he just let him study it.

However, even just this rapid recovery ability was already heaven-defying. It essentially provided him with endless energy.

Guo Ran mostly relied on his battle armor to fight, so his own personal exhaustion was low. With this Heavenly Dao Crown, his combat endurance would probably be amazing.

“Let’s go back to Silver Moon City first, and we’ll bring our brothers back to Clear Sky City. The Dragonblood Legion is going to reunite.”

After Long Chen said this, Xia Chen and Guo Ran’s blood heated up. That was especially true for Guo Ran, the general of the legion. He cried out excitedly.
