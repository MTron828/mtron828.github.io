Chapter 4480 Gold Eye Silver Wing Heaven Splitting Falcon

The Esoteric Spirit World’s gates were opened once more, and countless experts of the Esoteric Spirit World had gathered on the other side. They were the ones who had jointly used a secret art to send a message into the Esoteric Spirit World. At this moment, Long Chen and the others removed the formation, reconnecting the two worlds.

When the gates opened, the aura of the Darklight Heaven flooded in, causing Long Chen and the others to instantly sense something off. They realized why the academy would summon them so urgently.

“The Darklight Heaven is changing.”

After sensing the aura of the Darklight Heaven, Long Chen was shaken. It was no longer so pure; instead, it seemed corrupted, with a newfound brutality and a pervasive murderous aura filling the air. Merely being present in this environment felt like it could make a person more bloodthirsty and violent.

The air was filled with an aura that Long Chen detested. Standing in this world, he instantly felt like he was being targeted. As he looked up at the sky, black clouds slowly covered the sun, casting a pervasive darkness over the world.

“It’s filled with the aura of Heavenly Doyens.” Long Chen’s expression darkened. The detestable aura belonged to Doyens, masters of the heavens.

Guo Ran and the others also sensed the change in the Heavenly Daos, but their sensitivity to it wasn’t as acute as Long Chen’s. Hence, they jumped in shock after hearing it.

“Race leader, Dean Long Chen!”

When Long Chen and the others finally came out, the Earth Spirit race’s experts hastily greeted them.

“We received orders from Dean Bai Letian to request Dean Long Chen’s return.”

Long Chen nodded. There was no need for them to say anything else. He already knew why Bai Letian would call him back.

“Big Brother Long Chen, I’ll go with you,” said Ye Xue.

However, Long Chen rejected her offer. “You have a more important mission. The Earth Spirit race has many outstanding geniuses, so help them awaken as Doyens. The Earth Spirit race must be powerful enough to protect itself. Grow while you can. Let us deal with the matters of the academy ourselves.”

All this time, Ye Xue had been helping the Dragonblood warriors to the point of delaying her own people’s cultivation. Knowing this, how could Long Chen possibly monopolize her support?

Ye Xue nodded in understanding. After that, Long Chen bid farewell to race leader Ye Ling and flew back to the High Firmament Academy in a flying boat.

The Esoteric Spirit World was now under the control of the Earth Spirit race. The holy tree had not only recovered, but due to Long Chen’s divine soil, it had grown even stronger. Its power was capable of covering the entire Esoteric Spirit World, enough to protect the whole Earth Spirit race.

This time, the Dragonblood Legion was returning home after a great victory, and every single one of them had gotten so much stronger. Furthermore, with the help of the holy tree and Ye Xue, their realms had solidified, leaving their foundations extremely solid despite their rapid advancement.

Other than that, it had been their first time relaxing in several years. This rare opportunity had elevated their mental realms to unprecedented heights. Apart from the inability to directly advance to the Divine Venerate realm, there was no longer anything considered taboo to them. The Dragonblood warriors were in peak condition, resembling howling wolves.

BOOM!

Suddenly, as they were flying through the air, an enormous figure whistled past them, almost striking Xia Chen’s flying boat. The powerful astral winds sent their flying boat reeling.

“What is that?!”

Bai Shishi and the others cried out in shock as they only saw a silver wing shoot by, not its full form.

“Little Nine says that it’s a Gold Eye Silver Wing Heaven Splitting Falcon, a beast from the desolate era. They were overlords from the same era as Little Nine’s people,” explained Bai Xiaole.

Everyone was startled. An overlord from the same era as the Violet Pupil Nine Tail Fox? Then it was truly an amazing existence.

“Eh, why isn’t Little Nine speaking?” asked Bai Shishi.

Previously, the Violet Pupil Nine Tail Fox was quite talkative. While not overly chatty, it would often interject a few words into conversations with everyone.

However, lately, it had been silent. Even though it recognized the Gold Eye Silver Wing Heaven Splitting Falcon, it had Bai Xiaole speak for it.

Bai Xiaole answered, “Little Nine can’t talk right now. It’s awakening its Heavenly Doyen divine rune. Speaking would distract it and affect this process.”

As expected of the Violet Pupil Nine Tail Fox race. Even without anyone’s help, it was capable of becoming a Doyen.

Most importantly, even before it became a Doyen, its power was already comparable to one. Once it came out of its seclusion, its power would be even more terrifying.

For Bai Xiaole to have such a terrifying contractual beast, many people envied him. After all, the famously weak Bai Xiaole had transformed into a formidable force after forming a contract with the Violet Pupil Nine Tail Fox.

“That Gold Eye Silver Wing Heaven Splitting Falcon is very arrogant. If it had struck our flying boat, I would have made it my mount,” complained Xia Chen irritably as he stabilized the flying boat.

The Gold Eye Silver Wing Heaven Splitting Falcon’s speed was shocking. It had most likely seen the flying boat and known that its flight would affect them, but it didn’t care and didn’t change its path.

Fortunately, this kind of astral winds wouldn’t damage the flying boat. Hence, while Long Chen was displeased, he wouldn’t cause trouble for that falcon just because of this matter. After all, the Dragonblood Legion wasn’t so petty.

Given its speed, Long Chen could have caught it if he had rushed off immediately, but by now, it had long since vanished. This matter could only be left here, but they were not happy about it.

“That Gold Eye Silver Wing Heaven Splitting Falcon’s aura isn’t inferior to Netherdragon Tianzhao’s. That’s a tough fellow,” mentioned Long Chen, eyeing the direction it went.

Hearing that, everyone was startled. Due to how fast it had flown by, they hadn’t even seen it clearly, let alone sensed its aura. However, it was actually on the same level as Netherdragon Tianzhao?Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“Too bad that it left so fast. I’d like to personally experience the power of the Gold Eye Silver Wing Heaven Splitting Falcon race,” said Guo Ran. Currently at the seventh Heavenstage, both he and Xia Chen held the lowest cultivation bases in the Dragonblood Legion, as their studies and work during this period had delayed their cultivation progress.

However, this didn’t represent that their power was stagnating. Guo Ran had upgraded his battle armor again, merging some Saint-level materials into it.

As for Xia Chen, he had inscribed new talismans using materials harvested from the corpses of Saints and other powerful items. As a result, Long Chen couldn’t even estimate both of their powers now.

The Dragonblood Legion expressed disappointment at missing the opportunity to fight a Doyen on the same level as Netherdragon Tianzhao. At this moment, they desired a chance to measure themselves against such an expert, as they were uncertain about the extent of their own power.

The flying boat continued. When they entered the land of the High Firmament Academy, all the Dragonblood warriors instantly stood up.

“We can’t miss this chance too!”
