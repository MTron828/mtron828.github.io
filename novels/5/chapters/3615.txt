Chapter 3604

On his own, Guo Ran had blasted through a battleship, causing it to explode. Following his roar, the Heavenly Dragon Divine Armor College’s battleships rumbled. The attacks that they had been preparing for a long time came raining out as if they didn’t cost any money at all.

The enemy battleships were completely unable to retaliate after being caught off-guard. Black battleships exploded one by one. Their broken fragments were like meteorites falling to the earth, leaving giant holes.

The hundreds of battleships left a mass of wreckage. At this moment, countless armored experts came flying out of the wreckage and directly targeted Guo Ran. They clearly knew that he was the commander.

In front of these tens of thousands of black-armored experts, Guo Ran simply rested his saber on his shoulder. As runes flowed around his body, a completely unbridled and arrogant voice rang throughout the entire battlefield.

“I swept through the four seas, crossed a thousand mountains, caused huge billows in heaven and earth. With his battle armor and divine saber, the unrivaled hero Guo Ran will quell the land!”

Long Chen was speechless. This fellow lived by this little jingle of his. He had never changed the first part, but the latter part was constantly changing. His skin was truly thick. Even so, this act was a bit too forceful. It was lacking a bit of skill compared to Mo Nian.

However, with his battle armor on, his voice was different, becoming metallic and powerful. Despite it being the same old phrase, the metallic rumbling that came with it was quite intimidating.

“What unrivaled hero?! You’re nothing more than an ascender from the lower world!”

An enemy expert roared, reaching Guo Ran. This was a late stage World King, and he seemed to be a commander. When the runes on his armor rumbled, his aura was quite shocking.

BOOM!

Guo Ran didn’t reply. He directly swung his saber like a bolt of lightning. Shockingly, it was another blow of Split the Heavens. Facing it, that late stage World King was directly blasted apart along with his armor.

“What trash is this? I actually thought that you had some skills. But you just wasted my Saber Qi. Peak shamelessness.”

Guo Ran swept out his saber once more, and a giant black saber-image swung through the air like a crescent fang of death toward those black-armored experts.

This one attack encompassed a giant space, covering tens of thousands of experts.

The void rumbled. Against it, those tens of thousands of experts blocked with all their power. As a result, the sky darkened and an intense ripple spread through this space. Those experts actually managed to halt Guo Ran’s saber in midair.

This effortless power from Guo Ran shook everyone, both friends and foes. They were all stunned.

Only Long Chen smiled. This little fellow was actually quite smart. His battle armor was powerful, but against so many experts, he would still have trouble.

However, the Saber Qi in his attack didn’t explode on contact with those people, but the attacks from those tens of thousands of experts were forced to explode by the Saber Qi. In truth, this wasn’t a true clash of power against power.

Those experts’ attacks were exploding amongst themselves, causing them to affect each other and lower their power. But outsiders couldn’t see this. All they saw was Guo Ran’s saber force back an army of tens of thousands of experts. He stopped their powerful current.

“Hmph, don’t say that I didn’t give all of you a chance. Now it's your time to show off!” After that attack, Guo Ran casually placed his saber back on his back and returned to Long Chen’s side.

Long Chen’s smile widened. Guo Ran really wasn’t bad. He fully displayed his power in just three moves, putting on a marvelous display. He then successfully retreated.

The main thing was that all of this fellow’s power was exhausted with these three attacks. He needed to rest and allow his armor to recover. But that was enough. He had completely shaken everyone, breaking the courage of the enemies and raising the morale of his allies. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Just then, Xie Liuer, Leng Hui, and the others led an army of three hundred starry river warriors over like a pack of wolves pouncing on a flock of sheep.

At this moment, the Starry River Battle Armors lit up. A starry river flowed on top of their armor, and their armor seemed to come to life. Every single one of their auras soared.

Xie Liuer and Leng Hui were already powerful. But now that they had changed to the Starry River Battle Armor, they gave them unprecedented power. Taking the lead, they blasted through their enemies' battle armors. They were like tigers amongst sheep, completely unstoppable.

Xie Qianqian, Tu Hu, and the others followed close behind, and behind them were the three hundred starry river warriors. They were like a sharp javelin piercing through the enemy's formation.

Those black-armored experts were originally charging out arrogantly, but they were stopped by Guo Ran’s attack. And before they could regroup, Xie Liuer, Leng Hui, and the others arrived. Their killing intent made them shiver. Having lost any advantage, their defenses were a mess.

The starry river warriors continued to fight with increasing power. This was their first time fighting in this state, and sensing the endless power welling up within them, they practically went crazy. They had never felt such a refreshing feeling.

As a result, all their anger and hatred were unleashed. The hatred that they had for the Alldevil race was embedded into their blood, into their souls.

However, in comparison to the Alldevil race, their hatred for these traitors was even worse, because these traitors had caused the deaths of an unknown number of innocent people.

These traitors had sold out the human race for their personal profit. They had sold out on their relationships and their souls. They were the enemies that had caused the most harm to the human race.

“Kill!”

“Kill them all!”

“Avenge the souls of the fallen!”

“Teach these traitors that traitors don’t have a good ending! We’ll use their blood as a sacrifice to the fallen humans!”

The starry river warriors roared, crazily slaying these black-armored experts. Seeing their enemies being slain, seeing their fresh blood spraying through the air, they grew even crazier.

At this moment, their battleships rumbled and rays of divine light spread, isolating this area. Those devil beasts were actually separated by it and unable to enter this region. With the barrier in place, the starry river warriors slaughtered their enemies with ease.

Three hundred against tens of thousands looked to be an unfair fight, and it truly was unfair. Those three hundred starry river warriors slaughtered the black-armored experts. In just a few minutes, half of them were slain.

Those experts felt like they were in a nightmare. They lost the will to resist and began to flee, but the battleships had locked down this space. Fleeing only quickened the rate at which they died.

“We surrender!”

Finally, the remnants of this army crumbled and gave up on resisting.

Guo Ran laughed. Just as he was about to give the order to capture them, Long Chen’s voice rang out.

“Kill them all! Don’t take prisoners!”
