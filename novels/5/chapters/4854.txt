Chapter 4843 Iron Blood Gate Master, Cao Guofeng

“Race Leader Yu Luo, I hear you’ve been in seclusion for over a thousand years now. I didn’t expect you to come out now. Have you cultivated the heaven vein?” A powerful voice boomed.

Long Chen looked over to see hundreds of figures wearing robes of the Iron Blood Gate. The person at the front was a square-faced man with sharp eyebrows and a short beard, looking like a bold lion.

This person emitted a powerful Blood qi. When Long Chen and Mo Nian sensed it, they felt like they had run into a wall. This powerful pressure was suffocating them.

“This person is the gate master of the Iron Blood Gate, Cao Guofeng. He is known for being vicious and fierce, and the person you will be fighting is his descendant,” explained Yu Luo, not even replying to Cao Guofeng.

Moreover, she did not speak in a whisper or spiritually. Her words were for everyone to hear.

“Vicious and fierce? I like that description, hahaha!” Cao Guofeng didn’t seem offended by her evaluation of him. Instead, he seemed amused.

Other than Cao Guofeng, there were several other ancient figures behind him. Although they were hiding their Blood Qi, Long Chen’s intuition told him that they were formidable Heaven Saints. Behind those elders were hundreds of youngsters, each possessing vast Heavenly Doyen fluctuations and shocking Blood Qi.

Yu Luo didn’t even bother responding to Cao Guofeng as the Feather Spirit race had no relationship with the four noble families. They were not friends or foes. If it weren’t for Long Chen, the Feather Spirit race wouldn’t have come here.

After being ignored by Yu Luo, Cao Guofeng turned to Long Chen. “Little fellow, are you Long Chen, the one challenging Shaoqing?”

Long Chen replied, “Do you have a fart stuck in your throat? If I told you I was your dad, would you believe me? You know who I am, so why waste words?”

Lu Ziqiong jumped in fright upon hearing Long Chen’s words. On the other hand, Mo Nian was holding his belly and laughing.

“Hahaha!”

“You...!” Cao Guofeng almost exploded from rage. After all, he was a gate master with illustrious status, and even his enemies didn’t dare to speak to him so arrogantly.

“Brat, you’re courting death!”

The disciples of the Iron Blood Gate immediately took out their weapons. As long as Cao Guofeng gave the order, they would immediately attack.

With all his might, Cao Guofeng restrained his anger and waved his hand, stopping his people. Looking at Long Chen sinisterly, he demanded, “Brat, I don’t care who you are, but why are you afflicted with such a terrifying amount of blood curses?”

“Blood curses?”

Long Chen was baffled for a moment, but he quickly understood that they had to be the resentment left behind by experts of the Blood race he had slain.

The resentment would mark the killer’s body, signaling to others of their race that the killer was an enemy. In the mortal realm, Long Chen had slain numerous experts of the Blood race, yet he remained unaware of the lingering resentment; even other members of the Blood race appeared oblivious to it. Cao Guofeng was the first to sense it.

This revelation indicated that Cao Guofeng possessed significantly greater power than any other member of the Blood race whom Long Chen had encountered. As a result, Long Chen was now marked as a mortal enemy of the Iron Blood Gate.

Now, the eyes of the Iron Blood Gate’s experts turned scarlet when they looked at Long Chen. However, in front of their terrifying lineup, Long Chen remained indifferent.

“You keep asking questions you know the answer to. I’ve always had to step over corpses on my path, whether it is in the mortal world or the immortal world. Your Blood race is no exception. There's no need for us to exchange words, is there? You want to kill me, and I want to kill you. No excuses are necessary. You could attack me right now, and it wouldn't be a problem.”

Long Chen’s deep-seated enmity toward the Blood race started on the Martial Heaven Continent, where he witnessed their brutal slaughter and enslavement of the human race. Long Chen harbored a profound hatred toward them, and in return, the Blood race hated him as well.

Their conflict had escalated beyond the point of resolution. Regardless of whether Cao Shaoqing's provocation was part of a larger scheme, Long Chen would have killed him regardless. What Long Chen truly sought to eliminate was not Cao Shaoqing himself, but the indecisiveness and excessive caution within him. He knew that he couldn’t rely on his intelligence if he wanted to regain his old self.

Despite knowing that he couldn’t beat Cao Guofeng, Long Chen showed no hesitation or fear. Just as he did in his weaker days when facing overwhelming enemies, he refused to retreat. If he could defeat them, he would. If not, he would find other ways to play with them. Through these experiences, Long Chen was gradually rediscovering his old confidence.

“If that’s what you want, don’t even think about leaving Devil Fall City alive!” Cao Guofeng smiled sinisterly.

“Give it up, you can’t use those childish tricks on me. You’re only in my way to apply psychological pressure on me. It seems that your head is so big only to fit more crap. Does Boss Long San look like someone who will be intimidated by the likes of you?” sneered Long Chen.

Long Chen couldn’t quite figure out how an old monster that had lived for tens of thousands of years would bring out such a childish strategy.

“You are courting death!” Cao Guofeng finally lost control, and his berserk aura erupted. The next moment, blood-colored flames crashed toward Long Chen.

BOOM!

Yu Luo raised her hand calmly as she had expected this attack. With a muffled sound, a qi wave tore through the void, causing both Cao Guofeng and Yu Luo to take a step back.

Suddenly, four bows were drawn back, causing the very heavens and earth to tremble. Devil Fall City was cast into shadow, shrouded in a palpable murderous aura.

The four Protector Elders aimed their arrows silently at Cao Guofeng, freezing him in place. His expression shifted completely as he found himself completely immobilized.

If he made any move, four arrows would shoot toward him at once. Even with his arrogance, facing an attack from four experts at once left him with less than a fifty percent chance of survival.

The ruthlessness of the Feather Spirit race took Cao Guofeng by surprise. They wanted to take his life, and his momentary lapse in vigilance had placed him at a severe disadvantage. Now, he was caught in a precarious position. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

The Iron Blood Gate’s experts gripped their weapons tightly. If the Feather Spirit race dared to attack, a war would happen.

“I don’t believe you dare to attack,” retorted Cao Guofeng coldly.

Yu Luo indifferently responded, “As long as Long Chen gives the word, you will meet a miserable end today. If you doubt me, you can experience the power of our soul extermination arrows.”

“Long Chen, you should kill him. First kill their leader and then the weaklings,” urged Mo Nian as if afraid that he wasn’t causing enough trouble here.

Cao Guofeng’s expression changed when Yu Luo mentioned the Feather Spirit race’s soul extermination arrows—infamous killing weapons known for dispersing the souls of their victims. Their formidable reputation instilled fear even in the likes of Cao Guofeng.

If it was just one arrow, he wouldn’t be afraid. But if all four of them got to him at once... Now he started to regret coming here. Perhaps if he had kept his distance, he wouldn't be in this precarious situation. Yet, his pride prevented him from backing down now, despite the cold sweat trickling down his forehead.

Cao Guofeng forced himself to sneer. “If I die, your Feather Spirit race will accompany me. If you have the guts, just try me.”

Pow!

Someone really did attack. With an ear-piercing sound, a hand struck Cao Guofeng’s face, causing countless jaws throughout Devil Fall City to drop.
