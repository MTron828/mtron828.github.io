Chapter 4093 Once More Encountering Feng Fei

Long Chen wasn't the only one. Even Guo Ran, Xia Chen, and the others were stunned to see her.

The woman emerged from the flying horse with an unmatched beauty, resembling a celestial goddess. Her imperial dress accented her natural majesty, amplifying her beauty that could cause the downfall of a nation. Yet, even more remarkable was the three-colored divine light trailing behind her, akin to that of a Heaven Venerate.

Though not a Heaven Venerate herself, this beautiful Immortal King possessed the aura and pressure that rivaled one.

The white-winged flying horse stood arrogantly behind her, coldly overlooking everyone. This Heaven Venerate demonic beast possessed an aura surpassing even the Heaven Venerates from the Soaring Dragon Company.

Belonging to the mutated lineage of the Silver Wing Celestial Horse race, it had inherited their swift pace and evolved its own divine nature. By being by its side, it was even easier to get close to the Heavenly Daos, increasing your cultivation speed and letting you pass through bottlenecks easily.

Furthermore, this flying horse’s wings had special divine runes that gave it the power to break through space. Being able to injure enemies and move rapidly, it was an extremely special type amongst demonic beasts.

When they saw the mark on its saddle, the Soaring Dragon Company’s people relaxed slightly. They recognized these people’s backgrounds.

“The Soaring Dragon Company wishes to capture criminals. Does this heroine of the Jiang clan have any guidance?” asked the leading Heaven Venerate.

These white-winged flying horses were the specific mark of the Jiang clan. Furthermore, their sleeves and cuffs had the Jiang clan’s mark on them.

The Jiang clan, one of the eight Eternal clans, was famous in the human race. Everyone knew of them. However, these people were rather low-key as they hadn’t raised the Jiang clan’s flag. Thus, the Soaring Dragon Company’s people didn’t instantly recognize them.

There were a total of thirty-two white-winged flying horses, and young Immortal Kings were sitting on them, their auras shocking but they were also full of arrogance.

As for that beautiful woman who seemed to be their leader, she didn’t even look at the Soaring Dragon Company’s people. Her beautiful eyes were filled with shock as she walked over to Long Chen. She had to look him up and down before finally speaking.

“It really is hard to believe. You’re still alive.”

Long Chen soon recovered from his shock and smiled. “Of course, I’m still alive. I’m also doing quite well. Fairy Feng Fei, I trust that you’ve been well.”

This woman was an original member of the Martial Heaven Continent’s four divine families, the Jiang family’s heavenly genius, Jiang Feng Fei. The two could not count as friends, but they weren’t enemies either.

At the very least, when Long Chen fought the four divine families, Feng Fei did not stand on the side of her family or Long Chen. She had chosen to remain on her own side.

It was precisely due to this that she hadn’t died to Long Chen’s hands. Now that Long Chen saw her again, he didn’t know what he was feeling.

Now the Martial Heaven Continent was gone and his old friends had perished. Everything had changed with time. Within Long Chen's heart, remnants of bitterness remained, yet they were not directed at Feng Fei. Likewise, no camaraderie lingered between them.

Seeing Long Chen recognize her, Feng Fei slowly smiled. She nodded. “When I learned that you had vanished along with the Martial Heaven Continent, I felt very bad. I even cried.”

This sentence startled Long Chen. At the same time, strange smiles appeared on Guo Ran, Xia Chen, and the others’ faces.

Feng Fei continued, “Don’t misunderstand, I only wept because I felt that the world without you was lacking the color that it should have. It was a very sad feeling.”

“Oh? I didn’t expect that you would think the world needed someone like me in it,” said Long Chen.

“Of course, the world needs you. Although our positions are different, I really like your character. I wish I could be like you and fight against all injustice. After I cried, I straightened my emotions and worked hard on my cultivation. I only came out of seclusion a month ago because my master told me to go to the Jiang clan. I really didn’t expect to run into you in such a place,” said Feng Fei.

Only then did Long Chen understand why Feng Fei didn’t know that he was alive. So she had been in seclusion the whole time.

The Jiang Clan and the Long clan might not be allies like they had been on the Martial Heaven Continent. So, even if Long Aotian told the Long clan that he was still alive, the Long clan might not spread it to others.

As a result, it was understandable that Feng Fei didn’t know his situation. Even if Feng Fei hadn’t been in seclusion, she might not have heard of him.

“After our last parting, fairy Feng Fei’s power has only grown. It’s truly enviable.”

Long Chen sensed Feng Fei’s shocking aura. There was now immense power flowing within her body, causing Long Chen to sense a pressure from her body that was even greater than that of a Heaven Venerate.

Long Chen knew that Feng Fei must have encountered some kind of opportunity in the Jiang clan. Otherwise, there was no way she could have such immense pressure.

Feng Fei smiled slightly. “As the Jiang clan’s immortal sprout, I had a seed planted in me from birth. My current accomplishments are only natural. As for you, Long Chen, you relied on your own power to reach this level. I truly admire you. Other than that…”

Feng Fei suddenly looked around, eyeing the Heaven Venerates from the Soaring Dragon Company, as well as Uncle Tree behind Long Chen. A curious expression appeared in her eyes.

“Your character really hasn’t changed. Are you pretending to be the pig to eat the tiger like usual?”

Feng Fei’s eyes were truly sharp as she instantly saw through Uncle Tree’s power. Long Chen awkwardly said, “This doesn’t count!”

Seeing his embarrassed state, Feng Fei laughed. Even the young experts with her were dumbfounded. In all their time knowing Feng Fei, they had never seen her laugh like that.

“Long Chen, you really are interesting. This world really does need you, only then does it have more color. I’m busy now, so I’ll take my leave first. But I’m very happy to know that you’re still alive. I trust that it won’t be long before we meet again. Let’s chat then.”

Feng Fei smiled sweetly. She then leaped back onto her flying horse and waved goodbye.

At this moment, the Soaring Dragon Company’s experts were flabbergasted. They could also see that Feng Fei’s power was absolutely terrifying, but she was actually an old acquaintance of Long Chen’s? They were unable to figure out what their relationship was.

Feng Fei only turned to the Soaring Dragon Company’s people after waving goodbye to Long Chen.

“Due to the relationship between the Jiang clan and the Soaring Dragon Company, I’ll warn you just this once. This fellow isn’t someone you can afford to provoke.”

BOOM!

Feng Fei’s flying horse then flapped its wings, drawing a beautiful arc in the sky as she led everyone flying away. In the blink of an eye, they vanished beyond the horizon.

The Soaring Dragon Company’s experts were struck dumb. They were doing business with all eight Eternal clans, and their relationship with the Jiang clan was quite good. That was why they relaxed when they realized that Feng Fei and the others were from the Jiang clan.Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

However, Feng Fei actually warned them? They were lost. Just what was going on?

“Hmph, who cares what background you have?! Capture him first! We can decide what we want to do later when he’s imprisoned!”

When the leader of these experts shouted and waved his hand, all the Soaring Dragon Company’s people immediately attacked.
