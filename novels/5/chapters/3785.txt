Chapter 3774: Apocalyptic

BOOM!

Even when everyone was prepared, countless people fainted from the impact. The world whined the moment these two tribulation clouds clashed, as they emitted endless lightning and a power that almost split heaven and earth in two.

Endless runes roared through the clouds as if they were fighting, trying to suppress the other.

The tribulation clouds clashed seven times, causing countless experts to scream in pain and terror. Blood poured out of their seven orifices. No matter what they tried, they couldn’t block the shockwave. They felt completely powerless. The thunderous sound penetrated deep into their souls.

Millions of people directly died and their corpses fell into the Heavenly River Blood Sea. Their tribulations had yet to even start before they were gone.

There were a total of nine clashes before the two tribulation clouds stopped clashing with each other. Then they saw the tribulation cloud belonging to Kun Tu slowly merge into Long Chen’s tribulation cloud. It was like it had finally submitted. At that moment, Kun Tu’s expression completely changed.

“Impossible! This is impossible!”

Kun Tu roared furiously; his voice shook the nine heavens. He could not believe that his own heavenly tribulation would be inferior to Long Chen’s.

Countless experts appeared within this core region. Most were from the demonic beast race, but there were others present as well. At this moment, that Underworld Eye Giant appeared, along with the terrifying beast cultivator. Many experts, who had been attacked by the demonic beast race but were still safe and sound, showed up now.

They looked at Long Chen and Kun Tu in shock. As their heavenly tribulations had all been devoured, they felt resentful about it. But seeing the clashing of the two tribulations, they chose to just spectate.

Kunpeng was a name that instilled fear in all of them. It was a symbol of unparalleled divine power. Hence, to see a human actually fighting a Kunpeng’s heavenly tribulation was truly shocking.

Even more shocking was that the Kunpeng’s tribulation actually lost a human’s tribulation. It wasn’t just Kun Tu who couldn’t believe it, the others couldn’t either.

In the end, the final two tribulation clouds merged into a single enormous cloud. This giant tribulation cloud then slowly revolved, emitting a terrifying pressure. At that moment, everyone’s hair instantly stood on end, and a terrifying sensation of death filled their heart.

BOOM!

All of a sudden, a saber-light exploded in the heavens, attacking the heavenly tribulation. As a result, a giant hole was torn through the enormous cloud. From that cloud, it was possible to see just how dense the cloud was, which caused them all despair.

The heavenly tribulation was enraged and began to rumble. After that, the roars of prehistoric beasts could be heard. Their voices almost tore apart people’s souls.

“I don’t like wasting time on your warm-up or whatever. Let’s get right into it!”

Long Chen then attacked the heavenly tribulation two more times. As a result, these two attacks didn’t even manage to pierce through the entire tribulation cloud. It was constantly growing thicker and stronger, but it did seem further incensed by Long Chen’s attacks.

Suddenly, the tribulation clouds quivered, and five-colored swords thousands of miles long rained down from the heavens. The descent of these giant swords was as concentrated as a torrential rainstorm. They instantly covered the entire Heavenly River Blood Sea.

“NO!”

These terrifying swords were comparable to the attack of a Divine Venerate. Ordinary experts were completely unable to block them, let alone absorb them.

“Long Chen, I won’t let you off even as a ghost!”

Just the first wave of the attacks was already so terrifying? How was this a heavenly tribulation? This was simply heavenly punishment. Every bit of lightning was completely destructive, to the point where it couldn’t be absorbed.

“AHH!”

Screams of despair rang out. The demonic beast race’s experts were quickly annihilated, killed without leaving a corpse.

Only Supreme experts were able to block these terrifying lightning swords. However, they were shocked to find that this lightning didn’t just contain lightning. It contained the energy of all five elements: metal, wood, water, fire, and earth.

Every one of these energies crazily tore into their physical bodies. If their heavenly tribulation was like a spring of growth, then Long Chen’s heavenly tribulation was like a pool of fatal poison. This tribulation was clearly intent on killing all existences without leaving them a survival chance.

“Save me!”

Ordinary experts begged to be saved and got close to the Supreme experts. Luckily, those Supreme experts didn’t reject them. As long as they didn’t threaten their safety in any way, these Supreme experts didn’t mind helping them.Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

Despite that, the heavenly tribulation was now a scene of chaos and despair. Screams rang out wherever blood mist and lightning mixed. This was the overture of a slaughter.

The demonic beast race’s experts quickly formed into groups for their own safety. Those that were unable to find a Supreme expert to hide under died to the heavenly tribulation.

Under these five-colored lightning swords, even the strongest of the non-Supreme experts were only able to block two before being killed if they couldn’t get the protection of someone else.

These five-colored lightning swords were too concentrated. There was practically no opening between them, leaving people without time to rest.

At this time, the Underworld Eye Giant’s power was fully displayed. Those lightning swords simply shattered on contact with his body, unable to harm him in the slightest.

The beast cultivator was also terrifying. His manifestation appeared and those lightning swords were destroyed by it. He simply stood there without moving.

The other experts of the other races that had managed to come here were also able to survive without a hitch. Those who dared to sneak into this forbidden land of the demonic beast clearly possessed immense power.

It was only the demonic beast race’s experts that were thrown into chaos. Seeing this scene, the Supreme experts of the demonic beast race spread out to protect their comrades and had no time to deal with the non-demonic beast experts. Those experts also didn’t bother attacking the demonic beasts. They just coldly watched Long Chen and Kun Tu.

“Boss, I see Weng Tianhao. He’s hiding in the distance,” transmitted Jiang Lei suddenly.

Jiang Lei was also undergoing tribulation. As a lightning cultivator and with the experience that Lei Linger had transmitted to him, his Supreme Blood simply erupted and formed a lightning blood domain around him. The lightning that landed on him was simply absorbed.

No one was targeting him or even looking at him. Hence, he started to circulate his thunderforce to probe the surroundings and inadvertently noticed Weng Tianhao.

Jiang Lei didn’t know Weng Tianghao, but Long Chen had shown him the images of Weng Tianghao, Long Qinian, Ji Wuming, the Nine Underworld Luocha, Yin Changsheng, and the others. At the very least, Jiang Lei had to know that they were mortal enemies and needed to be mentally prepared.

Jiang Lei hadn’t noticed Weng Tianhao at first because the latter had hidden so well. It was only when Jiang Lei used his Spiritual Strength and thunderforce to check around that his spiritual perception grasped Weng Tianhao’s existence.

“This little fellow has also come? That’s good. Ignore him for now. He’s useful to me,” responded Long Chen.

Long Chen’s gaze was locked onto Kun Tu, and likewise, Kun Tu’s attention was also locked onto him. His wings were fully spread, covering the majority of the sky. Countless lightning swords fell on his back and shattered, their power directly absorbed.

In fact, the power of Long Chen’s heavenly tribulation could only be partially absorbed by most experts. After all, they needed to reject the parts that contained poisonous elements. But Kun Tu was able to directly absorb it just like Long Chen. Clearly, just like Long Chen, he was not an existence that the Heavenly Daos favored. That tempered his talent to directly absorb heavenly tribulation.

As for Lei Linger, she had long since been prepared for this feast. Hence, she had split into billions of bodies spread throughout every corner of this space, silently absorbing the lightning with all her might.

All of a sudden, a flame ring appeared behind Long Chen. Kun Tu’s gaze instantly turned icy cold, and he folded his wings, preparing for battle.
