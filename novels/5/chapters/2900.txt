Chapter 2889 Starry River of the Sky Art

Inside the Immortal Scripture Pavilion, Long Chen found that the layout was exactly the same as in the Divine Scripture Pavilion. Most of the contents were even identical. Only the cultivation and secret art tomes were different.

Heaven Master Dong Ming truly showed him special consideration. He directly gave Long Chen his instructor badge and even dispatched an Elder who had been overseeing the pavilion for many years to help him.

Originally, Long Chen had been thinking of having Luo Bing help him find a suitable immortal art, but with that elder present, he quickly found over ten immortal arts related to astral energy.

“Falling Star Sword, Heavenly Star Slash, Endless Stars Fall From the Nine Heavens…” Long Chen looked through them one by one. None of these fit the Nine Star Hegemon Body Art. They couldn’t conceal it.

Long Chen could only ask the Elder to help him look through the damaged tomes. However, the Elder didn’t find anything suitable there either. Long Chen couldn’t help being disappointed.

If he couldn’t conceal the Nine Star Hegemon Body Art, he wouldn’t be able to unleash his full power. Although he looked down on Chu Kuang, he had no choice but to admit that Chu Kuang was very powerful.

He hid his power deeply. If Long Chen couldn’t fully use all six stars, he really wasn’t confident in being able to defeat Chu Kuang.

“There is one immortal art that is very similar to your specifications. This immortal art is called the Starry River of the Sky Art. It was created by the Starry River Saint, and it is extremely domineering. It is said that nine out of ten people who train in it die. Although it does exist in the Immortal Institute, it is classified as a forbidden art…” said the Elder.

“Can I take a look at it?” asked Long Chen.

“It’s a forbidden art. I need to ask for the Heaven Master’s permission. Only once it passes through a certain process can I give you a real response,” said the Elder apologetically.

“Will that take a long time?” asked Long Chen.

“No, I’ll go get in touch with the Heaven Master right now,” said the Elder. He directly left, leaving Long Chen alone.

It truly was fast. In just an incense stick’s worth of time, he returned with an ancient tome and handed it to Long Chen with a smile.

“Instructor Long Chen, you’re truly lucky. The Heaven Master actually went to find the institute head personally, gaining you the authority to take the first scroll of the Starry River of the Sky Art.”

Long Chen was pleasantly surprised and moved by this. He hadn’t expected Heaven Master Dong Ming to really be so helpful. Hence, he remembered this favor in his heart.

“Wait a moment, you said the first scroll? So this isn’t the complete technique?” asked Long Chen.

“Yes. This is a very deep cultivation technique, and it has three scrolls. The first scroll might be considered to be only introductory, but it is shockingly difficult to grasp. Furthermore, training in it is fraught with dangers. Many people have spent a lifetime without being able to master it. If they rush and recklessly advance with it, they might end up instantly bedeviled or blown up. That’s why the Heaven Master told me to explain all the pros and cons to you clearly,” said the Elder cautiously.

After that, Long Chen’s Spiritual Strength entered the ancient tome, and information poured into his head. When he understood the principle of this technique, he was delighted.

The Starry River of the Sky Art used the astral energy inside of the body to connect with the astral energy of the heavens, manifesting a formation that used the astral energy of the world.

An ordinary person only had a single astral space inside of their body. With it as the seed, utilizing so much astral energy was truly very dangerous.

Using the power of the soul to condense a formation and then using the astral space as a core to draw in the astral energy of the cosmos. If you were lacking Spiritual Strength, there was no way to do such a thing.

However, if you drew in just slightly too much astral energy, it would cause the astral space inside of the body to explode. The cultivator would be directly blown up.

Furthermore, when condensing the formation, the mind went on a mental journey outside of the heavens. It would be distracted by demons attempting to invade the soul. If a heart-devil formed from this, the Spiritual Strength would go out of control. It wouldn’t be a body explosion this time but instead a soul ignition that burnt the soul away until there was nothing left.

It could be said that it was an extremely unconventional technique. No one knew how the creator had managed to create such a thing.

However, after creating it, he didn’t leave behind a single disciple to carry on his legacy. It was because all his disciples died.

Later on, this technique was recorded and spread widely. The Starry Sky Saint didn’t wish for his life’s work, this peerless immortal ability, to be forgotten just like that.

Thus, this was no secret art. Many people knew of it, but all the large sects treated it as a forbidden technique that disciples were not allowed to practice.

Throughout history, some geniuses had managed to cultivate this technique. They made astonishing advancements, sweeping through those in the same realm. However, in the middle of their cultivation, most of them died. No one was able to cultivate it to the later stages.

That was why it was split into three scrolls. The first scroll could be studied by everyone. But the second and third scrolls couldn’t be taken out for fear that people would be bedeviled and unable to extricate themselves, ending up with them losing their lives to the yellow springs. There were far too many cases of people dying miserable deaths while cultivating this technique.

In comparison, the first scroll was dangerous, but the danger was at least limited. That was why Heaven Master Dong Ming could directly give Long Chen the first scroll.

Long Chen studied it and sighed in admiration. The immortal world was filled with geniuses. Someone had actually managed to create such a refined technique.

At this moment, Long Chen slowly formed hand seals, and tiny balls of light began to appear in his palm. Those balls of light were like specks of light.

As his Spiritual Strength controlled things, those specks of light slowly grew brighter. This was the star diagram formation.

After condensing the formation, he then sent his own astral space to the center of the formation, using his astral energy to draw in the astral energy of the heavens.

The Elder was surprised to see that Long Chen was able to easily condense the star diagram after just a read. He was truly a monster. Did he learn it with just a look? How was that possible?

The small star diagram in Long Chen’s hand moved like flowing sand, revolving within his hand absolutely naturally. At this moment, Long Chen’s smile grew.

When it came to controlling astral energy, who could compare to him? Ever since one of his 108,000 stars was crushed, his star diagram had come alive and contained the changes of millions of manifestations.

The first scroll of the Starry River of the Sky Art only contained a few simple changes that were far too easy for Long Chen. He circulated through them as easily as turning a hand.

After memorizing the first scroll of the Starry River of the Sky Art, he said his thanks to the Elder and left. Luo Ning was already waiting for him at the exit.

“How was it? Did you find what you wanted?” asked Luo Ning. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

“Hehe, yes. It’s even better than what I expected. Let’s go. I have good stuff for you and your big sister.”

Long Chen laughed delightedly. With the Seven Supreme Yang Technique and the Starry River of the Sky Art, he no longer needed to hold back.

Chu Kuang, are you ready? Boss San hasn’t gotten some proper exercise in a long time.
