Chapter 3515

It was very clear that Yu Qingxuan longed to go as well. The mysterious Wine God Palace was not a place that anyone could go to.

Even Divine Venerates would be rejected at the door if they weren’t invited.

It was said that the Wine God Palace’s interior was filled with great masters of the Wine Dao. Every single person there made wine with their own unique characteristics.

Hence, The Wine God Palace’s wine was the most famous wine within the nine heavens and ten lands. But the people of the Wine God Palace were lofty. They only gave their wine away and never sold it. Thus, their wine was something that people could only hear about but never get a taste of.

Yu Qingxuan was naturally happy that Long Chen was extending an invitation to her. No matter who it was, they would be very curious about novel and mysterious things.

Everyone said that curiosity killed the cat, but women were even more curious than cats.

“Of course, it is no problem. This young lady’s wisdom is something that I trust many senior apprentice-brothers and sisters of the Wine God Palace will be delighted by,” said Xu Zhuzi.

Yu Qingxuan was even happier to hear that Xu Zhuzi did not refuse.

“Mister Xu Zhuzi, for you to descend upon my Dragon Blaze Prefecture, it was truly rude of me not to greet and welcome you.” Suddenly, the void shook and another figure appeared in the air above the restaurant.

Long Chen’s heart shook. This person appeared silently and without warning. His cultivation base was absolutely terrifying.

“Brother Feng is courteous. If it wasn’t due to your son sending me the word, I would have missed this opportunity to meet junior brother Long Chen. I have to thank your son,” said Xu Zhuzi. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

This person was the Blaze Dragon Prefecture’s city lord, Feng Xiang’s father, a seventh Heavenstage World King.

Learning this person’s status relieved Long Chen. It was no wonder that he was powerful. So he was a seventh Heavenstage World King.

However, his warning also gave Long Chen a sense of alarm. This seventh Heavenstage World King was actually capable of merging with the void and appearing at will. Then what kind of level would a peak World King like Enpuda be at?

As expected, the dean’s words were correct. Advancing through the nine Heavenstages of the World King realm was like scaling the heavens step by step. Every single Heavenstage was as different as heaven and earth. He absolutely could not be careless.

After he had fought and slain Liao Bencang’s avatars, he started to look down on him. Now, he no longer dared to do so.

Originally, Long Chen had thought that even if he couldn’t beat his opponent, with the Lightning Falcon race’s movement art, he should be able to escape. However, that confidence was no longer so solid.

“How can you say that? My child was simply jealous and couldn’t stand someone more outstanding than him, so he did some foolish things that harmed others without benefiting himself. I’ve made you laugh at me. However, youngsters always need to take a few losses in order to grow. I normally can’t be bothered to deal with him. Letting him run into a few more nails isn’t bad. Since you wish to bring people to the Wine God Palace, I will be so shameless as to ask a favor of you. Can you bring these youngsters with you to see the world?” asked Feng Xiang’s father.

“You really are making things hard on me. Well, fine, I’ll bring them all. But let me just say this, if they don’t abide by the rules and are expelled, don’t blame me,” said Xu Zhuzi. From their tones, it seemed that the two of them were friends and very familiar with each other, which was why Xu Zhuzi didn’t refuse.

“If they don’t abide by the rules, just kill them for me. That’s fine, I’ll see if I can put in some effort and birth a new one,” laughed Feng Xiang’s father.

Long Chen smiled slightly. This person was quite straightforward. No wonder he could be friends with someone from the Wine God Palace. He was quite the character.

“Listen well. This opportunity was something obtained through begging by lowering my own face. If you don’t listen to the rules, it’s like slapping me in the face. If you dare to cause trouble in the Wine God Palace, then I won’t care how the Wine God Palace deals with you. But if you let me catch you afterward, I’ll definitely beat you half-dead at least. Also, Feng Xiang, make sure to put on a decent display this time. Bring me back a few jugs of wine, and we will be fine. If you don’t bring back anything, I’ll break your legs.” Feng Xiang’s father actually said such vicious words to him.

Feng Xiang’s expression instantly changed. “How can I do that?”

“Why can’t you? Didn’t you come up with so many tricks to harm others? Are you out of ideas now? This is your mission. If you can’t bring back anything, then I won’t just break your legs but also strip you of your position as the future city lord. Your third brother can take over,” said Feng Xiang’s father coldly. That appearance of his did not seem to be joking.

Hearing this, Feng Xiang was shocked and enraged. Before this, he could always brag that he would be the future city lord of the Dragon Blaze Prefecture. Now, his old man had given him a doomed mission. If he couldn’t get the wine, he would have nothing.

The Wine God Palace’s wine could only be obtained by those knowledgeable about wine. Only then would the Wine God Palace favor them and bestow their wine on them. However, he didn’t know anything about wine. How could he obtain any?

“Are you asking me to go steal it?!” raged Feng Xiang.

“If you want, go ahead and try. Will you have the crap beaten out of you then? If you don’t get beaten, I’ll be the one doing it,” said Feng Xiang’s father coldly.

“Are you doing this to me on purpose?!” shouted Feng Xiang furiously.

“Don’t you have your little tricks? If you can use them to harm others, you can use them to get some wine. Whether it’s through deception or lying, in any case, you must bring me back a few jugs of wine. This is your trial. If you can’t even do such a small thing, how will you oversee an entire prefecture? If you can’t obtain it, then don’t bother coming back. That way, I won’t have to see you and feel vexed,” snorted Feng Xiang’s father.

After that, he cupped his fists to Xu Zhuzi. “I’ll trouble you.”

Xu Zhuzi smiled and waved him off. Forming hand seals, everyone within the restaurant felt space quiver, and they vanished.

Only those two World King elders were left. They exchanged a glance along with a bitter smile. They wanted to go too. Unfortunately, they didn’t have that fortune.

Long Chen and the others suddenly found themselves in an enchanting world. The air was particularly clear and fresh here, and even the sky seemed especially blue. It was a world of green mountains and clear water.

“Everyone, the Wine God Palace’s territory is up ahead. However, the space here is special. You cannot fly or use transportation formations. You can only walk in. Brother Long Chen, please!” said Xu Zhuzi.

Long Chen and the others followed Xu Zhuzi deeper into the forest. Feng Xiang’s expression was gloomy the entire time. He didn’t say anything to anyone.

It was then that Xu Zhuzi’s voice rang out in his mind. “Feng Xiang, your father is testing you. If you cannot grasp this chance, your father might really give up on raising you.”

Feng Xiang was startled and heard Xu Zhuzi continue, “Your father and I go a long way back. I will give you a reminder. Your future is in the hands of one person. If you cannot grasp this opportunity, then no one can help you.”

“One person? You mean…”

Feng Xiang involuntarily looked at the one walking shoulder to shoulder with Yu Qingxuan: Long Chen.
