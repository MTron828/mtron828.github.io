Chapter 3783 Pretending to be a Pig to Eat the Tiger

All the nine star heirs transformed into lightning runes. At the next moment, a lightning dragon opened its mouth and devoured all of the ones near Long Chen.

At the same time, Kun Tu and the others absorbed the lightning runes left by the nine star heirs that had attacked them.

When the tribulation started, there were countless heavenly geniuses from various races. Now, fewer than five hundred remained. Furthermore, the majority were not from the demonic beast race. The experts from other races were actually the majority.

The moment the nine star heirs exploded, everyone’s aura grew explosively, causing the world to change color. When the heavenly tribulation was over, there were no longer Divine Lords in sight. They all finally became true Immortal Kings.

Due to just advancing, their auras were flowing out. Violent power raged, scrubbing against heaven and earth.

These people quickly fought over the remaining thunderforce. Suddenly, they eyed the lightning dragon behind Long Chen. It was because the majority of the nine star heirs had attacked Long Chen at the end, and that thunderforce was all absorbed by Lei Linger. Their eyes turned red with greed when looking at her.

This thunderforce had a heaven-defying effect. Whether it was Kun Tu, the Underworld Eye Giant, or the other experts, they all felt that their bodies had strengthened to an unbelievable extent after the tempering of the thunderforce.

It could be said that they had all benefited from Long Chen. Such a heavenly tribulation had never appeared before. The benefits were unimaginable.

When they saw Lei Linger absorbing all of this lightning, they didn’t hesitate. They directly charged over.

Kun Tu spread his wings and tore through space. He was the fastest. His sharp claws attacked Long Chen, as he could see that the lightning dragon was Long Chen’s pet. As long as he killed Long Chen, it would be possible to make the lightning dragon his.

Long Chen sneered. He swung the Minghong Saber, only for his expression to change midway.

“How can this be?!”

Long Chen had ample spiritual yuan left. Having entered the Immortal King realm, his spiritual yuan was tens of times greater than before. However, he was shocked to find that the Blood Qi in his meridians was down to less than a tenth.

BOOM!

Long Chen’s saber clashed with Kun Tu’s claw. As a result, Long Chen was sent flying.

Just as he was sent flying, Kun Tu’s other claw tore through the void. It was this second attack that was his killing blow.

However, Kun Tu hadn’t expected that after becoming an Immortal King, Long Chen would suddenly become weak. His probing feint ended up sending Long Chen flying, while his true killing blow ended up missing.

“Die!”

As Long Chen flew back, the space behind him suddenly quivered. Lightning appeared, condensing into a figure. A lightning sword then thundered toward Long Chen.

“Weng Tianhao!”

Weng Tianhao had finally made his move. His speed was not much slower than Kun Tu’s, and his sword caused the Heavenly Daos to collapse. This sword contained the power to destroy heaven and earth. Having entered the Immortal King realm, Weng Tianhao had completely transformed. He was a hundred times stronger than when he was a Divine Lord. Clearly, he had benefited immensely from this tribulation.

Long Chen was shocked and enraged. He couldn’t help being startled. Did those nine star heirs intentionally harm him? Otherwise, why was he so weak? Where did his essence blood energy go?

BOOM!

Long Chen stamped on the ground, turning and narrowly avoiding this sword. Just then, Kun Tu returned. But what welcomed him was Weng Tianhao’s sword.

The lightning sword met sharp claws, followed by exploding Blood Qi and thunderforce. It was possible to see the void fracture inch by inch, instantly spreading thousands of miles away.

The other experts rushing over were struck by those ripples and blown back. Weng Tianhao’s full-power attack shocked countless people.

“The heavenly lightning body’s reputation is not for nothing. However, it is not enough to enter my eyes. If you’re smart, you’ll scram right now.”

Lightning flickered on top of Kun Tu’s claws. However, it was quickly suppressed by his Blood Qi. Heavenly tribulation lightning was unable to suppress him.

“You’re the one who should scram. Long Chen’s life is mine. If you dare to ruin my affairs, I’ll kill you too!” Weng Tianhao was no longer as sinister as before. Instead, he was filled with arrogance. Even in front of Kun Tu, he had no intention of backing down.

“Since you want to die, I’ll kill you too!”

Kun Tu roared and his giant Kun manifestation quivered. Blood Qi then exploded with such power that the very world felt like it was collapsing, as if it couldn’t contain him.

BOOM!

Kun Tu’s fist struck, sealing all the space around Weng Tianhao. He didn’t rely on any tricks. He wanted to decide life and death in just a few moves.

“I’ll be the one killing you! I’ll teach you the power of my Violet Lightning Empire’s inherited manifestation, Lightning Towers Shakes Heaven and Earth!”

Weng Tianhao shouted and a giant tower appeared behind him. The tower had thirteen levels, and every level seemed to be suppressing a powerful beast.

Thunderforce then poured out of the tower, illuminating Weng Tianhao with divine light. When lightning chains wrapped around him, his aura instantly soared by several times.

BOOM!

Weng Tianhao’s Wild Blade rumbled. As he slashed this sword, a wave of lightning runes crashed down, creating a giant flood of lightning. Two world-shaking powers clashed.

“This little fellow is quite sinister. He has been pretending to be a pig to devour the dragon all this time.” Seeing Weng Tianhao’s full-power attack, Long Chen was shocked. This fellow was actually incredibly powerful, not at all inferior to Kun Tu.

Kun Tu and Weng Tianhao both coughed up blood. They were both injured by the other.

“Boss, save me!”

Suddenly, Jiang Lei cried out. He was being pressed by one of the demonic beast race’s Supreme experts to the point of not being able to retaliate.

BOOM!

Long Chen rushed over and slashed the Minghong Saber. The Supreme expert was horrified, thinking that he was going to die. But unexpectedly, this attack was not as terrifying as he had expected. It only forced him back, and he wasn’t even injured.

“Boss, what is going on? How did I become so weak?!” Jiang Lei was bewildered. Just like Long Chen, despite his realm increasing and his Spiritual Yuan growing explosively, his Blood Qi was pretty much empty. 

“I don’t know either, but we can’t continue like this. If we can’t even kill an ordinary person, there’s no fighting. We’re leaving!” Long Chen was also stifled, having no idea what was going on.

“Want to leave? Leave your life behind as well!”

Just as Long Chen was about to move, Weng Tianhao transformed into a bolt of lightning blocking his path. He slashed his sword.

“Fuck, do I really have to use the Purgatory Eyes?!” Long Chen clenched his teeth. He tore off his eyepatch.Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

“Big brother Long Chen, leave it to me!”

Suddenly, Lei Linger appeared in front of Long Chen. In front of Weng Tianhao’s incoming attack, she demanded, “Aren’t you going to come?”

After that, Weng Tianhao’s eyes almost popped out of their sockets. The Wild Blade in his hand vanished, and most terrifying of all, it reappeared in Lei Linger’s hand.

With the Wild Blade in hand, Lei Linger attacked Weng Tianhao.
