Chapter 4363 Natural Traitorous Bone

When Long Chen’s seven stars lit up, heaven and earth shook, and a pillar of light tore into the sky, blasting away the clouds. Under his influence, the stars above quivered, inducing a transformation in the heavens and the earth. Even though it was daytime, the stars shimmered brightly.

Starlight then cascaded down like a starry river, enveloping Long Chen. His hair took on a silver hue under the radiance, and seven stars materialized in his eyes, revolving as if they contained the workings of the universe.

The sky quivered even more intensely, and the earth cracked as rubble started to float, as if gravity itself had vanished.

After floating to a certain height, the stones exploded like fireworks. However, the shattered fragments didn’t fall and continued to float.

It was like heaven and earth had flipped, and the laws of gravity were gone. Enveloped in a silver river of stars, Long Chen was like a god commanding this world. He could neither be blasphemed nor stopped.

As the river of stars flowed around him, seven in particular caused the world to shake. Long Chen's voice turned icy and emotionless as he declared, “There are many instances when talking reason fails. At that time, you can only kill, especially when it comes to people who know reason but still act muddled. Everyone has the right to make their own choices, and even if you cry, you have to finish your path. Since you’ve chosen to be traitors, I won’t talk reason with you. You have been using the human race’s good points to fawn over other races, trading the human race’s blood and lives for profit. Now, the only thing to do is to kill you with brute force. We will resolve our problems in the most primitive way.”

Long Chen’s voice wasn’t loud, yet it spread throughout the entire Great Desolate World. It was as if this world was terrified of him and had no choice but to transmit his voice throughout every part of it.

Like an imperial edict that could not be disobeyed, the ten thousand Daos obeyed it, not daring to resist.

“Who do you think you are to act arrogant after coming to the Great Desolate World? Today, you will taste the flavor of defeat. The heavenly geniuses of the human race are trash in front of my Dragon Elephant race.”

Finally, someone from the other races could not endure any longer and stepped forward. He was a large man built like an iron tower, and his powerful Blood Qi caused the wind and clouds to change color.

This expert of the Dragon Elephant race advanced, his manifestation bursting into existence. A brilliant mix of a dragon cry and an elephant trumpet then echoed, shaking the ears of the onlookers until they almost bled.

An ancient Dragon Elephant manifested behind him, covered in golden scales and enveloped in primal chaos qi. It was like a Dragon Elephant of the primal chaos era had come back to life, and its supreme divine might shook the souls of everyone around.

“Your human race has always been slaves, food, and the lowest of the low since ancient times. It is only thanks to our mercy that you weren’t annihilated. Now, you want to stand above us? Keep dreaming!” The Dragon Elephant expert’s face twisted with malevolence, and his killing intent erupted.

BOOM!

Following that, his manifestation suddenly grew, filling heaven and earth. The Dragon Elephant’s roar rang out once more and shattered the ten thousand Daos.

Numerous faces contorted with unease. Now that Guo Ran and the others could sense this expert’s aura, they realized that the latter was even more terrifying than the Eternal experts they had fought before.

“Die!”

The Dragon Elephant stamped on the air and shot over, unleashing a shockwave that covered everyone on Long Chen’s side.

It was suffocating, but everyone knew that this was the sacred pressure of a primal chaos era divine beast. This Dragon Elephant had already rooted himself into primal chaos and inherited the will of his ancestors. Hence, he was even more terrifying than ordinary Eternal experts.

With a fist covered in golden scales, he unleashed a punch at Long Chen. The void then collapsed around this fist, leaving a black emptiness that looked like it would devour the heavens.

“Your mercy?! Hahaha!”

Long Chen raised his head and laughed, simply slamming his palm forward.

BOOM!

A semi-circular ripple spread in the void as Grand Dao runes exploded. It was a truly world-shaking collision that shattered the land. However, what astonished everyone was that Long Chen's casual blow effortlessly stopped the Dragon Elephant's punch.

The Dragon Elephant was taken aback. After all, his punch possessed the power to destroy heaven and earth, yet when it slammed into Long Chen’s hand, his force simply dissipated. He didn’t even know where it went.

It was like a river flowing into the ocean, and it simply silently vanished without causing a wave. He had never encountered such a thing before.

Grabbing his enemy’s fist, Long Chen sneered, “Are you trying to make me laugh to death? You dare to talk about mercy? Your Dragon Elephant race possesses a natural traitorous bone. Your ancestors wiped out the Heavenly Elephant race and then tried to destroy the true dragon race. But instead, you guys were counterattacked by the true dragon race and nearly eradicated. Even in a world teeming with savage races, those willing to devour their own ancestors can be counted on one hand. Someone who would kill their own ancestors has the audacity to call themselves kind? I’ve seen shameless people, but never someone as shameless as you.”

Perhaps others didn’t know about the history of the Dragon Elephant race. However, Long Chen had read about them in the High Firmament Academy.

It could be said that the Dragon Elephant race’s birth was a mistake in and of itself. They were powerful but also savage, being far too extreme.

Viewing themselves as the most perfect race in this world, they felt that whether it was the Heavenly Elephant race or the true dragon race, they had immense flaws. Hence, these ingrates refused to admit that they came from these two races.

As the Dragon Elephant race grew stronger, the first thing they did was to kill their own mother race, the Heavenly Elephant race. Their second target was the true dragon race.

If they eradicated the Heavenly Elephant race and the true dragon race, they thought they could erase their own history and become an unrivaled, unique existence in the world.

As a result, the Dragon Elephant race ended up being too arrogant. They had no concept of just how terrifying the true dragon race was. For them to compete with them was like throwing a chicken egg at a stone.

As a result, the Dragon Elephant race was hunted down by the dragon race for tens of millions of years. It was a hunt to exterminate them.

While the Dragon Elephant race was powerful, they weren’t strong enough to compete with the true dragon race. That was because a single order from the true dragon race compelled all races with any trace of dragon blood to join the fight.

The Dragon Elephant race barely managed to salvage any survivors. If they hadn't concealed themselves in scattered worlds, they would have become nothing more than a legendary existence.Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Still, everyone knew that the Dragon Elephant race was powerful. It was just that Long Chen almost laughed and coughed up blood when this ingrate mentioned kindness.

“Stop spouting nonsense!” The Dragon Elephant’s face twisted, his killing intent soaring. In truth, he was unaware of most of the things that Long Chen mentioned. He thought that Long Chen was just insulting him.

Driven by the Dragon Elephant race's inherent pride, he instantly went berserk. His scales illuminated, and he delivered a powerful kick toward Long Chen. In response, Long Chen also unleashed a kick. Their movements mirrored each other, and when their kicks collided, the starry sea behind Long Chen trembled.

BOOM!

The void shattered, and the Dragon Elephant let out a grunt as he flew back like a shooting star. Countless startled cries erupted behind him as people dodged.

Just as they dodged, Long Chen’s figure shot after him like a bolt of lightning, and he unleashed another kick.
