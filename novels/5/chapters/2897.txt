Chapter 2886 Soul Lock Heart Interrogation

That person screamed like a pig being slaughtered. Long Chen slapped him thirty-six times in a row, but he was so fast that it sounded like a single slap.

As a result, that person’s face swelled up like a pig’s, and a pretty white face instantly became a pig head. His face was purple and looked like it might explode.

Long Chen was instantly surrounded by disciples of the Immortal Institute. This was his first time in the Immortal Institute, and he was surprised to see that the Immortal Institute’s people outnumbered the God Institute. He was instantly surrounded by a thousand disciples.

“Long Chen, what are you doing? After running rampant in the God Institute, do you think you can do the same thing in the Immortal Institute? Do you think no one in the academy can put you in your place?!”

They all recognized Long Chen. After all, the matter of Crescent Moon Valley had blown up, and the Immortal Institute Luo Bing and Luo Ning were also implicated.

“Long Chen, you’re even more arrogant than the rumors. What? Do you plan on challenging the entire Immortal Institute on your own?” This person was rather sinister, hiding amongst the crowd.

Long Chen was originally going to explain himself, but seeing so many people targeting him, he narrowed his eyes. He didn’t bother.

Clearly, these people had intentionally come to cause trouble for him. Explaining would be meaningless, and it would only make the other side press harder. In his mind, he wondered about this situation. If Luo Bing was ranked first and Luo Ning was ranked fifth on their immortal rankings, shouldn’t the forces that they controlled be very powerful? Why were none of their people standing out here?

The crafty speaker’s vision suddenly darkened as a figure smashed into him. That figure was the man whose face Long Chen had slapped into a pig’s head.

The two of them coughed up blood together when they crashed into each other. There was also the sound of bones breaking. The two of them then lay on the ground, moaning in pain and unable to get back up.

“If you want to play, let’s play. Don’t take your life as a joke. I, Boss Long San, am not some good person. Don’t test my bottom line with your life unless you’re prepared to lose it. I’m here to find Luo Bing and don’t have time to waste on your idiocy. If anyone doesn’t like it…” Long Chen suddenly raised his status plate. “Then I welcome you to challenge me to a life and death duel at any time. Even if you all come at me together, I will agree.”

When he mentioned the life and death duel, those disciples instantly shut their mouths. They dared to curse at others, but they didn’t dare to bring out their lives.

“Other than beating and killing people, what else can you do?! If you have that much ability, why don’t you go challenge the dean!” sneered someone hiding in the crowd. His voice floated, making it impossible to pinpoint where it was coming from.

Clearly, he was afraid of being caught by Long Chen, so he was hiding in the crowd. However, Long Chen sneered, “Only someone filled with a sense of inferiority would hide in the crowd to do shameful things. Slandering others lets you satisfy the darkness in your heart.”

That voice once more rang out, “You talk like you’re so superior. You little gigolo, you aren’t skilled in other things, but those sisters Luo Bing and Luo Ning have probably been played with by you-”

“Die!” Long Chen suddenly roared thunderously, shaking everyone’s ears and causing their vision to flicker. They almost collapsed.

With this one roar, their souls almost fled from their bodies. They instantly turned pale.

“AH!” Suddenly, a sharp-mouthed monkey-faced man clenched his head in pain. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

His eyes were bulging as if they were going to explode. He was filled with terror and rolled on the ground, clutching his head, screaming.

He had been the one hiding in the crowd, unleashing his voice with a special technique to cover his position. With this one roar, his soul was thrown into chaos.

The disciples of the Immortal Institute were all terrified by that one shout, unable to make a sound.

“Long Chen, why have you come here?”

Just at this moment, Luo Bing and Luo Ning came over with a group of people. They jumped in shock when they saw the situation.

At the same time, disciples wearing law enforcement robes walked over. But when they saw Long Chen, they almost cried and left. That was a Yama King that couldn’t be offended.

Even the dean was someone he dared to joke about, and a magistrate was forced to bow and apologize to him during his trial. Even crazier, hundreds of inner academy disciples were killed, and two Four Peak experts were executed because of him. But the person who caused all this was still living happily and freely. Now, who dared to provoke him?

These law enforcement disciples didn’t even know what to do. They just stood there silently and couldn’t even bother to ask any questions. In any case, they couldn’t manage this, so they had to wait for bigwigs to come.

Very quickly, two Elders of the Immortal Institute arrived. They saw Long Chen, as well as the disciples lying on the ground. One of them pressed a finger against the forehead of the monkey-faced disciple and cried out in shock.

“Soul Lock Heart Interrogation Art?”

The Elder furiously demanded, “Long Chen, what do you think you’re doing?”

“What do you think you’re doing?” asked Long Chen.

“You came to the Immortal Institute and injured our disciples, and now you dare to ask me what I’m doing?!” raged the Elder.

“I came to the Immortal Institute to teach. It was your disciples who repeatedly provoked me with their curses, so I gave them a lesson. You ask me what I’m doing? Do I need to ask you for permission before giving lessons? Are all the Immortal Institute’s disciples blind and deaf? When did I become a disciple of the Immortal Institute in their eyes? I have two statuses, one as a disciple of the Pill Institute, and the other as an instructor of the God Institute. Let me ask you, whether it is in the Pill Institute, the God Institute, the Immortal Institute, or any other institute, if a disciple insults an instructor for no reason, doesn’t the instructor have the right to protect their own dignity?” sneered Long Chen.

“You…” The Elder was stunned. The High Firmament Academy did not allow people to randomly insult its instructors. If they couldn’t even protect the dignity of their instructors, how could they make the disciples take their lessons? A master must be revered. That was basic.

Hence, Long Chen’s words dumbfounded the disciples of the Immortal Institute. They had actually forgotten his status as an instructor. Now they had all been beaten for nothing. Furthermore, they would be punished for such a thing.

“Instructor Long Chen, they truly only have themselves to blame. But this person’s Soul Lock Heart Interrogation…” said the Elder.

“That lock is his own. It has nothing to do with me. While he cursed me, he was only thinking of despicable things. My spiritual roar then drew out his heart-devil. That is reasonable self-defense, so I did nothing wrong. This person’s heart is dark, and he brought this trouble onto himself. As for his life or death, it has nothing to do with me,” said Long Chen.

He turned to the law enforcement disciples. “Bring away these outrageous brats who dare to insult an instructor. Hand them to the Discipline Institute. I want a satisfactory conclusion within three days.”

After saying that, he ignored them all and walked over to Luo Ning. “Let’s go. I came to hold a class for you.”
