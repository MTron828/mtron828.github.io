Chapter 4089 Plunder the Rich to Help the Poor

It was noon when Long Chen and the others walked out of the Huayun Trading Company, and the sunlight was bright. However, Long Chen could sense strange fluctuations in the shadows of countless buildings.

After advancing to the first Heavenstage, thanks to the dragon spirit blessing, Long Chen became closer to the Heavenly Daos, and so his perception increased.

To use the dragon race’s words, this kind of perception was called a bloodline perception, which could sense any lifeform with Blood Qi.Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

On a higher level than that was the soul perception. After all, some lifeforms could seal their Blood Qi to avoid being detected.

However, the Blood Qi could be sealed, but the soul couldn’t. Even if it really was sealed, this kind of concealment was meaningless.

Alas, Long Chen was not a member of the dragon race. Without a dragon soul, he could only use bloodline perception.

Even with that limit, it was already enough. Previously, Long Chen had only been able to sense the other side’s killing intent but had been unable to lock down their position. But now, he could clearly sense over ten fluctuations in the shadows. As he walked, more of those fluctuations appeared.

It seemed that they were using some kind of method to move here through the shadows, leaving no spatial fluctuations. It was quite bizarre.

Long Chen acted as if he didn’t notice them. He then smiled and said goodbye to the Huayun Trading Company, and simply swaggered down the road in the city. He had no intention of concealing himself whatsoever.

“Boss, where are we going?” asked Guo Ran.

“When your pockets and hands are empty, you have to root out the strong and support the weak, plunder the rich to help the poor,” said Long Chen righteously.

“Hahaha, good!” Upon hearing this, Guo Ran and Xia Chen’s eyes lit up with excitement.

“What does that mean?” asked Yu Qingxuan, her large eyes filled with innocent curiosity.

In an instant, Long Chen was put in an awkward position, and he didn’t know how to explain himself. He couldn’t directly tell her that they were going to loot people.

They quickly arrived at a set of buildings. Amongst them was a beautiful domed building with the name of the Soaring Dragon Company written in bold characters on top of it. It was then that Yu Qingxuan seemed to understand something.

The Soaring Dragon Company here was even greater than the Huayun Trading Company. The buildings were also even more majestic. In the Nirvana Overflow Heaven, anywhere the Huayun Trading Company was, there would also be the Soaring Dragon Company. Sometimes, the Soaring Dragon Company would be right across from the Huayun Trading Company.

This was why it didn’t take them long to walk over to the Soaring Dragon Company from the Huayun Trading Company’s gates.

As they walked toward it, Long Chen could sense more and more fluctuations appearing. Long Chen instantly realized that the Shadow race’s people were hidden within the Soaring Dragon Company.

Previously, Long Chen had thought that the Soaring Dragon Company and the Shadow race were two villains working together, but in order to put on an act, they maintained a certain distance from themselves. Now, he found that he was wrong. They really were arrogantly open about their position.

It seemed that even these members of the Shadow race were very curious as to why Long Chen would leave the Huayun Trading Company. Furthermore, instead of running, he actually went directly to the Soaring Dragon Company.

Originally, Long Chen had sensed that these people were restless, seemingly about to attack at any moment. But now, they began to calm down, as if waiting.

Long Chen simply ignored them and swaggered toward the Soaring Dragon Company.

When Long Chen arrived in front of the gates, he smiled derisively. The Soaring Dragon Company’s steps were very tall. You had to look up from here in order to see the guards at the gate.

How was this doing business? Business stressed two sides acting fairly from equal positions. But from the position of this gate, it showed the attitude of the Soaring Dragon Company. To do business with them, you had to lower your head first.

The two Divine Venerate guards at the gate looked down on Long Chen disdainfully. “Stop! You’re-”

Long Chen sneered. It seemed that they clearly knew that he was coming. He refused to believe that the Soaring Dragon Company always had two Divine Venerates at the gates.

“I’ve come to collect taxes!”

Long Chen’s Minghong Saber slashed down on the gate.

BOOM!

The entire city rocked and that giant gate was directly blasted into smithereens. As for the two Divine Venerates, they hacked up blood. The gust from that attack almost blew them apart.

They had not expected Long Chen to directly attack, challenging the Soaring Dragon Company head-on. That was insane.

BOOM!

Dozens of experts had been hidden behind the gate. Thus, when it exploded, they tumbled out wretchedly, smashing into the surrounding buildings and blowing them apart.

“Give me your money!”

Long Chen charged into the gate and roared. The entire city could hear him.

“Boss, aren’t we here to collect taxes?” asked Guo Ran.

Long Chen glared at him. “Taxes need to be documented. Plundering people is faster. Get to work!”

“How dare you?! You little brat, you are courting death!” Just then, a furious roar rang out. Even before he appeared, Long Chen already recognized his voice. He was the Heaven Venerate who had gone to the Huayun Trading Company to threaten Long Chen.

As expected, he appeared, blazing with killing intent. But there was also a hint of excitement in his eyes. He had been in the midst of pondering how to silently kill Long Chen. But unexpectedly, Long Chen came straight to him. It was a nice surprise.

“This path was opened by me, these trees were planted by me! Everything here is mine! I’d advise you to not resist. After all, money belongs to the business, but your lives are your own. We’re only here for money, not lives. If you don’t resist, you can keep living!” shouted Long Chen.

“Hahaha!” The Heaven Venerate laughed furiously. This was the greatest joke that he had ever heard in his lifetime. Someone was trying to rob him? “You idiot, do you think this is the Violet Flame Heaven? Today, not one of you will be leaving alive! Activate the grand formation! Slaughter them all!”

The next moment, the entire Soaring Dragon Company floated into the air, and barriers lit up. Dozens of them activated, instantly turning this place into an inescapable prison.

“Long Chen, you can die with your secret!”

Once the barriers formed, the Heaven Venerate laughed and waved his hand, causing the world to darken. A sinister chill then appeared, sending shivers down everyone’s spine. It was like they were transported into the darkness of night.

Long Chen also laughed. “Are you really looking down on me that much? A few Immortal King rookies wish to kill me?”

Long Chen suddenly stabbed his saber into the ground and summoned a sphere of lightning in his left hand. Just like that, the darkness of night was pierced. Under the light of the lightning, it was possible to see multiple figures charging at Long Chen with sharp blades in their hands.

Guo Ran, Xia Chen, and the others jumped in shock. They hadn’t even sensed these existences nearing them.

Exposed by the lightning, they instantly fled like startled rabbits.

“Too late! World Extermination Lightning Radiance!”

The sphere of lightning exploded, transforming into a wave of berserk lightning that instantly devoured those lifeforms.
