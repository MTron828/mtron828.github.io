Chapter 4255 Mysterious Gate

Bai Xiaole stood on the Violet Pupil Nine Tail Fox's head, their pupils interconnected, their souls unified. This was a merger art that only existed in legend, so no one had personally witnessed this technique.

Bai Xiaole’s soul had melded with the Violet Pupil Nine Tail Fox’s soul. Hence, it was no longer a contract, but a mutual trust and unwavering support in one another.

The Violet Pupil Nine Tail Fox's power began to unfurl gradually, and its former strength gradually resurfaced.

Most importantly, it was now linked with Bai Xiaole’s Three Flower Pupils. That was like adding wings to a tiger.

Previously, it had always been dissatisfied with Bai Xiaole, feeling like it had been tricked. It wished that it could undo the contract between them.

However, last time, when Xu Xin-er wanted to take it, Bai Xiaole had unleashed his full power, at the risk of destroying his eyes to resist an Eternal divine weapon, and that had finally won the Violet Pupil Nine Tail Fox over.

Without that blockade in its heart, it sincerely accepted Bai Xiaole, and the two finally formed a resonance.

The Violet Pupil Nine Tail Fox chased after Xu Xin-er rapidly. In just a short moment, it caught up.

BOOM!

The Violet Pupil Nine Tail Fox’s claws raked across the violet-gold bell, sending it flying. As for Xu Xin-er, she coughed up blood and was blown away.

At this time, countless experts of the Xu family came charging over to help Xu Xin-er. However, the Violet Pupil Nine Tail Fox’s aura was overwhelming them.

Seeing that they stood no chance against the two of them, Long Chen didn’t worry about them anymore. With a flap of his wings, he shot after Long Aotian like a bolt of lightning. His speed was higher than Long Aotian’s.

BOOM!

The void collapsed. However, Long Aotian snorted and suddenly dodged to the side, refusing to fight Long Chen.

“You want to conserve your energy? We’ll see if you have that ability.” Long Chen once more shot after him.

Long Chen left behind a series of lingering afterimages. In just three swift turns, he appeared right in front of Long Aotian. His speed was astounding, rendering him nearly imperceptible to the naked eye.

BOOM!

A golden fist shot out of those afterimages and smashed into Long Aotian.

Long Aotian was sent flying, but what shocked Long Chen was that the moment his fist landed, five-colored divine radiance lit up on top of Long Aotian’s body, blocking eighty percent of the force behind his attack.

It had to be known that Long Chen’s attack power was incredibly concentrated, so he was amazed that this five-colored divine light could dissipate so much of his force.

On the other hand, although Long Aotian was sent flying, he wasn’t injured at all. Seeing Long Chen’s shocked expression, he sneered, “Do you see? This is the power of the seven-color Supreme Blood. With the patriarch’s help, I have fully activated it. Xu Xin-er’s words really helped me see the light. Killing you directly is letting you off too easily. I will only kill you once you are suffering endless pain.”

“You don’t dare to fight me directly, so you make up a bunch of excuses. Long Aotian, you really fail to live up to your name,” retorted Long Chen.

“You want to anger me? Once I kill your women one by one in front of you, we’ll see if you’re still in the mood to do such a thing, hahaha!” Long Aotian suddenly shot in another direction, attacking the Dragonblood Legion from another angle.

“Kill everyone related to Long Chen!”

Just then, Lian Wuying shouted coldly. She then led the Undying race’s experts in a direct charge against the Dragonblood Legion.

“Ignore Long Chen! We just need to crush them, and in a few breaths’ time, they’ll all be killed!” shouted the leader of the Black Tortoise race.

“Attack together! Don’t hold back!” shouted Ye Wuchen, leading the Ye clan’s disciples over.

Hundreds of thousands of experts attacked at once, causing the entire martial stage to shake. The next moment, immense pressures rose, as if they would blow up the barrier.

All the lifeforms inside the barrier were stupefied by what they were seeing. Even before the great battle actually commenced, their auras already stunned them.

These experts were the strongest heavenly geniuses present, each of them a Triple Supreme. In unison, they summoned their manifestations, causing the world to change color.

“The real battle starts now!”

Meng Qi and the others also grew serious, and all of them entered their combat state.

Suddenly, Long Chen stopped pursuing Long Aotian. With a flash, he appeared in front of the Dragonblood Legion, his hand raised and a clump of white flames rising in his palm.

Sacred chanting reverberated, their echoes spreading throughout heaven and earth. At the same time, the martial stage’s barrier quivered, and flame energy poured through the barrier toward Long Chen.

“What?! Long Chen can absorb the outside world’s energy through the barrier?!”

In an instant, a white flame lotus grew in Long Chen’s hand, radiating terrifying heat that washed over the martial stage, making numerous experts feel like they were in a sea of fire.

However, within this sea of fire, snowflakes materialized, imparting a dual sensation of scorching heat and bone-chilling cold, leaving those within it feeling as if they might combust from the intensity of these conflicting extremes.

Seeing that white lotus, Lian Wuying and the others were horrified. Moreover, Lian Wuying had already experienced the power of the Ice Soul. At that time, Long Chen had used it in a very simple manner to escape her bindings. However, now that he was using its full power, the difference between the two was enormous.

“Block it together!”

Zhao Xingtian and the others cried out, as that white lotus made them smell the scent of death.

As a result, hundreds of thousands of experts came to a stop together, summoning an array of protective shields in the air while their manifestations raged on.

Hundreds of thousands of peak experts had summoned defenses for one person’s attack. Just this point alone had proved the terrifying power of Long Chen’s technique.

“World Extermination Flame Lotus!”

Long Chen shouted, and his enormous white lotus descended with a resounding crash that rattled the ears of everyone present.

Just as everyone was expecting an immense collision, a flabbergasting scene played out. Long Chen’s World Extermination Flame Lotus actually flew over their heads, avoiding their defenses.

“He missed?”

Everyone inside and outside the martial stage was dumbfounded. How could he miss with a technique of such immense scale?ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

“No, his target is-!”

Suddenly, a shocked cry pierced the air, and the white lotus fell toward a large group of individuals, who happened to be the devil race’s army.

“Run!”

Horrified screams rang out from the devil race’s army. However, by the time they realized what was going on, they found that the space around them was twisting, and they felt like their bodies were bound by stars. They simply couldn’t run.

BOOM!

The flame lotus exploded amongst the devil race’s army, and huge flames devoured an enormous space. In this space, the flames raged uncontrollably, reducing countless devil experts to ice fragments.

The ice fragments then drifted, akin to snowflakes set ablaze. Not a drop of blood, nor a single scream echoed. All the others could see was the fiery remnants of the devil race’s army in ice. The intense heat actually caused the barrier to buckle, as if it was melting.

Following that, an even more shocking scene occurred. The karmic luck bead at the center of the martial stage exploded.

“Let’s go!”

Xia Chen shouted, and the Dragonblood Legion vanished, reappearing right beside the karmic luck bead.

The entire martial stage was thrown into chaos as people saw runes flying out of the karmic luck bead. Those were the karmic luck fragments that everyone wanted.

“Grab them!”

All the lifeforms on the stage went crazy, flooding toward the karmic luck bead from all directions.

However, Long Chen wasn’t even looking at the karmic luck bead but below it. A dark gate had appeared there.

“Long Chen, it has appeared.”

Mo Nian’s voice resounded in Long Chen’s mind, trembling with fear. Long Chen, too, felt a chill when he saw that ominous gate. An intense feeling of mortal crisis overwhelmed him.

When the gate slowly opened, a sinister voice rang out from the other side.

“Hahaha, I’m finally free! Damn human race, kneel and repent!”
