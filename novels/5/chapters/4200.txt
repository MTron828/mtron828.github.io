Chapter 4189 Little Nine

The palace master and the Xu family head hadn’t actually exchanged blows. But a single word from the palace master was enough to terrify countless innate Heaven Venerates.

These devil experts had planned to force Long Chen to hand over the Eternal corpses and Eternal divine weapons, but a single word from the palace master left them utterly terrified.

The appearance of the palace master intimidated countless people, and they now understood why Long Chen had the audacity to plunder the Soaring Dragon Company. So he actually had such a terrifying expert supporting him.

Seeing Long Chen leave, the devil experts could only clench their teeth furiously. As for the Soaring Dragon Company’s people, the survivors had long since fled in every direction, and the unlucky ones could only become resentful ghosts.nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

The Soaring Dragon Company might be powerful, but its power was spread throughout an extremely wide area. Due to constantly doing business everywhere, it was very difficult to gather all their experts.

Given their immense power, they had never dreamed that Long Chen would trick them like this. As for those two swindled fellows, they were driven to extreme actions and began slaughtering the people of the Soaring Dragon Company.

The Soaring Dragon Company also became a huge laughingstock because of this matter, and Long Chen was given the title of a supreme swindler.

This supreme swindler had profited immensely. In front of countless gazes, he swaggered back to the High Firmament Academy.

When Long Chen returned to the academy, he found that it had become much more peaceful. There were more outsiders present studying the stone tablets, but now they were all very obedient.

Let alone causing trouble, not one person even raised their voice. They all followed the rules religiously. When they saw Long Chen, their gazes were worshipful.

“A group of idiots with no skill. Give them an inch, and they’ll demand a yard,” Luo Ning scoffed, her disdain for such individuals evident. She held people like them in the lowest regard.

Previously, they had voiced all sorts of complaints against the High Firmament Academy, despite being granted free access. But upon Long Chen’s arrival, they all became obedient children.

“Brother Long, were you looking for me?”

Long Chen had just returned to the High Firmament Academy when Xu Changchuan arrived with over ten of the Fullmoon race’s experts.

Two of those experts had veiled auras, so they must be true experts. It seemed that Xu Jianxiong was so worried about Xu Changchuan that he had two of their top experts guarding him.

When Xu Changchuan arrived, he greeted everyone. After all, he was once a disciple of the High Firmament Academy.

“I have something important to give. I've been too busy lately, so it wasn’t convenient for me to go to you,” said Long Chen.

More and more experts had now arrived in the Sage King Prefecture, so the various territories were becoming rather complex. If Long Chen were to travel to the demonic beast race’s territory again, he might have to fight through several factions.

Long Chen might not be afraid of them, but he really didn’t have that much time at the moment. He could only send word to the Fullmoon race to send someone over.

“This is…!”

When Long Chen handed the world stone to Xu Changchuan, the latter almost couldn’t believe what he was seeing. The Fullmoon Rhinoceros’s corpse was lying inside of it.

“This is a major matter. We have to return immediately and show it to the race leader!” The two elders behind Xu Changchuan also checked the contents of the world stone and were even more excited than he was.

It was an ancestor of the Fullmoon race, an Eternal expert. Moreover, the corpse was perfectly intact, so perhaps they could inherit many of its divine ability runes. This corpse was truly a priceless treasure for them.

This matter was too important for their race, so Xu Changchuan couldn’t bother with courtesies. After saying goodbye to Long Chen, he rushed back in a hurry.

After all, such a major affair had to go through the race leader. They would need to immediately discuss just how to deal with this corpse.

After dealing with the Fullmoon race’s matter, Long Chen returned to the inner academy. He then checked on Bai Xiaole’s eyes and couldn’t help but gasp.

“You little brat, you were just a bit away from crippling your eyes! What on earth possessed you to act so impulsively?! With your boss present, no one can bully you,” cursed Long Chen.

The meridians in Bai Xiaole’s eyes were severed into tiny bits. Fortunately, their positions were still correct, and they could be reconnected. If they were instead blasted everywhere, no one could save his eyes.

“I wasn’t thinking. But anyone who dares to take my Little Nine must be stopped with my full power!” Bai Xiaole smiled foolishly.

“Little Nine?”

Everyone stared at him in confusion.

“How many times have I told you not to call me Little Nine?! I’m older than your grandparents!” The Violet Pupil Nine Tail Fox once more appeared and cursed him.

Long Chen and the others almost burst into laughter. The Violet Pupil Nine Tail Fox was a desolate species that was famous everywhere. Its body could cover up the sky and sun, so the name of Little Nine was rather comical.

Bai Xiaole didn’t respond to the Violet Pupil Nine Tail Fox’s curse, still smiling foolishly. However, his eyes were lightless, and his appearance was distressing.

Long Chen solemnly said, “Little Nine, let me tell you-”

“I already said not to call me that! Are you deaf?!” roared the Violet Pupil Nine Tail Fox.

“Then what do I call you? Little Tail?

“Little Violet?”

“Little Pupil?”

“Little Fox?”

Long Chen listed off several names.

“Fine, just call me Little Nine!”

The Violet Pupil Nine Tail Fox seemed to accept its fate. When these were the options, it seemed only Little Nine was a bit better.

Long Chen continued, “This foolish brother of mine isn’t truly foolish. It’s just that he has a foolish father who has beaten him ever since he was a child, resulting in him having some deficiencies in his mind. The more you howl and shout at him, the more his head turns blank just like a fool. Since you’ve already formed a contract with him, you will share fates in the future. You need to understand, help, and support each other, as you now share wins and losses. I know you’ve suffered by forming a contract with Xiaole. Your powerful cultivation base was suppressed to this point, so you naturally must not feel good…”

Long Chen’s words made the Violet Pupil Nine Tail Fox much calmer. It seemed rather pleased. Long Chen then continued, “However, you can also see that while he might be foolish at times, his feelings toward you are sincere. He is willing to risk his life for you and even almost crippled his eyes. His eyes are more important than his life, and you are even more important than his eyes. Why don’t you tell me just how he treats you?”

Hearing this, the Violet Pupil Nine Tail Fox looked at Bai Xiaole with a complicated expression. It truly was moved that Bai Xiaole had risked everything for it. That was something that it had not expected.

After all, while it was with Bai Xiaole, it constantly cursed and scolded Bai Xiaole. It hadn’t expected Bai Xiaole to treat it this nice.

“In truth, Bai Xiaole is very smart and talented. You’ve now gained the inheritance of the Six Dao Heavenly Eye, so you should try to study it calmly. I believe that you will make unimaginable gains if you do so,” said Long Chen.

“That’s enough. You prattle on so much that it becomes annoying. We don’t need you to manage our affairs. We’ll deal with it ourselves. Xiaole, we’re leaving. We’re going to heal,” said the Violet Pupil Nine Tail Fox with a snort, dragging Bai Xiaole away.

Watching as they left, Long Chen smiled. After going through this tribulation, the Violet Pupil Nine Tail Fox and Bai Xiaole’s relationship had improved. If the Violet Pupil Nine Tail Fox sincerely accepted Bai Xiaole, then once their souls merged, their power would definitely be astonishing.

BOOM!

Suddenly, the High Firmament Academy swayed, delighting Bai Shishi.

“The High Firmament Palace has appeared! Let’s take a look!”
