Chapter 2339 Planning Something Big

Translator: BornToBe

The Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow race had become the emperors of the Xuan Beasts. This news instantly spread throughout the Martial Heaven Continent.

Many people had thought that the Xuan Beasts would decide on a new ruler with the help of the divine families. Some had guessed that a portion of them would end up joining the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow race, but they hadn’t expected every single Xuan Beast race to join them. Not one of them put out a dissenting word.

Furthermore, all the Xuan Beasts began to leave their old territories to surge toward the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow race’s territory.

After some investigation, people were shocked to learn that Long Chen had opened the Myriad Spirit Diagram to the Xuan Beasts, letting them find their lost inheritances. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

By opening the Myriad Spirit Diagram to them, Long Chen had instantly won the hearts of the Xuan Beasts. As a result, the territory of the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow race was packed to the brim.

“Long Chen, some people have suggested moving our territory…” Que Yuzhu and Long Chen were talking alone.

Before she finished, Long Chen said, “It should be moved to the territory of the Xuan Beasts, right? Yes, that’s true. As emperor of the Xuan Beasts, you should be with them. As for the grand formation, many of the materials can be dismantled without damage. There won’t be that much of a loss, and we have enough manpower for that.”

“You should come with us. Without you, I always feel uneasy. Other than that, the coronation is three days from now. Cloud…”

“Cloud is too young for that. She is still a child. I don’t want her to carry something like that, as it is also a kind of shackle. This crown can only belong to you.”

“Me?” Que Yuzhu was startled. Right now, Cloud was the strongest expert of the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow race. If anyone was to be crowned, it should be her.

“What’s wrong with that? In the mortal world, kings and emperors aren’t those who possess the greatest martial power, but those who have the right mind for the job. They must have greater vision. To tell the truth, even if Cloud was crowned, she wouldn’t be able to take on most of the responsibilities, and she would end up coming to you for help. Don’t tell her I said this, but I would guess that it wouldn’t take more than a few days before she lost her temper over all of it. So you are the most suitable to be crowned. If you need martial power, then you have the entire Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow race. As long as you show off your resolution, you will be able to lead the various races,” said Long Chen.

Que Yuzhu smiled bitterly. “It seems that this burden is too heavy.”

“If you feel that this burden is heavy, then how can you have Cloud bear it? Don’t worry, it won’t be as difficult as you imagine. Just remember you have the Dragonblood Legion as support as well.”

“Alright then. I will temporarily thicken my face and accept this position.” Que Yuzhu sighed heavily. “Once Cloud grows up, this position will be hers.”

Long Chen smiled. This position might not be something that Cloud would want. She liked playing too much to care for such a thing.

“Long Chen, if we’re to move to the territory of the Xuan Beasts, you should come with us. Otherwise, I might not be able to lead them well enough,” said Que Yuzhu.

Long Chen knew that the truth was that Que Yuzhu was worried about Long Chen having some kind of prejudice against the Xuan Beasts, so she said this. With the Xuan Beasts having made their oath and in their current state, they would listen to her obediently.

“Aunt Que, we’re a family. You don’t need to worry about those things. Meng Qi will go with you to activate the Myriad Spirit Diagram, and that’ll be enough. During this time, I should stay in the headquarters of the Martial Heaven Alliance.”

Que Yuzhu nodded and returned to her work. There was a great deal of activity she had to oversee right now.

The interior of the Xuan Beasts was not fully united. Now that a new ruler was coming, quite a few people were fawning over them, as well as a few saying some bad words, bringing up questions about history and other complex matters.

However, Que Yuzhu ignored them. Even if those races had once attacked the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow race due to the pressure of the Kunpeng race, she didn’t want to pursue it. They were just pawns in the grand scheme. They couldn’t go against the Kunpeng race’s orders.

In the same vein, now that the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing sparrow race was emperor, those races wouldn’t dare to not follow her orders. If she wanted someone dead, she only needed to point and they would raise their weapons against them.

All she did was give those troublemakers a stern warning. The things of the past would remain in the past. The Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow race would treat all the Xuan Beasts equally.

This response placated the majority of them, as well as increasing the loyalty of the other races.

As the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow race began to move, Long Chen brought the Dragonblood Legion to the headquarters of the Martial Heaven Alliance.

When he arrived, the disciples burst into cheers. He was the soul of the Righteous path, and those disciples all wished to greet him. After that, Long Chen left the Dragonblood Legion with those disciples to talk, while he went to see Qu Jianying with Ye Lingshan.

“Long Chen, why are you always alone? Your girlfriends are rarely with you. Did you make them mad?” asked Ye Lingshan because she didn’t see Meng Qi and the others.

When Meng Qi had gone to the territory of the Xuan Beasts, Tang Wan-er, Chu Yao, and Ye Zhiqiu had discussed it and decided that they didn’t want to be separated. Also, they didn’t like the noisiness of the Martial Heaven Alliance, especially Ye Zhiqiu.

Although Ye Lingshan was mostly teasing, Long Chen couldn’t help sighing.

“What is it? Did you really make them mad?”

“I wish I had that chance, but I don’t even have time for such a thing.” Long Chen shook his head. He didn’t even know how much time had passed since he had properly accompanied them for a while.

Every day was a fight to stay alive. They didn’t have a chance to relax.

He was a heavenly genius that countless people admired, but he didn’t admire himself at all. He felt himself to be a pitiful bug within the whirlpool of fate. Just surviving was taking all he had.

“Let’s not talk about this. Is there any news about Tian Xiezi and Di Feng?” asked Long Chen. He hadn’t heard anything about the two of them since they had run.

“There’s no news from Tian Xiezi. After all, we don’t have eyes in the Corrupt path. But it seems that Di Feng has been looked upon favorably by the divine families and has joined them,” said Ye Lingshan.

“He’s gone to the divine families?” Long Chen frowned.

“You might not know this yet, but it seems that the Di family has a relationship with the divine families. You remember Di Feng’s little brother?”

“Yes, that idiot whose mother wanted me to let him go because he was ‘just a child’. I remember I was so nice as to give him a chance to reincarnate,” said Long Chen. He still remembered Di Xin.

“Di Xin and Di Feng are brothers from the same father but different mothers. Di Xin’s mother was someone from the divine families, and I hear that her position isn’t low. As for why she would marry Di Long, it’s unknown. After Di Xin died, his mother returned to the divine families and has only come out recently. She went to the ancient family alliance and spoke to Di Long before leaving. No one knows what they talked about, but afterward, Di Feng was brought into the divine families. Ah, it seems that he was brought into the Ye family, and I heard that Di Xin’s mother is also surnamed Ye.”

“Are you saying that the reason the Ye family is targeting me is because of that old bitch?”

“It’s very likely.” Ye Lingshan nodded.

“Fine then. Although it’s a bit melodramatic, at least I know why now.” Long Chen was speechless. That slap from back then had ended up drawing out such a terrifying power.

The two of them arrived to see Qu Jianying, the old man, Li Tianxuan, and the other elders present.

“Long Chen, you said that you had something important to discuss? Tell us,” said the old man.

“Wait a bit longer. There are still more people coming,” said Long Chen. Just as he said that, Beitang Rushuang and Nangong Zuiyue came in.

Following that, Zi Yan also walked in. Seeing them made Qu Jianying and the others realize just how big Long Chen’s plot was.

Long Chen greeted Nangong Zuiyue and Beitang Rushuang. Beitang Rushuang directly asked him if he had anything good for disturbing them.

Long Chen smiled and said, “There’s definitely something good for you, or how would I dare to disturb you? Since everyone’s arrived, I’ll get right to the point. Everyone is now profoundly aware of the effect of the immemorial essence blood, right?”

“You want to attack the Blood race?” asked Beitang Rushuang, surprised.

“Hehe, that’s right. The Blood race sneak attacked us, so we have to strike back. Of course, other than for moral reasons, we can conveniently get some immemorial essence blood. Is everyone interested in that?”

“Of course we’re interested, but the divine families have stationed two armies in front of the Yin Yang World, preventing anyone from entering,” said Beitang Rushuang.

“Just leave that to me. As long as everyone agrees, then we’ll all profit. You’ve all helped me out, so I need to at least get some meat for you to eat, right?” Long Chen had an evil smile in his eyes. He had already come up with a plot long ago.

“Alright then. When?” Everyone knew that Long Chen was the master of not losing out with his evil plots. Following him, there would definitely be meat to eat.

“The day of the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow race’s coronation is the day that we’ll attack the Blood race,” said Long Chen, startling everyone.
