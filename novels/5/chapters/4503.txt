Chapter 4492 Terrifying Primal Chaos Space

As the Yuan Spirit of the nether dragon race leader infiltrated Long Chen’s mind-sea, the once-golden expanse turned pitch-black, succumbing to a menacing force that now dominated this realm.

In front of a Saint’s Yuan Spirit, Long Chen felt powerless. He could only watch as black qi swirled around the bronze cauldron, forming chains around it.

The nether dragon race leader was quite astute. Knowing how terrifying this cauldron was, he sealed it first although he didn’t sense any of Long Chen’s spiritual fluctuations on it. Having taken control of Long Chen’s mind-sea, the race leader started to brazenly transmit the rest of his power to Long Chen.

At this time, the body of the nether dragon race leader flashed and rapidly withered, turning into a desiccated husk.

His corpse then fell to the ground and transformed into dust. The possession this time was incredibly important to the nether dragon race leader. He not only wanted to obtain Long Chen’s body but also transfer every bit of his power to Long Chen.

After all, Long Chen’s physical body was even stronger than he had expected. With such a young and powerful body, the race leader would possess a limitless future.

Although the race leader would have to start over, with Long Chen’s physical body and Spiritual Strength, he knew he would definitely be better off than he was now. Furthermore, this possession held the potential for a significant breakthrough. If the race leader could break through the Saint realm, the setbacks of their recent endeavor would no longer be deemed a failure.

“Long Chen, hand over the method to control this bronze cauldron! Don’t force me to use the nether flame soul refinement! I’m warning you right now!” The race leader’s Yuan Spirit looked at Long Chen’s Yuan Spirit inside his mind-sea.

Having taken control of this place and transferred his full power, the nether dragon race leader had rendered Long Chen powerless, leaving him unable to resist.

However, he didn’t immediately kill Long Chen as he wanted all of Long Chen’s secrets. In his view, Long Chen was completely under his control and posed no threat to him. He could make Long Chen live a life worse than death.

If the race leader were to simply destroy Long Chen’s Yuan Spirit with brute power, he wouldn’t necessarily be able to obtain Long Chen’s full memories, and that would be a huge loss to him.

Long Chen looked at him coldly as if he had given up. However, now that the race leader had spoken, Long Chen sneered, “I’ve never seen someone so generous before. You not only sent me your son and the Ten Thousand Dragon Nest, but also your whole body. Now, I feel bad.”

Hearing this, the race leader twitched and suddenly had a bad feeling. That fearless appearance of Long Chen’s made him uneasy.

Hence, he slammed his hand forward, causing the power of a Saint to erupt and suck Long Chen’s Yuan Spirit.

Seeing that he still had control over this space, the race leader felt confident again. The bronze cauldron also didn’t move.

The race leader snorted, “Keep talking big. I’ll let you taste the nether flame soul refinement.” Black flames then burst into existence on the race leader’s hand as he reached for Long Chen’s throat.

However, as his hand was about to touch Long Chen’s throat, the golden gate behind Long Chen opened, and golden light illuminated the black mind-sea.

Long Chen instantly felt revitalized as his mind-sea was under his control again.

A hand then swung out and slapped the race leader in the face. However, the race leader didn’t budge, and instead, Long Chen was sent flying by the backlash.

That slap allowed Long Chen to escape the race leader’s attack, shocking the race leader. The golden gate’s light was capable of resisting his domain.

“Courting death!” Although the race leader didn’t know what lay inside the gate, this bad feeling urged him to shoot after Long Chen.

As the gate fully opened, revealing a radiant star within, a beam of divine radiance streaked toward the race leader.

BOOM!

The race leader was sent flying by that golden light. Long Chen couldn’t help but feel delighted to see this; the Divine Gate Star in his mind-sea was so powerful that it could even send Saints flying.

“You are courting death!” the race leader roared furiously, unleashing his power as he surged once more toward Long Chen.

“Don’t waste energy on him. His energy is yours. The more energy he wastes, the more you lose,” transmitted the Earth Cauldron.

“Then what should I do?” asked Long Chen in confusion. Was he not supposed to fight him?

“Summon your divine ring and battle armor.”

What? This is my spiritual space. Long Chen had never fought in his spiritual space, let alone summoned his divine ring and battle armor here. However, he listened to the Earth Cauldron.DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

“Divine ring! Battle armor!”

BOOM!

Long Chen’s divine ring appeared, its interior twinkling with stars, and his Seven Star Battle Armor erupted into existence. Following that, a scene that shocked Long Chen appeared.

Specks of starlight materialized, reflecting a scene—the inside of the primal chaos space.

When these stars illuminated the scene of the primal chaos space, Long Chen’s body quivered. Following that, an irresistible power poured through his body, and his Spiritual Strength stretched limitlessly. He instantly felt like the ruler of this world. It was like one thought from him could give rise to life or wipe out all existence.

As divine pressure crashed down throughout the spiritual space, the nether dragon race leader quivered, unable to move. He was horrified.

Within Long Chen’s divine ring was the primal chaos space, and the primal chaos space’s power was flowing through his body. Long Chen felt like he was dreaming.

When Long Chen’s gaze turned toward the nether dragon race leader, the latter actually knelt toward Long Chen, his whole body shaking.

Long Chen instantly understood. “He’s afraid of the primal chaos space’s energy. So, the power of the primal chaos space that I’ve never been able to tap into can be unleashed inside my spiritual space.”

No matter what level of divine item he had encountered in the past, as long as he pulled them into the primal chaos space, they would instantly become obedient. However, Long Chen was never able to summon this power in any other way.

Today, with the Earth Cauldron’s reminder, he finally learned that he could use the primal chaos space’s power this way, although it was still limited to his spiritual space.

Once he used the primal chaos space’s power, even a Saint didn’t amount much and could only beg for mercy.

At this time, Long Chen was a god looking at the quivering race leader. He then pointed his finger.

BOOM!

The race leader didn’t even get to make a sound before he exploded.
