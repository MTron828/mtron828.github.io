Chapter 2737 Ling Yunzi Arrives

His snow-white robes fluttered in the breeze along with his long facial hair, and he gave off a feeling of the Immortal Dao. However, his gaze was sharp, so sharp that people didn’t dare to look directly at him. Sword-light flowed within his eyes.

After many years, Ling Yunzi’s appearance had changed quite a bit. However, Tang Wan-er and the others still recognized him instantly.

“Junior Ling Yunzi greets seniors.” Ling Yunzi cupped his fists toward everyone. Even the High Priest and Daoist Heavenly Feather rose to greet him.

Ling Yunzi’s aura was ephemeral. They couldn’t sense his true cultivation base. However, it was possible to sense the sharp will of the Sword Dao.

“I’ve long since heard that a peerless genius has appeared within the Heavenly Sword Gate. As someone who cultivates the Annihilation Sword Dao, partially through his own cultivation and partially through the enlightenment of the heavens, he is a genius that has never appeared throughout all of history. Now that we meet, I see that the rumors are all true.” The High Priest looked at Ling Yunzi with admiration. It seemed that he could sense how terrifying the latter was.

Ling Yunzi smiled humbly. “Senior overpraises me. This junior merely had a lucky encounter. It was all thanks to Long Chen. I’m too ashamed to receive this praise.”

“You’re too courteous. Is sect master Heaven Spirit Sword Master well? If I recall correctly, he is my senior. Unfortunately, I’ve never had a chance to pay my respects to him,” said the High Priest.

This startled Meng Qi and the others. Even Daoist Heavenly Feather with her startling seniority called the High Priest senior, yet the High Priest called sect master Heaven Spirit Sword Master as senior? Just what era was this person from?

“Master left this mortal world three months ago. It’s a pity that he was never fated to meet with you,” sighed Ling Yunzi.

“What a shame. If senior was present… Hm, doesn’t that mean that you are this generation’s sword master?” The High Priest’s eyes suddenly widened.

Ling Yunzi nodded. “Junior is ashamed to say that with my pitiful talent, but I don’t dare to betray my master’s expectations. I could only thicken my skin and accept this heavy burden.”

The High Priest and Daoist Heavenly Feather were pleasantly surprised. Ling Yunzi had become this generation’s Heavenly Spirit Sword Master, so they had gained another powerful helper.

“Stop talking around the point. You said that Long Chen won’t die. Is that true?” interrupted the old man.

Ling Yunzi nodded. “Senior, rest at ease. As long as I am still alive, he won’t die.”

“What does that mean?” asked the old man.

Ling Yunzi smiled. “Forgive this junior for not being able to answer. But I believe that the Xuan Master understands.”

Li Tianxuan was startled. “So you…”

Ling Yunzi nodded. “So it wasn’t just me. There’s another. If we are still living well, Long Chen can’t possibly die because this is fate.”

“What nonsense are you two mumbling about?” demanded the old man.

“Let me put it simply. Long Chen won’t die. What we should do is focus on advancing as fast as possible because the battle is quickly approaching. Don’t mention the fact that Long Chen was captured. Even if the other side leaks this news, we can use Long Chen’s clone to fake it,” said Ling Yunzi.

“Sect master, how did you know that Long Chen was captured? Do you have eyes in the divine families?” asked Tang Wan-er. After Evilmoon had given them this news, they had not mentioned it to anyone outside of this room.

“No, the Heavenly Sword Gate is separated from the rest of the world. I have no connection with the divine families. As for how, you will know in the future. I came over specifically for this matter. Do not try to save him. There is no need for unnecessary sacrifices. Other than that, I want to see my apprentice and tell him a few things. Forgive my rudeness. I’ll be leaving first,” said Ling Yunzi. He bowed to the High Priest and the others before taking his leave. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

Ling Yunzi’s arrival gave them a boost in confidence. If both Li Tianxuan and Ling Yunzi were so sure, perhaps there really was no need to worry.

Meng Qi and the others also grew a little calmer. In order to not cause panic, Ling-er controlled Long Chen’s clone, making a few appearances throughout the Martial Heaven Continent to prevent rumors from spreading.

After that, they began refining pills and cultivating once more. Although they were worried about Long Chen, they had no choice but to focus on this.

Since Long Chen’s clone was still present, he had to still be alive. If he died, the wisp of soul essence he had used to create the clone would vanish, causing the clone to crumble.

In order to not worry others, they locked down this information. Right now, all they could do was trust in Long Chen.

Meng Qi and the others refined pills almost crazily. They had Xia Chen set up his strongest formations to absorb the power of these medicinal pills and assist everyone in the Dragonblood Legion in cultivation.

Meng Qi knew that after capturing Long Chen, the divine families would do everything in their power to crash down upon the Martial Heaven Continent as fast as possible. Right now, the only thing they could do to prevent such a thing was to advance as quickly as possible.

Due to refining at such a crazy speed, they ended up with a large stock. Even the old man, Qu Jianying, and a few other trusted seniors were given some pills to power themselves. This was along with some of the more talented disciples of the Martial Heaven Continent.

No one cared what side effects these medicinal pills had. They did everything they could to survive.

All Meng Qi and the others could do was refine these pills. As for the rest, they could only wait and see.

…

“Long Chen, do you still refuse to say anything? Let me tell you, Long Aotian already successfully advanced to the Emperor realm yesterday. Did you hear? He’s already an Emperor…”

The Heaven Executioner taunted Long Chen angrily. It had been twenty days, but he had yet to pry open Long Chen’s mouth. Moreover, he had used up every form of torture he had in his arsenal.

For the first time, the torture skill he had complete confidence in had run into a steelboard. None of his techniques could make Long Chen submit or rattle his will.

Long Chen had countless wounds on his body, but no blood flowed out. That was because almost all his blood had bled out. His face was as pale as paper.

Long Chen looked at the angry Heaven Executioner mockingly. “So what? Does it have anything to do with me?”

“Idiot, do you not know? They will all become Sovereigns soon. At that time, everyone you care about will be killed. Do you want to personally witness it?” sneered the Heaven Executioner.

“You’re the idiot. You’ve used a hundred tricks, and you thought that this would be what rattled me? How naive,” laughed Long Chen.

The Heaven Executioner furiously struck Long Chen’s stomach, causing him to faint.

“Fuck, he pisses me off.”

The Heaven Executioner furiously left as there was no way for him to create an opening in Long Chen’s mind. Even threatening his family didn’t work. As his soul was still unshakeable, there was no way to read his soul.

Long Chen slowly woke up with a sneer on his face. “The flame energy has been gathering for so many days. It should be enough to open the primal chaos bead. Success or failure will be decided by this one move.”
