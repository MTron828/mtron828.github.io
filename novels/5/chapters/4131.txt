Chapter 4120: An Unfortunate Mishap

Long Chen coughed up blood as violent power tore through his body. He felt like millions of volcanoes were exploding inside him at the same time, causing him to almost pass out.

Long Chen then examined his body. Countless tiny cracks had appeared throughout his skin, and blood was oozing out of them.

“Senior, what is going on?!” exclaimed Long Chen.

Fortunately, he had sent Yu Qingxuan away in advance, or she would definitely be distressed to see him like this. Long Chen had almost blown himself up just now.

Originally, before he started cultivating the Dragon Soul Body Forging Art, he had planned on creating a new Seven Star Battle Armor for himself, but the dragon expert then told him that this kind of innovation was extremely difficult. Thus, he started cultivating the Dragon Soul Body Forging Art in order to make it easier. Supposedly, it would protect him from injuries while creating his new Seven Star Battle Armor.

“Senior, speak!”

Long Chen hastily cried out when the dragon expert didn’t reply. What was going on? Was there some mistake?

“Ah… it seems… that…” The dragon expert began to hum and haw for the first time.

“What is it? Didn’t you say that after learning the Dragon Soul Body Forging Art, modifying the Nine Star Hegemon Body Art would be as easy as turning a hand?” asked Long Chen.

Due to cultivating the Dragon Soul Body Forging Art, Long Chen’s physical body had grown to an unimaginable level. In fact, he had gotten so strong with it that he had almost forgotten about the Nine Star Hegemon Body Art.

He had thought of how he was going to modify the Seven Star Battle Armor, but the result was that as soon as the seventh star was touched, a terrifying force almost shattered his body. He was completely dumbfounded. That was completely different from what he had expected.

“Long Chen, don’t get angry. I also didn’t expect this. It seems that the Nine Star Hegemon Body Art has grown along with the Dragon Soul Body Forging Art like a boat rising with the water. In other words… It doesn’t get easier after you train with the Dragon Soul Body Forging Art. Instead…” The dragon expert grew embarrassed.

“It couldn’t be that it got harder, right!?”

“It seems that this is the case,” said the dragon expert awkwardly.

“Senior, how can this be?!” Long Chen almost wept.

Back then, the dragon expert had explicitly said that if he were to change the order of the seven stars, the chance of him blowing himself up would be extremely high, and it would be much safer after cultivating the Dragon Soul Body Forging Art. However, if the difficulty increased instead… Long Chen almost fainted from this revelation.

“Long Chen, your Nine Star Hegemon Body Art is now completely different from the original Nine Star Hegemon Body Art. Its power is actually above my Dragon Soul Body Forging Art. I didn’t expect this. However, don’t panic. It’s hard to learn, but it’s also a good thing! If you can condense your new Seven Star Battle Armor, I guarantee that it will be the strongest Seven Star Battle Armor in history!”

“But I have to succeed first, right?!” Long Chen felt like crying. Only he knew just how difficult it was to condense a new battle armor. Starting from the fifth star, he had deviated from his original cultivation path, setting foot on a path of no return.

After that, while condensing the Six Star Battle Armor, he brushed against death multiple times. So, now that the difficulty had increased even more, Long Chen wasn’t confident about succeeding.

“Don’t panic. Your Seven Star Battle Armor is actually very simple. I’ll help you plan it. You only need to add one central star to the foundation of your Six Star Battle Armor. With the central star as a foundation, you’ll have two triangles spinning in opposite directions, one Yin and one Yang. Like that, the power of the six stars will then gather at the central star. That is the strongest Seven Star Battle Armor. After all, your Six Star Battle Armor already has two triangles layered on top of each other, so changing this foundation shouldn’t be too difficult,” said the dragon expert.

Long Chen was startled. He hadn’t expected the dragon expert’s thought to be the exact same as his.

Although Long Chen had managed to condense the new Six Star Battle Armor, making it stronger than his original Six Star Battle Armor, he always felt like something was missing.

Later on, under the influence of the Seven Treasure Colored Glass Tree, Long Chen suddenly understood. The Six Star Battle Armor was based on two triangle diagrams, but both of those triangles circulated their own power. Although they merged into his body in the end, there was something missing in the middle. What he needed was another star to act as the anchor for the merging energies of both triangles.

With that balance, their energies would stabilize and no longer disperse. With all their energy concentrated in the center, he would be able to unleash their full power.

The previous Six Star Battle Armor was like two pinwheels with no central axis. If he could find a central axis for their power to concentrate on, their energies would no longer scatter. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

“You make it sound so simple, but how am I supposed to find the right center? What star is most suited for the center? Originally, testing them out one by one and comparing them would probably kill me, but now, it will definitely kill me,” said Long Chen unhappily.

“There really is no other way. You’ll need to test it slowly. But I feel like the seventh star has the highest chance of being the best fulcrum!” said the dragon expert.

“I feel the same way. But when I tried it just now, it caused the original seven star diagram to collapse. My body almost collapsed with it,” said Long Chen.

He had managed to condense the most foundational Seven Star Battle Armor. It was a ring with the stars joined together simply.

However, when Long Chen tried to move the Violet Tower Star, the original diagram broke, and a terrifying power almost made him explode. Now, he didn’t dare to touch it anymore.

“Then don’t touch it. Start with the first star,” said the dragon expert.

Long Chen was startled. That was right. Why did he never start with the simplest thing? Why move the strongest star first?

“Hey, wait!”

Long Chen was about to try it when he was drawn out of his meditative state by the dragon expert.

“What is it?”

“Are you stupid? With your body in this state, how can you try it?” demanded the dragon expert.

Long Chen had almost exploded and had yet to recover from his wounds. If something happened again, he would be seeing a Yama King.

Realizing it, Long Chen awkwardly laughed and circulated the primal chaos space’s life energy to recover. The primal chaos space was filled with life energy now, so his body quickly recovered.

When he was done, he summoned the Seven Star Battle Armor once more. At first, he began to move the FengFu Star. When he tore it from the seven star diagram, his body shook intensely. But just as the dragon expert said, moving the first star did not cause as terrifying of a backlash as when he moved the Violet Tower Star.

Although his Blood Qi flipped inside of him and he saw stars spinning, he managed to endure it.

When he moved the third star afterward, it went much smoother. Very quickly, he managed to split the first, third, and fifth stars into one triangle, and the second, fourth, and sixth stars into another triangle.

Following that, they smoothly merged into one. Only the seventh star had yet to move. However, when he moved the seventh star to the six star diagram, all seven stars lit up at once.

“Not good!”

Long Chen’s expression completely changed.
