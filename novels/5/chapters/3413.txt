Chapter 3402 Having Children?

They sat in a restaurant at the core of the city. From here, they could see the majority of the Auspicious Cloud Prefecture’s beautiful scenery.

At a table by the window, Long Chen and Lei Yuner were seated facing each other. Ying Bokong quietly stood at the side.

This restaurant was one of the most famous ones in the Auspicious Cloud Prefecture for its scenery, and the food was also famed for its taste. It was a place only the noble races of the demonic beasts could afford to go to.

Lei Yuner had directly reserved the entire top floor of the restaurant. Now, she chatted with Long Chen, smiling at him.

The food arrived on the table in just a bit. All of them were delicacies of the best ingredients. They were suited to the taste and status of the noble races.

“Why don’t we drink to our common agreement?” said Lei Yuner, raising her cup.

“Do we have a common agreement? How come I didn’t know about that?” Only then did Long Chen stop looking at the beautiful scenery and turn toward Lei Yuner.

“Have we not come to an agreement? You offended the eighth prince of the Mammoth Divine Elephant race. That fellow is famed for his domineering nature. You either have to follow him or perish. He also has many other powers supporting him, and all of those subordinates are experts in their own rights. Now that you’ve offended him, you will most likely die,” said Lei Yuner with a faint smile as if victory was in her grasp.

“Isn’t that all thanks to you?” said Long Chen. He raised his cup and looked at the fine wine indifferently.

“It’s naturally all thanks to me. Follow me and you will quickly start thanking me for this blessing. With my status, position, and talent, I have everything you would want in a partner. Furthermore, I am a woman. If we have children together, they will very likely be able to recover the ancestral bloodline,” said Lei Yuner proudly.

Long Chen was in the midst of tasting the wine when he heard this. As a result, wine spurted out of his nose, and he coughed violently. He then looked at her in disbelief. Her appearance was like a girl that hadn’t fully matured.

“Wasn’t it to be battle comrades? Why are you talking about children?” asked Long Chen speechlessly. Wasn’t this courting a bit too direct?

“Why are you so surprised? People with powerful bloodlines end up together precisely to produce stronger progeny, no?” Lei Yuner looked at him oddly.

Long Chen didn’t recover from his shock for a long time. He finally said, “Does your demonic beast race stay together just to produce progeny?”

“Of course.” Lei Yuner nodded confidently.

Long Chen was speechless for a long time. He had no words. But thinking about it, perhaps that was the difference between the demonic beast race and the human race. Just because they took human form, it didn’t mean that they became humans. They had their own ways of thinking.

Seeing his surprised expression, Lei Yuner suddenly understood. “Oh, I forgot that you aren’t part of the Integral Heaven Star-Field. You don’t understand our demonic beast race. We don’t really have those romantic emotions of your human race. As long as the other side is strong enough and looks pleasing, we can directly start creating future descendants. It’s much more relaxed than you humans. I might have this child with you and have my next child with someone else. You don’t need to feel a burden at all. If you don’t like me, you can also find someone else for your next child. But your human race does have a slight disadvantage. Most children end up following the bloodlines of the mother, so the children end up closer to the mothers. But if you put on a good enough show and are strong enough, I can consider only having children with you,” said Lei Yuner, patting her chest with her own personal guarantee.

Long Chen could only stare at her. Lei Yuner looked like an inexperienced maiden, but she was talking about having children without the slightest embarrassment. This completely toppled Long Chen’s understanding of the world.

“What about the eighth prince of the Mammoth Divine Elephant race? Isn’t his bloodline very powerful? Why not have children with him?” asked Long Chen.

Lei Yuner shook her head. “I loathe that fellow. I won’t allow anyone to be more domineering than me. Those old idiots in my race hope that I have children with him though. They even say that the first child will belong to the Lightning Falcon race, and only the second one will go to the Mammoth Divine Elephant race. But I don’t like him. I actually hate him. I was going to leave after advancing to Divine Lord to find someone else to have children with. But I ran into you. You have thunderforce and true dragon essence blood. Most importantly, you have the blessing of the Butterfly Spirit race and the aura of the rainbow cranes. If I have children with you, they will definitely be blessed by heaven and earth. If you come with me, everyone in my race will definitely fully support it. The Lightning Falcon race will become your strongest backing.”

Lei Yuner looked at Long Chen, her eyes shining. That appearance made Long Chen gulp.

As for Ying Bokong, he stared in shock at Long Chen. He hadn’t known any of this about long Chen. Now, he understood why Lei Yuner would lock onto him and refuse to let go.

Being stared at by Lei Yuner, Long Chen quivered. This was his first time being forced into this state by a beautiful woman. He even had goosebumps.

“Of course, my Lightning Falcon race will not restrict your freedom. As long as you can have a child with me, my Lightning Falcon race will get you anything you want,” continued Lei Yuner, trying to entice him.𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

“Little sister, let’s not discuss this matter. This is a difference between races. Without love as a foundation, if it’s purely for producing future progeny, I cannot accept such a matter.” Long Chen shook his head.

“We can have children first and then consider nurturing our feelings together. Doesn’t your human race have some saying, staying together breeds emotions?” asked Lei Yuner.

“It’s familiarity breeds fondness,” corrected Long Chen speechlessly. The flavor of this saying completely changed when she said it her way.[1]

“It’s about the same. Feelings can be slowly cultivated. You’ve seen my sincerity. Furthermore, you have already offended the Mammoth Divine Elephant race’s eighth prince. Without my protection, you will definitely be killed by him. If you are with me and we join forces, we can directly enter the core of the star-field. We will then be supported by the entire karmic luck of the Integral Heaven Star-Field. It will be a blessed mark. Entering the Divine Lord realm in this state will get you even closer to the Heavenly Daos. With the support of the entire star-field, once you become a Divine Lord, you will even be able to challenge World Kings,” whispered Lei Yuner.

“The support of karmic luck?” Long Chen was finally enticed. On the Honing Heavenly Staircase, Luo Zichuan had said that only part of the Heavenly Daos supported him, and the majority targeted him, resulting in him only being able to absorb a pitifully small amount of Heavenly Dao energy. It might not even be a tenth of what ordinary people could absorb.

If he could obtain the recognition of an entire star-field though, perhaps that could change. He did think that his biggest handicap was the suppression of the Heavenly Daos.

Furthermore, the core of the star-field made him have a thought. The reason he was unable to figure out the second form of Split the Heavens was because the support that the Heavenly Daos could offer him was far from enough. But now, he saw a new hope.

After thinking about it, just as Long Chen was about to speak, they heard footsteps. Lei Yuner then looked at the staircase and her expression changed slightly. Even before the owner of the footsteps arrived, a terrifying pressure already crashed down upon them like a tsunami.

[1] She adds a character to the saying in the middle that makes it sound like having a lot of sex leads to feelings.
