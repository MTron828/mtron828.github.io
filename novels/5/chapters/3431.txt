Chapter 3420 Identity Exposed

Long Chen and the others had just entered the Divine Lord Immortal Realm. Following that, a new group of people entered the empty plaza.

Even the weakest member of this group was a late stage Immortal King, and there were over ten World Kings amongst them. They represented the pillars and leaders of the various large demonic beast races.

Standing in the plaza, they could clearly see specks of light landing within the Divine Lord Immortal Realm. What was happening inside was obvious at a glance.

Amongst these countless experts was a rather small but imposing elder. His face was frighteningly dark. He was the leader of the Lightning Falcon race.

He was aware of Long Chen being targeted. When he learned that the mighty Lightning Falcon race’s princess had been forced to borrow money from all around, he was infuriated. This was clearly a slap in the Lightning Falcon race’s face.

As for the experts of the Mammoth Divine Elephant race, Water Mallard race, Golden Barbarian Bull race, Blue Eye Bright Scale race, and the others, they were smiling sinisterly.

The Lightning Falcon race’s leader finally understood that his race had long since been targeted. As for the proposed marriage from the Mammoth Divine Elephant race, it definitely had some scheme lying within it. Their goal was very likely to ruin the genius that was Lei Yuner.

Long Chen’s arrival had caused them to put their plan into place ahead of time. Now, they were starting to suppress the Lightning Falcon race.

Although he was no genius, even a fool would be able to see that if all these races were suddenly targeting the Lightning Falcon race, they must have been planning it for a long time.

“What a pity. That Long fellow is going to die young. He’ll never get to be the Lightning Falcon race’s son-in-law. The place he landed at is truly unfortunate.” A sinister voice rang out, clearly targeting the Lightning Falcon race.

This voice came from a wizened tall elder holding a snake-head cane. His eyes were blue-green. He was the leader of the Blue Eye Bright Scale race.

The reason he was mocking him was because the light representing Long Chen had fallen very close to the heavenly genius of their Blue Eye Bright Scale race.

After being transported into the Divine Lord Immortal Realm, every speck of light representing them also had a particular mark on their tablet, which made it quite easy for people to recognize them.

Thus, they could clearly see that the specks of light representing Long Chen and the man from the Blue Eye Bright Scale race had fallen in almost the exact same place.

“Fool, you’re targeting that little fellow without knowing just how strong he is? Can someone chosen by Yuner possibly be an ordinary man?” sneered the Lightning Falcon race’s leader.

He had tested Long Chen’s physical body, so he knew just how powerful it was.

“Hahaha, even if he has a powerful physical body, so what? Can a little human compete with the demonic beast race? Oh, I forgot, your Lightning Falcon race’s physical bodies are actually below average amongst demonic beasts. My apologies!” sneered the Blue Eye Bright Scale race’s leader.

There was quite a bloody enmity between the two of them. The Blue Eye Bright Scale race was the main leader of the scaled beast race, while the Lightning Falcon race was the main leader of the flying beast race. Originally, the two were equally matched, but then due to the Water Mallard race leaving the flying beast race’s side and bringing a few others with them, the flying beast race ended up at a disadvantage. That was why there was so much hatred between the Lightning Falcon race and the Water Mallard race.

The Sacred Pill Hall’s people were also present, but they were simply watching this war of words without interfering. At least titularly, the Sacred Pill Hall didn’t participate in those battles.

“Not good! Palace master, we’ve finally investigated who this Boss Long San is! He is…”

At this moment, an expert from the Sacred Pill Hall came running in hurriedly. As soon as he appeared, the experts of the demonic beasts turned toward him.

“Who is he?!” The hall master’s heart clenched. A bad feeling rose within him.

“He is… he is the High Firmament Academy’s seventh branch academy’s dean, Long Chen!”

“What nonsense! The High Firmament Academy no longer has any branch academies!” 

“Just a few months ago, this Long Chen reclaimed the seventh branch academy. That’s how he became the dean,” reported that person.

“Excellent. It really is a case of there being a path to the heavens, and yet he still forced his way into hell. Lock down the entire Auspicious Cloud Prefecture! Hmph, those useless pieces of trash in the Bloodkill Hall couldn’t even deal with him. We won’t let Long Chen get away!” snorted the hall master.

“Yes!”

Following that, chains appeared in the air, weaving together into a giant formation that completely sealed this space. This grand formation gave even World Kings a sense of immense pressure.

At that moment, everyone’s expression changed. They finally sensed something off.

The High Firmament Academy was the oldest academy within the nine heavens and ten lands. Even the demonic beast race had heard of its name.

So, they had never dreamed that this human that they looked down upon was actually a dean from the High Firmament Academy.

Although they didn’t know much about the High Firmament Academy, they did know that the High Firmament Academy was enemies with the god that the Sacred Pill Hall worshiped, Lord Brahma. Who would have thought that someone from the High Firmament Academy would muddle his way into this place?

“Hmph, what dean? It’s just an empty title. The talented disciples of my race can easily kill him in the same realm. Everyone, just watch,” sneered the leader of the Blue Eye Bright Scale race arrogantly.

However, those familiar with him could tell that his smile was forced. This was a smile to cover up his shock and unease.

That man from the Blue Eye Bright Scale race had landed in the same place as Long Chen. Both of them saw each other, and with a furious roar, they clashed.

BOOM!Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

A huge explosion erupted. The two of them were entirely unaware that they were currently being watched by countless eyes.

The earth crumbled. After that, the man from the Blue Eye Bright Scale race flew back with a painful grunt. His arm had exploded.

His physical body was very powerful. Although it didn’t reach the same level as the Mammoth Divine Elephant race, amongst demonic beasts, in terms of just physical bodies, he could definitely enter the top ten within the Integral Heaven Star-Field.

He had been planning on using this immense power to quickly injure Long Chen in one blow. Fighting in terms of physical strength was to his advantage in his mind. However, he hadn’t expected to be the one blown back and injured.

After feeling a mix of shock and anger, runes suddenly appeared in his eyes. His Blood Qi instantly soared.

Just as he wanted to use his innate divine abilities, no divine ability appeared. Instead, two fingers stabbed through his eyes, and his miserable scream resounded throughout heaven and earth.

“What?!”

All the experts watching were stunned. As for the leader of the Blue Eye Bright Scale race, a vein throbbed on his forehead.
