Chapter 3367 Changgong Hao

Atop a soft bed, Long Chen caressed Leng Yueyan’s silky skin. Looking at her beautiful face which was just like a jade statue, Long Chen felt like he was the most blessed man alive.

She was beautiful, arrogant, and could not be blasphemed. But she was still in his embrace. After showing their love for each other, he slept better than he ever had.

Even after waking up, he stayed still, afraid of startling awake this sleeping beauty, as if he might wake up from a dream.

However, when he looked at his body which was covered in sharp teeth marks that still vaguely hurt, he knew that he wasn’t dreaming.

“It’s only been a few hours. Are you not going to sleep longer?”

Leng Yueyan smiled beautifully, but she didn’t open her eyes. She continued to rest her head on Long Chen’s arm.

“I feel like sleeping is a waste of time. I’d rather spend my time looking at you.” Long Chen smiled.

“If you keep looking at me, aren’t you afraid that you’ll get tired of it eventually?” Leng Yueyan opened her eyes. Her sapphire eyes were like stars in the night sky, pure yet also bewitching, beautiful yet dangerous.

“How could that happen? I’ll never get tired of you,” said Long Chen.

“Why don’t you have the auras of others on you? Have you not done this with them after all this time?” asked Leng Yueyan curiously.

“Isn’t it because there’s never been a chance?” said Long Chen somewhat helplessly. When it came to doing intimate acts, he had only done it with Leng Yueyan and Ming Cangyue.

However, those two times on the Martial Heaven Continent could barely be counted, because those were forced. As for during his Netherpassage breakthrough, he had only entered the Netherworld in Yuan Spirit form. It could be said that in terms of truly doing this intimate act, this was the first.

This time, it was carried out mutually. It was a merger of spirits and bodies.

“These sisters of mine really are adorably foolish. I couldn’t do the same as them. My man is mine.”

Leng Yueyan stood and her beautiful curves appeared before Long Chen in their entirety, causing his heart to pound wildly. Leng Yueyan’s attraction was truly fatal, especially in such a situation.

Seeing him like that, she smiled slightly. She then raised her arms, and black runes condensed around her, forming a black dress. Her bone sword also appeared on her back. In this dress, she seemed to have returned to her cold indifference.

Only then did Long Chen realize that these clothes were connected to the laws of this world. When she put on these clothes, she became the master of this world. Laws were emotionless. That was why she seemed so indifferent. It was like she had become a part of the Heavenly Daos. In this state, she truly was a god, an existence that could not be blasphemed.

Looking at Leng Yueyan, Long Chen suddenly smiled. That smile was rather wretched.

Leng Yueyan seemed to have seen through his thoughts and said, “That thinking of yours is very dangerous. But it’s not outside the realm of possibility. It’s just that… you must have the power to conquer me, or you will forever be conquered.”

“I feel like I can work hard at it.” Long Chen smiled. Leng Yueyan was like an untamable horse. But the more that she couldn’t be tamed, the more he felt an intense desire to.

Long Chen put on his clothes. Holding each other’s hands, they came to the top of the castle. They then saw millions of experts working hard at fletching arrows.

As Leng Yueyan waved her hand, an arrow appeared in front of Long Chen. When he received it, he exclaimed, “What skill! Your people were actually able to add so many runes.”

Although Long Chen wasn’t too familiar with this process, he saw seven different runes on this arrow. After being with Guo Ran and Xia Chen for so long, although he didn’t understand these runes, he could differentiate that these people had added explosiveness, destructiveness, silentness, and other powers to the arrow.

The normal Wood Foundation Divine Trees arrows were already naturally silent. Hence, by adding these attributes, their power greatly increased. Leng Yueyan’s subordinates actually possessed such refined forging arts.

“Among my followers are some who come from a race specialized in archery. They only recently joined me. Due to a lack of resources, they haven’t been able to show off their skill. But the Wood Foundation Divine Trees you provided made them cry from emotion. They didn’t have good bows or arrows, so they had no chance to show their skills before. But now, they finally have a chance to equip themselves. Their entire race is full of divine archers, but due to offending other powers, they ended up with nowhere to go and fled in every direction. In the end, I decided that I didn’t dislike them, so I permitted them to join me, becoming my followers. But even then, they had no chance to grow. Others have been looking down on them, and they’ve had to suffer quite a bit during this time. Now it seems that they can finally vent. Look, that fellow is coming,” said Leng Yueyan.

An elder of medium build but exceptionally robust walked over. His arms were particularly thick and had natural marks on them. Long Chen was startled. Could it be that those marks were from archery? This was a natural archer?

“Changgong Hao greets the divine master and the divine master’s consort.” The elder knelt toward the two of them.

“Divine master’s consort?”

Long Chen almost coughed up blood. His expression immediately changed and Leng Yueyan couldn’t help laughing.

“Hey, you can call me Boss Long San, and never call me a consort again,” ordered Long Chen severely.

When had he become a consort? If that status became set in stone, how would he face the rest of the world? If Mo Nian were to learn of it, would Long Chen not be laughed at for a lifetime?

“Uh…” The elder looked at Leng Yueyan. Leng Yueyan held back her laughter and waved her hand. “Just listen to him.”

“Changgong Hao greets Boss Long San.” The elder once more kowtowed toward Long Chen.

Long Chen lifted him up. “In the future, you can just do that to the divine master. Don’t do it to me. I don’t like it.”

“Yes, Boss Long San. Whatever you say, I will do. I was so bold as to come here because I wanted to thank you. Our Longbow race lives for archery. But by my generation, we have declined to the absolute bottom and are bullied by other races. If it wasn’t for the protection of the divine master, my Longbow race would have been destroyed. My Longbow race will never be able to repay the divine master’s kindness…” Changgong Hao[1] grew more and more emotional as he spoke. He managed to get out some words of gratitude as he shed tears at the same time. In the end, he took out a longbow and offered it up with both hands.

“This is the wooden bow I made just now. Boss Long San, please give me pointers.”
