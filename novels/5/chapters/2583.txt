Chapter 2572 One Person Blocks the Path

The entrance to the Yin Yang World had lost all its barriers. There was no one defending it, and the various blockades were gone. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

Long Chen and Daoist Heavenly Feather stood in front of the entrance and calmly watched as the Blood race’s army appeared. They slowly pressed forward. As they advanced, it was possible to see an endless tide of them continuing to appear.

Even though Long Chen had seen the Heaven Devouring Black Armor Corps in the Star Field Divine World, he was still stunned by the sight before him. The Blood race truly had many experts.

Those experts were all elites amongst elites. Every one of them had soaring Blood Qi. Even from this distance, their auras were terrifying.

“The Blood race has finished gathering their army. They are just waiting for the Sovereign seal to fully vanish. Now the battle is going to start, and the burden on your shoulders is not light,” said Daoist Heavenly Feather solemnly.

“It doesn’t feel too bad. It’s not that much pressure.” Long Chen smiled slightly.

“You aren’t a Sovereign. You cannot lead the thousands of races. The forces loyal to you are limited. Moreover, you not only need to face the invaders, but you also have to be on guard against scheming enemies within the continent. It can be said that you are at the heart of the struggle. Any other person would break down if they were in your position. However, even under this pressure, you don’t have those negative emotions. I’m curious, how did you do this?” Daoist Heavenly Feather looked at Long Chen inquisitively.

She was an existence that had lived for countless years. She had witnessed countless figures rising and falling. Her vision was extremely sharp. However, from the very start, she had never been able to see through Long Chen.

Long Chen was sometimes extremely smart, yet often did inexplicably foolish things. He was sometimes domineering and callous, yet sometimes carefree and humorous. He could go from laughing to raising his saber and killing in the next instant. He had an emotional side, yet also an emotionless side.

Thinking about it, if she was in his position, she would definitely be anxious and panicking. However, Long Chen still seemed unaffected. It was as if the endless army of the Blood race was nothing. She couldn’t help being curious.

“Negative emotions?” Long Chen laughed. “Perhaps it’s because my luck has always been terrible. If I wasn’t able to keep my mood up myself, I probably wouldn’t have lived to today. I can’t rely on luck. I can only rely on my own power to fight for things. That’s probably what resulted in my attitude of fighting to the death. In any case, everyone born in this world will not be leaving it alive. Having a group of beauties and hot-blooded brothers accompanying me, I’ve already gotten a great deal from this life. As long as I think of them, those negative emotions are expelled in an instant.”

Long Chen’s smile was very warm. Life was beautiful but not perfect. However, the family he had made for himself gave him endless drive. Because he had them, he had the confidence to face any challenge.

The Blood race’s army gradually got closer. When they saw Long Chen and Daoist Heavenly Feather, they slowly paused, staring at them.

“Call out your leader to speak with me!” shouted Long Chen thunderously.

“The Martial Heaven Continent is about to be destroyed, and yet you still act so arrogantly? The human race really is foolish.”

An elder of the Blood race stepped forward, sneering. The elder looked withered, but his Blood Qi was astonishing. His power caused the void to rumble around him.

This was definitely a terrifying expert, someone on par with a Heaven Merging expert of the Martial Heaven Continent. He gave off astonishing pressure.

However, even this elder didn’t dare to step too far forward in the face of Long Chen and Daoist Heavenly Feather.

“The Blood race can use their bloodline power to sense other people’s power. I can suppress my spiritual fluctuations, but they can still sense my bloodline fluctuations to estimate my cultivation base,” said Daoist Heavenly Feather.

So that was the case. Daoist Heavenly Feather was able to hide her cultivation base from everyone on the Martial Heaven Continent, but she was unable to conceal it from this elder of the Blood race.

However, based on the elder’s restraint in the face of Daoist Heavenly Feather, it seemed that he wasn’t a match for her. That made Long Chen feel much more at ease.

“You’re the foolish ones. You’ve repeatedly tried to invade the Martial Heaven Continent, but have you ever succeeded? Weren’t you always kicked back like stray dogs in the end?” sneered Long Chen.

Long Chen swaggered over to the Blood race, standing not too far from them. He pointed at them, tilting his head back and extremely arrogantly saying, “In my eyes, your Blood race is nothing more than trash. I challenge you right now. Anyone who doesn’t like what I’m saying can come out and fight me. In the same realm, I will fight with one hand behind my back.”

As Long Chen spoke, the old man, Qu Jianying, and the others finally arrived. Due to having to sit through transportation formations, they were a bit slower.

When they arrived, their expressions changed. They were about to give the order for their forces to gather when Daoist Heavenly Feather stopped them.

“Leave things to Long Chen.”

More and more of the Martial Heaven Continent’s experts began to arrive. Seeing Long Chen standing in front of the army of millions and millions of the Blood race’s experts, they all felt their hearts beating wildly in their chests.

Long Chen had one hand behind his back, while his other hand pointed at the Blood race. His posture was exceedingly arrogant.

The Blood race’s experts were immediately infuriated. The elder narrowed his eyes, staring at Long Chen and seemingly calculating something.

“I’ll challenge you.”

A large expert of the Blood race suddenly stepped forward. This was a large expert. He was three meters tall but even wider than he was tall. Wielding a golden warhammer, from a distance, he looked like a short-legged toad. His head was barren of any hair, but his muscles were extremely shocking.

His veins looked like saplings covering his body. Blood Qi soared out of him along with golden light.

This golden light was a mist that came out of his body due to his blood flowing so rapidly through him.

“Dauntless Blood branch, ranked top ten within my branch ten years ago and now eighty-sixth in the Eighth Wild Battle Army. Report your name,” shouted the large man of the Blood race.

“Me? Hahaha, are you ready? Don’t piss yourself when you hear my name.”

Long Chen suddenly laughed and pointed at himself with his thumb. “I am Long Chen from the Martial Heaven Continent’s Eastern Wasteland’s Phoenix Cry Empire. I learned literature at three, started training in martial arts at four, and mastered poetry at five. Before ten, I swept through the Martial Heaven Continent and retreated from the cultivation world ten years later. Today, the sudden change in the world has drawn me out of my seclusion. The heavens collapse from a single punch, the earth shatters with a kick. When I swept through the continent, countless enemies lay beneath my feet…”

Hearing Long Chen’s bragging, Daoist Heavenly Feather was dumbfounded. She then shook her head. Youngsters really did have too much energy. Even at such a time, he was in the mood for such a thing.

“Shut up! Who would believe such bragging? What rank are you?” demanded the large man. Even he realized that Long Chen was just conning him.

“My rank? Oh, I’m ranked three thousand seven hundred and nine,” answered Long Chen obediently.

“Die!” The large man roared furiously. His Blood Qi erupted, and he smashed his warhammer at Long Chen.

Long Chen snorted and Evilmoon appeared in his hand. As he sneered, Evilmoon suddenly stabbed behind him rapidly.

The void exploded, revealing an almost invisible elder behind Long Chen with Evilmoon stabbing through his chest. The elder then stared at the blade stabbing his chest in disbelief.

The Martial Heaven Continent’s experts were all shocked to realize that the Blood race had been scheming against Long Chen.

BOOM!

Just at that moment, Evilmoon shuddered and explosive power ripped through the elder, blasting him into a bloody mist.

At the same time, the large man’s warhammer reached Long Chen. Long Chen only unleashed a simple punch to receive it.

His scale-covered fist made the warhammer explode on contact. The large man shuddered intensely. Half his body crumpled, while the remaining half of him tumbled back.

In an instant, one died, and the other was badly injured. The most shocking thing was that the elder that Long Chen had just killed had unleashed his aura just as he died, revealing that he was an existence matching a Heaven Merging expert.

“You said that the human race were fools, but it seems that you’re the real fools. You want to play this kind of game with me? One fellow draws my attention, while another sneak attacks me, going so far as to even wanting to capture me alive instead of killing me. You really are ambitious.” Long Chen rested Evilmoon on his shoulder and sneered.

The Blood race didn’t have the human race’s magical arts, but they did have their own unique bloodline divine abilities.

This elder had used one of those divine abilities to conceal himself. It was an extremely rare ability within the Blood race. He had thought that he would be able to easily capture Long Chen. However, he had never imagined that Long Chen’s Nine Star Hegemon Body Art was most sensitive toward this kind of sneak attack.

Even without the Nine Star Hegemon Body Art, there was no way he could have approached Long Chen secretly. Long Chen had azure dragon essence blood flowing within his body, making him sensitive toward other bloodlines. To approach him in secret was a joke.

If that elder had faced him directly, Long Chen wouldn’t have been fully confident in beating him. But that fellow had been courting death, so Long Chen helped him out.

“Despicable human race, your ranking can’t possibly be that low! You’re a liar!” The large man crawled up from the ground. The part of his body that had been destroyed had yet to recover, but he still pointed and cursed at Long Chen.

Long Chen snickered, “I didn’t lie. In terms of height, my rank amongst the Martial Heaven Continent’s experts is three thousand seven hundred and nine.”

The large man suddenly coughed up a mouthful of blood and collapsed. He died.

Suddenly, the void split open, and a blood-colored spear pierced toward Long Chen with immense divine power. A voice resounded throughout heaven and earth.

“The trash human race has no right to be arrogant! Die!”
