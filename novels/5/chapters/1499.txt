Chapter 1494 Just a Bit Off

Translator: BornToBe

Dragonbone Evilmoon slashed heavily onto Ye Qingkuang’s Steel Coiling Dragon Staff. Ye Qingkuang’s arms were instantly broken, and the Steel Coiling Dragon Staff smashed into his own body. Blood spurted out of him. His body cracked like porcelain and almost exploded.

Ye Qingkuang smashed into the ground. It was unknown if he was alive or dead.

This attack of Long Chen’s hadn’t just contained his own power, but also some of Sha Guangyan and Peng Wansheng’s. It was incredibly powerful.

Most terrifying of all was that this attack had not been a Battle Skill. He hadn’t accumulated any energy or shown any signs of using it. Sha Guangyan and Peng Wansheng hadn’t even had a chance to warn Ye Qingkuang before Long Chen’s attack struck.

However, as for Long Chen himself, at the same time as he sent Ye Qingkuang flying, his back was struck by Peng Wansheng and Sha Guangyan’s weapons.

The sound of bones breaking came from his back, and he also coughed up blood and was blown into the distance. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

He had exchanged injury for injury, but it had been planned. Having borrowed and canceled out part of their power, Long Chen got struck by less than thirty percent of it.

That was why he had dared to take their attacks on his back. But divine items were still divine items, and even when they weren’t releasing their divine might, they heavily injured him.

However, he didn’t mind. The life energy within the primal chaos space poured through his body, rapidly healing him.

“Oh? So the power contained within divine items is actually this difficult to expel.” Long Chen found that these injuries required much more energy to heal. Furthermore, they took several times as long.

Fortunately, his injuries weren’t that grave. Although he didn’t instantly heal, his injuries were suppressed quickly and didn’t affect his movements.

Lightning wings appeared on Long Chen’s back and he flew toward the one who had smashed into the ground, Ye Qingkuang.

Injuring ten fingers wasn’t as good as severing one finger. That was why he had taken the risk to exchange injury for injury. He wanted to kill Ye Qingkuang to remove one of his three opponents.

The three of them were all Empyreans, and they had advanced to Soul Transformation. Furthermore, they were holding three divine items, and so Long Chen’s weapon advantage was nonexistent. When surrounded by the three of them, the slightest mistake would cause him to lose his life, so eliminating one of them as fast as possible was the key to victory.

Sha Guangyan and Peng Wansheng were delighted that their weapons had landed. They expected Long Chen to be heavily injured, allowing them to kill him with the next blow.

However, they quickly saw that Long Chen was still lively and rushing straight toward Ye Qingkuang.

“Stop him! If any of you dies, the other two will definitely die as well! Within the five-colored lightning, no one can save you-” Ye Qingkuang’s elder shouted from a distance.

Buzz.

Before he could finish speaking, a bolt of five-colored lightning struck him.

It was like divine retribution. The world froze, and no one dared to move, including the experts from the carriages.

The elder exploded on contact with the lightning.

Everyone’s hearts shook. That had been a peak Life Star expert, and he had been killed in one blow.

The five-colored lightning’s power was based on the provoker. Clearly, this elder’s shouting had been captured by the Heavenly Daos and was treated as a provocation of the heavens, resulting in this terrifying blow.

After that terrifying attack, everyone felt suffocated and panted crazily.

The door to the carriage was opened, and a large figure walked out once more. It was the elder who had just been slain by the five-colored lightning.

“It was actually a substitute art.” Some people saw through the clues. No wonder this elder had dared to give a warning.

He had used his substitute art while his true body hid in the carriage. The carriage had a heaven-cheating formation around it to screen off the heavens. So although the substitute was killed, the main body was safe in the carriage.

However, this elder’s face was now slightly pale. Clearly, the loss of his substitute came with a price.

However, it had been worth it. Through his warning, Sha Guangyan and Peng Wansheng realized just how dire their current situation was. Peng Wansheng flapped his wings and instantly vanished, reappearing in front of Long Chen and attacking with his halberd.

“Scram!” shouted Long Chen. His injuries had mostly healed, and Evilmoon hacked down like a bolt of black lightning.

BOOM!

Peng Wansheng’s halberd shook violently, and he was sent flying. In terms of power, he was not even close to Long Chen.

After blowing him away, Long Chen continued to go after Ye Qingkuang. He could see him covered in blood and terrified.

Long Chen’s first attack had almost killed him. Now he was using his Heavenly Dao energy to heal, but he was horrified to find that his injuries had some kind of evil energy in them. It was like a curse, constantly worsening his injuries.

This energy came from Dragonbone Evilmoon’s innate will to slaughter. Because it had slaughtered too many lifeforms, it had been infected with endless resentment.

As an ancient, evil weapon, it had existed for countless years and had lived for slaughter. Its attacks naturally contained endless resentment. To be injured by it was to be invaded by all that resentment.

This resentment was the resentment of all the lifeforms that had been slain by it. It was like a curse.

Ye Qingkuang’s Heavenly Dao energy was going all-out to heal himself, but this terrifying resentment made the healing process too slow. He still couldn’t move and definitely couldn’t receive Long Chen’s next attack.

Now he was terrified as he looked at Long Chen. His body quivered as he prepared to block, but he knew that this block would be useless.

“Earthen Borders!”

In the distance, Sha Guangyan had landed on the ground at some unknown time and stabbed his broadsword into the earth.

Huge earthen swords soared out of the ground, shooting at Long Chen.

“Split the Heavens 4!” A huge saber-image slashed through these earthen swords.

The swords exploded, but just as the saber-image was about to reach Ye Qingkuang, the ground split open, and a large hand slammed out.

The hand exploded, while the saber-image created a bottomless ditch in the ground. Ye Qingkuang had vanished.

“You want to beat us one by one? Too bad, we won’t let you.” Sha Guangyan sneered in the distance. Ye Qingkuang was by his side. He had used some sort of secret art to summon two defensive moves at once and save Ye Qingkuang.

“Many thanks.” Ye Qingkuang had long since lost his original arrogance. If it hadn’t been for Peng Wansheng and Sha Guangyan’s interference, this world would no longer have a Ye Qingkuang in it.

As an Empyrean, he had never imagined a day where he would be killed by someone. But today, he had almost died. Thinking about it gave him chills.

Long Chen rested Evilmoon on his shoulder and looked at them with a cold smile. Under the endless torrent of lightning, his expression was still calm. “If I can’t beat you one by one, I don’t mind beating you all together.”

Long Chen had long since gotten used to the heaven-defying karmic luck of heavenly geniuses. Killing them was truly difficult. Their luck was always so good.

Yet, he trusted that you couldn’t survive off luck. If he couldn’t kill his opponent, he couldn’t blame their luck. He could only blame himself for not being strong enough. If he was strong enough to kill them in one blow, then no matter how great their luck was, it would still be nonsense.

“Ye Qingkuang, focus on healing. Long Chen’s difficult to handle, and we’ll need to work together. Furthermore, we have to kill him before the tribulation reaches its strongest state. Otherwise, who knows what will happen,” said Sha Guangyan.

Right now, Ye Qingkuang was the only one that could compete with Long Chen in terms of power. Without him, there was no chance of them killing Long Chen.

Sha Guangyan’s voice now contained some worry. He found that the lightning was growing stronger and stronger. The five-colored lightning was difficult to endure, and if it continued growing stronger, it would gravely affect their fighting power. What made them feel the most helpless was that their Heavenly Dao runes were ineffective against this five-colored lightning.

Long Chen simply stood there with no intention to attack again. Ye Qingkuang was quickly healing. Having lost the chance to kill him, Long Chen wouldn’t be given another chance. After all, they were peak experts, and they wouldn’t make the same mistake twice.

The four of them simply stared at each other. The people watching felt like a boulder was crushing their hearts. This battle was absolutely terrifying, so terrifying that they almost couldn’t believe that what they were witnessing was reality.

As more time passed, the lightning transformed into huge spheres that fell from the sky and exploded like bombs.

Each sphere was three hundred meters wide and was like a raindrop, but they created huge pits in the ground.

“Attack!” Suddenly, Sha Guangyan, Peng Wansheng, and Ye Qingkuang attacked at the same time. It seemed they wanted to settle victory or defeat right here and now.
