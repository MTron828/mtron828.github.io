Although the first group of disciples retreated instantly, some of them were still killed by the divine palace’s sudden attack. As for Xiong Tianba, he had been at the front, and his arm was wiped out of existence.

“What is going on?! How did Long Chen pass?!” Xiong Tianba let out a furious roar. Not only was his arm gone, but the remnant divine energy was suppressing his healing abilities and attempting to destroy the rest of his body.

They had just seen Long Chen walk in, but now they were blocked by the divine light. Xiong Tianba felt like he might explode out of fury. Was the Brahma Divine Palace also a bully?

What they didn’t know was that the reason Long Chen could enter was because the palace’s divine pressure had provoked the primal chaos bead’s power.

However, they were unable to sense the power of the primal chaos bead. All they had seen was that the Brahma Divine Palace had tried to scare Long Chen with its divine pressure, and having failed to scare him, it had simply let him waltz right in.

When it came to them though, they weren’t treated the same. The palace wasn’t just trying to scare them, it was really killing them. If they hadn’t retreated fast enough, even more of them would have been killed.

The most incomprehensible thing about it was that Long Chen was Pill Valley’s mortal enemy. He had destroyed his way to the Brahma Divine Palace, even taking the two guarding statues, but the Brahma Divine Palace had just let him be. But as for obedient people like them, it refused to allow them in. Just where was heaven’s reason?

“Didn’t someone just now say that it was impossible for Long Chen to enter, and that they would eat the palace if he could get in? I want to see it,” demanded someone sinisterly.

Before this, a disciple from Pill Valley had said that if Long Chen could enter the Brahma Divine Palace, he would eat it. Now that his words were brought up once more, his face burned. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

“Go and eat. We already have photographic jades ready. Your name is about to shake the cosmos. What are you hesitating for?”

“It couldn’t have been bragging, right? Could it be that Pill Valley’s disciples have no skills other than conning others?”

More people joined in on the jeering. The so-called core region, the so-called barrier breaking beads, the so-called curse of the gods, they were all just one lie after another. They had all been exposed by Long Chen.

Pill Valley’s sinister schemes had been fully exposed. All the good opportunities within the Brahma secret realm had long since been reserved, but they had still used them to trick the neutral camp’s experts onto their side.

Without Long Chen exposing all this, anyone who fell for it would be stuck in Pill Valley’s shameless trap. Their fury had long since been brewing, and now it was unleashed on the disciples of Pill Valley here.

“Bullshit, do you think you’re even qualified to enter the Brahma secret realm normally?! We didn’t even ask you for anything, but we let you in for free! Hmph, thankless ingrates, have some shame!” shouted that disciple of Pill Valley.

That only added fuel to the fire. At this time, ninety-nine percent of the disciples that had entered the secret realm had been drawn over to this location. Of those people, there had been a portion prepared to use the barrier breaking beads to enter the core region.

The bait had just been too enticing. The difference in the Grand Dao energy between the core region and the outer regions was immense, enough to shake their hearts. Then adding on the possible inheritance lands and the legendary eleventh tier medicinal pill, the core region had possessed a fatal attraction.

However, once Long Chen opened a path for them to enter for free, they found that other than the density of the Grand Dao energy, the rest was all nonsense.

The main reason people had wanted to enter was for the promised opportunities. But those were kept from them. After being played like that, their fury soared.

“Fuck you! You might have let us in for free, but do you think we don’t know your intentions?!”

“You think we’re idiots?! This is all Pill Valley’s trap! You wanted to use the Brahma secret realm to turn us into your fighters. How vicious!”

“If it weren’t for senior apprentice-brother Long Chen, who knows how many people would have fallen for this con? I really don’t understand how Pill Valley can be so malicious.”

More and more experts began to curse Pill Valley. They had almost lost their futures because of this, so they were filled with resentment.

That disciple from Pill Valley’s expression sank. How could he talk back against so many people? He raged, “Shut up! If you knew it was a trap, why did you jump in? You can only blame yourselves for being stupid! There are no free lunches in this world, but since you came to eat, you have to pay! Even if there was bait, you willingly took it!”

Hearing him say this, Di Feng frowned. This disciple’s brain definitely wasn’t screwed on right. Perhaps he had spent so much time refining pills that he had refined his head into mush.

As expected, after a moment of furious silence, it was like a volcano had erupted. Those disciples began to shout with even greater fury.

“Hahaha, do you see? This is Pill Valley’s true face! They tricked us with bait and then left the good stuff for their own people! These words came straight out of Pill Valley’s genius disciple, so remember them!” shouted an expert from the neutral camp.

“Hmph, it’s all recorded. I’ll even give you copies of this photographic jade. Hopefully, it can spread throughout the world so that everyone can see Pill Valley’s true face,” said one expert, holding up a photographic jade.

The face of that disciple immediately turned white. He had only been yelling some angry words. Although they were the truth, such things couldn’t be said out loud. This was equivalent to admitting to everything. He hastily said, “I was just caught up in a fit of rage. You can’t take it as true...”

“A fit of rage? Don’t worry about it. Things that people say in a rage are always true, and what we wanted was the truth,” sneered someone.

“I...” That disciple suddenly coughed up blood.

Pill Valley definitely couldn’t admit to such a thing. To appease people’s anger, they would have to pay quite a bit of compensation and set up a scapegoat to take the blame. Now it seemed that he was about to take the position of scapegoat. This was what the expression ‘trouble comes from the mouth’ meant.

“Coughing up blood to look pitiful? I’ll tell you, that’s useless,” said a disciple.

However, at this moment, another disciple said, “Now isn’t the time to fight. Long Chen has cut down the divine pillars, evening out the distribution of the Grand Dao energy. Let’s hurry and absorb it. Since we’re already here, we can’t waste this chance.”

The speaker was the Yin Yang Sword Sect’s Lu Zichuan. He had previously been on one of the divine pillars. Although his words were very reasonable, he was clearly on the side of Pill Valley.

The meaning was that the process wasn’t important. The real important thing was that everyone was benefiting. If they could awaken their manifestations, it would be a huge celebration. Why bother quibbling about the process?

Through this reminder, those experts shut their mouths and spread out, once more attuning themselves to the dense grand Dao energy in the air.

After this much time, Xiong Tianba’s arm had managed to grow out again, but he no longer had the courage to charge into the Brahma Divine Palace.

“Truly absurd.”

Looking at the gates to the palace, Xiong Tianba and Leng Wufeng both said the same thing.

What kind of logic was it that allowed Long Chen to enter the Brahma Divine Palace after plundering, destroying, and being so disrespectful, yet they were looked outside? Even Pill Valley’s people were refused.

Although such logic should not exist in this world, no one dared to go argue with the Brahma Divine Palace about it.

People could only sigh. Other than envy, they also felt admiration for Long Chen. He definitely wasn’t human. He had to be a monster.

Everyone surrounded the Brahma Divine Palace. The Grand Dao energy was the densest around it. It was like a whirlpool, and this place was the optimal cultivation region.

...

The gates slammed shut behind Long Chen. He was within a vast and empty room, the sound of the doors slamming still echoing.

“Evilmoon, was I a bit too impulsive?”

“Is there a time when you aren’t impulsive?” retorted Evilmoon.

Evilmoon couldn’t focus on just absorbing the energy of the divine pillars. It had to split its attention and was now also keeping watch over what was happening on Long Chen’s side. It was prepared to come help him at any moment.

At the center of the giant room was a throne with a man seated on it. It was another statue.

There were no divine runes on this statue, but as soon as Long Chen saw it, his hair stood on end. He felt like a pair of sharp eyes were locked onto him.

“Lord Brahma.”
