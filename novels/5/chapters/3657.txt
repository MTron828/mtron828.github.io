Chapter 3646 Attaching the Bone

Guo Ran was even angrier than Xia Chen. Although he had also been bullied in the Heavenly Dragon Divine Armor College, that was simply because the cultivation world was like that. There were too many wolves and not enough meat to go around. With a limited amount of resources, if you wanted them, you had to fight for them.

However, the pavilion master Gongsun Xuan had schemed against Xia Chen with his granddaughter, harming someone who had shown favor to the Spirit Rune Pavilion. It was absolutely vile.

The most unacceptable thing was that they actually used love to trick Xia Chen. The pain from such a betrayal was unbearable.

“Let’s go. We’re almost out of time and we need to switch locations. I don’t know what that wily old fox did to me, but he keeps being able to find my general location,” said Xia Chen.

All these days of running had made Xia Chen realize that the other side was able to slowly determine his location. He didn’t know if it was due to him cultivating the Spirit Rune Pavilion’s secret arts or something else.

“We’re not leaving! We’ll kill anyone who comes!” said Guo Ran hatefully.

“Killing them is meaningless. They’re just cannon fodder that the Spirit Rune Pavilion is using to disturb me. There’s no need to waste time on them,” said Xia Chen.

Long Chen nodded. “Xia Chen is correct. There is no need to waste time on them. Ji Wuying ended up running. But next time, he will definitely strike like lightning. I’m not afraid of him, but I am worried about you two. He possesses a Supreme Bone and is a natural controller of spatial energy. Adding on his status as an assassin, we cannot be careless. Xia Chen has yet to recover, while Guo Ran, don’t you also have something important you need to study with Xia Chen?”

“That’s right!” Guo Ran slapped his leg and jumped up excitedly.

The three of them went through several more transportations. In a new location, Guo Ran proudly took out a black arm bone and showed it to Xia Chen.

When Xia Chen saw the runes on the black bone, he almost jumped. “These are… runes born of heaven and earth! How can they appear on a person’s body?!”

“Hehe, this is a Supreme Bone! Supreme heavenly geniuses are all bestowed with gifts from heaven and earth. They naturally aren’t ordinary. However, this gift was taken by me. Xia Chen, you’re skilled with runes. Can you see how to link this thing with my body? I’ve already nourished it for a while, and my mental mark has appeared on it. You have a way, right?” Guo Ran looked at Xia Chen excitedly.

The current Guo Ran was like a child who couldn’t wait any longer. It was like he was afraid of Xia Chen saying that he didn’t have a solution. Moreover, his tense expression looked like he was waiting for a sentencing. Whether he would be executed or live was up to Xia Chen’s next words.

Xia Chen lightly touched the black bone. He still had a shocked expression, which gradually grew grave. Never had he ever come into contact with this kind of rune. He then spent an hour just examining it, with sweat dripping down his forehead.

Guo Ran was also sweating. Xia Chen stared at the black bone, while Guo Ran stared at him. Neither of them blinked.

“Beautiful. A masterpiece of the Heavenly Daos. It is truly amazing.” Xia Chen finally sighed in amazement.

“What?! Don’t get so shocked! Can I use the bone or not?” asked Guo Ran urgently.

“Yes, you can. But you will probably have to pay quite the price. The first thing to do is to cut off your own arm and then plant the runes of the black bone on your skeleton. That way, the bone will form an attachment to you. However, this attachment can’t be completed in just one step. There are many processes that you must go through, and every process will be very painful. The pain will definitely not be inferior to when boss trained us in the Dragon Blood Body Tempering Art. You have to be mentally prepared. Furthermore, the source of this black bone’s power lies in the bloodline. You have boss’s dragon blood energy, so you can use it. But due to its own original source being different, it will need to gradually get accustomed to the dragon blood energy. The start of that process will also be painful, and that pain will only stop when both powers fully merge. You have to think this through. Once you start, you can’t go back,” warned Xia Chen gravely.

“What are you talking about? When have I, Guo Ran, ever been afraid of pain? If you want to show off, you have to pay a price. Even boss said that if you want to stand above others, you have to sacrifice more than them. However much I pay now is how much higher I’ll stand above others. Haha, when I wear my battle armor in the future, I’ll have the Supreme Bone inside, and I’ll be able to look down on everyone. Come, brother! Go ahead and start! Don’t talk about those meaningless things. If you say too much, I’ll lose my confidence.” Guo Ran clenched his teeth and stuck out his right arm.

“It’s not time yet. I’ll need to replicate the bone’s runes and plant them in your body first. That will increase the familiarity between you two. Otherwise, this bone will simply destroy your skeleton,” said Xia Chen.

After saying that, Xia Chen got to work. Taking out a refined desk, an inscribing brush, as well as hundreds of different powders of different colors, he got to work. The first thing he did was mix the powders into liquid.Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

The curious thing was that when these different-colored powders were mixed, they turned black. Moreover, the liquid came to possess the same aura as the bone. Seeing this, Long Chen was amazed. This was also a Grand Dao, just like the Pill Dao. When raised to the pinnacle, there was no differentiating which was greater.

Xia Chen first copied the runes on the bone, and his copies were perfect duplicates. Only then did he start drawing on talisman paper.

A single talisman had to go through hundreds of copies and then hundreds of tests. Also, repeatedly detonating them to test their power was the only way to confirm if they could be used or not.

When Xia Chen detonated a talisman the size of a fingernail, it left a giant ripple in the air. That power was equivalent to a full-power attack from a late stage World King. Seeing this scene, Guo Ran jumped in terror.

Just this single rune was already so terrifying. If it was stuck onto his bones, would he still have his life? But having said some big words, he couldn’t take them back. Guo Ran directly stopped watching and ran off, saying that he was going to guard them, when in reality he was afraid that if he kept watching, he wouldn’t have the courage to take in the black bone.

Time passed bit by bit. The three of them constantly moved around, and three days quickly passed. During these three days, Xia Chen had drawn over three thousand and six hundred talismans before he finally finished.

“Guo Ran, come over!” called Xia Chen.

Guo Ran was pale. But after taking a deep breath, he stuck out his right arm.

Without a word, Xia Chen cut off his arm, and Guo Ran clenched his teeth in pain.

Xia Chen then waved his other hand. Three thousand and six hundred fingernail-sized talismans spread out to cover Guo Ran’s body.

“AHH!”

Guo Ran let out a scream. Those talismans were like worms burrowing into his flesh and attaching to his bones.

“Boss, start!” said Xia Chen, holding the bone.

Long Chen nodded and pressed a hand on Guo Ran’s back. At that time, Xia Chen placed the bone on Guo Ran’s shoulder.

BOOM!

When the arm bone met Guo Ran’s bone, a powerful explosion rang out along with the sound of bones shattering. Guo Ran instantly fainted.
