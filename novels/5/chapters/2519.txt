Chapter 2509 Barbarian Blood Giant vs. Golden Giant

Long Chen was preparing to fight Zhao Ritian to the death when he heard Yun Tian’s voice. His heart shook.

The tear in the Brahma Divine Diagram quickly sealed itself. Yun Tian was cut off once more.

It appeared that after exhausting himself fighting for so long, it was very difficult for him to break free from the Brahma Divine Diagram’s world.

Even a Sovereign’s son had no immediate solution against the Pill Fairy and her two divine items. Long Chen could only stop himself from panicking.

“Keep dreaming if you think you can get past! Once Ye Ming unseals the fiend corpse, all of you will die here.” Zhao Ritian smiled sinisterly, wiping off the blood on his mouth.

Just at this moment, the ground began to explode. One figure after another came crawling out.

Those were six-meter figures that were similar to the rest of the Heaven Swallowing Black Armor Corps. However, their bodies were larger, and their auras were more frightening.

“Hahaha, even the dead generals of the Black Armor Corps have begun reviving! Long Chen, even if you turn around now, you won’t be able to get away!” Zhao Ritian laughed wildly.

Those strange lifeforms pounced on Long Chen once they crawled out of the ground. Long Chen slashed Evilmoon, shattering the bone blade in one of their hands and striking its head.

Half of its head was cut off and black liquid sprayed, filling the air with a disgusting scent.

Long Chen’s heart shook. These so-called generals were truly powerful. Even in this state, his attack wasn’t able to blast one to pieces.

Despite having half its head cut off, this general didn’t die. It continued pouncing toward Long Chen.

Long Chen kicked it in the chest, and it exploded, transforming into black mist.

“How is it? These general-level dead spirits are definitely powerful. I can tell you this. They’ve been absorbing the energy of this tree for tens of thousands of years, and they have no sense of pain or fear. They only have one goal, which is to kill the enemies in front of them. You have no idea how many dead spirits are buried beneath this tree. You’ve fallen for our trap. We drew you here to kill you all in one blow! Those Corpse Devouring Armored Spiders were just a stall tactic to keep you separated from Yun Tian. You didn’t notice any of the clues. If you had fled, you would have been smart. Instead, you came jumping in yourself while bringing your Dragonblood Legion. You really were cooperating with us, hahaha-!” Zhao Ritian’s laughter was cut off by a slash from Long Chen, and he coughed up another mouthful of golden blood.

“In front of absolute power, all schemes are useless. You think an idiot like you can block me?”

After blasting through Zhao Ritian, Long Chen rushed toward the tree.

“You think you can pass? Are you dreaming? Golden Mountain God Trap!”

Zhao Ritian sneered and suddenly stabbed the Heaven Suppressing Dragon Coiling Rod into the ground. The earth shuddered, and the land instantly turned golden.

One golden mountain after another pierced out of the ground like sharp swords piercing the heavens, blocking Long Chen’s path.

Long Chen shattered the first one with a slash of his sword. Huge explosions followed as he blasted his way through. However, even as he destroyed them, they quickly grew back and formed more mountains in his way.

Just at that moment, he felt a breeze behind him. Without looking back, he swung Evilmoon behind him, sending Zhao Ritian flying.

Long Chen continued to charge through the mountains. His speed was severely impacted. At the same time, countless generals of the Black Armor Corps popped out of the ground, attacking him.

Long Chen was infuriated. These general-level spirits seemed to be targeting him. They didn’t attack Zhao Ritian even if they were affected by his attacks.

“Whirlwind Slash!” Long Chen swung Evilmoon in a circle of death. Anything in his way, whether it was the general spirits or the golden mountains were blasted to bits.

Long Chen continued forward, attacking hundreds of times. Zhao Ritian came charging back once more, and this time it seemed that Long Chen had been attacking for too long, and his attack had gotten old. He was the one knocked out of his rhythm by Zhao Ritian.

As a result, more golden mountains sprouted. All his previous efforts were essentially wasted.

“You must be dreaming if you think you can get past me. The only thing left for you is to die here. Not only will you die, but your Dragonblood Legion will also perish with you. But don’t worry, I’ll take care of those beauties of yours, hahaha!” Zhao Ritian laughed in satisfaction at seeing Long Chen’s rage.

“Fine, I’ll just kill you first.” Killing intent exploded out of Long Chen. Meng Qi and the others were his reverse scale. Zhao Ritian was truly courting death.

“Brother Long, I’ll help you! Big sister Meng Qi said that you should stop Ye Ming!” A coarse voice rang out, and Wilde’s figure came charging in.

Wilde’s speed wasn’t particularly fast, so Long Chen guessed that he had been sent in ahead by one of Xia Chen’s formations. As soon as he appeared, Long Chen took out the door bolt for him.

“Wilde, I’ll leave this fellow to you. Kill him!” shouted Long Chen. Ignoring Zhao Ritian, he rushed away, adding on, “He’s just a wild beast.”

“You’re the beast!” Zhao Ritian cursed Long Chen, completely disregarding Wilde.

“Get over here! I’m your opponent!” Wilde smashed the door bolt at Zhao Ritian as Zhao Ritian attempted to prevent Long Chen from getting away.

At first, Zhao Ritian had been completely ignoring him, thinking he was just sacrificing his life to give Long Chen a chance to escape.

However, when Wilde grabbed the door bolt, a terrifying Nether Qi filled the air. Zhao Ritian was horrified to realize how powerful Wilde was.

BOOM!

The door bolt smashed into the Heaven Suppressing Dragon Coiling Rod. Both sides retreated, with Wilde knocked back twelve steps. Every step back caused the earth to collapse. He landed on his butt, with the door bolt escaping his hand and creating a bottomless hole in the ground where it landed.

As for Zhao Ritian, he had been smashed into the earth with his rod. He was nowhere to be found.

Wilde hastily ran over to the hole and dug out the door bolt. When he came back out, Zhao Ritian had just managed to come out of the hole he was in.

“I’ll kill you!” Without hesitation, Wilde smashed the door bolt at Zhao Ritian again.

BOOM!

Wilde had summoned his golden giant form. His door bolt was like a heavenly pillar, giving Zhao Ritian nowhere to run.

With a furious roar, Zhao Ritian blocked with his full power, only to once more be smashed into the ground.

His fight with Wilde was completely different from his fight with Long Chen. Long Chen’s fighting style contained the power of certain laws. Due to his Five Star Battle Armor, the space around him had been solidified by the power of their domains, becoming much more stable.

However, when it came to Wilde, it was just the pure power of his physical body. There was no so-called law to it. Zhao Ritian was unable to effectively use his power like this.

Golden mountains burst out of the ground, condensing into a golden giant. Zhao Ritian had also chosen to manifest a giant form. He attacked with a giant Heaven Suppressing Dragon Coiling Rod. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

The two weapons repeatedly clashed, creating giant explosions. The shockwaves blasted apart the generals of the Black Armor Corps.

Wilde’s entire body was covered in golden spots, while Zhao Ritian had transformed into a giant that looked to be made of gold through and through. From a distance, it looked like two golden giants were fighting.

Zhao Ritian was shocked that the Dragonblood Legion actually possessed another expert on this level. Furthermore, Wilde’s techniques were extremely strange. There were several times that he misjudged his movements and ended up being beaten to the ground.

In his eyes, Wilde’s techniques were strange. What he didn’t know was that Wilde didn’t have techniques. He was just randomly swinging his weapon one swing at a time.

“Fun! This is really fun!” Wilde roared. He had never had a fight like this. He could truly fight to his heart's content against another giant wielding a similar weapon to his own.

Ignoring his bleeding hands, he began to fight even more valiantly. The two horns on his head were starting to grow brighter as he fought, and divine light began to fill his body without him being aware of it.

The spots of gold gradually became connected. A thread of gold weaved through them. Wilde’s body was silently transforming as something within him slowly awakened.

With Wilde blocking Zhao Ritian, Long Chen managed to reach the tree. When he finally reached the roots of the tree, he saw countless corpses.

“Dragon corpses!”
