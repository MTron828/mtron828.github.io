Chapter 2427 The Senior Generation’s Commitment

Translator: BornToBe

Watching as the disciples entered the transportation formation one group after another, the various sect leaders nodded and waved toward their disciples.

Perhaps it was because of the impending dark era, but they had temporarily set aside all their personal grievances. At this point in time, the Martial Heaven Alliance had reached an unprecedented level of unity.

Both the senior generation and the junior generation were profoundly aware that if they still didn’t unite at this time, the dark era would be the end of the entire Martial Heaven Continent.

The Martial Heaven Alliance was founded due to the Righteous path being scattered grains of sand. They united in order to protect themselves.

Now, the Martial Heaven Alliance had returned to that state. Back in the time of the senior generation, Qu Jianying had led the Martial Heaven Alliance in a successful campaign against the Corrupt path, fighting battle after battle. But not everyone was won over by her.

Qu Jianying was willing to spill blood for the alliance, and it was true that she was powerful. But in the cultivation world where power was respected, an overwhelming power that could suppress others was the only way to get people to worship you. Moral character was not enough. So while the senior generation’s people all acknowledged her, only a few actually worshipped her.

Due to this, some people’s morality had grown lacking, but she still had a group of loyal followers. As cultivators, the strong were worshipped. As long as you were strong enough, everything that you said was right.

Qu Jianying had not reached that level of power in her era. But now, the Martial Heaven Alliance had such a figure.

That figure was Long Chen. Although he was not the future alliance head, everyone knew it was because he disdained that position and would rather have his freedom.

Long Chen had previously said that he would have to obediently listen to Ye Lingshan’s orders. Although it had contained a slight joking tone, everyone knew that he was expressing that as long as he was present, Ye Lingshan’s position could not be shaken by anyone.

In title, Ye Lingshan was the future leader of the Martial Heaven Alliance. But in reality, Long Chen was the true mental pillar of the disciples.

They felt even greater admiration for Long Chen due to this decision to purely focus on the Martial Dao and not abandon it for some status or position. They understood that true experts disdained such a thing.

That was why they all listened to Ye Lingshan’s orders without hesitation. They knew that Ye Lingshan’s orders represented Long Chen’s.

A total of eight hundred thousand disciples were moving out at the same time. It was a grand sight. The Martial Heaven Alliance’s transportation formation was constantly flashing as disciples entered one group after another. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

Seeing those disciples’ fearless gazes, quite a few of the elders felt sour inside. The Star Field Divine World was considered a remnant from ancient times. Hence, there were people from the Corrupt path, the ancient family alliance, and other powers entering as well. Even the sea demon race was entering.

Ignoring the dangers of the actual Star Field Divine World, with so many enemy experts inside, it was unknown how many people would be returning alive.

They were extremely unwilling to let their disciples go, but this era was not theirs. They could only smile and wave in encouragement.

In the end, the last batch of people left were the Dragonblood Legion as well as the various lead disciples such as Ye Lingshan, Chang Hao, Bao Buping, and the others.

“Let’s go.” Long Chen cupped his fists toward the old man and led that group into the transportation formation.

Seeing them about to leave, Qu Jianying was about to speak when she was stopped by the old man. “Don’t. Telling them to be cautious is unnecessary. The children have grown, and they know what to do. We have to trust them.”

Qu Jianying had no children, but she viewed her disciples as her children. With those children leaving, she felt hollow inside.

Li Tianxuan added, “Don’t worry, with Long Chen present, they definitely won’t be on the losing end.”

Qu Jianying nodded. “Yes, I trust them. If the children are working so hard, the adults can’t slack off. Long Chen left some Barrier Breaking Pills for me. Anyone who has reached the third step of Netherpassage and wishes to attempt reaching the fourth step can take one.”

“Barrier Breaking Pills?”

“Yes, twelfth tier top grade Barrier Breaking Pills. As long as your death energy has not proliferated, you can consume one,” said Qu Jianying.

Yan Nantian and the other Grand Elders of the Martial Heaven Alliance couldn’t help shaking their heads and sighing. They hadn’t been born in the right era. These Barrier Breaking Pills would not help them.

Yan Nantian added, “You should think about this. These Barrier Breaking Pills will instantly stimulate your death energy. Since each person has different aptitudes and some people have been stuck at the third step for too long, this stimulation may be too much for your life and death energy to ever balance again. You would be unable to reach the Samsara realm, and your life and death energy might solidify. You would never be able to use your life and death energy again.”

Yan Nantian was warning them that these Barrier Breaking Pills were not risk-free. They had to think about it before using them.

One of the elders suddenly said, “Alliance head, please give me one. If I still don’t take this chance, I’m going to be buried in the ground before long. So what if I’m crippled? This era isn’t ours. If I don’t break through, I won’t be able to do anything. But if I succeed, perhaps I can do something on the battlefield. Even if I can’t do anything big, perhaps I can save at least one child.”

The other experts couldn’t help being moved. This person was a sect leader. He was willing to take this risk.

These elders who had missed this era had managed to advance to the third step due to the change in heaven and earth. However, the third step was the limit. The Heavenly Daos did not assist them in advancing any further.

A top grade Barrier Breaking Pill gave them a slight chance of reaching the fourth step. But even then, their combat power would not compare to a true fourth step Netherpassage expert.

The lack of talent and aptitude could not be made up for with this pill. Normally, such a risk would not be worth it.

However, this sect leader was clear. At the very least, if it succeeded, he might be able to become a sacrificial meat shield on the battlefield at a critical time.

If he didn’t make this breakthrough, then he wouldn’t even be qualified to do that. This heroism affected all of them.

“Alliance head, are there enough Barrier Breaking Pills? Can I have one?”

“I want one as well.”

All those who had reached the third step began to step forward, a determined light in their eyes. Qu Jianying was moved. Who said that the Righteous path’s experts were all selfish? When a great calamity descended, their light shone just as bright.

“There are plenty of pills, so don’t rush. Think it over before coming to take one.” Qu Jianying began to distribute the pills. She felt a trace of warmth inside.

This era was not theirs, but they could use their actions to show that the senior generation had their own courage and determination. They were willing to sacrifice everything for the Martial Heaven Continent. This was a kind of pride.

“Old man, do you want one?” asked Qu Jianying.

“No. Leave it to someone else. I believe that I can break through with my own power,” the old man spoke confidently. The years that his cultivation base had been stuck at the Life Star realm benefited him now. As the world changed, he ended up being more blessed by the Heavenly Daos than the others of the senior generation. He wanted to use his own power to reach the fourth step.

That determined light moved Qu Jianying. This old man with a temper that irritated her so badly had perhaps attracted her precisely due to this aspect of him.

“Let’s go into seclusion for our breakthroughs.”

The old man waved his hand, and everyone slowly scattered.

…

Hundreds of flying boats shook the sky as they whistled through the air. They were packed with the disciples of the Martial Heaven Alliance.

The lead boat belonged to the Dragonblood Legion. All the Dragonblood warriors were high-spirited and filled with excitement.

“What are you so excited about? You look like you’re going to a fight.” Long Chen looked at them curiously. They were rubbing their fists in anticipation.

One of the squad leaders said, “Boss, Guo Ran told us that we have to work hard to capture Feng Fei for you. Boss Guo Ran, what are you pinching me for?”

“Guo Ran, if I don’t give you a proper massage this time, it seems that you won’t learn just who your boss is.” Long Chen clenched his teeth furiously. This fellow’s head had definitely been damaged. Even if you had to con someone, who would con them like this? Meng Qi and the others were all on the boat, looking oddly at him.

“Boss, this is just to boost morale… I was wrong, I wouldn’t dare… Ah, save me!!!”

The sound of a pig being slaughtered began to come from the Dragonblood Legion’s flying boat, causing the disciples on the other flying boats to stare at each other oddly. Gu Yang and the others’ laughter followed.

“You deserve it. You start misbehaving as soon as you forget your last beating,” laughed Tang Wan-er, turning a blind eye to Guo Ran’s plight.

“Long Chen, we’ve arrived,” said Meng Qi suddenly.
