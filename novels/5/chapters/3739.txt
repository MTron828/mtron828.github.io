Chapter 3728 Desolate World

Suddenly, the Grand Dao Flower buzzed, and everyone present was startled to find all the names on it vanish.

“What’s going on?”

Everyone grew uneasy. What did it mean for their names to vanish? Could they still go in?

The Grand Dao Flower had originally shone with all the colors of the rainbow, but now it suddenly turned pure white. After that, the white petals slowly began to turn black. They wilted and rotted. It was as if the Grand Dao Flower was cursed.

“What is going on?!” Startled cries rang out.

As the Grand Dao Flower withered, black qi swirled out. The rainbow lotus was now a black lotus.

Following the appearance of the black lotus, a terrifying divine might suddenly erupted from it, shattering the world before them. People then saw an endless battlefield.

The earth was already covered in corpses, and countless lifeforms were slaughtering each other. When the line of sight was pulled back, everyone was shocked to see countless lifeforms slaughtering the human race.

The human race was still fighting back, but there were just too many enemies. The most terrifying thing was that even the weakest person here was an Immortal King.

World Kings were everywhere, and the Divine Venerates were the main force. They then saw experts from the Netherworld, the demon world, the devil world, and various beast races, along with some lifeforms that they had never seen before. They all joined forces to slaughter the human race.

However, following that, they saw a surprising group of experts amongst the human race. One punch from them shattered the void, and one slash of their sword cut apart the starry river. These experts were actually capable of easily fighting back against the odds. No one in the same realm was able to match them.

“Are those… nine star heirs?”

Startled cries rang out. People saw six stars behind one of their backs, and a single punch from him destroyed a mass of World King lifeforms. Furthermore, that person’s cultivation base was only in the Immortal King realm.

An Immortal King challenging a World King across realms was nothing to these geniuses. But for one punch to blast hundreds of World Kings apart was absolutely terrifying.

“These are the nine star heirs said to be the strongest warriors within the nine heavens and ten lands? Aren’t they hunted down by the Nine Underworld Hall?” Countless people glanced at the Nine Underworld Hall’s experts.

“There are so many of them!”

As their viewpoint shifted back, they saw countless nine star heirs fighting a bloody battle, slaughtering these lifeforms.

However, the scenes moved too quickly. The battlefield got smaller, and even giant devil beasts appeared as small as ants. Now, all they saw was a sea of blood.

As their vision widened, they saw an endless sea of blood with a single little island on it.

Their vision then continued to rise higher and higher, and they saw more and more islands within the endless bloody sea. People felt a chill. They could tell that they were seeing something that they shouldn’t.

“Is this the scene from that legendary immemorial battle?” asked one expert with a quivering voice.

“Probably. Otherwise, the human race wouldn’t be so strong.”

Other than the nine star heirs, even the other humans and other lifeforms were incredibly powerful. Even within the same realm, their power far exceeded expectations. It was said that human experts were in their strongest state in the immemorial era. Now that they were seeing this, they believed it.

Although these were just images, when they fought, space twisted and the Heavenly Daos were torn apart. That was enough to show that those experts had unimaginable destructive power.

Suddenly, ten rays of divine light lit up the world, shattering the sea of blood. With a blinding flash, it felt like they were seeing a giant world through the ten rays of divine light.

However, that giant world only appeared for a moment before vanishing. Then the ten rays of divine light also faded. Everything turned black.

Within the endless darkness, a giant black lotus slowly closed as if devouring this world.

Now, the inside of the gate was pitch-black, and strange sounds came from within the darkness. All of a sudden, people heard violent roars, and then space tore apart. Assaulted by the roars, countless experts screamed, blood pouring out of their ears.

Everyone was horrified. More and more cracks were appearing in the sky of the Violet Flame Heaven Capital, as if heaven and earth were about to explode.

“It was nothing more than an image from the immemorial era. It is a completely different spacetime than ours, so how is its power still reaching us?!” exclaimed a Divine Venerate.

Just the sound of the roars was enough to tear apart the world. Even Divine Venerates felt as tiny as ants in front of that power. They could only submit.

Looking at the cracks in the air that didn’t heal for a long time and hearing the ear-splitting roars that came from time immemorial, every expert was completely stunned. Just what kind of existence’s voice could pass through the river of time and still shake the void?

However, everything inside the gate was now pitch-black, so they could no longer see anything. They had no idea what had happened. 

Long Chen’s heart was pounding loudly in his chest. That voice made all the blood in his body boil, and his Dragon Blood Battle Armor automatically activated. After that, he clenched his teeth and suddenly shut one eye.

“Think this through. This kind of karma is absolutely terrifying,” warned Xia Guhong gravely.

“I don’t care. Karma can be good or bad. Since no one knows the future, I can just close my eyes and do whatever!” Long Chen understood Xia Guhong’s good intentions, but he was unwilling to not take a look.

Long Chen’s left eye instantly turned black and merged with the black world within the gate. He activated the Purgatory Eyes.

When the darkness in the gate vanished, he saw a dusty world. He also saw countless chains that formed a net, sealing this entire world.

Long Chen looked at this desolate world, one that was practically ruins, riddled with holes. But this world was also covered in a sacred white light.

Countless lifeforms were kneeling on the ground, praying and chanting. When Long Chen heard what they were chanting, his entire body shook.

“The Nirvana Scripture!”

Long Chen had not expected this scripture to be the Nirvana Scripture. Although it was a part of the scripture that he hadn’t heard before, he was sure that it was the Nirvana Scripture.

This ruined world had countless lifeforms covered in blood. Some of them were on their last breaths, barely hanging on.

As they chanted the Nirvana Scripture, the sacred light of this ruined world quivered. The giant net was covering this ruined world as if it was the main target.

The net grew and spread even further as if some power was pulling it. Long Chen hastily looked over.

Within the darkness, Long Chen saw giant figures pulling on the net, covering up endless starry seas.

“Stop!”

Suddenly, Xia Guhong’s voice erupted in Long Chen’s ear.𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Sharp pain then struck Long Chen’s body, and the scene before him instantly vanished. At this moment, his left eye was already bleeding heavily.
