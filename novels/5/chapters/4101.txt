Chapter 4090 Unparalleled Dragon Might

In front of everyone’s shocked gazes, those Shadow race lifeforms simply exploded. Their blood mist filled the air before suddenly vanishing.

The Soaring Dragon Company’s Heaven Venerate was greatly shocked by this. The Shadow race’s assassins were terrifying existences. How could they have been annihilated?

There were thirty-six Immortal King assassins, all of them at the peak of the Immortal King realm. However, even elite assassins that had been specially picked out were unable to endure a single attack from Long Chen.

It had to be known that any one of those thirty-six assassins was comparable to an Earth Venerate. Adding on the natural talent of the Shadow race, they even had the capability to assassinate a Heaven Venerate, so mobilizing thirty-six of them could already be considered giving Long Chen a high estimation. But unexpectedly, they were instantly annihilated.

“What idiots. As expected, you die as soon as the light of day touches you. Once you’re exposed, you immediately think of hiding again. Assassins always run if they fail their attack, but by concealing yourself, you lose your defense. When that happens, a random attack with no gaps will instantly take your lives,” sneered Long Chen.

Although he was not familiar with the Shadow race, he was very used to dealing with the Bloodkill Hall and the Nine Underworld Hall. Thus, he could predict their movements.

The reason assassins had such terrifying killing power was because they could instantly concentrate all their power during their assassination attack.

Assassins also had great fleeing capabilities because they had abandoned all thoughts of defense and offense in pursuit of greater evasion and concealment abilities.

Thus, an assassin would instantly flee after failing. But if they were caught, they couldn’t do anything but be slain as easily as crushing a bug.

This Heaven Venerate only understood why the Shadow experts were slain so easily when he heard Long Chen say this. Although he had business arrangements with the Shadow race, he hadn’t known about their fatal weakness.

“Hmph, so you have some skill, but it still won’t change the fact that you’re all dead! This old man will do it personally!” The Heaven Venerate sneered and extended a hand, materializing a spear in his grasp.

For him to use his personal weapon against a group of Immortal Kings, it could be seen that he wasn’t looking down on Long Chen.

Long Chen told Guo Ran and Xia Chen, “Follow the plan. You’ll be fine, right?”

“Of course. It’ll be easy.” Guo Ran gestured for Long Chen to relax. Summoning his battle armor, he led everyone straight to the rear of the Soaring Dragon Company.

“Fools! Die!” Seeing this scene, the Heaven Venerate was enraged. The direction that they were going was their treasury. Even at this time, the Dragonblood warriors were still thinking of plundering their treasury, treating him as nothing but empty air. Thus, he furiously stabbed his spear at them.

However, the moment he moved, a chilling killing intent locked onto him, causing his hair to stand on end.

With his divine ring lit up behind him and golden scales covering his body, Long Chen launched his saber, slashing down on the Heaven Venerate.

Long Chen had actually unleashed his full power in the blink of an eye. It was like a sheep had instantly become a dragon.

Before this, Long Chen wouldn’t dare to unleash all his power like that because his body wouldn’t be able to endure it. Yet, with his strengthened physique and the dragon spirit's blessing, his energy was now more elastic and flexible; it wouldn’t harm him.

“What?!”

The Heaven Venerate's reaction was one of astonishment as he swiftly retracted his spear in a defensive maneuver. However, his manifestation barely materialized before Long Chen's saber struck him.

As a result, he was sent flying like a shooting star, smashing through countless buildings which directly exploded on contact.

BOOM!

In the end, the Heaven Venerate smashed into the barrier. He had flown from the front gate to the rear gate before bouncing back upon contact with the barrier.

Due to the impact, he coughed up blood. To his surprise, Long Chen’s first blow had instantly injured him. Shock, anger, and a sense of encroaching fear then surged within him. After all, he had only evaded death by summoning his manifestation at the last possible moment.

He had thought that his power alone would be able to crush Long Chen and the others. Due to his carelessness, he hadn’t even thought of summoning his manifestation.

At the same time, he had been worried about damaging this area. After all, this was their territory, and everything damaged would cost money to repair.

This misgiving almost cost him his life.

“Cloud Dragon Immolation Claw!”

Just then, Long Chen’s roar resonated like the bellow of a celestial god, its intensity shaking the heavens. A resounding dragon cry followed suit. After that, from within his divine ring, a golden dragon claw emerged out of his divine ring.

Before this claw even landed, the earth had been torn asunder along with countless buildings. As for the Heaven Venerate, his clothes began to fly off of him in tattered pieces.

At that moment, he was completely horrified, unable to comprehend how an Immortal King could possess such terrifying power.

“Three flowers ignite the world, Venerate of the heavens!”

The three-colored world behind the Heaven Venerate instantly split into three flowers. As they ignited, all the power of heaven and earth seemed to ignite as well. At this moment, the Heaven Venerate was using a self-damaging technique just to fight Long Chen.Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

For him, maintaining the Heaven Venerate realm cost him a large amount of longevity. Thus, now that he had ignited his three flowers, his longevity was rapidly withering away.

If he ignited his three flowers with his manifestation, then it would give him ten times the power for an instant. But after one attack, all his longevity would be exhausted, and even if he won, he would die.

So, by splitting his three-color manifestation back into the three flowers and then igniting them, he could unleash double his power. Although it was less effective, the price was within the realm that he could endure.

The Heaven Venerate’s spear lit up, its runes shining brightly as he poured all his power into it. When he was done, he stabbed it at Long Chen’s dragon claw.

BOOM!

After the dragon claw smashed into the ground, a wave of destruction spread, destroying all the buildings within the barrier. As for the countless experts inside, they were obliterated.

When the dragon claw exploded, it revealed the Heaven Venerate lying at the bottom of the giant hole. His eyes were lifeless.

He had ignited his three flowers, but even then, his attack was unable to suppress Long Chen’s dragon claw. When the barrier covering the Soaring Dragon Company shattered, countless experts inside the city stared in shock and horror. The entire city was stunned.
