Chapter 3960 Evolving the Seven Star Battle Armor

Those people didn‚Äôt have high cultivation bases and their auras were weak. In fact, they looked just like ordinary commoners. However, no matter how they concealed themselves, they were unable to conceal their faith energy from Long Chen.

After all, Long Chen had spent years fighting the Bloodkill Hall. Even with his eyes closed, he would be able to smell them as soon as they got close.

Ever since Ji Wuming‚Äôs death, Long Chen seemed to become the primary target of Enpuda‚Äôs wrath. It was because despite Long Chen‚Äôs discreet arrival in the Vermilion Bird Empire, he was still found, which indicated that Enpuda had mobilized all his resources to track him down. From this, it seemed highly probable that Enpuda intended to personally confront Long Chen.

However, Long Chen wasn‚Äôt afraid of him since the Vermilion Bird Empire was filled with experts. For example, Long Chen knew that Yu Xiaoyun and the two empresses were three-flower Divine Venerates.

As for that ancient elder within the palace, there was no way to estimate his age, and Long Chen couldn‚Äôt see through his cultivation base. He was unfathomable, so he was probably another terrifying expert.

Furthermore, the grand formation in the capital was the most powerful formation Long Chen had ever encountered. If Enpuda dared to manifest himself in the capital, it would be no different than sending himself to his death.

Long Chen didn‚Äôt mind if Enpuda was just going to scout where he was. As long as Enpuda didn‚Äôt personally come, Long Chen wasn‚Äôt afraid of anyone else.

Inside the Huayun Trading Company, Long Chen directly exchanged thirty million silver. But these silver coins were no ordinary silver. They were Vermilion Bird Starry Fine Silver, a kind of mithril that was only produced within the Vermilion Bird Empire.

This was an incredibly rare metal, but it was not actually valuable and only suitable to be a currency. If it was too precious, then the silver would leave the empire. After all, there was a limited quantity of this rare metal.

Beneath the silver coins were copper coins that were also made with the Vermilion Bird Empire‚Äôs special copper ores. They both had the totemic mark of the Vermilion Bird on them. Within the Vermilion Bird Empire, they would give off special fluctuations, so it was easy to tell the real ones from the fakes.

There were also gold coins, but this gold currency couldn‚Äôt be used by the commoners. Only members of the royal family, Hanlin scholars and above, or perhaps some high level officials would be qualified to use them.

Thus, commoners that somehow received gold coins would go to places set up to exchange them for silver and copper because they were not qualified to directly use the coins.

At this moment, Long Chen‚Äôs status was nothing more than the lowest commoner within the Vermilion Bird Empire. The majority of people in this category typically relied on copper currency and rarely possessed silver. However, Long Chen was extremely wealthy. By giving a single devil crystal from an immemorial devil corpse to the Huayun Trading Company, he obtained a full thirty million silver.

According to the Vermilion Bird Empire's pricing system, the value of a single silver coin was roughly equivalent to a hundred immortal king crystals. Therefore, thirty million silver coins would be valued at around three billion immortal king crystals. It is worth noting that even the princes and princesses of the empire received only thirty thousand silver coins per month. As a result, Long Chen could be considered a moneybag.

With the help of the Huayun Trading Company, Long Chen directly registered as a martial artist for the Vermilion Bird Empire without even having to leave their gate. However, he would have to participate in a martial stage competition once every seven days to display his power and raise his rank.

The martial artists were just like the scholars and were split into many ranks. But Long Chen couldn‚Äôt be bothered to ask about those ranks. After registering for the martial art competition, he also registered for the scholar exams.

In any case, he just needed to register. If he felt like it, he could go. But if he didn‚Äôt feel like it, there was no one forcing him to participate. Long Chen was purely playing around.

The next afternoon, there was a martial art competition, and thanks to the connections of the Huayun Trading Company, Long Chen had an early match arranged for him.

When Long Chen stepped onto the martial stage, he saw that his opponent was in the Divine Flame realm, dumbfounding him. His opponent was also stunned when he saw him.n√äw stùíêries at nùíê/vel/b/i/n(.)coùíé

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre a fucking Immortal King?! What are you doing registering for this?!‚Äù raged that person sullenly.

‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt have a fucking choice, alright?‚Äù Long Chen was also speechless. How could this be blamed on him?

‚ÄúI look down on you.‚Äù

After saying that, this person directly fled. As the realm difference was too great, what was the point of fighting? They were fundamentally not on the same level.

Most of the spectators were also Divine Flame cultivators. Hence, for an Immortal King to appear here was like an adult entering a competition for children.

This time, Long Chen was required to participate in three battles. Each battle was a week apart, and only upon winning all could he proceed to the next stage. Therefore, after emerging victorious this time, Long Chen had to wait for another seven days before his next challenge.

Long Chen took advantage of this chance to increase his cultivation base. After all, Yu Qingxuan had reached the third Heavenstage after leaving the three thousand worlds. As for himself, he was still in the initial Immortal King realm.

It went without saying that Yu Qingxuan‚Äôs talent was amazing. The speed at which she advanced was incredible, so Long Chen had to put in some effort to keep up.

Long Chen directly rented the most luxurious training room, which came at a price of a thousand silver per day. Despite the high cost, the room provided a wide array of supplementary formations. It was equipped with various facilities for activities such as cultivation, pill refinement, exchanging blows, and testing moves, all designed to assist and enhance the training experience.

In these training rooms, even Divine Venerates had the freedom to unleash their full power. Furthermore, due to the prohibition of fighting anywhere else in the capital, businesses such as training rooms thrived. These establishments offered a safe and controlled environment for individuals to engage in rigorous training and combat, catering to the needs of martial practitioners at all levels.

The price difference between the lowest grade training rooms and the best was massive. As for this training room, it was packed with tools: from pill furnaces, training dummies, to forging tools. If Long Chen wished, he could even pay more money to get an expert to accompany him in training. A Supreme heavenly genius could also be brought to help his training if given enough money.

It was said that the princes and princesses often paid money to have someone accompany them in their training. However, finding training partners who could match their level was a challenge, as only peak experts were capable of meeting their requirements.

Even so, countless experts still wished to become the training partners of the princes and princesses. Successfully obtaining such a position not only provided a chance to soar through the ranks by leveraging connections but also came with additional benefits. Other than status and honor, they would also be granted an imperial salary and access to valuable imperial resources. It was a coveted opportunity that held both prestige and practical advantages.

When Long Chen entered this training room, he decided to activate the pill refining formation. After that, the spiritual qi in the room grew incredibly dense, and even the laws of heaven and earth were drawn in to further aid in refining pills, increasing the chance of success.

Long Chen had the Demon Moon Furnace and the Moon and Star Refining Furnace get to work. Fortunately, the materials for the Immortal King Pills had long since been prepared. They just hadn‚Äôt had the time to refine these pills until now.

All the pills that the two had refined were essentially given to the Luo family‚Äôs disciples. In the three thousand worlds, Long Chen had passed a mountain of pills to Qin Feng to give to the Luo family.

Now, it was time to refine his own pills. Immortal King Pills weren‚Äôt that difficult to make. Long Chen showed them how to do it a few times, and the Demon Moon Furnace and the Moon and Star Refining Furnace directly got to work, working together with Huo Linger to refine the pills themselves.

After leaving the matter of the pill refinement to them, Long Chen‚Äôs mind sank into the primal chaos space, and his spiritual body sat beneath the Seven Treasure Colored Glass Tree. Its divine light then fell, enveloping his soul, making Long Chen‚Äôs mind clearer than ever.

Seven large stars appeared in his empty mind. Behind them were 108,000 smaller stars forming a giant star diagram.

‚ÄúIt should be time to study my future path of the nine stars.‚Äù

Long Chen examined the stars as he had to find his own path. In an instant, the star diagram began to go through constant transformations, manifesting different diagrams. He had to find the most suitable star diagram within the countless possibilities, and that would be the design of his seven stars.

On the third day that he was in seclusion, someone unexpectedly came to call him out of seclusion.
