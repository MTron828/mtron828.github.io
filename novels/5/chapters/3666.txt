Chapter 3655

“Isn’t this what you wanted? Why are you blaming me?”

Xia Chen looked at Gongsun Ziyi coldly. “You really are a scheming woman, frighteningly so. You are so selfish that you are willing to sacrifice everything else. Before this, I thought that you were manipulated by your grandfather. Now, I find that it was all your idea. Just now, you were colluding with Gongsun Xuan to attack me together. Gongsun Xuan would draw my attention while you captured my brother, Guo Ran. You specialize in the World Shifting Soul Lock Talisman. With a sneak attack, you’d have an eighty percent chance of managing to transport Guo Ran to your side and capture him. If you succeeded, even if it wouldn’t count as a victory, you would at least have a way out.

“You both agreed to this plan, but when your grandfather attacked, you didn’t do anything because you were afraid. You weren’t afraid of Guo Ran or me but of boss Long Chen. That’s because I told you that there is no one in the nine heavens and ten lands who is a match for my boss in the same realm. No one can play tricks on him. Thus, although you agreed to the plan, you didn’t act according to it. When your grandfather attacked, you didn’t make your move. Your grandfather thought that you were waiting for a better chance, but when he was defending and you still didn’t do anything, he realized the truth. He’s nothing good either. Despite knowing that he was going to die, he wanted to expose you. But you were quite vicious, directly throwing yourself at him to make sure his last breath ran out as quickly as possible. He will never be able to say the truth now. Then you started crying and putting on a show. You know me. You know that with your grandfather dead, I’ve obtained my revenge. Then once I left, the Spirit Rune Pavilion will be yours. To exchange your grandfather for so many benefits, your scheming really is brilliant.”

When Xia Chen said this, the experts present sucked in a cold gasp of air. This kind of scheming was simply too terrifying, wasn’t it?

Even these old foxes didn’t feel like they were capable of this. Even though they had spent a lifetime scheming, there was no way they would be able to react so quickly and come up with such a scheme on the spot.

They had no doubt about Xia Chen's words. One reason was that Xia Chen didn’t need to lie. The other reason was that they had also sensed the spiritual fluctuations between this granddaughter and grandfather. They knew that these two had been scheming something.

However, the greatest evidence was Gongsun Xuan’s furious expression right before his death. They had felt it to be very odd. Now, they knew that it was because Gongsun Ziyi had used and deceived him.

He had mostly likely realized it before his death and wanted to expose her, only for Gongsun Ziyi to silently put him down. He didn’t manage to say anything before his death.

Now, thinking back to all of Gongsun Ziyi’s methods, everyone couldn’t help feeling a chill down their spines. Her scheming ability was terrifying.

In fact, they hoped for Gongsun Ziyi to quickly die now. If she were to control the Spirit Rune Pavilion, then it seemed that those with bad relationships to the Spirit Rune Pavilion would be schemed to death one by one. She was terrifying.

“Xia Chen, listen to me, it’s not like that!” Gongsun Ziyi pleaded. She still wanted to defend herself.

However, Xia Chen didn’t give her that chance. “I am also someone who likes to use smarts. Although I wouldn’t say that I’ve reached my boss’s level, I wouldn’t lose to others. The reason that I so foolishly let myself be used by you is because I loved you. My boss told me that after loving someone, there’s no need to use your brain. Now that I think back to it, I really am foolish. There were so many obvious questionable areas all this time, but I still chose to trust you. However, I should thank you. You’re the first woman I loved. You taught me the evil in people’s hearts, and you also taught me how to distinguish whether a woman is good or bad.”

“Xia Chen, please, I don’t want to die. Give me a chance…” Gongsun Ziyi wept. This time, it was no act. She really was terrified and did not want to die.

“Like I said, would you have made the same decisions if you had known that this day would come? In truth, this is the path you made yourself walk step by step. Even when I came straight here, you refused to admit to your sins. You resisted with all your power. Otherwise, I would have only crippled your cultivation base. But for you to even scheme against your own grandfather, I don’t even know how many people you would scheme to death in the future. You are the one who sealed your own fate,” said Xia Chen, shaking his head.

“Xia Chen, I’ll change…”

“Mountains and rivers change, but people don’t. I can’t give you that chance. Did you ever give those people you schemed to death a chance? Just go in peace. In your next life, don’t always scheme against others. Maybe you’ll be happier then.”

After that, Xia Chen pulled out his sword. Gongsun Ziyi’s body quivered and then slowly collapsed. The aura of her life slowly dissipated.

Looking at Gongsun Ziyi’s expression in death, people couldn’t help shaking their heads. Just before this, she had such an expression of pitiful pain. But after death, her face was twisted with malevolence. A person’s nature was simply their nature.

Some people had felt pity for her and wanted to say something. Thinking back, those people now felt cold sweat drip down their backs. If Gongsun Ziyi did live, perhaps they would die in the future without even realizing it.

Suddenly, Xia Chen held Gongsun Ziyi’s corpse and wept. Guo Ran and Long Chen sighed. People all said that their first love was the most beautiful. But Xia Chen’s first love was the most cruel. He had personally killed the person that he once loved. That was truly cruel.

The experts present were silent as they watched Xia Chen weep. The people from the Spirit Rune Pavilion in particular had no words.

These two had been the heavenly couple of the Spirit Rune Pavilion, the ones who could have brought them to an unprecedented glory. Now, unforeseen events turned that into nothing more than an illusion. That feeling of having reality change so much was indescribable.

Even then, no one dared to move. The Yin Yang Heaven Sealing Talisman was still trapping them here, and no one could leave. Xia Chen still possessed the power to kill all of them.

After crying, Xia Chen slowly calmed down. Long Chen then patted him on the shoulder, and Xia Chen took a deep breath.

“Boss, I’m fine. Since it’s the past, let it pass. I believe that there’s a kind woman waiting for me.”

Long Chen was relieved to hear that Xia Chen hadn’t given up on himself. Guo Ran joked, “Just one? I have a premonition that I’ll have at least three beauties. Otherwise, I won’t be able to stand by boss’s side.”

After laughing, the depressing air had mostly faded. Having settled his emotions, Xia Chen looked over everyone.

“I have an important matter to announce to everyone today. This matter relates to the future of the entire Heavenly Talisman Star-Field. Starting today, the Spirit Rune Pavilion’s sacred land is open to the entire Heavenly Talisman Star-Field.”

“What?!” Xia Chen’s words completely shocked countless experts.
