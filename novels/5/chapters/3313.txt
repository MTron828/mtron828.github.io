Chapter 3302 Heavenly Rainbow Flame

“They already know that we visited the Vile Dragon Domain. We’ve been exposed. At this time, I feel like we should go back and report things,” said Bai Shishi hesitantly.

Long Chen laughed and looked at her. Being stared at like this, she reddened and angrily said, “What? Did I say something wrong?”

“Do you know why the academy gave this mission to me and not you?” asked Long Chen.

“I suppose because you’re so amazing!” said Bai Shishi frostily.

“Damn, you really turn hostile faster than the pages of a book. You’re getting angry just like that?” asked Long Chen with a laugh.

“How am I angry?” said Bai Shishi, turning away.

Fortunately, Long Chen had many women beside him and had long since gotten used to such a thing. He said, “When the generals are outside, the king’s orders can’t reach them. We are no longer children that need to discuss everything with our father and mother. Every person has their own style of handling things. Since the academy left this problem to me, I don’t need to discuss my plan with them. Furthermore, if the academy really had a method, would they need me, a little Four Peak disciple? So you should just listen to me. From the mortal world to the immortal world, I’ve experienced all kinds of dangers. I’ve seen countless schemes. When you follow me, there’s no need to bring your brain. Just relax. Look at the four of them, they’re not worried at all. Aren’t they very happy? Don’t say that I didn’t warn you, but women who worry about things always age the fastest.”

“Hmph, go lie to some ghosts instead. I’m not going to believe you.” Bai Shishi glared at Long Chen in response to his final sentence.

In her heart, she had no choice but to admit that Long Chen had far more experience than her. He was admonishing her as tactfully as he could, so she was grateful for this.

She also knew that it wasn’t her place to ask certain things. But she liked to know what was happening and have a sense of control. She didn’t like running forward in the dark.Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Long Chen had already turned cold-faced to her because of this matter. Now she made the same mistake again. This level of admonishment was definitely as tactful as he could be.

Hence, Bai Shishi finally accepted this and no longer asked him any questions. Long Chen sighed with relief. This girl was truly stubborn, and it gave him a bit of a headache.

Bai Shishi had always had a halo of light following her. She had always been this stubborn, so changing this part of her character was impossible. Asking her to take a small step back was all he could ask so that they could work together peacefully.

“Long Chen, don’t leave today. Give me a day,” said Bai Shishi suddenly.

“What? Why?” asked Long Chen.

“If I ask you for time, then give me time. If you’re not going to permit me to ask anything, are you also not going to let me be willful at all?” Bai Shishi smiled.

“Fine.”

Long Chen was speechless. This was pure revenge.

Bai Shishi directly went into meditative cultivation, so Long Chen helplessly guarded her. There was nothing for him to do during this time. Later during the day, Xu Zixiong caught some wild game and roasted it for everyone.

Xu Zixiong was a bit foolish but sensible. He knew that he was the weakest of everyone here, so he always took the initiative in dealing with minor affairs, sometimes to the point where Qin Feng and the others felt embarrassed.

Qin Feng told him that they were all brothers and there was no need for him to act like this, but Xu Zixiong still continued.

As Long Chen ate with everyone, he suddenly noticed something. Amongst all of them, he had the lowest cultivation base.

Qi Yu was at the fifth Heavenstage. Qin Feng and Xu Zixiong were at the fourth Heavenstage. As for Bai Xiaole, who knew how, but despite never seeing him cultivate, he was on the same level as Qi Yu.

Amongst all of them, Bai Shishi was the one with the highest cultivation base. She had reached the sixth Heavenstage. Long Chen could only sigh when it came to that. The cultivation speed of the Nine Star Hegemon Body Art was truly slow.

BOOM!

Just then, a golden pillar of light erupted and a layer of gold seemed to appear on everything. A powerful aura shook the land.

“Late stage Four Peak realm!”

Bai Shishi had actually used half a day to advance to the late stage Four Peak realm. Golden light continued to shine out of her body with her breakthrough.

“That Devil Eye Water Lily’s metal seed really is terrifying. Bai Shishi had just advanced when we came out and she had yet to even stabilize her realm. But now she directly advanced to the seventh Heavenstage.” Long Chen was envious.

As a master of metal energy, Bai Shishi was blessed by heaven and earth. She had absorbed the energy of the lily seed to cultivate so quickly that it left everyone else in the dust. Now that she was in the late stage, her metal energy was several times greater than before. As long as she was careful, it was just barely possible for her to control the golden sword without suffering from a backlash.

At this moment, the golden light slowly retracted and her explosive aura also steadied. She had grown accustomed to her new realm.

It had to be known that for ordinary experts, making their aura steady after advancing might take ten to fifteen days. As for advancing to the late stage, they might need an entire month to stabilize their cultivation base. But Bai Shishi had finished in just a moment.

When Bai Shishi opened her eyes, a golden mark flickered in each of them. In a bit, the mark vanished and her aura returned to normal.

“Amazing.”

Long Chen was envious. Her aura was contained to the point where it was exactly the same as before. Her control was extremely strong, and she didn’t even need some time to adapt to her new power. She was already in control of her power, which had just grown explosively. That was almost outside the laws of the cultivation world.

Only now did Long Chen understand why Bai Shishi had wanted a day for her. So as soon as she had obtained the metal element seed, she had known that advancing to the late stage would be no problem for her.

Perhaps if she wasn’t afraid of her realm growing unstable, she would directly absorb more energy from the seed and advance three realms all the way to the Divine Lord realm.

The energy within the seed was the purest metal energy and contained no side effects. It was millions of times better than Four Peak Pills. It was truly a priceless treasure.

Bai Shishi’s eyes revealed her joy. Advancing with the help of the lily seed only caused her foundation to grow more solid. Now, she felt even closer to all the world’s metal energy, and she could control it freely.

With Bai Shishi having advanced to the late stage, Long Chen’s confidence inflated. He then brought them back to the Yuhua Prefecture and found the Huayun Trading Company’s headquarters there. He left the cores and dragon hides for Zheng Wenlong to handle.

Zheng Wenlong’s business would have to grow to a certain level before he would be given greater authority. Long Chen also needed him to have more authority to help him find more treasures.

After dealing with that matter and chatting a bit for politeness, Long Chen asked the manager of this branch, “Is there anything fun going on in the nearby domains?”

“You really did ask. Just yesterday, in the neighboring Heavenly Rainbow Domain, the Heavenly Rainbow manifestation appeared. It is said to be a sign that the Heavenly Rainbow Flame is on the verge of appearing. The experts of all the nearby domains have heard of it and are rushing over there,” said the manager.

“The Heavenly Rainbow Flame that is ranked ninth on the Heavenly Flame Rankings?!” Long Chen’s heart began to pound wildly.
