Chapter 4085 The Situation

“Mister Long Chen, the Soaring Dragon Company will send endless assassins after you, as they are afraid of you publicly announcing this matter. In my opinion, they’ll want to silence you as fast as possible.” The guild master turned to Long Chen gravely once the Soaring Dragon Company’s people left.

The guild master knew of the matter of the sacrifices, because back in the Violet Flame Heaven, Long Chen had passed this secret to the Huayun Trading Company.

However, Long Chen had not made this matter public and still kept it secret, waiting for a suitable moment to once more deal a grievous blow to the Soaring Dragon Company.

The Huayun Trading Company also didn’t expose this secret. After all, they were businessmen who focused on business, so they didn’t put much energy into such things.

Furthermore, since it was the secret that Long Chen discovered, if Long Chen didn’t make it public, they wouldn’t do it without Long Chen’s approval either.

“My enmity with them has long since reached the point of no stop until death. Also, there are plenty of people in this world who want to kill me. One Soaring Dragon Company won’t make the difference. If I don’t toy with them to death, how will I make it up for the Bai clan’s brother and sister? Anything is fine as long as it doesn’t implicate the Huayun Trading Company,” said Long Chen with a smile.

In truth, if Long Chen had announced this secret earlier, the Soaring Dragon Company would have simply pushed all the responsibility onto a few scapegoats, and after executing them for justice, this matter would have been covered.

Long Chen had long since seen through this play, which was why he was still waiting, or perhaps it should be said that now wasn’t the time yet. As for the pursuit of the Soaring Dragon Company, he really didn’t care.

Even if Heaven Venerates came after him, he could still run. And if they dared to attack him, he would dare to keep plundering their branches. It just so happened that he was worrying about not having a chance to get good treasures.

“Guild master, you mentioned that one of the reasons why the Huayun Trading Company isn’t as great as the Soaring Dragon Company in the Nirvana Overflow Heaven is because they use any means necessary for their business. Then is there another reason?” asked Long Chen suddenly.

On the way here, Long Chen had chatted with the guild master, and the latter had said that there were actually two main reasons.

One reason was that many sects and powers were followers of Lord Brahma, and so they chose to work with the Soaring Dragon Company. It was said that the Soaring Dragon Company had a close relationship with Lord Brahma.

However, some powers weren’t necessarily Lord Brahma’s subordinates, but they were afraid of the Soaring Dragon Company abusing their power to intimidate them, so they had no choice but to work with the crooks. Thus, the guild master said that the Soaring Dragon Company would use any means necessary to conduct business.

In truth, this wasn’t business. Frankly, it was being bandits. You had to do business with them whether you wanted to or not, or they would crush you.

These manners might appear lacking, but in truth, within the entire Nirvana Overflow Heaven, the human race’s powers were essentially like that.

For example, the Ye clan. Many powers had been extorted by the Ye clan to do what they wished.

There was no way around it. Even if they weren’t pressured by the Ye clan, other powers would subdue them. The Ye clan or the Soaring Dragon Company were all typical models of the human race in the Nirvana Overflow Heaven.

As for the Huayun Trading Company, they focused only on business and didn’t participate in these kinds of politics, not forcing anyone to buy or sell to them. Although their reputation was unmatched, and countless people wished to do business with them, these people simply didn’t have the guts.

Only some comparatively stronger powers dared to collaborate with the Huayun Trading Company without the need to fear the pressure from others. Some smaller powers also secretly collaborated with the Huayun Trading Company, but they were always tense and afraid of being discovered.

Thus, it was only natural that the Huayun Trading Company could not beat the Soaring Dragon Company. One was a nobleman; the other was a rogue.

“The second reason is due to the lack of medicinal pills that we can provide. Medicinal pills are the bloodline of any sect. In the Nirvana Overflow Heaven, the Sacred Pill Hall produces the majority of pills, and other than selling them themselves, they will also allow the Soaring Dragon Company to sell them. Thus, in order to obtain those pills, some powers have no choice but to collaborate with the Soaring Dragon Company,” said the guild master helplessly.

Long Chen came to a sudden understanding. It seemed that the Sacred Pill Hall used the carrot and stick method. If you wanted their medicinal pills, you had to collaborate with their side, or you would get no pills.

“But that doesn’t make sense. In the Violet Flame Heaven and the Darklight Heaven, the Huayun Trading Company’s pill production isn’t bad. Why can’t you provide pills in the Nirvana Overflow Heaven?” asked Long Chen.

“It is due to the difference in laws here. In the Nirvana Overflow Heaven, it is many times more difficult to refine pills. Furthermore, natives who consume pills refined outside this heaven will find that they are much less effective. There will even be signs of rejection. Thus, even when our alchemists come to the Nirvana Overflow Heaven, we have great difficulty producing medicinal pills. The effect is worse, and the pill quality cannot be improved. This has been a problem for countless years, and we’ve never managed to find a good solution,” said the guild master.

“There was such a thing? But Qingxuan was still refining pills yesterday, and she wasn’t affected,” said Long Chen.

“What? That’s impossible!” Now, it was the guild master’s turn to be shocked.

However, it was true. Yu Qingxuan had refined pills yesterday, but for fear of causing a disturbance, she had intentionally only refined treasure pills, not golden pills.

In truth, she had been paying close attention to the influence of the Heavenly Daos in the Nirvana Overflow Heaven on her Pill Dao. After all, she was very dedicated to the Pill Dao.

After hearing this, the guild master quickly gathered dozens of alchemists. They then all gathered in the Huayun Trading Company’s specific alchemy room.

Yu Qingxuan refined a furnace of pills in front of them. This time, she didn’t hold back, and that very day, tribulation clouds gathered in the sky, stunning the guild master and the alchemists around.

It had to be known that they had been refining pills here for countless years, but it was their first time seeing tribulation lightning.

When the lid opened, they saw two top grade golden pills. Even having watched the refinement, they still found it inconceivable.

“How can this be? Do you come from the Sacred Pill Hall?” asked an alchemist.

Long Chen and Yu Qingxuan were startled, and a sudden bout of comprehension directly struck them.

“Could it be…?”

Although the two didn’t say it, they were thinking the same thing—Dongfang Zichu.

The Sacred Pill Hall was one of Lord Brahma’s four halls. As for Dongfang Zichu, he was an alchemy master, as well as a servant of Lord Brahma. Thus, he had to have a close relationship with the Sacred Pill Hall, and perhaps he even came from there.

In order to lower Yu Qingxuan’s guard, and considering her shocking talent in the area of alchemy, he must have transmitted all his alchemy techniques to her. If not, Yu Xiaoyun would not have trusted him.

In Dongfang Zichu’s view, Yu Qingxuan would be sacrificed sooner or later, so he had no misgivings about transmitting techniques to someone who would die soon. Doing so allowed him to gain their full trust.

However, Dongfang Zichu didn’t pass on too many skills in terms of fighting. One reason was because Yu Qingxuan wasn’t interested, while another reason was because he didn’t wish for her to grow too strong to the point that she couldn’t be controlled. Thus, in order to keep her vulnerable, he merely transmitted his full alchemy skills to her.Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

So, the fact that Yu Qingxuan was still able to refine pills with the same ease as before without being affected by the laws of the Heavenly Daos was all thanks to Dongfang Zichu.

“I wonder if…” started one elder.

“Mister Zisong! Please conduct yourself with dignity,” said the guild master. He knew what this elder wanted to say.

Yu Qingxuan looked at Long Chen. Seeing him nod, she smiled.

“It’s alright. I can transmit my alchemy skills to all of you.”

Upon hearing this, even the guild master revealed an expression of absolute joy. They couldn’t quite believe their ears.
