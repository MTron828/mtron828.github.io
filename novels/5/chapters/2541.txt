Chapter 2530 Guo Ran Happily Obtains a Cornucopia

Two emerald leaves appeared on Long Chen’s back. They were glistening with dew and filled with thrumming life energy.

They were like wings, and when they spread, lines of vitality automatically fell from them. In their presence, the wrecked land began to give birth to countless shoots, and even barren rocks instantly sprouted greenery.

“What dense life energy!”

Both Chu Yao and Liu Ruyan cried out at the same time. Even as wood element cultivators, they had never witnessed such life energy.

The soft shoots that were breaking out of the ground were not seeds that had been germinated but shattered fragments of seeds, things that could be considered nothing more than the dust of heaven and earth. But they had been activated by those green leaves.

Lifeless dust had actually awakened into a wave of greenery. One seed after another was stabbing roots into hard soil.

Everyone stared in shock at Long Chen. Most of them were unaware of just how dire his state had been at the very end.

He was not actually capable of using the full power of the Six Star Battle Armor and was only able to utilize a tiny fraction of its power.

However, just now, Ye Ming’s power had tried to charge into the six stars, provoking them. As a result, world-destroying power had erupted out of them.

If that power had been allowed to erupt, Long Chen’s body would have been blasted to bits. The explosion might have even destroyed the entire Star Field Divine World.

Just as he was about to explode, a drop of life energy fell from one of the tree’s roots and onto Long Chen.

Long Chen’s body, which had been on the verge of collapse, instantly recovered. The power of the six stars in a berserk state also calmed down gradually.

The emerald leaves on his back were filled with endless life energy. Long Chen could feel it healing all his internal wounds and filling him with energy.

As for Zhao Ritian, he had charged over just at that time. He wanted Long Chen’s corpse. As for whether it was due to his anger or if he was just acting, no one knew.

Everyone wanted Long Chen’s secrets. Just what was he relying on to go from an ordinary fellow to his current level.

Whether it was greed or rage, that had resulted in Zhao Ritian throwing himself onto a path of death. Before he could find Long Chen’s “corpse”, Long Chen found him.

He had thought that even if Long Chen wasn’t dead, he would be on his last breath. In his carelessness, Long Chen stabbed him through the heart.

The leaves on Long Chen’s back pulsed with a gentle light that filled this bloodthirsty and violent world, dyeing it a peaceful color.

The Luo Spirit race’s experts all knelt and wept upon seeing that pair of leaves. Even the prophet was no exception. They were far too familiar with that aura. It was the most primal summons from the depths of their souls.

The mother tree had her own spirit, and she had used her energy to help Long Chen. They were finally about to reclaim their home.

Zhao Ritian twisted on Evilmoon, trying to escape. However, sharp cracking sounds rang out instead. He was unable to escape.

If it was before, Zhao Ritian could easily have caused his body to split apart. After all, he had an undying body. As long as his energy didn’t run out, he would never die.

However, Long Chen had activated the Six Star Battle Armor. With the increase in his power, Evilmoon’s power also soared. Hence, it was like there were hooks throughout Zhao Ritian’s entire body, and he was unable to escape.

Zhao Ritian panicked. Last time, he had also fallen into Long Chen’s hands, but he had always thought that it was because he had been too careless. As long as he was careful, Long Chen wouldn’t have another chance to catch him.

However, now he had fallen into Long Chen’s hands once more. Thinking of how Long Chen had just killed the Six Horn Sea Serpent and Dongfang Yuyang with three Emperor manifestations, he felt fear.

“Feng Fei, save me!” shouted Zhao Ritian. He knew begging or threatening Long Chen was useless

Feng Fei’s expression was complicated. She finally sighed, “Long Chen, release Zhao Ritian. You’ve won this time.”

Long Chen raised his head and laughed disdainfully. “How laughable. Do you think that this is a game?”

“Long Chen, I know you’re very angry. But I hope you won’t get lost in that anger. If you kill Zhao Ritian, the Zhao family of the divine families will hunt you down with their full power. The Martial Heaven Continent is only so big. Where will you run to? Are you going to implicate all the people beside you and get them killed as well?” implored Feng Fei.

Evilmoon suddenly shook and a scream rang out.

“AHHH!” Zhao Ritian suddenly became covered by black light from Evilmoon. His body shrank.

Evilmoon was actually compressing him, giving him endless pain. This was a pain he had never experienced before. It was like someone was skinning him.

“If you want to kill me, then come. I no longer care. I’ve had enough of you arrogant idiots. Starting today, I will not take a single step back for anyone. If you have the guts, come at me. But if you can’t kill me, get ready to be killed by me,” said Long Chen darkly. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Long Chen hadn’t wanted to offend the divine families. They were so powerful that he could only look up to them. To be enemies with them was the peak of foolishness.

However, the divine families’ people had gone too far. Long Chen’s restraint had only brought him humiliation and a mass of killers.

Long Chen was filled with fury, which stemmed from his own weakness. He needed time to grow, but his enemies weren’t giving him any time.

The more he tried to be accommodating, the more some people liked to press him for more. Restraint only made others think that you were afraid of them. Since you were afraid, it would be easy to bully you.

Long Chen had had enough. Today, he would become mortal enemies with the divine families. Weren’t the divine families very amazing? Didn’t they think everyone had to listen to them? Today, he would show them that he wasn’t afraid of the divine families.

“AHH! Long Chen, please, release me! I’m going to die!” wailed Zhao Ritian.

Black qi continued to surge out of Evilmoon, and black spots began to appear over Zhao Ritian’s body. Those black spots gradually turned to bone, and large chunks of them began to fall out of Zhao Ritian. With every piece that fell out of him, Zhao Ritian screamed in pain.

“Long Chen, do you really not care about the consequences?!” shouted Feng Fei.

“Consequences? Did you think about the consequences when you targeted me? When you killed the disciples of the Martial Heaven Alliance, did you ever think about the consequences? Since you didn’t, why should I? I want to kill Zhao Ritian. Even if a Sovereign came, they wouldn’t be able to stop me,” sneered Long Chen. Evilmoon’s black qi continued to grow denser. Zhao Ritian’s screams were chilling.

Feng Fei turned ashen. She didn’t have the slightest way to force Long Chen to stop.

She knew that once Long Chen killed Zhao Ritian, the Martial Heaven Continent would be thrown into chaos.

Zhao Ritian’s screams finally began to fade as he shrank down into a one-foot ball. Even with him on the verge of death, Feng Fei didn’t know what to do to stop it.

“Boss… about that… I know you’re very angry, but…” At this moment, Guo Ran suddenly stepped forward, looking at Long Chen hesitatingly.

“If you have a fart to say, say it,” barked Long Chen.

This made Guo Ran relax. Before this, Long Chen’s aura had truly grown foreign to him, making him not dare to speak. But now he knew that this was the boss he was familiar with.

“Well, I want to ask you not to kill him for now,” said Guo Ran with a fawning smile.

This request startled everyone. Guo Ran was pleading for leniency for Zhao Ritian?

“You want him?” Long Chen was startled but then thought of something.

“Yes. You also know that the Dragonblood Legion is a big business that requires plenty of resources. Good steel should be used on the edge of the blade, hehe… Boss, I’m sure you understand,” said Guo Ran.

Long Chen instantly realized what he wanted. “Can you handle him?”

“Boss, don’t worry, from the moment I saw him, I already started discussing a method with Xia Chen. Take a look.” Guo Ran took out his forging table. This forging table from an ancient tomb had always been with Guo Ran and had countless uses.

At this moment, a furnace on the forging table opened up. Looking at it, Long Chen hesitated but then tossed the shrunken Zhao Ritian inside.

The forging table shrank down into Guo Ran’s hand. He immediately began to laugh. “We’re rich, we’re rich!”

They were truly rich now. There were countless precious ore deposits in the Wild World that the original devil race had found. However, they had never managed to fully excavate it. As long as they tossed Zhao Ritian inside, they could force him to gather those precious metals and become an endless cornucopia of precious metals. They now had a limitless stock of immortal and divine metal.

It was only due to this point that Long Chen had suppressed his desire to kill Zhao Ritian. He trusted Guo Ran and Xia Chen. They could definitely make sure Zhao Ritian had a life worse than death. Killing him was letting him off too easily.

Seeing that Long Chen didn’t kill Zhao Ritian, Feng Fei relaxed. As long as Zhao Ritian wasn’t dead, there was still a chance for things to take a turn for the better.

Just at that moment, Long Chen suddenly vanished. At the same time, startled cries rang out.

“Where’s Ye Ming?!”
