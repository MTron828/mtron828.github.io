Chapter 3984 Eyes Growing Out of Your Butt

Philosopher Sun’s fortitude was clearly much greater than his disciples’. Although flames of anger were about to burst out of his head, he didn’t curse back.

He had already given his parable and taken the advantage. If he were to instead end up quibbling with Long Chen over this matter, he would appear to be lacking self-cultivation.

Long Chen waved the teapot and smiled. “Sharp mouth, big belly, high ears, it comes to the dragon table proudly. But compared to the vast sea, it is ultimately too small to carry anything. It can only be used to cause a splash.”

This was Long Chen’s true response. Upon hearing this, everyone stared at him in shock. He truly had talent in this regard.

He was mocking Philosopher Sun for thinking himself great just because he sat in his position, while inside, he was lacking anything substantial. In fact, his final sentence was clearly saying that he didn’t have much learning and was only showing off whatever abilities he had. It was the exact case of a half-empty bottle making the most noise.

Philosopher Sun’s expression sank. For a moment, he was unable to find a reply.

The emperor, empresses, and concubines were all stunned. As for the princes and princesses, they were already prostrating themselves toward Long Chen in admiration. In this empire, matching wits with a Philosopher of this caliber was likely akin to facing off against a formidable three-flower expert.

“To not reciprocate is against etiquette. You say that me wearing a casual dress for an important event is against etiquette. But you have no idea what the true meaning of my clothes is, and I can’t be bothered to explain it to you. Since you care so much about my clothes, I will use clothing as a response,” sneered Long Chen.

Long Chen’s gaze then roved across the room. He suddenly saw a woman in the murals who was working hard on embroidery with a needle in her hand, her head lowered over her work.

The needle in her hand was golden with a silver tip. It was precisely the kind of precious needle that imperial maidens used.

“A silver needle soaked in gold, weaving up and down the fabric. Eyes growing out of your butt, seeing only clothing, not people.”

People were left dumbfounded. Long Chen was truly a vicious character. Was he really planning on fighting Philosopher Sun to the death without leaving the slightest leeway?

Just before, he had said that Philosopher Sun wasn’t qualified for his position, and now he was even more direct, saying that the latter was short-sighted. No matter how much the imperial family cared about him, a needle was still just a needle. Even if it was gilded in gold and painted with silver, it was just a needle. There was nothing for him to be proud of.

Just now, Philosopher Sun had used the sunflower to say that Long Chen was attempting to climb through society by forgetting his parents, and he utilized the willow to say that Long Chen was wild and conceited, saying that he would face his retribution sooner or later. But Long Chen’s counterattack was even sharper than a blade.

As a result, Philosopher Sun was so enraged that he stood up and pointed at Long Chen, his whole body shaking with rage. However, Long Chen simply ignored him, pouring a cup of tea for Yu Qingxuan. He didn’t even look at Philosopher Sun, as if telling him to continue responding.

“Long Chen, you are being rude to Philosopher Sun. Quickly apologize.” At this time, Jiang Huixin suddenly spoke up.

She had no choice but to speak. It was because the banquet had yet to even start, but the atmosphere was already like this.

Long Chen looked at her. Although she was chiding him, he could see the encouragement and support in her eyes. She was very pleased with his beating of Philosopher Sun.

How could Long Chen not know what she meant? He smiled and said, “Hey, my little son- no, sorry, I misspoke, cough, Philosopher Sun…”

Pfft!

Yu Xiaoyun was in the midst of drinking tea, but he spat it out when he heard this.

“Your Majesty!” rebuked Jiang Huixin.

“Sorry… cough, it wasn’t on purpose,” said Yu Xiaoyun awkwardly.

Jiang Huixin glared at him before looking away. An emperor of a nation spat out tea during a state banquet? That was a loss of the state’s dignity.

“Long Chen, keep going…” Yu Xiaoyun hastily redirected everyone’s attention to Long Chen.

“Ah, Philosopher Sun, I’m sorry. You know, as a person, my mouth is faster than my head. Maybe I said something wrong, so I hope you won’t mind. This can just count as friends fighting, no? Next time, why don’t we exchange pointers again when we’re alone?” apologized Long Chen.

He naturally had to listen to his mother-in-law as he was still hoping for her to support him.

“Hmph, do you think that I would quibble with a baby like you?” Philosopher Sun snorted and sat back down.

However, many people could hear that he was afraid. Long Chen had managed to get the last word. In essence, Philosopher Sun had lost.

Seeing Long Chen apologize gratified Yu Qingxuan as she understood Long Chen’s temper the best. A person who could force Long Chen to concede had yet to be born.

However, for her, Long Chen was willing to apologize. She knew that this was something that betrayed his principles. Of everyone present, only she knew just how proud of a person Long Chen was.

All of a sudden, she reached out her hand and held Long Chen’s, startling him. Yu Qingxuan had taken the initiative. When he looked into her eyes, his heart warmed, but he also felt a pang of guilt.

This little concession was nothing compared to her undergoing a thousand reincarnations for him. What he owed her could not be repaid in this life or even ten lives after.

As their gazes locked, this short moment felt like an eternity. They didn’t even hear when the feast started or what the emperor was saying. It was only when the attendants started placing food on their table that they were drawn out of their stupor.

The two of them then smiled and started eating. At this banquet, the wine flowed freely and the food was excellent. There was also entertainment, with singers and dancers. Long Chen even asked Yu Qingxuan why they hadn’t invited the fairies of the Zither Sect over.

Hearing this question, Yu Qinguxan almost burst into laughter. Did he really think that the Zither Sect could be asked to play just for anyone? Only then did Long Chen understand that the Zither Sect didn’t even place the imperial family in their eyes. If they wanted to play for them, they would. If they didn’t, nothing could make them play.

“Long Chen, your little debate just now was very marvelous. I didn’t expect that your mouth was not at all inferior to your fists,” said someone suddenly.

The one speaking was an expert from the Heavenly Ruler Seal Empire and a true Double Supreme at that. Even though he was smiling at Long Chen, that smile didn’t reach his eyes.VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

“If you have something to say, just say it. There’s no need to set up a whole stage. We’re all busy. If you want to talk, let’s talk. If you want to fight, then I’ll happily accompany you.” Long Chen picked up a napkin and wiped his mouth, looking at this guy indifferently.

He knew that the good show was just starting. At the same time though, he smelled something off. It seemed that now he would learn why the emperor had invited him to this state banquet.
