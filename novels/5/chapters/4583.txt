Chapter 4572 Friendly Suggestion

“What are you doing?!”

After Long Chen vanished, the scarred man could only vent toward the elder. He roared furiously, death qi swirling around him.

“I satisfied your desire. I sent you to the Nethergod race’s inheritance land,” replied the elder indifferently.

“Then why did you bring me back?! Are you toying with me?!” shouted the scarred man.

“Because I had to satisfy that little fellow’s desire,” answered the elder just as indifferently as before.

“What does that mean?” demanded the scarred man gloomily.

“His desire was to bring you back, and I had to fulfill it.”

“You...!” The scarred man’s face darkened with rage, and he roared with fury, “By fulfilling his desire, you ruined mine! You ridiculous old man, is there something wrong with your brain?!”

This scarred man had clearly gone crazy with fury to actually dare to curse this unfathomable elder. Clearly consumed by rage, the scarred man had lost all restraint.

“I fulfilled your desire. You asked me to send you to the inheritance land of the Nethergod race, and I did. As for how long you would stay or if someone else would call you back, you never said anything about it,” said the elder calmly.

“You...!” The scarred man quivered with rage. “I want a new desire! Bring that fellow back!”

“Sorry, your desire has been fulfilled. You cannot make a new one.” The elder shook his head.

“He’s now first, and I’m second! Didn’t you say that the first two get to have their desire fulfilled?!”

“In reality, he really is first and you are second. But in theory, you are still first,” declared the elder.

“What the fuck does theory have to do with it?! This is real life!” roared the scarred man.

“Sorry, but whether it is in theory or reality, rules are rules. Two desires have been fulfilled, and there will not be a third.” The elder shook his head as he looked at the scarred man with a hint of sympathy. “Other than that, this old man will give you a friendly suggestion. During the time you have been shouting at me, eight waves of experts have entered the gate. Adding in Long Chen, it’s nine waves. If you don’t go in now, you won’t even be in the top ten.”

The scarred man was startled. Raising his head, he saw that countless figures were charging into the gate, and they didn’t even seem to see him shouting.

“You really piss me off!”

The scarred man roared and jumped onto his chariot. With a shout, the bone horse charged toward the gate.

If he couldn’t be in the top ten, he would likely be transported to somewhere outside the core region. If he was too far away, the others would have taken all the treasures before he got to them.

“You shitty old man, you actually colluded with that brat against me! Just wait for when I return!” roared the scarred man from the chariot.

BOOM!

Suddenly, three-colored divine radiance erupted, forming a barrier in front of the gate, catching the scarred man off guard. The horse and chariot then collided with the barrier, surprising the scarred man as he hadn’t anticipated anyone daring to plot against him in this place.

The barrier shook under the force, and both horse and chariot bounced off from the impact.

“Three-color divine shield? The Three-Headed Heaven Devouring Beast’s divine ability?! The fellow from the Underworld race, you are courting death!”

The scarred man quickly realized the origin of this barrier; it was one of the abilities of the Three-Headed Heaven Devouring Beast race. It was said that this divine ability could connect the heavens, the earth, and the man—the power of all three worlds, so there was nothing that could break through it.

It was only because this barrier was so powerful that it possessed the ability to block the bone horse and bronze chariot.

“Sorry, but there is no mercy on the path of cultivation. This is simply part of the competition between us as cultivators. I hope it won’t harm the friendship between the Underworld race and the Nethergod race.” A powerful voice rang out. Following that, a bald man appeared, leading countless experts of the Underworld race charging through the gate. It was Wu Hun.

Wu Hun had led his army in a wild charge, but he was startled to find many experts here. There were actually eight factions faster than him, aside from the mixed beast race.

They barely managed to secure a spot in the top ten until the scarred man suddenly emerged. Moreover, the bald man was slightly faster than them. If he got by, Wu Hun and his army wouldn’t be in the top ten any longer.

The top ten was an extremely important dividing line, so Wu Hun was determined to fight for it. He would rather offend the scarred man than let him through.

Incensed by Long Chen’s scheming, the scarred man seethed with anger. His arrogance blinded him, and he never anticipated anyone daring to stand in his way, making him excessively overconfident.

“Friendship my ass!” The scarred man cursed furiously, charging back. However, he had already lost the initiative and could only watch as Wu Hun’s group entered. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Just before entering the gate, Wu Hun asked, “You have a horse and chariot. Once you’re in the Fantasy Spirit World, you can go wherever you want, no? Why be so petty? What about the style of an expert?”

“Fuck your style!” cursed the scarred man furiously. Wu Hun had schemed against him and then told him that he had lost the style of an expert? That was far too shameless, wasn’t it?

BOOM!

The bone horse charged into the gate, but it was half a breath slower than the others. At this time, dozens of factions were also charging into the gate, so no one knew who was in what place.

Seeing the horse vanish, the elder in front of the gate smiled rather oddly.

“This generation’s youngsters really are lively! It must be nice to be young!”

After saying that, the elder slowly grew translucent and faded away, as if he had never existed in the first place.

...

The void quivered, revealing Feng You and the rest of the mixed beast race’s experts atop a large mountain.

“Long Chen?! Where is Long Chen?!” Feng You shouted. The rest of the mixed beast race also looked around hastily. The transportation was complete, but Long Chen was gone.

“Big Brother Long Chen must have been sent somewhere else. After all, he’s from the human race,” said one of them.

Everyone else nodded as that was the only possible explanation. Being among the first ones to enter this place, they were probably assigned to locations that suited them the most.

However, they had only entered thanks to Long Chen. Now that he was gone, it seemed as though they had lost a vital support pillar for their mental stability, leaving them with a profound sense of emptiness.

“Quick, look! What’s that?” A startled cry pierced the air. Not far from their location, a big spatial crack had materialized, catching their attention.

“Heavens, this is the entrance to the Esoteric Spirit World! We’re right here!”

“The Esoteric Spirit World is the origin of our mixed beast race’s inheritance. It’s standing here right before us!”

All the mixed beast race’s experts were excited. While they knew that the Esoteric Spirit World’s entrance was somewhere in the Fantasy Spirit World, finding the entrance in this enormous world was like searching for a needle in an ocean. However, they were now right in front of it; their luck was truly heaven-defying.

Feng You took a deep breath. After suppressing her concern for Long Chen, she said, “Let’s go! We’ll find our mixed beast race’s inheritance within the Esoteric Spirit World!”

All the mixed beast race’s experts charged into the spatial gate, vanishing.
