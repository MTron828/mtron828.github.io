Chapter 3189 An Ocean of Devil Corpses

The fact that the High Firmament Academy was attacked shook the entire Heavenly Swell Domain. However, thinking about it, Long Chen had killed Gui Yun right in front of Enpuda. There was no way that a World King wouldn’t retaliate.

However, it had to be known that the High Firmament Academy was the oldest academy within the nine heavens and ten lands. Its foundation ran shockingly deep. Although it had declined, no matter how far it declined, it was still the High Firmament Academy.

Lord Brahma’s power in the immortal world was immense, and countless sects had submitted to him. But the High Firmament Academy always ignored his threat.

Even after so many years, no matter how dissatisfied Lord Brahma was with the High Firmament Academy, he was unable to launch a frontal assault.

Now, Enpuda had sent out a sneak attack on the academy. This matter was probably not as simple as it seemed on the surface.

Perhaps Gui Yun’s death gave Lord Brahma’s side the excuse to start a war with the High Firmament Academy. After all, Enpuda had sent a probing blow. This might be the premonition of a fight to the death between these two colossal figures.

Countless sects shivered with fear and trepidation. Some old monsters announced that they were ‘going into seclusion’, while the disciples were sternly forbidden from taking half a step outside of the sect.

However, some sects had sent people to the Bloodkill Hall just to show their loyalty to Lord Brahma.

Although a hundred sects were nothing compared to the total number of sects in the Heavenly Swell Domain, it had to be mentioned that these hundred sects all ranked near the top in terms of strength.

According to actual power, they represented half of the Heavenly Swell Domain’s strength. Moreover, they had no choice but to stand on Enpuda’s side because Long Chen had said that when he advanced to the Four Peak realm, if their sects had yet to disband, he would destroy them.

Their inheritances stretched back tens of thousands of years, so how could they allow such an inheritance to vanish because of one man’s threat? Hence, they had no choice but to bind themselves to Enpuda’s thick leg.

After the sneak attack on the High Firmament Academy, no further movements occurred. As a result, countless rumors swirled throughout the Heavenly Swell Domain. They were mostly saying that the High Firmament Academy had completely decayed to the point that they were an empty shell. They weren’t a match for the Bloodkill Hall.

It was said that during this attack, the Bloodkill Hall had only sent a single outer domain’s branch sect. However, when the six other branch halls gathered, even an Immortal King might appear, and their number of Primal Divine Lords would be in the hundreds. That was enough power to sweep through the Heavenly Swell Domain.

Clearly, Enpuda was truly enraged. At this moment, no one had a high opinion of the High Firmament Academy’s chances.

One day… two days… three days… Time passed bit by bit. No news came from the High Firmament Academy. It was on the fourth day when a rumor spread that a group of Primal assassins from the Bloodkill Hall had slipped into the High Firmament Academy’s inner academy to kill their disciples.

However, those assassins were killed by the academy’s experts as soon as they charged in. But they still killed a few disciples.

Those assassins were death warriors who had been sent with almost no hope of returning alive. They only went in to kill people. This rumor shook countless experts. The Bloodkill Hall was truly terrifying.

However, no news came from the High Firmament Academy. Even the arrogant and domineering Long Chen didn’t make a single sound. Hence, countless people cursed him for being a coward hiding in his tortoise shell. This unlucky star was about to bring down the entire High Firmament Academy.

Thanks to the waves pushed on by certain people, Long Chen was turned into an irredeemable villain. All his heroism was faked. They repeatedly threw whatever dirty water they could on him, but no response came.

No one knew that just as everyone was eyeing the High Firmament Academy, a batch of products from the Huayun Trading Company was sent over.

“Many thanks.”

When Long Chen looked at the mountains of devil beast corpses within the various trunks, he was extremely grateful.

“Mister Long Chen is too courteous. Manager Xuan Ming has said that no matter what you want, we are to do everything we can to help. There are one hundred seventy-six thousand five hundred and forty-five devil beast corpses here. There are five hundred at the late stage Divine Lord realm, one thousand six hundred and twenty-six at the mid stage, eighteen thousand three hundred at the early stage, and the rest at the Four Peak realm. This is currently our entire stock in the Heavenly Swell Domain. After all, devil beast corpses aren’t one of our main businesses. They are mostly collected by some subordinates, so we don’t have any higher quality ones. My apologies,” said the person from the Huayun Trading Company who had come.

Long Chen had originally wanted the High Firmament Academy to help him gather a large number of devil beast corpses. However, the academy always split apart the corpses and threw away the flesh, leaving behind only the important crystal core and valuable parts.

However, Long Chen needed their flesh. It was the crystal cores that were worthless to him. Thus, he went to ask the Huayun Trading Company for help.

Long Chen didn’t know if it was due to the matter of the Nine Prefecture Convention causing Xuan Ming to feel like he owed Long Chen a debt, but the Huayun Trading Company directly started gathering these corpses in large numbers. Even some mercenaries' devil corpses were bought just for Long Chen.

It went without saying that they were truly dependable. Whether it was the Martial Heaven Continent’s Huayun Sect or the current Huayun Trading Company, they had never let Long Chen down.

After sending off that person, Long Chen directly tossed the devil corpses into the primal chaos space’s black soil. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

The giant area of black soil was like a gaping maw that would never get full. Those devil beast corpses were gigantic but were quickly devoured. After that, Life energy spread throughout the primal chaos space.

The Wood Foundation Divine Trees grew extremely slowly. But with this nourishment, they began growing at a rate visible to the naked eye.

They grew straight up, both slender and long like javelins. It was only once they reached an astonishing height that they began to sprout.

With a bunch of leaves on them, they finally appeared a bit more like trees. They were no longer just bare poles.

However, after that, their growth rate slowed down once more. They stopped shooting straight up and began to thicken. They were originally so thin that you could wrap your arms around them, but after two hours of devouring this life energy, they had reached a diameter of three meters, and marks had also appeared on the tree bark. They no longer appeared to be giant saplings.

In just a short six hours, those devil beast corpses were all devoured. As for the Wood Foundation Divine Trees, they had reached a width surpassing six meters. Every single one of them contained an astonishing amount of life energy.

“Excellent. With such a powerful shield, no matter how many injuries I take, I won’t have to worry.”

It was already the sixth day when he was done. On this day, he dragged Qin Feng over to Bai Xiaole’s mother.

“Senior, please bring us on a trip to the Falling Sunset Prefecture’s Bloodkill Hall. The time for them to repay their blood debt has come.”
