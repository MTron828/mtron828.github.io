Chapter 4043 Eight Great Divine Commanders

Following Enpuda’s gaze, they looked toward an empty space. To their surprise, a mesmerizing and ethereal figure began to materialize there, slowly taking form before their eyes.

She donned an exquisite outfit, a combination of elegance and power. Her skin-tight leather armor accentuated her graceful curves, reminiscent of a majestic and fierce leopardess. The sight was both alluring and intimidating, leaving onlookers in awe.

Even as she materialized before them, everyone couldn’t really sense her. It was as if she was intertwined with the void, remaining elusive even to those who looked directly at her.

She seemed to embody the world itself, as though she held its very essence within her being. It was as if she was the master of the world, and a mere thought from her could wipe out all life in an instant.

She had short hair and thin lips, with long, narrow eyes and a fair complexion. Her beauty carried a deadly allure.

However, when looking at her, there was no way to form the desire between men and women; instead, there was only fear. When she looked at you, it was like the blade of death was pressed against your throat.

In front of her, it was as if all your weaknesses were fully exposed, fatal weaknesses that could not be concealed.

She was a legendary existence of the immortal world, the master of the Shadow Sect, and the one who was called the Silence of the Night, Ye Wusheng.

The Silence of the Night was both the name of her manifestation and her moniker. It was a name that caused countless experts to quiver in fear.

“As expected, only you have the ability to cut off my ties to Lord Brahma’s faith. I just don’t understand, are you truly challenging Lord Brahma to war?” Despite Enpuda being left with only his head, and even with the wound to his neck slowly rotting away, he still remained remarkably calm.

“You antagonized me back then, so I wanted to kill you. Lord Brahma did stop me then, so I warned him that he could protect you for the moment but not for a lifetime. No one that I want to kill has yet to survive. However, after my fight with Lord Brahma, I broke through. Killing you then would be meaningless. That is when I decided I would have my most outstanding disciple take your head. It would count as their greatest trial. Whoever could accomplish this would receive my full legacy.

“On the surface, you appear to have hidden yourself away and not dare to leave your hole with your true body, instead using avatars to do your business. But in truth, your true body did leave many times. You were testing me, seeing if I would pursue you. So, I pretended not to notice, and you thought it was because I was afraid of Lord Brahma. In truth, every single one of your movements was under my gaze. I was just waiting for the right opportunity. When you started plotting to kill Long Chen here, I had little Yu prepare herself. I knew that the opportunity had come, and Little Yu really didn’t disappoint me. In the Immortal King realm, she killed you who is at the peak of the World King realm. This also shows that the nine heavens and ten lands is progressing to a new era. None of us are the main characters of this era, not me, not you, not even Lord Brahma. We are all part of a larger story, playing our roles, but none of us holds the spotlight. This is a completely new era. The laws that we could not break back then will be broken by them,” said Ye Wusheng expressionlessly.

Upon hearing this, everyone’s heart shook. Lord Brahma was a legendary existence, and his name had resounded throughout heaven and earth eras ago.

Although he suddenly vanished at his most glorious time, the legends of him were known to all.

At that time, Lord Brahma was a glorious, fast-rising genius who reached the very peak of the Heaven Venerate realm. However, he suddenly went into seclusion, with only his apprentices and their grand apprentices doing his work.

Countless years passed; geniuses rose and fell. However, the name of Lord Brahma was still known to all.

However, this woman had actually fought Lord Brahma in the past? Then she had to be someone from the same era.

Clearly, although Ye Wusheng also had a degree of fame, it was mostly limited to the senior generation. The youngsters in the Vermilion Bird Empire had not heard of her.

That was why Zhu Yifeng, Zhu Yunwen, and the others were all stunned. They had never dreamed that someone from that ancient era would appear before them now. Could a person really live so long?

This short-haired woman who looked to be in her thirties was actually such an ancient figure? However, she seemed to be full of life. Had she really lived for that many years?

Enpuda sighed. “You are right. I didn’t have your vision. Although I also knew that the new era would arise, I thought that it would be centuries from now. I was always very confident in my calculations, but it was that confidence that brought about my ruin. If I had your vision, I would have paid any price to kill Long Chen at the start. I was too conceited. I have let down Lord Brahma’s trust in me.”

Enpuda’s tone was very regretful as he blamed himself. He had always viewed Long Chen as an important figure, and he had even been thinking of pulling Long Chen to his side.

However, he found out later that there was no way to control Long Chen. He always liked to use the smallest price to make the greatest gains. But when it came to Long Chen, he had actually misjudged, and very badly at that. All his schemes ended up useless. In the end, he suffered a grievous defeat, one from which he could not recover.

“You always thought yourself smart. You know to be meticulous, down to the smallest detail. Perhaps that is perfect for doing small things, but when it comes to accomplishing anything major, you lack decisiveness and daring. That is why you only remained the master of an outer hall. You were never able to be promoted to the inner hall or to rank amongst Lord Brahma’s eight great divine commanders. If you were one of the eight divine commanders, I would not be able to sever your tie to Lord Brahma’s faith. Even though he is in seclusion, he would definitely come save you then. Unfortunately, there are not so many ifs in this world. Even a wise man who considers everything a thousand times will make a mistake eventually. With this one mistake, you have no chance of winning anymore,” said Ye Wusheng.

Enpuda smiled bitterly. “That is correct. There are not so many ifs in this world. I have to thank you. You have made me understand why Lord Brahma never valued me highly. I understand now. This chess piece is too small to be useful. But understanding now is too late. In the end, I still failed to live up to Lord Brahma’s expectations.”

Long Chen was originally enraged and wanted to slice Enpuda apart, but seeing Enpuda acting like this before his death, without any trace of cowardice or blaming others, Long Chen had to acknowledge that Enpuda was undoubtedly the most cunning adversary he had ever faced. As he calmly watched Enpuda's life come to an end, a sliver of respect crept into Long Chen's heart.

“Enpuda, as your enemy, I am willing to give you a dignified death,” said Long Chen.

“Hahahaha!” Enpuda suddenly laughed.Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m
