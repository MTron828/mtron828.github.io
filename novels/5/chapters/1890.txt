Chapter 1880: Giant Tomb

“You mean we should arrange something special?” Mo Nian’s eyes lit up .

“What do you think?” Long Chen wriggled his eyebrows .

“The main thing is that I don’t have anything good,” said Mo Nian helplessly .

“What about this?” Long Chen took out the Blazing Dragon Cauldron . There were quite a few giant ants trapped within it .

“My god, Heaven Devouring Ants!”

“Hehe, do you think they’re enough?”

“They’re definitely enough . ” Mo Nian was delighted as if he was looking at a treasure .

“What are you two talking about?” Yue Xiaoqian looked at Long Chen and Mo Nian blankly .

Long Chen said, “If nothing unexpected happens to him, Di Feng will quickly return . We’re thinking of preparing a welcoming gift for him . ”

Di Feng had been at a disadvantage before, pressed from both sides by Long Chen and Mo Nian . He had had no choice but to run . However, his injuries weren’t too bad . The majority of the impact had been absorbed by his armor . His spiritual yuan would also quickly recover with his manifestation .

Di Feng had entered this cave, but he hadn’t found the way deeper . He had been roaming the outside, which was how he had encountered Yue Xiaoqian .

He had wanted to capture her before continuing to research the cave . Before opening the cave, he was unwilling to leave .

Long Chen’s guess was that he would gather other experts . As long as he found another expert on his level, he would immediately rush back .

With Long Chen and Mo Nian both present, the scale of the battle would definitely be on a greater level if he returned . So Long Chen wanted to prepare something first .

“Any ideas on how to prepare it?” asked Mo Nian .

Long Chen shook his head . “I’m sure you’re better at traps . You’ve been doing archaeology for a long time, so you definitely know many mechanisms . You do it . ”

“Alright then . ” Mo Nian nodded and took out an elegant little trunk from his spatial ring . When he opened it, Long Chen saw countless unique tools . There were chisels, claws, axes, rulers, as well as runic seals, silk, etc .

“Are they all part of your profession?” asked Long Chen with surprise .

“But of course . As a pioneer of the archaeology world, the successor of the human race’s inheritance, how could I not have this little bit of ability?” said Mo Nian unashamedly . He took out a single strand of silk and pulled it over the ground .

“It’s actually the runic silkworm’s inscription silk?” exclaimed Yue Xiaoqian .

“You know it?” Now it was Mo Nian’s turn to be surprised . She even knew of such a thing from an isolated branch of knowledge .

Long Chen smiled . Yue Xiaoqian was extremely erudite . This had always been one of the points he had admired about her .

Seeing that Yue Xiaoqian merely smiled faintly, Mo Nian sensed that she didn’t like talking, so he continued with his work . He slowly arranged the silk .

This silk was very miraculous . When it met the ground, it actually merged into it . This silk was very precious . It needed to be branded with runes, and to brand runes to silk was a technique that had been lost with the years .

Mo Nian had found this kind of silk in ancient tombs . Fortunately, with the protection of the runes, these strands of silk hadn’t corroded, so he could reuse them .FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

In truth, Mo Nian had learned many things from his years of grave robbing . Many experts liked to leave some of their inheritances within their tombs . Some of those inheritances were brought into their coffins .

That was why some inheritances might be lost in the outside world but still exist within some ancient tombs . So Mo Nian did have some truth to his words when he said that he was continuing lost cultivation culture .

With Mo Nian at work, Long Chen pulled Yue Xiaoqian to the side and asked her about the original devil race .

Through her explanation, he learned that the original devil race was doing well . Their disciples were using the foreign Magical Beasts as whetstones for themselves . They were getting stronger day by day . Things were going even better than expected .

The only worrisome thing was that even now, they hadn’t managed to find any trace of Wilde . It was unknown where that child had run off to .

Yue Xiaoqian hadn’t been planning on entering the Yin Yang World originally, but these were the directions of the great prophet . Only now did Long Chen learn that the great prophet had passed on .

However, before leaving, she had told Yue Xiaoqian that she had to enter the Yin Yang World . As for why, she hadn’t said . The great prophet was already gone, so Yue Xiaoqian could only follow her instructions .

“Hey, have you made some mistake? I’m working myself so hard, but you are flirting with a girl? Long Chen, can you have some shame?” cursed Mo Nian once he was about done .

Yue Xiaoqian immediately blushed, while Long Chen indifferently shrugged . In just half an incense stick’s worth of time, Mo Nian was done .

There were no signs left on the ground . Even with Spiritual Strength, it was impossible to sense anything odd . It went without saying that Mo Nian was truly skilled at grave robbing .

The threads of silk had merged with the earth . When a strong enough expert stepped into this region, they would be triggered . Long Chen took out the Heaven Devouring Ants from the Blazing Dragon Cauldron . Knocking them out one by one, he handed them to Mo Nian .

Mo Nian took out a thumb-sized pot . That pot contained its own space, and he sent them inside . The Heaven Devouring Ants would be wrapped in runes when he moved them in, and they would rapidly shrink .

After arranging that, Mo Nian took out a stone tablet and placed it at the cave entrance . However, looking at it, he felt that it was lacking something .

“Long Chen, you should say a few words,” said Mo Nian .

“What words?”

“Whatever you think will anger Di Feng . ”

Long Chen thought about it and wrote a quick line with his finger . A line of bold words appeared: Di Feng, does your face hurt?

“Hahaha...” Mo Nian laughed . These words definitely contained killing power . Di Feng would go crazy as soon as he read it .

Mo Nian left a formation disc on the ground . Once the formation disc was activated, this place would be covered by an illusion, concealing the cave entrance . From a distance, it would be impossible to see anything odd about this place .

This was because Mo Nian was worried about someone other than Di Feng arriving first and activating the mechanism . Only Di Feng’s group knew this exact location, so this illusion would only be unable to fool them .

After arranging all this, the three of them walked into the cave . They reached the end in just a few miles .

There was a giant stone wall at the end with ancient runes on it . Paths had already been forcibly created to the two sides of this stone wall .

“These idiots don’t know anything . This place isn’t the entrance . Even if they searched for a decade, they wouldn’t be able to get in . As for the wall’s formation runes, as long as they aren’t suicidal, they wouldn’t dare to attack it . ” Mo Nian smiled . He suddenly took out a bizarre boat . The boat was ten meters long and had a drill at the front . “Come, get on . ”

Mo Nian brought Long Chen and Yue Xiaoqian aboard and then activated the boat . It began to dig straight down . The drill rapidly spun and pierced the ground .

“Amazing . ”

Who would have thought that after a few years apart, Mo Nian would learn so much? Long Chen raised a thumbs up at him .

“Hehe, this is what I use to eat . I should tell you that I’ve explored tens of thousands of ancient tombs now, and I’ve been busy every day . I can do over ten on a good day, and it’s all thanks to this little fellow . This place is a giant tomb, and the entrance should be four hundred miles below here . This place is the life-facing gate . In ancient times, most large tombs were structured this way,” said Mo Nian confidently .

“I don’t think so . The runes on the wall are swallowtail runes, something that only appears at the end of the tombs . If that’s the case, this place isn’t the entrance but the exit . Most exits are located at the bottom of the tomb . A Yang tomb is different from a Yin tomb . Their entrances aren’t the same,” said Yue Xiaoqian .

“What? You can read those runes?” Mo Nian stared at Yue Xiaoqian with absolute shock . He had seen such runes many times, but he had never learned their names .

As they spoke, the boat pierced through the ground . They had already reached the location that Mo Nian had indicated . They were like rats digging into the ground . They used divine sense to probe their surroundings .

“It really isn’t an entrance . Curious . ” Mo Nian felt himself blushing . He was actually mistaken .

“This isn’t the Martial Heaven Continent . The tombs aren’t the same . Perhaps the master of this tomb isn’t even human,” said Yue Xiaoqian to comfort him .

“That’s reasonable . Then let’s test things according to your theory,” said Mo Nian . He continued controlling the boat to dig .

Not long after, some explosions came from the rear of the flying boat, causing the earth to crumble . Long Chen smiled, knowing that Mo Nian was making it more difficult for anyone who followed them . The pressure of this giant tomb greatly limited their divine sense . If they tried to enter the tunnel Mo Nianhad made, they would be forced to slow down . Every little bit could help stall them .

They continued descending for two hours, not even knowing how many miles they had gone . In any case, even Mo Nian’s boat was starting to find it taxing .

However, Mo Nian finally managed to see some familiar runes . He knew that they were approaching a way into the tomb .

Putting away the flying boat, Mo Nian touched the runes . After examining them and searching some more, he actually found a stone gate . He took out a talisman and placed it on the gate .

“What? Is this to ward off evil?” asked Long Chen .

“Tch, what evil? This place is the exit, so for us to enter from here requires going against the flow . Considering how old this tomb could be, who knows what’s inside? Who knows how much baleful qi has accumulated? Those things could harm our Yuan Spirits . I’m testing the concentration of baleful qi inside right now . Oh? There’s actually very little . How curious . Well, be careful . I’m going to open the gate . ”

Mo Nian took out eight talismans and placed them in different locations . They made a strange picture on top of the stone gate .

“Open!” Mo Nian let out a quiet cry . The eight talismans lit up, and the gate’s runes also lit up . Light flowed out like a spiderweb .

The stone gate slowly opened .
