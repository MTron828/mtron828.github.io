Chapter 4809 No Need for a Plan

Everyone else looked grave after talking about what had happened. As Dean Bai Letian felt trapped as well, he called Long Chen over to hear his opinion.

However, Long Chen directly said to leave it to him, leaving everyone stunned.

“Long Chen, this isn’t some small matter. Do you have a plan?” asked Bai Shishi’s mother.

“Nope.”

Hearing this, Bai Shishi’s mother was speechless and almost choked. If Long Chen didn’t have a plan, why did he say to leave it to him?

“There’s no need for any plan for such a thing. A thorough plan also can’t keep up with any unexpected changes. I’m planning on bringing my brothers over,” explained Long Chen.

“That’s too dangerous. We’ve failed once, so the other side is on guard and will be ready to stop us. If you just launch a direct attack, it will be even more difficult than what we just went through,” said Bai Xiaole’s mother.

“Perhaps we should find a new foothold? That will make it harder on the other side,” proposed the Divine Lightning Elder.

Hearing this, Long Chen directly shook his head. “It is useless. The other side is on guard, and they will be ready for us no matter where we go. Also, we don’t know the number or divine abilities of the devil creatures in the other areas, so we will definitely be at a greater disadvantage. As for the devil lord in that spot, having just fought with the vice palace master, it should be resting now, so it should be the best timing for us to attack.”

“But if you can think of it, so can the other side. We won’t be able to offer much support either. The dean must defend our base. If we attack that stronghold, they might retaliate with a sneak attack on us. Then the High Firmament Academy will be in danger,” said Bai Shishi’s mother.

“I don’t need any other assistance. Just my brothers of the Dragonblood Legion will be enough,” replied Long Chen.

“What?”

Everyone was startled. Did Long Chen really want to take over that stronghold with just the Dragonblood Legion?

“The other side will definitely send Heaven Saints to attack you. Can the Dragonblood Legion handle that?” asked the Divine Lightning Elder.

“That’s why it’s a gamble.”

“What is the gamble?” Everyone was baffled.

“I’m betting on them not sending Heaven Saints,” answered Long Chen with a slight smile.

“Why do you even want to take such a gamble? Do you think they won’t send any?” Bai Shishi’s mother was even more baffled, starting to get angry upon seeing his vexatious smile. It was as if he didn’t care about the risk.

“I bet that my father’s warning in front of the gate to the ninth heaven will intimidate them.”

Long Chen was still smiling. Thinking of his father, he was filled with warmth. He practically prostrated himself toward his father’s intelligence.

Back then, Long Chen didn’t know why his father would say those things in such a high-profile manner; it didn’t quite suit his style. However, now Long Chen realized that the warning was likely directed at the Brahma Pill Valley. It seemed to be the only faction worthy of such a warning from his father.

Although Long Zhantian had left, he foresaw that Long Chen would eventually clash with the Brahma Pill Valley, which prompted his warning. Long Chen hadn’t thought of that before, but now it all made sense to him.

“But...”

Long Chen interrupted Bai Shishi’s mother, “Senior, you said that you’d leave this matter to me. Just trust me!”

“Everyone will listen to Dean Long Chen’s arrangements. Do you have any plans for us?” asked Bai Letian.

“Of course. Once we leave...”

...

Long Chen was draped in black robes, with Dragonbone Evilmoon strapped to his back. Bai Shishi stood on his left and Yu Qingxuan on his right. Right now, the entire Dragonblood Legion was gathering in front of him.

The Dragonblood warriors had finished merging with the Heavenly Daos of this world. Although they hadn’t broken the walls of the heavens like Long Chen, they had used their own method to quickly absorb the energy that they needed. This energy was like giving wings to tigers, boosting their morale to soaring heights.

“Move out!” Long Chen waved his hand. The next moment, Xia Chen activated his formation disc, and they all vanished.

Once they left, Bai Letian, the four Protector Elders, and the others appeared, including the injured Bai Zhantang.

They hovered in the air, their appearance rather odd. Even the academy’s disciples were baffled by this unusual display. Why would they exhibit such overt vigilance, especially if their purpose was merely to protect the disciples?

While the disciples were confused, Long Chen and the others appeared in a wasteland. An aura of decay greeted them abruptly as they faced a series of dark, barren hills.

Not even a single blade of grass was growing in this place, only ragged stones and rotting mud. Most of the hills had holes in them, and some corpses lay rotting on the ground.

“This is the fengshui land that my mom found?” questioned Bai Xiaole, staring at the devastation in shock. This was different from the beautiful land he had imagined.

BOOM!

Suddenly, the earth exploded, revealing a monkey-like lifeform with long hands and feet, as well as a set of spines on its back.

It was extremely emaciated. If it weren’t for a lining of fur, it would look like a skeleton. However, it still exuded an astounding Blood Qi and devil qi.

As soon as it appeared, a golden sword cut it in two from head to toe.

Following its death, the mountains collapsed, and one figure after another came flying out of the mud, charging at Long Chen.

“So this one was a sentinel,” said Guo Ran.

“Attack!”

Long Chen waved his hand and charged forward just like that.

“Kill!”

The Dragonblood warriors unsheathed their swords, attacking before those devil creatures even reached them, their sharp swords slicing through their enemies.

These devil creatures weren’t very strong—equivalent to World Kings. As a result, the Dragonblood warriors quickly annihilated them.

They continued forward like blasting through rotting food. However, Long Chen stayed at the rear, casually moving around. Without a strategy or plan, they advanced.

The Dragonblood warriors simply advanced at a steady pace, encountering increasingly powerful devil creatures along the way. Despite the growing resistance, they pressed forward.

Suddenly, a furious roar shook the heavens, causing the world to tremble as the oppressive aura of a Heaven Saint descended upon them.

Following that, an enormous devil creature came charging out of the depths—a devil lord, the most formidable commander of this region.

Long Chen snorted and waved his hand. After that, the void split open, revealing a group of figures. Everyone, except Long Chen, was taken aback by their sudden appearance.

These people were Bai Letian, the four Protector Elders, Bai Zhantang, and his wives.

“Attack! End this battle quickly!”

Just as Long Chen shouted and charged forward, the High Firmament Academy’s temporary base faced a sudden attack.

BOOM! Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

The void was pierced through, and a sharp sword stabbed Bai Letian, who was floating in the air.

BOOM!

The academy’s disciples cried out in shock as Bai Letian was blasted apart.

“As expected, they’re fakes. Kill them all!”

Dozens of masked figures then emerged through the ripped void. The academy’s disciples could not even move in front of them.

“Heaven Saints...”

They were horrified to find that these attackers were all Heaven Saints.

“Ants, time for you to die!”

A winged expert was the first to attack, sending a palm toward those disciples.

“We’ve been waiting for you.”

Just then, Bai Letian’s voice rang out, along with the slicing sound of a sword. When the High Firmament Divine Sword sliced through the air, a head flew into the sky.
