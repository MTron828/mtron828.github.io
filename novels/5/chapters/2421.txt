Chapter 2411 The Netherworld’s Ancient Tomb

Translator: BornToBe

When Long Chen popped out of the Demon Moon Furnace, he jumped in shock upon seeing Mo Nian.

Half of Mo Nian’s body was gone. He was curled up in a dark corner, his aura extremely weak.

Seeing Long Chen come out of the Demon Moon Furnace, Mo Nian was delighted at first, but then upon hearing what he said, he raged, “Do you have the face to say such a thing? I was implicated by you and almost died.”

“I implicated you? When did you change your name to Lazy? Go slander someone else,” said Long Chen. He used his own energy to help heal Mo Nian’s wounds, only to find that there was some strange law trying to devour Mo Nian’s vitality. That was why his recovery was so slow.

However, with Long Chen’s help, they managed to suppress that power. Mo Nian finally began to recover quickly. As he recovered, he said, “Tell me, do you know someone named Hong Yaoyang?”

“Hong Yaoyang? Never heard of him.” Long Chen shook his head but then suddenly said, “Hm, that does sound familiar. I think I’ve heard of him.”

Long Chen suddenly felt that he had heard this name, but no matter how he tried, he was unable to recall it.

“That fellow claimed to be a Nethergod. I had just broken past the final trial and was about to leave this world when that bastard suddenly came out of nowhere, roaring about how anyone related to you had to be killed. The path collapsed, and countless Nether warriors appeared. I was hunted throughout the Netherworld. Fuck, it really pisses me off.” Mo Nian ground his teeth. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

Long Chen suddenly recalled this fellow. He had met him in Ming Cangyue’s palace.

Seeing his expression, Mo Nian snorted, “So, who is slandering who? I was implicated by you, right? What did you do to offend a Nethergod?”

Long Chen shrugged helplessly. “I didn’t really do anything. I just didn’t like looking at him so I slapped him.”

Mo Nian’s jaw dropped. After a long pause, he laughed, “Not bad! Fuck, no wonder I was chased for so long. If I knew this was the reason, I’d have felt much better. When am I going to get a chance to slap him as well?” Mo Nian felt quite satisfied, as if he had been the one to slap Hong Yaoyang.

“Many of my memories of the Netherworld are fading. If you didn’t say that he was a Nethergod, I wouldn’t have remembered him. That idiot took his anger out on you? We’ll definitely repay him for this,” said Long Chen hatefully.

Back then, Hong Yaoyang had come to discuss something with Ming Cangyue, only for her to ignore him. Then upon seeing Long Chen, he had suddenly grown jealous and attacked him, only for Ming Cangyue to freeze him. Long Chen had taken advantage of that to slap him. Actually, he hadn’t even managed to injure him, it was his own hand that hurt.

Hong Yaoyang was infuriated though, and after saying some vicious words, he left. Long Chen had ignored him since they weren’t in the same Netherworld and wouldn’t run into each other again.

He hadn’t expected that fellow to take out his anger on his friends. He, a Nethergod, had actually used some method to find the people related to him.

Mo Nian was truly unlucky to have run into him. Now he was unable to leave this place.

“Hehe, since that’s the case, then I guess I’m not wronged. You slapping him is just like me slapping him.” Mo Nian chortled, slowly standing up. He stretched, his body fully recovered.

Long Chen said, “Since you’ve passed the final trial, your Yuan Spirit has received the Netherworld’s approval. As long as you return to the Martial Heaven Continent, you’ll be a Netherpassage expert. I have the Demon Moon Furnace and Evilmoon on the other side, so I can return at any time. But after being chased down for so long, do you have any thoughts on giving Hong Yaoyang a beating?”

The reason that Long Chen didn’t directly drag Mo Nian back was because he was unwilling. Mo Nian had been beaten into this miserable state. If they didn’t strike back, how were they supposed to accept this? Long Chen first asked Mo Nian what he was thinking. After all, he had been here for so long.

“Hehe, you really are my brother. You really understand me. After being chased for so long, I’ve already prepared everything. Actually, I had a way to get out, but I didn’t want to leave empty-handed. I wanted something big.” An evil smile appeared on Mo Nian’s face.

Long Chen rolled his eyes. “As you waited for your opportunity, the people on the Martial Heaven Continent were worrying themselves sick over you. Liu Zongying has yet to leave your side and was weeping when I saw her. The Mo family’s people are sick with worry.”

When Long Chen explained the current state of the Mo family, Mo Nian was shocked. “What? It only feels like it’s been ten days! Over half a year has passed on the continent?”

“The flow of time here is different. Let’s hurry up so we can get back to the continent. What plan do you have?” asked Long Chen. Time was passing much quicker here. He had to get back soon.

“Alright, since you’ve come, let’s do something big. I’ll bring you to a certain place.” Mo Nian led Long Chen out of the darkness. He touched the walls as he walked, eventually pushing aside a large rock. Long Chen realized that Mo Nian was hiding beneath the rubble of a statue.

“Is this a statue of that bastard Hong Yaoyang?” asked Long Chen. Once they came out of the back of the statue, he saw a towering palace. This was most likely the Nethergod’s palace. Mo Nian had actually chosen to hide here.

“Hehe, this is the darkness under the light. They definitely wouldn’t expect me to hide here,” snickered Mo Nian. “Long Chen, I ran all over the Netherworld dodging them. I’ve figured out many rules of the Netherworld. Do you see that curtain of light up ahead? That is the testing area for the Netherpassage realm. As long as I go there and release my aura, those Nether warriors will quickly appear to kill me. After being chased for so long, I’ve learned how to hide my aura here, which is how I was able to thwart them. If I had wanted to, I could have hidden my aura and disguised myself as someone else to get by them. However, I discovered that there’s an ancient tomb on the opposite side of this palace that has no one guarding it. When I tried to get in, I was injured by some dark light that almost killed me. I’m guessing that there’s definitely treasures in there.”

When he mentioned the ancient tomb, Mo Nian’s old habits of his profession popped up. His eyes were blazing with passion.

Long Chen disdainfully said, “So your injuries were your own fault, and you blamed me for them?”

“Cough, well, if you trace it to the source, it all stemmed from you. Haha, let’s not talk about that. I’ll teach you my amazing aura concealing art.”

Mo Nian taught Long Chen a very specific technique. It was essentially using his own aura to imitate a different fluctuation.

It was very simple, and Long Chen even had doubts that it would work. However, Mo Nian swore that it had worked for him.

Concealing themselves in black cloaks, they carefully crept forward. Within a mountain, Mo Nian pushed aside a boulder, revealing a large cave.

Upon entering, Mo Nian returned the boulder to its original location. Entering deeper into the cave, Long Chen realized that it was freshly excavated.

“You brought all your tomb robbing equipment here?” exclaimed Long Chen.

“How many times do I have to tell you, it’s archaeology! It’s archaeology equipment,” corrected Mo Nian.

Eventually, they arrived at a fork that diverged into three paths. Long Chen rolled his eyes. “A crafty rabbit has three burrows?”

“Hehe, safety first. I naturally left myself ways out,” chortled Mo Nian.

The two of them quickly passed through the caves. When they arrived at a dead end, Mo Nian formed some hand seals, causing a certain mechanism to activate. A stone door actually revealed itself on the wall and opened. After that, an aura of decay came out from within, one that was so corrosive that Long Chen had no choice but to resist it with the power of his Yuan Spirit.

“You dug up tombs all the way to the Netherworld. If this information gets out, it’ll probably shake the world. Not bad,” praised Long Chen.

“It’s curious, when I started graverobbing- archeology I mean, it was because I was forced to in order to restore the power of the Five Element Sun Hunting Bow. But as I did it, I found that many experts left behind their secrets in their tombs. By digging out their historical remains, I’ve learned a great deal of history that no one else knows. You know me, I’m very smart and eager to learn… Don’t look at me like that, I really am studious… Fine, well, I found I’ve gradually come to love archaeology. I have a grand aspiration of using my tools to excavate the entire history of the world for everyone to see,” said Mo Nian. There was a practically holy light in his eyes.

“Fine, if you can find out the lost history of the continent, it truly would be a sacred profession.” Long Chen nodded.

“Hehe, good brother, you have vision. My family is extremely against it. My grandpa curses me every day, but what does he know about the significance of archaeology? Let me tell you-”

“Let’s talk about it later!”

“Alright, we’ll get to work,” said Mo Nian. Now truly wasn’t the time to talk about such things.

Mo Nian brought Long Chen through seven doors. It went without saying that his skill in this area was amazing. Long Chen didn’t even see how he had managed to open those stone doors one after another.

“When the eighth door is opened, the black Nether Qi will gush out. Last time, I was injured at this moment. Do you have any ideas?” asked Mo Nian.
