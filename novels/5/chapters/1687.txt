Chapter 1682 Taking Wickedness To New Heights

Translator: BornToBe

The spear was like a prison, completely locking down its target. It was clearly just an Ancestral item, and yet it was thrumming with power.

It was like a strike from a coiling dragon. Hence, that Empyrean hastily blocked with his divine item.

BOOM!

The spear exploded, and the Empyrean was blown apart. His divine item was sent flying, while his Yuan Spirit emerged from the dust. Suddenly, a hand caught his Yuan Spirit.

Gu Yang’s large figure appeared, his hand covered in divine light. With all the effort of a single breath, that Empyrean’s Yuan Spirit was blown apart, turning into a rain of light.

Gu Yang’s attack was just as shocking as Yue Zifeng’s. Yue Zifeng had been so fast that things had been over before they had even started. However, with Gu Yang, they saw it clearly, which was why they were so shocked. Gu Yang had used an Ancestral item to knock away a divine item and destroy his opponent’s physical body. If he had been in possession of a divine item, wouldn’t he have killed his opponent in one move without any suspense?

In the blink of an eye, two Empyreans were slain. The remaining three Empyreans were finally terrified. Two of them had given up on building a spatial formation and ran.

They could see that a spatial formation could no longer save them. Hence, they split up in two different directions, quick as lightning.

Two walls suddenly appeared in front of them. Those earthen walls possessed an incredibly thick air and sparkled with a golden luster. Those two Empyreans crashed into them and exploded.

“What...?”

Everyone’s jaws dropped. Two Empyreans had died from smashing into a wall? That was something they had trouble believing even though they had personally witnessed it. After all, an Empyrean’s body was so tough that even if a mountain crashed into them, they would just fly straight through it.

However, these earthen walls didn’t shake at all. It was like two eggs had been thrown into a stone wall. The toughness of these earthen walls was practically a match for divine items.

Two Yuan Spirits flew out of the mess of blood. However, they had just appeared when two golden thorns came out of the wall and stabbed their heads.

“No!” Those two Empyreans let out unwilling cries, but that couldn’t change their miserable fates. Their Yuan Spirits quickly withered until they turned to dust.

Li Qi and Song Mingyuan had finished refining the earth essence now. They had not only obtained its pure earth energy, but they had also obtained the Jade Lake Venerate’s earth inheritance. They were no longer their old selves, and their power could only be described as terrifying.

Just as Li Qi and Song Mingyuan killed their targets, a spatial channel appeared. The remaining Empyrean stepped into it.

Long Chen just looked on without stopping him. Just as the latter stepped through, a ray of light flew over. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

“Hey, don’t be in such a rush to leave. This is a small present for your sect. I’ll trouble you to give it to your sect leader. It’s just a small token of my respect for you!” called out Guo Ran.

It was a fist-sized ball and vanished along with the Empyrean.

The Empyrean came out of the spatial channel and saw that he had returned to his sect. Thinking he had escaped death, he rejoiced.

“What is this?”

That Empyrean had just sighed with relief when he suddenly saw that a ball had appeared beside him. That ball’s runes were rapidly changing color.

BOOM!

The ball exploded like a blazing sun. Its immense power devoured the entire sect, destroying it.

...

“Brat, you are really evil.” Long Chen gave Guo Ran a thumbs-up.

He had known that Guo Ran wouldn’t give up such a chance to show off. He would definitely take one of the five targets.

However, Long Chen hadn’t expected that this little fellow would have learned how to be low-key in order to show off even more effectively. Guo Ran had waited silently to con that Empyrean. He had timed everything perfectly.

That ball’s power was definitely terrifying. It wouldn’t just kill that Empyrean; it would probably bring down his sect with him. That move was definitely vicious, so Long Chen gave Guo Ran a thumbs-up.

“Boss, I was just learning from you. I still have much to learn. I will strive to reach the same height as you one day,” said Guo Ran devoutly.

Meng Qi, Chu Yao, and the others were speechless. As expected, a subordinate learned from their leader. These two fellows were both evil. In the future, they would take wickedness to new heights.

In less than an incense stick’s worth of time, the battlefield was empty. The opponents were all slain. However, the Xuantian Dao Sect’s experts were still filled with shock.

Even Hua Shiyu, Zhao Ziyan, Wang Zhen, and the others were stunned. Without even realizing it, the Dragonblood Legion’s power had erupted to a shocking level once more.

Even Empyreans with divine items protecting themselves weren’t able to flee in front of them.

Most shocking of all, only Gu Yang had used his manifestation. The others hadn’t even used their full power.

Moreover, Li Qi, Song Mingyuan, and Guo Ran hadn’t used any martial weapons, while Gu Yang and Yue Zifeng didn’t have divine items. Yue Zifeng might have been too fast for them to see his sword, but those fluctuations weren’t of a divine item. His sword didn’t even have the fluctuations of an Ancestral item.

They killed five Empyreans with casual waves of their hands. How could the others not be shocked? How could they not revere such power?

“I’m still lacking compared to Zifeng. I had to sacrifice my weapon,” said Gu Yang despondently.

“You’re a power-type fighter. Having a good heavy weapon would increase your combat power by at least thirty percent. However, Guo Ran still can’t forge divine items, so it’ll be up to luck. I’ll try to get you one decent weapon later,” consoled Long Chen.

Long Chen was also a power-type fighter, and he personally knew how irritating it was not to have a good weapon. Despite having immense power, you would be unable to use it to fight. That was too stifling.

“Alright, since the fight’s done, we’re done for the day. Next time, if there’s anyone annoying, there’s no need to be courteous. Just kill them.” Long Chen clapped his hands, about to leave.

“Long Chen, have we fallen into their trap by doing this?” asked Chu Yao worriedly.

“The old man often teaches that in front of absolute power, all schemes are useless. Plus, this isn’t a trap to us. I’ve already dealt with it, so don’t worry,” said Long Chen. He turned to the Xuantian Dao Sect’s disciples.

“Brothers, sisters, you’ve now seen that our Xuantian Dao Sect is surrounded by enemies. You’ve also seen their expressions toward us. No one wishes for our Xuantian Dao Sect to soar. So if we want to reach the peak of the Martial Heaven Continent, we’ll have to face countless obstacles. There will be different kinds of obstacles. Some will be clear and aboveboard, while some will be hidden pitfalls. There will also be some that, knowing they can’t stop you, will still wipe their snot on you just to irritate you.

“This is the path of cultivation, one of no return, one where there is no right or wrong, a completely heartless path. If we want to rise, we have to climb over the corpses of our enemies. If your heart holds mercy, it will only result in you being the one whose corpse is climbed over. That is why I never care about my opponent’s point of view or other people’s slander, because anyone who has stepped onto the cultivation path is no longer completely innocent or pure. What I do care about are my brothers, my sisters, my parents, my family. For them, I cannot pause in front of obstacles, nor can I retreat.

“The current Xuantian Dao Sect looks grand and majestic, but I will tell you that this is just a start. As long as we don’t fall, the Xuantian Dao Sect will definitely become one of the overlords of the Martial Heaven Continent. Sometimes fate is just like this. Only when you are willing to share honor and disgrace are you true life and death brothers, just like my Dragonblood Legion. The reason you cannot join the Dragonblood Legion isn’t because you aren’t outstanding or righteous enough. It’s the opposite. I see many among you who are worthy of being my life and death brothers. However, that time has already passed. The Dragonblood Legion is no longer accepting new members. That is because our memories of walking from the Eastern Wasteland to the Central Plains will forever be engraved in our minds. Those years cannot be relived, and those emotions cannot be replaced. The current Xuantian Dao Sect is similar.

“This is a special time, where danger and opportunity exist together. If you wish to stay in the Xuantian Dao Sect, you might prosper with it and leave your names in history. You also might be destroyed along with the Xuantian Dao Sect and become an unremarkable ripple in the river of time. This is a gamble where you bet your life.

“I ask you, do you have the bravery to follow my Xuantian Dao Sect? Do you dare to make a grand gamble with me against our powerful enemies that surround us on the Martial Heaven Continent?”

“We dare!”

All the experts felt their blood boiling with a grand, heroic feeling. Their excitement from killing the enemy invaders had yet to fade before Long Chen’s words further stimulated them.

Life itself was a series of gambles. You won some, you lost some. Each choice was a gamble, and before you reached the end, no one could say whether you won or lost. However, they all trusted Long Chen because Long Chen was a legend, a miracle. They firmly believed that whether he won or lost, this gamble would be exceptionally brilliant.

“Good. Then everyone, prepare yourself. The Devil Abyss’s eruption is nearing, and we will first use that battle to signify the rise of our Xuantian Dao Sect! Let us fight shoulder to shoulder, slaughtering our enemies!”

All the Xuantian Dao Sect’s disciples cheered. They finally had a chance to fight alongside Long Chen. To them, this was a glory that they had been waiting for.

“He really knows how to raise morale!”

In the Xuantain Tower, Li Tianxuan couldn’t help sighing emotionally.
