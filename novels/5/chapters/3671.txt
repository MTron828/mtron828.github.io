Chapter 3660

“I swept through the four seas and crossed a thousand mountains, causing huge billows in heaven and earth. Who can resist my Supreme divine might? If you need a peerless hero, you can find Guo Ran! Xia Chen, how does that sound? Does it match my current status and style?”

A flying boat calmly flew through the air. On it, Guo Ran proudly chanted his new composition.

“You should give up this chant of yours. The beginning still hasn’t changed since the Martial Heaven Continent era. You know that there’s no such thing as the four seas and thousand mountains in the immortal world, right? If you don’t have the talent, don’t pretend like you do. Why are you always trying to learn from that fellow Mo Nian?” Xia Chen was a bit speechless.

This composition of Guo Ran’s was made with his utmost effort. After so many years, the last half had gone through countless changes, making it seem like he was some poet. But it only embarrassed Long Chen and the others to hear it over and over again.

“No, without enough power, there won’t be a good showing-off. Thus, without the opening line, it would feel like I didn’t exist by boss’s side. I can’t accept people only remembering boss’s name and not even knowing who I am! That would be far too hurtful. If the verse is trash, it doesn’t matter. Hehe, it’s fine as long as it draws attention!” said Guo Ran without minding it.

“If you only want to find a sense of existence, then this verse is fine. After all, you might be the only one of the few people in the world capable of making up such a bad verse. Most importantly, when it comes to someone who dares to so shamelessly shout it, you are probably all alone. In this regard, I believe you’ll get many people to remember you. After all, only an extraordinary person can reach such a realm of shamelessness,” said Xia Chen.

“Hehe, when it comes to shamelessness, I still admire Mo Nian. He’s truly shameless. I have to learn more from him in this regard,” said Guo Ran with a shameless laugh.

Xia Chen was truly speechless now. No wonder this fellow was so shameless; he was competing with Mo Nian. No one else could compare to the two of them.

“Slow down a bit. We have to turn a bit up ahead to get rent from this city,” said Guo Ran.

BOOM!

The flying boat stopped in the air, and Xia Chen and Guo Ran flew into the city. After that, Xia Chen threw out a talisman that instantly pierced the Soaring Dragon Company’s grand formation.

Guo Ran destroyed the Soaring Dragon Company’s building with a single punch and directly plundered the treasury. They then turned and left. Everything occurred in just a few blinks of an eye.

“Nice job!”

Guo Ran immediately flew back to the flying boat with Xia Chen. After that, the flying boat made an arrogant arc in the sky before leaving under a torrent of curses from the Soaring Dragon Company’s experts.

Their movements were so proficient to the point of making people speechless. Most experts in the city didn’t even know what was happening even after the flying boat left. At this moment, the flustered and exasperated Soaring Dragon Company’s experts and a group of people were staring at them blankly.

“As usual, we’ll take what we each need and leave the useless stuff to boss.” Xia Chen and Guo Ran got to work in the flying boat.

They had plundered over seventy of the Soaring Dragon Company’s treasuries. Since Xia Chen hadn’t brought anything from the Spirit Rune Pavilion, he needed to start over. Hence, the Soaring Dragon Company became his main sponsor.

Both of their pockets were already overflowing after plundering seventy of their treasuries. Despite that, Xia Chen was still missing quite a few precious materials.

Anyway, Long Chen had said to plunder the Soaring Dragon Company as much as they wanted, and the missing materials would be made up for by the Huayun Trading Company.

Xia Chen and Guo Ran were super efficient. Those grand formations of the Soaring Dragon Company might as well not be there in front of Xia Chen. He broke them effortlessly.

Furthermore, with his formation discs, Xia Chen could accurately find the locations of their treasuries. Then Guo Ran would use his Supreme Bone to break all other obstacles in their way and snatch it. After that, the two would immediately leave. Their cooperation was flawless. On their best day, they managed to plunder twenty of their treasuries.

Because of this activity, Xia Chen walked out of Gongsun Ziyi’s shadow quickly. Together with Guo Ran, they were like money grubbers, busying themselves with plundering and splitting their ill-gotten loot all day. There was so much loot to go through that they were too busy for anything else.

As for Long Chen, he spent all day refining and consuming pills. He could already feel that the Nethergate Star was on the verge of turning violet. Once it did, it would be time to condense the seventh star, the Violet Tower Star.

Half a month later, the flying boat stopped in a deep mountain range, and Long Chen suddenly let out a howl. As violet qi burst out of his entire body, the wild power blasted apart the surrounding mountains. Qi waves scoured the land.

Long Chen’s sixth star finally turned fully violet. After that, a violet whirlpool appeared beneath Long Chen’s Dantian. When it manifested, violet qi from all six stars surged toward the current in a never-ending cycle.

That whirlpool looked like a gaping maw that would never be satisfied. It devoured the violet qi from all six stars. Not only that, but the violet clouds surrounding the 108,000 stars were also devoured.

Long Chen jumped in shock. He had not expected the formation of the seventh star to require such a huge amount of energy. The violet qi of the six stars and the violet clouds of the 108,000 stars were all absorbed, and it still wasn’t done. There were signs of the FengFu, Alioth, Life Fate, Enlightenment Palace, Divine Gate, and Nethergate Stars contracting, almost withering.

The 108,000 stars also started showing signs of growing listless. Long Chen was horrified by that. How could the seventh star be so greedy that it was trying to devour the energy of all the stars?

Just as Long Chen was worried that the seventh star would destroy all of his stars, it finally stopped devouring their energy. After that, the violet whirlpool actually began to spin in the opposite direction.

The FengFu, Alioth, Life Fate, Enlightenment Palace, Divine Gate, and Nethergate Stars received their energy back from the whirlpool. At the same time, the 108,000 stars thrummed with life once more, and the violet clouds appeared above them. Everything returned to normal. However, the starry sea seemed to have come alive now and was moving according to a certain rhythm.

As for the whirlpool beneath Long Chen’s Dantian, it slowly dissipated. Now, there was a violet gas cloud the size of a grain of rice at its core. Despite being small, it seemed to contain immense power.

This small gas cloud contained a huge amount of violet qi, and Long Chen felt it thrumming through his body as well.

Even without him intentionally circulating it, the violet qi filled his body, flowing through every vein and nourishing every inch of his body.

Previously, if he wanted to use his violet qi, he had to use his starry sea. But now, wherever he willed it, the violet qi would appear.

The amount of violet qi in his body had shrunk, but there was a huge difference in quality. If his previous violet qi was like a thick strand of hemp that could carry a thousand tons, then his current violet qi was like a strand of silk that could carry tens of thousands of tons.

“Violet Tower Star, you’ve finally appeared. Hehe, now I have confidence in going to the Nine Underworld Island.” Long Chen clenched his fist. Sensing the powerful violet qi in his body, he smiled. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

“Move out! Target, Nine Underworld Island!”
