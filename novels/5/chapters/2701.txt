Chapter 2690 Divine Items Collide

With her sword in hand, Feng Fei blocked Jiang Wuchen and Ye Liangchen’s path. This action of her startled everyone.

Feng Fei angrily shouted, “Long Aotian is a disgrace to the divine families. His entire family is trash that has tarnished the honor of the divine families, so I will not permit you to help Long Aotian. We should not participate in their battle.”

“What bullshit! What kind of time is it for this kind of nonsense?! In the martial path, when is reason ever taken into account? Get out of my way! Your conduct is already a betrayal of the divine families. Have you considered the consequences?” raged Ye Liangchen.

Feng Fei frostily said, “Long Chen and I are destined to be enemies. But even as enemies, it is an aboveboard confrontation. If on the martial path I am unable to beat him, I will be killed by him without regrets. However, such despicable means are an insult to the divine families. I can die, but I will not bend my spine. If you go over, it will be joining forces with the invaders. Even if you kill Long Chen, it will only be a disgrace to the divine families. I will not allow such blasphemy to the divine families. Don’t force me, or we can fight to the death right now.”

People stared in shock at Feng Fei as her voice resounded through the air. No one had expected that as a fellow member of the divine families, she would have much greater integrity than Ye Liangchen, Jiang Wuchen, and Long Aotian. She truly was a strong woman.

“Courting death!” Ye Liangchen furiously prepared to attack.

However, he was stopped by Jiang Wuchen. Ye Liangchen raged, “And what are you doing?!”

Jiang Wuchen’s expression changed several times. In the end, he helplessly said, “She is my little sister. I don’t care if she’s right or wrong. I won’t let you kill her.”

“You…!” Ye Liangchen was infuriated. Jiang Wuchen was saying that he wouldn’t stand beside Feng Fei, but he wouldn’t allow him to kill her either.

Just as Ye Liangchen was wondering whether or not it was worth it to have a falling out with both of them, Zi Yan flew over to Long Chen with the Southern Sea Zither.

In front of everyone’s shocked gazes, Zi Yan actually smashed the Southern Sea Zither directly onto the Central Plains Cauldron.

BANG!

The two supreme divine items collided, but curiously, the heaven-shaking explosion everyone anticipated didn’t occur. It was just an ordinary collision. The Southern Sea Zither and the Central Plains Cauldron retreated at the same time.

“Central Plains Cauldron, if you don’t awaken now, when will you?” Zi Yan suddenly shouted, but her voice was different. It contained a mighty and majestic tone.

Buzz.

The Central Plains Cauldron’s runes suddenly lit up and a sacred aura rose. The Central Plains Cauldron seemed to come to life.

In that instant, Long Qifeng’s expression changed. That was because he suddenly realized that the Central Plains Cauldron was no longer under his control.

The Central Plains Cauldron’s divine light slowly grew, and one rune after another lit up. Following that, chains began to appear on it one by one.

“The Central Plains Cauldron is being controlled unwillingly?!”

Upon seeing those chains, furious gazes shot toward Long Qifeng. Those chains were most likely something that they had added in order to forcibly control it. The divine families had actually used despicable means.

“Divine families, you really are shameless! You even dare to scheme against the Martial Heaven Continent’s five supreme divine items!”

Furious roars rang out. The five supreme divine items were the Martial Heaven Continent’s natural divine items that maintained the continent’s karmic luck. They were called the continent’s protective gods. But the divine families had been forcibly controlling one of them against its will.

The divine families had become hated due to the way Long Aotian’s parents had raised Long Aotian, by stealing other people’s Spirit Bloods, Spirit Roots, and Spirit Bones. But now, that fury reached an unprecedented level.

There was no longer any way for the divine families to explain themselves. Long Qifeng’s expression was extremely ugly. After that, he rapidly made hand seals, trying to control the Central Plains Cauldron.

However, after being struck by the Southern Sea Zither, the Central Plains Cauldron seemed to have awoken from a deep slumber. It was no longer willing to be controlled.

The Central Plains Cauldron was in a strange state and was slowly awakening. No longer sensing any threat from it, he suddenly stamped on the air, shooting toward the Blood Fiend Devil Lord.

The Blood Fiend Devil Lord and the Alldevil Heavenwalker were fighting Yun Tian when the Blood Fiend Devil Lord’s heart shuddered. He looked back to see Long Chen charging over, and his expression completely changed. His blood sun staved off Yun Tian as he retrieved his bone tower to block Long Chen.

BOOM!

Evilmoon slashed onto the huge tower, and the Blood Fiend Devil Lord coughed up a mouthful of blood. He was powerless to resist in front of Long Chen’s explosive power.

The tower was sent flying, and Evilmoon slashed through the Blood Fiend Devil Lord’s waist, cutting him in two.

“Die!”

Long Chen didn’t give him any chance and unleashed another slash, this time at his head.

Suddenly, the tower shuddered and another heavenly gate opened in the sky. The Blood Fiend Devil Lord was sucked into the giant tower and directly fled through that heavenly gate.

“It’s another expert from a different world!”

This was the same as how the Nine-Headed Lion had fled. Some supreme expert from his world had opened a gate between worlds to save him. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

Following this, the Alldevil Heavenwalker blazed with divine light and was sucked into a world gate. Then a giant white bone claw tore through the void and grabbed Ye Ming, dragging him away.

In the blink of an eye, all the experts from other worlds that Long Chen was fighting had been saved, other than Long Aotian and the dragon woman.

“Bastards, if the damn divine families hadn’t used the Central Plains Cauldron, none of those people would have had a chance to escape!” raged the experts of the Martial Heaven Continent.

If it weren’t for the Central Plains Cauldron shattering the barrier of the heavenly tribulation, there was no way that those experts would have dared to interfere in the heavenly tribulation.

The Nine-Headed Lion was an exception. At that time, the barrier had yet to fully form, allowing him to be a fish that slipped through the net. However, now the big fish had also managed to get away. The continent’s experts had missed their best chance to slay the peak geniuses of the invading worlds, so the people’s hatred toward Long Aotian’s family rose to another level.

Upon seeing those powerful experts be saved, Long Chen’s fury soared. Now all his efforts were meaningless.

“Long Aotian!”

Seeing the bewildered Long Aotian, Long Chen smiled sinisterly. He looked like a leopard staring at an alarmed rabbit

Long Aotian immediately fled, trying to escape the tribulation.

BOOM!

However, he ran directly into a heavenly barrier. The heavenly tribulation’s barrier had recovered at some point, forcing him to remain inside.

An icy blade stabbed through Long Aotian’s back and out his chest. With a shake of Long Chen’s arm, Long Aotian’s body exploded.
