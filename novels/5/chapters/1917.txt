Chapter 1907 Endless Sea of Lightning

“That’s...”

When that group appeared, the people in the neutral camp were stunned. As soon as they arrived, the Daos of the world were suppressed. They were a group of peerless experts.

“Are they Netherpassage experts...?” asked someone with a shuddering voice.

That was because the aura of this group was absolutely terrifying. It was like they were the rulers of this world.

“No, they aren’t at the Netherpassage realm. They’re only Life Star experts. However, they’re all powerful Empyreans, so the pressure of their auras is on the same level as ordinary Netherpassage experts,” said Hu Feng.

“Impossible! Isn’t it impossible for Life Star experts to enter the Yin Yang World? Have the rules of the Yin Yang World changed?”

“The Yin Yang World’s rules haven’t changed. However, rules are dead, while humans are alive...” said Hu Feng.

“You mean to say... those experts broke through in the Yin Yang World?”

That was crazy. A group of over three thousand Empyreans had actually broken through to the Life Star realm in the Yin Yang World and sacrificed all their future prospects just to kill Long Chen. That price was terrifying.

“They are really ruthless. This also proves that they want to make sure the Dragonblood Legion and the Martial Heaven Alliance’s disciples can’t escape. Based on their auras, these people have just broken through to the Life Star realm. They had to have undergone their tribulations just as the two armies met,” said Hu Feng sharply. These people were definitely insane and very frightening. He waved his hand. “Get further away from the battlefield, the farther the better.”

Although their group was neutral, they were now witnessing a group of madmen. No one could guarantee that they wouldn’t do something even more insane.

“Kill!”

Those three thousand Empyreans that had just broken through to the Life Star realm charged toward the Dragonblood Legion.

“I’ll handle you.” Guo Ran was the first to face them. He hacked his golden saber, and as a result, he was sent flying by a Life Star Empyrean’s sword. He almost coughed up blood.

Guo Ran was alarmed. These people were actually shockingly powerful. “Bastards, how can they be so strong?!”

“They’ve already broken through to the Life Star realm, and they are Empyreans whose manifestations have reached an initial level of awakening. As they now possess a Life Star expert’s world energy, we’ll definitely be at a disadvantage in a direct clash,” said Meng Qi.

“Then what do we do?” Guo Ran actually had no ideas. Over three thousand Life Star Empyreans with manifestations that had started to awaken? What could they possibly do against them?

“We should break through to the Life Star realm and go all-out against them!” shouted one of the Dragonblood warriors.

“Don’t say that. Then we’ll never be able to progress to Netherpassage,” shouted Guo Ran.

“Everyone, retreat and summon the Dragon Blood Heavenly Barrier!” shouted Long Chen suddenly.

Following his shout, Meng Qi, Chu Yao, Tang Wan-er, Cloud, Liu Ruyan, Xia Chen, Guo Ran, Gu Yang, Yue Zifeng, Li Qi, Song Mingyuan, Yue Xiaoqian, Ye Zhiqiu, and the other experts stopped fighting their opponents and retreated.

The Dragonblood warriors formed a strange formation, and they made sure to protect all the Martial Heaven Alliance’s disciples within. Pillars of Blood Qi soared out of each of their bodies.

Xia Chen floated in the air, the giant formation disc spinning above him. Suddenly, the formation disc exploded. Its particles enveloped them all.

“Dragon Blood Heavenly Barrier!” Xia Chen let out a cry. A giant barrier appeared around everyone.

The power of the Dragonblood warriors was linked with dragon blood. It was that energy that condensed into this giant barrier.

“Hmph, we abandoned our futures just to kill you. Do you think resisting will have any use?”

Those Life Star experts had sinister expressions. Which of them had been willing to abandon their futures? However, they had had no choice. If they didn’t obey, they would be killed.

They were geniuses raised by various large sects. They were extremely talented and originally had limitless prospects. However, they didn’t have any powerful backgrounds themselves, so they were forced into this plan.

These orders were something they had no choice but to obey. So they themselves were filled with hatred and resentment. Now they were releasing all that anger on the Dragonblood Legion.

Berserk attacks struck the barrier. That power was immense.

In unison, every Dragonblood warrior coughed up a mouthful of blood. In the very first clash, they were injured.

“They’re too powerful! We can’t last for long!” Xia Chen’s expression changed.

“We’ll help.”

Meng Qi, Tang Wan-er, Yue Xiaoqian, Yue Zifeng, and the others began to transmit their own spiritual yuan into the Dragonblood warriors to strengthen the defenses.

“There’s us as well. What do we do?” Ye Lingshan and the others shouted.

Willow branches sprouted from the ground. Liu Ruyan said, “Transmit your spiritual yuan to me, and I will transmit it to the Dragonblood warriors.”

Hearing that, the disciples of the Martial Heaven Alliance poured in their spiritual yuan. The barrier rumbled. With everyone working together, the barrier managed to endure.

“This should be your final trump card, correct? Then we can go all-out.” Long Chen suddenly shouted, and his upper robes exploded, revealing his upper body.

The green scales covering his body suddenly darkened, becoming black. As blood spurted out from between them, a pillar of light soared into the sky, infecting the sky with darkness. An evil aura caused the sky to shudder.

Long Chen’s aura was crazily rising, growing stronger and stronger. Huo Lieyun, Xie Luo, and True Immortal Jiaoqi were actually blown back by just that terrifying aura. They stared in shock at Long Chen.

The current Long Chen looked evil, bloodthirsty, domineering, and emotionless, like a fiend from hell that was slowly recovering its power.

“What’s going on?!” roared True Immortal Jiaoqi. This power actually made him feel fear.

“It’s that weapon of his! He’s powering it to strengthen himself,” said Huo Lieyun. He noticed black qi flowing out of Evilmoon and into Long Chen. Long Chen’s scales were turned black by them.

It was like an evil dragon was about to burst out of Long Chen’s body. His physical body was tearing, and blood continued to pour out of him.

“Are you able to endure?” asked Evilmoon.

Long Chen’s physical body was too weak to endure its full power. Evilmoon could only transmit a portion of its energy into Long Chen, forcing his body to the limit. That was the only way they could go all-out.

However, this kind of power naturally came with an immense backlash. One mistake and his meridians would be broken. However, this was Long Chen’s only remaining move.

“I’ll endure it.” Long Chen clenched his teeth. His physical body was constantly tearing and healing. He was in indescribable pain, but he had to endure.

BOOM!

Suddenly, the world shook. Long Chen’s scales were fully black now. His aura was finally no longer spreading.

“Alright, this level of power should be enough to use all the available power I have. Go, Long Chen! Make this world tremble because of us. Slaughter and roar as much as you please!” Evilmoon let out a roar filled with killing intent. Its soul formed a resonance with Long Chen’s soul.

Long Chen suddenly let out a heaven-shaking roar. Mountains collapsed, and all the experts felt a chill. This roar was the overture of a slaughter.

Long Chen’s voice had become deep as if he was a different person. It was merciless and domineering, as well as filled with a determination to charge forward regardless of what lay before him.

Long Chen took a step forward, and True Immortal Jiaoqi went to block him. Divine light erupted from his qilin halberd.

“Scram!”

BOOM!

Long Chen let out a simple slash of Evilmoon. Black light flowed out of it, and True Immortal Jiaoqi’s arms were instantly broken. His halberd smashed into his own chest, and he was sent flying back, hacking up blood.

Long Chen’s power had risen to a monstrous level. Evilmoon was finally able to use some of its power, and in this state, True Immortal Jiaoqi was actually unable to receive a single attack.

A black saber-image sliced through the air, attacking the Life Star Empyreans.

Those Life Star Empyreans had no choice but to stop attacking the Dragonblood Legion and focus on blocking Long Chen’s attack.

BOOM!

Those Life Star Empyreans were blown back by Long Chen’s saber.

“Die!”

Long Chen suddenly charged toward them, unleashing a tempest of attacks with Evilmoon. One Life Star Empyrean after another was blown to bits. Even divine items were blown apart.

“Heavens, Long Chen is absolutely heaven-defying! He can even fight across realms against Life Star Empyreans with partly awoken manifestations!” The neutral camp’s experts’ jaws dropped. No one had expected Long Chen to possess such a terrifying trump card.

In the blink of an eye, Long Chen had killed eighteen of those Empyreans. It had to be known that each of them was a terrifying existence. When it came to combat power, they were only the slightest hair weaker than Huo Lieyun, Xie Luo, and True Immortal Jiaoqi.

However, they weren’t a match for Long Chen in his current state. But then again, eighteen of them dead meant nothing to this army of three thousand.

Those experts quickly recovered from their shock. However, they had just gathered when a lightning dragon appeared behind Long Chen. It rapidly spun, forming a giant lightning channel. A world of lightning could be seen within that channel.

“Brothers, come slaughter them all!” Long Chen suddenly roared. Following his cry, countless lightning drakes came flying out of the lightning portal.FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m
