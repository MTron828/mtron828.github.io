Chapter 3144 Unleashed Power

Astral winds raged. It was as if millions of invisible wind blades were slicing through the air. As a result, Ku Wuya’s giant attack rumbled and actually crumbled just like that.

“What?!”

“Just his aura is enough to repel Ku Wuya’s attack?!”

“What kind of power is that?!”

Everyone stared in shock at Long Chen. He was covered in white dragon scales, and flames burned on top of them. It was possible to see a white azure dragon roaming around Long Chen’s body within those flames. When the dragon roar resounded through the air, his terrifying might shook the formation.

“These people are all monsters. Under that kind of pressure, I wouldn’t even be able to attack before being crushed,” said a Primal. Despite being in the Divine Flame realm, how was the difference between them so immense?

“Heavens, Long Chen’s aura is still rising?! He has even greater power?!” Startled cries rang out. As the astral winds continued, Long Chen’s aura fluctuated intensely. It was as if some greater power was about to burst out.

“How can this be?!” People stared in shock at Long Chen. His power was clearly scattering, not condensing. He hadn’t even started to pull it back in, so it hadn’t reached the limit. This wasn’t his peak condition yet.

Ku Wuya’s disdain had long since vanished. Now, he felt his hair standing on end, and an intense feeling of death started to fill him.

“Starry River of the Sky Art!”

Long Chen suddenly shouted thunderously, while inside he shouted: Six Star Battle Armor!

As a result, the land beneath Long Chen’s feet exploded, transforming into nothingness. It was like a volcano accumulating power for millions of years was erupting. A pillar of light then tore into the sky, piercing through the martial stage’s barrier. Also, the black clouds were blown apart, allowing them to see the stars in the cosmos.

“The barrier… it’s broken…”

The martial stage’s barrier couldn’t be broken. This was simply common knowledge. Even Divine Lords couldn’t break it, but it was pierced by Long Chen’s aura. They instantly became dumbfounded, not daring to believe their eyes.

Countless cracks covered the barrier until it shattered. After that, startled cries rang out as a terrifying qi wave blasted over.

Just at this moment, a new barrier appeared, but part of the qi wave leaked through. A ripple could be seen moving toward the spectators. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

Fortunately, another barrier appeared in front of the spectator stands. But this barrier was then blasted apart just as it appeared.

People who had expected this barrier to block the attack suddenly cried out in terror. The ripple blew apart the inner spectator stand, leaving countless people covered in blood and looking wretched. The outer spectator stand’s people who had originally envied them for having a closer vantage point immediately stopped feeling that way. It seemed that the outer spectator stand was safer.

Bai Shishi’s golden shield slowly retracted, restoring everyone’s field of vision. When they saw Long Chen unleashing wild astral winds that tore at the heavens, Luo Bing and the others almost jumped in excitement.

They had never expected Long Chen to be concealing such terrifying power. Thinking of their previous worry for him, they found it laughable.

In the outer spectator stand, the disciples of the High Firmament Academy shouted so loudly that their throats broke, yet that didn’t stop them.

Even the martial stage was unable to bear his power. Due to the pillar of light soaring out of his body, the barrier was unable to fully reform before it was destroyed again. Another barrier quickly appeared, but still, another qi wave escaped.

“Again?!”

Startled cries rang out as everyone defended, but they were once more blasted back by the qi wave. Quite a few ran off, while a few stronger ones were able to remain. But their bodies were covered in tiny wounds.

The experts, who had been blasted away by the first qi wave and had chosen to run back, now ran even further away, with quite a few injured again. They decided to simply stay in the outer spectator stand.

More barriers continued to rise and be destroyed, unleashing wave after wave. As the inner spectator stand’s barrier was unable to block those terrifying qi waves, it was left riddled with holes, with only a few Primals able to ignore the astral winds. Even those Primals were injured, but experts had their own dignity. Even if they were injured, they chose not to go to the outer spectator stand.

“If you can’t even endure this leaking aura, how can you be called an expert? Unless the spectator stand is completely destroyed, I won’t be leaving.” One of the Primals directly made a stubborn declaration.

Within the martial stage, Long Chen’s aura was continuing to rise. His divine ring spun, and a dragon roar continued to resound through the air. One man and one saber appeared incredibly arrogant, as if viewing everyone else as beneath them.

Ku Wuya stared in shock as he stood in the air. He had never expected such a thing. Standing in the air with those astral winds raging was like being a tiny boat on a raging sea.

However, even as these wild astral winds raged through the martial stage, Gui Yun’s fat figure never appeared. It was impossible to find a trace of his existence.

“He wouldn’t have run away with the destruction of the barrier, right?” asked Bai Xiaole. But when he thought about it, that didn’t seem likely.

However, the other possibility was that he was still hidden within the martial stage. But if that was true, and he was able to remain hidden even within this raging space, his concealing arts were truly terrifying.

The barrier was broken eight times before Long Chen’s aura finally started to condense. As the barrier had stopped breaking, the spectators sighed with relief.

When the astral winds faded, the martial stage returned to calm, and the ground slowly settled. The barrier covered the stage once more.

Everything had returned to calm. But this calm world was even more terrifying. Everyone instantly grew so tense that they could only hear their own heartbeats thudding in their ears.

“Long Chen… he’s injured?” Bai Shishi looked at Long Chen and suddenly saw blood leaking from the edges of his dragon scales.

As for Long Chen himself, he didn’t even seem to notice that blood. He looked at Ku Wuya. “If you don’t use your full power, you won’t have the slightest chance later on.”

After saying that, Long Chen began to walk over to him. Every step he took caused the void to shake. The sound of his footsteps was like the overture performed by a death god before killing people.
