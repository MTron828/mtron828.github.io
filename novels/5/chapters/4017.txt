Chapter 4006 Splitting the Mind in Two

“Refine my soul now? Are you sure that you’re not joking?” Long Chen almost didn’t dare to believe his ears.

Refining the soul required one’s entire heart and mind to enter the meditative state. But with so many devil experts here, how was he supposed to enter that state? As soon as he did, wouldn’t he be turned into a corpse by these devils?

“Of course, I’m not joking. You will need to split your mind in two, fighting while refining the soul. You see, the dragon race possesses two horns, one Yang and one Yin. We are a body of two souls, capable of handling dual thoughts effortlessly. I know that it’s difficult for your human race, but it must be done. This cultivation technique is my creation, and there is only one path to follow. You must conquer this step,” said the dragon expert.

“But it’s impossible. It’s not like I can walk while looking left and right at the same time, remembering all the different sceneries, and reacting accordingly for each situation. Unless…” Long Chen suddenly had an unbelievable thought.

He had been about to say unless he released his heart-devil. However, as soon as he thought of his sealed heart devil, he knew that it would be impossible.

“Try it!” urged the dragon expert.VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

Feeling helpless, Long Chen could only do as the dragon expert said. He then stepped onto the tenth step once more, knowing that the only thing he could do was continue onward.

However, he had just drawn the energy of his blood, qi, bones, and spirit into his spiritual space when those devils beat him black and blue. He had no choice but to retaliate. As a result, the soul refinement came to an end.

He then once more entered the soul refinement state. Again, the moment his mind sank into his spiritual space, his body lacked any direction and was beaten again.

Long Chen clenched his teeth. Feeling annoyed, he decided to use his body’s instincts to fight while his mind focused on soul refinement. In any case, the Dragon Blood Battle Armor was powerful enough that they would be unable to kill him.

However, this thought was cut off by the dragon expert. “You must learn to split your mind. It is very important to you. I don’t care what method you use, but there are no tricks or cheats that can get you past it!”

It was very firm, leaving Long Chen no room for negotiation. Hence, he helplessly tried again.

But every time his mind entered his spiritual space, it was forced to be called out to fight. There was no way for him to do both at once.

Long Chen tried many times and failed every time. In the end, he had no choice but to retreat in order to heal. While recovering, he pondered how he was supposed to split his mind.

Long Chen even thought about releasing his heart-devil and striking a deal, but he abandoned that thought as it was too dangerous.

The true dragon race had two souls? Then this was something of utter simplicity to them, but Long Chen couldn’t figure out how to do it.

No matter how he thought, he was unable to figure it out. Long Chen cursed furiously. Of course, he didn’t dare to curse the dragon expert, so he simply cursed himself for being dumb.

But all that cursing was useless. He simply couldn’t do it. For now, he could only vent his fury on these devil experts.

To his surprise though, after mindlessly attempting it several times, he felt like he had grasped something.

However, that feeling was still elusive. When he started fighting the devil experts, that feeling grew stronger.

It was as if without realizing it, some mysterious energy appeared to guide his power, making Long Chen feel like his mind had truly been split in two.

This energy was like a key that could unlock the potential in his body. But while the key was now there, he had no idea how to use it.

As Long Chen tried and tried, he stopped thinking about it and just continued to fight the devil expert. He didn’t refine his blood or refine his soul, just mindlessly fighting.

When his heart was no longer impatient, he clearly felt his qi grow calm and his head grow clear. He then entered a strange state.

Right now, Long Chen tried to split his mind in two again, and as he fought, a large amount of golden energy flooded his spiritual space, delighting him.

However, that delight instantly caused the golden energy to come to a stop. When he tried to intentionally enter that state again, he found himself unable to enter it.

Long Chen then calmed his mind, trying to find that feeling again. But no matter how he tried, he was unable to, leaving him so frustrated that he wanted to give up.

After he rested a bit and thought back, a spark of understanding struck him.

“No desires can lead to what you seek?”

Long Chen once more stepped onto the tenth step. This time, he didn’t think about splitting his mind. He just fought the devil experts without worries or joy.

When his mind was calm, he once more tried splitting it in two. As a result, he succeeded this time.

Long Chen kept himself steady. As he fought, he circulated the energy of his blood, qi, bones, and spirit, sending their energy into his spiritual space. It then gradually turned golden.

However, this state only lasted a few breaths’ time before stopping. Even so, Long Chen didn’t panic or get flustered. He simply continued to fight. After a bit, he once more entered that state.

This was an empty-mind state in which he did his best to make himself forget about everything, to make himself indifferent to everything, as if he was just a spectator watching himself.

The feeling faded quickly once again. But this time, it didn’t return, so Long Chen went back to rest.

Based on Long Chen’s estimation, he had to be in his peak condition to enter this state. If he was tired, it would be very difficult to enter it.

After repeatedly resting and fighting again, Long Chen gradually grasped this feeling. He was able to stay in that state longer and longer.

However, for Long Chen, splitting his mind was a special state, and it was not something that he could maintain. In other words, he was able to enter this state now, but he couldn’t control when it faded.

“Remember this feeling. It will be very important to you,” said the dragon expert.

“Senior, what is this power?” Long Chen couldn’t help asking, feeling lost. This was something completely incomprehensible to him.

“Just remember it is all. I will tell you later. It is the crux of the Dragon Soul Body Forging Art, and it will be your foundation for reaching higher realms. This is something that both your human race and my dragon race have. But it is called different things, and our comprehension of it is also different. I would not be able to explain it to you clearly, so you don’t need to ask,” said the dragon expert.

Long Chen nodded. Indeed, the Dao was not something that could be imparted with just words. There truly was no way to explain the Grand Dao, as every person had their own experiences and their own unique comprehensions.

While Long Chen was cultivating within the Vermilion Bird trial by fire, the Vermilion Bird Empire was already in a state of chaos.
