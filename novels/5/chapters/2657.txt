Chapter 2646 The Final Wave

The heavenly tribulation was over. Now, the experts around felt as if their power had instantly grown multiple times. Furthermore, they sensed as if they had become masters of heaven and earth. They could control all energy. It was a marvelous feeling.

The Dragonblood warriors cheered as their tribulation was over. They sensed boundless energy coursing through their bodies, and the feeling of being one with the world made them feel a sense of unprecedented content. This was the Heaven Merging realm.

After merging with the Heavenly Daos, they were like a dragon returning to the sea, like a free bird flying through the sky. This was a feeling of absolute control. They could sense the breathing of the world and feel the flow of the Daos.

Any bottlenecks they had had in terms of comprehending the Dao were suddenly broken through instant enlightenment. They no longer seemed like they even existed. It was as if they were simply one with heaven and earth.

Suddenly, rumbling rang out and shook the entire world. As the earth was shuddering, the laws of the Heavenly Daos were changing.

The earth was glowing. It was as if a mysterious veil had covered the world. At the same time, mist began to flow out of the earth, mixing with the laws of the Heavenly Daos.

“After such intense tribulations, the Martial Heaven Continent has started to awaken, and the energy of the core of the world has been activated. This is the time for the final tribulations. The Martial Heaven Continent’s karmic luck will end up supporting someone here,” said Qu Jianying.

“Ah? If that was the case, why didn’t we wait until now for our tribulations?” Guo Ran’s excitement instantly transformed into disappointment. They wouldn’t have any chance of this karmic luck support.

In the Devil Slaughter Rankings, Long Chen had taken first place and gained some karmic luck support. However, he had given that to Guo Ran, letting him have the sweet taste of heaven-defying luck. Now hearing that this sweet taste was appearing again, Guo Ran immediately became vexed.

“Give it up. Just now, the final wave of the tribulation would have killed us if it wasn’t for the old man. The next batch of tribulations might bring more benefits, but they’d also be the end for us,” said Xia Chen. He wasn’t greedy like Guo Ran. Just being able to muddle through the Dragonblood Legion’s tribulation had benefited him immensely. If he was on his own, he would have had to hurry up and go through one of the earlier batches of tribulations.

Guo Ran’s greed was never satisfied. He actually dared to try and touch the karmic luck of a Sovereign.

After hearing Xia Chen, Guo Ran felt that it was right. That heavenly tribulation just now had really been terrifying. The final wave had almost killed them.

Suddenly, a streak of light flew through the air, and Mo Nian’s voice rang out.

“Long Chen, you haven’t gone through your tribulation either? Perfect. Let’s join forces and go patrol.”

Mo Nian was flying with the Earth Splitting Divine Shuttle. He had his bow on his back and his wretched smile on his face. His cultivation base was also at the peak of Netherpassage.

Despite that, Mo Nian’s aura was incredibly heavy. The divine energy coming from him had completely vanished, and he had already transformed.

“What patrol?” Long Chen stared at him. This fellow always said some incomprehensible words when he first appeared.

“I’m going to go find the Alldevil Heavenwalker, Ye Ming, or the Blood Fiend Devil Lord. I’m going to charge into their tribulations midway. Come, if we work together, we can definitely con one or two of them to death. This is too good of a chance to miss.” Mo Nian laughed sinisterly. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

“Aren’t they going through their tribulations in their own territories?” Long Chen was still confused.

Before Mo Nian replied, Qu Jianying said, “Those who are undergoing tribulations in their own worlds are those that don’t dare to enter the Martial Heaven Continent. But the ones mentioned by Mo Nian are exceptions. That is because they are already supported by the karmic luck of an entire world. They’ve long since obtained their world’s approval, so the final tribulation can be done wherever they please. Didn’t I tell you? People will fight over the final karmic luck of the continent when it appears. You have to be prepared for others to try and steal it. Did you forget?”

Long Chen clapped the back of his head. His head really had been stupid lately. So Mo Nian was planning on sneak attacking them.

“The final wave of heavenly tribulations is starting. Those fellows are definitely hiding, thinking of taking the karmic luck. This is our best chance to attack them,” said Mo Nian.

“But…”

Suddenly, rumbling rang out. The void in the distance was collapsing, and endless lightning was dancing. A berserk will erupted.

“An expert is undergoing tribulation. Quick, let’s go see who it is.” Mo Nian didn’t even wait for Long Chen. He transformed into a streak of light that shot away.

“Old man, I’ll leave this place to you. I’m going to take a look,” said Long Chen.

The old man had advanced to the Heaven Merging realm. Moreover, while wielding the Heaven Splitting Blade and the Heaven Splitting Divine Tablet, he didn’t fear anyone. With him here, Long Chen could be at ease.

After that, Long Chen sped off, while Guo Ran and the others stared at each other. The old man said, “You can go as well. We old-timers will guard this place.”

“But…” Meng Qi wasn’t so confident. If they left, what if Devil Spirit Mountain made a move?

“Go. As everyone is undergoing tribulation, the seniors like the High Priest and Daoist Heavenly Feather have definitely made their preparations. There are also the divine families. The chances of a sudden invasion are very low. So go,” said Qu Jianying.

“Then we’ll thank our seniors.” Guo Ran hastily thanked them and happily left. The rest of the Dragonblood Legion also left with him. In fact, everyone else was also unable to stay sitting and ran over to take a look.

“Lingshan, you can go too. It’s fine.” Qu Jianying smiled at Ye Lingshan. She knew that Ye Lingshan wanted to go.

Only then did Ye Lingshan go as well. At this moment, all the youngsters ran off, leaving a few ten thousand senior experts behind.

“Hu Feng!”

When Long Chen arrived, he saw that the person at the center of the storm of lightning was the Gambling Heavenly Dao’s heir, Hu Feng.

Immersed within the lightning, Hu Feng bitterly smiled at Long Chen. “Although it was within expectations, I’m still very disappointed. The Heavenly Daos haven’t shown any signs of supporting me. I am not this era’s chosen son of the heavens.”

A Sovereign had yet to manifest, so the karmic luck support had yet to appear. That indicated that every person who had yet to undergo tribulation had a chance.

Everyone naturally wished to become Sovereign. That person would be above all others, the master of the world’s fate. However, when the cruel result appeared, even someone like Hu Feng felt great disappointment. He was not the Sovereign.

Long Chen was about to speak when Hu Feng said, “Brother Long, no need to comfort me. Although I’m disappointed, I am still the heir of the Gambling Heavenly Dao. I know my mission. I feel like you should be the chosen son of the heavens.”

In the end, Hu Feng was still Hu Feng. His heart was still clear, so his inner heart had to be powerful. Someone with a weaker heart might end up with a heart-devil from such disappointment, then they would die from the tribulation.

At this moment, more rumbling rang out, and one terrifying aura after another rose. Many people were starting their tribulations. All of a sudden, Long Chen sensed one aura in particular and rushed off in that direction.
