Chapter 4567 The World Gate Opens

Despite knowing that he shouldn’t expose his power, after hearing the crowned monkey’s provocation, Long Chen didn’t care anymore.

He fully unleashed the full power of his Seven Star Battle Armor, causing stars to cascade behind him, their radiant light illuminating the heavens and earth. Long Chen stood there like a battle god of the starry sky, emanating an undefeatable will that caused the world to tremble before him.

BOOM!

Covered in stars, his saber slashed onto the crowned monkey’s staff. With a deafening explosion, the staff shattered into fragments that pierced the monkey, leaving it riddled with gaping holes.

The monkey let out a miserable cry and tried to run, but Long Chen was not done yet.

Blood then flew through the air. The monkey let out another scream as Long Chen cut one of its legs off.

Just as Long Chen was about to unleash his astral energy once more, he suddenly realized that he was no longer able to inject it into this saber.

At some point, tiny cracks started to spread across his saber. These cracks didn’t result from clashes with the monkey’s staff but from the forceful injection of astral energy. The saber cracked under the pressure of his wild power.

In other words, even this saber couldn’t withstand his astral energy. It had already formed a spirit, and the spirit instinctively protected its life by rejecting any further astral energy.

Long Chen was both startled and enraged. He hadn’t expected that even this powerful saber was unable to contain his full astral energy.

Long Chen directly tossed it back and grabbed the bloody monkey leg, smacking the monkey’s face with it.

Long Chen was incredibly fast. In one seamless motion, he sheathed his saber, seized the monkey’s leg, and swiftly wielded it as a weapon. With pinpoint accuracy, he struck the monkey in the face with its own limb.

Its crown went flying, its mouth shattered, and blood spurted out not only from its face but also from its leg.

“Damn brute!” the monkey cursed Long Chen, its voice sharp like a ghost’s wailing. Long Chen’s actions had pushed it to the brink of fury.

How could it not be enraged? To be slapped with his own leg was a humiliation beyond measure. It was practically a historical moment.

Long Chen didn’t reply and repeatedly attacked it with its severed leg. Every attack would cause that leg to break open even more, sending flesh and blood flying.

Long Chen was in the strongest state of the Seven Star Battle Armor. Since he was using someone else’s leg, he naturally wouldn’t hold back and freely injected his astral energy into it.

It was evident that his astral energy was so strong that even that powerful saber couldn’t contain it, let alone some leg.

That was why each strike from the leg sent some more of the monkey’s flesh flying. In any case, considering it was someone else’s leg, Long Chen wasn’t aggrieved about this loss.

The golden monkey had lost its weapon and a leg. In this state, it couldn’t turn the tables on Long Chen and was repeatedly sent flying, spitting out blood.

Long Chen was like an unstoppable enraged lion and dumbfounded many experts, especially Feng You and the rest of the mixed beast race. After all, Long Chen’s fierceness was on an entirely new level. They had never seen him in this state before.

Curiously, Xie Fei and the mysterious expert in the carriage simply observed from the side. They all chose to be good spectators.

“Support our king!”

It was only at this time that the Golden Fur Heaven Merging Monkeys recovered and charged toward Long Chen. They finally realized that their undefeatable king had been defeated.

Seeing the Golden Fur Heaven Merging Monkeys take action, Feng You immediately raised her arm. “Warriors of the mixed beast race—!”

However, before Feng You could complete her command, Long Chen’s voice resounded in her mind. “Foolish girl, why are you fighting with these monkeys? Don’t move.”

At this moment, Long Chen called Lei Linger back into the primal chaos space and hurled the severed leg back at the golden monkey. It was already down to its foot anyway.

Long Chen declared, “I won’t kill you this time. If I see you again, I’ll relieve you of another part of your body. A group of monkeys want to call themselves king? How laughable.”

BOOM!

The golden monkey directly blasted the flying foot apart, causing blood to fill the air.

Consumed by rage, the monkey king didn’t even want its own foot anymore. Despite the leg being down to just a foot, extracting the essence blood inside of it would allow the monkey to rapidly recover some of its lost energy.

However, it had completely lost its cool. Unable to contain its fury, it instinctively blasted apart its own foot, screaming in a fit of rage.

Seeing that Long Chen was no longer attacking, the other Golden Fur Heaven Merging Monkeys surrounded their king, waiting for its orders.

BOOM!

Just then, a loud sound drew everyone’s attention. They saw that the vortex at the center had stopped moving.

“Charge!”

Numerous shouts rang out, and like madmen, countless experts charged for the vortex.

Long Chen was amongst them, along with Feng You and her companions. They joined and charged for the vortex. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

“Whoever isn’t afraid of dying, come now! Boss Long San will accompany you!” Long Chen’s saber materialized in his hand as he charged forward, shouting with determination.

Once again, stars ignited upon the saber. After its brief rest, it had regained the capacity to absorb Long Chen’s astral energy.

While the saber looked frightening now, it couldn’t actually endure more of Long Chen’s energy. After all, it needed some time to heal from the last burst of wild astral energy.

However, this was enough. Just the appearance of this saber covered in stars and the lingering impact of its devastating strikes against the monkey king were enough to thoroughly intimidate these peak experts.

Just now, Long Chen had indeed seemed like a madman. This was why even the likes of Xie Fei and the mysterious expert in the carriage hadn’t joined in the fray.

However, their hesitation didn’t stem from fear of Long Chen but from their desire to reserve their energy for the imminent entry into the Fantasy Spirit World. With Long Chen brandishing his weapon at everyone as if telling them to hurry up and attack him, they remained silent, biding their time.

Long Chen and Feng You were leading the mixed beast race right at the front, along with tens of thousands of powerful factions. Everyone squeezed together as they rushed toward the vortex.

As they approached the vortex, the surroundings underwent a dramatic transformation. The spatial gate vanished, replaced by an immense jungle that sprawled before them.

The trees here were thousands of miles tall, enveloping them in a dense canopy that obscured the sky. Lost within the confines of this jungle, an oppressive atmosphere weighed down on their souls, as if a heavy rock was crushing their hearts, suffocating them.

“AH!”

Just as Long Chen and the others were startled by this sudden change, screams rang out from their midst. Following that, Long Chen’s blood ran cold as he witnessed a chilling scene unfold before him.
