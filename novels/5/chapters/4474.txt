Chapter 4463 Dealing With the Ten Thousand Dragon Nest

The enormous Ten Thousand Dragon Nest floated in the primal chaos space. In the outside world, it was an apocalyptic killing weapon, but it didn’t even dare to move here.

“How are you planning to deal with it?” asked the Earth Cauldron as it appeared in front of Long Chen. It was the only existence capable of freely moving between Long Chen’s primal chaos space and his spiritual space.

“Do you have any guidance, senior?” asked Long Chen.

“When it comes to the Ten Thousand Dragon Nest, you have two options. The first is to borrow the power of this space to make it submit. Then, you can use it and will have the power to challenge Saints,” said the Earth Cauldron.

“The power to challenge Saints? So if I do encounter Saints, I still won’t have the power to kill them with it?” asked Long Chen.Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

“The Ten Thousand Dragon Nest contains the will of countless generations of experts from the nether dragon race. It won’t readily submit, even under the influence of the primal chaos space’s pressure. To command its power, you’ll need to use your core energy. As you are not a Saint, at most, you can unleash ten percent of its power. Furthermore, when it doesn’t wish to cooperate with you, ten percent might be an optimistic estimate—sometimes even less. While this nest grants you the ability to defend against ordinary Saints, defeating or killing one would still be an arduous task.”

Long Chen nodded. It was about what he had expected. Activating the Ten Thousand Dragon Nest would require the nether dragon race’s bloodline.

As Long Chen possessed true dragon essence blood, perhaps he would be able to control a different Ten Thousand Dragon Nest. However, since the nether dragon race had betrayed the dragon race, their nest would not obey Long Chen’s true dragon blood. This explained why he had to use Netherdragon Tianzhao’s essence blood to draw the nest into the primal chaos space.

“Then I’ll take the second option,” said Long Chen.

The Earth Cauldron seemed baffled. After a moment, it said, “I haven’t even said what the second option is.”

Long Chen smiled. “The second option is to directly toss it into the black soil and turn it into fertilizer. The Ten Thousand Dragon Nest is composed of countless dragon corpses, so once it is devoured, it will unleash unimaginable life energy. Then I’ll be able to grow even more Thousand Leaf Sacred Light Snow Lotuses and refine more Saint Light Snow Lotus Pills. It is immensely beneficial to both of us.”

The Earth Cauldron was silent for a moment. “In truth, the second option is most beneficial to me, and it doesn’t provide substantial assistance to you. Given my characteristics, I can’t help you too much in battle. Most of the time, I can only help you block a few attacks. For example, if Netherdragon Tianzhao had used his spear to launch a divine ability instead of directly slamming it into me, I wouldn’t have been able to break it. Although the Ten Thousand Dragon Nest may not offer extensive support, it can still be regarded as a life-saving trump card.”

The Earth Cauldron was one-half of the Heaven Earth Cauldron, and it resembled water that nourished all things. Unable to change its characteristics, it was known as a true-blue refining divine item, not a killing one.

Killing went against its innate nature, so it wasn’t able to help Long Chen too much in a battle. While it wanted to refine more Sacred Light Snow Lotus Pills, it refrained from being selfish and made things clear to Long Chen, letting him make his own choice.

Long Chen simply smiled. “In this world, is there such a thing as an absolute life-saving trump card? You can’t trust such things too much. Otherwise, Netherdragon Tianzhao wouldn’t have been beaten so badly. If he hadn’t sacrificed his own life in the end, he would have died like a dog. Rather than keeping life-saving trump cards in reserve, it would be better to use them to increase your own power. The Sacred Light Snow Lotus Pill is capable of upgrading both of our powers. So in my opinion, the two options can’t be compared.”

“You should take your time to consider. After all, I am only capable of offering you a limited amount of help,” advised the Earth Cauldron.

It was worried about Long Chen encountering danger in the future and unable to deal with it without the Ten Thousand Dragon Nest. As one of the ten great primal chaos divine items, the Earth Cauldron had its own pride. It wouldn’t deceive Long Chen for its own gain.

“I’ve thought it through. The Ten Thousand Dragon Nest’s runes are all used in the nether dragon race’s cultivation arts. As my brothers train in the Dragon Blood Body Tempering Art, they have the true dragon race’s divine abilities and would look down on absorbing this filthy essence blood. As for myself, as the heir to the true dragon race, I have inherited the dragon race’s pride as well. I’m not going to use something from traitors for anything except fertilizer,” replied Long Chen.

Although Long Chen knew that the Ten Thousand Dragon Nest was a terrifying existence, he didn’t want it. He could extract the Saint essence blood inside it and let the Dragonblood warriors absorb it, allowing their realms to rise to a shocking level.

However, the Dragon Blood Body Tempering Art came from the true dragon race, so how could he use the blood of traitors to increase his brothers’ power? It wouldn’t be any different than a betrayal.

The Earth Cauldron expressed satisfaction with Long Chen's decision. “Then I’m at ease. I don’t want to influence your judgment of the pros and cons in this case.”

Long Chen spoke with gratitude, “Senior, our encounter was destiny. You’ve helped me several times, and I am extremely grateful to you already. Even if I die because of this decision, I will not hold the slightest resentment toward you.”

The Earth Cauldron suddenly fell silent. As Long Chen didn’t get any more responses, his mind left the primal chaos space.

Inside the primal chaos space, the Earth Cauldron’s runes suddenly flowed around it, and the golden lotus seed in the sky also unleashed a blaze of light. The two seemed to be communicating.

Finally, the Earth Cauldron sighed. “What is right? What is wrong? Even after countless years, I still don’t know. Fine, I’ll wait for the Heaven Cauldron to return first. After all, I am too foolish, and the Heaven Cauldron has the best ideas.”

After that, the Earth Cauldron also left the primal chaos space, returning to Long Chen’s spiritual space to rest.

“Boss, don’t be in a rush! These corpses are too valuable! We have to slowly process them before giving them to you!” Seeing Long Chen walk over, Guo Ran hastily cried out.

There were too many corpses here, and their crystal cores and Neidans were priceless treasures. As some corpses needed Xia Chen and Guo Ran to personally go through them, they were progressing rather slowly with cleaning up the battlefield.

It took three whole days before they finished. Fortunately, the palace master had brought the sleeping Little Crane back to the academy.

This time, in order to help Ye Ling resist the power of the Heavenly Daos and regain her power as a Saint, Little Crane had exhausted herself, which hurt Long Chen and the others. It could be said that without Little Crane, they wouldn’t have managed to win this time.

Three days later, they finally finished tidying up the battlefield, and the Dragonblood warriors left in high spirits, leaving behind only a devastated Heavenly Fiend Prefecture.
