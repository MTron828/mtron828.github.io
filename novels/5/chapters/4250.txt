Chapter 4239: Ultimate Battle Commence

Long Chen knew that someone would try to stop him, and his intuition was correct. This Sword Qi was incomparably sharp and fast, and it was aimed at his head.

BOOM!

Long Chen paused in the air. Stamping on the air, he unleashed a punch that shattered the Sword Qi. After that, through the qi waves, he saw a young man with a sword on his back.

He was a tall and handsome man with extraordinary bearing, but he was also surrounded by an exceedingly arrogant air.

“Long Chen, is it? I am Ye Wuchen from the Eternal Ye clan. Draw your sword. I will not kill those who aren’t prepared.”

This man was a member of an Eternal clan, the Ye clan’s peerless heavenly genius, Ye Wuchen. The moment he appeared, he directly challenged Long Chen.

“It seems that the Grand Yan’s imperial line isn’t the only one who set this up. Even your Ye clan wants to stop us! Now it’s interesting.” Long Chen narrowed his eyes. It seemed that this matter was even more complicated than he had imagined.

Moreover, to his surprise, the ones to stop him were actually from the human race and not other races.

Countless people were shocked to see someone stop Long Chen. Were the Eternal clans the ones behind the scenes?

Ye Wuchen sneered, “Is yelling out this kind of slander interesting? Do you think that everyone else is stupid and only you are smart?”

“Oh? I want to hear it then. What’s your excuse for fighting me?” asked Long Chen indifferently.

The nine spatial gates had opened, but the dark domain lords were descending very slowly. If it really was as Mo Nian said and this was a sacrificial ceremony, it would indeed take some time to activate. Seeing that he was in no rush, he could learn the full story now.

“Hahaha, Long Chen, do you not know who you are? You and Mo Nian are both bandits. One is a graverobber and the other is a swindler. One steals dead people’s treasures, and one snatches living people’s treasures. No one would believe anything you say!” sneered Ye Wuchen.

This response caused quite a bit of murmuring within the human race. Quite a few people began to whisper amongst themselves.

“Long Chen really isn’t a good person. He has repeatedly plundered the Soaring Dragon Company and even used them to trick countless people into attending an auction for his ‘Heaven Earth Cauldron’.”

“Mo Nian isn’t better off. Did you not see all the warrants out for him? There are his pictures throughout the Sage King Prefecture. Considering that he’s a graverobber…”

“Long Chen even found an excuse to expel the experts who went to the High Firmament Academy to study! He cut them off from the academy’s knowledge that was supposed to be shared with the world! He’s a petty little person who can’t be trusted!”

Although many people were whispering, some voices were not as quiet. It was as if they were afraid of others not hearing, so they intentionally spread their voices.

Hearing all this, Long Chen slowly smiled. He didn’t respond, but he saw who was talking the loudest.

Ye Wuchen had clearly come prepared, but Long Chen didn’t bother exposing him. He just watched, waiting for him to continue his performance.

“You two are infamous for what you’ve done, yet you slander others. It’s the very peak of shamelessness and treachery. Moreover, this is the Sage King martial stage, a place where everything is governed by the Heavenly Daos. Your actions are nothing but a violation of the rules. In the worst-case scenario, you will cause the very Heavenly Daos of this place to collapse, leading the martial stage to explode and kill us all. Tell me, what are you planning?!” Toward the end, Ye Wuchen’s voice grew louder until he was hurling accusations at Long Chen. Now, when people looked at Long Chen and the others, killing intent gradually appeared in their eyes.

“Long Chen, you’ve offended too many people, is that it? Knowing that you can’t escape, you’re trying to drag all of us down with you!” shouted an expert from the demonic beast race.

“I understand. There are numerous factions here that hold grudges against you. You know that they won’t let you leave alive, so you’re going to drag us all down with you!” A roar came from the devil race.

“How vile! Our Blood race cannot live under the same heavens as you! Since this is the case, we’ll just kill you first!”

“The Netherworld’s races are also mortal enemies with Long Chen. You dare to collude with Wu Tian? That is a crime worthy of the death penalty. Long Chen, since you’re so malicious, there’s nothing for us to say. We’ll kill you.”

“You’re a swindler, a completely intolerable scammer! My Ghost Dao will stop at nothing until it claims your life! Long Chen, if you're in such a hurry to meet your demise, I'll be more than happy to oblige!” Unexpectedly, even the Ghost Dao lifeform that had bought the fake Heaven Earth Cauldron appeared now.

“I don’t care how you plan on playing around. My Shadow race will accompany you to the end. However, if you’re trying to drag us down with you, then keep dreaming!” The leader of the Shadow race also shouted.

As more and more people spoke up, people realized that Long Chen’s enemies were spread throughout the martial stage. Even amongst the human race, the majority had some grudge against him. With a single speech, Ye Wuchen pushed Long Chen to the heart of the conflict.

Now, all the experts who had joined Long Chen’s camp stared at him worriedly. After all, they weren’t too familiar with Long Chen. Now that others had questioned Long Chen, they also started to have suspicions.

“We’re only after Long Chen and won’t involve innocent people. Since you didn’t see Long Chen’s true face before this, I’ll give you a chance. Leave now and return to the human race. We can pretend that nothing happened before this. This is your final chance. If you miss it, don’t blame others for being merciless!” Ye Wuchen eyed the group behind Long Chen.

The human race’s experts actually opened up a path, as if welcoming them into their embrace. Those experts were truly enticed.

Long Chen then looked back at the ones behind him. “Among you are the people who I saved and people who saved me. The people who I saved, you can leave whenever you want. It didn’t cost me anything to save you, so I won’t ask for any recompense. However, those who saved me, I ask that you stay behind. You were able to step forward to help me when danger arose. That is enough to prove the righteousness in your hearts, the hot blood in your chests. I trust that after saving me, you also won’t ask for anything from me. We are the same people. Since you could trust me once, you can trust me a second time, right?”

These words were spoken with utmost sincerity, causing those people to feel their blood heating up. They almost felt like doubting Long Chen was a sin.

“Brother Long Chen, we believe in you! You definitely aren’t such a person!”

“Don’t believe him! He is a swindler! Everyone, let’s go quickly. If we don’t, we’ll just end up dying with him!”

As millions of cultivators behind Long Chen left, Long Chen’s side instantly shrank by almost half of its original size.

The Dragonblood warriors were ashen. These were the very individuals they had rescued on the staircase, but they were just like animals. After being saved, they left at the drop of a hat and even slandered Long Chen during the process. Now, the Dragonblood warriors had the urge to kill them.

However, the disturbance quickly ended. Those that wanted to leave had left, and those that wanted to stay had stayed. Moreover, those who were staying all had staunch gazes.

“You really are fools. Since you want to die so badly, don’t blame others.” Ye Wuchen sneered upon seeing so many people still believe in Long Chen.

“Hahaha!” Suddenly, Long Chen raised his head and laughed delightedly. “Good, not one of my brothers who came to aid me left. I, Long Chen, will thank you.”

Long Chen cupped his fists toward these people. He was extremely moved that not one of those brave experts had left. They all chose to trust him once again.

As for those whom he had rescued on the staircase, a portion of them did stay. Although they weren’t as numerous, their gazes were also filled with trust in Long Chen, channeling Long Chen with endless power.

“You thank them, so you’re going to drag them into the abyss with you? Long Chen, you really are evil,” sneered Ye Wuchen.

Suddenly, without any warning, Long Chen appeared in front of Ye Wuchen and slapped him in the face. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

The next moment, Ye Wuchen was sent flying like a shooting star. Long Chen then raised his head and shouted, his voice akin to a god’s roar, resounding throughout every corner of heaven and earth.

“No need for any more words. Today, I, Long Chen, will break this trap of yours. If gods block me, I will slay gods; if devils block me, I will slay devils. Come, let the ultimate battle commence!”
