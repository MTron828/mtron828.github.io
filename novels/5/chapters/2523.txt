Chapter 2513 Wind Moon Severs Twilight and Dawn

Millions of poison dragons were revived. Their roars shook people’s ears, and soundwaves unfurled throughout heaven and earth, making people feel like their eardrums would shatter. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“Hahaha, Long Chen, you’re too naive. Did you really think you had stopped me? Now everything is too late. I finished the altar ceremony while fighting you, and this giant tree’s final trace of life energy has been used to revive this army of the dead. The Heaven Devouring Black Armor Corps, the generals, and now even the poison dragon army have all been revived. Next will be the four great divine generals and then finally the Heaven Devouring Fiend King. None of it can be stopped. All your struggles are meaningless. To tell the truth, I really don’t want to kill you. I’d like you to live to personally see my dead army destroying the foolish Righteous path of the Martial Heaven Continent when I return.” Ye Ming laughed arrogantly.

Just at that moment, the army of poison dragons charged toward the Dragonblood Legion.

Guo Ran jumped in shock and temporarily gave up on Zhao Ritian. He formed up the legion to handle the poison dragons.

Gu Yang charged out first, sending the first poison dragon flying with his spear. However, just as he sent it flying, its tail whipped over. Gu Yang twisted his spear to block it.

“Watch out!”

The poison dragon’s tail suddenly shot out a bone spur that pierced Gu Yang’s shoulder. A loud scream rang out.

The Dragonblood warriors were shocked. Gu Yang was a captain of the Dragonblood Legion. Even if his arm was cut off, he wouldn’t even frown.

Along with the scream, Gu Yang was clenching his teeth and veins were throbbing on his forehead. The pain he was under was clearly unimaginable.

Gu Yang pulled out the bone spur. Black blood gushed out along with a disgusting stench.

The bone spur was three feet long and so sharp that it had even pierced Gu Yang’s armor. Gu Yang hastily consumed an anti-poison pill.

However, in just a short time, his entire face turned black. This poison was truly fierce.

“Everyone, be careful! Focus on defense!” called out Xia Chen as he hastily switched the formation.

Liu Ruyan spread her branches, forming a giant barrier.

Those poison dragons were blocked by the branches when they charged in. They were unable to spread their wings freely and struggled against the branches. They then spat out some kind of black mist.

Even Liu Ruyan’s branches, which were as tough as divine items, were corroded by that mist.

Fortunately, Liu Ruyan was an Undying Willow. Even as her branches were broken, new ones formed.

As they struggled, the same venomous bone spurs shot out of their tails at the Dragonblood Legion.

This time, Sword Qi shot out, blasting apart the bone spurs. Having learned how dangerous they were, the Dragonblood warriors did not dare to be touched by them.

Gu Yang suddenly tossed a bomb through Liu Ruyan’s barrier. It flew into the midst of the poison dragons and exploded.

What Guo Ran hadn’t expected was for a large mass of them to be killed. Their bodies were easily pierced by the shrapnel inside the bomb. Their defensive power was surprisingly weak.

“What’s going on? Isn’t the dragon race always praised for having the strongest physical bodies?” Everyone was stunned. The dragons that they had encountered all had terrifying physical bodies.

What they didn’t know was that due to pursuing absolute killing power, the poison dragons’ physical bodies had regressed. In return, they had managed to evolve poison fangs and spurs to handle their opponents.

It was precisely due to abandoning the tough physical bodies that the dragon race was proudest of and using poison as their greatest support that they were viewed as a humiliation by the dragon race.

In the dragon race’s eyes, using poison was a shameful thing. Let alone the proud dragon race, even amongst the human race, using poison was considered lowly conduct.

Such people were looked down upon, so the dragon race especially could not accept such a thing. They would kill the poison dragons on sight.

Although the poison dragon race had no backbone and depended on other experts to survive, their poison was truly powerful. Beasts in the same realm as them were not their match.

Amongst their poison claws, poison fangs, and poison spurs, the poison glands within their fangs were actually the strongest. Being bitten by them was usually fatal.

As for this particular species of the poison dragon race, the long-tailed poison dragons, they were an especially difficult kind to deal with due to their poison glands being split into three kinds, a stabbing pain poison, a paralyzing poison, and a corroding poison.

The spurs on their tails were specialized for causing pain as they fully stimulated the pain nerves. That pain could cause even large beasts to die. Those beasts would scream for half a day while their bodies twitched uncontrollably. The fact that Gu Yang had not fainted from the pain was a testament to his powerful will.

In exchange for this powerful poison, the long-tailed poison dragons had lost their powerful defenses, making that their weakness.

Guo Ran’s probing blow instantly exposed that weakness. As long as they didn’t get close to the poison dragons, they were nothing to be afraid of.

“Big sister Wan-er, you’ll be the sword, while we’ll be the shield. Mingyu, keep an eye on Zhao Ritian. It seems he’s plotting something against us. We’ll distance ourselves from him.” Guo Ran quickly gave orders. He had noticed that Zhao Ritian, who had intentionally created distance from them, was now slowly getting closer again. He was definitely trying to take advantage of this timing.

“Alright.” Tang Wan-er nodded. She formed hand seals, and the void began to tremble. A powerful breeze erupted as Tang Wan-er’s manifestation appeared.

“Wind Moon Severs Twilight and Dawn.”

Tang Wan-er said the name of her manifestation out loud. A crescent moon appeared within her manifestation.

The crescent moon illuminated the night sky with a pure and gentle light. Everything became tranquil.

However, when that crescent moon began to slowly spin, countless crescent blades shot out like a furious sea into the world. The tranquility was shattered, and spacetime was thrown into chaos.

That crescent moon began to spin faster and faster until it no longer appeared to be a crescent moon, but a full moon due to how fast it was spinning.

A transparent blade appeared in Tang Wan-er’s hand. The crescent blades behind her rumbled as millions of them were unleashed upon the poison dragons.

The crescent blades were like a sea crashing down upon them. Any of them touched by the blades were sliced through. They were quickly cut into nothing more than dust.

“Wan-er has actually fully awakened her manifestation and obtained its true name!” The distant Long Chen was surprised and delighted.

Tang Wan-er’s combat power was terrifying, but the regretful thing was that the wind element inheritances on the Martial Heaven Continent were extremely sparse, resulting in her never having a master to guide her.

However, there was no need to question the terror of the wind element. Having awakened the true name of her manifestation, Tang Wan-er was finally displaying her own light.

With Tang Wan-er taking the lead, the Dragonblood Legion slaughtered the poison dragons. They were unstoppable, with a sea of wind blades sweeping through the battlefield.

“Hmph, even if that girl has awakened her manifestation’s true name, so what? There are millions of poison dragons here. Even if she exhausts herself to death, she can’t kill them all. Aren’t you getting happy too soon?” sneered Ye Ming.

Long Chen looked at him. “Idiot, did you specialize in studying how to talk stupid in your last life? Everyone within the Dragonblood Legion is powerful in their own right. No one can underestimate them. Anyone who has, died a miserable death. But don’t worry, it won’t be long before you understand yourself.”

Lightning flashed beneath Long Chen’s feet, and he charged toward the center of the altar. As the poison dragons left the altar, it revealed a platform. That platform had the Heaven Devouring Fiend King’s corpse seated on it.

Below the platform were four large armored experts. They were kneeling toward the altar. Their bodies had been covered by the poison dragons previously, but now they were exposed.

Ye Ming’s figure flickered, and he blocked Long Chen’s path, sneering, “You want to break the altar? I won’t let you do as you please.”

“Who says I need your permission?” sneered Long Chen, attacking with Evilmoon.

Ye Ming was knocked back by Long Chen. In terms of brute power, he wasn’t a match for Long Chen. Furthermore, his dark energy was unable to counter Evilmoon. Nothing he could do was effective against Long Chen.

Long Chen forced Ye Ming back repeatedly, getting closer and closer to the platform. Once he was there, he kicked one of the four armored experts.

These four should be the four divine generals beneath the fiend king that Ye Ming had mentioned. Although they were already dead, he could sense that they were existences above the Netherpassage realm.

BOOM!

The head that Long Chen kicked didn’t budge. Instead, Long Chen felt like he had kicked a star, and sharp pain made him stagger.

“It’s useless. The altar is protected by a formation. Your power is unable to break its defenses,” said Ye Ming.

“Idiot, if it was really useless, you would be letting me waste my energy instead of trying to stop me. You’ve already exposed your weak point,” said Long Chen.

“Hmph, I’m just warning you out of the kindness of my heart. If you want to go, just keep wasting your energy,” sneered Ye Ming, attacking with his jagged sword.

Long Chen began to test the altar as he blocked Ye Ming’s attacks. He found that it really was as Ye Ming had said. There was a mysterious energy protecting the altar, preventing him from breaking it.

“You’re already dead, so why revive? That’s far too much effort. I’ll give you a proper cremation.”

After trying several times, Long Chen suddenly sent Ye Ming flying. Enraged, a ball of flames appeared in Long Chen’s hand, and he sent it flying toward the altar.

Upon seeing that ball of flames, Ye Ming’s expression instantly became ugly.
