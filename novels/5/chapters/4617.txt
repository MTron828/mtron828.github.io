Chapter 4606 Great Sun Sunflower

This was not a python; rather, it was a vine. Riddled in holes like a honeycomb, the vine presented a terrifying sight as it crept up silently. When it got close to Long Chen, it synchronized with Long Chen‚Äôs steps, skillfully keeping itself concealed within his blind spot.

In theory, an expert‚Äôs senses could cover every direction, but there were no absolutes. Even when their senses covered every direction, there were always stronger and weaker areas.

A person‚Äôs blind spot went straight back from the pit of their stomach through their spine in a straight line, with two additional blind spots leaning to the left and right. Typically, these three blind spots were the areas where assassins struck the most often.

As for this vine, it was like a python, slowly creeping up from Long Chen‚Äôs blind spot. The way it swayed as it perfectly followed Long Chen‚Äôs footsteps allowed it to stay within Long Chen‚Äôs blind spot.

‚ÄúBig Brother Long Chen...‚Äù

‚ÄúShh. I see it.‚Äù Long Chen gestured for Huo Linger not to speak, as that would distract him.

From the moment the vine appeared, Long Chen already sensed its existence. After all, not many things could deceive the senses of the Nine Star Hegemon Body Art.

Long Chen didn‚Äôt want to alarm it and just let it get closer. This was a powerful lifeform, but Long Chen couldn‚Äôt sense its aura, which meant that this vine was nothing more than a probing blow. Its true body was somewhere else.

‚ÄúHehe, so Big Brother Long Chen is up to something bad again,‚Äù laughed Huo Linger.

Long Chen carefully advanced, occasionally looking behind and around him. No matter how he turned, the vine in the mist remained in his blind spot.

With the thickness of an arm, it remained less than three meters from Long Chen the entire time. Long Chen suddenly stopped advancing, and the vine followed.

Long Chen seemed to sense something and started to look around anxiously. However, he was unable to see anything as the vine moved along with him.

After a while, Long Chen seemed to relax and continued onward. Just as he took another step, that vine suddenly shot forward, instantly wrapping around Long Chen‚Äôs neck.

Long Chen let out a startled cry. When the vine wrapped around his neck, it fiercely pulled him underground.

Long Chen struggled but was quickly dragged beneath the sand. Any marks of his struggle slowly faded away on the ground.

Despite being covered by dragon scales, Long Chen still felt some pain as countless stingers came out of the vine, stabbing into him and producing creaking sounds.

To his astonishment, these stingers actually left white marks on his dragon scales, indicating that they were tougher than Eternal divine weapons.

If Long Chen had not undergone the blood-switching process, therefore greatly increasing the power of his dragon armor, he wouldn‚Äôt have been able to block these stingers.

The stingers were dark red and produced some sticky fluid on them, which looked clearly poisonous. Long Chen knew that he wouldn‚Äôt be able to withstand the poison if it got into him. N√™ww ùíÑhapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(ùíÜ)l/bin(.)com

As Long Chen ‚Äúwildly‚Äù struggled, dozens of these vines appeared around him. Within the sand, they bound him tightly, dragging him deeper.

The ground here was very soft as it consisted of white bone granules. No matter how Long Chen struggled, he was unable to escape his fate of being dragged underground.

After a while of being dragged through the ground, Long Chen found himself in an underground space. Despite being deep underground, there was curiously an open space here.

However, this place was filled with a giant root system that looked like pythons. They were what created the scaffolding for this underground space.

This place was extremely clean, save for a blood pool at the center. Within the depths of this blood pool lay an object emitting a radiant glow akin to that of the sun.

‚ÄúThe Great Sun Sunflower! A rare immemorial species!‚Äù

Seeing the sunflower, Long Chen‚Äôs eyes almost popped out of their sockets. He recognized this legendary divine medicine.

The Great Sun Sunflower existed only in the realm of legend, originating in the immemorial era and fading into extinction thereafter. Since that time, it had never graced the world with its presence again.

The Great Sun Sunflower was a divine medicine of unparalleled Yang essence, possessing potent medicinal properties. It stood as the epitome among Yang element divine medicines and held the prestigious title of the most potent ingredient for crafting Yang element pills.

The Great Sun Sunflower looked no different from an ordinary sunflower, but it radiated the light of a sun. Every single one of its seeds was a peerless treasure.

Any male, regardless of their race, would experience a significant surge in power and endurance upon consuming a single seed of the Great Sun Sunflower. Additionally, it would activate and enhance their innate bloodline abilities.

Other than that, it also had one heaven-defying use: it could treat male infertility.

It was a well-known fact that as cultivators grew stronger, their likelihood of conceiving diminished, with male infertility being a primary concern.

This was one of the laws of the Heavenly Daos. Without it, the potential consequences could be catastrophic. Imagine if a Sage King engaged in prolific mating with ordinary individuals, spawning numerous exceptionally talented descendants each year. Such a scenario had the potential to plunge the world into utter chaos.

Since this was the case, some Eternal experts might find themselves unable to conceive a single child despite decades, or even centuries, of fervent attempts.

However, the Great Sun Sunflower‚Äôs heaven-defying ability was to greatly increase the chance of conception. This one point made the Great Sun Sunflower a priceless treasure that countless experts dreamed of obtaining.

At this moment, countless tentacles were dragging Long Chen toward that blood pool. Long Chen was still ‚Äústruggling with all his might‚Äù to escape. However, he couldn‚Äôt.

Just then, a giant head stuck out of the blood pool. Before Long Chen could even see its face clearly, its huge mouth opened up.

Long Chen couldn‚Äôt control himself anymore. The moment he was inside its mouth, his power erupted.

‚ÄúLightning Flame World Extermination!‚Äù Long Chen roared. With lightning flashing in his left hand and flames raging in his right, the two energies erupted at the same time.
