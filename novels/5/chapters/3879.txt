Chapter 3868 Dragon Burial Land

Long Chen was like a shooting star piercing through the void. His lightning wings pushed his speed to the peak.

As he flew, he saw eruptions of primal chaos qi in the distance around him. Countless lifeforms fought over those places, so bloody battles were everywhere.

Looking at those eruptions and the soaring pillars of primal chaos qi, Long Chen truly wished to go fight for some as well.

As Long Chen flew, he saw more than ten such locations. These treasure lands were all different. For some, the primal chaos qi eruptions were small, only emitting pillars of primal chaos qi a few hundred meters thick.

However, for the large ones, the pillars could be thousands of miles thick. The greater the scale, the more numerous the lifeforms present and the greater the competition.

Even from this distance, Long Chen could see them roaring and tearing at each other in a bloody battle. In order to gain more primal chaos qi, they were going crazy.

“Senior, should I first go compete for some primal chaos qi as well?” Long Chen’s eyes reddened as he looked at those surging pillars of primal chaos qi.

Primal chaos qi was the original energy of heaven and earth. It was the purest kind of energy. So, the more primal chaos qi that a person controlled, the greater their control over heaven and earth’s energy would be, and the more familiar they would feel toward the Heavenly Daos. It was something that Long Chen urgently needed.

“Who cares about this tiny bit of primal chaos qi? Let me tell you, this primal chaos qi is only the slightest taste of what is to come. At this initial stage, both the quantity and quality of the primal chaos qi are lacking. The best time to fight for primal chaos qi is once the primal chaos qi eruption reaches the end. Fighting with these small fish now is meaningless,” said the dragon expert disdainfully.

Since the dragon expert had said this, Long Chen ignored the primal chaos qi eruptions for now. He didn’t say much. In any case, listening to the dragon expert couldn’t be wrong.

Long Chen flew for three days. As time passed, he saw fewer and fewer eruptions. On the final day, he didn’t even see a single pillar of primal chaos qi.

He couldn’t help asking, “Senior, are you sure that we’re not going in the wrong direction? We didn’t end up running to the edge of this world, did we?”

“Nonsense. We’ll arrive soon,” said the dragon expert irritably.

Just as it said this, Long Chen’s essence blood began to heat up. It felt like it was boiling as he felt an intense summons.

Furthermore, at this time, a mass of broken space appeared before him. It was like a broken gate. Through this gate, he saw a desolate world.

Once he got close to this gate, Long Chen’s heart pounded wildly. He saw countless dragon corpses and a great amount of dragon qi in this place. When the mist rose through the air, those skeletons seemed to fade in and out of the mist.

After that, a sacred dragon might that was wrapped in primal chaos qi blasted at Long Chen. A dragon roar came from Long Chen’s soul. That roar seemed to come from far in the distant past and wanted to drag Long Chen out of reality and back into that ancient world.

By the time Long Chen arrived here, countless other lifeforms were already absorbing the dragon qi. Most of these lifeforms were related to the dragon race, and they were absorbing the dragon qi to nourish their own bodies.

However, there were also some lifeforms with special divine items that were absorbing the dragon qi into storage receptacles.

When Long Chen arrived, quite a few lifeforms looked at him warily. Some didn’t even hesitate to unleash their killing intent. They had already occupied their own areas. Anyone who dared to get close would be attacked.

“What? Did I get here too late?!”

Long Chen’s expression changed. He saw endless dragon corpses littering the ground. Many lifeforms had already carved out their own territories.

“Ignore them. Keep going forward. This place is nothing more than the edge,” said the dragon expert.

Long Chen continued flying forward. He ignored the lifeforms below and had no intention of fighting for their territories. With him flying high above, they didn’t make things hard on him.

“Hey, little brother, wait a moment. I’m willing to share half of my territory with you.” Just as Long Chen was flying by, a tall and muscular woman with a horn shouted loudly at him.

“Ignore her. She’s from a branch of the coiled dragon race, the Li dragon race. They’re all greedy and corrupt. As soon as they see someone of the opposite sex that they like, they’ll try to copulate with them, not caring from which race,” said the dragon expert disdainfully, clearly looking down on her. In fact, its tone was almost hateful.

Long Chen looked at her. Her arms were thicker than his own legs, and her chest was like two large watermelons. She seemed to be about to drool when she looked at Long Chen. Upon seeing this, his hair stood on end, and he immediately shot off.

“Senior, isn’t your entire dragon race very uh… lustful?” asked Long Chen.

“Bullshit! Who said that?!” raged the dragon expert.

“Aren’t there stories? There’s even an expression, the dragon has nine sons, all of them different. Isn’t that because they mate with different lifeforms? Is that incorrect?” asked Long Chen.

“Hmph. The dragon race has three thousand major races and a million minor branches. Only those from the weaker branches will mate with other powerful lifeforms in hopes of improving their bloodline. It’s merely self-preservation. The truly powerful races have powerful bloodline divine abilities, and they usually can’t even awaken half of those divine abilities. If they aren’t even done awakening their own divine abilities, why would they covet other races’ divine abilities? Those dragons that copulate outside the dragon race are simply weak and have reached the limit of their own bloodline. It is the sacred dragon that transforms from the serpent to the python, the python to the drake, and the drake to the dragon. After experiencing countless dangers and tribulations, the sacred dragon transforms step by step, gradually gaining this sacred power. The dragon race’s sacred dragon is the greatest existence in the dragon race. The dragon is the king of the beasts, and the sacred dragon is the emperor of the dragons. The sacred dragon’s bloodline is the most sacred and noble bloodline. Do you think that such an existence would lower themself by mixing their bloodline with other lifeforms?” snorted the dragon expert disdainfully.

“Then are you a sacred dragon?” probed Long Chen.

“What do you think?” retorted the dragon expert. “Why do I help you? Isn’t it because our experiences are very similar? We are growing from weak to strong through experiencing countless dangerous trials, breaking through bloody bindings of fire, and walking the path of experts step by step. Thus, I am telling you that Luo Zichuan’s cultivation path does not suit you. It is not just his path; everyone’s paths are different from yours and are not suitable for you. You should constantly accumulate experience and grasp your own comprehension from bloody battles. In the end, you will walk a path that only belongs to you, an unrivaled path that cannot be replicated,” said the dragon expert profoundly.

Long Chen nodded inside. The dragon expert’s words resonated with him. Let alone Luo Zichuan’s path, even the path of the Nine Star Hegemon Body Art was no longer his. He had to find his own path.Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

As he advanced further, the dragon qi grew stronger, and he heard dragon cries ringing out in waves. Those voices descended through the Heavenly Daos, transmitting to the present from the distant past. They were filled with an ancient feeling, as well as sorrow and fury.

Suddenly, he heard a wild dragon roar that shook his heart. Looking toward it, he saw a giant golden dragon ten thousand meters long. It was coiled on the ground like a sleeping golden dragon.

This giant dragon’s head was looking toward the heavens as if it was roaring. Although it had been dead for countless years, its terrifying dragon pressure still caused all the surrounding space to twist.

Long Chen was delighted. “Senior, is this you?”

“Are you stupid? I’m not dead yet!” raged the dragon expert.

“Oh, oh, sorry.” Long Chen hastily apologized.

Long Chen’s pupils suddenly shrank. He saw someone on top of that golden dragon’s head. Someone had gotten here first.

When Long Chen saw that person’s face clearly, that person also saw Long Chen. The moment he saw Long Chen, his face twisted. The scar on his face made him look even more sinister.

“Long Chen, let’s see how arrogant you can be without Xia Guhong.”
