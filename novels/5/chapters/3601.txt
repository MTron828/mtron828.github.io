Chapter 3590

Guo Ran and Wang Zixu appeared on the martial stage a few meters away from each other. They coldly looked at each other, brimming with killing intent.

“My boss taught me that after knowing shame comes bravery. Have you not found that I am no longer the old Guo Ran? The current me has undergone a heaven-toppling transformation. Let me tell you, this is the result of all my hard work in secret. As for you, you are still thinking of the old me that was constantly suppressed. Today is the last day of your life!” declared Guo Ran arrogantly.

Long Chen himself felt his face reddening a bit when he heard this. Guo Ran really was as shameless as ever. What secret hard work? Was that not the result of Long Chen’s efforts?

The current Guo Ran had abundant Blood Qi, and divine light flowed in his eyes. As his blood circulated, vague waves of a sacred and holy aura came from him. That was the specific aura of the true dragon.

Long Chen had already fully merged with the true dragon essence blood. That blood had sunk into his bones. Hence, as long as Long Chen didn’t use it, others would have difficulty sensing it.

As for Guo Ran, he had just merged with it and had yet to fully control his aura. Thus, the qi of the true dragon was leaking out. It made Guo Ran appear full of a holy and sacred aura. It was truly intimidating.

In the eyes of the Heavenly Dragon Divine Armor College’s disciples, Guo Ran had gone through a heaven-toppling transformation. It was unbelievable.

Most importantly, the current Guo Ran was full of arrogance and confidence. He gave off a sense of ease as if everything was within his control. Such ease made people think that he was unfathomable.

“A deliberate act to mystify others. No matter how much you’ve changed, you’re nothing more than a lowly ascender. What qualifications do you have to be mentioned in the same breath as us? Some people are born naturally above others, while some should simply lay at the feet of the strong. As for you, no matter how strong you are, you are not fit to be anything more than a servant,” sneered Wang Zixu.

In front of that provocation, Guo Ran didn’t get angry. Instead, he smiled slightly. “Keep acting arrogant. Keep acting wild. Keep up your display. Let me see just how you rein it in once we start.”

“Cut the crap! Summon your battle armor! Let us decide life and death!”

As Wang Zixu said this, his body suddenly shot toward Guo Ran, reaching him in an instant. His saber slashed down on Guo Ran.

Everyone let out startled cries. Although Wang Zixu had warned Guo Ran in advance, he didn’t actually give him any chance to prepare. This attack was far too sudden. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

“Blood Merged Armor?! How can that be?!”

Xie Qianqian cried out in shock, her expression changing.

Blood Merged Armor was a secret art of the highest level in the Heavenly Dragon Divine Armor College. It split the battle armor into two portions, one outside the body and one inside.

Just as the name implied, the Blood Merged Armor was used to merge the armor into the body, hiding it beneath the skin. It could protect a person’s bones and internal organs better. At the same time, it allowed them to fight without summoning their armor.

The inner armor could also work with the outer armor to once more raise a person’s combat power. It was one of the highest secret arts of the Heavenly Dragon Divine Armor College. Furthermore, it was said that a person would only be qualified to train in it once they became an Immortal King.

However, Wang Zixu was only a late stage Divine Lord. Clearly, his family had gone against the rules and transmitted this secret art to him in advance.

With the Blood Merged Armor, Wang Zixu’s saber whistled through the air at Guo Ran like a bolt of lightning. Even before his saber arrived, he already caused such a powerful gust of wind that the entire space quivered. This attack was something that would make even late stage World Kings change their expressions. Even if they had summoned their complete battle armor, they might not necessarily be able to block that attack.

BOOM!

Metallic ringing rang out and a whirlwind blew around Guo Ran. The astral winds shook the formation, causing it to quiver slightly.

People then saw a static scene. Wang Zixu was still in his slashing posture. As for Guo Ran, he was holding a golden battle saber and blocked Wang Zixu’s attack.

For a moment, everyone was completely silent. Wang Zixu’s full-power attack was actually easily received by Guo Ran.

The winds caused the formation to boom, so no one doubted just how powerful Wang Zixu’s attack was. And yet, it was unable to shake Guo Ran in the slightest.

“Boss really is the boss. This power is too powerful!”

Guo Ran held his saber with a single hand. At this moment, boundless power was coursing through his body. No matter how Wang Zixu’s power tried to press down on him, he was as steady as a boulder, immovable. Guo Ran’s eyes became filled with wild heat.

Long Chen had said that the current Guo Ran possessed a tenth of his power. So, Guo Ran wanted to know just how strong a tenth of his boss’s power was.

And just like what he had imagined, his boss really was the boss. A tenth of his power was enough to let Guo Ran completely dominate this battle. He was unrivaled within the Heavenly Dragon Divine Armor College.

As the two sabers clashed, an ear-piercing rumbling rang out and sparks flew. The two of them were still competing in terms of power.

Everyone looked at the calm Guo Ran who seemed completely relaxed. Just how strong was the current Guo Ran? Even without summoning his battle armor, he could block Wang Zixu in his Blood Merged Armor state.

Wang Zixu’s expression also changed. He had originally been thinking that if nothing unexpected happened, he would kill Guo Ran with this one move.

He hadn’t expected his full-power attack to be blocked. Furthermore, Guo Ran seemed to not be using any effort at all, so a bad premonition was born in Wang Zixu’s heart.

“So what if you have the Blood Merged Armor? At most, it can raise your power by three times. You think that little bit of power is enough to beat me? Even if you sneak attack me, you cannot shake me in the slightest,” snorted Guo Ran. He suddenly shoved his saber forward.

Wang Zixu instantly felt an immense force strike him. He couldn’t help retreating.

Two long grooves appeared in the ground beneath his feet. He was pushed all the way to the edge of the barrier before stabilizing.

All the experts watching gasped and looked at Guo Ran like he was a monster. Just what was going on with him? How did he suddenly become so terrifying?

After staring in shock at Guo Ran, people also couldn’t help glancing at someone sitting at the corner of the martial stage. They then stared at that mysterious and terrifying black-robed man. It was only after this man arrived that Guo Ran transformed.

Guo Ran was so powerful that even the Assembly Elders’ expressions changed. They looked at Xue Yifan and saw that his expression was still calm, as if everything was as he had predicted. He didn’t show any fluctuations from this scene, and that made their hearts clench.

Just then, runes appeared on top of Wang Zixu’s body. After that, pieces of battle armor appeared, covering him. He had finally summoned his outer battle armor. At that moment, his aura grew explosively, instantly rising dozens of times.

His battle armor rumbled and the earth quivered. The martial stage beneath his feet became covered in cracks.

“Even Wang Zixu’s Heavenly Howl Battle Armor has appeared! Heavens, he directly summoned his strongest battle armor!”

Startled cries rang out from the Heavenly Dragon Divine Armor College’s disciples. All of them had different sets of armor, for use on different kinds of battlefields and against different kinds of opponents.

Wang Zixu had sixteen battle armors, and his current set was violet gold. It was the strongest of his sixteen battle armors and was actually passed down in the Wang clan.

After Wang Zixu advanced to the Divine Lord realm, he obtained the inheritance of the Heavenly Howl Battle Armor. However, people had never seen him use it.

“Guo Ran, summon your Martial Heaven Battle Armor! Today, I will completely crush you so that you are convinced!”

Wang Zixu’s killing intent overflowed after he put on this battle armor. His voice had a metallic ringing in it now. He then pointed his saber at Guo Ran, his sharp aura locking onto him.
