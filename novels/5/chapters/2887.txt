Chapter 2876 Magistrate Apologizes

Before the head judge could say anything, Long Chen sneered, “When did I insult the dean?”

Just what kind of figure was Long Chen? What kind of play had he not seen before? This old fellow’s hostility toward him was already crystal clear to him.

“Shut up! This is the trial hall. When we haven’t permitted you to speak, you cannot randomly interject yourself!” barked the other elder.

Oh? It wasn’t just one but two? The Chu family was truly powerful. Long Chen was surprised.

Luo Bing pulled on Long Chen, indicating to him to calm down. As long as he didn’t leave evidence to be used against him, this could pass easily. But if he was provoked into beating people here, no one could save him.

However, Long Chen ignored her prompting. Looking at the elder, he sneered, “You’re joking. This is the trial hall, but has the head judge announced that the trial has started? Since the trial hasn’t started, why can’t others talk? What? Because your butt is bigger, only you can let out farts but others can’t talk?”

“Long Chen…!”

Luo Bing turned pale with fright. Long Chen’s guts were so big that he even dared to call out this elder. It had to be known that those two elders were magistrates, a position that was only the slightest bit lower than the head judge’s.

Long Chen dared to call his words farts? He was intentionally antagonizing him? They really were doomed now. Luo Bing and Luo Ning shuddered. Did Long Chen not want his life anymore?

Despite knowing not to laugh and suppressing it quickly, a few awkward chuckles rang out from the observers. Although it was quickly pulled back, the atmosphere grew extremely odd.

Those who had come here were all those with extremely high statuses. But with just a few words, Long Chen cajoled them into laughter.

“How brazen, Long Chen! You dare to insult me?!” raged the elder. He was just about to pronounce him guilty.

“Give it up. The trial hasn’t even started. Our statuses are the same right now. According to the academy’s rules, chapter seven of the trial section, the twenty-first clause and the ninth paragraph, clearly states: all trials will be impartial. The law is equally applied to all people. No one may provoke the trial judge’s dignity. Those who use insulting language will have their skin flayed as a warning… Outside of the trial, all people are equal with equal rights. Punishment cannot be carried out due to anger or selfish reasons…” Long Chen began to recite an entire section of the rulebook.

The experts present were surprised. Long Chen was actually so clear on the academy’s rules, hence, their respect for him rose. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

Through this, those two elders’ expressions sank. Not one of Long Chen’s words was off. This exceeded their expectations.

It had to be known that the laws of the academy were not a mandatory lesson for disciples. Let alone a newcomer like Long Chen, even some Elders were not so clear on these convoluted laws.

The rules were mandatory lessons to everyone, but the laws were different, especially some laws like the finer details of how trials were carried out. Only a few people knew of these things.

The only reason that all the experts present knew that Long Chen was correct was due to the expression of those two elders.

Seeing their shock, Long Chen sneered inside. He had known that spending that time reading about these laws would come in useful in the future.

In the Divine Scripture Pavilion, Long Chen had specifically read through the God Institute’s laws just to avoid unwittingly falling into someone else’s trap. He also foresaw that he would be a regular of the trial hall. As expected, he could now use what he had learned here.

“Alright, the trial has not formally started. You can freely defend your point,” said the elder without any anger. However, he then coldly said, “That doesn’t change that it is an incontestable fact that you insulted the dean. What do you say to that?”

Long Chen suddenly stood and pointed at the elder righteously. “As a magistrate, you must use neutral language and not pass judgment before trial. You can’t look at things from your personal point of view but from a spectator’s point of view. Only then can you be neutral and clearly distinguish right and wrong. But you immediately started using accusatory language and arguing with me. That shows that you already view me as guilty before the trial has even begun. You must first apologize to me, otherwise, I will report to the dean that the Discipline Institute’s magistrates have gravely failed to live up to their duty. Their job is to find justice, but they act with injustice, ruining the very foundation of the High Firmament Academy…”

Long Chen continued with a lengthy description, his mouth like a torrent. Even the slip of a single word had caused this elder to be described by Long Chen as a spy trying to topple the academy.

Hence, the elder was green with anger. He had never dreamed that a youngster could be so difficult to deal with. Just due to a word, he was caught.

“Head judge, according to the God Institute’s laws, if a plaintiff meets unjust circumstances while defending themself, in order to avoid any miscarriage of justice, they have the right to ask for a higher level trial. This old fellow has determined that I’m guilty before the trial has even begun. If he does not apologize to me, I will immediately demand a change in the trial. I ask that the head judge help me apply for this.” Long Chen cupped his fists toward the head judge.

The head judge’s expression didn’t change, but there was a trace of admiration in his eyes. He also hadn’t expected Long Chen to be so tough. There were several times that he wanted to laugh, but he managed to endure it.

On the other hand, the other two wore extremely ugly expressions, especially the one whose mouth had ended up catching himself. He wanted to crush Long Chen in his palm.

However, Long Chen was familiar with the academy’s laws, and he was truly correct. According to those laws, he had the right to switch trials.

There was only one person higher than them in the Discipline Institute. It was not the institute head; it was the dean.

If this matter disturbed the dean, the consequences would be unimaginable. Hence, the elder thickened his face, stood, and bowed ever so slightly to Long Chen. “I was wrong. Due to your words offending the dean that I respect most in my heart, I said some regrettable words. I apologize.”

Mu Qingyun, Luo Bing, Luo Ning, and the other disciples of the Unfettered Alliance were dumbstruck, unable to believe what they were seeing.

Long Chen had actually forced that high and lofty magistrate to bow and apologize to him? Had the world gone mad, or had they?

“Ah, fine, since you’re so sincere, I won’t quibble with you.” Long Chen waved his hand like a magnanimous person who wouldn’t quibble with a petty little person. He then returned to his own seat.

Everyone was staring at him. They didn’t recall a single case in history where a first grade trial had forced a magistrate to bow and apologize to the plaintiff.

After the elder finished his bow, he stood straight once more. His face instantly became harsh. Like a completely different person, he shouted, “Long Chen, you insulted the dean. How do you explain that?”
