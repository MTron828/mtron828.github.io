Chapter 3595

The people that Guo Ran had named were all well-known geniuses within the Heavenly Dragon Divine Armor College. Although their fame didn’t reach the level of the Four Heavenly Dragon Heroes, they were so famous that almost every disciple recognized them.

They were Wang Zixu’s left and right hands. For Guo Ran to shout their names at this time, was he planning on completely eradicating Wang Zixu’s faction?

“Guo Ran, what do you think you’re doing? As soon as you become proxy dean, are you going to abuse your position for personal reasons and wipe out anyone who opposes you? Are you trying to become the tyrant of the Heavenly Dragon Divine Armor College?” shouted an Assembly Elder.

Guo Ran coldly snorted, “If I was abusing my position, I’d have directly dragged out Xie Liuer and Leng Hui. Other than Wang Zixu, I hate them the most.”

Xie Liuer and Leng Hui turned pale. They understood that they had bullied Guo Ran too hard previously. Now, Guo Ran had a grudge against them.

“However, the path of cultivation is not one of kindness. There are only limited cultivation resources, and naturally everyone fights for them. In this fight, the winners are kings, and the losers have no right to complain. Although they suppressed and targeted me, they did it openly and only against me. Although I hate them, I have no reason to kill them. But the people that I named just now, they are all accomplices to evil. During my time here, they’ve done so many unconscionable acts with Wang Zixu. Every single one of them has the blood of other disciples on their hands. They thought that they would be able to commit atrocities because they were with Wang Zixu. Let me tell all of you, you are now reaping the seeds that you planted. Today is the day of settling karma. Shouldn’t you hurry up and accept your deaths? What are you waiting for?” shouted Guo Ran.

People looked through the crowd at the people that had been named. All of them were quivering badly, their eyes full of terror.

Suddenly, those people knelt on the ground. One of them shouted, “Dean Guo Ran, we were controlled by Wang Zixu! We admit we did many bad things, and we know that our sins cannot be forgiven. But I hope you can give us a chance. Let us die on the battlefield. We are willing to be the vanguard and charge into the devil beast army. Let us do one final thing for the Heavenly Dragon Divine Armor College to repay the favor of raising us.” Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

Hearing that, everyone was moved. These people were all elites amongst elites. To kill them just like this was truly a pity.

If what they were saying was true, then they had repented and would use this kind of death to show their dignity. Quite a few people were nodding their heads inside. To know their wrongs and change, that was acceptable. After all, this was a special circumstance, and they couldn’t be inflexible. They needed to use whatever resources they could.

“A nice dream. In life, there are some bottom lines that people cannot touch. If they are touched, they must pay the price. There is no room for negotiation. Do you think establishing some merit will protect your lives? Is there really such a nice thing in this world?” snorted Guo Ran.

Hearing Guo Ran’s rejection, that person furiously shouted, “In life, who commits no wrongs? We trusted Wang Zixu, and that was the only reason we were drawn off of the correct path. Can it be that as proxy dean, you won’t give anyone any chances? Have you never made any mistakes?!”

Guo Ran disdainfully said, “That was due to your own idiocy. You wanted to follow Wang Zixu? In other words, you’re pushing all the responsibility onto a dead person. That in itself is the conduct of a coward. Do you lack a brain? Are your eyes blind? You simply listened to Wang Zixu’s orders, is that so? Then what is the point of your head? I am from the Dragonblood Legion, and even my boss, the highest commander of the Dragonblood Legion, has told us, ‘If one day I go astray and massacre the innocent, if you are powerless to convince me to return, then do not hesitate. Take advantage of while I still trust you to stab me in the back and kill me. Do not feel any guilt in your hearts. Do not feel bad. If you really are unwilling to part, then you can also die alongside me. In the next life, we can once more be brothers.’”

These words moved everyone present. Even the calm dean was astonished. Everyone looked at Long Chen.

A peerless expert was capable of saying such words? It was truly shocking. Wasn’t it said that all true experts had absolute confidence in themselves? How could they have doubts about themselves?

“You are you, but we are us! The college raised us, spending endless blood and sweat. Could it be that the academy is going to kill us just like that? Does the college not know how to be pragmatic? If we die on the battlefield, we can lessen the casualties of the Heavenly Dragon Divine Armor College! We don’t want to use merit on the battlefield to make amends. We just want to use the final light of our lives to repay the college! Why is that unacceptable?!” shouted that man emotionally.

Now, everyone felt caught in a difficult position. These heavenly geniuses had harmed their own sect. It didn’t matter what the reason was, it was unforgivable.

However, killing them like this really was a pity. Furthermore, for them to want to repay the college in their last moments was correct. When people were about to die, they could do something good first. Quite a few people wanted to plead for mercy for them as well.

“The main thing is that if you do go to the battlefield, will you become turncoats at the last moment?”

At this moment, Long Chen, who had been quiet all this time, finally spoke, causing everyone to jump with his words.

“You… you… you’re spouting nonsense, slandering people! How could we do something so shameless?!” shouted that person in shock and fury.

Suddenly, he let out a startled cry. He was dragged over by an invisible force and landed on the martial stage.

“AHH!” He screamed as flames enveloped his body. Those flames weren’t burning him, and yet his screams never stopped. It was as if he was enduring unimaginable pain.

“This move of mine is called the Heavenly Flame Soul Refining Heart Questioning Art. No one can lie under the effect of this technique. Do your best,” said Long Chen indifferently. He then glanced at Guo Ran.

Guo Ran was first startled, but then understood that Long Chen wanted him to ask the questions. He loudly demanded, “What is your name?”

“Gu Yi!” that screaming disciple hastily answered.

Curiously, after he answered the question, he stopped convulsing, as if the pain had vanished.

“Who is your father?”

“Who is your mother?”

“How many wives does your father have? Which one looks the most beautiful? Which one has the best figure? Aiya!”

Guo Ran’s questions ended up resulting in Long Chen kicking him. Long Chen now had the urge to beat him. What kind of time was it? Millions of eyes were on him, so what was he asking such a thing for?

“Boss, I was first asking some questions that everyone knows the answer to! That way, it proves that he can’t lie and proves that your Heavenly Flame Soul Refining Heart Questioning Art is effective!” claimed Guo Ran, feeling aggrieved.

Long Chen was speechless. This fellow was the epitome of soft mud not being able to turn into a wall. Xue Yifan actually wanted to turn him into a hero, but this fellow simply didn’t have the making for such a thing. He couldn’t even ask a few questions before getting sidetracked.

Xue Yifan’s expression was also rather odd. It seemed that he wanted to smile, but at this solemn time, he couldn’t. Otherwise, he wouldn’t be able to maintain the situation.

When Guo Ran stopped asking questions, Gu Yi began convulsing and screaming again. He suddenly shouted, “Please, kill me! I can’t endure it any longer! I’ll tell you anything, anything you want! I’m a mole that the Luo clan nurtured! It’s not just me in the college, there are many others as well!”

“What?!”

These words caused a huge clamor amongst the crowd. People stared at Gu Yi in disbelief.
