Chapter 3872 So Simple?

BOOM!

When this golden liquid entered Long Chen’s body, his body shook intensely. Divine light appeared around him. It was like he was plated in golden powder.

After that, the earth split open and endless primal chaos qi erupted. This eruption of primal chaos qi shook the heavens.

At this moment, an absolutely enormous dragon mark appeared in the nine heavens. It was millions and millions of miles wide, forming a giant totem illuminating the entire world. It was possible to see it from every corner of the three thousand worlds.

“Primal chaos source, dragon vein land?”

When Mo Nian saw that giant dragon totem as well as the terrain of the surroundings, he suddenly realized something.

A so-called dragon vein was like a meridian that carried the world’s qi flow. It was what oversaw the lifeline of the world.

When the earth collapsed and primal chaos qi gushed out, the entire three thousand worlds shook. Dragon might radiated in every direction. A sacred and holy aura then spread throughout the three thousand worlds.

“Damn, so much primal chaos qi! It’s even denser than where we went! I have to condense a Heavenly Dao Crown!” Guo Ran cried out excitedly.

“Guo Ran, don’t mess up the proper sequence! Absorb the dragon king essence blood first before condensing a Heavenly Dao Crown!” shouted Xia Chen.

With that reminder, Guo Ran changed targets, flying toward a golden dragon king.

“What the fuck? You’re all going and I’m stuck here? I have to absorb primal chaos qi too!” shouted Mo Nian unhappily.

“Don’t worry, I’ll be done soon. Just look after boss, and I’ll look after you in a bit!” Guo Ran didn’t even look back.

As time passed, more and more Dragonblood warriors arrived. They were all incredibly excited to see Long Chen. However, they had no time to talk. Mo Nian had to keep an eye on the surroundings as he absorbed the primal chaos qi. At the same time, he also had to keep handing out the true dragon runes to the newly arriving Dragonblood warriors.

As for Long Chen, he was fully in a meditative state. He was wrapped in golden divine radiance and was like a statue. Even his aura was isolated from the outside world.

Within the divine radiance, Long Chen sensed one drop after another of golden dragon blood entering his body slowly. His almost-dry meridians were nourished by this dragon blood and began to grow plump again.

Every drop of dragon blood brought with it supreme divine might. With every drop of dragon blood, powerful fluctuations would cause sharp pain throughout his body. Even cracks started to appear on his meridians.

Long Chen blessed his fortune that the dragon expert had tirelessly arranged things for him to strengthen his meridians. Otherwise, a single drop of this blood would have caused his old meridians to crumble. There would be no way to absorb it.

Right now, although there was a stinging pain in his meridians, it was still within his tolerance. As one drop after another entered his body, his meridians transformed. They became golden and incomparably tough.

“What power!”

Long Chen sensed every drop strengthening him. It was like a single drop contained the power of a volcano.

“Just this is powerful? We’ve just started. You will soon understand what the strongest bloodline of the nine heavens and ten lands is,” said the dragon expert disdainfully. That disdain contained immense pride.

“Senior, can we go faster? I’m afraid of others coming,” said Long Chen. He knew that everything was under the control of the dragon expert, but at this rate, many enemies might arrive soon.

The disturbance here was truly enormous. All the experts of the three thousand worlds were probably rushing over with all their power right now. He needed to go faster.

“It is impossible. My essence blood contains a supreme will and power. That is the result of tens of thousands of years of my cultivation, the result of experiencing countless tribulations and dangers. Although there’s no problem for you in terms of the will, in terms of your physical body, you are still human. You are a far cry from my dragon race. In the end, you’ve only lived a few years. As for myself, I had tens of thousands of years to accumulate the experiences that produced this scale. Any faster and your meridians will still shatter. Other than that, any faster and the dragon blood will not properly permeate through every inch of your body. Then there will be imperfections. If that happens, you will not be able to use my bloodline power and will be unable to unleash my innate divine abilities. With my bloodline, you must reach my requirements. Otherwise, if you were beaten by others, I would lose face. That is unacceptable,” said the dragon expert.

Long Chen’s heart shook. This dragon expert’s essence blood was even stronger than he had imagined. His meridians were already so tough, but there would still be a danger of them exploding if the rate of this absorption was increased? Just how powerful was the dragon race?

BOOM!

Suddenly, a figure flew off of the head of a dragon. Surging Blood Qi power came out of him in waves, causing huge ripples in space.

“Hahaha!”

This person was Guo Ran. He laughed arrogantly.

“I, Guo Ran, have finally condensed a Heavenly Dao Crown! I will sweep through the world unrivaled!”

Golden scales covered Guo Ran’s body like golden battle armor, and they had countless dragon marks flowing within them. It looked like there was a dragon moving within his scales.

Most shocking of all, there was a halo of light behind Guo Ran’s head. It was like a crown, making him appear holy and sacred, an existence that couldn’t be blasphemed.Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

“What the fuck?! It was that simple?!” Mo Nian looked at Guo Ran in disbelief.

Wasn’t it said that condensing a Heavenly Dao Crown required ten to fifteen days at least? It had only just been a few hours! How did Guo Ran do this?

What Mo Nian didn’t know was that Guo Ran’s talent was incredibly lacking. Everything he had right now was essentially thanks to Long Chen’s efforts building him up.

The so-called Dao of the Heavens were fair. If something had a drawback, it also had an advantage. Guo Ran was so incredibly weak that even the heavens felt pity for him. Amongst all the lifeforms in the three thousand worlds, the weakest existence in this realm was Guo Ran.

Thus, in order to make it up to him, the heavens lowered the difficulty of all advancements. For heavenly geniuses with greater talent, condensing a Heavenly Dao Crown was much more difficult. This was the fairness of the Heavenly Daos.

Mo Nian didn’t know about these profundities. Seeing Guo Ran condense a golden dragon battle armor and a Heavenly Dao Crown in just a few hours, he was completely dumbfounded.

“Leave this place to me! You can go absorb the primal chaos qi!” Guo Ran patted his chest confidently. He then took the remaining true dragon runes from Mo Nian’s hands.

Mo Nian didn’t argue. The primal chaos qi here was incredibly dense, and it was the optimal time to condense a Heavenly Dao Crown. He couldn’t miss it. After that, he flew into the sky, and his manifestation burst into existence. The giant palace rumbled as he absorbed this primal chaos qi.

Mo Nian had just settled into this cultivation state when lifeforms of other races appeared. Clearly, they had been drawn over by the disturbance.

“Long Chen!”

Amongst these lifeforms, one of them spotted Long Chen on the scale and immediately erupted with killing intent. Without a second word, he charged at Long Chen.
