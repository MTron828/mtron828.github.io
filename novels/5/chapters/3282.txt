Chapter 3271 Ominous Omen

That black crystal was the underworld ghost seed. It was the seed that had germinated within Jiang Baihe’s body.

Long Chen wanted to grab and study it. He wanted to know the secrets of the Ghost Dao. But when he went to grab it, an intense sensation of danger filled his entire body. He instinctively gave up on grabbing it and swung his saber.

The crystal exploded. But a strange black figure appeared within it.

Lei Linger then slashed her sword through that figure, destroying it. That lifeform’s final roar rang out through the air.

“You’ve been infected by the Ghost Dao’s karma! It won’t be long before you become the next underworld ghost seed!”

BOOM!

With a one-handed seal, Lei Linger caused lightning to ravage this space, instantly purifying this black qi.

The lightning of a heavenly tribulation was a supreme Yang force, and it countered all evil and demonic forms of energy. Thus, while this lifeform of the Ghost Dao could struggle against Long Chen, it was completely unable to stop Lei Linger’s attacks.

“Tch, what nonsense. You even have to scare me as you die. Fortunately, boss San’s guts aren’t small,” sneered Long Chen.

After purifying the black qi, Lei Linger returned to Long Chen’s arm. Long Chen then waved his hand, and the pill furnace flew back to him. The bone saber was also sent to the primal chaos space.

The battle had ended. But the Yuhua Palace’s experts were still shaking. The youngsters in particular were horrified. They had been frightened by Jiang Baihe’s final form. Looking at it was enough to make their souls want to flee. They couldn’t summon the courage to fight it.

Legend was that every time the Ghost Dao invaded the immortal world, endless calamities followed. This lifeform’s appearance was so frightening that it naturally drew out the fear deep in people’s hearts. That could easily cause a heart-devil.

As a result of this, the few images of the lifeforms of the Ghost Dao were kept secret and not publicly disseminated. 

Now that they saw one of these lifeforms in person, the seniors who had read about them felt cold. 

Bai Shishi couldn’t help sighing when she saw those terrified expressions. In comparison, Long Chen was a true expert. He didn’t have such fear.

Climbing on top of the Ghost Ship had been a tempering experience for her. Although she also felt some fear toward Jiang Baihe’s appearance, it wasn’t enough to make her lose her courage.

Even Bai Xiaole wasn’t in a state as bad as the Yuhua Palace’s disciples. It could be seen that people’s guts were trained through tempering.

Moreover, Qin Feng and Qi Yu’s expressions were both calm as if nothing had happened. The two of them knew that Long Chen definitely wouldn’t lose. They had absolute confidence in him.

At this moment, the scepter flew into the patriarch’s hand. His expression was a bit ugly. He didn’t know what secret technique this lifeform had used, but the King item was now infected with death qi.

Perhaps it was part of the secret technique that had allowed the lifeform to control this King item, forcing it to obey his will and detonate upon his command.

The detonation of the scepter had been prevented by Long Chen, but this King item was still damaged. It would take a huge amount of time and resources for it to recover.

However, in any case, the golden scepter had been returned. That was already something fortuitous.

“It’s all thanks to dean Long’s supreme might and wisdom. You managed to see through the underworld ghost seed. Otherwise, once he grew up, my Yuhua Palace would be destroyed by him. The Yuhua Palace will remember this favor,” said the patriarch, putting away the scepter, his expression a bit complicated.

Long Chen had killed Jiang Baihe, and the patriarch actually had to thank him. Even after living countless years, he felt extremely embarrassed by this.

Ultimately, he still retained his rationality. He knew that if Long Chen hadn’t come, Jiang Baihe’s identity as an underworld ghost seed wouldn’t have been exposed.

Once he grew up, he would definitely gain control over the Yuhua Palace. At that time, the Yuhua Palace might very likely become a stronghold for the Ghost Dao’s invasion to the immortal world. At that time, the Yuhua Palace would no longer exist.

Hence, although the patriarch found it a bit hard to accept, he still had to thank Long Chen. Everyone within the Yuhua Palace had to thank him.

“No need for thanks. My goal in coming here was to find justice for my brother. It was all a coincidence. I’ve long since gotten used to bad luck. As for whether others thank me or hate me, I don’t really mind. I can permit other people to have different views of me, and I can respect every person’s opinion. Of course, the condition for that is that they don’t provoke me or my brothers. Green rivers don’t change, clear water flows long; hopefully if we meet again, we can drink together happily, not viewing each other with hostility. Goodbye.” Long Chen cupped his fists toward the patriarch and turned away.

Bai Shishi, Bai Xiaole, and Xu Zixiong immediately followed. Qin Feng then patted Qi Yu’s shoulder and smiled.

“Good brother. Boss didn’t say anything to you because he’s worried that you would abandon your lover. Remember, the Dragonblood warriors are brothers for life. If you need anything, just send us a word. No matter how far apart we are, we’ll immediately come. Take care of yourself, brother.” Qin Feng then started walking away with Long Chen and the others. Qi Yu watched as they left. He then looked toward Yu Xuan and sighed.

“Now do you understand why the karmic luck divine pillar would crack? Long Chen not only possesses immense power, but he even possesses a King item pill furnace. If he had unleashed this power in the Yuhua Palace, then a clash of King items would have destroyed the sect. There’s even that bone saber, which isn’t a King item but is on the same level. If I were to take action, at most I would be able to beat him but not kill him. At that time, the only survivors from the Yuhua Palace would be us, two old fellows. Now do you think that I was wrong to stop you?” said the patriarch lightly as he watched Long Chen and the others leave.

“Disciple admits his wrongs.” Jiang Weizhong was pale. It looked as if he had aged countless years, and his expression was miserable. But there was also overwhelming hatred in his eyes.

Even he himself wasn’t sure whether he should hate Long Chen or himself. He had indulged Jiang Baihe too much. Perhaps it was precisely due to this that an evil flame within him was stoked to the point that an underworld ghost seed set its sights on him.

If he had been more strict with Jiang Baihe, perhaps none of this would have happened. However, in this world, there were not so many ifs or buts, nor was there any medicine for regret.

“Starting today, go into seclusion and reflect on yourself. Qing He will temporarily take over the position of palace master,” said the patriarch.

Jiang Weizhong’s position was stripped from him just like that. Although there was a hint of unwillingness in his eyes, he nodded. “Disciple understands.”

The patriarch then nodded as well. To another Elder, he said, “Disseminate the news of an underworld ghost seed appearing in the Yuhua Palace. All sects should raise their guard. Sigh, perhaps the immortal world’s era of peace will end with our generation.”

The patriarch led everyone back to the Yuhua Palace. Everyone was gone, leaving behind a ruined battlefield. As a gust of evil wind blew by, the whistle of sand blowing in the air sounded like the cries of ghosts. No one knew whether or not this was an ominous omen to far more terrible things.
