Chapter 3524

Zhao Mingxuan was the one who spoke so disdainfully. He appeared in the air and looked down on Long Chen.

“I’ve found you displeasing from the start. Now, I finally have a reason to kill you.”

Clearly, he didn’t care what kind of grievance there was between Long Chen and the Soaring Dragon Company. He didn’t care who was right and who was wrong. Even if the Soaring Dragon Company was framing Long Chen, it didn’t matter. He just needed an excuse. The cultivation world was just that rough and cruel.

“It just so happens that I also find you displeasing. The day you attack me is the day your head falls to the ground,” said Long Chen indifferently.

Zhao Mingxuan was definitely the one that Long Chen detested the most out of all of them. It was because he had dragged Long Chen’s father and mother into their argument. If it weren’t for Yu Qingxuan being present at the time, Long Chen would have killed him regardless of the rules.

Now, this hateful fellow had actually jumped out of his own accord. Long Chen also decided to definitely kill him. It just so happened that he needed an opportunity.

“Hopefully, brother Mingxuan can give me face and leave him to me. I hate him far more than you, don’t you think?” Wu Yang also stepped forward.

“Sorry, I really can’t concede when it comes to this. How about after I kill him, I split his corpse in half for you?” said Zhao Mingxuan with a smile.

“What use is half? Am I going to use it for stew? Whatever. But brother Mingxuan, I won’t let him off. At that time, whoever kills him will get the whole thing!” said Wu Yang, laughing.

Yu Qingxuan’s expression sank. These people were going too far. They were absolutely despicable, treating Long Chen as prey.

Other than Wu Yang and Zhao Mingxuan, all the others besides Feng Xiang came out. They all glared at Long Chen coldly, not bothering to conceal their killing intent in the slightest.

Yu Qingxuan was about to speak when Long Chen said, “You don’t need to persuade them. They won’t listen. I’m going to go into seclusion for a few days to sharpen my saber. Once the Heavenly Flame World opens, I will definitely slaughter all these ignorant animals to scare off the foolish monkeys.”

Long Chen waved goodbye to Yu Qingxuan. It was not good for him to stay by her side right now.

One reason was because people were constantly provoking him, making her angry. Many of them might even say that he was getting close to Yu Qingxuan for other motives.

He didn’t want to bring Yu Qingxuan any trouble, not even the tiniest bit. He didn’t want to draw her into his battle. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Yu Qingxuan had told him that the Heavenly Flame World would descend around a month from now. Hence, he wanted to use this time to raise his cultivation base.

Previously, he hadn’t dared to increase his realm too quickly. But now he had the assistance of the Wine God Palace’s wine. When the power of the wine and pills was merged, he wouldn’t need to have so many misgivings.

“Alright. I’ll be staying temporarily at the city lord mansion. If you need anything, remember to come find me. I will definitely help you,” implored Yu Qingxuan.

Long Chen nodded. He then smiled at Yu Qingxuan and walked off to the city’s western part. That was where the Huayun Trading Company’s branch was.

Countless people smiled sinisterly at Long Chen as he walked away. It seemed that they all viewed him as prey. Some people even directly challenged him to life-and-death battles, but Long Chen ignored them.

His silence only caused people to grow more arrogant. They even began to hurl verbal abuses at him.

Long Chen couldn’t help frowning. Without being aware of it, his fists were already clenched tightly beneath his sleeves. Killing intent brewed within his heart.

However, in the end, he managed to endure. Attacking right now wouldn’t resolve any problems. Even if he killed a few people, it would only expose his own power. It wasn’t worth it.

Furthermore, if he did, he would only be falling for the Soaring Dragon Company’s trap. Tch, these suicidal fools wanted to die so badly. Then Boss Long San would make sure that their wish was achieved.

He originally didn’t want to fight with people, but some people always wanted to climb over his body. Since they didn’t know respect, they couldn’t blame him for being merciless.

After a while, Long Chen found the Huayun Trading Company. In order to find some peace, he was preparing to have the Huayun Trading Company find a place for him to enter seclusion.

What he hadn’t expected was for someone from the city lord mansion to come invite him, saying that they wished to offer him a training room for his seclusion.

That startled Long Chen. Was the city lord mansion not the Feng family’s? What was going on? But in the end, Long Chen still refused. Ignoring whatever intention the city lord mansion had, he didn’t want to disturb Yu Qingxuan during this time.

Yu Qingxuan had also said that this fight for the Heavenly Flame Spirits would be fierce, so everyone was in seclusion to enter their peak conditions.

Once the Heavenly Flame World descended, countless monsters that had been lying in the dark would appear.

The flame element heavenly geniuses of the various races would appear. They couldn’t possibly let go of this chance that only appeared once every thirty-six thousand years. Even the dark world’s experts would appear.

The various monsters of the six Daos would appear. Some heavenly geniuses even sealed themselves for thousands of years just to wait for this opening of the Heavenly Flame World.

Even with Yu Qingxuan’s special status, even if she was guarded by two terrifying experts, she still had to be cautious. The dark world’s experts viewed the immortal world’s lifeforms as enemies. They wouldn’t care about status.

Thus, this time, there would definitely be a storm of blood. The Heavenly Flame World would become a ruthless fighting ring. It was unknown how many people would be leaving their dead bodies inside for eternity, never capable of leaving.

However, for the Heavenly Flame Spirits, those people were willing to throw their lives away. The Heavenly Flame Spirits could completely change a person’s fate. Cultivators weren’t afraid of dying, but they were afraid of being surpassed by others.

Thus, even if the Soaring Dragon Company hadn’t come this time, Long Chen and Yu Qingxuan would still have to go into seclusion to prepare for the Heavenly Flame World.

It was simply that this incident caused the two of them to split up and go into seclusion.

Having denied the city lord mansion’s invitation, Long Chen went into seclusion in the Huayun Trading Company. This made him feel a bit more at peace.

…

Within the city lord mansion, the city lord was looking out at the scenery outside the window. He was silent.

As for his son, Feng Xiang, he was quietly standing behind him. He had waited half an incense stick’s worth of time, but his father had not said anything.

“Father. Did you need me for something?” Feng Xiang asked.

“I told you to go invite Long Chen. Did you go?” said the city lord indifferently, not even looking back.

“I sent someone to invite him, but he didn’t come,” answered Feng Xiang.

“I told you to go, not to send others to go. Xiang-er. You really disappoint me.” The city lord sighed.

“Father, I don’t understand. Why do you care so much about that little fellow? In order to accomplish your mission, do you know how Wu Yang and Zhao Mingxuan look at me now? I no longer have the slightest face in front of them. While they are targeting Long Chen, you want me to personally go to Long Chen’s door and invite him? How am I supposed to live afterward?” Feng Xiang’s expression was a bit unsightly. He felt very resentful inside.

“Fine. You really are beyond cure.”

The city lord finally turned to look at Feng Xiang and shook his head.

“Pass down my orders! Starting today, Feng Ling is the future city lord!”

Upon hearing this, Feng Xiang’s expression became exceedingly ugly. He was enraged.

“Why are you doing this?!”

Suddenly, the city lord’s hand caught Feng Xiang’s throat, and a sharp killing intent instantly enveloped Feng Xiang.
