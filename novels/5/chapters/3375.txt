Chapter 3364 World Extermination Flame Lotus

Tuo Ming’s subordinates were quite obedient. Following Long Chen’s orders, they stopped attacking the barrier. They knew that once Long Chen’s attack fell, the barrier would definitely crumble.

An army of millions retreated and was now gathered together, afraid of being affected by Long Chen’s attack. They were just waiting for the barrier to be broken and they would charge forward.

As for the experts in black armor, seeing the giant lotus that filled the heavens, they despaired. There was no way that the formation could block it.

Leng Yueyan was fighting a bloody battle with Tuo Ming, so she had no time to consider other things. She was doing her absolute best to stall for time. Ming Cangyue was only a bit off from breaking through.

She was gambling with Tuo Ming right now. Either she and Ming Cangyue died together, or Ming Cangyue would break through before the city was broken into, and they could instantly reverse the tides.

In a battle like this, all her attention had to be on her opponent. However, when she heard the Nirvana Scripture, she faltered, practically not daring to believe her ears. The distraction almost caused her to be seriously injured.

As for Tuo Ming, he was startled and stopped pressing the attack. He then looked at Long Chen. Seeing that giant flame lotus as well as his sinister smile, his expression changed.

He could see that Long Chen’s target was not the barrier but his subordinates! His figure swayed, but just as he moved, Leng Yueyan’s bone sword hacked down. She unleashed consecutive blows, forcing him back in a hurry.

Originally, the two were somewhat evenly matched. But since Leng Yueyan knew that Long Chen had come to help, she definitely wouldn’t let Tuo Ming pass. She immediately started launching risky attacks.

“Kill him! He’s a traitor!” shouted Tuo Ming after failing to break free of her blockade several times.

“You’re the spy! All of you are spies!”

Long Chen suddenly sent the flame lotus smashing toward the dumbfounded red-armored army.

Tuo Ming’s warning came too late. By the time those people reacted, the World Extermination Flame Lotus had fallen right into their midst. It exploded right in the middle of them.

BOOM!

The lotus had nine petals and eighty-one star-like flame spheres on the petals. They all exploded at the same time, and a wave of fire enveloped the red army. A giant mushroom cloud exploded.

There was no flying sand or rubble. The terrifying heat simply incinerated everything. A sea of lava appeared on the ground, and millions of experts were turned to ash after this attack.

However, two wretched figures suddenly crawled out of the sea of lava. Both of them were badly charred and were no longer even human-shaped. They were alive, but with only half their lives.

“You dare to come out? Do you think your Boss Long San is a vegetarian?”

These two were Earth tier Immortal Kings. Relying on their immense power, they managed to just barely keep their lives. But as soon as they appeared, Long Chen shot toward them, slashing them with his saber one blow each, cutting them like radishes. The entire army was now annihilated.

Even mighty Earth tier Immortal Kings were reduced to powerless existences and killed just like that. The experts inside the city were stunned.

“Who are you?!” Tuo Ming roared furiously. He was blocked by Leng Yueyan and unable to get back. So, he could only watch as the army that he had bitterly raised was destroyed. He was infuriated.

“I am who I am, Boss Long San. I also have another status. I am the husband of that peerlessly beautiful woman opposing you.” Long Chen looked down arrogantly at Tuo Ming.

Just then, a majestic aura soared out of the city. Tuo Ming furiously roared, “You dare to ruin this! Just wait, I won’t let any of you off!”

Tuo Ming then stamped on the air and shot away like a bolt of lightning.

After that, Leng Yueyan appeared in front of Long Chen. Her beautiful face was frosty. However, there was a burning light in her eyes that was so hot it seemed as if it could melt someone.

Long Chen smiled. “Long time no see-”

A sharp pain pierced Long Chen’s shoulder. Leng Yueyan had actually stabbed him. Long Chen was shocked and enraged, but before he could do anything, Leng Yueyan grabbed his neck with her other hand and kissed him tightly.

Although it was incredibly painful when the bone sword stabbed into his body, it very quickly felt as if Long Chen was immersed in sunlight. The bone blade had a magical energy that made him grow more accustomed to this world. He was no longer expelled by it.

Long Chen realized that Leng Yueyan was using her divine energy to get him accustomed to the laws of the Netherworld.

He relaxed. Just as he prepared to enjoy Leng Yueyan’s kiss, she pulled away.

“I should stab you a few more times. You actually resisted.” Leng Yueyan looked at Long Chen with what seemed to be delight and anger.

Long Chen felt a chill, and a bad feeling rose in his heart. The fiery passion from seeing Leng Yueyan dimmed. This woman was truly fickle.

“It was nothing more than a bodily reaction. Instinct. I-” Long Chen helplessly explained, only for Leng Yueyan to tightly hug him.

“Fool, it’s because I hate you that I make things hard on you,” muttered Leng Yueyan as she leaned her head against his chest.

“Hate me? Why?” Long Chen tightly held Leng Yueyan. Smelling her specific fragrance, he didn’t know how he had offended her.

“Because of you, we’ve been worried sick every single day. Tell me, don’t you think that I should hate you?” said Leng Yueyan.Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

Long Chen’s heart warmed. In the final battle of the Martial Heaven Continent, Leng Yueyan and Ming Cangyue had come to help them from across worlds.

However, at that time, Long Chen was in the middle of making a breakthrough. By the time he woke up, Leng Yueyan and Ming Cangyue had exhausted all their energy due to being rejected by the laws of the Martial Heaven Continent and had been forced to return to the Netherworld.

The two of them were not aware of what happened afterward. Furthermore, at that time, the Martial Heaven Continent already seemed doomed. They had no idea whether or not Long Chen had survived, so they had been constantly worried about him.

Long Chen tightly held her, softly saying, “You should hate me. I made you worry.”

If the positions were switched, and he knew Leng Yueyan and Ming Cangyue were in trouble while he was suddenly sent into a different world from them, he would definitely be driven mad. He could understand that hate. Let alone being stabbed once, even being turned into a pincushion would be acceptable if he could relieve her pain.

“You know how to talk at least. At that time, I swore that I would stab you for every day you made me wait. But since you understand, I’ll settle for just once. However, as for whether Cangyue will settle for that, it’ll be up to your own fortune.” Leng Yueyan looked at Long Chen and smiled. It was like a flower blooming. But Long Chen’s heart sank. He had no idea how Ming Cangyue would ‘greet’ him.

Just as Long Chen was worried about the possibilities, Leng Yueyan held his hand and slowly walked into the ancient city with him.
