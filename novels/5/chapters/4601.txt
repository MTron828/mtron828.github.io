Chapter 4590 Purgatory Three Flower Pupil vs. Emperor Blood Silk Net

The image of three flowers appeared in the void, and at the center of it was the Emperor Blood Silk Net.

“Do you not want your life any longer?!” The Earth Cauldron cried out in shock to see Long Chen use the Three Flower Pupils.

Sharp pain struck Long Chen’s eye, and it felt like it was breaking. Blood then flowed down the corner of his eye.

“The Emperor Blood Silkworm is from the same race as the Nether Emperor, and everyone from his bloodline is capable of controlling the laws of the Netherworld. What are you trying to do?!” exclaimed the Earth Cauldron.

“I’m going to drag it into the primal chaos space! I want this treasure!” declared Long Chen through gritted teeth. Even as excruciating pain wracked his eye and it felt like it would break apart, Long Chen persevered.

The three flowers in his eyes continued to spin, synchronizing with the three flowers in the void that locked onto the Emperor Blood Silk Net, causing it to rotate with them. However, a quiver from the Emperor Blood Silk Net disrupted the synchronization, rendering the three flowers in the void unable to rotate it any further.

“You’re crazy! This is impossible! You don’t understand what kind of existence the Nether Emperor is! You are nothing more than an ant in front of him!” shouted the Earth Cauldron.

Perhaps Long Chen didn’t understand how great the Nether Emperor was, but the Earth Cauldron did. The vast gulf between them was indescribable.

“The only trump card you have right now that can fight it is the golden lotus seed. Try to summon it!” suggested the Earth Cauldron with a hint of panic.

“No, I want to try this!”

“You...!”

The void cracked and creaked as three black flowers slowly spun in Long Chen’s left eye. Seeing this scene, Netherdragon Tianzhao was stunned.

Perhaps others didn’t understand what the Emperor Blood Silk Net represented, but Netherdragon Tianzhao was profoundly aware of it. It was the divine artifact that the Nether Emperor had personally bestowed upon him, with strict instructions not to utilize it until the appearance of the Earth Cauldron.

The Emperor Blood Silk Net harbored the blood and will of the Nether Emperor himself. Even for Netherdragon Tianzhao, merely carrying it around was enough to make his soul tremble. Yet now, Long Chen was forcefully subduing and binding it to his will.

The three flowers in the void clashed intensely with the Emperor Blood Silk Net, their energies intertwining in a fierce confrontation. While the physical state of the net remained unchanged, the sheer power they unleashed caused the very fabric of heaven and earth to change color.

The spectators in the distance didn’t know what the Emperor Blood Silk Net was, but they could tell it was something extremely terrifying. Hence, their hearts trembled as they saw Long Chen use pupil art with his left eye to trap the Emperor Blood Silk Net in midair.

When Long Chen activated his Purgatory Eye, dark energy seemed to stir and follow the movement of the three flowers in the void.

The Earth Cauldron was shocked. “This energy, could it be...?”

Netherdragon Tianzhao was also stunned speechless. Although he didn’t understand pupil arts, seeing the Emperor Blood Silk Net start to spin with the three flowers, he had a bad feeling.

The next moment, the dragon spear in his hand transformed into a streak of black light shooting toward Long Chen. He knew he had to interrupt Long Chen’s pupil art. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

BOOM!

From within an explosion of flames, a red-robed maiden appeared and struck the dragon spear. Although she was unable to stop it, she diverted its direction, and it flew by Long Chen.

Netherdragon Tianzhao waved his hand, causing the dragon spear to fly in a strange arc and return to his hand. He once more shot at Long Chen.

“Don’t even think about going over with me here! World Extermination Flame Lotus!” Huo Linger cried out, forming hand seals. A multicolored flame lotus then shot toward Netherdragon Tianzhao.

BOOM!

With another explosive sound, Netherdragon Tianzhao’s spear pierced through the flame lotus. A resounding dragon cry reverberated, and flames erupted. Huo Linger was evidently unable to halt Netherdragon Tianzhao's advance.

Despite the waning brilliance of Netherdragon Tianzhao’s Nether Emperor light, it had yet to fully vanish. Huo Linger’s power paled in comparison to Lei Linger’s, so she couldn’t resist the Nether Emperor’s power. There was a large gulf between them.

“Raging Flame Prison!”

Seeing that her flame energy was ineffective against the Nether Emperor’s power, Huo Linger hastily formed more hand seals and summoned huge pillars of flame, trapping Netherdragon Tianzhao in a giant cage.

“A mantis trying to stop a chariot!”

Netherdragon Tianzhao roared, and his dragon spear smashed through the flame pillars one by one. These pillars of flame were formidable obstacles that others wouldn't dare to approach so recklessly. However, with the protection of the Nether Emperor's power, Netherdragon Tianzhao could easily disregard their fiery threats.

Whether it was the Ice Soul Divine Flame, the Moon Flame, or the Sun Flame, the Nether Emperor’s power blocked them all, rendering them ineffective. Huo Linger found herself completely suppressed in the face of such overwhelming force.

In a panic, Lei Linger wanted to go and support Huo Linger. With her Saint Lightning, she would have some ability to contend with the Nether Emperor’s power. However, Lei Linger was tied up and couldn't afford to split her focus. Huo Linger could only hold Netherdragon Tianzhao back as long as she could, but her power was ineffective against him. Hence, Netherdragon Tianzhao was steadily closing in on Long Chen.

BOOM!

Netherdragon Tianzhao finally shook off Huo Linger’s bindings and charged at Long Chen, his spear thrusting toward Long Chen. At this moment, Long Chen suddenly moved and turned his Purgatory Eye to Netherdragon Tianzhao.

When Long Chen’s eye locked onto him, Netherdragon Tianzhao’s hair stood on end, and his soul quivered. The space around him warped and twisted, causing the spear to veer past Long Chen’s shoulder. At the same time, he was shocked to find himself instantly transported thousands of miles away.

Meanwhile, the void rumbled with intensity. The three flowers in the void spun rapidly, exerting control over the Emperor Blood Silk Net, which now rotated in synchronization with them.

Panicked, Netherdragon Tianzhao let out a roar and charged through Huo Linger’s blockade once more to attack Long Chen.

“Scram!”

Long Chen delivered a powerful slap to Netherdragon Tianzhao’s face while using the Purgatory eyes. With an explosive sound, the slap sent Netherdragon Tianzhao flying through the air.

A gut-wrenching sound reverberated as the force of the slap shattered the protective divine light surrounding Netherdragon Tianzhao, causing severe damage to half of his face.

His Nether Emperor power had finally reached its limit. With Huo Linger’s power exhausting it, this slap was the final nail in the coffin.

If Long Chen pushed the attack, Netherdragon Tianzhao would be in deep shit. However, Long Chen was in no mood to do so and focused all of his power on the Emperor Blood Silk Net.

However, the slight moment of distraction caused it to cease spinning. When it halted, Long Chen’s heart sank.

This meant that all his previous efforts had been in vain. Furthermore, his Purgatory Eyes had been pushed to the limit already, so there was no way he could do this again.

His eye was in immense pain, as if red-hot metal was pressing against it. Blood was covering half of his face.

“Fuck, as long as I’m still alive, there will be another chance in the future. You can scram now!” Long Chen shouted. The rune on his left eye lit up, and the three flowers in the void exploded.

Their explosion caused a giant vortex to form. Like a gaping maw, it devoured the Emperor Blood Silk Net, so when the vortex vanished, so was the Emperor Blood Silk Net.

A sharp, searing pain shot through Long Chen's left eye as he lost half of his vision.

Long Chen’s fury finally exploded as he turned toward Netherdragon Tianzhao, his voice coming through clenched teeth.

“You insolent brat! You’ve lost me my treasure! I’ll skin you and rip out all your bones!”
