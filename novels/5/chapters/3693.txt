Chapter 3682

The Tea Divine School’s women instantly felt a chill run up their spines seeing Guo Ran and Xia Chen’s stares. It felt as if their gazes were seeing through their clothes.

Let alone the women, even the men had goosebumps rise all over their bodies. They all felt unnatural.

Qing Yu hastily said, “You… you’re twisting my words!”

No matter how thick his face was, there was no way he could strip naked in front of everyone. If that happened, their Tea Divine School would become a giant laughingstock.

“How am I twisting your words? Didn’t you say natural is better than artificial? If the Grand Dao is the pinnacle of simplicity, the simpler the better. Tea is the Dao, wine is the Dao, and people are the Dao. Something as natural as your body, why must you cover it up? Why adorn yourself in artificial clothes? That’s so troublesome. Why not make it simpler? If you feel that the Grand Dao is the pinnacle of simplicity, if you think that your principles are correct, if you think that the Tea Dao is greater than the Wine Dao, strip right now. My Wine God Palace will immediately accept our defeat,” said Long Chen indifferently.

What kind of joke was this? What kind of person was Long Chen? He was someone who had won the Dao discussion of the Nine Prefecture Convention. Qing Yu wanted to discuss the Dao with him? He wasn’t even qualified to carry his shoes. One opening in his words and Long Chen could play him to death.

“Exactly! Since you say that you want to be simple, why are you going to so much trouble? You’re clearly slapping yourself in the face!” Xia Chen couldn’t help interjecting.

“Strip. Why are you hesitating? If you strip, you win! Then your names will resound throughout the four seas. You aren’t even willing to make such a small sacrifice for your sect? Don’t you think that this hesitation of yours is failing to live up to your ancestors’ expectations?” Guo Ran also fanned the flames.

“Senior apprentice-brother Qing Yu…”

Those women clenched their teeth and looked at Qing Yu. That appearance was like they were dealing with a difficult decision. But if Qing Yu really did order them to strip, it seemed that they really would listen.

“You’re just spouting nonsense, insulting my Tea Divine School. Who are you? How could the Wine God Palace produce someone as shameless as you?!” demanded Qing Yu suddenly.

“Insulting the Tea Divine School? Weren’t you the one who was so insulting that you said all the seniors of the Wine God Palace are just drunkards? Does that not count as insulting? You were the ones who came here so brazenly to take advantage of the Wine God Palace. Furthermore, you were the one who said the Grand Dao is the pinnacle of simplicity, but you refuse to give evidence. It’s not me insulting you but simply you insulting yourself!” said Long Chen disdainfully.

“Who are you?!” Qing Yu demanded once more.

“I’m surnamed Long, and my given name is Chen!” said Long Chen with a slight smile.

“Long Chen? You’re the one that the Soaring Dragon Company put out an arrest warrant for?” Qing Yu was startled.

The experts in the distance were also startled to hear Long Chen’s name. They had also heard of him.

“Idiot, my boss is-” Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

“It doesn’t matter who I am. I am on the side of the Wine God Palace. If you want to discuss the Dao, then let’s discuss the Dao. If you don’t want to discuss the Dao, then we can use our fists instead. Boss Long San is capable of both. I’ll face your challenge whenever you want,” said Long Chen indifferently. He cut off Guo Ran, not letting Guo Ran say that he was from the High Firmament Academy.

Long Chen then looked at Qing Yu and clearly saw the panic in his eyes. They hadn’t even started, but things were already over. It seemed that discussing the Dao with him was like bullying a child.

Furthermore, the spiritual fluctuations coming from the distance were coming more frequently. Clearly whoever was behind him was teaching him what to say.

In a bit, Qing Yu took a deep breath and recovered a bit of calmness. “My little self was unable to express myself clearly. However, I still believe that my principles are correct. I have always thought that the Tea Dao is more profound than the Wine Dao.”

“Oh? I’d like to hear the details,” said Long Chen.

Qing Yu beckoned and a woman immediately walked over. She then knelt down beside the tea table and took out a set of tea. She got to work.

Qing Yu lightly said, “I believe that the Grand Dao is the pinnacle of simplicity. The simpler something is, the more it expresses the flavor of the Grand Dao. As for tea, it is simple and easy to understand. The tea leaves either float or sink, while the person who drinks the tea only has to do two things, pick it up and put it down. Life is like tea. You must be able to pick things up and put things down. Don’t you think that I am correct?”

As Qing Yu spoke, that woman finished up with the tea. She then passed a cup to Long Chen.

Long Chen smiled. “Well said.”

He picked up the tea and sipped it. But then, he shook his head. “The tea is good tea, the water is good water, and the pot is a good pot. Regretfully, the flavor is lacking a bit. It's flowery without any substance. Its fragrance assaults the nose but doesn’t cleanse the heart. It cannot reach the Dao.”

Qing Yu snorted in response to Long Chen’s appraisal. “Your own words are a typical case of picking something up but not being able to put it down. You can only accept praise but not criticism. You are even further from the Dao.”

“Hahaha, how reasonable. Come a bit closer. I have some words for you!” Long Chen laughed and beckoned to Qing Yu.

Qing Yu was startled. Long Chen’s posture was like he had something secret to tell him, so he couldn’t help extending his head over.

Long Chen reached out his hand. Neither quickly nor slowly, in front of everyone’s shocked gaze, he slapped Qing Yu’s face.

Qing Yu was sent flying, tumbling back into the distance. When he stood up again, half his face was swollen badly. Long Chen’s handprint was very clearly imprinted on it.

“What are you doing?!”

The Tea Divine School’s disciples were enraged. They all took out their weapons, glaring at Long Chen with killing intent. Qing Yu was the most enraged out of them, and he pointed his sword at Long Chen.

“Long Chen, come out! Today, I want a battle to the death with you!”

Long Chen waved his hand. “Don’t mess around. Such a tiny thing is making your face go from red to white. You’re making others laugh at you. Come, drink some tea.”

Long Chen acted like he hadn’t done anything. He actually waved Qing Yu over to drink tea; he even raised his teacup for him.

“A tiny thing?! Bullshit! Today, only one of us will live to see tomorrow’s sun!” Qing Yu howled. The space behind him rumbled and he actually summoned his manifestation. His aura was truly shocking.

Long Chen still acted like he couldn’t see Qing Yu’s anger. He indifferently said, “When drinking tea, there are only two positions. Picking it up and putting it down. Life is like tea. You have to be able to pick things up and put things down. Don’t you think that I am correct?”

Long Chen raised his teacup and took a light sip. That natural appearance of his was as if everything that had just happened had nothing to do with him.

Seeing this, Qing Yu felt like he might explode from rage. These words were the ones that he had just said. But when they came back out of Long Chen’s mouth, they were the greatest mockery.

When everyone heard Long Chen say this, the Wine God Palace’s people all clapped and laughed. This response was truly wonderful.

“Fuck your grandpa! Have a taste of my sword!” Qing Yu suddenly stamped down, stabbing his sword at Long Chen. At this moment, space quivered. He instantly used his strongest attack, while Long Chen didn’t even look at this attack.

Just as the sword was about to reach Long Chen, a hand appeared and caught it between two fingers. That thunderous sword was caught just like that.

“What?!”

Seeing this, all the experts present couldn’t help sucking in a cold gasp of air.
