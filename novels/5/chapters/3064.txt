“That…” Luo Changwu was caught in a difficult position. If it was a different power, they would definitely accept. But the Luo family did not rashly promise to owe someone a favor. A favor could be big or small. There was no way to appraise the value of such a thing. This was a difficult request.

If Long Chen wanted treasures, resources, secret tomes, divine weapons, then as long as the Luo family had them, then they could discuss it. But a favor?

“Don’t worry, I, Long Chen, have my own pride. I will not hold you hostage with a favor. I won’t do anything to damage your foundation or throw your future in danger,” said Long Chen.

This only made Luo Changwu feel even more embarrassed. Long Chen was being so generous, making the Luo family appear petty.

“Alright, as long as junior brother has some request, just tell us. As long as it is something that the Luo family is capable of, we will definitely not disappoint you,” said Luo Changwu. Although he said it brazenly, he held back a bit. That was because on the way here, he had heard that Long Chen was someone who acted regardless of laws or rules. No one knew what he might do, so he couldn’t promise anything.

“This is the pill formula. I have also refined hundreds of these pills myself. Luo Ning told me that the Luo family also has quite a few outstanding alchemists, so with these pills as a sample, it shouldn’t be difficult for the Luo family to begin producing Spirit Awakening Pills,” said Long Chen, taking out a leather hide and a small bottle.

Luo Changwu received the pill formula solemnly. Even he was moved by this pill formula. It was far too important to the Luo family.

Once he received the pills from Long Chen, he found that they were all top grade spirit pills. There were even a few treasure pills, so Luo Changwu once more thanked Long Chen. Although he was aware that Long Chen was an alchemist, someone capable of refining top grade pills at such an age was truly as rare as a phoenix feather or qilin horn. As for a youth capable of refining treasure pills, that was even rarer.

“My Spirit Awakening Pill is my own special formula. It isn’t split by realm. Even if someone has missed their golden period, they can still awaken their spirit. Furthermore, even if someone has gone through spirit awakening, they can undergo a second spirit awakening with this pill. However, the effect will be up to each individual,” said Long Chen.

“That…” Luo Changwu was shaken by this. The Luo family’s disciples should awaken their spirits during the Mortal Transcendence realm. That was their golden time. After missing it, they wouldn’t undergo spirit awakening ever. Furthermore, due to some accidents in the Luo family, their spirit pool was unable to provide for enough people. Hence, many disciples with only average talent were not able to undergo spirit awakening, resulting in their combat power dropping.

However, Long Chen’s pill could not only allow them to awaken their spirits after missing their golden period, but it could also allow those who had undergone a low level spirit awakening to undergo a second spirit awakening. The effect of this medicinal pill was absolutely heaven-defying.

“If that really is the case, my Luo family owes you a truly immense debt.” Luo Changwu took a deep breath. If it really was as Long Chen said, then even the elders of the Luo family could undergo another spirit awakening. In that case, the Luo family’s overall power was about to multiply. This was something he didn’t even dare to dream of.

“Junior brother, if you have anything else to say, please go ahead.” Luo Changwu noticed that Long Chen hesitated and wanted to say something several times, so he spoke up curiously.

Long Chen hesitated once more. In the end, he didn’t ask about his mother. He felt that now still wasn’t the time to expose himself.

“I wish to ask senior to help me protect my secret, but I also feel like that’s superfluous.” Long Chen shook his head. This was just to cover up his previous actions.

“Of course. This will be treated as the top secret in the Luo family. We won’t leak it,” said Luo Changwu.

Long Chen nodded. “After the Nine Prefecture Convention, I want to go pay my respects to the Luo family.”

“If junior brother comes, my Luo family will welcome you with everything we have. Speaking of which, during the Nine Prefecture Convention, be careful around the Chu family,” said Luo Changwu.

“What? Isn’t the Chu family now very subdued?” Luo Bing and Luo Ning were surprised. It had to be known that after the Jialin Immortal Land’s incident, they had been ripped out of the academy for trying to kill Bai Shishi and the other disciples. Even Lord Brahma wouldn’t say anything about it because those people were nothing more than a pack of weak dogs.

The Chu family had then gathered the other powers and demanded an explanation from the academy, all without express orders from above. But they were then driven away by Long Chen.

For the Chu family to fake receiving orders, they had probably drawn a great deal of trouble for themselves. How could they have the time to cause trouble for others?

“You’re still too young. The Chu family’s roots go far deeper than you can imagine. Furthermore, they engage in all kinds of business in the dark. There are many areas we don’t have information on. If you underestimate them, you will definitely suffer. According to our intel, the Chu family is in a rush to regain face after this loss, so they have sent six of their greatest heavenly geniuses to the Nine Prefecture Convention. Their goal goes without saying. So you have to be careful,” said Luo Changwu.

“Are these experts even stronger than Chu Yang?” exclaimed Luo Bing.

“They will only be stronger. There might even be Primals. If you can’t beat them, then just directly admit defeat. Do not put up any meaningless resistance,” ordered Luo Changwu sternly.

“Primals?” Luo Bing and Luo Ning were shocked. How could the Chu family have Primals?

“That’s why I said that the Chu family’s foundation isn’t something you can imagine. But don’t worry, our Luo family will send out our experts to accompany you. But this is the grandest Nine Prefecture Convention ever because the championship prize this time is enough to drive others crazy.”

“What prize?” Long Chen couldn’t help asking.

“It is said that the prize is a golden dragon scale. The rumor is that it is a dragon king’s reverse scale. That is an absolutely priceless treasure. On my way here, I heard of countless hidden monsters coming out for this prize. It will definitely be an exceptionally intense battle,” said Luo Changwu.

“Golden dragon scale?” Long Chen’s heart pounded wildly. Just at this moment, a voice rang out in his mind.

“Obtain it. That is my descendant’s reverse scale. With it, you can summon the golden battle armor. Your physical body will be thousands of times stronger, and you will be able to truly utilize your cultivation technique.”

“Senior!” Long Chen was shocked, not having expected the dragon expert to be able to speak to him. However, no matter how he called out, there was no further response.

“Alright. This golden dragon scale is mine.” Long Chen clenched his fists, battle intent soaring within him.
