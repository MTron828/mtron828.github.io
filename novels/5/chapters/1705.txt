Chapter 1700 Empyrean Winged Blood Devils

Translator: BornToBe

The sixth form of Split the Heavens had many profundities. Long Chen knew how to use it, but he didn’t know the reason why it worked the way it did. When he had asked questions about its principles to the old man, the old man’s explanation had been very vague.

After Long Chen had asked a few too many questions, the old man angrily beat him, telling him to do it as the old man was teaching him to do it. Where did so many questions come from?

At that time, Long Chen realized that even the old man didn’t know the principles behind this technique. He would need to figure them out himself.

Long Chen’s attack infuriated the winged devils. They roared and charged forward. The ones at the front were instantly blown to bits upon striking the spatial gate.

The rest hastily retreated. However, in just that one instant, thousands of them had been killed by the explosive spatial power. That made them roar even more furiously.

“Don’t be so impatient. Once the spatial gate is opened, annihilate the human race. They might be filthy pigs, but their blood is the best sacrificial offering.” Suddenly, a voice rang out, and it caused the winged devils to calm down.

A black-haired man in violet robes appeared amongst the winged devils. As soon as he appeared, the other winged devils went respectfully silent.

The Xuantian Dao Sect’s disciples looked at him in shock. Other than his eyes having blood-colored runes, this man looked the same as the human race.

However, his aura was absolutely terrifying. They could vaguely see some blood-colored images appear behind him. It looked like a roaring fiend emotionlessly looking down on them.

“This fellow is powerful.” Guo Ran and the others jumped in shock. This man’s aura was so oppressive that it was hard for them to breathe.

Those ordinary winged devils already had somewhat frightening auras, but this black-haired man’s aura was dozens of times stronger than theirs, maybe even over a hundred times stronger. Even experts like Chu Yao and Gu Yang felt a chill on their backs.

Behind him was a large group of people. If they weren’t standing amongst the winged devils, Long Chen would have thought that they were humans.

Seeing those people, Long Chen’s pupils narrowed. Although he didn’t know the cultivation realms of the winged devils, other than the black-haired man, the rest of these people had cultivation bases on the level of the Life Star realm. That feeling was clear.

That made his heart shake. If those people really charged over, then Long Chen and the others might not be able to hold them.

These winged devils were even stronger than the Golden Claw Blood Devils, and they were also different from the previous devil creatures. This was an army full of winged devils without any other species. If they all charged forward, then even with the Dragonblood Legion’s power, there might be huge casualties. As for the Xuantian Dao Sect’s disciples, they might all be wiped out.

However, the thing that drew Long Chen’s attention was a certain thing that the man had said.

“Sacrificial offering? Who are you offering sacrifice to?” Long Chen rested Evilmoon on his shoulder. They were viewed as sacrificial offerings. That made him grasp a possible crux of the situation.

“You’ll know once you’re dead,” sneered the black-haired man. He didn’t fall for Long Chen’s bait. “If you think you can learn secrets from my mouth, you should save your effort. All you need to know is that you are pigs that should obediently be killed. Struggling will only make things more painful for you.” 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

This man was so arrogant as to view them as pigs for the slaughter. The Xuantian Dao Sect’s disciples’ fury was instantly ignited.

“Then I won’t waste the effort. Once I cut off your head and do a soulsearch, I’ll naturally know,” said Long Chen indifferently.

“Hahaha!” The man laughed. His laughter shook people’s ears even through the spatial gate, causing the Xuantian Dao Sect’s disciples’ expressions to change. He was truly terrifying. “I can sense the aura of winged devils from your body. You must have killed winged devils before. However, amongst the over three thousand and six hundred branches of the winged devils, my Empyrean Winged Blood Devil race is ranked seventh. Based on your aura, you should be in the human race’s Soul Transformation realm. That’s the same level as my winged devil race’s Blood Transformation realm. In other words, we’re in the same realm. Once the spatial gate opens, I’ll show you that in front of the Empyrean Winged Blood Devil race, humans are weaklings that can only wait to be killed.”

Following his sneering, the winged devils parted, revealing countless Empyrean Winged Blood Devils.

It seemed that the ordinary winged devils were just cannon fodder, while the Empyrean Winged Blood Devils were the true fighters. Seeing the huge army of Empyrean Winged Blood Devils, the Xuantian Dao Sect’s disciples despaired.

If they were just fighting hundreds of thousands or even maybe a few million, they would still have the ability to fight. However, an endless number of winged devils could be seen here. Their numbers had to be counted in the hundreds of millions. This was a hopeless battle.

Even Gu Yang, Meng Qi, and the others gasped. Although the battle had yet to start, just based on their auras, the ordinary winged devils were already stronger than the Golden Claw Blood Devils.

On top of that were the Empyrean Winged Blood Devils, which were even stronger than the regular winged devils. They were the true elites. Even the Dragonblood Legion who had fought alongside Long Chen for so long had never faced such a huge power disparity.

“There’s no way for us to win. Unless we draw them aboveground and have the patriarch use the Xuantian Tower to kill them, there’s no chance.” Hua Shiyu was pale. Everyone’s nerves were tense.

“That’s not a possibility. If we fail to defend this location, only a portion will follow us back to the Xuantian Dao Sect. The rest will go to the other sects. They’ll rapidly spread out. Do you feel like those sects would be able to handle them? If even one sect can’t stop them, then a giant horde of devil creatures will rampage across the continent. Long Chen won’t allow such a thing,” said Meng Qi.

There were many sects connected to this channel. Some of those had been destroyed by Long Chen. The devil creatures could charge right through them.

Drawing all of them to the Xuantian Dao Sect was impossible. Furthermore, they weren’t mindless creatures. They had the same level of intelligence as humans.

“Don’t worry, Long Chen definitely has a way to handle them. Don’t you see that he’s still calm?” pointed out Meng Qi.

They looked toward Long Chen who was still standing on the platform. Seeing his calm expression, the immense pressure on their hearts lightened.

Long Chen was a god-like existence in the eyes of the Xuantian Dao Sect’s disciples. As long as he was present, anything was possible.

Time passed bit by bit until the remaining devil creatures on the battlefield were eliminated. There were mountains of corpses, and a thick scent of blood permeated the air.

Suddenly, the whirlpool that was the spatial gate stopped revolving. It had been fully stabilized. The winged devils roared and charged forward.

“Kill the human race!”

The ones at the front were the winged devils. The runes in their eyes brightened, emitting a strange bloodthirsty light.

“Split the Heavens 6!”

Long Chen slashed his saber parallel to the ground. A huge black saber-image appeared, one that looked like a crescent moon fang. The crescent fang grew larger and larger as it flew until it covered the majority of the battlefield.

When it reached its peak state, heaven and earth rumbled. This was the true sixth form of Split the Heavens.

The crescent fang slashed through the attacks of the winged devils and then devoured the winged devils themselves. This crescent fang was filled with a domineering will, one that said it was unstoppable, unbeatable. The first winged devils were all slain with this one attack.

“Boss is in eighth place!” exclaimed Guo Ran. “Aiya!”

He had just opened his mouth when Tang Wan-er kicked him. Even at this time, he was distracted by the Devil Slaughter Rankings.

Having wiped away the first wave of devil creatures with a single attack, Long Chen stood on the platform, facing the spatial gate like a divine guardian.

“Evilmoon, you’re finally willing to help.” Long Chen smiled.

Evilmoon was finally no longer being a conner. Long Chen no longer needed to use his own energy to activate Evilmoon’s divine runes, wasting a huge amount of spiritual yuan.

Evilmoon was now unleashing a portion of its own power with Long Chen’s attacks without him needing to give it more energy. Not only did this save Long Chen’s energy, but it also raised the power of Split the Heavens to the peak.

“Hehe, fight as you please, I’ll accompany you. I guarantee that at the very least, you’ll be able to fight ten times as long as before,” laughed Evilmoon, filled with battle intent. It seemed that Evilmoon had also felt stifled for a long time and thirsted for a real battle.

If Long Chen would have needed ten thousand units of spiritual yuan to unleash the sixth form of Split the Heavens before, then now with Evilmoon’s assistance, he only needed one thousand. Furthermore, its power was even greater. That filled him with confidence.

Long Chen attacked three more times, slaughtering all the winged devils that charged out. They didn’t even have a chance.

“Boss is mighty!”

The Dragonblood warriors cheered along with the Xuantian Dao Sect’s disciples. Now that Long Chen had joined the fray, he exceeded all their expectations. On his own, he blocked millions and millions of winged devils.

“Human, don’t get too arrogant!” roared an Empyrean Winged Blood Devil. Thousands of them charged into the gate.
