Chapter 3916 True Power

After forcibly snatching Long Aotian’s Sun Moon Five Element Flag, Long Chen killed the Underworld Eye Giant with it. It had to be known that the Underworld Eye Giant was a terrifying expert with unrivaled power. His body was incredibly strong, and he also possessed the Underworld race’s divine abilities.

Meng Qi, Bai Shishi, and the others had tried to kill him multiple times but to no avail. Yet, Long Chen, in a seemingly effortless manner, killed him the moment he emerged, leaving everyone in awe of his battle prowess.

Witnessing this astonishing turn of events, Long Aotian was alarmed, causing him to instinctively retreat. He swiftly flew toward the Sun Moon Five Element Flag and tightly grasped it, vigorously shaking off the blood that stained its surface. However, he didn’t dare to attack again.

With one attack, Long Chen shook the entire battlefield, causing the Dragonblood warriors to cheer. On the other hand, Meng Qi, Dong Mingyu, and Cloud wept after finally seeing his unrivaled form once again. Long Chen was still the old Long Chen. He had never changed a bit.

Only Mo Nian complained, “You’re busy flirting even after I suffered so much just to protect you! To think that a peerless hero almost got killed because of some egg! If it weren’t for you, I’d have long since revealed my divine might and made them piss themselves as they fled. I’ve never suffered such a loss in this lifetime, so hurry up and clean up your mess.”

Killed because of an egg. Was that not precisely the case? If it weren’t for protecting the egg that Long Chen was in, Mo Nian would have been able to fight freely, without any misgivings. Now that Long Chen was out and no longer needed protection, Mo Nian was the one out of energy, not even able to show off anymore. Thus, it was understandable that he was vexed to see Long Chen flirting with Yu Qingxuan.

Long Chen smiled and gently patted Yu Qingxuan’s shoulder. “Stand to the side and watch. Leave things here to me.”

A gentle energy sent the Pill Fairy to Meng Qi’s side. Long Chen then looked at Meng Qi, Cloud, Dong Mingyu, Yue Zifeng, Li Qi, Song Mingyuan, and all the other familiar faces. His eyes wettened and he only nodded to them.

There were no words, but this simple action caused a flood of emotions to surge in all of them. They understood.

The next moment, Long Chen suddenly clenched the void, causing space to explode and a large muscular figure to be torn out of the void. The first thing that entered people’s vision was a bright head. It was Gu Yang.

Gu Yang thought that it was an enemy attack, so he was about to counterattack. But when he saw Long Chen, he was overjoyed.

“Boss!”

Gu Yang’s body was covered in countless injuries, his torn flesh revealing glimpses of bones and his aura growing chaotic. He had clearly pushed himself to his limit.

But shockingly, his battle intent was still as strong as ever. He seemed like a fearless battle god. It was as though if someone wanted to stop him, they had to kill him first. That overflowing battle intent was shocking.

“Good job, brother. But now that I’m here, you don’t need to force yourself this hard. You can just watch and cheer for your boss.” Long Chen patted Gu Yang’s shoulder.

“Yes, boss!”

Gu Yang laughed and put away his spear, standing together with the Dragonblood warriors. He was still dripping blood, but he didn’t mind.

“Excellent. Your luck isn’t bad. You’ve merged with the ancestral dragon reverse scale and are finally qualified to fight with me. However, in the end, the ancestral dragon essence blood is not your own power. You are nothing more than an inferior human, so how much of its power can you possibly control? Hopefully, you don’t disappoint me too badly. After all, I want to use the ancestral dragon essence blood to stimulate the Kunpeng’s most primal bloodline. The Kunpeng race and the dragon race have always been synonyms for the world’s greatest power, both number one from the era of primal chaos until now. But it’s time for the world to know who is the real number one.”

Kun Tu transformed into a humanoid form and stood in the air, looking down on Long Chen.

“Both number one? You really are flattering yourself. There was a time when your Kunpeng race submitted to the dragon race as slaves, and it was only through this that you guys had a chance to recover. If you hadn’t begged for mercy, the Kunpeng race would have been destroyed. But now, you actually say that you’ve always been tied for number one? How interesting. Does believing your own lies feel so good?” asked Long Chen.

“Shut up!” shouted Kun Tu, a pair of giant wings appearing behind him. That was his manifestation.

As his wings shook, heaven and earth collapsed. His sharp claws then pierced through the void at Long Chen.

“You dare to think that you are unrivaled after merely absorbing three ancestral dragon runes? Today, you shall meet your demise here!”

“Arrogance, hypocriticalness, and ignorance have all been perfectly emulated by you. I only absorbed three ancestral dragon runes, but you are in such a hurry to stop me. You are simply afraid. You didn’t even want me to absorb that third rune, right? I thought that you wanted to use me as a whetstone? But it seems that you’re afraid that this whetstone would be too tough and would destroy you. If you’re afraid, you should be respectful. Instead, you act so overwhelmingly arrogant. Are you putting on a performance? What a hypocrite.” Long Chen snorted and directly unleashed a punch at Kun Tu.

“Hahaha, well-said, very well-said! Fuck, the human race really is eloquent! You hit the nail on the head! That’s right, infuriate these feathered animals, hahaha!”

The dragon expert’s voice rang out in Long Chen’s mind. Clearly, he was very satisfied with Long Chen’s words.

The dragon race and the Kunpeng race were old enemies. But once the Kunpeng race submitted to the dragon race, their enmity came to an end. After all, it was a natural law of the Heavenly Daos for both races to fight for number one. There was no right or wrong here.

But after the Kunpeng race submitted, they secretly schemed to target the dragon race, even drawing in other races in an attempt to destroy their master. They then covered up that history, wantonly slandering the dragon race. They actually twisted things and said that the dragon race had submitted to them back then.

Hearing this, the prideful dragon race could not accept such a betrayal and insult. In their fury, their hatred for the Kunpeng race was carved into their blood and souls, and this enmity was passed down generation after generation. As a result, every time a pureblooded dragon and Kunpeng met, there would be a battle to the death.

BOOM!

When a fist and a claw met, the resulting impact surged like shooting stars, causing light and dark to flip and heaven and earth to switch places. This collision made countless people feel like the world was spinning around them. Gravity seemed to vanish as countless rocks floated into the air, but then they exploded when struck by the ripples.Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

It was like this entire world was collapsing, causing countless experts to be horrified. That was because what Long Chen and Kun Tu were competing with was not the laws of heaven and earth but pure physical strength.

The fist and claw were still linked, with more and more ripples coming out of them. As a result, terrifying apocalyptic power spread further and further away. If someone was struck by that power, not even a speck of them would remain. This was a power that they could not comprehend.

“So, this is the power of the Kunpeng race? It seems that you know nothing about true power.”

Long Chen suddenly raised his left hand and slapped Kun Tu in the face in front of countless shocked gazes.
