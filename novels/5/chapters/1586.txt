Chapter 1581 Shen Bijun

Translator: BornToBe

In the Central Xuan Region, there was a holy land with soaring mountains and ancient forest of towering trees. Mist shrouded the land, making it look like a fantasy world.

Atop one of those soaring mountains was a grand and beautiful palace. It could vaguely be seen within the mist and cloud.

The rising and falling mountains looked like they were moving rhythmically. It enthralled the heart, looking like it contained the silent transformations of the mysterious Grand Dao of music.

This place was the Martial Heaven Continent’s famous Illusive Music Immortal Palace. The reason why it was so famous was because in times when the continent had been facing a great crisis, powerful experts had come from the Illusive Music Immortal Palace, allowing humanity to survive. It was one of the protectors of the Martial Heaven Continent.

Another reason for its fame was because all the Illusive Music Immortal Palace’s members were women. Countless experts yearned to win one of their hearts.

If anyone could marry one of their disciples, it would be the blessing of their lifetime. The Illusive Music Immortal Palace’s disciples used music to peer into the heavens. Their songs were the music of the Heavenly Daos, and it was extremely beneficial to one’s cultivation.

Regretfully, the Illusive Music Immortal Palace’s core disciples never married. Only outer disciples with lower aptitude would sometimes choose to abandon their Music Dao cultivation when they found a man they fancied.

Within the main palace, there were hundreds of women sitting at the front. These women looked to be around thirty years old; however, in reality, they were the Illusive Music Immortal Palace’s Elders. Their age was shockingly high.

On the throne of the palace was a beautiful woman looking at Zi Yan with a complicated expression.

Zi Yan’s head was lowered. Beside her was another woman. She was tall and slender, and her hair was tied up in several high knots, making it look like a vertical cloud.

She was also beautiful, but her face was a bit thin and her chin was a bit sharp. To Zi Yan, she coldly said, “Our Illusive Music Immortal Palace is the protector of the continent, but you actually showed mercy to someone for personal reasons, resulting in countless experts dying. Junior apprentice-sister Zi Yan, how are you going to explain yourself to us? To the continent?”

This woman was Zi Yan’s senior apprentice-sister. Her name was Shen Bijun. Within the entire Illusive Music Immortal Palace, she was the only one whose talent had reached the same level as Zi Yan. In fact, because she had joined earlier, she was even stronger than Zi Yan.

The two of them were the Illusive Music Immortal Palace’s peak geniuses. They were both Empyreans and apprentices of the current palace master. However, Zi Yan was the one who had gained the privilege to control the Seven String Sea Suppressing Zither. That signified that Zi Yan would be the successor of the palace master in the future.

Shen Bijun didn’t like that and was even a bit jealous. She normally didn’t dare to say anything about it, but today, she finally had an opportunity to attack Zi Yan verbally to the point that she couldn’t fight back at all.

“Zi Yan, tell me. Why did you hold back?” asked the palace master. She had some pain in her eyes, but as the palace master, she had to continue.

“Disciple is incompetent. Disciple is willing to relinquish the control of the Seven String Sea Suppressing Zither as punishment,” said Zi Yan with her head lowered.

That shocked everyone. Giving up the Seven String Sea Suppressing Zither indicated that she was giving up her position as the future palace master.

As for Shen Bijun, she was shocked but also pleased.

“Nonsense, are you a child? Are you trying to escape from your responsibility?” demanded the palace master.

A dripping sound rang out. Only now did people notice that Zi Yan’s tears were constantly dripping on the ground.

“Everyone else can leave. I wish to speak to Zi Yan alone.” Seeing those tears, the palace master’s heart softened.

“Palace master-!” cried out Shen Bijun.

“Go.”

“Yes.”

Shen Bijun was unwilling. She knew that the palace master was unwilling to criticize Zi Yan in front of everyone. Most likely, the palace master wouldn’t scold her at all.

Shen Bijun had finally had a chance to strike Zi Yan thanks to this matter, but the palace master was too biased toward her, enraging Shen Bijun. However, she didn’t dare to retort, and she left with everyone else.

The large room only had the palace master and Zi Yan. The palace master sighed and walked over to Zi Yan.

“Master...” Zi Yan threw herself into her master’s embrace and cried.

“Child, what am I going to do with you? Before going, I have told you that Long Chen was your devil star. Each time you encountered him, you gave up your chance to kill him. You didn’t kill him in the Eastern Wasteland. You didn’t kill him in the Grand Xia. You didn’t kill him in the Eastern Xuan City. Now, you even had another chance to kill him in a justifiable manner. If you had unleashed the Ten Thousand Spirit Heaven Suppressing Song, then with the Seven String Sea Suppressing Zither’s assistance, you would have had at least an eighty percent chance of killing him. Even though that divine ring of his is strange, you would still have heavily injured him. With the other experts present, Long Chen would have definitely died. Now that you’ve missed this chance, the difficulty in killing him will multiply next time. If you don’t kill him next time, then you will definitely die to him. Why must you do this?” The palace master gently rubbed Zi Yan’s hair. She sighed, “You held back, was it because you were testing how Long Chen felt toward you?”

Zi Yan sobbed, “If he killed me, it would prove that I wasn’t in his heart. I would be dead, and I wouldn’t have to feel any pain. If he didn’t kill me, it would mean I was in his heart, and I still had a chance to save him. However... however, he actually said such heartless words... I...” Zi Yan couldn’t speak any longer as her tears overwhelmed her.

“Foolish girl, there’s no chance for the two of you. He is your fated devil star. In the end, only one of you can live in this world. You have to face this destiny,” urged the palace master. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

“Master, I really can’t. Although I don’t approve of Long Chen’s methods, I don’t approve of how those people acted either. If both sides were wrong, why must I only kill Long Chen? Is it only because they have more people? Because they were wrong as a majority, they don’t need to bear any guilt? As the protector of the Martial Heaven Continent, are we protecting the Martial Heaven Continent’s people, or the Martial Heaven Continent’s justice?” demanded Zi Yan.

“Child, we are not protectors of the Martial Heaven Continent’s people, nor are we protectors of the Martial Heaven Continent’s justice. We are protectors of the Heavenly Daos. You don’t understand many things, but you will understand them in the future. This is the mission of our Illusive Music Immortal Palace.”

Zi Yan shook her head. “Master, please don’t make things hard on yourself. I want to rest for a while and sort out my thoughts.”

“Alright. You truly do need some time to rest.” The palace master gave her approval. Once Zi Yan left, she sighed deeply.

“Master.”

Not long after Zi Yan had left, Shen Bijun walked in.

“Are you dissatisfied with my decision?” asked the palace master.

“Disciple would not dare,” said Shen Bijun hastily.

“Would not dare? Haha, alright then. I really am a bit biased toward Zi Yan. To Tell the truth, I was never very fond of you,” said the palace master.

Shen Bijun’s expression changed. “I don’t understand what you mean...”

“Don’t worry. I’m just speaking frankly. Do you know why I don’t like you?” asked the palace master.

“Is it that disciple is too foolish?”

“You’re wrong. Your talent, your comprehension ability, your karmic luck, they’re all superior to Zi Yan. Are you curious why despite being so great, I still chose Zi Yan as my successor?” The palace master stared at Shen Bijun deeply. “It’s because your heart has always contained a trace of wild ambition that cannot be erased. Your desires are too great.”

“I-”

“You don’t need to explain yourself. The Illusive Music Immortal Palace cultivates the heart, using music to peer into the heavens. Not only is your heart clear to me, but it was also shown clearly to all the Elders in the palace today. To tell the truth, if it weren’t for that wild ambition, your current accomplishments would be even greater, and I would have long since given the successor position to you.”

“Then what should I do? Please guide me!” Shen Bijun suddenly knelt on the ground pleadingly.

“There’s nothing anyone can do. This is your primal desire hidden in the deepest part of your heart. But since you’re so attached to the palace master position, I can give you one chance. If you can kill Long Chen, then once your cultivation base reaches the appropriate level, I will give you the palace master position.”

“As long as you lend me the Seven String Sea Suppressing Zither, I can definitely give you Long Chen’s head!” declared Shen Bijun.

“Don’t get too excited yet. I’m not done speaking. If you kill Long Chen, then you can become the palace master. However, the Illusive Music Immortal Palace’s major decisions are decided by a vote amongst all the Elders. This is to prevent the palace master from being tyrannical and possibly destroying the Illusive Music Immortal Palace,” warned the palace master.

“That’s fine. I just wish to work for the Illusive Music Immortal Palace and save my junior apprentice-sister Zi Yan from her worries,” said Shen Bijun gratefully.

“Yes, alright. You can go. You’ll have to wait for an opportunity to present itself to kill Long Chen. Qu Jianying is being tough right now, and while we don’t fear her, there’s no need for us to go directly against her. During this time, I will teach you how to control the Seven String Sea Suppressing Zither. It’ll be up to you in the end.”

“Yes.”

Shen Bijun had just left when a voice rang out in the palace master’s head. “You are doing something very dangerous.

“For Zi Yan, I’m willing to do anything. That child is perfect, except she’s just too kind. Please, when Shen Bijun makes her move, assist her with your full ability. I would rather give the palace master position to Shen Bijun than allow Zi Yan to die to Long Chen,” said the palace master. The one she was speaking to was the Illusive Music Immortal Palace’s divine item, the Seven String Sea Suppressing Zither.

“Alright. However, prepare yourself. Long Chen isn’t so easy to kill,” said the Seven String Sea Suppressing Zither.

The palace master nodded. She looked out the gates toward the distant mountains, her heart uneasy. Could it be that Long Chen was not just Zi Yan’s devil star, but also the Illusive Music Immortal Palace’s devil star? Or perhaps the entire world’s devil star?
