Chapter 3192 You’re Finally Here

This terrifying tribulation made everyone afraid. Furthermore, it had just started. If Long Chen really was in danger of failing, no one could save him. Anyone who tried to would definitely die. It had nothing to do with how high that person’s realm was.

“Don’t speak to avoid getting caught by the heavenly tribulation and invoking karma,” said the dean.

Hearing this warning, the other higher-ups of the academy shuddered. They instantly shut their mouths. Any karma grasped by the Heavenly Daos would be troublesome.

At this moment, the heavenly lightning raged like an angry sea. This place became a sea of lightning.

The remaining experts of the Bloodkill Hall were like tiny boats trying to survive within this raging sea. They didn’t dare to flee or resist, so they could only bitterly endure.

Qin Feng coughed up blood. The lightning ravaged his body, almost tearing him apart. He was reaching his limit.

He had just refined the resonance dragon’s reverse scale, so his physical body had grown terrifyingly powerful. Just the power of his physical body surpassed the Primal Divine Lords of the Bloodkill Hall.

However, he was at the center of the tribulation with Long Chen. The pressure he was enduring was far greater than what those experts were enduring.

Just then, a curtain of light appeared over Qin Feng’s body. A lightning dragon could be seen within that barrier, and it devoured some of the lightning attacking him, reducing the pressure on him until he could just barely manage to hang on.

There was no need for Long Chen to say anything. Qin Feng was also aware that every extra second he could endure during this heavenly tribulation would benefit him immensely. He refused to let himself admit defeat or fall unconscious.

This was his conviction. This heavenly tribulation wasn’t even targeting him; it was targeting his boss. If he couldn’t even endure this bit of power, how could he be qualified to follow his boss any longer?

Bai Shishi watched as Qin Feng clenched his teeth and endured. She sighed inside. As expected, there were no shortcuts to becoming an expert.

Previously, she had been shocked by Qin Feng’s powerful will and mental strength. Now that she saw him facing the wrath of the heavens, his body being pushed to the limit but still persevering, she understood.

The will of the Heavenly Daos was like a sharpening blade tempering a person’s will. Having also gone through the heavenly tribulation, she knew just how terrifying it was. Furthermore, Long Chen’s heavenly tribulation was no ordinary heavenly tribulation. It was like a heavenly punishment. The sharpening blade became a hammer, so it wasn’t sharpening him. It was hammering him. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

It was hard to imagine just how great the heavenly might that was crashing down on them was. Seeing how ashen those Primal Divine Lords were and how they didn’t even dare to move, it had to be terrifying.

Now Bai Shishi could understand just how Long Chen could resist the will of a World King. No matter how powerful a World King was, could they surpass the heavens?

Bai Shishi felt a bit regretful. If she could be like Long Chen and dared to challenge the heavenly tribulation, she didn’t know just how much stronger her will would be. Of course, after thinking about it calmly, if she failed, it would be the end of everything.

More lightning runes poured down without any sign of weakening. Instead, they simply grew stronger. Long Chen had his upper body bare and his hands raised toward the heavens. He seemed to be bathing in lightning.

Although this lightning was wild, it was absorbed into his body like water in a dried-up water bed.

Those lightning runes went from rampaging tigers to gentle sheep once they were in his body. They gradually merged into his flesh and blood.

After the dragon blood had changed his body, he was now many times stronger. Furthermore, the golden dragon blood gradually transformed, going from gold to red. But when it became red, it grew even more active than before.

Long Chen didn’t know why such a thing would occur. All he knew was that this was a good thing. Through the baptism of this heavenly tribulation, the golden dragon essence blood would truly become one with his body.

As he sucked in this lightning, millions of tiny lightning dragons swam through the air. They were continuously absorbing the lightning. However, Lei Long was only absorbing them bit by bit, afraid that it would affect Long Chen if too much was absorbed.

Furthermore, Lei Long was also controlling the intensity of the lightning pouring down on Qin Feng, not letting it surpass his limits. Long Chen had said that the big feast was coming later, so there was no rush.

Suddenly, the void shuddered and countless lifeforms fell from the heavens, charging at Long Chen. Some of them were of the human race with strange clothes, but there were also all kinds of beasts. There were dragons, phoenixes, goblin monsters, wild devils, demonic beasts, and many more. Many of them were things that people had never seen before.

Those lifeforms roared and charged at Long Chen as if he was the one who had killed them when they were alive. An aura of resentment erupted. It was as if the gates to hell had been opened.

“The heavenly tribulation has manifested the resentful spirits of the dead? These are all lifeforms he killed in his life?” exclaimed Bai Zhantang.

Legend had it that those who had killed too many people would have a chance to face such a manifestation during their heavenly tribulation. Those lifeforms that had been slain would manifest during the tribulation to get revenge on their killer.

It was said that these heavenly tribulation manifestations were connected by the karma of the Heavenly Daos. These resentful lifeforms absorbed the power of the heavenly tribulation to match the power of the one undergoing tribulation.

Normally, such a manifestation declared that the person undergoing tribulation would be killed for sure. Such a tribulation was not just difficult to survive. It was practically impossible to beat.

These lifeforms continued to pour out limitlessly. They easily surpassed the billions. Even the Bloodkill Hall’s experts were affected.

However, the Bloodkill Hall’s experts didn't attack back. Someone had summoned divine energy barriers, only to be torn apart. A lifeform that looked like a human skeleton wielding a giant blade slashed through his defenses and struck, causing him to cough up blood.

These lifeforms were covered in lightning, and their attacks contained the might of the heavens. Even Primals, who were capable of blocking the attack, were unable to block the will of the heavens that attacked them as well. As a result, that person’s mind almost shattered.

“Chant the divine sutra! Summon divine protection.”

Someone from the Bloodkill Hall shouted, and everyone began to chant at the same time. After that, their foreheads split open, and blood poured out, condensing into chains that linked them all together.

Enpuda’s divine statue glowed. At this moment, a divine mark appeared on his chest. Its light joined with those blood chains, and the statue’s closed eyes flew open. Enpuda’s aura manifested.

“Enpuda, you’re finally here. I want to ask you, how do you feel now?” Long Chen smiled as he fought off the attacks of those lifeforms with a lightning blade.
