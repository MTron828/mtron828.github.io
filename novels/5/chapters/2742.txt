Chapter 2731 Sovereign Crown

In front of a ninth Heavenstage Long Aotian, Long Chen didn’t dare to be the slightest bit careless. His divine ring and Six Star Battle Armor appeared.

BOOM!

As a result, Long Chen and Long Aotian were both blown back. It was just a probing blow, but it caused the bone mountain to crumble.

“You’ve advanced to the seventh Heavenstage. It seems that you’ve been cultivating with your life on the line. How regretful that no matter how hard you try, you’ll be nothing more than a side character!”

Long Aotian sneered. Just at that moment, an indistinct crown appeared on his head. When that crown manifested, the feeling of the entire world changed. Long Aotian’s aura rose by several times, and a Sovereign pressure appeared.

“Do you see this? I’ve condensed the Sovereign crown, a mark of being a Sovereign. Although it’s not yet complete, it’s enough for me to command heaven and earth. As for you, you are an ant crawling beneath my feet!”

Long Aotian walked through the air, every step causing the void to rumble. Moreover, flowers of the Grand Dao appeared, trailing behind him. He was like the ruler of this world.

Long Chen coldly said, “So what if you’ve condensed a Sovereign crown? It’s still not enough in front of me. Let alone this embryonic form, even if you were truly a Sovereign, you would still be a dog in front of me.”

“Sovereign suppression!” Long Aotian furiously shouted, slamming his hand down. Cracks appeared in the void.

Those cracks possessed the power of the laws of the Heavenly Daos, which then froze the space around Long Chen. Long Aotian was using the power of an entire world to suppress Long Chen.

The moment he used this power, space began to fold on itself, stacking over and over. The concept of time and space was distorted. Instead, chaos reigned.

Just as Long Chen was caught in a chaotic stream of spacetime, Long Aotian’s spear stabbed toward his stomach. He hated Long Chen, to the point that he didn’t want the latter to die so quickly. He wanted to first cripple Long Chen’s cultivation base.

Within this Sovereign domain, Long Chen was like a prisoner trapped in a prison. He had lost his connection to the outside world’s power. To any Empyrean, this was an absolute suppression with no way to escape.

However, that was not the case for Long Chen. Upon reaching the seventh Heavenstage, his power source was not the outside world but his 108,000 stars.

BOOM!

With a thunderous roar, Long Chen shattered Long Aotian’s Sovereign domain. Evilmoon hacked into his spear like a bolt of black lightning.

“What?”

“Even the power of a Sovereign is unable to bind him?”

“How is that possible?” Ye Ming, the Nine-Headed Lion, the Blood Fiend Devil Lord, and the Alldevil Heavenwalker were stunned. The four of them had all reached the peak of the ninth Heavenstage, having condensed the embryonic Sovereign crown. That meant that they had also condensed the power of an entire world. It could be said that their Sovereign suppression was a peerless counter to any technique and lifeform.

They had tested it themselves. Other than against Venerate experts that had a certain resistance, those at the ninth Heavenstage and below could only obediently be suppressed.

However, it was actually ineffective against Long Chen, which stunned them. He was practically a monster. There was no way to judge him with common sense.

BOOM!

As Evilmoon slashed into the dragon spear, Long Chen’s arm trembled. The current Long Aotian had the Sovereign crown and the support of an entire world’s energy and laws, so his power had surpassed the level that a normal person could comprehend.

As for Long Aotian, he almost coughed up blood. He was barely able to keep a hold of his spear. He was shocked that he couldn’t suppress Long Chen.

While Long Chen’s right arm quivered, his left hand wasn’t blocked by anything. It swung out, and a lightning rune appeared in his palm the instant he struck Long Aotian’s face.

That was Lei Linger’s power. As a result, Long Aotian’s face exploded, and he shot back amongst the divine families. Startled, the divine families reached out to catch Long Aotian.

“Split the Heavens 9!”

Just at that moment, Long Chen slashed Evilmoon. His scales turned half black and his Blood Qi soared. His saber was like a river of stars slashing down.

A crescent moon fang was unleashed out of Evilmoon, flying toward Long Aotian. As a result, all of the divine families’ experts caught in its line were annihilated.

“Block it!”

Hundreds of experts on the level of Venerates from the divine families attacked. Rays of divine light flew out.

BOOM!

As those rays of divine light exploded along with the saber-image, all these Venerates coughed up blood, horrified. Even their combined power still resulted in them being injured.

“Split the Heavens 9!”

They had just received Long Chen’s attack when another heaven-rending saber slashed toward Long Aotian. It was as if it would not stop until Long Aotian was dead.

There was practically no pause between the two attacks. Long Aotian was still in the midst of recovering. If it weren’t for the divine families’ experts helping him receive the first attack, he would have died.

The divine families’ experts were now injured and forced back, unable to help him receive the second attack. Hence, with a furious roar, Long Aotian blocked with his spear.

BOOM!

Long Aotian coughed up blood, tumbling back. Long Chen’s power came from his 108,000 stars and so it contained 108,000 different sets of laws. Because of it, Long Aotian was temporarily unable to recover with his Heavenly Dao energy. Even the Sovereign crown was unable to suppress Long Chen’s power.

“Split the Heavens 9!”

Just at this moment, Long Chen’s third blow fell, stunning everyone.

They were well aware of Long Chen’s Split the Heavens. He had used it last time. But back then, every usage had exhausted him.

This time, Long Chen had unleashed it three times without pause, stunning Long Aotian. In his current state, there was no way he could receive such an attack. He was still off-balance and injured from the last one.

However, this blow of Long Chen’s didn’t contain any locking power. Without even thinking about it, Long Aotian dodged to the side.

The divine families’ experts also dodged almost instinctively. As this shocking blow passed by all of them, the laws of heaven and earth were sliced apart by it. A giant hole now appeared in their perfect cage.

“Not good”!

Everyone’s expression suddenly changed. However, it was too late. Long Chen had rushed out of the opening created by the ninth form of Split the Heavens.

BOOM!

Just as he escaped their encirclement, a golden hand fell from the sky, slamming into Long Chen’s body. As a result, he coughed up a mouthful of blood and was forced back.

A dozen elders appeared in the void. One of them looked at Long Chen with a complicated expression.

“Just give up. You can’t escape. As long as you abandon your hatred, the doors of the divine families will be opened to you.” Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

“Lord Saint, how is that acceptable?! Long Chen must die!” roared Long Aotian.
