Chapter 3628

“What an overconfident fool… Humans are the spirit of the ten thousand creatures. We control the ten thousand Daos. Since you refuse to submit, I’ll beat you into submission. Tighten your pants!”

Long Chen raised his head and roared. In his full firepower state, it was like he was wrapped in violet qi battle armor.

“What does that mean?!” demanded Alldevil Tianye.

“It means that when I beat the crap out of you, I’d rather not get splashed by it!” shouted Long Chen.

“I… I’ll fucking kill you!”

Alldevil Tianye instantly exploded with rage. The black tide behind him flowed, and his staff mobilized the full black tide around him. This was an attack that seemed completely unstoppable.

“I’ll be the one killing you!” Long Chen refused to show any weakness. At this moment, the Minghong Saber rumbled and stars flowed on top of it. When starry energy merged into the Minghong Saber, it let out an excited cry. It was like a bloodthirsty beast that smelled fresh blood.

BOOM!

Violet light and black light twisted and clashed. The two of them struck each other in an exchange that destroyed the world around them. Because of them, the sun and moon in the sky were gone, and the stars could no longer be seen. All people could see was a dark world of violet and black.

“Die!”

After those two world-shaking attacks struck, both of them roared and began to unleash a crazy tempest of attacks.

They refused to retreat even an inch. With how crazy they attacked, it was as if the person to retreat a single inch first would be completely humiliated.

This was no longer a battle between two people. Now, they fought for the honor of their race, so neither of them could afford to lose. One was a peerless heavenly genius of the Alldevil race, while the other was a peerless expert of the human race. Their fight seemed to bring about the apocalypse upon this world.

“How is Alldevil Tianye so terrifying? If the Alldevil race was like this before, we’d have long since been exterminated!” The Celestial Essence Sect’s patriarch was shocked and amazed as he watched that distant battle. The world there was constantly collapsing and breaking.

Alldevil Tianye was an absolute monster. His power suppressed the Heavenly Daos. Under this condition, their battle armors would lose most of their effect. After all, while a portion of their power came from themselves, another portion came from the Heavenly Daos.

“Legend has it that the Alldevil race has over three thousand emperor races. Within the emperor races, if they produce a powerful expert, they will send them to a trial to accumulate power. Every hundred thousand years, the Alldevil race supposedly carries out a gathering of peak experts. Sixteen competitors will then appear amongst the three thousand emperor races to fight for the Alldevil Imperial Lord’s inheritance. Those qualified to join the trial must be the ones fighting for those sixteen spots. Alldevil Tianye had previously said that he came for a trial, so all of this is nothing more than a game to him. It is said that back then, when Xia Guhong charged into the devil world, he killed three of the Alldevil race’s peak experts. It’s said that one against three, Xia Guhong killed one, crippled one, and made one flee. However, he also paid a terrifying price. It seemed that he left behind half of his life inside the devil world. But only Xia Guhong and a few of his trusted comrades saw that battle. They vanished after returning and never mentioned anything about that battle again. Hence, no one else knows the details of that battle. Even this information is considered a rumor. But seeing how terrifying Alldevil Tianye is, it can be seen why someone as powerful as Xia Guhong would almost lose his life,” said Xue Yifan with a sigh.

“Brother Yifan, I previously looked down on you, feeling that among our nine top experts, your old slippery bones were the most useless. Now I admit that I misjudged. In truth, amongst the nine of us, I’m the most useless. Perhaps only you have the power to ask such a genius for aid. Otherwise, our Alldevil Star-Field would be doomed. Ha, that slap was well done,” said the patriarch of the Celestial Essence Sect. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

The patriarch no longer felt any hatred for Long Chen even though Long Chen had slapped him in the face and cut off his head. Now, he even felt like he deserved it.

“Brother Tianxiang, I also admire that magnanimity of yours. For us brothers to be able to witness this battle, we are seeing the hope of the human race rising. Hehe, even if these old bones of mine have to be buried today, I can now face our ancestors with a smile,” said another half-step Divine Venerate. He was gratified.

At this time, the three hundred and sixty thousand starry river warriors were bravely killing their enemies. They were fearless. As long as the human race could pass through this tribulation, the old fellows believed that this group of starry river warriors would do a better job for the human race than they had done in their time.

“Only when the era comes do geniuses appear. The new generation will surpass the old. Although it’s a bit painful for the old generation, it must be accepted. Dean Yifan is correct, we are only witnesses. The Alldevil Star-Field truly is lucky. Back then, Xia Guhong was present to lead us in battle. Now, we have dean Long Chen striving to save us from this crisis. I’m confident that even without us, the human race will enter a long period of peace after this,” said Xue Yifan.

All of them exchanged a look and suddenly laughed. That laugh was full of a heroic feeling.

“Kill!”

Guo Ran and the others led the starry river warriors against the devil beast army. They were the vanguard, a sharp blade piercing through their enemies. Hence, they were covered in blood. Their battle armors were soaked in so much blood that their original appearance could no longer be seen.

They were already numb to the killing. They only had one thought, and that was to kill as many as they could. As long as they didn’t die, they would be killing, killing until there was no enemy left to kill.

However, a battle of this intensity placed an extremely heavy burden on them. Most of these starry river warriors had never even participated in a battle, let alone such a terrifying one. The mental and physical pressure was immense. Because of that, they had not even been fighting for an hour before they started to feel tired. But they bitterly endured.

The original formation that they had drilled was not able to provide many benefits. As some starry river warriors died in combat, their lineup was no longer complete.

There was no way around it. They hadn’t had much time for training. It had to be known that the Dragonblood Legion was only able to fight so solidly together due to undergoing countless battles together. That was what tempered their ability to support each other without the need to say anything.

To have a group of three hundred and sixty thousand warriors suddenly go to war in just ten days of training was insane. It was already amazing that they were able to fight as well as they were right now.

As for Guo Ran, although he was the general, there were too many enemies. He had to be constantly targeting the strongest enemies that appeared to avoid large casualties appearing among the starry river warriors. He didn’t have much time to direct the troops. Thus, as the pressure increased on the Starry River Legion and the formation grew chaotic, Guo Ran couldn’t do anything about it. The number of casualties was constantly increasing. As of now, over forty thousand starry river warriors had fallen.

The only gratifying thing was that the starry river warriors were truly brave. Not a single person retreated. Even though they were tired, they still fought to the death.

The starry river warriors also knew that they were the main force of this battlefield, and they could not retreat. Behind them was the city where their fathers, mothers, and families resided. If they retreated, it would mean that all the people dear to them would die to the devil race. Hence, their only choice was to fight to the death.

Suddenly, rays of divine light rained down just as their casualties were steadily increasing. Rays of Sword Qi slaughtered the Alldevil experts in front of Guo Ran and the others.

“Dean, you…!”

Guo Ran and the others were startled. Shockingly, Xue Yifan, the Celestial Essence Sect’s patriarch, and the other elders had charged their way over.
