Chapter 3770: Underworld Eye Giant

Jiang Lei was also delighted. But the most delighted one was Lei Linger. She coiled around Long Chen’s body excitedly as a lightning dragon.

The surrounding Supreme heavenly geniuses unleashed their auras, breaking through to the next realm. Lightning rumbled.

At the same time, Blood Qi shot out of the Heavenly River Blood Sea, pouring toward those demonic beasts.

“This is our demonic beast race’s sacred land! By borrowing the power of the heavenly tribulation to temper our bodies, we can absorb the bloodline power of our ancestors better, merging with their runes and awakening their divine abilities. As for your inferior human race, you think you can steal our treasures? Keep dreaming!” shouted a Supreme expert, blood-colored chains wrapping around his body. His Blood Qi was climbing frantically.

Just as he said, the billion Beast Venerates within the Heavenly River Blood Sea were dead, their bodies decayed. But their soul essence remained and their essence blood was gathered here. Moreover, their soul essence actually absorbed the energy of heaven and earth to preserve their essence blood and the runes within it, forming the Heavenly River Blood Sea for future descendants.

A billion Beast Venerates, encapsulating countless races. Thus, this place became the sacred land of the demonic beasts. Undergoing tribulation here would allow them to receive the blessing of their ancestors. They could then absorb their ancestors’ bloodline power, making it easier for them to awaken their divine abilities and activate a Heavenly Dao Crown.

Thus, this place was always guarded by the demonic beast race. Other races were not allowed in.

Despite that, outsiders constantly tried to enter. Although they couldn’t awaken such divine abilities or receive any blessing, what they wanted was the power of the essence blood here.

After all, this power was not limited to one race. It could greatly improve a person’s essence blood in terms of both purity and power.

Even so, this kind of power was normally impossible to absorb. Let alone for other races, even the demonic beast races were incapable of it.

It was only during the baptism of heavenly tribulation that the impurities within the blood sea could be driven out. This kind of opportunity was something that even outsider races could absorb.

Thus, despite this being viewed as a forbidden land of the demonic beast race, countless outsider experts continued to try to break in. This place still had a fatal attraction that brought people to their deaths.

At this moment, spears of lightning fell from the sky. They were absolutely terrifying, their power on par with the third wave of tribulation from the previous group of demonic beasts.

One lightning spear directly landed on Long Chen’s head, but he didn’t even glance at it. It simply shattered on contact, as this level of lightning was unable to harm him.

“Boss, we should also undergo tribulation. Let them know what a true heavenly tribulation is!” urged Jiang Lei.

He knew that Long Chen’s heavenly tribulations were always the most terrifying. Previously, Jiang Lei had been afraid of his heavenly tribulations. But now that he was a lightning attribute Supreme expert, he was looking forward to it.

Hundreds of Supreme experts surrounded them, but they didn’t attack. They simply allowed the heavenly tribulation to descend, so this place would become a terrifying region of heavenly lightning. It seemed that they wished to enjoy the sight of Long Chen dying to heavenly tribulation.

Countless demonic beasts were starting their tribulations outside of this region as well. The entire Heavenly River Blood Sea was boiling. With its help, there was little chance of dying to heavenly tribulation. That was why they were so brazen as to undergo collective tribulation.

However, those people did distance themselves from these Supreme heavenly geniuses. After all, there was a huge difference in their tribulations. If they were affected by the lightning from these Supreme heavenly geniuses, they might be instantly wiped out.

“Don’t be anxious. Now that the heavenly tribulation has descended, there’s nothing for us to fear. Let’s go take a look somewhere else.”

Long Chen suddenly shot into motion. He charged at those Supreme heavenly geniuses undergoing tribulation.

“Don’t kill him! That’s letting him off too easily! We’ll make him die bit by bit in endless despair!” shouted one of the demonic beasts.

Long Chen easily charged through this enclosure, and these demonic beasts followed him, not letting him leave the range of their heavenly tribulation.

“Get out of the way!”

Long Chen was now out, with the Supreme experts chasing him. However, they quickly saw him rushing toward those ordinary demonic beasts. The latter instantly turned green and fled.

However, within this lighting-filled area, their speed was clearly impacted. They weren’t even as fast as before.

As a result, the weaker ones were instantly covered by the heavenly tribulations of the Supreme experts. Quite a few of them had lightning spears blast through their bodies. Just like that, an army of millions was instantly sliced through in the middle.

In truth, Long Chen wasn’t moving that quickly because he wasn’t planning on leaving the scope of these Supreme experts’ heavenly tribulation. After all, in order to prepare for the true heavenly tribulation, a warm-up was necessary. Whether it was Lei Linger or Jiang Lei, absorbing this lightning would strengthen them.

Long Chen led hundreds of heavenly geniuses with an enormous heavenly tribulation above them. Just like that, he charged into the center of the Heavenly River Blood Sea.

He quickly saw more demonic beasts. That group was fighting an enormous giant with a hammer. This giant was actually chasing down and killing the demonic beasts.

With a single swing of the hammer, countless demonic beasts were sent flying. There were actually several Supreme geniuses amongst them.

“Wilde!”

Long Chen and Jiang Lei both cried out in shock. That giant’s back was very similar to Wilde’s.

However, when the giant turned around, they were disappointed. This giant had tusks and a single eye. It was quite an ominous appearance. He wasn’t Wilde.

The one-eyed giant roared and swung his hammer again. At this moment, black runes lit up on it, and a violent aura erupted.

When a black qi wave unfurled, the demonic beasts fighting the giant were blasted apart. Only Supreme experts were able to resist, but they were also sent flying.

“Absolutely terrifying! What is this lifeform!?” Jiang Lei jumped in shock. He had never seen such an existence before. Even dozens of Supreme heavenly geniuses were utterly defeated.Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

“He should be from the Netherworld’s Underworld Eye Giant race. It’s a famous existence within the Underworld race. Also, his physical body isn’t even his strongest point. The most terrifying part is his eye,” said Long Chen gravely.

Long Chen had seen some records in the Netherworld of an existence that was very similar to this giant. He was very similar to the Underworld Eye Giant.

Under the Netherworld’s Underworld and Nether race distinction, this person belonged to the Underworld race, while Wu Tian was from the Nether race. Also, the Underworld race viewed Long Chen as a mortal enemy, so this Underworld Eye Giant was definitely one of his strong opponents.

“Long Chen!”

At this moment, the giant sensed Long Chen staring at him. He immediately roared furiously and charged toward Long Chen.
