Chapter 1110 Beat Him Black and Blue With Your Words

Translator: BornToBe

The huge claw came smashing toward Long Chen and Meng Qi. The two of them both knew they had been noticed, and Long Chen was just about to summon the Green Dragon Battle Armor and run.

“Don’t waste time because of two ants. Chasing the traitor is more important.” The two-headed python let out a cold shout. Its scales let out a burst of light, and it disappeared.

The winged tiger seemed to be very intimidated by the two-headed python, and it also followed, instantly disappearing.

Long Chen and Meng Qi both sighed with relief. Long Chen viciously spat out, “How stimulating.”

Of course it was stimulating, so stimulating that it felt like they might die. Just now, Long Chen’s heart had almost risen into his throat. Just thinking about what had just happened gave him bursts of lingering fear.

“Let’s go. We’re not spending another moment here.”

Long Chen pulled away Meng Qi. They no longer bothered with trying to get a late ninth rank Magical Beast. They randomly picked a mid ninth rank one and went straight back to the Xuantian Dao Sect.

Their journey back was much quicker. Meng Qi had obtained a late ninth rank flying Magical Beast, and it only took them a day to return.

When they returned to the Xuantian Dao Sect, Meng Qi and Long Chen exchanged a look. Their tense nerves finally relaxed. This time, they had really been scared witless. That had been too dangerous.

They had only just reached the gate when an Elder came over to inspect their badges. This was a strict rule that no one was an exception to. Even though they recognized Long Chen, they had to check.

But Long Chen hadn’t even handed over his badge yet when rumbling filled the air. A huge flying boat flew right up to the gate.

The Elder’s expression immediately changed and he coldly demanded, “Who dares to barge into my Xuantian Dao Sect?!”

The Elder tightly held a jade talisman. That was an alert talisman. As soon as it was crushed, the entire Xuantian Dao Sect would enter the state of high alert. All the grand formations would be activated.

Long Chen and Meng Qi were startled. They quietly looked at that huge boat floating in the air. What was going on?

If it was an enemy, they wouldn’t simply stop and would have charged in. But if they were guests, why would the flying boat directly enter a restricted area? That was clearly a provocation.

The flying boat opened and a long staircase descended. A middle-aged man slowly walked out.

Dozens of young disciples followed behind him. There were men and women, and they were all Foundation Forging experts. However, their auras clearly showed that they were at the early Foundation Forging realm.

They wore violet robes, and their collars and sleeves all had golden threads embroidered into them. Those golden threads formed special designs that should be runes.

The golden threads also formed a large immortal character on their chests - Magic.

Each disciple held a staff in their hand. Countless thumb-sized crystals were embedded into every staff’s head.

Long Chen and Meng Qi were both surprised. Those crystals were Magical Beast cores that had been compressed using some spatial art.

These disciples’ actual auras were weak, yet they seemed to merge with heaven and earth. However, there was a clear difference from how other Celestials could merge with heaven and earth.

For other Celestials, merging with heaven and earth was a kind of realm and state. But these people seemed to be one with heaven and earth, seeming like they could connect with the natural energy around here at will.

“The Heaven Suppressing Magic Sect.”

The Xuantian Dao Sect’s Elders recognized the origin of these people from their robes. They narrowed their eyes.

The Central Plains’ three grand heavenly sects were the Heaven Splitting Battle Sect, the Xuantian Dao Sect, as well as the sect these people came from, the Heaven Suppressing Magic Sect.”

“Your precious guests have arrived, so what are you just standing there for? The Xuantian Dao Sect truly declines generation after generation,” said the middle-aged man, shaking his head with ridicule.

His voice rumbled through the air, shaking the surrounding mountains. It resounded throughout the entire Xuantian Dao Sect.

“Long Chen, beat him with your words! Beat him black and blue!”

Long Chen was still shocked by this middle-aged man’s cultivation base when the Xuan Master’s voice rang out in his head.

He almost laughed upon hearing this. It just so happened he specialized in infuriating others. He walked to the side of the Elder, acting like an unparalleled young master. He looked up and down the middle-aged man a few times and said, “Precious guests? Just how precious? How much gold per pound?”

“Courting death! Brat, you don’t have the qualifications to speak in front of the Magic Master! Scram!” One of the disciples behind the middle-aged man immediately roared.

“Idiot, you ran over here, strutting your power to be posers, but I don’t have the qualifications to speak? Did you get crap in your head? Furthermore, guests should act like guests. What are you doing being such posers? I’m sorry, but the Xuantian Dao Sect’s little temple can’t handle such huge posers like you. Go back wherever you came from.” Long Chen waved his hand with a disgusted expression, as if he was expelling some irritating flies.

Considering the Xuan Master had personally spoken to him, how could Long Chen not understand? At first, when he had heard that the Xuantian Dao Sect didn’t get along with the Heaven Suppressing Magic Sect, he hadn’t quite believed it.

But now seeing how tyrannical they were acting, and adding in the Xuan Master’s message, he could guess the majority of what was happening. He had seen this same kind of play occur many times.

He had originally found these people disagreeable, as after all, he was a member of the Xuantian Dao Sect. He still had some feeling for the sect’s honor. For someone to so obviously provoke the sect, he was naturally irritated. But with the Xuan Master’s support, he was like a tiger with wings.

“Junior, pay attention to your tone. Is this how your Xuantian Dao Sect treats its guests?” The middle-aged man’s expression sank, but he still acted calm.

He couldn’t act angry. That was due to his status and bearing. If he did get angry at Long Chen, he would lose status. After all, the two of them were like heaven and earth in terms of status.

His voice still wasn’t loud, but it seemed to be backed by a magical art and echoed throughout the entire Xuantian Dao Sect. He was intentionally alerting the higher-ups.

“My Xuantian Dao Sect is polite and respectful to our guests, but our etiquette varies for different people. To a humble gentleman, we will naturally receive them politely. To posers harboring sinister thoughts, the sect’s motto is: posers need to be beaten to break them of the habit!” said Long Chen.

The middle-aged man’s face turned dark. Long Chen’s mouth was too vicious. Although he was constantly telling himself that this was just a trap and he couldn’t get angry, he couldn’t help it.

As for the disciples behind him, their eyes were all burning with killing intent.

“Brat, count your blessings that the Magic Master is a magnanimous person. Otherwise, you’d be a corpse by now!” said a disciple through clenched teeth.

“Who doesn’t know how to brag? Brat, count your blessings that the Xuan Master is a magnanimous person. Otherwise, once the grand killing formation was activated, you’d all be turned to dust,” replied Long Chen disdainfully.

With just a few words from Long Chen, the Elders in charge of this place were scared witless. Someone had long since gone to report this, but there was still no movement from the higher-ups.

“You...” That disciple was infuriated.

“You, what you? Don’t point at me with your finger. My temper’s not good, so be careful of me slapping you in the face!” declared Long Chen icily. He detested it when people pointed at him while they spoke to him. Those people clearly had no upbringing.

“Li Tianxuan, what do you think you’re doing?!”

The middle-aged man finally couldn’t bear it any longer. His furious roar shook the nine heavens, and Long Chen felt his ears buzzing. He could no longer hear anything.

That made Long Chen’s expression change. As expected, Meng Qi was now pale, covering her ears with her hands. Blood was slowly flowing down from them.

Long Chen was infuriated. He was just about to erupt in a burst of curses when he was held back by Meng Qi. Her injury was nothing, while this person was clearly a terrifying existence. She was worried about him.

“Ma Xingkong, your temper is as fiery as ever. Don’t you think it’s rude to disturb people in seclusion?” The Xuan Master’s voice finally rang out. His voice was neither overbearing nor servile. Instead, he seemed graceful and poised.

“Open the gates. Invite the precious guests from the Heaven Suppressing Magic Sect in,” said the Xuan Master. This phrase, precious guests, normally didn’t mean much. But after how Long Chen had used it, the middle-aged man and the disciples behind him felt that its meaning had distorted.

The middle-aged man snorted. He knew Li Tianxuan wouldn’t possibly come to the gates to greet him. He led his people inside, and the Elders in charge hastily got out of their way.

“Brat, just wait.”

Long Chen and Meng Qi were also out of the way, allowing the Heaven Suppressing Magic Sect’s people to pass. The middle-aged man didn’t look at Long Chen, but the young disciple who had spoken with him did. He pointed at Long Chen’s nose arrogantly.

“Fuck your mother, you don’t learn, do you?!”

Long Chen immediately slapped that person across the face. Apparently, this person had never imagined that Long Chen would dare to strike him here. He was completely off-guard, and furthermore, even if he had been expecting it, there was no way he could dodge at such a short distance. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

The disciple let out a miserable cry as he was sent flying. His whole face caved in, and it was just a bit off from his head exploding.

“How weak.” Long Chen was surprised. He hadn’t used that much power in this attack, but he had almost slapped this disciple dead. He suddenly recalled that the Heaven Suppressing Magic Sect’s disciples all specialized in magical arts, making their physical bodies weaker than average. This slap proved just how weak their bodies were.

“Bastard, you dare to attack us?! Die!”

The Heaven Suppressing Magic Sect’s disciples immediately erupted in fury. They all waved their staves, and Long Chen felt dozens of terrifying auras lock onto him.
