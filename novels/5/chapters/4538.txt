Chapter 4527 Treat Me Like the Sole of a Shoe

The blonde woman was stunned, not expecting her attack to strike the red-haired man so perfectly. After all, despite their numerous battles, this was her first time dealing such a serious wound to the red-haired man.

The fact that this seemingly random attack had inflicted such a devastating blow left her befuddled, but the red-haired man was even more dumbfounded than her. When Long Chen’s hand slapped his face, its immense power broke his bones, causing half of his face to cave in.

Blood sprayed out of his mouth as he was sent flying. When he landed on the ground, everyone could see a giant hole in his chest and his half-crushed face—a scene that stunned the Heavenly Corrupt Sect and the mixed beast race’s experts.

“How many times have I told you that violence isn’t good?! Listen to my advice, and you’ll live a long life! I asked you to give me face, but you treat me like the sole of a shoe!” Long Chen scolded him with profound disappointment.

Although Long Chen’s accurate calculations managed to con the red-haired man, he was also stunned. To his surprise, the blonde woman’s attack couldn’t shake the red-haired man’s golden fate lines.

In other words, although she was capable of defeating him, no one could kill him at this moment. He had to have some life-saving trump cards up his sleeve.

Originally, Long Chen had been confident that he would be able to launch a follow-up attack and end the red-haired man’s life.

However, the moment the blonde woman’s attack landed, Long Chen’s thoughts changed. If they couldn’t slay the red-haired man now, he shouldn’t expose his cards. Doing so would only make the next attempt even more challenging.

Thus, he had changed his slash into a slap. While a face-slap lacked killing power, it inflicted a more profound pain than the blow to the chest. After all, mental damage was the most unbearable thing, particularly for someone extremely arrogant like the red-haired man. They would rather be stabbed a hundred times than be slapped in the face.

When the slap landed, all the experts on the battlefield were fully stunned, including the blonde woman. She had never imagined that she would see someone slap the powerful red-haired man in the face.

“Bastard, die! Corrupt God Possession, Nine Revolution Heavenly Soul!”

As expected, the red-haired man went crazy. After all, he didn’t even give face to his sect master, so how could he tolerate a slap in the face?

His roar resonated, shaking the heavens, and his face contorted into a sinister expression. At the same time, the Corrupt God’s figure behind him stirred, as if billions of resentful spirits were bulging within it. In an instant, his aura surged to an unprecedented level.

“Hey, brother, calm down. Don’t be so emotional. We can always talk things out. I really am trying to help you...” Long Chen immediately cowered back upon seeing the red-haired man go insane, putting on a kind, saint-like appearance.

“Dodge!” shouted the blonde woman.

Seeing Long Chen trying to reason with the red-haired man in his berserk state, the blonde woman cursed inside. Did this person have something wrong with his head?

Despite her complaint, she didn’t dare to tarry. A pair of wings spread behind her, accompanied by a phoenix cry and the manifestation of an enormous sea of flames. Her spear then resonated with a rumble as it thrust toward the red-haired man.

The blonde woman and the red-haired man were old opponents. Seeing the other side going all-out, she didn’t dare to hold back anymore and clashed with him at full power.

Their spear and scythe repeatedly clashed, unleashing terrifying ripples that tore through the very void, revealing fragments of spacetime.

“Aiya!”

The impact sent Long Chen flying and shook him. In the midst of his panicked retreat, he lost his grip on the cauldron in his hand, and coincidentally, it flew out and silently struck the head of a Saint from the Heavenly Corrupt Sect.

Engaged in combat with a Saint from the mixed beast race, the Heavenly Corrupt Sect’s Saint was taken completely by surprise.

Stars spun in his eyes, and in that vulnerable state, his opponent seized the opportunity to smash his head, causing a flower of blood to bloom.

“Little fellow, good job!”

The Saint from the mixed beast race gave Long Chen a thumbs-up. After all, eliminating an enemy Saint was a huge deal for him.

“What? What happened? Ah, did I just beat a Saint?” Long Chen acted delighted and laughed, taking all the credit for the victory.

The Saint from the mixed beast race didn’t mind at all; he wasn’t concerned about who received the credit. After all, if it weren’t for Long Chen, he wouldn’t have had a chance to kill his enemy.

After slaying his opponent, the Saint immediately went to reinforce his people.

When Long Chen wanted to grab the Earth Cauldron, it vanished, returning to his spiritual space on its own. After that, he heard a furious roar in his mind.

“How many times have I told you not to use me as a weapon to attack others?! I can only passively defend!”

“Oh! I’m sorry! I forgot!” Long Chen hastily apologized. The Earth Cauldron had repeatedly warned him about this—it couldn’t help him kill people.

It would have been fine before, but ever since the rust on it fell and its runes appeared, it could no longer see any blood.

Long Chen had been only thinking about conning these people, and so he had forgotten about this. Seeing that the Earth Cauldron was truly enraged, he hastily apologized.

The Earth Cauldron only fell silent after Long Chen apologized, and Long Chen was just hovering in the air foolishly with his cauldron gone.

“Damn bastard, you ruined things for my Heavenly Corrupt Sect!” Just then, countless disciples of the Heavenly Corrupt Sect charged at Long Chen.

“Hey, don’t mess around! Every one of us has two shoulders and one head! Why do we kill each other?” Long Chen hastily waved his hands.

“Die!”

One of those disciples sent a blood-red flying shuttle his way. He was a terrifying Doyen whose aura was only the slightest bit weaker than the Doyen of the Lifehunter race.

Along with him, dozens of other experts surrounded Long Chen, attacking him with such intensity as if he had just killed their fathers.

“Hey, if you have to fight, at least fight one-against-one! Don’t use numbers to bully people! Aiya, you’re immoral!” Long Chen dodged left and right, not wanting to expose his true power. He managed to kill two Corrupt experts who had advanced too far, but now that he was surrounded, he was barely hanging on.

“Hold on! I will save you soon!” shouted the blonde woman as she exchanged full-power blows with the red-haired man.

“Ugh, give up! You can’t kill him, so don’t waste the effort!” Long Chen sighed inside. If that wasn’t the case, he’d have long since helped her kill him.

Seeing that Long Chen was in danger, the mixed beast race started to move to his side, wanting to help him escape.

“Not good!”

All of a sudden, Long Chen felt a chill and swiftly retrieved a black formation disc in his hand. Just then, a giant hand appeared in the air.

BOOM!

The space around Long Chen was instantly crushed, and all lifeforms caught within it were obliterated.
