Chapter 4689 One Disaster on Top of Another

As the white bone horse charged toward the Dragonblood Legion, a terrifying pressure crashed down from it, suffocating people.

“Help Zifeng! Leave this fellow to me!” Guo Ran shouted and appeared before the white bone horse.

“A mantis trying to stop a chariot.” Yin Jiushang’s sneer came from within the war chariot.

BOOM!

Guo Ran then collided against the war chariot, causing the white bone horse to flip. The chariot now had a human-shaped imprint on it.

The impact overturned the war chariot and sent Yin Jiushang flying out of it.

“What?!” This scene stunned everyone.

Yin Jiushang’s attention had been on Long Chen the whole time, and he couldn’t even bother glancing at the Dragonblood warriors. Hence, only when Guo Ran appeared in front of him did he realize how strong Guo Ran’s physical prowess was.

“Earthen Golden Lotus, Ten Thousand Lotuses Shine!”

As Guo Ran blocked Yin Jiushang, Bai Shishi appeared right beside Luo Changsheng with Bai Xiaole’s aid, unleashing a field of golden lotuses that covered the entire battlefield.

“Scram!”

Enraged by this interference, Luo Changsheng summoned surging Blood Qi all around him, shattering the field of golden lotuses with it.

Using a secret technique of the Celestial race, Luo Changsheng harnessed his essence blood to summon Doyen power, creating an impenetrable barrier that could repel powerful attacks.

However, to his surprise, there was a golden sword hiding within those lotuses. By the time he realized it, the sword had already breached his barrier, looming dangerously close behind him.

Caught off guard, Luo Changsheng was shocked and enraged. After a lifetime of scheming against others, he had never anticipated falling victim to someone else’s scheme.

It was all thanks to Bai Xiaole’s pupil arts, which could conceal Bai Shishi’s aura and trick Luo Changsheng’s senses.

Luo Changsheng instinctively dodged this killing blow. However, as he did, he had to cease his relentless assault, which enabled Yue Zifeng to launch a terrifying counterattack.

His sword then descended with lethal precision, slicing through Luo Changsheng’s throat, just a bit away from beheading him.

Following that, two explosive sounds rang out as Yue Zifeng and Bai Shishi’s swords struck Luo Changsheng’s bone claw. Luo Changsheng had once more transformed into a tortoise in a shell. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

Just as Bai Shishi was about to see if she could force the bone claw open with her metal energy, Yue Zifeng shouted, “Don’t force it!”

At this time, the Dragonblood warriors had already rushed over, so the two of them quickly rejoined their ranks.

“Save Guo Ran!”

With Yue Zifeng back, they immediately rushed toward Guo Ran. They knew they couldn’t go all out as they were under siege and had to fight as a cohesive unit. After all, the worst case would be for them to be picked off one by one by their enemies.

“Don’t mind me... I can get over to you—”

Just as Guo Ran tried to reassure them, a giant figure appeared behind him, looking like a butcher with eyes brimming with killing intent. His bald head gleamed in the light, devoid of any hair. The moment he appeared, he delivered a devastating punch on Guo Ran’s back.

The sickening crunch of breaking bones echoed through the air as Guo Ran was sent reeling, blood spewing from his lips.

“This little bit of defense is nothing in front of me.” The large bald man sneered disdainfully at Guo Ran.

“Die.”

With a single step, he appeared above Guo Ran, stamping on his head.

Luckily, before his foot could land, Guo Ran had mysteriously vanished.

“Eh?”

He then turned toward the Dragonblood Legion to see Guo Ran amongst their ranks.

He could also see Bai Xiaole and the Violet Pupil Nine Tail Fox release their hand seals while sighing in relief. They were barely able to pull Guo Ran back in time.

Guo Ran had overestimated his defense too much. If he had been a bit more careful, he wouldn’t have been injured so badly.

The healing warriors quickly used their techniques on him to help him recover. At this moment, all the Dragonblood warriors looked somewhat grave. This bald man was extremely powerful, but he had not revealed any of this power during the tribulation. As a result, no one had noticed him. Just like the Lifehunter race’s Ying Tian, he had been concealing himself until the opportune moment.

“Wu Hun, come at me if you have the guts!” Long Chen’s furious roar came from within the tribulation.

This large bald man was Wu Hun. While he looked like a brash man, he actually knew how to be patient and wait for his chance. Even Long Chen hadn’t expected him to be in the tribulation.

“I also want to come at you. However, since you can’t come out now, I can’t attack you either. You should know that I didn’t show myself because I didn’t want other small fries getting in my way. Anyway, we will fight sooner or later, so I’ll just kill some of your friends first. That will deepen your hatred toward me. This way, you won’t run in fear once we start fighting.” Wu Hun laughed sinisterly.

Even Luo Changsheng and the others were startled by his appearance, not expecting such a terrifying fellow to be hidden within their ranks.

Seeing the condition of Yin Jiushang’s bone horse and chariot, everyone knew just how terrifying Guo Ran’s defenses were. Until now, many had believed that Guo Ran was impervious to harm, but Wu Hun’s attack had shattered that assumption.

Moreover, Wu Hun had come very close to ending Guo Ran’s life. Such a demonstration of power left even Luo Changsheng and the others dumbfounded.

“Coward, you were hiding all this time because you wanted to gauge my strength first! Just say that you are afraid of me crushing you after my tribulation, so you just vent your hatred on my comrades. Isn’t that right? A coward like you think you can become the heir of the Three-Headed Heaven Devouring Beast’s inheritance? What a joke! The Three-Headed Heaven Devouring Beast race is full of straightforward and upright men, not cowardly scoundrels like you!” sneered Long Chen.

“You are courting death!”

Indeed, Long Chen’s words directly fueled Wu Hun’s anger.

“How can you call yourself the bloodline heir of the Three-Headed Heaven Devouring Beast when your blood is that dirty? You’re nothing more than a trashy half-breed!” Seeing his reaction, Long Chen continued to throw some oil on the burning Wu Hun.

Thanks to his allies’ help, Long Chen’s life was no longer in danger. After holding on for a bit, he would be able to blast this Heaven Earth Cauldron’s replica apart and become a Divine Venerate.

Time was of the utmost importance to Long Chen. Thus, he repeatedly taunted Wu Hun to distract him from harming his people.

“You are blaspheming the Three-Headed Heaven Devouring Beast race! I’ll make you regret being born in this world! Now, I’ll let you watch all of your friends dying miserably!”

Wu Hun roared and appeared above the Dragonblood Legion with a single step, unleashing a devastating fist aimed squarely at his target below.
