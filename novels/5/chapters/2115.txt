Chapter 2105 Strong Start, Weak Finish

An elder had appeared. He held a walking stick but appeared healthy, and he slowly walked over. Despite his age, his eyes looked like they could see through all things within this world.

“Family head!” Dongfang Yuyang immediately went over to lend an arm to this elder.

Hearing that, everyone immediately bowed. “Greetings, family head.”

The elder nodded slightly, indicating that there was no need to be so courteous. His cultivation base was not apparent, but due to his status, no one dared to slight him as the head of an everlasting family.

He walked over to Zhao Wuji. Zhao Wuji was covered in blood, and there were still pieces missing from his body. Because his armor was part of him, it was difficult for him to heal from any injuries. Even his Heavenly Dao energy was only able to stop the bleeding but not restore his flesh.

Seeing his injuries, the elder shook his head. “Why bother?”

The elder slowly brushed a hand over Zhao Wuji’s hand. Light flowed out, and Zhao Wuji’s injuries began to rapidly heal.

These injuries that even Heavenly Dao energy couldn’t heal were fixed with a wave of his hand. That shook everyone’s heart. This was clearly wood elemental energy. So the Dongfang family’s head was a wood cultivator.

However, while his injuries healed, the scales that Long Chen had torn off would not be returning. Those scales had already been taken by Long Chen. A third of Zhao Wuji’s armor was gone, and his tail was missing as well.

“Many thanks, family head.” Zhao Wuji hastily said his thanks. However, when he looked at Long Chen, his eyes were filled with rancor.

Long Chen didn’t say a word upon seeing the elder. He just calmly looked at him. But when Zhao Wuji glared over at him, he coldly said, “I’m still waiting to see your foundation. I’m looking forward to it.”

“You... pfft!” Zhao Wuji coughed up a mouthful of blood. Cracks appeared on the injuries that had just healed, showing signs of crumbling entirely. He hastily focused on stabilizing his mental state.

The elder shook his head helplessly. “If there are any words to say, why can’t you sit down and talk amicably? Do you really need to fight to the point of one side dying?”

Long Chen smiled. “Senior is correct in theory, but in reality, there is no way to carry that out. I was invited here by brother Dongfang, so I had no choice but to come. I came precisely with the intention to sit down and talk amicably. But in reality? I encountered a few disciples of the Mechanism Sect on the way here who were in the habit of being tyrannical and wanted to kill me. Then when I got here, I found that the so-called experts aren’t the experts that I imagined. Even if they did once dominate their generation, it was only because their opponents were incompetent. I’m not going to allow people to trample over my dignity.”

Long Chen had already been holding back his frustration from everything that had happened here. The icy arrogance that these so-called peerless geniuses showed him was irritating.

True experts didn’t need to act like that. Did they think haughtiness was what had made the Sovereigns? Sovereign Yun Shang hadn’t shown the slightest arrogance to him.

“You were the one who first provoked my Mechanism Sect! You killed our disciples and stole our treasure! The enmity between us must be paid with blood!” shouted Zhao Wuji.

“Come then. Bring out your so-called foundation and pay the blood debt!” sneered Long Chen.

Zhao Wuji felt his barely suppressed rage soar once more. His injuries almost flared up again. He clenched his teeth so hard that they creaked.

“Alright, Long Chen, just wait. I will destroy your...” Zhao Wuji suddenly found that he didn’t know what to say. Destroy the Xuantian Dao Sect? But Long Chen was no longer a disciple of the Xuantian Dao Sect. Destroy the Martial Heaven Alliance? He didn’t have that courage.

Furthermore, Long Chen was the leader of the Dragonblood Legion, which was an entity outside the Martial Heaven Alliance. Although they were allied, he was not under the command of the Martial Heaven Alliance. He didn’t know what he was supposed to threaten him with.

“Senior, you’ve witnessed it with your own eyes. This fellow is already my mortal enemy. Do you think we can possibly discuss things nicely?” Long Chen shrugged at the elder.

“That’s... probably unlikely.” The elder looked at Zhao Wuji, then at Shi Lingfeng who had one eye missing. He bitterly smiled, shaking his head. “However, let this old man share a bit of advice. People will always have enemies. Sometimes to protect yourself, for peace, and for the future of the entire world, enduring it is what an expert should do.”

“Sorry senior, I’m incapable of that. I’ve never once thought of becoming a Sovereign because I don’t have the heart and kindness of the Sovereigns. I am someone who repays kindness and avenges enmities. If someone treats me well, I’ll repay them. If someone harms me, I’ll repay them as well. So don’t give me your high end principles. The only principle I acknowledge is that anyone who tries to kill me has to be prepared to be killed by me as well,” said Long Chen.

After saying that, Long Chen walked over to Ye Zhiqiu. Holding her hand, he said to Dongfang Yuyang, “Brother Dongfang, sorry for failing to live up to your kindness. It seems I’m not some hero fit for this gathering. If I have a chance, I’ll make up for this some other time. Goodbye.”

“Brother Long...” Dongfang Yuyang tried to stop him, but Long Chen was already leaving.

“Long Chen, just wait! I’ll make you pay a miserable price!” shouted Zhao Wuji.

“I’m still waiting for your foundation,” said Long Chen indifferently.

“Long Chen, return my eye!” roared Shi Lingfeng, ready to charge over.

“If you dare to block me, there will no longer be a Shi Lingfeng in this world,” said Long Chen coldly without even looking back.

“Brother Shi, let him be arrogant for now. Your eye has your aura on it, so you can find him at any time now. We can join hands to destroy him and his Dragonblood Legion.” Zhao Wuji sent a message to Shi Lingfeng.

Shi Lingfeng hesitated after hearing that message. In the end, he chose to trust Zhao Wuji. He felt that what Zhao Wuji said was correct.

However, as a member of the Stone race, he hated when others insulted him by saying he had stone for brains. That was because the Stone race truly had limited intelligence.

He felt that Zhao Wuji’s words were reasonable. However, he completely forgot that when Long Chen had taken his eye, he had lost his connection to that eye and could no longer sense it.

That eye had already been placed into the primal chaos space. There was no way he could sense it. But his brain wasn’t able to think of that problem.

As for Zhao Wuji, he thought that since Shi Lingfeng had accepted his proposal, he was confident in using that eye to find Long Chen. If that was the case, they could capture him easily. Perhaps when they realized the misunderstanding, they would both cough up blood and die from embarrassment. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

“Brother Dongfang, thank you for your warm hospitality. I’ll also be leaving now. Although there’s some displeasure when it comes to Long Chen, I hope that the Dongfang family can have a long friendship with the Martial Heaven Alliance,” said Ye Lingshan. She bowed to the elder and said goodbye to Dongfang Yuyang.

“Junior sister Lingshan, don’t worry, brother Long Chen’s character is simply like this. Many experts are reclusive. I trust that we’ll definitely be able to find a way to work together,” said Dongfang Yuyang.

“Thank you.” Ye Lingshan nodded and followed Long Chen’s footsteps.

Quite a few experts felt a bit odd with Ye Lingshan’s departure. Even if she was weak, she represented the world’s strongest alliance. Now that she was gone, what was the point of this gathering?

The Zither Fairy also rose to say her goodbyes. She had been very low-key here. She had rarely said anything and also hadn’t expressed any of her own opinions. In fact, even when she was invited to play a song during the banquet last night, she had tactfully declined.

This time, it was like she was a green leaf silently accompanying Long Chen. She hadn’t unleashed a trace of her own splendor.

“Sorry, but I have some other things to handle, so I won’t be staying any longer. Thank you to the Dongfang family for hosting this gathering, and thank you brother Dongfang for your kindness.” Hu Feng cupped his fists toward Dongfang Yuyang and left.

“Goodbye.”

Unexpectedly, the Pill Fairy also left after simply spitting out a single word.

“Pill Fairy, why are you in a rush to leave? Without you, this gathering of past and present heroes will lose its splendor,” said Dongfang Yuyang hastily. He hadn’t said anything to the others, but he had no choice when it came to the Pill Fairy.

However, the Pill Fairy shook her head. “I only came here to watch, and it really was a good show. Now that the show’s over, it’s time for me to leave. Ah, but I should mention that when the qi flow eruption occurs, Pill Valley will not be cooperating with anyone nor will we be sharing it. Everyone can just compete using their own abilities. It’s nothing more than natural selection.”

The Pill Fairy also left without turning back. Her words shook people’s hearts. The Pill Fairy was saying that whoever’s fist was harder would get a bigger share over the qi flow eruption. There would be no discussion over that.

People exchanged glances, not knowing what to do. Suddenly, they found that the Bloodkill Hall’s Dong Mingyu had also vanished without anyone noticing.

“We’re also busy, so we’ll take our leave. Family head, brother Dongfang, goodbye.”

Beitang Rushuang and Nangong Zuiyue also left, making Dongfang Yuyang’s expression grow unsightly.

With the two of them leaving as well, the others also said their goodbyes. This grand gathering of past and present heroes had a strong start, but due to Long Chen’s disturbance, it ended just like this.
