Chapter 1574 The Martial Heaven Alliance’s Head Arrives.

Translator: BornToBe

The grand carriage was carried by a giant bird, which slowly flew in front of everyone. When the carriage got closer, people finally recognized its symbol.

It was a symbol of a copper coin with a blue border. It was circular on the outside and had a square inside, representing the image of the Martial Heaven Continent’s Central Plains.

This was the symbol of the Martial Heaven Alliance, and its immortal character for ‘Alliance’ was written in the center of the square. Seeing that character, everyone’s hearts shook.

If one had to compare it, the symbol of the Eastern Xuan Region’s branch alliance had their character imprinted in the spot of the Eastern Xuan Region, on the left side. Thus, for this golden ‘Alliance’ character to be written in the center, it represented the Central Xuan Region’s head alliance.

Four alliance masters from the four branches of the Martial Heaven Alliance could only use silver characters in their symbol. Hence, this golden character explicitly showed the identity of the one in the carriage. Only the Martial Heaven Alliance’s true alliance head was qualified to sit in it.

“The Nine Wing Qilin Eagle!” cried out an expert in shock as he recognized the identity of the bird pulling the carriage.

It was a giant bird covered in scales. There wasn’t a single feather on its body, causing it to appear very bizarre. When it spread its two wings, illusions appeared around them, making it look like there were nine pairs of wings superimposing over each other.

Rumor was that the Nine Wing Qilin Eagle possessed the bloodline of the ancient divine beast, the Qilin. This one was at the eleventh rank, corresponding to the human race’s Life Star realm.

However, all the Life Star experts felt a chill upon seeing it. It was an extremely terrifying existence.

Rumor was that the Nine Wing Qilin Eagle was originally a Xuan Beast, but for some unknown reason, had been expelled from the Xuan Beasts and almost went extinct.

As for this particular Nine Wing Qilin Eagle, its status was special. Even the Xuan Beasts didn’t dare to do anything to it. That was because it had an extremely intimidating master.

It pulled the carriage until it stopped above everyone, and the door to the carriage slowly opened. A beautiful woman in an imperial dress walked out of the carriage, her hair tied up with a violet gold phoenix hairpin.

Everyone’s expressions changed. Many of them had fear and shock in their eyes and involuntarily hid behind Yu Xiaoyun. She was the alliance head of the Martial Heaven Alliance.

She looked to be in her thirties, with sword-like eyebrows and a high nose bridge, appearing both beautiful and heroic. Her formidable appearance would not lose to any man. She looked to be as high and mighty as an empress.

“Did you think hiding behind him would make things fine? Get out here.” The woman glared at the elder hiding behind Yu Xiaoyun. Her bark caused that person to quiver.

He nervously walked out and bowed deeply toward her. “The Eastern Xuan Region’s branch alliance master Zhao Yongqian greets the alliance head.”

Once he said this, everyone confirmed this woman’s identity. Other than a few people, none of them had known who the alliance head of the Martial Heaven Alliance was. The expert in charge of all the Righteous path’s sects was actually a woman.

“Hmph, so you still remember I am the alliance head. Good, good. This time, my seclusion lasted three hundred years. Did you think I was already dead and you could act without any reservations?” demanded the woman. Her gaze was like a sharp blade filled with killing intent.

“Alliance head Qu, this matter-” started Yu Xiaoyun.

“Shut up. This is an internal matter of the Martial Heaven Alliance, and outsiders cannot interfere. If you don’t like it, call out your true body and let’s have a fight!” she shouted.

Long Chen was startled. This alliance head was quite terrifying to not even give face to the valley master. Her temper was also quite explosive. Who would have thought that the Martial Heaven Alliance was actually led by such a tough alliance head?

The valley master’s expression twitched with anger, but he knew that this woman in front of him was a battle-crazed woman. She was the same as the Heaven Splitting Battle Sect’s people. If she wanted to fight, she would fight.

If he pushed her, she would definitely attack. This clone of his wouldn’t be able to fight back against her at all. And since his true body was at a crucial juncture and couldn’t be moved, he had no choice but to endure.

“Yu Xiaoyun, I didn’t think that you would be so shameless as to take advantage of my seclusion. Fortunately, I came out early. Otherwise, if I, Qu Jianying, had stayed in seclusion for another hundred years, wouldn’t the entire Martial Heaven Alliance have been turned into a branch of your Pill Valley?” The woman’s aura began to rise. Her furious killing intent terrified others.

This alliance head was both powerful and domineering. Even in front of experts like the old man, the Xuantian Dao Sect’s patriarch, and the valley master, she was still doing what she wanted.

“Alliance head Qu, what are you talking about?” asked the valley master gloomily.

Qu Jianying waved her hand, tossing out a sack. Even before it landed on the ground, it opened.

There were dozens of heads in the sack, eliciting startled cries. These heads all belonged to Life Star experts.

“What am I talking about? Don’t play this game with me. All the fish you bought have been slaughtered by me, and amongst them were two branch alliance masters. Yu Xiaoyun, you really have some ability. Three of the four branch alliance masters were bought by you. I admire your skills,” sneered Qu Jianying.

When the Eastern Xuan Region’s branch alliance master saw those heads, he turned as pale as paper. He recognized most of these heads and he knew he was about to join them.

The branch alliance master knelt on the ground and begged, “Alliance head, disciple was just possessed, enticed by Pill Valley. But there was nothing I could do! My family’s lives are in their hands-”

“Slander!” Yu Xiaoyun furiously waved his hand, and a powerful gust blew apart the branch alliance master. His soul dissipated.

Yu Xiaoyun had originally been angry just at being summoned. Then, because this was just his clone without the power of his real body, he was continuously suppressed. He had reached his limit. For the branch alliance master to suddenly make such an accusation against him, even though he was slow to anger, he was infuriated.

Perhaps it was true that Pill Valley had bought him, but it had been a mutually beneficial cooperation. The branch alliance master had also benefited greatly. When had Pill Valley ever controlled his family?

Long Chen was refreshed inside. They deserved everything that came to them. It was time for Yu Xiaoyun to taste what it felt like to be framed by others. He had long since grown tired of and indifferent to Pill Valley’s method of smearing his name. However, who could really not care? It was just that there was no way to stop it.

It was just like what Boss Bao had said. Long Chen just had one mouth, while they had billions of them and some were particularly big. He could only accept being accused of the wildest crimes. Saying that he didn’t care was just making himself feel better.

“You’re clearly killing him to shut him up. Yu Xiaoyun, you’re just trying to cover up the truth. I never expected that you, the grand valley master of Pill Valley, would be so despicable. Pill Valley claims to be distanced from the cultivation world, and outside of the struggle between the Righteous and Corrupt paths. But now, you’ve colluded with the Corrupt path, as well as bought the higher-ups of the Martial Heaven Alliance. Just what kind of shameful plot are you scheming?” cried out Long Chen with righteous indignation. It was like he was worried things weren’t chaotic enough.

“That’s right, my boss is right! Just looking at your current sinister and tyrannical appearance, I can tell that you’re a crafty and evil person. Even such a person is fit to be Pill Valley’s master?” Guo Ran joined in. After all, this was the best opportunity to draw attention to himself. A chance to point at Pill Valley’s master and curse him in the nose didn’t come more than once in a lifetime.

Most importantly, this situation was perfect for showing off. It was efficient, quick, painless, and a perfect example of low risk and high reward. Guo Ran naturally wouldn’t let this chance escape.

“You’re all courting death!” Yu Xiaoyun had never been so infuriated in all his years. His aura rose, and black and white energy began to surge out of him. The void shook around him.

Heaven and earth changed color, and a terrifying pressure crashed down, causing everyone’s expressions to change.

Yu Xiaoyun was truly infuriated. All the fury he had been suppressing was being released. He felt like if he tried holding it back any longer, he would explode.

Long Chen was too hateful. Each of his words was extremely humiliating to Yu Xiaoyun. He had completely lost the dignity of Pill Valley’s master.

As Yu Xiaoyun’s crazy aura spread, all the experts shook. They all collapsed on the ground and knelt in fear. That was a kind of respect toward death. Even the neutral camp’s experts were affected and knelt.

Even the Illusive Music Immortal Palace’s disciples were pale and tottering, on the verge of collapse. Only Zi Yan was calmly watching without the slightest expression. It was unknown what she was thinking.

As that aura grew stronger, even Life Star experts quivered as they knelt. They didn’t have the slightest ability to resist.

The black and white energy around Yu Xiaoyun intertwined. The white energy represented life, while the black energy represented death.

He was just like the ruler of life and death. In this space, any life could be taken with just a thought.

This was the terrifying life and death domain of Netherpassage experts. Within this domain, they were rulers. No one could resist.

Long Chen stood calmly as he watched Yu Xiaoyun release his aura. He sensed a kind of energy that had transcended mortal power. Rather than power, this seemed more like a kind of law.

This pressure was useless against Long Chen. It also lost effect against the Dragonblood warriors. They had walked the thin line between life and death countless times and had long since grown accustomed to it. They were indifferent to the fear of death.

This pressure was truly terrifying, but in the end, it came from one man. On the other hand, they had repeatedly gone against heavenly tribulation. They had faced heavenly pressure. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

Seeing the Life Star experts kneeling, the Dragonblood warriors were filled with pride. Long Chen had made them continuously go against their heavenly tribulations, and now they were reaping the rewards. Each of them could look down arrogantly on these people.

“Boss, help me... I... I don’t think I can hold on any longer,” said Guo Ran, his body twitching.
