Chapter 4714 Unparalleled in Tongue and Might

A new group of seven people appeared, led by a powerful Sage King. Although he reserved his aura, a powerful pressure still exuded from him.

There were six youngsters behind him, four men and two women. All of them seemed somewhat weary from a long journey, but their gazes still arrogantly swept over their surroundings. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

All seven of them were wearing white robes that fluttered in the breeze, looking very eye-catching. The Sage King talking to Long Chen stared at them in shock.

“I am Long Chen. May I ask what you want?”

Long Chen’s heart shook when he saw this group. Even without this Sage King’s reaction, he could sense a familiar aura from these people’s bloodline fluctuations. He could tell what their origin was.

“You are Long Chen?”

Those six youngsters stared at Long Chen in disbelief, looking him up and down. In comparison, the two women’s eyes brightened, but the four men had stubborn expressions.

“Ten of us braved the sea of broken stars, three died, and it was all to see him?” said one of the men, anger apparent in his tone.

“Did I tell you to come? If you don’t want to stay, you can just fuck off!” declared Long Chen.

Ever since Evilmoon returned, Long Chen’s domineering character had gradually come back. Now, he specialized in treating arrogant people who stubbornly refused to correct their ways.

“You...”

“Silence!” that elder shouted at the young man and then turned to Long Chen with a smile. “Let me introduce myself. This friend was correct. We are from the Sovereign Emperor Heaven’s Heavenly Desolation World, and its seven hundred and thirty-six prefectures are all under the command of our Long clan. This old man is nothing more than an administrator in charge of dealing with affairs outside of the clan. To put it frankly, I am just an errand boy.”

The elder’s tone was very calm and humble. However, this humility was backed by the power of the strong Sage King, instilling in others a sense of inferiority beyond comprehension.

Long Chen acknowledged the elder's presence with a nod of approval. “You’ve traveled quite a distance. Why don't you take a moment to rest inside the academy?”

“Then we’ll trouble you!” The elder followed Long Chen into the academy.

“Was there a fight just now? Who would attack the most ancient academy within the nine heavens and ten lands? Which insect would dare to offend the High Firmament Academy’s prestige?” asked the elder, pretending to look around.

Keep acting. Long Chen snorted inside. The elder’s indirect question was a tactic that forced the academy to provide them with an answer.

Long Chen didn’t like this kind of questioning, but he had to say that this elder’s way of asking was quite skillful.

“I’m not too sure. I heard that they come from Heavenly Province or something like that,” replied Long Chen.

“The Heavenly Province?!”

The elder’s expression changed. The six youngsters even cried out in shock, not believing their ears.

“They personally admitted that they were from the Lifehunter race?” asked the elder.

“No. I guessed past their concealing art,” answered Long Chen, not wanting to dwell too long on this topic.

“Tch, so it was a guess,” sneered one of the young men.

“Xiuyang, fix your attitude!” shouted the elder. After chastising that man, he turned back to Long Chen. “I’m truly sorry. This child has never left the Heavenly Desolation World and has been pampered all his life. He has so little life experience. Please don’t lower yourself to his level!”

Long Chen snorted inside. This old fellow wanted to play this game with him? Long Chen simply shot him a sinister smile. At first, he had felt that this elder was alright, but now it seemed that he wanted to play as well.

By saying it like this, if Long Chen were to argue, it would be like he, as the dean, was arguing with a child. In other words, this elder had elevated Long Chen to the point that he could no longer beat that fellow called Xiuyang.

If Long Chen didn’t show them that he could crush them at their game, they wouldn’t know that Boss Long San was unparalleled in the way of sword and tongue.

“You’re right. How could I argue with a child? That would be looking down on myself,” replied Long Chen with a slight smile.

Hearing that, the elder returned his smile, looking just like a wily old fox playing a game. As for that man called Xiuyang, he didn’t seem too happy. But with one glare from the elder, he fell silent.

Long Chen led them into a side room. Seeing that Long Chen wasn’t leading them to a main hall but some small room instead, the elder looked a bit pissed. However, he didn’t say anything.

When a female attendant came forward, Long Chen gave her some instructions. “Go steep some good tea. Wait, also...”

Long Chen suddenly thought of something and whispered into her ear. She was baffled but simply nodded and left.

“Dean Long Chen, you are so talented at such a young age. I heard that you are the High Firmament Academy’s youngest branch dean in history. I wonder, does the academy have some rule that branch deans cannot accept guests in the main hall?” asked the elder finally.

This time, his words were no longer as skillful. Long Chen chortled inside, knowing that this old fellow was unhappy.

“No, although I am just a branch dean, the main dean is not present at the moment, so everything I say counts. You came to find me for a personal matter, correct? The main hall is for official business. May I ask if I am correct that you came to find me, not for some matter with the High Firmament Academy?” asked Long Chen.

“Ah... Of course we came to see Dean Long Chen. Cough, you are right, this is a personal matter. It wouldn’t be right to mix it with official business. Dean Long Chen is wise. I admire you,” replied the elder with an awkward laugh.

Long Chen smiled widely. Little lamb, if you want to play with me, then my goal isn’t to play with you but to play you to death. Don’t think that your age makes you skilled. Boss Long San is the real ancestor of this game.

At this time, the attendant returned with a tray. She gave them seven elegant tea cups and one strange bottle.

The attendant ended up giving that bottle to the fellow called Xiuyang. Xiuyang was baffled. He then opened the bottle and sniffed it.

“What is this?”

The attendant answered, “It’s milk!”

“Why was everyone else given tea, and I’m given milk?!” demanded Xiuyang.

“What kind of child drinks tea? Be a good boy and drink your milk,” answered that attendant with an undeniable disdainful tone.

“You are courting death!” Xiuyang roared furiously. Even an attendant dared to humiliate him like this? He raised the bottle and wanted to smash it at her face.

However, the attendant was far faster than him, and a palm struck him in the face, sending him tumbling back.
