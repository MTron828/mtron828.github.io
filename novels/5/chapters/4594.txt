Chapter 4583 The Terrifying Netherdragon Tianzhao

When Long Chen swung his hand, that Netherdragon expert roared and shot at Long Chen like a bolt of lightning.

His reactions weren’t slow; he just didn’t think that anyone would dare to attack Netherdragon Tianzhao in this place.

After all, there were millions of experts of the Netherdragon race here, and they would tear apart such a person. In his mind, no one would be so foolish as to do so.

Other than that, Long Chen possessed no killing intent and had repeatedly gestured that he had no malice toward Netherdragon Tianzhao.

To not disturb Netherdragon Tianzhao, that expert had only repeatedly warned Long Chen. He hadn’t expected Long Chen to really dare to attack.

The moment he pounced, Long Chen had slapped Netherdragon Tianzhao’s face. After that, an immense explosive sound rang out, and the entire Ten Thousand Dragon Nest quivered.

To Long Chen’s surprise, the moment that his hand was about to come into contact with Netherdragon Tianzhao’s face, the latter’s black dragon scales flashed, and a protective layer of divine light appeared on top of him.

Long Chen’s hand then struck the divine light and bounced back. However, the impact of his blow still transmitted through, sending Netherdragon Tianzhao flying.

Netherdragon Tianzhao spat out a mouthful of blood. This slap might not cause any substantial wounds on him, but he was in the midst of communing with his ancestral scale. Being interrupted now caused his Blood Qi to run rampant inside him, almost blowing him apart.

“Long Chen!”

When Netherdragon Tianzhao stabilized himself and saw Long Chen standing there, his eyes instantly turned scarlet, and his killing intent exploded to the peak.

Long Chen swayed, dodging the first Netherdragon expert’s attack and shrugging at Netherdragon Tianzhao innocently. “Why are you clenching your teeth like that? I was worried that falling asleep would affect your ability to absorb the ancestral scale’s energy.”

At this moment, the surrounding experts of the Netherdragon race were startled awake from their meditative state. Seeing that Long Chen had interrupted Netherdragon Tianzhao’s merger, they were enraged and took out millions of weapons.

“Seal the exits! I will tear him apart today!” Netherdragon Tianzhao roared. The Netherdragon race’s experts directly flooded toward four exits, leaving this hall to just the two of them.

“Long Chen...” Netherdragon Tianzhao clenched his teeth furiously like he wanted to tear Long Chen apart with his teeth. “I’ll return the humiliation you gave me in our last battle a thousand times.”

Netherdragon Tianzhao’s words startled the experts of the Netherdragon race. After all, Netherdragon Tianzhao was like a god in their hearts, and no one in the Netherdragon race could compete with him.

However, from his words, it seemed that he had lost to Long Chen. They almost couldn’t believe their ears.

In truth, the faction of the Netherdragon race that Long Chen had confronted when he first met the white dragon race was present. However, they had not dared to pass Long Chen’s words.

They merely reported that an individual named Long Chen had slain their leader but did not disseminate this information widely. Only Netherdragon Tianzhao knew of this.

Additionally, they chose not to relay Long Chen’s provocative message to “wash his filthy neck and wait” out of fear that it would further enrage Netherdragon Tianzhao and lead to their own demise.

Thus, only a few people knew Long Chen’s name, and none of them knew of Long Chen and Netherdragon Tianzhao’s enmity until now.

“How can I take back what I’ve given you? That’s not my style. You can keep the humiliation,” said Long Chen as if he were a generous guest.

Netherdragon Tianzhao glared at him gloomily. Ignoring Long Chen’s teasing, he said, “Do you know what kind of pain I went through after sacrificing myself to the Nether Emperor? I almost gave up when I was pushed to the brink. But every time I thought about you, I gritted my teeth and persevered.”

“Sorry, but I’m not into men,” answered Long Chen in a solemn tone.

“I wasn’t willing to die like that. I am the Nether Emperor’s son, the heir to the Netherdragon race. How could I lose to someone like you who’s half human and half dragon? I have to personally kill you. I will make you endure the worst pain of your life to show the world who the real king is!”

Netherdragon Tianzhao’s voice intensified until it was like raging thunder throughout the dragon nest, shaking everyone’s ears.

“The Nether Emperor’s blessing ensured that I encountered you before someone else could kill you! Today is the day of my vengeance!” declared Netherdragon Tianzhao, brandishing a black dragon spear. A mighty dragon roar reverberated through the dragon nest, and Long Chen sensed the aura of an ancient Netherdragon fixating its gaze upon him.

“Take out your cauldron! Let me see just how strong that so-called Heaven Earth Cauldron really is!” shouted Netherdragon Tianzhao.

Long Chen’s heart trembled at the sight of the spear. This fellow had previously suffered at the hands of the Earth Cauldron, and this time, he wanted Long Chen to take it out right at the start? He seemed fearless toward it, which made Long Chen cautious.

The Heaven Earth Cauldron was one of the ten great primal chaos divine items. What weapon could possibly beat it? Yet this fellow dared to challenge it directly, a move that defied logic.

“Against you? Nah, I don’t need to dirty the Heaven Earth Cauldron with your filth.”

Long Chen extended his hand, summoning a blood-colored saber into his grip. He aimed the blade at Netherdragon Tianzhao, and a wild hurricane of energy surged around him.

“The confidence of a fool will only hasten your defeat!” Netherdragon Tianzhao retorted.

Netherdragon Tianzhao roared and lunged forward, his black dragon spear booming as it thrust toward Long Chen. Dragon scales materialized atop the spear, and a formidable power erupted from it.

“Careful. That’s the tooth of an ancestral dragon.” The Earth Cauldron’s warning rang out in Long Chen’s mind.

Indeed, the black dragon spear emanated an intense aura of death, leaving Long Chen with no room for hesitation. He swiftly summoned the Seven Star Battle Armor, enveloping himself in its protective embrace. Meanwhile, his saber began to glow with the radiance of stars.

BOOM!

A wild qi wave erupted, accompanied by the resonating cry of a dragon. Long Chen felt the overwhelming force blast him backward, causing his arms to tremble as he was forced to retreat seven steps. Each step left a deep imprint in the ground, and cracks spidered out from the impact.

“How can you possess such terrifying power?” exclaimed Long Chen, a mixture of shock and anger evident in his voice.

“Fool, do you think that I’m the same Netherdragon Tianzhao!? Face your death!” shouted Netherdragon Tianzhao, his manifestation appearing behind him. Within it, a colossal black dragon emerged. With a shake of the spear, Netherdragon Tianzhao’s manifestation went into the weapon. After that, he launched another attack, the aura of his spear ten times more formidable than before.
