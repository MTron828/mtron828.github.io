Chapter 3371 Conning a God

“What’s the gamble?” asked Tuo Ming. He was unclear on what Long Chen was thinking, but he was afraid of Long Chen simply dragging everyone down with him.

Long Chen said that they had spent two days getting ready to leave the destroyed castle. That sounded very logical. If he really did that, then they wouldn’t be able to get anything at all.

He had lost so many subordinates. If he was still unable to capture this place, he wouldn’t have a good time in the future. Others might even devour his land. So, the current him could not leave here with nothing.

If it weren’t for the expert with dual hatchets on his back having a certain relationship with him, he wouldn’t have dared to request aid from him. Otherwise, whoever he cooperated with might devour him as well.DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

Thus, Long Chen had truly caught him in a painful position. Although Long Chen didn’t know where Tuo Ming’s territory was, he knew that this fellow viewed this area as a must-have. Tuo Ming had paid far too much to claim it.

“It’s very simple. One of you will come out and have a fair fight against one of us. That will decide who will get this world. If you win, we will give you this world. This divine core will then be directly bestowed upon you, while we return to our old home,” said Long Chen.

“And if we lose?” Tuo Ming narrowed his eyes.

“If you lose, swear on your souls to never attack this place again. At the same time, leave behind half your people as slaves for us,” said Long Chen indifferently.

“What nonsense! We are clearly in a superior position! Why would we need to gamble?!” sneered the dual wielding hatchet Nether King.

“Of course. You don’t need to accept. We’ll just crush the divine core and everyone can leave with nothing,” said Long Chen completely indifferently.

“Don’t waste words with this brat. You can tell he’s a bad person with just a glance. He definitely has some scheme. Perhaps he’s just stalling for time,” transmitted the hatchet wielder to Tuo Ming.

In his opinion, they had absolute power. They could crush Long Chen and the others, so they should just launch an explosive attack.

Even if Long Chen detonated the divine core, with so many of them here, they would be able to reconstruct it within a few hours. Hence, this threat wasn’t taken seriously by him.

Tuo Ming looked at Long Chen; his heart thudded. He then replied, “Better safe than sorry. After two days of preparation, they have definitely come up with something. If we really forcibly attack and they detonate the divine core, the destructive power will be immense. If it draws over other powers while we have yet to condense a new divine core, all our efforts will go to waste.”

Tuo Ming was naturally more cautious because he had already lost so much. This place was very important to him. He had no choice but to be cautious.

“Then what can we do?” demanded the hatchet wielder. He clearly wasn’t an expert that used schemes to obtain what he wanted. Perhaps that was precisely why Tuo Ming had chosen to ally with him.

“Placate him. Agree to gamble. I’ve ordered people to secretly start digging. As long as we have enough time, we can completely destabilize their formation without anyone being the wiser. With the loss of their formation, Leng Yueyan and Ming Cangyue can be instantly killed. Even if we can’t stop them from detonating the divine core, we can definitely collect the majority of the core’s runes, which allows us to condense a new core in just two hours at most. Then we won’t need to worry about others coming,” transmitted Tuo Ming.

“Fine, we’ll do as you say. I’ll step forward and you can make your arrangements.” The hatchet wielding Nether King didn’t find any flaw in Tuo Ming’s plan, so he stepped forward.

“Brat, come! Who are you sending from your side?!” shouted the hatchet expert.

Tuo Ming cursed inside. Was this fellow an idiot? Just now, he had been completely against this gamble, and now he simply ran out. Wasn’t that telling them that both of them had a plan? It would be strange if their enemies didn’t suspect anything.

“I’ll take you.”

However, before Tuo Ming could think of some way to reduce their suspicion, Ming Cangyue stepped out.

“Remember, don’t be in a rush to defeat her,” transmitted Tuo Ming.

BOOM!

However, just as he said this, the two of them clashed. Ming Cangyue started off with a full-power attack and the hatchet wielder roared. His hatchets blazed with divine light as he blocked Ming Cangyue’s bone sword.

A huge explosion caused giant spatial fluctuations. After that, both sides were blown back and the hatchet wielder almost coughed up blood. Having heard Tuo Ming’s instructions, he hadn’t gone all-out in that exchange. But Ming Cangyue hadn’t held back in the slightest.

Just as he was swallowing down the sweet sensation rising in his throat, a silent arrow shot through his shoulder. As a result, blood exploded out of his shoulder, and his divine light armor became completely ineffective.

“Bastard!”

The sudden sneak attack caught him off guard, and sharp pain wracked his shoulder. At the same time, he felt his divine qi stagnate for a moment.

In that one moment of sluggishness, an ancient sword cut off his head from the rear.

That head had just flown up when Ming Cangyue’s sword pierced it. After that, divine light exploded. A Heaven tier Nether King was slain just like that.

The void then twisted and Leng Yueyan’s figure slowly appeared. She was the one to cut off his head.

“Well done!” Long Chen was filled with praise. Changgong Hao’s arrow was shot at just the right time, catching that Nether King off guard and working together with Ming Cangyue and Leng Yueyan.

Changgong Hao was a masterful archer. He took advantage of when that Nether King was unsteady, shaken by Ming Cangyue’s full-power attack. Furthermore, Changgong Hao aimed for his shoulder and not his head, making it more difficult for his enemy to sense it.

This arrow contained the power of time and life energy. Under the effects of both powers, that Nether King’s reactions turned sluggish. Then Ming Cangyue charged at him, while the true killing blow was Leng Yueyan hiding in the void. Let alone this foolish expert whose head was very simple, even if he were an expert schemer, he would still easily fall for this trap.

With his companion slain, Tuo Ming was shocked, enraged, and terrified. He didn’t dare to believe his eyes. He looked at Long Chen and saw Leng Yueyan standing right there.

Seeing him looking over, Long Chen smiled and looked at the Leng Yueyan beside him. That Leng Yueyan also smiled and suddenly transformed into lightning runes.

“A fake?! You’re quite sinister!” Only then did Tuo Ming realize just what kind of sinister scheme he had fallen for.

“Kill!”

Just then, in the distance, hundreds of mountains exploded. Countless black-armored experts appeared, unleashing a rain of arrows.
