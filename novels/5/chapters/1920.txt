Chapter 1910 Heaven-Shaking Bone Sword

Translator: BornToBe

BOOM!

A powerful qi wave exploded. The huge blood blade was actually forced back by the seemingly ordinary bone sword.

Everyone was stunned, and they stared at the figure that had appeared.

She was a peerless beauty, looking like a masterpiece crafted by a god. Staring into her sapphire eyes was like staring into the deep blue sea.

Her beauty was such that there was no flaw to pick out. Even the hair of her left and right eyebrows were perfectly symmetrical.

The curves of her body weren’t too big or too small. Her beauty was such that it made people forget to breathe. It was a beauty that should not exist in this world.

However, that beautiful face was icy, and killing intent surrounded her. She wasn’t intentionally releasing that killing intent. It was simply part of her, part of her flesh, part of her bones, and part of her soul. It was like she lived to kill.

Although she was a peerless beauty, no one dared to look at her directly. It was like just looking at her was putting their lives in danger.

“Leng Yueyan, what are you doing?!” roared Xie Luo, shocked and infuriated.

This woman was the one with the most perfect body, the most perfect face, the coldblooded and merciless Leng Yueyan.

“I’m not doing anything. I owed Long Chen two debts. I paid him back one, and now I’m paying back the other. So, if you don’t want to die, scram.”

Leng Yueyan’s sapphire eyes were completely calm. Her voice contained unquestionable resolve. She was like a supreme empress, a superior being that no one else could contest.

Long Chen slowly rose and looked at Leng Yueyan. He felt conflicting feelings. He couldn’t say exactly what he was feeling upon seeing her. This action of Leng Yueyan’s was definitely betraying the Corrupt path.

“Yueyan, get out of the way. This matter has nothing to do with you.” Long Chen took a deep breath. His spiritual yuan circulated throughout his body as he prepared to continue the fight. He didn’t want to implicate Leng Yueyan. His pride didn’t allow him to hide behind a woman, no matter how strong that woman was.

Leng Yueyan slowly looked back at him. Her flawless face actually smiled. “You’re very stubborn. I like it very much. However, I never change what I say. You showed mercy against me twice, so I will repay you twice. Whether or not you want to accept my payback, you’ll still have to accept it.”

When Leng Yueyan said this, everyone in the neutral camp was stunned.

“The Devil Empress famed for her cold and merciless nature, someone who has slaughtered everyone who expressed the slightest romantic interest in her, actually said that she likes Long Chen?!”

“Heaven-defying, absolutely heaven-defying. I’ve long since heard that Long Chen’s charisma is unmatched and is irresistible to both men and women. Not only does he have countless life and death brothers following him, but he is also accompanied by several peerlessly beautiful women. However, I never expected the Devil Empress to have also fallen into his hands. Long Chen is like a god.”

Amongst the Martial Heaven Alliance’s junior generation, there was a saying that there were three kinds of people in this world. Men, women, and Leng Yueyan. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Leng Yueyan was her own category. She was a killer, and anyone who had dared to provoke her had been killed by her.

The Corrupt path’s Three Kings were said to be the top geniuses of the Corrupt path, but even they didn’t dare to provoke Leng Yueyan because she was too dangerous.

Hearing the words that she was saying to Long Chen, people found it inconceivable. Long Chen was truly powerful. He was a real man. Even such a monstrous woman had been captured by him.

“Are you betraying the Corrupt path?!” demanded Xie Luo.

“I already said that I’m returning a debt. I don’t like repeating myself, so decide for yourself whether you want to live or die.” Leng Yueyan turned back to Xie Luo, her smile vanishing.

Xie Luo was enraged. Leng Yueyan was treating him indifferently, despite him being the Corrupt path’s top genius and the descendant of Xie Wentian, thus making him the future leader of the Corrupt path. With a roar, he slashed his crescent moon blade at Leng Yueyan once more.

This time, wails came from within Xie Luo’s manifestation. It was unknown what secret art he was using, but black runes covered his body.

Even his fellow Corrupt Kings, Ming Jie and Gui Yan, were not figures that he cared about. They were unable to shake his position. However, Leng Yueyan could. He had always viewed Leng Yueyan as a threat, but due to certain misgivings, he had never attacked her.

Now, he finally had an excuse to kill her. As long as she died, no one would be able to fight him for the top spot of the Corrupt path.

“Heavenly Evil World Shaking Slash!”

Xie Luo’s attack was something that caused even Long Chen’s expression to change. It was even stronger than his previous attack. Clearly, Xie Luo was going all-out to kill Leng Yueyan.

Just as Long Chen was taking a deep breath and preparing himself to risk his meridians to block this attack, a figure appeared behind Leng Yueyan.

That figure was very indistinct, but it was identical to her true body. However, this figure was a giant whose body pierced the clouds.

A sacred and divine aura spread and shook the souls of everyone present. They couldn’t help feeling an urge to prostrate themselves.

That figure behind Leng Yueyan was like a god. Everyone could only lay down before its feet.

People were shocked as they had never seen such a manifestation. The most terrifying thing was the divine might coming from that figure. It made them feel like they couldn’t resist.

When that figure appeared, the barrier separated the Yin world and the Yang world in the Yin Yang valley suddenly exploded. The Yin world’s death energy suddenly surged toward Leng Yueyan, seeming to prostrate itself before her.

Leng Yueyan’s bone sword swung through the air.

BOOM!

Half a blood blade flew into the sky and vanished, while Xie Luo coughed up blood, flying back. His manifestation dissipated.

Startled cries rang out. That terrifying blade in Xie Luo’s hand had actually been severed. That peerless divine item had been destroyed by Leng Yueyan’s bone sword.

Leng Yueyan unleashed another slash of her sword. When her slash started, she was still in her original location, but when her sword fell, she strangely appeared right in front of Xie Luo.

Xie Luo’s expression changed. He hastily raised his severed blood blade to block.

As a result, it was cut through as easily as tofu. Not only that, but half of Xie Luo’s body was severed. Blood spurted.

Xie Luo let out a cry as he flew back. Fortunately, he had instinctively moved his head at the last moment, or Leng Yueyan’s attack would have taken his life.

He had just moved when Leng Yueyan’s next attack came slashing toward him. However, a giant skeleton suddenly appeared in front of Xie Luo.

The Blue Eye Peacock was blown to bits by a single strike of Leng Yueyan’s bone sword. However, it had managed to block her. Xie Luo managed to escape.

With Xie Luo fleeing, Leng Yueyan suddenly turned her bone sword toward True Immortal Jiaoqi.

True Immortal Jiaoqi blocked her with the qilin halberd, and as a result, it was also severed by her bone sword. That qilin halberd actually let out a mournful cry.

“How is that possible?!”

Leng Yueyan’s bone sword had severed Xie Luo’s crescent moon blood blade and True Immortal Jiaoqi’s qilin halberd. Those two divine items were terrifying half-step divine items and top tier amongst the half-step divine item classification. Their inheritance stretched back countless years, and they had been nourished by many generations of experts. They had given birth to spirits and had immense power. Yet, they were broken by Leng Yueyan’s seemingly unremarkable bone sword.

Even Long Chen was dumbfounded. Just when had Leng Yueyan become so terrifying? Why was it that every time he saw her again, her power became even more monstrous? She practically wasn’t human.

With his qilin halberd severed, True Immortal Jiaoqi was struck in the shoulder. One of True Immortal Jiaoqi’s giant arms left his body.

Although True Immortal Jiaoqi was very powerful, his head was clearly lacking some brains. In his fury, he used his other hand to smash the half qilin halberd at Leng Yueyan’s face.

Leng Yueyan smiled coldly. Her bone sword, slicing toward True Immortal Jiaoqi’s head. She was quick as lightning, completely ignoring his halberd.

Suddenly, True Immortal Jiaoqi was knocked back by a flame hammer, allowing him to escape Leng Yueyan’s killer sword. Instead, her sword cut across his chest, leaving a line of blood.

When that cut appeared, his expression changed. His chest began to turn black at a frightening rate. Terrifying death energy was invading his body.

“Be careful, she can control the Yin Yang World’s death energy!” It was Huo Lieyun who had saved True Immortal Jiaoqi. He turned the Brahma Divine Diagram at Leng Yueyan.

BOOM!

Leng Yueyan’s sword struck the divine diagram. It was sent flying, but it wasn’t damaged. Clearly, it was so terrifying that even Leng Yueyan’s bone sword couldn’t damage it.

The Brahma Divine Diagram was one of Pill Valley’s most precious treasures. It was on the same level as the Daynight Furnace. Legend had it that they had been refined by gods. Now the difference was clear.

Although only a Netherpassage expert could unleash the true power of a divine item, powerful Empyreans were still able to unleash a bit of their power.

Many divine items were destroyed because their masters’ cultivation bases limited them, making them unable to unleash their full power. They felt very irritated as they were destroyed by other divine items. However, now the quality of the divine items was shown. The Brahma Divine Diagram was on a level that not even the qilin halberd or the crescent moon blood blade could compare to.

“Let’s go!”

Huo Lieyun waved his hand, and the Brahma Divine Diagram folded up. He pulled True Immortal Jiaoqi back, chasing after the fleeing Xie Luo.
