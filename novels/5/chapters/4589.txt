Chapter 4578 Ancestral Scale Resonance

“Brother, are you alright?”

It was Long Chen who had stepped forward and caught that person—an imposing member of the dragon race. Despite his muscular build, his face was now pallid with rage, and a hint of bitterness was evident in his eyes.

“Why?! Why?! I am my race’s most outstanding genius! Why can I not form a resonance with the ancestral scale?! If I can’t even do that, how can I subdue it?!” roared that person. It seemed that he had entered a berserk state.

At this moment, other members of his race rushed over, but the muscular dragon expert roared and unleashed a mighty punch, sending astral winds raging and blowing away his kin.

All of a sudden, a slender finger tapped his forehead, causing him to tremble as his fury dissipated. He stared in shock at Bai Yingxue, who stood before him. Quickly, he bowed in deference.

“Greetings, respected white dragon princess.”

“Obtaining the approval of the ancestral scale isn’t an easy feat. Anger solves nothing and only complicates matters. To resonate with the ancestral scale, you must first understand how to establish a connection with it. Only then will you discern your shortcomings. If you know how to get the ancestral scale’s approval, even if you fail to subdue it now, your efforts will still benefit your race. An inheritance always has an heir, and every person has their own destiny. When the main character isn’t you, you must consider your role and actions instead of giving in to anger,” reminded Bai Yingxue.

In an instant, that dragon expert looked ashamed and respectfully said, “Many thanks for your reminder, princess. I understand.”

Bai Yingxue nodded and continued onward, while Long Chen examined this hall curiously. As expected, there was a ten-foot-tall scale floating in the air.

There were runes floating around it, and it contained a terrifying dragon might. This scale’s aura was identical to that of this dragon expert.

As this was Long Chen’s first time seeing a true ancestral scale in the dragon cemetery, he couldn’t help but feel a bit shocked. The dragon might emanating from this ancestral scale was absolutely terrifying, even instilling a sense of fear in him.

Based on his estimation, if he were to try and subdue this dragon scale, his odds of success would be extremely slim, and forcing it would put his life in danger.

The dragon expert from before was far weaker than Long Chen. Hence, it was a heaven-defying task for him to subdue the dragon scale, and he could easily lose his life in the process. It was no wonder he was so angry and resentful. That kind of powerless feeling was something that outsiders couldn’t fully comprehend.

Seeing Long Chen lost in thought, Bai Yingxue asked, “Brother Long, what are you thinking?”

“I’m thinking that it’s almost impossible for that person to subdue this dragon scale. I don’t understand... Why did the ancestral dragon leave behind a reverse scale as an inheritance but make it so difficult to gain? Isn’t that just making it hard on its descendants?” said Long Chen.

Hearing his question, Bai Yingxue nodded. “Right, as someone not from the dragon race, you may not be familiar with it. Every dragon expert is a prideful existence, and an ancestral dragon, as a pioneer, holds even greater pride. We can’t compare to them. An ancestral dragon’s inheritance is split in two. One portion is their bloodline inheritance which is shared freely among all their descendants, and another portion is sealed in their reverse scale, serving to safeguard the bloodline from extinction. When a branch begins striving to awaken its ancestral scale, it signifies a perilous state for the race. The majority of their divine abilities can no longer be awakened, so they have no choice but to rely on the ancestral scale to revive the branch’s bloodline.

“According to our customs, only a genius whose talent, aptitude, willpower, comprehension, and other attributes align perfectly with the ancestral dragon can inherit its reverse scale. Only such a genius can earn the ancestral dragon’s favor, becoming the beacon of hope for the branch’s revival. Thus, wanting to obtain an ancestral dragon’s approval is as difficult as ascending the heavens. I could give him some comforting words, but in truth, I don’t know how I’m supposed to comfort myself,” Bai Yingxue concluded with a bitter smile.

In the end, she gave him some advice, but what advice was she supposed to give herself? Like that expert, she bore her own mission. They all hoped to obtain the recognition of their ancestral scale and bring it back to their race, allowing their race to rise to their former glory.

The bigger the goal, the bigger the pressure. As they approached the core of the dragon cemetery, drawing nearer to the white dragon race’s Ten Thousand Dragon Nest, Bai Yingxue found herself unable to share in the excitement. Instead, a mounting tension gripped her, almost suffocating her. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

However, she could only tell this to Long Chen, not the rest of her people. Looking at their excited gazes, she only got more nervous. She almost wished that they would never arrive. Then she wouldn’t have to face such powerless despair.

“Don’t worry. I’ll comfort you.” Long Chen smiled and patted Bai Yingxue’s shoulder.

This was one of his habitual actions. However, after patting her shoulder, he realized that this act was a bit too intimate considering that they didn’t know each other that well. Looking at the shocked expressions of the other white dragon race’s experts, he instantly felt embarrassed.

Bai Yingxue also felt strange because no one had ever acted so intimately with her. However, for some reason, she felt even closer to Long Chen after it. Infected by his fearless optimism, she felt the weight of her burden lightening.

Bai Yingxue remained silent and just smiled slightly. Such a warm smile instantly made Long Chen feel better.

After entering another Ten Thousand Dragon Nest, Long Chen and the others saw hundreds of thousands of dragon experts sitting within its core hall with a black-robed woman in the center. They were watching the surroundings vigilantly.

Seated beneath an immense scale, the black-robed woman basked in the cascading divine light, which enveloped her in its ethereal glow

Witnessing this, Bai Yingxue couldn’t contain her astonishment. “She’s formed a resonance with her ancestral scale? That’s amazing!”

Bai Yingxue was full of envy. Just now, they had passed through several Ten Thousand Dragon Nests with ancestral scales, and so many geniuses were in a mess, not even qualified to get close to the ancestral scale.

However, the fact that someone had managed to form a resonance with their ancestral scale here couldn’t be attributed solely to luck; it was a clear indication of the individual’s genuine power.

Aside from members of the white dragon race, numerous other dragon experts surrounded the area. Some gazed on with envy, others with jealousy, and a few even displayed a hard light in their eyes.

The dragon experts of this Ten Thousand Dragon Nest were clearly uneasy, watching the surroundings vigilantly. After all, they didn’t want anyone to disturb their top expert.

Luckily, all the people around were just passing by. After staring for a bit, they left, including the white dragon race.

Perhaps seeing that black-robed woman ignited a newfound sense of hope in Bai Yingxue, as her footsteps quickened with determination.

They passed through hundreds of Ten Thousand Dragon Nests, each occupied by their own race. Other than the black-robed woman, only one person had managed to form a resonance with their ancestral scale, which showed just how difficult it was to form a resonance with an ancestral scale.

The further they went, the stronger the auras of the Ten Thousand Dragon Nests. Some of the ancestral scales in this region were so powerful that an outsider would feel a stinging pain in their soul just from passing by.

Suddenly, white light appeared ahead of them, suffusing the air with a holy aura that felt akin to sunlight on their bodies. Immediately, the experts of the white dragon race erupted into cheers.

They had finally arrived at the white dragon race’s Ten Thousand Dragon Nest.
