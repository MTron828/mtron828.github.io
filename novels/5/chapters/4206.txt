Chapter 4195 Limit

“Time, space, haha! So the space is wrong! This is the world of the immortal characters, not a true world. Unleashing the sixth volume of the Nirvana Scripture here requires expanding this immortal character world. With my current power, expanding it is really difficult.” Long Chen laughed. He figured it out as soon as he looked at it from a different angle.

The next moment, flames once more rose. However, Long Chen wasn’t chanting this time. He was only forming hand seals and chanting the scripture in his heart.

With this, Long Chen was deducing the scripture, not unleashing it. As long as he wasn’t forced to expand this space, Long Chen wouldn’t use up so much Spiritual Strength.

After a while, he finished deducing the sixth volume and moved on to the seventh volume.

However, when he got to the seventh volume, he encountered a problem. The seventh volume actually required some syllables to be said with the mouth.

“It’s no good. I can only go up to here and will have to figure out the rest outside. Fortunately, I’ve fully memorized the Nirvana Scripture. Even without the flames here, I’m confident I can decipher even the ninth volume.”

Long Chen took a deep breath and looked at the flames here emotionally. If it weren’t for their help, Long Chen wouldn’t have been able to understand the true meaning of the Nirvana Scripture.

The High Firmament Academy’s Nirvana Scripture had tens of thousands of characters. But all those characters couldn’t express as much as these two original Jiuli immortal characters. They were unable to express the same realm.

But then again, when it came to original Jiuli immortal characters, you either understood them, or you didn’t. If you couldn’t understand, it would be like reading a magic book. Most importantly, Long Chen would have no way of explaining it to others.

The current era’s characters were invented so people could express thoughts more accurately, allowing for inheritances to be passed down more easily. But while that appeared to be harmless, in truth, the true meaning of the original characters had been lost.

After all, these two original Jiuli immortal characters had the power to convey the pinnacle technique of the Flame Dao. With just these two characters, a supreme divine ability could be transmitted, a feat only the original Jiuli immortal characters could achieve.

“Original Jiuli immortal characters contain things that I cannot imagine. The reason why Lord Brahma named himself like that must be connected to the Nirvana Scripture. He only changed his name to Lord Brahma after learning the Nirvana Scripture. Could it be that the name of Brahma is lucky?” wondered Long Chen.

In the end, with a final look at the three empty thrones, Long Chen retreated from this space. When his soul returned to his body, he instantly felt a burst of weariness. He immediately cursed in his heart.

BOOM!

As expected, before he even had time to defend, he was sent flying by a terrifying force, tumbling all the way down the staircase.

While in meditation, he was protected by the Jiuli immortal characters, so the palace master’s pressure didn’t affect him.

However, the moment his soul returned to his body, the protection of the Jiuli immortal characters vanished. Since Long Chen’s Spiritual Strength was too weak to instantly summon the Dragon King Battle Armor in that state, he was forced out by the palace master’s might.

When Long Chen tumbled down to the second floor, he saw that two more young disciples had managed to reach this level. From their robes, they came from the Battle God Palace.

Fortunately, they were all in meditative states and didn’t see Long Chen’s wretched state.

At this moment, Bai Shishi was surrounded by golden divine radiance, like a golden goddess sitting there, appearing incredibly noble and holy.

Looking at her beautiful smile, Long Chen smiled at himself mockingly. Just what kind of luck did he have to obtain the favor of such a fairy?

Long Chen often felt like he had too many beauties by his side, and every single one of them deeply loved him. Such affection was challenging to reciprocate, even if he were to toil until his very bones crumbled to dust. Thus, he often felt ashamed of himself due to this.

He had also been young and frivolous, thinking of having many wives and concubines. But now he knew that a man could only carry so much on his shoulders.

When he was young, his father had once given him a wooden sword. As he held that wooden sword, he felt like he was completely unrivaled, as if the world was within his grasp.

Yet now, despite all the power he had attained, his anxiety only deepened. He harbored a growing fear that one day, he might prove unable to protect those he loved.

Long Chen was suddenly drawn out of his thoughts. He didn’t see Huo Linger and Lei Linger anywhere.

However, he could sense their auras, and he quickly became speechless. The two of them had actually transformed until they were the size of worms and stuck themselves to the runes on the bone steles.

Most likely, the two of them had found a method more suited to them. Perhaps sticking their bodies to these characters might assist them in understanding their meaning. After all, the two were spiritual entities, and the human race’s methods might not be the best ones for them.

Long Chen rested for a while and consumed a pill to restore Spiritual Strength. Afterward, he didn’t head back to the third floor. Instead, he went down to the first.

On the first floor, he saw that more people had arrived, and on the way down, he saw several people striving to climb up.

On the first floor, he spotted Zhong Ling and Zhong Xiu. They had actually reached this place and were gaining comprehension from one of the bone steles.

Long Chen’s gaze swept over the crowd and he spotted Luo Bing, Luo Ning, Mu Qingyun, Xia Chen, Qin Feng, Qi Yu, and the others gaining comprehension of the bone steles. However, what was rare was that Guo Ran was also in front of one of the bone steles, his eyes closed. It didn’t seem like he was faking it. He really was earnestly comprehending its secrets.

When Long Chen climbed down, quite a few disciples greeted him reverently. In the High Firmament Academy, even the hidden heavenly geniuses felt immense reverence for Long Chen.

Long Chen greeted them in return. Then, he headed back up to the second floor. However, he was disappointed to find that there were no illusions this time.

He had been hoping to see if he could determine the identity of those who had betrayed the human race and stabbed them in the back.

However, since that image didn’t appear again, he could only accept it. After adjusting his condition on the second floor, he headed for the third floor once more.

The palace master’s pressure struck him again, but this time, he was prepared and had summoned the Dragon King Battle Armor. He easily entered the third floor.

Long Chen sat himself down in front of the bone stele again, wanting to see if he could gain anything from other Jiuli immortal characters that were on the bone stele.

“This is the Sword character.”

When Long Chen looked at one of the characters, his back instantly turned cold. It was as if a dagger had been thrust into his very soul, carrying with it a piercing sword intent that seemed to penetrate him deeply.

Long Chen had barely looked at it and he was almost injured. This character was too domineering and contained countless things.

“Truly domineering. It won’t even give me a chance to comprehend it. Most likely, it’s simply on too high of a level. You would need to take it step by step,” sighed Long Chen.nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

Mu Qingyun’s Sword Dao foundation was quite solid, but she still was stuck on the first floor. As for this character, it was on the third floor. Most likely, you would only be qualified to comprehend it after comprehending the Sword Dao on the previous two floors.

Long Chen wasn’t a sword cultivator, so he chose to give up on it. Just as Long Chen was planning on looking at the other immortal characters, the palace master’s voice suddenly rang out.

“Help me out.”
