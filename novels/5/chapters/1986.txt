“Evilmoon, was that you?” asked Long Chen.

“Was what me?” Evilmoon was startled by this sudden question.

Long Chen’s heart pounded. If it wasn’t Evilmoon who had just spoken, then who was it?

Just as he was distracted, a lightning sword pierced through his shoulder, causing a spurt of blood.

Long Chen immediately stopped thinking about that voice. He had to focus on killing the lightning beasts.

There was a giant lightning gate up in the sky, but there was also a lightning channel behind Long Chen connected to the lightning field. On the other side of the channel, there were countless lightning drakes crazily devouring the lightning runes that came through. These lightning drakes were smaller, and sometimes they would simply explode after eating a mouthful of the runes. They weren’t strong enough to absorb such powerful thunderforce.

However, the stronger ones were devouring them and roaring with excitement. This was the greatest blessing of their lives.

Up in the sky, the silver drake king was glaring at the channel, wondering if Long Chen was conning him. Why was it that even at such a time, he hadn’t called out to it?

Last time, it had been rather embarrassing during the Dragonblood Legion’s tribulation as it had come out ahead of time. Hence, it was waiting for Long Chen to call it this time. That would make it appear more kingly.

However, even now, Long Chen wasn’t calling it. The divine lightning runes coming out of the channel were extremely attractive to it, but now it felt it would be embarrassing to fight over those scraps.

Even though Long Chen was killing the lightning beasts quickly, more and more of them came from the sky. Furthermore, they were getting progressively stronger.

All of Heavenly Fate Island was shaking, and it wasn’t long before the Heavenly Fate Platform shattered. But that wasn’t all. The ground was continuously sinking. Some of the metal lightning energy attacks were so powerful that they pierced giant holes into the island.

If this continued, it really wouldn’t be long before Heavenly Fate Island was destroyed. That made them think of what Long Chen had said.

Long Chen had said that the Martial Heaven Continent would no longer have a Heavenly Fate Island.

“We can’t let Long Chen finish his tribulation. We have to think of some way to disturb him!” said the Unfettered Allseer.

“If you want to disturb him, it’s simple. Let me.” A sinister True Immortal Jiaoqi suddenly thought of something. “Long Chen, take a look at this!”

An elder appeared in True Immortal Jiaoqi’s hand. He was half-unconscious and was being held by the throat. He was motionless, but there was a rainbow-colored mark on his forehead, with an aura showing that he was a powerful Netherpassage expert.

“This is... the aura of the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow race!” Startled cries rang out. Just what was he doing?

“I’d advise you not to do anything stupid.” Long Chen turned to look at True Immortal Jiaoqi, icy killing intent in his eyes. He knew what True Immortal Jiaoqi was about to do.

Blood splattered as the elder’s body fell to the ground without his head. His head was in True Immortal Jiaoqi’s hand. As for the body that fell, it transformed into the true form of the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow.

“What did you say? I didn’t hear it clearly. Something about doing something stupid?” mocked True Immortal Jiaoqi.

True Immortal Jiaoqi waved his hand, and dozens of people from the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow race appeared. With a swing of his halberd, blood mist filled the air.

In truth, those people were just corpses. Their souls had already been extracted to learn their secrets. However, their corpses had still possessed the slightest bit of life. As True Immortal Jiaoqi hadn’t had time to handle these corpses yet, he now took them out in front of Long Chen.

“Haha, aren’t you very arrogant? Then come at me! I only hunted down the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow race’s people because of you, so come at me! I have the Qilin War Chariot, and you can’t catch me. You’ll only be able to watch as I kill them! You are trash, hahaha!” True Immortal Jiaoqi suddenly took out a young woman. She was also from the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow race, but she had a terrified expression. “I was planning on raising this woman to have my children to see if I could give rise to an even stronger generation, but now I’ve changed ideas. I think I’ll kill her and skin her slowly.”

“You win.” Long Chen took a deep breath.

“Haha, winning just like this? No, no. The good show is still coming. Don’t be in a rush, I-”

Twang.

True Immortal Jiaoqi’s body shook. His vision flashed, and the woman in his hand vanished.

That woman reappeared by Zi Yan’s side. Holding the Seven String Sea Suppressing Zither, Zi Yan coldly stared at True Immortal Jiaoqi. “I, Zi Yan, rarely curse people, but at this time I have no choice but to say that you are complete trash.”

Ye Zhiqiu slowly released her sword, Mo Nian put away his bow, and Hu Feng’s die once more began slowly spinning. Each one of them had killing intent in their eyes.

Qu Jianying had a disdainful expression. The Xuan Beasts had been raised into even bigger idiots by Pill Valley. Even the neutral camp’s experts couldn’t maintain their neutrality.

“You...” True Immortal Jiaoqi was startled and enraged. He pointed his halberd at Zi Yan. But before he could say anything, Long Chen’s voice rang out from within the lightning.

“True Immortal Jiaoqi, you win. I have no choice but to change my plans because of your foolishness.”

Long Chen suddenly flew toward the other side of Heavenly Fate Island.

“Not good!” The Unfettered Allseer’s expression changed. He already knew what Long Chen was planning.

As he moved, the tribulation followed him. The untouched parts of Heavenly Fate Island were torn asunder. Countless buildings lit up and attacked Long Chen, but regretfully, Heavenly Fate Island had always been a mysterious existence that no one had dared to provoke, so its defenses weren’t very strong.

Long Chen easily avoided those attacks and went straight for the main palace. The disciples within fled for their lives.

There were over ten Netherpassage experts who bravely charged into the lightning tribulation to kill him, but as soon as they entered his tribulation, swords of divine lightning condensed, with even greater power, turning those Netherpassage experts into nothing more than dust.

Long Chen charged into the palace. The lightning beasts tried to follow him, but the palace was too big. Thus, they began to crazily attack the palace.

All the buildings in the surroundings were blown apart. The disciples that didn’t have time to flee yet were killed.

They hadn’t expected Long Chen to be able to drag the tribulation over. It had to be known that other people were locked down within a certain region when they underwent tribulation. Long Chen’s actions once more toppled their understanding of heavenly tribulation.

In just a few seconds, the palace was destroyed. The lightning beasts continued chasing Long Chen, and anything in their way was blown apart.

He led this army of lightning beasts throughout Heavenly Fate Island. As a result, the disciples cried for their fathers and mothers as they ran.

“Long Chen, you bastard, hurry and stop!” roared the Unfettered Allseer. But Long Chen ignored him.

Very quickly, all of Heavenly Fate Island turned into ruins.

“I actually didn’t find it?” Long Chen was surprised. After going throughout the island, he hadn’t found what he was looking for. He started another loop.

The thunderforce in the air was growing stronger and stronger. The lightning beasts had also grown mightier, and Heavenly Fate Island was now filled with holes.

“I understand. This fellow, he really is ruthless!” Mo Nian suddenly understood. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

“What is he doing?” asked Ye Lingshan.

“Guess.”

Suddenly, the ground exploded. A giant underground altar appeared beneath one of the palaces. That altar had a giant cut appear in it from one of the lightning beasts’ attacks, and as a result, brilliant divine light shone from the opening.

Seeing that divine light, everyone let out startled cries. They realized what Long Chen was planning.

“Long Chen, you dare?!” The Unfettered Allseer was finally afraid. That was the heaven and earth divine pool of Heavenly Fate Island. It was their divine spring, a place where all their karmic luck was condensed. If it was destroyed, Heavenly Fate Island would slowly fade away until it was no more. Not even a god would be able to save them.

Years ago, back when the Heaven Suppressing Magic Sect had been one of the three great heavenly sects along with the Xuantian Dao Sect and the Heaven Splitting Battle Sect, Long Chen had destroyed their divine pool, resulting in them silently vanishing from this world.

That was one of the laws of the Heavenly Daos, an irresistible power. Once their divine pool was destroyed, it represented that this sect’s destiny had run out. The world would no longer accept their existence.

Long Chen flew over, but he had just approached it when a ray of Sword Qi slashed toward Long Chen. That terrifying Sword Qi annihilated any lightning beasts in its way.

Long Chen immediately had a bad feeling. His lightning wings flapped, and he hastily retreated. That Sword Qi just barely missed him. He narrowly avoided being cut in two.
