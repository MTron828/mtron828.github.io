Chapter 2336 The Hand Behind the Scenes

Translator: BornToBe

“Long Chen, you…! We are sincerely pledging loyalty to the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow race! We fully support them as emperors of the Xuan Beasts. How does that become a trap in your eyes?!” shouted one of the Xuan Beasts furiously.

“Long Chen, what intentions are you harboring?!”

“This is clearly a matter for the Xuan Beasts alone. As a human, you don’t understand our feelings.” The Xuan Beasts continued to talk angrily for a while.

“Shut up.” Long Chen suddenly shouted, cutting them all off. The icy killing intent made them shut their mouths. “If I wanted to kill you, is there anyone within this palace capable of blocking one of my attacks? You want to act tough in front of me? If you want to die so badly, hurry up and come.”

His gaze swept through them icily, with no one daring to meet it. He was someone who had even killed Kun Pengzi. None of these Xuan Beasts could fight against him.

Long Chen sneered, “Your little thoughts can be concealed from others, but do you think you can trick me? Do you think everyone is as childish as you? I almost can’t be bothered to ask whether it was the idea of the divine families or Pill Valley.”

When he said this, he noted quite a few people’s expressions changed. Clearly, he had guessed right.

Que Yuzhu also sensed it due to her experience from leading the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow race through years of bitterness. As for the Elders, they also found something odd and began to listen carefully.

“The Xuan Beasts have no leader now and are like a plate of sand. When the invaders strike, you will definitely take enormous losses. Who knows how many races will be wiped out entirely? I don’t believe that you wouldn’t go begging for aid from the divine families, as well as Pill Valley and your other so-called allies. However, you didn’t get any help, so you threw away all your dignity and ran over here for the protection of the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow race. I also refuse to believe that no one helped you come to that conclusion. You must have weighed the pros and cons of this before jointly deciding to come here.”

Long Chen’s gaze swept across them. “Now that the dark era is imminent and your greatest support, the Kunpeng race, is gone, the Xuan Beasts no longer have their old glory. Now, all you can do is hope to ally with the human race’s experts just like you did back in those years. However, when the human race declined, your treatment of them made such a thing impossible. The human race no longer cares for you. So you’ve run over to the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow race, by calling it the glorified action of consecrating them as emperors, when in reality you just want a powerful backer to protect you. Putting it even more frankly, the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow race will be your shield, the boat you sit in to pass through the upcoming dark era.”

“What nonsense! We-!”

Long Chen slapped that Xuan Beast who stood against him. That was a third step Netherpassage expert, but he had no ability to resist in front of Long Chen.

The Xuan Beast slammed into a stone pillar, shaking the palace. He coughed up a mouthful of blood. After that, Long Chen grabbed his neck and raised him until his feet no longer touched the ground. With a thought, he could kill him.

“Long Chen, what are you doing? You’re going to use martial power to suppress people now? Are you planning on killing all of us? No one is allowed to go against you, is that it? You’re going to claim the entire Martial Heaven Continent as your own-”

Another Xuan Beast started going off, and Long Chen simply flicked a finger, sending a lightning arrow that exploded his head.

“You’re intentionally trying to confuse right and wrong. I’m not so bored as to waste time with you. If you want to die, then keep opening your mouths.” Long Chen’s expression was dark. Quite a few of these people were set up to oppose him, irritating him. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

In an instant, no one else in the palace dared to open their mouths because they found that Long Chen was truly angry. If they continued antagonizing him, that would be too stupid.

Seeing no one else speak, Long Chen turned back to the expert whose throat he was holding. “Tell me, who prompted you to come here?”

After saying that, Long Chen added, “Don’t try to lie in front of me. Even the divine families’ Heavenly Dragon Legion was slaughtered by me, so don’t think that I won’t dare to kill you. I’ve completely locked onto your spiritual fluctuations. If you lie, it will only mean that you’ve grown tired of living.”

The expert in his hand was pale with terror. Despite his fury, he turned cowardly in front of Long Chen’s cold gaze. “It was the Elder of the divine families who gave us the idea.”

“What?” The Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow race’s Elders were stunned, especially those that had been in agreement with this plan.

“The Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow race’s people treat each other sincerely, but that doesn’t mean that others will treat you with that sincerity. Senior, you should not let your temper control you.” Long Chen looked at the Elder that had almost been expelled by Que Yuzhu.

Long Chen was expressionless. It seemed he had known that this would be the result from the start. He continued asking, “Was it Ye Yaochen?”

“No, it was another Elder.” The expert seemed to have admitted his defeat and obediently answered.

Long Chen nodded, too lazy to even ask who that Elder was. Clearly, Ye Yaochen had grown a head and wasn’t going to be caught so easily. He had sent someone to do his dirty work. Long Chen ordered, “Tell us the details.”

The expert told them about how the Xuan Beasts were terrified of the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow race after they had wiped out the Kunpeng race and the other strongest pillars of the Xuan Beasts.

After all, during the time that the Kunpeng race had led them, they had listened to their orders and hunted down the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow race.

After tens of thousands of years, every powerful race had killed some members of the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow race. They were all afraid that they would turn on them now.

Under that pressure and fear, they had cast their lot to the divine families, only for them to say that they had no time to handle them due to the destruction of the Sovereign seals. In fact, they had been so impatient that the representative they had spoken to had told them to screw off.

Having lost the Kunpeng race, the Xuan Beasts were no longer viewed as important by the divine families.

Helplessly, they had run over to Pill Valley. After all, they had been allies. Unfortunately, those former allies didn’t give them any help. Yu Xiaoyun refused to even see them.

As for the Corrupt path and the ancient family alliance, they viewed them like the plague, afraid of associating with them for fear that Long Chen would come.

Tian Xiezi had yet to reappear after having his leg cut off by Long Chen. He had not come out of the Corrupt God Cemetery.

As for Di Feng, after fleeing, it was said that he hadn’t dared to return to the headquarters of the ancient family alliance. He was still in the wind.

Long Chen didn’t seem to have any intention of searching for him, but who knew if this was the calm before the storm?

After all, Long Chen never acted according to conventional means. If he was secretly waiting, then revealing himself would practically be giving Long Chen an excuse to kill him.

The current Long Chen wasn’t an existence that the divine families could control. Antagonizing him at this time was very unwise.

Long Chen was like a ferocious beast quietly lying beside them. Once he found a chance, he would devour them.

Even the Kunpeng race had been wiped out in the end. So all the various powers were afraid of the current Long Chen. No one wanted to be the one to offend him and end up being targeted.

The Corrupt path and Pill Valley could be said to be undying mortal enemies with Long Chen, and theoretically, they should be supporting the Xuan Beasts against Long Chen at this time. After all, the enemy of my enemy is my friend.

However, they didn’t dare to. The attitude of the divine families was not favorable to them. Ye Yaochen wanted Long Chen dead, but Elder Long was protecting him.

It was due to this incomprehensible state that the Xuan Beasts were left with nowhere else to go. The divine families didn’t care about them, and others didn’t want to associate with them due to fear.

Just as the Xuan Beasts were looking for any kind of support and not receiving any, a mysterious Elder of the divine families pointed them to a smart path.

That Elder had said to rely on the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow race, saying that they were a race of the Xuan Beasts and couldn’t possibly work together with the human race for too long. They would eventually split with Long Chen.

By throwing themselves to the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow, their experts would definitely stand at the very front when the dark era’s battle started. That would give them a greater chance of survival.

That Elder had even subtly indicated that a few people should try to incite disharmony between Long Chen and the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow race to antagonize him.

Once he grew angry, then with his pride, he would no longer bother with the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow race. He would gradually distance himself from them, and then the Xuan Beasts would be united again.

Furthermore, as a former ally of the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow race, once they were united, Long Chen wouldn’t touch them.

“Bastards. I’ll kill you all.” The Elder of the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow coughed up a mouthful of blood. That was from rage. With a furious roar, he pounced on those Xuan Beasts.
