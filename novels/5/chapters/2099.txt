Chapter 2089 Kun Pengzi

Beitang Rushuang was actually standing by Long Chen’s side. As long as Long Chen left, she would leave as well.

Nangong Zuiyue was also with Beitang Rushuang, expressing her attitude without saying anything. That made everyone’s expressions change.

If two of the four everlasting families left, then this gathering of past and present heroes hosted by the Dongfang family would become a joke. Adding on the Martial Heaven Continent’s number one alliance leaving, what would even be the point of holding this gathering?

“If this gathering doesn’t have Long Chen, then it really is meaningless. I can only leave. Sorry for not living up to your standards, brother Dongfang.” Amongst the crowd, Hu Feng cupped his fists toward Dongfang Yuyang apologetically.

“It seems that I came at a bad time. As soon as I get here, I have to leave.” Zi Yan sighed, looking at Long Chen. Although she didn’t know what was going on here, her meaning was also clear.

People were shocked. Since when did Long Chen possess such influence?

Even Long Chen was shocked. The only reason he had left was for his own sake. He knew that he couldn’t stay because Zhao Wuji would say even more baiting words. He wouldn’t be able to sit there and be insulted like that. That was directly against the Nine Star Hegemon Body Art’s will.

He hadn’t expected Nangong Zuiyue and Beitang Rushuang, two supreme geniuses who represented two supreme powers, would also stand beside him. There were only two possibilities: either the two of them were also outraged for him, or the four everlasting families were not actually as united as he had thought.

Perhaps they also had some kind of mission in coming here, but whatever their reasons, he was grateful that they were standing beside him.

For Nangong Zuiyue and Beitang Rushuang to stand beside him was shocking, but understandable to him. However, when Zi Yan also spoke up, he found it incomprehensible.

Looking at Zi Yan, Long Chen felt that there was something different about her, but as for what that was, he couldn’t say for sure.

“Everyone here is a supreme genius. There’s no need to let something minor harm our friendships. Wouldn’t other cultivators laugh at us if we let that happen? This matter is all my fault,” said Dongfang Yuyang. “I was busy with many things and didn’t take care to make sure that people showed consideration for other people’s taboos. This conflict should have never occurred, and it’s my fault that it did. I hope that everyone can give me a little face and let this matter go. Brother Long, is that acceptable?” said Dongfang Yuyang.

Dongfang Yuyang had already taken a very deferential position. Long Chen’s actions had clearly been in the wrong, but Dongfang Yuyang placed the responsibility on himself. That was already giving more than enough face to Long Chen.

If Long Chen still left, it would be incredibly rude. He had no choice but to say, “Brother Yuyang is a dragon amongst men. I wasn’t trying to force you to do anything. It’s just that some people go too far. I want to leave because I don’t want to bring you more trouble. If certain idiots keep talking the way they have been, I won’t be able to hold myself back. At that time, I would just make things harder on you.”

Long Chen didn’t want to go yet. He wanted to see how much his pill would sell for and to see if he could buy anything good. But Zhao Wuji was too vile. If this place wasn’t the Dongfang family, Long Chen would have long since slaughtered him.

Dongfang Yuyang was practically flawless with how he had handled things, and when it came to Long Chen’s matter, he had clearly been biased toward protecting him. He said, “Don’t worry about this. Starting today, I will be in charge of accompanying everyone. I trust that everyone will give me this face.”

“Alright, if you say something like that, I’d feel bad leaving.” Long Chen walked back.

Zhao Wuji, Shi Lingfeng, and the others’ expressions were a bit unsightly, but if they continued targeting Long Chen, it would be a slap in Dongfang Yuyang’s face, so they only snorted.

This matter was suppressed just like this by Dongfang Yuyang. Beitang Rushuang smiled, knowing that with her and Nangong Zuiyue standing beside Long Chen, Dongfang Yuyang would be forced to concede.

“Thank you,” transmitted Long Chen to Beitang Rushuang and Nangong Zuiyue. He was very grateful for their help.

He also cupped his fists in thanks toward Hu Feng. Hu Feng had also stood by his side, meaning that he viewed Long Chen as a friend.

Hu Feng was the Gambling Heavenly Dao’s heir. He was mysterious and powerful. Even here, he had a powerful position.

Not having to leave made Ye Lingshan sigh with relief. When she had left for this place, Qu Jianying had repeatedly warned her to look after Long Chen and make sure that he didn’t cause any trouble.

However, there was no way for her to look after Long Chen. If they had returned like this, Qu Jianying would give them a blistering lecture.

Rather than forming good relationships with the powerful existences that had appeared, they had instead solidified their enmities. She really didn’t know how she would be able to explain herself if they left like this.

The new auction room was already ready. It went without saying that the Dongfang family’s efficiency was amazing. In the second room, Long Chen still chose to sit at the back.

Ye Lingshan, Ye Zhiqiu, Nangong Zuiyue, and Beitang Rushuang followed him. But what he didn’t expect was for Zi Yan to come as well.

“May I ask if there is a spot for me?” asked Zi Yan.

“Of course. Please, sit.” Long Chen naturally wouldn’t refuse. Zi Yan’s display just now had been an expression of good will. Although he still didn’t know her exact standing point, her action just now was enough.

Zi Yan greeted the others. Her special Dao charm that contained the essence of the Heavenly Daos made even Nangong Zuiyue and Beitang Rushuang view her with respect.

Nangong Zuiyue in particular was getting along with Zi Yan very well. After just a few words, it was like the two of them were close friends.

Zi Yan’s experiences and comprehension resonated with Nangong Zuiyue’s in many areas. The two of them began a long conversation about all things within heaven and earth. After just a few exchanges, they were holding hands, quietly discussing something.

Long Chen held Ye Zhiqiu’s hand while talking to Beitang Rushuang and Ye Lingshan. At the same time, he was paying attention to what was happening at the front of the room.

Suddenly, Zi Yan sent him a spiritual message. “Long Chen, you don’t need to guard against me any longer. I think that we won’t be enemies in the future.”

“Really?” Long Chen was pleasantly surprised.

“Yes. My ancestral master said so herself. The great era’s arrival means that the dark era will quickly follow. Right now, everyone must be united to defend the Martial Heaven Continent. Whether you’re a hero or a devil, as long as you choose the right opponents to face, your name will be immortalized throughout history,” said Zi Yan. It was like a weight had been lifted from her shoulder.

“Are you referring to your fated devil star?” probed Long Chen.

Zi Yan had once told him that he was her life’s fated devil star. Even now, Long Chen didn’t know just which rat bastard had come up with such a pain-in-the-ass nonsense.

In any case, Zi Yan seemed to believe it without question. The two of them were fated to be mortal enemies, and she had constantly wanted to purify him. As for Long Chen, he had been unable to bring himself to kill Zi Yan either, so she had always been a sore point in his heart.

Zi Yan smiled. “The devil is born from the heart. The heart-devil is also a kind of trial. I promised my master I would overcome my heart-devil. I will never... with you... well, in any case, we won’t be enemies in the future.”

Long Chen didn’t notice the pain that appeared deep within her eyes when she said that. In order to no longer be enemies with Long Chen, she had promised the Illusive Music Immortal Palace that she would not have any feelings toward Long Chen. She had even sworn this oath in front of the ancestral master who had presided over successive generations.

Although she would no longer have to be enemies with Long Chen because of her master or her sect’s orders, when it came to her relationship with him, it could no longer progress a single step forward.

“As long as we’re not enemies, it’s good. To tell the truth, it was really hard on me every time you appeared to block my path.” Long Chen smiled. As he was looking into the crowd, he was only happy, not seeing Zi Yan’s sadness.

“Brother Peng, haha, you’ve finally arrived.” Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

Just at this moment, Dongfang Yuyang, who had been personally greeting everyone coming in, stood and welcomed someone.

When that person appeared, all the experts in the room focused on him. They knew who he was.

“Kun Pengzi. He’s actually also awakened,” said Beitang Rushuang.

“Who is Kun Pengzi?” asked Long Chen.

“Could it be that he’s...?” Ye Lingshan turned pale.

“Yes. The son of the Peng Emperor whose wings shattered all Daos and whose claws slaughtered heavenly geniuses. The Peng Emperor’s blood flows through his veins. He is said to be the Xuan Beasts’ strongest expert.” Nangong Zuiyue nodded, also staring at him.

“He is a true Emperor’s son. It is said that he obtained the Peng Emperor’s complete inheritance. For him to awaken now, he’s probably also aiming to corroborate his Dao,” said Zi Yan.

The Peng Emperor was one of the true three Emperors, the experts recognized throughout history to be second only to the Sovereigns. Kun Pengzi was the son of an Emperor, who had directly inherited his father’s bloodline.

Long Chen looked closely at Kun Pengzi. He was nine feet tall, taller than humans but not particularly tall for a Xuan Beast. However, his Blood Qi was incredibly strong.

His face looked like it had been carved by a knife. His nose was extremely high and had a slight hook at the end. There were runes flickering within his eyes.

“He’s a lightning cultivator?” Long Chen was startled.

“Yes. The Peng Emperor was born being able to control lightning. His killing power was exceptionally terrifying. As his son, Kun Pengzi is naturally able to use all his abilities,” said Beitang Rushuang.

Kun Pengzi nodded at Dongfang Yuyang without saying anything. Turning to Long Chen, he began to walk over.
