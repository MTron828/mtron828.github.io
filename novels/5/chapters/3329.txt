Chapter 3318 Facing the Devil Race

Those devil experts were fighting human experts. Well, to put it more accurately, they were chasing down the human experts.

The human experts were like a plate of sand, all of them fighting for themselves. Not only did they need to guard against their enemies, but they also had to be careful of the sneak attacks from their fellow human experts. As a result, the devil experts were slaughtering them.

In this situation, some of the experts that didn’t manage to run in time were quickly surrounded. The Yuhua Palace’s disciples were one group of those unlucky people.

Originally, they hadn’t been planning on fighting the devil race. After all, they numbered only a few hundred people. When those devil experts appeared, they only wanted to leave and distance themselves.

However, some confident human experts wanted to stand out and kill a few of them to spread their names. As a result, they were pushed forward by the crowd.

The devil race’s encirclement was already complete. There was nowhere for them to run now.

“It’s over. It’s all over.”

The Yuhua Palace’s disciples despaired. They were isolated from their allies and surrounded by the devil race’s experts.

They were slaughtered one by one. In front of the enemy’s terrifying display, they had given up on resisting.

BOOM!

At this moment, a bone saber slashed through the air, seemingly splitting heaven and earth in two. It swept right by the side of the Yuhua Palace’s disciples.

As a result, the devil experts assaulting them were blasted apart. Their encirclement was broken.

“It’s Long Chen!”

Startled cries rang out from the spectators. Long Chen had finally made his move.

“Finally, an expert from the human race is standing out.” An Immortal King of the Heavenly Rainbow Domain sighed with relief. He had arranged for other experts to handle all kinds of matters for Long Chen. As for Long Chen, during these days, he had given him face and didn’t cause any trouble. Now, as Long Chen was the first human to stand out, it felt like this Immortal King had gained face for himself.

The Yuhua Palace’s disciples were startled. They hadn’t expected someone to save them.

After that, space twisted and Bai Xiaole and the others appeared in front of them.

“Qi Yu!”

Yu Xuan cried out, her eyes reddening. Just now, she had thought that she was about to die. Then she would never see Qi Yu again.

“Don’t be afraid. We’re leaving!” said Qi Yu. As he said this, Bai Xiaole formed hand seals. Space twisted and they appeared outside the devil race’s army. Only Long Chen remained.

“Long Chen, he…!” Yu Xuan cried out when she saw Qi Yu and the others abandon Long Chen.Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

“Don’t worry, boss isn’t afraid of anyone. Hurry and gather the rainbow hydrangeas. Even if you can only grab one, it will still give you a chance of obtaining the Heavenly Rainbow Flame. Having a chance is always better than having no chance,” urged Qi Yu.

Although obtaining only a single rainbow hydrangea meant that they had almost no chance of being chosen by the Heavenly Rainbow Flame, a remote possibility was still better than no possibility.

Qi Yu and the others rushed out. As for Long Chen, he stood alone in an army of millions of devil experts. There was a lazy smile on his face, and his saber was on his shoulder.

Before any of those devil experts could speak, Long Chen said, “You said that the Heavenly Rainbow Flame is yours? How come I don’t like the sound of that? Boss Long San dislikes people who are more arrogant than me, and most infuriating of all, you aren’t even people. Don’t you think that you’re tired of living?”

“Inferior human, do you know who you’re talking to?” demanded the devil race expert that had opened the spatial gate. A sharp light appeared in his eyes.

Anyone who looked at him felt their eyes hurt. Some of them even began to bleed from their eyes, and those people hastily turned away and closed their eyes.

Long Chen lazily walked forward, indifferently saying, “Who you are means nothing to me. From the mortal world to the immortal world, I have always been slaying devils. I don’t know how many members of the devil race I’ve killed. No matter how powerful you are, you will simply become one of the souls fallen to my saber. There’s no need for you to report your name or your origin in any case, because I won’t remember it.”

“Hahaha!” That devil expert raised his head and laughed. As he did, more and more devil qi poured out of the spatial gate.

Everyone was shocked. People had tried to attack the spatial gate, only to find that it didn’t seem to have a physical form. Their attacks were useless.

As a result, the devil qi rapidly infected this world. The devil experts bared their teeth, looking like savage beasts that wanted to devour people.

“The human race is nothing more than the lowest lifeform of the nine heavens and ten lands, the latest of the six Daos to awaken spiritually. In the primal chaos era, the human race was the most foolish existence of the ten thousand spirits. In terms of power, you were the weakest. In terms of speed, you were the slowest. In terms of bloodline inheritance, you didn’t have any. Amongst all the races, the human race had the most difficulty growing. Now, you dare to say big words in front of the grand devil race? Are you trying to make us laugh to death?” The devil expert laughed contemptuously.

Countless human experts clenched their teeth furiously at his words, but they couldn’t retort. The human race’s history truly was inferior to other races. In the primal chaos era and the desolate era, the human race was the weakest.

At this time, the devil qi had formed a powerful domain. Moreover, all the rainbow hydrangeas in this domain were absorbed by this devil.

Long Chen slowly smiled disdainfully. He wasn’t anxious at all seeing this devil absorbing those rainbow hydrangeas. He indifferently said, “The human race had a slow start, but that doesn’t mean that the human race is weak. It’s the opposite. If the human race is weak, why is it that no matter if it’s the devil, demon, ghost, monster, beast, and other races, they always transform into human form to cultivate after reaching a certain realm? It’s because the human form is most suitable for comprehending the Heavenly Daos. Only the human race receives the care of the heavens, a natural advantage. The human race was originally the weakest of the races, and despite that, under your brutal slaughter, we still managed to rise up. You mock us because you are afraid of us. You are afraid that one day, the human race will reach the peak of the six Daos and settle our debts with you.”

Long Chen’s voice resounded throughout this space, his voice full of confidence. It uplifted countless humans, and they almost wanted to cheer for him. His retort was perfect.

“Afraid? Hahaha!” The devil expert laughed. But this time, his laughter was filled with fury. This anger seemed to confirm Long Chen’s words that had clearly stabbed this devil where it hurt.

“Alright, then right here, I will teach the human race a lesson. I’ll show you just how trash the human race is.”

As the devil expert spread his arms, the space fractured. Heaven and earth collapsed. At that moment, even Immortal Kings became terrified.
