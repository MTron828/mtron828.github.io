Chapter 3672

A giant lotus rose out of the sea. It was so gigantic that it filled the entire sky.

The lotus was flawless. It was what was emitting the white light, which was the condensation of faith energy. When it appeared, the net of faith energy in the sky instantly multiplied in power.

This lotus was the Nine Underworld Island’s divine pool, the thing that stored their faith energy. As it contained the mental energy of countless generations of Nine Underworld Hunters, it had enough power to shake the entire world.

Even Long Chen felt a suffocating feeling. They were facing the faith energy of countless generations. It made them seem completely insignificant.

Liao Bencang stood on top of the lotus. Under his divine radiance, he appeared grand and noble. The current him was a high and mighty existence, one that made others automatically feel the urge to kowtow toward him.

This was the power of a god. It was the result of gathering small bits of faith energy into a soaring tower, and the god stood at the top of it. People used faith energy to turn him into an incomparably glorious existence and then worshiped him, making him become the mental pillar of his believers. He was the light that lit up their paths.

“Long Chen, you destroyed my Star Peering Heavenly Mirror. Are you really going to force this god to personally capture you?” Liao Bencang coldly overlooked the three of them from atop his faith lotus.

His voice echoed throughout heaven and earth, and heaven and earth echoed his voice back. It was like the world was supporting him.

“This god? Your throne hasn’t even appeared. In other words, this is not your true body but another avatar. A little avatar also dares to be arrogant? Do you think that I am a three-year-old child? It’s not like I haven’t seen gods before. Cut the crap coming from your donkey mouth! Let us three brothers experience just how powerful a so-called god is!” sneered Long Chen.

Liao Bencang’s aura was incredible, but Long Chen still saw a glimmer of hope. That glimmer of hope was the fact that his throne had yet to appear.

Based on his time with Leng Yueyan and Ming Cangyue, he knew that in order for a god to unleash their full power, they had to have their throne with them.

Furthermore, in order to use the throne’s full power, a god had to come with their true body. An avatar was unable to do so. Although Long Chen didn’t know what Liao Bencang’s throne was, he knew that this lotus before him was definitely not his throne.

At the same time as he saw hope, he also saw just how terrifying true gods were. This was the greatest difference between immortal cultivators and god cultivators. Other than a bit of Liao Bencang’s own power here, most of it came from his endless believers.

Immortal cultivators relied on their own power, while god cultivators relied on borrowing power from countless people.

Thus, the branching immortal and god paths were formed. God cultivators gathered countless grains of sand to make a soaring tower, while immortal cultivators relied entirely on their own efforts.

Immortal cultivators viewed god cultivators as con men who tricked others into giving them their faith energy, while god cultivators viewed immortal cultivators as destitute weaklings who didn’t even have the power to have their own believers, while being envious of their accomplishments.

However, it was publicly recognized throughout the nine heavens and ten lands that god cultivators were stronger than immortal cultivators. But the precondition for that was that they were in the same realm.

Even so, immortal cultivators had their own strong points. They advanced faster than god cultivators because they didn’t need to gather faith energy. Faith energy was an energy source but also a restriction. It restricted the cultivation speed of god cultivators, especially upon reaching the World King realm. After that, their cultivation speed fell even more.

Unless you had the support of a powerful backer, all god cultivators who reached that point would have their cultivation speed thrown into the distance by immortal cultivators.

Even though their realm couldn’t keep up, in terms of true combat power, god cultivators were still unrivaled in the same realm. Some powerful god cultivators could rely on a thick foundation of faith energy to challenge people across realms.

Thus, the current Liao Bencang might only be a peak World King who hadn’t even become a half-step Divine Venerate, but the pressure that he gave off was even greater than the half-step Divine Venerates that Long Chen and the others had encountered. Even though his current self was an avatar, there was simply no way to compare them.

Only now that he was facing Liao Bencang did Guo Ran understand what Long Chen had been saying. Experts like Liao Bencang and Enpuda were truly terrifying.

Seeing that Long Chen wasn’t giving up, Liao Bencang sneered, “Little ant, you dare to say such big words. It’s too bad that the Nine Underworld Luocha hasn’t come out of seclusion yet. Otherwise, I’d have her personally end you.” ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

“Someone who has been defeated dares to come again? Have you already forgotten how she screamed in my hands while I destroyed your avatars?” sneered Long Chen.

At that time, Long Chen had captured the Nine Underworld Luocha and was burning her soul. Enpuda and Liao Bencang both attacked to save her, only to result in Enpuda using Liao Bencang to distract the others while he himself fled. He caused Liao Bencang to lose two avatars.

When Long Chen brought that up, Liao Bencang’s face twisted with fury. That was his life’s greatest humiliation. Hence, his anger soared.

“It was because of that idiot Enpuda wanting to spare your life that things went that way. But today, there is no Enpuda present. Do you think that you can live?!” roared Liao Bencang.

“What a thick face! So you push the blame for last time’s failure entirely on Enpuda? To tell the truth, I really do feel a bit threatened by Enpuda because his schemes are quite sinister. If the Nine Underworld Island was his domain, I would not dare to come here with my current strength,” said Long Chen disdainfully.

Even as Long Chen spoke disdainfully, he was fully circulating his astral energy inside, preparing to enter his strongest state. They had to fight today.

Fortunately, against the current Liao Bencang, he felt that they should have some hope. If it was against Enpuda instead, they would be doomed. Enpuda wouldn’t even give them a chance to fight him head-on. He would directly scheme them to death.

Guo Ran and Xia Chen were also tense. They were all in a combat-ready state. They knew that they were facing the greatest challenge of their lives, so they didn’t dare to be the slightest bit careless.

“Bullshit! Are you saying that I’m inferior to that damn fatty?!” Liao Bencang was incensed by this provocation.

“Although I really loathe that damn fatty, I have to admit that he truly is powerful. He’s also a schemer and knows how to endure. As for you, you’re an idiot. I don’t know why Lord Brahma cares about you. Why does he even accept you as his dog? Are you still stalling because you want to apply mental pressure on me? You want my mind to fracture so you can do a soulsearch and see my secrets? Ah, what a shame that other than roaring, you have no other ability. To tell the truth, I’m unable to keep watching as an idiot like you acts like some brilliant strategist. You don’t need to keep up this terrible act. If you’re trying to break my mind, you overestimate yourself too much,” sneered Long Chen. In terms of intelligence, Liao Bencang simply wasn’t on the same level as Enpuda.

“Ignorant brat, die!” Liao Bencang finally lost his patience after being exposed. As he waved his hand, a sword appeared in his hand and swung toward the three of them.
