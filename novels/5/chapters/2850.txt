Chapter 2839 Hope of Lei Linger Awakening

Li Cai and the others’ jaws fell to the ground. Long Chen’s cultivation base was clearly lower than theirs, but he had defeated this terrifying Rushing Lightning Tiger with a single attack.

The Rushing Lightning Tiger was famous for its power. Not only was it fast, but if struck by its lightning, you would be at least paralyzed, if not killed.

A group of a hundred with the right weapons still wouldn’t provoke it lightly. One mistake would cost lives. In the worst case, the entire group might be wiped out.

However, such a terrifying beast couldn’t stand up to a single blow from Long Chen. These disciples had never seen an existence as terrifying as Long Chen. Despite his cultivation base clearly being lower, there was an uncrossable gap between them.

They now believed that it was the truth when Long Chen had said that not even tens of thousands of them would be able to kill him.

At this moment, Long Chen opened his hand and pressed it against the tiger’s head. Sparks flew out of his palm as he absorbed its thunderforce.

Its thunderforce might be fatal to others, but it was a great nourishment to Lei Linger. That was why Long Chen hadn’t had Li Cai and the others fight it. It was to avoid wasting its thunderforce.

The runes covering its body slowly dimmed until they were gone. Long Chen then split open its head and took out a palm-sized crystal containing terrifying thunderforce.

Upon holding this crystal, a dragon mark lit up on Long Chen’s arm. Lei Linger was being nourished by this energy.

After an incense stick’s worth of time, the crystal core grew dim and shattered, all of its energy absorbed.

“Too bad. There wasn’t enough energy. If I had ten of these, perhaps Lei Linger would awaken,” sighed Long Chen inside.

If Lei Linger could awaken, that would be of immense help to him. He would be able to purify his pills, bestowing them additional spirituality. He hadn’t expected to run into such a nice surprise here.

“How many Rushing Lightning Tigers are here?” asked Long Chen.

“Quite a few. They’re an extremely difficult existence to deal with here, so most hunting squads avoid them,” answered Li Cai reverently.

At first, they had only submitted to Long Chen’s viciousness. However, Long Chen had awakened their talent and even displayed astonishing combat power. Because of it, their reverence grew.

“Alright. Then we’ll go with the goal of finding more Rushing Lightning Tigers. Any beasts we encounter on the way will be left to you. Let me just warn you that I am very clear on how powerful you all are. I will personally deal with any beasts that are beyond you, but I won’t help you if you are able to handle them and are simply messing up. If fatalities occur due to your cowardice or bad cooperation, I won’t take action. Your lives are your own, so fight for them. Fight to change your fates. If you don’t work hard yourself, others won’t help you,” said Long Chen.

He had to first make things clear, otherwise, these people might think that they were safe due to seeing how powerful he was. If that was the case, they wouldn’t go all-out.

“Instructor Long Chen, we’ve completely transformed and are no longer the old cowards. Although this is just the outer region, if our luck is bad, we might encounter a Divine Flame realm beast. Those are existences that even Divine Flame experts find difficult to deal with…” said one disciple.

Long Chen frowned. “I don’t like repeating myself. I told you that I will personally take action if any beasts that surpass your limits appear. Let’s go!”

After hearing that, the disciples’ hearts shook. From his tone, it seemed that even Divine Flame beasts weren’t anything to him? Was he able to defeat these vicious beasts across realms?

They were unaware that fighting across realms was as normal as eating to Long Chen. Even when his mortal qi had yet to regress, he had the confidence to beat these brainless beasts.

An hour later, the Elite Group finally encountered a Bloodthirsty Wild Ape. After a bloody battle with over ten of them being injured, Li Cai found an opportunity to cut off its head.

Almost all of them were covered in blood, but an excited light shone in their eyes. The thirty-six of them had managed to defeat a Bloodthirsty Wild Ape by themselves. That was unthinkable to their previous selves.

“Instructor Long Chen, our display wasn’t bad, right?” said Li Cai probingly, but he wasn’t able to conceal his pleased expression.

“Trash.” Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

Long Chen eyed him and spat out a merciless judgment.

Immediately, the disciples’ excitement was extinguished. This accomplishment of theirs was viewed as trash by Long Chen.

“In an incense stick’s worth of time, you made seventeen fatal mistakes and lost thirty-one chances to kill it. Instead, you wasted all that time and ended up injuring yourselves. Let me tell you, that Bloodthirsty Wild Ape wasn’t beaten to death by you. It was enraged to death by having to fight your trash display,” said Long Chen coldly.

Now, those disciples felt lost and dejected. Seeing their expressions, Long Chen sighed. Perhaps he shouldn’t judge them according to the Dragonblood Legion’s standards.

After his criticism, he explained their mistakes in detail and the chances they should have grasped.

“If you see a chance and don’t take the risk, that’s a coward’s way. Cowards are afraid of dying. They’re afraid of dying because they lack confidence in themselves. If you have enough confidence, you won’t be quibbling about the consequences. The most infuriating thing to me is that some people closed their eyes while blocking attacks. Are you stupid? You can’t even conquer such an instinct. Do you even want to change your fates?” said Long Chen darkly.

People had an instinct to shut their eyes when a head-on blow struck them. That protected their eyes from the impact.

However, a cultivator had to conquer that instinct, especially in a fight where their divine sense wasn’t strong enough. They had to use their eyes to track their opponent. Closing their eyes in combat was courting death, but some of these disciples didn’t even have this common sense.

Although Long Chen was angry, he didn’t point out who exactly those fellows were. That was because he also sympathized with these fellows. They also couldn’t help it.

“Instructor Long Chen, I was wrong. Next time, even if I have to die, I will keep my eyes open,” declared one of the disciples. He clenched his fists in determination.

Long Chen nodded. “Being weak now isn’t a sin. I have ten thousand ways to make you stronger. But if you don’t have the heart to become stronger, then even a million methods would be useless. Everything depends on yourselves. Remember, in battle, you must forget about death, forget about fear. You must only have a conviction to kill your enemies. Confidence is groomed through combat, and it is something piled up through countless victories. That’s why every battle must be a victory. There can be no defeats.”

After saying that, Long Chen repeated the mistakes they had made with the Bloodthirsty Wild Ape. He also transmitted some of the basics of combat. Anything too profound and they wouldn’t understand.

An hour of revising and helping people heal with medicine passed before they continued on their path.

They had barely set out this time when they encountered a hunting squad of three hundred people. When this group saw Long Chen and the others, they actually immediately charged up and surrounded them.
