Chapter 3208 Two Headed Six Horn Sea Serpent

“Deep sea devil race!”

When Luo Xue said these four words, her voice trembled. Long Chen then saw expressions of terror appear on the other experts’ faces.

“How could the Deep Sea Devil race appear?! That damn Chu family, what did they do to even draw them out?!” cursed the Luo family’s experts.

Long Chen had read countless books in the High Firmament Academy’s library, but there were no records of the devil sea inside it. It was a taboo topic that could not be written on paper.

“I don’t know how many of the deep sea devils will appear. Will we be able to hold on?”

Just then, a sharp alarm pierced across the battlefield, and all the experts retreated. Bai Xiaole then ordered his army to be the rearguard.

Long Chen suddenly noticed that the seawater had changed. The sapphire blue water was turning black, and Long Chen saw dark figures rising out of the depths like black clouds. Sinister auras gradually got closer.

BOOM!

The black seawater exploded and a giant figure charged across the surface of the water. It was a two-headed serpent.

“Six Horn Sea Serpent?” Long Chen was startled. This was something that he had encountered on the Martial Heaven Continent. Was the Six Horn Sea Serpent actually a species from the immortal world?

However, this Six Horn Sea Serpent had two heads, and its horns were golden just like its scales. Also, its pupils were not vertical like the Six Horn Sea Serpent on the Martial Heaven Continent, but horizontal.

As soon as it appeared, devil qi erupted. That aura was sinister, ominous, and bloody. Just feeling that aura drew out the fear in the depths of people’s souls.

“A Divine Lord realm deep sea devil, the Two Headed Six Horn Sea Serpent!” Luo Xue cried out in shock, recognizing this sea serpent.

“Nice! This one is mine!”

Bai Xiaole cried out as well, but his cry was one of excitement. Stars were shining in his eyes. This was the mightiest monster he had ever seen. He then quickly formed hand seals, sending his army of Deep Sea Crocodile Bulls at the Two Headed Six Horn Sea Serpent.

Those crocodile bulls were as large as mountains, but they appeared much smaller in the face of the Six Horn Sea Serpent.

With just a single roar from the Six Horn Sea Serpent, those crocodile bulls stopped in their tracks. At this moment, the mark of the Three Flower Pupils dimmed, and expressions of terror replaced that mark. Bai Xiaole was shocked. They were actually escaping his control.

“Explode!”

Bai Xiaole instantly had a bad feeling when saw the souls of the crocodile bulls shaking. Just as he started to feel like he would lose control, he took the initiative to detonate them.

As a result, those crocodile bulls charged at the sea serpent and detonated one by one. The explosions shook the sea, unleashing huge waves.

When three hundred crocodile bulls exploded together, their power could be considered equal to an ultimate destructive move. But the sea serpent was only forced back by it, not injured.

Bai Xiaole was surprised but also delighted. He then quickly formed hand seals, and his manifestation of a large pair of eyes appeared behind him. They were like the eyes of a heavenly god.

Affected by the eyes, the golden sea serpent shuddered and became immobile. A faint mark slowly appeared in its eyes.

“Damn, this little fellow has some ability.”

Bai Xiaole’s pupil arts were somehow effective against this sea serpent. That was a bit outside of Long Chen’s expectations.

It had to be known that those Deep Sea Crocodile Bulls were fourth rank sea demons whose combat power was only at the level of ordinary Divine Lords. Outside of the sea, their power was also limited.

However, this sea serpent was different. Based on that towering devil qi and its astonishing bloodline pressure, it was almost on par with a Primal Divine Lord. Even such a terrifying lifeform was unable to resist the Three Flower Pupils?

Bai Xiaole had just awakened his bloodline power, and his control over the Three Flower Pupils was still rough. But he could still do this.

Based on this, it seemed possible that the Heavenly Eye race truly possessed the ability to hack stars, slash moons, and invert the cosmos. Perhaps that was no exaggerated legend.

“Qin Feng, take the right!”

Long Chen suddenly shouted. Qin Feng was beside Bai Xiaole, protecting him. He immediately swung his saber to the right.

No Dragonblood warrior ever slacked when it came to Long Chen’s orders, so he reacted instantly. That didn’t just require absolute trust but also constant drilling and training to create that habit. This habit could decide life or death.

When Qin Feng’s saber fell, the sea exploded. Another giant sea serpent’s tail was whipping toward Bai Xiaole with shocking speed. However, this tail struck Qin Feng’s saber just as he attacked. As a result, the saber-image exploded, and the tail was knocked away. Huge waves erupted on the sea.

Qin Feng’s expression changed. That attack came without any warning. If it hadn’t been for Long Chen’s warning, Bai Xiaole would have been struck. He couldn’t move while he was trying to control the sea serpent.

“Xiaole, leave! There’s not just one sea serpent!” shouted Qin Feng. There was no longer any time for Bai Xiaole to do his thing. Hence, Qin Feng grabbed him and ran.

Just then, the water exploded once more, and two giant heads soared out. Just as Qin Feng said his warning, another two-headed golden sea serpent charged out. One of those mouths opened, unleashing a giant spinning water arrow.

It was as quick as lightning and pierced through a distant mountain. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Just then, the Three Flower Pupils spun in Bai Xiaole’s eyes and space settled. He and Qin Feng appeared beside Long Chen. He had used his spatial art to dodge that water arrow.

One sea serpent after another appeared out of the water. Upon seeing this, people’s hearts sank. These sea serpents were no ordinary sea demons. They had devil qi coiling around them, so they were the true devils from the depths of the sea. They were nightmares.

“What a pity. Just a bit more and I would have had it. Damnit, if only I had listened to mom and trained more, I definitely could have controlled it!” said Bai Xiaole hatefully.

Ever since his bloodline had awakened, Bai Xiaole started to get flighty. Having awakened so many divine abilities at once, he almost felt unmatched.

He had no sense of danger, nor did he have the patience to bitterly practice those abilities. He couldn’t endure that boredom and dullness. He only liked it when others stared at him in shock and worship.

Now he regretted it. If he had listened to his mother, he wouldn’t have needed so much time to take control of the sea serpent.

As furious roars rang out, hundreds of golden sea serpents charged out. What shocked Long Chen was that their target was actually Qin Feng.

He suddenly came to a realization. “These deep sea devils didn’t come out because of the Chu family. They were drawn over by the resonance dragon blood.”

“What?” Luo Xue and the others were startled.
