Chapter 3986 Trap

“Do you see? This is the result of focusing too much on martial arts. Instead of talking reason, you just want to use violence. Violence cannot solve problems. We have managed to develop our culture to this point, but you are still using the most primitive, barbaric methods to deal with issues!” raged Philosopher Sun.

“Pure nonsense. Your so-called culture is nothing more than a thin veil over your barbaric, hypocritical self. You, a so-called cultured person, think yourselves superior and can pass judgment on everything, like you should be the ones to decide other people’s fates. Do you think you are some kind of saint? I spit on you. Our enemies have come to our door, and you are still helping them speak. You dare to eat our food while working for the other side? You dare to be so wanton? Have you gotten so used to peace that you’ve forgotten the essence of this world? People can talk reason with other people, but can they talk reason with animals? You, someone who hasn’t even roamed the entire Vermilion Bird Empire, dare to speak of a worldview? Have you seen the ghouls from hell? Have you seen the devils of the devil world? Have you seen the ten thousand races? You haven’t seen jackshit. Did you think reading a few books would allow you to understand the universe? Hmph, I’ve read more books than you’ve ever seen. What right do you have to be arrogant? The essence of this world is that if there is reason to speak of, we can talk reason, and if there is no reason to speak of, we can only talk with our fists. As for your so-called culture? It’s a high-sounded excuse for the wolf to eat the sheep. The bloody greedy nature hasn’t changed at all. You, an old fogey who doesn’t understand anything, wish to stall the development of an empire. Did you think that when devils, ghosts, demons, and monsters come to slaughter you, they will listen to your foolish rambling?”

Long Chen’s voice grew louder and louder until the entire palace was shaking. Moreover, his icy killing intent made this place seem like a bloody battlefield.

“You… you… pfft!”

Philosopher Sun suddenly coughed up blood and passed out, but someone immediately caught him. He found that Philosophen Sun was only unconscious. However, it was unknown if it was from anger or fright.

“No matter how loud you talk, it means nothing. You can’t scare anyone. Also, I don’t know what you are intending. Do you represent the attitude of the Vermilion Bird Empire?” asked the elder of the Heavenly Ruler Seal Empire.

“Long Chen is currently a commoner of my Vermilion Bird Empire. And for a regular commoner to possess such great vision, how could my imperial family be so short-sighted? The Vermilion Bird Empire has no wild ambitions of expanding our territory or bullying others. We only want to get stronger to protect our people. No matter how the future changes, no matter if our enemies are devils, ghosts, demons, or monsters, we will have the power to protect every single person in the empire. They will not need to set foot onto the cruel battlefield,” said Jiang Huixin lightly.

She was clearly supporting Long Chen. This was why she had demanded Long Chen to participate in the state banquet. Thus, despite Yu Xiaoyun’s objections, she still gave the command for Long Chen to be summoned.

In the end, Long Chen didn’t betray her expectations. He fearlessly expressed words that might have been difficult for the imperial family to say, cursing their opponents on her behalf.

After all, Long Chen didn’t have to worry about his status, so he could curse or attack anyone he wanted. What he had said caused Jiang Huixin to cheer for him inside even though she couldn’t express it.

“Well said. Then how are you going to guarantee that after you get stronger, you won’t bully the neighboring empires?” demanded that young Double Supreme from the Heavenly Ruler Seal Empire.

“Are you saying that the Vermilion Bird Empire must cripple themselves for you to feel at peace?” sneered Long Chen.

“Ignoring everything else, the first thing would be to hand you over, you bastard! Otherwise, the Vermilion Bird Empire should just wait to be greeted with swords!” At this time, Weng Tianyao stood up.

“You’re the bastard! You’re practically bullying us!” Before Long Chen replied, Zhu Yifeng was already roaring. Although he hadn’t been with Long Chen for long, he felt great admiration for Long Chen, to the extent that it was even somewhat worshipful. He couldn’t help himself when Long Chen was insulted like this.

This caused all the princes and princesses to be startled. The always cowardly Zhu Yifeng who had never dared to lift his head actually drew all the attention to himself at this time.

When Zhu Yifeng stood up for Long Chen, his mother’s eyes lit up with a touch of pride. This was what a man should be like.

“So what? If you don’t like it, let’s fight!” Weng Tianyao sneered and stood.VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

Long Chen’s heart skipped a beat. He was about to stop it, but Zhu Yifeng was already responding. “Come!”

Long Chen immediately cursed inside. Zhu Yifeng was not a match for Weng Tianyao. Moreover, Weng Tianyao had intentionally set a trap for Zhu Yifeng, taking advantage of the latter’s impulsiveness, which clouded his judgment at the moment.

“Weng Tianyao, you are quite despicable! If you have the guts, come at me!” Long Chen glared at Weng Tianyao, his killing intent blazing.

“He’s the one who agreed to it. If he’s afraid of death, he can back out. I won’t force him to fight. However, hehe, I know that the Vermilion Bird Empire’s people care a great deal about face. If he can be so shameless as to renege on his agreement, I won’t mind it!” sneered Weng Tianyao.

“Every man in the Vermilion Bird Empire is a real man capable of holding up the heavens. We don’t take back our word. I, Zhu Yifeng, am an imperial disciple with the Jiuli bloodline of my ancestors. Even if I fight to the death, I will not frown!” declared Zhu Yifeng angrily.

Long Chen began to panic inside. This foolish child, what happened to his calmness? Did he not know his own limits? But this matter was now linked to the royal family’s face, so there was no way for Long Chen to stop him.

“Hurry up and think of a way to stop this fool. Weng Tianyao will kill him!” transmitted Long Chen to Yu Qingxuan.

Long Chen had fought Weng Tianyao before and knew his true power. In his estimation, not even three Zhu Yifengs would be enough to beat one Weng Tianyao.

“Your Majesty, please open the martial stage. Why not let my Violet Thunderclap Empire exchange pointers with your Vermilion Bird Empire? It can count as dinner entertainment,” said the elder beside Weng Tianyao.

Jiang Huixin and Xu Lanxin’s expressions were ugly. They looked at Yu Xiaoyun, and he said, “Prepare the stage. Let me see whose guts are bigger.”

That final sentence was clearly a threat. On the surface, it was praise for Zhu Yifeng’s bravery, while on the other side, it was a warning to Weng Tianyao. If he really had the guts, he could try to kill his son.

“Long Chen, don’t worry. No matter how powerful Weng Tianyao is, he won’t dare to kill Zhu Yifeng,” comforted Yu Qingxuan.

“Foolish girl, you’re thinking too simply. Weng Tianyao truly does dare to kill Zhu Yifeng. He could simply claim that it was an accidental death, citing that blades have no eyes. With the eight nations present, it’s evident they came prepared. Perhaps they wish to kill Yifeng to test the Vermilion Bird Empire’s response. Unless the emperor is willing to wage war against all eight empires at once, he will have no choice but to swallow this. However, if the Vermilion Bird Empire wishes to start a war, they must have a justifiable reason. Going to war solely due to an accidental death from a mutually agreed-upon combat would only fuel rumors that the empire is acting out of pettiness and without a just cause. Such actions could stain their reputation as sore losers. But if you don’t go to war, it will be a serious blow to the empire’s morale. That’s why these fellows are extremely vicious,” said Long Chen darkly.

Only then did Yu Qingxuan realize that she had been thinking too simply. But it was at this moment that a circular design lit up at the center of the banquet hall, and a martial stage appeared inside.

Suddenly, two rays of light shot out of the martial stage, sucking in Weng Tianyao and Zhu Yifeng.
