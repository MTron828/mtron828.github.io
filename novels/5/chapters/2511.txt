Chapter 2501 Three Emperor Manifestation

Those three figures in Dongfang Yuyang’s manifestation were the Stone Emperor, the Blood Emperor, and the Peng Emperor.

Dongfang Yuyang had endured and concealed his power for so long just to steal the inheritance of these three figures. This ability was truly terrifying. Were Heaven-Seizers truly capable of stealing the good fortune of heaven and earth?

Having displayed his manifestation, Dongfang Yuyang’s aura instantly transformed. The might of an Emperor erupted, and the Heaven Devouring Black Armor Corps was blasted to bits just from this pressure.

“I now have the protection of three Emperors. The inheritance of an Emperor can only display its full potential in my hands. Di Feng was just an idiot who thought himself clever. He thought that copulating with Xue Luocha would allow him to obtain the complete inheritance of the Blood Emperor. He had no idea that the inheritance of an Emperor requires taking it from the Heavenly Daos as well. He took it from the Human Dao but never received the recognition of the Heavenly Daos. In his hands, the inheritance of the Blood Emperor was completely wasted. Only I am qualified to possess this inheritance, because only I am capable of unleashing the true glory of the Emperors’ inheritances. Long Chen, I wasn’t planning on killing you this early, but you’re too dangerous. You know too much, so I have no choice but to kill you.” Dongfang Yuyang’s eyes sparkled with three different colors, appearing strange and frightening.

Long Chen shook his head. “Don’t you think you’re being too shortsighted? If I were you, I would have continued enduring. If you had, then Mo Nian and I would have probably killed Di Feng here. Since you were too impatient to wait for that, there are only two possibilities. One is that you lost patience and were willing to expose yourself to kill him due to this impatience. The other is that after killing him, you are no longer afraid of exposing your identity as a Heaven-Seizer, meaning that you believe you no longer have a match in this world. You’re no longer afraid of the trial of the Martial Heaven Continent.”

“Hahaha!” Dongfang Yuyang laughed. “You’re right, I’m no longer afraid of anyone. Even someone above the Netherpassage realm cannot kill me, so who cares? Long Chen, you’re quite smart, but there’s actually another reason why I took the risk of killing Di Feng here that you haven’t guessed.”

“Oh? I’m interested in hearing what it is,” said Long Chen.

“It’s because of you.”

“Me?”

Dongfang Yuyang’s gaze was icy. “Yes, you. I don’t want to allow you to live another day in this world. Every day that you’re alive pains me. From the moment I saw you, I detested you. You’re just a frog at the bottom of a well. Your background cannot compare to me and neither can your true power. In terms of looks, I far surpass you. A person like you is only there to show off just how incredible I am in comparison. I cannot understand why those people would like you and not give me a second glance.”

Dongfang Yuyang’s face twisted with rancor. It was as if he felt that his gaze would be enough to poison someone to death. That was an immense level of hatred.

Long Chen was startled, not understanding immediately. It was Mo Nian who slapped his leg and laughed. “This idiot, so you are just jealous of his beauties? Hahaha, what a joke.”

“What is there to laugh at?!” Dongfang Yuyang roared. Four voices intertwined into one and shook Mo Nian’s ears, making him jump.

Dongfang Yuyang pointed at Long Chen sinisterly. “Who do you think you are? In my era, what woman wasn’t infatuated with me? With no exception, they wished to be with me. So how did an oaf like you end up with the favor of so many beautiful women?! Ye Lingshan is like that, Nangong Zuiyue is like that, Beitang Rushuang is like that! Even the Zither Fairy and the Pill Fairy only have eyes for you! Are they all blind?!”

Jealousy was truly a powerful poison. It had no cure. The more arrogant someone was, the stronger this poison was. Dongfang Yuyang looked as if even tearing Long Chen to pieces wouldn’t be enough to satisfy the hatred in his heart.

Dongfang Yuyang appeared to be a perfect man in other people’s eyes. In his view, women should be infatuated with such a man. In his era, he was the strongest expert, with the strongest talent and the strongest background.

However, background, talent, power, none of those were what Dongfang Yuyang was proudest of. No, his most conceited area was his looks that he felt could infatuate any woman.

Seeing their worshipful gazes made him feel even more accomplished than advancing his cultivation base or defeating powerful enemies. It was what he lived for.

Dongfang Yuyang had always lived alone, refusing to be with any woman. What he enjoyed was not one person, but the feeling of being worshipped by countless people.

He enjoyed being a flawless image in other people’s hearts that they dreamed of.

In his era, he was the figure that women dreamed of obtaining, a thorn in the side of all men. He very much enjoyed that feeling.

The worship of women and the envy of men. That was the meaning of his existence. Even his cultivation was second compared to that.

After being sealed and woken in this age, Dongfang Yuyang was prepared to once more do the same to the new era of people.

Just as he thought he would be the number one perfect man of the Martial Heaven Continent, he encountered Long Chen. He was like a mountain in the face of a breeze, blocking him completely.

When Dongfang Yuyang had invited Ye Lingshan to come to the gathering, her eyes had clearly brightened. However, that was not the look of worship that he sought. Furthermore, when she looked at Long Chen, her gaze was always so warm.

At that time, Dongfang Yuyang had felt dislike for Long Chen, but he hadn’t known whether it was because of Ye Lingshan or because of Long Chen himself.

Also, he was someone with great endurance and never exposed these feelings for others to see. He even invited Long Chen to embarrass him during the gathering.

As a result, at the gathering, Nangong Zuiyue and Beitang Rushuang had both ended up becoming friendly with Long Chen as soon as they met. They were even joking and laughing. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

As for when the two of them spoke to Dongfang Yuyang, they were clearly simply maintaining a respectful courtesy. But being with Long Chen, they were relaxed and at ease. That was unacceptable to him.

To be the focus of everyone was the area he was most confident in. Having Long Chen take the spotlight away from him was torture.

He had then urged the sea demon race to target Long Chen, not expecting that this would result in the sea demon race coming to beat him up.

At that time, he had felt like he might go crazy. He had almost been unable to resist exposing his true power and slaughtering those sea demons.

In the end, the head of the Dongfang family had ordered him to endure. Starting then, Dongfang Yuyang started to fade from people’s sight.

He hadn’t even dared to leave the house because he knew he had become the laughingstock of the continent. He had fallen from the ranks of the top experts.

Those days had been even worse torture than before. He hated Long Chen. He hated that he was unable to extricate himself from this position.

Through his efforts, he had finally managed to obtain Di Feng’s trust, using Long Chen and Mo Nian to scheme against Di Feng. Today, he decided to no longer endure this torture. Any more and he felt like he really would go insane.

Long Chen and Mo Nian were both completely shocked. They had never expected that the reason Dongfang Yuyang hated Long Chen so much was just because of his relationships with women. This reason was truly unexpected. If others had said such a thing, it would simply be treated as a joke. But the way that Dongfang Yuyang looked right now, it seemed he wasn’t acting. Furthermore, he had no reason to joke about this.

“Do you see? Long Chen, you’ve taken in too many women. The heavens are enraged, as are other people. To tell the truth, if our relationship wasn’t so good, I would join hands with him to kill you,” said Mo Nian.

“Are you planning on changing sides right before the battle?” asked Long Chen.

“That depends on how many benefits he can give me. If they’re big, then… it will be a difficult choice,” said Mo Nian helplessly.

“Shut up!” Dongfang Yuyang roared. Long Chen and Mo Nian were both laughing and joking at his expense. The shock they had displayed after learning that it was due to this reason that he had finally lost his patience and could no longer endure was particularly infuriating.

It was as if the two of them felt this to be an incredibly childish and laughable reason. That made him feel even worse. It was a wordless insult.

BOOM!

Dongfang Yuyang’s manifestation suddenly shook, and he slammed his hands on the earth, causing the land to begin rising violently.

Long Chen and Mo Nian immediately rose into the air. They saw the earth split open, and giant stalagmites shot into the air.

The spaces between the stalagmites were covered by a strange law, which made Long Chen and Mo Nian unable to avoid them. This large-area attack could only be received directly.

“Long Chen, I’ll leave this brute power work to you. I’ll provide support.” Mo Nian immediately fell back. A clash of brute power was not his specialty.

“The Stone Emperor’s power? Let me experience it.” Long Chen snorted. Dragon scales covered his body, and an azure dragon swam within his scales. A wild dragon might filled heaven and earth as he unleashed a punch.
