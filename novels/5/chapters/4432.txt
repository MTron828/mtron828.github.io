Chapter 4421 Sacred Light Pistil

The Earth Cauldron now exuded spiritual fluctuations that Long Chen could sense. Although it was very faint, the vast might contained within it made Long Chen’s soul quiver.

In front of this tiniest bit of spiritual pressure, Long Chen felt absolutely tiny. He didn’t even feel like this when he fought against Saints.

The Earth Cauldron returned to Long Chen’s spiritual space. This time, Long Chen wasn’t putting it in; rather, it was simply coming in by itself. Now, it could freely enter and leave his spiritual space.

“Thank you for what you’ve done for me. You will get the return on your investment.” Unexpectedly, the Earth Cauldron spoke to him.

Its voice was not male or female, more like the sound of the Grand Dao. Every syllable was disciplined, powerful, and also thought-provoking, as if its voice could allow him to see deeper into the mysteries of the cosmos.

“Senior is too courteous. It can be said that we have a destiny together. Last time, you even helped me with the counterfeits. I still have to thank you for that,” said Long Chen hastily.

Long Chen was pleasantly surprised to be able to communicate with the Earth Cauldron, a divine item from the primal chaos era. If he could obtain its help, he wouldn’t have to fear anything.

“That was because I also needed the energy of those corpses to recover. I helped you imitate the appearance of the Heaven Cauldron to see if I could create karma between you and the Heaven Cauldron, then you would be able to find my other half.”

As Long Chen heard this, his eyes lit up with excitement. “Senior, do you know where the Heaven Cauldron is? How about we go look for it right now?”

If he had the complete Heaven Earth Cauldron, he could annihilate even Saints with a single smash!

“There isn’t enough karma yet for us to find it. However, I have a feeling that it is about to emerge once again. We’ll still be in time to get it then. This time, the nourishment of your medicinal pills and Huo Linger’s help allow me to recover a trace of my Spiritual Strength, so I’m now capable of talking with you. I have something to ask of you,” said the Earth Cauldron.

“Senior, please ask!”

“That girl called Ye Xue, she is a Thousand Leaf Sacred Light Snow Lotus with the purest Spirit Root. Ask her if you can have one of her Sacred Light Pistils. If you can, transplant it into the primal chaos space to give rise to more Thousand Leaf Sacred Light Snow Lotuses. It is an extremely precious holy medicine. With it as a main ingredient, the pills you refine will have powerful sacred energy. It is something that the two of us urgently need,” said the Earth Cauldron.

“That… I’m not so sure I can ask something like that.”

Long Chen was in a difficult position. He wasn’t exactly sure what this Sacred Light Pistil was, but if it could be transplanted into the primal chaos space, it had to be the very core of a plant. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

In that case, the Sacred Light Pistil had to be extremely important to Ye Xue. Perhaps during normal times, he could just thicken his face to ask for it.

However, he had just done them a huge favor. Even Long Chen wasn't shameless enough to seek payment so soon.

“It is rather shameful. However, the Thousand Leaf Sacred Light Snow Lotus is exceedingly important to us right now,” sighed the Earth Cauldron.

It also knew that asking for such a thing was inappropriate. However, there was no way around it. The Thousand Leaf Sacred Light Snow Lotus was simply too precious and too rare. That was why the Long clan would go to such an effort just to obtain her.

“Long Chen, what is it?” Ye Ling inquired, observing Long Chen's peculiar expression. He opened his mouth several times, but the conflicted thoughts in his mind did not permit him to speak.

“Ah... It's a bit difficult for me to say,” Long Chen admitted, casting an awkward glance at Ye Ling and Ye Xue. In all his life, Long Chen had never been so embarrassed when he had to request for something.

“Big Brother Long Chen, do you need my help with something? Just tell me. Xue-er won’t turn you down,” said Ye Xue.

Long Chen was startled. He couldn’t help glaring at the Earth Cauldron inside his spiritual space. “Senior, you…”

“I didn’t say anything. She is a Thousand Leaf Sacred Light Snow Lotus, and her sacred energy makes her sharply perceptive to other people’s feelings,” answered the Earth Cauldron.

Tch, he should have just thrown out the Earth Cauldron and made it ask her. After all, it was the one who wanted this. Long Chen helplessly stuttered, “In-in truth… in truth…”

However, when it came down to it, Long Chen was unable to say it. Beads of sweat formed on his forehead, signaling his inner struggle.

Ye Xue seemed to see through Long Chen’s thoughts, and a warm smile appeared on her face. “Big Brother Long Chen, do you want my Sacred Light Pistil to increase your aptitude? Do you want to become a Heavenly Doyen with it? That is fine. I have three of them, so you can have two. Becoming a Doyen isn’t important to me. In any case, I don’t have any fighting skills, so helping you would be best.”

“No, no, I just need one! A single one! I’ll return it to you very soon!” said Long Chen hastily.

So Ye Xue only had three Sacred Light Pistils, but she wanted to give him two? Furthermore, it sounded like if she did so, she would no longer have a chance of becoming a Doyen.

Even then, there was no reluctance or hesitation in her voice, which made Long Chen feel incredibly guilty.

“You really just want one?” asked Ye Xue.

“Just one!” Long Chen nodded vigorously.

“That’s great. Then I still have a chance of becoming a Doyen.” Ye Xue smiled and extended her hand, condensing a foot-long pistil out of the sacred light flowing from her head.

A holy light bathed the world as immortal qi emanated from the earth, creating a swirling aura around them. This one pistil seemed to possess the power to change the world. When Ye Xue took it out, her face instantly paled. Despite her attempt to maintain a smile, it was evident that she had entered a weak state.

Observing her condition, Long Chen was overcome with a sense of distress. With two trembling hands, he accepted the Sacred Light Pistil and solemnly vowed, “I, Long Chen, will remember this favor.”

“Big Brother Long Chen, you’re too courteous. The Earth Spirit race owes you so much that we will never be able to repay you,” said Ye Xue.

“Dean Long Chen, mutually helping each other is simply natural among us. You don’t need to mind this favor so much.” Even Ye Ling pushed aside the pain of seeing Ye Xue like this to comfort Long Chen.

Long Chen nodded. After cupping his fists to Ye Xue and Ye Ling, he left, unable to bear their sincere gazes.

Once he was back in his own residence, he let out a sigh of relief. Looking at the Sacred Light Pistil in his hand, he didn’t feel any joy but a heavy burden instead. The feeling of owing others was truly difficult to bear.

“Don’t waste time. Plant it quickly. If we can refine the Sacred Light Snow Lotus Pill within three days, we can let Ye Xue grow back her Sacred Light Pistil,” urged the Earth Cauldron.

“Really?!”

Long Chen instantly jumped up and threw the Sacred Light Pistil into the primal chaos space.
