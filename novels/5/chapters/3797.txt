Chapter 3786 An Unexpected Surprise

Violet qi poured through Long Chen’s meridians. His meridians were starting to bulge and continue widening.

“Before they have fully settled, while they still have the remnant energy that the nine star heirs transmitted to you, widen them as much as possible. It is now possible for you to condense the seven stars. That is equivalent to having seven Dantians, but your meridians do not match your seven Dantians. In the future, if you are fighting all out, you will be able to fight for many hours. You will look as if you have immense endurance. A normal person would view this as the most dependable fighting style. But in truth, this is your fatal weakness. A true killing blow instantly sucks up the majority of a person’s energy. That is a true trump card. Such a killing blow must be fierce and give the other side little time to prepare. In the past, when you unleashed your ultimate moves against your enemies, it looked powerful. But in my eyes, it was the fighting of a fool. In true combat, one move decides life and death. Just like when your human race plays chess, they are fighting for the initiative.

“When you are unleashing an ultimate attack, if the other side reacts slightly too slow, victory or defeat will be decided. Powerful meridians are the gambling chips you need to fight for that initiative. There have been many times in the past when you spent too long accumulating energy, resulting in you missing many chances to kill your opponents. You could only clash with them like barbarians smashing each other with sticks. Even if you did win, you exhausted yourself. The competition of the martial path is one where you use the smallest price to defeat the strongest opponent. That is the King Dao. For example, in this tribulation, even if you defeated Kun Tu, you would still be killed by the others afterward. And even if you didn’t die to them, you would fall into the hands of the demonic beasts outside. However, this can’t be blamed on you. You are a human, and your physical body is limited. Furthermore, your Nine Star Hegemon Body Art is incomplete. You also don’t have a true master to guide you. That made you unable to see your fatal weakness. Now that you finally have a heaven-defying chance, cherish it. The widening limit of your meridians will determine your future,” warned the dragon expert sternly.

“I understand. Many thanks, senior!”

Long Chen was instantly enlightened. It was no wonder he always felt that no matter how strong he was, even if he had energy overflowing out of him, he was unable to put it to good use.

The problem was his meridians. Just as the dragon expert said, this was a heaven-defying opportunity, a chance to change his fate. He had to grasp it.

Long Chen had his violet qi push against his meridians as hard as he could. It was like they were inflating and swelling. They were already wider than before. But after two hours, he started feeling a sharp pain in his meridians.

Cracks instantly appeared in his meridians. However, he didn’t panic. The remnant energy within his meridians caused them to rapidly heal. At the same time, without Long Chen calling it, the energy of the primal chaos space poured in like a sea, healing his outer injuries and strengthening his meridians, increasing their toughness.

The energy within his meridians was bestowed upon him by the nine star heirs. Without the dragon expert’s reminder, he wouldn’t have even noticed.

When Long Chen thought of how that one nine star heir had torn apart the dome of the heavens with just his hands, breaking the restrictions of the Heavenly Daos arrogantly, he felt a burst of pain.

Even such a hero had been destroyed by the long river of history. No one knew just how strong they were back then.

Although they had died countless years ago, their heaven-defying wills remained. The Heavenly Daos replicated them, but they still tore through the battlefield that the Heavenly Daos had made for them with their bare hands. Just how domineering was that?

As a fellow nine star heir, Long Chen felt shame. He felt like he had lost face for the nine star heirs. Nine star heirs shouldn’t be as weak as him.

Once his meridians were fully healed, he once more poured violet qi through them, widening them. After he widened them three times, his starry sea quivered. The violet qi from his starry sea kept pushing. His meridians once more reached the limit.

Thankfully, the nine star heirs had left him with immense energy. His meridians quickly repaired themselves. Long Chen was already out of violet qi though. After that, he directly sent his astral energy pouring through his meridians.

Long Chen clenched his teeth. When his astral energy entered his meridians, sharp pain wracked his body. That pain was even greater when the nine star heirs stabbed his body with their lightning swords and incinerated the essence blood of the Beast Venerates.

“What… is… going on?”

The intense pain caused Long Chen’s expression to change. Veins throbbed on his forehead, and his eyes almost popped out of their sockets. It was like he might explode at any moment.

“How unexpected. Starry spots have appeared in your meridians. I don’t know if it is because your nine stars have started to change or if the nine star heirs intentionally left something to you. But it seems that your life isn’t in danger. Endure it. It should be beneficial,” said the dragon expert after pondering it.

Endure? That was putting it lightly. Even with his pain tolerance, Long Chen was unable to endure.

BOOM!

Long Chen suddenly started rolling and directly pierced a mountain peak in the distance. Jiang Lei jumped in shock. He was about to check on Long Chen when Long Chen stopped him.

Star-like spots appeared on his meridians, and astral energy was constantly pouring into his body. It was no longer under his control.

“AHH!”

Long Chen screamed. The entire mountain range collapsed.

Long Chen suddenly stamped on the air and shot into the clouds. His fists began to randomly strike the air. Every attack caused an ear-piercing explosion, and ripples appeared as the void was repeatedly blasted apart. It was like the heavens were being beaten.

Long Chen felt like he was going insane. He had never experienced such pain before. It was like his 108,000 stars were branding themselves on his meridians. He could only randomly shoot out this astral energy. That was the only way to feel slightly better.

BOOM!

BOOM!

BOOM!

Long Chen’s attacks gradually slowed down. But every attack caused cracks to spread throughout the sky, as if the world was being shattered.

“Boss, what’s going on? If you had this power, why didn’t you kill Kun Tu and the others?” Jiang Lei watched in astonishment as Long Chen went crazy.

As Long Chen repeatedly swung his fists, starry spots appeared on top of them as well. His power continued to increase. But his mind grew more and more chaotic.

Suddenly, Long Chen’s fist pierced through the wall of space, and a giant black hole appeared. Long Chen was devoured by that black hole without even being aware of it. Jiang Lei then cried out and started rushing over to save him.

Fortunately, a golden vine appeared and dragged Long Chen out of the black hole.Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

When Long Chen was dragged out, he was already unconscious. His mind descended into endless darkness.
