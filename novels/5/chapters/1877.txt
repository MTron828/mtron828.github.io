Chapter 1867 Phantom Blood Locusts

Translator: BornToBe

As Liu Ruyan summoned her true body and began to absorb the pool, the water level slowly fell. Her whole body was shining, and a dragon scale pattern began to appear on her bark.

The air of primal chaos covered her completely, and a holy light began to shine from her, as if she had awakened as an immortal spirit, as if she no longer belonged to the mortal world.

As the primal chaos energy entered her body, Long Chen saw black white surges of energy intertwining in her branches.

Chu Yao watched excitedly. This was a huge opportunity for Liu Ruyan. She would be completely transformed afterward.

However, after around a quarter of the divine pool was absorbed, the water level stopped descending.

Liu Ruyan was covered in immortal mist, and faint black and white marks had appeared on her leaves. She had reached her limit and could not absorb any more.

“Prepare yourself. I will help you.” The elder pressed his palms against each other. The leaves of the giant Yin Yang Immortal Grass wrapped around Liu Ruyan. In front of the Yin Yang Immortal Grass, even Liu Ruyan’s true body seemed tiny.

The black and white leaves had divine runes flow out of them, condensing into whirlpools that poured the divine elixir into Liu Ruyan’s body. The water level rapidly sank. In just a few seconds, it reached the bottom.

Only now did Chu Yao see that there were two spring openings at the bottom. White liquid like milk bubbled out of one, while black liquid like squid ink came from the other.

The speed at which these two liquids came out was extremely slow. Based on that speed, it would take tens of thousands of years to fill this pool up.

The Yin Yang Immortal Grass’s leaves released Liu Ruyan. She returned to her human form, but a black and white mark had appeared on her forehead.

That was the seal that the Yin Yang Immortal Grass had left in her. The remaining divine elixir was locked inside that seal so that she could slowly absorb it.

Suddenly, Liu Ruyan sent a palm at Long Chen, and caught by surprise, he was sent flying into the distance.

Liu Ruyan’s palm had contained some kind of strange energy, and Long Chen felt his blood flipping inside him.

He was about to burst into curses when Liu Ruyan knelt on the ground toward the Yin Yang Immortal Grass, her palms pressed against each other.

“Many thanks, senior.” Liu Ruyan was filled with gratitude for this elder. He had not just sealed the divine elixir inside her, but he had also transmitted his understanding of life and death, Yin and Yang, growth and decay, all his life’s understanding to her.

Although she was not at the level where she could understand it at all yet, she could slowly comprehend it in the future, and she would sooner or later reach that height. This was something that would benefit her for a lifetime and could already be called the inheritance of a master to a disciple.

Seeing this, Long Chen couldn’t say anything. Liu Ruyan had knocked him away to prevent him from taking advantage like he just had.

“Child, rise. I’m ashamed. This is simply my agreement with this little friend. If you want to thank someone, you should thank him,” said the elder, raising Liu Ruyan up.

Liu Ruyan stood. She nodded slightly to Long Chen without looking at him, and that was it.

Long Chen was still waiting for Liu Ruyan to apologize, but she didn’t even look at him.

Rolling his eyes inside, he decided not to quibble with her over this. To the elder, he said, “Senior...”

“We can speak spiritually.” The elder directly switched to spiritual communication.

Long Chen was startled. However, using the same kind of spiritual communication, he said, “I want to know what the gamebreaker means. I’ve heard it several times now.”

He had heard this from the ascender in the Four Nations Ancient Remnant, and Sovereign Yun Shang had also brought it up. It seemed others had also mentioned it, but even now, he didn't know what it meant.

“The world is like a chessboard. Everyone is a piece that has their own fate. The lines of life and death have already been set. However, some people are not within the plan but are still on the board. Such people are called gamebreakers.”

“Then this so-called game, who set it up?” asked Long Chen.

“Some games are made by people, some are made by the heavens. However, no matter who set it up, the gamebreakers always bring disorder. They are not accepted by heaven or earth, and so they face endless calamities. They are fated to have lives of trouble and misfortune. For you to have grown to your current height, I’m sure you’re already aware of this. Gamebreakers break the chessboard and change the fate of the world. The more the gamebreakers grow, the more they will change the world, and the more they will influence the final outcome of the board. So your path will only become more dangerous. There are only two possibilities: you will either topple this world, or the world will destroy you,” said the elder. “Other than that, I see something legendary on your body, so there are many things I cannot say, I dare not say. What I can say is that the board is about to reach its final stage. If you don’t topple the board, you will be destroyed by the board.”

Long Chen’s heart shook. He suddenly recalled that voice that occasionally appeared in his head that constantly said that the time was almost up. Was it referring to this board?

“Young friend, thank you. Thank you for giving me a chance to return home. I will forever remember you. Hopefully, you can topple this chessboard and survive. I hope we can meet again.”

The elder slowly rose. His body lit up, and he merged into the Yin Yang Immortal Grass.

“I’m going to break the chains. When the chains are broken, the formation will crumble. There is a horde of locusts on a mountain not far from here. They will be woken when the formation crumbles, and those locusts are more difficult to handle than the Magical Beasts. You should be careful.” The Yin Yang Immortal Grass’s voice rang out in their ears. This was its final goodbye.

The Yin Yang Immortal Grass’s whole body began quivering crazily. The chains beneath it were pulled taut, and the earth began shuddering as well.

There was one runic chain amongst those countless chains that was already dim. Cracks began growing all along it. That was the chain that Long Chen had struck.

That chain suddenly shattered due to the Yin Yang Immortal Grass’s power. Then a chain reaction followed. All the chains shuddered, and one by one, they shattered.

“Goodbye. Let me thank you once more.”

The Yin Yang Immortal Grass explosively grew. It broke through the sky.

The formation of the light pillar was shattered, and the entire world trembled fiercely. Mountains crumbled, the earth sank. It was like the world was about to be destroyed.

Those experts on the outside had started panicking when they saw Chu Yao be summoned inside by the Yin Yang Immortal Grass. However, now as the formation broke, they simply stood there in dumb shock. The power of the Yin Yang Immortal Grass made them feel like a mountain was crushing them. Even moving a finger was difficult.

At this moment, whoever still had any intention of snatching the Yin Yang Immortal Grass would really be an idiot. Something on that level wasn’t anything that they could touch. Only now did they find just how foolish their previous thinking was.

The formation exploded, and even the stars in the sky were shaking. After that, a giant hole appeared in the void, and the Yin Yang Immortal Grass slowly entered it.

In the end, it vanished within the hole. The Yin Yang Immortal Grass was gone, and the terrifying pressure had faded. The world was peaceful. However, after that intense shaking, the earth was sundered and the mountains had collapsed.

“Long Chen’s still present! Kill him! He has definitely obtained some treasure!” One sharp-eyed fellow noticed that Long Chen, Chu Yao, and Liu Ruyan were still present.

Although they didn’t know what had just happened, they knew that Long Chen had definitely gained something good. All their eyes turned red with greed.

“Fuck, it’s been a long time since I had a slaughter. Come, my blade has long since grown thirsty.” Long Chen rose into the air, Evilmoon on his shoulder. Did they really think he was so easy to bully?

Seeing Long Chen still standing there, that expert from Pill Valley smiled coldly. Holding his blood-red flame spear, he took the lead in charging at Long Chen.

BOOM!

Just as a great battle was about to erupt, the ground exploded, revealing a giant hole. A group of fist-sized locusts flew out.

Their bodies were golden, but compared to ordinary locusts, they had a pair of pincers on their mouths that flickered with a cold light. While the rest of them looked like they were made of gold, only their pincers were blood-colored.

“Heavens, Phantom Blood Locusts!” shouted someone in a panic.

Phantom Blood Locusts might normally be golden, but when they attacked, blood-colored runes would appear on their wings, making them appear scarlet. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Their golden color was what they looked like normally, but once they changed color, it meant that they were infuriated.

The Phantom Blood Locusts soared out, filling the sky like a giant wave. They charged at the experts present.

“Fuck, I actually forgot.” Long Chen clapped his leg. He had actually forgotten the Yin Yang Immortal Grass’s warning about the locusts. Seeing these Phantom Blood Locusts, his face turned green. These things were even more terrifying than the twelfth rank Magical Beasts.

“Ah!”

The Phantom Blood Locusts were incredibly quick. A powerful Empyrean was surrounded in an instant, and while he crazily fought, there were too many Phantom Blood Locusts. One of them bit his leg, and with a scream, his entire body stiffened. Then the Phantom Blood Locusts enveloped him, and when they left, he was gone. Not even a bone was left.

“Run!”

Long Chen pulled Chu Yao and Liu Ruyan away, running as fast as he could.
