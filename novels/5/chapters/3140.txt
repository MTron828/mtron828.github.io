Chapter 3129 Xiaole Admits Fear

Liao Yuhuang. That was the name of the woman from the Zither Sect. The name was a bit strange and not one for a woman. But it was precisely due to this that it was easier to remember.

Of course, Xiaole had also memorized it. He had memorized the names of all those he considered monsters. Every time the lots were drawn, he would cover up his tablet and look at the characters one by one. As soon as he saw that their surname was different, he would relax. It was like he was gambling with his tablet.

However, today, his luck wasn’t good. As expected, whatever you feared would happen. His opponent was Liao Yuhuang.

“Xiaole, it’s your turn,” said Lu Mingxuan.

“How can this be? I’m the seventh match!” exclaimed Bai Xiaole, in a panic as he tried to think of how to win.

“People in the first six matches all admitted defeat,” said Lu Mingxuan helplessly.

Just at this moment, Bai Xiaole’s tablet began to flash. It really was his turn.

In order to win the match to get into the top 64, many people had ended up putting everything on the line. Because of it, they were still injured. Whether they were 64th or 4th, it made no difference to them as the rewards were the same. Hence, they forfeited because they had no intention of getting into the top three.

The first seven matches at the start, including Long Chen’s, all had people directly admit defeat, allowing their opponents to easily pass. Everyone was now much clearer about the power of their competitors. Hence, if their power was equal, there was no need to go all-out against them. If their opponent was too strong, then there was no point in even going on stage.

Right now, Bai Xiaole was transported to the stage. When he saw the zither woman, he almost wept. But he thickened his face to greet her. “Hello, beautiful zither big sister. Junior brother Bai Xiaole has come to learn a bit from senior sister due to boss’s orders. If senior sister could give me some pointers, junior brother would be endlessly grateful. I hope senior sister will give face to my boss and have some mercy, and not make junior brother’s loss too ugly. Boss said that he would personally treat big sister to a meal after the convention is over.”

“What nonsense. When did I ever say such a thing?” Long Chen was speechless. When did this little fellow get such a smooth mouth?

“Ah, it really is a case of people stained black by the environment. Even this innocent child Xiaole has learned to spout insincere gilt words,” said Bai Shishi indifferently, clearly implying that Bai Xiaole had learned the wrong things from Long Chen.

“Your boss is Long Chen, correct?” Liao Yuhuang smiled at Bai Xiaole.

“Yes, yes, it’s him! I know that I can’t beat you and wanted to admit defeat, but boss said that a beautiful and kind woman like you won’t kill me. Most importantly, he said that exchanging blows with you will benefit me endlessly, so I hope for some pointers,” said Bai Xiaole, exceedingly courteously.

Hearing that, Long Chen suddenly came to an understanding. Even before Bai Xiaole’s Three Flower Eyes were activated, he had possessed the power to see through a person’s power. It was precisely due to this that he had taken Long Chen as his boss.

This was Bai Xiaole’s innate talent. He had definitely sensed something, which was why he was being so courteous to Liao Yuhuang and acting inferior. This way, Liao Yuhuang would definitely have mercy, and there would be no danger even if he was defeated. It seemed that he really did have some smarts.

“Junior brother is too courteous. Your Three Flower Pupils are manifested from an immemorial divine art. It is filled with endless profundities. Who would dare to be so arrogant as to say that they could give you pointers? However, your Three Flower Pupils have just awakened, and your usage is still rough. There are too many flaws. Against an ordinary expert, it’s fine. But against supreme experts, when your pupil arts change, you leave yourself open to having your life taken. Alright, since brother Long is willing to say such a thing, I will embarrass myself.”

Just then, the barrier separating them vanished. Bai Xiaole had long since prepared his manifestation. Hence, at this moment, an illusory image appeared behind him. It was a pair of giant eyes.

This manifestation was not a Primal’s manifestation because Bai Xiaole had not awakened a primal bloodline.

When those giant eyes appeared, it was as if the heavens had set their gaze on Liao Yuhuang. Space around her layered, as if the world was thrown into chaos and heaven and earth had been displaced.

Liao Yuhuang’s body quivered slightly. After that, she rested her hand on her zither strings. With a single note, an invisible sound wave shot out, restoring the chaotic world. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

“What?!”

All the experts that had previously fought against Bai Xiaole were shocked. They had all been defeated by this move. It had to be known that when Bai Xiaole activated his pupil art, heaven and earth were thrown into chaos. Left and right, front and back, up and down, there was no way for them to tell the direction. They might try to charge at Bai Xiaole, only to find themselves getting further and further away. It was a feeling that had driven them mad.

However, Liao Yuhuang instantly broke this technique. How could they not be shocked?

Bai Xiaole seemed to have expected this. Hence, his hand seals changed, and three flower petals appeared in his giant eyes. The three flower petals then began to revolve.

The martial stage instantly changed. It quivered and swayed. Suddenly, the floor of the martial stage became the roof, and the feeling of spatial displacement made people nauseous.

Those who had fought Bai Xiaole began to vomit. It was as if they had returned to that terrifying nightmare. The world was spinning around them.

Now that the martial stage was fully activated and battles were fought one by one, the martial stage drew people in, making them feel as if they were inside as well. This was very beneficial to their comprehension. It was even said that in the final clash, people would be able to freely choose between the viewpoints of the final fighters, as if they were the ones fighting.

However, due to being drawn in, quite a few people felt so terrible that they had no choice but to close their eyes and stop watching.

Space layered and inverted. Now, bolts of lightning streaked through the air, and giant wind blades whirled through space. As for Bai Xiaole himself, he had vanished, leaving only those giant eyes. They were like the eyes of a god.

BOOM!

A bolt of lightning struck the ground, blasting it apart. This made everyone jump in shock.

“This isn’t an illusion?”

Just as they thought that this spatial chaos was nothing more than a kind of illusion, a physical attack appeared.

After that, Zither music began to ring out and ripples spread. This inverted chaotic world then began to settle. Wherever the music passed, a calm world followed.

“Big sister, be careful. I’m going to use one of my ultimate moves.”

Bai Xiaole’s voice rang out. Suddenly, space twisted and sharp swords rained down on Liao Yuhuang from every direction.

“How is that possible?!” Upon seeing those swords, countless people were filled with disbelief.
