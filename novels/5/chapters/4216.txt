Chapter 4205 Trap?

“How can this be?! We’re in the Sage King trial by fire! The martial stage hasn't been activated yet! How can someone die here?!”

“In the past, if you were eliminated, didn’t you get transported out?! How could someone die like this?!”

Terrified cries of disbelief rang out.

“I’m not participating in this Sage King Convention!”

BOOM!

One person turned back and ran down the stairs, only to run into an invisible wall. He then exploded along with his weapon, transforming into blood mist.

In that instant, countless experts on the stairs and those watching were appalled. Why was this Sage King Convention different from all past Sage King Conventions?

Moreover, it wasn’t just the human race’s side that encountered this problem. The other paths had similar issues. Casualties were appearing amongst the weak.

After these people died, their blood was absorbed by some mysterious power. As a result, the blood-colored marks on the blue screen grew deeper, as if the blood was absorbed by them.

“What’s going on? When did the Sage King Convention’s laws grow so cruel? The weak who are washed out can only die?!” Someone roared in shock and anger.

However, no one replied as everyone was staring in shock at the martial stage. At this moment, the countenance of Bai Shishi’s and Bai Xiaole’s mother darkened.

“The dean did say that this generation’s Sage King Convention occurred very oddly. Could it be that he already noticed something and didn’t say it?” wondered Bai Shishi’s mother.

The dean had come with them but then quickly left. He only told everyone to be careful when watching this generation’s Sage King Convention, nothing more.

This scene made Bai Shishi’s mother fraught with worry. But the martial stage was already covered, and they could not save Long Chen and the others anymore.

The other factions were equally helpless. If those who were washed out were slain by the laws here, just how many people would survive this martial stage? How many would die?

These people could not sit still. Some of them even tried getting close to that enormous blue barrier.

BOOM!

An innate Heaven Venerate unleashed a ray of divine light at the barrier. The moment the ray of light struck the blue barrier, it shattered like an egg thrown at a city wall. Meanwhile, the barrier didn’t even budge. A full-power attack from an innate Heaven Venerate appeared insignificant in front of it.

Upon witnessing this, countless people’s hearts sank. Although some did consider themselves stronger than this innate Heaven Venerate, in the end, their power was also limited. If his full-power attack resulted in nothing, then they wouldn’t be able to shake this formation either. In other words, other than watching, there was nothing else they could do.

The senior generation outside was panicking, but the disciples inside were even more terrified.

“How is this a martial stage?! This is clearly a trap to kill us all!”

“A trap?”

When Long Chen heard this person’s random shout, his heart jolted with astonishment. He then looked toward the barrier surrounding the martial stage, narrowing his eyes in suspicion.

“Boss, what do we do?” asked Guo Ran.

“Don’t go too fast, and don’t spread out. If the weak and strong join forces, the pressure here won’t increase. We can resist it together,” said Long Chen.

With this, the Dragonblood warriors, Battle God Palace’s disciples, and even the experts of the Starry River Sect immediately got to work. The stronger members came to the weaker members’ side. Just as Long Chen said, with their support, the pressure on the weak instantly lessened.

Seeing this, countless other disciples were envious, their eyes almost pleading. But they didn’t dare to open their mouths.

“If you don’t want to take the risk, you can come with us!” announced Long Chen after spotting those looks.

These people were not that formidable, and the truly strong ones usually refused to let them exploit any advantage. Hence, after hearing Long Chen’s words, those people were instantly filled with gratitude.

As a result, tens of millions of disciples flowed toward Long Chen’s side, mixing with Long Chen’s group. The pressure on them was mostly relieved.

In order to stabilize things, Long Chen didn’t immediately advance. He waited for some disciples at the rear, knowing that once they left, those weaker disciples would all die. He couldn’t just stand by and watch that unfold.

This action resulted in mixed reactions from the spectators. Some praised him, and some sneered at him. Some viewed him as a hero, a nobleman assisting the weak, while some viewed him as too soft-hearted to achieve anything big, wasting the power of the strong. If the strong members were not powerful enough to reach the end due to being dragged down by all the weaklings, they would all die. In their opinion, his action was the height of stupidity.

Within the human race alone, multiple appraisals of Long Chen’s actions emerged. Those with different opinions even descended into heated disputes, with some nearly coming to blows as they exchanged curses and sneers.

However, the people inside the formation could not see what was happening outside. They couldn’t even hear them.

Actually, Long Chen wasn’t someone who liked to meddle in other people’s affairs, but as a member of the human race, he couldn’t just watch as they died. As for what others thought about him, he really didn’t care. He only did what he wanted to do. Other people’s opinions were dogshit to him.

Long Chen continued to lead the way. The further up they went, the greater the pressure grew. But it was still within the realm that everyone could endure.

Their ascent grew progressively slower, and they found themselves in the last group of the human race. As more people kept joining their ranks, their group continued to expand.

As they reached the latter part of the middle section, their numbers swelled to over eighty million disciples. Among them, many were silkpants—people blessed with both talent and background but refused to work hard on cultivation. This lax approach resulted in their foundations being unstable, and although their auras might be powerful, it was essentially a facade. They were essentially living in their own dreams, thinking that they were top experts. But in front of these laws, they were beaten back into reality.

Other than having a status that could dazzle others, they had no other strong points. If it weren’t for Long Chen taking them in, they would eventually be erased by the laws here.

At this point, the martial stage was already in view. Countless people had reached it, but the martial stage was still silent. Nothing was happening.

Amongst those who had reached the top, some cheered for Long Chen and his group. They recognized Long Chen's efforts in elevating the status of the human race, and a few of the ones following him even belonged to the same faction as them.

However, there were also those with repulsive mouths who insulted these people as trash, telling them to just die on the stairs and not embarrass themselves further.

Even so, the absolute majority were just watching silently. Although they had managed to climb to the top, the martial stage had not reacted. They weren’t transported away to start the one-against-one fights.

The human race was occupying one corner of the martial stage. But as there were multiple staircases, other races began to appear as well. They seemed lost and were looking around.

Some brash people wanted to directly charge to the center of the martial stage. But there was still a barrier there, and the ones who charged up to it exploded.

Now, no one knew what to do, so they could only wait there. At this time, Long Chen had reached the martial stage as well.

“Long Chen, now that we’re on the martial stage, we’ll see who can protect you. Just wait for your death today!”nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

Long Chen had just climbed up when someone from the Xu family sneered at him.

As a result, he had barely finished speaking when his neck was severed, his violet blood raining down from the spot where his head used to be.
