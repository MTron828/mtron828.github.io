Chapter 3821 Fusang Tree

“What happened?! Why are you shouting?!”

Guo Ran’s shout made everyone jump, but they didn’t notice anything. Hence, Xia Chen angrily demanded to know what was going on.

“The exit is gone!”

Guo Ran pointed behind him. When he tried to get closer to the exit, there was an invisible wall that blocked him.

Guo Ran had been walking with everyone when he suddenly sensed something off behind him. He then turned back to look, only to smack his head into the invisible wall, causing him to scream. At the time, he thought some invisible lifeform had appeared behind him.

“Of course. It’s the death gate. Death qi can only leave, not enter; life qi can only enter, not leave. With every step we take, the wall of death qi will push us further in, preventing us from retreating. I forgot to mention that,” said Mo Nian.

“Then what about when we want to leave?” asked Guo Ran.

“We’ll see. Perhaps we might be able to cross the Heavenly Boundary Line in the tomb. We can leave through the life gate then,” said Mo Nian.

They carefully continued onward and Xia Chen implored Guo Ran to not randomly shout again. In such a tense time, he really might scare them to death.

They followed the path while starting to hold their breath and close their pores. The death qi here was incredibly strong. If they absorbed too much of it, it might damage their bodies.

Creak.

Suddenly, they heard a strange sound that made them jump. Mo Nian said, “Don’t be afraid. The entrance to the tomb is up ahead.”

They continued, and just as Mo Nian said, a double-door gate appeared. It was thirty meters tall and dark red, covered in countless runes.

“Those runes…!”

When Xia Chen saw those runes, he was absolutely shocked. These were the type of runes that he had never seen before.

After studying them for a long time, Xia Chen deduced what they were. “These are all curse runes! This gate… can we really cross it?”Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

If they went through this gate, they would definitely be cursed. That was no laughing matter. Being cursed might be even worse than dying.

“It’s fine. Our clothes have the Limitless Palace’s divine runes on them that can block this kind of curse,” said Mo Nian. He often encountered such a thing and was completely prepared.

Once they got closer to the gate, they saw that it was made out of wood, and Long Chen couldn’t help but feel shocked.

“What kind of wood is this? How does it not rot even after so many years?”

Mo Nian took out a dagger and tried to cut the wood. As a result, this new World Domain divine item that he had just obtained shattered. On the other hand, the gate wasn’t damaged at all.

“What the?! This wood is even harder than World Domain divine items!” exclaimed Mo Nian. Although he had encountered all kinds of gates in his grave robbing journey, it was his first time seeing such a terrifying wooden gate.

Although that dagger was somewhat damaged when he found it, it was still incredibly sharp. But there wasn’t even a hair’s worth of damage on the wood.

“Don’t look at me. I’m not sure either,” said Yue Xiaoqian when she saw them looking at her. “This wood’s veins are very similar to the Sun Divine Runes, so it’s a bit similar to the legendary Fusang Tree. However, the legendary Fusang Tree is yellow or golden, but this wood is black. Thus, I can’t make a guess.”

“The Fusang Tree? The birthplace of the Golden Crow race, the original source of the Sun Flame?” asked Long Chen.

“The marks look similar but definitely aren’t the same. The black wood also looks natural, so I really wouldn’t be able to say if it’s the Fusang Tree or not,” said Yue Xiaoqian.

Clearly, even someone as knowledgeable as Yue Xiaoqian didn’t dare to randomly guess about such a thing.

Long Chen and Mo Nian exchanged a glance. At the same time, they said, “What do you think? Are we doing it or not?”

The two of them were thinking the same thing. They looked at the gate and began to study it.

Just then, the gate slowly opened. Long Chen was one step too slow in retreating and was struck by it.

BOOM!

As a result, Long Chen smashed into the wall. A qi wave exploded that made Guo Ran and the others sway.

No one had expected the slowly opening gate to possess such terrifying power. Long Chen almost coughed up blood.

“Good thing it was you. If I was the one struck, I’d lose half my life. Everyone, get behind the doors,” said Mo Nian.

No one understood what was going on, but they acted according to his instructions and pressed up against the two sides of the gate.

Just then, a powerful airflow slowly blew through the doors. Its speed wasn’t particularly fast, but when it flew by, Xia Chen felt like he couldn’t breathe. It was like a mountain was crushing him, and his physical body was almost crushed. In just a moment, blood spurted out of his eyes, nose, and ears.

Long Chen hastily dragged Xia Chen behind him, helping him block some of the pressure. Only then did Xia Chen feel a bit better.

After the invisible airflow passed, the doors slowly closed once more. But Long Chen and the others weren’t in a rush to dive through.

“What was that? How was it so terrifying?” asked Xia Chen. That airflow was absolutely bizarre. Without Long Chen, he’d have been crushed. This place was filled with dangers, and death might come at any moment.

“It's the breathing of the tomb. You can treat it as a person farting. If you imagine the tomb as a living entity, then it has energy circulating within it. However, unexpectedly, the breathing of this heavenly tomb is so powerful. Normally, it’s not even an issue, so I forgot to mention it,” said Mo Nian apologetically.

Although this airflow wasn’t able to threaten Mo Nian, with Xia Chen’s weak physical body, without any defenses, it was quite dangerous for him.

“Let’s pause for a moment. This gate, how about us brothers split it fifty-fifty, one door each?” Long Chen looked at the doors. He had a feeling that even these doors were extraordinary treasures.

In truth, what Long Chen was eyeing wasn’t how powerful the gate was or its runes. He was eyeing the material. He had a brazen idea of tossing the wood into the primal chaos space. Would that cause it to come to life and grow? If that succeeded, he would really have profited this time.

Although the Wood Foundation Divine Trees were still able to provide him with enough life energy, now that he had become an Immortal King, their healing effect had clearly started dropping.

The primal chaos space’s life energy was the greatest guarantee of Long Chen’s survival. He had no choice but to constantly think of finding stronger vegetation. If this wood was able to sprout within his primal chaos space in place of the Wood Foundation Divine Trees, that would really be amazing.

“Really?” asked Mo Nian in shock.

“Do you think that I would joke?”

“I’ve never taken a death gate before, so I don’t know what will happen,” said Mo Nian. Originally, he had thought that Long Chen would only want a piece of the gate. Unexpectedly, he wanted the whole thing.

“However big your guts are is how much you can profit. Come. I’ll chop down the axle, and you hold it up. Everyone else, back up a bit. The doors are probably very heavy!” Long Chen took out the black dagger. He then went to the side of the gate and slashed the dagger at the axle, which was instantly severed.

When it broke, one of the doors crashed down with a terrifying rumbling sound. Just the force of it falling caused space to tear.

“What the-?!”

BOOM!

Mo Nian tried to hold up the door, only for it to smash him flat. It was like it contained the weight of an entire world. Mo Nian didn’t even have time to struggle before he was smashed into the ground by the door.

Mo Nian’s figure vanished. All they saw was a door lying on the ground.

“Quick, save him!”

Long Chen jumped in shock and leaped into action after a moment of shock.
