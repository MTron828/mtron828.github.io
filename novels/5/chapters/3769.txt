Chapter 3758 Golden Unicorn

The two pretty girls had their hair in two pigtails. They wielded wooden bows, and their eyes eyed Long Chen up and down.

Despite looking very young, their arrows were pointed right at Long Chen. That actually gave Long Chen a slight sense of pressure. These two were actually not weaker than ordinary Divine Lords.

They glared at Long Chen with hostility. Long Chen didn’t know whether to laugh or cry.

“I really don’t have any malice. Furthermore, I am friends with the Spirit race. What do you mean when you said that I’m with the bad people? Have humans invaded the Spirit race?”

“I’m not telling you. Your human race is the worst! You’re all liars! We won’t fall for it. Leave now, or we won’t be courteous.” That girl glared at him frostily. Despite looking very cute, her tone was quite fearful. It was like she was going to start biting.

As they spoke, Long Chen and Jiang Lei saw countless large trees come to life in the depths of the forest. Arrows peeled off of their bodies and floated in the air, pointed at them.

“Hey, we can talk this out! I have the Spirit race’s mark on me! Can you not see it?” Long Chen hastily raised his hands.

“The Spirit race’s mark? Show me.” One of them softened slightly and was about to walk forward when the other one dragged her back.

“Don’t fall for it. The human race is very crafty. He’s trying to trick us into going over.”

“But our cultivation base isn’t high enough to see it from this distance. How can we verify it?” asked the other.

“Hey, we don’t care if you have the Spirit race’s mark. We aren’t accepting visitors at the moment. I’ll trouble you to come back another time,” shouted the other girl.

“Another time? What time?” asked Long Chen.

“I suppose you can come back in a month!” 

A month? How could he do that? By that time, everything would be too late. But when it came to the Spirit race’s people, Long Chen didn’t feel right using force. However, he was also unable to explain himself. Even with all his power, he felt powerless here.

Suddenly, intense fluctuations came from deep within the forest. A bugle horn rang out urgently, and those two girls immediately changed expressions.

“Hurry up and leave, or we won’t be courteous!” shouted one of them.

“Is the Spirit race in trouble? If so, I can help!” said Long Chen.

“Leave! That would be the most helpful thing you could do!” raged the other girl. She was clearly panicking and wanting to go reinforce the other.s

Seeing that there was no way to explain himself to these two, Long Chen took a deep breath. 

“Sorry. I’ll have to offend you.”

The two girls instantly had a bad feeling and retreated. Their arrows shot toward Long Chen. At the same time, a torrent of arrows poured out of the forest like a flood at Long Chen.

Long Chen’s astral energy then surged out of him, and he crashed through the current of arrows. Those arrows exploded in front of him, not even slowing him down.

After that, Long Chen reached toward the two of them, who screamed in fright and fled. But they were shocked to find that the surrounding space had suddenly frozen. Long Chen grabbed them.

“You really are a baddie! Your human race is filled with bad people!” The two girls struggled with all their power. They bit him, but his physical body was so powerful that they weren’t even able to harm him.

“You’ll know in a bit.”

Long Chen ignored their struggle and rushed through the forest with lightning wings on his back. Countless tree demons appeared, but it seemed that they were afraid of hurting the two girls and didn’t dare to go too far.

“You baddie, you’ll be punished by the heavens! You… eh? You… you have the mark of the Butterfly Spirit race on you, and… the aura of the rainbow crane race.” Just as they were struggling with all their might, one of them came to a sudden stop. Disbelief filled her large eyes.

The other one also stopped, looking stunned. She finally sensed his aura.𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

“So you’re not a baddie?” asked one of them.

“Of course not. I told you, I’m a friend of the Spirit race, but you refused to believe me,” said Long Chen.

“Then big brother, does that mean you’re going to help us beat the baddies?” asked the other.

“Am I not rushing to the battlefield right now?!”

“Oh!”

The two of them cried out excitedly when they heard his response.

“Hold onto me tightly. Have your people get out of the way. I’m going to accelerate!” shouted Long Chen.

“Alright!”

The two girls were incredibly excited. Suddenly, they transformed into golden vines that wrapped around Long Chen’s head. Long Chen was surprised. The two of them were actually vines.

After transforming into vines, they held onto Long Chen’s head and stuck out two ends that began to flash. Countless tree demons received their communications and made way for Long Chen. A path then appeared in the forest.

Suddenly, a strange sound came from beside him. Long Chen was startled and then saw Jiang Lei not daring to look at him. He instantly realized that the current him must look bizarre with golden vines wrapped around his head. That was already out of place, but they even stuck out two tentacles like the eyes of a snail.

“One of you, go to him. When the battle starts, tell him how to fight,” said Long Chen.

“Boss, I have plenty of combat experience…!” Jiang Lei cried out indignantly. However, Long Chen didn’t even give him a chance to argue. He plucked one of the vines off of his head, and Jiang Lei could only receive it bitterly. He cursed himself for laughing at his boss. Now, his retribution had come.

As a result, two ‘golden unicorns’ flew through the path of the forest. They quickly saw a chaotic battlefield ahead. Devil qi was erupting there, and an army of devil experts was slaughtering a group of lifeforms.

After those lifeforms were killed, their corpses were snatched up. Some of the devils would directly fight over the bodies and tear them apart. It was extremely bloody.

Hundreds of thousands of devil experts were assaulting the retreating lifeforms. Countless tree demons used their own bodies to block the devil experts, protecting the lifeforms as they escaped. However, those tree demons were directly blasted apart.

“Big brother, help us kill those baddies!” shouted one of the girls when she saw her people being slaughtered.

“Have your people all retreat.” Long Chen’s killing intent instantly soared when he saw the devil experts. He then reached for the Minghong Saber on his back.

“I’ll be the main attacker. Jiang Lei, cut them off at the rear. Don’t leave a single one alive!”

Long Chen pushed the girl off of him, and his divine ring appeared. Torrential killing intent unfurled.

The Minghong Saber then came out of its sheath, striking one of the Supreme experts of the devil race like a bolt of lightning.

“Split the Heavens 1!”
