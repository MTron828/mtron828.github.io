Chapter 4547 Chaotic Battle of Ten Thousand Races

Powerful gusts and furious roars came from ahead, accompanied by the sound of slaughter and a bloody scent in the air.

Long Chen knew that they had gotten close to the entrance of both worlds. According to Feng You, there were two worlds to enter: the Void Spirit World and the Fantasy Spirit World.

Outsiders would go into the Void Spirit World, while the native experts would enter the Fantasy Spirit World. However, the Fantasy Spirit World had two entrances as well, which were the Fantasy Spirit Entrance and the Esoteric Spirit Entrance.

Both entrances led to the same world, but due to different paths, they led to different regions.

The mixed beast race was going to enter the Esoteric Spirit Entrance. Since that was the case, Feng You was in the habit of calling it the Esoteric Spirit World, not the Fantasy Spirit World.

Whether it was the Void Spirit World or the Fantasy Spirit World‚Äôs entrance, they were all near each other. These entrances were also not fixed. Perhaps this entrance led to the Void Spirit World this time, but next time, it might not.

Thus, whether it was the natives or the outsiders, they would rush to the area in front of the three entrances to occupy the best spots.

The Void Spirit World, the Fantasy Spirit World, and even the branch known as the Esoteric Spirit World‚Äîall were rumored to hold the treasures of an entire era within their depths.

The legends had it that in ancient times, a cataclysmic battle among gods occurred, leading to the collapse of countless worlds. Through the power of reincarnation, these worlds merged together. As time passed, these buried worlds would occasionally open.

Whenever they did, the buried worlds weren‚Äôt the only places that became accessible. They also created a bridge, a channel to an unknown realm.

This unknown realm was rumored to be the core of the cosmos. However, its exact nature and appearance remained shrouded in mystery, known to none.

Yet, even without delving into that mysterious realm, just the Void Spirit World and Fantasy Spirit World held countless treasures within their domains.

After all, the Void Spirit World and the Fantasy Spirit World hailed from ancient times, their depths holding untold numbers of divine weapons and secret tomes. Within their confines, there could also lie the remains of ancient divine beasts, treasures of incalculable value.

For the experts of the beast race, the corpses of their ancestors might contain lost techniques just waiting to be resurrected.

Thus, countless experts viewed the Void Spirit World and the Fantasy Spirit World as treasure troves. Despite knowing that they might lose their lives inside, the allure of treasures was irresistible.

As soon as the gates to these worlds swung open, the first batch of entrants would be favored by the laws of the world and guided to the locations brimming with the most coveted treasures.

Through countless tests, some self-proclaimed wise experts had essentially verified this rumor. The first batch of entrants always reaped plentiful gains. There was never a documented instance of them returning empty-handed.

However, Long Chen scoffed at it. What dumbasses. Everyone in the first batch was a peak expert, so even if they couldn‚Äôt find treasures, they could always take from others. Killing people was quite profitable after all. Why would such powerful experts return empty-handed?

Long Chen didn‚Äôt believe in luck, as only power reigned supreme. Also, he had thought it through. After he got in, he would be a bandit. In any case, he had enemies everywhere, and killing people for their treasures was one of the skills he excelled in.

Unlike Long Chen, the other experts didn‚Äôt think like this. Both the natives and outsiders were doing their best to get to the entrances so they could be the first batch of entrants.

Long Chen and his companions advanced for another hour until they reached what could only be described as an immensely chaotic battlefield.

Long Chen saw all kinds of races here: the devil race, human race, Blood race, demonic beasts, devil beasts, the Shadow race, and numerous others. Among them were even races unrecognizable to him.

The battlefield was a scene of utter chaos, yet most combatants only fought to claim territories, so they only launched probing blows. When confronted with overwhelmingly superior opponents, the weaker factions would abandon their territories and look for another place. It was better than getting their asses kicked.

Amid so many factions squeezing their way forward, the mixed beast race‚Äôs arrival didn‚Äôt draw any attention. Now, with many experts around the entrances, fiercer probing blows occasionally resulted in deaths. Probing blows were, after all, demonstrations of power.

As a result, corpses littered the battlefield, soaking the ground with fresh blood. Puddles of blood had formed in the depressions, permeating the air with a pungent scent of iron. Yet, Long Chen found that the mixed beast race‚Äôs experts didn‚Äôt show the slightest hint of fear. Instead, their own fighting spirits surged, undeterred by the grisly scene before them.

Long Chen nodded in understanding. The mixed beast race had endured years of suppression, unrecognized by the rest of the world. Yet, they had never relented. Even if they had to pay a bloody price in their pursuit of acknowledgment, they remained undeterred.

Seeing their fervent determination, Long Chen felt like he was seeing the human race. However, there were differences. After the human race‚Äôs glorious era, they could never climb back up.

Looking at their blazing spirits, Long Chen couldn‚Äôt suppress a sigh. If the human race possessed such fiery determination, perhaps they could have restored their former glory.

Regretfully, once some humans knelt, their knees became rooted to the ground, and they could never stand again. With their intelligence, they chose not to think about getting stronger but instead how to scheme against their comrade, dragging down the progression of the entire human race‚Äîinstead of striving for strength, they resigned themselves to complacency.

Fortunately, the humans also harbored true experts and warriors within its ranks, such as the Sovereigns. These individuals provided a beacon of hope, demonstrating that the human race still possessed the potential for greatness.

‚ÄúFilthy mixed beast race, scram! This place isn‚Äôt for you!‚Äù

Once the mixed beast race got closer, a warning shout resounded from ahead, coming from a group of rogue experts.

As a result, an arrow from Long Chen immediately pierced through the head of the one shouting. Blending seamlessly within their ranks, he went unnoticed, so his sneak attack struck his target with deadly accuracy.

‚ÄúThis is nice!‚Äù

Long Chen had always fought openly against his enemies. Now that he was doing such sneak attacks, he felt that such a shameless feeling was even more exciting than killing his opponent with a slash of his saber.

‚ÄúCourting death! Kill them!‚Äù

The rogue experts immediately turned toward the mixed beast race. However, their leader only saw a golden spear before he arrived at the reincarnation river.

‚ÄúThe mixed beast race‚Äôs peerless Feng You is present! If you don‚Äôt want to die, then scram! Otherwise, please line up to die in an orderly fashion! Lord Feng You will send you on your way one by one. Thank you for your cooperation!‚Äù Long Chen shouted loudly by Feng You‚Äôs side. Originally, she had a heroic expression on her face to display her dignity, but Long Chen‚Äôs antics were just too funny, so she burst out laughing.

‚ÄúKill!‚Äù

After that, the mixed beast race‚Äôs experts roared as well and charged forward with their sharpest killing blows.Follow the latest novels ùíêùíè nùíê/velbin(.)com
