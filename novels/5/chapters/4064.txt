Chapter 4053 Going to the Tiger

The Violet Flame Heaven was engulfed in turmoil as word spread like wildfire about the discovery of a primal chaos divine item.

Countless ancient monsters that could be considered living fossils came out, and a relentless armada of battleships charged toward the Violet Flame Heaven, echoing with the thunderous roars of terrifying beasts. The world trembled in the face of this unprecedented upheaval.

Practically, every major force sent people over. After all, the primal chaos divine items had the secrets of the primal chaos era on them. Whoever could obtain them would obtain the karmic luck of a primal chaos divine item.

For example, Xia Guhong had obtained the Grand Xia Dragon Sparrow many years ago. Although the Grand Xia Dragon Sparrow vanished later on, just the trace of its karmic luck that resided within Xia Guhong was enough for him to terrify countless experts.

As for when Long Chen used the Earth Cauldron, there was no karmic luck support. In other words, the Earth Cauldron had yet to truly accept him as master, and anyone could still take it.

As a result, Long Chen became a thick piece of meat eyed by many hungry wolves.

Everyone knew that if they themselves weren’t strong enough, even if they obtained the Earth Cauldron, they wouldn’t be able to keep it. To make it worse, they might even bring calamity upon their sect.

However, they all believed in luck. If they could really become the master of the Earth Cauldron, they would be unmatched in this world.

In any case, throughout the entire Violet Flame Heaven, everyone was talking about Long Chen. They even dug out his background.

When they learned that he was the High Firmament Academy’s youngest branch dean, they were startled. After that, they were even further stunned by his list of impressive wins in combat.

However, the shock was just an initial reaction. In front of the allure of the Earth Cauldron, people were willing to even throw away their lives. Nothing could deter them from pursuing this captivating and dangerous quest.

RUMBLE!

A fiery warhorse the size of a mountain tore through the void, akin to a bolt of lightning shooting through the air.

Wherever it went, it left behind a path of fire that even space was burning. It was a terrifying sight.

“Damn, that warhorse’s aura is much stronger than a three-flower Earth Venerate. Was it on the level of a Heaven Venerate?”

A flying boat was hidden in the void. If Xia Chen had not reacted quickly and slowed them down, they might have been struck by that fiery warhorse. Guo Ran was stunned.

“Don’t worry, now is your time to make a name for yourself. You can chase after it and kill the person on the back of the horse, claiming it for yourself,” said Xia Chen.

“Are you being serious?” Guo Ran jumped in fright.

“Didn’t you say that you wanted to make a name for yourself?” asked Xia Chen innocently.

“Fuck, good brother, don’t undermine me like this!” exclaimed Guo Ran with embarrassment. He had to swallow back what he had said before.

The main thing was that Guo Ran had not thought that the cauldron would possess such a terrifying background. If he had known that it would draw out such terrifying existences, he wouldn’t have bragged so much.

“This might be a bit troublesome.”

Long Chen looked in the direction the warhorse went and turned a bit solemn.

“It really is a bit troublesome.” nodded Xia Chen.

“What is troublesome? Can you not leave everyone else standing there like fools?” asked Guo Ran, looking at Long Chen and Xia Chen.

“Look where they’re going? That’s the direction of one of the ferry crossings of the heavenly river. Although it’s not the ferry crossing that we’re going on, this means that the other crossing points must have similar existences guarding them. They are really fast. We won’t be able to leave before they lock down all the exits. If we go now, we’ll be going straight to them,” explained Xia Chen.

“I don’t think that’s all. If they can seal the exits, they probably won’t let us reach the heavenly river’s shore. However, considering how large the heavenly river is, they cannot lock down the entire thing. We can only take the risk of crossing the heavenly river through somewhere else,” said Long Chen.

“But the heavenly river is filled with dangers. It is home to devil beasts and demonic creatures, and straying from the main path might lead one into a giant horde of them. And there are terrifying fiend eyes that can devour us all in a single glance. I’ve also heard of the tales of floating corpses that appear on the heavenly river. Those unfortunate enough to encounter those corpses are beset by ill fortune,” said Yu Qingxuan.

Within the nine heavens, there was the heavenly river, the Nether Sea, and the fiend lake. In truth, they were all one thing. It was just that every place had a different name for it.

The heavenly river referred to the border between heavens. Also, the wall between the nine heavens was very thick and could be likened to several star-fields layered on top of each other.

However, some people also said that this space was just a fake concept. According to them, the distance between heavens was as thin as a piece of paper.

It was just that when people tried to cross this paper, they had to go through its entire length and not its width.

They said that in the immemorial era, peak experts could directly cross the heavenly river and enter a new heaven at will.

However, most people felt like this story was impossible. The laws of the heavenly river restricted a person’s power, so either the legends were fake or the immemorial era’s heavenly river had different laws from the present.

In any case, within verifiable records, there was no one capable of simply crossing the heavenly river at will.

Thus, anyone who wanted to cross heavens would obediently use the ferry crossings. There were also several comparatively safe shipping routes.

Crossing the heavenly river outside of those areas was no different from courting death. Even those so-called safe shipping routes could have dangers come upon them. Thousands of ferries would mysteriously vanish each year, leaving a trail of uncertainty in their wake. Yet, going outside of those areas was even more dangerous. The odds of someone reaching the other shore using those alternative paths were too low.

“I’m not worried. I always do things like this,” said Long Chen with a smile.

He had the Ghost Sovereign’s mark, so the fiend eyes would ignore him. As for the rest, he wasn’t afraid of them.

Yu Qingxuan smiled and didn’t say anything again, as she had the utmost confidence in Long Chen. If Long Chen said that he wasn’t worried, then there was nothing to fear.

Thus, Xia Chen had the flying boat slowly fly to the border of the heavenly river. On the way, they saw countless experts going back and forth. Even the weakest of those experts were three-flower Earth Venerates.

There were also some young experts. Although they were young, their auras were shocking, so their power was probably not inferior to Kun Tu.

Clearly, the senior generation had gone crazy, and even the new generation of heavenly geniuses was drawn into it. Their ambition extended far beyond merely obtaining the Earth Cauldron; they were driven to surpass Long Chen and etch their names in history for all to remember.

Everything went as Long Chen expected. Countless experts gathered around the heavenly river, seeming to have calculated that Long Chen would definitely leave the Violet Flame Heaven.Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

Three days later, Long Chen had fully recovered and still had an eyepatch on, but it wouldn’t affect him in combat.

At this time, Xia Chen’s flying boat slowly reached their crossing point. However, once they got close, Xia Chen’s expression changed. The ferry crossing that they wanted to use to cross the heavenly river was blocked.

“Boss, there is a barrier up ahead. We will definitely be noticed if we try to go through it. What do we do?” asked Xia Chen.

“Charge. If gods block us, we will kill gods. If devils block us, we will kill devils,” said Long Chen, battle intent burning in his eyes.

BOOM!

When the flying boat touched the barrier, the void quivered. The giant barrier was instantly pierced, and at the same time, countless spatial gates opened.

“Hahaha!”

When that arrogant laughter rang out, countless figures flew out of the spatial gates, surrounding Long Chen’s flying boat.
