Chapter 2096 More Than Enough Confidence

After consuming the Hundred Flower Dao Resonation Pill, a hundred flowers blossomed around Ye Zhiqiu, forming a resonance with all the surrounding Daos. Long Chen activated the alchemy room’s formation to increase Ye Zhiqiu’s efficiency.

The Hundred Flower Dao Resonation Pill was able to take Grand Dao energy and allow people to absorb it directly through the blossoming flowers. It was a pill any Empyrean who hadn’t awakened their manifestation yet would dream of obtaining.

Through this test, they found that the effect was truly powerful. Ye Zhiqiu hadn’t awakened her manifestation yet, but with the pill, she was growing closer and closer with every passing moment.

If it weren’t for the fact that they didn’t have enough time right now, she could have gone into seclusion until her manifestation fully awakened.

The strongest aspect of the Hundred Flower Dao Resonation Pill was that after being consumed, it would leave behind its mark. Hence, even without doing anything, the body would naturally absorb Grand Dao energy. Even while sleeping, your manifestation could progress.

Of course, if you were focused on stimulating that medicinal energy, the effect would be even stronger. After just two hours, Ye Zhiqiu sensed the barrier and came to a stop.

“Long Chen, I’ve reached the barrier. One more step and my manifestation will awaken,” said Ye Zhiqiu excitedly.

“Really?”

“Yes. As long as I wish it, I can awaken my manifestation. But my manifestation has a wide area effect, so I don’t dare awaken it here,” said Ye Zhiqiu. “My master said that based on my speed, I would need two to three more months before fully awakening. But this one pill was able to let me reach the barrier.”

Long Chen was just as excited as Ye Zhiqiu. He hadn’t known just how great the effect of the Hundred Flower Dao Resonation Pill would be. Even he found it difficult to believe.

If it was effective on Ye Zhiqiu, it should be effective on all the Dragonblood warriors. A legion of fully awakened Empyreans was no longer just a dream.

With Ye Zhiqiu’s help, Long Chen refined three more Hundred Flower Dao Resonation Pills. His success rate was one hundred percent, and they were all top grade tribulation pills.

This kind of alchemy technique would definitely drive the world insane if others knew of it. This was practically cheating.

“The sad thing is, these pills can’t see the light of day. Otherwise, the world would be thrown into chaos.” Long Chen couldn’t help sighing as he looked at the Hundred Flower Dao Resonation Pills in his hand. Without a certain level of power, he wouldn’t be able to expose this. Otherwise, his death would definitely be very cruel. This was a power that could affect the state of the entire continent.

After refining those three pills, Long Chen didn’t have enough time to refine another one before the gathering.

Long Chen and Ye Zhiqiu returned to the auction room. The middle-aged man was already waiting for them.

“Mister Long Chen, the higher-ups have already given their answer. Perhaps they wouldn’t accept this trade for others because even my Dongfang family doesn’t have that much of the Peak Dao Transformation Dragon Saliva, but since it’s you, they’ll definitely give you face. You have a good relationship with fairy Zuiyue and fairy Rushuang, so I trust you know the price of the Peak Dao Transformation Dragon Saliva. Normally, one underworld spirit bead can be exchanged for two drops of Peak Dao Transformation Dragon Saliva. This is a market price that hasn’t changed over countless years. You have two thousand nine hundred and fifty underworld spirit beads, minus the three hundred and five that you spent. To express my Dongfang family’s sincerity and gratitude, we are willing to give you six thousand drops. How is that?”

“Many thanks.” Long Chen smiled. The Dongfang family was being quite generous.

Furthermore, while he had heard that this was the market price, the truth was that the Peak Dao Transformation Dragon Saliva was extremely rare, so it was difficult to trade for.

After saying his thanks, Long Chen left. Ye Zhiqiu continued to hold his arm and curiously asked, “The Dongfang family is so rich, and they’re willing to spend a frightening amount of money. What is their goal in holding this gathering?”

Holding this grand gathering had cost them a great deal of money. Just their courtesy gifts at meeting everyone were already amazing. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

Then adding all the arrangements that had been made for them, everything was top class. This single gathering had cost them an astronomical sum.

“You’re not a businesswoman, so you don’t understand. Holding this gathering contains a special meaning. Going straight to the source, these giant sects and powers always only care about two things: power and fame. Through this gathering, the Dongfang family can show off their rallying power, raising their fame. After all, even the Sovereigns needed the entire world’s approval to become Sovereigns. Another reason is this high class auction they held. They wanted to show the amazing treasures they could trade. Right now, they’re losing money, but in the future, they’ll make a huge profit. I feel like they’re taking a shot at the Huayun Sect. The business of these high level treasures will be focused on the Dongfang family. After all, these geniuses come from ancient powers, and they are the only ones qualified to conduct business on this level. It seems that the pressure on Zheng Wenlong has grown. Like this, it won’t be long before the Huayun Sect’s business is wrenched away by the Dongfang family,” sighed Long Chen.

The Dongfang family’s goal was very obvious to him. They were spending money to show the Dongfang family’s power.

However, while Long Chen had approved of the Dongfang family’s methods at the start, once they had taken out that replica of a replica of a Sovereign seal to con people, he had started to feel disgusted.

If it weren’t for the fact that Long Chen had seen Sovereign Qing Xu and recognized his aura, he would have also been duped.

Businessmen needed sincerity and trust as a basis. Ninety-nine times of integrity could be ruined by one fraud.

For them to have done some fishy shenanigans in the auction made Long Chen look down on them. If you could afford to play, then play. If you couldn’t afford it, then don’t try.

As soon as Long Chen obtained the Peak Dao Transformation Dragon Saliva, Huo Long started to grow antsy. It was like a child that was looking at the candy in their hand. It was already drooling.

As for Lei Long, it also thirsted for the Peak Dao Transformation Dragon Saliva, but it knew how to control itself. It didn’t look as child-like as Huo Long.

“Here, half for each of you. Three thousand drops each.”

Long Chen split the Peak Dao Transformation Dragon Saliva between the two of them. They immediately devoured the Peak Dao Transformation Dragon Saliva.

Their bodies quickly began to shine. Lightning and flames raged as they underwent some kind of metamorphosis.

Long Chen could clearly feel their bodies slowly growing more solid. It was like they were gaining physical bodies.

“Peak Dao Transformation Dragon Saliva. Dragon transformation. Maybe they can really become dragons.”

Lei Long and Huo Long were elemental entities, not true dragons. But this Peak Dao Transformation Dragon Saliva possessed some kind of special energy that was progressing them on the path to becoming dragons.

Lei Long and Huo Long were both unbearably excited. They felt their control over their bodies had risen to a new level.

Although the two of them were effective in battle, they were unable to precisely control their bodies. Now their control grew to a new level thanks to the Peak Dao Transformation Dragon Saliva. It was like a person whose body was numb was gradually regaining their senses. Lei Long and Huo Long excitedly swam through the air in the primal chaos space.

Long Chen was also excited. The stronger they were, the more energy he would save when he used them.

Long Chen and Ye Zhiqiu held hands, walking over to the Heavenly Music Stone. They were rather early, so fewer than twenty people had arrived.

Of those people, only three people nodded toward Long Chen, which could count as a greeting. The rest of them were icy.

Long Chen nodded back to those three. As for the ones ignoring him, he didn’t mind. He wasn’t money. There was no need for people to like him.

“Long Chen, you came so early?” The two of them had just found a place to sit when Ye Lingshan walked in.

“How was the banquet yesterday? What did you eat? Your stomach looks like it got bigger,” joked Long Chen.

“You’re still in the mood to joke?” Ye Lingshan glared at Long Chen, sitting beside him irritably.

“What is it?”

Ye Lingshan sighed and sent a spiritual message to Long Chen and Ye Zhiqiu. “Last night at the banquet, Dongfang Yuyang tried to resolve your enmities, saying that you were his good friend, and the only thing was that you had a bad temper. He asked people not to make things hard on you. But Kun Pengzi immediately said that you were the Xuan Beasts’ mortal enemy and that he had to kill you. He wouldn’t give face to anyone, as this was a matter of principle. Shi Lingfeng was the same, saying he refused to get along with you. Zhao Wuji even said that the enmity between the two of you could not stop until one of you was dead. As for Huang Feiyan, there’s nothing to be said. She hates you to death. Xie Tianzi didn’t say anything, but considering where we stand, he doesn’t need to say anything. The banquet ended up becoming awkward because of you, and everyone simply left. Big sister Zuiyue and big sister Rushuang didn’t even get a chance to speak up for you before everyone left. Big sister Zuiyue said that there are simply too many people targeting you, and that you might be in trouble after this gathering.”

Long Chen was surprised that Dongfang Yuyang would actually speak for him. However, these people didn’t give him that face.

“Long Chen, what’s next?” asked Ye Lingshan.

“What do you mean?”

“There are so many people targeting you. What are you going to do after the convention? Don’t you think you should consider leaving now?”

“Leave? Why would I leave? Different situations call for different responses. What’s there to be afraid of here? Just because these people were buried in their coffins for a long time, why should I be scared of them? Ha, I don’t care about their idiocies,” sneered Long Chen. These people really thought themselves to be supreme heavenly geniuses? They thought too highly of themselves.

“Long Chen, the gathering’s going to be over soon. Are you prepared to face your death?”

Just at this moment, Zhao Wuji also walked in, sneering at Long Chen.
