Chapter 2696 Sovereign’s Divine Might

“Yun Shang, taste my blade!”

Black qi swirled around Evilmoon, and a two-headed dragon roared within Long Chen’s divine ring. At this moment, a sinister aura infected the heavens.

BOOM!

Long Chen’s furious blow suddenly came to a stop, as Sovereign Yun Shang clapped his hands before him, catching Long Chen’s blade in his hands.

Divine runes buzzed, contending against the black qi. The stars of the heavens quivered as berserk energies clashed.

“...” T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

The ones who had been crazily cheering Long Chen instantly fell silent, as if their voices had been severed by a blade. They stared in shock at Sovereign Yun Shang.

Sovereign Yun Shang had silently and effortlessly caught Long Chen’s world-shaking saber. It was as easy as raising a hand.

“Just how strong is a Sovereign?! Long Chen has already reached such a terrifying level, but he still can’t compare?!”

People felt like they had gone crazy. Although it was said that Sovereigns stood at the peak of the martial path, Long Chen’s current power was absolutely terrifying and had exceeded their imaginations. However, Sovereign Yun Shang had caught this attack barehanded. Was the difference between the two really so great?

“Unleash your full power. Don’t hold back any longer, or you will die to our hands. The Heavenly Daos want you dead, and we are replicated by the Heavenly Daos. If you can’t last, you will die. We can’t help you pass this tribulation. We’re already dead,” said Sovereign Yun Shang.

“Many thanks for your advice. Also, thank you for giving me Evilmoon, but I am unable to return the favor. All I can do is fight with my full power.”

A furious battle intent soared out of Long Chen. His six stars began to revolve, causing his 108,000 astral spaces to resonate. All his power ignited together with Evilmoon’s power.

Heavens’ Wrath. This was the true Heavens’ Wrath. Long Chen and Evilmoon entered this state together. They no longer gave any damns.

BOOM!

Sovereign Yun Shang was no longer able to keep hold of Evilmoon. It blasted away his hands, forcing him back several steps.

Sovereign Yun Shang’s eyes glowed. He nodded. “Yes, this is the only way that you have a chance of surviving.”

As his hands entwined, the void twisted along with them. After that, a ray of light spun through the air at Long Chen. The laws of the Heavenly Daos had been compressed to the pinnacle. As a result, an ear-piercing sound caused the experts’ eardrums to feel like they would explode.

There were no hand seals or spiritual fluctuations. This terrifying attack came without any omen.

BOOM!

Without even thinking about it, Long Chen slashed Evilmoon at the light. The light was then forced to the side, flying past him and striking the heavenly barrier. It instantly pierced through the barrier and passed just below people’s feet. Just feeling it pass made them feel like there was a sour feeling throughout their entire body, and some people almost fell from the sky. A bit closer and they would be turned into nothingness.

BOOM!

The light pierced through the Martial Heaven Sea-Ring, leaving a giant channel in its wake. It reached the bottom of the sea and then caused the earth to explode, revealing golden light.

The sea was blasted away, and it seemed that some kind of terrifying law was freezing spacetime, preventing the water from returning. Through that hole, people could clearly see that golden body. Audible gulps were heard.

“The Heaven Devastating Bracelet.”

That golden light hadn’t been quite clear before, but Sovereign Yun Shang’s attack allowed them to see it clearly. That piece of gold was the tip of the iceberg of the Heaven Devastating Bracelet. They could feel its terror.

Just as everyone was looking toward the Heaven Devastating Bracelet, Long Chen was already attacking Sovereign Yun Shang. At the same time, Sovereign Yun Shang smashed a fist onto Evilmoon, causing a huge explosion that shook the heavens.

After blocking Evilmoon with one fist, Sovereign Yun Shang’s other hand slashed toward Long Chen’s neck like a sword. Long Chen received it with his shoulder, turning it into a bloody mess.

“Long Chen was injured!”

“Heavens, just how terrifying are the Sovereigns?”

“How can he possibly pass like this?”

In just the second exchange, Long Chen was injured. How was he supposed to fight like this?

Just as Long Chen’s shoulder was injured, a lightning spear appeared in his left hand and stabbed through Sovereign Yun Shang’s ribs. The latter was sent flying.

Exchanging injury for injury. Long Chen had exchanged the wound to his shoulder to guarantee a strike. However, people didn’t even have a chance to react before their expressions changed. The wound in Sovereign Yun Shang’s body wasn’t bleeding. They only saw lightning runes flickering within his body, and then those lightning runes reformed his body and even his white robes. There was no sign of any injury.

“There’s no way…”

This made people feel despair. The Sovereigns were already undefeatable existences, and now they even had undying bodies in this tribulation, as well as limitless power? They would never die. How could this tribulation be passed?

However, Long Chen wasn’t dissuaded. It was as if everything was within his expectations. With Evilmoon in hand, he once more attacked Sovereign Yun Shang.

Sovereign Yun Shang formed hand seals for the first time. At the same time, the nine heavens changed color, and the stars in the sky quivered. After that, heavenly pillars appeared, shooting toward Long Chen like celestial spears.

The giant pillars fell limitlessly, trapping Long Chen within them. Their astral runes contained endless wild auras.

Long Chen roared and slashed Evilmoon. “Split the Heavens 8!”

He used the eighth form of Split the Heavens in a circular arc. He could tell that this was a giant trapping formation.

As a result, his saber-image slashed through the pillars, shattering them. With the Heavens’ Wrath activated to its peak state, the eighth form of Split the Heavens unleashed unprecedented power.

Shockingly, when the pillars shattered, they didn’t dissipate into runes. Instead, they became giant stones that shot out in every direction.

Those stones pierced through the heavenly barrier, turning it into a sieve. They then continued toward the crowd, causing panic.

“Block them!” People immediately began to attack those rocks. They were too concentrated to dodge.

“Everyone, don’t panic! As long as you mouth the name of Sovereign Mo Nian, I guarantee that you will be safe.”

A bronze cauldron appeared, unleashing rays of divine light that blasted apart those stones.
