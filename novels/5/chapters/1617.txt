Chapter 1612 Old Patriarch Long Chen

Translator: BornToBe

The darkness was familiar. By the time the gate was destroyed, Long Chen had already escaped through it.

“Stimulating.”

Long Chen sighed with relief. That really had been dangerous at the end. He had almost made a big mistake.

That huge hand had been a manifestation of the laws of the Netherworld. Now that he had left, it would also vanish. The old man’s gate would be fine.

“Long Chen, do you remember how you escaped from Purgatory at the end?” asked Evilmoon suddenly.

“Ah, you know what, I really can’t remember. I was caught by the chains when trying to take the purgatory evil dragon corpse. I remember struggling and not being able to escape the chains. And then... and then my head’s blank. My next memory is appearing outside the Gates of Hell. What happened in the middle?” asked Long Chen.

“Hello? Why aren’t you saying anything?” asked Long Chen when Evilmoon didn’t reply.

Evilmoon was silent for a long time. Eventually, it said, “It’s nothing. You managed to forcibly escape from Purgatory. It makes sense that Purgatory would erase those memories. The only strange thing is that it only erased a portion of your memories. Curious.”

In the end, Evilmoon decided to conceal what had happened to Long Chen in the end. It had sensed something, and after considering it, it decided that Long Chen shouldn’t learn of this.

“That makes sense. Anyone who returns from the Netherworld has their memories erased. But I didn’t go through the Gates of Hell, so I only had a portion erased. It seems the Netherworld really is strange.” Long Chen nodded.

The majority of Netherpassage experts were not as amazing as Qu Jianying. Qu Jianying had managed to seal a portion of her memories and bring them out, but the majority of Netherpassage experts had all their memories erased by some mysterious energy.

It was said that the Netherworld existed on a Yin plane, while the world of the living existed on a Yang plane, which meant that memories of the other plane had to be erased. However, this was just a guess, and it was just what everyone said. There was no solid proof of the matter.

“Long Chen, have you ever felt yourself to be evil or very sinister?” asked Evilmoon suddenly.

“What? Did you take the wrong medicine this morning? Aren’t you an evil weapon that has slaughtered countless people? Don’t you feel embarrassed calling me evil?” Long Chen was speechless.

“Alright, let’s not talk about that then.” Evilmoon shut its mouth. It felt that its own communication abilities were lacking. It couldn’t pull any useful information out of Long Chen without him sensing something.

“Evilmoon, why are you acting strange?” asked Long Chen curiously.

“It’s nothing. I’m going to absorb the purgatory evil dragon’s soul essence. I won’t be able to help you during this time, so try to act calm.” After that, Evilmoon fell silent.

Long Chen clearly felt that Evilmoon’s words were a bit strange and off from how it usually acted. He was about to ask it for more details when his body shook.

Long Chen opened his eyes. He found himself to be in a sealed-off room. At this moment, he was a white-haired skinny elder.

The moment the Netherworld’s laws had been about to kill him, an expert from the Corrupt path had attacked the Netherpassage realm. Long Chen had instantly recognized his robes. At that moment, he had been so moved that he had almost cried. This was his first time feeling that the Corrupt path’s experts also had a lovable side to them.

Now that Long Chen had gone through the expert’s gate, he had entered his body. That expert’s Yuan Spirit had been destroyed, and this body had become a masterless object, allowing Long Chen to control it.

Long Chen opened the door. The sight that entered his eyes was a naked man and woman sweating and plowing the fields.

Both the man and woman were Life Star experts. In the midst of their plowing, they saw Long Chen walk in. They immediately knelt on the ground, quivering with terror. The woman was especially terrified.

“Greetings, patriarch!”

Long Chen directly pressed a finger against the man’s head. A lightning arrow pierced his head, killing him.

A rush of information poured through his mind. Long Chen learned that the owner of the body he was in was called Zhao Manchu. He was the old patriarch of the Evil Spirit Sect, while the man he had just killed was the Evil Spirit Sect’s new sect leader.

As for the woman, that was a bit interesting. She was Zhao Manchu’s disciple and his dual cultivation cauldron. However, just the third day after he went into seclusion to attack the Netherpassage realm, she had ended up with the new sect leader.

Experts attacking the Netherpassage realm would take at least three months to succeed. Some would even take years. The two of them had never expected their old patriarch to return so quickly.

“Things are a bit messed up now...”

Long Chen clapped himself on the forehead. He hadn’t expected this old ghost to still have such firepower at such an age. However, the old patriarch didn’t know that someone else had already given him a green hat.

“Patriarch, don’t kill me! Please, think of the years I’ve attended you...”

Long Chen pointed another finger, killing her.

“If you knew life was so precious, why did you take other people’s lives so easily?” sighed Long Chen.

If they weren’t from the Corrupt path, he wouldn’t have killed them. Whether or not they wanted to give a green hat to this old ghost had nothing to do with him.

However, the Corrupt path’s hands were covered in the blood of the Righteous path. If it was just the blood of the Righteous path, he wouldn’t care that much. After all, the Righteous path didn’t have many good people either.

However, the Corrupt path’s first step on their cultivation paths was to kill the innocent commoners and use their blood as proof of their conviction toward their Corrupt God.

That was something Long Chen couldn’t accept. So he didn’t feel any guilt about killing them.

Long Chen entered a larger palace from his room. Sitting on the throne, he shouted, “All core elders are to come for an emergency meeting!”

The entire Evil Spirit Sect was shaken. None of its members could understand how their old patriarch had come out so quickly from his seclusion.

“Greetings, patriarch!”

In just a bit, over seventy core Elders gathered. Of these people, half were Life Star experts. This Evil Spirit Sect had to be very powerful.

“Two of you go and drag out those two brutes inside,” ordered Long Chen coldly.

All the Elders’ expressions were odd. Two of them entered the back of the palace and came out with two corpses. Everyone became shocked, but no one said a word.

“Let me tell you, I’m in a bad mood, a very bad mood,” said Long Chen gloomily.

The Elders were silent out of fear. If such a thing happened to anyone, they would also be in a bad mood. They just prayed that the patriarch’s anger wouldn’t fall on them.

“Tell me, what had happened during the time I was in seclusion?” demanded Long Chen.

“Reporting to the old patriarch, an emissary from Pill Valley came yesterday to discuss something with the sect leader. He has yet to leave!” reported an Elder.

In truth, Long Chen already knew about this from soulsearching the new sect leader. He was asking on purpose as a cover.

After the battle in the Grand Han, Qu Jianying had released the experts from the Corrupt path so that they could bring word to the higher-ups of the Corrupt path to not be used by Pill Valley.

Ever since then, the Corrupt path had become much calmer. The Corrupt path wasn’t led by fools. After being used for so long and suffering such losses, they hadn’t gained anything.

Pill Valley itself hadn’t been bringing out its real power and only using others. In the end, they had retreated like turtles into their shells. That had made the Corrupt path very dissatisfied with Pill Valley.

That was why the various large forces of the Corrupt path had no desire to work with Pill Valley again. Their cooperation had caused the Corrupt path to suffer large losses. Before, those losses were secretly paid back with medicinal pills from Pill Valley. However, ever since the matter of Master Long San, their medicinal pill’s supply had also become tight.

As a result, the Corrupt path didn’t wish to work with them any longer. However, Pill Valley really had some skills. They had taken advantage of when Zhao Manchu was attacking the Netherpassage realm to seduce the new sect leader.

“Bring him over!” shouted Long Chen.

Very quickly, an elder wearing Pill Valley’s robes walked in. When Long Chen saw him, he narrowed his eyes slightly.

The thing he couldn’t comprehend was that he recognized this elder. He was one of Pill Valley’s Grand Elders. However, he belonged to the conservative faction.

Wasn’t the conservative faction supposed to focus on calmly developing and not interfering with the outside world? However, he had actually run over to form a relationship with the Evil Spirit Sect.

“Greetings, sect leader Zhao!” The Pill Valley Elder cupped his fists toward Long Chen with a faint smile. He seemed very relaxed.

Long Chen smiled coldly. “What’s with that smile? Are you prostituting yourself? Someone come beat him, beat him until he’s dead!” Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

When Long Chen gave his orders, no one could believe their ears. They looked at their patriarch in shock. Had he gone mad? He wanted to kill one of Pill Valley’s Grand Elders?

“You! What are you doing?!” shouted the Grand Elder.

“I’ve already said that I’m not in a good mood. Anyone who dares to go against my orders will be executed! You all can choose who you’d rather die, him or you,” roared Long Chen.

“Die!” Those Elders hesitated no longer and attacked Pill Valley’s Grand Elder.

“You’ve gone mad!”

The Grand Elder roared, and flames exploded out of him. However, there were too many people here. After blocking one attack, he fled outside the palace.

“Activate the grand formation! Don’t let him run!” shouted an Elder. The grand protective formation was instantly activated, and Pill Valley’s Grand Elder suddenly turned into a turtle in a jar. He was besieged by over thirty Life Star experts.

Refreshing, truly refreshing! The feeling of playing people to death was truly good!

Long Chen watched as the sanctimonious Grand Elder was forced to run miserably. It was a brilliant sight.

“Whoever kills him will become the new sect leader!” Seeing that things weren’t lively enough, Long Chen added some extra spice.
