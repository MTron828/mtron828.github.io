Chapter 4186: Arrogant Xu Family

“Daddy, I saw a housepet that I wanted to buy, but they refused to acknowledge my kindness! They even insulted me!”

This woman instantly put on an aggrieved expression, as if she was the one being bullied.

Her sudden act of “thief crying thief” enraged Guo Ran and the others. She was the one who was unreasonable and rude as she tried to snatch the Violet Pupil Nine Tail Fox.

However, when everyone heard that these unreasonable people were from the Violet Blood race, they finally understood why Luo Bing and Luo Ning were holding onto Long Chen with their lives.

So these people were from the Violet Blood race just like Luo Bing and Luo Ning. However, they were too infuriating.

Everyone knew that Long Chen had a relationship with the Violet Blood race. However, they didn’t know just how deep that relationship was.

“Hmph, how brazen! If the sale doesn’t work, then that’s whatever. But to dare to harm my daughter, today, none of you will leave here alive!”

Like a flying fortress, the giant battleship stopped in front of them, unleashing the pressure of an entire world.

Following that, the door opened, and a middle-aged man in violet-gold robes and a violet-gold crown walked out.

He was an innate Heaven Venerate with violet qi swirling around him. Moreover, strange runes flowed within his eyes like the sun and moon. When his gaze swept over everyone, they all felt a chill in their bones, as though his gaze was seeing through all their secrets.

When he saw Long Chen though, he revealed a hint of surprise. But his expression grew odd when he looked at Luo Bing and Luo Ning.

“You’re from the Violet Blood’s Luo family?”

Luo Bing cupped her fists. “Reporting to senior, we are from the Violet Blood’s Luo family. There is a whole story for this matter. Senior, you cannot just listen to your daughter’s one-sided narration-”

“Since you’re from the Violet Blood race, there’s no need to say so much. Come over here. How can the noble Violet Blood race be with a bunch of rabble?” The middle-aged man interrupted her and frowned.

“Senior, you…” Luo Bing’s heart sank.

This man’s cultivation base and air showed that he had an extremely high status. Originally, Luo Bing had hoped that he would resolve this problem and make his daughter apologize to Bai Xiaole. Then their conflict could be settled.

However, he refused to even listen to her. His impatience and condescending attitude toward Long Chen and his companions left her feeling disheartened.

“Come over here now! This is an order!” barked the middle-aged man.

Upon hearing this, Luo Bing was gradually angered. This man was completely overbearing and as unreasonable as his daughter.

“Bring those two back. Don’t let them embarrass the Violet Blood race.” The middle-aged man impatiently gave orders when he saw Luo Bing and Luo Ning disobeying.

Two Heaven Venerates immediately walked over to them, ignoring Long Chen and the others.

“You’re the embarrassing bunch here. If you two dare to touch any one of us, I guarantee that you won’t see tomorrow’s sun,” declared Long Chen. He had reached his limit, so his voice was icy.

Long Chen had never heard of the Xu family of the Violet Blood race. According to reason, his grandfather wouldn’t conceal such a thing from him.

Moreover, his grandfather had endured in silence for so long, all for the sake of saving his people. However, he had never wanted to join forces with this Xu family. There had to be a reason.

Luo Zichuan had been willing to risk his life alone rather than work with the Xu family. Long Chen had been wondering why his grandpa did this when he first saw these people, but seeing how tyrannical they were, Long Chen immediately thought of one possibility.

Now, the Xu family actually wanted to take their people? Long Chen stood in their way, his hand on the Minghong Saber’s hilt.

“Hahaha, who would have thought that there is someone so arrogant outside of my Xu family? Brat, my Xu family can be arrogant, but you can’t. If you want to be arrogant, you should have the ability to back it up. Seize them! Execute anyone who gets in your way!” ordered the middle-aged man.

All this time, the Xu family’s young disciples kept sneering disdainfully at Long Chen and the others, looking down on them as if they were a group of prisoners.

“The two of you still aren’t coming?”

The two Heaven Venerates walked straight to Luo Bing and Luo Ning, who were seething with anger. The two sisters looked at the countless experts behind the middle-aged man and then at the few members on their side. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

Luo Bing exchanged a meaningful look with Luo Ning, who promptly understood. After that, they stepped forward together.

“There’s no need for you to do anything. We-”

“You cannot leave. As long as I am here, no one can bring you away,” interrupted Long Chen.

Luo Bing and Luo Ning were unwilling to implicate Long Chen and the others. After all, the power disparity between the two sides was far too great. Although they harbored no good feelings toward this Xu family, considering that they were all from the Violet Blood race, the two sisters didn’t think that the Xu family would make things hard on them.

“A mantis trying to stop a chariot.”

Those two Heaven Venerates sneered and directly attacked. Their hands, bathed in violet divine radiance, extended toward Luo Bing and Luo Ning. At the same time, an imperceptible ripple surged toward Long Chen.

This was a spiritual attack, as they not only grabbed the two sisters but also used the Violet Blood race’s specific Spiritual Strength to teach Long Chen a lesson.

Rather than calling it a lesson, it might be more appropriate to call it a shameless sneak attack. That was because the Violet Blood race’s spiritual attack was very powerful, and someone who was caught off-guard or someone with weak Spiritual Strength might have their soul directly shattered.

These two were Heaven Venerates, and although on the surface they appeared to be grabbing Luo Bing and Luo Ning, in truth they were secretly attacking a little Immortal King. This act was not only shameless but also treacherous.

“Long Chen, don’t!”

When the two used a spiritual attack on Long Chen, Luo Bing’s expression completely changed. She saw Long Chen’s eyes transform into the coldest expression she had ever witnessed.

Before Long Chen understood the relationship between the Luo family and the Xu family, he didn’t actually want to kill anyone. But his fury could no longer be contained.

Just as Luo Bing let out a startled cry, the Minghong Saber flew out of its sheath, colliding against the two Heaven Venerates’ spiritual attacks.

The saber was like a divine dragon flying out of the sea. Its heaven-shaking saber cry erupted along with icy killing intent, as well as Long Chen’s will.

As a result, the spiritual attacks were like eggs smashing into a city wall, instantly shattering.

Following that, the Minghong Saber slashed toward them.

Seeing this scene, the middle-aged man representing the Xu family was startled and swiftly raised his hand. However, just as he was about to interfere, his gaze shifted toward an empty space.

At that precise moment, two heads flew into the air, and a cascade of violet blood rained down.
