Chapter 3561

Long Chen shouted and his divine ring opened wide like a gaping maw, crazily devouring this Yan Xu Flame.

The Yan Xu Flame here was from the chains that Long Chen’s heart-devil had shattered, and they poured into his divine ring. This sight stunned countless people.

“The Yan Xu Flame can devour all other flames. But someone is devouring the Yan Xu Flame? Just what is happening?”

The devourer of flames was being devoured by Long Chen. This sight drove people crazy, completely toppling their understanding.

“Ignorant fool! Do you think that my Yan Xu Flame can be absorbed by the likes of-” A furious roar rang out from above the nine heavens. The Yan Xu Flames that were being absorbed rapidly condensed, as if about to blow up Long Chen’s divine ring.

However, his furious roar suddenly came to a stop. A golden lotus seed had appeared in Long Chen’s divine ring.

The golden lotus seed emitted divine light, and the Yan Xu Flame instantly lost its cohesiveness in front of that light. It then transformed into runes that were absorbed by the divine ring.

“What…???”

The owner of the Yan Xu Flames was shocked. The most terrifying thing about this golden lotus seed was that its sacred light illuminated this world, restoring light to this black world. The dark energy of the Yan Xu Flame was expelled.

“Long Chen, just wait!” An unwilling roar rang out and then the black flames scattered.

However, although the black flames scattered very quickly, much of them was still absorbed by Long Chen.

Long Chen gathered all the flames he could, and then lightning appeared beneath his feet. Just as he was about to flee, the world spun around him. His vision darkened and he could no longer maintain his consciousness. After that, he fainted.

“It’s over.”

A single thought formed in Long Chen’s mind just as he fell unconscious.

After consecutive battles, Long Chen had run out of energy. Just now, when his heart-devil took over, it took his utmost effort to take back control. Hence, he had severely overdrafted his mental energy.

He also knew that he had overdrafted himself, which was why he was in a rush to leave and find a safe place to rest.

However, who would have thought that he had overdrafted himself so severely that he directly fell unconscious here? He would be a lamb for the slaughter, and countless people would fight over his corpse.

As expected, when Long Chen fell from the sky and the fire of his soul was almost extinguished, countless experts charged at him.

There were people from the human race, the demon race, the devil race, etc. Countless experts charged at him. Some wanted to kill him, and some wanted to catch him alive.

“Who dares to harm him?!”

Just then, a cold shout shook heaven and earth, and a supreme pressure crashed down. Even late stage World Kings felt their souls shaking. They didn’t dare to move.

“The pressure of a Divine Venerate!”

People were shocked. An almighty Divine Venerate was descending.

“Master!”

Yu Qingxuan, who was mixed in with the crowd and preparing to grab Long Chen, was so overwhelmed with joy when she heard that voice. She could only weep.

After that, the void quivered and a white-robed elder with a sword on his back appeared. As soon as he showed up, the experts that had been charging at Long Chen were repelled by an invisible force.

This person was the Blazing Heaven Divine Sect’s sect master, as well as Yu Qingxuan’s master, Divine Venerate Dongfang Zichu.

When Dongfang Zichu appeared, all those other experts let out a grunt and flew back. In front of a Divine Venerate, they appeared incredibly weak. They couldn’t even form the will to fight back.

A Divine Venerate. That was an apex overlord of this world. Countless cultivators would never see an existence on this level in their lifetimes, so countless people looked at Dongfang Zichu reverently.

Dongfang Zichu reached out to catch Long Chen. However, just as his hand was about to touch Long Chen, another powerful hand caught him first.

“What?!”

People were shocked. Someone dared to snatch him from Dongfang Zichu? Someone who could move under the might of a Divine Venerate could only be another Divine Venerate, no? Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

People looked over to see a lofty man in golden robes. He had a crown and a golden belt on, looking extremely grand. Despite already having white hair, nothing could conceal his ruler qi.

Standing there, he caused countless people to form a desire to prostrate themselves before him. People were shocked. Where did this other almighty expert appear from?

“Senior…!” Yu Qingxuan was stunned and delighted. This elder was precisely the elder with ruler qi, the one who had drunk wine together with Long Chen in the Wine God Palace. She hadn’t expected her master and this elder to save Long Chen together.

“Brother Guhong, it’s been a long time.” Dongfang Zichu was a bit surprised and then cupped his fists.

“It truly has been a long time.” The elder nodded.

Dongfang Zichu smiled slightly. “This junior brother saved my disciple’s life. That’s why I had to interfere. I didn’t expect that you would also come to save this junior brother. If I had known that brother Guhong was present, I wouldn’t have embarrassed myself.”

“Guhong? Heavens, he couldn’t be that monarch of the Grand Xia Nation from the archaic era, that Xia Guhong, could he?!” A startled cry rang out.

“According to legend, the Grand Xia imperial family was born inheriting heaven and earth’s Grand Dao. They are the heir of one of the ten great primal chaos divine items, the Grand Xia Dragon Sparrow.”

“Wasn’t it said that Xia Guhong already died following the destruction of the Grand Xia Nation? Is there some mistake?”

“It can’t be a mistake. The Grand Xia imperial bloodline is the noblest of bloodlines. This kind of bloodline suppression cannot be faked.”

Countless elders discussed this golden-robed elder amongst themselves. They were filled with shock.

Xia Guhong was the final monarch of the Grand Xia Nation. He was a famous existence in the human race’s history. In campaigns against enemy worlds, he had slaughtered countless lifeforms and contributed unforgettable meritorious deeds.

The human race’s history had a page dedicated to him. Later on, when the Grand Xia nation was destroyed, he vanished as well. People all thought that he had died, and countless people had sighed regretfully over the loss.

Who would have thought that he was still alive and would appear at this time? It was unbelievable.

Xia Guhong looked at Dongfang Zichu. “This junior brother is my drinking friend. Despite the age difference, we are brothers. Now that he is injured, I think it would be better for me to bring him to the Wine God Palace to recover. What do you think?”

Dongfang Zichu smiled. “Of course. Whether it is the Wine God Palace or my Blazing Heaven Divine Sect, I trust that no one could harm him there. Also, the Wine God Palace is a miraculous place. I believe it to be more suitable for healing his wounds.”

Dongfang Zichu was very refined, giving people the feeling of a modest nobleman. It seemed that nothing would make him angry. For a grand Divine Venerate to not stand on any airs, it was truly a comfortable feeling.

“Then let us say goodbye!”

Xia Guhong cupped his fists, nodded slightly to the distant Yu Qingxuan, and vanished with Long Chen just like that in front of everyone’s gaze.
