Chapter 3424 Positions Switched

“Go ahead. As long as you don’t ask me to kill, I will agree to anything,” said the protector spirit sincerely.

“I will destroy this world. But there are some old fellows outside that I can’t beat. I’ll need you to send me away from them when the time comes,” said Long Chen.

“No problem. I definitely won’t let you die. I swear on the mark of the star-field on your body,” she promised.

“Good. I’m going to start destroying this world.” Long Chen’s Blood Qi began to circulate quickly.

“Wait. I’ll pull them out and bring you in. The spiritual qi inside of this space is like my blood. Sending you in can count as repaying your favor. When you go to other star-fields, as long as their cores are kind, they will feel closer to you, and their Heavenly Dao energy will also grow closer to you,” she said, vanishing.

Once she vanished, time started flowing again. Lei Yuner was pointing and cursing Wu Ying, while Wu Ying sneered arrogantly in reply, infuriating Lei Yuner until she stamped her feet.

“What do we do?! We can’t get in!” Lei Yuner shook Long Chen’s hand anxiously.

“Don’t worry. They’re about to scram,” said Long Chen calmly.Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

“You think that we’ll leave? Keep dreaming. Once I have the mark of the Heavenly Daos, I’ll immediately come out and kill you,” sneered Wu Ying and showed the two of them her palm. There was a rune on her palm. It was currently translucent, but there was a small portion that had become red. It was like blood entering her body.

Seeing that rune, Long Chen instantly understood the will of the Integral Heaven Star-Field’s protector spirit. This formation was truly extracting her blood.

Wu Ying’s aura was already several times stronger than before. Even through the formation, they could sense her powerful Blood Qi. This rune was strengthening her physical body.

However, her sneer suddenly stiffened. She was shocked to find that the mysterious energy flowing into her body from that rune was starting to flow back out.

“What’s going on?!”

It wasn’t just Wu Ying who was shocked. The other experts inside also noticed the same phenomenon. The runes on their bodies were growing dim and vanished in the end.

Lei Yuner was pleasantly surprised. She didn’t know what was going on, but seeing their expressions, she knew that something unexpected had happened.

Let alone them, even the Sacred Pill Hall’s people in the outside world were stunned. They also didn’t understand why such a strange phenomenon would occur.

Suddenly, the barrier quivered. Wu Ying and the others cried out as they were sent flying out of the barrier. However, Wu Wing in particular was flying straight toward Long Chen and Lei Yuner.

Long Chen almost instinctively slapped her, sending her flying back.

Lei Yuner was shocked. The barrier was now empty, so Long Chen laughed and pulled her into the barrier with him.

Wu Ying, the eighth prince, and the others were all enraged. They didn’t even know what had happened, and they charged back at the barrier.

As a result, they were all flatly rejected.

“Hahaha, you fools, you don’t know anything! I am a relative of the Sacred Pill Hall. This is their special treatment for me. Did you think that they would leave the good stuff to you?” laughed Long Chen arrogantly from inside the barrier.

After that, all the experts in the plaza couldn’t help looking at the Sacred Pill Hall’s people. The hall master coldly shouted, “He’s spouting nonsense!”

The Sacred Pill Hall was a mortal enemy of the High Firmament Academy. Since that was the case, how could the hall master give Long Chen special treatment? But as for why such a thing would occur, even they didn’t know.

Wu Ying, the eighth prince, and the others repeatedly attacked the barrier, but it was incomparably tough. They were unable to break it.

“Hahaha, now it’s your turn to be angered… pfft!” Lei Yuner was clapping and sneering at them when she suddenly coughed up blood.

Seeing this scene, Long Chen was startled. Lei Yuner’s face turned pale as she had been injured.

“Ah, the power here needs to be shared between sixteen people. Now that it’s just the two of you, she can’t endure it. Send her out.” That woman’s voice rang out in his mind.

Long Chen then sent Lei Yuner out of the barrier with a shove. That scene enraged the leader of the Lightning Falcon race. “This bastard, repaying kindness with enmity! He completely betrayed Yuner’s kindness!”

All the Lightning Falcon race’s experts cursed Long Chen furiously upon seeing that. The moment Long Chen saw the greatest treasure, he wanted to devour it himself.

Even Wu Ying and the others found it unexpected. However, they quickly reached the same line of thought as the rest of the Lightning Falcon race… Lei Yuner had been abandoned.

Only Lei Yuner was revitalized once she was thrown out. Inside the barrier, it felt like her head was about to split apart.

Once she was out, her mind instantly cleared up. She also heard Long Chen’s instructions in her mind. After that, she clenched her fists. Only she knew that a rune had appeared on her left and right palms.

“My mark requires powerful Spiritual Strength to receive. Demonic beasts don’t specialize in this regard, so they need more people to share it. But you possess soul energy as vast as a sea. It would have been no problem for you to take it all, but you split two portions with her. From this, it’s clear that you’re a good person who cares deeply about emotions.” The woman’s voice once more rang out in his mind. At the same time, sixteen rays of divine light illuminated Long Chen, forming a giant halo around him.

“I admit to caring about emotions, but I am definitely not a good person,” said Long Chen, shaking his head. He actually disdained being a good person.

Perhaps the demonic beasts were being used by the Sacred Pill Hall, but Long Chen was not a good person who could forgive that eighth prince of the Mammoth Divine Elephant race who had killed the nine star heir. Long Chen wouldn’t let him off just because he was unaware of the truth.

The divine light slowly merged into Long Chen’s body, and his mind was refreshed. It felt like the world had suddenly become kinder toward him. The laws seemed so much closer to him now.

“You are naturally rejected by the Heavenly Daos. But my blessing will lessen that rejection. That is the only thing I can do for you,” she said, her voice sounding a bit guilty.

When her rune merged into Long Chen’s body, she noticed that it was as if Long Chen was cursed by the Heavenly Daos. Her power could only help him a little bit, so she felt apologetic.

“That’s enough. I’ve never experienced such a moving feeling before. Thank you. Thank you for showing me just how beautiful it is to not be rejected.”

Long Chen clenched his fists. This Heavenly Dao rune didn’t make his physical body grow stronger, but it allowed him to control even more Heavenly Dao energy. This was something that he hadn’t dared to even dream of obtaining before.

Just then, cracks appeared in the barrier. Wu Ying and the others instantly saw that and became crazy, staring at Long Chen like hungry wolves.

BOOM!

The barrier shattered. With a howl, the eighth prince of the Mammoth Divine Elephant race was the first to charge at Long Chen.

“Inferior human, die!”
