Chapter 4046 The Heavens Will Be Pierced

The flower petal pierced Long Chen’s body like a sharp blade, causing golden blood to gush out. As for the petal, it was like a piece of melting ice merging into Long Chen’s body.

Long Chen’s entire body was shaking. He looked as if he was suffering unimaginable pain, but he did not hesitate to grab another petal.

“What is he doing?”

Yu Xiaoyun was bewildered. If Long Chen died, would Yu Qingxuan wish to stay alive? Even if she lived, it would be a life worse than death for her.

“He is grafting the Nether Emperor’s seal onto his own body. This foolish child…” Jiang Huixin stared at Long Chen nervously.

In order to save Yu Qingxuan, Long Chen was throwing his own life away. But why bother? Would Yu Qingxuan not follow him then?

The next moment, Long Chen stabbed another petal into his body, and it once more quivered. However, Long Chen clenched his teeth and didn’t make a sound.

“Long Chen, don’t! If you die, what would be the point in me living? Don’t be selfish! You still have Meng Qi, Chu Yao, Ye Zhiqiu, Tang Wan-er, and the others waiting for you!” begged Yu Qingxuan.

She couldn’t even move under the pressure of the Netherworld’s laws, so she could only watch as Long Chen killed herself.

Long Chen repeatedly plucked the petals and stabbed them into his body. The pain was something that he had never endured before. It was even more painful than refining his spirit.

However, Long Chen didn’t mind. After all, he had experienced something even more painful. The pain of seeing Yu Qingxuan dying in front of him on the Martial Heaven Continent was a million times more painful.

As Long Chen repeatedly stabbed the petals into his body, the hell flower gradually bloomed behind him. When he stabbed the final petal into his body, Yu Qingxuan’s body suddenly regained its freedom.

“Long Chen!”

Yu Qingxuan urgently held onto Long Chen, fearing he might push her away. Her fear wasn't of death itself; instead, it was the dread of living in a world without him.

“Qingxuan, you have to trust me. I won’t let you leave me, and I won’t leave you,” said Long Chen solemnly.

Even though Long Chen did his best to control his voice, it was still hoarse due to the pain. Upon hearing it, Yu Qingxuan’s dried-out eyes once more overflowed. She gently rubbed Long Chen’s face. “It must be painful…”

“It doesn’t hurt. It’s still within the realm that I can handle. But without you, the pain would be too much to live with,” said Long Chen. “Go. I’m going to ask the Nether Emperor what qualifications he has to dare to take my wife.”

Yu Qingxuan hesitated but still nodded. “If you fail, I will accompany you.”

Long Chen nodded. Only then did Yu Qingxuan let go. Long Chen lightly pushed her, and she escaped the death qi.

Jiang Huixin immediately caught Yu Qingxuan. She wept, unable to say a single word.

Yu Qingxuan then comforted her mother, but her gaze was on Long Chen. Everyone’s gaze was on him.

All of them were anxious. Long Chen had been fighting for a long time and had basically exhausted himself. What was he going to bring out to fight a supreme existence like the Nether Emperor?

Heaven and earth were deathly silent. The envoy from hell had stopped playing their music and just watched motionlessly.

Long Chen floated slowly toward the massive palanquin. As he drew nearer, the curtain gradually parted with a cracking sound. The interior of the palanquin was engulfed in darkness, and a potent aura of the Netherworld surged forth from it, making it resemble the gaping maw of a fearsome beast.

With a deep breath, Long Chen slowly closed his eyes and began forming intricate hand seals. As he did so, the hell flower behind him trembled and then gradually merged into his body, as if becoming one with him.

“What is boss doing?!” Guo Ran was shocked. Long Chen was absorbing the hell flower? Would he ever be able to leave it after that?

Even Ye Wusheng’s pupils shrank when she saw that.

“This is… Is he thinking of…?”

Everyone was stunned. They didn’t know what Long Chen was doing, or what he was thinking.

Long Chen’s left eye snapped open, and it was pitch-black. Within that darkness, the image of the hell flower slowly appeared.

After that, heaven and earth quivered as a giant illusory figure enveloped the entire envoy from hell.

“Purgatory Eyes, Hell Flower Bloom!” Long Chen let out a furious roar that shook the world.Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

BOOM!

When the hell flower bloomed, the envoy from hell, including the giants and palanquin, all exploded.

“He can control the power of hell?”

Even Ye Wusheng was taken aback by the sight. Her gaze fixed upon Long Chen's eye, and a glimmer of divine light flickered in her own eyes. However, what she was thinking remained a mystery.

“Long Chen…!” Yu Qingxuan let out a pained cry. Long Chen’s left eye was bleeding, and black blood was flowing out of it.

Furthermore, after unleashing this pupil art, his entire face grew dark, as if his soul had been sucked away.

Seeing Long Chen in such a state, Yu Qingxuan felt as if her heart had been pierced. She could feel the immense sacrifice he was making for her sake. She was about to rush over to him when, all of a sudden, the hell gate in the sky erupted into a massive vortex, shaking the entire scene.

The exhausted Long Chen was sucked into the vortex, and this sudden change made everyone cry out.

“Still nothing?” Ye Wusheng clenched her dagger and stared tightly at the hell gate. Based on her calculations, someone should be appearing at this time.

However, no one appeared, and Long Chen was instantly sucked into the heart of the vortex. On the other side was hell, so if the gate closed behind him, there was no coming out.

“Fuck, I’ll risk it all!”

Long Chen suddenly spread his arms. The next moment, space quivered and a bronze cauldron appeared in his hands.

“Go fuck yourself, Nether Emperor!”

After Long Chen poured all his remaining energy into the bronze cauldron, he smashed it at the hell gate.

This was Long Chen’s final trump card. The dragon expert had told him not to use it, but he had nothing else and could only risk it.

BOOM!

The hell gate exploded with a force that seemed to pierce the heavens themselves. When the explosion occurred, the runes on the bronze cauldron briefly lit up, and it flew back to Long Chen and disappeared.

The hell gate was gone. However, the imprint of an ancient cauldron remained embedded in the void, not fading for a long time.

“This time, the heavens will be pierced.”

Looking at the imprint of this ancient cauldron, Ye Wusheng muttered to herself.
