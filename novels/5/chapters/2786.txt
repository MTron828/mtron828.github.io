Chapter 2775 Wolf God, Awaken!

“Now isn’t the time. Remember, all of us here are ultimately waiting for Long Chen to become a Sovereign. Only he can prevent the upcoming calamity. Any advantages or disadvantages that appear here aren’t important. What is important is whether or not Long Chen can become a Sovereign. If he is interrupted, then all lifeforms of the Martial Heaven Continent will meet their end,” said the High Priest.

The five Sovereigns were all sitting in the air like statues. Their bodies were starting to grow illusory.

Under the attacks of Gui Si, the Kunpeng Emperor, and the Blood race’s Emperor, their remnant Sovereign power was slowly ground away.

“At the start, we used a tactic to bait out reinforcements before crushing them together. The other side is also using this tactic,” said Ma Ruyun. “Once you go out, no matter how many of them you kill, it will still produce blood soul energy and quicken their end goal. This is also why when the blood soul energy on the continent reached a certain level, it triggered the five Sovereigns to form this barrier and temporarily halt the battle. Since the Sovereigns stopped more blood soul energy from appearing, they had to kill their own people, but that produced far less energy. They’ll then need to kill countless members of their own races. If you go out and are surrounded by them, if any of you die, it will only benefit them.”

The slaughter on the battlefield only benefited the other side as it produced the strongest blood soul energy. Only now did the Martial Heaven Continent’s experts learn of this, but as for why the invaders would do this, Ma Ruyun didn’t say.

As the fighting outside continued, the continent’s experts inside of the barrier continued advancing. The majority of the Dragonblood warriors had advanced to the Saint realm.

Suddenly, the world dimmed and the silent Heaven Devastating Bracelet shuddered, causing everyone to jump.

“Boss has advanced to the Emperor realm!” exclaimed Guo Ran in delight.

Long Chen was sitting within the Heaven Devastating Bracelet. His whole body was surrounded by stars, and the aura of an Emperor flowed around him. At this moment, countless cracks appeared throughout the Heaven Devastating Bracelet.

The Heaven Devastating Bracelet was like a stalk of sugarcane that was having its energy squeezed out. Its body began to crumble, and all its energy was pouring into Long Chen.

“That energy is astonishing. The energy that Long Chen is absorbing is enough to blow up a Sovereign like Ye Ming,” said the High Priest with a sigh.

With the High Priest’s experience, he instantly saw that the energy that Long Chen had used to go from the ninth Heavenstage to the twelfth Heavenstage far surpassed Ye Ming’s energy as a whole.

Furthermore, breaking through to the Sovereign realm would require at least ten times more energy compared to becoming an Emperor. Long Chen truly needed an astonishing amount of energy.

Suddenly, cracks appeared in the spatial gate above the Corrupt God Cemetery. Ye Ming then raised his head and laughed, “Haha, I was still the one to take the initiative. Since my Undying race’s experts from the higher planes are descending first, victory will belong to the Undying race!”

The spatial gate shuddered and one figure after another appeared, wearing strange robes that were completely different from the other Undying experts. Shockingly, their auras were incredibly powerful, lying between the Saint realm and the Emperor realm. They should belong to the half-step Emperor category.

“Not good. Their descent is far too fast!” Daoist Heavenly Feather’s expression changed. Ye Ming was truly a schemer. Perhaps he had taken a shortcut to the Sovereign realm precisely for this.

Hundreds of those experts came out of the spatial gate, and more of them kept coming.

“Kill them!” shouted Ye Ming, raising his spear. Those foreign experts actually listened to him and charged toward Zi Yan.

Suddenly, the Southern Sea Zither’s light expanded, covering Zi Yan. Its power instantly rose by multiple levels.

At the same time, the Western Desert Ax, Central Plains Cauldron, and Northern Source Sword also skyrocketed in power. Although they were still at a disadvantage against the Nine-Headed Lion, they began to stabilize and form a stalemate.

“No, they fooled me!” The Nine-Headed Lion’s expression suddenly became gloomy. Abandoning Mo Nian and the others, he charged toward the barrier of the five Sovereigns.

After attacking all this time, the Nine-Headed Lion suddenly realized that their supreme divine items were the crux of this barrier.

For them to be supporting the barrier and fighting against him was a distribution of energy. So having their power split up like this was a kind of taboo.

The Nine-Headed Lion then realized that considering the size of the barrier, breaking it should be comparatively easier. It suddenly struck him that Mo Nian and the others had only been baiting him into a fight to avoid him targeting the barrier. Thinking of how he had wasted so much time on them, he was incredibly vexed.

Seeing the countless experts making rapid breakthroughs inside of the barrier, he realized just how foolish it was for him to try to use the four of them to force Long Chen out.

After that, he immediately abandoned Mo Nian and the others, going straight for the barrier. Ye Ming also reacted, leading the Undying race’s army toward the barrier.

Their attacks caused the barrier to shake. With their addition, the barrier was growing dimmer and dimmer. It clearly wouldn’t be long before it shattered.

Just at this moment, the light of the supreme divine items retracted, going to support the formation once more.

All of a sudden, Mo Nian unleashed an arrow as quick as lightning toward the meditating Alldevil Heavenwalker. The devil race’s army had been almost wiped out by Ma Ruyun, and those in charge of guarding the altar were now slaughtering their own people coming out of Devil Spirit Mountain in order to increase the blood soul energy in the air. Hence, by the time they realized there was an attack, they didn’t have time to stop it. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

However, just as the arrow was about to pierce the Alldevil Heavenwalker, it stopped. The Alldevil Heavenwalker’s eyes slowly opened, and a Sovereign crown appeared on his head.

“Foolish human race, you cannot escape your fate of being destroyed.” As the Alldevil Heavenwalker slowly stood up devil qi filled the sky.

The Blood race’s altar also quivered, and Blood Qi swirled around the Blood Fiend Devil Lord. At this moment, heaven and earth rumbled, and a Sovereign crown also appeared on his head.

“The Blood Fiend Devil Lord has also become a Sovereign!” Mo Nian’s heart became cold. Everything was happening too fast, and they didn’t even have a chance to breathe.

“Hahaha, the Martial Heaven Continent’s core will belong to the Blood race. No one can snatch it from us!”

The Blood Fiend Devil Lord suddenly spat a mouthful of blood on the giant egg beneath his feet. That was a Sovereign’s essence blood, containing the might of a Sovereign.

“Mighty Wolf God, awaken!”
