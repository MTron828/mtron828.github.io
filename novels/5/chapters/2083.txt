Chapter 2073 Sovereign Zi Yang

“I know what you want to ask. You’re making things difficult for me.”

Long Chen sighed apologetically, disappointing Beitang Rushuang. Before she could say anything, he continued.

“To tell the truth, your looks, talent, and experience are definitely better than mine. But my heart has already been taken, and I simply cannot marry you.”

Long Chen’s sad and regretful expression made Nangong Zuiyue smile, while Beitang Rushuang was first startled, and then her expression grew increasingly odd.

“Long Chen, can you not be so narcissistic? I, Beitang Rushuang, have seen countless amazing figures. I’m not lacking suitors to the point that I need to marry you!” Beitang Rushuang was scornful.

“Ah! So you weren’t asking for my heart? Why didn’t you say so? You scared me!” Long Chen immediately acted relieved from a great burden.

Beitang Rushuang took a deep breath. Clenching her teeth, she said, “Long Chen, count yourself lucky that you weren’t born in my generation. Otherwise, if you said such a thing, I’d beat you senseless.”

Beitang Rushuang was enraged, but Long Chen’s expression seemed to be somewhere between serious and joking, making her unable to unleash her wrath. If not for that, Beitang Rushuang would have long since taught a lesson to the thick-faced Long Chen.

“Alright, since you’ve said that, I’m at ease. Whatever you want to know, just ask. Whether or not I know the answer, I will definitely tell you,” said Long Chen.

“How will you tell me the answer if you don’t know it?” asked Beitang Rushuang.

“I’ll make something up.” Long Chen shrugged.

Beitang Rushuang glared, while Nangong Zuiyue laughed inside, although she didn’t show that on the outside.

Without them even being aware of it, he had managed to close the distance between them, making them drop their guard. For someone like Beitang Rushuang to treat a man like this so quickly, perhaps only Long Chen possessed that ability.

“Be serious. I heard you received Sovereign Yun Shang’s inheritance? Don’t misunderstand, I’m not trying to pry into your secrets. I just want to know what you know about Sovereign Yun Shang,” said Beitang Rushuang.

Hearing this, Nangong Zuiyue said, “The two of you can chat. I still have things to do, so I won’t accompany you.”

“No, there’s no need to leave. There’s nothing secret about this. You’re both my creditors now, so let’s find a place to chat. It just so happens that I’d like to ask for your teachings about many areas.” Long Chen hastily stopped her. He knew that Nangong Zuiyue had more scruples compared to someone like Beitang Rushuang who didn’t seem to care so much about such things.

The three of them found a secluded place. Long Chen took out a tent and set up a grill. He began roasting a Scarlet Blood Spirit Fish.

He also took out a jug of wine and poured some for the two of them. There was a certain appeal to sitting within the forest, witnessing the endless desert with fish and wine in hand. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Even Beitang Rushuang and Nangong Zuiyue felt this scenario to be very good. They felt less inhibited than they had in a long time.

As Long Chen took charge of cooking the fish, Beitang Rushuang tasted the wine and immediately praised it. This was wine made by a female cultivator of the Wine God Palace and was particularly to a woman’s taste. Furthermore, the accompanying mental realm contained within it made even Nangong Zuiyue drink a few more mouthfuls of it.

Long Chen took out some plates and utensils. He handed over their portions of the fish and then drank a large mouthful of his wine. It was truly satisfying.

After eating and drinking, the two women were filled with praise for Long Chen’s skill, saying that even their best cooks couldn’t make such tasty fish.

Long Chen accepted their praise with a smile. He said if things took a bad turn in this world, he could always go to their homes and become a cook, causing Beitang Rushuang to laugh and say that he was welcome at any time.

After a while, Beitang Rushuang asked the same question once again. Long Chen finished cooking two more fish and gave one each to the two of them.

“A Sovereign’s inheritance? It shouldn’t count as much. We just said a few words and he gave me a blade. He didn’t teach me anything.”

“You actually spoke to Sovereign Yun Shang?!”

Beitang Rushuang and Nangong Zuiyue both leaped to their feet, Beitang Rushuang almost dropping her fish.

“What?” Long Chen was startled, not expecting such a huge reaction.

“Are you sure you’re not bragging?” Beitang Rushuang first wished to confirm this.

Long Chen’s lip curled. Drinking some more wine, he said, “What is there to brag about? Furthermore, can’t you tell when I’m bragging?”

“I really can’t. It feels like only a few of the words that come out of your mouth are actually serious.” Beitang Rushuang spoke the direct truth without giving Long Chen any face.

On the other hand, Nangong Zuiyue was rather serious. “Long Chen, you must not know. The Sovereigns aren’t just the strongest existences of the continent. Their origins are also extremely mysterious. Their sudden rises made them the blazing suns that lit up the continent, but after a moment of splendor, they silently vanished. No one knows where they went. No one knows if they still exist in this world. Even though our ancestors bore witness to the rising of the Sovereigns, everything about them is still shrouded in mystery. Throughout history, some people have obtained legacies of the Sovereigns and became remarkable figures. Those people were not called disciples of the Sovereigns but substitutes who guarded the continent in their place. Even they only inherited the will of the Sovereigns but never actually spoke or even saw them. That’s why what you said is truly shocking.”

“So there was actually such a thing? Then couldn’t I brag about this for a lifetime?” Long Chen’s eyes widened.

“Stop messing around, or I really will beat you!” Beitang Rushuang couldn’t endure Long Chen’s mouth any longer.

“Long Chen, we have to be respectful and grateful to the Sovereigns. Don’t joke about them,” rebuked Nangong Zuiyue. She was a bit angry as Long Chen treated encountering a Sovereign as a chip for bragging.

“Fine, I admit my mistake,” Long Chen apologized directly. From his encounter with Sovereign Yun Shang, he had truly been filled with respect for him. That kind of transcendent figure had actually called him little brother without the slightest airs. Moreover, Long Chen didn’t see any arrogance in his eyes.

Nangong Zuiyue was a bit embarrassed that she had made Long Chen apologize so directly. She said, “Sorry, I was a bit harsh.”

“Not at all. I’ve gotten used to my sloppiness. For two peerless beauties like you to be eating and drinking beside me is an immense honor for me. Unfortunately, this is just my character, and I cannot easily change it. So if I say anything rude... please endure it a bit, and it will pass quickly.”

Nangong Zuiyue was just about to say some humble words about Long Chen’s rudeness when he suddenly told her to simply endure it. He had actually almost baited her. She was silent, not knowing how to respond to such a thing.

“Long Chen, have you always talked this way? If so, I’m curious just how you haven’t been beaten to death by someone already. It really is a miracle. However, I can understand why a dislikable fellow like you has enemies everywhere,” said Beitang Rushuang as if she had found the source. “Originally, I thought that you weren’t so bad. Based on what you said at the beginning, I thought you were a master of the Dao. I even thought that you had moved fairy Zuiyue, so I was hoping to ruin that. Only now do I find that I have helped her, letting her see what you truly are in an instant.”

“Fairy Rushuang, you’re overthinking it,” said Nangong Zuiyue. “My heart has always been devoted to the Dao. I’m no longer interested in profit or romance. So when it comes to past enmities, I don’t care. The past is like mist, and the dead return to dust. With the passing of time, the people have changed. Is caring about past enmities really important?”

Beitang Rushuang immediately shot up and shouted, “You were the one who harmed others, and now you criticize those who wish for vengeance like you’re some good person?! Is this the style of the Nangong family?! If it weren’t for that slut from the Nangong family, we would have been related to Sovereign Zi Yang by marriage. It was your Nangong family that ruined fairy Qingyun’s romance, causing her to fall into depression. She buried herself within the Ancient Battlefield, burying herself within the time when she was actually happy. That kind of pain, that kind of helplessness, do you think you can brush it off with just a sentence?!”

Beitang Rushuang was infuriated, and her hatred was apparent. Nangong Zuiyue stood sadly and walked out of the tent.

“Run! That’s all you can do! Does the Nangong family discuss the Dao from the front and then stab people in the back from behind?!” raged Beitang Rushuang.

Nangong Zuiyue did not pause. Ripples spread around her body, and she merged into heaven and earth, vanishing.

Long Chen stared in silence. It seemed that the enmity between their two families was truly immense. Sovereign Zi Yang? He hadn’t heard that name before.

Although Nangong Zuiyue had left, Beitang Rushuang was still shaking with rage, as well as sorrow. She was sobbing.

Long Chen didn’t say a word. He knew not to provoke her at this time.

“What are you looking at?!” Beitang Rushuang suddenly turned toward Long Chen angrily.
