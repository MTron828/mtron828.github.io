BOOM!

Long Chen once more slashed with his saber. The Empyrean Winged Blood Devils let out unwilling roars as they were annihilated within the channel.

The gate between the devil world and the Martial Heaven Continent looked gigantic, but in terms of an area that could actually be passed through, there was only a three hundred meter channel. This channel was where the laws of two worlds clashed. Within it, those Empyrean Winged Blood Devils were only able to unleash a portion of their power.

Long Chen had already found the trick to it. He no longer needed to use the sixth form of Split the Heavens now. The winged devils were slain wave by wave as he defended the exit.

Although he didn’t kill as many as he did with the sixth form of Split the Heavens, it saved him energy, and he simply attacked repeatedly. With him blocking the exit, they couldn’t charge out, infuriating the Empyrean Winged Blood Devils.

“Despicable human race, if you have guts, then let us through and have a real fight with us!”

“If you want to fight with me, that’s not a problem. I’ll help you out.” Long Chen rested his saber on his shoulder, looking disdainfully at the Empyrean Winged Blood Devils.

“Hmph, you’re the one who said that!”

The Empyrean Winged Blood Devils were delighted and hastily charged through. As a result, before they could exit, Long Chen attacked again.

“You despicable liar!”

The saber-image completely annihilated the Empyrean Winged Blood Devils who had charged through.

“Idiot, I said I’d help you out, not that I wouldn’t attack. When I said I would help you out, I mean I’d help you by killing you. You can’t blame your poor comprehension skills on me.” Long Chen shrugged innocently.

“Bastard!”

The Empyrean Winged Blood Devils were infuriated, but with Long Chen blocking the exit and their combat powers suppressed within the channel, they couldn’t get through.

“Guo Ran, has Long Chen taken first place?” Meng Qi saw that Guo Ran was still focusing on the Devil Slaughter Rankings despite being kicked by Tang Wan-er.

“Monstrous.” Guo Ran could only sigh.

“He’s first?” asked Gu Yang.

“No. I’m talking about Leng Yueyan. Her kill points have already surpassed one trillion. Furthermore, after breaking past one trillion, the number representing her kill points became violet-gold and turned to one. Her kill points are going to be measured in the trillions...”

“Then what about boss?”

“Boss? Let me check... Rank thirty-seven.”

“How is that possible? Boss is handling all of them on his own, and he has killed so many. How can his ranking not be in the top ten? Didn’t he take seventh place just before? Are the Devil Slaughter Rankings wrong?” Gu Yang couldn’t believe his ears.

“It’s impossible for the Devil Slaughter Rankings to be wrong. That means the other regions have also started a bloody battle. It’s normal that Long Chen has been surpassed,” said Meng Qi.

“I still don’t get it,” said Gu Yang.

Meng Qi explained, “The Eastern Xuan Region only has Long Chen killing the Empyrean Winged Blood Devils right now, but he has made them too scared to come out. As for the other regions, they won’t just foolishly defend the channel. They’ll retreat to their sects’ strongholds and then use divine items to slaughter them. Even the Southern Xuan Region can do this, as Long Chen only killed most of their junior generation, and their seniors are still alive and well. Although the Illusive Music Immortal Palace said that they would handle it, those sects will still be prepared. After all, this is a major affair. So those disciples in the other regions will mostly retreat as their sects don’t want to see immense casualties amongst their disciples. Only the absolute top experts will remain. Without others to worry about, they can unleash their own ultimate moves or divine items to slaughter the Empyrean Winged Blood Devils. So those top experts are surrounded by a sea of Empyrean Winged Blood Devils, while Long Chen is blocking the channel on his own, not letting them come through. It’s normal that he has been surpassed.”

Only now did everyone understand. The reason he had taken seventh place at the start was because he had struck early. Once the gate was stabilized, the other geniuses had also started attacking. Those geniuses had plenty of enemies to choose from, while Long Chen was blocking the channel, not letting the enemies through. The amount that he was killing was shrinking as they grew more cowed.

“Not good, those bastards are up to something!”

Suddenly, they saw that some ancient Empyrean Winged Blood Devils had appeared. They were forming some kind of formation.

The long-haired man that had spoken to Long Chen was enveloped in that formation, along with thousands of the Empyrean Winged Blood Devils. Suddenly, they vanished.

“They’re using a secret art to directly pass through the gate!” shouted Gu Yang.

Space shook. Long Chen’s divine ring appeared, and he slashed Evilmoon directly where the spatial fluctuations were concentrated. He wanted to annihilate them before they could pass through.

In this instant, space was definitely in disorder. With this attack, Long Chen was confident in at least heavily injuring that long-haired man. He even had a chance of killing him instantly.

However, just as his saber slashed down, his expression changed. The spatial fluctuations vanished.

“Spatial displacement?”

Long Chen was startled and hastily swung his saber behind him. Three thousand meters away, space began to twist once more. The bodies of the long-haired man and the Empyrean Winged Blood Devils had just appeared when Long Chen’s sharp attack mercilessly arrived.

The long-haired man was a bit surprised at Long Chen’s reaction speed. He held a white bone spear, and it unleashed a ray of light. The powerful divine fluctuations showed that it was also a powerful divine weapon.

With an explosive sound, the black saber-image and white light collided. The powerful divine fluctuations struck the Empyrean Winged Blood Devils hard, and the majority were killed. The ones who survived were half-dead and wildly coughed up blood.

Long Chen was stunned by the long-haired man’s power. That white spear had unleashed immense power, and now his arm was a bit numb. It seemed that the long-haired man also specialized in power.

The long-haired man had thought that he would have been able to heavily injure Long Chen with his attack, as Long Chen had been forced to change targets midway, causing his power to drop. However, Long Chen’s attack had been so powerful that the long-haired man had almost lost his grip on his spear. A blood rune appeared on his forehead and spread throughout his body. This was a secret art to raise his power.

“So you have some power. But no matter how strong a pig is, it can’t change its fate of being slaughtered.”

The long-haired man suddenly spread his bat-like wings, and the blood-colored runes surrounding his body exploded, revealing countless divine runes on his wings. Divine light exploded from his wings, and his voice resounded throughout the air.

“The wings of the Empyrean Winged Blood Devils are known as heavenly wings. We are born with the heavenly runes on them. When our wings appear, the Heavenly Daos follow. The land is beneath my feet, the great sea is in my heart, all manifestations of heaven and earth are mine-”

Pow!

Just as the long-haired man’s aura was constantly rising as his voice grew louder, a hand struck his face at a strange angle, interrupting him and sending him flying.

His saber attacked right after, slashing at the long-haired man’s waist. He had slapped him with his left hand and was using his right hand to slash with his saber. It was a seamless combination.

Long Chen’s divine face-slapping art was unique to him and had no match in this world. Whether it was a human or devil, as long as it was their first time encountering it, it would be very difficult for them to dodge. An attack without any killing intent was difficult to sense.

However, if this slap landed, then the killing blow would follow. Just as Evilmoon was about to strike, the runes on his wings lit up, and his body vanished. Long Chen’s saber slashed through empty air.

“Die!”

The long-haired man suddenly appeared behind Long Chen, the white bone spear in his hand whistling toward him.

Long Chen hastily blocked with his saber and was sent flying by the spear. The long-haired man let out a heaven-shaking roar. Clearly, this slap had infuriated him. Based on this, it seemed a face-slap was humiliating to both humans and devils.

All the runes on his wings lit up. The space around him collapsed as a terrifying pressure locked onto Long Chen.

“Die!”

The white bone spear began to rumble, its sound filling heaven and earth. This attack was undodgeable. The long-haired man was completely infuriated now and wanted to kill Long Chen with this move.

“Five Star Battle Armor!”

Long Chen closed his eyes for a moment. When he reopened them, five stars were revolving within them, and the five-point star in his divine ring ignited. A pillar of light soared into the sky.

“You’re the one who’s going to die.” Long Chen felt all his energy erupting out of him. With his Five Star Battle Armor, he slashed his saber at the long-haired man.

When their two divine weapons collided, the Devil Abyss’s land exploded. Huge cracks appeared in every direction. The corpses of the devil creatures on the ground were blown to bits.

“When it comes to power, you... are still lacking!”

The long-haired man was looking at Long Chen. Long Chen shook his head.

BANG!

Long Chen’s foot struck like lightning, landing on the long-haired man’s abdomen. He was sent flying.

Long Chen glanced at how the battlefield had changed since he had become entangled with his opponent. There was an endless tide of Empyrean Winged Blood Devils charging out. They had yet to reach the Dao Sect’s disciples, but those disciples had already formed a tight formation.

These disciples clenched their teeth, ready for their death. There was no way they could survive today. However, even if they had to die, they would draw a few devil creatures down with them.

“Guo Ran, there’s no need to hold back any longer. Please start your show!” called out Long Chen.

“Hahaha, good! Brothers, cheer and shout! The savior always comes at the last moment!” Guo Ran suddenly laughed and charged into the army of Empyrean Winged Blood Devils.
