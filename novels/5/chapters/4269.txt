Chapter 4258 Catching Everything in One Net

Lian Wuying and the others also rushed to the core region. However, they were shocked to find themselves moving very slowly.

It was like they were moving through water, as if their legs were made of lead. All their movements were slow and clumsy.

Moreover, everything around them was slow. Even the sound of breathing was intermittent, sounding very odd.

“What? Did his sword cut the laws of space?!” cried out an innate Heaven Venerate from outside the martial stage.

“It didn’t. If it did, time would already stop in that region. His sword only managed to disturb the flow of space there, and that’s why the time inside the martial stage is flowing differently than outside,” said someone, feeling equally shocked nonetheless.

“To affect the laws of time and space, isn’t that something only Eternal experts can barely accomplish?!”

“That’s what the legends said. But sword cultivators are existences that can break all laws!”

Sword cultivators were truly an inconceivable existence. They couldn’t be judged according to common sense, nor did they fit in the standards of the cultivation world. They were a bunch of existences that broke common sense.

After this one slash, the sword images in Yue Zifeng’s eyes faded, and his complexion turned as pale as paper.

Blood suddenly sprayed out of his mouth. However, he wore a light smile on his face.

“I’ve finally touched that level.”

After saying that, Yue Zifeng’s eyes dimmed and he fell unconscious. That sword contained his full heart and spirit; he hadn’t held back in the slightest.

In the cultivation world, perhaps the only existence capable of unleashing every single trace of their power in one blow would be sword cultivators.

Other than them, no one could break this rule, including Long Chen. He had countless big moves, but not one of those could concentrate every single trace of his energy into one blow.

If such a move existed, his meridians would be shattered and his soul would be exhausted after using it. It would be like a brilliant firework containing his life’s achievement before he faded into eternal darkness.

Only the strongest sword cultivators possessed the ability to concentrate all of their energy into a single, concentrated blow. This was why they were widely acknowledged as the greatest offensive force in the cultivation world. Their superiority in this regard was undisputed.

Long Chen caught Yue Zifeng and sensed his body. He found that Zifeng’s essence, qi, and spirit were in a severe deficit, causing him to pass out. Fortunately, his body was not injured.

“Qingyun, look after Zifeng!”

Long Chen passed Yue Zifeng to Mu Qingyun. At this moment, the flow of time on the martial stage had normalized.

Without delay, Lian Wuying, Long Aotian, Ye Wuchen, and the rest came charging over with their eyes ablaze. After all, the karmic luck bead had exploded, and most of its fragments had been absorbed by the Dragonblood warriors and their allies.

However, there were still many karmic luck runes flying in the air outside the core, so their first target was those runes. After taking them, they would start a slaughter to obtain the rest.

Suddenly, a giant golden net spread through the air, instantly wrapping around all of those runes, provoking Long Aotian and the others. When they looked at the source of the net, they saw a wretched face with a sinister smile.

“Mo Nian!”

The one to cast this net was Mo Nian, who was relaxing on his crystal coffin. He was leisurely pulling in his net, which material remained a mystery, but any runes that touched it were caught, including all the runes that hadn’t been absorbed yet. This was truly catching everything in one net.

Seeing this scene, Long Aotian and the others’ eyes turned red with greed and rage. Previously, when the outer edge of the karmic luck bead had exploded, they hadn’t participated in the fight, fully aware that those were only small fragments. Their true target was the core.

They had thought that the core would need to absorb even more blood soul energy before it could erupt, and the real fight would start then. Thus, they had allowed everyone else to slaughter each other for the leftovers, as it was their blood soul energy that would drive the eruption of the core.

However, they had never expected the circumstances to change because of Yue Zifeng. The karmic luck bead had been destroyed, and over half of its essence was absorbed by Long Chen’s people.

As for the other half, it was now caught by Mo Nian. If Mo Nian really succeeded, then they would have obtained nothing in this Sage King Convention.

“DIE!”

The first to close in on Mo Nian was Yan Wuji, the descendant of the Human Emperor. As he struck, his manifestation abruptly came into being. From it, a majestic figure materialized, unleashing unparalleled emperor might. The heavens and earth seemed to resonate with him as he launched a fist toward Mo Nian.

Yan Wuji was finally panicking. Although he had been chasing after Mo Nian this entire time, he had been conserving his real power to fight for the karmic luck essence.

Now, seeing half of that essence be captured by Mo Nian, he didn’t hold back the slightest. He directly summoned his Human Emperor manifestation.

BOOM!

Yan Wuji had just arrived when a golden figure, radiating an endless dragon might, intercepted him. Long Chen unleashed a powerful punch on his own, resulting in an explosive collision. Yan Wuji’s body then shook intensely and flew back, while Long Chen shot back like he had been struck by a shooting star.

“Good brother! Buy me some time!” shouted Mo Nian as he hastily dragged in the net.

This net was something Mo Nian had prepared as soon as he knew that the karmic luck fragments would appear. It was perfect for gathering karmic luck fragments. However, now he felt a bit regretful.

That was because he had been too greedy. He had drawn so many karmic luck fragments that pulling in the net became extraordinarily taxing. Now that so many people were attacking him, he was nervous.

“Do what you need to do!” Long Chen shouted and shot toward Long Aotian and the others. Raising a hand, Long Chen channeled his thunderforce, and a lightning sphere rapidly grew.

“World Extermination Lightning Radiance!”ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

Long Chen's attacks were executed with remarkable swiftness and precision, all without the need for any hand seals. His ability to unleash such a powerful technique immediately after exchanging blows with Yan Wuji left observers baffled, defying people’s understanding.

A giant sphere of lightning left Long Chen’s hand. It then rapidly grew and exploded amongst Long Aotian and the others.

Wild lightning ravaged them, transforming into a sea of lightning that directly turned many experts into dust.

“Heavens, this is heavenly tribulation lightning! He can actually control heavenly tribulation lightning!”

However, although this lightning was terrifying enough to slaughter Triple Supremes, it was not enough to stop the likes of Long Aotian and Lian Wuying. They directly pierced through the sea of lightning.

“World Extermination Flame Lotus!”

They had barely passed through the sea of lightning when a giant flame lotus smashed toward them, once more devouring them.

After passing through the sea of lightning, they were met by a sea of fire. Although these attacks weren’t strong enough to kill them, under this twisted space, their speed plummeted.

Buzz.

Just then, Mo Nian finally managed to pull in his net and then packed it inside his crystal coffin.

By the time Long Aotian and the others flew through the sea of fire, Mo Nian was already putting away his net. As a result, Long Aotian’s expression instantly changed.

“Long Chen, Mo Nian, I don’t want those karmic luck runes. I just want you both to die in endless pain!” Long Aotian bellowed. Suddenly, his five-colored manifestation became a seven-colored one, and his aura surged exponentially, growing dozens of times.

BOOM!

The void beneath his feet exploded. However, what shocked people was that he didn’t attack Long Chen or Mo Nian. Instead, he charged toward the Dragonblood Legion.

“Kill these people! They just absorbed the runes, and they’ll come out as soon as you kill them!” shouted Lian Wuying.

Following that, everyone on the martial stage charged toward the Dragonblood Legion from all sides. Seeing this scene, Long Chen clenched his fists, his gaze turning ice cold.

All of a sudden, the golden dragon scales on his body seemed to be stimulated and slowly opened, endless power flowing on top of them.

“Cloud Dragon Immolation Claw!”

Long Chen roared, channeling all his strength into his dragon claw. He then plunged it directly through the fabric of space, striking Long Aotian.
