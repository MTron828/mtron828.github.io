Chapter 2814 Dirty Tricks Behind the Exam

Long Chen followed the path and out of nowhere, a strange sound came from the walls. Following that, pellets began to fire.

Long Chen agilely dodged, and the pellets landed on the walls, leaving behind white splotches.

Long Chen instantly understood that this was a test of reaction speed. The mechanisms didn’t contain any killing intent, but they did intentionally cause a noise just as they fired in order to reduce the difficulty.

Long Chen shook his head. This kind of test was far too childish for him. Although his spiritual yuan was sealed, even without using Spiritual Strength, just the change in airflow when these pellets shot out was enough to make him easily dodge them.

The further he went, the more concentrated the pellets. But they were completely unable to touch him. He then passed through the pellet channel, appearing in an exam hall.

The examiner stared at Long Chen in shock. Looking him up and down, the examiner finally proclaimed, “You pass with full marks.”

The passing grade for this exam was based on how many pellets you were hit by. But Long Chen passed through without a single spot of white.

The reason the examiner was shocked was because in this exam, a person’s spiritual perception was suppressed, so they could only use the sound to react.

Getting hit by eight or fewer pellets was a pass. Hence, the examiner was truly stunned and automatically passed Long Chen with full marks.

The next exam was actually a wooden puppet, and Long Chen was given a club. As long as the club struck the wooden puppet, its movements would cease.

However, he would be entering an area with hundreds of those wooden puppets attacking at once. It was an overwhelming situation for most people who took the exam.

After that, Long Chen’s club danced through the air. As the examiner said, once it struck a puppet, the puppet’s movements would come to a stop. The only difficulty was how to avoid getting hit by the wooden puppets in turn. It required not only speed but also sharp perception and the ability to make fast judgments.

Long Chen laughed inside. It seemed that the immortal world was far too peaceful. This kind of trial wasn’t worth anything to an expert like him who had walked out of countless life and death battles.

It was unknown just how many big battles he had fought. He had brushed against death countless times, sharpening his instincts. Even with his spiritual yuan and divine sense suppressed, this trial was too easy for him.

Those puppets quickly fell one by one. The only thing that surprised Long Chen was that these puppets were very sensitive.

Although Long Chen had come into contact with puppets on the Martial Heaven Continent, those were existences powered through formations. Their reactions were not as fast as these puppets, which seemed to possess their own minds.

Long Chen easily passed through this section. When he arrived at the end, the next examiner’s expression was just as amazed as the previous one. Long Chen had once more passed with full marks.

After three trials, he appeared in a hall. This was where all the people who had passed the trials so far were gathered.

The big-chinned man was also here, astonished to see Long Chen arrive here as well. However, he then smiled sinisterly. He lowered his head and whispered to an examiner.

Due to the great distance and his suppressed Spiritual Strength, Long Chen couldn’t hear what he said. But Long Chen knew that he was definitely courting death.

For him to be speaking to the examiner like this, they were clearly on the same side. The examiner eyed Long Chen and didn’t say anything.

This exam quickly started. Of the original thirty-six people, only eight managed to reach this point. These eight people were going to face off in four pairs.

This was going to be a knockout competition. Four people would be knocked out in the first round and after three rounds, the winner would be decided. The ultimate winner would then be qualified to become the battle instructor.

However, the second place in the finals wouldn’t necessarily be rejected. They would be viewed as a candidate to become an instructor. If there was a short supply of instructors, they might be promoted.

Unfortunately, if there were enough instructors, they would be neglected, and after three months, even those qualifications would be stripped away. They would need to take the exam again.

Each person was given a wooden sword that was surprisingly heavy but had special runes on it to soften the blow. They were probably afraid of someone dying.

After that, the examiner woodenly read off the rules for the competition. The general meaning was that it was not permitted to take another person’s life during the trial. If someone intentionally killed someone, they would be severely punished.

He also made clear the difference between first place and second place, encouraging everyone to do their best to win.

There were two ways to admit defeat during battle. One was to speak and say that they admitted defeat, while another was to raise both hands. Once this method was used, the examiner would announce the end of the battle.

If you were to intentionally injure someone after the examiner had announced that the battle was over, that would be an automatic loss.

After a mass of rules were read off, they split up. Long Chen was surprised to see that his opponent wasn’t the fellow with the big chin.

Long Chen was confused, but the man facing the big-chinned fellow furiously cursed, “What blatant cheating! According to the sequence, I shouldn’t be facing him in the first round!”

“What nonsense are you spouting? These matches were determined by drawing lots. If you don’t like it, you can withdraw from this competition and wait for the next exam,” said the examiner coldly.

“Drawing lots? How come none of us knew that? You arranged it yourselves just so that I wouldn’t enter the finals! You’re absolutely shameless! The competition in the God Institute should be aboveboard, but you’re just acting like petty, despicable people abusing your positions. You’re disgracing the God Institute with your presence,” cursed that person.

Long Chen understood now. The two of them must have had previous hostility between them. That meant that this big-chinned fellow didn’t just want first place, but he also wanted to knock out this person so that the latter couldn’t even get second. He wanted to kick him out in the first round.

“The Pill Institute is trash, and now the God Institute is also full of corruption. Could it be that I am the only pure one in this world?” Long Chen shook his head. This academy was full of chaos.

“Shut up! You’re the one who isn’t strong enough. Scram, or in a bit, I’ll beat you up like a dog!” sneered the big-chinned fellow fearlessly.

“Alright! Just wait, we’ll meet again.” The man clenched his teeth and directly gave up. He knew that he wasn’t a match for the big-chinned fellow.

Only then did the big-chinned fellow turn his attention to Long Chen. “Brat, there’s still time for you to scram.”

Long Chen ignored him and looked at his opponent. The opponent in front of him was covered in cold sweat, his face pale. “I admit defeat.”

This result was surprising to everyone. Furthermore, in the second round, Long Chen’s opponent also directly admitted defeat, and the same thing happened to the big-chinned fellow.

Following this, the only fight left was between Long Chen and the big-chinned fellow. Even the man who had left angrily and the other examiners came to watch.

“Brat, you used money to buy them, didn’t you? Hehe, the Pill Institute’s disciples really do have money. Too bad that you can’t buy me. I’ll knock your teeth out.” The big-chinned fellow smiled sinisterly. Stamping on the ground, he charged head-on at Long Chen, slashing his sword at Long Chen’s head.

“Your chin is ugly to me. However, my mood is good, so I’ll fix it for you.”

Long Chen’s sword whipped out like a bolt of lightning, knocking his sword aside. It then snaked out, striking his opponent’s big chin.

After that, the sound of bones breaking raised goosebumps. His chin was smashed apart by Long Chen’s sword.
