Chapter 4494 The Enemy of my Enemy is Still my Enemy

“Race leader!” cried out the rest of the nether dragons. Their race leader had slain a core elder of their race.

They stared at Long Chen in shock. His aura had undergone a profound transformation, leading them to believe that the race leader had indeed succeeded in his possession.

However, their race leader had failed to possess Long Chen. Instead, he had sent Long Chen a gift, causing his power to soar.

“You said that you had ten thousand ways to make me live a life worse than death? And what are those?” Long Chen sneered at that corpse.

When Long Chen was captured, this person had been the most arrogant, constantly threatening him. Thus, seeing him kowtow in front of him, Long Chen instinctively killed him.

Long Chen was now completely different from before. His dragon blood, seven-color Supreme Blood, and violet blood responded instantly to his will, activating without any prior warning. Even Eternal experts had no chance of defending against these powers unless they remained vigilant.

Most importantly, when Long Chen’s dragon blood power erupted, this core elder of the nether dragon race didn’t even sense anything before he was dead.

As an Eternal expert, he actually didn’t sense any danger before being slain. That was proof that Long Chen’s dragon blood power could erupt at a terrifying speed.

“You… you… you’re not the race leader!”

“Of course I’m not. I am Long Chen. I was worried about not being able to find your hive, but you’ve saved me the trouble. Now, I will clean up the dregs of the dragon race.”

Long Chen’s voice echoed throughout heaven and earth, shaking the world. After that, a terrifying dragon will erupted, leaving the nether dragon race’s experts dazed.

Just then, rumbling rang out in the distance. Long Chen sneered.

“Does your nether dragon race have some reinforcements? Come out. Let’s see who fears whom.”

Long Chen gazed into the distance, observing an approaching army of experts. The air was thick with terrifying auras, and among them were several Saints.

However, Long Chen was not afraid. He was no longer the person he used to be, and even in the face of Saints, he stood undaunted.

Surprisingly, the nether dragon race did not express joy at the sight of these experts. Instead, an air of fear enveloped them.

“Old man, what are you up to? Our five great alliances will fight to the death with you today! Reveal yourselves!”

A resounding howl echoed, accompanied by the oppressive pressure of a Saint.

Five figures then came flying out from different directions. However, when they arrived at the nether dragon race’s ancestral lands, they came to a baffled stop.

“Isn’t he the High Firmament Academy’s Dean Long Chen?”

“The human race’s Sage King?”

“He really is here. So, was the news that the nether dragon race sent out true? Did they really capture Long Chen? Have they reclaimed their Ten Thousand Dragon Nest?”

Those five Saints’ expressions completely changed. They had fought with the nether dragon race leader many times, and even their combined strength barely allowed them to contend with him. They heavily relied on their disciples to gradually eliminate the remaining forces of the nether dragon race.

If the nether dragon race leader had reclaimed the Ten Thousand Dragon Nest, the five of them combined wouldn't be able to match him. Hence, they were perplexed to find Long Chen here.

“No, the atmosphere is off!” said one of the Saints. There was a corpse lying in front of Long Chen, and the nether dragon race’s experts were staring at him in terror.

“Where is the old man?” The five of them cried out in unison. After arriving here, they realized they couldn’t even sense a trace of the nether dragon race leader’s aura.

Seeing this, Long Chen instantly realized that they were the mortal enemies of the nether dragon race. The nether dragon race had deliberately circulated information about capturing Long Chen to intimidate their enemies, but they hadn’t expected it to provoke their enemies into attacking.

The race leader had overestimated the intelligence of his enemies. Upon releasing this news, he had attached photographic jades as evidence for Long Chen’s capture. The intention was to instill terror, leading them to convene for a discussion rather than launching an impulsive attack.

However, his enemies somehow assumed that the race leader was releasing fake news and had found a fake Long Chen to trick them and get some breathing room.

After all, the Long Chen in the photographic jade lacked any trace of his usual aura, and his expression was completely apathetic, without the slightest fear. He didn’t seem like someone on the verge of death at all.

Thus, after receiving those photographic jades, they assumed that the nether dragon race was trying to trick them, so they believed that launching an attack immediately would be the most opportune course of action.

However, upon their arrival, they ended up seeing the real Long Chen. Dumbfounded, they were staring at him in confusion, not knowing what they should do.

“This is my business with the nether dragon race. I don’t want others to interfere. Scram!” shouted Long Chen.

When a lightning sphere appeared in Long Chen’s hand, tribulation clouds covered the sky, plunging the world into instant darkness. Within the tribulation clouds, an endless cascade of lightning surged, making Long Chen look like a god of lightning who commanded the heavenly lightning of this realm.

Following that, the energy within the tribulation clouds was sucked by the lightning sphere in Long Chen’s hand, causing it to expand at an astonishing rate.Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

The surrounding experts’ expressions changed as the power contained within that sphere induced a sense of danger even in Saints.

Long Chen’s words were devoid of courtesy because these experts were also not good people—they were bloodthirsty members of beast races, enemies of the human race.

For them to attack the nether dragon race, it was like dogs attacking dogs, so it was a good thing for Long Chen.

However, in the end, the nether dragon race was the traitor of the dragon race. As the mysterious dragon expert had passed down the Dragon Soul Body Forging Art to Long Chen, he had a duty to clean up the trash of the dragon race.

“What an arrogant brat!”

Gradually, those Saints recovered from their shock, and it transformed into anger. Long Chen seemed to completely look down on them. Did he just tell them to scram?

Yet, for their people’s safety, they gestured for them to retreat while the formidable experts held their ground.

“Run!”

However, once those people left, leaving only the nether dragon race’s experts present, the nether dragon experts saw the slightest glimmer of light. This was their best chance to escape.

Yet, just as they moved, Long Chen’s enormous lightning sphere exploded. Lightning instantly covered this entire space, covering all the nether dragon race’s experts, as well as those five Saints.
