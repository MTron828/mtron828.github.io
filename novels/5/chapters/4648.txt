Chapter 4637 Parasitic Art

“Yan Hong!”

At the sight of this figure, Long Chen’s eyes widened in disbelief, nearly popping out of their sockets. That person looked identical to Yan Hong, Yan Xu’s son whom he had killed in the past.

“What is going on?” asked Long Chen, unable to comprehend how Yan Hong could be here.

“It’s nothing to be surprised about. The Yan Xu line is one of the strongest flame spirits in existence. While they may not rival the indestructibility of the Three-Headed Heaven Devouring Beast race, they possess a formidable reincarnation ability. After Yan Hong died, his will entered the cycle of rebirth. It just so happened that he latched onto this Yan Xu Divine Lotus as the foundation for his rebirth. If you wish to view it this way, you can say that he has already reincarnated,” explained the Earth Cauldron.

“So that’s the case.”

Long Chen was amazed. The Yan Xu lineage truly stood as the pinnacle of flame entities in the nine heavens and ten lands. Now, Long Chen understood why Yan Hong possessed such extraordinary capabilities.

“Hehe, I killed you in your last life, and now that you’ve reincarnated, you still fall into my hands.” Long Chen suddenly smiled sinisterly as he stared at Yan Hong.

“Don’t mess around. The Yan Xu Divine Lotus is rebuilding his body, so their souls are linked. If you kill him, it will definitely wake up this slumbering lotus,” warned the Earth Cauldron.

“Are you saying that this Yan Xu Divine Lotus will be Yan Hong’s protector even in the future?” asked Long Chen.

“Indeed. One could say he has turned his demise into a boon. This lotus will become his new manifestation, and their powers will grow together,” replied the Earth Cauldron.

“Damn, what kind of dogshit luck is this?!” Long Chen cursed. “No, I can’t let this continue!”

Long Chen stealthily got closer to Yan Hong and sensed that the latter’s spiritual fluctuations were nonexistent, as if he was dead. Long Chen knew that this was the result of his soul merging with the Yan Xu Divine Lotus. Together, they were in slumber.

“Huo Linger, come over here. Don’t absorb the leftover trash.” Long Chen called Huo Linger over and pointed at Yan Hong. “The Yan Xu Flame’s essence is right there. See if you can take it from him without waking him up.”

“I’ll try it!”

When Huo Linger heard that proposal, her eyes lit up. A tiny black flame dragon the size of an earthworm then came out of her hand.

This tiny dragon was condensed of the purest Yan Xu energy she had refined, so its fluctuations were similar to Yan Hong’s.

It slowly crawled on top of Yan Hong’s arm. The moment it came into contact with him, Yan Hong shook ever so slightly, causing Long Chen and Huo Linger to jump in horror. Fortunately, he only shook ever so slightly in his sleep. Perhaps he had a nightmare or something.

After a moment of observation, Huo Linger directed the black flame dragon to envelop him. In the end, it settled like a tattoo on his arm.

“It’s done!” Huo Linger exclaimed with delight. Yan Hong’s body consisted of the purest Yan Xu Flame, providing her with the optimal source to absorb Yan Xu energy.

“Don’t get too excited. Keep sending out more of those flame dragons, the more the better. Once they’ve feasted enough on him, we’ll take them all back,” instructed Long Chen.

“Alright.” Huo Linger quickly acted as Long Chen said and sent a second black flame dragon out. This one had the exact same energy as Yan Hong, so when it landed on Yan Hong, he didn’t react at all.

Just like that, Huo Linger sent one black flame dragon after another until there were over ten thousand of them around Yan Hong.

Among them, one was placed between Yan Hong’s eyebrows, bearing her unique spiritual seal. It could be regarded as one of her clones.

In this manner, as the flame dragons fed off Yan Hong’s essence, Huo Linger would instantly detect when they were full, and she could retract their energy at will.

As this parasitism didn’t threaten Yan Hong’s life, the lotus didn’t react at all. With this, even if Yan Hong woke up, he wouldn’t even know what had happened to him.

After arranging this scheme, Long Chen and Huo Linger stealthily slipped out of the lotus and returned to the Dragonblood Legion.

The Dragonblood warriors were now in their top condition. Having consumed the Heavenly Doyen Fruits from Long Chen, they had all become seven-star Doyens.

With the Dragonblood warriors’ power and comprehension abilities, giving them the Heavenly Doyen Fruits was like adding wings to tigers.

The original owners of these seven-star Heavenly Doyen Fruits were not that powerful. However, the Heavenly Doyen Fruits produced after their deaths unleashed a terrifying effect when used on the Dragonblood Legion.

The Dragonblood warriors experienced the surge of this formidable Doyen power coursing through them. Gritting their teeth, they lamented not possessing this power during their confrontation with the Celestial race. With this power, they wouldn’t have been forced into such a terrible state.

“Let’s go.” Long Chen waved his hand. The Earth Cauldron then appeared and smashed the void, forming a giant vortex.

Stepping into it, they found themselves in front of a giant spatial gate.

This gate was precisely the one they had been forced through to enter the Yan Xu World. However, upon their return, they discovered that the battlefield surrounding the gate was deserted, unlike when Long Chen had entered.

After learning of their squad’s demise, the Celestial race sent out some reinforcements. Unfortunately, by the time they arrived, Long Chen had entered the Yan Xu Gate.

It had already been several days since he had entered the Yan Xu World. Those people had cleaned up the battlefield and simply left. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

“Let’s go find the Celestial race. Our Dragonblood Legion will not stop until they are wiped out,” declared Long Chen coldly.

The Celestial race had really gone too far this time, so Long Chen would not let this matter rest here.

“Boss, there’s no rush. While we were evading their pursuit, I found a treasure land. We should go there first,” urged Guo Ran hastily.

“What treasure land?” asked Long Chen in surprise.

...

Long Chen arrived at the treasure land Guo Ran had indicated. It was an endless mountain range covered in immortal mist.

Within this mist, Long Chen could hear loud explosive sounds, and it was vaguely possible to see some dust and smoke from a mountain exploding within the mist.

“Not good, someone’s already starting to mine my immortal ores!” exclaimed Guo Ran. Seeing this scene, Xia Chen and Guo Ran were enraged and hastily flew toward the mountain range.

Trailing behind Xia Chen and Guo Ran, they soon caught sight of numerous figures ahead. As their gaze fell upon a huge flag planted atop a mountain peak, the Dragonblood warriors’ eyes immediately went blood red.
