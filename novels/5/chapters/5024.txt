Chapter 5013 Personally Presiding Over

Long Chen looked at the dragon rune on his palm. While it slowly faded away, his excitement persisted. The fusion of the cross and the dragon diagram had transformed this move into something greater than the God Slaying Cross.

Behind both diagrams lay a rune, faint yet evoking a familiar aura. It was somewhat similar to the aura of Sovereign Yun Shang and the other Sovereigns from the mortal world.

“There are things you have to understand on your own. I needn’t elaborate much, and it’s not convenient to do so either. By condensing the Sovereign Blood Seal, you are now closer to that fellow. In order to help you last time, it expended a great deal of power. Due to some reasons, it is in quite the predicament now. You should properly nourish this Sovereign Blood Seal—it’s your only way to help that fellow awaken sooner,” advised the Earth Cauldron.

Long Chen’s heart quivered. The dragon expert had rescued him from crises multiple times, but their connection had abruptly ceased after their last encounter.

He had never understood why the dragon expert had stopped communicating with him. Now, according to the Earth Cauldron, it was because the dragon expert had paid a hefty price to aid him across space.

For the Earth Cauldron to use the word “awaken” showed the severity of the problem. The dragon expert might not formally be Long Chen’s master, but they truly did have such a relationship. The dragon expert had been the greatest benefactor on his cultivation journey.

These revelations stirred a whirlwind of emotions within Long Chen. He hadn’t expected the dragon expert to fall into a predicament to help him.

“How can I help it?” asked Long Chen urgently.

“In truth, there are certain things I’m reluctant to say. If that fellow were to learn of it, it would definitely criticize me for being too loose-lipped. Moreover, you’re quite impatient. It took me a long time to reveal even this much to you. Patience is key here. First, you must master the dragon blood God Slaying Cross. When you can use it naturally and your eighth star has condensed, you can use the power of the stars to support the Sovereign Blood Seal. When your Sovereign Blood Seal is strong enough, you will be able to communicate with that fellow again. Let me put it to you this way: its situation is far more dire than mine was when you first encountered me.”

Long Chen was once more shaken. When he first encountered the Earth Cauldron, the dragon expert had also been astonished and had urged Long Chen to acquire it at any cost.

Back then, the Earth Cauldron had been in a deep slumber, its body covered in rust. It was practically rotting away. But it now claimed that the dragon expert’s situation was even more dire?

Suddenly, Long Chen thought about how the dragon expert had first helped him. It had proposed a pact: saving Long Chen’s life in exchange for Long Chen eventually repaying the debt by saving its life.

However, over the years, the dragon expert had only assisted Long Chen and never once asked for repayment. Now understanding the severity of its predicament, Long Chen was overcome with guilt.

“That’s enough. You just need to remember this in your heart. You might want to rush, but take this one step at a time. Right now, you just need to improve your control over the God Slaying Cross. The more familiar you are with it, the better. It would be best if you could reach a high level of control over it. It will be very beneficial for when you cultivate the true God Slaying Cross,” advised the Earth Cauldron.

“What counts as a high level of control?” asked Long Chen.

“Let me put it to you this way. Your God Slaying Cross exhausts all your bloodline power at once, correct?”

“Yes, that’s exactly it.”

“Then at a high level of control, you will be able to unleash the God Slaying Cross a hundred times with your bloodline power.”

“A hundred times?!” Long Chen exclaimed. Was that even possible? Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

“Yes, a hundred times. I know it sounds very difficult, but there’s no way around it. The nine star line’s divine abilities are famous for being monstrous. They pose difficulties that can drive people to despair. If you cannot reach this level, the Star Ocean’s power will not work for you. It is far more violent than the dragon blood power, capable of instantly blowing you up. Even during the peak of the nine star line, when its disciples were as numerous as grains of sand in a river, those who mastered the God Slaying Cross were esteemed as elites among elites. Control is the crux; it’s like opening a sluice gate in a dam. Right now, you have no sluice gate, so every time you release your power, the dam directly collapses. This wastes far too much power, and it is not concentrated enough, reducing its effectiveness. Moreover, such reckless attacks harm both you and your foe. Despite your resilience and the healing power of the primal chaos space, it’s unsustainable for the long run.”

“I’ll listen to you and take it slowly,” said Long Chen as he nodded. “Speaking of which, Senior, how are things on your end?”

“Hehe, what do you think?” The Earth Cauldron chuckled.

Long Chen was taken aback. He suddenly recalled how the Earth Cauldron had rarely been able to assist him directly, often relying on others striking it to trigger a backlash.

However, just now, it had silently withstood Long Chen’s God Slaying Cross. It was an immense transformation.

“Hehe, excellent! It was the right decision to come all this way. We’ve really profited.” Long Chen also chuckled.

After their conversation, Long Chen refocused on mastering the God Slaying Cross. He needed to tame the dragon blood’s volatile power, controlling its output meticulously.

However, the dragon blood was innately violent, and bending it to his will demanded even greater Spiritual Strength.

Fortunately, Long Chen’s Spiritual Strength was as vast as the sea. Previously idle, it now found a purpose.

At this moment, Long Chen took this task very seriously, as he understood its importance to him and the dragon expert. He felt guilty for being unable to repay the dragon expert’s kindness, and this drove him to redouble his efforts to become stronger.

As time passed, Long Chen’s control over the dragon blood grew smoother, tempered by his vast reservoir of Spiritual Strength.

When Long Chen’s Spiritual Strength merged with his dragon blood, it not only restrained the explosive force but also preserved its essence.

Several days later, Long Chen could control his dragon blood power to the point of being able to release the God Slaying Cross three times in a row. To his surprise, each strike carried no less power than when he unleashed all his might at once. In fact, due to it concentrated in one spot, its destructive power was even greater.

Even the Earth Cauldron praised Long Chen’s rapid progress. In just a matter of days, he could already unleash it ten times in succession, slowly grasping the trick to control it. However, before he could aim for a hundred times in a row, he was interrupted.

“Great Head Umpire, today is the day for selecting the top thirty-two. You must preside over the proceedings personally,” a voice echoed from outside.
