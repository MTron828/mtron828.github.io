Chapter 2750 Immortal Corpse

A wailing sound rang out as heaven and earth were unable to bear the pressure of the nine dragons. As a result, the ancestral lands of the divine families began to fracture; their experts fled for their lives.

As for Long Aotian, he had activated his newly condensed Emperor blood to unleash this terrifying attack.

BOOM!

With Long Chen at the core, the ancestral lands collapsed. The bricks and formations laid on them turned to dust.

Even before the attack arrived, the Emperor’s pressure had crashed down. The space around Long Chen twisted and turned. In the face of this terrifying attack, even the spatial wall of this world was as flimsy as paper. One wrong move and Long Chen would be sucked into the chaotic flow of space, forever vanishing from this world.

“All cultivation techniques are garbage in front of the Nine Star Hegemon Body Art. My star diagram has already awakened. Even if you had become a real Emperor, would you be able to do anything to me?”

A dragon roar suddenly rang out from within Long Chen’s body. White dragon scales covered his skin.

BOOM!

The nine dragons crashed down upon his body. As a result, Long Chen’s scales instantly became covered in tiny cracks.

Long Aotian sneered, “Your azure dragon essence blood has been sucked away by me, and my nine ancestral dragon souls have grown stronger once more. As for you, you will die at my hands!”

Long Chen suddenly recalled that his essence blood had been almost sucked dry by the Heaven Executioner. So it had been absorbed by Long Aotian.

His current Azure Dragon Battle Armor didn’t have the essence blood to back it, causing its power to drop. On the other hand, Long Aotian’s dragon might had increased.

Long Chen snorted. All of a sudden, a star condensed within every single one of his scales. Originally, his 108,000 stars matched his 108,000 scales. Now that there was one star fewer, the stars moved around his scales, linking together with his divine ring and forming a layer of divine light around his body.

The nine dragons crashed into this layer of divine light but were unable to break it. Long Aotian was startled; his dragons began to claw at the light. Although the surrounding space repeatedly exploded, the dragons were unable to break Long Chen’s defenses.

Long Aotian then grew crazy with rage. This technique was something he was only capable of using by sacrificing his new Emperor blood. It had the power to destroy heaven and earth, but it couldn’t destroy Long Chen’s defenses. This fact was almost enough to cause despair.

“It seems that I was treating the Nine Star Hegemon Body Art too shallowly. It is not just a cultivation technique; it can almost manifest as any magical art. Mastering this one technique is mastering ten thousand techniques. The different manifestations are changed with the heart.”

Long Chen was wrapped in a new comprehension of the Nine Star Hegemon Body Art. The power of his stars could transform into anything. They even manifested themselves within his scales.

Ever since the Heaven Executioner had crushed one of his stars, he had kept an eye on their changes, but he was unable to see any pattern.

Right now, he had yet to fully understand how to use his star diagram. But the more he used the power of his stars, the more he understood.

“It can defend on defense, and attack on offense.”

Long Chen suddenly unleashed a punch, and his star diagram appeared on his fist.

The dragon he struck exploded. After that, starlight filled the air, illuminating the heavens.

With one dragon destroyed, the other eight shuddered and merged into one. Long Aotian’s figure reappeared, and he coughed up a mouthful of blood.

His Nine Dragons Slaughter had been defeated, so he was filled with shock. His power contained this world’s strongest laws, but Long Chen’s power was not affected by any of the restrictions of the laws. That was a different and terrifying power.

As the star diagram in Long Chen’s divine ring circulated, Long Chen stepped in the air and shot toward the shocked Long Aotian. The void shuddered in his wake.

In return, Long Aotian roared and his dragon spear erupted with light. His manifestation rumbled.

Facing this attack, Long Chen stamped a foot at Long Aotian, and his star diagram appeared on his foot like a river of stars. His foot then smashed into the dragon spear, and Long Aotian let out a muffled grunt as he was kicked into the earth.

The earth exploded, unleashing a wild gale. The surrounding mountains and buildings were torn apart by that wind.

“Are you a Saint? Or a Skank?” Long Chen sneered. After awakening the power of his stars, he was gradually sensing just how terrifying the Nine Star Hegemon Body Art was. This power should be described as practically dreadful. It surpassed the power of an entire world.

With this kind of power, there was no need to cultivate any magical arts or Battle Skills. Just the power of his stars would be enough to flatten anyone. This power came from the self and was not limited by any laws. As long as his astral power was strong enough, even a god or immortal could be slain.

Right now, Long Aotian was being completely crushed. The two of them were not even on the same level. The divine families’ experts were all dumbfounded. Just what had Long Chen gone through in order to become such a monster?

Suddenly, strange cracking sounds rang out. Everyone’s expressions changed as they saw the foundation of the ancestral palace begin to crack. Those cracks rapidly spread far into the distance.

“Not good. The core of this world is breaking!” A startled cry rang out. Once the core was destroyed, this world would also disappear.

“No, this aura is…”

Rays of immortal light began to appear from within the cracks. Immortal mist flooded this world.

“The Immortal Sealing Palace has been opened!” Several of the elders’ expressions changed.

The Immortal Sealing Palace was forbidden territory in the divine families. It was an absolute secret known only to a select few. Other than the Saints, those qualified to know of its existence did not number more than ten. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

Theoretically, with the death of the Saints at Long Chen’s hand, the Immortal Sealing Palace should have remained hidden forever. Unexpectedly, Long Chen’s attack had caused it to rise.

Immortal qi gushed out of the cracks, and a grand majestic palace gradually rose out of the ground.

Long Aotian stood on top of the immortal palace, covered in blood. His shocked expression showed that he clearly didn’t know about this palace either.

He had been kicked deep underground by Long Chen and inadvertently crashed into the Immortal Sealing Palace. His blood had caused it to activate.

“This thing doesn’t belong to this world. It’s incredibly heretical. Long Chen, you have to be careful,” transmitted the Eastern Wasteland Bell. The Eastern Wasteland Bell sensed just how strange this palace was.

“It looks like immortal qi, but it’s actually dark ghost qi. There’s definitely nothing good inside.” Long Chen nodded. This Immortal Sealing Palace was extremely strange. He sensed it as well.

However, he wasn’t afraid. The more secrets of the divine families that he unearthed, the better it would be for him. It wasn’t the opponents that you could see that were frightening. What was frightening was the unknown.

Suddenly, the gates to the palace opened and an elder wearing odd robes walked out.

“It’s an immortal corpse!” exclaimed the Eastern Wasteland Bell.
