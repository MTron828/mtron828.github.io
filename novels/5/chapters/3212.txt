Chapter 3201 An Expert From Outside

He was a large expert with strange clothes and a heavy rod in his hand. He was in the mid Four Peak realm.

This person was blocked by the academy’s disciples outside the mountain gates. He was shouting, but he didn’t make a move.

“I’ve already told you many times, senior apprentice-brother Long Chen isn’t inside the academy. We’ll tell you when he gets back. If you disturb fairy Shishi with your shouting and get crushed by her, don’t blame us then!” responded those disciples.

“Bullshit! I’ve waited two days! I came from outside this domain and passed through the devil sea just to fight Long Chen! What? Does he not dare to come out?!” roared that expert.

“I’m telling you, senior apprentice-brother Long Chen isn’t here! He just went out when you came! Furthermore, do you think that he would be afraid of you considering his power? Why would we have to lie to you…? Eh, isn’t that senior apprentice-brother Long Chen?” Just then, that disciple noticed Long Chen and the others walking over.

That large man turned to look at Long Chen. His eyes shone brightly with four colors as he shouted, “Long Chen, I came to challenge you to a fight! Do you dare to accept?”

“You are from outside this domain?” Long Chen cocked his head at him curiously.

“Correct! My surname is Xu and my name is Zixiong! I am from the Heavenly Star Domain! I crossed the devil sea to come to the Dao Dawn Domain just to fight you! Do you dare to accept?” shouted the one who called himself Xu Zixiong.

Long Chen crossed his arms in front of his chest and shook his head. “I dislike such senseless challenges. Even if you win, what will it prove?”

“As a cultivator, you must fight against powerful enemies! You cannot cower! Turn every expert into a whetstone for yourself, constantly training so you can become a true expert!” declared Xu Zixiong arrogantly.

“Have you reached the point where you have no more opponents in the Heavenly Star Domain?” asked Long Chen.

“Ah… no.” Xu Zixiong deflated.

Long Chen rolled his eyes. “Then is something wrong with your head? You have so many experts to challenge in your domain, so why did you come here? Did you think that I’m a soft persimmon that will be easier to crush? So you can find a sense of existence for yourself?”

Qin Feng and the others also laughed. This fellow’s aura truly was powerful, but it seemed that his head wasn’t very good.

At the very least, he was still waiting at the gates obediently. Even if he was getting impatient, he didn’t charge in or injure others.

“Who cares about all that? I’m already here! Do you dare to accept my challenge?!” shouted Xu Zixiong, directly throwing away any sense of logic.

“I’m going to say something that you won't like to hear. You aren’t a match for my boss. How about I accompany you for a few exchanges?” said Qin Feng, stepping forward. He knew that his boss disdained fighting someone like this.

Let alone Long Chen, even Qin Feng disliked such a challenge. It was only done by people who had nothing better to do. However, this person had come from so far away. If Qin Feng didn’t give him a little taste, he’d feel bad.

“You? Are you looking down on me? I’m challenging him!” raged Xu Zixiong. He viewed it as an insult that Long Chen wouldn’t accept his challenge.

Qin Feng didn’t bother wasting more words with this foolish fellow and appeared right in front of him. Before he could react, Qin Feng’s palm landed on his chest.

As a result, Xu Zixiong was sent flying away from the entrance like a shooting star. Xu Zixiong was shocked by Qin Feng’s speed. Qin Feng had already had mercy on him. If Qin Feng had wanted to kill, he would have directly attacked his vitals, and this guy would already be dead.

Just this one shove was enough for everyone to see that Xu Zixiong was raised pampered, someone who didn’t know how high the heavens were.

Xu Zixiong stabilized himself in the distance, and his expression changed. He hadn’t expected Qin Feng to be so powerful. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

“That doesn’t count! I wasn’t ready! We’re starting over. Take my rod!” Xu Zixiong’s manifestation appeared and his primal bloodline raged.

However, just as he raised his rod, his expression changed once again. Now, a blade was pressed up against his neck.

Xu Zixiong hadn’t even managed to unleash his attack before Qin Feng grasped his weakness. Qin Feng himself was speechless. Was there really such a weak Primal in this world? He saw countless fatal openings in his moves just now.

“Can you tell me how you managed to live for so long?” Qin Feng looked at him oddly.

“This… this doesn’t count! I wasn’t ready!” Xu Zixiong’s expression grew exceedingly unsightly.

“Alright. I’ll give you one more chance so that you’re fully convinced.” Qin Feng retreated and pointed his saber at Xu Zixiong.

Just as Qin Feng retreated, Xu Zixiong smashed his rod and directly stole the initiative. It was a bit contemptible.

However, when his rod smashed down, it was sent flying out of his grasp. He coughed up blood, also flying back.

“Inadequate technique, inadequate power. Are you convinced now?” Qin Feng put away his saber, shaking his head. Even he felt that this was a completely meaningless one-sided battle.

Xu Zixiong was shocked and angered. Looking at his bleeding hand to Qin Feng who hadn’t even summoned his manifestation, he almost couldn’t believe it.

“You have the Barbarian race’s bloodline?”

Suddenly, Long Chen looked at Xu Zixiong closely. He saw brightly colored granules in Xu Zixiong’s fresh blood. That was the mark of the Barbarian race.

Wilde’s blood also had such a thing. Those granules had transformed into runes in the final battle of the Martial Heaven Continent. They had linked together like chains.

However, in comparison, this Xu Zixiong had very few granules in his blood. But Long Chen couldn’t be mistaken about that aura.

“I… My ancestors were from a branch of the Barbarian race, but their bloodline has almost been erased over time,” said Xu Zixiong. He no longer had any of his previous arrogance and obediently answered.

“The Heavenly Star Domain has the Barbarian race within it?” asked Long Chen. If he could find the Barbarian race, perhaps he could find Wilde.

“The Heavenly Star Domain doesn’t contain the Barbarian race, only some descendants from one of their branches. The true Barbarian race is in the Desolate Domain,” answered Xu Zixiong.

“You’re only descended from a branch, and your bloodline was almost severed, but you still managed to awaken a primal bloodline? That’s hard to believe.” Long Chen instantly grew curious. This was a rarely seen regression to an ancestral state.

“Yes, my father, the emperor, also said the same thing. He said that I can definitely become a supreme expert.” Xu Zixiong once more became arrogant. This bloodline of his was his greatest pride.

“You’re even from their Emperor race?”

“Of course! I am the prince of one of the Heavenly Star Domain’s mighty five Emperors- hey, where are you going?” Long Chen and the others directly began walking away when Xu Zixiong’s story reached this point.

“Stop bragging. Due to that trace of the Barbarian race’s bloodline, I can accept you as a little brother. But if you think that you’re some prince, you can scram. Go back to where you came from.” Long Chen’s voice rang out from a distance.

Xu Zixiong was silent for a moment. He then suddenly jumped and chased after them.

“Wait for me! I’m willing to follow you!”
