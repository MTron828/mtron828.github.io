Chapter 2161 Charging Out of the Blockade

“You are no longer the Pill Fairy. In the Brahma Divine Palace, I didn’t kill you. I’ve already returned your kindness from back in the day. If you block my path now, stopping me from saving my old sect, I won’t show any mercy.” Long Chen’s expression was calm, but his eyes were filled with killing intent. The current Pill Fairy was no longer the kind Pill Fairy he had known. She was now a fully devoted disciple of a god.

“I don’t need your mercy.”

The Pill Fairy waved a hand. The Brahma Divine Diagram filled the sky, and Long Chen’s expression changed. The Pill Fairy was now a divine daughter and possessed a trace of her god’s power. Using that power to activate the Brahma Divine Diagram allowed it to unleash its full potential. The Brahma Divine Diagram was actually swallowing this entire space into it.

Once sucked in, even if Long Chen could escape, it would take a huge amount of time and energy.

Space began to collapse as it was thrown into the diagram. Long Chen repeatedly dodged.

Twang.

Suddenly, a light sound rang out. A giant ancient zither appeared, creating a space devoid of the Brahma Divine Diagram.

“The Seven String Sea Suppressing Zither!”

An elegant figure appeared standing above the zither. It was the Zither Fairy, Zi Yan.

“Long Chen, go. Leave her to me.” Zi Yan sent a message to Long Chen.

He hadn’t expected Zi Yan to appear now. He didn’t know if she had just arrived or if she had been here the whole time, but he didn’t have time to ask.

“Many thanks.” Long Chen shot away. He wanted to get to the Xuantian Dao Sect as fast as possible. If his guess was correct, the Xuantian Dao Sect was currently facing an attack.

“Do you think you can leave?” The Pill Fairy’s expression changed. The Brahma Divine Diagram once more began to tremble and spread around the sky.

Zi Yan also made a move, forming hand seals. Four sounds rang out from the giant zither, stopping the Brahma Divine Diagram from spreading any further. Every sound was louder than the last, and within them, the sound of heaven collapsing and a furious sea could be heard.

“Zither Fairy, what are you doing? You want to be enemies with Pill Valley?!” demanded the Pill Fairy. Flame runes began to surge in her eyes, and fluctuations covered her body. A scorching heat began to twist the space around him.

“I have no intentions of being enemies with anyone. But if someone wants to be enemies with Long Chen, I have no choice but to take action,” said Zi Yan calmly.

These two fairies were both peerless beauties. One had Pill Valley’s Brahma Divine Diagram, while one had the Illusive Music Immortal Palace’s Seven String Sea Suppressing Zither. The two of them were now facing each other because of a man.

“Double Dragon Destruction!” Just at this moment, two giant dragons exploded like suns. The experts blocking Long Chen were devoured by a wave of divine light.

Within the domain of lightning and flames, seven of the experts didn’t have time to dodge because they were too close. Even with their divine items protecting them, they were incinerated.

The other experts caught in its range miserably coughed up blood, staring in shock. If they had been struck head-on, they would be dead.

This attack of Long Chen’s was appalling to these experts. Although people had previously seen him use the Double Dragon Destruction, it hadn’t had as much power as just now.

That was because now, Lei Long and Huo Long had absorbed a large amount of Peak Dao Transformation Dragon Saliva. They were able to use their power better and work together with Long Chen, increasing the power of the Double Dragon Destruction. Furthermore, they had continued growing to a point that the people who had seen them would no longer recognize their power.

Heaven and earth collapsed in the face of this apocalyptic power. Lightning and flames continued to flicker, while Long Chen had already vanished.

Dongfang Yuyang, Shi Lingfeng, Ximen Tianxiong, and the other experts didn’t even see how Long Chen left.

“Is there any need to continue?” Zi Yan looked at the Pill fairy.

“You’ve ruined my important affairs.” The Pill Fairy glared at Zi Yan, flames flickering in her eyes.

“Long Chen previously had a chance to kill you, but he didn’t. Do you really have to kill him?”

“He blasphemed the god. He is a sinner of Pill Valley. His sins can only be wiped away by his blood and soul,” said the Pill Fairy coldly.

“Do you really not feel the slightest emotion toward him any longer?” Zi Yan’s eyes locked closely onto the Pill Fairy.

The Pill Fairy’s expression suddenly changed. She seemed to grow lost as if trying to recollect something. But then after the slightest struggle, her face returned to its old iciness.

“Zi Yan, I’ll remember this debt that the Illusive Music Immortal Palace owes me. I’ll be getting an explanation from them.”

The Pill Fairy merged into the Brahma Divine Diagram. A flash of light came from it, and it vanished along with her.

Zi Yan sighed. The Seven String Sea Suppressing Zither shrank until it merged into her body.

“Zither Fairy, you know that Long Chen is colluding with the original devil race to overturn the Martial Heaven Continent! Why would you help him? Isn’t the Illusive Music Immortal Palace supposed to be the protector of the continent?” demanded one of the experts.

“Whether Long Chen wants to overturn the continent or not isn’t dependent on what comes out of people’s mouths. Gossip is just a tool used for tricking the stupid. I didn’t think that heavenly geniuses like yourselves would also be tricked by it. It really is incomprehensible. Is there a need for you to act stupid? If you’re that stupid, I worry about your intelligence. If you’re not, it seems your heart is quite sinister.” Zi Yan didn’t give that person a chance to retort. She vanished.

Long Chen had escaped, and the Pill Fairy as well as the Zither Fairy had left. The experts present didn’t know how to react.

This had been a challenge between Yue Zifeng and Jian Wuchen. How was it that it now seemed to be bait for the main character, Long Chen?

The experts that didn’t participate in the battle weren’t fools. This was clearly a ploy involving Long Chen. Dongfang Yuyang, Shi Lingfeng, and the others had clearly wanted to make him stay behind. As for why, they hadn’t figured it out.

“Fairy Rushuang, that Yue Zifeng is an accomplice of Long Chen’s. I’d ask you to hand him over.”

Beitang Rushuang and Nangong Zuiyue were also preparing to leave because they knew that today’s matter was a trap. They had to report to their families because things were definitely not as simple as they appeared. But just as they were leaving, Shi Lingfeng blocked Beitang Rushuang’s path.

“Scram!” Beitang Rushuang was finally angry. Now she knew what true shamelessness was. It was to be so shameless as to convict someone to be guilty just by opening their mouth. By saying someone was a fiend, then they were a fiend.

Now she understood what Long Chen meant about how powerless it was to not have any powerful support. Beitang Rushuang had never been wrongly accused of anything in her life, nor had she ever been bullied.

She always laughed at Long Chen’s bad temper and how easily he could be provoked into a fight. That wasn’t the kind of mannerisms a transcendent expert should have. But now, she didn’t care about those things either.

“What did you say?” demanded Shi Lingfeng angrily.

Beitang Rushuang was as quick as lightning. The bow on her back instantly appeared in her hand, and the world suddenly turned dark, with her bow being the full moon in the night.

A ray of light shot out, piercing Shi Lingfeng’s shoulder. He was sent flying.

After that ray of light, the world returned to its original state. However, that sudden change in the world deeply shook people’s hearts.

“Shi Lingfeng, even if you’ve fully inherited Shi Changsheng’s techniques, you wouldn’t be qualified to talk to me like this, let alone in your current state. If you don’t recognize just how much mercy I’ve shown you, then I’ll make sure that you vanish from this world right now.” Beitang Rushuang held her bow, killing intent on her face. The angry Beitang Rushuang was very frightening. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

Having talked and laughed with Long Chen, often even being teased by him, it seemed that people’s impressions of her had changed. They had forgotten that she was a supreme genius amongst supreme geniuses.

Shi Lingfeng looked down and saw a fist-sized hole in his shoulder. There were also cracks spreading throughout his body. His body had almost collapsed, and there was now a trace of terror in his face. He hadn’t expected Beitang Rushuang to have the power to one-shot him.

That attack just now had been too fast. He hadn’t even seen what move Beitang Rushaung had used. She had instantly unleashed a full-power blow, an attack contrary to the common logic of the cultivation world. The foundation of an everlasting family was truly unfathomable.

Previously, Shi Lingfeng had provoked Nangong Zuiyue, but as a humble and amiable person, Nangong Zuiyue had just brushed it off with a smile.

At that time, Shi Lingfeng’s arrogance had grown, thinking that even the everlasting families’ geniuses were just on this level. That was simply evidence of Shi Lingfeng’s stone head. By blocking Beitang Rushuang and making demands of her, wasn’t he slapping her in the face?

“Yue Zifeng is Long Chen’s friend, and Long Chen is my friend. If someone wants him, then come. It seems that it’s been a long time since I’ve killed anyone. Some people have grown blind and think that they can bully me. Do you really think that I, Beitang Rushuang, am an easy target?”

Her reference to a blind person made people glance at Shi Lingfeng. Yes, he was truly blind in one eye.

“Fairy Rushuang, Yue Zifeng is...” Dongfang Yuyang hesitated but still opened his mouth.

“Stop with the crap. Long Chen has entrusted Yue Zifeng to me. I, Beitang Rushuang, will guarantee his safety even if I have to lose this life of mine. If anyone wants to harm him, then come try it. Let’s see just who dares to block me today!” Beitang Rushuang directly interrupted Dongfang Yuyang. After she waved her hand, the Beitang family’s disciples carried the unconscious Yue Zifeng and slowly left with her.
