Chapter 4768 Remove the Might

“KILL!”4

The Dragonblood warriors’ roars shook the heavens. They were like emissaries of the god of slaughter. At this moment, there was nothing constraining them, and they attacked with their full power.1

The Dragonblood Legion rarely fought freely like this. They were in no formation or squads. Such battles usually resulted in casualties, yet Long Chen chose to proceed regardless. He knew that while cooperation was important, they needed to hone their individual power. Without it, the group’s overall effectiveness would suffer.2

The fastest way to increase a person’s power was to throw them into chaotic battles where they had no one to depend on but themselves. If they wanted to live, they could only rely on their abilities.1

It was in the crucible of such perilous trials that one’s potential was truly tested and honed. It sharpened their senses and broadened their experience.1

In the path of cultivation, there were no flat open roads to success. Even though they were all Divine Venerates, who looked like supreme existences in the eyes of normal people, within the vast river of the cultivation world, they were nothing more than a single drop of water in the ocean, like floating duckweed drifting through the water. If they wanted to control their own fate, they had to get stronger.3

Every Dragonblood warrior understood this concept, knowing that even someone as strong as their boss could not change their fates. The only one who could change their fates was themselves.3

Within this raging ocean, Long Chen could only give them a direction. However, he could not walk their path for them. After all, every person had their own battles and challenges, and no one else could fight for them. The more dangerous the situation, the harder the Dragonblood warriors had to fight. They had to constantly challenge their limits.0

“A group of five star Doyens dares to charge at us? How foolish!”1

Seeing the Dragonblood warriors charging forward like hungry wolves, these experts smiled cruelly. All of them were nine star Doyens. While the Dragonblood warriors’ killing intent was frightening, these experts were not afraid of them, thinking that the Dragonblood warriors were attacking them because Long Chen was injured and needed time to stabilize his injuries. In their minds, he had sent his subordinates to their deaths to buy time for him to recover.0

“Ants! All of you can die!” A titanic expert swung two giant hammers toward the Dragonblood warriors.0

No one knew which race this person was from, but his Blood Qi was astounding, and his hammers dwarfed houses. 0

From the ranks of the Dragonblood Legion, a bald man charged out, his spear sweeping toward the hammers.1

BOOM!2

Those two hammers were sent flying, and the titanic lifeform roared in fury. People were shocked to see that his arms had been blasted apart, and in a desperate move, he started to flee.0

“What?!”0

“Impossible! How can a five star Doyen be so powerful?”0

“That isn’t Heavenly Doyen power, and it isn’t Blood Qi either. He used a bloodline divine ability!”0

Uproars exploded from the crowd as countless experts were filled with disbelief.0

These experts didn’t know that all the Dragonblood warriors wore Guo Ran’s aura-concealing rings, disguising themselves as five star Doyens.0

After sending that giant’s weapons flying, with a spin, Gu Yang stabbed his head. His body then twitched and went limp.0

“There’s no need to leave their corpses. I’m not interested in humanoid corpses,” announced Long Chen.9

Long Chen could tell that Gu Yang had held back; otherwise, that fellow would have been reduced to smithereens. Gu Yang was as strong as ever.0

In the dragon cemetery, he had obtained the immemorial wild dragon’s dragon soul, a ferocious killer with boundless power. It was one of the Sovereign clan’s most capable generals.1

Gu Yang was also a power-type fighter, and when their wills merged, their power reached a level that a normal person could not even comprehend.0

Although Gu Yang had not summoned the Dragon Blood Battle Armor, the dragon soul in him had awakened because of the slaughter, urging him to get into a wild fighting state. If Gu Yang hadn’t suppressed its power, he would probably already be in a berserk state.2

Just then, Guo Ran’s sabers blasted apart another expert, and dragon marks lit up on them, making them seem like awakened dragons. The power of his saber was something even nine star Doyens could not resist.0

As for Yue Zifeng, he was like a tiger amongst a flock of sheep, his sword slicing through the very world. He picked out enemies with the strongest auras, and with every slash, someone perished. Not one person was able to block even a single attack from him.4

When the Dragonblood warriors crashed into this crowd of experts, this world seemed to transform into hell. The experts who had been smiling cruelly were all horrified, but they didn’t even have a chance to cry.1

The Dragonblood warriors were like death gods reaping their lives. In the very first clash, their blood already flowed like rivers, and they were constantly forced back.0

In the distance, the spectators were all stunned. Just as they thought that Long Chen and the others would be blasted away, the exact opposite scene played out before them. The Dragonblood warriors instantly crushed their opponent’s assault and started chasing them down.0

Long Chen walked through the air as blood mist filled the space beneath his feet. As the Dragonblood warriors charged, he followed from the rear as if he were taking a relaxing stroll.1

Even though there were millions of experts on the other side, once the leaders were killed by the Dragonblood warriors, the rest were like rats fleeing a sinking ship.0

“Long Chen, this might be a trap,” warned Bai Shishi as she followed from the rear.3

Bai Shishi and Yu Qingxuan were not participating in the battle. They were advancing with Bai Zhantang, leading the academy, Battle God Palace, and Starry River Sect’s disciples. With the battle quickly becoming one-sided, Bai Shishi sensed something amiss.0

“You can remove the ‘might’ from that statement,” said Long Chen with a smile.1

“Then they’re…?”0

“In front of absolute power, all schemes are worthless. Who cares what their scheme is? We just have to blast through it with raw power,” replied Long Chen as he continued to advance. The Dragonblood warriors were still slaughtering their opponents, drenching the ground and sky with their blood.8Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

“What are you two talking about?” asked Bai Zhantang.1

Bai Shishi looked at her father and wanted to patiently explain it, but she found that she couldn’t find a way to say it clearly in just a few words. Just then, the Dragonblood warriors vanished from their sight as they had slaughtered their enemies beyond the gate.1

“Let’s quickly follow,” stated Bai Shishi, her heart tightening. She charged forward as she knew that the real battle lay beyond the gate.2
