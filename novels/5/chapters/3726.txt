Chapter 3715 Violet Thunderclap Empire’s Weng Taibei

As soon as that person appeared, the world changed color, the nine heavens quivered, and endless thunder roared. It was as if heavenly tribulation had descended. When this person showed up, everyone felt like a giant boulder was crushing them. Even breathing became difficult.Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

Even Divine Venerates felt their hearts shaking. Despite this figure also being a Divine Venerate just like He Hongzhang, the pressure that he gave off was on another level. It was like a single thought from him could destroy the entire world.

As for the heavenly geniuses present, they were quivering from the pressure. This was their first time seeing such a terrifying figure in their lifetime.

This middle-aged man was built like an iron tower. He had shoulder-length hair, and his face looked as if it had been carved by a knife. Lightning runes flickered within his eyes, which were as sharp as a blade. They made others not dare to look at him directly.

“The Violet Thunderclap Empire’s seventeenth generation monarch, Weng Taibei! He’s still alive!” A fellow Divine Venerate recognized this lightning-wreathed expert.

“Rumor is that before the Grand Xia disbanded, those two empires were at odds. There were even several wars fought between them. But every time, it was the Violet Thunderclap Empire that lost. Back then, Xia Guhong and Weng Taibei were young heroes rising up, the strongest heavenly geniuses of their empires. Hence, they were fated to be mortal enemies. Weng Taibei possesses an innate heavenly lightning body, and his blood has lightning runes flowing within it. It can even be said that he isn’t human, but a humanoid lifeform made of lightning. With his talent, Weng Taibei swept through everyone he encountered. His only two defeats were to Xia Guhong. The second time, Xia Guhong pursued him through half of the Violet Flame Heaven, almost slaying him. One battle was in the Immortal King realm, one was in the World King realm. Later on, Weng Taibei became a Divine Venerate. It was said that his Supreme Blood had been cultivated to the point of becoming one with the heavens. After that, he was preparing to wipe away all his disgrace from his losses against Xia Guhong. Regretfully, Xia Guhong lost his lover and was completely disheartened. He even disbanded the Grand Xia and vanished afterward, so the anticipated third battle between them never occurred. Now that Xia Guhong and Weng Taibei have appeared once more, that third battle might just occur after all,” said a Divine Venerate.

“That doesn’t sound likely. No matter how great their enmity is, they won’t fight all-out here. After all, too many people are here, and the three thousand worlds are about to open. If they were to fight, they would become enemies with everyone here,” said someone else, shaking his head.

If Divine Venerates fought, that terrifying pressure would be enough to destroy the entire Violet Flame Heaven Capital.

Furthermore, one of the entrances to the three thousand worlds was located here. If they were to destroy this entrance, then even as Divine Venerates, they would be inflicted with a terrifying karma.

Weng Taibei’s aura alone shook the nine heavens. He was like a lightning god descending from the heavens.

As for Long Chen, when he looked at Weng Taibei, he was shaken. Even Lei Linger couldn’t sit still and almost flew out of the primal chaos space.

Long Chen had Lei Linger calm down. This was a Divine Venerate, someone from the same generation as Xia Guhong. He still didn’t dare to set his sights on someone like this.

However, this person’s violent lightning spirit energy made his heart itchy. It was his first time seeing such a terrifying lightning cultivator. Seeing him, Long Chen’s first thought was that if Lei Linger devoured him, just what realm would she instantly rise to?

But this thought had to be put aside for now. Long Chen knew his own power. He was still too small in front of Divine Venerates.

When Weng Taibei appeared, the Heavenly Ruler Seal Empire’s He Hongzhang looked as if he had seen his saving star. He cupped his fists toward him.

“Senior, please save Changtian.”

At this time, Yu Qingxuan whispered into Long Chen’s ear, “It seems that the reason the Heavenly Ruler Seal Empire is targeting the Vermilion Bird Empire is because of the support of the Violet Thunderclap Empire.”

Yu Qingxuan had just arrived in the Vermilion Bird Empire and was unaware of many aspects of the empire. However, based on what she was seeing, even she could understand something.

The Vermilion Bird Empire had always been enemies with the Violet Thunderclap Empire throughout all of history. Their relationship had never been good. Also, He Hongzhang’s current expression showed everything. The reason why the Heavenly Ruler Seal Empire dared to challenge the Vermilion Bird Empire was due to the Violet Thunderclap Empire inciting things.

“To put it frankly, the Heavenly Ruler Seal Empire is a pack of idiot dogs. Back then, they were afraid of the Vermilion Bird Empire and wagged their tails pitifully, listening to their orders. Now they have someone else supporting them and start to bite.” Long Chen shook his head. He had seen such a thing often.

Just as Long Chen and Yu Qingxuan were whispering, Weng Taibei said, “Xia Guhong, the two of us will have a fight sooner or later. However, now still isn’t the time. You’re also someone with status. Don’t interfere in matters between juniors.”

“Are your eyes on your butt? Which of your eyes saw my big brother interfere in matters between juniors? It was clearly the Heavenly Ruler Seal Empire’s people that went back on their word. After beating the junior, the senior comes out. My big brother is only beating that shameless old fellow. How does that count as interfering in matters between juniors?” Even before Long Chen could reply, Guo Ran was arrogantly pointing and cursing at Weng Taibei.

He knew that with Xia Guhong’s support, there was nothing for him to fear. If he didn’t show off a bit now, he wouldn’t be Guo Ran.

Guo Ran’s pointing and cursing at Weng Taibei stunned the crowd. This fellow’s guts were too big, weren’t they? Did he not know that if Weng Taibei was enraged and wanted to kill him, he would be crushed like an ant?

However, Guo Ran didn’t care. Today, he had no chance to fight, so he had to find some other way to show off. Furthermore, this also saved Xia Guhong from having to waste words on this fellow.

“Brat, you are courting death!”

Before Weng Taibei even replied, someone shouted from behind him. Only now did people notice that Weng Taibei had over ten people behind him.

All of them were wrapped in lightning, like humanoid lightning standing within the sea of lightning behind Weng Taibei. Before one of them spoke, no one even noticed their existence.

These people were all lightning cultivators with shocking auras. But the most shocking thing of all was that four of them were emitting Supreme auras. They actually had four Supreme experts.

Even those that didn’t have Supreme auras had auras that were as heavy and solid as mountains. They were experts amongst experts, geniuses amongst geniuses. Those non-Supreme experts gave off a pressure that was only slightly inferior to actual Supreme experts.

As for their leader, he was a man with shoulder-length hair and a sword on his back. A lightning halo could vaguely be seen behind his head. This person was a peak Divine Lord but had condensed a Heavenly Dao Crown. His aura was exceptionally shocking.

This person actually had violet hair, and looking closely, his violet hair had tiny marks within them with flickering light.

“Another heavenly lightning body?!”

A Divine Venerate cried out in shock. This person actually possessed the same constitution as Weng Taibei.

“Then isn’t another Weng Taibei about to be produced?”

People were shocked. If this man also grew up and became a Divine Venerate, then the Violet Thunderclap Empire would truly climb to the peak of all empires.

“You’re the one courting death. What? Do you want to fight? Come and report your name! I, Guo Ran, do not kill nameless people!” Guo Ran pointed at the violet-haired man disdainfully.

In truth, the moment Guo Ran spotted the violet-haired man, he felt a chill. He could sense that the latter was a terrifying opponent.

However, with so many people watching, he refused to retreat and put on an arrogant appearance.

“Since you’re courting death, I, Weng Tianyao, will fulfill your wish.”

That violet-haired man, Weng Tianyao, immediately agreed to Guo Ran’s challenge. He walked out of the violet lightning sea behind Weng Taibei.

“AH!”

Just then, a miserable scream rang out.
