Chapter 3579

Heavenly Dragon City was the prefecture city of the Heavenly Dragon Domain. As for the entire Heavenly Dragon Domain, it was under the protection of the Heavenly Dragon Divine Armor College. That was how it survived.

The Heavenly Dragon Divine Armor College was one of the Alldevil Star-Field’s eight major powers. In terms of power, they were actually near the top of the star-field.

However, the Heavenly Dragon Divine Armor College did not dominate or lead the Alldevil Star-Field. That was because the college did not like to stand out. They only helped the other powers fight against their common enemies.

Also, the Heavenly Dragon Divine Armor College was not solely under the jurisdiction of the dean. Even the dean did not possess that absolute authority. Instead, the true decision-makers were the twelve Assembly Elders.

Every important decision had to be suggested by the dean, while the Assembly Elders voted. The dean himself only had two votes.

Thus, even though the dean had personally descended, some Elders still dared to say some things to target Long Chen. It wasn’t that they didn’t place the dean in their eyes, but that the attitude of the Heavenly Dragon Divine Armor College was that every person had the right to raise their own suspicions, even if it was against their dean.

However, no one opposed the dean’s decision to invite Long Chen into the Heavenly Dragon Divine Armor College, because they felt that once he was inside their walls, he would never have a chance to leave.

Xue Yifan was the dean but didn’t possess any of the arrogance of the leader of such a major force. He was like an ordinary elder, walking alongside Long Chen and telling Long Chen about the history of Heavenly Dragon City.

Long Chen naturally had goodwill toward Xue Yifan as he treated Long Chen like an equal. He didn’t treat Long Chen as a member of the junior generation and continued to call him dean Long Chen.

Guo Ran then followed behind Long Chen. Seeing the countless shocked gazes directed at Long Chen, he had an arrogant expression. That was clearly the very image of a fox borrowing the tiger’s might. After enduring for so long, he was finally venting.

He very much enjoyed the feeling of having to do nothing but be surrounded by countless people’s gazes just by staying behind Long Chen.

“Heavenly Dragon Divine Armor College.”

After going through Heavenly Dragon City, they reached a set of huge gates. Above the gates, the name of the college was written in golden paint.

The characters were ancient and powerful, filled with Dao-charm. It was as if the entire world’s ten thousand Daos were compressed within these characters.

Seeing that Long Chen was staring at the characters in stunned silence, Xue Yifan smiled slightly. “Do they seem a bit familiar?”

“Could it be…?” Long Chen was shocked.

“These characters were written by the same disciple who wrote the sign above the High Firmament Academy’s gates. In truth, the Heavenly Dragon Divine Armor College is a branch that originated from the High Firmament Academy,” explained Xue Yifan with a smile.

Hearing that, Long Chen wasn’t the only one that was shocked. The experts following them were also stunned. Even the World Kings couldn’t believe it when they heard it.

“Thus, when dean Long Chen honored us with your presence, I naturally couldn’t tarry. Fortunately, you are only the dean of a branch academy. If you were the dean of the main academy, I would have to greet you like a junior toward a senior,” laughed Xue Yifan.

Long Chen had never expected such a thing. So the Heavenly Dragon Divine Armor College actually had such a deep relationship with the High Firmament Academy.

“Dean, how did you recognize my status?” asked Long Chen. By the time he came to the Violet Flame Heaven, the Alldevil Star-Field was already sealed. Normally, it should be impossible for people here to know about him.

“As dean, I have nothing to do all day. Once a person grows old, they stop bothering with things and just like to listen to the gossip. I managed to learn a few bits of information like that,” said Xue Yifan with a smile.

Long Chen was surprised. It seemed that the person before him was not so simple. His information network was so widespread. He definitely had to have special channels, otherwise, there was no way that information from the Chaotic Star Sea would be able to reach this place.

In other words, this dean definitely had special means to communicate with the outside world. Then the Alldevil Star-Field was not truly a land of death just yet.

“Dean Long Chen, please.” Xue Yifan gestured.

Long Chen was courteous and walked into the college alongside Xue Yifan. Once he was inside, he saw countless people glaring at him frostily. Those gazes were not friendly.

Clearly, someone had told the people here about an intruder that broke the barrier to enter the city.

When it came to those gazes, Long Chen couldn’t be bothered to pay them the slightest attention. As for Guo Ran, seeing the old fellows within the crowd, he directly stuck up his middle finger with a disdainful expression.

Those were all people that had bullied Guo Ran during this time. Now, it was Guo Ran’s turn to counterattack.

After all, these people didn’t dare to act impudent in front of the dean. They all bowed as he passed. But then, Guo Ran walked close behind the dean, waving his hand to them as if saying that there was no need to bow to him. He infuriated these people.

On the other hand, Long Chen’s gaze didn’t fall on those people. Instead, he stared at these buildings. He had never seen a sect made entirely out of metal. Even the bricks on the ground were cast out of metal, so this entire sect gave off a heavy feeling.

As they were walking, a sharp gaze suddenly drew Long Chen’s attention. Long Chen then looked over to see a woman whose gaze seemed to contain a divine sword. Moreover, her Blood Qi was very powerful as if there was a wild beast slumbering in her body. She actually gave Long Chen quite a sense of pressure.

She was tall, even half a head taller than an average man. But her body was well proportioned. Her shoulders were a bit wide, and she wore a skintight battle dress, showing some moving curves. Although she wouldn’t be considered a beauty, she gave off a wild flavor.

“Boss, this person is Xie Liuer, the only woman amongst the Four Heavenly Dragon Heroes. Just look at her. Doesn’t she resemble Ruyan?” whispered Guo Ran.

“They are a bit similar. Especially that fierceness.”

Long Chen nodded. Liu Ruyan was also tall, perhaps the tallest amongst the women in his group. However, this Xie Liuer was simply expressing her arrogance, while Liu Ruyan was icily arrogant from her bones. There was still a great difference in their temperaments.

“She is my mortal enemy, and I’ve suffered quite a bit at her hands. Boss, you must avenge me!” declared Guo Ran.

“Why can’t you get revenge yourself?”

“It’s not like I can beat her. My meaning is that you should seduce her, make her fall in love with you, and then cast her aside.”

“Scram. Did you come to the Heavenly Dragon Divine Armor College to study these things?” demanded Long Chen irritably.

“Don’t be like that! I’ve already bragged to her! You can’t end up slapping my face!” cried Guo Ran.

“What did you say to her?”

“She looked down on me and suppressed me, and just seeing how arrogant she acted pissed me off. So I said, ‘what are you acting like a badass for? If you encounter my boss, you’ll immediately submit. Not one woman beneath the heavens can resist my boss’s allure! With your looks, by my boss’s side, you would only be fit to be a maid doing his laundry!’,” said Guo Ran.

“Why the hell did you drag me into it?!” raged Long Chen.

“Because I couldn’t beat them back then! I didn’t have any other vicious words to say! Just look at how contemptuously she’s looking at you! Boss, how can you endure this?” said Guo Ran, trying to fan some flames. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

“That’s enough. It was a mistake to come here. You can treat it as if I didn't come here, and I’ll leave in a bit,” said Long Chen speechlessly.

Guo Ran instantly began to panic. Just as he was about to speak again, their path was blocked by a group of elders.

“It’s the Assembly Elders.”

Guo Ran hastily put away his smile and whispered a warning. These people actually blocked the dean’s way, and they didn’t have friendly expressions.
