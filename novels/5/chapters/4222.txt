Chapter 4211 Violet Blood Dyes the Sky

“You want to die that badly, huh?!”

Xu Yifeng roared furiously. The fact that one of the Xu family’s disciples had pissed himself had deeply humiliated them. This humiliation filled Xu Yifeng with rage, causing his murderous intent to surge.

“Should we join in?” Guo Ran was itching for a fight upon seeing Long Chen charge out.

“No rush. Things aren’t as simple as it seems. Just prepare for battle!” said Meng Qi.

With Meng Qi here, Tang Wan-er, Bai Shishi, Yu Qingxuan, Ye Zhiqiu, and Dong Mingyu all listened to her.

Just like Long Chen, Meng Qi had the qualities of a leader. However, the difference was that Long Chen was an extroverted leader, while Meng Qi was leaning more toward introversion.

Long Chen’s leadership charisma stemmed from his unmatched power and determination to face life and death together with his brothers.

As for Meng Qi’s quality was a silent one that might not be visible on the surface. However, she silently won people over, making them respect and listen to her.

Thus, when Meng Qi spoke, even Guo Ran, the general of the Dragonblood Legion, wouldn’t dare to defy her.

Long Chen had set out alone, charging toward the Xu family’s camp.

“Your talent for malicious slander isn’t bad. You are clearly the instigator here, but you say that I’m the one with a death wish? Let’s see just who wants to die more.” Long Chen shot into the air.

All the Xu family’s experts took out their weapons. However, Xu Yifeng flew out alone to face Long Chen. “He’s mine! I will personally wring off his head.”

Xu Yifeng sneered at Long Chen. As violet marks flowed on top of his fist, its sheer force seemed to shake the very heavens and earth.

“I will kill you within ten moves!”

“If you can endure ten moves from me, I will personally give you my head,” sneered Long Chen, smashing his own fist at him.

Long Chen’s fight with the Xu family drew the attention of the outside world’s experts. They all wanted to see this battle.

It had to be known that the Violet Blood race was one of the strongest bloodlines of the nine heavens and ten lands. In particular, Xu Yifeng was the strongest disciple of his generation in the Xu family, so everyone wanted to see just how powerful the legendary Violet Blood divine abilities were.

In the same vein, although Long Chen’s background was not as great, he still came from the most ancient academy of the nine heavens and ten lands, their youngest dean in all of history. To be able to sit in that position, he must be the most outstanding disciple of the High Firmament Academy.

One was the strongest monster of the Violet Blood race, and the other was the strongest disciple of an ancient academy. Just what kind of chaos would erupt between the two of them?

Their battle became the focus of everyone inside and outside the martial stage. As a result, countless people were making their own guesses as to just which one was stronger.

However, when both of them said that they would kill the other party in ten moves, everyone gasped. With this, they not only decided who was stronger and weaker but also life and death.

BOOM!

Under countless people’s gazes, Long Chen and Xu Yifeng’s fists clashed, its impact causing golden and violet light to erupt and the entire martial stage to quiver.

Astral winds raged and a violent pressure pushed countless people backward. The bricks on the martial stage creaked and let out an ear-piercing sound as if invisible blades were streaking across the stage.

Following that, there was another explosive sound. The force field around them went from a few dozen meters to thousands of miles in an instant.

“What terrifying power!”

Those outside the martial stage cried out in shock. This level of power had almost reached the same as that of an innate Heaven Venerate.

Clearly, their first blow had only been a probing blow, and only now were they starting to use their real power.

The bricks on the stage shattered, their exceptional durability, surpassing that of even World Domain divine items, were unable to endure their overwhelming power.

“You dare to act arrogant with this little bit of power? To use your Xu family’s words, weaklings like you aren’t fit to live in this world,” sneered Long Chen.

Xu Yifeng sneered back, “If I killed you in one move, it would be too boring. I’m only using a tenth of my power right now. As for you? You’re already forced to use your full might!”

“Ten percent?!”

Everyone was shocked, unable to believe their ears. This fellow had to be bragging, right? Ten percent of his power was this terrifying? If that was the case, then even innate Heaven Venerates weren’t a match for him.

“My full power? Alright, then I’ll show you what my full power looks like.”

Suddenly, the space behind Long Chen exploded. When a seven-colored divine ring appeared, his aura erupted like a volcano that had been suppressed for billions of years.

The martial stage beneath Long Chen’s feet then exploded, sending bits of stone flying. As for Xu Yifeng, he let out a grunt and was forced back seven steps.

Every step he took caused the bricks beneath him to shatter. On the seventh step, he let out a shout, stamping a hole in the martial stage and finally stabilizing himself.

“We’re finally seeing boss’s divine ring again.”

When the Dragonblood warriors saw that divine ring with all its majesty again, they clenched their fists. This image awakened the battle intent within them.

Their blood was set ablaze, as though they had returned to the time on the Martial Heaven Continent where they followed Long Chen on an unstoppable sweep through their enemies’ ranks.

The seven-colored divine ring made heaven and earth quiver. As astral winds raged around Long Chen, he appeared to be an undefeatable god of war, an existence that others could not touch.

Just releasing his new aura was enough to send Xu Yifeng flying. As a result, countless people were shocked by Long Chen’s power.

“As a person, you should know respect and gratitude. If a person lacks that, how are they any different from an animal?”ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

Long Chen looked at Xu Yifeng disdainfully, appearing far above him. The current seven-colored divine ring had reached its full power. When it appeared, heaven and earth submitted, while the ten thousand Daos kneeled. Long Chen could even sense a few things through his divine ring.

However, he had no time to waste. His only thought was to kill Xu Yifeng. Only by taking down this troublemaker could he hope to pacify the internal strife. Otherwise, if the human race were to be thrown into a battle amongst themselves, it would create an opening for the other races to exploit, spelling certain doom for humanity.

Long Chen was far from a saint. He had never thought about saving every single person, but if the rest of the human race were crushed, his Dragonblood Legion would have to stand alone against the experts of all the other races. Despite their formidable strength, casualties would be inevitable, and that was something Long Chen could not accept.

Thus, Long Chen was going to kill the chicken to warn the monkeys, and the chicken was Xu Yifeng.

Long Chen’s divine ring quivered as he began to walk toward Xu Yifeng. With each step he took, the hearts of countless onlookers seemed to tighten in unison, synchronizing their beats with Long Chen's strides.

“Hahaha, interesting!”

Suddenly, Xu Yifeng laughed. Rather than fear, it seemed that Long Chen’s power excited him.

“It seems that I also have to take this seriously!”

“Violet Blood Dyes the Sky!”

Xu Yifeng yelled out, and violet divine radiance descended from the heavens as he summoned his manifestation.
