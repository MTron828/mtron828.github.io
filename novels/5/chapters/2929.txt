Chapter 2918 Fierce Battle Between the Tiger and Dragon

“How dangerous.”

Long Chen brushed the rubble off of him and then examined his clothes. Not seeing any new damage, he sighed with relief.

Seeing Long Chen care so much for those clothes, everyone knew that he wasn’t injured. They found it funny instead.

On the other hand, Chu Huairen’s expression gradually turned ugly. Just now, Chu Kuang hadn’t held back with that attack. And the result of it was that Long Chen’s weapon was destroyed, but he himself was fine.

Chu Kuang’s attack hadn’t even broken Long Chen’s protective qi. Otherwise, his clothes would have been blown apart.

Because of this, Chu Huairen’s confidence began to fade, and a bad feeling rose from the bottom of his heart. This feeling kept growing stronger and stronger.

Long Chen patted the dust off of his clothes and then unhurriedly looked at Chu Kuang. “It seems that for the sake of my clothes, I can also no longer remain low-key. I should warn you, I’m going to start using my real power now. You might lose in just a few moves, so if you have any trump cards, you should use them now. Otherwise, don’t cry to the Yama King when you get slaughtered in a bit and say that I didn’t give you a chance.”

An uproar exploded amongst the spectators. What kind of situation was this? Long Chen was also holding back? Even at this point, he wasn’t using his full power? Were they really humans?

“What nonsense. You’re still saying big words with death at hand. I will kill you right now in front of everyone!” Chu Kuang shot after Long Chen once more, not using any flashy moves. He simply locked Long Chen down with his bloodline power. After that, his saber fell, causing ripples to appear in the air.

Luo Bing and Luo Ning’s hearts clenched. Long Chen didn’t even have a weapon, so how could he block this? They hoped for Long Chen to be able to suddenly take out a divine weapon. Perhaps then, he would have a chance. But they had never seen Long Chen use some amazing weapon. Furthermore, he was currently rolling up his sleeves…

“What is he doing?!”

After he had rolled up his sleeves, he bent his body slightly like a leopard preparing to pounce. His gaze instantly became as sharp as a sword.

He then formed hand seals and shouted, “Heaven and earth, land and sky, the blue dome of the firmament, summon the stars!”

Multiple starry rivers suddenly appeared within Long Chen’s divine ring, forming a star diagram.

When that star diagram appeared, a pillar of light erupted into the sky with Long Chen at the center. After that, a power from above the starry sky manifested.

This pillar of light pierced through the formation around the battlefield. Everyone clearly saw it pierce high above the nine heavens.

Following that, a terrifying power descended from above the heavens, going straight toward Long Chen.

The stars in his star diagram were originally dim, but when this power descended, those stars instantly blazed with light.

The light pillar then exploded, transforming into runes. It was like a star had exploded, and it lit up the entire world like millions of fireflies. It was both illusory and real.

“It’s the forbidden technique, Starry River of the Sky Art!”

Several experts cried out, recognizing this technique. Perhaps the youngsters didn’t know of it, but amongst the senior generation, almost everyone recognized it.

That was because the Starry River of the Sky Art had once lured countless heavenly geniuses into cultivating it, and it resulted in countless deaths. After that sensation, the academy classified it as a forbidden art. Without the express approval of someone at the level of an institute head, it was forbidden for anyone to read it.

This technique was too bizarre and domineering. It was famed for being ominous, which was why the senior experts recognized it.

It was precisely because they recognized it that they were so shocked. Just the Seven Supreme Yang Technique that Long Chen had previously revealed was already shocking enough.

Now that he had also taken out the Starry River of the Sky Art, merging the manifestations of two different cultivation techniques into one, everyone was shocked.

“He forcibly merges two completely different cultivation techniques into one? How is that possible?!”

The experts watching felt like they had gone mad. This made no sense. Such a thing completely broke the iron laws of cultivation.

At this moment, the divine ring behind Long Chen revolved and the star twinkled. As the astral energy rushed through his body, he could sense the countless stars up above the heavens, as if they were watching him.

Even though he no longer dared to touch their power after that incident, he still felt the ephemeral connection to them. It was a strange feeling.

That mysterious expert had said that if he wanted to use their power, he would have to condense the seventh star first. Otherwise, it would be no different from suicide.

Last time, he had failed to gather that astral energy and almost died. But that failure still gave him the experience. He could now sense the position of every star in the sky, and he felt as if every star in his body corresponded to one of those stars. It was a profound feeling.

This was his first time using his astral energy in the immortal world. Hence, he was immersed in the feeling, almost forgetting that he was in the middle of a battle.

Just at that moment, Chu Kuang’s saber fell toward him. And without even thinking about it, Long Chen punched at it with a scale-covered fist.

BOOM!

As a result, a powerful explosion shook the battlefield, and a wave of runes exploded in every direction. It was as if the sun had exploded from his punch. Chu Kuang hacked up blood and tumbled away.

“What?!” Chu Huairen leaped out of his seat, stunned.

“Did he just receive an attack from a Spirit item with his bare hand?!”

Everyone was shocked. With just a body of flesh and blood, Long Chen could face Spirit items. Furthermore, it was a Spirit item with a bloodline inheritance. Was he a devil beast in human form?

Chu Kuang smashed through multiple mountains, causing them to collapse. It was a dizzying sight.

“In the immortal world, using the Nine Star Hegemon Body Art is much easier. Only in the immortal world can it unleash its greatest potential.”

Long Chen sensed the astral energy surging through his body, and that power made him feel like the ruler of the world, like an unrivaled sovereign. He had never experienced this feeling. It was as if all others should submit to him.

With just three steps, Long Chen appeared in front of Chu Kuang again and he unleashed a stamp of his foot.

“So fast!”

Startled cries rang out. Long Chen was practically teleporting. He was so fast that they couldn’t even track him.

Chu Kuang had barely climbed out of the dirt when Long Chen’s foot landed. As a result, another huge explosion caused a giant hole to appear in the ground.

This tough battlefield was like paste in front of Long Chen. With a single attack, the terrain was changed. Dust and sand flew about.

Chu Kuang managed to block Long Chen’s foot with his saber. But as Long Chen pressed down, Chu Kuang sank deeper and deeper. He couldn’t knock Long Chen away. It felt like an entire world was crashing down upon him, and no matter what he did, he couldn’t shake Long Chen off. He felt like was going to be crushed.

“Bastard, die!” Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

Chu Kuang suddenly roared and the four balls of light behind him revolved. The power of the God path erupted.
