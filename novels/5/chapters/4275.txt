Chapter 4264: Let Me Have a Bite

The Black Tortoise race’s peak expert was in the middle of a fight with Ye Zhiqiu. Endless ice flew about this region, and he had tried to break through her defenses countless times, only to be repelled repeatedly, causing him to bellow in frustration.

Suddenly, he felt a chill. It was as though a primordial beast had set his sights on him. He then turned to see Wilde salivating over him, and his soul fled in terror. He hastily turned and ran.

“Stop! Let me taste the flavor of a black turtle!”

Seeing him run, Wilde hastily shouted and sped up.

With Wilde’s huge body, a single step made him cross many miles and caused the martial stage to quiver.

The Black Tortoise expert felt a sense of mortal danger, and his four legs rapidly brought him away. Just because his legs were short didn’t mean that his speed was slow.

He almost pissed himself in terror. The only reason why he was still capable of running was because he was far away from Wilde. Once Wilde caught him though, his instincts told him that he would undoubtedly die.

“Don’t run! I won’t kill you! Just let me have a bite! I want to see if you’re as delicious as what my grandpa said!” shouted Wilde as he ran.

Suddenly, the void exploded, and countless vines twined around Wilde like pythons.

“Get out of my way!” Wilde furiously smashed the vines apart with his club. However, more vines quickly wrapped around his arm as well.

Wilde furiously fought against the vines, blasting them apart over and over. However, they were limitless, causing Wilde to shout his fury.

These vines came from the experts of the Undying race. They saw Wilde’s weakness, and hundreds of thousands of them were tying him down at once.

Their goal wasn’t to kill him. They only wanted to tie him down and prevent him from participating in the battle. Over time, more and more veins bound Wilde.

These vines were shockingly tough. An ordinary Triple Supreme would have no chance of escaping once they were fully wrapped.

As for Wilde, he easily broke them apart, but there were just too many of them, and they also possessed powerful life force. As a result, Wilde was caught.

Seeing Wilde tied down, the Black Tortoise expert sighed with relief and once more returned to the battlefield.

The advantage Wilde had brought instantly vanished. At this moment, the Barbarian warriors were dealing with the experts of the Heavenly River Blood Crocodile, Gold Tusk Wild Mammoth, and Six Horn Barbarian Bull races.

These three races had their peak experts slain by Wilde. But now that Wilde was tied down, they frantically attacked again, trying to break through their formation.

The Barbarian warriors numbered merely in the thousands, and while they were powerful, there was an immense number disparity. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

At this time, the martial stage’s barrier began to grow unstable. Countless people’s hearts clenched nervously.

“Hold on! The martial stage is about to fall apart!” Bai Zhantang clenched his fists. He was so nervous that his forehead was sweaty.

As long as the martial stage broke, everything would be over, and they would be able to reinforce Long Chen and the others.

However, this was also the most dangerous time. The experts within also saw the martial stage changing, and so they grew even more frantic.

“Are you just going to watch?! The martial stage is about to vanish! If you keep sitting there, the karmic luck runes will be fully absorbed, and you’ll have no other chance!” roared Ye Wuchen.

Currently, quite a few people were just watching, looking harmless. But no one knew just how many experts were hidden amongst their ranks.

These people were still watching. Previously, the Heavenly River Blood Crocodile, Gold Tusk Wild Mammoth, and Six Horn Barbarian Bull races had been amongst them.

It was unknown just how many people like them were amongst these spectators, still waiting for their chance. However, the martial stage was quivering, indicating that the martial stage was about to vanish.

The majority of these spectators had weaker cultivation bases and didn’t have the power to compete for the karmic luck runes, so they directly gave up on fighting for them.

The only reason they had managed to survive to this point was thanks to Xu Xin-er. She had exposed the truth about this ceremony, and the cannon fodder that should have been sacrificed managed to survive.

With Ye Wuchen’s roar, one figure after another came flying out of their midst. They numbered only a few hundred and came from many different races.

To everyone’s surprise, when they flew out, they summoned their manifestations that looked like blazing suns, which meant that these hundreds of people were all top experts. However, it seemed that they were all solitary figures. Once they appeared, the balance of the battlefield would be instantly shattered.

“Jiang Feng, what are you doing?!” Feng Fei’s shout came from the human race’s side.

Jiang Feng was that expert who had wanted to attack the Dragonblood Legion before but hadn’t.

His power was second within the Jiang clan and above Feng Fei. However, his authority simply wasn’t as high as hers. Seeing so many experts suddenly make their move, he joined them.

“Hmph, when a woman is in charge, the walls collapse. What can you possibly accomplish when you’re afraid of every little thing? If we still don’t make our move now, how long are you going to wait? You guys can keep cowering like tortoises. I, Jiang Feng, am not going to let such an opportunity pass,” sneered Jiang Feng.

“Bastard, you are killing yourself!” shouted Feng Fei.

“I will use my actions to prove that women can only see as far as their own fingers,” sneered Jiang Feng. He was already shooting out at the Dragonblood Legion.

“This idiot!”

Feng Fei was pale, quivering with rage. The Jiang clan’s experts looked from Feng Fei to Jiang Feng. They were envious of him.

They were also extremely enticed. After all, those were karmic luck runes, priceless treasures that could change a person’s life. Yet, all they could do was observe, what a torture.

However, the Jiang clan’s rules were strict. The family head had personally ordered them to listen to Feng Fei, and they lacked the audacity to defy the clan head's commands, unlike Jiang Feng.

BOOM!

Long Chen and Long Aotian were still fighting. With a heaven-shaking explosion, Long Aotian was sent flying back, while Long Chen shot back to the Dragonblood Legion.

“Want to save them? Keep dreaming!”

Long Aotian sneered and chased after him.

A flame lotus suddenly appeared in Long Chen’s left hand, and he shouted, “Wilde!”

Long Chen then tossed an enormous flame lotus at Wilde.

BOOM!

White flames devoured Wilde, as well as the vines binding him, instantly incinerating them. Wilde then gritted his teeth because of this burn, but other than his skin reddening slightly, he wasn’t injured.

“DIE!”

After escaping, Wilde roared and smashed his club at Long Aotian. All his anger at being trapped was unleashed on Long Aotian.
