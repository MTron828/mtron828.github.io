Chapter 3462 Enpuda Appears

BOOM!

A saber crashed down, shattering the Dao. As a result, countless runes flew through the air, and a bloody path appeared amongst the Devil Eye Water Lilies.

Long Chen seemed to be possessed by a devil god, and his figure was rapidly charging over. On the other side was another figure being blown back.𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

When people saw that figure, they gasped in shock. It was a World King. Long Chen had actually exchanged blows with a World King of the Devil Eye Water Lily race.

The immense shockwaves blew away countless Devil Eye Water Lilies. Some of the closest ones were directly blown apart.

This time, Long Chen didn’t manage to shatter his opponent’s five-colored divine sword. Instead, his arms were numb. This World King of the Devil Eye Water Lily race was too powerful.

He had transformed into human form. Not only did he possess terrifying power, but he also had the five powers of metal, wood, water, fire, and earth. When those five elements merged, it was like he possessed five spiritual bodies in one. His attacks were sharp and heavy, as if nothing could stop them.

Most frightening of all, his attacks also contained a spiritual aspect. If it weren’t for Long Chen’s vast Spiritual Strength and firm Dao-heart, he would definitely be badly affected. There was truly no need to doubt the power of the Devil Eye Water Lily race.

While Long Chen’s arm was numb, his opponent also didn’t have it easy. Long Chen’s Split the Heavens had caused his manifestation to suddenly dim. It only returned to its original state after several breaths’ time.

Clearly, even for him, Long Chen’s attack required immense power to counter. His expression changed. He suddenly swung his hand, and all the Devil Eye Water Lilies retreated.

Long Chen pointed at the World King and coldly said, “You were used by others. If you stop now, it will still be in time. If instead you continue attacking the academy, then I, Long Chen, swear to make the Devil Eye Water Lily race pay ten thousand times the price.”

Long Chen could also see that with the final exchange, that World King was a bit afraid.

If they continued fighting, perhaps he himself might be fine, but there would be quite a few casualties amongst his fellow Devil Eye Water Lilies. He didn’t want to see so many casualties. Instead, he wanted to take a step back, allowing the others to take the vanguard and thus the most losses.

Long Chen saw that the other areas were in crisis as well. The Devil Eye Water Lily race had been temporarily cowed, so he had to go reinforce the others.

Clearly, the devil world, the devil sea, and the Devil Eye Water Lily race were being used by others for this attack on the academy. But when it came to the Devil Eye Water Lily race, their enmity only stemmed from a seed pod, so it still hadn’t reached the point of no return.

Thus, Long Chen made this pledge, hoping that they would retreat now. Long Chen also didn’t want to offend so many people.

The hundreds of thousands of experts of the Devil Eye Water Lily race slowly fell back, standing in the distance to just watch. But the devils and sea demons of the devil world and devil sea continued to crazily charge at the academy.

Although Bai Xiaole and his mother had created a spatial barrier, which sent anyone who charged through away, such a thing rapidly depleted their spatial energy. They couldn’t maintain it for long.

“Split the Heavens!”

Long Chen unleashed a wave of saber-light that blasted through enemies.

Inside the academy, the disciples unleashed excited cheers when they saw how unstoppable Long Chen was. They felt like his glory was theirs as well, as if they were the ones slaughtering these devils.

“Long Chen, you go west. I’ll take the east!”

When Long Chen and Bai Shishi passed by each other, Bai Shishi shouted at him. Both sides were under pressure and needed to be reinforced.

“Alright, be careful. Save some energy. The real enemy has yet to appear,” transmitted Long Chen.

Bai Shishi’s heart shook. There were still more enemies lying in wait?

Long Chen charged to the west. The Battle God Palace’s experts here were being forced back. There were too many enemies, and they were only a dozen people. They couldn’t stop the enemies.

Long Chen then unleashed Split the Heavens three times. His huge-area attacks filled this area with corpses, lightening the pressure on this area instantly. The Battle God Palace’s experts worked together with Long Chen to force back their enemies.

While Long Chen attacked, he also gathered the corpses on the battlefield and put them in the primal chaos space. He could already guess the goal of his opponents.

That terrifying attack just now was the result of condensing all the energy of the fallen devils. But Long Chen didn’t know what method they had used.

Thus, he was still uneasy. As he slaughtered these enemies, he did his best to suck them into the primal chaos space as fast as possible so that they couldn’t be used by their enemies.

Unfortunately, the battlefield was too big, and he was unable to cover the entire thing. But every bit that he took in was one bit that the enemy couldn’t absorb.

Another half an incense stick’s worth of time passed. The holes in the barrier had vanished, but it was still covered in cracks. It was still too weak to endure another such attack. If they wanted to return it to its previous state, it would take at least an hour. This hour was the crux to victory or defeat.

The thing that made Long Chen the most uneasy was that the other side had not even shown themselves yet. He didn’t know what scheme they were cooking up in the dark, but he refused to believe that the other side was composed of only Jia Luo.

Everything was clearly premeditated. Jia Luo had appeared to stop Bai Zhantang, essentially stopping the academy’s strongest trump card.

Bai Zhantang was in his Ghost Dao Possession state, and it could be considered as if he was now a merger of two powers within him. However, all of that immense power had been dragged away by Jia Luo. There had to be some goal behind his action.

While Long Chen grabbed the corpses on the ground, he also kept an eye on the entire battlefield. Time passed bit by bit. Every breath seemed as long as an hour.

The barrier was being repaired too slowly, and the feeling of unease grew. Long Chen felt the other side to be truly sinister. He was always forced to fight passively. It was very unfavorable to him.

However, there was also nothing he could do. He had been schemed against once more. The situation was precarious, but he could only wait. That made him furious. He truly disliked being toyed with like he was a fool.

Suddenly, the world shook and another pillar of light shot toward the academy. Long Chen’s heart sank. This attack was just as terrifying as the last. It was unstoppable.

Long Chen clenched his teeth. He prepared to risk his life to stop it, but he suddenly found that although this attack was flying in the direction of the academy, it was off-target.

BOOM!

As expected, just as Long Chen and the others were confused, that attack shattered the space above the academy. The void was torn apart, leaving a giant hole.

Long Chen and the others were startled. If this attack had landed on the formation, it would definitely break. Although Long Chen had been willing to risk his life to stop it, he really had no confidence in being able to stop it.

However, such a terrifying attack had actually gone off target. Furthermore, at this moment, countless figures began to appear in the distance. Long Chen instantly spotted a treacherous fatty.

“Enpuda!”

Seeing Enpuda’s sinister smile, Long Chen’s heart sank. It seemed that they had missed on purpose.

“Could it be…” Long Chen turned back to that hole in the void, his expression changing.
