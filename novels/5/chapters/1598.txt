Chapter 1593 Burning Money

Translator: BornToBe

There were countless craftsmen and workers building things quickly. Huge wooden frameworks had already been built.

Looking at the busy disciples, Long Chen smiled faintly. In order to save money, the Xuan Master actually had the disciples do some of the work that didn’t require specialization.

However, those disciples were mostly outer sect disciples with low cultivation bases. For them, doing this work would come with a high reward, so they were naturally delighted to be doing it.

“Senior apprentice-brother Long Chen!”

As soon as Long Chen returned, two disciples appeared, bowing deeply to him. They were disciples who had just joined and were rank eight Soul Transformation Celestials. Just from that sight, it was possible to see that the Xuantian Dao Sect had truly grown.

“It’s been hard on you.” Long Chen patted them on the shoulder with a smile.

The two of them were indescribably moved to be able to speak and interact with Long Chen. The main reason they had joined the Xuantian Dao Sect was because Long Chen was here.

They felt that cultivating in the same sect as Long Chen was a supreme honor. Actually personally interacting with him gave them a sense of grandeur.

Long Chen walked along the construction. He saw various Elders holding pieces of paper and calling out things that needed to be done or fixed.

These Elders all greeted Long Chen respectfully. Before, reaching the Soul Transformation realm would make one an Elder. Now, tens of thousands of Soul Transformation disciples had joined, each one of them far stronger than them. Hence, they couldn’t help but sigh. The world truly changed quickly.

They still had their status and duties as Elders. However, with their power, they were completely unqualified to teach these new disciples. In fact, some disciples gave them pointers.

Fortunately, these heavenly geniuses were all very humble and didn’t intentionally cause trouble. Otherwise, these Elders would feel even worse.

Geniuses were the most difficult people to look after. The reason they were so obedient in the Xuantian Dao Sect was because of two people: the old Xuan Master who was at the Netherpassage realm, and Long Chen who had dominated heavenly geniuses in his realm.

It was only thanks to their presence that the Xuantian Dao Sect was so peaceful. Although there were some conflicts between disciples, they rarely grew into huge fights. Mediating them was rather easy.

Seeing Long Chen return, quite a few disciples began to surround him, greeting him.

Long Chen had told the Dragonblood Legion to be friendly to these new disciples, but if they encountered any one irritating, there was no need to be courteous. For such people, they just had to beat them until they submitted.

Some of these new disciples had felt themselves to be very amazing, that they were second only to Long Chen. However, they learned their lesson quickly after a few beatings.

The Dragonblood warriors had said that they wouldn’t bully them. As long as they were in the same realm, then they could challenge the Dragonblood warriors ten to one, and the latter would accept.

The Dragonblood warriors accepted all challenges. The Xuantian Dao Sect had already constructed ten large martial stages for disciples to exchange pointers.

The martial stages had been packed for the first while. That was because before Long Chen had left for the Heaven Splitting Battle Sect, he had announced that any disciple that could defeat a Dragonblood warrior with the same cultivation base and Celestial rank could join the Dragonblood Legion.

However, ever since those martial stages were constructed, despite challenges coming in a never-ending stream, not one person managed to defeat a Dragonblood warrior in a one against one.

Let alone one against one, even ten against one, the Dragonblood warriors were undefeated. These heavenly geniuses had no choice but to submit. The Dragonblood warriors were too powerful. Their fierce auras made them shiver and prevented them from unleashing their full power.

Now they understood what true experts were. The Dragonblood warriors might normally be easy to get along with, but when they fought, they turned into beasts.

These disciples all felt the Dragonblood warriors to be true men, true heroes. The Dragonblood warriors would even teach them many fighting techniques without holding anything back.

Long Chen had a smile as he looked at the exceptionally lively martial stages, as well as the experts who were red in the face and crazily cheering. The current Xuantian Dao Sect was finally as lively as a true super sect should be.

“Long Chen, come over here.”

“Xuan Master, you were looking for me?”

Long Chen hastily climbed up a mountain. This mountain had just been formed, and the earth was still very fresh. There wasn’t even any vegetation yet.

At the top was a simple pavilion. Li Tianxuan was inside. He was looking at blueprints that were laid out on top of a stone table.

“Long Chen, this plan of yours is too big. We’ve encountered many difficulties already,” said Li Tianxuan. He was frowning.

This blueprint was something Long Chen had drawn. He had made some changes to the formation diagram that Xia Chen had sent over.

Long Chen wanted to reconstruct the Xuantian Dao Sect as one entity with the formation tying it all together. He had based this idea on the Mo Mountain Seal.

“Hehe, I know the difficulties are all based on spending money,” laughed Long Chen.

“It’s not spending money, it’s spending so much money that it’s ridiculous. Even ten times the estimate of the original amount isn’t enough.” Li Tianxuan bitterly smiled.

Originally, the formation and the reconstruction of the Xuantian Dao Sect would take around a hundred years. With the compensation Pill Valley had paid and their own wealth, they had enough to construct eighty percent of it.

Due to having a hundred years as a buffer, they could slowly think of something for the remaining twenty percent.

However, Long Chen wanted it built in one to two years. The cost had increased by ten times.

Then Long Chen had even said he wanted them to construct it as one solid entity and to even add an unimaginable supreme transportation formation that could transport the entire Xuantian Dao Sect. Even Li Tianxuan felt like he was going crazy.

As a sect leader, he had experienced much. However, Long Chen’s plans made him feel like his head would explode. This wasn’t spending money, this was burning money.

“It’s fine. I will handle the matter of money. I just had a talk with Zheng Wenlong and got some more money. Based on our current speed, it should be enough to last two to three months.” Long Chen handed Li Tianxuan a spatial ring.

Li Tianxuan looked inside and jumped in shock. “How is it possible that he could lend you so much money? I know how tight his pocket is lately.”

Li Tianxuan was different from Long Chen. He had a certain understanding of the entire continent’s movements.

Zheng Wenlong had taken over the Eastern Xuan Region’s business. He was very bold with his business and even started some new branches of neglected or unorthodox businesses. Li Tianxuan knew that this investment would take years or even decades to make a return. If he wanted those businesses to turn a profit, it would take even longer. He should currently be suffering a loss.

In other words, Zheng Wenlong shouldn’t have that many liquid assets. So Li Tianxuan was shocked Long Chen could take out so many spirit crystals.

“Zheng Wenlong’s very loyal, but I also won’t let him lose out. Just treat it as me owing him a favor, and I’ll pay him back in the future. Don’t worry about money. The reconstruction of the Xuantian Dao Sect is very important, especially the supreme transportation formation. You have to personally guard it. I don’t want a similar tragedy to befall us again,” said Long Chen.

“Alright, since you’re sure, I’ll listen to you. Don’t worry, this formation blueprint you’ve given me is something only I and my master have seen. Furthermore, I’ve split up the work in batches so people won’t be able to tell what exactly they’re constructing. I’ll handle the final portion of it myself so the outside world won’t learn of this secret,” said Li Tianxuan.

Long Chen was completely at ease with Li Tianxuan at the helm of this problem. Li Tianxuan was extremely meticulous.

“The only ones I’m worried about are those bastards from Heavenly Fate Island. I encountered one of them in the Eastern Wastelands...”

Long Chen told Li Tianxuan about the disciple of the Heavenly Fate Island who had brought his enemies to his parents. In the end, some old fellow had almost killed him through space.

However, the Divine Gate Star had activated in the end, forcing back that person’s power. Long Chen didn’t know the Divine Gate Star’s attack had ruined that elder’s technique that he had bitterly trained in.

“A mysterious elder?” Li Tianxuan’s expression became a bit grave. He was silent for a moment. “Heavenly Fate Island is very difficult to deal with. It seems they’re hiding countless old monsters. Since you couldn’t tell this elder’s cultivation base, there’s no way to know who it was. Heavenly Fate Island has countless secret arts, and one of them allows them to kill enemies through space as long as they have an intermediary. It’s a very strange and powerful technique. However, the Xuantian Dao Sect now has a Netherpassage expert sitting over it, as well as divine items protecting it. No matter how high his cultivation base, he wouldn’t dare to read our fate. After all, the Xuantian Dao Sect has risen. If he dared to do so, he would have to bear a huge amount of karma. None of them would dare to do such a thing.”

“I’m afraid they’ll try to read my fate and my next moves to scheme against the Xuantian Dao Sect,” said Long Chen worriedly.

“Read your fate?” Li Tianxuan laughed. “Don’t worry, there is no one in this world who would dare to read your fate unless they wanted to kill themselves.”

What kind of joke was that? The fate of a Heaven-Defier was something even the heavens couldn’t calculate.

Long Chen was startled. He wanted to ask Li Tianxuan more about this, but then he saw Li Tianxuan looking into the distance. His heart shook, and he didn’t ask his question.

Long Chen was more and more sure Li Tianxuan knew something about him. However, due to some rules, he was unable to say it clearly to him. He could only vaguely hint at it. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

Since Li Tianxuan guaranteed that Heavenly Fate Island couldn’t calculate anything about Long Chen directly, Long Chen was much more at ease. This meant that he wouldn’t need to have so many misgivings in the future. He could properly ‘get to know’ Heavenly Fate Island’s disciples.

With everything here handled by Li Tianxuan, Long Chen could follow through with his own matters at ease.

Long Chen asked for a private room within the Xuantian Tower. There, he spent three days writing various formulas and drawing bizarre diagrams. No one would be able to understand that these were symbols marking the merger of various medicinal ingredients. Long Chen needed to research this.

After three days, Long Chen had come up with four possible formulas for the Empyrean Pills. Of course, the main ingredient of the Empyrean Pill was an Empyrean Heavenly Dao Fruit.

“Hehe, this should work. If it does, the Dragonblood Legion is really going to soar and dominate the Martial Heaven Continent.”
