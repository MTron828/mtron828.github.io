Chapter 3704 Earth Evasion Talisman

“How much for this bracelet?” One of the female disciples by Yu Qingxuan’s side suddenly picked up a bracelet on a stall.Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

“You’re really interested? Then I’ll give you the real price. Five thousand immortal king crystals. No haggling.” The seller eyed her for a moment before giving a firm price.

After a while, the bracelet entered Long Chen’s hand, and he gave it to her.

“Senior apprentice-brother Long Chen, you’re so amazing! You actually got it for fifteen hundred! You saved me thirty-five hundred immortal king crystals. That’s half a year’s earning for me,” thanked the woman excitedly.

Originally, seeing how firm the seller was, she had thought that this was already the lowest price. She had been attracted to how beautiful the bracelet was, and since it was a top grade King item, she really had been about to buy it for five thousand immortal king crystals.

However, Long Chen immediately noticed that the seller was taking advantage of her lack of experience, so he helped her haggle. In the end, he got it for fifteen hundred. Everyone was stunned. His way of haggling was amazingly efficient.

“Senior apprentice-brother Long Chen, can you teach us how to haggle like you?” asked another female disciple worshipfully. They also wanted to buy some things, but this was their first time outside their empire. They didn’t know how to haggle. After seeing how amazing Long Chen was, they wanted to learn as well.

Yu Qingxuan smiled. Long Chen had won over these disciples so quickly. Although Long Chen was surrounded by countless halos of light, it seemed that he didn’t care about those statuses. He was never arrogant. Just this one point made their characters very similar.

Seeing so many disciples looking at Long Chen excitedly, not treating him like an outsider at all, it only proved his charisma.

Long Chen coughed and put on the air of an extremely experienced bargainer. “Actually, there are many elements to haggling. When it comes to weighing the other side’s words and expressions to deduce the real price, it would be too difficult to learn without a certain amount of effort. But that’s alright. I have a very quick method to teach you. Although it won’t make you haggling experts, at least you won’t be slaughtered by scammers.”

“Senior apprentice-brother, tell us! We want to know!” Everyone cried out excitedly.

Long Chen solemnly said, “In truth, the most important thing in haggling is to not care about face. If they dare to ask for five thousand, I dare to ask for five hundred! When I offer a price of five hundred, they curse me, but cursing me is fine. It’s a good thing. What is there to be afraid of? The only thing to be afraid of is them suddenly saying deal! Then that means that I got scammed. Why didn’t I only offer fifty?”

Long Chen gestured as he spoke, even putting on two different personas. Everyone then laughed, feeling like he was a comedian.

However, this explanation was also easy for them to understand. There was no lower limit when haggling. As long as they were shameless, they wouldn’t lose out.

As a result, these disciples began to look at Yu Qingxuan urgently. She helplessly sighed, “Feel free to do as you please. But take care of yourselves. Don’t run too far, and make sure to take out your tablets. If anything happens, immediately send out a signal.”

“Many thanks, princess!” Everyone was delighted and ran off.

“Hey, don’t go too crazy! If eunuch Wei suddenly returns and sees that I let you all off, we’ll all be scolded!” warned Yu Qingxuan.

“Don’t worry princess, we’ll be back quickly! We won’t make things hard on you.” One of the female disciples giggled and then dispersed through the stalls with everyone else.

Yu Qingxuan looked at those people that were like horses that had thrown off their reins, and she shook her head. Looking at the smiling Long Chen, she couldn’t help saying, “It’s all your fault! I bet that they’ll end up squandering all the money that they have.”

These disciples were used to following the rules in the Vermilion Bird Empire. Now that they were free, seeing all the new things around them, they would definitely buy quite a few things. The main worry was that they would use up all their money without buying anything useful.

Long Chen smiled. ”Who can say when it comes to luck? Who dares to say that they won’t find some useful treasure? Furthermore, if a person doesn’t lose a little in life, would that still be called life? An expert always has to pay a tuition fee to become an expert. Suffering and losing is the tuition fee.”

“Well, I can’t beat you in an argument.” Yu Qingxuan helplessly smiled. Long Chen sometimes said things that were clearly fallacious, yet she found herself unable to retort.

When the two of them arrived where Guo Ran and Xia Chen were, they found that the two of them had almost sold off everything. Of thousands of talismans, only a few dozen remained. As for Guo Ran’s wares, not one remained.

“Greetings, miss Qingxuan!”

When they arrived, Guo Ran and Xia Chen hastily rose and bowed to Yu Qingxuan. Long Chen had already told them not to mention what had happened on the Martial Heaven Continent and to act like it was their first time meeting.

Yu Qingxuan returned their greeting. Long Chen then said, “Let me introduce you. This is Guo Ran, a prodigy Forging Master, and this is Xia Chen, a truly talented Talisman Master. Both of them are my life-and-death brothers.”

After a few polite words from both sides, Guo Ran said, “Boss, can you help us look after our stall? We want to look around.”

“You want me to look after this?” Long Chen almost didn’t dare to believe his ears.

“Yes. We’ve already sold our things. Xia Chen and I made quite a bit of money and are going to look for things that we need. We’ll also be looking to see if we can take advantage of people’s inventories to buy low and sell high.” Guo Ran shrugged.

There was no way around it. Both of them had good things in their hands, and any professional could tell. Although the price was a bit high, those were life-saving treasures, so they were quickly snatched up.

As this was their first time doing such business, they hadn’t expected their business to be so prosperous. Now they wanted to spend their new wealth.

Long Chen helplessly sent them off, looking after their stall. Both of them then ran off happily, vanishing without a trace.

“Long Chen, why do I feel a bit odd when those two brothers of yours looked at me?” Yu Qingxuan couldn’t help asking when it was just the two of them alone.

Of course, it was odd. Seeing that Yu Qingxuan didn’t recognize them, Xia Chen and Guo Ran both felt strange. Afraid of exposing themselves, they then slipped away.

“They don’t have much experience. They’ve never seen such beauty, so they didn’t dare to look at you,” said Long Chen with a smile.

Yu Qingxuan rolled her eyes, knowing that this was nonsense. But she didn’t pursue the topic.

“How much for this Earth Evasion Talisman?” Suddenly, a girl walked over and pointed at a talisman.

“A thousand immortal king crystals,” said Long Chen. In truth, the Earth Evasion Talisman normally sold for around seven hundred on the marketplace. But prices were definitely a bit higher here.

“Five hundred,” said the girl.

“Damn, what a ruthless haggler!” Long Chen couldn’t help laughing. This girl was just randomly putting out a price. She had no idea of the market price of this talisman.

Seeing her bargain, Yu Qingxuan smiled. “Your way of haggling is even more ruthless. It’s not bad for her to not ask for a hundred.”

“My mom said that she wanted it for half price,” said the girl uneasily. It seemed that she really didn’t have any experience.

“Is that so? Alright, let’s start over. Ask me again,” said Long Chen.

The girl obediently pointed at the talisman and asked, “How much for this Earth Evasion Talisman?”

“Two thousand! Go ahead and haggle,” urged Long Chen.

The girl was dumbfounded. “Then… one thousand?”

“Deal!”

Long Chen handed the girl the Earth Evasion Talisman.
