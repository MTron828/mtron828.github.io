Chapter 2418 A Strange Sneak Attack

Translator: BornToBe

“Senior, you should stay here to prevent the worst-case scenario. I’ll go up,” said Long Chen.

The family head nodded. “Alright, Nian-er’s safety is number one. I’ll leave things to you.”

Although this was the most hidden part of the Mo family’s ancestral land, the family head had to be careful. He and Liu Zongying stayed behind, while Long Chen and Mo Yi flew off. They passed through the layers of blockades.

BOOM!

The Mo family’s grand formation shattered. A giant arrow shot toward the Mo family’s main palace.

“Courting death!”

Someone really was attacking the Mo family. Seeing that giant arrow, Long Chen appeared beside it and grabbed it.

This was an exploding arrow that had reached the heart of the Mo family. If it exploded here, it would kill quite a few people.

Long Chen was about to send it into the primal chaos space, but just at that moment, his expression changed. Killing intent raged in his eyes.

BOOM!

The arrow exploded. It was actually being controlled by someone, so it didn’t need to crash into something to explode.

Countless fragments shot out of it, but those were blasted into powder by Long Chen.

Despite that, a qi wave spread in every direction. The closest buildings were crushed, and countless experts of the Mo family coughed up blood, with some who were too close directly dying from the shockwave. This exploding arrow was an extremely terrifying killing tool.

“Protect old man Mo Yi,” ordered Long Chen, already shooting off in a certain direction.

In a single step, Long Chen saw a group of people in a giant flying boat rushing away.

The people on that flying boat were wearing robes of the ancient family alliance. Upon seeing Long Chen, they didn’t hesitate. All the giant ballistas on the flying boat pointed toward him.

“Fire!”

One arrow after another shot through the air. Explosions shook the sky as they exploded on contact with Long Chen.

“Let’s go!” The elder who had given the order to fire immediately ordered them to retreat without even looking at the result. The flying boat transformed into a streak of light.

BOOM!

However, that flying boat was suddenly cut in two by black saber-light. The experts at the center of the flying boat were wiped out of existence.

“Want to go? Leave your lives behind first.” Long Chen sneered and flew toward the elder.

This sneak attack against the Mo family was bizarre. This leader of theirs was only a third step Netherpassage expert. They didn’t have the power to attack the Mo family. This was clearly courting death.

Suddenly, the surrounding land exploded. Sword Qi shot out from every direction at Long Chen.

“A formation?” Long Chen was surprised. This was a trap. Every ray of Sword Qi was on par with the attack of a fourth step Netherpassage expert. This killing formation had been set up far in advance.

“Long Chen, your death is at hand!” The elder laughed. His terrified expression had been an act.

The dozen rays of Sword Qi intersected with Long Chen at the center. A blinding light filled this place.

Thousands of experts began to come out of the surrounding mountains and rush over.

“Quick, see if you can find Long Chen’s corpse! It would be best if he’s still alive!” shouted the elder.

The elder took out another flying boat. At this moment, the Mo family’s experts were rushing over.

Space was still twisting violently from the formation’s attack. People didn’t dare to get close.

“It would be best if I was alive? Then you can die.” Long Chen’s icy voice suddenly rang out.

Like a curse from hell, those experts froze. Then, without a second thought, they fled. At that moment, a pill furnace slowly appeared within the twisting space.

This was the Demon Moon Furnace. Those attacks weren’t something that Long Chen’s physical body could endure, so he had simply summoned the Demon Moon Furnace. Having been tempered by the karmic hell flames, it blocked those attacks without any effort at all.

“Are you in such a rush? I’ll send you on your way quickly.” Long Chen snorted. The runes on top of the Demon Moon Furnace lit up. Flame arrows shot out.

The experts flying were rapidly struck and incinerated without being able to scream. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

As for the elder on the flying boat, he had fled as soon as Long Chen’s voice had appeared. By the time Long Chen was done killing the other experts, the elder had vanished. His flying boat was very fast.

Long Chen put away the Demon Moon Furnace. Lightning wings appeared on his back.

“Long Chen, you should not chase a cornered enemy.” Mo Yi’s voice rang out from behind him. He was worried that there would be even worse traps up ahead. He had also realized that the sneak attack on the Mo family had occurred only because their real target was Long Chen.

“Don’t worry about me. I’m confident.” Long Chen vanished.

A cornered enemy? No, it was a rich enemy. Long Chen accelerated, quickly managing to sense the flying boat.

However, he chose not to charge onto the flying boat. Instead, he maintained a distance where he could sense the flying boat, but it couldn’t sense him.

Since their target was him, there wouldn’t be a follow-up attack on the Mo family. What he wanted to know was what drug his enemy had taken to do this.

Following the flying boat, he realized that they were going straight to the headquarters of the ancient family alliance.

“Di Feng, your guts are getting bigger.”

The ancient family alliance’s headquarters was located in a desert within the Central Plains. This desert had a certain oasis that was like an island within a sea of sand, and it was covered by a giant formation.

The flying boat reached the oasis and slipped through the formation. Ripples appeared on the barrier before it accepted its pass.

When Long Chen arrived, the formation rumbled, and countless runic swords condensed on top of the formation, pointing at Long Chen.

“Who goes there?!”

Countless experts of the ancient family alliance appeared, their weapons pointed at Long Chen.

“I want to say that I’m your dad, but I feel like that would be insulting myself. Do you not know who I am? Why ask?” Long Chen looked coldly at the head of these guards, who was a Netherpassage disciple.

Perhaps there might be some members of the senior generation who didn’t know him. Some old monsters would go into seclusion for decades or centuries. It was normal for them to not know of him.

However, a young disciple of the current generation? It was impossible that he didn’t recognize Long Chen.

“Long Chen, what are you doing here?” demanded that disciple.

To say that he wasn’t afraid in front of Long Chen would be a lie. He was a figure that terrified the Martial Heaven Continent the most. Once he was enraged, he dared to do anything. Many people who had thought themselves powerful had died to him.

Although they were also new Netherpassage experts just like Long Chen, compared to him, they were as weak as ants. Long Chen could wipe them out with a wave of his hand.

However, as members of the ancient family alliance, they refused to look too weak.

“I won’t make things hard on you. Tell Di Long and Di Feng that daddy Long has come. If they don’t come out, I’ll go in myself to find them. But my temper is not very good, so I might kill some people I don’t like on the way. I’ll give you ten breaths’ time. As for what they choose, I don’t care,” said Long Chen coldly.

In truth, there was no need for these disciples to report it. Someone had to have reported it as soon as he arrived. But Long Chen was still giving them some time to prepare.

After a moment, Long Chen slowly walked closer to the formation, causing those disciples’ expressions to change.

“Long Chen, what are you doing?!”

“Time’s up. If you don’t want to die, get out of the way. Of course, if you want to become martyrs, I don’t mind helping you achieve that goal.”

Long Chen raised Evilmoon. A giant saber-image condensed in the sky.

Those disciples instantly fled. They didn’t dare to block Long Chen.

“Long Chen, don’t you think your bullying has gone a bit too far this time?”

A group of people flew over, with Di Long and Di Feng at the front. There was another person with them that surprised Long Chen. A flash of comprehension appeared in his eyes.

“Long Chen, what are you doing?”

It was Feng Fei. She was frowning at Long Chen, seemingly disgusted with his current actions.

Long Chen indifferently spat out, “Killing people.”
