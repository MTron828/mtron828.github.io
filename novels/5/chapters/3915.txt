Chapter 3904 Meng Qi Arrives

At this moment, a brilliant bird cry rang out. It was a sound that seemed to come from all the way back in the desolate era. It penetrated people to the depths of their souls, awakening their most primal fear.

This was an absolutely enormous beast, but it was so fast, akin to a bolt of lightning.

This divine bird had spat out a black ray of divine light that sent Weng Tianyao flying back. And before he could react in any way, a heaven-covering wing slammed down upon him.

Before the wing landed, its berserk power already caused the void to collapse and astral winds to unfurl. Seeing this scene, countless people fled in terror.

Facing this attack, Weng Tianyao shouted and took out an ancient tower. As the tower rapidly grew, it was like a mountain protecting him.

Weng Tianyao had possessed two priceless treasures. One was his lightning sword, the Wild Blade. The other was this lightning tower.

Since the Wild Blade had been taken by Lei Linger, now he only had this tower. But this tower was also an exceedingly terrifying divine item with immense power.

At this moment, the tower’s lightning surged out, blocking this giant wing.

BOOM!

The impact caused the world to shudder. The next moment, both the giant bird and the tower were knocked back.

The tower smashed into the ground, directly blowing apart some experts that couldn’t flee in time. Even city lords were as weak as ants in front of this power.

As for the divine bird, its wings slammed into the air, and it instantly stabilized its body. Only then did people see that it was a black, sparrow-shaped bird. Only its wings were covered in silver feathers.

“Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow? Or is it a mutated species?” exclaimed the Violet Pupil Nine Tail Demon Fox.

When this divine bird descended, people saw a beautiful woman standing atop it. She was so beautiful that it looked like she had walked out of a painting, possessing a grandeur that made her seem transcendent, untouched by the mortal world of dust. The entire world became a wonderland due to her very existence, as she possessed a fantasy-like splendor around her.

Bai Shishi considered herself peerless in terms of looks, but when she saw this beautiful woman, she couldn’t help feeling inferior. This woman was like beautiful jade untouched by a single impurity. It was like all the world’s beauty was concentrated in her.

“Big sister Meng Qi!”

When that peerless beauty appeared, Guo Ran, Xia Chen, and the rest of the Dragonblood Legion unleashed heaven-shaking cheers.

Suddenly, the divine bird that she was on vanished, transforming into a beautiful maiden who appeared to be around thirteen years old. Clad in a black dress whose sleeves possessed a silver light, her deep eyes were filled with delight.

“Cloud!”

Guo Ran and the others instantly recognized her. Although her appearance had changed a bit, they still recognized her aura.

Meng Qi didn’t seem to hear everyone’s cheers. Instead, she was staring in disbelief at the Pill Fairy.

“Qingxuan… Is it really you?” Meng Qi was filled with so much emotion that her voice quivered with a sobbing tone.

“Big sister, do you know me?”

The Pill Fairy stared blankly at the peerlessly beautiful Meng Qi.

Meng Qi smiled. Her eyes were wet, but her voice was delighted. “That’s not important. What’s important is that you are you.”

Just as the Pill Fairy was distracted, Shi Yang found an opportunity to charge through their blockade. He shot toward Long Chen.

“Scram!”

A cute cry rang out. After that, an enormous figure descended upon Shi Yang like lightning, its wing slashing toward him like a blade. It was Cloud who had shot over instantaneously.

Shi Yang was sent tumbling back by her. As for Cloud, she also staggered facing Shi Yang’s power. However, all on her own, she had managed to force Shi Yang back, showing a display that was enough to shock everyone.

Cloud then spread her wings, and her claws struck Shi Yang like lightning, leaving Shi Yang feeling shocked and enraged. Long Chen’s side was gaining more and more experts, and all these reinforcements were incredibly powerful. He was getting uneasy.

Hence, he attacked Cloud frantically. After exchanging a dozen blows, Cloud was gradually forced back. This immemorial devil corpse that he was controlling was just too powerful. After all, Cloud was only in the Immortal King realm and was naturally at a disadvantage.

BOOM

Cloud suddenly opened her mouth, unleashing a ray of black light that directly struck Shi Yang in the chest. As a result, Shi Yang felt an irresistible force send him flying.

Shi Yang’s body was blasted back by the black light, leaving a long ditch in the ground. Any experts in his path were directly crushed.

Since Cloud couldn’t beat him in terms of the physical body, she directly switched to unleashing one of her divine abilities. Caught off-guard, Shi Yang was sent flying.

When Shi Yang stood up once again, he coughed up blood. For the first time ever since controlling this corpse, Shi Yang coughed up blood.

Guo Ran and the others were surprised by this and overjoyed. Cloud was truly terrifying, being able to directly harm Shi Yang at his core. It had to be known that even Bai Shishi’s attack that had severed his wings couldn’t harm his core.

Even with so many people attacking him together, just to find his weakness or to exhaust him, they had been unable to succeed. Unexpectedly, it was Cloud’s attack that was the first to truly injure Shi Yang.

“Good job, Cloud! Kill that fellow!” Xia Chen cried out in delight. As long as they could eliminate Shi Yang, everything would be easier.

Cloud let out a loud bird cry. In an instant, her enormous figure appeared in front of Shi Yang, her claws reaching toward him like hooks.

Cloud let out a torrent of attacks, forcing Shi Yang back repeatedly. She would occasionally spit out more rays of divine light, and Shi Yang tried to dodge them but couldn’t. As a result, he was quickly covered in various wounds and constantly spitting out blood.

Unexpectedly, Cloud’s innate divine ability was able to seriously harm Shi Yang. It seemed that his devil corpse was perfectly countered by Cloud.

Shi Yang roared furiously, but he had no way to counterattack. Although he was in control of this corpse, with his cultivation base, he couldn’t activate its divine abilities. He was only capable of fighting with the most basic physical attacks.

On the other hand, Cloud’s attack contained a special bloodline power, causing damage with every blow. Now, Shi Yang began to panic, but he couldn’t think of any solution.

Most infuriating of all, despite her enormous size, Cloud wasn’t clumsy at all. She was as quick as lightning. Not being able to run from her or beat her, Shi Yang could only grit his teeth.

BOOM!

At the core of the battlefield, Weng Tianyao had reached the Dragonblood Legion with his lightning tower, planning on directly barging through.

But at this moment, a pair of snow-white, slender hands directly landed on the lightning tower.
