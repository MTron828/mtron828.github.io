Chapter 3927 Violet Blood Seal Release

BOOM!

The stone stele split apart as the bronze cauldron forcibly broke it, delighting Li Chenggang. He immediately put the broken stele away.

“Brother Long, no words can express my gratitude. I, Li Chenggang, owe you a huge debt.”

However, Long Chen was already gone. After smashing the stele, he left without even saying goodbye.𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

Long Chen had wondered why he didn’t see Li Chenggang in that battle, so Li Chenggang didn’t even want to go there. It seemed that he felt that he had found a priceless treasure.

Regretfully, that stele wasn’t something that Li Chenggang could consume on his own. Without Long Chen, he probably wouldn’t have gotten anything.

Li Chenggang’s aura was still similar to before. Most likely, after finding the stele, he was only thinking about taking it and didn’t even go to absorb primal chaos qi. All his efforts were on the stele.

Since Li Chenggang had done so, then there must be some concealed areas within the three thousand worlds that had attracted some other geniuses. Not all the heavenly geniuses in the three thousand worlds had gone to that final battle and died.

The space around Long Chen was shaking, with the whirlpool growing stronger and stronger. The three thousand worlds were about to heal, and the expulsion force got stronger.

It was unknown if it was because Long Chen had almost destroyed the three thousand worlds, but their expulsion force was incredibly strong. Long Chen’s speed was severely constrained by it as the space around him seemed to grow solid.

Long Chen then let out a punch, shattering the space around him. When the pressure lightened, he directly shot out.

He repeatedly struck the void, shattering space and throwing the laws of heaven and earth into chaos. Only then was he capable of passing through this world.

“Boss!”

Long Chen finally saw the Dragonblood Legion in the distance, joining forces to resist the spatial energy that was sending them away.

“Brothers, go. Cultivate well. We didn’t have a chance this time, but next time we meet, let us drink until the world flips!” shouted Long Chen.

As the spatial power grew, the Dragonblood Legion’s barrier was quickly shattered, drawing the Dragonblood warriors away.

“Boss, take care. When we meet again, we’ll flip heaven and earth! The name of the Dragonblood Legion will ring throughout every corner of the world…!”

The Dragonblood warriors shouted back at Long Chen, weeping. They had just met again but had to be separated like this. They didn’t even get a chance to speak with each other, so all of them felt aggrieved.

“We will, we definitely will! The Dragonblood Legion was number one on the Martial Heaven Continent, and we’ll also be number one in the nine heavens and ten lands!” roared Long Chen.

The Dragonblood warriors vanished. After that, Bai Shishi, Dong Mingyu, Yue Xiaoqian, and Cloud all waved at Long Chen as they unwillingly left.

Little Snow also roared at Long Chen; that roar contained endless emotions.

“Long Chen, promise me that you’ll look after Qingxuan. I hope that the next time we meet, she will be openly married to you.” Meng Qi looked at Long Chen emotionally.

“Sister…!” The Pill Fairy blushed. She liked Long Chen and also knew that Long Chen had many women close to him, but these words made her quiver.

In the immortal world, cultivators didn’t have as many restrictions as in the mortal world. As long as you were strong enough, you could have countless Dao-companions. But rarely would people wed.

Hence, a wedding could be considered a grand ceremony that would draw the blessing of the Heavenly Daos. Whether it was the man or the woman, they would receive a blessing, but they could only receive it once.

With these words, Meng Qi completely won over Yu Qingxuan and Bai Shishi. Bai Shishi in particular knew that Meng Qi was Long Chen’s to-be-wed wife.

For Meng Qi to actually give up the position of this blessing for the Pill Fairy was an immense sacrifice. She was giving up her number one spot, so Bai Shishi could only stare at her in disbelief. On the other hand, the Pill Fairy was so panicked that she didn’t know what to say.

“Meng Qi…!” Long Chen almost wept. For Meng Qi to sacrifice this much for him, he realized he would never be able to repay her. To have won over such a woman was akin to receiving a multitude of blessings across countless lifetimes. He understood what she was saying, and that was why he felt even guiltier.

When it came to his multiple women, Long Chen felt blessed enough to die. But he also felt so guilty toward them. He had no idea how he was supposed to repay them for their feelings.

Meng Qi smiled. Her smile was so beautiful that it was like the world had suddenly brightened. “No matter how much I sacrifice, how can it compare to undergoing a thousand reincarnations? Just listen to me. I believe that with your smarts and abilities, no matter what dangers you encounter, you can allow Qingxuan to marry you in a blessed ceremony. That is the only way to repay her for her feelings…”

Just then, the world shook. The scars that Long Chen, Kun Tu, and Long Aotian had torn into the world finally healed. After that, an intense force sent them away.

Meng Qi, Bai Shishi, Yue Xiaoqian, Cloud, Little Snow, Gu Yang, Yue Zifeng, Li Qi, Song Mingyuan, Bai Xiaole, and the others had been holding on, but now they were all sent away without being able to speak.

In the end, only Mo Nian remained with Long Chen. He shook his head at him and said, “Staying with you really is unlucky. I didn’t get anything in the heavenly tomb, instead I almost lost my life. Then I had to protect you during this battle and didn’t get a chance to show off. In the end, you even fed me some dog food. Tell me, what am I supposed to say to you?”

Long Chen asked, “Didn’t you get that sickle from the Netherworld?”

“Tch, who do you think I am? I have always been someone who eats the big fish, the big meat. I don’t even care about such small fry. Well, next time, I’m not looking after you. I want my name to resound throughout the land. This time, it was a failure. I feel quite bad about being made a side character,” said Mo Nian irritably.

“Alright, don’t cry like that. Fine, next time when you have a chance to show off, I’ll play a supporting role for you,” promised Long Chen.

“Hahaha, that’s what I was waiting for. Good, then I’ll inform you beforehand of that chance!” Mo Nian laughed and also vanished.

Long Chen also couldn’t hold on as a powerful suction force dragged him out of the three thousand worlds.

BOOM!

Long Chen had just vanished when, in another world, the void exploded and two doors on a gate opened. After that, violet qi gushed out of the gate.

“Finally… success!”

Luo Zichuan looked at the opened gate emotionally. Long Aotian was in his hand, as pale as paper as if all his essence blood had been extracted. Seeing this, Luo Zichuan just smiled and let go.

As soon as Luo Zichuan let go, Long Aotian’s body was dragged away by spatial energy and brought away.

After that, countless figures wrapped in violet qi walked out of the gate. They were all elders with astonishing auras.

“This unworthy one is Luo Zichuan. Greetings, ancestors!” Luo Zichuan respectfully knelt on the ground toward those elders.

“We’re out! We’re finally out! Child, you’ve accomplished a great service to my Violet Blood race. The Violet Blood race is making a return. Those who harmed us, just wait!”

Those elders looked around at this world and roared. Those roars were so powerful that the stars in the sky fell. It was many times stronger than Long Chen’s Dragon Roars at the Nine Heavens.
