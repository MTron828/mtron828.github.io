Chapter 4384 Three Realms of Eternity

All the Dragonblood warriors had participated in the battle against the red-haired monster, and before encountering it, they had swept through the Great Desolate World.

During that period, the Dragonblood warriors discovered that the Eternal experts were not invincible, and this shattered the mysterious mask of Eternal experts.

A few dozen ordinary Dragonblood warriors could block the attack of an Eternal expert. If over a hundred people joined forces, they even stood a chance of killing an Eternal expert.

As for the likes of Gu Yang, Li Qi, Song Mingyuan, Yue Zifeng, Guo Ran, and Xia Chen, they could kill Eternal experts one-on-one.

As their captains were capable of killing Eternal experts as soon as they entered the World King realm, the morale of the Dragonblood warriors soared to unprecedented heights. They even got a bit arrogant.

However, the arrival of the red-haired monster directly shattered their arrogance. It turned out there were still undefeatable existences for them within the Eternal realm.

The aura of the red-haired monster had clearly been that of an Eternal expert, but it was monstrously powerful. Ordinary Eternal experts were like ants in front of it.

That was why all the Dragonblood warriors listened closely for the answer to this question. They all wanted to know what kind of existence that monster was.

The palace master sank into thought. “This question of yours is a bit difficult for me to answer. In truth, when it comes to cultivation realms, I don’t really understand them. After all, my dragon race’s cultivation realms aren’t quite the same as those of other races, and I can’t explain my experiences to you. Based on the human race’s realms, the Eternal realm is split into three levels just like the Divine Venerate realm: there is the Mortal Venerate, the Earth Venerate, and the Heaven Venerate. However, in the Eternal realm, it’s a bit more muddled.

“The first realm is simply called the Eternal realm, where the concept of ‘eternity’ refers solely to the physical body. The physical body forms a resonance with the Heavenly Daos, and as long as someone doesn’t damage it, it can theoretically exist for as long as heaven and earth—if heaven and earth remain, the physical body will not decay. Therefore, this ‘eternity’ refers solely to the body not affected by the power of time. It does not signify an invincible body that cannot be destroyed or killed. If the physical body sustains damage, the ‘eternity’ is likewise impaired, and the power of time will once more induce decay. In that case, the Eternal expert will merely live longer.

“This first realm of Eternity is typically referred to as the Eternal realm, with one's Eternal energy concentrated in the body. The second realm of Eternity involves using the body as a foundation once it gets strong enough, and the Eternal energy is then squeezed out to ignite the fire of the soul, granting eternal life to the soul. An individual at this stage is known as a Saint.”

Hearing that, Long Chen and his companions realized why the red-haired monster kept calling itself a Saint. So it was in the second realm of Eternity.

“The red-haired monster just broke through to the second realm, and all its Eternal energy was squeezed into its soul. That was why it looked like a withered corpse. After all, breaking through to the second realm requires abandoning the first realm. The body’s Eternal energy will recover over time after reaching the second realm, but it was in the midst of that recovery when you interrupted its seclusion. That’s why you were able to destroy its head. If its physical body had fully recovered, breaking its head wouldn't have been so easy," explained the palace master.

“So it was all just luck. I’m ashamed,” admitted Long Chen, a tinge of fear creeping into him. He hadn’t expected to encounter such a terrifying enemy in the humanless world. He had thought that they could easily sweep through it just like in the Great Desolate World.Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

“It just became a Saint, and its physical body had yet to recover, so it was only able to use the power of its soul. That’s why despite being from the devil race, it could use hand seals like the human race and unleash magical arts. However, magical arts are not its forte. Its real strength lies in the devil race’s divine abilities. Yet, with its physical body weakened, it was unable to unleash those divine abilities. It could only be considered the weakest of all Saints. Even in its merged state, it was unable to unleash its true potential. Hence, I couldn’t be bothered to kill it. In truth, I hoped for it to recover so I could face it in the humanless world. There, it wouldn't be restrained by the Nirvana Overflow Heaven, and we could engage in a fair fight. I would make it pay the price for disrespecting the dragon race. However, the sweeping elder has already sent a message, so I don’t dare to tarry. To tell the truth, now I feel a bit regretful for not killing the two of them with a slap. I don’t know if I’ll ever get a chance to teach them a lesson,” sighed the palace master.

Now, he no longer had any of the air a palace master should have. He was just like a big brother complaining about stuff, and that made them feel even closer to him.

They found it comical yet also shocking. Based on what the palace master said, he had the confidence to beat the red-haired monster and the Red Fur Heaven Roarer in their peak state. If that were really the case, then he was truly powerful, so powerful that his power seemed boundless.

“Palace master, are you saying that the red-haired monster was the weakest Saint we could have encountered?” asked Xia Chen.

“I suppose so. After all, it had just depleted the Eternal power of its body to kindle the Eternal fire of its soul. It lacked the time to stabilize its realm and recover its Eternal energy. Otherwise, you wouldn’t have been able to flee from the humanless world, and I would have had to go in to save you,” said the palace master.

They felt deeply moved to hear that. Clearly, every action Long Chen took had been under the vigilant gaze of the palace master. He had been keeping watch over them the entire time.

“That’s why the next time you encounter a Saint, you should run as far as you can. After all, the difference in realm is immense. It’s not embarrassing to run,” the palace master advised solemnly. “Once the Eternal fire of the soul is kindled, a Saint possesses tremendous Spiritual Strength. You already witnessed how it could unleash devastating magical arts despite not specializing in them. If its physical body were in prime condition and it could use the devil race’s divine abilities that it specializes in, plus its Eternal Spiritual Strength, even all of you together would not be able to stop one attack from it. Furthermore, the most important thing is that a Saint has almost no weak points. Even if their physical body is destroyed, because their soul is Eternal, they can claim another body or just give birth to another one, and they can rapidly return to their peak. There are times when they feel that their body is too limiting, so they will seize someone else’s body. Long Chen, you would be an excellent candidate in their eyes. You have to be careful,” warned the palace master.

Long Chen’s heart trembled as he heard this warning. No wonder the red-haired monster remained unaffected even after losing its head. It seemed that after becoming a Saint, the physical body no longer possessed any weaknesses.

“Then how do you plan to deal with them?” asked Long Chen.

The palace master shook his head. “I don’t know either. In any case, if I wanted to kill a Saint, I would have to use my dark divine abilities. However, while I’m confident in defeating them, killing them is a different thing.”

Hearing this, Long Chen hesitated. He wanted to ask about the third realm—the realm above the Saint realm.

However, the formation suddenly lit up, and all conversation ceased as everyone directed their attention toward it. A thick spatial energy then enveloped them, and in an instant, they disappeared.
