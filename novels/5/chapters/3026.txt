Chapter 3015 Heaven Merging Stone Spirit

Following the path down, it was unknown just how far they went, but they suddenly heard a strange sound. That sound was light, and yet it made their hearts violently clench. Everyone’s expressions changed.

“What is that?”

It rang out once more. That sound was even clearer this time. Everyone’s hearts once more clenched.

“It seems to be… a heartbeat.” Long Chen was truly shocked. It most definitely sounded like a heartbeat.

“A heartbeat?”

For even the sound of a heart beating to be so unbearable, what kind of terrifying lifeform was it? DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

Bai Shishi was also shocked. She hadn’t expected such a terrifying existence to appear underground.

Everyone carefully continued forward. A portion of people were unable to endure it and felt like their hearts would jump out of their chests. They no longer dared to continue pressing forward. Long Chen ordered them to return to the surface, while the rest continued onwards.

It went without saying that the Heaven Female Alliance’s experts were truly powerful. Even though over a thousand people on Long Chen’s side were already unable to bear it, not one of those women retreated.

As they continued, the sound of the heartbeat grew louder, and they found it even harder to breathe. It felt as if their organs would be crushed. As a result, on Long Chen’s side, only about twenty people were able to continue. Those twenty people included Bai Xiaole, Mu Qingyun, Luo Bing, Luo Ning, Zhong Ling, Zhong Xiu, and Li Cai.

As for Bai Shishi’s side, they were now down to just over a hundred people. The rest all returned to the surface.

They finally arrived at a giant stone gate. There was a circular design on the gate. Long Chen and the others were pondering how to open it when a ray of light shot out of the circular design and illuminated the skeleton’s head.

A divine mark appeared on the skull, reflecting with that divine light. Following that, the stone gate began to tremble intensely.

The stone gate slowly opened. As it opened, the mark on the skull also faded. Once it fully vanished, the entire skeleton turned dim and seemed to go through countless years of erosion, transforming into dust.

Long Chen sighed inside. This person should be the final member of the Starry River Sect. He had to know many secrets, but hadn’t had a chance to write those secrets down before dying.

The Starry River Sky was destroyed. This person was filled with hatred over this, and through his last remains, he planted the seed of vengeance. This was quite similar to a nine star heir.

However, as a nine star heir, Long Chen still didn’t know just who he was supposed to find vengeance on. He even doubted whether he was a true nine star heir. He didn’t even have the complete inheritance.

When the door opened, the sound of the heartbeat grew even louder. Now it was like a star was repeatedly striking. Luo Bing and the others almost coughed up blood. They had to unleash all their power just to resist it.

Bai Shishi and Long Chen walked through together. Everyone else carefully followed behind them. Three hundred meters further, they saw a large fighting wring.

Standing at the edge of that fighting ring that was hundreds of miles long, they felt as tiny as ants. This fighting ring was already badly damaged with holes all over.

At the center of it was a three-hundred meter giant lying on the ground. Their entire body was covered in stone-like skin. Their stomach was still slowly rising and falling, as if they were sleeping.

That terrifying heartbeat sound was coming from it. With every heartbeat, the fighting ring shuddered.

Suddenly, a piece of stone on the edge of the fighting ring fell to the ground, transforming into a pile of broken bits. The insides of those fragments were golden with blood-colored lines throughout them.

“It’s actually Phoenix Blood Sand Gold. This entire fighting ring was made out of the best immortal materials. It’s too bad that too much time has passed. The gold sand’s energy has already been exhausted by the runes and turned to trash.” Bai Shishi sighed regretfully.

For a powerful metal cultivator like her, that Phoenix Blood Sand Gold was very valuable. That was why it was such a pity.

“That’s the Heaven Merging Stone Spirit. Pretty girl, it’s time for you to use your abilities,” said Long Chen as he looked at the giant.

“What did you call me?” Bai Shishi looked at Long Chen coldly. It seemed she had a great distaste for this appellation.

“What are you looking at me like that for? Calling you a pretty girl is praise! Why can’t you differentiate between good and bad?” Long Chen looked at Bai Shishi irritably.

“Exactly! My boss calling you pretty lady is because he looks favorably upon you. Not calling you snotty girl is already giving you face. You always had snot coming out of your nose when you were small. Don’t think that I don’t know!” exclaimed Bai Xiaole immediately when Long Chen and Bai Shishi started clashing.

“You little brat, do you need a spanking?!” Bai Shishi’s fury instantly soared.

Seeing her enraged, rather than being scared, Bai Xiaole grew even more zealous. “If I’m a brat, then you’re a brat too. What about it? Do you want to hit people? Come! I have a boss now! My boss even dares to beat our dad! Just try and touch him, and you’ll see that my boss doesn’t even care about you. My boss said that women like you should be turned into bed warmers, and if you don’t listen you should be beaten.”

Bai Xiaole’s words left everyone stunned. The Heaven Female Alliance’s disciples stared at Long Chen in disbelief.

Ignoring everyone else, even Long Chen’s own expression darkened. Just when had he ever said such a thing? This little fellow’s head had once more gotten off-kilter. Was he intentionally conning him?

“Did you really say that?” Bai Shishi glared at Long Chen hatefully.

The Heaven Female Alliance’s disciples clenched their fists. After following Bai Shishi for so long, this was actually their first time seeing her so angry. They prepared to fight.

“That’s right! Come! My boss isn’t afraid of you!” Just as Bai Xiaole was arrogantly shouting, Luo Ning covered his mouth.

“Fairy Shishi, don’t listen to Xiaole’s nonsense. Long Chen definitely never said such a thing,” explained Luo Ning hastily.

Luo Bing and the others were speechless. What kind of time was it for this nonsense? Could it be that the world of experts was truly so inexplicable?

“If I learn you said such a thing, I’ll beat you to a pulp,” said Bai Shishi coldly.

Long Chen was enraged. How could he have possibly said such a thing? She was essentially threatening him.

Without the slightest courtesy, he replied, “Whether or not I said that isn’t important. I just want to ask you, did you really have a snotty nose as a child? The kind where it flies out like noodles?”

“Scram.”

Bai Shishi’s eyebrows were vertical. A single word was spit out from the cracks between her teeth.

Just at this moment, the fighting ring shuddered. Luo Bing and the others stared in terror behind Long Chen and Bai Shishi.

The two of them also felt a chill, as if some terrifying thing was staring at them. They slowly turned around to find that the sleeping giant had actually stood up and was staring at them.

“Are you here to challenge me?”
