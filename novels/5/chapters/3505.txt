Chapter 3494

As the Minghong Saber rumbled, a saber cry shook the heavens. At the same time, a sharp Saber Qi came through the sheath and pierced the surrounding mountains.

The Minghong Saber’s aura was rapidly climbing, but after reaching a certain limit, it rebounded back, as if something was shackling it.

After that, saber-images randomly shot out, piercing the void, disturbing heaven and earth. A powerful saber will then raged, wishing to shatter apart the ten thousand Daos. The shackles were attacked over and over.

Long Chen was delighted. The Minghong Saber was trying to advance. After obtaining it, he had found that its sheath could absorb some mysterious energy from the body of slain experts to nourish the saber.

The Minghong Saber was originally a top grade King item. If it advanced again, it would be a World Domain divine item. This was a divine weapon capable of growth.

Suddenly, the saber came out of its sheath, slicing the heavens. As a result, a giant spatial crack appeared in the void and didn’t heal for a long time.

At that moment, the Minghong Saber let out a heaven-shaking cry that was like a roar. The saber cry echoed throughout heaven and earth over and over again.

Its sharpness overflowed and an arrogant will rose, just like a lofty expert looking down on the rest of the world.

It had finally broken free of the bindings of heaven and earth, advancing to become a World Domain divine item. Sensing its terrifying aura, Long Chen was incredibly excited.

The Minghong Saber then flew over and Long Chen caught it. A bloodline connection formed between the two of them. He felt endless confidence now, and it stemmed from the Minghong Saber.

Although he wasn’t a World King, the Minghong Saber recognized him as its master. It fully trusted him to control it.

“Now, even if I encounter a World Domain divine item, I don’t need to fear it!” Long Chen clenched the Minghong Saber excitedly.

He returned it to its sheath. Having just advanced, it had used up a great deal of energy. It wasn’t suitable to use it for battle right now and should rest for a bit in the sheath.

Long Chen patted it and smiled. “In the future, us brothers will walk through the world, eating as much meat and drinking as much soup as we want!”

Long Chen would be in charge of killing experts, and it would be in charge of absorbing their energy. One saber and one man would both continuously grow stronger. After losing Dragonbone Evilmoon, he had finally found another reliable partner.

The Minghong Saber let out a light cry as if replying to him. Long Chen laughed. Putting it on his back, he flew off.

He had caused too big of a disturbance here, so it wasn’t a good idea to stay any longer. He then found another more secluded area. After resting for a day, he was once more in his peak condition. Hence, he went to a small city and bought a map.

Only then did Long Chen learn that this place was called the Climbing Rain City and was still part of the Evergreen Prefecture. He hadn’t expected a single prefecture of the Violet Flame Heaven to be so big. It was even bigger than the nine prefectures where the academy was.

Very quickly, Long Chen noticed something off. Some people were staring at him in shock. They clearly recognized him.

“Black robes and a saber on his back. Isn’t that how Boss Long San dresses himself? Could this be him?” A startled cry suddenly rang out.

As soon as that person spoke, his companion beside him clapped a hand over his mouth, as if afraid that Long Chen would kill him for speaking.

With that person’s shout, countless gazes turned toward Long Chen. Quite a few people were eager to test him to see if he really was the genuine article, but they also didn’t dare to.

“Hey, can I ask how much money the Soaring Dragon Company has put on my head?” Long Chen looked at those people indifferently.

“Three hundred million immortal king crystals and a World Domain divine item. They will also receive the Soaring Dragon Company’s golden V.I.P. medal, forever receiving the protection of the Soaring Dragon company.” A young Divine Lord immediately answered Long Chen as if afraid that someone else would answer before him.

Before this, they had only suspected this youngster to be Boss Long San. His appearance, clothes, and cultivation base matched the description. But they didn’t dare to be sure.

After all, Boss Long San had a bounty on his head, and the entire Soaring Dragon Company was looking for him. According to reason, he should be in hiding and have changed his appearance. He wouldn’t be facing others so carelessly.

However, Long Chen had essentially told them that he was the true Boss Long San, so an uproar came from those experts. Of course, some of them were excited.

After all, these young cultivators saw that Long Chen was the same as them, a Divine Lord. But he was able to do such heaven-shaking things. So, they all worshiped him.

As the Violet Flame Heaven’s Heavenly Daos were more complete, there were countless heavenly geniuses here. In the Darklight Heaven, you would count as a genius if you were a Primal. But here, they were everywhere. In fact, non-Primals were so rare that they almost couldn’t be found.

The Violet Flame Heaven was filled with heavenly geniuses, and thus the competition between them was also incredibly intense. Everyone felt a natural reverence for the strong.

Hence, these disciples had no thoughts of capturing Long Chen. The difference was too great. Thus, they only felt reverence and curiosity toward him. Whatever he asked, they would naturally answer.

“Just that little amount of money? How stingy of the Soaring Dragon Company. In their treasury that I plundered, there are three World Domain divine items and at least a billion immortal king crystals. As for the other treasures, I couldn’t even be bothered to count them all. The Soaring Dragon Company’s money really is hard to earn,” sneered Long Chen.

Countless startled cries rang out when he said this. The Soaring Dragon Company actually didn’t mention that Long Chen had taken their treasury, so people were unaware of it. Now that Long Chen brought it up, their hearts pounded wildly.

“Boss Long San, you should quickly leave. Someone has definitely reported your arrival to the Soaring Dragon Company. Their experts will arrive soon,” warned one woman kindly.

Long Chen was wearing black robes, had a saber on his back, and his appearance was handsome enough to stand out. Adding on the halo of his new fame, countless female cultivators wished to see him. In the cultivation world, power was the greatest attraction. When you had power, it was all too easy to win other people’s good opinions.

The youngsters didn’t wish for Long Chen to die here. Thus, they hoped that he would leave quickly. But some World Kings in hiding were already starting to stealthily concentrate their powers. They were clearly willing to die for wealth. Unable to resist the allure of the bounty, they were preparing to take a risk.

“That’s fine. The Soaring Dragon Company and I are now tied together. They won’t let me off, but I also won’t let them off. Boss Long San is already indifferent to life and death. I don’t mind fighting to the death!” said Long Chen with a faint smile.

At this time, Long Chen walked to a spacious area in the city. This was a large plaza, and at the center was a transportation formation. It was the largest of the city’s four transportation formations.

“Hmph, how laughable. You say such big words, but aren’t you preparing to tuck your tail in and flee?” Just then, a cold sneer rang out. The voice was full of disdain and provocation.

However, the speaker didn’t reveal himself. They hid, with only their voice resounding loudly throughout the plaza, making it impossible to tell where the voice came from.

The next moment, Long Chen suddenly vanished and the crowd cried out in shock. They then saw an elder dragged into the air, with Long Chen’s hand around his throat.

“A World King!” Startled cries rang out. They recognized this elder. He was a sect master.Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates
