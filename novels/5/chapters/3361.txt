Chapter 3350 Ghost Dao Mark

The next day, Luo Changwen came. With the help of the Heavenly Dao Fruits, he also became an Earth tier Immortal King.

As a result, the Luo family now had two Earth tier Immortal Kings, and they could slowly advance to the ninth Heavenstage of the Immortal King realm.

Although they weren’t qualified to reach the full circle of the Immortal King realm yet, they were already supreme existences within the Heavenly Swell Domain. With two Earth tier Immortal Kings standing guard over it, the Luo family’s position was as steady as a mountain.

Furthermore, Long Chen also took out nine thousand of the ordinary Heavenly Dao Fruit for them, letting them raise even more elite disciples.

As the Luo family had the Honing Heavenly Staircase, their disciples had stronger wills than ordinary disciples. Hence, the warriors that they raised could be said to be unafraid of death.

When they awakened primal bloodlines, it also awakened their violet qi. Hence, the Luo family’s disciples could directly become elites amongst elites with the aid of the Heavenly Dao Fruits.

Also, these Heavenly Dao Fruits would be useless in Long Chen’s hands for now, so it was better to use them up quickly. After all, equipping the Luo family was like equipping himself.

However, they couldn’t make any huge moves. So, these nine thousand disciples stayed in the Luo family’s secret training room. It was best to keep them there for now without exposing them.

As for the matter of Four Peak Pills, there was no need to worry. While rebuilding the seventh branch academy, Zheng Wenlong had gotten Long Chen a King item pill furnace, one that was newly forged and hadn’t had a spirit awoken in it yet.

Long Chen then had the Moon and Star Refining Furnace’s item-spirit enter it. With Huo Linger’s help, it quickly merged with it. It then refined pills every day, growing stronger and stronger. A huge number of Four Peak Pills were being refined.

Most importantly, the Demon Moon Furnace’s item-spirit had finished merging with the Daynight Furnace’s item-spirit. So, the Daynight Furnace had been demonized, becoming the Demon Moon Furnace.

Just half a month ago, the Demon Moon Furnace started refining pills. However, the pills that she refined were low grade demonic pills. They were filled with impurities, and consuming them would be detrimental to the body.

But after a few days of refining, the Demon Moon Furnace’s item-spirit grew stronger until she could control the Demon Moon Furnace, and the demonic pills increased in quality.

Just yesterday, Ling-er communicated spiritually with Long Chen. She was finally awake after being in slumber for so long.

However, she had merged with the original item-spirit of the Daynight Furnace, so she felt both foreign and familiar to Long Chen.

Long Chen knew that Ling-er’s power would only continue to grow. She would occupy the main consciousness and would gradually become her old self.

The strengthened Demon Moon Furnace began to refine Peakless Pills for Long Chen. Although the number was a bit low, with her only being able to refine a few furnaces of pills a day, all of them were demonic pills.

Demonic pills were violent and explosive. Their medicinal energy was something that would directly make someone explode if they consumed one.

Fortunately, Long Chen’s physical body was tough enough to endure it. Furthermore, he found that the Demon Moon Furnace’s Peakless Pills were actually even more suitable for his cultivation.

Thus, Long Chen left the Peakless Pills to be refined by the Demon Moon Furnace, while the Moon and Star Refining Furnace got to refine Four Peak Pills. Now, he had mountains of Four Peak Pills, too many for him to even use up.

The Moon and Star Refining Furnace was working day and night, strengthening itself daily. Although Long Chen didn’t have time to teach it how to refine different medicinal pills, there was no need for such a thing. So, he just let it continue refining.

As they cultivated, they brought Long Chen an endless supply of medicinal pills. If he couldn’t use them up, he could give them to Zheng Wenlong to sell. So, it could be said that the two furnaces had become bottomless cornucopias for Long Chen.

After this was arranged, Long Chen finally sighed with relief. He then went to the rear mountains of the academy.Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

“Zhantang, have you noticed…?”

After returning to the main academy, Bai Xiaole’s mother, who had wanted to mention something several times but had stopped in the end, finally couldn’t hold back any longer.

“I noticed.” Bai Zhantang nodded.

“Why didn’t you warn him? The Ghost Dao has already set its sights on him, but he doesn’t know it. If you don’t warn him, something terrible will probably befall him in the near future,” said Bai Xiaole’s mother.

Bai Shishi’s mother was startled. Only she hadn’t noticed anything odd. She asked, “Long Chen is in danger from the Ghost Dao? Is it because of the Ghost Ship?”

Bai Shishi had not mentioned the Ghost Ship as she knew that it was a bizarre existence. Long Chen had also said that it would be best not to bring it up to avoid bringing karma to others.

However, while Bai Shishi kept quiet, Bai Xiaole was different. When Long Chen and Bai Shishi weren’t present, he brought this up in front of his parents to prove just how big his guts were. At that time, they were terrified by what they were hearing. Long Chen’s guts were truly too big to even dare to climb up a Ghost Ship.

Seeing their shock, Bai Xiaole was even more pleased and brought up how Long Chen had stolen a golden sword from the Ghost Ship and given it to Bai Shishi.

The three of them felt a burst of fear at hearing that. Ghost Ships were said to be connected to the secrets of the ten planar worlds. They could not be looked at nor be talked about. Otherwise, misfortune would befall those who were touched by their karma. Long Chen was crazy.

After learning all of this, Bai Xiaole’s mother sternly warned her son not to mention this matter to anyone ever again.

It was only now that Bai Shishi’s mother learned that the Ghost Dao had set its sights on Long Chen. Bai Xiaole’s mother possessed the Three Flower Pupils. Having reached the seventh level, she was capable of seeing things that others couldn’t see. However, she hadn’t brought it up until it was just the three of them alone.

“It is most likely due to the Ghost Ship. After touching such a terrifying existence, the Ghost Dao’s mark has been placed on him,” said Bai Zhantang somewhat gravely.

“Just like you back then?” asked Bai Shishi’s mother.

“No, not like then. I was marked because of a deviation in my cultivation of the Six Dao Fist. Then when the ghost world invaded, I was seriously wounded and had the Ghost Dao imprint placed on me. Even my father didn’t sense it. It was only thanks to senior sweeper’s warning that I managed to control it. It also helped me perfect my power of the six Daos. When I saw Long Chen this time, my mark sensed his. I wanted it to help him, thinking it could dispel Long Chen’s Ghost Dao mark. However, when it faced that mark, its spirit suddenly swelled violently. If I didn’t cut off the connection in time, it would have died,” said Bai Zhantang.

“It has the same strength as you, but just looking at Long Chen’s mark almost caused it to dissipate?” Both of his wives jumped in shock.

Back in the day, Bai Zhantang had also been marked by the Ghost Dao. It was thanks to the sweeper’s pointers that he managed to subdue a lifeform of the Ghost Dao, and from then on, it lived in his body with him, becoming his strongest helper.

It was capable of being summoned and fighting on its own. Moreover, its power was not at all inferior to his own. Now, such a powerful existence almost died just from looking at Long Chen’s mark? That was astonishing.

“Yes. It’s still in slumber. I’ll probably only know the details once it wakes up,” said Bai Zhantang solemnly.

The reason why Bai Shishi and Bai Xiaole had an innate fear of creatures of the Ghost Dao was actually related to Bai Zhantang. However, their parents had never told the two of them about this matter.

“Even if you can’t resolve it, you should warn Long Chen,” said Bai Xiaole’s mother.

“If a person doesn’t have a heart-devil, it is impossible to draw over an outer ghost. Long Chen is definitely aware of it somewhat, so we don’t need to worry for him.” Bai Zhantang shook his head. However, he suddenly irritably said, “I’m an idiot. Before going to the seventh branch academy, senior sweeper told me that I only had to do my duty and not bother with anything else. Thinking back, he must have been specifically referring to Long Chen’s Ghost Dao mark. Ah, if I had remembered, I wouldn’t have had it suffer like this. Ugh, I have the head of a pig.”

Bai Zhantang had the urge to hit himself. The sweeper of the academy was so far-sighted, and none of his words were meaningless. But Bai Zhantang still suffered after being warned, almost causing his companion to die. He was truly foolish.

Hearing that the sweeper had brought up this matter, the other two relaxed. As for Bai Zhantang’s regret, the two of them found it vexing and funny. This fellow’s head really wasn’t too bright sometimes. They could only comfort him as they returned to the main academy.
