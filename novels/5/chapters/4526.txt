Chapter 4515 Leaving the Desolation

Amidst the swirling Grand Dao runes, Long Chen put away the Earth Cauldron, which had been hovering over his head. Its protective shield was what allowed Long Chen to unleash Huo Linger and Lei Linger’s full power right beside him.

“Did we get him?” asked Huo Linger.

“Three of his clones were killed. The other five ran away.” Long Chen shook his head.

“What is going on? I certainly killed the true body. How can his clones survive?” asked Lei Linger.

She and Huo Linger had sealed their power inside the black ape’s mouth, using its aura to cover their own. Only then had they managed to trick Ying Tian.

Everything had gone smoothly. Just as Ying Tian was about to slay the black ape, the two unleashed their attack, and Long Chen attacked from behind him.

During their previous fight, Long Chen had found that Ying Tian’s head was not his vital point, which was why Long Chen aimed for his heart this time.

According to reason, the destruction of Ying Tian’s true body should be the end of it. However, his clones somehow survived.

“Perhaps he doesn’t have clones, and they are all his true bodies,” said Long Chen solemnly.

Regardless of the type of clone, there typically exists a true body. However, it seemed that Ying Tian’s clones defied this concept, and all nine were his true bodies. Long Chen had never heard of such a technique before.

However, considering that the Lifehunter race dared to challenge the violet blood race, they had to have their own strengths. It wasn’t unthinkable for them to have a unique technique like this.

“How hateful. We couldn’t even kill him after all this!” grumbled Huo Linger.

“Even though we didn’t kill him, we took half his life. Our attack was so flawless that he didn’t even have a chance to use his violet flag. After losing so many bodies this time, he probably won’t dare to face us temporarily,” comforted Long Chen.

Although Long Chen didn’t understand this secret art, he knew that Ying Tian had suffered a serious blow this time. The latter would definitely run as far as he could.

Thus, Long Chen’s trap couldn’t count as a failure. At the very least, he was temporarily safe from Ying Tian, so he felt much better.

Ying Tian was truly terrifying, possessing all kinds of unimaginable techniques. Had it been someone else caught by this trap, they would have died a hundred times over.

“What a crafty fellow. I don’t know if he’ll fall for it next time,” said Lei Linger.

Long Chen reached out and rubbed her violet hair. “Next time, we won’t need to set up anything. We’ll drown him with our power.”

“Yes, we’ll use real power to smash him flat!” Lei Linger and Huo Linger both smiled.

There were countless Saint-level devil beasts here. With a sufficient supply of corpses, their power would steadily increase each day.

Anyway, Ying Tian was severely wounded, and he would take some time to recover. Now, time was their greatest ally, so they were happy to hear Long Chen’s reassuring words.

Long Chen then tossed the two corpses into the primal chaos space. Although he had lost a Saint-level housepet, he didn’t mind. After all, the black ape was too foolish, and he couldn’t work together with it, finding it taxing just to direct it.

Using it as bait to wound Ying Tian was definitely worth it. When Long Chen tossed the two corpses into the primal chaos space, he checked on the Heaven Earth Blood Spirit Mushroom and found that its fourth leaf had appeared.

According to what the Earth Cauldron said, once it had nine leaves, it would be fully mature, and its medicinal effect would reach its peak.

It had only been a few hours, and it had produced its fourth leaf. Hence, Long Chen thought that it would soon have nine leaves as long as he supplied the black soil with enough devil beast corpses.

After checking the battlefield, Long Chen found a spirit pool in the bear’s cave.

However, this time, his luck wasn’t so good. The pool was already somewhat dry at the edges, and there wasn’t anything valuable. Most likely, once the spirit pool completely dried up, the bear would also leave to find a new home. However, it was unlucky enough to encounter Long Chen. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Long Chen felt much more relaxed over the next few days. Inspired by Ying Tian, Long Chen set up traps to deal with the devil beasts.

Due to their low intelligence, it was very easy to bait the devil beasts. In order to obtain their corpses, Long Chen didn’t even care about his pride and started to refine all kinds of shameless medicinal pills.

He created all kinds of poison pills, laxatives, and even aphrodisiac pills, using whatever methods to trick the devil beasts into eating them.

A pill master wasn’t to be feared, but a scoundrel pill master was a different story. Once these devil beasts consumed his pills, they ultimately died at Long Chen, Huo Linger, and Lei Linger’s hands.

Long Chen’s method was even more effective than Ying Tian’s. Ying Tian needed to wait for opportunities, while Long Chen created his own. He would get three to five Saint-level corpses every day.

After ten days, there were so many corpses that the black soil couldn’t keep up anymore. Now, over twenty corpses lay on top of it in a pile, waiting to be devoured.

During this period, Long Chen had captured a decent devil beast—a Snow Eagle. Compared to other devil beasts, its intelligence wasn’t bad. At the very least, it understood Long Chen’s commands.

With the Snow Eagle, Long Chen started to fly in one direction. It was extremely fast and powerful. When it flew over the territory of other devil beasts, they merely warned it with a roar but didn’t dare to take the initiative to attack, let alone chase it.

On the way, if Long Chen encountered weaker devil beasts, he would order the Snow Eagle to kill them. Killing the devil beasts was now very simple and quick.

With the addition of the Snow Eagle, Long Chen didn’t even need to set up traps and make the devil beasts eat his pills. He could easily gain over ten corpses in a day.

Aside from the corpses, Long Chen also acquired the natural treasures in their lands. There were ores, precious plants, as well as some things that Long Chen didn’t recognize. No matter what it was, he would take it. After all, to leave behind treasures wasn’t Long Chen’s style.

However, he also encountered some terrifying existences on the way, like a Berserker Sparrow Hawk. It chased them down, and even with all four of them joining forces, they weren’t a match for it.

Fortunately, they were quite fast, and it stopped chasing them after they left its territory. In the end, devil beasts were just devil beasts. They mostly fought using their physical strength as they didn’t have that many divine abilities. Otherwise, Long Chen really would have been in trouble.

Luckily, there weren’t that many devil beasts stronger than Long Chen’s Snow Eagle. Long Chen flew in one direction for a full month before the aura of the land started to change. The wild air gradually weakened.

Long Chen was relieved to sense this. After all, the domain of devil beasts wasn’t suitable for human habitation. For the aura of this place to weaken meant that they had finally escaped this desolate land.

After another day, Long Chen no longer saw any powerful devil beasts. Furthermore, his Snow Eagle got more agitated, and Long Chen started to lose control of it.

The air here was not suitable for it. After thinking for a bit, Long Chen helplessly released it from its slave mark.

Fortunately, it was a bit smarter than other devil beasts. After its seal was undone, it didn’t attack Long Chen. Otherwise, it would die right there and then.

After releasing the Snow Eagle, Long Chen continued onward and suddenly saw an arrow soar through the sky along with a sharp whistling sound.

“A whistling arrow? It should be a distress signal. I’ll go take a look!”

Long Chen spread his Kunpeng wings and turned into a flash of golden light shooting toward the source of that arrow.
