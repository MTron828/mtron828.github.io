Chapter 2119 Truly Powerful Enough to Exterminate Worlds

“Long Chen!”

One figure in particular roared furiously amongst those countless figures. It was Zhao Wuji who had fled back to this place.

Originally, the Mechanism Sect had prepared a banquet as a celebration. They had sent out a large number of elites and were simply waiting for Zhao Wuji and them to return in triumph.

However, they had never imagined that, including Zhao Wuji, only nine people would return. Zhao Wuji was so badly injured that he had lost consciousness.

The Mechanism Sect had immediately gathered the higher-ups. They had saved Zhao Wuji and listened to him about what had happened.

While healing, Zhao Wuji told them the whole story. By the time he was finished, they had yet to make any decisions on what to do when Long Chen came charging in. The alarm had just rung out when Long Chen destroyed their core tower.

That tower was the crux of their grand formation. In the past, the Mechanism Sect had been attacked by other powerful experts, but without exception, all of them never returned. They had been annihilated by their grand formation.

Perhaps it was because things had been too peaceful for too long, or perhaps because they had been sealed for so long that they had used up too many resources. In any case, in order to save some resources, they had shut down the grand formation’s automatic killing function.

Keeping the formation active meant using up a huge amount of resources. At first, they had just shut down the killing aspect of it, but then they had decided to shut down the defensive aspect as well.

Ever since they had chosen this place as the entrance to their minor world, they had been concealed, and no one had ever found them. They had started to grow careless, thinking that no one could find them here.

As a result, Long Chen had found them. Not only had he found them, but he had also destroyed the core of their grand formation.

With the destruction of the tower, whether it was their defensive formation or their killing formation, everything had turned into garbage. Seeing this made Zhao Wuji so angry that he almost went crazy.

“Kill him!” The rest of the Mechanism Sect was also infuriated. This one attack from Long Chen was the greatest humiliation the Mechanism Sect had ever suffered in all of history.

Just at this moment, one of the Elders took out a God Extermination Cannon. As soon as Zhao Wuji saw it, he turned green with fright. “Stop!”

Only then did the Elder recall that Zhao Wuji had said that Long Chen had a terrifying archer by his side. The majority of the people that Zhao Wuji had brought had been killed because of that archer shooting the God Extermination Cannon. He hastily put it away.

“Four Grand Sect-Protecting Elders, kill him! There’s no need to capture him alive!” shouted Zhao Wuji.

Four Elders wearing violet scaled armor surrounded Long Chen. A net shot out of their palms, enveloping Long Chen.

The four Elders’ movements were in unison. They were clearly highly skilled in working together. The net was covered in sharp barbs that dripped with a blue liquid.

“Scram!”

Flames burst out of Long Chen’s body, forming a cage around him. He had taken out the Raging Flame Prison. However, this time, he wasn’t using it to trap someone. Instead, the cage rapidly spread toward the four Elders.

The nets they shot out were instantly incinerated, while the cage continued spreading. The four Elders tried to stop it, but when the intense flames attacked them, their expressions changed and they retreated.

They were shocked to find that when the flames touched their armor, their flame-proof armor started to burn. They immediately focused on putting out the flames, or their armor would be destroyed.

“The Mechanism Sect that terrified the rest of the world only relies on some shameful methods to survive. When your mechanisms are broken, you instantly become trash. No wonder you keep your mechanisms so tightly guarded. If this is all the ability you have, then don’t waste any more of my time. Your Mechanism Sect is being destroyed today!”

The flame prison spreading around Long Chen exploded, unleashing flames throughout the entire minor world.

Within those flames, Long Chen raised his right hand. A flame lotus slowly condensed.

A scorching air spread. The world continued to burn as a terrifying aura filled heaven and earth.

The flames around Long Chen rippled. It was like he was in a lake. One sphere slowly appeared on each of the nine petals of the lotus.

Flame energy surged within those spheres. They blazed like stars, and following the first, the second set of flame spheres also appeared.

The two sets of spheres seemed to possess completely different energies. They both repulsed and attracted each other, revolving around each other.

As they revolved, a third sphere appeared between them, and then all three spheres vanished, merging into one Taiji diagram. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

The flame lotus shuddered. It then explosively grew, expanding from a foot long to hundreds of feet long.

It was completely different from the flame lotuses that Long Chen had summoned before. This time, the nine Taiji diagrams naturally moved from the petals toward the center.

When the nine Taiji diagrams met, they merged into one large Taiji diagram.

The flame lotus shook. It was like it had been bestowed with life. A flame sphere appeared on the nine petals once more.

The nine spheres unleashed rays of divine light that merged with the core Taiji diagram. The nine lights connected, creating a strange loop.

The flame energy surrounding Long Chen vanished, and the entire minor world was thrown into darkness. The only thing within it was a burning lotus.

A terrifying heat caused the bricks on the ground of the Mechanism Sect to melt. Some of the buildings caught fire, and the disciples of the sect fled in panic.

“Kill him together!”

Zhao Wuji was appalled. He had never imagined that Long Chen possessed such a terrifying move. Ever since they had fought, he thought that he had figured out Long Chen’s power level. Although he had lost twice, he always thought that he had just been a bit away from defeating Long Chen.

However, seeing this absolutely horrifying technique, he realized that Long Chen had never brought out his true power.

Tens of thousands of experts from the Mechanism Sect attacked Long Chen at the same time. A torrent of attacks flew toward him as they all used their strongest killing moves. If they weren’t afraid that Guo Ran was hiding somewhere, they would have taken out the God Extermination Cannon.

“A World Extermination Flame Lotus on the one-star level?”

Long Chen looked at the single star on each petal and smiled. This World Extermination Flame Lotus had finally taken the right form today.

“Today, I’ll use your Mechanism Sect to test my move!”

Long Chen threw the flame lotus at the world beneath them. It instantly grew larger.

The giant flame lotus filled the sky. The attacks from the Mechanism Sect’s experts were devoured by just the outer waves emanating from the flame lotus. Their weapons instantly melted.

“How is this happening?!”

“Impossible!”

“Alert the patriarch!”

“It’s already too late...”

“Run!”

Panicked cries rang out. The Mechanism Sect’s experts were only skilled in their mechanisms. As for magical arts, they only had a superficial understanding of them.

Seeing that their attacks were all ineffective against this flame lotus, they were dumbfounded. They then fled for their lives.

When the flame lotus was about to strike the land, it grew once more. The nine Star Falls on top of it didn’t explode like before. Instead, they instantly went out.

At that moment, all their power returned to the Taiji diagram in the center.

The Taiji diagram stopped spinning and suddenly exploded. The World Extermination Flame Lotus transformed into a giant sphere.

That wasn’t a protective sphere. It rapidly spread. All the buildings and people in its path were blown to bits and then incinerated.

“No!”

Cries of despair rang out. Some of the fleeing experts were devoured by the flame lotus, vanishing without a trace.

The flames filled the entire minor world. A bottomless hole appeared at the center of the impact.

All the buildings in this minor world had been destroyed. This noisy world became silent.

“This... is way too exaggerated!” Long Chen himself was stunned. He hadn’t dared to imagine that his World Extermination Flame Lotus would be so terrifying. This was truly world-destroying.

During the gathering of past and present heroes, he had made a breakthrough with his World Extermination Flame Lotus and had been testing it with the Heaven Incinerating Flame.

This time, he had used the Inverse Dao Water Spirit Flame, but he hadn’t expected this flame to cause a change in the flame lotus, resulting in a strange loop forming between the Star Falls.

That had just been one Star Fall on each petal. What if it had been two, or three? Just how powerful would it be then?

Long Chen was both excited and nervous. He felt disbelief. Such a terrifying technique had actually been made by him.

On the edges of the minor world, a pile of rubble shifted and a figure crawled out.

This person was charred black all over. His body was no longer complete. Only his eyes gave a clue about his identity. It was Zhao Wuji.

Zhao Wuji was no longer as arrogant and tyrannical as he had been during the gathering. He hadn’t even fully recovered from his previous injuries when this attack struck him.

If other experts hadn’t taken his place to block the flames, he would already be dead. However, he was essentially a corpse now.

“What’s going on...? What is going on? This can’t be real...” Zhao Wuji shuddered. He couldn’t accept how the glorious Mechanism Sect had been turned into ruins by a single attack from Long Chen.

BOOM!

Suddenly, an explosion came from underground. Fierce killing intent spread as a wild-haired elder slowly floated out of the earth.
