Chapter 3900 Violet Pupil Nine Tail Demon Fox

When those eyes appeared, Guo Ran and the others’ hair stood on end. Those were the eyes of the devil, filled with bloodthirst. It was like this lifeform only lived for slaughter.

“I… I…”

Bai Xiaole’s jaw dropped. He had no idea what had just happened.

“Why are you wasting my time? If you want to form a contract, then bring out your spiritual seal. Fuck, I really regret fighting to get here first. I ended up running into a useless oaf. If you refuse to make a contract this time, you can just say that you give up. This contractual ceremony will then be abolished. A month later, you can restart it and will have another chance to make a contract,” said the master of the eyes impatiently.

“I’m not prepared. I…” Bai Xiaole was quivering in fear in front of those eyes. He didn’t even know what to say.

“Hurry and accept!” Guo Ran could see that this lifeform was regretting coming for Bai Xiaole. It clearly wanted to leave, so Guo Ran hastily urged Bai Xiaole on.

“Shut your mouth!”

That lifeform unleashed a deafening roar, and its pupils contracted into minuscule dots. Guo Ran, at that moment, felt indescribable anguish, as if his very soul was on the verge of being torn apart. A terrifying presence descended upon him like an unstoppable tsunami, overwhelming him with its immense might.

BOOM!

Suddenly, the sacred might of a dragon rippled outward, blasting back the lifeform’s power. It tore through the void inch by inch.

“Hm?” That lifeform seemed surprised. Only then did it take note of Long Chen who was wrapped in a dragon scale.

At this moment, Guo Ran was startled and enraged. Fortunately, Long Chen was right behind him, so this lifeform had disturbed the dragon scale, causing it to resolve its pressure on Guo Ran. Otherwise, he might be in a bad state right now.

“Courting death, are you?! Disturb my boss and I’ll kill you! What? Are you looking down on us? Since you’ve come, do you regret it? Xiaole, form a contract with it! If it doesn’t submit, boss will help you put it in its place!” raged Guo Ran.

“Alright, I’ll form the contract…” Bai Xiaole nervously took out his spiritual seal.

“Brat, you won’t regret it?” demanded the lifeform coldly.

“I won’t regret it!”

Bai Xiaole clenched his teeth. He didn’t know anything himself, but he trusted Long Chen and everyone beside him.

That lifeform stared at Bai Xiaole and then Long Chen who was wrapped in a golden egg. In the end, it took out a rune and placed it on Bai Xiaole’s spiritual seal.

Buzz.

The moment the two seals met, the void began to shake. After that, the spatial gate slowly moved until it was behind Bai Xiaole.

Originally, Bai Xiaole’s manifestation had a pair of three-flower patterns in it. That was a projection of his Three Flower Pupils.

In the midst of it all, the eyes within the spatial gate merged with the three flowers, transforming into a remarkable pair of double eyes.

BOOM!

When those two eyes merged, the spatial gate exploded and a towering figure tore out of the void, shaking the world with its wild aura.

This creature was a terrifying embodiment of power. Resembling a fox, it possessed nine tails, each with its own colors, almost looking like the plumage of a peacock in full bloom.

“The desolate beast of the era of legends, the Nine Tail Demon Fox?!”

When this lifeform revealed itself, a city lord cried out in horror.

“Its pupils… they are violet. It can't be... the legendary Emperor of the Nine Tail Demon Foxes, the Violet Pupil Nine Tail Demon Fox! So the legends of that era are true. There really is such an existence!” a voice quivered. The crowd stood in disbelief, their eyes wide with trepidation, as the existence they had only heard of in ancient tales revealed itself before their eyes.

The era of legends was a vague time. All kinds of stories and paintings from that era were handed down through generations, attempting to capture its essence. However, they remained fragments of the past, lacking clarity and definitive origins, making it challenging to trace their true roots. Like whispers in the wind, the tales of that era carried an air of uncertainty, leaving gaps in the understanding of history.

Even though the skepticism lingered, the allure of stories persisted among the people. The divine beasts depicted within those tales, in particular, inspired vivid imaginations, leading to the creation of vibrant images.

Hence, the sudden manifestation of an actual Violet Pupil Nine Tail Demon Fox held a profound visual impact, leaving countless individuals captivated by it.

If the Violet Pupil Nine Tail Demon Fox truly existed, then didn’t it mean that many other legends could appear in this world at any moment?

A desolate qi swirled around it, causing countless experts to feel like their hearts would explode. This was a beast that had walked out of the era of legends. It was terrifying.

“Brat, I have formed a contract with you. But if you’re too weak, this would be blasphemy to my Violet Pupil Nine Tail race. According to our contract, I can kill you to escape the bindings that hold us together,” said the Violet Eye Nine Tail Demon Fox, its voice icy cold without any emotion.

However, when it looked through the battlefield, its violet pupils emitted a demonic light. It was like a beast eyeing endless prey.

“I…”

Bai Xiaole was still horrified by what he had summoned, so he didn't even know what to say. He had never imagined that he would gain such a terrifying contractual divine beast.

“Fuck, so weak! What can I do in this state?” The Violet Pupil Nine Tail Demon Fox looked down at the little fellow in front of him a bit irritably. “Use your pupil art and the mnemonic I gave you to merge your power with mine. Let me see what kind of level we can reach when our powers merge.”

“Oh!” Only then did Bai Xiaole form hand seals. As divine light flowed in his eyes, the void shuddered. After that, the Violet Pupil Nine Tail Demon Fox’s enormous figure rapidly shrank until it was only three hundred meters tall.

“What is this?!” The Violet Eye Nine Tail Demon Fox seemed enraged, as if it was going to explode. It glared at Bai Xiaole in such a manner that Bai Xiaole thought it was going to eat him.

“What… what… what do you mean, what is this?” stuttered Bai Xiaole in terror.

“How can our merged power be so weak?! It’s not even a thousandth of what mine was! How can you be so weak?!” roared the Violet Pupil Nine Tail Demon Fox. A wild qi wave then blasted away Bai Xiaole. “When others merged with me, the result was far beyond one plus one. As for you, rather than increasing my power, you’ve only weakened me. What is the point of this?”

Bai Xiaole was shaken by this roar, his mind crumbling. As a result, he could only stare in terror at the Violet Pupil Nine Tail Demon Fox and had no idea what to say.

“Brother, calm yourself. I follow my boss, and I’ll grow quickly! Give me some time, please. I’m weak now, but I’ll get stronger!” said Bai Xiaole while trembling with fear.

Many people thought that such gutless words would cause the Violet Pupil Nine Tail Demon Fox to be further enraged, but unexpectedly, it looked toward Long Chen and suppressed its anger. “Merge with my spiritual body. I want to test your pupil arts.”

“Alright!”

As Bai Xiaole’s hand seals changed, he vanished, reappearing on the Violet Pupil Nine Tail Demon Fox’s head. After that, the aura of fox and man became one.𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

BOOM!

The Violet Pupil Nine Tail Demon Fox’s body suddenly vanished. It reappeared on the battlefield, unleashing a sharp claw that tore through the void.
