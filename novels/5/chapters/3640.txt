Chapter 3629

“Children, you should temporarily retreat. These old bones of ours can still move. We’ll help you buy some time to recover,” said Xue Yifan.

“But didn’t boss say…?”

Guo Ran and the others were hesitant. These elders were the core of the human race’s hearts, a mental pillar for them. If something happened to them, the human race’s morale would be badly affected.

Moreover, their power was related to their Blood Qi. Xue Yifan and the others might have higher realms, but their Blood Qis had already regressed. Perhaps occasionally fighting wouldn’t cause a problem for them, but such a high-intensity battle would overdraft their remaining essence blood, shortening their lifespans. Now, considering that they almost reached the end of their lifespans, going on the battlefield was no different than sending themselves to their deaths.

“The commander is outside the battlefield and unable to give new orders as the situation changes. Quickly fall back and prepare yourselves. The enemy is powerful, and we have to be prepared for a long-term battle.” Xue Yifan patted Guo Ran’s shoulder, not at all caring about the blood covering his armor.

“But…”

“No buts. This battle is not just yours. It is also ours. Do you think that us old fellows are useless?” demanded the Celestial Essence Sect’s patriarch angrily.

“When we dominated this world, your grandfather hadn’t even been born yet. Stop wasting time and retreat. It’s our turn to exercise our bodies,” barked another half-step Divine Venerate.

“Good child, don’t hesitate. I didn’t misjudge you. You are just like your boss inside. You are both figures that will hold up the heavens for the world. You are all heroes, but we’re also not cowards who will just sit and watch. We can’t buy you much time. Even if you refuse to consider it for yourself, consider it for the warriors beneath you,” said Xue Yifan to Guo Ran.

Upon hearing Xue Yifan say this and looking at his smile, Guo Ran’s eyes suddenly reddened.

“Fall back. The real battle is coming up.” After saying that, Xue Yifan’s golden battle armor lit up like the rising sun. A powerful aura erupted.

“Kill!”

The Celestial Essence Sect’s patriarch had long since gotten impatient. With a roar, his battle armor emitted a resplendent divine light, and the pressure of a half-step Divine Venerate erupted. He charged into the devil army.

The terrifying power of half-step Divine Venerates was finally revealed at this time. The Alldevil race’s experts collapsed in front of them. When half-step Divine Venerates unleashed their full power, they were practically unrivaled battle gods.

“Hahaha, today, I’ll kill until I’m satisfied! Alldevil race, I’ll have you repay the blood debt you owe my fallen brothers! The enmity of so many years will be settled today!” roared the Celestial Essence Sect’s patriarch like an angry lion. It was as if he had returned to his youth, fighting on the battlefield.

His voice contained pain, hatred, remembrance, and sorrow. All the people that had fought alongside him back in the day were gone. It was now just him, all alone.

“Brothers, I will avenge you!”

The Celestial Essence Sect’s patriarch raised his weapon and slaughtered the Alldevil race with his full power.

Nine great half-step Divine Venerates were attacking with their full power, annihilating the Alldevil race. With every blow, they crushed the enemies, and their huge-area attacks instantly stabilized the front lines. With them in charge, the starry river warriors were free to rest and take a breather.

However, seeing their mighty elders display their strength, slaughtering the devil race so easily, not one person cheered. All of them had mournful expressions.

Guo Ran was crying. Xue Yifan and the others were igniting what remained of their lifespans in exchange for a burst of Blood Qi. They were unleashing their maximum potential.

However, they were already old and were burning up their lives to buy some time for everyone. After this battle, they definitely wouldn’t live for long.

Xie Liuer, Leng Hui, Tu Hu, Xie Qianqian, and the other starry river warriors also wept.

“Don’t cry! Hurry up and recover your energy! Repair your battle armors! Get ready to join the fray again!” shouted Guo Ran even as he cried himself.

At this moment, battleships descended to provide the materials that they needed to perform maintenance on their battle armors. The damaged portions were quickly switched out.

Some of the starry river warriors were practically naked. Their battle armors had almost been destroyed, so they had relied on just their physical bodies to fight their enemies. From this, it could be seen just how intense this battle was.

The nine elders, the grand formation, and the battleships bought precious time for the starry river warriors to take a breather. They repaired their battle armors and consumed medicinal pills to recover. After that, they looked at the other battlefield.

Long Chen and Alldevil Tianye could no longer be seen. These experts could only see black qi and violet qi clashing. Occasionally, there would be a thunderous explosion, and wild currents flowed within that battlefield. They couldn’t even approach that space, so they had no idea what was going on.

However, seeing those two forces crazily clashing and their auras continuously rising, it seemed that they possessed endless energy. No one could tell who held the advantage.

The battlefield around the two of them was a zone of absolute death. No one could interfere. From the Alldevil race, no one went to support Alldevil Tianye, and from the human race, no one went to support Long Chen. Their battle was truly a battle of kings. Whoever won there would decide victory or defeat in an instant.

However, the human race was still at an absolute disadvantage. There was an endless army of devil beasts and experts from the Alldevil race. They were still pouring in.

But the human race only had so many warriors. Without reinforcements, there was nowhere for them to go past here. They could only rely on themselves.

“Guo Ran, perhaps we should slip over to boss Long Chen’s battlefield. If we work together with boss Long Chen, as long as we can kill Alldevil Tianye, everything will be over,” whispered Leng Hui.

This proposal enticed Xie Liuer, Tu Hu, Xie Qianqian, and the other peak heavenly geniuses from the various sects. That was the fastest shortcut to ending this battle.

If Long Chen lost, then everything would end. It might be better to slip over now while they had the chance, and by joining forces, they could eliminate Alldevil Tianye.

“You are underestimating Alldevil Tianye too much. An expert on that level is not afraid of fighting a group battle. If we go, we will only be eliminated one by one. Rather than helping, we’ll distract boss.” Guo Ran shook his head.

“But I’m worried…” Xie Liuer looked at that terrifying space nervously.

“Don’t worry. I don’t dare to guarantee anything else, but within the same realm, no one within the nine heavens and ten lands is a match for boss. Boss’s victory is only a matter of time…”

Just then, the space at the rear of the devil beast army fluctuated. Terrifying ripples shook everyone’s heart.

“Not good! They’re creating a channel!” Guo Ran’s expression instantly changed.
