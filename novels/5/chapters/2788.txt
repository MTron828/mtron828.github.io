Chapter 2777 The Dragonblood Legion Comes Out to Fight

BANG!

The barrier suddenly shattered, causing everyone’s hearts to clench. The destruction of the barrier signified the start of a bloody slaughter.

However, what people hadn’t expected was that after the barrier was broken, its power condensed, splitting into two smaller barriers. One protected Long Chen, while the other protected everyone.

The five supreme divine items appeared above Long Chen’s head, forming a new smaller barrier. As for the other barrier, it came from the ground. This was the power of the Martial Heaven Continent’s core.

Originally, the giant barrier had been set up by the power of both the five supreme divine items and the Martial Heaven Continent’s core to prevent the Heaven Devastating Bracelet’s power from flowing away, locking that power inside for the cultivators to absorb.

However, now that the barrier could no longer be maintained, they split up, with the five supreme divine items protecting Long Chen and the Martial Heaven Continent protecting its people.

The Nine-Headed Lion and the others had been delighted to see the barrier break, but when they saw it shrink down into smaller barriers, they knew that its defensive powers had to have shot up, so they cursed furiously.

“Ignore the trash! Kill Long Chen!” shouted Ye Ming.

“Fuck, who do you think you are to give me orders?! Scram!” cursed the Nine-Headed Lion. The original plan had been for them to attack together after becoming Sovereigns. That was the most dependable method, but Ye Ming had been in a rush to take everything for himself, resulting in this current mess. Now he even wished to give them directions? The Nine-Headed Lion had an urge to kill him.

“Do I need you to give me directions? Are you an idiot?” sneered the Blood Fiend Devil Lord.

“Once this is over, we’ll settle things between us,” said the Alldevil Heavenwalker darkly. He was the most infuriated out of everyone.

The devil race’s army had been exterminated. This was an insult to the devil race, and it was all Ye Ming’s fault.

Without needing to hear Ye Ming’s reminder, they all charged toward Long Chen. That was because they had a bad feeling.

Even through the barrier, they could sense Long Chen’s terrifying aura, and it made their hearts quiver.

Moreover, the four of them already had a sense of fear beaten into them by Long Chen. If he became a Sovereign as well, they might not be able to defeat him.

At this moment, their armies were assaulting the barrier, with more of them appearing from the spatial gates. Their numbers seemed endless.

“Senior, are we just going to watch like this?!” cried out Guo Ran.

The High Priest nodded. “We can only wait. All the moves on this life and death board have been played, and what remains is the decisive clash. Life and death will be decided here. The more pressing things are, the more we must stay calm. We must listen to the Sovereigns’ directives.”

The five Sovereigns had made their moves on this board stemming back over a hundred thousand years, and their efforts had resulted in this current board. Since they were now on the eve of a critical juncture, everyone was tense.

Mo Nian and the others clenched their weapons. To say that they weren’t nervous would be a lie. There couldn’t be the smallest slip, as behind them were their families. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

Every single warrior here had a family. Although they had set foot on the path of cultivation and almost lost contact with them, their families were still in their hearts. These ties were what allowed them to stand at the front of the battlefield bravely. They no longer had any path of retreat.

BOOM!

Another incense stick’s worth of time later, the barrier protecting everyone rumbled. At this moment, the five Sovereigns’ figures became much fainter. Under the assault of countless experts, their blood soul energy had been exhausted.

“Attack!”

The High Priest suddenly charged out, leading the way out of the barrier. The five Sovereigns’ barrier had finally reached the point where they had no other choice but to attack.

“Kill!”

Guo Ran howled and charged out with the Dragonblood Legion.

The Heaven Splitting Divine Sect and the Xuantian Dao Sect’s experts followed them.

At this moment, all the top experts charged out. There were the Nangong, Beitang, and Ximen families, the Mo family, the Wine God Palace, the Heavenly Sword Gate, the Huayun Sect, and more. They were like a giant dragon charging out of the barrier.

“Jianying, you should stay here. I will kill enough for you,” said the old man, his white hair blowing in a wild gust. However, despite his wild appearance, he still didn’t want Qu Jianying to be in danger.

Dangers surrounded every single one of them now. However, Qu Jianying had a rare smile on her face. She held the old man’s face. “I’m not afraid. I have the Martial Heaven Virtue Tablet, so I’ll be fine. As the previous leader of the Martial Heaven Alliance, how can I hide? Old man, I promise that I will fully leave these matters behind after this battle. I’ll marry you and be your wife. I’ll accompany you for a long time, and I won’t intentionally anger you again. So remember, you have to come back alive. This is our promise.”

Qu Jianying stuck out her pinkie, clasping it with the old man’s thick pinkie. “Remember, this is our promise. You can’t break it.”

“Hahaha, alright. I have never failed to live up to my word in this lifetime! Today, I’ll show these little brats what is called a good blade that doesn’t grow old!”

The old man laughed heroically, catching up to his disciples in an instant. He then pushed aside the threatening Bao Buping. “Everyone, follow me or you won’t get any chance once I slaughter them all!”

“Kill!”

As their shouts rang out, a towering willow tree appeared, covering the sky, letting a lot of willow branches fall. Liu Ruyan was the one to pull open the curtain to this battle.

“Endless Wind Moons, Blood Buries Life!”

Tang Wan-er was surrounded by wind blades. After becoming a Saint, the power of her divine bone had fully awakened. Wherever her wind blades went, her enemies exploded, their blood filling the air.

On the other side, the world was rocked as two giant figures crashed into each other. Cloud had transformed into the true form of a Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow, and she crashed into the Kunpeng Emperor. Both of them were divine birds, and their first clash caused a rain of feathers to fall.

The Kunpeng Emperor then unleashed a claw on Cloud’s wing and blood splashed. As for Cloud, she spat out a black light that pierced the Kunpeng Emperor’s chest.

The Kunpeng and the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow were both top existences amongst divine birds. They began a ferocious fight, filling the air with divine light.

“Kill!”

The Martial Heaven Continent’s experts pierced through the armies of the other worlds, but in terms of numbers, there was no way to compare them. The invaders had thousands of times more experts than them.

However, the Dragonblood Legion was the sharpest blade for the Martial Heaven Continent. They charged straight through the invaders, quickly reaching the barrier protecting Long Chen.

“Ye Ming, come out and fight!”

Guo Ran charged out like a shooting star straight toward Ye Ming and then sliced his blades against each other. The runes on his wings blazed with light.
