Chapter 2607 The Most Terrifying Area

Long Chen hadn’t expected the Lord Venerate to act so politely. However, considering that Long Chen represented the Martial Heaven Continent with the Wine God Palace, Illusive Music Immortal Palace, the Divine Ice Palace, and the Martial Heaven Alliance, his status had truly reached that level, even if his cultivation base hadn’t. Hence, he was qualified to speak equally with the divine families’ Lord Venerate.

Long Chen thought of Elder Long’s words. If it was profitable to him, then they could talk. There was no need to talk about things that had nothing to do with profit though.

After that, Long Chen nodded. “Of course. The Martial Heaven Continent is facing a tribulation, so we should be united against our common foes.”

The Lord Venerate smiled. “That’s good. The plan to defend the Martial Heaven Continent can be discussed with you and the four family heads. As for the details, you can slowly discuss it.”

Unexpectedly, after saying that, the Lord Venerate simply vanished.

Long Chen was first confused, but then he understood. If he was the High Priest, then the Lord Venerate would naturally have to discuss things himself. However, he was Long Chen. If the Lord Venerate came to talk to him, it would be lowering his seniority.

Theoretically, the ones most suited to discuss this with Long Chen were Feng Fei, Long Aotian, Ye Liangchen, and Jiang Wuchen. But three of them had extreme conflicts with him. They probably would start fighting before they even finished discussing things, so the Lord Venerate left this discussion to the four family heads.

Although the Zhao and Ye family heads felt hatred for Long Chen, considering that the Lord Venerate had just killed one of the Zhao family’s important Elders was enough to shake them. At most, they would only express some dissatisfaction. They wouldn’t dare to go any further.

A table was arranged within the palace. After that, the four families sent out one person each. However, those were not their family heads, but their representatives.

The Long family’s representative was the Deputy Elder. He had a smile in his eyes as he looked at Long Chen.

The representatives of the Jiang, Zhao, and Ye families also sat at the table. Right now, everyone in the palace was silent. The atmosphere was extremely tense.

Long Chen sat, also not saying anything. Although he wasn’t experienced in negotiations, he knew that the initiative was in his hands. There was no need to rush.

With all of them silent, Long Chen directly shut his eyes, waiting for someone to lose patience first.

The silence lasted a full incense stick’s worth of time before the divine families’ side lost patience. The Jiang family’s representative said, “Long Chen, let us discuss the current situation of the Martial Heaven Continent. You should know why the Martial Heaven Continent’s heavenly geniuses are still not making their breakthroughs to the Heaven Merging realm, correct?”

Long Chen opened his eyes and emotionlessly said, “Daoist Heavenly Feather said that we are waiting for the qi of the other worlds to enter the Martial Heaven Continent. Once their laws are all mixed, we can make our breakthrough. At that time, we won’t need to fear their laws.”

The Jiang family Elder nodded. “Correct. In truth, both we and the experts of the other worlds are waiting for this chance. If they want to enter the Martial Heaven Continent, they need to wait for the laws of their world to mix with the laws of the Martial Heaven Continent. At that point, they can merge with the Heavenly Daos. That way, they can freely walk upon the continent without being rejected by the continent’s laws. Then no one will be limited, and the true war will start. I hear that your friend entered the Corrupt God Cemetery and opened the gate to Resentful Death City, causing the death spirit qi inside to be unleashed upon the continent. Do you know that this is opening another channel to the enemies of the Martial Heaven Continent?”

That final turn was quite sharp. He managed to turn the matter of Resentful Death City into a sharp weapon. By saying that it was done by Long Chen’s friend, he was also pulling Long Chen under the burden of the responsibility of such a thing.

Long Chen sneered, “How laughable. Even if Mo Nian didn’t enter Resentful Death City, would Resentful Death City not invade the continent?”

“That’s nonsense. Resentful Death City has remained isolated from the Martial Heaven Continent the entire time. If someone didn’t take the initiative to provoke them, why would they attack? Are you trying to avoid responsibility?” demanded the Zhao family’s representative.

Long Chen was startled to hear this. It seemed that they didn’t know that he had entered Resentful Death City. In other words, the Corrupt path was not fully allied with the divine families. They didn’t share all their information with each other. This was curious.

“What? You can’t explain yourself? You can’t even muster the courage to dare to accept responsibility for your own actions?” The Zhao family’s representative began to press the attack, thinking that Long Chen was made speechless by this line of questioning.

Long Chen curled his lips. “In this world, there is nothing that I don’t dare do, nor is there any responsibility that I haven’t picked up. Don’t use your brainless heads to judge me. It will only show your own ignorance and immaturity. As for whether or not Resentful Death City would attack the Martial Heaven Continent, if you don’t know the answer, you can go ask the Lord Venerate. Ask him where the battlefield of the last dark era occurred, and then we can talk some more.”

The Elders were mystified. But while the four family heads’ expressions didn’t change, there was a subtle change in their gazes. Long Chen saw that they clearly knew something. In other words, even amongst the divine families, only the family heads were qualified to know this secret. The four representatives had no idea.

“Where are you trying to drag this conversation to? Don’t change the subject,” snorted the Zhao family’s representative. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

Long Chen disdainfully said, “It seems that your relationship with the Corrupt path hasn’t progressed to this point. Did they not tell you about how I entered Resentful Death City and met Sovereign Zi Yang?”

“What?!

All the experts shot up, staring in shock at him.

“Sovereign Zi Yang?”

Long Chen had seen Sovereign Zi Yang? If anyone else had said that, people would only scoff at them. But Long Chen was someone that Sovereign Mo Li called brother, so they had no choice but to believe him.

Feng Fei, Ye Liangchen, and Jiang Wuchen were filled with shock. Ye Liangchen in particular was filled with envy. Just how did Long Chen manage to meet two different Sovereigns?

They were the strongest and most mysterious existences of the Martial Heaven Continent. They had many secrets. Hence, any expert would long to have the honor of seeing one.

If others knew that Long Chen had seen four of the five Sovereigns, it was unknown whether or not these people would die from shock. Perhaps Ye Liangchen would even die of anger, right?

Even the expressionless Long Aotian twitched. Long Chen’s luck really was heaven-defying. Others had no choice but to be jealous.

“I also refuse to believe that the divine families do not know the origin of Immortal Ascension City,” added Long Chen.

The various Elders looked around, befuddled. They didn’t know what that meant.

“They truly don’t know about the secrets of Resentful Death City. It is a forbidden land with a great deal of karma mixed within it, so even the family heads only know a bit. Don’t make things hard on them.” The Long family head finally spoke up.

The Long family head was an old man with white hair and so many wrinkles that it looked like he couldn’t open his eyes.

However, his voice was still powerful, ringing out like a drum. It didn’t show any signs of old age.

Hearing this, Long Chen nodded and turned back to the Zhao family’s representative. “Since you don’t know Resentful Death City’s secrets, don’t randomly blame others. Also, I’ll ask you not to put on such an expression in front of me. At this distance, I’m afraid that I won’t be able to hold back slapping you.”

That representative’s expression changed, and a vein popped on his forehead. However, he was the closest to Long Chen and was truly afraid that Long Chen would suddenly slap him. That divine technique of Long Chen’s was something that he doubted he could dodge.

Unless he was at full attention, there was no way he could block this attack lacking any killing intent. By the time he reacted, it would already be over.

If it was a punch or kick, then fine. But a slap was the most humiliating attack. Being struck would make him feel worse than being killed.

“The Lord Venerate asked you to discuss things with me, not interrogate me. You are not above me. Also, I’ll remind you that if you refuse to work with us, both sides will suffer. I’ve given you enough face by coming here, showing you the sincerity of the Martial Heaven Continent, and the Lord Venerate has also expressed the proper sincerity. I hope that a few blind people won’t ruin this major matter. If you really wish to discuss this, we can discuss it properly. If not, we can part ways and not waste each other’s valuable time,” said Long Chen coldly.

They had said that it was a discussion, but as soon as it started, it became an interrogation. That truly angered Long Chen. The divine families really were inefficient.

As a result, the Zhao family’s representative fell silent, and the others looked at the Long family’s Deputy Elder. He finally said, “Long Chen, the Martial Heaven Continent’s current situation is very worrying. There’s already the Yin Yang World and Devil Spirit Mountain, but now Resentful Death City has been added to the equation. In truth, the divine families have been guarding the Ancient Battlefield this entire time. It is also an entrance to another world, but the level of danger there far surpasses the other three. Lately, we’ve been fighting with so many demonic beasts that it’s starting to grow taxing on us. Furthermore, the channel linking the Ancient Battlefield to the Martial Heaven Continent was originally concealed by a formation that we set up, but somehow it was broken. This channel is also going to open soon.”

Long Chen nodded. He had gone to the Ancient Battlefield before. That battlefield had left a deep impression on him. The battle between the experts of that era had left behind countless holes and cracks in the void that continued to exist. Their will had yet to fade even after all this time.

Furthermore, there was another channel linking the Ancient Battlefield to the place between the Eastern Xuan Region and the Southern Xuan Region. Long Chen had gone there before as a shortcut to the Skywood Divine Palace. He had heard some terrifying roars when he passed through there.

“These four areas are actually not the most terrifying one. The most dangerous area is the Martial Heaven Sea-Ring. You should have heard of the Heaven Devastating Bracelet, right?” said the Long Deputy Elder gravely.
