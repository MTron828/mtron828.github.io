Chapter 2520 Contemptible

A giant die revolved in the air, trapping the Six Horn Sea Serpent within. Divine light descended from the die, creating a strange space around it.

The die behind Hu Feng’s back had vanished, but it was now replaced by nine dominos. They were the Gambling Heavenly Dao’s inherited divine item, the Heavenly Nine Tiles. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Light floated out of the Heavenly Nine Tiles, constantly transforming into different shapes behind Hu Feng. It was as if they were manifesting the future.

“Sorry, brother Long. My Heavenly Fate Die fell into slumber after I repaired it. Without it, I can’t run around randomly. However, as soon as it woke up, I rushed over. It’s a good thing that I didn’t come too late,” said Hu Feng.

“You came at the perfect time. Help me trap him. I’m almost done.” Long Chen smiled.

Hu Feng really had come at the perfect time. Right now, Long Chen had gathered everyone’s Spiritual Strength. His connection to the karmic hell flames burning on the altar was growing increasingly stronger.

In a few more minutes, he would be able to assimilate those flames, forming a complete connection between them and the karmic hell flames still in the primal chaos space. Then he would be able to control them despite not being in the primal chaos space.

The Six Horn Sea Serpent furiously attacked the spatial walls surrounding him. However, the die would constantly change shape. The void would twist and collapse. He was unable to get any leverage to break through.

The Heavenly Fate Die was actually just like the Brahma Divine Diagram and had its own spatial laws. Once trapped, it was very difficult to escape.

“Bastard, release me, or I’ll exterminate your entire sect!” roared the Six Horn Sea Serpent. Being trapped by a little die infuriated him.

“My entire sect is just me. Go ahead,” said Hu Feng indifferently. Every generation of the Gambling Heavenly Dao only had one person.

“Bastard, do you think a little die can trap the king of the sea demons?!” The Six Horn Sea Serpent suddenly released his trident and formed hand seals. After that, his manifestation appeared behind him, and endless sea water gushed out.

The die quickly began to fill up, but it also expanded as it filled.

“As expected of a king of the sea demon race. At this rate, one incense stick’s worth of time will be my limit,” said Hu Feng. He hadn’t expected this Six Horn Sea Serpent to be able to find the weakness of the Heavenly Fate Die so quickly.

The Heavenly Fate Die’s space was not limitless. Once it was full, holes would naturally appear, allowing the person trapped inside to escape.

The Six Horn Sea Serpent possessed a natural talent in controlling sea water, while his manifestation was an endless space. It was definitely bigger than the space of Hu Feng’s Heavenly Fate Die.

“Release me, and I will not pursue your offense!” roared the Six Horn Sea Serpent.

An incense stick’s worth of time was a short time, but his hatred toward Long Chen meant that he couldn’t even wait a few seconds. He wanted to ruin Long Chen’s plans at the most crucial time to make Long Chen hate him. That was the only way to satisfy his need for vengeance.

“Sorry, I owe Long Chen a huge debt. I must stall you.” Hu Feng shook his head. He formed hand seals, and the Heavenly Fate Die appeared behind him with the Six Horn Sea Serpent still trapped inside. He then rushed over.

“Bastard! Stop! Where are you taking me?!” roared the Six Horn Sea Serpent.

Hu Feng ignored him. He waved to Long Chen and the others before vanishing from sight. Only the Six Horn Sea Serpent’s roar remained in the air for a short time before also fading away.

“That idiot.” Ye Ming snorted disdainfully.

That expert of the Six Horn Sea Serpent was too foolish. Despite having such power, he didn’t have the brains to use it properly.

If they hadn’t been using the sea demon race as their most powerful shield at the rear, he would refuse to work together with such an idiot.

Not only was the Six Horn Sea Serpent stupid, but he was obstinate too. He wasn’t cooperating with them, instead focusing on his own plans.

If he had just listened to the arrangements from the start, they wouldn’t have been forced into such an awkward state at this time. Now, he had been brought away by Hu Feng. Ye Ming, Zhao Ritian, and the others clenched their teeth furiously.

Fortunately, the army of the sea demon race had come. Their Spiritual Strength was trash, but they had plenty of life energy. Their numbers could not be neglected.

Just at this moment, the karmic hell flames on the altar began to change. The scattered flames began to gather together.

“What’s going on?!” Zhao Ritian shouted.

“That bastard Long Chen, he’s able to control the flames from a distance!” Ye Ming was shocked.

The altar’s formation was actually unable to block Long Chen’s Spiritual Strength. That was already shocking enough, but now Long Chen was controlling the flames through the formation. That was completely unnatural.

All their expressions quickly changed as those flames gathered. That was because a flame lotus was slowly forming.

“Impossible! How can he use a magical art through space?” Even Feng Fei’s expression changed. Just thinking about Long Chen’s World Extermination Flame Lotus gave her a chill.

If this lotus exploded here, other than a few of them, everyone else would be dead.

According to reason, any magical art would need hand seals, requiring a combination of the body, mouth, and will. It also could not be used away from the body.

However, despite this principle, the flame lotus had definitely formed, terrifying everyone.

“Don’t be afraid, he definitely won’t be able to unleash it with the power of the previous one!” shouted Ye Ming.

“Even so, can your altar block it?” asked Zhao Ritian.

“Ah…” Ye Ming was at a loss for words. If the altar was damaged, everything they had done up to now would be useless.

“After bragging for so long, you’re still just shameless trash. You even wasted so much of our manpower and treated us like dancing monkeys! I’ll slaughter you!” raged Zhao Ritian.

Ye Ming was truly disappointing. Even with so many people helping, even with four million warriors of the divine families, their failure was imminent.

“Is there no way to save things?” Feng Fei stopped Zhao Ritian, trying to maintain her calm. Casting blame was meaningless at this time, and it was not just Ye Ming’s fault. Long Chen and the others had surprised them with their power.

“These flames are infected with the Heaven Devouring Fiend King’s karma. Whoever touches them will lose their life for sure. Not even divine items can touch them. Long Chen is only persevering because he realized this.” Ye Ming took a deep breath. Long Chen was truly terrifying. Despite this being his plan, it was now Long Chen who was in charge of things.

“Fuck, I’m going to start killing them! That’ll disturb Long Chen!” raged Zhao Ritian.

“Other than the Dragonblood Legion, you can’t kill anyone else. Have you forgotten the ancient immortal treaty?” demanded Feng Fei.

Zhao Ritian furiously punched the air. “Then what?! Are we supposed to watch as we fail?!”

Ye Ming and Feng Fei were silent. Based on the ancient immortal treaty, there were certain things that they were not allowed to do. They would be unable to dodge the consequences of such a thing.

“Long Chen, you had best stop, or you’ll regret it for a lifetime.”

Suddenly, a voice rang out from the sky. Everyone looked up to see two figures.

Upon seeing them, killing intent exploded out of Long Chen. The Martial Heaven Alliance’s disciples roared furiously.

“Dongfang Yuyang, if you dare to touch a hair on senior apprentice-sister Lingshan, we’ll definitely tear you to pieces!”

The two figures were Dongfang Yuyang and Ye Lingshan. Dongfang Yuyang had his hand around Ye Lingshan’s throat.

Ye Lingshan was pale and covered in wounds. She was bloody, and her body was shaking as if she was enduring some kind of irresistible pain. It seemed as if she wished to control her body and stop the shaking to keep people from worrying, but she was still twitching involuntarily.

The normally mighty Ye Lingshan was now like a sheep for the slaughter with Dongfang Yuyang’s hand on her throat. The Righteous path’s experts’ eyes turned scarlet.

At some point, experts from neutral factions had gathered around the battlefield. Even they were infuriated.

“Dongfang Yuyang, are you even a person? How can you call yourself a generation’s heavenly genius when you use a weak woman to blackmail others?” Even the neutral experts were cursing Dongfang Yuyang.

“A weak woman? Haha, the future leader of the Martial Heaven Alliance counts as a weak woman? I defeated her, so she’s my captive now. How I deal with her is up to me. Furthermore, I’m not some brainless fighter. Do you think I’d be a fool and not use the cards that I’ve captured?” Dongfang Yuyang sneered at them and then turned to Long Chen. “Don’t you think you should stop now? Or are you going to force me to kill her so you can take the infamy of being a useless fellow who just watches as others die?”

“Dongfang Yuyang, you’re absolutely contemptible.” A voice suddenly rang out from the midst of the neutral experts. This person drew quite a few gazes.

This was the heavenly genius of one of the four everlasting families, the Ximen family’s Ximen Tianxiong. He had once been enemies with Long Chen, but later, for unknown reasons, he had chosen to retreat to the neutral faction.

“I’m contemptible? Who do you think you are? You’re trash who can’t even pick a side. What qualifications do you have to even speak to me?” Dongfang Yuyang sneered at Ximen Tianxiong before ignoring him. He turned back to Long Chen. “I’m ordering you to stop. Did you hear me?”

“Dongfang Yuyang, are you in such a rush to die?” Long Chen clenched his fists tightly, his voice coming from the cracks between his teeth. His anger had reached a peak.

Dongfang Yuyang suddenly took out a dagger and stabbed it into Ye Lingshan’s shoulder. Her body quivered intensely, but she didn’t make a sound; blood flowed out of her mouth.

“Dongfang Yuyang, you little fucker!” The Dragonblood warriors immediately took out their weapons. Killing intent filled the air.
