Chapter 3317 Dark Lifeforms

“Scram!”

With Kun Wu blocking his way, Long Chen snorted and directly unleashed a punch.

BOOM!

Kun Wu then blocked with his own punch. When their two fists collided, golden flames erupted.

After that, Kun Wu grunted and was knocked back. As for Long Chen, his fist was ignited by the golden flames.

Long Chen looked at his burning fist and coldly said, “Not bad. Your core true flame is mine.”

Kun Wu was a member of the Feather race with a trace of the Kunpeng’s essence blood, so he had a core true flame, and it was extremely powerful. If it was placed on the Heavenly Flame Rankings, it could enter the top fifty.

No wonder he was so arrogant. If his flames touched someone else, they would definitely be incinerated to ashes. But Huo Linger simply absorbed these flames, making them unable to harm Long Chen.

BOOM!

Just then, the void shuddered. At the core of this giant sphere of light, rainbow hydrangeas were blooming. At the same time, all the flame energy within heaven and earth became lively.

As soon as those flame flowers appeared, Long Chen and Kun Wu ignored each other and shot toward the core.

People went crazy. The experts lying in the dark no longer bothered concealing themselves. Their auras were fully unleashed as they charged to the core.

They all wanted those rainbow hydrangeas, which seemed to be the seeds of fortune. Whoever could gather the most would most likely be chosen by the Heavenly Rainbow Flame.

The appearance of the rainbow hydrangeas signified that the fight for the Heavenly Rainbow Flame had officially started. So, everyone went crazy.

BOOM!

At this moment, the void was torn apart, and demonic qi filled the world. A giant burning ape appeared, its body bigger than a mountain. It then spread its arms, devouring the rainbow hydrangeas.

When the rainbow hydrangeas fell on his body, they appeared on his back. He instantly absorbed over ten of them.

“This is an immemorial demonic beast, the Raging Flame Heavenly Ape!” The elders watching from a distance cried out in shock.

“It’s probably an expert from outside this heaven. Our Darklight Heaven isn’t suitable for the demon race’s cultivation.”

“Experts from outside this heaven… Then this competition…” These elders grew more and more worried for their disciples and descendants.

The next moment, space cracked like a mirror and black qi filled the air. A dual-horned lifeform with bat wings charged into the core, with devil qi exploding out of him.

“A lifeform from the dark world!”

Shocked and furious cries rang out. That lifeform’s devil qi was horrifying. Anyone touched by it screamed and rotted in the blink of an eye, turning into skeletons that fell to the ground.

“Ignorant spirit lifeforms, the Heavenly Rainbow Flame is fated to belong to my devil race.” That lifeform laughed, his voice sharp, piercing people's ears like a needle and stabbing their souls. People fled from him.

“Devil world gate… open!”

That lifeform formed hand seals, and a giant spatial gate appeared in the air. When the gate opened, a torrent of lifeforms from the devil world charged out.

These lifeforms killed people on sight, and they all possessed overwhelming devil qi. They were shockingly ferocious.

BOOM!

Just then, another spatial gate opened. An intense sensation of death then seeped into this world.

A skinny man in strange robes with a spear stood on top of the spatial gate. He sneered at that expert from the devil race. “The Heavenly Rainbow Flame is fated to belong to your devil race? Not necessarily. You aren’t placing my Netherworld in your eyes.”

Upon hearing that he came from the Netherworld, Long Chen’s heart shook, and he hastily looked over. Even the Netherworld’s lifeforms could pass through to the Darklight Heaven? Then couldn’t he find Leng Yueyan and Ming Cangyue in the future?

As that gate opened, the death qi of the Netherworld poured out. The Netherworld’s experts also charged into the battlefield.

“Hmph, it’s up to who has the most ability,” sneered the lifeform from the devil race. He didn’t seem surprised by the appearance of the Netherworld’s experts.

However, the appearance of the devil world and the Netherworld’s lifeforms stunned the Heavenly Rainbow Domain’s experts. Just what was going on? Was some immense battle between races about to start here? The dark world’s lifeforms had actually charged into the immortal world. Was this the spark that would rekindle the flame of that ancient battle?

“Geniuses of the human race, retreat!” One of the elders shouted, wanting to at least save his own disciples.

“It’s useless. The barrier blocks our voices,” said another elder.

This sphere of light was its own world, and Divine Lords and above could not enter. Even their voices were unable to penetrate it, so they could only watch.

“Then what do we do? If we gather reinforcements now, it should still be on time. We have to eliminate all these dark lifeforms!”Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

“Their spatial gates are opened within the domain. In other words, once they snatch the Heavenly Rainbow Flame, they’ll immediately leave. We won’t be able to touch them,” said an Immortal King of the Heavenly Rainbow Domain.

“No need to rush. True experts aren’t raised but made on the battlefield. Weren’t there so many experts that had gotten bored and started causing trouble? Now that some real experts have come, they can start killing.”

As this person said this, the interior of the barrier had descended into a chaotic battle. Everyone was fighting for the rainbow hydrangeas.

The dark world’s lifeforms had appeared, so the human race’s experts now had a target to fall on.

However, although the human race had a numbers advantage, people gradually found that the human experts were fighting for themselves, while the dark lifeforms were united. More and more human experts were dying. In comparison, only a small number of the dark lifeforms fell.

As for other lifeforms that didn’t belong to the human race, for example, the Feather race, the Titan race, and the others, they didn’t attack the human race, but they also didn’t focus their attacks on the dark lifeforms. As long as no one provoked them, they were only focused on the rainbow hydrangeas.

Unfortunately, in this chaotic battle, the powerful heavenly geniuses of the human race acted as if this had nothing to do with them. They were only focused on gathering the rainbow hydrangeas, and they occasionally killed their competitors.

Long Chen charged into the core. There were countless rainbow hydrangeas flying around him, but he wasn’t in a rush to grab them. His gaze swept across the battlefield.

With just a single glance, Long Chen sensed many powerful auras. Some of them were still lying in wait. However, those experts gave him a sensation of mortal danger.

“Boss, not good! Yu Xuan is in danger! I have to go save her!” A tablet was flashing in Qi Yu’s hand. That was a special keepsake from Yu Xuan.

When she gave it to him, she said that if she was on the border of life and death, it would flash. As long as they were within a certain distance, his tablet would sense it. Only now did Qi Yu learn that Yu Xuan had also come here.

“Over there!”

Qi Yu suddenly pointed in a certain direction. They then saw the devil race’s experts slaughtering human experts over there.

“Let’s go!”

Without a second word, Long Chen brought his group charging over to that group of devil experts.
