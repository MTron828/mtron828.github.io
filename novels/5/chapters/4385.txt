Chapter 4374 Tearing Apart a Kunpeng

The golden Kunpeng was torn apart swiftly, coming and dying in the blink of an eye. He was slain before the experts behind him could catch up to him.

“NOO!”

A heart-rending cry came from the distance, and another enormous Kunpeng soared over. It was the young Kunpeng’s father. When he saw his son being slain in front of him, his killing intent exploded.Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“DIE!”

The old Kunpeng roared. His entire body’s Blood Qi instantly ignited as he went into a frenzy. He summoned even greater Eternal power in exchange for his essence blood.

BOOM!

A giant golden wing slashed down like a heavenly saber, shaking the sky with its Eternal Qi.

“You feel pain? That’s right. Only when you know pain do you understand reverence. When you understand reverence, you learn to respect life. Only then do you refrain from using your power to casually kill others and wipe out entire races," Long Chen said, looking at the Eternal expert coldly. His voice echoed like the murmuring of a god, resonating throughout heaven and earth.

“Die, you goddamn human race!”

The Kunpeng race’s Eternal expert exploded with fury. Seeing Long Chen still casually talking, he slammed his golden wing down.

BOOM!

Long Chen didn’t dodge. Instead, he raised his hand, seven stars shimmering above it, and braced for the impact. With an explosive sound, his arm quivered intensely, and blood dripped down. This enormous wing’s power was truly terrifying, forcing Long Chen to stagger backward. With each step, the void behind him collapsed.

It was on the seventh step that Long Chen finally managed to stabilize himself and stop that enormous wing.

The Eternal expert unleashed a thunderous roar, channeling all his might into a forceful push. Divine radiance flowed on top of his feathers as he tried to crush Long Chen in the most brutal way possible.

However, no matter how he pushed, Long Chen was like a boulder. After those initial seven steps, he remained unshaken, defying the Eternal expert's every attempt to break his resolve.

As for the wound to his hand, it quickly healed, and then he looked at the Kunpeng race’s Eternal expert.

"Did you ever consider the wrath, the agony, and the bitterness of the human race when you obliterated them? Did even a trace of compassion cross your mind as they cried out and begged for mercy?" Long Chen questioned.

“Your human race is nothing more than an inferior lifeform! How can you compare to us?!” roared the Eternal expert in response.

“An inferior lifeform?”

Long Chen's eyes turned instantly frigid, a surge of his own killing intent emanating from within. The next moment, the temperature of the world around them plummeted, casting a sudden darkness.

“Alright… if, in your eyes, the weak are deemed inferior and have no right to live, then we’ll see today just who is the inferior race!” Long Chen declared.

Long Chen’s anger erupted, and the starry sea behind him flowed as seven stars ignited with intense radiance, enveloping the world in a celestial glow. Long Chen’s hand then clenched around one of the Kunpeng’s wings.

The enormous Kunpeng howled in agony as Long Chen forcibly tore off his enormous wing.

The pain woke him up from his fury, and with only one wing remaining, he attempted to flee.

However, Long Chen was quicker. In a swift motion, he intercepted the fleeing Kunpeng expert, catching hold of the remaining wing and yanking it.

The Eternal expert of the Kunpeng race found himself unable to evade, and Long Chen forcefully ripped off the final wing with lightning speed.

It had to be known that Long Chen’s wings came from a heavenly genius of the Kunpeng race, renowned for its exceptional speed. As Long Chen’s power grew, it stimulated these wings, awakening their latent potential and enabling them to manifest their most formidable divine abilities. Hence, in terms of speed, Long Chen outpaced even the experts of the Kunpeng race.

Long Chen tossed the two wings into the primal chaos space. After that, his hands transformed into claws and ripped through the very void. Two enormous dragon claws then extended out of the void, grabbing the Kunpeng’s claws.

“If the human race is inferior, does that mean your Kunpeng race is noble? Then let me see if your noble body can stop my inferior power!” roared Long Chen.

The Kunpeng screamed in terror, struggling with all his power. Yet, Long Chen seized his claws with ease, akin to someone grabbing a chicken's legs.

As Long Chen pulled lightly, the two dragon claws tore the enormous Kunpeng in half in front of countless shocked gazes.

Golden Eternal essence blood rained down, adding a layer of gold to this world.

A sea of people gathered around the gate of the humanless world. Upon receiving the news, they hurriedly rushed to the scene, arriving just in time to witness Long Chen tearing apart an Eternal expert. That scene left them in awe.

Standing in the air while drenched in the blood of the fallen Eternal expert, Long Chen resembled a god of destruction, his killing intent still ablaze.

“Kill him!”

Just then, the reinforcements from the humanless world finally arrived. Seeing Long Chen tear apart that Eternal expert, they were aghast and incensed. Hundreds of Eternal experts, along with millions of heavenly geniuses, surged forward in response.

“Kill!”

When Long Chen saw them, his eyes reddened, and his killing intent erupted once more. He actually shot toward their enormous army like a shooting star.

Long Chen charged into their midst, delivering a powerful fist that obliterated an Eternal expert of the devil race.

Yet, a sharp blade suddenly stabbed through Long Chen’s back; it was the horn of a horned bone devil. This single horn was even sharper than an Eternal divine weapon, successfully breaching Long Chen’s defenses.

“I’ll tie him down! Kill him now!” shouted that horned bone devil. His devil qi then erupted, invading Long Chen’s body to prevent him from moving.

Crack.

However, to his surprise, Long Chen twisted his body after being stabbed, and the once proud horn on the bone devil’s head was forcefully snapped.

BANG!

Following that, Long Chen’s fist smashed into that horned bone devil’s head, causing it to explode like tofu struck by a hammer.

“He’s injured! Quick!”

The rest of the humanless world’s Eternal experts collapsed upon Long Chen.

Long Chen grimaced as he pulled the horn out of his chest. The black horn still glimmered with an icy light, now tainted by Long Chen's blood.

“So, it actually feels good to be wounded,” Long Chen mused, examining the horn and his own blood. His voice then took on a demonic tone, and black qi gathered in his pupils.

“KILL!”

Long Chen let out a sudden roar, his voice resonating like the overlord of the world. The horn in his hand erupted with starlight, and he thrust it forward.
