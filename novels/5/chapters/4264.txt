Chapter 4253 Long Clan’s Grand Elder

Long Aotian had spoken to Long Chen in the beginning and then never made a move again. He had been in the Long clan’s camp the entire time, watching everything play out.

After Zhao Xingtian eyed the Jiang clan and the Jiang clan said that they would not participate, he turned to the Long clan, only for Long Aotian to directly threaten him.

“You…!” Zhao Xingtian was naturally enraged.

“Shut your mouth. I, Long Aotian, do not need anyone to judge my actions, nor do I need to explain my actions to anyone. Do what you want to do, and I will do what I want to do. No one can force me to do anything. My target is Long Chen. I will kill Long Chen, and I will also take the karmic luck fragments. Anyone who blocks my path will be slain by me. You, Zhao Xingtian, should do your best not to test me, or this day next year will be the anniversary of your death,” said Long Aotian coldly.

“Long Chen is already being dealt with by Xu Xin-er. Are you not just trying to take advantage while everyone else fights?” sneered Zhao Xingtian.

“Xu Xin-er? That trash? She thinks that a snake, a chick, and a kitten are enough to stop Long Chen. What a joke. If Long Chen really was so weak, I’d have long since killed him,” sneered Long Aotian.

The immemorial beasts: the Storm Heaven Devouring Python, the Blue Eye Golden Scale Eagle, and the Blood Mark Sabertooth Tiger were actually called a snake, a chick, and a kitten by Long Aotian.

“Who do you think you are to criticize my housepets?!” shouted Xu Xin-er.

“You are all idiots. You don’t even know how foolish you are,” sneered Long Aotian. Ignoring her, he looked at Long Chen. “How long are you planning on hiding your power? Is it interesting constantly pretending to be the pig to eat the tiger?”

“I have never pretended to be the pig to eat the tiger. I disdain doing such a thing. However, my battles are never fair, and I always have so many enemies. It’s never one against one, so I have no choice but to use my power smartly in order to deal with unknown dangers. If the heavens gave me a chance to have a fair fight, I’d directly unleash my full power in the simplest, most direct manner. Unfortunately, the heavens do not give me such a chance,” said Long Chen indifferently.

Long Chen was different from others. In a fight like this, he had to conserve his energy. Not only did he have to calculate his own energy stores, but he also had to calculate the energy of his companions as well.

He couldn't afford any miscalculations because every mistake meant the loss of lives.

Long Aotian and the others could fight recklessly because they had numbers. They had no misgivings and also didn’t care about the life and death of the ones around them.

“What a joke. In front of absolute power, all schemes are worthless,” sneered Long Aotian.

“That’s right. Since you’re so confident, why don’t you directly kill all the others, and then we can have a fair one-on-one fight?” proposed Long Chen.

“You…”

“Who doesn’t know how to brag? You want a fair fight with me, but you’re also afraid of it. You’ve already lost to me countless times. You have no confidence to win against me, so you are waiting for me to exhaust a certain amount of energy before fighting me,” said Long Chen disdainfully.

“Bullshit!”

This time, Long Aotian’s face twisted with anger. After all, Long Chen’s words were like a poison needle stabbing his heart.

That was because all those words were true. Last time, in the underground tomb, he and Long Chen had fought a heaven-shaking battle, and that had been the moment when he was the most confident, because he had improved immensely. From the mortal world to the immortal world, he had long since undergone a complete transformation and was no longer the old Long Aotian.

He had been one hundred percent confident back then but was still defeated by Long Chen. This time, he had once more made major breakthroughs. Even the Long clan’s ancestral patriarch said that he was the most talented genius that he had ever seen in this lifetime.

In the current world, it was very difficult to find someone who could fight him in the same realm. It could be said that in the entire Long clan, he was the only one to receive the recognition of the patriarch.

Hence, he had come to the Sage King Convention with great confidence, but for some reason, the moment he saw Long Chen, that rock-solid confidence began to shake.

In truth, at this moment, there were two voices in Long Aotian’s mind, one telling him to attack Long Chen right now, to crush him in the most convincing manner.

However, there was also another voice telling him not to be brash, that he wasn’t a match for Long Chen, that if he wanted to beat Long Chen, he had to wait until Long Chen had revealed some weakness.

Long Aotian had not said anything all this time precisely because these two voices were arguing inside of him. They were like the whispers of the devil, almost driving him insane. Although he looked calm on the surface, his inner heart was in turmoil. He didn’t know what to do.Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

To have this vulnerability laid bare by Long Chen left Long Aotian fuming and in a state of panic. He could no longer maintain control over his emotions.

There was no way around it as he had been defeated by Long Chen too many times, leading to the birth of a heart-devil. Although the Long clan had used every means necessary to help him suppress his heart-devil, he was still unable to fully erase his fear of Long Chen.

In fact, someone in the Long clan even suggested sealing Long Aotian until Long Chen was dead.

However, someone in the Long clan also said that this was the worst possible choice. If Long Chen did die, Long Aotian’s heart-devil would never be fully erased.

Thus, Long Aotian had come for Long Chen. He had to personally defeat Long Chen, as that was his only way to become a peerless expert.

However, Long Chen’s words had struck him in his weakest spot. Seeing his twisted expression, the Long clan’s experts outside the martial stage couldn’t help but sigh.

“If there really is no other choice, perhaps we must injure Long Chen for Long Aotian to kill him,” said one of the Long clan’s elders.

If Long Chen was present, he would instantly recognize that this person was the Eighth Protector Elder of the Long clan who had gone to see him.

Other than him, there were several other elders with auras as vast as seas. They were all clearly innate Heaven Venerates.

One elder in particular looked like the leader. This elder’s expression was solemn, and he appeared dignified and imposing.

“They are both sons of the Long clan. Why must they kill each other? The patriarch’s vision does not go far enough this time,” said the elder, looking at Long Chen with a complicated expression.

Upon hearing this, the expressions of the surrounding elders underwent drastic changes. Was this not criticizing the patriarch?

“Grand Elder, that’s a bit rebellious. Are you not afraid of the patriarch hearing of it?” said the Eighth Protector Elder.

“It is the truth. What can he do if he hears of it? Good criticism is hard to swallow, and the words of the most loyal people are the hardest to take. Unfortunately, the patriarch always has people who only know how to sweet-talk around him. Those people have truly harmed the Long clan.” That elder snorted coldly.

This elder was the leader of the eight grand Protector Elders, and his status was exceedingly high. In fact, it was said that he was of the same seniority as the patriarch. Thus, his status was particularly special in the Long clan.

The other elders’ expressions twitched, but they didn’t say a word. Inside their hearts though, they resented this elder. However, despite this, they didn’t dare to even look at him for fear of him sensing it.

The Grand Elder also didn’t look at the eight Elders. Instead, he was staring at Long Chen and Long Aotian. At this time, Long Aotian’s hand slowly clenched the hilt of his sword, and his terrifying killing intent slowly flowed out.
