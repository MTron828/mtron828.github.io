Chapter 4198 Mastery of the Cloud Dragon Immolation Claw

BOOM!

Within the space of the immortal character, a resounding explosion rocked the heavens as Long Chen unleashed his claw in a seemingly casual manner. The dragon claw that had always sneak attacked him in this space was shattered, while Long Chen was completely unharmed.

Whenever the dragon claw reappeared, Long Chen’s claws fought it off, causing the void to be torn apart repeatedly. This space seemed to be on the verge of collapse.

Long Chen roared, his dragon blood boiling inside of him at full power. This feeling gave Long Chen an unprecedented carefree feeling.

Before this, Long Chen had only been capable of unleashing his dragon power in the simplest, crudest methods. He had been like someone with endless wealth who didn’t know how to spend his money.

But then, with the dragon expert’s guidance, Long Chen finally learned how to spend his money. Every attack now was brimmed with full power. It had been a long time since Long Chen had engaged in such a carefree battle.

“Cloud Dragon Immolation Claw!”

With a roar, his fingers transformed into hooks, and golden light blazed on his fingertips like five brilliant stars.

BOOM!

The next moment, the world around him vanished, and Long Chen once more appeared in the palace. The immortal character’s world had been forcibly torn apart by him.

“Hahaha, this is what the Cloud Dragon Immolation Claw is supposed to be! Not bad, not bad!” The dragon expert’s voice rang out in Long Chen’s mind. This time, it was full of delight and pride.

“It’s all thanks to senior’s pointers,” said Long Chen respectfully. He truly was grateful for this expert.

“There’s no need for such nonsense between us. Good brat, I really didn’t misjudge you.” The dragon expert laughed, no longer sounding the slightest bit disappointed. In truth, Long Chen’s accomplishments had greatly surpassed its initial expectations.

After all, Long Chen was from the human race, so for him to control the dragon race’s divine abilities was as difficult as defying the heavens.

The dragon expert’s previous anger was actually an act to make Long Chen focus on cultivation. After all, Long Chen had many things to deal with, and his focus was being dragged in every direction.

So now that Long Chen had reached the mastery of the Cloud Dragon Immolation Claw, it couldn’t contain its excitement and repeatedly praised Long Chen.

This praise also made Long Chen feel excited. To obtain the approval of an expert like it was an immense honor.

However, Long Chen didn’t dare to let himself soak in this feeling for too long. After all, he didn’t want to be cursed again. He quickly looked back at the bone stele and searched for some other inheritances that he could comprehend.

“You don’t need to look any longer. This dragon bone only has one powerful technique of the true dragon race, while the rest are divine abilities of the other dragon races. It would be meaningless for you to learn them. They might even lead you astray,” said the dragon expert, seeing through his thoughts.

“The techniques of other dragon races?” Long Chen couldn’t help looking at the palace master.

“This little fellow is from the dark barbarian dragon race. His bloodline is very pure, but what's most remarkable is his unwavering dragon soul; it is as solid as a boulder. He even used that drop of your blood to summon the power of the true dragon in this immortal character space. He actually made his opponent even stronger than himself,” said the dragon expert approvingly.

“He made his opponent even stronger than himself?” Long Chen was shocked and looked at the palace master’s large back. A profound sense of respect welled up within him.

As expected, the palace master was truly terrifying. In order to get a stronger opponent, he actually asked for a drop of Long Chen’s essence blood to strengthen his opponent.

It was no wonder that he was injured. It was intentional, as he wanted an opponent that was even stronger than himself.

“There’s no need for you to look at the other immortal characters. This is all the destiny you have in this place; the rest of the techniques are useless to you. Furthermore, you have reached the second level of the Dragon Soul Body Forging Art. Upon mastering this technique, you have raised the mastery of all similar-level techniques. In other words, you could learn any other technique now, but it wouldn’t help you,” said the dragon expert.

“Senior, since that is the case, can you transmit more divine abilities to me?” Long Chen couldn’t help asking. The dragon expert was incredibly mysterious. Even now, Long Chen had no idea just what kind of existence it was. If he could gain its divine abilities, perhaps he really would be unrivaled.

“It cannot be done,” said the dragon expert helplessly. “My dragon race’s divine abilities have no records for you to consult. They are mostly continued through the bloodline and soul. The fact that you could learn my Dragon Soul Body Forging Art is mostly thanks to luck. When it comes to my other divine abilities, you could only gain them by studying my reverse scales. I have no way of directly transmitting them to you.”

The dragon race’s divine abilities were always transmitted through the bloodline and soul. Although it was possible for the bloodline and soul to decline over time, causing some divine abilities to be lost from the world, the runes continued to remain in the bloodline and soul. They entered a slumber to protect themselves.

Eventually, they might awaken many generations later. This kind of awakening was then called an ancestral regression.

Thus, cultivating the dragon race’s divine abilities required that hidden power to be lying dormant in one’s body first. Just like farming, there could be no harvest without first fertilizing, weeding, and watering. But all of that effort would be meaningless if you simply didn’t have the land to harvest in the first place.

Without the bloodline inheritance, there was no land to farm. Although Long Chen had managed to absorb true dragon essence blood, he was neither part of the dragon race, nor was he a hybrid descendant of the human race and the dragon race. Thus, for him to cultivate the dragon race’s divine abilities was truly as difficult as ascending the heavens.

His success in cultivating the Dragon Soul Body Forging Art could already be considered a miracle. Back then, the dragon expert had been struck by enlightenment and had wanted to pass down its self-created technique. But at the time, the dragon expert had been fully prepared for the possibility of failure.

In truth, Long Chen’s success was almost unbelievable. However, given that the Dragon Soul Body Forging Art was a self-created technique, perhaps this was why Long Chen had managed to train in it. The dragon expert could not say anything for sure.

However, other than the Dragon Soul Body Forging Art, the rest of its divine abilities were transmitted through the bloodline and soul. So only when one of its descendants reached the necessary realm would they have a chance to awaken these abilities. Teaching them to Long Chen was impossible.

Hence, if Long Chen wanted to learn more techniques of the dragon race, he would have to comprehend them himself. Even the dragon expert couldn’t help him.

Hearing this, Long Chen was disappointed. If only he had managed to learn more than three techniques from the dragon king reverse scale. Thinking back, he really had lost out.

Just then, he sensed something behind him. Upon turning back, he was pleasantly surprised to see Bai Shishi.

The current Bai Shishi had golden divine radiance flowing around her, and every step she took caused a golden lotus to bloom on the ground.

Those golden lotuses were strong and kept her firmly in place. When she had come up, she had almost been blasted away by the palace master’s pressure.ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

“Shishi, you came!”

Long Chen was delighted by her arrival. He was about to walk over when the High Firmament Palace swayed.

“Not good. Time’s almost up!”
