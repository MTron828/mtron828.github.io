Chapter 4167 Hero, Spare Me

Long Chen heard Bai Shishi’s voice the moment he set foot into those ruins. Following that voice, he saw the beautiful Bai Shishi in a golden dress standing not too far away.

A golden divine radiance enveloped her, and even amidst the ruins, these dilapidated structures seemed to exude a hint of grandeur solely because of her presence.

What was different from before was that Bai Shishi now had a sword on her back. That was the sword that Long Chen had taken from the strange lifeform on the Ghost Ship.

Her golden dress billowed gracefully around her. She was already a peerless beauty, but the divine light that enveloped her enhanced her regal aura, leaving those who saw her feeling inherently inferior by mere comparison.

As Bai Shishi cast a cold gaze upon Long Chen, he responded with a gradual, warm smile. Their eyes locked in a silent exchange, and in no time at all, Bai Shishi found herself unable to restrain a blush from creeping onto her cheeks.

She wanted to turn away and not look at him, but that would be admitting that she had lost. Thus, she continued to stubbornly stare at Long Chen.

Seeing that she couldn’t last, Long Chen spoke first, “I’m sorry. I had too many things to deal with. But as soon as I finished, I came here as quickly as possible. Where are Xiaole and the others?”

“Don’t change the subject. Why didn’t you bring Qingxuan?” demanded Bai Shishi.

Long Chen instantly felt a headache. “Her… Qingxuan is refining pills and in seclusion. I didn’t want to call her out.”

“Are you sure that’s the reason? Is it not because you were afraid that I would do something to her?”

“The main reason was because I thought that it would be a bit awkward,” said Long Chen, his awkwardness quite palpable in his words.

“Awkward? Why? Are you afraid of me bullying her?” demanded Bai Shishi.

“How could that be? Why would you bully her? You’re a kind person,” said Long Chen hastily.

“You’re a bad guy. I knew that you arrived earlier, so I spent days guarding this place because I was worried about being rude to Qingxuan and making a bad impression if she came while I wasn’t here, and you… you…” Bai Shishi’s eyes reddened, and a few tears leaked out.

Long Chen was startled. Bai Shishi had actually come here much earlier? It seemed it was all to express her goodwill to Yu Qingxuan.

Long Chen knew Bai Shishi’s character. She was someone who cared more about face and pride than her own life. But for him, she was willing to suffer this kind of grievance. Knowing this, Long Chen felt both moved and ashamed.

“I’m sorry. I’ve made you suffer.” Long Chen walked over to Bai Shishi and held her hands.

“Stop. Others will see.” Bai Shishi hastily pulled her hands out of Long Chen’s grasp, feeling both shy and angry.

The tears in her eyes were like crystals, and she was like the lofty pear flower that stood proudly against the rain. Her appearance was beautiful yet heartbreaking.

“Who cares if someone sees? I like you. I’m not afraid of others knowing,” said Long Chen.𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

Hearing this, Bai Shishi blushed even harder, but she was deeply moved inside. Although she had known Long Chen for so long, and even shared life and death with him, it was his first time making such a frank declaration.

While it wasn't an overly serious declaration, it did reveal his true feelings to her. But although she liked it, she glared at him. “Who has a face as thick as yours?”

Hehe, success!

Looking into her rebuking gaze, Long Chen smiled inside. Finally, the sky was clear after the tempest, and he had passed this point.

“Shishi, you get more beautiful every time I see you. How did you do it?”

“Scram, bastard! Don’t try talking to me like that! You think saying a few nice words will make me forgive you? And what do you mean, how did I do it?!” demanded Bai Shishi.

Although she knew that Long Chen was attempting to ease her anger with his charming words, her current display of anger was feigned. In truth, the moment that she saw Long Chen, she was no longer angry.

In fact, she almost hated herself. Originally, she had been planning on tormenting him for not coming to see her after so long. However, she found that she couldn’t even muster up the energy to be angry. Was this the fate that her mother had warned her about? When a woman fell for a man, would she really no longer have the ability to struggle?

“You’re increasingly beautiful, but I haven’t made the slightest improvement. I’m still the same as before. When I’m with you, it’s like a swan standing next to a toad, a phoenix beside a crow. The pressure is great!” Long Chen shrugged helplessly, winking.

Despite knowing that he was intentionally teasing her, Bai Shishi couldn’t help but laugh, feeling both embarrassed and angry. She knew that she had lost this time.

Bai Shishi then reached out and viciously pinched the soft flesh of Long Chen’s waist.

“Aiya!” Long Chen cried out. Bai Shishi was truly vicious this time. That soft hand of hers instantly became a metal pincer, breaking even Long Chen’s defenses.

“Hero, spare me!” pleaded Long Chen.

“Who is a hero? Are you mocking me for not being womanly enough?” raged Bai Shishi.

“No, no, it was a slip of the tongue! Heroine, spare me!” Long Chen hastily corrected himself.

Only then did Bai Shishi glare at him and pull back her hand. She finally smiled with a pleased expression as her resentment faded away.

If she wasn’t a hero, what was she? Only a hero would have that much power. Long Chen rubbed his waist and saw that the pinched skin was already purple.

“Congratulations, fairy Shishi. Your power has advanced yet again. Perhaps I’ll need to rely on your protection in the future. I hope senior can be magnanimous and keep me in your care,” said Long Chen shamelessly.

“Why don’t you heal? Doesn’t it hurt?” asked Bai Shishi.

“It was my bad, so a punishment is only natural. Only with a bit of pain will I remember the lesson,” said Long Chen. “Furthermore, compared to what you went through, this is nothing. Although you never told me what price you paid, I know it.”

With this, Bai Shishi suddenly threw herself into Long Chen’s embrace. Her fists repeatedly struck his chest as she wept.

“You bastard, are you trying to take my life with those words?”

Bai Shishi was like an aggrieved child who had finally found an outlet.

Someone as prideful as her had given up her pride. How could she not? She had previously looked down on her mother who was willing to share a man with another woman, but now she was even worse.

Sometimes, she felt terrified and helpless. She didn’t know why she put herself through this.

Love was the curse with no cure. No matter how she struggled, she could not extricate herself from it. No matter how strong someone was, in front of love, they could only admit defeat.

And yes, just those simple words from Long Chen caused her to feel like she had lost. She was gratified and panicked, while also feeling happy and bitter.

In Long Chen’s embrace, she finally felt true peace. Long Chen also let her vent, knowing just how much pain this prideful fairy had in her heart.

“Oh? When did the High Firmament Academy become a hookup place?”

Just then, a sinister voice rang out. Unbeknownst to them, a group of people had appeared near them.
