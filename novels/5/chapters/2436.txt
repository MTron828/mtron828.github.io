Chapter 2426 Moving Out for the Star Field Divine World

Translator: BornToBe

At this moment, the life and death energy within Long Chen’s body had reached an eighty-twenty proportion. His life energy was growing stronger, compacting the space of his death energy.

However, although his death energy shrank, it grew more condensed. It was as if the pressure of the life energy was refining it.

Upon entering the second Heavenstage of Netherpassage, Long Chen sensed his five stars and 108,000 astral spaces transformed once more. His astral spaces in particular had grown larger and stronger.

The most unbelievable thing was that despite his spiritual space not growing again, his Spiritual Strength grew more solid. It was now much stronger than before.

The downside of entering the second Heavenstage was that he found that his life energy was now finding it very taxing to compress his death energy, even with the help of the Tiger Bone Life Spirit Pill.

His death energy had reached a certain level of density that it was resisting any further compression. Fortunately, he had Ling-er giving him an unending supply of pills. He was consuming demonic pills one after another.

If the outside world saw this, they would definitely die of shock. A top grade twelfth tier demonic pill could make a Netherpassage expert instantly explode.

Ling-er was even more excited than Long Chen. She didn’t pause. She finished each furnace of pills in just a few breaths’ time.

That made Long Chen jump. Was this really alchemy? It seemed more like she was cooking meatballs with how fast she was going.

Long Chen had Ling-er slow down a bit. She was in such a rush because this process of refining demonic pills was activating many inactive runes on her body.

The more demonic pills that she refined, the more demonic spiritual energy she absorbed from the air. That energy was the crux of awakening those runes.

Long Chen was worried about Ling-er growing too excited and damaging her core in her hurry. Then it would take a long time to recover.

However, Ling-er said that she knew what she was doing and kept her energy recovery in the back of her mind. Since she was so sure that she wouldn’t injure herself, Long Chen didn’t bother her further.

Hours flew by. Long Chen estimated that he had consumed over three thousand Tiger Bone Life Spirit Pills since reaching the second Heavenstage. Finally, another explosive sound rang out.

A wave of qi erupted out of Long Chen, breaking through the formation and whirling into the sky.

Life energy made greenery cover the mountain in an instant. Withered trees once more germinated.

Long Chen felt a youthful energy pulsing within him. It felt as if he could nourish all things within this world. It was an indescribable feeling.

In that instant, Long Chen felt like he had been reborn. He felt completely different from before.

“My life energy has reached ninety percent, with my death energy having been compressed to the pinnacle. I can freely control life energy.” Long Chen clenched his fist, excitedly sensing the changes in his body.

He almost cried out upon sensing the changes to his body. His mind-sea had started to give rise to soul runes.

Those runes were as tiny as specks of dust, but they were definitely present. Before this, his Spiritual Strength had been formless, but now, he found that these runes were moving as he wished. Although he hadn’t used them in battle yet, he was confident that if he gathered all his Spiritual Strength once more, he definitely wouldn’t have his defenses instantly pierced by Feng Fei’s life soul beast.

“I really want to fight her again.” Long Chen clenched his fist. Last time, he had lost in the soul competition. If the Divine Gate Star hadn’t taken action, the consequences would have been unthinkable. But now that he had reached the second step of Netherpassage, his Spiritual Strength had also grown. The Netherpassage realm was truly inconceivable.

“Perhaps the reason my Spiritual Strength lost to Feng Fei’s was because of my realm. Feng Fei has never revealed her own realm.” Long Chen suddenly recalled that he didn’t truly know Feng Fei’s realm.

He looked toward his astral spaces. Life spiritual qi filled them. When he linked them together, he felt endless energy within his body. He had an urge to find a powerful expert to fight. It had been a long time since he had felt his energy grow so explosively.

“Boss!”

Just as Long Chen was immersed in his delight at advancing, Guo Ran came rushing in due to the disturbance.

“You’ve advanced to the second step so quickly?!”

Guo Ran was shocked. Long Chen had only been back for two and a half days. He had yet to even reach the first step when he had arrived, with his life and death energy still not being separate, but he had now reached the second step.

The Dragonblood warriors had the blessing of the Heavenly Daos and Liu Ruyan’s Yin and Yang energy. Their cultivation bases could only be described as soaring daily. Qu Jianying and the elders could only sigh when they saw that.

However, Long Chen had progressed even faster than them. That was beyond monstrous.

“This is pretty slow. My goal was to reach the third step.” Long Chen shook his head.

“Damn…” Guo Ran almost coughed up blood. That was far too arrogant.

Long Chen’s goal had truly been the third step. But he was requiring far more medicinal pills than he had anticipated.

Before this, when he had calculated that he had enough pills, he had Ling-er stop refining the Tiger Bone Life Spirit Pill. He could sense that her aura was flagging. In her excitement, she hadn’t noticed.

Now, he had a few leftover Tiger Bone Life Spirit Pills. He tossed them into the primal chaos space. Even if he had no use for them, he couldn’t sell them to others. That might cause a calamity.

Originally, Long Chen had wanted Ling-er to refine some Death Spirit Pills, but Ling-er was too excited. He was afraid of her secretly refining beyond her limits, so he decided to put a pause on things.

“Has the time come?” asked Long Chen.

“Yes. The Martial Heaven Alliance’s people have gathered. The alliance head had me come get you,” said Guo Ran.

Long Chen nodded and left toward the palace with Guo Ran. There were hundreds of thousands of disciples gathered in the plaza in front of the palace.

Cheers rang out when those disciples saw Long Chen. The news that he had fought to a draw with Feng Fei had reached all their ears.

When Feng Fei had come, almost all of them had personally seen her peerless beauty and power. She was someone venerated like a god, an unrivaled existence, but Long Chen had still drawn with her.

Meng Qi, Chu Yao, Tang Wan-er, Ye Zhiqiu, Dong Mingyu, Liu Ruyan, Cloud, Gu Yang, Song Mingyuan, Li Qi, and Yue Zifeng were leading the Dragonblood Legion’s warriors. All of them were like sharp divine weapons ready for combat.

Bao Buping, Chang Hao, and the rest of the Heaven Splitting Battle Sect’s disciples were present. Meanwhile, Hua Shiyu and Zhao Ziyan were leading the elites of the Xuantian Dao Sect.

The disciples from the various sects of the Martial Heaven Alliance were all here, waiting to move out. They looked at Long Chen emotionally.

“Long Chen, it’s almost time. Do you want to say a few words?” asked the old man.

“The alliance head would be more suited to such a thing,” said Long Chen. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

“Jianying has spoken. You can add a few more words. After all, upon entering the territory of the divine families, everyone will be listening to you. You can state any plans you have now,” said the old man.

Qu Jianying had said some encouraging words before Long Chen had arrived. If nothing else, she wanted them to cherish this opportunity. They were to be careful and not cause unnecessary trouble.

“Alright, then I’ll say some simple words.” Long Chen nodded and stood before everyone. Overlooking the hundreds of thousands of disciples, his voice rang out loud and clear. “Brothers and sisters of the Martial Heaven Alliance, we will be entering the Star Field Divine World in search of chances to increase our realms and change our fates. You’re all aware of the tribulation approaching this world, so I won’t talk about that. You know how serious this situation is. What we need to do is use our limited resources to get as strong as possible. We cannot give up the slightest chance that will allow us to survive the upcoming tribulation. Every bit stronger you get is a bit more hope for the Martial Heaven Continent. So, what I want to tell you is, we will not be causing trouble in the Star Field Divine World, but if anyone dares to provoke us, whether they’re from the Corrupt path, the ancient races, the ancient family alliance, or even disciples from the divine families, you still need to slap them in the face.”

The old man smiled, while Qu Jianying sighed. This little fellow was always like this. She asked everyone not to cause trouble, while Long Chen encouraged them.

Qu Jianying glared at the old man and suddenly reached out and viciously pinched his waist. She realized that he was dissatisfied with her words from before, and rather than say it himself, he had used Long Chen to speak.

Long Chen continued, “I am not joking. At this time, even the slightest chance can determine whether you live or die. This relates to the very survival of the Martial Heaven Continent. We won’t take opportunities from others, but if others want to take your opportunities, then it’s not just bullying at this point, it is murder. You don’t need to be courteous to such people. As long as you are not in the wrong, then don’t be afraid. Beat them. If you can’t beat them, call for me and I will beat them. Remember, anyone who is against us is our enemy at this time. Mercy and compassion are not for enemies. We will definitely encounter many trials within the Star Field Divine World. The pickings are slim, and there are many people fighting over them. Conflicts will definitely occur, so remember to be united. Only by being united can we avoid being picked off one by one. That is the only way to increase our chances of survival and win more opportunities, understood?”

“Understood!”

The disciples roared with passion. Hearing that they didn’t need to give face or concede to anyone, not even to the divine families, lit a blazing fire within them.

“Move out!”

Long Chen shouted, and the disciples poured into the transportation formation.
