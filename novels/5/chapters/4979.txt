“The Jiuli Tower? How come I’ve never heard of it?” asked Long Ziwei, surprised to hear of it. Despite being ranked tenth in the Heaven Rankings and growing up in the Long clan, he had no knowledge of such a place.

The Heaven Overseer replied, “You aren’t strong enough. Normally, it’s only open for Eternal experts, and each opening has limited spots. Amongst the Divine Venerate disciples, only Long Tianrui has entered the Jiuli Tower. The others aren’t qualified.”

Hearing this, Long Ziwei was shocked. Long Tianrui, ranked first in the Heaven Rankings, was a legendary existence. Up until now, Long Ziwei had never seen anyone capable of challenging her. Her position as rank one remained unassailable.

Sealed since the ancient era, this heavenly genius was cloaked in mystery. No one knew her true power.

Rank two and three were already Heavenly Chosens, yet no one had ever seen them fight her. As for the rank four, he didn’t even have the courage to challenge those above him. He was just fighting to keep his position.

Even once rank two and three became Heavenly Chosens, they never dared to challenge Long Tianrui. Thus, Long Tianrui was synonymous with the word unrivaled amongst the Long clan’s junior generation. She was an untouchable existence.

“Is this why you told me I had to visit the Long clan?” Long Chen asked the Earth Cauldron.

“Yes. It is very important to you. Furthermore, it originally belonged to you and your father,” replied the Earth Cauldron.

At this moment, the Heaven Overseer explained, “The Jiuli Tower is our Long clan’s highest-level secret. Ziwei, it’s enough for you to know. Don’t tell anyone else.”

“Disciple understands,” promised Long Ziwei hastily.

The Heaven Overseer continued, “The Jiuli Tower is a divine object from the primal chaos era—a tower where the Jiuli race’s disciples trained in. Although the passing of countless eras means we no longer know how to perfectly maintain it, causing much of its divinity to fade, its power is still shocking. Someone not strong enough would be heavily injured by the broken laws inside. They might even be killed. In any case, the era has changed. Using the primal chaos era’s cultivation standards to judge this era’s disciples is naturally biased. Thus, the Jiuli Tower, which used to be for Divine Venerate disciples to train in, is now for disciples of a higher level.”

“The Jiuli race?” asked Long Chen, staring at the Heaven Overseer in disbelief.

Looking at Long Chen with a solemn expression, the Heaven Overseer responded, “That is right. Within you flows the blood of the Jiuli race. Furthermore, it is the purest main bloodline.”

The Heaven Overseer’s words hit Long Chen like bolts of lightning, triggering a flood of memories.

Long Chen had discovered the primal chaos bead in the Jiuli secret realm, and when he studied Jiuli immortal runes, his comprehension speed was astonishing. Moreover, when Long Chen encountered the expert from the Heavenly Eye race, that expert stared at him oddly when he mentioned never having seen anyone from the Jiuli race.

It became clear that the expert from the Heavenly Eye race had recognized his Jiuli lineage long before Long Chen himself realized it.

“Are we really descendants of the Jiuli race?” Long Ziwei asked, astonished. This was the first time he had heard such a thing.

“This secret is normally only revealed when one reaches the Eternal realm. However, telling you a bit in advance is fine. Just keep it secret,” advised the Heaven Overseer.

Long Chen couldn’t believe it. So, he and his father were descendants of the Jiuli race? He couldn’t calm down for a long time.

Back in the mortal world, they had been nothing more than ants. How could they be descendants of the Jiuli race?

The Jiuli race was the strongest branch of the human race. Just how did the strongest end up like this? If this was the case, was there any hope left for the human race?

The Heaven Overseer said, “I know it’s hard to believe. But that’s fine. You can just act like it’s not true if you wish. In truth, the Jiuli race’s light has long since faded, and its descendants are barely surviving. You cannot randomly reveal this secret, or you will draw a calamity onto yourselves.”

Long Chen took a deep breath and tried to calm himself down. No wonder his father had said that coming to the Long clan was nothing more than taking back what was his. Hence, Long Chen needed to live up to his father’s convictions and should not feel indebted to the Long clan.

These things were left behind by the Long clan’s ancestors for their descendants. Any descendant of the Long clan had a right to those things. Taking them would not make Long Chen indebted to the Long clan.

At the same time, Long Chen understood why his father would directly charge into the Long clan. That saved him a great deal of time that would have been wasted on worthless words.

“Many thanks, Heaven Overseer, for telling me all this. I will remember this kindness,” said Long Chen.

The Heaven Overseer was truly someone worthy of respect. Just this knowledge and magnanimity were deserving of respect, but even more so was how sincerely he was treating Long Chen.

Shaking his head, the Heaven Overseer said, “Back then, I really hoped to pull you into the Long clan so that you would grow up in the Long clan. Once you matured, you would lead the Long clan and guide the others back to the correct path. Now, I find that it was nothing more than a delusional dream. The Long clan has long since become rotten to the core. There is no way to free it from its corruption.

“I am only helping you because I don’t want the Long clan’s resources to be dominated by a group of fools. Unable to use them themselves, they are also unwilling to share them with others. They simply waste those opportunities.

“I must say, your father is the one with true wisdom. Last time, he showed unprecedented killing power and decisiveness. Through his bloody means, the Long clan finally felt fear. What the Long clan is afraid of is his rapidly climbing power. His potential is limitless.

“Your father has paved the path for you. If the Long clan had the slightest brains, they shouldn’t stop you. They should give what should have been yours to gain a favor from you. Unfortunately, the higher-ups are unimaginably stupid. They’re still raising their own factions to fight for more authority in the Long clan. They’re as short-sighted as rats.

“This time, the situation on the martial stage has reached a point of no return. They didn’t dare to kill you, nor could they let you kill Long Zaiye. So they brought me in as a mediator.

“But be prepared mentally. The Long clan won’t give in easily. Luckily, you hold the strongest card. I don’t need to tell you what to do, right?”

Long Chen nodded. It was that simple. Regardless of their terms, all he had to do was refuse. He came here to claim what was rightfully his. If they resisted, he would take it forcefully. If they had the guts, they could try to kill him.Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

Long Chen said, “I’ll just say my father told me everything, and anyone who doesn’t like it can go find him.”

“Hehehe!” The Heaven Overseer chuckled. “As expected of a dean. You grasp it well.”

With this approach, Long Chen would shift all responsibility to Long Zhantian, not implicating the Heaven Overseer.

At that moment, a melodious bell chimed across the entire Heavenly Desolation Domain. The Heaven Overseer rose to his feet.

“Let’s go. They’re waiting for us.”
