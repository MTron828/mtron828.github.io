Chapter 1963: 1963

“That’s where you’re wrong . Long Chen is my man, so he’s your man too . Why shout and quarrel with your own people? If you think about it, Long Chen is my man, but then you became his woman . I should be the one angry,” said Leng Yueyan with a faint smile .

“Leng Yueyan, so you know that you were me and I was you? Then why did you harm me like this? He’s a mortal... do you realize this affects my divine root?” raged the other Leng Yueyan .

“Why would I harm you? Do you not know? Didn’t you precisely come here in order to kill me? I’m no longer under your control . Is it painful being hurt by me? When you killed my father, my mother, and my sister Nianrou, did you think about my pain?” Leng Yueyan sneered . “There is a certain phrase on the Martial Heaven Continent: man proposes, god disposes . But even gods aren’t omnipotent . How is it? Having your own bone slice your hand, does it hurt?”

The other Leng Yueyan’s hand was still pressed against the bone sword . The bone sword had actually connected with her palm . They had temporarily merged, and she couldn’t pull back .

“I laid down this trap with the evil dragon essence soul and a totem with the Corrupt God’s faith energy . I thought that you would just send one of your clones, but you actually sent your true body . No wonder none of the alarm systems I set up managed to sense you . But due to that, you actually ended up falling into my man’s hands . How interesting . Your divine mark has also been damaged . It seems my man is quite good . ” Leng Yueyan smiled upon seeing the divine rune on the other Leng Yueyan’s forehead had dimmed .

“I didn’t come to kill you!”

Leng Yueyan shook her head . “Even if you didn’t come to kill me, you came to arrange me as a chess piece . But I’m not going to be your chess piece . ”

“You are me, I am you! There are no chess pieces between us . ”

“I am just a strand of your divine will . I am the clone, while you’re the true body . You wouldn’t create me for no reason, and you wouldn’t come here for no reason . I am just a chess piece for you to achieve your goals . ”

“Then what do you want?”

“What do you think? I want to take the dominating position . I’ll succeed the position of the true body . ”

“You want to refine me?!” The other Leng Yueyan laughed furiously .

“My original plan was to kill your clone and devour it to strengthen myself . I thought that was pretty brazen already, but I didn’t think that there would be someone even more brazen than me . So I’m thinking of going a bit crazy as well . ”

“Do we really need to fight to this extent? I don’t want to destroy you . ”

“This is fate . ”

Leng Yueyan’s bone sword suddenly lit up . . The hand it was piercing began to turn to stone . The stone crept up her arm . .

The other Leng Yueyan suddenly tore off her right arm . However, this time, there was no blood . Her arm instantly regrew . She slammed her two palms together, and black qi surged out . Her dress instantly became black, and she became a manifestation of death . With a wave of her hand, a black bridge appeared . A divine pressure came from that bridge .

BOOM!

Leng yueyan’s sword shattered the bridge . She smiled . “I’m familiar with your abilities . This place is the Martial Heaven Continent, not your world . You would probably have had to split yourself into at least ten million clones before your true body could sneak through the barrier of this world . Now your divine root has been damaged, and your power has sharply dropped . As for me, I have the evil dragon essence soul and the Corrupt God’s energy . You’re the one who will be defeated today . ”

Leng Yueyan’s bone sword sliced through the air . However, the other Leng Yueyan also took out a bone sword . The two began an intense battle .

When their two bone swords clashed, a wave of Sword Qi shot out . Long Chen hastily dodged . That Sword Qi cut the cave in two .

The cave exploded, and Long Chen saw that they were in a barren wasteland . Up in the sky, a black dragon image appeared . Behind it was a giant totem from which divine light sprinkled down . Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“Fuck, that’s my essence soul!” roared Evilmoon . However, that essence soul was no longer truly there . Leng Yueyan had used some method to transform it into a part of some grand formation .

The dragon essence soul combined with the energy of the totem, creating a giant domain .

“Hmph, these two energies can’t last for long . Once they’re exhausted, you’ll lose . ”

“They’ll be enough to handle you . ”

Leng Yueyan’s manifestation suddenly surged, and a figure identical to her appeared, a bone sword in its hand .

Leng Yueyan’s attack power soared . She was so powerful that she forced back the other Leng Yueyan repeatedly .

The void rumbled . Tribulation clouds condensed in the sky, and the Leng Yueyan wearing a black dress suddenly looked up with fear .

“It seems luck is standing on my side . Your aura has been sensed by the Heavenly Daos . This is a godless world . You have broken that order, and will definitely die . ”

Heavenly might descended from the sky . The divine rune on the other Leng Yueyan’s forehead lit up once more . A ray of light soared out of her sword .

The world changed color . The laws of the world crumbled before it . Long Chen was in the distance, but he felt like he was going to be sliced apart .

“Are you going all-out now?”

Leng Yueyan suddenly gripped her sword with both hands . The dragon and totem images behind her suddenly exploded, and all their energy was absorbed by her .

BOOM!

Long Chen was blown into the distance by the shockwaves of this attack . He almost coughed up blood .

As for the two Leng Yueyans, they were both knocked back, coughing up blood . Their auras were sharply dropping .

“Long Chen, stop her!” shouted Leng Yueyan suddenly .

Almost instinctively, Long Chen slashed Evilmoon at the other Leng Yueyan .

BOOM!

That Leng Yueyan coughed up blood . The previous exchange had heavily injured her . Her divine mark had vanished . She was on her last legs .

Long Chen pressed his saber against her neck . She didn’t say anything . She just coldly stared at him .

“Long Chen, kill her!” shouted Leng Yueyan .

Long Chen looked at the other Leng Yueyan . He knew that he should kill her . But he wasn’t able to make himself do that .

The sky rumbled . The heavenly punishment would fall at any moment . Even if he didn’t kill her, she would die to that law .

In the end, Long Chen sighed and pulled back Evilmoon .

“Go!”

That Leng Yueyan was surprised . But she coldly snorted, “I won’t feel any gratitude to you for this . You blasphemed me . I will still make you suffer an eternal hell in Purgatory . ”

“Up to you . ” Long Chen shook his head .

That Leng Yueyan stepped back and sliced the air with her bone sword . The void was torn apart . She glanced back at Long Chen before stepping into that crack, vanishing .

Once she was gone, the heavenly might that was gathering in the sky faded, having lost its target . This heavenly might was something that even Long Chen didn’t dare to provoke . It was heavenly punishment designed for gods .

“Bastard, why did you release her?!” Leng Yueyan walked over, furious . She was pale and tottering, looking like she might collapse .

Long Chen reached out to support her, but she pushed him aside . Clearly, she was truly angry .

Long Chen couldn’t say anything . Finally, Leng Yueyan sighed, “Sorry, I shouldn’t get angry with you . ”

Leng Yueyan was actually apologizing? That greatly surprised him .

Leng Yueyan shook her head . “I was too greedy . I thought that she would just send a clone, but she sent her true body . Now her true body is heavily injured, That’s a huge chance for me . I shouldn’t be greedy . Long Chen, I know you’re a good person . Your character will never change, although you’re sometimes an idiot . But I like this foolishness of yours . ” Leng Yueyan caressed Long Chen’s cheek . “Fine, since you didn’t kill her, I’ll have to do it . Otherwise, she’ll come after me once she’s healed, and I won’t be able to stop her . Goodbye, my man . If I manage to survive, I promise that next time, I’ll let you subdue me . ”

A rare gentle expression appeared on Leng Yueyan’s face . She wrapped her arms around Long Chen’s neck and gave him a kiss on the face .

She then sliced her bone sword through the air, stepping into the void and vanishing .
