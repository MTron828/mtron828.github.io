Chapter 3543

Long Chen repeatedly struck his gong, causing a sound that was so loud that it hurt people’s ears. For such a sound to ring out just as everyone was acting carefully infuriated countless experts. They were all afraid of Long Chen waking up those Heavenly Flame Spirits.

“Look at all you cowards. My life is at risk too, but you don’t see me afraid. What are you so afraid of? Just look, these Heavenly Flame Spirits won’t wake up no matter how loud of a ruckus you make! Are any of you men? Come and see the scenery around me! Why can’t you be like boss San and piss on top of the head of a fifth Heavenstage World King Heavenly Flame Spirit? If you record it with a photographic jade, then once you leave the Heavenly Flame World, you can leave this photographic jade to your descendants to show just how badass you were back in the day!” Long Chen snorted disdainfully at them.

After Long Chen said this, quite a few people were moved. If they recorded themselves in similar spots as where Long Chen was, then once they spread it, it would definitely cause huge waves.

The cultivation world cared more about reputation than anything. If they really managed to record themselves in such a badass scene, they would be able to brag about it for a lifetime.

As a result, quite a few people really carefully crept on top of the heads of these Heavenly Flame Spirits and activated photographic jades to record just how heroic they were.

“How shameless! Is a fourth Heavenstage Heavenly Flame Spirit worthy of you? Can’t you get some bigger guts and be like Boss San?” Long Chen sneered at them, occasionally glancing at Zhao Mingxuan and the others.

They had noticed something off with him, and they felt like he might have seen a treasure. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Although they were afraid of Long Chen conning them, in the end, skillful people had the biggest guts. They had trump cards and numbers on their side. After discussing it, they decided to go take a look.

Just as they were stealthily creeping forward, Long Chen so brazenly invited everyone to come. Hence, they hesitated slightly.

After all, they knew too little about Long Chen. They didn’t know just what kind of medicine he had in his gourd.

If it was just one or two, or even three or four fifth Heavenstage Heavenly Flame Spirits, perhaps they wouldn’t mind. They could just run.

But there were too many of them here. Once they went crazy, in the chaos, no one could guarantee that they would escape alive.

“What cowards. Let me tell you, there are many treasures up here! If you still don’t come, I’m going to take them all myself!” declared Long Chen, looking at Zhao Mingxuan and the others a bit impatiently.

How could someone like Long Chen not know what Zhao Mingxuan and the others were thinking?

They were suspicious that there were treasures here. But Long Chen wasn’t afraid. If they dared to come up, he would attack these Heavenly Flame Spirits. With so many of them erupting at once, as he had the Lightning Body Blink, he would be the only one with the assurance of escaping unscathed.

If he couldn’t obtain something, then no one else should get it either. Hence, Long Chen was particularly fearless, and this fearlessness made the others even more worried. Zhao Mingxuan and the others continued to hesitate.

“I suspect that he is trying to scare us off. Perhaps he really is stealthily taking the good stuff right now,” said one of the heavenly geniuses. A slightly sharp light glinted in his eyes.

Clearly, he was very confident in himself. He felt that if Long Chen wasn’t afraid, then they had nothing to fear either.

Long Chen might just be bluffing, or maybe he was double-bluffing. But who cared? They had so many people. They had to take the risk. In the worst-case scenario, they would simply end up in a life-and-death situation. They would see just who managed to survive then.

“I think he is being deliberately mystifying. In my opinion, it’s better for the others to retreat, while the thirteen of us attack together. Whether or not there are any treasures, killing Long Chen is the first thing to do. I can’t stand him,” said Wu Yang.

“That’s right, we’ll attack together. We all have trump cards, so who is afraid of him?” The other agreed with this thought.

They very quickly made their move. Other than thirteen heavenly geniuses, the other experts that belonged to their powers stealthily retreated.

As for the other lifeforms, seeing this scene, they smelled something off and also began to withdraw.

Seeing Zhao Mingxuan and the others’ actions, Long Chen sneered. Huo Linger was busily gathering those stone eggs. Just now, the final one was pulled in, and everything down below was now empty.

“Huo Linger, what do you think? Can we eliminate a few of them?” asked Long Chen.

“Probably not. Using the Phoenix Blood Heavenly Silk Net used up quite a bit of my core energy. I only have about seventy percent of my combat strength left. In the Phoenix Blood Heavenly Silk Net’s damaged state, using it takes too much energy. It doesn’t seem to be the right time to fight them now,” said Huo Linger.

Only then did Long Chen recall that the Phoenix Blood Heavenly Silk Net was damaged. Although it was capable of repairing itself, the process still required some time.

Using it in this state would only be half as effective. Thus, Huo Linger said that now wasn’t a good time.

“But looking at their arrogant faces makes me really irritated.” Long Chen crossed his arms across his chest, rubbing his chin with a hand. Looking at Zhao Mingxuan and the others, he frowned.

He disliked them. At the same time, they also didn’t like him. In their eyes, Long Chen was a hateful hopping clown.

In the Fallen Immortal Pavilion and the Wine God Palace, they had lost all their faces in front of Fairy Qingxuan. That was the greatest humiliation of their lives.

Now that the Soaring Dragon Company had announced a bounty on him, they had a righteous reason to kill him. They were the ones who wanted him dead the most.

Thus, even though there were so many Heavenly Flame Spirits in the surroundings, they were going to attack. They would see if they could kill Long Chen and prove just how much they hated him.

The others quickly scattered. Zhao Mingxuan and the others started to creep toward Long Chen, and they clenched their weapons.

Just then, all the Heavenly Flame Spirits slowly woke from their slumber. Zhao Mingxuan and the others’ killing intent disturbed them.

“Attack!”

Zhao Mingxuan roared and his manifestation appeared. After that, endless killing intent locked down on Long Chen, and a blazing divine flame spear pierced toward him.

“Do you think that I’ll attack just because you tell me to? Do you think that I’ll give you that face?” Long Chen looked at him disdainfully and didn’t even bother to block that spear.

Suddenly, Long Chen was thrown into the air, but it wasn’t him that had moved. The Heavenly Flame Spirit that he was standing on roared and threw him. It then opened its mouth, shooting an exploding flame sphere at Zhao Mingxuan.

BOOM!

The flame sphere exploded and that spear wrapped in divine flames pierced straight through it without any resistance, stabbing that Heavenly Flame Spirit in the head.

What shocked Long Chen was that this attack directly killed the bull that he was standing on. That Heavenly Flame Spirit then transformed into runes.

“What a powerful World Domain divine item.” Long Chen’s heart shook. That spear was amazing.

“Die!”

Just then, another heavenly genius’s sword slashed down, tearing through the void. The Sword Qi made people’s bones shiver. This was also another powerful World Domain divine item.
