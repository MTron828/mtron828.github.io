Chapter 4188 Fight or Fuck Off

That girl called Xin-er had tried to forcibly take the Violet Pupil Nine Tail Fox. She was tyrannical and even used an Eternal divine weapon directly, nearly causing permanent damage to Bai Xiaole’s eyes.

It had to be known that Bai Xiaole cultivated pupil arts. If his eyes were permanently damaged, he would be a complete cripple. Such an outcome would be even more agonizing than death for him.

From top to bottom, not one person in the Xu family was reasonable. The younger ones tried to take the Violet Pupil Nine Tail Fox, and the older ones tried to capture the Luo sisters. Due to this, Long Chen’s fury could not be quelled any longer.

He no longer cared about any misgivings. Who gave a shit about the relationship between the Xu family and the Luo family now? The most important thing was to get justice for Bai Xiaole.

“As I see it, you’ve gone insane! If you want to die so badly, I’ll kill you right here and now!”

That Xin-er bellowed furiously. When she heard Long Chen's demand for either her eyes or her life, her eyes became filled with a murderous intent. She summoned her violet-gold bell once more into her hand.

The rest of the Xu family were also shocked and enraged. Long Chen was practically not placing the Xu family in his eyes, causing the Xu family head to seethe with anger. He had taken a step back, but this fellow actually pushed him even further.

Bai Xiaole remained silent, and it was the Violet Pupil Nine Tail Fox on his shoulder who said, “No need. This is our enmity, and we will exact our own vengeance. Have them scram. Brat of the Xu family, just wait. I’ve remembered this enmity. The next time we meet, you will regret your foolishness.”

The Violet Pupil Nine Tail Fox glared at the woman. To be treated as a mere housepet to be seized was a profound insult to the proud and arrogant creature.

“A little fox dares to say such big words! The next time we meet, I’ll turn your fur into a scarf!” sneered Xin-er.

“It’s meaningless to say vicious words now. If you have the power, use it at the Sage King Convention!” said the young man of the Xu family. He had exchanged a single blow with Long Chen and actually wanted to fight him again, but the family head refused to permit him to do this.

The Xu family then returned to their giant ship and slowly flew off. Once it was far off in the distance, Xia Chen, who had been examining the giant ship the entire time, suddenly cried out.

“That ship is actually an Eternal divine weapon!”

“What? How can there be such an enormous Eternal divine weapon?” Guo Ran was stunned.

Bai Shishi and the others were also shocked. If this giant ship was really an Eternal divine weapon, then its power would be enough to destroy the entire world, no?Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

“Thank you for your work, palace master.”

Long Chen cupped his fists to the palace master to express his thanks. If it hadn’t been for him coming, they would have been doomed today.

“It’s too bad. Just a bit off. Next time, work harder.” The palace master looked at the battleship regretfully and sighed before vanishing.

The palace master’s words befuddled everyone here. They didn’t know what he was referring to when he said just a little bit off.

The disturbance here had drawn the attention of countless people. However, they didn’t dare to reveal themselves in front of the Xu family head and the palace master. They could only hide in the distance and observe.

In truth, the moment they fought Gui Xuan, people already started observing from a distance. However, they simply didn’t dare to get too close.

Just as a large batch of experts were closing in on them, the Xu family’s people came. When both the Xu family head and the palace master unleashed their divine might, those people didn’t dare to approach, afraid of getting caught in their battle.

“Long Chen, you dare to swindle me! Hand over my treasures and I’ll spare your life!”

Just then, the devil expert who had won the auction of Long Chen’s second bronze cauldron appeared.

Just like Gui Xuan, he had been swindled by Long Chen. Back then, Gui Xuan had furiously slain that innate Heaven Venerate of the Soaring Dragon Company, throwing everything into chaos.

Because Long Chen had escaped back then, Gui Xuan and this devil elder could only cast their fury on the Soaring Dragon Company’s people.

They really did think that Long Chen and the Soaring Dragon Company had worked together to swindle them. Witnessing their wrath, the Soaring Dragon Company’s experts could only flee in terror, knowing that any attempts to explain would be futile.

They had worked hard to set up this auction, only for it to be blown apart. After venting his anger, the devil expert mobilized all his people to search for Long Chen’s tracks.

As for Gui Xuan, he knew that Long Chen wasn’t in this region, so he waited for Long Chen to return to his base.

His battle with Long Chen then alerted the others, and the devil expert immediately rushed over, only to see that a battle was about to erupt between the palace master and the Xu family head.

The palace master’s divine might had terrified everyone, including this devil expert, who was a powerful innate Heaven Venerate. Even though they were both innate Heaven Venerates, this devil expert knew that he was a far cry from being a match for the palace master.

Due to this, he only dared to come out after the palace master left. Although he spoke firmly, people knew that he was intimidated.

“It was a fair deal, and you simply lost the gamble. I’ve never said that the bronze cauldron was the Heaven Earth Cauldron. The Soaring Dragon Company was the one who pushed that rumor. As for all of you, you were willing to test your luck, so why are you blaming others? There were so many people there, but they didn’t fall for it. Why did you two fall for it? You can only blame your own fate for drawing you into this tribulation,” snorted Long Chen.

Trying to reclaim what Long Chen had seized? This fellow truly didn’t know Long Chen.

“You… you damnable human race, are you forcing me to drag you down with me?!” roared the devil expert.

“What has entered my hands never leaves. Acting shamelessly has no effect on me, so either fight or fuck off,” sneered Long Chen. Just like that, he swaggered past the onlookers, going deeper into the human race’s territory.

“You…!” The devil expert trembled with rage, about to go crazy. However, he didn’t dare to attack Long Chen for fear of the curse.

“Patriarch, as long as you give the order, we’ll slaughter them,” said one of the devil race’s heavenly geniuses. Hearing his words, tens of thousands of the devil race’s disciples stepped forward.

“If you dare to attack, not one of you brats of the devil race will leave this region alive.” Just then, another cold voice rang out.

Following that, millions of experts appeared; they were the Starry River Sect’s disciples. Upon learning that Long Chen was battling some experts here, they swiftly assembled.

Since many of them were in seclusion comprehending the star diagrams, they only brought this many people. But all the free ones had come.

The Starry River line had many people. Furthermore, all of them were powerful, so those devil experts turned pale when they appeared. Just these disciples were enough to completely crush them. If they were to fight, all the devil experts might be completely exterminated.

Just like that, Long Chen and the others swaggered out of their view, and not one of the devil experts dared to move.
