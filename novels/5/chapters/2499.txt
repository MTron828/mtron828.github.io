Chapter 2489 Snow White Robes

The black flood came out of nowhere and was like an evil spear piercing out of the altar. Even the dragon king’s corpse was unable to block it.

An aura of rot and death filled the air. Just looking at the black flood made people feel a sharp pang in their souls.

“This aura… why is it so familiar?”

“It… it’s the aura of the Heaven Devouring Black Armor Corps!”

“Was this altar suppressing the hive of the Black Armor Corps?!”

Everyone’s expressions changed. The loss of the four divine bones had weakened the altar to the point that it could no longer seal the Black Armor Corps.

All of a sudden, a figure charged out of the black flood. It was the Corrupt path’s mysterious expert, Ye Ming.

Startled cries rang out when people saw him. What was he doing inside of the black flood? Was he related to it? Just as everyone was filled with suspicions, they also noticed that Ye Ming was covered in blood. He had many cuts all over him.

A ray of sword-light flashed over. Wanting to block it, Ye Ming roared and unleashed a ray of divine light, but it was shattered by the attack. The sword-light then pierced his shoulder, flying through with a bloody dart.

Staring in shock, people wondered just who was so powerful that they could injure Ye Ming.

From within the black flood came another figure. He wore white robes untouched by dust. Although everyone could see his shoulder-length hair, the strange thing was that they couldn’t see his face.

This white-robed man’s face was unclear, but his body still gave off a feeling of nobility and grace.

This nobility was not one of aloof arrogance, but one that made others feel as if he was worthy of following, a nobility that inspired reverence.

“That’s the aura of a Sovereign!”

A startled cry rang out. This air was something only a Sovereign should possess. So who was this person? Was it another Sovereign sprout? But even Feng Fei and Zhao Ritian lacked this kind of air. Although they were powerful, they didn’t possess this nobility.

“Who are you?!” roared Ye Ming, directly voicing everyone’s suspicions. Was this person from the Star Field Divine World?

The white-robed man didn’t reply. Instead, he turned toward the distant Long Chen.

“It seems you obtained the dragon king’s essence blood. I was one step too late. Even a Sovereign can miscalculate,” said the white-robed man. His voice was simple and gentle, like a spring breeze. But there also seemed to be a sighing tone.

“The dragon king’s essence blood?”

As everyone was shocked, Zhao Ritian roared, “No wonder you had such power! You were using the dragon king’s power. When it runs out next time, I can kill you like killing a chicken!”

It seemed that Zhao Ritian had finally found an excuse to placate his heart. If Long Chen had used external power to beat him, then his defeat didn’t count.

Long Chen ignored him and looked at the white-robed man. “Are you the one who the dragon king senior was waiting for? You are…?” Long Chen shut his mouth. He seemed to know who this white-robed man was. It was no wonder his aura felt familiar.

The white-robed man nodded. “It was supposed to be left for me, but I was delayed when I saw Ye Ming secretly undoing the seal of the Heaven Devouring Fiend King. I was trying to kill him before he could, but I failed. The Heaven Devouring Fiend King’s seal has been released, and the dragon king’s energy has run out. The rest of the Black Armor Corps down below are affected by the Fiend King’s release and are quickly reviving.”

“What?!” Everyone was horrified. The fallen Black Armor Corps could come back to life? Wouldn’t they be enough to destroy this entire world?

“Ye Ming, why would you do this?!” demanded people.

“Because through his special energy, he can control the revived Black Armor Corps. That’s the reason I made killing him my priority,” said the white-robed man.

Everyone, including Long Chen, was appalled. If Ye Ming could control this Black Armor Corps, then ignoring anything else, at least everyone from the Righteous path would be annihilated.

“Brother, my apologies. I told the dragon king senior that he had the wrong person, but he still gave me the dragon king essence blood stone. Now, only half of its essence blood remains. If it’s still useful to you, please take it.”

Long Chen took out the dragon king essence blood stone. Sensing the vast essence blood fluctuations coming from it, countless people grew greedy for it.

“Long Chen, are you afraid now? You want to trade a treasure for your life? I never thought that the grand Long Chen was such a coward.”

Suddenly, Di Feng’s voice rang out. He actually escaped Mo Nian’s interference and flew over.

“Damn brat, come over and fight!” roared Mo Nian, shooting an arrow at Di Feng.

Di Feng’s figure instantly became illusory, and the arrow passed through his body, not doing any substantial damage.

Mo Nian’s battle with Di Feng had been frustrating to say the least. Di Feng had no intention of beating Mo Nian. He only wanted to use his blood sea domain to stall Mo Nian. Within his blood sea, he easily dodged Mo Nian’s attacks.

This blood sea contained the power of an Emperor, so Di Feng was able to freely go between reality and illusory. Mo Nian had yet to find a way to counter this technique, resulting in him being unable to unleash any of his power.

Di Feng couldn’t help being disappointed that Long Chen hadn’t been killed, and so he chose this moment to shout at him.

The white-robed man turned to look at Di Feng. He shook his head. “A possession by an Emperor’s heroic spirit? To hide the real body within the river of time to avoid attacks is an insignificant path.”

“Big words! Who do you think you are to be so arrogant in front of me?” sneered Di Feng.

A ray of Sword Qi shot out. The strange thing was that the Sword Qi clearly appeared first, and only after that did the white-robed man swing his sword. Furthermore, most frightening of all, the Sword Qi had yet to touch Di Feng when Di Feng’s body was pierced.

“What?” Mo Nian was dumbfounded. This sword attack was too bizarre. No one understood what had happened. It was like this sword had passed through the restrictions of time to harm Di Feng.

“Such a heretical path is useless in the end. It’s not even your own power, and it will never cover up your fatal flaws. If there was no karma between us, you would have died to me, Yun Mou’s, sword,” said the white-robed man indifferently.

Di Feng looked down at the wound on his chest that was not healing, his face pale. If that attack had landed on his head, perhaps he would be a corpse now. Just who was this white-robed man to turn his newfound power ineffective?

“Yun Mou!”[1]

Long Chen’s heart pounded. As expected. He was definitely Yun Shang’s descendant. Their surnames were the same.

Long Chen sent the essence blood stone flying toward him. “My apologies. This should have been yours, but I took half.”

Long Chen had received great favor from Yun Shang. Evilmoon was the gift that Yun Shang had left for him, and it had been a loyal companion that had saved his life countless times.

For Long Chen to have taken something that Yun Shang had left for his descendant definitely had the taste of biting the hand that fed you.

The white-robed man received the essence blood stone. When he looked up, this time Long Chen’s heart trembled. He vaguely saw a pair of familiar eyes. They were far too similar.

“Could he be…?”

“No, he’s not Yun Shang. His bloodline fluctuations are very similar, but his spiritual fluctuations are completely different. Furthermore, Yun Shang already became a Sovereign and was branded into the Heavenly Daos. There is no way an identical Sovereign can be born in one world. A Sovereign cannot reincarnate, so he is not Yun Shang,” said Evilmoon firmly.

Having exchanged blows with Yun Shang, having been suppressed by Yun Shang’s seal for all these years, Evilmoon was profoundly aware of his aura. So it was sure that this person was not Yun Shang.

“Many thanks.” The white-robed man cupped his fists. “As expected of the person that Sovereign Yun Shang favors. You are even willing to give away such a priceless treasure. I’ve decided that you are definitely worth befriending.”

Long Chen was unable to remain calm. This feeling of being basked in sunlight, this feeling of having the heart warmed, his tone, his eyes, they were all far too similar to Yun Shang.

Long Chen nodded. “Sovereign Yun Shang blessed me with his favor, and I was never able to repay him. If you are the one to continue the Sovereign’s legacy, I am willing to help you.”

These words shocked everyone. Was Long Chen saying he was willing to help someone else become the number one expert of this world? This was startling, as Long Chen had never submitted to anyone else before.

They then looked at the white-robed man, as well as thought about how they kept talking about Sovereign Yun Shang. A wild possibility appeared in their minds and it dumbfounded them.

“It’s impossible. The five Sovereigns were all solitary figures without partners, let alone descendants…”

Everyone began to suspect his identity, but it was impossible for him to be a Sovereign’s descendant. Unless… was he a Sovereign’s disciple?

The white-robed man smiled. Although his face was unclear, it still gave off a refreshing feeling.

“Sovereign Yun Shang’s will has long since been entrusted to the land of the Martial Heaven Continent. There are no Sovereign sprouts in this world, or perhaps I should say that everyone is a Sovereign sprout. Man or woman, human or not, Righteous or Corrupt, good or evil, every person has the possibility of becoming a Sovereign. The most basic requirement for becoming a Sovereign is to understand what it means to sacrifice oneself. Long Chen, amongst all the geniuses, you are the one that possesses the greatest chance of continuing the legacy of the Sovereigns. You are the one with the greatest possibility of becoming a Sovereign,” said the white-robed man profoundly.

These words made Di Feng, Zhao Ritian, Feng Fei, and Ye Ming’s expressions change. They thought of a frightening possibility.

“Become a Sovereign? He might not even be living past today.”

Ye Ming suddenly took the initiative in attacking the white-robed man with his jagged sword.

Following Ye Ming’s lead, Zhao Ritian, Feng Fei, and Di Feng also attacked, but their target was Long Chen.
