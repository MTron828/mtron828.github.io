Chapter 3279 Cleaning Up the Sect

This woman looked to be around thirty and wore skintight leather with half her chest exposed, giving people a panoramic view of two snow white mountains and a mountain valley.

She possessed the grace of a mature woman, to the point that people almost wished to take a juicy bite of those honey peaches. Her eyes seemed to draw people’s souls in.

However, this extremely alluring woman was a vicious figure. She was the leader of one of the four major powers in the Vile Dragon Domain, the Dragon Slaughtering Guild. Yet, she went by the sweet name of Jiang Yuhe[1]. 

The lotus within the rain swayed ever so gently. Its beauty was moving. However, this lotus was not so tender. There were poisonous thorns beneath its leaves, and its poison was lethal.

Considering that she had created her own power within the Vile Dragon Domain, and even after being mortal enemies with the Azure Dragon Gang she was still living well, it could be seen that this woman was not simple.

She was also an Immortal King, and her aura even felt a bit stronger than Zhao Qinglong’s. Right now, there was another Immortal King behind her along with two half-step Immortal Kings.

The Azure Dragon Gang’s experts tensed up as soon as they saw her. All of them were ready to fight. Although they all followed the unwritten rule of not fighting within this remnant of the ancient city, no one entrusted their lives to this rule.

“Junior brother, are you here to find trouble for the Azure Dragon Gang? If so, big sister supports you!” Jiang Yuhe smiled at Long Chen sweetly.

“How will you support me? Will you help me destroy the Azure Dragon Gang?” asked Long Chen, smiling with just as much sincerity.

“Oh, do you need big sister’s help to destroy the Azure Dragon Gang? I feel like there’s entirely no need. Why don’t you simply kill those two and take over the Azure Dragon Gang? You can be the leader then, and big sister will warm your bed for you. Then you would be in control of two major forces! Doesn’t that sound good?” Jiang Yuhe winked at Long Chen.

It went without saying that her skill wasn’t bad. In addition to her fiery build, she was full of ripened charm that would move any man. She was capable of drawing out a man’s most primitive desire.

However, just who was Long Chen? Which one of his women wasn’t a peerless beauty capable of causing the downfall of a nation? Hence, Long Chen was almost immune to this kind of woman.

He simply smiled at Jiang Yuhe. He knew that she schemed deeply. She was using this method to probe him.

Just as he was about to reply, he felt a slight pain in his waist. Seeing Long Chen and Jiang Yuhe practically flirting with their eyes, Bai Shishi reached out and pinched him. Long Chen was instantly made speechless.

Seeing that small action of Bai Shishi’s, Jiang Yuhe laughed. “Little sister, this is no good. Men should be wild and uncontrollable. Even if they have a heavenly fairy waiting for them at home, they still want to taste wild game. Furthermore, I only mentioned warming his bed, not marrying him. Why are you getting so emotional?”

“Shut up! Who is emotional?!” Bai Shishi frostily glared at this woman. She was merely dissatisfied with Long Chen staring at this woman for so long and had disciplined him. Hence, for this woman to speak so bluntly, Bai Shishi’s face almost reddened.

“Haha, then I’ll keep my mouth shut. Big sister was just joking with you. In any case, if you need help, then go ahead and ask!” Jiang Yuhe laughed, not angry at all. She then simply stood there, seemingly intent on just watching.

At this moment, Long Chen could almost sense other experts secretly watching from a distance. The other two major forces were probably lurking in the dark. But they didn’t have great enmity with the Azure Dragon Gang, so they didn’t come out directly like the Dragon Slaughtering Guild.

Zhao Qinglong’s expression sank. He didn’t know Long Chen’s origins, but based on Jiang Yuhe’s tone, the two were not acquainted. That made him feel a bit better.

“Since no one is acquainted, why would you come here to provoke my Azure Dragon Gang? There must be a reason, right?” demanded Zhao Qinglong.

Long Chen smiled. “A reason? Why do you want a reason? I came to the Vile Dragon Domain to do something big. I am going to restore the seventh branch academy. But I don’t know where it is, so I came to this city to find a few knowledgeable people. And coincidentally, some small fries from your Azure Dragon Gang offended me, so I came here. Then even more coincidentally, I encountered a traitor of my High Firmament Academy! I feel like this is a good chance to make my name here and shake all of you. By slaughtering Qiu Yang, I can clean up my sect, as well as kill the chicken to warn the monkeys. It is two goals with one move, two birds with one stone, two prey with one arrow…”

“Ignorant brat, you are courting death!” Qiu Yang roared. Long Chen’s tone was exceedingly arrogant. He actually turned Qiu Yang into a tool for his own fame, and that was unacceptable for Qiu Yang.

“We can discuss whether or not I’m courting death later. First of all, don’t interrupt me. Let me finish. I know that some others are watching in the distance. I will not beat around the bush. Now that I’m here, you’ll have to listen to me in the future,” said Long Chen calmly.

Hearing this, Zhao Qinglong laughed furiously. In all his years, he had never seen someone so arrogant. Today, his eyes had been opened to the world.

“Listen to you?! Based on what?!”

Zhao Qinglong’s expression was disdainful. He was afraid of the power behind Long Chen, but based on Long Chen’s arrogant words, it didn’t seem that he had other experts backing him.

“Is your head full of shit? This is the Vile Dragon Domain. Everyone here talks with their fists. Why ask what this is based on?”

Long Chen eyed Zhao Qinglong like he was an idiot. He then looked at the gloomy Qiu Yang who was erupting with killing intent.

“Oh, youngster, if I personally attacked you, it would be bullying you. Even if I killed you, you wouldn’t accept your defeat. In order to let you die fully convinced, I’ll pick someone else for you. As long as you can endure ten exchanges against her, I’ll spare your dog life.”

Long Chen then turned to Bai Shishi, and she immediately walked out very obediently. She coldly looked at Qiu Yang. “I’ve heard of your name. You killed fellow disciples while gaining experience in a secret realm to take their treasures. The academy then announced a kill order for you but didn’t expect you to run here. Today, I will represent the academy in cleaning up the sect.”

Although Long Chen had read quite a bit in the academy, when it came to the history of the academy, especially history that was kept secret, Bai Shishi knew more than him.

Thus, as soon as she had learned Qiu Yang’s identity, she made the decision to kill him.

“Hahaha!” Qiu Yang laughed. Ripples spread from his body, and a terrifying aura was unleashed. “A group of idiots who don’t know how high the heavens are! Today, I’ll show you that you’re nothing more than frogs at the bottom of a well!”Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

As Qiu Yang formed hand seals, the sword on his back flew out. At the same time, endless swords appeared in the air, forming an endless sea of swords. All those swords were pointed at Bai Shishi, their sharp auras slicing through the void.

Bai Shishi then looked at Qiu Yang frostily and slowly reached for the hilt of her sword. When a golden mark appeared in her eyes, a chilling killing intent erupted.
