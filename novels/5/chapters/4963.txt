“What?!”

Gui Jiu stared in shock. The events unfolded too rapidly for Fang Liude and the others to fully comprehend, but Gui Jiu managed to follow the sequence. Other than the appearance of a dragon rune on Long Chen’s palm, his movements remained unchanged.

Yet, with that seemingly effortless palm strike, Long Ziwei was sent hurtling backward, even while employing the Heavenly Dragon Attack. Moreover, Long Chen had yet to reveal his true strength.

“You’re really pissing me off! Don’t blame me if you die!” Long Ziwei’s roar filled the air as he formed hand seals. Eight feathered wings appeared on his back, accompanied by an additional fin-like wing along his spine.

“Nine Wings Ignite! Devil Dragon Battles the Heavens!”

Long Ziwei’s wings suddenly burst into flames, his Blood Qi surging as devil qi intertwined within it. Amidst the chaos, the distant roar of a devil dragon seemed to echo, as if a devil dragon had possessed Long Ziwei. His nails grew into long claws, and with a stamp in the air, he shot back toward Long Chen, his claws slicing through the air.

The screech emitted from his claws was so piercing that Fang Liude and the others instinctively covered their ears, fearing their souls might be torn asunder by the sound alone.T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

Long Ziwei’s claws moved with lightning speed, unleashing thirty-six slashes in rapid succession.

Meanwhile, Long Chen maintained his calm demeanor, with one hand tucked behind his back. As if casually strumming a zither with one hand, he effortlessly blocked all thirty-six attacks in a row.

BOOM!

After the final strike, Long Ziwei finally staggered back.

“Senior apprentice-brother Ziwei!”

The women who had come with him were all flabbergasted. They had never expected someone as strong as Long Ziwei to repeatedly lose to Long Chen.

“Are you done yet? You aren’t a match for me,” said Long Chen calmly.

“No!” Long Ziwei shouted, summoning a ring behind him. At this moment, whether it was the six women or Gui Jiu, they suddenly felt empty, as if they had lost their Doyen power.

On the other hand, Fang Liude and the others didn’t sense much. They were so weak that not much of their energy was absorbed.

“The Heavenly Fate Ring. This is Long Ziwei’s strongest state,” murmured Gui Jiu. He stared at that ring of light with great longing and admiration.

“I admit that you’re strong, but I’m still not convinced! This is my full power!”

As Long Ziwei grabbed the long-handled saber on his back, countless divine runes illuminated the blade, igniting the formidable power of a Heaven Saint divine weapon. The sudden surge of energy caused Fang Liude and the others to feel lightheaded.

Pointing his saber at Long Chen, Long Ziwei challenged, “Do you dare to block my saber?”

“Alright. If I block your attack, will you give up on this meaningless challenge?” asked Long Chen.

From Long Ziwei’s attacks, Long Chen could see that Long Ziwei wasn’t actually a bad person. He was just too stubborn to accept this reality.

While Long Ziwei had claimed that this would be a life and death battle and that he would take Long Chen’s life, all he was trying to do was force Long Chen to bring out his full power. He didn’t want to win while Long Chen wasn’t at full power.

“Try to withstand this!” exclaimed Long Ziwei as he clenched his saber with both hands. His Heavenly Fate Ring quivered, sending all the Doyen energy within heaven and earth into his sword.

“Here it comes!” Long Ziwei swung his saber down. This attack contained all his Doyen power, and it fully activated the runes of his Heaven Saint divine weapon.

Facing Long Ziwei’s full-power attack, Long Chen finally adopted a solemn expression and extended his hand.

Evilmoon appeared in his grip, its sinister aura erupting and causing the women on the Heaven Rankings to instinctively retreat in fear.

Evilmoon had completely transformed. After the battle of Heaven Screen Mountain, it had absorbed the blood soul energy of many Heaven Saints, which allowed it to gradually gain control over its body. It was slowly unleashing its core energy.

Seeing Evilmoon, Gui Jiu cheered excitedly. Back then, it was this very man and saber that had slaughtered countless powerful experts, heralding their arrival in the Sovereign Emperor Heaven. Now, Gui Jiu was witnessing that fearsome duo once again.

Long Ziwei roared and swung his saber with all his power. As for Long Chen, he simply snorted and left Evilmoon hanging there, patiently waiting for Long Ziwei’s saber to fall.

BOOM!

The entire mountain valley exploded, and torrential qi waves blew through the surroundings, covering everything in rubble and sand. Even the women on the Heaven Rankings were blown back by the astral winds, unable to remain standing where they were.

Fang Liude and the others felt like they were on the verge of being torn apart. Just as they thought they would die, the pressure suddenly lessened. Gui Jiu appeared in front of them, blocking most of the impact.

A wave of dirt covered the mountains, changing the terrain to the point of being unrecognizable. Rubble flew into the devil sea, creating enormous waves.

Gui Jiu was the first to fly out of the rubble, saving Fang Liude and the others. After all, Long Chen had ordered him to protect them, so Gui Jiu naturally didn’t dare to let anything happen to them.

After confirming that everyone was fine, Gui Jiu quickly checked on the battlefield. The space at the center of the battlefield was twisting wildly, and the giant cracks were slowly healing. However, he couldn’t see Long Chen and Long Ziwei.

In the distance, the six women on the Heaven Rankings covered their mouths, staring in shock at the core of the battlefield. Such a terrifying exchange was something even they had never witnessed.

Time passed bit by bit. Two blurry figures gradually emerged within the distorted space. As the space settled, a distinct sound reached everyone’s ears.

Their expressions turned shocked as they saw Long Ziwei holding half of his weapon, his face a mask of disbelief. Blood slowly dripped down the handle of his shattered saber.

Long Ziwei’s palm was covered in cracks, blood oozing out of those wounds. However, he seemed oblivious to the pain and simply stared at his broken weapon.

“His Heaven Saint divine weapon was destroyed?” Gui Jiu gulped, his voice quivering.

When Gui Jiu looked at Long Chen, he saw blood-colored dragon scales covering Long Chen and a blood-colored cloak billowing behind him. A sinister-looking black saber was resting on Long Chen’s shoulder as he looked at Long Ziwei silently.

At this moment, Long Chen seemed like an undefeatable god clad in blood armor. He asked, “Is that enough for you now?”

Long Ziwei roared, “No!”

“I know you only used your Doyen power in that last attack. Had you used a divine ability, the power of that attack would have at least doubled. Tell me, what do you need to accept your defeat?” asked Long Chen calmly.

“You have to at least show me one of your attacks!” Long Ziwei demanded.

No sooner had Long Ziwei finished speaking than Long Chen’s saber slashed down. A chilling Saber Qi surged forward, making Long Ziwei’s hair stand on end. He hadn’t expected Long Chen to strike so abruptly, leaving him no time to dodge.

“Damn, this fellow’s sinister!” Long Ziwei roared indignantly, but it was all too late.
