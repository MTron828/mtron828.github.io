Chapter 4135 Blood Devil Race Xue Qingkuang

“Report your name! I, Xue Qingkuang, don’t kill nameless soldiers!” shouted the leader of the Gold Horn Blood Devil race.

“Give it up. You make yourself seem so badass, while I don’t even know how many fellows like you that I’ve slain. I am who I am, surname Long, given name Chen, and all the friends I meet on the path of cultivation call me Boss Long San. Did you memorize it? If you have, then scram. A good dog doesn’t get in the way. If you can’t even resist the pressure of the Great Desolate Winged Devil, what qualifications do you have to block my way?” sneered Long Chen.

“What arrogance, human race! Since you want to die so badly, I’ll kill you right now!”

When Xue Qingkuang raised his hand, the experts beside him retreated, leaving him alone to walk toward Long Chen.

Amongst the hundreds of experts by his side, seven of them possessed auras as vast as the sea. They were all Supreme heavenly geniuses. Furthermore, his aura was on an even higher level.

This indicated that his status in the Blood Devil race was extremely high. As a newly promoted king, from the time of his birth until now, he had never encountered a challenger who could match his prowess. Within the same realm, only a select few could withstand more than ten of his strikes.

Otherwise, there wouldn’t be so many Triple Supremes who were willing to become his subordinates.

With each stride, the earth trembled beneath him, and his aura surged, emanating a savage intensity that radiated outward. His hair then danced in the wind as his violent will locked onto Long Chen.

Long Chen also raised his hand to tell his brothers not to follow him. However, he didn’t unleash any aura and seemed to be taking a casual stroll toward Xue Qingkuang.

Under the pressure of the Great Desolate Winged Devil, Long Chen’s sacred dragon might automatically blocked a portion of it, resulting in him feeling very relaxed in this place compared to others.

BOOM!

Suddenly, Xue Qingkuang accelerated and shot toward Long Chen like a bolt of lightning. He then unleashed a punch.

This was a simple attack, but it made countless people cry out in shock. The experts within this region, in particular, were shocked.

Even while facing this terrifying pressure, he was capable of unleashing such terrifying speed. He was incredibly powerful. If it weren’t for the pressure, no one would be capable of touching him.

In response to his attack, Long Chen’s hand turned into a claw as golden scales covered it. He then slammed his claw down on him.

BOOM!

The impact spread qi waves in all directions, slamming into Guo Ran and his companions with tremendous force. They struggled to maintain their ground as their feet clawed into the earth, but the sheer power of the impact forced them back a hundred miles.

Long Chen easily blocked Xue Qingkuang’s attack with his right hand, and his left hand swung toward his opponent’s face. However, to his surprise, his surefire blow actually missed.

Xue Qingkuang leaned back and sent a kick at Long Chen’s abdomen when Long Chen’s slap almost connected. In other words, their reaction speed was almost identical.

Due to this, Long Chen’s slap veered off course, and Xue Qingkuang’s kick didn’t hit its target, leaving both of them in a state of surprise. After all, Long Chen’s slap was usually impossible to avoid.

Xue Qingkuang was taken aback as well. His attack speed was unmatched within the Blood Devil race, so even in the midst of the intense pressure within this place, his attack should have landed.

After a moment of surprise, Xue Qingkuang once more attacked, fighting Long Chen at close range.

“What speed!”

Guo Ran and the others jumped in shock. Under such terrifying pressure, it felt as though a star was pressing down on them, so simply moving was already very difficult for them.

However, Xue Qingkuang was capable of such rapid movements under the same pressure. It was absolutely astonishing.

Long Chen blocked the barrage of attacks with his own fists. This led to the creation of numerous afterimages, making it nearly impossible for anyone to discern their actual positions amidst the blur of motion.

“His attack speed is on par with the dark domain lord’s!” Xia Chen was shocked. Other than the dark domain lord, it was his first time seeing someone with such rapid attacks.

“If it weren’t for this place, his speed would be several times greater. There would be no way to react to it.” Xu Changchuan was solemn. If he were to encounter such an expert in the Sage King Convention, it would spell trouble for him.

Long Chen and Xue Qingkuang continued to fight at close range, competing entirely with the speed of their attacks and their reaction speed. After all, there was no time to unleash any big moves. However, this was still an extremely dangerous fight where life and death could be determined at any moment.

BOOM!

Suddenly, the afterimages in the air vanished as Long Chen and Xue Qingkuang both retreated, staring at each other coldly.

“So you’re actually not affected by the pressure here. If it weren’t for that, you’d have died at my hands,” sneered Xue Qingkuang.

“Will you die if you don’t talk big all the time? Your speed truly is fast, the fastest of everyone I’ve ever seen. However, if you think that you can kill me with just this, you are wrong. Go and train for a few more years!” said Long Chen lightly.

Xue Qingkuang’s speed was on par with the dark domain lord’s, but Long Chen could tell that the pressure of this place was definitely affecting him. He was unable to pose any threat to Long Chen.

In truth, Long Chen was just testing the fighting style of the Blood Devil race. After all, the devil races were all his enemies. Understanding them more was not a bad thing.

Through this test, he knew that the pressure here affected everyone immensely. Only he seemed to be mostly unaffected.

That made him feel particularly fearless. If Xu Jianxiong hadn’t warned him about not exposing his trump cards, he would have killed this arrogant fellow and his people.

Feeling enraged by Long Chen’s words, Xue Qingkuang formed hand seals, and three-colored divine radiance appeared behind him, gradually condensing into a giant figure. He was summoning his manifestation.ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

Seeing this scene, countless people were shocked. He was already so terrifying before summoning his manifestation. Just how powerful would he be with it?

However, to everyone’s surprise, the void rumbled and quaked, and his manifestation actually stopped manifesting. It seemed that some force was preventing him from summoning it, causing Xue Qingkuang’s expression to grow even uglier.

“Don’t mess around. Due to the pressure of the Great Desolate Winged Devil, your manifestation cannot be summoned. You currently aren’t a match for me. If you keep acting like this, I definitely won’t be able to stop myself from killing you,” said Long Chen indifferently.

“You…!” Xue Qingkuang was incensed, but Long Chen was correct. Even though he was part of the devil race just like the Great Desolate Winged Devil, he was still under its pressure. In fact, this pressure was even stronger on him, so he couldn’t unleash his full potential.

“Just scram. I can’t be bothered to kill you. Go back and tell your devil race that when you encounter Boss Long San, leave as quickly as possible. Boss Long San isn’t someone that you can provoke.”

After saying that, Long Chen walked right past Xue Qingkuang, continuing toward the Great Desolate Winged Devil’s corpse.

Xue Qingkuang and the other experts of the Blood Devil race were brimming with anger, but no one dared to block Long Chen. They just watched as he walked closer to the corpse.

BOOM!

When Long Chen was no more than thirty miles away from the corpse, heaven and earth shuddered. Countless people were shocked to see the corpse actually quiver, shaking everyone within and outside this domain.
