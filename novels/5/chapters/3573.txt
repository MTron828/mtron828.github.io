Chapter 3562

Seeing that Long Chen was brought away, Yu Qingxuan felt empty inside for some reason. Not being able to see him made her feel like she had lost her soul.

Yu Qingxuan looked at Dongfang Zichu. “Master… I…”

“You want to look after Long Chen?” Dongfang Zichu smiled, seemingly seeing through Yu Qingxuan’s thoughts.

Yu Qingxuan blushed slightly. Long Chen had risked his life to save her several times. When she was seized by the master of the Raging Flame Heavenly Palace, he was even willing to turn into a devil. How could she not be moved?

Yu Qingxuan felt uneasy seeing him leave. She needed to be the one to look after him, and she would only feel a bit better once she saw him wake up.

In truth, deep within her heart, she also wanted to stay with Long Chen forever. Just in these few days with him, she felt that the days with him were very warm.

“Foolish child, if both of your emotions are for eternity, why bother about dawn to dusk? The cultivation path is a long one. Everyone follows different paths to the same place, and those who can stand at the peak of the world do not care about this little bit of time. If you are unable to stand at that height, you can only be mercilessly crushed by others. If you cannot even be sure about lasting until dusk, how can you say that you wish to be together with him from dawn to dusk every day? It was master’s carelessness this time. I didn’t expect Yan Xu’s descendant to set his sights on you. You must immediately go into seclusion to quickly awaken your Rainbow Flame manifestation. Once you do, the Yan Xu Flame will no longer be able to suppress you so badly. Even if you can’t beat them, you can get away. It was truly dangerous this time. Master has let you down,” sighed Dongfang Zichu.

“Master, it was disciple’s lack of ability that has lost you your face,” said Yu Qingxuan hastily when she saw her master blaming himself.

“Let’s go. Let’s not talk about these things. Next time, if you have the chance, help your master properly thank that junior brother,” said Dongfang Zichu.

After saying that, he left with Yu Qingxuan. Yu Qingxuan was still unwilling to leave without Long Chen, but she still followed her master away.

Long Chen left and Yu Qingxuan also left. However, the land was left riddled with destruction. The crust of the earth was torn through, and the sky was full of holes. Moreover, black flames still burned like sinister eyes looking upon the world. Just looking at them made people quiver.

Quite a few experts were running toward the battlefield, searching for the fragments of divine items. In that battle, quite a few World Domain divine items had been broken. Even so, their fragments were very precious materials. Every bit that they found was quite a great profit.

However, the majority of these experts were second-rate. True experts looked down on such things.

Once a World Domain divine item was broken, its divine nature would vanish. If its materials were reused, at best they would be able to forge a King item. To those experts with solid foundations, that was trash.

However, there were also powerful heavenly geniuses entering the battlefield now. They weren’t picking through the trash but were sensing the terrifying remnant pressures.

Feng Xiang also walked into the battlefield, but he didn’t dare to walk to the core. The remnant wills there could crush his soul. Let alone him, even late stage World Kings didn’t dare to go there.

This had truly been a heaven-shaking battle. Just how many people had ever seen such a thing in all their lives? Even looking at the remaining burning flames, people still didn’t quite dare to believe it.

“How do you feel?” Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Feng Xiang’s father stood beside him, overlooking this endless battlefield.

“Thank you, dad. If it hadn’t been for you, I might have vanished from this world just like Zhao Mingxuan, Wu Yang, and the others. Dad, your child knows his sins.” Feng Xiang actually sank to his knees and kowtowed to his father to express his apology.

This life of his had been bestowed upon him by his father. If his father had not stripped him of his position as the son of the city lord, he would definitely have been together with Zhao Mingxuan, Wu Yang, and the others. He would have joined forces with them to attack Long Chen.

However, he had seen Long Chen’s power now. For Long Chen, killing him was no different than swatting an ant.

The most frightening thing was that if he had really joined the attack against Long Chen, then Long Chen wouldn’t have shown mercy in that clash with Yan Hong. Then it wouldn’t just be him dead. It would be everyone in the Blazing Dragon Prefecture, including his family and the commoners in the city.

If his father hadn’t expelled him from the family and made him cool his head, perhaps he wouldn’t have saved Yu Qingxuan at that critical moment. By saving Yu Qingxuan, he had saved himself and his family.

Thinking about all this, Feng Xiang was ashamed of himself. Only now did he understand just how bitterly his father had worked for him. His father had long since seen through all this. It was his own stubbornness that had clouded his eyes and almost gotten him killed, implicating everyone else as well. He had no face left and had the urge to find a hole to bury himself in.

“Good child. Your father is gratified that you can understand. As a cultivator, due to possessing great martial power, people often end up having cloudy eyes that are blind to what’s important. They forget respect and gratitude. They think that with power, that by relying on a powerful backer, they can be completely unrestrained, not caring about any law or morality. Little do they know that there is always someone stronger, heaven beyond the heavens,” said Feng Xiang’s father while lifting up his son.

“Child was foolish. I’m ashamed that I didn’t understand your intentions earlier,” said Feng Xiang.

Feng Xiang’s father shook his head. “It was thanks to my close friend in the Wine God Palace that I could comprehend that Long Chen was not an existence we could offend. In truth, your father also didn’t expect this. Long Chen was far more terrifying than I anticipated. Fortunately, you didn’t disappoint me. You saved the Dragon Blaze Prefecture.”

Just thinking about it now, Feng Xiang’s father felt a burst of fear. The Yan Xu Flame was capable of breaking the formation and laws. If it hadn’t been for Long Chen, he would be the only survivor in the city.

Although he had also felt that Long Chen was extraordinary and knew that the High Firmament Academy would not promote just any random youngster to the position of dean, he was still stunned by Long Chen’s power.

In truth, it was all thanks to that expert from the Wine God Palace. If he hadn’t given some pointers to Feng Xiang’s father as well as Feng Xiang, perhaps the Dragon Blaze Prefecture City would be gone.

“Long Chen didn’t die. Some people are probably feeling sour about it.” Feng Xiang looked into the distance and shook his head.

His father followed his gaze. As expected, he saw a group of people discussing something darkly.

Those people were experts from the Soaring Dragon Company. There were actually hundreds of them, and they were all mid and late stage World Kings.

These people had been hiding in the dark the entire time, ready to take action at any opportune moment. However, they were very fortunate to not have made their move. That was what had saved their lives.

Even so, Long Chen and the Soaring Dragon Company were already mortal enemies. Once Long Chen’s injuries healed, it was unknown what he would do to settle their debts.

This battle had shown Long Chen’s power to everyone. For a few late stage World Kings to look for Long Chen was no different from sending themselves to their deaths.

If it was a larger group of late stage World Kings, then even if Long Chen couldn’t beat them, relying on his lightning movement art, he could still flee. With his speed, no one could catch up to him.

Having offended such a terrifying existence with limitless potential, anyone would feel a headache. For the Soaring Dragon Company to have such a figure gazing at them, they would never have a peaceful night again.

…

BOOM!

Within a world of endless flames, millions of flame currents flowed. A black-haired man that looked identical to Yan Hong stood atop the raging currents. He then spread his arms and roared.

“Long Chen, just you wait!”
