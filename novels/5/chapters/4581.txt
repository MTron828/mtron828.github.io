Chapter 4570 Second?

As Long Chen started to get ahead of the pack, the other peak experts also went all-out. After all, this was the final moment.

Once they were out of this channel, they would be in the Fantasy Spirit World. According to legend, the first to enter would be transported to lands teeming with treasures, where riches overflowed to the point that one could merely reach out and have treasures fall into their grasp.

The mysterious expert controlling the bone horse had disappeared long ago. People found it difficult to believe that he could navigate through this final trial on his own.

However, they couldn’t be sure. Who could guarantee that the mysterious expert didn’t have any special means like before? Seeing that there wasn’t much time left, rather than continuing to borrow everyone’s power to conserve energy, they then went all-out.

With these powerful experts going all-out, they revealed their sharpness, sending those Skinners flying, painting the surroundings with flesh and blood.

However, Long Chen’s side wasn’t so bloody. With the karmic hell flames around him, those Skinners all fled as far as they could.

Due to not having anyone blocking him, even as thousands of factions rushed with all their power, Long Chen still managed to get past them.

Sometimes, someone would try to take advantage of him, starting to draw close to stick behind him.

“World Extermination Flame Lotus!”

Within the karmic hell flames, a graceful figure elegantly waved her hand, conjuring a flame lotus that swiftly shot toward the approaching experts.

The flame lotus exploded upon impact, engulfing them in flames. However, those in this group were all formidable figures, and while they emerged from the explosion covered in soot, they remained unscathed by the blast.

“Damn mixed beast race, you’re courting death!” those experts cursed furiously, and their leader directly attacked Long Chen and the others.

“You’re right, you’re courting death!”

Huo Linger got angry with these people. Seeing that they actually ignored her warning, she started to form hand seals.

One after another, flame lotuses soared through the air, each no larger than a palm. Despite their small size, their sheer numbers blotted out the sky, creating an overwhelming barrage. Tens of thousands of flame lotuses hurtled toward the approaching experts with relentless precision.

“Dodge!”

Their leader was startled and hastily brandished his divine weapon. However, those flame lotuses were like naughty fish, slipping right past him to enter their midst.

Those flame lotuses exploded one by one within their ranks, leaving giant holes in the void.

The group of hundreds of thousands of experts was decimated, reduced to a mere tenth of their original numbers. Those who were unable to evade the onslaught were charred black and left in a wretched state, while others were incinerated on the spot.

It had to be known that Huo Linger was constantly absorbing the Moon Flames and Sun Flames in the primal chaos space, so she was full of energy.

While she might not match Lei Linger in terms of quality, she surpassed her in quantity. This time, she unleashed her power through sheer quantity, causing tens of thousands of flame lotuses to detonate simultaneously.

The concentrated explosions unleashed by the flame lotuses were equivalent to facing tens of thousands of attacks simultaneously, rendering these elite experts unable to withstand the onslaught.

After this round of attacks, ninety percent of them were dead. The few survivors were undeniably powerful, but even they bore terrible wounds.

Their leader was left bewildered. He had not anticipated that what seemed like a rational decision would result in the near decimation of his entire army.

“Just you wait!” he roared furiously. After that, he led the survivors back to the rear, as they had lost the ability to charge out alone. If they were to force it, they could be completely wiped out.

At this time, the area ahead of them suddenly changed. Behind those Skinners was a line of massive figures.

They looked like gigantic statues, towering over thirty meters tall and covered in chains. Black qi swirled around them, as they emanated a cruel and tyrannical aura.

BOOM!

One of those giant statues clashed with a peak expert, resulting in both parties being blown back. A ripple of impact radiated through the battlefield, affecting even the mixed beast race's experts nearby. It felt as though a sharp blade had swept past them.

“What is that?!” asked Feng You, stunned. After all, the person fighting that statue didn’t seem much weaker than herself but had only managed to draw against that statue.

“They’re Loathers from Purgatory,” replied Long Chen. At the same time, the face of a woman appeared in his mind. She was Xie Qianqian.

Back then, the two of them had entered Purgatory and encountered these existences. Known as Loathers, they hated heaven and earth for not having a handle.

The meaning was that if heaven and earth had a handle, the Loathers could wield them as weapons. That was the arrogant meaning behind their name, and Long Chen only recalled this saying now.

These Loathers were incredibly terrifying, far exceeding the ones Long Chen had encountered back then. However, these Loathers were also afraid of the karmic hell flames and didn’t dare to get close to him. Hence, he continued to advance easily, while the other experts were held back by the Loathers’ menacing presence.

“Long Chen, take a look. There’s a mass of Loather corpses on the ground!” pointed out Feng You.

Long Chen also noticed them. The path ahead was littered with shattered fragments, indicating that someone had damaged some of the statue-like Loathers. It was evident that someone had forcibly broken through their ranks with sheer brute force.

“It was done by that fellow,” Long Chen murmured, his heart shaking. Even this mysterious person had also started to go all-out.

At this moment, the space in the distance quivered, and countless statues flew through the air.

“We should hurry.” Long Chen knew that everyone was finally going all-out. While these Loathers might be strong, there was no way the Loathers could stop all of the experts. At most, they would stall them a bit.

Taking advantage of the Loathers not attacking them, Long Chen led the mixed beast race forward. On the way, he saw quite a few broken corpses of Loathers, a sign that someone had used the most direct violent way to crush them. The mysterious fellow was really powerful.

“I see him!”

As the number of Loathers in the vicinity started to diminish, Long Chen spotted a natural gate ahead. There, the white bone horse and bronze chariot stood paused, as if waiting for him.

“Quick!”

Long Chen increased his speed, rushing for that gate. Just as Long Chen approached, a sneer came from inside the chariot.

“You’re too late. Ignorant fool, I’ll take your life inside.”

The horse and chariot both entered the gate, vanishing just like that. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Fuck!” Long Chen cursed under his breath. They had narrowly missed this chance. Just as he was about to charge through the gate, an elder appeared in the space where the white bone horse and bronze chariot had been moments ago.

“Congratulations everyone. You are the second batch to arrive at the Fantasy Spirit World. Answer my question, and you may enter,” stated the elder calmly.

Upon seeing this elder, everyone, including Long Chen, was taken aback.
