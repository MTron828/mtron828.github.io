Chapter 2598 Chosen by the Heavens

“Big brother Zi Yang, as my brother, you wouldn’t be conning me, right? I really am not made for that kind of stuff.”

Long Chen shook his head. What kind of joke was that? How could someone place such a huge responsibility on him?

Sovereign Zi Yang smiled, yet it also didn’t seem to be a smile. “To tell the truth, I was originally worried about the fate of the Martial Heaven Continent, but now that I’ve seen you, I suddenly feel like I was worrying for nothing. You are different from all of us. Perhaps that is why you are the crux upon which the world changes, the gamebreaker. Just from your black robes and how your back faced me, I understood instantly just how marvelous the Heavenly Daos are.”

“Big brother Zi Yang, I really am not such a person. Do you know? Sovereign Yun Shang has a son that has awoken. I’m planning on fully supporting him-”

“Sovereign Yun Shang had a son?!” exclaimed Zi Yang.

“Yes. I received his help, which allowed me to pass through the tribulation in the Star Field Divine World. He is a truly marvelous genius. No one can resist him,” said Long Chen.

Sovereign Zi Yang was lost in thought for a while before sighing. “As expected of the first generation. None of us can match him.”

Long Chen was confused. What was so amazing about having descendants? Long Chen didn’t know what to say.

Sovereign Zi Yang explained, “Sovereign Yun Shang was the head of the five Sovereigns. His power is something we all respect, and you will come to know just how amazing he was. However, even if Sovereign Yun Shang left behind a son, you are still the gamebreaker. You are the only one who can break this plot of sure death.”

Seeing that Long Chen was about to argue once more, Sovereign Zi Yang waved his hand. ”You don’t need to feel any pressure. Everything will come naturally. I do not have that much time to argue such senseless things. If you have more questions, ask while you have time.”

Long Chen’s heart shook. After that, he thought about it and asked, “What do you think about the divine families?”

“I have no opinion worth sharing,” said Sovereign Zi Yang indifferently.

Long Chen stared at him blankly. What was that supposed to mean?

“If the Martial Heaven Continent is to survive the upcoming dark era, what is the most important aspect?” asked Long Chen.

“You.”

“Fine.” Long Chen rolled his eyes. He might as well not have asked. Suddenly, he asked, “Sovereign Zi Yang, what is Pill Valley’s origin?”

“You should ask yourself. You have deep karma with Pill Valley. The Martial Heaven Continent is just a start. As for…” Sovereign Zi Yang suddenly fell silent. Seemingly calculating something, he shook his head in the end and didn’t continue.

“I wasn’t able to obtain any valuable information. Big brother Zi Yang, you’re a Sovereign. Even you don’t dare to say these things?” asked Long Chen.

“I’m a dead person. If I speak, it won’t affect me. But it will bring calamity upon you,” said Sovereign Zi Yang.

“You also…” Long Chen found this difficult to accept even though he was prepared. Even Sovereign Zi Yang was dead? If the Martial Heaven Continent were to learn of this, who knew whether people would fall into despair?

The legends said that the Sovereigns had vanished because they were secretly protecting this world. When the world was in danger once more, the Sovereigns would appear to save it again.

If news of their death shattered that belief, then would the Martial Heaven Continent’s experts collapse before the invaders even attacked?

The Sovereigns were the faith of the entire Martial Heaven Continent. When that faith collapsed, it would leave a fatal blow.

Now, even Long Chen felt a profound sense of loss. If the five Sovereigns were still present, perhaps they really would be able to fight off the powerful enemies. But this hope was extinguished.

“Long Chen, don’t look down on yourself. The Martial Heaven Continent picked you to be the gamebreaker, and the five of us existed to build a foundation for you. Trust in yourself. You definitely have that ability. We were both chosen by the heavens, and they would not choose poorly. The Martial Heaven Continent has entrusted its fate to you. Just as you previously told me, no one else would be able to do better than you in your position,” comforted Sovereign Zi Yang.

“How come I’ve never felt like the heavens chose me? If anything, they’re always trying to kill me. In my last tribulation, even big brother Mo Li appeared at the end. If he didn’t cheat and let me pass, I’d have died to that heavenly tribulation.” Long Chen bitterly smiled. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

“You were chosen by the heavens. There is no doubt about this. However, the reason the Heavenly Daos are targeting is because the current Heavenly Daos are no longer the old Heavenly Daos. The heavens are no longer the old heavens, but the earth is still the old earth. The laws of the Heavenly Daos have changed. Don’t take it to heart. Don’t misjudge the world to be targeting you just because of your heavenly tribulation. What is targeting you is something that cannot be spoken with words,” said Sovereign Zi Yang.

Long Chen’s heart shook. “Then you mean that this world-”

Sovereign Zi Yang interrupted, “Don’t say such things out loud. It will be sensed by the Heavenly Daos, breeding more variables that will manifest as further tribulations for you. It does more harm than good. I’ve told you all I can tell you. Is there anything else you need help with? I still have a trace of power left. I can seal it inside your body, and when you encounter an enemy that you cannot beat, it can save your life.”

Hearing this, Long Chen felt a rush of excitement. If this power was sealed in his body, he would have an unmatched protective talisman. Who knew what he could do with that?

However, he then suddenly thought of something. “How many of the Martial Heaven Continent’s experts were turned into resentful spirits inside Resentful Death City?”

“Some warriors did not have time to extinguish their Yuan Spirits before dying, and their Yuan Spirits tried to protect them, entering a state of quasi death. Normally, this state would indicate death, and the remnant will is only able to weakly pass on some information to their descendants. However, inside Resentful Death City, the aura of the Death Spirit World will cause the Yuan Spirit to undergo a transformation into a death spirit. At that time, many experts sensed this and extinguished their own lives in time, dying completely. However, some fought to the death, wanting to kill as many enemies as possible, resulting in them not extinguishing the flames of their soul in time and becoming resentful spirits. There should be around fifteen million resentful death spirits of the human race within Resentful Death City. They were all brave warriors who followed me into battle,” said Sovereign Zi Yang sadly.

“Then did the corpses left behind in the battle of gods and devils also become resentful spirits?” asked Long Chen.

“No. At the time that they died, Resentful Death City had yet to become linked to the Death Spirit World. Their corpses were buried in the ground, but their leftover resentment is used by the Corrupt path to control the resentful spirits,” said Sovereign Zi Yang.

“Then is the Corrupt path in collusion with the Death Spirit World? Why did the Sovereigns not wipe them out earlier?” asked Long Chen.

Sovereign Zi Yang shook his head, not directly replying. “Why did you ask how many resentful spirits were from the Martial Heaven Continent?”

Seeing that Sovereign Zi Yang refused to answer, Long Chen knew that he had once more touched upon a big secret, so he gave up on pressing more information out of Sovereign Zi Yang. “If you have the ability, I hope to wipe out those resentful spirits so that they can rest in peace. For the Corrupt path to control the heroes of the Martial Heaven Continent is the greatest insult to them. Furthermore, Ye Ming is very crafty. When the battle starts, he will definitely use them as his trump cards. At that time, how will the Martial Heaven Continent’s experts fight their ancestors that have been turned into resentful spirits? If they don’t attack, they’ll be killed. But if they do attack, they will be taking on the name of murderers of their ancestors. That will affect the continent’s morale,” said Long Chen.

“This remnant power that I have would be wasted on them. Think it through,” said Sovereign Zi Yang. He only had a little bit of power that could be used once. It was extremely precious.

“There’s no need to think about it. Hesitating isn’t my style. If I want to do something, I do it. I don’t want the heroes of the Martial Heaven Continent to suffer any further insult. As for my safety, well, if I couldn’t protect my own life myself, how am I supposed to protect those that I care about?” said Long Chen.

Sovereign Zi Yang smiled. “Alright, as expected of the gamebreaker. Although I don’t completely approve, I like this character. I respect your choice.”

After that, the space around them shook, and Long Chen appeared in the void with Sovereign Zi Yang. Beneath them was an ancient black city.

This was Immortal Ascension City, as well as Resentful Death City. Standing in the void above it, Long Chen could sense just how vast and beautiful it was.

Even from their position, they couldn’t see the end of the city. At this moment, the resentful spirits shut their mouths when they saw Sovereign Zi Yang. They began to tremble.

“Big brother Zi Yang, if there is a chance, I would like to bring their weapons back with me to return them to their descendants,” said Long Chen.

Sovereign Zi Yang nodded. With a single step, the two of them teleported from the void to inside the city.

Long Chen was startled. Sovereign Zi Yang’s teleportation hadn’t unleashed the slightest spatial fluctuation. If the Sovereign wanted to kill someone, they could do it in an instant before their target could sense them.

A black barrier appeared once they entered the inner city, blocking the two of them. Through it, Long Chen could see countless resentful spirits prostrating themselves toward the central altar. Just as Mo Nian had said, the inner coffins of the Corrupt God Cemetery were on the altar.

At the very center of the altar was Ye Ming staring at Long Chen in shock. Or more accurately, he was staring at Sovereign Zi Yang.

“Ye Ming, didn’t you want to fight me? Come, I’ll satisfy that desire of yours. I’ll beat so much crap out of you that it fills the city.” Long Chen rolled up his sleeves, looking at him arrogantly.
