Chapter 3217 Fury Explodes

Long Chen’s heart pounded. He didn’t know whether or not Luo Zichuan was trying to swindle information out of him.

“I don’t know what senior is talking about.”

Luo Zichuan’s violet eyes glowed. He shook his head. “As expected, once the blood of outsiders stains it, even my Violet Blood race’s pride is lost. You really disappoint me. Although it doesn’t matter whether you make me happy or disappoint me, you won’t be able to escape your death in either case. However, for you to be such a coward, it’s really disgusting. It proves that my decision is correct.”

Long Chen raged, “What are you talking about?!”

Luo Zichuan’s words provoked Long Chen’s fury. If it weren’t for his mother, would he have to suffer such a grievance?

For his mother, he could only endure. But now he felt his dignity being trampled on, and he couldn’t control his anger.

In the face of Long Chen’s anger, Luo Zichuan coldly said, “When Changwu went to see you, he brought back a photographic jade of you, and I instantly recognized you. That stubborn gaze is practically identical to your mother’s. Everything you are doing is just in search of your mother. You actually ascended to the immortal world? You should have continued to endure until you became an Immortal King. Perhaps by running rampant in other regions, you could see enough to find your mother. Regretfully, youngsters really are youngsters. They like to walk shortcuts and take risks, without realizing just how devastating the consequences of failure are. I, Luo Zichuan, have killed countless people in my lifetime, and now I actually have to kill my own grandson. Just thinking about it, don’t you think it’s ironic?”

Long Chen was shaken. So Luo Zichuan had long since seen through his identity. Long Chen had actually thought himself smart by coming here to see if he could dredge up something about his mother, but he was too naive.

“If you know that I’m your grandson, why do you want to kill me? Why did you imprison my mother? Are you even human?!” Upon realizing this, Long Chen’s eyes reddened and he roared with fury.

Thinking of how his mother was once imprisoned in that ice land, Long Chen felt like a blade was stabbing him.

“She walked the wrong path. Naturally, she must take responsibility for her own failures,” said Luo Zichuan coldly.

“Bullshit! Is choosing your own lover something wrong?!”

Luo Zichuan was still icily calm in front of Long Chen’s anger. He indifferently said, “She is from the bloodline of the Luo family, and she possessed the only potential to awaken the immemorial bloodline. Then her child would definitely inherit the ancestral bloodline of the Violet Blood race. That’s why she had to marry within the family, for the resurgence of the Violet Blood race, to pass on this lost inheritance.”

“What dogshit logic is that? You think my mother is some tool for breeding? Some bargaining chip for the resurgence of some lost race? What dogshit pride, you are nothing more than a sanctimonious hypocrite!” cursed Long Chen. He was mad with rage. How could such a father exist in this world?

Luo Zichuan coldly said, “Every person has their own responsibility within this world. Your mother was the only hope of the Violet Blood race rising, and she knew what she was carrying on her shoulders. However, her willfulness has thrown millions of lives of the family in peril. Do you know that the peace of the immortal world is about to shatter? Do you know that the price of her actions is countless lives of the Luo family? Do you know that she possesses a sacred body that is restricted by the Heavenly Daos? She can only have one child in this life. In other words, if she wants a second child, you must die. So I can only kill you. This is for the Luo family. It doesn’t matter if you hate me or curse me. Even if I have to carry the name of infamy for eternity, I will still kill you.”

“Immortal King Zichuan? Might as well be dogshit Zichuan. You lack the ability, so you pass the burden onto your own child. Although I am nothing more than a newcomer in the immortal world, I know that I will carry my own burdens. If I can’t, I won’t force others to carry them instead. Life and death are up to the heavens. So sacrificing others for your own gain is the style of your Luo family? I spit on you! If you want to kill me, then come! Let’s see just how you kill me today! My creed in life is to look down on death, to fight to the death against anyone who tries to suppress me. Come. I won’t have mercy on you just because you’re my grandfather!” Long Chen roared and his black saber appeared in his hand. He pointed it at Luo Zichuan.

Even if he was facing a World King, even if it was his own grandfather, his will to fight still overflowed. His anger had nowhere else to go, so he could only fight. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

The life and death of the Luo family had nothing to do with him. He only cared about his mother. Giant families like this in the immortal world didn’t have familial emotions to speak of.

Long Chen didn’t have a sense of belonging in this place or anywhere in the immortal world. The people here didn’t have many familial emotions, and what they had was a sense of profit. For profit, they could sacrifice anything. That was the most unacceptable thing for Long Chen.

Luo Zichuan nodded with Long Chen’s saber pointed at him. “Not bad. You do have some of the Luo family’s backbone.”

“Backbone? Are you joking? If the Luo family had any backbone at all, they wouldn’t sacrifice a single girl’s emotions while struggling on death’s door,” sneered Long Chen, spitting on this praise.

Luo Zichuan didn’t defend himself. He stood and descended from the stone stele. After that, he rubbed the stele, lost in memories. He muttered, “I don’t even know how many years it has been since I last fought. Every saber here has its own story. If I directly killed you, you might not admit defeat even in death. Since you’re in the Four Peak realm, I’ll suppress my realm to the Four Peak realm.”

“No need. Otherwise, if I kill you with one blow, I won’t have the face to see my mother,” sneered Long Chen.

Hearing this statement, Luo Zichuan looked at Long Chen oddly. After a long moment, he said, “Are you prepared to die?”

“You’re wrong. As long as I still have a single breath left in me, I won’t admit defeat. Even in front of Enpuda, I didn’t cower. As for you, perhaps I can’t defeat you, but you can’t kill me,” said Long Chen coldly.

The most painful thing for Long Chen was that if it was anyone else, he could fight using his normal style, trading life for life. But he couldn’t do so against Luo Zichuan. If Luo Zichuan died, would his mother forgive him?

Long Chen was hesitating over this matter. He didn’t know what he should do.

Luo Zichuan shook his head. “You’re very arrogant. Unfortunately, your power doesn’t match your arrogance. Do you really think that your current self is unmatched in this realm? I’ll put it bluntly. You are nothing more than a frog at the bottom of a well. You have not seen any true experts yet.”

Luo Zichuan pressed his hand against the stele. With a light sound, a saber popped out of the stele and landed in his hand.

“This blade’s name is Blooddrinker. Blooddrinker was the name of an ancient battle god of the Barbarian race. The weapons of his subordinates were all named Blooddrinker regardless of quality. When that battle god died, his entire branch fought to the death with him. The Blooddrinker sabers were almost all lost. In the Divine Flame realm, I happened to find one. Although its quality is only at the Spirit item level, it has accompanied me throughout the nine prefectures and has slain countless experts. Others called it the Blooddrinker Wild Saber. As for myself, before becoming an Immortal King, they called me Wild Saber Zichuan. Prepare yourself. I’m about to attack.” Looking at this saber, Luo Zichuan seemed to be recollecting his youth. A fire ignited in his eyes.

Long Chen raised his saber. His essence, qi, and spirit were at his peak.

Luo Zichuan gracefully swung his saber. It was like a bolt of lightning descending from the heavens, slashing toward Long Chen.

Long Chen hastily blocked, only for him to be shocked that he was blocking nonsense. As an intense sensation of death enveloped him, he instinctively tilted his head backward.

Blood splashed through the air.
