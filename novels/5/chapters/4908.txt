Chapter 4897 Pre-Emperor Level

This was a vast hall, devoid of anything except eight giant skeletal corpses. Four of them were humanoid but gigantic. Despite their wizened bodies, the bloodline pressure they exuded was absolutely terrifying.

The other four bodies belonged to devil beasts with an odd appearance: serpentine heads and eagle bodies. Although they had been lying on the ground for countless years, the devil qi they exuded was suffocating.

“So, you came here for them?” asked Long Chen, instantly realizing that the devil expert and Blood expert had come from these corpses.

“You only realized now? It’s too late,” sneered the devil expert. “You don’t even know what kind of place this is, but you still barged in. You’ve sent yourself to your death.”

The Blood expert added, “Since you’re about to die, I’ll help you be a ghost that understands how he died. This place is a battlefield from the immemorial era where my Blood race’s experts and the devil race’s experts fell. Although they died, their blood did not vanish, and their soul essence did not disperse. Their wills are eternal. So, we came here to receive the inheritance of our ancestors, but a fool like you has also come. All that awaits you is death and despair.”

Long Chen was baffled. Just where were the treasures that Mo Nian had promised him? He looked more closely, but other than the eight corpses, he didn’t see anything else here.

Long Chen couldn’t help but curse, “It couldn’t be that the treasures he mentioned are just these eight corpses, right? What the fuck am I supposed to do with them? Make some stew?”

“Fool, after being conned by someone, you should just peacefully await your death!” sneered the Blood expert.

“Fuck, does your face not hurt?! I’ll slap you a few more times to wake you up!” retorted Long Chen furiously as he stamped on the ground. The ground was hard like metal, but when his foot stamped on it, a slight crack appeared.

The Blood expert already seethed with anger after being repeatedly slapped in the face—that was his life’s greatest humiliation. Now that Long Chen brought it up, his fury instantly exploded. “Bastard, I’ll rip your corpse into eight pieces today!”

BOOM!

When their divine weapons clashed again, Long Chen simply swayed, while the Blood expert flew back. He wasn’t a match for Long Chen in a head-on clash.

Although the Blood expert was powerful, he was still a level weaker than Huo Qianwu. Furthermore, his divine weapon was also inferior to the Blaze Dragon Bone Whip.

Having exchanged a few blows with Long Chen, he always came out on the losing end. Now, Long Chen was in his peak state, while his confidence was flagging, which started to affect his fight.

“Rip me into eight pieces? Do you think your unskilled techniques are capable of that?” sneered Long Chen. Not giving his opponent a chance to recollect himself, Long Chen spun through the air, his saber hacking at the Blood expert like a wild tempest.

The Blood expert was once more sent flying, blood spraying from his mouth.

Long Chen took three steps, each one leaving countless afterimages. The Blood expert couldn’t discern which was real. Long Chen was simply too fast.

At this moment, the Blood expert had nowhere to run. His back was against one of the corpses. However, just then, he sneered. Seeing Long Chen’s saber coming for him, he suddenly held out his blood-colored ruler with both hands.

Following that, a strange sight occurred. The corpse behind him actually moved, and blood-colored lines flew out of its body, enveloping the Blood expert.

BOOM!

Long Chen’s saber fell. Just as he thought that this attack would leave the Blood expert on the verge of death, Evilmoon was knocked back. The impact left his hand bleeding, and he was forced back over ten steps before he managed to stabilize himself.

Long Chen stared in shock at the Blood expert. The giant corpse was sending blood-colored runes toward the Blood expert. It was no wonder his power had suddenly soared as if he was possessed. His power was completely different from before—this power was the corpse’s.

From a distance, the devil expert sneered at Long Chen, “I told you, this place is hell for you. Even if your power is a bit greater than ours, you still won’t be able to escape your death.”

At this moment, the devil expert was standing on a devil beast’s corpse. Devil qi was slowly entering him from the corpse, and his aura rapidly climbed.

Meanwhile, the Blood expert wiped off the blood from his mouth and smiled sinisterly. “I admit that your power is above mine, but it means nothing. I am receiving my ancestors’ bloodline power and will. Your power isn’t even worth mentioning in front of me!”

“Interesting,” said Long Chen, swinging out his numb hand. He looked at the Blood expert and then the devil expert before setting off toward a giant devil beast.

However, before Long Chen could even get close, a devil rune lit up on its body, knocking him back.

“A barrier?” Long Chen was surprised and then swung his saber at the barrier.

BOOM!

The barrier didn’t break, and Long Chen tumbled back.

“Hahaha, you idiot, who do you think you are? Do you think you can break the protective divine light of Emperors?! You overestimate your own power!” The Blood expert and devil expert laughed at Long Chen’s miserable state.

“Emperors?! Don’t try to con me!” sneered Long Chen.

“No, they aren’t conning you. These lifeforms are truly pre-Emperors,” said the Earth Cauldron.

“What does that mean?” asked Long Chen hastily.

“They are experts who have cultivated nine heaven veins.”

“Nine heaven veins?!” Long Chen’s heart skipped a beat.

Xing Wujiang had cultivated a single heaven vein, but he could already dominate regular Heaven Saints. However, these corpses had cultivated nine? No wonder they still possessed such terrifying power even after being dead for so many years. Long Chen wasn’t even qualified to get close to them.

“I want them!” Long Chen wanted to toss them into the primal chaos space and have the black soil devour them. Once that happened, the primal chaos space’s power would rise once again.

“With your power now, it’s impossible,” replied the Earth Cauldron. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

“In that case, I’ll kill the two of them first,” remarked Long Chen. He then took a deep breath, and the Dragon Blood Extreme Yang Pill appeared in his hand.

Just then, the ground inside this hall started cracking. The central portion suddenly bulged as if something was trying to rise out of the earth. Long Chen, the devil expert, and the Blood expert were all stunned by this scene.
