Chapter 1608 Hating Heaven and Earth For Not Having a Handle

Translator: BornToBe

The pillar was fifty thousand meters wide and had a winding staircase around it. However, it was so tall that it was impossible to see its end. One could see a path going down it as well.

“This is probably the path up and down!” exclaimed Long Chen.

There were several thirty-meter statues around the pillar. They had short legs and thick arms. They were incredibly lifelike, with each vein on their bulging muscles visible.

“It’s very likely. But when we get there, we’ll be instantly noticed. That place is too empty,” said Xie Qianqian worriedly.

Several Skinners were roving around this region. They would definitely notice them.

Long Chen sank into thought and then shook his head. “We’ll have to gamble. When intelligence cannot solve a problem, you can only rely on power.”

Long Chen slowly took out Evilmoon, a sharp light appearing in his eyes. He was like a stalking cheetah in the dark.

“Shouldn’t we prepare more?” asked Xie Qianqian. This was too dangerous. If they didn’t succeed, they wouldn’t get another chance.

“No need. I’ve checked the map, and this place should be the core region. Even if we waited longer, we wouldn’t be able to increase our odds. I also can’t stay too long in this place. But don’t worry, I promise that as long as I manage to survive, you will too.”

Xie Qianqian couldn’t help feeling comfort at the sight of Long Chen’s firm expression. She actually believed he was speaking the truth. His confident appearance inspired confidence in others.

Xie Qianqian nodded and took a deep breath. Just like that, the two of them began rushing toward the giant pillar.

The surrounding Skinners were all startled. They let out strange cries and attacked.

“Don’t worry! Just stay beside me!”

Long Chen’s steps didn’t pause as he pulled Xie Qianqian’s hand. Quick as lightning, he went past the first Skinner, slashing it.

The Skinner instantly exploded. However, the blood mist it had exploded into slowly recondensed into its original form.

“Rumor is that Skinners are the jailors of this level of Purgatory. As long as the Skinner Purgatory isn’t destroyed, they will forever revive,” called out Xie Qianqian.

Two more Skinners came from the sides, as well as the original Skinner that had just reformed. Holding a chain in one hand and a triangular blade in the other, they attacked.

“Hmph, revive forever? What’s so amazing about that?”

Long Chen unleashed a huge saber-image that crushed the three Skinners.

They weren’t particularly powerful, and their bodies were very weak. Their only strong points were their chains and blades.

This time, as soon as he killed them, he waved his hand and sucked their chains and blades into the primal chaos space.

“I’m confiscating your cheat tools!”

After killing them and taking their weapons, Long Chen rushed off with Xie Qianqian.

As for the three Skinners he had slain, once they reformed, they didn’t attack again. Instead, they began to grope around as if they were looking for their lost tools.

“Excellent! Without their chains or blades, they’re crippled!” cried out Xie Qianqian excitedly.

Long Chen smiled faintly and didn’t reply. Based on his experience, things definitely wouldn’t go this simply.

Long Chen killed all the Skinners that blocked his path and quickly took their weapons. However, his fighting caused a disturbance that caused countless Skinners to come from every direction.

They appeared to number in the tens of thousands. Xie Qianqian’s face instantly turned pale as there were so many. If any of their blades or chains stabbed through Long Chen, the two of them would be doomed.

Those weapons carried the laws of this place. Once stabbed, they would become prey that the Skinners would torture for eternity.

“Whirlwind Slash!”

Long Chen suddenly grabbed Xie Qianqian by the waist and leaped into the air.

A black saber-image devoured the surrounding Skinners. The sound of their bodies exploding rang out one by one.

Long Chen was too fast and only had time to take some of their weapons as he rushed off. With just his own saber raining down attacks, he barged his way through them.

Xie Qianqian was feeling more and more hopeful as they got closer to the pillar. Long Chen was much stronger than she had expected.

Just as they were getting close to it, the land shook. The statues around it began to move.

Those statues had manacles on their wrists. As soon as Long Chen approached them, one of them smashed both its fists at him.

The immense power gave Long Chen a suffocating feeling. This was his first time encountering such power. He instinctively dodged.

The statue’s fists smashed into the ground. The entire palace swayed with a rumbling sound. Although the attack missed, the shockwaves sent Long Chen flying.

Fortunately, the Skinners were blown to bits by the shockwaves.

“That’s... a Loather!” cried out Xie Qianqian.

“What are Loathers?” asked Long Chen.

“I don’t know either. The stories just say that Loathers are the warriors of a Giant race. They are incredibly powerful. It’s said that they hate that heaven and earth have no handle. That’s because they’re so powerful that they have no suitable weapons, so they wish they could use heaven and earth as their weapons- ah!”

Xie Qianqian cried out as she flew through the air. That wasn’t from being blown away, but because Long Chen had tossed her.

Xie Qianqian landed on the staircase of the pillar. She was many meters high now, while the Loathers and Skinners were all focused on Long Chen. They completely ignored her.

“Hating heaven and earth for not having a handle? What arrogant words. I’m impressed by that bragging! Let’s see just how strong you really are!”

BOOM!

Long Chen’s saber slashed onto a Loather’s wrist. The Loathers all had chained manacles on their wrists.

Long Chen’s attack didn’t injure it at all. Instead, he himself was blown back. Now his battle intent was truly ignited.

“Divine ring!”

A five-colored divine ring appeared, a five-point star within it. A hallowed aura surged out, even forcing back the air of Purgatory.

“FengFu Star!”

“Alioth Star!”

“Life Fate Star!”

Evilmoon slashed out mercilessly at one of the Loathers. Their attacks clashed, and they were even.

“Enlightenment Palace Star!”

BOOM!

Their stalemate was instantly broken, and the Loather was forced back. However, Long Chen was shocked. These Loathers were truly powerful. They were relying purely on the power of their physical bodies.

Right after he forced back one, another four Loathers immediately charged at him.

“Divine Gate Star!”

A pillar of light soared into the sky, lighting up this world. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

“Split the Heavens 6!”

A huge saber-image swept through all the Loathers, slaying them. After killing them, Long Chen ran for the pillar. That attack had contained his full power and had slain all the surrounding Loathers and Skinners.

However, that was useless. This was Purgatory, while they were the overseers. They would revive over and over again.

Taking advantage of while they had yet to reform, Long Chen sped up the staircase. He quickly caught up to Xie Qianqian and began to pull her along. They two of them rushed up like a wild gale.

“Their power really wasn’t fake.” Long Chen had only managed to settle them by using the Five Star Battle Armor and the sixth form of Split the Heavens. However, while he still had enough energy to unleash this attack one more time, they would just keep reviving.

The Loathers let out a furious roar and began to bound up the staircase. They were like nimble monkeys, and they were even faster than Long Chen.

“Here, get on my back. I’m going to use my full speed.”

Long Chen put Xie Qianqian on his back. Thunderforce circulated around him as he sped up, looking like a bolt of lightning.

Their immense speed caused a powerful tearing force that made Xie Qianqian feel like her body would explode. However, she knew this was a critical moment. She gritted her teeth and endured it.

“Hahaha, we made it!”

Long Chen suddenly laughed as he saw the top. There was black light there. Without hesitation, he charged into it.

When Long Chen vanished into the black light, the Loathers let out a furious roar, but they didn’t dare to follow him there.
