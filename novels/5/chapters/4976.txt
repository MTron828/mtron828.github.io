The first Heavenly Saint, Long Qihua, was an existence whose name shook the entire Long clan. Even beyond the Heavenly Desolation Domain, his name struck like thunder.

Long Qihua was like the Long clan’s golden signboard. He had killed countless experts in his lifetime and had never failed to carry out his mission. Throughout his life, he had created an untold number of legendary stories. Among the Long clan’s disciples, he was viewed as an idol, the one surrounded by the greatest halos of glory.

Perhaps some of the Long clan’s disciples didn’t know the clan leader’s name, but they surely knew the first Heavenly Saint’s name. Now that he appeared, everyone was taken aback, including the wild Long Zaiye.

“Too far?” Long Chen laughed. “Those words sound incredibly ironic coming from your mouth. Is it even possible for me to have gone as far as you have?”

This immense pressure shocked Long Chen. Indeed, Long Qihua was the most formidable expert he had ever encountered. Just looking at him caused a prickling pain in Long Chen’s soul. Long Chen knew that he definitely couldn’t win against Long Qihua.

However, Long Chen remained fearless, even particularly bold. His father had paved the way for him, and he did not believe the Long clan really dared to kill him.

Of course, a brainless fool like Long Zaiye was an exception. However, Long Chen wasn’t afraid of him as he was well aware that Long Zaiye couldn’t do shit to him.

With a cold tone, Long Qihua said, “Under what status have you come here? If you think you are a guest, you need to abide by the rules. If you think you are a disciple of the Long clan, then you need to follow our laws. You cannot continuously challenge the Long clan’s dignity.”

“Well said. This old fogey was continuously ignoring the Long clan’s laws and challenging the Long clan’s dignity. Anyway, did you see me break any of the Long clan’s rules? Or are you selectively enforcing your laws?” responded Long Chen.

Even against the Long clan’s number one Heavenly Saint, Long Chen did not retreat in the slightest. His arrogance and defiance left the disciples and mercenaries present in shock. Long Chen was truly fearless.

Long Qihua might be the number one Heavenly Saint with terrifying power, but his power lay in his fists, not his mouth. He couldn’t compare to Long Chen in this regard. With so many holes in his own words, Long Qihua had no room to retort.

Indeed, Long Zaiye had broken the rules first and was guilty of bullying juniors. Even if Long Ziwei had intentionally killed Long Qingyun, the decision on his punishment would rightfully belong to the disciplinary hall, not Long Zaiye.

In any case, this incident could be easily portrayed as accidental due to its suddenness and swiftness. Long Chen had long since calculated this outcome for Long Ziwei. He knew that if Long Ziwei couldn’t kill Long Qingyun in three moves, Long Ziwei would no longer have any chance. After three moves, even if Long Qingyun suffered severe injury, Long Ziwei would lack the strength to continue the fight. He also couldn’t try to kill Long Qingyun at that moment, or the nature of the incident would change. One could be said to be an accident, but the other would be intentional murder.

As a result, Long Zaiye’s act of trying to kill Long Ziwei was a grave violation of the rules. Even if Long Qihua were a thousand times stronger, he wouldn’t be able to change this reality.

At this moment, Long Qihua’s complexion darkened, and he didn’t respond for a long time. When he did, he completely ignored Long Chen’s point.

“Nonsense. Answer my question! Under what status have you come to the Long clan?”

“Does that have anything to do with you? Do you think you’re the patriarch of the Long clan? Are all matters of the Long clan decided by you? Who are you trying to scare? A child? Do I look scared of you?” mocked Long Chen.

At first, Long Chen had thought the Long clan’s number one Heavenly Saint should be powerful and intelligent. However, unexpectedly, this fellow wasn’t much better than Long Zaiye.

In truth, Long Chen was unaware that Long Qihua had been brooding over not being able to fight Long Zhantian. During their brief encounter, their clash of auras had yielded no decisive advantage before they were stopped by the patriarch.

As a result, a rumor circulated within the Long clan, suggesting that Long Zhantian could be considered equal to Long Qihua, perhaps even capable of surpassing him. This rumor greatly displeased Long Qihua. However, he could still control himself, unlike Long Zaiye. Even if he didn’t like it, he didn’t express it, as that would only show how small-hearted he was.

In reality, Long Qihua’s heart was far from magnanimous. Since that incident, though he never voiced his discontent, he was extremely unhappy with it.

Long Chen’s arrival in the Long clan also irked Long Qihua. The latter simply didn’t say anything about it because he didn’t want others to know that he was resentful of the son because of the father, which would just show his pettiness.

However, with Long Chen having slain their disciples and Heaven Saints, even threatening a former member of the four Heavenly Saints, Long Qihua could no longer stay silent.

Originally, Long Qihua had believed that his presence alone would be enough to intimidate Long Chen. At the very least, he had thought Long Chen wouldn’t dare to continue acting so brazenly.

However, as someone who had seen the world, Long Chen wasn’t intimidated at all. He showed no regard for Long Qihua’s status, refusing to yield even an inch.Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

“Are you not afraid that I will kill you?” A spark of killing intent flashed in Long Qihua’s eyes.

“Senior, kill him!” shouted Long Zaiye.

Just then, Evilmoon pushed in ever so lightly. Its sharp tip easily pierced an inch into Long Zaiye’s scalp and the bone.

Long Zaiye’s expression changed. He had believed his defenses were impenetrable, and had been more concerned about Long Chen’s power threatening his Yuan Spirit through his skull. However, his confidence shattered when Evilmoon effortlessly pierced through his defenses.

Long Qihua’s expression also changed. He had not expected Evilmoon to be so sharp.

Prior to Long Chen’s journey into Heaven Screen Mountain, Evilmoon would have struggled to breach Long Zaiye’s defenses. Yet, having absorbed the blood soul energy of numerous Heaven Saints, Evilmoon had grown exceedingly sharp.

Evilmoon said, “Don’t get emotional. Endure it and don’t kill him! I’m not done refining everything I absorbed before. If you kill him now, I won’t be able to absorb all his energy, and that would be a waste.”

In this tense situation, Evilmoon was actually the most anxious one here. It didn’t want Long Chen to “waste a natural treasure.”

Luckily, Long Chen wasn’t planning on killing Long Zaiye either. He was just scaring this old fart, demonstrating his capability to end his life if necessary.

Looking at Long Qihua, Long Chen said, “In this world, everyone fears death, including me. But I have a principle—I’d rather break than bend. My head can be severed, but not bowed. Don’t try me.”

“What if I want to?” Long Qihua’s expression sank. When his killing intent erupted, a vast pressure enveloped Long Chen.

BOOM!

The martial stage beneath Long Chen’s feet shattered.
