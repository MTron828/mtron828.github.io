Chapter 4503 Good Timing

A terrifying divine weapon filled with Doyen power shot through the air, locking Long Chen with its terrifying aura.

The owner of this blood-colored spear was a long-haired man with overflowing devil qi. His Doyen manifestation was present, and there were five stars vaguely visible inside of it.

Long Chen instantly thought of the stars on the Heavenly Doyen Fruits when he saw the five stars. It seemed that the tiers of Doyens could be seen even through their manifestations.

This meant that the devil expert was on the same level as the Lifehunter expert. Yet, during Long Chen’s confrontation with the Lifehunter expert, the latter’s manifestation lacked these stars. Clearly, this devil expert was a bit stronger than that Lifehunter expert.

“You also want to enter the pathway to the ninth heaven? Keep dreaming. Instead of dying there, you can die at my hands now!” shouted that devil expert as he thrust his spear toward Long Chen.

“Children of the devil race, I don’t even know how many of you that I’ve killed. You think you are qualified to shout in front of me?”

Long Chen sneered, and in front of countless shocked gazes, he extended his hand and effortlessly seized the incoming spear.

Stars flowed on top of his hand, causing his arm to look as if it was made of stars. Simultaneously, his divine ring manifested, and his starry sea radiated a brilliant light. A cascade of starlight then descended, enveloping Long Chen and turning him into the battle god of the starry sky.

Before this, Long Chen wouldn’t have dared to block a Saint weapon with his bare hands, especially when wielded by a five-star Heavenly Doyen.

However, having advanced to the peak of the twelfth Heavenstage of the World King realm and undergone two major transformations, Long Chen had reached such heights that even he was uncertain of the level of his strength.

“Courting death!” roared the devil race’s Doyen in fury, and his Doyen manifestation quivered. The spear in his grasp radiated intense light as his Doyen power erupted like a volcanic explosion.

BOOM!

The spear quivered, and both Long Chen and the devil expert were forcibly pushed backward. Neither could maintain their grip on the weapon. However, Long Chen seemed to have expected this.

Long Chen’s other hand snaked out and grabbed the spear. After that, he thrust it toward the devil expert.

The devil expert seethed with anger. He had barely launched his spear, and now Long Chen snatched it away. What an absolute humiliation. However, he was profoundly aware of how terrifying this spear was. Being not a Saint, he could not fully unleash the power of this Saint weapon, so he had only relied on his soul and Doyen power to control it.

The devil expert recognized that unless he ignited his core energy, he couldn’t harness even a fraction of the spear’s power. However, such an act came at a terrifying cost.

Initially, when he attacked, he didn’t regard Long Chen highly, assuming he could defeat Long Chen in just a few moves. Hence, he naturally wouldn’t ignite his core energy as he had to keep some power in reserve for his enemies in the pathway to the ninth heaven.

In his carelessness, Long Chen snatched his divine weapon. Seeing it being thrust toward him, the devil expert roared.Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

A giant blood-colored shield appeared in his hand, its aura somewhat identical to the blood-colored spear. It seemed that they were a set.

Long Chen snorted, “A shield against a spear. Then let’s see which one is stronger!”

As Long Chen’s seven stars revolved behind him, he forcibly injected his astral energy into the spear.

As a result, the spear rumbled explosively as if resisting Long Chen’s power. But in front of Long Chen’s astral energy, it didn’t have much ability to resist.

Employing the same method as when he used Split the Heavens, Long Chen infused the spear with his entire power. Ignoring its resistance, he forcefully thrust it forward.

In retaliation, the devil expert also set his Doyen stars in motion, and devil qi erupted from his shield. All of his power was concentrated within it.

BOOM!

Before countless shocked onlookers, both the shield and spear crumbled, unleashing a tumultuous explosion and wreaking havoc.

Long Chen grunted and retreated a few steps. His internal organs shook, and he almost spat out blood. The explosion of Saint weapons was absolutely terrifying.

As for the devil expert, blood sprayed from his mouth, and the arm holding his shield was missing. He was clearly at a disadvantage.

These two divine weapons originated from the same source. Hence, when they clashed, they destroyed each other. Unfortunately for him, this set was a priceless treasure of his race, and he was only temporarily given the privilege of holding them because he was entering the pathway to the ninth heaven. After that, he was supposed to return them.

Now that these priceless Saint weapons were no more, the experts of the devil race were incensed.

Just as he hesitated about whether he should order the rest of his people to attack or if he should retreat, a pretty figure emerged behind him, and a violet sword pierced through the back of his head.

It was Lei Linger. She had emerged like a phantom, striking without anyone noticing.

Previously, when Lei Linger launched an attack, the aura of heavenly tribulation would erupt. However, her current control was exceptionally terrifying. She retained her aura perfectly concealed. As a result, when she materialized, she caught the devil expert completely off guard before swiftly dispatching him.

“Kill them all, especially those Doyens!” shouted Long Chen.

Brandishing a seven-color sword, Long Chen shot after the devil experts led by the dead Doyen. They had planned to wipe out the Dragonblood Legion, but their leader’s death came too quickly. He fell almost the instant he confronted Long Chen, which left the remaining devil experts dumbfounded

Wherever Long Chen’s sword fell, the devil experts collapsed rapidly. The Dragonblood Legion also attacked them, picking out those Doyens.

Deprived of their leader, the devil experts were reduced to disarray. Yue Zifeng and the others swiftly cut them down. Disciples from the academy and the Battle God Palace also participated in the onslaught.

However, these devil experts numbered in the millions. As the Dragonblood Legion could not surround them in time, the majority of them managed to escape in the end.

In just this one clash, hundreds of thousands of their elites met their demise, including over ten thousand Heavenly Doyens.

This clash was witnessed by many experts, but they all ignored it. Even other branches of the devil race didn’t come to assist them, prioritizing to rush toward the vortex. For them, entering the vortex was more important than anything else.

“Good timing!” Long Chen and the others didn’t pursue them. After cleaning up the battlefield, Long Chen handed Guo Ran a spatial ring. When the latter checked it, he instantly understood.

The inside of the ring was filled with Heavenly Doyen Fruits. Long Chen was telling Guo Ran to secretly distribute them to the Dragonblood warriors.

This way, all the Dragonblood warriors could immediately consume them after entering the pathway to the ninth heaven. Then, their overall power would once more rise, and since they would be inside the pathway to the ninth heaven, it wouldn’t cause too much of a disturbance.

Guo Ran silently distributed them. By the time he was done, they had gotten right next to the vortex.

The closer they got to it, the more experts appeared around them. Once they got to a certain distance from the vortex, they would instantly vanish, most likely sucked by the spatial energy.

Just as Long Chen and the others were about to enter, Long Chen suddenly sensed something. A flame lotus then shot in front of him, and he shouted to Guo Ran, “The rest of you enter first!”

BOOM!

As the flame lotus exploded, the void collapsed, revealing a translucent figure that shot away. When they saw that figure, their hearts turned cold.
