Chapter 3845 Long Chen’s New Technique

The light sphere contracted, and heaven and earth quivered. This power made people’s hearts clench. It was an attack with apocalyptic power.

Guo Ran and the others instantly tensed. They knew that this move had to be one of Long Aotian’s killer blows.

However, unexpectedly, just as his sphere of light contracted, Long Chen simply pointed at the Vermilion Bird totem.

Endless flames gushed out of the Vermilion Bird totem. The five energies inside the sphere were originally perfectly balanced, but with Long Chen’s injection of energy, the sphere instantly lost any semblance of balance.

BOOM!

Endless runes flew about. That terrifying sphere of light was broken with a single finger from Long Chen.

All the experts present were shocked. Such a terrifying technique had been broken with a wave of Long Chen’s hand?

Seeing Mo Nian and the others’ uncomprehending expressions, Yue Xiaoqian explained, “The five elemental energies restrain and support each other. The reason Long Aotian can use all five elemental energies at once is because he is using the Dao of the Five Elements. As for Long Chen, he possesses flame energy, and just by inserting the slightest bit of it into the Vermilion Bird totem, the Vermilion Bird totem’s energy overwhelmed the Azure Dragon’s wood energy. With the balance of the five elements broken, this technique naturally crumbled on itself.”

Only then did Mo Nian and the others understand. So it was such a simple trick. But without Yue Xiaoqian’s explanation, they wouldn’t be able to imagine how Long Chen could destroy such a killer move with a point of his finger.

Long Aotian didn’t seem surprised that his technique was broken. It was as if it was all within his expectations. He then waved his hand, and the five totems flew toward him, branding themselves on his forehead, hands, and feet.

The Qilin was on his forehead, the Vermilion Bird on his left hand, the White Tiger on his right hand, the Azure Dragon on his left foot, and the Black Tortoise on his right foot. The power of the five elemental totems was directly merged with his body.

When that happened, heaven and earth quivered as if he had become the master of the world, an undefeatable existence that controlled all laws. His aura completely changed, becoming even more domineering and even more oppressive.

“Long Chen, do you think that I don’t know you have flame energy? Do you think breaking my Five Spirit Bind is something to be proud of?! You’re too naive! Long Chen, I won’t let you die so easily. I’ll show you just how terrifying your seven-color Supreme Blood is. I’ll make you die feeling endless unwillingness and helplessness. I will return all the pain that you gave me multiplied by a thousand!” Long Aotian smiled sinisterly, his gaze sharp. “On the Martial Heaven Continent, you said that your physical body was the strongest. Today, I’ll defeat you in your strongest area. What I have was originally yours, but you can only watch as everything is taken from you! You are powerless to resist! You can only die suffering!”

Long Aotian suddenly unleashed a simple punch. The next moment, a golden fist-image crashed down like a giant mountain.

This punch came out without any hand seals and without accumulating any energy. However, all the metal energy of the world still followed the punch. Long Aotian was able to unleash such a powerful attack without any preparation.

When the mountain-like golden fist crashed down, Long Chen’s heart shook. The pressure behind this fist made it impossible for him to breathe.

However, this fist didn’t strike Long Chen. Instead, it flew by him, smashing into the ground below.

This fist directly struck the thirty-six coffins. The terrifying power caused the ground to crumble and the earth to turn into nothingness.Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

Even so, this terrifying fist was unable to damage those coffins. After losing the support of the ground, they simply floated in the air.

This unstoppable fist that destroyed heaven and earth was unable to damage those coffins. At the same time as people were stunned by Long Aotian’s power, they were all amazed by the durability of those coffins.

The coffins simply floated in the air. Now, people could vaguely see some translucent chains binding them to the cauldron in the Heavenly Boundary Line.

“Long Chen, you know that I missed this attack on purpose. I don’t want you to accidentally die too early. That would be boring.” Long Aotian didn’t look at those coffins, nor did he look at the cauldron. The only thing he was staring at was Long Chen, his hated mortal enemy.

“Go ahead and attack. I also want to see how powerful my seven-color Supreme Blood is. Since I’m going to take it back anyway, I should be mentally prepared,” responded Long Chen coldly.

Long Chen was also filled with hatred for Long Aotian. His battle intent continued to rise. Long Aotian’s power was beyond imagination. But the stronger Long Aotian was, the further he provoked the battle intent deep within Long Chen’s soul.

“Long Chen, don’t waste too much energy on him. Your goal is that bronze cauldron. Let me tell you, that bronze cauldron is a priceless treasure. You have to save energy to awaken it. Don’t lose out on something this major.” The dragon expert’s voice once more rang out in Long Chen’s mind.

Clearly, this bronze cauldron’s origins were immense, and the dragon expert greatly wished for Long Chen to obtain it.

“This person is my mortal enemy. He also knows the whereabouts of my father. Hence, I must defeat him and force him to spit out where my father is. As for the rest, I don’t care.” Long Chen shook his head.

If he was facing anyone else, he would definitely choose to first think about obtaining the cauldron rather than fighting. But Long Aotian was the exception. The two were destined mortal enemies. Whenever they met, there would be a battle to the death.

“Hahaha, this arrogance is the same as back then!” sneered Long Aotian. “Regretfully, I am no longer the old Long Aotian. I came to realize this!”

Long Aotian unleashed another punch. This time, a wild aura locked onto Long Chen, forcing him to receive it. Golden light flickered and flashed. After that, the runes flowing on top of Long Aotian’s fist increased in power. The entire heavenly tomb was quivering.

On the other hand, seven stars lit up on Long Chen’s fist, which was enveloped by a sacred light. This was a miniature form of the Seven Star Battle Armor.

This was something that Long Chen had grasped from the nine star heirs in the heavenly tribulation. It was to transfer the power of the seven stars to just one area of the body, allowing the power of the seven stars to erupt only in one spot.

Back then, Long Chen had almost been crippled by one of the nine star heirs with this technique. That was his first time seeing such a terrifying attack. But that attack also gave him enlightenment.

Previously, his astral energy could only flow throughout his entire body, giving him full body protection as it was evenly spreading throughout the four limbs. But at the end of the day, that power was spread and incapable of concentrating into a single attack.

But now that the mark of the seven stars appeared on his fist, all the astral energy in his body merged into a point in an instant. It was like a volcano was finally erupting; its power exploded.

This time, when their fists met, golden light shattered and Long Aotian grunted, his body swaying.

Just as Long Aotian was forced back, Long Chen raised his left hand and slapped him viciously in the face.

In front of everyone’s shocked gazes, Long Aotian was sent flying straight toward the bronze cauldron.
