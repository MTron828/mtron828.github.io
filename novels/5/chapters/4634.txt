Chapter 4623: Seven Stars, Moon Slash

BOOM!

The string of five beads pierced through Long Chens starry lotus. Long Chens self-created move couldnt stand up against this nine star disciple at all.

The five stars collided with Long Chen, leaving him a bloody pulp.

Six stars, God Seal!

BOOM!

The next moment, six stars surrounded Long Chen, leaving him horrified that he was unable to move.

Some mysterious energy had sealed all his power, and even the flow of his astral energy was sluggish, no longer flowing freely.

At the same time, a powerful twisting force gripped Long Chen, as if a pair of powerful hands were twisting him like wringing a towel.

Buzz.

No longer able to remain still, the Earth Cauldron appeared above Long Chen.

Senior, dont! Long Chen shouted with all his might, but blood spurted from his mouth as the twisting force shattered his insides.

Dont force it. He is a main descendant of the nine star line, while you are just a dabbler without a complete core technique. Its fundamentally unfair for you to fight him. Im already surprised you were able to last this long. This trial ends here! declared the Earth Cauldron.

In truth, Long Chens display had completely surpassed its expectations. Long Chen was much stronger than it expected, especially his ability to adapt.

However, he couldnt overcome this difference. After all, this nine star disciple was a heavenly genius from the most flourishing era of the nine star line and was even from an era where cultivators thrived.

It was akin to the birth of a prince and a commoner. Though the children might be the same at birth, the contrasting circumstances would result in significant disparities.

Regarding this trial, the Earth Cauldron just wanted Long Chen to know the difference between himself and the geniuses from ancient eras. This was meant to ignite his hunger for greater power and spur him to train more diligently.

No, Ill deal with him! Trust me! Long Chen exclaimed, spitting out blood that now included pieces of his internal organs. His condition was dire.

You idiot, not this again! The Earth Cauldron directly cursed him. Long Chen was being stubborn again. But if this was what he wanted, it couldnt stop him.

In the past, it would have been possible for the Earth Cauldron to forcibly stop him. But not anymore. Having formally acknowledged Long Chen as master, it could not betray Long Chens will. Even if Long Chen was dying, if he refused to permit it to save him, it could only watch.

The Earth Cauldron was anxious but couldnt do anything. Now, it had started to regret its decision.

Long Chen was twisted entirely out of shape. His body contorted so severely that his eyes seemed ready to pop out while staring at his own buttocks.

Youre going to die like this! You arent even from the same era as him, so theres no need to compare yourself like this! shouted the Earth Cauldron.

Im confident! Im starting to understand the true essence of the Nine Star Hegemon Body Art! Without absolute confidence, it is impossible to grasp the essence of the Nine Star Hegemon Body Art. Talent is something I have. Since I was chosen as a nine star heir, then I will be the main character of this world! Nothing can stop me! I will become the king of this world!

Long Chens voice came through the cracks between his teeth. Even in his perilous state, his will was still firm, not shaking in the slightest.

Long Chens divine ring was twisting, and his starry sea was being compressed, quivering intensely. It was as if Long Chen would be twisted apart along with his manifestation.

Once the divine ring was compressed to a certain limit, the starry sea suddenly surged forth like the tide.

Finally, Long Chens manifestation seemed to feel threatened and was fighting back, revealing a mighty aura. The next moment, ripples spread in every direction.

This is The Earth Cauldron was stunned. Was I mistaken? Was this trial not orchestrated by me, but rather a deeper layer of karma...?

Long Chens manifestation surged like a dragon awakening from a deep slumber, and a violet tide gushed out of his starry sea. The divine ring pulsed rhythmically like a beating heart pumping out blood with all its power.

Break! Long Chen suddenly roared as if possessed by something. When he stood up, countless stars floated around him, like the entire starry sea swarming around.

BOOM!

The six stars surrounding Long Chen shattered like a mirror, causing the entire desolate world to crumble. Even the nine star disciple was shaken by this terrifying display of power.

With the desolate world vanishing, Long Chen returned to the martial stage, facing the nine-star disciple with a cold glare.

The starry sea manifestation within Long Chens divine ring dimmed, and his entire body trembled, teetering on the brink of collapse.

In the silence that followed, the sound of blood dripping echoed ominously, like the ticking of a timer, measuring someone's life.

The nine star disciple then raised his hand, summoning a broadsword with seven stars flowing on top of it.

Its over.

Seeing this scene, Long Chen felt a sense of defeat wash over him. Based on the previous pattern, this attack would be several times stronger than the last.

On the other hand, Long Chen had already overdrafted his power, and even his starry sea manifestation was fading away. He couldnt think of any way to block this attack.

Ive fought until Im exhausted! I refuse to believe that youre still in peak condition! Lets see just who is stronger!

Long Chens voice reverberated with determination as he summoned a radiant starlight that enveloped him. Summoning the last dregs of his astral energy, he knew he wouldnt be able to stand after this.

However, Long Chen didnt hesitate to squeeze out this last bit of power, unwilling to let the Earth Cauldron intervene and halt the fight. He was driven by an unwavering desire to defeat this nine star disciple, a fervent longing that pushed thoughts of death from his mind.

This time, the Earth Cauldron remained silent and didnt intervene. It observed the nine star heir, whose body was on the verge of collapse.

Theres no cure for his stupidity. I think Im getting infected as well.

The Earth Cauldron let out a long sigh, a mixture of helplessness and self-mockery tinged with gratification and fondness.

Kill!

Long Chen charged toward the nine star disciple, unleashing a punch fueled by all his remaining power and determination.Checkk new ùíèovel chùíÇpters at novùíÜlbin(.)com

However, the force of this attack was at most half of his previous blow, as he was already well beyond the point of exhaustion.

Buzz.

Despite knowing that he was risking his life, Long Chen continued to throw himself forward. In response, the nine star disciple did not hesitate to raise his seven star blade.

Seven stars, Moon Slash!
