Chapter 4221 To Not Reciprocate Would Be Rude

The explosion of the little ball didn’t have much power, but it caused the expressions of countless devil experts to change.

“The human race has a certain saying: to not reciprocate would be rude. You should have a taste of being schemed against as well,” laughed Xia Chen.

The power of his formations managed to compress all the liquid and odor that the devil experts had used on the human race’s side. He then returned it to the devil race.

This odor was quite strange. It remained stuck in the void and couldn’t be dispersed or erased. But Xia Chen was able to use a formation technique to move it.

The devil experts had never dreamed that their karma would strike so quickly. Unwittingly, they had provided Xia Chen with the very noose that now tightened around their own necks.

In an instant, the golden-marked dark creatures were attracted by the odor, flooding toward the devil race’s side with the rest of the dark creatures.

As they approached, the void rumbled and the earth shook. These dark creatures were like bloodthirsty monsters, their presence stirring a mixture of shock and fury among the devil race's experts.Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Human race, are you trying to start a war?!”

Long Chen couldn’t even be bothered to respond to such a thing.

However, while Long Chen didn’t respond, the brave experts who had come to aid Long Chen did it for him.

“You idiots, you were the ones starting a war when you set this up! You’re the ones who provoked us! Grow a brain before you speak!”

The devil race’s experts didn’t even have a chance to reply, as the dark creatures had arrived in their midst. Moreover, these dark creatures were not only far stronger than the ones before but also incredibly numerous. Countless devil experts were torn to pieces by their sharp claws.

In just a moment, the devil race’s side descended into chaos. Although they roared and fought against the dark creatures with all their might, casualties still piled up quickly.

At first, the disciples on Long Chen’s side were laughing at their wretched state. However, they quickly stopped.

These dark creatures were simply too terrifying. They weren’t even comparable to the ones that the human race had just fought.

The dark creatures with golden marks were stronger than the human race’s Double Supremes. As for those with the dark-gold marks, their power was comparable to Triple Supreme Immortal Kings, their sharp claws and fangs capable of even tearing through World Domain divine items.

Seeing these creatures, most of the disciples on Long Chen’s side couldn’t help feeling a burst of fear. If it weren’t for Xia Chen drawing them away, they would be the ones having to deal with them.

With the dark creatures brought away, Long Chen’s side had it easy. Only a small portion of the dark creatures attacked them, so there was no need for the Dragonblood warriors to even do anything. Just the disciples of the Starry River Sect and Battle God Palace were fighting over the straggling creatures.

After all, having never encountered these dark creatures before, they needed to get some experience against them. The Dragonblood warriors had no intention of contesting them for this valuable opportunity.

“That should be enough karma for the devil race,” said Guo Ran delightedly as he watched the dark creatures slaughter the devil race.

However, Long Chen shook his head. “These creatures are only able to harm the ‘skin’ of the devil race, not their ‘bones’. It’s nothing fatal.”

“What?” Those experts who had come to reinforce Long Chen were all shocked.

“There are quite a few monsters within the devil race, and a single one of them would be enough to annihilate those creatures. However, they are still concealing their power. This demonstrates that disunity is not limited to the human race alone. Turning a blind eye to the plight of fellow members of your own race seems to be a shared failing.”

Long Chen wore a faint smile. These bad traits did not solely belong to the human race; they extended to the devil race as well. It was evident in the way they confronted the dark creatures. They were solely fighting for themselves without coordination.

Seeing that, Long Chen felt much better. Every race had their own strong points, but you couldn’t only look at the strong sides while ignoring the rest. The human race wasn’t the only ones with faults.

“One person can wipe them all out?” said someone in shock. They could not comprehend just what kind of force that would require.

“Then what about our side?” asked the other person probingly.

Long Chen simply smiled and didn’t reply. Guo Ran was the one who patted that person on the shoulder and chortled, “Our boss isn’t the only one who can wipe out all those creatures at once.”

Hearing this, that person was shocked, as well as the others who had come to aid them. “Doesn’t that mean that you weren’t in danger before?”

Guo Ran smiled. “Weren’t we waiting for you to save us?”

Their expressions changed. Long Chen and the others were fully capable of dealing with these creatures? Then hadn’t they risked their lives to save them for nothing? Weren’t they just laughingstocks?

“We really are foolish,” said one person with a bitter smile.

Guo Ran panicked when he heard that. He wasn’t trying to brag this time, but he just didn’t know how to explain it better.

Long Chen looked at those people. “What you saved this time is not us, but yourselves and our people. You saved the eternal fire in the human race’s hearts. The human race should precisely assist each other against our common enemies. Only when we are united can the human race continue to thrive, and only by working together can we save everyone we care about. We won’t grieve the deaths of those who have lost the essence of what is most important. On the staircase, I helped save the weak, and many people thought that we were fools. After that, when we were in danger, you risked your lives to help us, and many people said that you were fools too. But the human race’s eternal fire requires idiots like us to inherit it, don’t you think so?”

“Hahaha, that’s right, that’s absolutely right! We’re all fools, hahaha!” After Long Chen put it this way, these people broke into smiles and laughter. These were words that struck a chord deep within their hearts.

In an instant, the moment of awkwardness passed. To put it frankly, they were all the same type of people. Long Chen’s words ignited their hot blood. It felt like they had suddenly found a group of like-minded friends.

Seeing this, Guo Ran sighed with relief. He truly admired Long Chen. The power of his mouth was not at all inferior to that of his fists.

“The human race has deliberately incited a war and broken the rules! Everyone, attack them together!” Suddenly, a resounding cry rang out from within the devil race. The next moment, numerous devil experts left the core region and headed straight for Long Chen’s side.

A resonance spread with this person’s lead as countless devil experts banded together. Ignoring the lives and deaths of the other devil experts, they bypassed the dark creatures and flew toward Long Chen.

In an instant, numerous elites had gathered. Following this, a disturbance rose within the demonic beast race.

“Kill Long Chen! Eliminate this scammer of the human race!” howled someone within the demonic beast race.

Looking at them, Long Chen suddenly recalled how members of the demonic beast race had been amongst those who had thrown spheres of liquid at them. It seemed that those people were part of this demonic beast race.

“Prepare yourselves. The curtains of a great battle are about to be drawn open. This time, we’ll give the ten thousand races a new understanding of the human race!” declared Long Chen.

The Dragonblood warriors were already prepared and had been anticipating this moment for a long time. However, at this time, a sudden change occurred.

The ground in front of the devil experts exploded and sharp spears shot out of the ground, drowning this army of tens of millions.
