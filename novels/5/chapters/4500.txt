Chapter 4489 Forced to the Brink

BOOM!

The lightning spear destroyed the void, forcing a figure to come flying out wretchedly. The Lifehunter expert spat out blood as he had been interrupted more than ten times while moving through space with his secret art.

The Lifehunter race had countless terrifying divine abilities. Amongst them, their abilities to conceal themselves and move through space were unparalleled.

While formation masters channeled this power from heavens and earth, the Lifehunter race had this innate ability. Their bodies were like formation discs for them to carry out spatial transportation.

However, Long Chen had already locked onto this Lifehunter expert, so every time he tried to use this technique, Long Chen accurately stopped him.

Long Chen’s main disadvantage lay in the fact that his area of attack was so huge that he was exhausting a huge amount of energy. Fortunately, the energy that he was exhausting was Lei Linger’s, and Lei Linger was constantly replenishing her energy as the primal chaos space absorbed the five Saint corpses. The thunderforce they were unleashing was enough to fuel these enormous attacks.

On the other hand, the Lifehunter expert was running out of energy after being repeatedly injured. Unable to fight or run, he was no longer able to remain calm.

As Lei Linger was absorbing the tribulation energy of the five Saints, her attacks possessed the aura of a Saint and were even stronger than Long Chen’s. Despite this, the Lifehunter expert managed to block her assaults multiple times and still endured, preventing Long Chen from delivering a fatal blow. Hence, it went without saying that he was incredibly powerful, overshadowing even Netherdragon Tianzhao.

The Lifehunter expert stabbed the void with his sword and vanished just like that.

Seeing this, Long Chen shot after him. With his Kunpeng wings at full power, Long Chen’s speed was still one level higher than that of the Lifehunter expert.Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

The Lifehunter expert unleashed countless movement arts, even using clones to confuse Long Chen. However, he was unable to escape.

This was the reason why this Lifehunter expert felt fear. His race excelled in assassination arts, boasting incredible speed and illusionary movement techniques. If they failed at an assassination, they could easily flee, and no one would be able to catch them.

However, Long Chen was faster than him, which terrified him even more than being beaten in combat.

With Long Chen following close behind him, he felt like there was a fiend hunting him, and he was unable to escape no matter what he did. He had never experienced such a miserable feeling before.

Strangely, despite being able to catch up and attack at any moment, Long Chen didn’t do anything. He was just following the Lifehunter expert closely.

Long Chen had the upper hand now. He had to refrain from making a rash move and letting his target escape. After all, his goal wasn’t to beat but to kill this bastard. The closer Long Chen got to this point, the more he had to keep his cool. Right now, Long Chen was using Lei Linger’s power, so he was using up very little of his own energy, unlike his opponent.

Although Long Chen didn’t know much about the Lifehunter race, from his opponent’s fighting style, he could deduce that his opponent belonged to the explosive style that lacked endurance.

Once Long Chen survived the initial assault, he could just exhaust his opponent. The more time that passed, the more advantageous it would be to Long Chen, and the greater his chances of killing his opponent.

The Lifehunter expert also knew this, which was why he had been trying to use countless means to shake off Long Chen. However, he was only wasting his energy. The more energy he used up, the more he panicked. The confidence he had when he first entered the academy was long gone.

With a resounding shout, Long Chen’s lightning spear struck multiple times, causing heaven and earth to quake as lightning surged. He skillfully disrupted the Lifehunter expert’s movement art eight times.

“You are courting death!” the Lifehunter expert roared with fury. He had just used a secret art to unleash eight movement arts, and as long as one worked, he would be able to escape.

However, Long Chen stopped all of them perfectly, causing his opponent to use up most of his remaining energy.

“Since you’ve pushed me to this extent, you can die with me!”

The Lifehunter expert’s visage contorted, his eyes ablaze with scarlet intensity. He stopped fleeing and suddenly shot straight toward Long Chen, his sword aimed right at Long Chen’s throat.

Suddenly, Long Chen let go of his lightning spear. It passed right by the Lifehunter expert and stabbed the space behind him.

At this moment, the Seven Peak Sword materialized in Long Chen’s hand, blocking the mysterious sword. Subsequently, the Lifehunter expert exploded.

Shortly after, a space in the distance erupted, and the Lifehunter expert was forced out of the void again. He had used a scheme, acting like he was launching a suicidal blow while what attacked Long Chen was just a clone. However, the sword was real.

Despite that, he was unable to trick Long Chen, losing his sword in the process. He spat out blood, and no one knew whether it was due to rage or injury.

The mysterious sword somehow teleported back into his hand and absorbed the blood he had just spat out, resonating.

“Lifehunter Peak Kill Sword Dance!”

With a furious roar, he became one with his sword and pierced toward Long Chen.

Long Chen’s expression was serious. Lightning materialized in his hand, transforming into a lightning blade that shielded him.

Explosive sounds shook the heavens. In the blink of an eye, they had clashed thousands of times. The Lifehunter expert’s attacks were like a storm, while Long Chen’s lightning blade was an impermeable barrier.

Finally, there was a loud and short sound. The Lifehunter expert was sent flying, blood oozing from his mouth. With disheveled hair and a pale complexion, he stared at Long Chen in disbelief.

“I didn’t beat you last time, not because you were faster or my reactions were slower. I was busy saving someone. Did you really think that you could beat me in close-range combat?” Long Chen pointed his blade at the Lifehunter expert coldly.

Previously, Long Chen had only been injured because he had to look after Luo Ning. Now, he showcased his technique as the king of close-range combat.

The Lifehunter expert panted. Engaging in close-range combat was considered taboo for assassins, and it also drained his energy. However, he had no choice but to take the risk.

In the end, the last exchange and Long Chen’s words told him that he wouldn’t win with this method either. Caught in a dilemma, his face contorted with rage.

“You are the one who forced me to do this!” he snarled.

Suddenly, the Lifehunter expert gritted his teeth, and a clump of violet blood appeared on his sword. When that violet blood emerged, Long Chen’s expression changed.
