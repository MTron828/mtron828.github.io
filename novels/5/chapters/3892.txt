Chapter 3881 Malevolent Spirit Possession

Silver Moon City’s lord had come with hundreds of thousands of experts. Seeing Long Chen inside the egg, he smiled sinisterly.

“Enemies truly meet often. Ignorant brat, you’ll finally pay the price for your ignorance. Even if you found the treasure, you’ll only end up offering it to others.”

The city lord’s figure swayed, and he suddenly shot at Long Chen.

“Old fellow, if you want to touch my boss, you’ll have to get past me first!”

Guo Ran appeared in front of the city lord, wielding his dual sabers.

“Hmph, a mantis trying to stop a chariot. You don’t know your own power.”

The city lord sneered as he slowly extended his hand. A gleaming silver sword materialized within his grasp. With a swift yet deliberate motion, he raised the sword high above his head, causing divine radiance to erupt from its blade. After that, he slashed it at Guo Ran.

As he launched his attack, a powerful manifestation burst into existence, taking the form of a silver crescent moon that arched forward like a hook. The glow emanating from it should have carried an aura of holiness and sacredness, yet an explicable sinister aura tainted it.

BOOM!

Guo Ran’s dual sabers clashed directly with the city lord’s sword, resulting in an explosive collision. A dazzling mix of silver divine radiance and golden Blood Qi then burst forth from the impact. The city lord’s body trembled involuntarily as he was affected by the force of the collision.

On the other hand, Guo Ran was hurtled backward into the distance. The space behind rippled as he passed through it, indicating the terrifying force that had struck him.

Despite the tremendous impact, the city lord was shocked to see Guo Ran remain unscathed. He didn’t even cough up a drop of blood.

However, deep inside, Guo Ran was not in a good state. The forceful strike had thrown his Blood Qi into chaos, and he found himself unable to gather his power again. That was a very dangerous state, as he needed to quickly regain control of his body. That attack was truly terrifying.

“Interesting. A weak person who somehow manages to control power a thousand times beyond their capabilities. But so what? You are still a mantis futilely trying to stop a chariot. Only death awaits you,” sneered the city lord.

“Big words! You, a Divine Venerate, have lived tens of thousands of years longer than I have, but you still have the face to brag about bullying a youngster?! Your face is thicker than Silver Moon City’s walls!” retorted Guo Ran.

Guo Ran was both shocked and infuriated by the city lord’s mocking words. His dragon blood energy was as vast as a sea, and his power could topple the heavens. However, he was in a miserable state right now.

The majority of his combat power resided within his battle armor, so the sudden surge of his bloodline power actually rendered his once-ideal battle armor inadequate. After all, the runes inscribed in his armor were adjusted to his previous power level and couldn’t swiftly keep up with such an increase in power. As a result, he found himself unable to use his battle armor properly.

His battle armor had been like perfectly fitting shoes. But now that his feet were too big, his battle armor couldn’t match his requirements anymore. He would have to inscribe new runes so that the two were a good match once again.

The current Guo Ran was like running barefoot. Perhaps such a thing wouldn’t be a problem for others, but to Guo Ran who was used to wearing his perfect shoes, it was not a good situation to be in.

If Guo Ran could get some time to adjust his armor, he would definitely be much stronger and wouldn’t need to care about this city lord.

Most infuriating to Guo Ran, however, was the audacity of this city lord. The latter had lived for so many years but had the gall to put on arrogant airs in front of him.

The city lord seethed with anger at Guo Ran’s words, unable to deny the truth behind them. As the lord of Silver Moon City, he had indeed lived for countless years and boasted a cultivation base two major realms above Guo Ran’s. Thus, he had no qualifications to mock Guo Ran. In the same realm, he wouldn’t have been a match for Guo Ran.

“All you do is spout empty words! Die!” The city lord stepped forward, shooting toward Guo Ran like a bolt of silver lightning, not giving him a chance to recover.

BOOM!

However, just as his silver sword was about to strike Guo Ran, a large runic shield appeared in front of him. As a result, the attack only caused that shield to shatter. A scholarly man then appeared in front of him.

Xia Chen had rushed over and blocked the city lord’s attack. When the runic shield shattered, it erupted like a beautiful firework, sending silver light into the sky.

The city lord’s pupils constricted in astonishment. Xia Chen had dissipated his power into the sky without receiving even a bit of backlash. Such a marvelous technique was unlike everything he had ever witnessed throughout his long years of existence.

At this moment, he put away any arrogance he had. Whether it was Guo Ran or Xia Chen, neither was capable of giving him a threatening feeling. But the fact that they could easily block his attacks made him feel wary.

“Go kill Long Chen!”

The city lord waved his sword to his people. As soon as he did that, Silver Moon City’s hundreds of thousands of experts flooded toward Long Chen.

Amongst them were two Divine Venerates with shocking auras. They were the city lord’s left and right hands, and their power was second only to him.

The two of them were charging ahead of everyone else. At this moment, two kinds of runes flowed on top of their bodies, and peculiar sounds emanated from their manifestations, reminiscent of the roars of ancient beasts.Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Seeing this scene, Xia Chen and Guo Ran were greatly shocked. Both of these Divine Venerates, who had joined the fray, were Double Supremes with Supreme Blood and Supreme Bones.

If the two of them were Double Supremes, then the city lord had to be a Double Supreme as well. In other words, the current city lord had yet to use his full power.

As a result, both Xia Chen and Guo Ran panicked. If they were to stop those two Double Supremes, no one would be there to stop the city lord.

Just as the two of them were at their wit’s end, two figures appeared and blocked the two Double Supremes. It was Li Qi and Song Mingyuan.

The two of them had woken up just now and came charging over.

“Earth energy, Malevolent Spirit Possession!”

When a giant beast appeared behind each of them, an ominous aura unfurled, accompanied by a low growl that reverberated through the air. It felt as though a bloodthirsty beast had set its sights on its prey.

A rod appeared in both of their hands, enhanced by flowing runes on top. When the two beasts were drawn into their rods, the runes unleashed a burst of light. The next moment, with a resounding crash, Li Qi and Song Mingyuan smashed the rods at the two Double Supremes.

Seeing this scene, the two Double Supremes felt as if a death god had locked onto them. With a howl, they also took out their weapons.

BOOM! BOOM!

Upon collision, both of their weapons exploded and they shot back like shooting stars. They couldn’t even receive a single attack from Li Qi and Song Mingyuan.

“Profound earth energy?” The city lord’s expression changed, reflecting a mix of concern and alarm. It was evident that both of his subordinates had suffered a significant injury.

At this moment, the silver moon in his manifestation spun. When two different kinds of runes appeared in his manifestation, his aura instantly grew multiple times, becoming violent to the extent of shaking the world. His aura was now several times greater than those two Double Supremes.

“Try to receive my attack if you dare!” The city lord snorted, his sword slashing through the air again. This time, the power of his sword was condensed to the pinnacle. As a result, a thin cut was left in the void, looking like a blade cutting paper. Xia Chen’s expression changed as he realized that he couldn’t disperse this attack’s power.

Unexpectedly, a spear tore through the void, blocking this highly condensed attack. The collision produced a whirlwind of power that blew through this world.

A large figure then appeared within this shattered space, his bald head illuminating the scattered runes. When he showed up, his aura was like that of an ancient beast and his hunter-like eyes were eyeing his prey. The awe-inspiring attack from the city lord was unable to shake his figure.

“The Dragonblood Legion’s first captain, Gu Yang, is here to exchange a few pointers.”
