“Humans are the most spiritual beings in this world, or why would you make the effort to transform into human form all the time? How are you qualified to look down on the human race?” sneered Long Chen.

“Don’t think that you’re unrivaled just because you’ve passed your tribulation. All your power was barely enough to pass a simple tribulation. Against me, the only thing left for you is death!” roared True Immortal Jiaoqi.

BOOM!

Evilmoon met True Immortal Jiaoqi’s halberd. The void exploded, and True Immortal Jiaoqi was pushed back. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Even with all his power, True Immortal Jiaoqi was unable to stop Long Chen from pushing him back. That shocked everyone, as Long Chen was just using his physical strength, while True Immortal Jiaoqi was going all-out.

“Humans are the most spiritual of all beings. Humans are the masters of this world. Humans are closer to the Dao. What qualifications do you have to insult the human race? Is this your power? Is this your pride? Is the qilin-drake race’s only ability to be slapped in the face?” Long Chen was using only one hand as he continued to push back True Immortal Jiaoqi.

In the distance, the experts of the Martial Heaven Alliance let out excited cheers. The Xuan Beasts and ancient races always insulted the human race, calling them garbage and ants. Long Chen’s words were the truth though. The human race was the one in charge of this world.

“Qilin’s Wrath, Drake’s Might!” True Immortal Jiaoqi roared, and he stamped on the ground, forcibly stopping Long Chen’s momentum. A giant hole appeared in the ground around him. He had actually used a divine ability.

However, even as he went all-out to stop Long Chen, a cracking sound rang out clearly. True Immortal Jiaoqi’s arms broke, and he was sent flying.

True Immortal Jiaoqi’s manifestation suddenly vanished. He took on his true form, becoming a monster larger than a mountain, one whose upper body was a qilin but his lower body was a drake. As for his halberd, it grew in proportion to the rest of his body.

Long Chen swung Evilmoon once more, and a giant saber-image slashed into the halberd. Long Chen’s body shook slightly, but True Immortal Jiaoqi was once more sent flying.

“Even in your strongest state, you aren’t a match for me. Is this the power you claim to be above the human race?” sneered Long Chen.

In his Xuan Beast form, it was difficult to tell True Immortal Jiaoqi’s expression. But based on his eyes, it seemed that he was angry.

“Die!”

A pillar of Blood Qi suddenly surged out of him. True Immortal Jiaoqi was actually activating his Spirit Blood. The fur covering his upper body lit up, while the scales on his lower body had runes appear on them.

The void repeatedly exploded as True Immortal Jiaoqi clashed against Long Chen, but no matter what he did, he was unable to get an advantage over Long Chen.

Suddenly, heaven and earth were split open by the arrival of a flame blade. The air ignited as it swung down. Huo Lieyun was joining in, and he had transformed into a flame giant. He was actually chanting the Nirvana Scripture, allowing him to absorb the world’s flame energy.

BOOM! Long Chen blocked with Evilmoon, but it resulted in his arm almost going numb. Huo Lieyun’s power was exceptionally violent and even greater than True Immortal Jiaoqi’s.

“Long Chen, you might have destroyed my physical body, but I managed to turn that into a blessing by condensing the Flame Devil Body! I now have an undying body, so to thank you, I’ll let you see the power of the Flame Devil Body when combined with the Nirvana Scripture!”

The ground suddenly exploded all over and lava spurted out. It was like a scene from the apocalypse.

Right at that moment, a giant blood-colored spear pierced toward Long Chen. As Xie Luo joined in, an evil aura filled the air. He merged with the skeleton in his manifestation, and due to that merger, his aura became ten times stronger than before.

BOOM! Long Chen’s palm split open, and a black qi instantly invaded the wound.

However, thunderforce flowed on Long Chen’s hand, expelling the black qi. The sound of bone-chilling mournful wails rang out as he incinerated the curse, which stemmed from the resentment of spirits.

“This is your world energy? It’s not so strong.” Long Chen looked at Xie Luo with a cold smile. True Immortal Jiaoqi had wanted to kill him with just his physical strength, as that was the only way to erase his heart-devil. As for Huo Lieyun, he had condensed the Flame Devil Body and had set foot onto another cultivation path. He no longer possessed world energy. It was only Xie Luo who had used his world energy, resulting in this injury. However, his power was not as great as Long Chen had expected.

“Long Chen, face your death!”

Just after receiving Xie Luo’s attack, Yan Wei, whom Long Chen had never fought before, came charging over. He had a copper rod which he swung at him.

At the same time, Gui Can’s attack also arrived, and Di Feng’s three divine items activated at once, unleashing rays of divine light at Long Chen.

True Immortal Jiaoqi, Huo Lieyun, Xie Luo, Di Feng, Gui Can, and Yan Wei had surrounded him. Outside, the four Fate Princes were pointing their swords at Long Chen. It was unknown what attack they were brewing.

“Don’t hold back! Use your world energy to capture Long Chen right now, or the others won’t be able to hold on!” shouted Di Feng. At this time, the Dragonblood Legion was finally on the offense. The other experts they had gathered were unable to stop them.

Cloud had taken on the true form of the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow, and she was viciously slaughtering everyone in her path. She seemed almost crazy, as if the people she was attacking were those that had killed her fellow Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrows.

As for the other Dragonblood warriors, they didn’t charge over to Long Chen. They were fighting with a steady tempo. Only Cloud was going all-out to repay the blood debt they owed her.

BOOM!

Suddenly, a powerful qi wave spread, forcing back True Immortal Jiaoqi and the others. This qi wave contained an incredible amount of world energy.

“When it comes to world energy, I have it too. Let’s see whose is stronger.”

Long Chen’s 108,000 astral spaces activated at once, and his first target was True Immortal Jiaoqi. True Immortal Jiaoqi was sent tumbling back from a slash of Long Chen’s saber, unable to resist. “In front of the human race’s power, you’re the most inferior ant.”

After striking True Immortal Jiaoqi, Long Chen’s saber turned, slashing behind him. Xie Luo’s spear was blocked, and then a burst of power sent its owner flying.

“How can his world energy be so terrifying?!”

They were shocked by this power. Long Chen’s world energy was creating a halo of light around him. Within that region, this world’s laws were forced back. That showed that his world energy was repelling the Martial Heaven Continent’s world energy.

That was a shocking thing. For other people, they used their world energy through their weapons, or when their bodies clashed. That was the only time they could unleash it.

If they unleashed it through the air like this, they would be suppressed by the Martial Heaven Continent’s laws. Their world energy would lose effect.

However, Long Chen’s world energy was so powerful that it forced back the Martial Heaven Continent’s laws.

“Attack!”

On the outside, Yu Xiaoyun could no longer endure it. He changed plans, actually sending the Daynight Furnace toward Long Chen. He had a bad feeling, so he dispelled the Brahma Divine Diagram’s barrier.

The old man’s gaze had been locked on Yu Xiaoyun the entire time, and the Heaven Splitting Blade immediately slashed toward him.

Tu Qianshang and the seven bosses also attacked, as well as Qu Jianying, Yan Nantian, and the other experts of the Martial Heaven Alliance.

The Martial Heaven Alliance’s people could see that Long Chen was their only hope, so they could not allow him to die. They would rather bet their lives on this youngster who had repeatedly created miracles.

“Dragonblood Legion, attack! We’re killing until we’re happy today!” Guo Ran raised his saber, summoning his golden armor.

“Kill!”

The Dragonblood warriors roared and activated their Dragon Blood Battle Armor. They charged at the Netherpassage experts, disregarding the Life Star disciples, which were no longer even qualified to enter the Dragonblood Legion’s gazes.

Seeing countless Netherpassage experts charge in, Long Chen smiled.

“Azure Dragon Battle Armor!”
