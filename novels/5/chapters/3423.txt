Chapter 3412 Lightning Falcon Secret Art

In a private room, Long Chen and Lei Yuner stood facing each other. In the distance, Ying Bokong was staring closely at them.

Ying Bokong was extremely grateful. Because Long Chen wanted to learn Lei Yuner’s special movement art, they rented a training room.

Originally, Ying Bokong shouldn’t be here for such a thing, and Lei Yuner didn’t want him here either. But Long Chen had him enter, because he said that if he didn’t, the Water Mallard race and the Mammoth Divine Elephant race would definitely target him. It didn’t matter if it was within the city, with their power, they could still find a way to kill Ying Bokong.

He was only allowed into this room due to concerns about his safety, which was why Ying Bokong was so grateful to Long Chen.

It had to be known that while his Silver Wing Hawk Eagle race was not small, it couldn’t come close to comparing to the likes of the Lightning Falcon race, the Mammoth Divine Elephant race, and the Water Mallard race.

Furthermore, he was only an ordinary genius of the Silver Wing Hawk Eagle race. If he was crushed to death, the Silver Wing Hawk Eagle race wouldn’t dare to even mention it in the future.

Thus, he no longer felt any resentment toward Long Chen, only gratefulness and reverence. Long Chen was too powerful. Following someone as strong as him wasn’t something embarrassing. Instead, it was an honor.

Lei Yuner’s Blood Qi buzzed and lightning runes grew active in her eyes. As her silver hair rose slightly, lightning runes appeared all over her body.

“Are you prepared?” Lei Yuner had entered her combat state, and her aura was completely different from normal. It was fierce and tyrannical.

The falcon was originally a bird of prey that captured all kinds of lifeforms for food. In that case, the Lightning Falcon race was the emperor of the falcons, and they were exceptionally ferocious.

Long Chen had a shield in his left hand and a spear in his right hand. Lightning runes covered his body as well. When his lightning runes appeared, the entire training room rumbled. An air of destruction came from him.

“Your thunderforce contains the power of the Heavenly Daos. If you have children with me, our children will definitely be supreme experts!” exclaimed Lei Yuner when she saw those lightning runes.

Although she had sensed his thunderforce, it was only when he displayed it that she was truly shocked. His thunderforce was one with the Heavenly Daos.

Of course, his thunderforce was one with the Heavenly Daos. It came from the heavenly tribulation lightning that was absorbed by Lei Linger. Hence, this lightning had her mark on it, as well as Long Chen’s will. It was a special lightning, unique in the world.

“Stop talking nonsense. Attack. Once I learn your movement art, I’ll teach you my own peerless lightning technique!” shouted Long Chen sternly. This foolish child was still a kid herself, yet she spent all day thinking about having children.

“Alright, I’m going to start.”

Lei Yuner once more entered her combat state. Her aura grew incomparably condensed, and her eyes grew fierce. When she entered her combat state, she was no longer a child but a ferocious, merciless beast.

The void quivered and Lei Yuner vanished.

“What speed!”

Long Chen’s heart shook. His mental energy was covering the entire training room, but as soon as Lei Yuner vanished, even his mental energy lost track of her.

It was to be known that her mental energy couldn’t possibly compare to his. In other words, she was inconceivably fast, so fast that not even his mental energy could keep up.

BOOM!

Relying on his sense of danger, Long Chen swung his shield in a certain direction. However, he was shocked to find that he had struck nothing. Lei Yuner’s hand then patted his shoulder.

“What a movement art!” exclaimed Long Chen. She was incredibly fast. The moment he blocked her, she was already gone. She patted Long Chen’s shoulder before he was able to use his shield to push her aside.

“Hehe, I’m going to accelerate,” Lei Yuner giggled. A pair of wings then appeared on her back.

At that moment, this training room became filled with images of her. It wasn’t an illusion; it was simply her moving so fast that it appeared as if thousands of her were attacking at once.

Long Chen swept out his spear and blocked with his shield repeatedly, but there were still many times when Lei Yuner’s attacks landed on him.

Her attacks lacked any killing or destructive intent, resulting in Long Chen’s sense of danger not being as effective. Furthermore, she was truly too fast. He could only rely on his instincts to keep up with her.Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

Long Chen was pleasantly surprised, as well as grateful. Lei Yuner was clearly displaying how she circulated her thunderforce while moving for him to see.

Long Chen wasn’t capable of grasping this technique like this, but Lei Linger was. She had formed lightning armor around his body, absorbing her attacks and sensing the method to circulate her thunderforce.

As a lightning spirit body, Lei Linger was capable of absorbing any lightning art. There were no secrets that could be hidden from her. As she continuously watched Lei Yuner’s movements, she quickly began to condense runes.

These were identical to Lei Yuner’s core runes, which were necessary to use the Lightning Falcon race’s divine abilities.

After fighting for an hour, Long Chen suddenly took a step. Lei Yuner was in the midst of launching a palm when he vanished.

Just as she was astonished, Long Chen appeared behind her and tapped her back.

Lei Yuner reached out to grab him, only to miss once more. She was truly shocked now. Long Chen had dodged her attacks twice using the Lightning Falcon race’s movement art.

After recovering from her shock, she once more accelerated. Long Chen was filled with praise. The Lightning Falcon race’s movement art was truly powerful.

Lei Yuner didn’t hold back at all in teaching him, and Lei Linger didn’t hold back at all in learning. After two hours, the entire room was rumbling with thunder. It looked as if there were thousands of Long Chens and Lei Yuners chasing each other.

As for Ying Bokong, he was dazed after just watching for a bit. He almost threw up. He shut then his eyes and didn’t dare to open them again after that. This speed had reached such a level that his eyes couldn’t even keep up. Just trying to do so would use up his mental energy.

BOOM!

As the lightning in the air vanished, Long Chen and Lei Yuner appeared once more. Lei Yuner praised, “You really are skillful! You were made to learn lightning arts! You grasped my Lightning Falcon race’s movement art so quickly.”

Long Chen reddened slightly. This wasn’t him learning it; it was all Lei Linger. Hence, this praise made him feel guilty.

“The Lightning Falcon race’s movement art is absolutely marvelous. I’ve greatly benefited from this. But I won’t let you lose out.”

A sphere of lightning appeared in Long Chen’s hand, and the entire training room quivered violently. Cracks then appeared on the ground, ceiling, and walls.

“What terrifying condensed energy!” Lei Yuner was shocked to see that sphere of lightning. She had never thought that thunderforce could be condensed to such a level.

“Look with your heart. I will teach you this technique called World Extermination Lightning Radiance,” said Long Chen.
