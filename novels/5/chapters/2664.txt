Chapter 2653 Alldevil Heavenwalker

BOOM!

Long Chen didn’t turn back. He simply smashed a fist behind him and the divine light exploded, transforming into a wave of devil qi.

This devil qi was not immediately crushed by the sea of lightning. It seemed it had a certain resistance to lightning.

The devil qi twisted and turned, condensing into a demonic man with a black horn and a pair of wings.

“It’s the Alldevil Heavenwalker!”

Countless experts quivered. He was the one who had defeated both Ye Liangchen and Jiang Wuchen in front of Devil Spirit Mountain. Jiang Wuchen had even had his leg cut off.

In that battle, the Alldevil Heavenwalker had been so powerful that the Martial Heaven Continent’s experts had been unable to pose any serious threat to him. He had come back now.

Long Chen dodged the Blood Fiend Devil Lord’s furious attack and looked at the Alldevil Heavenwalker. He nodded. “Yes, I can confirm from your eyes that you’re someone that I conned. After sleeping on a chamberpot for a few years, how did a life rod end up growing on your head? Is this an evolution from smelling piss too long?”

Guo Ran and the others’ shock was broken by these simple words. They were unable to hold back a chuckle. They now realized that the black horn on the Alldevil Heavenwalker’s head truly was strangely shaped. Yes, the head was thicker than the rest of it. Yes, it really was a bit similar.

Meng Qi and the others had blank faces, not knowing what Long Chen was talking about. But they saw Gu Yang and the others laughing, as well as others staring oddly at the Alldevil Heavenwalker’s horn.

“Long Chen, I’ll make you die a miserable death today.”

The originally calm Alldevil Heavenwalker instantly blew up in anger. He was a peerless expert who had been sealed into a divine fetus to one day come out and dominate the world.

However, when he woke up, he found himself sleeping on a smelly chamberpot. Let alone him, even an ordinary person would be unable to accept such a humiliation. In his fury, he directly charged onto the Martial Heaven Continent to vent without alerting anyone.

After that, since Long Chen didn’t appear, he could only return to the entrance of the devil world at the bottom of the devil sea of Devil Spirit Mountain. He then cultivated to the great circle of his realm, as well as took out a certain treasure.

Having been in seclusion when Long Chen had taken the Western Desert Ax, he had missed another chance to fight with Long Chen.

Now he returned not just to take the karmic luck pearl but also to personally resolve his enmity with Long Chen, Chang Hao, and Bao Buping by killing them.

However, with just a few simple words, Long Chen managed to fully ignite the fury inside his heart. He was actually making a joke of his devil emperor horn. That was the greatest insult possible to his bloodline.

“Die!”

The Alldevil Heavenwalker immediately unleashed a killing blow. Devil qi swirled around him as he unleashed a punch.

The raging devil qi blasted apart the nearby demonic king lightning beasts. That sight was incredibly shocking.

“Heavens, these terrifying lightning beast kings are nothing in front of them!” exclaimed one person. To these regular experts, these lightning beasts were existences on the level of nightmares. If they encountered these lightning beasts, they’d definitely die.

However, these lightning beasts appeared incredibly weak, unable to receive a single blow from Long Chen, the Alldevil Heavenwalker, and the Blood Fiend Devil Lord.

Lightning and devil qi exploded, while Long Chen and the Alldevil Heavenwalker both retreated. Long Chen snorted and sent a kick at the dragon woman charging over at him. Her fist struck his foot, and he borrowed the impact to dodge the Blood Fiend Devil Lord’s attack.

“Three against one? Do you think that I’m afraid?”

Battle intent overflowed out of Long Chen. His blood was boiling inside of him. This was his blood that thirsted for battle.

“You two retreat. I’ll fight him alone!” shouted the Alldevil Heavenwalker as he attacked Long Chen.

“What a joke. Do you think that’s possible?” sneered the dragon woman, also charging over at Long Chen.

The Blood Fiend Devil Lord sneered. Although he didn’t say anything, that expression was full of contempt.

The three of them pounced. A fierce battle with Long Chen would allow them to be touched by more of the karmic luck, so no one was willing to let go of this opportunity. That was why this request from the Alldevil Heavenwalker was a giant joke.

At this moment, divine lightning wrapped around Long Chen like a layer of battle armor. He fought with his fists against all three of them.

“Don’t worry. In terms of close-range combat, if my boss claimed himself to be number two, no one in this world would dare to say that they were number one,” said Guo Ran confidently upon seeing Meng Qi and the others’ worried expressions.

He was clearest on Long Chen’s close-combat capabilities that were practically unrivaled. That was because fighting at that range was based on the courage to spill blood and risk death. At the very least, in Guo Ran’s memories, Long Chen had never been at a disadvantage against anyone.

Guo Ran had only just spoken when it was like Long Chen was replying to him. A hand struck the Alldevil Heavenwalker’s face, sending him tumbling back. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

“Don’t shake that thing on your head at me like that. It’s very disgusting, don’t you know?” Long Chen didn’t forget to mock his enemy after striking him.

Hearing that, Meng Qi and the others turned red. Only now did they understand why Gu Yang and the others were laughing before. This fellow was far too coarse.

The surrounding experts were dumbfounded. Was Long Chen defying the heavens? He had just slapped the Blood Fiend Devil Lord, and now he slapped the Alldevil Heavenwalker.

This was an intense battle where he was one against three, but he could still slap someone in the face. Just how did he do this?

“In all my years, this is my first time feeling like prostrating myself in admiration to a technique.”

Hidden within the void, the High Priest couldn’t help sighing in praise. He had never seen a technique like this even with all his experience.

Daoist Heavenly Feather also nodded. She had lived for many years and seen countless geniuses. She herself had studied countless amazing divine arts, but this technique of Long Chen’s had reached a sublime realm. It was practically perfect. Even in a chaotic battle, he could land a slap on his opponent’s face.

Even the High Priest and Daoist Heavenly Feather were sighing in amazement, let alone the other experts. They practically viewed Long Chen as a god now.

Peerless heavenly geniuses? Rulers of their own worlds? As long as they encountered Long Chen, they would still be slapped in the face!

This technique had little ability to damage someone physically, but the mental wound was much worse. It was heaven-defying. The Alldevil Heavenwalker was slapped, causing the Blood Fiend Devil Lord to feel some satisfaction.

He had also been slapped by Long Chen and lost his face. Now that someone else had been slapped, it felt like he had been comforted. A small smile appeared on his face.

However, as soon as that smile appeared, he was also slapped from an inconceivable angle. His head buzzed.

“What are you smiling about? Does your face not hurt?” sneered Long Chen.

The Alldevil Heavenwalker and the Blood Fiend Devil Lord both roared furiously, practically going insane. Just as they were about to explode, the sky turned dark. A vast power enveloped them.
