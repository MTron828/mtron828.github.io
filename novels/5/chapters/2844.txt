Chapter 2833 First Meeting with the Elite Group

After the bronze furnace quivered, the lid popped open and a furnace of pills appeared before Long Chen.

There were nine pills. None of them were trash pills, but they weren’t perfectly round and they had spots on them. Those were pill defects.

This meant that the impurities had not been fully expelled from the pill. When the pill condensed, the flame power wasn’t enough to fully expel the impurities, causing them to condense on the surface of the medicinal pill.

If such pills were consumed regularly, it would be extremely harmful to the body to the point that it was necessary to consume a secondary detox liquid at the same time. Otherwise, it would harm the consumer’s foundation.

“Middle grade, with quite a bit of distance from high grade.” Long Chen couldn’t help sighing.

This pill furnace was absolutely garbage. Not only did it not help at all, but due to the crude runes, the heat distribution wasn’t even, so it required even more Spiritual Strength to maintain any heat.

Moreover, Huo Long had only just awoken and was not familiar with the laws of the Heavenly Daos of the immortal world.

The other thing was that Long Chen’s mortal qi had yet to regress, resulting in his Spiritual Strength being impure. Hence, these medicinal pills were unable to use his power to absorb the immortal spiritual qi in the air.

“No matter what, they’re ten times better than those low grade Mortal Ascension Pills that are on sale. Their quality will only increase as they expel my mortal qi, so it’s a positive cycle.” Long Chen consumed one of the pills. The medicinal pill then dissolved in his body, spreading medicinal energy that was many times more potent than those Mortal Ascension Pills that he had bought from that corrupt fatty back then.

Starting today, he could refine his own pills. He was once more stepping onto the path of cultivation.

If the Pill Institute were to learn that a lower world ascender was able to instantly refine middle grade Mortal Ascension Pills the very first time they tried, it was unknown just how many people would collapse from shock.

It had to be known that the mortal world’s laws were completely different from the laws of the immortal world. A normal ascender would need to fully expel all their mortal qi and then get used to this new world for at least a year before trying to refine pills. Even then, the chances of failure were extremely high.

That was why there were very few mortal world ascenders within the Pill Institute. The Pill Institute did not wish to spend that much time and effort to raise lower world disciples, unless those disciples had astonishing talent and potential.

“Curious. My Pill Sovereign memories didn’t have the Mortal Ascension Pill formula, but as soon as I saw the formula, I instantly knew the way to refine it and the taboos.” Long Chen was lost in thought.

The Pill Sovereign’s formulas were all from the mortal world, and Long Chen didn’t have any formulas for the immortal world. But as soon as he saw the pill formula, he seemed to recall it. It was a strange feeling. As soon as he saw it, it became familiar to him.

There was no problem with the technique, but still, no matter how amazing the alchemy art, it would still be limited by the Pill Flame, furnace, and the self.

The Pill Institute’s rules were truly a con. There were only some extremely low tier pill formulas available for free to the disciples. Anything higher level required a certain contribution or status to obtain for free.

Based on what Long Chen saw, the relationships between the disciples of the Pill Institute weren’t very good either. The disciples who could obtain higher tier pill formulas were of a different status than the lower disciples, and the former didn’t have any urge to share the formulas. All that would do was create another competitor for themselves.

It was actually not forbidden for disciples to transmit and share pill formulas. But there was no one sharing them. Instead, there was another rule… The Pill Institute did not forbid disciples from buying and selling pill formulas. Thus, all the pill formulas in the Pill Institute were Long Chen’s targets.

However, Long Chen wasn’t in a rush. Right now, everything was going in the right direction. The door was already open, so he just needed to steadily advance.

Long Chen refined five furnaces of pills before he got a bit tired. This pill furnace wasn’t easy to use, and his Pill Flame was weak. Hence, he needed to inject the spiritual qi of the world into the pill, and it was exhausting.

However, after five furnaces of pills, Long Chen’s mortal qi had been reduced. He felt much lighter and could almost feel the immortal spiritual qi in the air.

“Hehe, next time I refine pills, I might be able to refine high grade Mortal Ascension Pills.” Long Chen smiled when he sensed the change in his body.

To be able to sense the immortal spiritual qi of the air meant that his mortal qi had been sloughed off. Immortal spiritual qi was starting to welcome him, and this would make refining pills much easier.

He put away the pill furnace and told Huo Long to rest. After that, he stretched, feeling refreshed. Strength coursed through his veins.

“Instructor Long Chen, the disciples of the Elite Group have already gathered. They are awaiting your instructions.” A knock came from the door.

“Hahaha, good. Let me see just how elite these elites are.” Long Chen laughed confidently.

Right now, it was unknown just how many people viewed him as a joke over this wager. But Long Chen was not afraid. The more difficult the task, the more he wanted to do it.

When Long Chen came out the door, a disciple hastily led the way. The flying mount had been prepared. Long Chen was experiencing the treatment of an instructor and instantly felt much more comfortable.

“Instructor Long Chen, how confident are you in your wager with instructor Yun Yang?” asked the disciple bravely.

“Hm, not that much,” said Long Chen.

“How much?” The disciple pursued the topic.

“What is it?”

“Instructor Long Chen, please don’t misunderstand. This matter has caused a ruckus throughout the God Institute. I’m just benefiting from your light right now, so I was hoping to get a bit of inside information. If others ask me, I’ll be able to show off a bit,” said that disciple. His cultivation base wasn’t very high, but he was quick-witted.

“If someone asks you, tell them that I’m not too confident. I’m only one hundred percent sure,” said Long Chen with a laugh.

“A hundred percent? Are you sure? Those people are devils incarnate. They never listen to anyone. Are you being overconfident? Do you want me to explain exactly what they’re like?” asked the disciple zealously.

“No need. I’m already clear on what kind of people they are. There’s nothing impossible when it comes to me. If they make me fail, I’ll tear out their tendons and rip off their skin to use as lanterns. In any case, if they fail, not one of them should even think about getting out alive,” said Long Chen indifferently.

The disciple quivered in fear. Wasn’t that too ruthless? However, at this moment, Long Chen flew off on his mount, leaving the disciple behind.

Long Chen sat on the flying mount alone and then arrived at a mountain range. There was a valley deep inside here that Long Chen had chosen. Long Chen had made an agreement with Heaven Master Yun Yang that their drills would be forbidden for others to watch. Otherwise, it would count as Heaven Master Yun Yang’s loss.

There was a group of people swearing and shouting noisily about something when he arrived. Long Chen fell amongst them.

“You are that Long Chen?” Before he even spoke, one of those disciples side-eyed Long Chen, looking at him disdainfully.

Crack.

Long Chen reached out and wrung his neck. As a result, his body instantly collapsed, twitching, before finally coming to a stop. His aura faded away.

“He’s dead?!” All the disciples were horrified. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

Long Chen took out a handkerchief and wiped his hands with a disgusted expression. It was like wringing that person’s neck had defiled his hand.

They were deathly silent as he wiped his hands. It was only when his hands were completely clean that he looked at them as if nothing had happened.

“Sorry, my temper isn't good. When you talk to me, you should think about what kind of tone and actions to use.”

Long Chen suddenly clapped his forehead. “Oh no, what was that person saying just now? I was a bit too hasty and didn’t listen to him. I’ll trouble you to tell me what he wanted to say just now, thanks.”
