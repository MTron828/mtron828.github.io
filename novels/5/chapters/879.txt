Chapter 880 Terrifying Flame Devil

Translator: BornToBe

“Who knows... if those two... were killed by it.” Long Chen and Yue Xiaoqian rushed as fast as they could with their little energy for over two hours before finally taking a breather. After running for so long, Long Chen couldn’t even speak without gasping.

“It seems they weren’t. We ended up drawing the Flame Devil’s attention, and the two of them should have taken that chance to flee.” Yue Xiaoqian shook her head.

“Foolish girl, can’t you at least comfort me? Isn’t it fine to say that they’re already dead? Can’t you lie to make me happy for a bit?” Long Chen bitterly smiled. Yue Xiaoqian was always serious about everything.

Long Chen also knew that those two had probably survived. But if he heard some comfort, he would at least feel a bit better inside.

“Xiaoqian, what origin does that Flame Devil have? How is it so terrifying? I feel like it’s even more powerful than an eighth rank Earth Dragon,” said Long Chen.

Yue Xiaoqian explained, “The Flame Devils are rumored to come from a flame hell. In the immortal era, they flourished and broke through the spatial walls, breaking into the Martial Heaven Continent. At that time, they caused great damage to the Martial Heaven Continent. The continent’s experts were unable to stop them, and they were on the verge of being destroyed. The legends say that Immortals intervened, suppressing the Flame Devils and sealing the broken spatial wall. However, there was still a small number of Flame Devils scattered throughout the continent. Because they were too weak, they managed to escape their search.

“Later, people found the leftover Flame Devils and began killing them. But they found that Flame Devils could live for practically forever. As a result, the experts captured them and began to raise them, turning them into their pets. However, if you play with fire, you’ll get burned. They finally reaped a bitter consequence. The Flame Devils had reproduced to the point that they broke out of their control. The continent was once more bathed in blood. In the end, they managed to suppress them, and the experts of that time declared that no one could continue raising Flame Devils or they would be exterminated.

“As a result, the Flame Devils have basically become extinct on the Martial Heaven Continent. As for the Flame Devil here, I feel like it was bound by a formation and its energy was extracted to keep other formations functional. It can save plenty of resources. Flame Devils can live practically forever, so their life energy is extremely powerful. It can constantly draw energy out of the lava to live forever. My guess is there is a lava pool nearby supplying it with energy, while the formations draw out its converted energy. Your attack previously broke the formation and let it regain its freedom. Flame Devils are originally berserk, so after being enslaved for so many years and finally escaping, it naturally is full of resentment and wants to release it on us. Its power should definitely be much stronger than eighth rank Magical Beasts. But because it is bound by those divine chains, it isn’t able to release its full strength. But even so, the power it released was very likely greater than an eighth rank Magical Beast.”

“Fine, I won’t bother it. Let’s go, the huge battle just now is definitely drawing over countless people. We-” Long Chen’s expression suddenly changed. He rushed off while pulling Yue Xiaoqian.

He sensed a distant group of experts that came in their direction, seeming to be searching for something.

“Long Chen! It’s Long Chen! We’ve found him!”

That group was comprised of over a hundred people from the ancient race and Corrupt Path. Within their group, several people were carrying two stretchers.

Two charred bodies were lying on the stretchers. Their bodies were pitch-black, and if it weren’t for the blinking of their eyes, no one would be able to tell they were alive.

“Help me shout: you bastard Long Chen, you won’t be able to escape. I’ll definitely make you live a life worse than death,” croaked one of those charred bodies.

That person was Xue You. In order to survive those flames, they had used up their final bit of power. If the Flame Devil’s attention hadn’t been focused on Long Chen and Yue Xiaoqian, they would have definitely died.

Although they had escaped with their lives, they had still been burned to a coal-like state. They were unable to bear even the weakest attack now.

Fortunately, after Long Chen had drawn the Flame Devil’s attention, they had used their last bit of energy to fly out and just happened to run into experts from their side that had been drawn over by the commotion. Of course, they had also encountered some Righteous experts.

When the crowd had seen Xue You and Yu Changhao, they hadn’t been able to believe their eyes. Seeing them in their half-dead states, they were unable to connect them with the peak experts in their minds.

They hastily went to protect them. As for the Righteous experts, they hadn’t known what to do or what had happened.

After being saved, they resisted fainting. Clenching their teeth, they had ordered their people to detour around the Flame Devil and chase after Long Chen. They were sure he wasn’t much better off than them. Now was the best chance to hunt him down.

“Long Chen, you bastard, you won’t be able to escape! Lord Xue You will definitely make you live a life worse than death!” shouted a Corrupt expert.

“What kind of garbage barbeque are you sending to me? Which cook burnt it so badly? Fuck off. Just looking at those burnt lumps makes me nauseous!”

Long Chen refused to lose out. As he rushed away with Yue Xiaoqian, he shouted a loud response, causing Xue You and Yu Changhao to almost pass out from rage. He was actually treating them as barbeque?

“Long Chen, I’ll tear- PFFT!” Yu Changhao coughed up a mouthful of blood.

Both he and Xue You had already exhausted all their Heavenly Dao energy. They didn’t even have any spiritual yuan either. They were in a dreadful state.

Right now, they had no ability to heal. They first needed to use medicinal pills to recover and restore their spiritual yuan. That was an extremely slow process. And in this state, they might die to the slightest danger.

But they also knew that Long Chen was completely spent. If they didn’t kill him now, it would be much more difficult in the future. So this was a rare opportunity.

Suddenly, one of the ancient race experts shot an arrow at Long Chen.

Long Chen swung his broadsword behind him, destroying that arrow. But he was also sent flying.

“Hahaha, as expected, you really are out of energy, Long Chen! It’s hard just for you to block an ordinary attack from me!” The person who had shot the arrow was just a rank two Celestial. This arrow of his was just to test Long Chen’s state.

Right now, Long Chen was also exhausted, with his spiritual yuan drained. With just his physical strength, just raising his broadsword was taxing, let alone using Blooddrinker.

“Out of energy? You can come and try it!” sneered Long Chen, suddenly stopping.

“Fine, then let me try it!” A rank three Celestial walked out from the Corrupt path’s side, and forming hand seals, a skull appeared in front of him. He spat a mouthful of blood onto it.

A fierce, evil aura erupted from the skull. It instantly grew larger, and it shot out a ray of light at Long Chen.

Long Chen raged inside, “Fuck, I tell you to try it and you try it? I don’t see you bastards listening so obediently normally!”

Seeing that light coming at him, he knew it was a Treasure item. Although it was a heretical one, this kind of attack could easily kill him and Yue Xiaoqian in their weak state.

Yue Xiaoqian was pale. Blocking the Flame Devil’s attack in the end had already overdrafted her power slightly. She was powerless to fight.

“Blooddrinker, slaughter him!” Blooddrinker suddenly appeared. A ray of red light soared into the sky, transforming into a heavenly saber that slashed down on that light. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Long Chen was already powerless to use Blooddrinker. But it had agreed to his request and released an attack on its own. However, without Long Chen’s power supporting it, the attack was much weaker, and he could only use it once.

The Corrupt expert and the skull were blown apart by Blooddrinker. Those experts turned pale with fright, and they all stopped, not daring to get closer.

Long Chen hastily put away Blooddrinker and sneered, “Let me tell you, even if I’m out of energy, I can still use this kind of attack three times. I’ve used it once now, so whoever else wants to die can come out now.”

Long Chen was simply trying to frighten them. Although Treasure items were strong, they weren’t energy storage weapons. Without the owner putting any energy into one, being able to release one attack already made it peak grade.

He was only able to do this because he was connected mentally and spiritually to Blooddrinker. Blooddrinker was willing to offer up its energy to Long Chen. That was absolute trust. But no matter how much it trusted him, without any energy supporting it, it couldn’t help Long Chen.

“Don’t listen to him! He’s definitely just putting on airs! Such an attack can only be released once!” Xue You clearly wasn’t so easy to trick. After all, he was a peak expert, and he had a deeper understanding of Treasure items.

The others felt the same way, but they didn’t dare to take that risk. They just stayed together, chasing after him, each of them maintaining the same speed. None of them wanted to be the first to test it again. Seeing that, Long Chen sped off. If he could run into some companions, there really was a chance of getting away.

“Wu Hei, I order you to attack! You understand the consequences!” shouted Xue You. The person he had named was an ordinary rank three Celestial. Being ordered by Xue You, he was infuriated inside. But he still attacked.

This fellow was smart. He used a long-distance attack of Sword Qi. At the same time, he prepared to retreat, causing Xue You to clench his teeth. He was clearly just going through the motions without any actual power.

When that Sword Qi was about to reach Long Chen, a lightning dragon appeared and blocked the Sword Qi. But Lei Long had previously endured an attack from the terrifying Flame Devil. It was also out of energy, and it shattered.

Long Chen and Yue Xiaoqian were blown away. Yue Xiaoqian even coughed up blood. She had no defensive ability and was weaker than a rank one Celestial right now.

“Fuck, how are there none of them here?! The map clearly indicates their existence!” Long Chen was looking around constantly. Suddenly, he sensed spiritual fluctuations and his eyes brightened. Yes, it was here. He pulled Yue Xiaoqian in that direction.

After a few more miles, dozens of figures appeared. Their auras were vast like the sea, and their robes were strange. They icily stared at Long Chen and the others, their weapons raised.
