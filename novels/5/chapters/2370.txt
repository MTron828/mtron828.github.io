Chapter 2360 Good Things Come in Pairs

Translator: BornToBe

“The lid hasn’t even been opened yet, but the pill tribulation has locked onto it. Demonic pills really are special.”

Long Chen was surprised to see the tribulation clouds suddenly appear. Normally, pill tribulation only came when the lid to the furnace was opened. That was when the pill would be sensed. But the demonic pill had yet to fully form and it had already been sensed.

Thunder rumbled in the sky, and the furnace was shaking violently. Fortunately, Ling-er’s skills had grown, and the lid didn’t budge. The pill had yet to fully form, so if it charged out now, its quality would plummet.

Bang! Finally, a loud sound came from within the furnace that made Ling-er cry out in delight. “It’s done!”

Long Chen said, “Release it.”

The lid opened, and a large pill shot out. It had seven bright rings on top of it.

This was a giant pill that had condensed the energy of nine pills inside of it. It was the size of a baby’s fist.

When it shot out of the furnace, the first thing it did was charge at Long Chen.

Long Chen slapped the pill away, but he was forced back a step from the impact, his arm trembling.

“What power is that? Why is it so familiar?” Long Chen was startled.

Lightning suddenly fell from the sky, striking the giant pill. The might of the pill then erupted to another level, and it began to absorb the lightning.

With the lightning coursing through it, Long Chen saw its black and white core.

“Life and death energy. It’s the energy of the Heavenly Underworld Vermillion Fruit.”

All on its own, the giant pill began to absorb the lightning, stimulating its own potential. With the life and death energy flowing through it, it really was like a cultivator.

“Big brother Long Chen, the giant pill you refined is actually capable of cultivating!” exclaimed Ling-er.

Long Chen smiled. This was a Nethergate Pill. How could it not be strong? The stronger it was, the happier he would be.

The giant pill suddenly shuddered. It transformed into a giant python that attacked him, and its scales flashed with light.

“The Heavenly Qilin Horn Python.” This was one of the main ingredients of the Nethergate Pill. The Heavenly Qilin Horn Python opened its mouth and unleashed a wave of golden flames at him.

Long Chen allowed the flames to envelop his body. Feeling the familiar heat, he nodded. “It really is amazing. The Heavenly Qilin Horn Python’s flame was boosted by the power of the demonic pill to the point of rivaling the Heaven Incinerating Flame.”

The Heavenly Qilin Horn Python was a flame attribute Magical Beast but was only of the eleventh rank. Its flame wasn’t supposed to be this powerful, but the demonic pill allowed it to compare to the existence that was third on the Earth Flame Rankings.

Suddenly, a tail whipped through the flames at Long Chen. A sharp whistling sound made his hair stand on end.

Long Chen’s fist smashed into the tail, but he was still blown out of the flames.

“Good!” Long Chen wiped some blood from his mouth, his eyes shining. A demonic pill was truly worthy of being a legendary existence. It was capable of injuring him.

The Heavenly Qilin Horn Python suddenly roared and twisted, transforming into a wild lion that sent a claw toward him.

“The Earth Splitting Wild Lion’s essence blood. Hehe, pretty good.”

This giant pill was actually able to control the attributes of the precious ingredients that had gone into it. It was even able to unleash the divine abilities they had possessed when they were alive.

Long Chen repeatedly blocked, with the pill constantly transforming. Sometimes it would be a giant python, sometimes it would be a wild lion. Sometimes it summoned various bewitching phenomena to bewilder him. What shocked him the most was that as its life and death energy circulated, it began to copy Long Chen’s abilities.

It was like it was gaining battle experience from him. Moreover, its power continuously rose as it absorbed the lightning. It seemed that it was completely fearless toward this pill tribulation.

As its power grew, Long Chen had no choice but to take out his divine ring so that he could fight evenly against it.

“Big brother Long Chen, do you want me to suppress it?” asked Ling-er.

“No need. Let it continue growing stronger. I want to see its limit.”

This giant pill was like a cultivator going through tribulation. After two hours, the tribulation clouds scattered. Long Chen forgot to even attack the tribulation.

Once the tribulation ended, a strange mark appeared on the demonic pill.

“A Heavenly Dao rune? It has been acknowledged by the Heavenly Daos?” Long Chen was startled. Was it really so simple?

For other pills, the chances of surviving were dismal. They were not permitted to exist within the Heavenly Daos, which was why the outside world had almost no tribulation pills in existence. But this demonic pill had been let off.

After obtaining the Heavenly Dao rune, the demonic pill’s aura grew once more. Based on Long Chen’s estimate, its aura was comparable to a third step Netherpassage expert. But its actual power was even greater.

It seemed that the giant pill had set its sights on Long Chen, as though he was the one who had killed its father. It refused to allow him to live.

Long Chen knew how to refine a demonic pill, but he didn’t know much else. Ling-er knew even less.

BOOM!

Long Chen was knocked back. Even with the divine ring, he was unable to suppress it. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

The giant pill transformed into a lion and pounced over.

BANG!

A fist covered in dragon scales smashed the lion apart, revealing the true form of the giant pill.

Long Chen had been forced to summon the Azure Dragon Battle Armor. Only in this state could he suppress this giant pill.

The giant pill shuddered and manifested its lion form again, attacking once more.

Long Chen frowned. This demonic pill had a spirit, but it was too violent. It lacked any intelligence and acted purely on instinct.

“Ling-er, put it away,” called out Long Chen.

The Demon Moon Furnace shuddered. The world turned dark for just an instant before becoming bright once more. That moment felt like the Demon Moon Furnace had sucked in all of heaven and earth. The demonic pill was gone.

“Be suppressed!” Ling-er controlled the Demon Moon Furnace, having it forcibly suppress the demonic pill that was struggling crazy inside of it.

The demonic pill came flying out. Now, another rune had appeared on it. It was a sealing rune.

“Big brother Long Chen, here.” Ling-er passed it to Long Chen. Her eyes were like two shining stars when she looked at him now. Long Chen had gained another worshipper.

“Ling-er, help protect me.” Long Chen sat lotus style and consumed the pill. When it entered his stomach, he made sure to activate the Swallow the Heavens, Devour the Earth divine ability that Evilmoon had taught him. Only then did he unleash the seal.

BOOM!

When the seal was undone, the pill didn’t try to transform into a Magical Beast. Instead, it instantly exploded.

Long Chen vomited a mouthful of blood. If it weren’t for the divine ability, that detonation might have blown him apart.

“This fucking pill, did it think I was its mortal enemy?”

The demonic pill didn’t have the slightest reasoning. It had a spirit but no intelligence. Hence, Long Chen’s hopes of raising an army of demonic pills were dashed.

The Swallow the Heavens, Devour the Earth divine ability activated, absorbing the violent medicinal energy. It then surged toward the Nethergate Star.

The Nethergate Star sucked in that energy greedily. It grew at a visible rate from that energy.

“A single pill was actually able to grow the Nethergate Star to such an extent. Based on that, just ten of these will be enough for it to enter the second star transformation!”

Long Chen’s heart pounded with joy. This demonic pill might be too violent to control, but the medicinal effect was amazing.

“It’s too bad that they can’t be used as fighters.” Long Chen sighed.

“Demonic pills can be subdued.”

Just at this moment, a voice rang out in Long Chen’s mind. He jumped in shock.

“Moon and Star Refining Furnace? Is that you?”

“It’s me.”

The Moon and Star Refining Furnace replied. The voice was ancient and was indistinguishable as male or female.

“You said that demonic pills can be subdued?” exclaimed Long Chen excitedly.

“Yes. I’ve awoken and can help a bit. Thank you for your help, or I’d have died. Then my master’s wishes would never be fulfilled,” said the Moon and Star Refining Furnace.

Long Chen wanted to ask who its master was, but thinking about how the Moon and Star Refining Furnace had fought in a battle alongside a Sovereign, he held his curiosity back. Sometimes, rashly asking questions wasn’t a good thing.

The Moon and Star Refining Furnace continued, “When you refine demonic pills in the future, I can create a formation at the core to suppress its evil tenor, resulting in it having a pure spirit. However, I am still in a weak state, and to subdue a demonic pill will take a certain amount of time.”

“As long as it’s possible, it’s good. Senior, now that you’re awake, does that mean that you can automatically refine pills to recover yourself?” asked Long Chen.

“I can’t be called senior by you. You saved me, and you are my current master. You can just call me Moon Refiner.”

“Haha, in my life, this is my first time experiencing good things that come in pairs. With your help and Ling-er’s help, I won’t need to worry about refining pills again!” Long Chen laughed almost maniacally. The awakening of the Moon and Star Refining Furnace had come at a perfect time. With its help, he could refine twelfth tier medicinal pills.

Thinking of that, a fire blazed in his heart. He placed the Demon Moon Furnace in the primal chaos space. He had taught her some pill formulas and had her train for now. The Moon and Star Refining Furnace went in to help as well.

After arranging that, Long Chen returned to the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow race’s territory.

When he arrived, Que Yuzhu immediately said, “Long Chen, we were looking for you. The divine families sent word that they wish for you to take a trip to see them.”

Long Chen smiled. “It seems that the Star Field Divine World is about to be opened.”
