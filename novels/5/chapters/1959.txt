Chapter 1949: 1949

“What is it?”

Long Chen was startled . He suddenly had a bad feeling . With Zheng Wenlong’s calm demeanor, and adding on this hesitation, it probably wasn’t anything good .

“During the time that you vanished, the Xuan Beasts joined with Heavenly Fate Island to calculate the whereabouts of the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow race . I heard that the Xuan Beasts managed to take over two of their secret strongholds,” said Zheng Wenlong carefully .

Upon hearing this, Long Chen’s expression immediately turned cold . Killing intent appeared in his eyes . What was this? Unable to capture him, they had turned their blades on others?

However, the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow race was viewed as traitors by the Xuan Beasts . The two sides had a deep enmity against each other that stretched back a long time ago . The Xuan Beasts’ actions could be justified by that, but Zheng Wenlong felt differently .

“I’m afraid that the Dragon Slaughter Convention from the Grand Han will reoccur . For others, the same trap won’t work twice . But for you, Long Chen, no matter how many times they do this, it will still be effective . Your weakness is clear to others . ”

Long Chen’s weakness was that even if he knew he was sending himself to his death, he would still go if his companions were captured .

If Pill Valley was involved, they wouldn’t give him any chance to escape . So Zheng Wenlong was warning Long Chen, despite knowing that he couldn’t change what Long Chen would do . As friends, some things still had to be said .

“However, you don’t need to worry . Based on what I know, the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow race has hundreds of secret strongholds throughout the Martial Heaven Continent . As for their main headquarters, even Heavenly Fate Island is unable to find it . Most likely, it is protected by their ancestral spirits . What I’m afraid of is this matter being learned by the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow that’s with you . She might go to help, disregarding everything else, and then you’d go save her . That would once more be falling for their trap,” warned Zheng Wenlong .

Long Chen nodded . “I won’t tell Cloud about this for now . Fuck, it really is one scheme after another . Pill Valley is truly insidious . ”

“Yu Xiaoyun is a wily old fox . Many people have been tricked by him . He has been arranging things for many years, and it’s unknown how many chess pieces he has secretly set up . He is ruthless and ambitious, as well as frighteningly patient,” said Zheng Wenlong .

For the higher-ups to tell him to handle this on his own, it was clear they wanted to use Long Chen’s matter to temper him . But in the face of Yu Xiaoyun, Zheng Wenlong knew he was lacking many things .

“It shouldn’t just be this, right?” Long Chen looked at Zheng Wenlong .

Zheng Wenlong nodded . “The Xuantian Dao Sect and the Heaven Splitting Battle Sect are under tight observation . Each of their movements is under the control of Pill Valley . As for that old man of yours, he almost went berserk, wanting to kill all those people . Alliance head Qu had to personally hold him back . ”

“The old man has never lowered his head to anyone . Ugh, I ended up implicating him,” sighed Long Chen . The stubborn old man had actually held back just because of him . “Alright, I understand . Get to the real issue . ”

Zheng Wenlong was pacing around the room . It was clear he was still struggling .

“Tell me . You’re not a businessman, you’re my brother,” said Long Chen .

Zheng Wenlong bitterly smiled . “Whether it’s from a business standpoint or the standpoint of your brother, I shouldn’t say . But I know that if I don’t, you’ll hate me for the rest of your life . What I have to tell you is that Leng Yueyan is currently in trouble . She will soon be executed . ”

“What?!” Long Chen jumped up, his killing intent once more soaring .

“I knew that you wouldn’t be able to remain calm . To help you in the Yin Yang World, she heavily injured Xie Luo . As a result, that infuriated Xie Wentian, and he captured her, not giving her any chance to quibble . She’s imprisoned currently . Although Leng Yueyan is a genius whose talent and combat strength is unrivaled in the Corrupt path, and even though she is somehow capable of controlling death energy, she has no backing . Even if she’s more outstanding than Xie Luo, it’s useless . Before this, she was able to run rampant without anyone touching her because Xie Wentian wanted to raise her as Xie Luo’s Dao-companion . However, Leng Yueyan actually went against his orders and attacked Xie Luo, causing his entire plan to crumble . This time, she is going to be sacrificed to the Corrupt God at the Heavenly Evil Cave . Furthermore, her power might be stripped away and bestowed to Xie Luo . It’s unknown if Leng Yueyan is simply one of Xie Wentian’s hidden pieces that he was grooming precisely for this moment,” said Zheng Wenlong .

The leaders of the major powers on the continent were all wily . Sometimes, their moves couldn’t be understood by others, and that was what made them exceptionally frightening . They didn’t just have immense martial power but also the intelligence to back it up .

“So even the name of the Heavenly Evil Cave has been leaked? It should be intentional then,” said Long Chen, his lips curling into a disdainful smile .

“Yes, this matter is no secret . Many people on the Martial Heaven Continent know of it . If they could kill Leng Yueyan and bait you to go at the same time, it would be a spectacular victory for them . If you went, you would be falling for a trap, while if you didn’t, you would be given an infamous name as someone who didn’t go help a woman who only fell into her predicament because she saved your life . Considering Pill Valley’s skills at creating rumors, you’ll lose many supporters . So when these wily old foxes make a move, no matter what you do, they will end up winning . Despite knowing this is a trap, you will still go, right?” Zheng Wenlong looked at Long Chen .

Long Chen bitterly smiled . “If I didn’t go, I wouldn’t be Long Chen . ”

“That’s why I really didn’t know whether or not to tell you this news . Telling you might kill you, while not telling you would pain you for the rest of your life . ” Zheng Wenlong had a complicated expression, not knowing if telling Long Chen had been the right choice .

“Telling me was the right thing to do . You understand me . If you didn’t tell me, you would only be a businessman and not my brother . ” Long Chen patted Zheng Wenlong’s shoulder . ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

If he wanted to get more profit, Zheng Wenlong could act like he didn’t know so that Long Chen would be safe . If Long Chen died, his businesses would tumble . However, Zheng Wenlong had still told him .

“What do you plan to do?”

“What else can I plan to do?” Long Chen shrugged . “My plans haven’t changed . There’s no way to go faster, and the other side isn’t giving me any time . Leng Yueyan saved me twice, so I won’t just watch as she dies . I’m definitely going to go to the Heavenly Evil Cave . ”

“Then the chances of you surviving are essentially zero . You might never return...”

“Then I’ll never return . But your businesses will continue . If I die, the Dragonblood Legion will still exist . They are my brothers, and they’ll avenge me . As long as the Dragonblood Legion is present, I can die without regrets . ”

Long Chen smiled very calmly . Watching as he left, Zheng Wenlong didn’t know what he was feeling . He wanted to help Long Chen, but he didn’t know how to .

Advise him? Useless . If he listened, then he wouldn’t be Long Chen . He wouldn’t be the powerful, domineering, and unrivaled hero that he was . He also wouldn’t be the Dragonblood Legion’s boss with so many hot-blooded brothers and sisters .

...

Long Chen slowly walked out of the Huayun Pavilion, his mood heavy . He knew that his enemies weren’t giving him any time to breathe . Their schemes came one after another .

Most hateful of all, the Dragonblood Legion had not gained control of their world energy, and the majority of them did not have divine items . If a battle started, it would lead to too many casualties .

Saving Leng Yueyan but sacrificing his brothers? Unacceptable .

So Long Chen could only choose to go alone into the enemy territory with just his saber . Even if he didn’t return .

“How brazen, Long Chen! You still dare to swagger around? Face your death!”

Long Chen had just walked out of the Huayun Pavilion when a roar rang out . A Netherpassage expert wearing robes of the ancient races blocked his path .

More terrifying auras began to rise around him . These people had long since surrounded this area, just waiting for him to come out .

In truth, they hadn’t had much hope of capturing Long Chen here . The Huayun Pavilion had transportation formations inside it, and they had assumed that Long Chen would leave through there . But unexpectedly, he actually walked out just like that .

Countless figures fled from the city, afraid of being caught in the battle . Only some confident experts chose to continue floating in the sky, looking at that black-robed man that had shaken the continent .

“Long Chen really did come out! The strongest man of the Martial Heaven Continent’s junior generation, how cool!”

Two women were floating in the sky, softly whispering to each other . Based on their powerful auras and robes, they were Life Star experts from some neutral faction .

Powerful undercurrents were currently surging on the Martial Heaven Continent, so only the disciples from neutral camps dared to roam around . They could gain experience and also gather information . Even neutral factions needed to have information about the movements on the Martial Heaven Continent .

“Hmph, who said that? Who declared him the strongest man of the Martial Heaven Continent’s junior generation? What a shameless fool full of hot air . ”

Just at this moment, a young man in the sky disdainfully opened his mouth .
