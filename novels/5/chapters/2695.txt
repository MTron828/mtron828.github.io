Chapter 2684 Long Aotian’s Bloody Path

While Long Aotian still had long hair, there was a section missing on the top of his head, an island within the sea if you will.

Within this island, rainbow blood flowed out, dripping down his face. It framed his furious eyes and distorted face.

Long Aotian’s scalp had been torn off by Long Chen, or perhaps it should be said that Long Aotian had had no choice but to be a gecko cutting off his own tail in order to escape. He had sacrificed his scalp to turn the tide.

Long Chen looked at Long Aotian’s bloody scalp in his hand. He sneered, “It seems that you didn’t just take my Spirit Blood, Spirit Root, and Spirit Bone. You also took other people’s. Long Aotian, you really are a mixed breed. Your current achievements are the result of piling up other people’s talent. I’m curious, just how many geniuses did your despicable daddy and mommy ruin to create you?”

Only now did Long Chen realize that Long Aotian’s essence blood was extremely mixed. There were various kinds of marvelous energy and not just Long Chen’s essence blood inside it. Some weren’t even human.

It was no wonder that Long Aotian’s aura was so strange when he unleashed it. Originally, Long Chen had thought that it was due to Long Aotian inheriting his mother’s aura, but now he saw that Long Aotian had absorbed countless Spirit Roots, Spirit Bones, and Spirit Bloods. Long Chen was just one of them.

At the same time, Long Chen understood why his divine Spirit Root had been degraded to a Supreme Bone. It was due to being infected by countless pieces of trash.

Long Chen guessed that Long Aotian was unable to control a divine Spirit Bone, so he had been given other kinds of energy to suppress it, causing its tier to drop.

Upon hearing Long Chen’s words, an uproar occurred on the Martial Heaven Continent’s side. Quite a few people were especially emotional and cursed Long Aotian.

“Long Aotian, you bastard, was my child stolen by you?!”

“My daughter was only a few days old when she was stolen. Was this done by you? Where is she?!” shouted a woman.

“My grandson wasn’t even a year old before he was taken. Was this done by the divine families?!” raged an old man, brandishing a giant blade.

Countless people cursed Long Aotian and the Long family’s people. Without exception, those people were behemoths in their own right. Moreover, they had one similarity, and that was the fact that inherently talented babies had been born into their families, and they had been taken by others shortly after their birth. These events all occurred at around the same time.

Due to how large these powers were, they had viewed this as a familial shame, as other powers wouldn’t dare to do such a despicable thing to them. Thus, they were quite sure that it was done by a fellow member of the family as part of an internal squabble.

A few also blamed their enemies and refused to believe their denials, resulting in torrents of blood. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

It was like a fuse had been lit, and those matters were now exposed. Although people weren’t sure about the veracity of Long Chen’s words, this sensitive topic made them exceptionally emotional.

The Long family and even the other divine families were shaken. There were hundreds of families cursing them now.

“Don’t listen to Long Chen’s bullshit! Would our Long family do such a thing?” shouted Long Qifeng, refusing to admit to it.

“Fuck your mom, even Long Chen’s Spirit Root, Spirit Blood, and Spirit Bone were taken by you! You even harmed your own family’s baby, so who says that you wouldn’t do that to others?!” roared others.

“Ants, shut up! If you have any proof, then come to the Long family! If you don’t, then shut your dog mouths. The divine families and the Long family can’t be blasphemed by ants like you!” sneered Long Aotian’s mother.

She was even more direct, demanding proof. But who could have proof? That was telling everyone that these two refused to admit it, and that no one could do anything about it. This infuriated everyone.

“As expected, the father and mother birthed the same kind of vile spawn as themselves. Long Aotian, countless innocent people’s blood flows through your veins. Are you not afraid of their vengeance?!” Even Beitang Rushuang couldn’t hold back from cursing him. She had never encountered such a shameless family.

“Long Aotian, I curse you to have a terrible death! I curse you to die today…”

“Long Aotian, you trash, how do you have the shamelessness to continue living in this world? Just end it yourself!”

“Exactly, your face was already slapped twice, and your scalp was torn off. You’re already bald. You should just smash your head in and end it.”

“Don’t forget to get a good reference first though. Bring your mom and dad with you and you can all kill yourselves. People like you should have never been born in this world.”

Countless people’s bloody hatred filled the air, and the most vicious curses fell upon Long Aotian’s family. Although there was no proof that those children that had suddenly vanished back in that year were related to them, based on Long Chen’s origin and Long Aotian’s family’s attitudes, people were sure it was them. If it weren’t for their apprehension toward the divine families, these people would have charged forward for vengeance for their killed babies.

“Shut up!” Long Aotian suddenly roared, his voice backed by nine dragon roars. He had gone insane, as his secret had been exposed by Long Chen, turning him into the target of everyone’s hatred and scorn.

Right now, his face was covered in blood and twisted with rage, looking like a malicious spirit. Seeing the shocked and infuriated Long Aotian, Long Chen felt great content. After that, he extended his hand.

Flames burst into existence, incinerating Long Aotian’s scalp and hair. Then a rainbow flame seed appeared with countless runes flowing inside it before it was all incinerated.

Once that was done, Long Chen rested Evilmoon on his shoulder. “You are just trash. No matter how many resources are piled into your body, it’s still useless. My own Spirit Blood, Spirit Root, and Spirit Bone have degraded in your body. Did you not realize? Debts must be repaid sooner or later. I won’t bother you with taking other people’s things, but since you’ve taken mine, I’ll be taking it back with a thousand times the price.”

Long Chen suddenly vanished. Hence, Long Aotian was startled and hastily swung his dragon spear above him.

Just at that moment, a crack split open in the void, and a black-robed Long Chen came out like a merciless death god, slashing his saber.

BOOM!

After a powerful explosion, both of their figures vanished from the sky.
