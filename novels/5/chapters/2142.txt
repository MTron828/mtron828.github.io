Chapter 2132 Exploring the Wilds

“Long Chen... we can’t...”

Yue Xiaoqian suddenly pushed Long Chen away because his hands had started to wander. Yue Xiaoqian was red in the face, but she did her best to stay cool-headed, pulling away from Long Chen’s devil claws.

“Ah... I lost control a bit...” Long Chen was also a bit red. It was only supposed to be a hug and kiss, but then his hands had started moving.

Yue Xiaoqian was as red as an apple. She looked down, tidying her clothes. Stealthily looking up and seeing Long Chen’s embarrassed expression, she quietly said, “Big sisters Meng Qi and Chu Yao knew you first. I... I can’t...”

Yue Xiaoqian meant that she couldn’t let Long Chen touch her like that, or she would be letting down her big sisters. Although they were all cultivators, and having multiple women sharing a husband wasn’t rare, the cultivation world did care about the matter of bigger or smaller. If Yue Xiaoqian did do something secretly with Long Chen, that would definitely create a fracture with the others. That was also why despite having opportunities, Meng Qi, Tang Wan-er, and Chu Yao also hadn’t done anything.

Although amongst cultivators, the ranking of bigger or smaller wasn’t taken too seriously, there were still some taboo things.

“I’m the one letting you down...” Long Chen was immediately ashamed.

“Long Chen, don’t talk that way!” cried Yue Xiaoqian. She thought that he was blaming himself for not giving her an exact place amongst those ‘rankings’ of bigger to smaller.

In truth, what he was ashamed about was how Meng Qi, Chu Yao, Tang Wan-er, and Yue Xiaoqian had managed to resist temptation due to their sisterly promise, while he... had ended up losing his virginity. Just thinking about it angered him.

However, whenever he thought about that, he also had to force himself to remain cool as two perfectly beautiful bodies appeared in his mind.

Yue Xiaoqian and the one who looked the exact same as her. The relationships between them and himself could be described as melodramatic. When he thought about that matter, he felt like his head was about to split open.

He was deeply worried for Leng Yueyan but also worried for himself. Leng Yueyan was just a clone of a god. But after what he had done to that god, would that god take vengeance?

“How is Wilde?” Long Chen took a deep breath and pushed those matters aside. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

“Wilde’s doing very well. He goes hunting every day, and we have people keeping an eye on him to make sure he doesn’t get lost again. Let’s go see him. It’s been a while since I went to see him.” Yue Xiaoqian wrapped an arm around Long Chen’s elbow, smiling sweetly once more.

Although nothing substantial occurred between them just now, after that kiss, Yue Xiaoqian became more cheerful.

“Xiaoqian, you can return with me this time. Meng Qi, Chu Yao, and the others miss you. The Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow race’s territory is already established, and no one will make things hard on you there,” said Long Chen.

“Hehe, even if I left the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow race’s territory, it would be fine. I’ve already mastered the Profound Spirit Dao Scripture. I can disguise myself perfectly and even my power as a member of the original devil race. I’ve managed to merge that power with the Heavenly Dao energy, so no one would be able to tell my identity.” Yue Xiaoqian smiled brightly.

“Really? That scripture’s pretty amazing.” Long Chen was startled. He hadn’t expected the scripture to also possess such a power. “Then can others cultivate that scripture as well?”

Yue Xiaoqian shook her head. “No. The Profound Spirit Dao Scripture is special. I did my best to teach it to others, but they were unable to comprehend it. Later, my mother told me that this scripture can only be passed on through inheritances. I could only learn it because the senior in that immortal cave blessed me, giving me that inheritance. My mother said that this scripture can only be possessed by one person at any time. If I did pass it on, I wouldn’t be able to cultivate it any longer.”

“That’s too bad. But now the two of us can go anywhere together.” Long Chen was happy that Yue Xiaoqian no longer needed to hide herself on the continent. Seeing that he looked even happier than she was, Yue Xiaoqian leaned against his shoulder, smiling.

The two of them were walking when they heard an angry roar in the distance. That roar had just rung out before a loud bang cut it off. The roar faded away.

Long Chen immediately rushed over in that direction. After passing two mountains, he saw a bear lying on the ground, its head crushed. A river of blood flowed out of it.

That was a twelfth rank Magical beast, and it was still emitting a powerful pressure. Its black fur was shiny, and it actually had scales on its legs. This was an ancient species with immense power.

In front of the bear was Wilde. He was squatting down, preparing a stove.

That stove was a divine item that Guo Ran had made for him. This stove didn’t need Wilde to control it with his spiritual yuan. It was powered by spirit crystals.

Wilde was clumsily packing one spirit crystal after another in the outer notches of the stove. The stove began unleashing a powerful flame.

Wilde tossed the bear onto the stove. The stove unleashed a wave of runes that made the bear shrink until it was just a few feet long. It began to spin on top of the stove.

Wilde squatted by the stove, waiting with anticipation. He was even drooling. Long Chen couldn’t help laughing, feeling a burst of warmth. This brother of his remained the same pure child as when he had first met him.

“Wilde, is that enough for you to eat?” Long Chen walked over. Due to how focused Wilde was on the meat, he hadn’t noticed Long Chen and Yue Xiaoqian.

Hearing that voice, Wilde’s whole body shook. “Big brother Long!”

Wilde cried and charged out, hugging Long Chen.

The earth shook intensely. Although Long Chen had been prepared, he was still squeezed so tightly that his chest hurt.

Wilde’s power had grown once more. His physical strength was alarming. If it was Gu Yang getting hugged, he would cough up blood. Someone else would simply be crushed.

“Brother Long, I missed you. Why did you only come now?” Wilde was sobbing, large tears squeezing out of his eyes.

Last time he had been lost, he had thought that he might never see Long Chen again. These days, he saw disciples of the original devil race all the time but never his big brother Long. He was starting to get worried that those disciples had gotten lost like him and that he wouldn’t see Long Chen again.

“Good brother, it was my fault. This time, I’ll bring you out to play. How are your rations? Have you prepared enough?” asked Long Chen.

“There aren’t as many Magical Beasts anymore. Sometimes I have to run very far just to find one, but the brothers and sisters of the original devil race won’t let me go any farther. I’ve only managed to stock up two months of rations. Take a look, brother Long.”

Wilde handed Long Chen his spatial ring. Long Chen checked inside it and gasped.

There were hundreds of Magical Beasts inside, with every single one being a twelfth rank Magical Beast. Seeing so many of them was shocking.

Furthermore, he saw that these Magical Beasts were not ordinary twelfth rank Magical Beasts, but especially powerful ones amongst twelfth rank Magical Beasts. Some of them could match third step Netherpasage experts.

These Magical Beasts had all been killed by Wilde. Long Chen couldn’t help gasping because he saw that these Magical Beasts had been killed in just one blow.

“To store up more, I’ve been saving them, not eating too much. Since you’re here though, we can eat two!” said Wilde.

Long Chen laughed. Was this fellow treating him? But how much could he eat?

He couldn’t help feeling sorry for this big oaf. He knew that Wilde hated being hungry more than anything else.

To store up food, he was going hungry. That was the worst for him. Although Long Chen suspected the celebratory feast today was more for filling his stomach than treating him and Yue Xiaoqian, Long Chen happily accepted it.

Long Chen picked out a scorpion. The meat inside a scorpion’s pincers was the best.

Just one pincer was as big as a boat. Long Chen and Yue Xiaoqian couldn’t possibly eat that much. But to give Wilde an excuse to eat, they definitely had to eat some.

Long Chen also cooked up some of his Scarlet Blood Spirit Fish. He directly used the Inverse Dao Water Spirit Flame to finish the cooking very quickly.

As for Wilde, he didn’t care about flavor. As long as the meat had energy in it, he gulped it down. The speed at which he ate was frightening. Long Chen and Yue Xiaoqian hadn’t even finished one fish before the scorpion was finished. There were still bones left from the bear, but Wilde even ate the scorpion’s carapace.

After eating, Wilde wiped his mouth, looking like he wanted to eat more. Long Chen and Yue Xiaoqian were speechless.

After they finished eating, Long Chen stood up. “Let’s go. We’ll go investigate deeper and see if we can find some more food for Wilde.”

Yue Xiaoqian’s expression changed. “Isn’t that too dangerous?”
