Chapter 3511

“You’ve drunk the Wine God Palace’s wine before?” Yu Qingxuan looked at Long Chen in amazement. Then she realized that the question she asked was inappropriate, and she hastily said, “Sorry, I don’t have any other intention. It’s just that this is my first time drinking the Wine God Palace’s wine.”

Yu Qingxuan was afraid that Long Chen would think that she was looking down on him and didn’t believe his words, so she hastily apologized.

Long Chen smiled. “It’s fine. In the mortal world, I was fortunate enough to try the Wine God Palace’s wine. Thus, I could guess that this should be their wine. It seems that I managed to guess right.”

“The Wine God Palace’s wine isn’t sold. For you to be able to drink it, you couldn’t be an ordinary person,” praised Yu Qingxuan.

“You overpraise me. Back then, a few seniors of the Wine God Palace favored me and gave me the chance to judge some of the Wine God Palace’s wares. It was all thanks to those seniors thinking highly of me. In truth, I don’t have any ability,” said Long Chen modestly.

Yu Qingxuan smiled. The feeling that Long Chen gave her was always different from everyone else. Others were doing their best to show off in front of her, but he was always trying to make himself seem ordinary.

However, could an ordinary person obtain the Heavenly Rainbow Flame? Could an ordinary person be invited to taste the Wine God Palace’s wines?

It had to be known that even throughout all the nine heavens and ten lands, the Wine God Palace was a famous existence. Although they did not interact much with the rest of the world, focusing instead only on making wine, they were famous for being icily arrogant. Their wine was only bestowed to those who knew wine.

There was no wine from the Wine God Palace available on the market. If anyone dared to sell it, then the Wine God Palace would trace the seller to the source and would never bestow wine to that person ever again.

Thus, the Wine God Palace’s wine could be given, but it could not have the slightest relationship to money. Otherwise, it would be viewed as a kind of blasphemy toward wine.

As a result, even with Yu Qingxuan’s illustrious status, she had never had a chance to try the Wine God Palace’s wine. But Long Chen was able to recognize the origin of this wine. How could she not be shocked?

Furthermore, the more he said that he was ordinary, the more she felt that he was extraordinary. He was just like his clothes. No one knew what was hidden within that endless darkness. It made people feel incomparably curious.

“You judged them?”

Someone snickered and didn’t say anything else. Clearly, they thought that Long Chen was bragging.

Being invited to drink the Wine God Palace’s wine was a huge honor. Who dared to judge them? They felt that Long Chen was bragging to the point that he was only embarrassing himself.

Long Chen simply smiled and didn’t reply to this snickering. He continued drinking and eating. It truly had been a long time since he had eaten such delicacies. Furthermore, these people’s burning and stifled expressions made his mood very good, improving his appetite.

Everyone continued to eat and drink, while Feng Xiang and the others repeatedly raised toasts to Yu Qingxuan. As a result, Yu Qingxuan made an excuse of not having good tolerance to avoid them. Everyone found that despite immersing himself in eating, Long Chen still drew most of Yu Qingxuan’s attention. Her gaze would occasionally look over casually, but everyone found that she seemed to have started paying special attention to him.

That made them all very irritated. In order to welcome Yu Qingxuan, they had long since made preparations and spent a huge amount of time and effort just to satisfy her. But she just kept looking at this poor little fellow.

Furthermore, this poor little fellow seemed entirely unaware. He was picking out the most delicious food for himself. It was like he hadn’t eaten for eight lifetimes. Furthermore, he drank in gulps, so unrestrained like he was the owner. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

When his cup was empty, he didn’t stand on courtesy. He directly called out an attendant beside him who filled his cup. Just watching him act this way aggrieved and infuriated Feng Xiang.

Most loathsome of all, every time they raised a toast to Yu Qingxuan, she would refuse. But when Long Chen did the same, she wouldn’t. Although she only took a light sip, it still made them feel terrible.

Every time she drank, she would ask him a few questions, and Long Chen’s answers were very humorous. He would manage to elicit some laughter from her every now and then. The others didn’t know what kind of feeling they had now, but they felt more like accompanying guests.

Finally, these people stealthily cast special gazes at each other. Feng Xiang smiled slightly. “Long Chen, you said that in the mortal world, you judged the Wine God Palace’s wine. Why don’t you judge this jug of wine as well? Let us gain some experience.”

Yu Qingxuan also looked at Long Chen, and her expression was one of expectation. She was very curious about Long Chen, but due to her reserved nature, she felt too embarrassed to ask him too much. Now, there was a chance for her to learn some more about him, so she immediately listened attentively.

While looking at Feng Xiang and the others, Long Chen slowly wiped a towel across his face. He then turned to Yu Qingxuan. “Since fairy Qingxuan is interested, I will embarrass myself. I looked at the wine jug just before. It says Pear Flower Wine. However, in truth, it is a kind of hundred-flower wine. Furthermore, hundred-flower wine is not precisely made from a hundred types of flowers. It comes in two numbers: one is ninety-nine, and the other is one hundred and twenty-eight. This Pear Flower Wine is the latter. Other than the Raging Flame Pear Flower, there are one hundred and twenty-seven other fire attribute flowers that went into its making. Based on the five elements of food: cold, cool, neutral, warm, and hot, the pear flower is of the cool attribute, lowering the heat and moistening the throat. This bit of coolness gives the other flowers their dry character. Thus, when the wine passes through the teeth, it is burning hot like lava, but as it flows down the throat, it is cool and refreshing. In the stomach, coolness and hotness mix. The heat pours through the four limbs and hundred bones, while the trace of coolness settles around the Dantian to protect it. It then slowly melts, becoming a formless qi that enters the mind-sea and nourishes the soul.”

“Wow, how amazing! You actually know so much! Furthermore, it really is exactly as you say when I drink the wine,” praised Yu Qingxuan, her eyes exceptionally bright.

Long Chen smiled. “Regretfully, while the wine is good, you cannot drink much of it.”

“Why is that?” asked Yu Qingxuan in surprise.

“This wine was made by a man. Man is like the heavens, Yang. They naturally need this coolness to avoid the fire growing too hot. A woman is like the earth, Yin. When the wine enters the body, the cool qi will mix with the Yin qi inside a woman’s body, resulting in cold and hot clashing, Yin and Yang attacking each other. Thus, fairy Qingxuan, it would be good for you to not drink too much of this Pear Flower Wine. When Yin and Yang are in harmony, your qi and blood flow smoothly. But if you drink too much, it will harm you, resulting in an imbalance of Yin and Yang. That’s why despite knowing how precious this wine is, you instinctively didn’t drink too much of it,” explained Long Chen.

“So that’s the case.” Yu Qingxuan came to a sudden understanding. She had previously felt that this wine was delicious, and it was a rare opportunity to get to drink it. But for some reason, she didn’t want to drink too much. Now that Long Chen said this, she instantly understood. She looked at him with even greater admiration.

As for Feng Xiang and the others, at first, they thought that he was bragging, and they wanted to embarrass him. However, they hadn’t expected Long Chen to explain it so perfectly to Yu Qingxuan that she was further impressed with him. They grew even more vexed now.

“I wonder if this wine has any flaws in your eyes?” Zhao Mingxuan looked at Long Chen.

Long Chen looked back and sneered. Did this fellow want to con him? He had been precisely waiting for this.

“This wine truly does have a flaw that is not minor.”

When he said this, Yu Qingxuan was shocked but the others smiled sinisterly.
