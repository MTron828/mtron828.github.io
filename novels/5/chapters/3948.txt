Chapter 3937 Refining Kunpeng Wings

“Yu Xiaoyun! He is Yu Qingxuan’s father. You don’t even know this?” asked Xia Guhong in surprise. He thought that Long Chen would have long since inquired about such things.

Yu Qingxuan’s name hadn’t changed after reincarnating, and her father’s name was also Yu Xiaoyun? Was it the same person as the Pill Valley’s master, Yu Xiaoyun?

However, that didn’t make sense. Yu Xiaoyun hadn’t died in that final battle, and the dragon expert had saved all the survivors of the Martial Heaven Continent. So, there was no way that Yu Xiaoyun had reincarnated. When Long Chen thought of that, he relaxed slightly.

It was a coincidence. It had to be. Long Chen asked, “Big brother, what kind of person is Yu Xiaoyun?”

“He’s a strategist, but he is also very stubborn and has an explosive temper. As the emperor of the Vermilion Bird Empire, he is supported by the karmic luck of the entire Vermilion Bird Empire, so he is incredibly powerful. However, despite being very wise, he is so obstinate that without his two empresses assisting him, the entire Vermilion Bird Empire would probably be severely wounded due to him.”

Although Xia Guhong’s tone was polite, it was not difficult to tell from his evaluation that as a fellow ruler of a nation, Xia Guhong didn’t have that high of an opinion of Yu Xiaoyun.

“In other words, he’s a straw bag that relies entirely on his wives to run his empire?” probed Long Chen.

“You did not hear that from me,” said Xia Guhong.

The two looked at each other and suddenly laughed. Although Xia Guhong had not said it, the meaning was already clear.

If Yu Xiaoyun was not the main problem, Long Chen had even greater confidence. So it was up to his mother-in-law? He had ways for that.

As for the rest, Long Chen didn’t bother asking about it. If he did, others would think that he was afraid.

After he asked Xia Guhong about the aftermath of the three thousand worlds, Xia Guhong said, “You killed the experts of multiple powers, so those powers are now encouraging their most outstanding disciples to make killing you their goal. Some peak geniuses are already getting restless. I should warn you that anyone who dares to challenge you will definitely not be weaker than Shi Yang, Ji Wuming, and the Nine Underworld Luocha. They will at least be at that level. I heard that Kun Tu has gone to the Kunpeng race’s ancestral lands and made a grand sacrificial ceremony for his ancestors. You should be careful. For you to humiliate the Kunpeng race like this, they will not leave things as they are. You also left behind Weng Tianyao, and after returning to the Violet Thunderclap Empire, Weng Taibei arranged for him to enter seclusion. It is probably a trial to make him even stronger. Based on what I know, while Weng Taibei is very fond of this descendant of his, he has never taught him his true skills. It’s because he wanted to see how far Weng Tianyao could go with his own abilities. But this time, Weng Taibei is transmitting his life’s learning to Weng Tianyao. His thunderforce is very powerful, so don’t be careless.”

When Xia Guhong brought up his old rival, Weng Taibei, he grew solemn. Even in the battle after the three thousand worlds, Weng Taibei had not displayed his true abilities. Everything had only been probing blows.

Clearly, this old enemy of his was hiding many powerful techniques that he didn’t wish to expose.

“Big brother, don’t worry. I will not view any enemy lightly.” Long Chen nodded.

After chatting a bit more about the current situation, to use Xia Guhong’s words, the current Long Chen had been pushed to the heart of the storm. Many people wanted to kill him.

In particular, Xia Guhong warned Long Chen to be careful of Enpuda, an expert assassin who used schemes and lay in the dark. Having killed his most cherished disciple, Long Chen would surely be his target.

Unlike Liao Bencang, Enpuda would not attack lightly. But when he did, it would be a killing blow.

Based on Xia Guhong’s understanding, Enpuda had not truly used his killing blows against Long Chen. Had he employed them, Long Chen wouldn’t have lasted a single exchange.

Enpuda had two motives for adopting this approach: one was to test Long Chen’s power, and the other one was to force Xia Guhong into saving Long Chen, using Long Chen’s weakness to provoke Xia Guhong into revealing his true power.

This led to Xia Guhong slaying one of the elders of the Alldevil race. Enpuda was the one in command, controlling the tempo of the battlefield and constantly probing Xia Guhong and Long Chen’s weaknesses.

Although Enpuda retreated in the end, Xia Guhong was worried that Enpuda might have used those attacks to figure out Long Chen’s true power so that he could set up a sure-kill trap for Long Chen next time.

“Be careful. This time, he might even use his true body to subdue you,” warned Xia Guhong.

“Last time, it wasn’t his true body?” Long Chen was startled.

“Of course not. Liao Bencang also didn’t come in his true body, or his three flowers wouldn’t have looked like that. Although they are still World Kings, they are god cultivators and have accumulated faith energy for countless years. Once their true bodies use the three flowers, their true power is not at all inferior to my own,” said Xia Guhong.

Long Chen was speechless. Enpuda was actually so powerful? Although Long Chen didn’t look down on him, he had underestimated Enpuda’s power.

“Against Liao Bencang, you’ll still be able to run. He’s brainless and attacks without thinking about it. Despite knowing all kinds of assassination techniques, his character does not suit the path of an assassin. He calls himself the master of assassination arts, but in truth, his assassination arts are very average. If he walked a different path, his accomplishments would definitely be higher. Thus, I’m not worried about Liao Bencang. It’s only Enpuda. He will set up a huge trap before he makes his move so that you can’t run. Once you notice any signs of a trap, you have to immediately run. Otherwise, by the time you see the full trap, it’ll be too late,” said Xia Guhong.

Long Chen nodded. Enpuda was truly sinister. After thinking for a bit, Long Chen suddenly asked, “Big brother, do you know Ye Wusheng?”VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

“Of course. The Silence of the Night, Ye Wusheng. She is the true queen of assassins in the nine heavens and ten lands. She has never lost. People who she wants to assassinate don’t even get a chance to flee,” said Xia Guhong with a touch of admiration. It seemed he actually had quite a high opinion of her.

“I heard that Enpuda’s true body doesn’t dare to appear because he is hiding from Ye Wusheng. Will he take the risk to come out to kill me?” asked Long Chen.

“That is the rumor. Ye Wusheng did say that as long as Enpuda came out into the nine heavens, she would cut off his head. After that, Enpuda’s true body never revealed itself. As for Ye Wusheng, she disdains hunting down his clones, so Enpuda is still able to move throughout the world with his clones. But you should not be careless. Enpuda has a secret technique. Under special conditions, his true body can instantly switch places with his clone. His true body will only take a second to kill you. Although Enpuda doesn’t dare to walk openly with his true body, that doesn’t mean that his true body is truly locked down,” said Xia Guhong.

“So that’s the case. Junior brother understands.” After asking a few more questions, Long Chen left Xia Guhong’s residence. His expression tightened. “That damn fatty really is a thorn in my flesh. His most frightening aspect is how shameless he is. No status, position, or seniority can restrict him. He has no limits for how low he can sink! No, I need to wait a few more days. I’ll prepare another trump card.”

Long Chen entered seclusion and took out a pair of wings that was flowing with divine light. They were Kun Tu’s wings. Seeing them, Long Chen smiled sinisterly.

“I might not be able to beat you, but I can slap you in the face and run. Hehe, you aren’t able to factor this pair of wings into your schemes, are you?”
