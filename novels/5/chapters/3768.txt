Chapter 3757 Heavenly River Blood Sea

“Boss, where are we going?”

Up in the sky, Long Chen and Jiang Lei were surrounded by lightning that formed the figure of a Lightning Falcon. They sped through the air rapidly.

As Jiang Lei was a lightning attribute cultivator, Long Chen had transmitted the secret arts of the Lightning Falcon race to him. Moreover, because Jiang Lei’s compatibility with the lightning element was extremely high and he was smart, under Long Chen’s guidance, he quickly mastered the secret arts.

“I don’t have any direction right now. I’m just waiting for some news, but it still hasn’t appeared yet,” said Long Chen as he flew through the air.

He was waiting for the dragon expert to give him direction. But it had been over ten days in the three thousand worlds, and it hadn’t communicated with him.

Most importantly, his time was very precious. He couldn’t waste it. If he couldn’t communicate with it, he would have to think of a way to strengthen himself in preparation for his tribulation.

Right now, his cultivation base was at the peak of the twelfth Heavenstage. He was preparing to break through to the Immortal King realm.

However, his Violet Tower Star was still lacking the final step to reach completion. He would only dare to make his breakthrough once the Violet Tower Star was fully condensed.

He didn’t have the slightest assurance for his Immortal King tribulation. As his cultivation base grew, his heavenly tribulations grew even more terrifying and monstrous. He had to be overwhelmingly prepared for it.

Right now, his Violet Tower Star was one step from completion, but he was holding back a portion of energy to prevent it from doing so.

That was because he had a premonition that as soon as it was complete, his cultivation base would automatically break through. That would instantly start his tribulation.

Hence, right now, he was waiting. He wanted to gain the dragon king essence blood first. That way, he would have another life-saving trump card, and this monstrous tribulation of his should be somewhat doable.

However, even now, the dragon expert had not told him anything. As a result, Long Chen was starting to get impatient.

“I haven’t told you anything because I’m calculating some things.” Just at this moment, the dragon expert’s voice rang out in Long Chen’s mind.

Long Chen was delighted. “Senior, where is your dragon scale? I’ll get it right now.”

“How could it be so easy? Without entering the Immortal King realm, it’s impossible for you to reach that place, let alone subdue the will of my essence blood. The current you should immediately go to the Heavenly River Blood Sea. The Heavenly Daos are on the verge of bursting there. In around one month, it will unleash primal chaos qi, and it will become the best place for powerful cultivators to undergo their tribulations during this opening of the three thousand worlds. But you should be prepared. Anyone with a powerful physical body will immediately rush there upon hearing word of it. Countless people might die there even before the tribulations start,” said the dragon expert.

“The Heavenly River Blood Sea? Isn’t that a forbidden area under the control of the demonic beast race?” Long Chen was startled. Also, that place was extremely far.

“Yes. The demonic beast race has occupied it for themselves. All the demonic beast experts within the three thousand worlds will go there and prevent outsiders from entering. However, the core area of the Heavenly River Blood Sea will not allow experts above Immortal Kings from entering. As long as you can break through their blockade, they will not be able to do anything to you. My dragon scale is not so easy to obtain. Without immense power, even if I gave you my dragon scale, you would be unable to subdue it. So entering the Heavenly River Blood Sea for your tribulation is your only option. If you can survive, I’ll tell you where my dragon scale is.” After saying that, the dragon expert’s voice faded away.

“The Heavenly River Blood Sea? Even if it’s a den of dragons, I’ll risk it.” Long Chen clenched his fists. His blood heated up. He knew that the dragon expert was giving him a trial.

He then stopped and took out the map. Looking at the location of the Heavenly River Blood Sea, he saw that it was marked as a blood-colored sun, and countless rivers in the surroundings flowed into it. It was like a drop of blood that had fallen from high above, leaving streaks from its splashing. It was quite malevolent-looking.

When Long Chen checked the distance, he gasped. The three thousand worlds were truly enormous. If he wanted to get to the Heavenly River Blood Sea, he would need to cross the majority of the map.

The biggest headache was that there was a large empty area to cross. However, that area was forbidden to the human race, and there were no human settlements there, only countless dangerous areas. There was no way to cross that place.

Seeing the large forbidden area, Long Chen was enraged. Those areas were occupied by other races, and thus called forbidden areas, as it was forbidden for the human race to set foot there.

But on the other hand, the human race’s territory could be freely crossed by those other races. In fact, the human race would smile at them as their territories were crossed. Thinking of this, Long Chen was enraged.

“Boss, that’s where you want to go?” Seeing that Long Chen had taken out the map and was constantly estimating the distance to one spot, Jiang Lei spoke up.

“Yes. But crossing this area is impossible. Even if we slaughter our way through, there’s too much land to cross and too many blockades. We’ll just be wasting our time. We’ll have to go around, and I’m looking for a path. But those large cities have the eyes of the Sacred Pill Hall there, so we might run into them if we go there. It’s irritating,” said Long Chen darkly.

Due to Bing Po, Long Chen was definitely being chased by the Sacred Pill Hall. They would do anything to reclaim her before she recovered. They had to be panicked and in a rush to find her as soon as possible. Hence, Long Chen didn’t dare to take that risk.

“Oh, this region…!”

Long Chen suddenly saw a green area, and his eyes lit up. That was the Spirit race’s holy land.

It was a long and narrow strip of land according to the maps. If they passed through that region, it would save them quite a bit of time. Even if they didn’t use transportation formations and just flew at full speed, with the usage of the ultra transportation formation discs that Xia Chen had prepared for him, it should be possible for them to reach the Heavenly River Blood Sea within one month.

“Let’s go!”

After deciding, Long Chen didn’t hesitate. He and Jiang Lei directly transformed into a Lightning Falcon and flew away. They were like shooting stars.

Three days later, the surrounding mountains and plains vanished, replaced with an unending forest. The terrain was even. Auspicious and peaceful sunlight filtered through the green leaves. Although the forest was dim, it didn’t give off an oppressive feeling. Instead, it felt very warm.

As soon as they arrived, the forest reacted to their arrival. The trees then began to move according to a strange rhythm.

Suddenly, arrows shot out from the trees. Their sharp auras directly pierced the void.

“Boss!” Jiang Lei cried out.

“Don’t counterattack! Just block.”

Long Chen was also startled. He didn’t know what was going on. He only saw that they were wooden arrows.

“Tree demons?”

Long Chen extended his hand, summoning a lightning shield. Those wooden arrows were blasted apart upon contact.Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

He shouted, “I am Long Chen! I am friends with the Spirit race and have no malice! I simply want to borrow your land to pass through. Friends of the Spirit race, please help me out.”

His voice transmitted far and wide. Echoes rang out through the trees.

“Liar! You’re in the same group as those bad people! We don’t welcome you. Leave!”

Suddenly, a tender voice rang out from the trees. Long Chen then saw two little girls looking to only be seven or eight years old. They walked out of the trees, glaring at Long Chen with hostility.
