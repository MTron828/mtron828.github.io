Chapter 4038 Unrivaled Dong Mingyu

“Boss, we came late!”

The group to come was led by Guo Ran and Xia Chen, and they had over four hundred Dragonblood warriors with them.

During this time, Long Chen had left a mission for the two of them to gather all the Dragonblood warriors in the Violet Flame Heaven.

When the Dragonblood warriors gathered in the three thousand worlds, Xia Chen and Guo Ran noted that over three hundred of them actually came from the Violet Flame Heaven. Since they knew where their sects and locations were, they reunited directly.

However, even if the two of them knew where they were, most of them were still scattered throughout every corner of the land. Thus, it took all this time just to find four hundred and thirty Dragonblood warriors.

Perhaps there were still a few other Dragonblood warriors left in the Violet Flame Heaven. But the Violet Flame Heaven was enormous, so in the end, they could only settle for gathering this many.

After gathering the Dragonblood warriors, Guo Ran and Xia Chen distributed the Heavenly Dao Fruit to them, as well as the dragon blood that they had gathered in the three thousand worlds so that they could condense new Dragon Blood Battle Armors.

As a result, all of their powers grew explosively. Thus, they spent some time drilling to get used to their new power, and after making sure that there were no problems, they rushed over to where Long Chen was.

Long Chen had told them not to rush. After all, he had only come to get a wife.

Hence, they hadn’t rushed and only managed to arrive at the Vermilion Bird Empire at this time. Fortunately, on their way here, they had heard that the Vermilion Bird Empire was under attack, so they immediately rushed over at full speed.

Guo Ran and the others had come, and so was Dong Mingyu, causing Long Chen’s heart to warm up.

“No, you didn’t come late! You came right on time!” Long Chen was moved. Just now, he had made his determination to fight to the death. But the other side had so many terrifying experts, including two unfathomable existences in the form of Dongfang Zichu and Enpuda, so he had no assurance to win at all.

However, their arrival revitalized him. As for the Vermilion Bird Empire’s people, they were shocked. These people were all Immortal Kings, yet their auras were frighteningly sharp.

Among them, Dong Mingyu appeared ethereal and elusive, to the point where even Yu Xiaoyun couldn't sense her presence despite standing right before him. She seemed like a phantom, shrouded in mystery and intrigue.

“Big brother Long Chen, I have an agreement with my master to take Enpuda’s head. Leave him to me,” said Dong Mingyu.

Long Chen’s heart shook. “Are you sure?”

Dong Mingyu turned to look at him and smiled. “Don’t worry. I will use my power to prove that I can protect you.”

Suddenly, Enpuda stabbed his dagger through the air, parrying another dagger that materialized in midair, causing sparks to fly. After that, Dong Mingyu’s figure somehow appeared in front of Enpuda.

This scene made everyone jump. Dong Mingyu had clearly been near Long Chen. How did she suddenly appear in front of Enpuda?

When they looked at the Dong Mingyu by Long Chen again, they saw her figure slowly fading away. It was nothing more than an afterimage.

“What speed!”

Even three-flower Earth Venerates quivered. If they were to fight someone with that speed, by the time they reacted, their head would already be on the ground.

Enpuda shook his head at Dong Mingyu with their daggers crossed. “You were once my follower, and I have always been waiting for your return. However, you aren’t a match for me. I don’t want to kill you, so you can leave!”

“Conner. You lie to so many people that you’ve convinced yourself of your own lies. You brought me into the darkness, and it was big brother Long Chen who brought me back to the light, making me no longer a cold killing machine,” said Dong Mingyu indifferently.

“If that’s the case, you have yet to comprehend the true essence of killing. To have pity but be pitiless, to have a heart but be heartless, killing is the law of the survival of the fittest. With our hands, we are simply taking the place of the Heavenly Daos to cleanse this world. Killing shows you what reverence is. Only with reverence can this world have order, and only with order can this world function properly. So, an assassin is an envoy that walks the line between light and dark, carrying out a heavenly mission to be the natural selector of this world. Laws are naturally heartless. When have the Heavenly Daos ever pitied the weak?” said Enpuda.

Dong Mingyu smiled. “If you are carrying out a heavenly mission, why do you need to take so much money? Are you sure that you’re carrying out the mission of the Heavenly Daos, not the mission of making money? What a fake pretense. You lie under the title of a god, and you always have endless excuses and reasons. No wonder you are called the Despicable Killing God. But no matter how despicable you are, your lies are useless. I have seen your true face. You destroyed my younger years, and I will destroy your later years. That… is the true Heavenly Daos.”

Dong Mingyu suddenly vanished. In that instant, Enpuda’s expression completely changed. His fat figure swayed, and he vanished as well.

The moment Enpuda vanished, Dongfang Zichu also moved, looking like a fleeing rabbit.

Just as they flew away, the tiniest black dot appeared in the space where Dong Mingyu had been.

That black dot suddenly grew in every direction, devouring all the nearby space. Enpuda and Dongfang Zichu were the first to run, but their comrades did not.

Over ten people were too slow to react and were touched by that black hole. The moment that happened, they turned into black dust.

To everyone's astonishment, they didn't even get a chance to scream or utter a sound. They simply vanished, dissipating into nothingness, with even their Yuan Spirits unable to escape.

“That is…!”

Upon seeing this scene, Long Chen’s heart shook. That was Dong Mingyu’s manifestation. He had seen it once in the three thousand worlds.

Back then, her manifestation was nothing more than some support that gave her some dark energy.

But now, it had become a substantial law, something that could not be resisted even by three-flower Earth Venerates. It was a power that Long Chen had yet to come into contact with.

The black hole vanished as if it had never appeared. In the same fashion, over ten three-flower Earth Venerates would never appear again.Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

That bizarre sight horrified countless people. After all, this was an unknown power, one that they couldn’t resist.

BOOM!

Suddenly, the void exploded, and with a roar, Enpuda’s divine statue appeared behind him, causing milky white light to envelope him.

Similar to Liao Bencang, countless tiny statues appeared behind Enpuda’s large statue. But in terms of number, he possessed over ten times more statues than Liao Bencang. Just from this, everyone could see that Enpuda’s true power was not something that Liao Bencang could compare to.

When Liao Bencang and Enpuda had fought in the past, Enpuda had always restrained himself. That caused people to assume that the two were equally matched. But in truth, there was a huge difference.

BOOM!

Suddenly, the black hole appeared once more and smashed into Enpuda’s faith domain. The clash of these two kinds of power emitted heaven-shaking explosive sounds.

Following that, they saw Dong Mingyu appear like a phantom within that darkness. She attacked Enpuda directly.

Their figures once more vanished, and people could only see black and white repeatedly clashing like two worlds competing.

“Dragonblood Cross Slash!”

Just as everyone’s attention was drawn by Dong Mingyu, Guo Ran took the chance to cross his sabers in front of him. After that, an enormous attack shot out.
