Chapter 2421 The Divine Gate’s Anger, Both Sides Injured

Translator: BornToBe

The Demon Moon Furnace that Long Chen had condensed with his Spiritual Strength was instantly destroyed. It was unable to block a single attack from the phoenix.

Long Chen was shocked. Feng Fei’s spiritual attack was incredibly sharp. Despite their Spiritual Strength being relatively even, with Long Chen feeling like his Spiritual Strength was actually somewhat stronger, when it came to using that Spiritual Strength, he was far inferior.

Feng Fei’s attack continued without pause, crashing into Long Chen’s mind-sea. Long Chen’s body turned rigid.

Feng Fei herself jumped. She had thought that with Long Chen’s arrogance, he had to have some power. But his spiritual furnace was instantly broken, and her attack had continued into his mind-sea. He would definitely die.

She had only been angry with Long Chen for being so disrespectful to her and cursing her for being stupid. She had wanted to teach him a lesson, not kill him.

Who would have thought that despite having such powerful Spiritual Strength, he had no idea how to use it? She didn’t even have time to recall her attack. She felt a trace of remorse inside, but it was too late.

Just at this moment, the Divine Gate Star within Long Chen’s mind-sea shuddered. A ray of light shot out of it, tearing apart the spiritual attack that had entered his mind-sea.

The Divine Gate Star seemed to have been provoked and unleashed its own attack. This attack not only combined all of Long Chen’s Spiritual Strength, but it possessed its own law. It shot out of Long Chen’s head, transforming into a ray of light that pierced toward the phoenix.

A light-sword shot out of the phoenix, but it was blasted apart like rotting wood. The Divine Gate Star’s attack continued to strike the phoenix.

The light entered through the phoenix’s head and traversed through its body, tearing through it and causing it to explode. The light then continued and struck Feng Fei. Feng Fei tottered and retreated a few steps, turning pale. A trace of blood flowed out of her mouth and dripped onto the ground.

“Senior Feng Fei is injured!” Feng Fei’s attendants hastily charged forward. They supported her, shocked to find that her aura had plummeted.

As for Long Chen, he was also ashen, the light in his eyes having grown dim.

Just now, the attack of the Divine Gate Star had not just taken all his Spiritual Strength, but it had also taken the energy of the FengFu, Alioth, Life Star, and Enlightenment Palace Stars. Only the Nethergate Star had remained silent.

The energy of the five stars had been sucked away. Long Chen also didn’t know what that energy was precisely. In any case, he felt a wave of weakness wash over him.

“Bastard, senior Feng Fei showed mercy on you, and you took advantage to launch such an insidious attack! I’ll slaughter you!” One of Feng Fei’s bodyguards roared. Seeing Long Chen’s aura was much weaker, he charged over. The other bodyguards followed.

“Idiot, do you think that I can’t handle you just because I’m injured?” Long Chen snorted, killing intent blazing in his eyes. He took out the door knocker he had taken from the Gates of Hell. He held it behind his back.

“Stop!”

Just at this moment, Feng Fei’s voice rang out. It was clearly weak, so her injuries must be severe.

Those bodyguards instantly stopped. Although they knew that this was their best chance to kill Long Chen, since Feng Fei had given them an order, they couldn’t disobey.

They didn’t realize that Feng Fei’s single word had pulled them back from the gates of hell.

Once those people retreated, Long Chen put away the door knocker. No one saw his movements. He indifferently looked at Feng Fei.

Feng Fei was also looking at him. She coldly said, “I underestimated you. This time, it can count as a draw. Next time, you won’t be so lucky.”

Just now, the attack had come with no warning, not giving her a chance to prepare. But Feng Fei had her own pride, and she didn’t want to keep going. She had also seen that Long Chen’s injuries should be worse than hers.

“I hope that there won’t be a next time. If you do attack me next time, I might kill you,” said Long Chen coldly.

This foolish woman wanted his life because of her own foolishness. Even if their enmity was just a result of her stupidity, Long Chen viewed her the same as his mortal enemies. He could not be soft toward his enemies. Even if she was a peerless beauty, he would still kill her.

“Long Chen, you’ve been rude to senior Feng Fei multiple times now. I’ll teach you a lesson today!” At this moment, Di Feng suddenly stood up, pointing at Long Chen with condemnation.

“Hahaha!” Long Chen laughed. “People all say that a weakened tiger can die to a dog, but a dog is still a dog. Understand this: no matter how weak the tiger grows, it can still kill you with a single slap. Even if your aura is different, even if you’ve obtained more from the Blood Emperor, if you dare to attack, I will still turn you into a dead dog.”

“You…?” Di Feng’s heart shook. It seemed that Long Chen had seen through some of his secrets. It felt like he was being seen through, making him feel uneasy.

Long Chen had beaten him several times now. Every time he saw Long Chen, he had heart palpitations. Long Chen could already be considered his heart-devil.

“Don’t worry, I won’t take your dog life today. That’s because your life isn’t mine. In the future, someone else will properly settle debts with your Di family,” said Long Chen.

“What shameless boasting! Today, I’ll teach you a lesson on behalf of senior Feng Fei!”

Despite lacking some confidence, he saw how badly injured Long Chen was. This was an incredibly rare chance. As long as he could kill Long Chen, he could wipe away all his humiliation. Furthermore, he even had a good excuse so people wouldn’t be able to laugh at him over taking advantage of Long Chen’s condition. Adding on that this could curry favor with Feng Fei and test some of Long Chen’s trump cards, he stepped forward.

Just as Di Feng was about to attack, Feng Fei snorted, “No one is permitted to make things hard on Long Chen today. I will personally defeat him next time.”

“But senior Feng Fei, he…!” Di Feng grew alarmed. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

Feng Fei didn’t even look at him. She was looking at Long Chen. “Although you’re arrogant, you are qualified to be that way. You can go. Next time, I will make sure you are thoroughly convinced of your defeat.”

“Since senior Feng Fei has already spoken, shouldn’t you hurry and scram?!” shouted Di Feng, enraged.

Long Chen indifferently smiled. He also ignored Di Feng, saying to Feng Fei, “I’ve already said what I had to say. The choice is up to you.”

Long Chen took out a flying boat and left just like that.

Watching him leave, Feng Fei snorted and turned back. “We’re going back to the divine families.”

Those attendants hastily took out her carriage. She quickly got on and sped off, vanishing.

“Di Feng, if you go find Long Chen after I’m gone, I will kill you.”

Even though the chariot had vanished, Feng Fei’s icy voice rang out.

“That woman!”

Di Feng clenched his teeth and punched the void. He had been planning on immediately chasing Long Chen, but she had noticed.

“Feng-er, endure it. Who cares about Long Chen? Compared to the big plan, he’s nothing. Furthermore, Feng Fei is a heavenly genius. You have to maintain the appropriate mannerism around her. Perhaps one day, hehe…,” indicated Di Long.

“Her?” Di Feng was startled but then shook his head. He was well aware that Feng Fei was too arrogant. She didn’t care about any man.

He could also be considered an expert in this regard. Unless he could suppress her with absolute power, she would not be tame to him.

“What now? We’re going to leave things just like this? We’re going to waste such a heaven-sent opportunity?” Di Feng was unwilling.

Di Long shook his head. “Don’t do foolish things that aren’t worth it. We just have to clean up.”

Di Long led everyone back into the headquarters of the ancient family alliance.

…

“Big brother Long Chen, I’m curious, why didn’t you tell Feng Fei what happened? Just falling into someone else’s scheme is quite irritating,” said Ling-er.

Long Chen shook his head. “A scheme requires idiots to cooperate. My explanation would be useless. Di Long arranged this long in advance, and they wouldn’t give me any chance.”

“I don’t understand,” said Ling-er.

“It’s simple. Even if I explained everything that happened clearly, Di Long would immediately apologize and then go investigate. This investigation might take ten days, a month, or longer. Do you think that I’d wait? They know my temper, and who knows how many backups they had to create a conflict between me and Feng Fei? Even if they couldn’t get her to kill me, they would make us mortal enemies. I immediately explained their plan to Feng Fei, but that idiot woman still went with it. There’s nothing else to do,” sighed Long Chen.

“What about that old fellow? Are we going to let him escape so easily?” demanded Ling-er, still not willing to let things go. She felt very bad about letting the elder get away in his flying boat.

“Why bother with someone who’s definitely dead?” Long Chen shook his head.
