Chapter 4443 Nether Dragon Blood Sword

An immense dragon claw stretched out of Netherdragon Tianzhao’s manifestation and smashed down at Long Chen.

BOOM!

It tore through the land, but with a quiver of Long Chen’s Kunpeng wings, he flew out from its claws.

“The warm-up is over! Long Chen, face your death!” Netherdragon Tianzhao roared. He seemed to have predicted Long Chen’s trajectory and instantly appeared in front of him.

Just as he unleashed a fist at Long Chen, his black scales extended, and a wild astral wind unfurled, its power shaking heaven and earth.

“The warm-up is over. But the one facing their death is you.”

Long Chen snorted and suddenly stamped on the air. Using his left foot as the pivot, he swung his right foot through the air.

BOOM!

When the fist and foot clashed, a dragon cry erupted. The terrifying power stripped off all other colors from the world, except for black and golden.

Impacted by this power, numerous spectators suddenly coughed up blood. Their insides were shaken.

“Retreat!”

This time, even the seniors were shocked. While they knew the two combatants had been holding back, they hadn’t expected them to suddenly unleash such destructive power the moment they went all out.

The astral wind hadn’t even reached them yet, but they felt like they had just been smashed with a hammer. Numerous people were dazed, and the weaker ones were still hacking up blood.

BOOM!

Netherdragon Tianzhao and Long Chen once more clashed, and four hands repeatedly struck each other.

“DIE!”

Both Long Chen and Netherdragon Tianzhao roared, unleashing their Blood Qi with unbridled force.

As their dragon blood powers raged, their manifestations also clashed against each other. The very fabric of heaven and earth seemed to crumble, scattering myriad fragments of spacetime. The world was in the throes of destruction.

Witnessing the catastrophic clash, the Eternal experts hastily summoned shields to protect their disciples and retreated. However, these shields proved futile in the face of the overwhelming devastation, shattering upon contact and forcing them into a desperate retreat.

BOOM!

With another explosive collision, Long Chen and Netherdragon Tianzhao retreated at the same time, before once more flying at each other.

BOOM!

The void twisted and contorted as Long Chen and Netherdragon Tianzhao’s figures appeared to merge, leaving behind a trail of countless afterimages. The very void was rent asunder, creating a scene of absolute devastation.

“Nether Dragon Heaven Splitter!”

Netherdragon Tianzhao extended his claws, and as if the very heavens were a painting, he tore them apart. A black crack then shot toward Long Chen.

This was Netherdragon Tianzhao’s first time using a divine ability in this fight, and this scene horrified the spectators. Netherdragon Tianzhao’s power had exceeded their understanding.

The nine heavens and ten lands’ first awakened Heavenly Doyen—this was his terrifying power.

Facing this terrifying crack, Long Chen was brimming with fighting spirit. Back then, Netherdragon Tianye had also used this move, but it was many times stronger in Netherdragon Tianzhao’s hands.

This was an incomprehensible attack that could only be blocked, not dodged. With a resounding shout, golden light erupted out of Long Chen, and his 108,000 dragon scales concentrated all their power on his fist.

BOOM!

Even before Netherdragon Tianzhao’s attack arrived, Long Chen’s fist had already torn through the void, forming an immense black hole.

Then, the crack arrived. When it struck the hole that Long Chen made, the spatial crack exploded.

Netherdragon Tianzhao had never expected Long Chen to resolve this special attack so easily. This special attack was like tearing a piece of paper that had been creased. Tearing it across the crease was normally easy and tidy, but if a hole suddenly appeared in the middle of the crease, its power would suddenly disperse and would no longer continue down its original path.

Netherdragon Tianzhao was still recovering from the shock of witnessing one of his trump cards being effortlessly dealt with when Long Chen suddenly materialized in front of him, delivering a powerful stomp. Although Netherdragon Tianzhao’s technique had not completely dissipated, it had lost its intended target. In a hurry, he raised his arms to defend against Long Chen’s attack.

BANG!

He blocked it, but due to his hastiness, his defense was not perfect. Long Chen’s foot slammed into his palm, which then hit his face, sending him flying.

Numerous startled cries out. Throughout this intense battle, it was their first time seeing someone take the upper hand.

After sending him flying, Long Chen didn’t pause. His Kunpeng wings flapped, and he vanished, reappearing behind Netherdragon Tianzhao.

“What speed!” More startled cries rang out. Before this, the two of them had already been shockingly fast. However, the speed Long Chen had just displayed was much greater, leaving the onlookers in the dust.

Having appeared behind his opponent, Long Chen unleashed a claw at the back of Netherdragon Tianzhao, targeting his heart. Long Chen was incomparably fast, not giving his opponent any time to react.

Just as everyone let out startled cries, Long Chen’s dragon claw pierced through Netherdragon Tianzhao. Some kind of black qi then exploded, and Netherdragon Tianzhao was blown apart.

Everyone was shocked. Netherdragon Tianzhao had been slain? That was too sudden, so they couldn’t believe this.Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

Immediately, Long Chen’s expression darkened slightly, and he abruptly vanished.

BOOM!

Just as he did, a black sword pierced through his afterimage.

That black sword missed Long Chen but shot through the battlefield. Seeing it flying toward him, an Eternal was unable to do anything other than scream.

“No!”

BOOM!

He was instantly blasted apart, but the bits of his body didn’t fall to the ground. They slowly dissipated into the void.

Everyone jumped in fright. Even if an Eternal expert was slain, their bodies would usually remain. That was the meaning of Eternity.

However, Netherdragon Tianzhao’s attack had just wiped the Eternal expert’s body out of existence. In other words, this attack had destroyed his Eternity, exterminating even an Eternal body.

At this time, Netherdragon Tianzhao reappeared in the air, his eyes sharply glaring at the distant Long Chen.

“Your reaction speed isn’t bad. Otherwise, you’d already be a dead man. But now, it’s time to see if you can block my Nether Dragon Blood Sword.”

Just then, pitch-black swords appeared in his manifestations, giving off an incredibly strong scent of blood.
