Chapter 2722 No Belief

“How much do you know about Lord Brahma and Fallen Daynight?” asked Long Chen.

Long Chen was extremely curious about these two gods. Why was it that he felt such dislike for these two gods? No, it should be called a kind of hatred instead.

He wasn’t sure if this hatred came from the Pill Sovereign memories or the Nine Star Hegemon Body Art. Or perhaps it came from himself.

“What anyone knows about Lord Brahma and Fallen Daynight comes from Pill Valley’s inheritance. According to Pill Valley’s sacred texts, Lord Brahma created the Dao of the pill flame, while Fallen Daynight created the Dao of forging furnaces. One is a master of all flames, cultivating pill refining arts. One is a master of forging, creating pill furnaces and pill cauldrons. With one refiner and one forger, they are called the masters of the Pill Dao. Without them, there would be no Pill Dao,” said the High Priest.

“What absolute crap.”

Those words came out of Long Chen’s mouth before he even thought about it. He hastily apologized. “Sorry, I wasn’t talking about you but the crap in Pill Valley’s sacred texts.”

The High Priest simply smiled faintly, looking at him with interest. “It seems that you have your own opinion. Let me hear it.”

“I wouldn’t call it an opinion. These two fellows are simply shameless. They couldn’t possibly be the masters of the Pill Dao,” said Long Chen scornfully.

“And why is that?” asked the High Priest.

“This is just like the philosophical question that perplexes people, which came first, the chicken or the egg? Let’s avoid wondering whether it was the chicken or the egg for now. It is impossible for either to appear without some cause. There had to be something that existed before them, or there would be no chicken or egg. That existence is the ancestor of all Daos, the source of all things. Just ask yourself, where do gods come from? They didn’t jump out of a rock. Cough, I’m referring to those two fellows, not the Wine God.”

Long Chen once more apologized as he felt such words were a kind of offense to someone with such devotion to a god. However, the High Priest brushed him off, indicating for him to go on.

“The source of all things, which existed before gods, is primal chaos. The Heavenly Daos evolved, manifesting all life, giving rise to spirits and intelligence. Although I don’t know the true source of the Pill Dao, it is impossible for someone to be born knowing how to refine pills or forge items. The most primitive form of the Pill Dao was most likely boiling food. There was a flame and a pot. The fire burned and the stove heated up. Later on, it began to evolve. The flames began to be classified, and the pot began to evolve into countless shapes, cauldrons, furnaces, stoves, etc. In the earliest stages, they were used to boil things. Although I don’t know how exactly the Pill Dao came to be, it definitely was not created by the two of them.”

“And how can you be so sure of that?” asked the High Priest.

Long Chen confidently said, “First, any expert who is capable of comprehending the Pill Dao must be someone with great intellect. Such a person knows that they are standing on the shoulders of countless ancestors who developed the Pill Dao to its current state. Even if they were to admit that they are the earliest ancestor of the Pill Dao, they would not be so arrogant to say that without them, there would be no Pill Dao. That is because even without them, the Pill Dao would still be developed. For Lord Brahma and Fallen Daynight to claim themselves to be the masters of the Pill Dao, that without them there would be no Pill Dao, is absolute nonsense. Those are definitely not the words of someone with the intellect required to create the Pill Dao.”

“That has some logic behind it. Then what is the second reason?”

“The second reason is even more obvious. One controlled fire, one created furnaces. What the hell does that have to do with the Pill Dao? If I were to make a comparison, one chopped wood for burning, and one made a stove. Then the two of them met each other. Could they possibly instantly create a way to make delicious food and call themselves the Chef God? Perhaps only those fools in Pill Valley would believe such nonsense. As for me, I wouldn’t believe it even if I was beaten to death. Those two are definitely scammers,” said Long Chen.

At first, the High Priest was simply smiling and rather indifferent. However, when he heard this second point, he was finally moved.

Due to being a follower of a god, he had never had any doubts toward gods. He fully believed everything about the Wine God.

However, this analysis and tear down of Lord Brahma and Fallen Daynight truly made him feel suspicious. That was because the Wine God Palace also had some sacred texts. The Wine God had tasted all the grains of life, climbed the myriad mountains, and overlooked the seas and rivers of the world, all in search of the natural Dao. In the end, the Wine God happened to be enlightened in a farmer’s house and began trying the Dao of making wine.

The Wine God had never claimed himself to be the ancestor of the Wine Dao. The Wine Dao did not exist because of the Wine God. It was the Wine God who existed because of the Wine Dao.

The Wine God said that he could become the Wine God because of the guidance of the Heavenly Daos. It was fate. As for those that had given him his enlightenment, he called them his masters. Just as Long Chen said, he knew that he stood on the shoulders of those that came before him and had respect and gratitude for them. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

“I don’t know why, but the first time I saw the statues of Lord Brahma and Fallen Daynight, I felt particularly disgusted with them. I even peed on their statues,” said Long Chen.

The High Priest was astonished. He had not thought that Long Chen would dare to do such a blasphemous thing. “Whether you are right or wrong, Lord Brahma and Fallen Daynight truly possess terrifying power as gods. Perhaps in the entire Martial Heaven Continent, only Pill Valley possesses the power to reach through the wall of ascension and absorb the power of their gods to support themselves. That is the most terrifying thing.”

The High Priest had said that the Wine God could not send his power to support the Martial Heaven Continent, but Pill Valley was capable of it. That indicated that there were differences even amongst gods.

“Disciple understands. I will be careful,” said Long Chen.

“Of the Martial Heaven Continent’s god inheritances, the Killing God’s inheritance is still present but has been suppressed by you to the point that it does not dare to appear again. As for the Corrupt God’s inheritance, it has completely vanished,” said the High Priest.

“What?”

“Ye Ming has thrown himself to the Undying race, so the entire Corrupt path has been offered as a sacrifice to the Undying race. That was a plot that the Undying race set into motion ages ago by the time of Ye Ming’s previous life. Ye Ming’s death eyes were the seed. In his current life, he stole the entire inheritance of the Corrupt God. As a result, the Corrupt God’s doctrine has ended on the continent.”

Long Chen’s heart jumped. The Undying race was truly vicious. They had actually devoured the inheritance of the Corrupt God. No wonder the Corrupt path’s disciples had never appeared after Resentful Death City was opened. So they had all been sacrificed.

“When it comes to the Eastern Wasteland Bell, you’ll need to rely on yourself. I know of nothing that can help you. But you don’t need to be impatient. The Eastern Wasteland Bell is the leader of the five supreme divine items. Its very life is deeply connected to the Martial Heaven Continent. It should appear,” comforted the High Priest.

Suddenly, a light sound came from a jade plate on Long Chen’s waist. Startled, he checked it and hastily bid farewell to the High Priest. After that, he rushed to the Illusive Music Immortal Palace. It was Zi Yan who had sent him a request for aid.
