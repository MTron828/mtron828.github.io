Chapter 4315: Golden Wing Great Peng

BOOM!

Facing this Kunpeng expert’s attack, Long Chen didn’t dare to be careless. He directly summoned the Dragon King Battle Armor and unleashed his own claw. When their claws collided, the impact generated powerful shockwaves that shook Long Chen’s entire body and blew back the Kunpeng.

Long Chen couldn’t believe it. This Kunpeng’s speed was truly terrifying, and his ferocious charge made the pit of Long Chen’s stomach flutter.

After being blown back, the Kunpeng directly summoned his Kunpeng manifestation. When it appeared, primal chaos qi flowed around the Kunpeng, and the ten thousand Daos rumbled.

With the support of his manifestation, the Kunpeng folded his wings and slashed down on Long Chen, wielding them like golden blades. His attacks were as quick as lightning, but Long Chen's instincts allowed him to dodge them.

The power of the Kunpeng’s wings continued to slash through the ground like an enormous saber, leaving a ditch that spread beyond the horizon.

This was a bottomless ditch, and the walls still had golden light flickering on them. This was an attack that cleaved apart heaven and earth, causing even Long Chen to jump in shock.

After missing his first attack, the Kunpeng swept his wings horizontally and unleashed a wave of golden divine light at Long Chen and the others. His attacks came shockingly fast.

BOOM!

Long Chen slashed the golden wings with his Seven Peak Sword. After the collision, an immense power erupted and shook the entire world, causing dust and rocks to fly into the sky.

“What a powerful divine ability!” Long Chen was shocked. The Seven Peak Sword was condensed from his seven-color Supreme Blood, and its hardness was comparable to an Eternal divine item. However, this Kunpeng’s wings were just as tough and completely undamaged after their exchange.

The runes on the wings shone brightly, looking like they were made of gold. As divine radiance flowed on top of them, they emitted a terrifying pressure.

“So it’s the Kunpeng race’s Golden Wing Great Peng race. You actually have such terrifying power,” Long Chen marveled. He had encountered golden-winged Pengs before, but they were nothing more than a branch of the Kunpeng race and not very strong.

On the other hand, this Golden Wing Great Peng possessed the aura of the true Kunpeng and boasted a pure bloodline. Its wings were practically indestructible and were incredibly powerful.

“Lowly human! You may have some ability, but you aren’t qualified to comment on my Kunpeng race!” The Kunpeng was roaring in fury after being blown back by Long Chen. All of a sudden, he spread his wings and opened his mouth.

With no warning at all, golden divine light pierced toward Long Chen, so fast that he almost couldn’t react before it reached him.

“Seven Peak Shield!”

Seven-color divine radiance manifested on Long Chen’s left hand, condensing into a shield before him.

BOOM!

His Seven Peak Shield exploded just like that, and his left hand was left bloody.

The divine light that the Kunpeng had just spat out was clearly his strongest attack, and even the Seven Peak Shield was unable to block it.

“Die!”

Seeing the chance, the Kunpeng shot at Long Chen like a bolt of golden lightning. Now, Long Chen’s left hand was numb, and half of his body was somewhat paralyzed. He would definitely be at a disadvantage in a direct clash. Hence, with a flap of his wings, he appeared thousands of miles away.

“An insignificant trick! How dare you take something like that out?” the Kunpeng sneered as golden divine radiance erupted out of him. He instantly appeared in front of Long Chen.

Overwhelmed by shock, Long Chen couldn’t fathom how the Kunpeng had closed the distance between them so quickly. It was a speed unlike anything he had ever seen before.

BOOM!

The Seven Peak Sword descended with a resounding crash, forcefully propelling both combatants in opposite directions. However, just as the Kunpeng was sent flying, its wings ignited in a brilliant blaze. In the blink of an eye, he vanished from sight.

Long Chen’s instincts tingled with foreboding. His own Kunpeng wings then flapped, and he appeared to teleport eight times in rapid succession.

BOOM!

Despite Long Chen’s best efforts, he couldn’t escape, so he swung the Seven Peak Sword to defend himself. However, due to his inferior speed, he was hurtled through the air once again.

“Boss!”

Both Xia Chen and Guo Ran cried out in shock, unable to believe that their boss was at a disadvantage.

“Kill those two ants!” ordered that Kunpeng. Hearing his command, the Kunpeng’s sidekicks immediately shot toward Guo Ran and Xia Chen.

“Ants?! You’re the ants! Your whole family consists of ants! Try to look in the mirror!” cursed Xia Chen furiously as he tossed out a formation disc. When countless runes lit up on the disc, an apocalyptic aura suddenly erupted out of it.

“Run!”

The leader figure of the Kunpengs was taken aback, shouting in alarm, but it was too late. The formation disc already sped toward them.

BOOM!

With the detonation of the formation disc, a deadly wave rippled outward, and the Kunpengs found themselves horribly maimed by it.

“Fuck, why don’t you come again?! Come on, keep acting arrogant!” Xia Chen cursed the badly injured Kunpengs.

Guo Ran was stunned, not expecting Xia Chen to possess such a trump card and cursing skills.

“The power of three thousand primal chaos spirit stones isn’t bad! Come, I still have more spirit stones!” shouted Xia Chen, gritting his teeth in fury.

He was gritting his teeth because of the loss of these spirit stones. He had indeed gained quite a few treasures during this time, including some formation discs that could be used for offense. However, they required primal chaos spirit stones as fuel, and the price was heart-breaking for him.

Xia Chen wouldn’t dare to use such a move unless he had no other choice. Unfortunately, those Kunpengs had enraged him, so he didn’t care anymore and directly unleashed his killing move.

“Courting death!” their leader shouted furiously. When he spread his wings, a terrifying divine pressure rose out of him.

“Where do you think you’re going?!”

Just then, Long Chen smashed at this Kunpeng with a bronze cauldron.

BOOM!

Distracted by the actions of Xia Chen and Guo Ran, this Kunpeng was caught off guard by Long Chen’s sudden assault. As a result, the Earth Cauldron hit his back.

Blood gushed from his mouth as his bones shattered, and his muscles were torn asunder. Despite his formidable strength, he proved unable to withstand the devastating force of the Earth Cauldron. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

“Despicable human race! If you have guts, have an honorable fight with me… pfft!” He bellowed amid the blood he was spitting up.

“Idiot, if not for your wings, do you think I would have fought against you for so long? Go in peace! I’ll kindly accept your wings!”

The next moment, Long Chen’s Seven Peak Sword slashed down with precision, and that Kunpeng’s head soared into the air.

Then, with a thrust of his sword, Long Chen dealt the killing blow to the other Kunpengs and sucked them into the primal chaos space.

“Good job! Let’s go!”

Xia Chen took out a formation disc, and its divine light shrouded them, causing the trio to vanish.

BOOM!

Just as they disappeared, a sharp claw tore through the heavens, crushing the space where they had stood just moments before.

“Damn human race! You dare to kill my Kunpeng race’s offspring! I will destroy your entire race!”

A horrifying roar split the air. The one attacking was an Eternal expert who had come to save the young Kunpengs, but Long Chen had acted too quickly. The intervention had come just a moment too late.
