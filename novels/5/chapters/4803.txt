Chapter 4792 News of Mother

Long Zhantian observed the departing woman with a contemplative gaze before nodding. “It must be her. Her arrival signals that this world has reached a certain threshold. Whether it leads to destruction or rebirth remains uncertain.”

“Dad, you...” Long Chen stared at his father in confusion.

“I’m just guessing. I can’t be too sure about such a thing,” Long Zhantian replied, shaking his head. “However, her words and actions are very similar to that existence in the legend. If it truly is her, this won’t be the last time you encounter her. When that time comes, you can seek confirmation directly. Then, you will understand”

“Fine. Seniors always like to talk mysteriously,” Long Chen said with a wry smile.

“Don’t be like that. I can’t be sure, so I don’t want to randomly say anything. Wouldn’t it be embarrassing to say it and be wrong?” laughed Long Zhantian.

After being silent for a bit, Long Chen asked, “Dad, can you stay for a few days? I miss you.”

His eyes reddened slightly. Despite standing at the top of the geniuses of the nine heavens, he still thirsted for a closer relationship with his father. Back in the Phoenix Cry Empire, Long Tianxiao had adopted him, loving him more than his own life. However, due to various schemes, he was forced to guard the border, unable to stay by Long Chen’s side as he grew.

Long Chen's heart felt an ache that his words couldn't express adequately. Although his tone wasn’t too heavy, he practically begged his father.

Long Zhantian's heart twinged at his son's plea. He gently patted Long Chen's shoulder and drew him into a tight embrace. “Chen-er, it’s my fault. I know I owe you a great deal, but you’re not the only one I have a responsibility toward. Forgive me.”

“You... you have news of mother?” asked Long Chen, his disappointment instantly vanishing.

Long Zhantian nodded solemnly. “Things are beginning to take shape. That’s why I can’t personally accompany you. I’m sorry...”

“No, it’s fine. Dad, you must bring Mom back. I... I...” Long Chen suddenly fell silent, unable to keep going as tears glistened in his eyes. He had dreamed of his mother countless times, but he was only able to hear her voice in his dreams. He never actually saw her.

This pain remained unspoken, not even to his lovers and closest brothers. This was the weakest part of his heart, and he didn’t want those closest to him to see it.

“I understand, son. Don’t worry, I can deal with it. On the other hand, I’m very worried for you. You find yourself in both the best and most terrifying of times..”

Long Zhantian stared at Long Chen, who chuckled in response. “Then you have nothing to worry about. I can deal with things on my side. From the mortal world to the immortal world, I’ve never been defeated by any of those so-called heavenly geniuses within the same realm. As long as you can bring Mom back, even if the entire world flips, I have nothing to fear. I also have a group of life-and-death brothers. Who can do anything to me?”

Long Chen’s words were overflowing with grand heroism. Hearing news of his mother completely reinvigorated him, filling him with confidence to face any challenges that might appear in the future.

“Hahaha, good. As expected of my son.”

Long Zhantian then turned toward the surrounding experts and shouted, “Long Chen is my son! The laws of the Heavenly Daos involve merciless competitions. There is nothing to be said if he falls during those competitions. However, if someone is so shameless as to bully juniors, don’t blame me for not being courteous. This isn’t a threat, just me preferring to use diplomacy before force. If anyone doesn’t like it, come and try me. I just hope that you are prepared to face my wrath.”

Long Zhantian’s meaning was clear. On the path of cultivation, it was like ten thousand horses were steadily trying to cross a single-log bridge—the competition was fierce. However, such a thing was unavoidable, so he would not interfere.

However, if someone acted as shamelessly as that Heaven Saint, Long Zhantian would definitely make them pay for it. Destroying the foundation of the Celestial race’s Heaven Saint was only a little warning from him.

With a single clone, Long Zhantian could easily suppress a Heaven Saint. Who wouldn’t be afraid of this kind of power? Perhaps certain mighty figures in the major factions wouldn’t fear Long Zhantian, but what about their disciples? If they dared to touch his son, it wouldn’t be too far for him to do the same to their disciples.

After that, who could possibly rest easy? Would they hide their disciples until Long Zhantian died? That simply wasn’t realistic. Thus, Long Zhantian’s speech had an immense deterrent effect.

“I didn’t kill that fellow...” transmitted Long Zhantian to Long Chen.

“Hehe, I understand.”

Long Zhantian smiled and patted Long Chen’s shoulder once more before fading away completely.

“Heavens, it wasn’t even a solid clone!” exclaimed an Earth Saint in astonishment. There were many kinds of clones, with projection clones typically used for deception and luring opponents as they lacked substantial strength. In contrast, physical clones were much stronger. The strongest ones could even harness seventy or even potentially eighty percent of the original body’s combat power. On the other hand, a projection clone rarely exceeded twenty or thirty percent.

Long Zhantian’s clone was so powerful that no one had even realized it was a clone at first. If the foolish Heaven Saint hadn’t pointed it out, most people would not have noticed it at all.

The realization that Long Zhantian had defeated the Heaven Saint with a projection clone left the experts dumbfounded. Despite both being Heaven Saints, the chasm between their strengths was staggering.

Just as everyone was shocked by this realization, the void exploded, revealing a figure hurtling toward Long Chen with a powerful palm strike. The might of a Heaven Saint pervaded the surroundings once more, rendering every expert immobilized, frozen in place by the overwhelming might.

“Ren Xuefeng!” Startled cries pierced the air as the figure revealed itself to be none other than the Heaven Saint of the Celestial race who had departed moments earlier. Somehow, he had hidden himself nearby.

“You little brat, die!” Ren Xuefeng roared like a bloodthirsty beast. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

This sudden attack caught Guo Ran and the others off-guard. Yue Zifeng reached for his sword, but Ren Xuefeng's palm already struck Long Chen. In a blur of motion, a cold glint flashed, and Ren Xuefeng's arm soared into the sky.
