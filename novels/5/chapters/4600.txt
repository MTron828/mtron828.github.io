Chapter 4589 Emperor Blood Silk Net

The seven-star Doyens’ Blood Qi erupted like raging flames as they pointed their dragon spears at Long Chen and Netherdragon Tianzhao.

Runes lit up on the tips of their spears, sucking dry the murderous aura within heaven and earth. The spectators' expressions turned grave.

“This is the Netherdragon race’s killer move. After igniting their essence blood, they combine their power for an ultimate attack!”

“Once their power fuses, they can’t control it. This one attack will use up all their energy, but the impact is world-destroying.”

“Is Netherdragon Tianzhao trying to drag Long Chen down with him? But things haven’t reached that point yet. Has he gone crazy?”

These spectators didn’t know what Long Chen and Netherdragon Tianzhao had experienced and also couldn’t understand his actions.

However, when the seven-star Doyens of the Netherdragon race made their moves, these spectators hastily retreated.

At first, the ignited essence blood could be considered flame seedlings, but the seedlings quickly grew out of control with raging flames exploding out of them, its terrifying heat twisting heaven and earth.

“Long Chen, you’re an idiot! I have the Nether Emperor’s power to protect me. I have an undying body! Let me see how you take this!” roared Netherdragon Tianzhao.

Just then, rays of divine light shot out, merging into one column that headed straight for Long Chen and Netherdragon Tianzhao.

In that moment, a deathly silence descended upon heaven and earth, as if time itself had halted. The sheer power of this attack enveloped everyone, filling the air with the unmistakable scent of impending death.

“Scram!” Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

Long Chen suddenly kicked Netherdragon Tianzhao in the butt, sending him flying straight toward that light.

However, the width of that column was so immense that Netherdragon Tianzhao alone wasn’t enough to fully shield Long Chen.

BOOM!

With an earth-shattering explosion, the divine light vanished in an instant. The space where Long Chen and Netherdragon Tianzhao stood was torn asunder, revealing countless fragments of spacetime hurtling in all directions. Through the resulting cracks within the void, countless twisting scenes came into view.

Everyone was stunned by this sight. This attack had already surpassed the scope of their understanding.

The void rapidly healed. Just then, a figure appeared from within the channel in the void, coughing up blood.

“It’s Netherdragon Tianzhao! He survived!”

“He didn’t die even after that? He’s absolutely terrifying!”

Netherdragon Tianzhao didn’t die. Actually, if he wasn’t coughing up blood, they wouldn’t even know that he was injured.

Not far from Netherdragon Tianzhao, divine light shimmered as a bronze cauldron materialized above Long Chen's head, shielding him from harm.

“This is what I was waiting for!”

Netherdragon Tianzhao spat out blood, yet a sinister smile hung on his face. He suddenly pointed a finger, unleashing a ray of divine light that exploded the void above Long Chen's head.

As the divine light transformed into a black silk net, the Earth Cauldron’s cry rang out in Long Chen’s mind.

“That’s a net made of Emperor Blood Silk! As expected, he came prepared. If I’m wrapped by that net, its curse power will invade my core, and I’ll once more fall into a slumber!”

The Emperor Blood Silk originated from a species of silkworm that could be regarded as part of the same race as the Nether Emperor. It boasted an unparalleled toughness, rendering it virtually indestructible. Legends claimed that this silk possessed the remarkable ability to stretch limitlessly; its length could match the vast expanse of heaven and earth itself.

The Emperor Blood Silkworm was one of the most nefarious beasts within the nine heavens and ten lands. As it consumed the Netherworld’s rotting corpses and resentful spirits, the silk that it spat out not only contained poison but also terrifying curse energy.

“The Nether Emperor must know that I’m in a weakened state! This net is a perfect counter against me! Long Chen, think of something!” urged the Earth Cauldron.

“Don’t worry, since I dared to take you out, I’m naturally not afraid of his scheme,” replied Long Chen.

Seeing that net, Long Chen grabbed the Earth Cauldron and flew back down the channel.

“You can’t get away! This Emperor Blood Silk Net is a treasure bestowed upon me by the great Nether Emperor! Its sole purpose is just to capture your Heaven Earth Cauldron! Now that you’ve taken it out, the net will pursue you forever! There’s nowhere for you to run, hahaha!” Netherdragon Tianzhao laughed, his arrogant appearance back.

His ultimate goal was Long Chen’s Heaven Earth Cauldron. He had persistently sought to provoke Long Chen into revealing it, but Long Chen had been reluctant to do so. In truth, his subordinates’ combined attack was also part of his scheme.

He would have perished under that attack had he not been shielded by the Nether Emperor’s power.

Therefore, he had wagered everything on this gamble. If Long Chen wished to survive, he would have no choice but to reveal the Heaven Earth Cauldron. Once Long Chen did so, Netherdragon Tianzhao's mission would be accomplished.

Within this channel, Netherdragon Tianzhao was powerless to attack Long Chen, so he was trying to use his fading Nether Emperor’s power to escape this channel. Otherwise, he would be trapped here.

Long Chen was the same. He needed to use the power of the Earth Cauldron to resist the power of spacetime and escape, or he would die in this chaotic space.

The minute Netherdragon Tianzhao unleashed the Emperor Blood Silk Net, he started to flee. Now, the rest was up to the Emperor Blood Silk Net.

The Earth Cauldron was rapidly evading the pursuit of the Emperor Blood Silk Net, which fortunately, seemed light and not particularly fast. It was trailing from a great distance.

Despite its seemingly slow pace, Long Chen couldn't shake the feeling of being relentlessly watched by an unyielding gaze. It was as if no matter where he fled, he could not escape the net's inexorable pursuit.

Just then, Long Chen and Netherdragon Tianzhao made their escape from the channel just as it closed behind them. Had they been any slower, they would have been ensnared by the net.

“I knew that once I used it, there was no taking it back.” Long Chen was unable to draw the Earth Cauldron back into the primal chaos space or his spiritual space.

“Although it hasn’t reached me yet, its curse seal has locked onto me. As long as it’s nearby, you won’t be able to put me away,” said the Earth Cauldron gravely.

The Emperor Blood Silk Net started to get closer again. At the same time, the broken fragments of the Ten Thousand Dragon Nest started to decay.

“Hahaha, where will you run now?!” taunted Netherdragon Tianzhao. He finally had a chance to breathe. While the Nether Emperor’s protective divine light was growing faint, he still felt excited.

“Run? Do I need to run from a shitty net?” sneered Long Chen.

Long Chen abruptly closed both of his eyes and then slowly opened one. A torrent of black divine light streamed into his eye, forming three flowers within.

“Purgatory Three Flower Pupil!” Long Chen shouted. The three flowers in his eyes spun, and a giant three flower diagram appeared in the air, enveloping the Emperor Blood Silk Net.
