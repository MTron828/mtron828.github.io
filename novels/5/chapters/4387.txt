Chapter 4376 The Humanless World’s Trump Card

“The humanless world’s experts are running!”

People's jaws almost dropped off their faces. When the gate was first opened, these experts had arrogantly declared their intention to raze the entire Nirvana Overflow Heaven.

If it weren’t for the palace master intimidating them, they might have long since launched an all-out assault. But now, Long Chen led a group of World Kings and forced them to flee for their lives.

“Heavens, are my eyes broken? What am I seeing?”

Even personally witnessing it, many people were unable to believe it. The humanless world’s lifeforms were in full retreat and cut down from behind.

“Dean Long Chen, don’t chase cornered enemies. Beware of unexpected circumstances.” Seeing the state of the battlefield, an experienced elder gave Long Chen a loud warning.

“They’re not cornered,” replied Guo Ran.

Long Chen remained silent, so Guo Ran took it upon himself to respond. In their eyes, this wasn't an ordinary battle. This battle wasn't fought for profit but for revenge, and revenge had to be sought at any cost.DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

Seeing that Long Chen didn’t listen to their advice, some people hastily sent word to the High Firmament Academy, urging the palace master to stop him.

The humanless world’s experts had said that they had their own trump card, and that was the reason the palace master didn’t dare to barge into the humanless world.

Now that Long Chen had put on the attitude of wanting to slaughter them all, the humanless world would pay any price to stop him.

However, Long Chen and the others were the treasures of the human race, the hopes of the Nirvana Overflow Heaven. If something happened to him, it would be a huge blow to the human race, potentially one they might never recover from.

While many people were not necessarily thinking about it from this perspective, whether it was the big picture or even just thinking about themselves, they couldn’t let Long Chen die. If he died, they would be next.

Long Chen was incredibly fast and crazily slaughtered the enemies. It was as if these Eternal experts had become mere live targets for him. He killed seven Eternal experts in a row, while they continued to flee for their lives.

“Boss, something seems off!”

Guo Ran was by Long Chen’s side, flying with his manufactured Kunpeng wings. Although they were just based on Long Chen’s wings, with the power of formations he had carved into them, his speed was only the slightest bit slower than that of Long Chen. Also, since Long Chen was fighting as he flew, Guo Ran managed to catch up to him. Seeing these Eternal experts continuing to flee as their comrades were slain, Guo Ran sensed something off.

“Something is definitely off. But who cares? We’ll kill them anyway. The old man always says that all schemes are useless in front of absolute power. Our absolute power is greater than theirs, so their schemes are worthless. If their absolute power is greater than ours, then we also don’t need to waste our energy thinking about it. I find that the path of cultivation really is simple. They definitely have a trump card. Otherwise, they would have launched an all-out struggle against us just like the Great Desolate World did at the end. However, we also have our own trump cards. We’ll see which one is stronger. Do you not have confidence in your battle armor?” asked Long Chen.

“Of course, I do. I already adjusted the runes to increase their limit. However, we’ve been fighting for a long time now. After such a high-intensity battle, our people have used up too much energy. On the other hand, our enemies are everywhere. They also seem slightly stronger than the Great Desolate World’s experts,” said Guo Ran.

The experts of the humanless world were quite clearly one level stronger. Within the same cultivation base and realm, the lifeforms of this world possessed greater strength. On the other hand, after such an immense battle, everyone had used up a great deal of energy. As the overall commander, Guo Ran had to constantly monitor their total power.

“Don’t worry, I’m here. We need to conclude this battle swiftly. The humanless world is unlike the Great Desolate World; they have their own secrets. We must uncover them," Long Chen reassured.

Long Chen continued to chase, but in the end, he was still left behind. It wasn't due to a lack of speed, but rather a cautious decision not to venture too far. Otherwise, he would be completely separated from the Dragonblood Legion.

After all, the humanless world’s experts had to have some trump card. If they deployed it against the Dragonblood Legion and Long Chen was too far, he wouldn’t be able to intervene and stop them.

In the end, the speed of Eternal experts was just too shocking. The Dragonblood warriors were unable to catch up to them.

“Boss, isn’t that the direction of the primal chaos eye?” asked Guo Ran suddenly.

Guo Ran took out a map, and Long Chen glanced at it. Just as Guo Ran said, the path the experts from the humanless world were retreating matched the direction of the primal chaos eye.

“It seems the secret is by the primal chaos eye. Tell our brothers not to advance too fast. Get ready for battle,” instructed Long Chen.

When Long Chen first arrived at the primal chaos eye, he already sensed that something was amiss. Although his stay in the humanless world was brief, he did meticulously observe the surroundings. He felt that this world’s primal chaos qi was scattered instead of concentrated. It was like there was fruit without any flowers. Hence, he felt that this world’s primal chaos qi was not created here.

As for the primal chaos eye, Long Chen had thought that it was the source of this world’s primal chaos energy. However, when its core exploded, Long Chen realized that he was wrong.

It had always been nagging him. Now, as they neared the primal chaos eye, he felt an immediate connection between the humanless world's secret and this location. Hastening toward the primal chaos eye, Long Chen heightened his vigilance to one hundred and twenty percent. He took the lead in charging forward as he saw that the experts from the humanless world had gathered here. It seemed that they wanted to have a decisive battle to the death here.

“Kill!”

A group of experts surrounded by devil qi attacked him. To his surprise, these experts were merely Heaven Venerates. Although their auras were powerful, they were unable to pose any threat to him.

Something was definitely off. Long Chen flicked his finger, and a miniature flame lotus shot out.

BOOM!

The flame lotus was only the size of a fingernail, but when it exploded amongst their ranks, it instantly devoured a thousand-mile space.

Those hundreds of devil experts were directly wiped out, having no chance to resist.

Guo Ran and the others were stunned. What was going on? Were they intentionally sending themselves to their deaths? There was definitely something fishy. They refused to believe that the humanless world would play such a senseless joke.

Just as Long Chen killed those experts, the earth suddenly swelled, and heaven-shaking devil qi erupted from a crack in the ground.

“Hahaha, you’re definitely dead! The Devil Saint has risen! You humans should just wait for your death!”

The experts from the humanless world laughed maniacally, their faces contorted with a savage expression.

“Who dares to kill the people of my race? This Saint will wipe you out of existence!”

Suddenly, a furious roar resonated from underground. An enormous figure shrouded in devil qi emerged, breaking free from the ground.
