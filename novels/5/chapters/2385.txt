Chapter 2375 The Goal is to Play You to Death

Translator: BornToBe

BOOM!

“Fuck!”

As soon as Ye Lingfeng returned to his camp, he smashed apart a stone platform. His face was frightening. The others didn’t dare to say a word.

“He wants to play with me? Fine, I’ll play with you. I’ll play you to death!” raged Ye Lingfeng.

Thinking of how the eighth legion was definitely counting their money with delight and deciding how to use their new wealth, Ye Lingfeng felt like he might burst.

He turned around. “Second commander, go to our camp and bring the Divine Dragon Tyrant Crossbow.”

The vice commander’s expression instantly changed. “Commander, that’s a killing weapon! Without it, our own camp would be in danger.”

“What are you afraid of? Just do it secretly. Our camp is solid, and demonic beasts haven’t attacked it in forever. It’s always us going hunting. It’s not like we have any demonic beast spies amongst us. Just don’t go telling them. How would they know?” said Ye Lingfeng coldly.

“But…” Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“No buts. I will bear responsibility for it, so hurry up. It takes a long time to dismantle and set the Divine Dragon Tyrant Crossbow up, so do it quickly. I want to use it while Long Chen and the others are trying to take back their first defensive line,” said Ye Lingfeng.

The vice commander helplessly listened to his orders.

“Third commander, go back and use all our points for Heaven Concealing Stones, Heaven Exploding Lightning, and killing formation discs.” Ye Lingfeng turned to another vice commander.

“All our points?!” The vice commander jumped in shock.

“Yes, all. I’m going to go big this time. Fuck, Long Chen dares to scheme against me? Then I’ll scheme him to death. When they try to reclaim their territory, we’ll launch a sneak attack on the surrounding nine large demonic beast races and draw them all over.”

“Commander, the eighth legion will be completely wiped out if that happens. Even in the best case, half of them will die. Do you really want to do this?” asked the vice commander. If the higher-ups were to learn of this, there would definitely be executions.

“If we don’t do this, how am I supposed to resolve my fury?” demanded Ye Lingfeng.

“But this is too much. It will definitely startle the higher-ups…”

“What are you afraid of?! What do you think Long Chen came here for? The Long family is clearly trying to restrict us. Putting it bluntly, we represent the Ye family, and he represents the Long family. We’re the chess pieces of these two families, and now we have to see which one of us beats the other. Since Long Chen was the one to not care about the rules first, he can’t blame us for being vicious. Do you think the higher-ups don’t know about our fight with the eighth legion? They are well aware. As long as we don’t personally kill anyone, what can they say?” A sinister smile appeared on Ye Lingfeng’s face.

“But if it’s further investigated, we…” The vice commander did not want to end up becoming a scapegoat over this matter. That kind of death would be far too sullen.

Perhaps the commander would be spared, but he and the other vice commander would be in danger. After all, a scapegoat had to be a perfect fit that wasn’t too big to be important but not too small to seem inconsequential. The vice commander position was a perfect fit for such a thing.

Ye Lingfeng sneered, “Do you have a problem with your head? Don’t you remember how Long Chen just conned us? Even if it’s investigated, we will say that the heavy losses we took meant that we had to take some drastic measures to make up for it. We launched a large sneak attack while our enemies were paralyzed. There were no problems around our strategy, but suddenly some unexpected things occurred, resulting in some of the demonic beasts breaking out of the encirclement and charging into the eighth legion’s camp. Who can guarantee that a battle will go according to plan? Who can guarantee that no accidents will occur? Since that’s the case, who can say anything? At worst, we’ll just have to give some compensation. No matter how much that compensation is, do you think the Ye family won’t support us in secret?”

The vice commander immediately said, “The commander is wise.”

“Hurry up!” Ye Lingfeng waved his hand, sending him off. He clenched his fists. “Long Chen, I’ll teach you what regret is.”

…

The demonic beasts had grown in number over the past few days. The battle last time had made them wary. Shen Chengfeng had found that there were even more demonic beasts guarding their old camp. Clearly, they also knew that the eighth legion might want to reclaim it.

“Chengfeng, isn’t this strange? You’ve killed so many demonic beasts. Why haven’t any of the stronger members of the demonic beasts come?” asked Long Chen.

“Due to the immense battle that occurred here, the laws have created a suppression so that even existences that surpass the Netherpassage realm are suppressed back to the level of the Netherpassage realm. That’s why we won’t encounter any experts on that level. The human race is the same. Those above the Netherpassage realm will also be suppressed. If they came, it would be dangerous for them. For example, if it was you and you were suppressed to the Xiantian realm, wouldn’t you feel wronged if you then died to a group of Xiantian rookies?” explained Shen Chengfeng.

“Ah, I see.” Long Chen nodded.

“That’s not all. The Ancient Battlefield has countless mystical places. Some regions will strip a person of their Spiritual Strength, and some are cut off from the Heavenly Daos. Some places will essentially turn you into a mortal. To sum up, there are far too many unknowns about this place, and the demonic beasts are in our way if we want to go deeper. As a result, this battle has continued for countless years. The demonic beasts prevent us from exploring the entire Ancient Battlefield. Only those on the level of senior Feng Fei dare to enter its depths,” sighed Shen Chenfeng.

“Is Feng Fei truly so powerful?” Long Chen frowned. Based on Shen Chengfeng’s tone, it was like Feng Fei was a god.

“It’s not just that she’s powerful, it’s that she’s so powerful that it brings forth despair. You’ve never seen her fight, so you don’t know. But based on my understanding of the two of you, I still feel like she’s above you. Your chances of winning would be less than twenty percent,” said Shen Chengfeng sincerely.

“It seems that she really is powerful,” said Long Chen. For someone as steady as Shen Chengfeng to say such a thing after seeing him fight meant that she was truly powerful.

Shen Chengfeng suddenly looked at him so oddly that Long Chen started to get goosebumps. “What are you looking at me like that for?”

Shen Chengfeng looked around, and seeing no one around, he whispered, “I’ve heard that brother Long is unparalleled at picking up girls. Let me tell you, if you could seduce… cough, if you could move her heart, you would no longer have any enemies.”

“What?! Where did you hear that from?” Long Chen almost spat. When had he earned the title of unparalleled at picking up girls? Whoever had come up with that definitely wanted him to be beaten up.

“Hehe, does this need to be said? You have so many heavenly fairies by your side who love you so deeply. Who else has that ability? Senior Feng Fei is very prideful, so most people aren’t qualified to even enter her sight. If you could obtain her heart, you would truly be a tiger with wings. In my eyes, your talent isn’t inferior to hers. You are only lacking her support.”

Long Chen shook his head. “I, Long Chen, don’t need to do such a thing, right? I’ve managed to keep my integrity until now even if I have nothing else. I won’t lower my head like that.”

“Sorry, I wasn’t trying to put it that way.” Shen Chengfeng apologized. Long Chen had his own pride. To rely on seducing a woman to climb was practically an insult to him.

It was true that whoever obtained Feng Fei’s favor would instantly become a dragon, but Long Chen disdained doing such a thing.

Despite Shen Chengfeng’s good intentions, the atmosphere was now a bit awkward. Long Chen said, “It’s fine. Let’s discuss how we’ll take back our camp.”

“Yes, let’s talk about real matters.” Shen Chengfeng hastily nodded, trying to forget about that awkward topic.

“Have you bought everything that I asked for?” asked Long Che

“Yes, but are those things really capable of taking back our territory?” asked Shen Chengfeng curiously.

The list that Long Chen had given him was full of nonsense to Shen Chengfeng. There were some random medicines, sulfur powder, lime dust, and most incomprehensible of all, gongs, drums, and firecrackers.

Even though he had questions, he had still bought them all. The divine families had everything except the firecrackers, so he had been forced to go to the Martial Heaven Continent to buy those.

“Alright, then I’ll teach you one more move today. Remember, those with powerful martial force don’t need to use their heads. There are only two reasons to do such a thing. One is if two sides are equally matched in power, so you need to use your head to increase your chances of victory. The other reason is to use the smallest price to make the greatest gains,” said Long Chen.

“Then we’re doing the latter this time?”

“No, we’re doing neither. I want to piss off Ye Lingfeng to the point that he simply dies from rage. I want Ye Lingfeng to know that the goal isn’t to play with him. The goal is to play him to death,” said Long Chen sinisterly. “Alright, let’s talk to our brothers about the plan. Tomorrow, we will reclaim our land. Get excited. I’ll bring you to play a game that will definitely stimulate you.”
