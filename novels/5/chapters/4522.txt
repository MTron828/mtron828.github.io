Chapter 4511 Heaven Earth Blood Spirit Mushroom

He jumped onto the cliff, which was the mountain peak of this little island. There, a black light and white light revolved around each other like two fish.

At the center of these two lights was a three-foot-tall blood-colored spirit mushroom. The divine lights flowed around it in a harmonious dance, resembling the interaction of the sun and moon, their rhythm seemingly influencing the cadence of heaven and earth.

Seeing that mushroom, Long Chen felt his head buzzing, and his mind went momentarily blank.

“Heaven Earth Blood Spirit Mushroom. Long Chen, you’ve struck gold.” The Earth Cauldron’s voice rang out, its voice laced with astonishment. Even in its seclusion in Long Chen’s mind-sea, the Earth Cauldron couldn’t help but feel shaken.

“Am I dreaming? Can I really be this lucky?” Long Chen hesitated to move, afraid of waking up from this seemingly wonderful dream.

“Don’t worry, you aren’t dreaming. This is the Heaven Earth Blood Spirit Mushroom, a Saint medicinal ingredient that ranks among the absolute top grade. Its tier far surpasses the Thousand Leaf Sacred Light Snow Lotus,” assured the Earth Cauldron.

“Is it the new year? Do I also get some good fortune?” Long Chen exclaimed, his emotion overcoming him.

After being bound by bad luck for so long, he almost didn’t know how to handle such a fortuitous encounter.

The Heaven Earth Blood Spirit Mushroom was one of the most important ingredients for the Nirvanic Charge Pill, so Long Chen couldn’t believe he would directly encounter it upon his arrival in this world.

“It holds the power to twist heaven and earth. Ranked top-grade among Saint medicinal ingredients, the Heaven Earth Blood Spirit Mushroom has exceedingly high requirements for its environment, and its growth rate is exceptionally slow. It has three leaves, which means that it has lived for three hundred million years. As a fully matured one has nine leaves, this Heaven Earth Blood Spirit Mushroom is still in its infancy. Of course, that’s not an issue for you. Your primal chaos space can let it rapidly grow,” explained the Earth Cauldron.

Long Chen was overjoyed to hear that. However, just as he took out his jade shovel, the Earth Cauldron stopped him.

“If you touch it like that, it will immediately die!”

“What?” Long Chen was so startled that he almost dropped the shovel.

“The Heaven Earth Blood Spirit Mushroom can only be absorbed using the universal power of heaven and earth. If any other power extracts it, it will instantly lose its balance and die. As a result, many people don’t even dare to touch it if they find it, opting instead to absorb its universe divine extract. That’s a priceless treasure coveted by countless people,” explained the Earth Cauldron.

“Universal power of heaven and earth? What is that?” asked Long Chen. He had never heard of such a thing.

“It’s not possible to explain it in just a few words. You won’t understand. Putting it simply, it is a merger of soft and hard energy. I am the Earth Cauldron, and I can teach you a way to use this power. Just channel your energy, and leave the control to me,” said the Earth Cauldron.

New information flooded Long Chen’s mind, and he hastily focused on absorbing this information. As Long Chen merged with this information, his whole power instantly ignited.

The Earth Cauldron had said that the method of using this energy was challenging to grasp. However, Long Chen mastered it instantly, so he thought that the Earth Cauldron had helped him somehow. Little did he know, the Earth Cauldron hadn’t played any part in it.

Long Chen sensed his body temperature rising, as if he had been tossed into a pool of lava. However, he felt full of power.

This power was of the supreme Yang type, possessing explosive and unyielding characteristics. Long Chen had never experienced this kind of power before. It felt like this power contained a will to destroy all things—a domineeringness that said “follow me and prosper, defy me and die.”

Long Chen trembled, his body seemingly beyond his control as an ancient rune manifested on his right hand. This rune was one of the runes on the Earth Cauldron, but it had been dormant until this very moment.

…

As the rune on Long Chen’s hand lit up, in a distant world, amid endless darkness, another bronze cauldron that looked identical to the Earth Cauldron quivered ever so slightly.

This bronze cauldron exuded an aura completely different from that of the Earth Cauldron. It was wild, domineering, and cold-blooded. Every rune on it resembled ferocious beasts thirsting for the nourishment of fresh blood—an embodiment of a fiend from hell. Instinctual cravings for killing and slaughter emanated from it

If Long Chen saw it, he would definitely cry out in shock. He had previously sold this exact cauldron—the Heaven Cauldron.

“I’ve waited trillions of years. You’ve finally appeared.”

The bronze cauldron’s voice rang out in the distance, each word dripping with bloodthirst and every syllable resembling the overture of slaughter. The will to destroy heaven and earth overflowed in its utterances.

…

Long Chen didn’t know that another bronze cauldron had sensed him when that rune appeared on his palm. All he knew was that the rune triggered the ignition of all his power, causing his heart to pound wildly. The realization that this rune could ignite his full power was beyond anything he had ever dreamed of.

It had to be known that up to this point, Long Chen didn’t have something that could channel all his different powers into one.

Whether it was his astral energy, his dragon blood energy, his violet blood energy, his seven-color Supreme Blood energy, or even his flame energy or thunderforce, they needed to be unleashed with their own techniques.

For example, Long Chen could unleash his dragon blood power through Dragon Roars at the Nine Heavens, Divine Dragon Tail Pendulum, and the Cloud Dragon Immolation Claw, but even after using all three, his dragon blood energy wouldn’t be fully exhausted.

Long Chen’s power had gotten to the point where he could engage in prolonged battles. Yet, this strength also harbored a fatal weakness—he couldn't unleash his full power all at once.

His strongest move now would have to be the nine forms of Split the Heavens. Only this technique could instantly unleash the full power of his stars in one move.

However, the condition to execute such a move was to possess a weapon capable of withstanding that torrent of power. Until now, he had not come across a weapon capable of meeting this requirement. Even a Saint weapon might prove insufficient for the task.

Therefore, this single rune brought a shocking revelation to Long Chen. It could transcend the limits among different energies, merging all his powers into one, including his unique astral energy.𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

In other words, all his power could be unleashed through this one rune. The prospect left Long Chen on the verge of exclaiming in amazement. If he could unleash all of his power at once, the resulting attack…

“Concentrate!”

The Earth Cauldron’s voice interrupted his wild thoughts, prompting Long Chen to hastily focus on the rune on his palm.

Suddenly, a rune on the Earth Cauldron also lit up. As this rune glowed, the rune in Long Chen’s hand responded to the summons, causing two streams of energy to merge into one.

“This is… Earth energy!”
