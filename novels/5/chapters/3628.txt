Chapter 3617

“Dean Long Chen…”

This time, even the expressions of the Celestial Essence Sect’s patriarch and the others changed. This was an entirely new level of strictness.

“They are only fools manipulated by others. Dean Long Chen, please spare their lives.” A half-step Divine Venerate couldn’t help pleading for mercy for them.

“If their lives are spared, who will spare ours? Even if they were manipulated by others, they have earned their deaths.”

Long Chen’s expression was dark. He pointed at that group of terrified protestors. “You are the trash of the human race. I don’t see you setting foot on the battlefield. I don’t see you when we need to raise funds and resources. Just who gave you the courage to come here and so arrogantly criticize others? If you can’t help when we need aid and can’t even pretend to be extras on the same side, then all you can be is vile people dragging down the human race. You sow chaos within the human race. Ever since ancient times, an army could never be controlled by compassion. Anyone who tries to shake the hearts of the army must be slain. I don’t care if they were manipulated or if they are simply trolls who need to shout. For them to come out at this time, kill them all.”

Long Chen’s words were like rolling thunder shaking people’s ears. It contained endless killing intent that made people’s souls quiver.

“We all know that they’re hateful. But many of them are innocent. Can you not give them a chance?” pleaded that half-step Divine Venerate.

“Haha, innocent? Give them a chance? Has your mind grown muddled with age? Don’t you remember why Xia Guhong left back then?” barked Long Chen.

When Long Chen mentioned Xia Guhong, those people fell silent. Back then, Xia Guhong was not willing to tolerate all the slander that people like this had thrown at him. He had done so much for these people, but rather than gratitude, he faced such treatment. In his fury, he directly left, allowing these people to destroy themselves.

“You say that they are innocent? After Xia Guhong left, the human race lost huge swathes of territory. Cities and strongholds were lost. How many people have died over the years because of that? How many generations of people fell to the hands of the Alldevil race? Tell me, did those descendants who never slandered or questioned anyone deserve to lose their lives because of their ancestors’ folly? Are they innocent?” demanded Long Chen, staring at this half-step Divine Venerate who had spoken out from a sense of righteousness.

That elder was completely red and couldn’t say a single word. Xia Guhong and Luo Qingying had always been a sore point in the hearts of the human race of the Alldevil Star-Field.

To the outside world, the Alldevil Star-Field was still called the Hongying Star-Field as a testament of their contributions for the people. One acted for her family, the other acted for his love, but both of them shook the world and obtained the recognition of everyone.

But the people that they had done so much for were precisely the ones to drive them away. They had torn down their own walls. They were pitiful and hateful idiots.

Long Chen’s words woke countless people up to this. Was this not the same path that Xia Guhong had walked down back then?

Back then, Xia Guhong didn’t even care about the suspicions and slander of a few random people. It was later when this slander spread like a vicious poison throughout the human race that his heart grew cold. Everyone talked about it, and the number of people who believed it increased. It was because over half of the human race here began to question Xia Guhong that he left.

Everyone looked at Long Chen and thought of Xia Guhong. Was history not replaying itself? However, Long Chen’s methods were not the same as Xia Guhong’s.

“Give them another chance? If I gave them another chance, they would have another chance to do this. Can it be that we have to expose our strategies and plans to everyone before they can progress? Do we need a public proclamation? To prove our innocence, can it be that they have to talk to eighteen generations of my ancestors before trusting me? Those who want to have mercy on them, are you not idiots? Do you have brains? If we went back in time to the era of Xia Guhong and Luo Qingying, it would be fools like you that caused the deaths of so many of your descendants. You would be the sinners of the era.” Long Chen pointed at that half-step Divine Venerate and cursed him. Despite all those curses, that elder remained silent. His expression was one of shame, and he lowered his head.

Long Chen’s words were correct. Their predecessors had made this mistake, and they wanted Long Chen to make the same mistake. It was practically an unforgivable sin.

“I came to lead this battle due to the dean of the Heavenly Dragon Divine Armor College entrusting this task to me. I already told you that if you want to follow me, you better do it obediently. If you don’t want to follow me, then scram. I am different from big brother Xia Guhong. He is an unrivaled hero with a vast heart. I cannot possibly reach his level in this lifetime. My authority is supreme here, so don’t talk to me about freedom of speech or having a right to know the truth. You have no right to raise suspicions here. This world does need different voices, but freedom of speech does not permit malicious sneers, curses, slanders, and defamation. People like you drove away big brother Xia Guhong with this, but it won’t work on me. Anyone who dares to try will be directly killed. Kill those people. I want to use their blood to warn the world that foolish actions have a price. If anyone begs for mercy for them, kill them as well.” Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

Upon thinking of how Xia Guhong had been driven off in a rage because of people like this, ultimately losing his lover because of this war and spending a lifetime depressed, Long Chen’s killing intent raged.

Xia Guhong was an unrivaled hero. Thinking of how he had lost so much due to these people, Long Chen felt great injustice for him. Now that they tried to do the same thing to him, he treated them with no compassion at all.

The starry river warriors immediately followed his orders. As a result, arrows rained down and screams followed.

“No, don’t kill us! They gave us money! No, not money, they threatened our families-!”

It would have been better if that person hadn’t opened his mouth. As soon as he did, it exposed their greedy nature. At first, the starry river warriors also felt a bit unwilling to kill them. But his words fully infuriated them, and they slaughtered these people.

These people were inciting hatred within the human race for profit? It would be unjust to not kill them.

In just a few breaths’ time, those protestors were slain. Their corpses were piled up, and their blood soaked the land. Everyone was silent.

Long Chen coldly announced, “Those that trust me should follow me obediently. Those that don’t trust me should find another path. Starting today, I will not allow any questioning voices. As for whether or not my actions are correct today, whether or not I will be denounced in historical records, the future will tell. I have never cared about reputation. That is dogshit to me.”

Everyone was deathly silent. This black-robed youngster was absolutely terrifying. He ordered the deaths of millions of people without batting an eye. His killing intent terrified them.

“Starry River Legion, assemble!” shouted Long Chen suddenly.

A hundred thousand starry river warriors immediately gathered according to a troop formation. All of them were in their armors and ready for combat.

“Starry river warriors, follow me into battle!”

BOOM!

Suddenly, the Heavenly Dragon Domain’s barrier quivered. Light fell from it, landing on the Starry River Legion. All of them instantly vanished.

“Everyone, we are only witnesses to this era. We’re not the leaders. Let’s calm down and just enjoy the show!” Xue Yifan smiled. He was the only one here who knew where Long Chen had gone.

Just then, a tablet began to flash on the waist of the Celestial Essence Sect’s patriarch. His expression completely changed.

“Not good! The Celestial Essence Domain is under attack! We have to send reinforcements!”
