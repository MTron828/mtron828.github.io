Chapter 2904 Mu Qingyun vs. Gu Fei

Mu Qingyun was originally the closest behind Long Chen as her Spiritual Strength was stronger than the others.

Hence, after Long Chen was schemed against and sent back, Mu Qingyun quickly arrived. But Chu Kuang and the others had started activating the other lamps.

If they managed to light five of the eight lamps, then the lamp that Long Chen had lit would be extinguished, and the seal belonging to the Unfettered Alliance would also be erased. At that time, a barrier would appear around the altar, protecting Chu Kuang’s side. If that was the case, fighting over the flag would require breaking through the barrier, and that would increase the difficulty even more.

Chu Kuang and the others had ignited two lamps. With over four hundred of them present, igniting another three lamps would be easy. And once that happened, the barrier would appear, and it would be as difficult as ascending the heavens for Long Chen’s side to take the flag.

“Stop her! Don’t let her get close to the altar,” ordered Chu Kuang.

They couldn’t allow anyone to attack the altar at this time, or the lamp-lighting would pause. Moreover, the ones that were already lit would also be extinguished, and they would need to restart.

“Leave it to me.” Gu Fei flew out, blocking her path.

“The number two expert of the God Institute? Nothing more than a frog at the bottom of a well. I didn’t get to beat Luo Bing this time, so I’ll have to use you to show her that if it weren’t for this strategy, she would have been crushed beneath my feet.” Gu Fei sneered and a rune appeared on his forehead, flowing with immortal qi. As he formed hand seals, runic swords condensed in the air.

“Heavens, runes condensing into swords! He can already control the power of his divine flame?! Isn’t that a power that someone can only unlock after reaching the Divine Flame realm?”

The disciples outside cried out in shock. Gu Fei was using a magical art that normally only people in the Divine Flame realm could use.

“Long Chen was right. This fellow has been hiding his true power,” said Luo Bing.

“Then it’s a real pity. Our bloodlines have been activated. If you fought him, you’d definitely win,” said Luo Ning, clenching her teeth.

The two of them were originally very confident in beating Gu Fei and the others, but the result was that just as they prepared to strike, the other side actually abandoned them, making them feel terrible.

Now, seeing the Unfettered Alliance in crisis, they could only sit and watch as spectators. That feeling was truly unbearable.

Back to the battlefield, Mu Qingyun’s expression was icy. However, her footsteps didn’t pause, and she continued rushing forward. Her hand slowly reached back for her sword.

“Ignorant. I’ll make you pay the price for that ignorance.” Gu Fei sneered and suddenly changed hand seals. As a result, a runic sword from behind him suddenly shot out at Mu Qingyun.

However, as the sound of a sword leaving its sheathe rang out, a streak of cold light flashed through the air. The image of a half moon appeared, crumbling Gu Fei’s runic sword.

The half moon continued without pause toward Gu Fei. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

Seeing this scene, he was shocked. This was just a probing blow, but it was also an attempt to stop her in her tracks.

It was because he viewed this clash as a performance for Luo Bing to see. He wanted her to see the difference between them, as he still had some regret in his heart over not getting to fight her this time.

However, he had never expected this. According to his estimate, even if he couldn’t force back Mu Qingyun with this attack, he should have been able to make her pause. But his attack had no effect at all.

With the half moon slashing toward him, he instinctively dodged to the side. All of a sudden, his ear turned cold, but something warm dripped down.

After that, he saw his ear lying on the ground as well as his blood. It was only then that he sensed a sharp pain.

The disciples outside were all stunned. Mu Qingyun’s sword-light was actually so powerful that it could ignore the runic sword.

“The runic sword is condensed from the power of the Heavenly Daos. It relies on the merger between a person’s core energy and their spiritual will to draw out the power of the Heavenly Daos. The power of the runic sword depends on the cultivation base of the user. For it to be unable to bear a single blow isn’t because this magical art is weak, but because the difference in wills between the two sides is too great,” explained Heaven Master Yun Yang.

This explanation made people come to an understanding of just how powerful the will was, as well as what exactly it was.

“Slut, you’re courting death!” Gu Fei was enraged. This was originally just a performance to him, but he ended up losing face instead. In his fury, he suddenly extended his hand, and another runic sword appeared in it. He then slashed it down in front of him.

As the sword in his hand moved, the dozens of other runic swords shot out like bolts of lightning at Mu Qingyun.

Mu Qingyun’s sword danced, blocking those runic swords, and they were destroyed rapidly.

BOOM!

Sparks exploded between Mu Qingyun’s sword and the sword in Gu Fei’s hand. This sword was a real sword.

“So we were tricked by Gu Fei. The reason he can condense those runic swords is because of that divine weapon in his hands!” A startled cry rang out.

Gu Fei’s Spirit item was as treasure, possessing innate magical runes capable of summoning runic swords, which didn’t possess their own substantial bodies.

His sword was the mother sword, while the runic swords that it summoned were the sword children. Hence, the effect was almost the same as runic swords condensed by the magical art.

The main difference was that runic swords condensed from the magical art would grow stronger with the user’s cultivation base, will, and comprehension of the Heavenly Daos. But the technique used by relying on a weapon did not get stronger like that.

Despite that, this sword was definitely an absolute treasure. Mu Qingyun was knocked back by it, but Gu Fei also suffered. His blood surged tumultuously inside of him, and he was also shocked to find a tiny nick in his sword.

This infuriated and aggrieved him. This was a treasure from his family, and he had actually borrowed it from an expert in his family for the immortal competition. With it damaged, how was he supposed to explain himself to his family?

Mu Qingyun was knocked back, but her reaction was far faster. Taking advantage of Gu Fei’s alarmed emotions, she slashed a ray of sword-light onto the altar.

As a result, the altar shuddered, and all the lamps that the Prime Glory Alliance’s disciples had been working hard to ignite instantly extinguished just as the fifth lamp began to light up. All their efforts were for nothing.

Chu Kuang was infuriated. The barrier was interrupted just as it was on the verge of appearing, so he cursed, “Gu Fei, are you useless?! You couldn’t even block her?!”

Upon hearing this, Gu Fei’s fury soared. Killing intent appeared in his eyes. After that, a rune ignited on his forehead, and divine light bloomed out of his sword.

“Die!”

Gu Fei's sword slashed through the air, unleashing waves of ripples in the air. An incomparably sharp aura locked onto Mu Qingyun.

“Not good!” Luo Bing’s expression changed, and she shot up.
