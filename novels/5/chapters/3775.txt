Chapter 3764: Land of Buried Corpses

“Respected guests, I can only send you this far. I wish you good fortune.” The elder bowed to Long Chen.

Long Chen hastily returned the bow. “I truly have to thank you.”

This single transportation had saved him at least half a month. That was of immense help.

When the elder left, Long Chen took out the map. He found that this place was only three days away from the Heavenly River Blood Sea.

“Boss, I don’t understand. The Spirit race clearly has so many terrifying existences. Why are they willing to be bullied by others?” asked Jiang Lei.

Even if Jiang Lei counted out the elder who had brought them here, in their prayer land, he had seen at least hundreds of Divine Venerates. There were also many Supreme experts, so he didn’t understand this.

“The Spirit race has many branches within, and some of them don’t dare to touch the air of death. They would rather die than kill someone. There are also some that are immensely powerful and possess killer divine abilities. They won’t be the slightest bit merciful. For example, the Stone Spirit race, the Elven Spirit race, and also some of the giant humanoid races. They are all not afraid of being exposed to the resentment air of death. However, killing for too long will cause them to gradually grow irritable. Their inner hearts will no longer be pure. Thus, they will intermittently find those pure-hearted members of the Spirit race to help them cleanse that irritable qi within them. That will prevent them from becoming bloodthirsty devils. In truth, the Spirit race has kind spirits and evil spirits. We’ve only encountered the kind ones so far. It is said that the evil spirits were corrupted experts of the Spirit race who became violent and bloodthirsty. The only way for them to drain off that desire is to kill. To put it frankly, it is the result of suppressing and accumulating darkness within themselves for too long. Once it erupts, it turns them into a devil. They can never be pure again,” said Long Chen.

Jiang Lei suddenly said, “I remember! I was chased down by a humanoid ominous spirit. At that time, I was in the Four Peak realm and powerless to resist. But just as its wooden arrow stabbed through my body, it said something incomprehensible to me. I didn’t understand what it was saying at all, and then it let me go. But all the members of the human race in that area were killed by it. Now that I think back to it, perhaps it only didn’t kill me because I had the mark of the Spirit race on me.”

“That means its inner heart wasn’t fully devoured yet. It still retained some…”

Long Chen’s body suddenly quivered. He was about to say that its inner heart still retained some kindness. That was the pure land in its heart. Thinking of that, he thought of what the woman told him.

“Is it because I called the Spirit race’s kindness as a pure land that she transmitted the Nirvana Scripture to me?”

Long Chen felt an indescribable feeling toward that mysterious woman. Sometimes that feeling was clear, but sometimes it was vague. It was like there was a tie inside his soul that could solve this riddle, but no matter how he tried to grasp it, he couldn’t.

“Have you recovered to your peak condition?” asked Long Chen.

“During the prayer, the divine light fully healed me,” said Jiang Lei.

“Good. Prepare to have a terrible battle. Let’s go.”

Long Chen and Jiang Lei headed straight toward the Heavenly River Blood Sea. They didn’t bother concealing their presence.

After flying for a day, the pungent scent of blood filled the air, and strange energy currents began to appear in the void. Space was no longer completely stable.𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“This isn’t good. Boss, it seems that this space will not allow transportation talismans to be used.” Jiang Lei’s expression changed. Xia Chen’s transportation formations were life-saving treasures. They hadn’t even reached the Heavenly River Blood Sea yet, but this trump card was already lost.

“You’re right. But since we’ve come, we can only barge in. Don’t worry, it is too big for the demonic beasts to fully block it. Furthermore, the core region will only allow Divine Lords to enter once it starts to surge. Those elders won’t be able to interfere. It is very difficult for the demonic beasts to guard such a huge area, and the human race also has experts with powerful physical bodies. Can they really block them all?” Long Chen wasn’t worried.

They continued flying. At this moment, the ground began to change color. Blood-colored currents appeared.

Long Chen even saw the mouth of a spring. Liquid was coming out of it just like fresh blood from underground. Rivers flowed toward the core.

Long Chen then reached out and lifted a handful of this blood-colored liquid. He sniffed it and suddenly reached back into the liquid.

The earth quivered and cracks spread. As Long Chen increased his power, the earth bulged. An enormous existence was forcibly ripped out of the ground.

It was an enormous skeleton. It looked to be a winged dragon. However, its tail was not in the right proportion. Its tip was sharp, and it even had a coccyx the shape of a palm leaf. Long Chen didn’t recognize this lifeform.

The skeleton was decaying and filled with holes like a honeycomb. But there were still many runes emitting a powerful aura despite the encroachment of time.

“It probably isn’t an ordinary Divine Venerate.” Long Chen was shaken when he sensed this aura. It had been millions and millions of years. However, the corpse still existed, and its runes were intact. That meant that the master of this corpse was a supremely terrifying existence.

Long Chen then tossed the corpse into the primal chaos space’s black soil. However, he was disappointed. After it was devoured, it didn’t unleash any life energy. Although the corpse was intact, its power was already used up.

When Long Chen pulled out the corpse, the spring on the ground stopped emitting blood liquid. It was like the spring was linked to the corpse.

“It seems that the Spirit race’s senior is right.”

Jiang Lei eyed the endless streams of blood stretching beyond the horizon. If every stream represented a corpse, then there could very well be a billion bodies.

Long Chen and Jiang Lei pressed on. More streams appeared until they formed an enormous river. The roaring spray of the river sounded like countless fierce beasts roaring.

The murderous and brutal air grew stronger and stronger. Furthermore, even the sky became the color of blood. It was like the entire world was pressing down, giving people a suffocating feeling.

After another day, Long Chen and Jiang Lei encountered two squads of demonic beasts patrolling the area. However, even the strongest amongst them was merely a mid stage World King. The two of them instantly wiped them out.

In the end, Long Chen saw an endless sea. Blood-colored mist rose out of the sea and linked with the sky. This was a blood-colored world.

Long Chen had just arrived at the Heavenly River Blood Sea when he was spotted. Tens of thousands of demonic beasts roared and attacked them.
