Chapter 3687 High Firmament, Jade Void, Limitless

“Oh? Please go ahead,” said Long Chen.

“Previously, dean Long Chen mentioned this part of the Tea Scripture: from above, achieve the Dao, ascend to the heavenly palace; from the center, achieve the Dao, become an immortal in the southern palace; from below, achieve the Dao, live forever within the world. This line is denounced by countless cultivators in the current era. To tell the truth, I’ve asked many famous scholars about this line, and they also scoff at it. It… it’s very displeasing!” said the patriarch.

While he said that it was very displeasing, in truth, during those times, he ended up turning hostile with those people. But unable to beat them or out-curse them, he could only swallow this grievance and leave.

Later on, he no longer asked for anyone else’s teachings and directly set up his Tea Divine School, turning himself into the founding patriarch and viewing the Tea Saint as a god. He then swore to bring the Tea Dao to glory.

Today, he actually heard this line once more from Long Chen, so he couldn’t help but ask it. “I very much want to know what your understanding of this line is.”

The distant experts and the Wine God Palace’s experts all looked at Long Chen. The Tea Saint’s Dao was too profound and obscure. In fact, it went so far as to be contrary to popular opinion on the Dao. Most people thought it was just crazy words, so they were all curious about what Long Chen would say about it.

Long Chen smiled. “This line is not accepted by others due to being too wildly arrogant. It’s normal for people to not approve of it. From above, achieve the Dao, ascend to the heavenly palace; from the center, achieve the Dao, become an immortal in the southern palace; from below, achieve the Dao, live forever within the world. On the surface, it sounds as if he has the utmost confidence in his Tea Scripture, as well as utmost arrogance. However, most people have misunderstood the Tea Saint’s meaning. This line is in the final part of the Tea Scripture. However, it is not referring to the Tea Scripture. There’s no mention that one has to use the Tea Dao to pursue the Heavenly Daos. When he said achieve the Dao, he was including all ten thousand Daos, not just the Tea Dao. However, due to not comprehending the Tea Scripture, many people formed a biased opinion of the Tea Saint. A single leaf in front of their eyes blocked their vision of the mountain.”

“After achieving the Dao, can one really ascend to the heavenly palace, become an immortal in the southern palace, and live forever in the world?” asked the patriarch.

“Do you know the meaning of ascending to the heavenly palace, becoming immortal in the southern palace, and living forever in the world?” asked Long Chen.

“We… actually, I don’t really understand it,” said the patriarch. He wanted to say that he did, but it couldn’t possibly be as simple as he thought, so he didn’t say he understood in order to not lose face when he was wrong.

Long Chen said, “When it says ascend to the heavenly palace, the heavenly palace refers to becoming a celestial god, a god in charge of the laws of the nine heavens. You can take it to mean being the master of the entire world. The southern palace refers to the High Firmament Palace of the era of legends. It is also called the heavenly palace. Become an immortal refers to becoming an Immortal of the heavens. If the heavenly palace is the master, then the immortal of the southern palace is the administrator outside of the heavenly palace. However, there is also another saying when it comes to the southern palace. It is said that within the world of the nine heavens, there is a supreme divine world with five palaces. The central High Firmament Palace, the southern Jade Void Palace, and the northern Limitless Palace. The Jade Void Palace is the southern palace, the entrance to the heavenly palace, and the life gate. The Limitless Palace is its opposite, the death gate. Life and death face each other. Thus, to become an immortal in the southern palace can be taken to mean standing outside the Jade Void Palace’s gates, to being a single gate away from the High Firmament Palace. As for achieving the Dao from below and living forever in this world, it should refer to a longevity even greater than an ordinary cultivator. Once one comprehends the essence of the Heavenly Daos, they will possess a heart as calm as water, and their longevity will stretch far into the distance. These are all my personal opinions on this line. As for whether this line really does mean this, perhaps only the Tea Saint himself knows.”

Long Chen’s words dumbfounded countless experts. The things that Long Chen was talking about were things that these old fellows that had lived for countless years had never even heard of.ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

“Dean Long Chen, do the five palaces really exist? Is the High Firmament Academy related to the High Firmament Palace?” asked one of those elders in the distance, unable to contain his curiosity. This elder was a half-step Divine Venerate whose hair was as white as snow, yet his tone was exceptionally polite.

Long Chen smiled bitterly. “Who knows if the five palaces really exist? These are merely some introductions that I read in the High Firmament Academy’s tomes. But this information is basically from legends and myths. There’s not much basis for them. However, some stories are closely linked to each other. When taken together, they are worth thinking over. In particular, there is a repeated mention of the five palaces and eight gates. Isn’t it interesting to think about such a thing? Regretfully, the records of these legends are one-sided. We can only see things from a narrow view and not the full picture. Thus, when it comes to the stories of legend, my attitude is that you cannot not believe them, but you also cannot fully believe them. As for whether the High Firmament Academy is related to the legendary High Firmament Palace, to tell the truth, I really don’t know. In any case, after flipping through many ancient tomes, I was unable to find any connection between the two. Everyone, if you’re interested, you can go to the High Firmament Academy as a guest. Again, as long as you go with goodwill, my High Firmament Academy will not disappoint you.”

“As expected of the youngest dean in the High Firmament Academy’s history. This understanding and magnanimity are admirable. This old man is too old to cross the devil sea, nor can I endure the impact of crossing the wall between heavens. I’ll never be able to go to the Darklight Heaven in this lifetime. But I’ll definitely send a good disciple as a representative to pay my respects,” said the elder.

The Darklight Heaven had a powerful wall separating it from the Violet Flame Heaven. Because of it, those beneath the Immortal King realm could pass through easily, but above the World King realm, passing through that wall came at a terrifying price. One mistake and he would lose his life.

Perhaps if a World King that was extremely weak tried to pass it, it would be easier. But the stronger the World King, the greater the resistance. Half-step Divine Venerates like themselves would simply be sending themselves to their deaths if they tried to barge through that wall.

Thus, they had no hopes of ever personally going to the High Firmament Academy in this lifetime. They could only send their own disciples.

Although they knew that the High Firmament Academy was the number one academy of the nine heavens and ten lands, the academy with the most ancient inheritance, as time passed, it had declined. People might not mention it once in a thousand years, so some people had gradually forgotten about it.

Now that Long Chen mentioned so many things from the era of legend, people instantly thought of this ancient academy. Its foundation was unimaginable. 

Furthermore, the High Firmament Academy always welcomed other sects to learn and study together. Countless people started to think about going to take a look.

“Senior, can you tell me whether or not we should enter the three thousand worlds?” asked Qing Yu suddenly.

“You? I suggest you not to. I’ll put it frankly… you are lacking. Without your patriarch’s protection, you’d have long since been sent on the way to reincarnation. The three thousand worlds will have countless vicious characters, so your chances of surviving inside are exceedingly low. I feel like you should peacefully go study scripture in the Darklight Heaven,” said Long Chen.

“Alright, I’ll listen to senior. Patriarch, disciple will leave right now. I will definitely bring back the complete Tea Scripture for you,” promised Qing Yu. He didn’t show the slightest regret at not entering the three thousand worlds.

The patriarch once more thanked Long Chen before bringing his disciples away. After sending them off, Long Chen returned to the primal chaos space, whereupon he was shocked at what he saw.

“What is this?”
