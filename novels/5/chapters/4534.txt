Chapter 4523 Red-Haired Man

The Heavenly Corrupt Sect’s millions and millions of experts were gathering, and their weakest experts were those in the World King realm.

“Damn, what are they doing?”

Long Chen was startled by this disturbance. He wanted to grab one of them and do a soulsearch, but he was afraid of being noticed.

“It seems they’re about to go to war! Is that why they can’t deal with me?”

Although Long Chen didn’t know what the Heavenly Corrupt Sect was doing, for them to gather so many experts, they were very likely going to war.

That was the only reason why they wouldn’t spend more time searching for him. Based on the information Long Chen had gained, he discerned the path he had taken led to the Heavenly Corrupt Sect’s administrative section.

According to reason, this was Long Chen’s best chance to either escape or sneak attack the Heavenly Corrupt Sect. However, Long Chen didn’t do so and chose to follow this army.

Long Chen had countless medicinal pills on him, and some were for concealing his aura. These medicinal pills had even deceived a terrifying assassin like Ying Tian, so tricking the likes of these people was simple.

On the second day, following behind this army, Long Chen saw a shocking scene. The huge army actually merged with another.

The two armies started with equal numbers. After assembling, they underwent a brief reorganization before advancing once again. Then came a third merge, followed by a fourth... Long Chen found himself in disbelief. By the fifth merge, their forces had expanded significantly, finally joining the main army, which was thousands of times larger. They were like streams gradually converging into a mighty river.

“How can the Heavenly Corrupt Sect’s foundation be so terrifying?!”

Although Long Chen had done multiple soulsearches, it seemed that many of the Heavenly Corrupt Sect’s disciples didn’t actually know the full extent of the Heavenly Corrupt Sect’s power.

Furthermore, Long Chen sensed a squad of supreme experts numbering over a hundred thousand World Kings. However, all the other experts of the Heavenly Corrupt Sect treated them reverently, including the Saints.

“There’s a Doyen with an even more terrifying aura than Ying Tian!” Long Chen sucked in a cold gasp of air when he spotted their leader.

It was a fair-faced, red-haired man with a skinny and lanky build. He had a crown on his head identical to the sect master’s crown and carried a giant scythe on his back.

It seemed that this man was the future heir to the Heavenly Corrupt Sect’s throne. Otherwise, he wouldn’t be qualified to wear that crown. That was why even Saints had to respectfully bow to him when they saw him.

Although this man didn’t intentionally release his aura, endless Heavenly Dao runes flowed around him as if prostrating at his very existence. This was something that hadn’t occurred even with Ying Tian.

While Long Chen had exchanged blows with Ying Tian twice, he knew that Ying Tian had not revealed his full power. However, just based on their Doyen aura, this person exceeded Ying Tian.

Of course, this didn’t mean that he was definitely stronger. After all, Ying Tian was an assassin, whose specialty was in concealing their power.

As long as Ying Tian didn’t reveal his full power, no one would know for sure.

However, as Long Chen possessed the Nine Star Hegemon Body Art, his senses were extremely sharp. Even at this immense distance, Long Chen felt like this person was definitely on the same level as Ying Tian or perhaps slightly stronger.

“I wonder what kind of Heavenly Doyen Fruit will I get when he dies?” Long Chen suddenly stared at this Doyen like he was a beautiful Heavenly Doyen Fruit. Long Chen almost started to drool.

Last time, Xia Chen had absorbed Long Chen’s most powerful Heavenly Doyen Fruit. After that, according to Xia Chen’s words, his power was at least ten times greater. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

So, despite being in the Dragonblood Legion for the shortest time and always spending time with an undependable fellow like Guo Ran, Xia Chen himself was very dependable.

When Guo Ran spoke, you had to question whether or not he was just bragging. However, when it came to Xia Chen, you had to wonder if he was severely underestimating his own abilities. If this fellow said that he was ten times stronger, then it probably wasn’t just ten times.

Thus, when Long Chen saw terrifying experts these days, all he could think of was how adorable they would be after becoming Heavenly Doyen Fruits.

Gulping his saliva, Long Chen continued to carefully follow them. As for the scythe-wielding man, he never had dreamed that another man would be drooling over him.

Three days later, the Heavenly Corrupt Sect’s army arrived at a mountain valley, and in front of them was an endless wasteland.

The army stopped at the border. At this moment, space twisted, revealing the sect master.

“Damn, the Heavenly Corrupt Sect’s territory is so huge, but he can simply appear wherever he wants according to his will?” Long Chen was stunned to see the sect master.

“Wait, no... that can’t be right... If he had that ability, how could he let me off?”

Long Chen quickly realized that he was wrong. All of a sudden, he looked down and saw a blood-colored totem beneath the sect master’s feet, so he immediately rolled his eyes. It seemed that it was simply a spatial transportation formation. Long Chen simply didn’t notice someone had tossed out this totem.

All the Heavenly Corrupt Sect’s disciples knelt toward their sect master, and only the scythe-wielding man continued to stand.

The sect master didn’t even look at these disciples. Instead, he went to the scythe-wielding man and offered a bow. Seeing this scene, Long Chen was left agape in astonishment.

However, when Long Chen looked at the disciples’ expressions, it seemed that this was a normal occurrence.

With a solemn expression, the sect master started speaking to the scythe-wielding man. Unfortunately, the distance was too far for Long Chen to hear anything.

After talking for a while, the scythe-wielding man shook his head, as if not approving of the sect master’s words. The sect master helplessly continued to advise him.

Long Chen somehow sensed that the sect master was talking about him. However, that young man was just sneering and waved his hand. After that, the enormous scythe appeared in his hand, and he pointed it forward.

Seeing this, the sect master could only sigh helplessly. He shouted, “All sons of our god have their destiny! Unleash your power to slaughter the mixed beast race! Offer them as sacrifices, destroy their divine lamp, and have the Corrupt God’s light ignite their divine pool!”

In response to the sect master’s fervent exhortation, a rune suddenly manifested on the scythe-wielding man’s forehead. After that, an ancient and sinister aura emanated from him.

As the scythe-wielding man chanted strange syllables, his intonations seemed to blend between a prayer and an ancestral sacrifice. The eerie combination sent shivers down Long Chen's spine.

Observing the Heavenly Corrupt Sect experts, Long Chen noticed a bizarre transformation taking place. Their eyes turned a vivid scarlet, resembling a descent into a state of madness.

“Kill!”

From top to bottom, including the sect master himself, everyone roared and charged toward the wasteland.

The moment they charged forward, roars also came from the depths of the wasteland. It felt like monstrous beasts from the desolate era were awakening, erupting with an instant explosion of killing intent.
