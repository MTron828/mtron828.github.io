Chapter 2455 The Miserable Heavenly Qilin Demon Fruit

Translator: BornToBe

With the threat of the flame dragon and the black soil, the Heavenly Qilin Demon Tree finally submitted.

Heavenly Qilin Demon Fruit fell from the giant tree one after another. With every single one, its aura clearly weakened a bit.

When it had said that every single one of these fruits were equivalent to a thousand years of its cultivation, it had been exaggerating slightly. However, the loss of even one of them was as painful as if a piece of it was being torn out.

There were over eight hundred Heavenly Qilin Demon Fruit. Once they were all taken out, the entire tree lost its luster as if it was on the verge of death.

“You… can let me off now.” The Heavenly Qilin Demon Tree’s voice was a bit hoarse.

Long Chen waved his hand, pulling the black soil into the primal chaos space. He also recalled Huo Ling-er.

“Why bother? I’m a very nice person. Have your subordinates bring out all the precious medicines here. Are you going to force me to do it myself?” asked Long Chen.

The old man of the Heavenly Qilin Demon Tree had now turned black. The invasion of the black soil’s Death Qi had reached a critical point.

With its Heavenly Qilin Demon Fruit taken away, erasing this Death Qi would probably take a long time.

The elder helplessly gave the order for other tree demons to gather all the precious medicines in this forest.

These medicines were easy to recognize for them. That was because they were used as nourishment for the tree demons. These medicines absorbed the spiritual qi of heaven and earth which aided in their own cultivation.

Fortunately, Long Chen only asked for one of each. If he asked for them all, that would be taking all their food, and they would fight him to the end.

“Dao Heart Sword Orchid.”

“Eight Treasure Jewel Grass.”

“Seven Leaf Sky South Star.”

“Hahaha, these are all good things.”

Long Chen couldn’t help laughing as he received the medicines. They were all incredibly valuable, with over ten being thirteenth tier medicinal ingredients.

He could also use those precious ingredients to refine twelfth tier medicinal ingredients. That would greatly boost their quality. He gained over three hundred priceless medicinal ingredients, half of which did not exist on the Martial Heaven Continent. Long Chen’s medicinal field was about to grow again.

“Old man, don’t cry. To tell the truth, for you to want to kill me and me to not kill you is already an exceptional favor. I now have just one question I want an answer to,” said Long Chen to the Heavenly Qilin Tree Demon that was glaring at him hatefully.

“What?” demanded the Heavenly Qilin Demon Tree icily.

“I’m curious, why is there a dead branch on your crown? The aura on it feels a bit similar to me.” Long Chen pointed to one of the trees.

That place was where the main trunk of the Heavenly Qilin Demon Tree took a sudden turn. It was like it had been cut in two, with one half being broken away.

“It was the result of a bastard from your human race!” roared the Heavenly Qilin Demon Tree furiously. “It was your damn human race that destroyed my true body in that battle back then. I had no choice but to transform into a seed and undergo nirvanic rebirth in my own minor world. But that minor world was also destroyed, leaving behind only this one core fragment. It fell in this godforsaken place. I was only able to slowly recover by absorbing the spiritual qi of the surroundings. After tens of thousands of years, my body was ready to return to its true form, and then that bastard came. He not only took all my Heavenly Qilin Demon Fruit, he cut off one of my Yin and Yang branches, causing a huge imbalance in my body that took years and years to recover from. Now I was preparing to reform my true body again, and a bastard like you came. The work of tens of thousands of years has been ruined by you. Your human race is all full of bastards!”

“Don’t be so emotional. Do you know that person’s name?” asked Long Chen.

“Of course I remember! He called himself Qing Xu and told me to remember it!” The Heavenly Qilin Demon Tree grit its teeth.

Long Chen nodded inside. As expected, it had been a Sovereign. No wonder the aura was so familiar. It was a bit similar to Sovereign Qing Xu’s Sovereign seal.

Sovereign Qing Xu had actually also come here to pluck the fruit. Long Chen sighed. A Sovereign really was a Sovereign. A wound left by one of them remained after all this time, with his aura still being present.

“Hehe, you really are unlucky. My guess is that the same thing happened that time. You wanted to absorb the life energy of a powerful expert to help you in your final step, so Sovereign Qing Xu taught you a little lesson,” snickered Long Chen.

The Heavenly Qilin Demon Tree snorted and didn’t reply. Clearly Long Chen was right that it had been the one to provoke the Sovereign, resulting in having to pay such a painful price.

Long Chen was shocked that a Sovereign possessed such power. Not only had he cut off part of the Heavenly Qilin Demon Tree’s trunk, that wound hadn’t healed even after tens of thousands of years. When comparing himself, he wouldn’t have been able to challenge the Heavenly Qilin Demon Tree without the black soil and Huo Ling-er.

Long Chen thought of Sovereign Mo Li’s last words. Last time, he had let him cheat and pass, but that would increase the karma for next time. If he didn’t keep working hard, he really would die to his next heavenly tribulation.

“You can go now. This place does not welcome your human race,” said the Heavenly Qilin Demon Tree coldly.

“What is there at the bottom of the marsh?” asked Long Chen.

“A group of lazy and gluttonous mudfish. As long as you don’t attack them, they won’t bother you,” replied the Heavenly Qilin Demon Tree impatiently. It seemed that he wanted him to scram so that it could recover.

Long Chen nodded. He didn’t have anything else to say. This fellow probably wished to never see a human again.

Having obtained over eight hundred Heavenly Qilin Demon Fruit and so many new medicinal ingredients, he had greatly profited. He was in a good mood as he passed through the forest again. The tree demons didn’t dare to attack him. When he reached the edge of the marsh again, he looked back to see that the forest had closed behind him. He was no longer able to see the giant tree.

This island was very strange. The surrounding space made it impossible for him to estimate just how big it was.

He didn’t overthink it. He took out the bronze bar and slowly floated off. Everything was calm. It was only once he left the mist that he sensed something wrong.

He could feel the marsh trembling. Ripples appeared on the surface of the water.

Suddenly, something below the water surged out, sending Long Chen soaring into the sky. Long Chen looked down to see an enormous figure that made his scalp turn numb.

“A beast above Netherpassage.”

It was a drake-like beast, but it had no scales or horns, or even eyes. It just had a giant mouth.

“Hand over the Heavenly Qilin Demon Fruit and I’ll spare your life.”

The huge monster actually spoke human words. Its voice was icy without any emotion.

“Fuck, that damn Heavenly Qilin Demon Tree is conning me!” Long Chen instantly realized that this huge monster was what he had sensed down below, but the Heavenly Qilin Demon Tree had just said it was a group of mudfish.

This monster also knew about the Heavenly Qilin Demon Fruit. Clearly the tree had informed it.

“Fuck, I curse you to have someone steal your Heavenly Qilin Demon Fruit the next time they mature as well!” Long Chen cursed.

“Hand over the Heavenly Qilin Demon Fruit!” Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

BOOM!

Long Chen was once more thrown into the sky. The huge monster repeated itself.

“Fuck, this is bullying! Even if I’m not a Sovereign, idiots like you can’t bully me!” raged Long Chen. A mudfish monster actually dared to bully him. This was intolerable. “Since you want to die, I’ll help you out.”

The monster didn’t feel any misgivings about Long Chen’s words. It opened its mouth, and the entire marsh heaved. Its tail suddenly whipped out of the water and at him.

BOOM!

Unable to dodge in the air, he could only block. As a result, he was knocked into the marsh. With no land anywhere, he caused a massive explosion within the marsh.

The Dragonblood warriors heard the disturbance. “Boss has been blocked by a monster!”

The mist had been scattered by the monster, allowing them to clearly see what was happening.

“What do we do? The water is toxic, and there’s no way to fly!”

BOOM!

A figure charged into the sky. Long Chen slashed Evilmoon at the monster’s head. Its body instantly sank beneath the marsh, unleashing a wave of mud.

Long Chen’s attack was only able to force it back. He managed to leave a mark on its head, but no blood came out. His attack clearly wasn’t enough to cause any damage to it.

The monster roared. Its body spun within the marsh, and a giant arrow suddenly shot towards Long Chen.

The Demon Moon Furnace appeared, pulling Long Chen inside. They were instantly sent flying into the sky by its attack.

Long Chen coughed up three mouthfuls of blood inside the Demon Moon Furnace, feeling like a star had just smashed into him.

The Demon Moon Furnace was only able to block a portion of the impact, while the rest of it had to be endured by Long Chen. Long Chen’s body was now covered in cracks.

The mudfish monster was a thirteenth rank beast. In its own territory, Long Chen was almost killed.

Suddenly, the Demon Moon Furnace lit up, and it stayed suspended in the sky.

“Big brother Long Chen, we’ve escaped the domain of the marsh,” exclaimed Ling-er.

“We’re out? Good, then we’ll give it a vicious blow.”

Long Chen appeared on top of the Demon Moon Furnace. He raised his hand, a cluster of flames appearing.
