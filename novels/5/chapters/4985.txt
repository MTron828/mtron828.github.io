Lei Linger and Huo Linger transformed into large dragons, swimming within the divine pool. Divine light flashed around them as their auras grew grander and more sacred. Runes increasingly condensed on their scales, gradually imbuing them with the aura of Doyens.

Long Chen was delighted by their transformation. The Earth Cauldron had mentioned that once they became Heavenly Doyens, they would be able to freely cultivate in the outside world, no longer confined to the primal chaos space.

With an excited expression, Lei Linger swam over to Long Chen’s side and transformed into a pretty maiden. She said, “Big Brother Long Chen, I feel like I’m getting stronger and stronger.”

“Shh. Try not to make any sound. We’re stealing their energy. Do your best to absorb as much as you can,” replied Long Chen with a smile.

“Alright.” Lei Linger giggled and retransformed into a dragon swimming within the divine pool.

Unlike Long Chen, Huo Linger and Lei Linger were only absorbing the lightning energy, flame energy, and Doyen energy within the divine pool. That was why it was so easy for them to control it. They didn’t need to worry about their bodies exploding.

Long Chen was different. He was a human, and his body contained all the energies within heaven and earth, with different proportions. That was why he couldn’t reject any of these energies if he wanted to get stronger. Otherwise, once those energies went out of balance, it would injure him. The human body was a miraculous existence containing all things in the world. Some things would never be used, but the body would still fall apart without them.

As a result, the human race was considered the spirit of the ten thousand races. All lifeforms would transform into human form after reaching a certain level of cultivation. This transformation brought them closer to the Heavenly Daos, loosening bottlenecks that once hindered their progress. It made comprehending the Heavenly Daos and the myriad laws easier.

It was an extremely difficult thing to accept for the exceedingly arrogant races that looked down on the human race. Despite their disdain, they still had to take human form, which felt like a slap in the face. Yet, it was unavoidable.

These races would only take human form while cultivating. Normally, they would stay in their true forms to flaunt their “noble” status. When adopting human form, some of them would retain certain features of their race—such as wings, claws, feathers, scales, or horns—to distinguish themselves from humans.

However, no matter how they tried to deceive themselves, it meant nothing. Ultimately, transforming into human form was the best for cultivation. This was an iron law that the entire cultivation world had no choice but to accept.

Seven-colored divine radiance quivered around Long Chen. With the divine pool’s support, his seven-color Supreme Blood grew stronger, accelerating its absorption of energy.

His dragon blood and violet blood were also growing rapidly, though they weren’t absorbing Doyen power or the elemental energies of metal, wood, water, fire, and earth. Long Chen couldn't determine what energy they were absorbing.

Regardless, they were like dragons returning to the ocean or tigers to the forest, rapidly strengthening. It was gradually reaching a point where they seemed to be getting out of control.

BOOM!

Suddenly, Long Chen’s expression changed. His seven-color Supreme Blood actually launched an attack on the dragon blood, their runes clashing like two opposing rivers.

The seven-color Supreme Blood seemed aggrieved, seizing the opportunity for revenge with a violent assault on the dragon blood. However, his dragon blood did not take this lying down. Despite being in the territory of the seven-color Supreme Blood, it pressed back fiercely, as if they were fighting to determine who was the boss.

“Stop fighting! What’s the point of fighting among yourselves?!” Long Chen was speechless. As they fought, the one suffering the most was him.

However, despite their battle shaking his body, he couldn’t stop them. His seven-color Supreme Blood seemed unwilling to be suppressed. Now that it had found its chance, it wanted to be the boss.

Though still weaker than the dragon blood, the seven-color Supreme Blood had an unending supply of energy and was growing rapidly, its rate of growth far outstripping that of the dragon blood.

As it repeatedly attacked and exhausted itself, Long Chen noticed its power becoming more condensed. It seemed that it was using this chance to temper itself.

In comparison to the dragon blood and seven-color Supreme Blood, the violet blood was strangely quiet. It was calmly absorbing the divine pool’s energy, not joining either side.

Suddenly, two light sounds rang out in Long Chen’s ears, and two powerful Blood Qis erupted. Long Chen looked over to see Lei Linger and Huo Linger enveloped in divine light, their scales emitting a distinctive fluctuation.

“One star Heavenly Doyens!”

Long Chen was pleasantly surprised to see the two of them become Doyens so easily.

Just then, a second ripple spread. In less than a single breath, their Doyen fluctuations soared to another level.Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

Long Chen’s jaw dropped. That was crazy, wasn’t it? The moment their Doyen power activated, it actually began to swell limitlessly. Lei Linger and Huo Linger were surrounded by flashing Doyen divine light. Their auras climbed crazily.

“Three star Doyens!”

“Four star Doyens!”

“Five star Doyens!”

…

In just a few breaths, they directly became nine star Doyens. Long Chen’s eyes boggled. Wasn’t that too crazy?

The two of them had leaped from one star Doyens to nine star Doyens in one go. Even having personally witnessed it, Long Chen found it hard to believe. It felt like a dream.

Their auras continued to grow. Even after they became nine star Doyens, more ripples emanated from their scales.

Nine veins appeared and slowly started to combine. Long Chen felt like his heart had stopped beating. He became completely absorbed, no longer paying attention to the battle between his dragon blood and seven-color Supreme Blood.

Buzz.

An hour later, at almost the same time, Lei Linger and Huo Linger’s auras erupted. Massive waves surged within the divine pool. Long Chen sensed both of them attain an aura similar to Long Ziwei’s.

Furthermore, a multicolored divine ring appeared on their scales.

“Heavenly Fate Ring!”

Long Chen let out a shocked cry. Wasn’t this insane? It hadn’t even been two hours, and they had condensed a Heavenly Fate Ring, becoming half-step Heavenly Chosens.

BOOM!

Suddenly, Long Chen let out a painful grunt, feeling like his chest was exploding. Hastily refocusing inward, he was shocked to find his seven-color Supreme Blood and dragon blood had grown significantly stronger—and far more berserk.

Long Chen’s expression instantly changed. He had been so engrossed in Huo Linger and Lei Linger’s transformation that he had neglected his own dragon blood and seven-color Supreme Blood.

During this lapse, they had wantonly absorbed the divine pool’s power, reaching an uncontrollable level.

“Fuck, fuck, I really screwed up!” Long Chen cursed himself. He had actually forgotten such an important thing.

“You two have to stop right now!” Long Chen roared and formed hand seals, trying to suppress them.
