Chapter 4244: Violet Blood Divine Abilities

].

No one had expected that after being surrounded and attacked by so many people, rather than thinking about how to survive, Long Chen was still planning on breaking those pillars of light.

Furthermore, he succeeded. Borrowing the power from Xu Yifeng’s sneak attack, he arrived in front of a second light pillar before anyone could react.

BOOM!

Long Chen’s black dagger slashed through the light pillar, tearing it open. The next moment, its divine light flowed out, and another dark domain lord emerged, surging into the fray.

The radiant light then crashed toward those in the vicinity. Long Chen, having learned from the previous encounter, directed the opening toward his enemies this time.

“Get out of the way!”

A startled cry rang out, warning the others. However, that dark domain lord already smashed down like a shooting star, its enormous body filled their entire line of sight.

BOOM!

The dark domain lord descended with tremendous force, and the resulting astral winds obliterated numerous experts. However, just at that moment, there was an immense explosive sound. Astonishingly, the dark domain lord had struck an even larger entity just before touching the ground.

It was a black tortoise. When the dark domain lord landed on the shell, an immense power sent the dark domain lord tumbling back.

The black tortoise also tumbled through the air a few times, yet not even the faintest scratch marred its resilient shell. Its incredible durability was apparent, so it must be something on par with an Eternal divine weapon.

Suddenly, the black tortoise opened its mouth. As its four claws slid it across the martial stage, its mouth snapped down toward the dark domain lord.

However, just as it was about to bite the dark domain lord, an enormous lily leaf wrapped around the dark domain lord.

“Lian Wuying, that is mine!” roared the black tortoise.

“It belongs to whoever can get it,” sneered Lian Wuying. With a pull, the dark domain lord’s body was sent flying, and the black tortoise’s mouth snapped down on nothing.

After that, more lily leaves appeared, wrapping around the dark domain lord, leaving it with no room to struggle.

Perhaps because this dark domain lord had not recovered from the immense impact just now, it didn’t manage to break through a single layer of leaves this time.

The lily leaves then opened, and the dark domain lord was gone. All that remained was a pile of bones that tumbled to the stage.

“Lian Wuying, you are courting death!” roared the black tortoise. His prey had actually been snatched from his jaws.

Furthermore, after devouring a second dark domain lord, Lian Wuying’s aura strengthened once more. As a peak Immortal King, her aura vaguely showed signs of breaking through the limits of this realm.

On the other hand, Lian Wuying didn’t even respond and just looked at Long Chen. Long Chen was as quick as lightning, already shooting toward another distant light pillar.

“Stop him! Two of the nine pillars have been broken! If another is broken, the formation will become completely unbalanced!” shouted someone.

The next moment, a violet-gold bell appeared, shattering the void in front of Long Chen. It was the Violet Blood race’s Eternal divine weapon wielded by Xu Xin-er. Right at the start, she already used her Eternal divine weapon, seeming like she intended to fight Long Chen to the death.

Long Chen snorted. He could easily tell that this bell might look to be unleashing a mighty strength, but its power was secretly reserved so that she could pull it back instantly. In this case, Xu Xin-er was quite crafty. She only did this as a show, wanting Long Chen to go around. She had no intention of actually fighting Long Chen.

Long Chen then pushed forward, stabbing the black dagger toward the bell.

As expected, Xu Xin-er didn’t dare to use her bell to receive that black dagger and hastily fell back.

After all, Long Chen’s black dagger was capable of breaking the pillars of light, things that not even Eternal divine weapons managed to shake. Hence, no one else dared to use their precious weapons against Long Chen’s black dagger.

Long Chen pierced through the remaining violet qi, but suddenly, divine light erupted in front of him. A sharp sword-like violet divine radiance then pierced toward Long Chen.

Facing this attack, a sensation of death swelled within him. In an instant, he understood that Xu Xin-er’s attack had not been an attempt to intimidate him but rather a prelude to Xu Yifeng's imminent strike.

Their cooperation was perfect. Xu Xin-er’s violet qi had completely covered up Xu Yifeng’s attack. By the time Long Chen noticed it, it was too late to dodge.

BOOM!

The violet divine radiance pierced through the sky, striking the martial stage’s barrier and tearing through it. The violet divine light was like a sword stabbing the river of stars high above.

Everyone was shocked. Up until now, no one had been able to shake the martial stage’s barrier, but Xu Yifeng’s attack could directly pierce it.

However, the barrier swiftly mended the breach as if nothing had happened. However, the undeniable truth remained that he had succeeded in penetrating it, leaving everyone in astonishment. The sheer sharpness of that attack was absolutely terrifying, possessing the potential to obliterate even an innate Heaven Venerate in one go.

When people looked back at the battlefield, they saw Long Chen standing in the air. However, his arm was now stained with blood.

Long Chen was staring at his arm coldly, his eyes reflecting peculiar fluctuations. He had been injured by the Violet Blood race's divine ability. While the wound appeared severe, it was in fact only superficial, though it bore a frightening appearance.

What Long Chen found incomprehensible was that the surrounding violet qi actually flowed into his arm, seemingly helping him heal.

“Your body once had violet blood flowing through it. Furthermore, it was even more domineering and purer than his. It’s like a subject accidentally hurting the emperor without realizing it. After mistakenly injuring the emperor, the subject does his best to make up for it. However, don’t absorb this violet qi. It will affect the purity of your bloodline. You should keep your body thirsting for its original blood. Remember, your violet blood is in Long Aotian’s body,” reminded the dragon expert.

Long Chen was startled. It was no wonder he felt such a thirst when looking at this violet qi. It seemed that his body was urgently anticipating the return of his violet qi.

However, this violet qi wasn’t his. If he was going to absorb anything, it should be his own violet blood. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

Just as Long Chen was staring silently, Xu Yifeng and Xu Xin-er, as well as the rest of the Xu family’s experts were dumbfounded.

Xu Yifeng’s attack had perfectly and directly struck Long Chen, who had only blocked with a single arm. According to reason, Long Chen should have died from this attack.

It had to be known that this attack had directly pierced the martial stage’s barrier, and that was after passing through Long Chen. In other words, Long Chen had received its full power.

The martial stage’s barrier was pierced through, but Long Chen only suffered such a light injury? The Xu family’s experts found it unbelievable.

Long Chen slowly raised his arm, and the shattered dragon scales quickly recovered. All traces of blood that had been dripping from the wounded arm disappeared, leaving it as if nothing had occurred.

Suddenly, Long Chen’s Kunpeng wings flapped, and she shot toward another pillar of light. However, the moment he shot toward it, the black dagger in his hand vanished.

“Stop him!”

Lian Wuying appeared in front of that light pillar. Her lily leaves then rose, blocking Long Chen’s way.

BOOM!

Just as everyone was anticipating the battle between Long Chen and Lian Wuying, in the distance, another light pillar exploded.

“What?!”

Everyone was startled. Looking over, they saw Mo Nian with a black dagger in his grasp.
