Chapter 3384 Nether Blood Giant

“It’s him!”

“No doubt!”

Those giants instantly focused on Long Chen as if they had found a treasure.

“Warriors of the Nether Blood Giant race, you wouldn’t be making things hard for us, right?” asked Ming Cangyue cautiously.

“No, no. The Nethergod race and us can simply mind each other’s business. How could we make things hard on you?” Their leader shook his giant head and pointed a huge finger at Long Chen. “Tell me, are you Long Chen?”

Despite lowering his voice, that giant’s voice was still oppressive. It was like his vocal cords were too big, so his voice shook the air. This giant had an overwhelming Blood Qi pressure. His aura was definitely not at all inferior to a Heaven tier Nether King.

Furthermore, there were dozens of others beside him with similar auras. It was no wonder even an existence as powerful as the Underworld Cloud Dark Tiger race would be exterminated so quickly.

“Yes, I am Long Chen.” Long Chen was startled along with Leng Yueyan and Ming Cangyue. How could the Nether Blood Giant race know his name?

“Then there’s definitely no doubt. The Nether Blood Giant race is loyal to the Heavenly King. So, the Heavenly King has said that he owes a debt to Long Chen, and that no one can make things hard on him. Furthermore, anyone who obtains news of him will be rewarded heavily. Just before, a fellow from the Three Eyed race said that he encountered you in the immortal world. When he told the Heavenly King, the Heavenly King was delighted and bestowed a divine treasure upon him. I didn’t expect that we would also run into you. Long Chen, you must come with us to see the Heavenly King,” said this leader of the Nether Blood Giant race emotionally. He even went on one knee, offering Long Chen a sacred and ancient courtesy. His eyes were begging him.

“Is that Heavenly King of yours the fellow with three heads and a body that covers the heavens?” asked Long Chen, his heart jumping.

“Yes, that is our Heavenly King.” The leader hastily nodded. He was even happier to hear that. Now they were definitely sure about him.

As for Leng Yueyan and Ming Cangyue, they instantly understood. Back when Long Chen was going through the Netherpassage world and about to return to the Martial Heaven Continent, he came before the Gates of Hell. He then ended up stealing the door knockers from it. Those were seals, and once they were removed, a giant beast broke free, escaping from the laws binding it.

Ming Cangyue and Leng Yueyan had known that there was a Three-Headed Heaven Devouring Beast sealed behind the Gates of Hell, but they were only overseers of the laws there. They weren’t qualified to peer into those secrets, nor did they have the ability to change those laws. Thus, even if that beast escaped, it couldn’t be said to be their fault.

However, due to that beast creating havoc in that Netherpassage world, their cultivation was affected. At that time, they were under the administration of some superior Nethergods and were in a dangerous spot.

In truth, the reason the two of them had taken the risk of searching for a new stronghold was related to that Three-Headed Heaven Devouring Beast. However, they hadn’t expected that this beast would actually break free of the laws of the Netherpassage world and enter the Netherworld, even being in charge of the Nether Blood Giant race. That was astonishing.

“Long Chen, our Heavenly King is someone who cares deeply about debts. He definitely has no malice toward you. There’s absolutely nothing for you to fear. Please come with us,” pleaded their leader.

“Alright, then I’ll go visit your Heavenly King. However, I want to gather the corpses on the ground first. They’re very useful to me,” said Long Chen. Long Chen also wanted to see just what kind of existence this Heavenly King was.

Furthermore, Long Chen had helped him escape from his seal. Theoretically, the latter shouldn’t have any bad feelings toward Long Chen.DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

His agreement delighted the Nether Blood Giant race. They immediately returned to the battlefield and helped Long Chen gather all the corpses. There were mountains of them, and he tossed them directly into the primal chaos space.

“Long Chen, if that Heavenly King asks you to join his camp, you absolutely cannot agree. The Three-Headed Heaven Devouring Beast is one of the desolate era’s devil species. They possess the will to destroy the Heavenly Daos. Now that he has been released, he will definitely start a bloody retribution. That will provoke countless powerful enemies. He himself is strong enough to ignore them, but if you are also implicated, it might spell great trouble for you even if you return to the immortal world,” transmitted Ming Cangyue.

“Alright, I’ll listen to my wife.” Long Chen smiled at Ming Cangyue.

Seeing that he obediently listened, Ming Cangyue and Leng Yueyan relaxed. The two of them knew some secrets of the Three-Headed Heaven Devouring Beast. While they didn’t know the whole story, that existence was definitely too dangerous. It would be best not to come into contact with him too much.

However, the Nether Blood Giants had recognized Long Chen. If he didn’t go and they became hostile, Long Chen and the others wouldn’t be a match for them.

Originally, Ming Cangyue and Leng Yueyan also wanted to go. However, someone needed to look after their home. If they only left one person, then they wouldn’t be able to fight with their combination technique. Long Chen did not feel good about that, so he decided to go on his own.

Once the battlefield was cleaned up, the Nether Blood Giants’ leader placed Long Chen on his own shoulder. Long Chen then waved goodbye to Leng Yueyan and Ming Cangyue, indicating for them to be at ease.

Only then did they leave. With their giant bodies, they crossed a thousand miles with a step. Long Chen instantly lost sight of the two women.

With Long Chen gone, Leng Yueyan and Ming Cangyue looked at each other, seeing the reluctance in each other’s eyes.

“Hopefully, that Three-Headed Heaven Devouring Beast doesn’t have any ill will toward Long Chen,” sighed Ming Cangyue. She found that she was still too weak. She was powerless to go against the flow of the Netherworld.

“He doesn’t have ill will toward Long Chen. Instead…” Leng Yueyan actually had a greater worry appear within her heart.

“Instead what?” asked Ming Cangyue.

“Instead, those two fellows might end up becoming brothers. Whether it is Long Chen or the Three-Headed Heaven Devouring Beast, they both possess an intense destructive will. Although Long Chen has always been suppressing his desire to destroy, I’m afraid that if he sees that fellow, this desire would be unleashed. When both of those destructive fellows are together, it’ll be like a bee seeing honey. Once they meet, it might be difficult for them to ever part,” said Leng Yueyan.

She had interacted with Long Chen more than Ming Cangyue and knew more about his contradictory nature. Moreover, he had given rise to a heart-devil and had the Ghost Sovereign’s mark on him. And now, he was going to see a Three-Headed Heaven Devouring Beast. It seemed that Long Chen was walking further and further on a dark path. She was afraid that he might not return from that path one day.

“It’s fine. We still have time. Long Chen brought us good luck, so we should hurry and reach the World Master realm. Once we become World Masters, we can control the life energy of the Netherpassage worlds. After that, we’ll have truly reached the point where we can stand tall in the Netherworld. We still have a long way to go. Once we get stronger, Long Chen won’t have to be in so much danger,” said Ming Cangyue.

Leng Yueyan nodded. Holding hands, the two of them vanished along with their trusted aides.
