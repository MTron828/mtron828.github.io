Chapter 4420 Becoming a Fiend Wouldn’t Be Bad

Worried about the Earth Spirit race, Long Chen and Ye Ling immediately rushed back as soon as they saved Ye Xue.

As expected, quite a few experts were unwilling to give up on killing the Earth Spirit race. After spying for a while, they then launched a sneak attack.ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

However, with Lei Linger and Huo Linger present, they simply killed a dozen Eternal experts and scared the rest to flee.

Lei Linger and Huo Linger were terrifyingly powerful at this time. When they joined forces, the ordinary Eternal experts couldn’t even block a single blow from them.

When Long Chen returned, the land was charred, and Eternal corpses were lying on the ground. The enemies had fled without even taking those corpses.

“Big Brother Long Chen!”

Little Crane immediately rushed over to Long Chen. Meanwhile, after accomplishing their mission, Lei Linger and Huo Linger returned to the primal chaos space. Despite having just engaged in a battle, it didn’t seem like the two of them had used much energy at all.

Now, the two of them could be considered independent experts. Huo Linger in particular had split herself into two entities. The stronger of the two focused on refining pills within the Earth Cauldron, while the weaker portion accompanied Long Chen.

Due to the endless influx of Eternal corpses, the primal chaos space pulsated with vibrant life energy. Because of this, the Fusang Trees and Moon Trees continued to thrive, their flames absorbed by Huo Linger as they incessantly grew.

Once she merged into one once more, she would be even more terrifying. Fueled by the Moon Flame and Sun Flame, Huo Linger’s growth knew no bounds.

On the other hand, Lei Linger also possessed formidable powers but didn’t have that advantage. She was only able to eat her fill when Long Chen underwent tribulation. Fortunately, during their recent endeavors, Lei Linger had absorbed so much thunderforce that she had a huge reserve to tap into. Hence, her power was also constantly growing during this period.

Long Chen tossed the giant corpses into the primal chaos space. With his advancement to the World King realm, the primal chaos space had grown once more. Now, he had no idea what to put in this giant space.

Blessed with the Moon Trees and Fusang Trees, he had an endless supply of life energy. As a result, he didn’t even care about other trees anymore. He would rather have a nice wide open space to look at than clutter it with some trash.

After confirming that everyone was fine, Long Chen brought them back to the High Firmament Academy.

Several days later, when they arrived, Bai Letian personally welcomed them, making Ye Ling feel endlessly grateful.

In truth, before arriving, she had been worried. Considering the potential trouble the Earth Spirit race could cause for the High Firmament Academy, she worried about facing rejection. After all, they were known for their pride. This was what made them rather face death than seek aid from the Spirit race.

However, as their power declined and their enemies drew closer, countless bad ideas floated through Ye Ling’s mind. Could she thicken her face and endure other people’s mockery to find her people a safe haven to rest?

Throughout this period, countless worrisome scenarios crossed her mind. However, to her surprise, the dean personally came to welcome her people. Such a gesture brought tears to her eyes.

“Respected race leader Ye Ling, you’ve suffered during this time. Having sacrificed so much, all of your people are warriors worthy of admiration. I represent everyone in the High Firmament Academy to welcome you. Starting today, the High Firmament Academy is your home,” said Bai Letian.

Bai Letian’s demeanor exuded kindness, and his sincere tone put the Earth Spirit race’s experts at ease.

Formerly nervous, they were now moved to tears, realizing they no longer had to keep running.

Long Chen smiled. He had secretly sent word over to the High Firmament Academy before this, so they naturally wouldn’t reject the Earth Spirit race. Since the High Firmament Academy wanted to rise, they needed to do something to awe others.

Helping the Earth Spirit race could also be considered a declaration of war against certain factions. After all, the constant probing games started to get on their nerves. They would rather have a real fight.

Bai Letian welcomed them and left the arrangements to Long Chen. Since the Earth Spirit race liked mountains and water, Long Chen brought them to the rear mountains of the High Firmament Academy.

This place was the academy’s purest land. The disciples rarely set foot here, so there was no need to worry about people disturbing them.

Most importantly, this was the place that the rainbow crane race flew over. Auspicious qi filled this place, causing the Earth Spirit race to instantly fall in love with it.

As soon as they arrived, they started to build their own homes. With their special ability to control vegetation, they let some plants grow into large constructions that wouldn’t ruin the scenery of this place.

As a result, the vegetation here thrummed with vitality, and giant trees grew rapidly into the sky. During the construction process, the Earth Spirit race’s experts danced and jumped throughout the forest, singing their own songs.

As they sang and danced, the earth seemed to awaken. Long Chen felt like he could hear the heartbeat of the earth, sensing their blessing.

At this moment, he understood why they were called the Earth Spirit race. The target of their faith was the earth. The earth selflessly gave them everything, so they also gave their everything to the earth, putting their full faith and worship in it.

As he saw their way of life, a smile slowly crept over his face. He couldn’t help sighing inside. If war vanished from this world, living like this every day would be wonderful.

“Dean Long Chen, this time… we truly thank you.” Ye Ling’s voice was choked with sobs even as she smiled and thanked Long Chen.

“No need to be so courteous, race leader. I genuinely hold a fondness for the Earth Spirit race. I also didn’t save you all solely because of my duty to the Spirit race,” replied Long Chen.

“What?”

“You were willing to be cursed to protect the Spirit race. I am the same. To protect the people I love, I don’t mind becoming a fiend. If I really became a fiend one day, it wouldn't matter. At the very least, no one would dare to harm my loved ones,” stated Long Chen.

Long Chen smiled, a genuinely happy expression on his face. Watching the Earth Spirit race dance, Long Chen suddenly had a flash of comprehension.

Previously, he had expressed his fear of becoming a monster. But now, he felt like he had been overthinking it. Becoming a fiend didn’t seem so bad.

Suddenly, the void twisted, unveiling the Earth Cauldron before Long Chen. When Long Chen looked at it, he couldn’t help jumping in shock.
