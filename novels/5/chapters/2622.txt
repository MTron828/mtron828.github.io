Chapter 2611 Plucking Feathers

“Power comparable to a Sovereign sprout?”

Long Chen was startled. This four-colored Peng was surprisingly powerful. It would have the power to contend even against a Sovereign sprout.

“A damn brute also dares to act so arrogant?” Long Chen snorted. His divine ring lit up behind him, and he activated the Six Star Battle Armor.

At this moment, a wing flew through the air along with a spray of blood. One of the four-colored Peng’s wings was cut off, causing it to instantly lose balance.

As a result, its other wing slashed onto the ground, causing a wave of earth to explode.

Long Chen then waved his hand and picked up the golden wing he had cut off. “Were you sending me a golden chicken wing to roast?”

Hearing this insult, the four-colored Peng was enraged. Its feathers suddenly lit up, and the wing that Long Chen had cut off instantly grew back out.

“You dare blaspheme the mighty demonic beast race? Vile human, do you know the price for this?” The four-colored Peng roared.

It suddenly opened its mouth, and a four-colored light-sword shot out, locking down Long Chen.

“Can you make me pay the price? Do you think you can make me eat enough chicken wings to make me burst?” sneered Long Chen.

Black qi swirled out of Long Chen. He chose to defend against this powerful divine ability directly.

BOOM!

The entire Ancient Battlefield trembled, and all the warriors of the Heavenly Dragon Legion let out a muffled groan as they felt like they had been struck in the stomach. They almost coughed up blood and lost consciousness.

“What kind of power is this? Wasn’t that a clash of power against power? It wasn’t a spiritual attack!”

They were a great distance from Long Chen and were even separated by a sea of flames. But the clash of their attacks was able to make them feel like this. If they were closer, would they have been blasted apart?

“Be careful! Demon kings possess their own berserk bloodline power that can affect our Blood Qi. Keep circulating your Blood Qi. Fortunately, we are in a combat state already, otherwise, that really might have killed us.” As commander, Shen Chengfeng knew a bit more than the others. This was why he was stunned to encounter a demon king.

Right now, Shen Chengfeng wanted to advise Long Chen to leave. A demon king was comparable to a Sovereign sprout. If two appeared, then it would be troublesome. Moreover, who knew just how many demon kings the demonic beast race had? If three or more came, perhaps Long Chen would still be able to escape, but the rest of them would definitely die.

However, since their lives had been saved by Long Chen, Shen Chengfeng decided not to say anything. They would follow wherever Long Chen went. After all, their lives had been wrested from death by him.

…

Black qi and four-colored light continued to clash until one side of the void was filled with darkness while the other side was filled with four-colored light. As these two powers clashed, the void rumbled.

“You just have this much power? Then I won’t waste any more time with you.” Long Chen sneered. Evilmoon’s runes suddenly lit up.

A sharp aura exploded, and the multicolored side of the void was instantly cut apart. After that, a giant saber-image fell upon the four-colored Peng and cut off its other wing. Amidst the four-colored divine light whipping around chaotically through the void, a path was cut through, and Long Chen charged over to land a kick on the giant Peng’s head.

As a result, feathers flew through the air. Its head was now bare of any feathers.

The previously mighty giant Peng had been turned into a bald chicken and was sent tumbling into the distance.

Looking at this scene, Shen Chengfeng and the others were dumbfounded. This was definitely ridiculous. A demon king wasn’t even close to a match for Long Chen.

Long Chen then grabbed the other wing that he had cut off and once more charged at the Peng.

Although it hastily stabilized itself, its head was still muddled from the kick. By the time it recovered, Long Chen was already right in front of it. It was so scared that all its feathers stood on end.

Without hesitation, it turned and fled.

However, as a result of its panic, it forgot that one of its wings had been cut off, so it instantly lost balance and fell from the air.

“Think you can run?” Long Chen tossed out a ball of lightning in his left hand, striking it directly.

BOOM! ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

In front of Shen Chengfeng and the others’ stunned gazes, all the four-colored Peng’s feathers burst off of its body, leaving it a naked chicken.

“This…” Their jaws dropped. Just what kind of situation was this?

What they didn’t know was that although it was able to restore the wing that it had lost in the beginning, that was actually a serious wound to it. As its divine abilities lay within its wings, the cost of regrowing one was immense, and the new wing was much weaker. Moreover, the new feathers also had some flaws when it came to balancing with the other wings.

Although Long Chen was unaware of this, he knew that something was definitely wrong with it, or its feathers wouldn’t fall off so easily. Thereafter, the lightning attack confirmed his guess when it blasted away all its feathers.

Feeling horrified, the four-colored Peng lit up all the runes on its skin, and the fallen feathers raced back toward its body.

BOOM!

Unfortunately, another bolt of lightning came from Long Chen, blasting the feathers off once more.

Huo Linger quickly took action this time, and a flame dragon swept over the land, devouring the fallen feathers.

However, the feathers seemed to possess their own spirit. They began to fight, trying to break free of the flame dragon. In the end, the flame dragon exploded, but it used its life to bring the feathers away. Those feathers were then devoured by a hundred individual flame dragons.

“Return my divine feathers!” roared the giant Peng. Those feathers were its innate divine items. After losing them, its cultivation base would regress.

At this moment, Long Chen slashed his saber, cutting off its newly formed wing.

Staring at the feathers that it had lost, the Peng knew that it could not take them back. Those flame dragons would eventually be able to destroy its feathers once their energy ran out.

Although it wanted to take them back, the vicious fellow in front of him wouldn’t allow that. Now, even keeping its life was a problem.

“Just wait!” The furious Peng then clenched its death and fled. Without its wings or feathers, it could only run.

Unexpectedly, its legs were surprisingly fast. Runes lit up across its body, and the void shuddered, allowing it to pass through rapidly.

While it was fast, it definitely wasn’t pleasant to look at. It was like a plucked chicken about to be thrown into the pot was now running for its life. It was both shocking and comical.

“Who has time to wait for you? Leave your life behind!”

Lightning appeared on Long Chen’s feet, and lightning wings spread on his back. He then shot after in chase.

“Long Chen, don’t chase a cornered enemy!” shouted Shen Chengfeng.

However, they were just too fast and vanished in the blink of an eye.

“This is the Ancient Battlefield! Even someone like senior Feng Fei would have to make plenty of preparations and have an escape route in place before entering its depths.” One of the vice commanders paled.

The depths of the Ancient Battlefield contained an unknowable number of experts from the demonic beast race. By charging in like this, Long Chen might encounter a group of demonic beasts or something even more terrifying.

“What do we do?” Now the Heavenly Dragon warriors were at a loss. There was a sea of demonic beasts before them that they didn’t dare to charge through. Even if they tried, they would just be sending themselves to their deaths.

“Reporting it is meaningless. No reinforcements have come after all this time, which means that the other areas are also facing a fierce battle,” said Shen Chengfeng. Even if they wanted reinforcements, there was nowhere to get them from.

“Don’t worry, you can just wait for big brother Long Chen here. Work hard. Big brother Long Chen wants me to kill some more demonic beasts, so I’m going to keep advancing. I’ll leave the injured fish that get through to you!” said Huo Linger.

After speaking, Huo Linger got brighter, and her flames were growing more intense. As Huo Linger advanced, countless demonic beasts were enveloped in flames and killed.

As the army of flame dragons rapidly advanced, more and more half-dead demonic beasts were flung to the side. The Heavenly Dragon warriors didn’t tarry and quickly took care of them.

At the same time, Long Chen quickly shot after the four-colored Peng. Fortunately, he had cut off its wings and taken its feathers, or there was no way he would have been able to catch up. Even on its legs, its speed was astounding.

“Hey, naked fellow, your butt is hanging out! Can you cover it up? It’s embarrassing!” shouted Long Chen.

The four-colored Peng stumbled from this shout, tripping and crashing into a mountain, filling the air with dust.
