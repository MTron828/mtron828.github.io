Chapter 1942: 1942

Seeing Long Chen in thought, Yue Xihan smiled and shook her head . “After being isolated from the continent for so long, we’re not skilled in this kind of scheming . ”

Yue Xihan felt helpless in the face of Long Chen’s suspicions . After all, the original devil race was united and didn’t rely on dirty schemes . Compared to the Martial Heaven Continent’s experts, they were much purer .

“Aunt Han, pull back all the disciples of the original devil race in the continent . I feel like Yu Xiaoyun’s plot this time is on a much larger scale . Perhaps his goal isn’t just the Martial Heaven Alliance . We should focus on safety first . As for the resource collection, I will think of something . I already have quite a few good things that you can use . There shouldn’t be any shortage of resources,” said Long Chen . He was unable to see through Yu Xiaoyun’s plot .

Yue Xihan nodded . “Then I’ll give the order right now . They can probably all be back in five to seven days . ”

Long Chen immediately shook his head . “That’s no good . Any large scale movements would be too conspicuous . Who knows how many eyes Yu Xiaoyun has on the continent? We also don’t know if their actions are to startle us into action . Any large scale retreat would probably be falling right for his trap . We have to retreat without causing any noise at all . ”

“Alright, then I’ll send some people to do it immediately . ” Yue Xihan nodded .

In just a moment, two Elders walked in, but they came to a sudden stop when they saw Long Chen . The domineering aura being released from Long Chen made their hearts pound .

Yue Xihan passed down Long Chen’s orders . Once they were gone, Long Chen said, “Aunt Han, are there any movements on the Martial Heaven Continent lately?”

“The current Martial Heaven Alliance is extremely tense, like a taut bow...” Yue Xihan told him that after killing Huo Lieyun’s physical body and erasing their spiritual marks to escape Yu Xiaoyun’s hunt, the entire continent was shaken .

In the Yin Yang World, Long Chen had led the Dragonblood Legion and the Martial Heaven Alliance’s disciples to slay over two million of the greatest geniuses of the various powers . Then they had faced off against over thirty Netherpassage experts, and Long Chen had even slain the vice island master of Heavenly Fate Island .

Then there had been a confrontation at the gates of the Martial Heaven Alliance, throwing the continent into chaos . Even an enormous entity like the Martial Heaven Alliance had been forced to the extent that they had to expel Long Chen . Who else in the world could contend against those powers?

As for the matter of Pill Valley accusing Long Chen of colluding with the original devil race, no one actually believed it . This was the same old story of the boy who cried wolf . Pill Valley had tried using the same excuse to capture Long Chen multiple times now, but they had never brought out any real proof .

This time was the same as there was no proof . People were already numb to this action of Pill Valley . They even felt that Pill Valley couldn’t even come up with something new to be novel . They just used the same excuse over and over .

Even once he was hunted down by countless experts under the pretense of this excuse, Long Chen was still capable of slaying Huo Lieyun’s physical body and bringing his people away without the slightest harm .

The entire continent now had an arrest warrant out for Long Chen . His picture was pasted throughout the streets of every major city . ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

Apparently, Pill Valley was offering ten half-step divine items and ten billion spirit crystals as a reward to someone who offered up Long Chen’s location, and they would guarantee their safety .

“Ten half-step divine items and ten billion spirit crystals? Damn, I should just give myself up . ” Long Chen jumped . Pill Valley was truly willing to pay up .

“Speaking of which, there’s something funny that happened recently . Your good brother, Mo Nian, apparently made quite a bit of money thanks to this matter . ” Yue Xihan laughed .

“What?”

“In order to express their sincerity and provide more motivation, Pill Valley displayed the reward for others to see . Mo Nian disguised himself as you, and somehow in front of everyone, managed to take the divine items and spirit crystals before escaping on the Earth Splitting Divine Shuttle . Even a dozen Netherpassage experts were unable to stop him from leaving . I heard that two of them coughed up blood from fury . ”

Yue Xihan felt a bit of admiration for Mo Nian . To be able to take something away from a dozen Netherpassage experts, the name of the Western Wretch was well-deserved .

“His disguise was apparently perfect . If it hadn’t been for the Earth Splitting Divine Shuttle, no one would have recognized him . ”

“This fellow actually got rich just like that? Next time I see him, I’ll make him split the reward for using my name . ” Long Chen also laughed . This fellow Mo Nian was truly talented .

Thinking about Mo Nian’s style, Long Chen could imagine the infuriating words he had tossed out at that time . That was why two experts would cough up blood .

“However, the current Martial Heaven Continent is mostly in turmoil . Everyone has to be on guard . The Corrupt path, ancient races, ancient family alliance, Xuan Beasts, and even the Bloodkill Hall are running rampant as a display of power . They’ll beat whoever they don’t like, saying that those people are part of your group, and they’ll even kill them . Most cultivators don’t even dare to go out anymore . As for Heavenly Fate Island, it is currently saying that the Martial Heaven Alliance’s destiny has come to an end to shake the hearts of the Righteous sects . More of them are siding with Pill Valley,” sighed Yue Xihan .

Long Chen nodded . “Yu Xiaoyun is ruthless and ambitious . When he acts furious and unable to control his emotions, it’s an act to trick us . No matter how things went, it was within the margin of error, allowing him to benefit the most . As for Heavenly Fate Island, it’s an extremely special existence on the continent . Some foolish people view them as gods, thinking that they really can read the future . How laughable . Just let them make noise for now . Once I’m fully recovered, I’ll definitely properly slap their faces . ”

Long Chen had a disdainful smile on his face . Heavenly Fate Island had continuously gone against him, and they were a great threat . Although they couldn’t really read the future, they had some skills which had resulted in them almost costing him his life several times . Their debt to him had been accumulating for some time now .

Two days later, Long Chen came out of seclusion . His realm hadn’t fully stabilized yet, but he couldn’t keep waiting . The Dragonblood warriors were starting to come out of seclusion .

“Hahaha, I have a feeling like I’m completely unrivaled . I want a good opponent to test myself,” Gu Yang laughed . His confidence had grown after advancing to the Life Star realm .

“Then why don’t you go challenge boss?” asked Guo Ran with a chortle .

“If you always talk that way, you won’t have any friends . ” Gu Yang deflated, shaking his head .

No matter how arrogant Gu Yang was, he wouldn’t dare to challenge Long Chen . Even if Long Chen was still in the Soul Transformation realm, Huo Lieyun hadn’t been a match for him .

Meng Qi, Chu Yao, Tang Wan-er, Yue Xiaoqian, Liu Ruyan, and Cloud had gathered . Tang Wan-er in particular was excited at this feeling of having her power grow so much .

“Boss, didn’t you say we should go directly for the first Heavenstage? Why have you called us out again so early?” asked Li Qi .

“Because there’s something that’s bothering me . Furthermore, directly charging to the first Heavenstage might leave behind a slight flaw . Since that’s the case, let’s slow down a bit . Everyone, come with me to search for Wilde . It just so happens that we can slay some powerful Magical Beasts as well . Those are useful to me,” said Long Chen .

The last time he was in the Skyscraping World, Wilde had charged into another world . He was supposed to eat until he was satisfied, but he actually ended up getting lost .

Even after all this time, there wasn’t any news of Wilde . Although Long Chen knew how powerful Wilde was, to say that Long Chen wasn’t the slightest bit worried about him would be a lie . Wilde’s head was too simple .

Everyone stood in front of a spatial channel, and it was fully stable unlike before .

Yue Xiaoqian explained, “Many of the Magical Beasts have been killed . Not only was it a good tempering for our warriors, but we also obtained quite a few resources that we could trade with the Huayun Sect . Now, we’ve already begun searching through that world, gradually going deeper . We’re looking for any valuable ores or resources that we can gather . However, we’ve just started our exploration of that world, so we don’t dare to go too far . My mother told me that we have to be careful . If this world has some terrifying existence inside, disturbing it could bring calamity to the original devil race, so we must be careful . That’s also why we haven’t found Wilde yet . ”

Long Chen led the Dragonblood Legion into the channel . The endless tide of Magical Beasts had vanished .

There were hundreds of Life Star experts guarding the other side of the channel . Seeing Yue Xiaoqian, they all bowed .

Seeing dozens of grand formations arranged on this side, Xia Chen said, “Establishing all of this must have cost quite a bit of money . ”

“Yes . We hesitated a long while before building them all . It was a gamble to see if there were any valuable resources here . If we win, we’ll be rich, but if we lose, we’ll have lost years of income . ” Yue Xiaoqian bitterly smiled .

“Don’t worry about it . I have plenty of money . My money is your money . ” Long Chen smiled . With the primal chaos bead, he had a bottomless pit of money .

Suddenly, in the distance, the earth exploded . A group of disciples of the original devil race fled over, a large pack of giant figures right on their tails .
