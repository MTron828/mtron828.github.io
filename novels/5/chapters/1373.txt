Chapter 1374 Terrifying Monster

Translator: BornToBe

“Long Chen, you won’t be able to kill us. Unless you forever stay in the Heaven Dragon Flame Region, your death is doubtless!” Qu Dajiang completely ignored Long Chen’s attack.

Buzz.

Just at this moment, the four of them, Qu Dajiang, Dan Yanxue, Kan Dongze, and Jiang Zijun, each of them took out a jade plate and crushed it.

Long Chen’s flame blade slashed straight through their bodies, but it didn’t injure them. They seemed to be like illusions.

“These are teleportation talismans? No, they’re different...” Long Chen’s expression changed.

“This is Pill Valley’s protective talisman. Do you think an idiot like you would know about it? In just ten breaths, we’ll be transported back to Pill Valley. Furthermore, spatial energy will be protecting us. Even if you were ten times stronger, you wouldn’t be able to harm a single hair on our bodies,” said Kan Dongze coldly.

“Long Chen, once you exit the Heaven Dragon Flame Region, you’ll definitely die. I advise you to stay inside. I want to bring in the heads of your Dragonblood Legion’s members one by one. I heard you also have quite a few beauties that are so beautiful they can cause the downfall of a nation. Don’t worry, I’ll look after them. Perhaps ten years from now, you’ll be able to see their children. Don’t worry, I, Jiang Zijun, guarantee it.” Jiang Zijun’s expression was twisted. His hatred for Long Chen had reached a peak.

Long Chen’s gaze was icy-cold. He raised the pot and smashed Jiang Zijun. But the pot, which had always been the bane of formations, actually passed straight through Jiang Zijun’s body without harming him.

“Haha, are you angry? Good. I hope you don’t die, Long Chen, because I want to make your life worse than death!” Jiang Zijun laughed at Long Chen’s rising killing intent.

How was this possible? He had clearly been able to kill them, but the final result was still them getting away?

Was this due to the golden fate lines the Eastern Wasteland Bell had mentioned? Long Chen was incredibly infuriated. He refused to allow anyone to threaten the people by his side.

The Eastern Wasteland Bell had said that Celestials were protected by great karmic luck. Defeating one of them could be easy, but to kill that person would be extremely, extremely difficult. That was because the Heavenly Daos would always help them. Luck would always be on their side.

Unless you had absolute power, it was essentially impossible to kill a rank nine Celestial. They were the favorites of heaven and earth. As for killing four at once, that was even less likely.

Seeing their bodies grow fainter and more indistinct, Long Chen clenched his teeth so hard that they creaked.

BOOM!

Suddenly, the sea of lava exploded, and it was as if something at the bottom had caved in. The sea of lava rapidly descended, forming a whirlpool. At the same time, a terrifying pressure descended that caused the world to violently shake.

Four panicked figures suddenly fell from the sky. They were Qu Dajiang, Dan Yanxue, Kan Dongze, and Jiang Zijun.

The four of them had been on their way, and the space in front of them had just been about to stabilize for them to be taken away. However, what they saw in front of them was not Pill Valley, but still the Heaven Dragon Flame Region. Seeing Long Chen staring at them with killing intent, their expressions immediately changed.

“Impossible! I refuse to believe this! This is definitely just a dream!” cried Jiang Zijun.

Long Chen appeared beside him in an instant, kicking him in the crotch. Jiang Zijun was just an alchemist, and without the protection of his flame energy, his lower body exploded.

He let out a miserable shriek, but it was cut off halfway.

That was because a hand was tightly clenching his throat. Long Chen smiled icily. “Here, let me give you some pain so you know it’s not a dream!”

The other three were all flabbergasted. They didn’t understand what was going on, but they knew they were doomed.

BOOM!

Another explosive sound rang out, causing the entire Heaven Dragon Flame Region to rock. The whirlpool beneath them vanished, and following that, the lava began to rise higher and higher.

Long Chen’s expression suddenly changed, and he turned to flee. But in that instant, a sensation that caused his whole body to turn cold appeared. Something terrible was about to appear in this world.

He suddenly thought of the divine crystals he had taken and also of the collision between Star fall and the giant lotus. When the lava had been blown away, it seemed that they had been right above that spot.

He fled as fast as possible. As for Dan Yanxue, Kan Dongze, and Qu Dajiang, they still didn’t understand what was happening. Suddenly, a huge figure appeared out of the lava.

Seeing that monstrosity, the three of them instantly turned pale.

It could only be described as a monster a hundred miles tall. It had horns on its head and wings on its back. Moreover, it had the body of an ape but the head of an ox. There was also a long tail with a sharp, bony point at the end.

“Lord Brahma, you damn bastard! After you were done with us, you then sealed us and used our power to raise your descendants! You damnable shameless bastard!” That huge monster let out a heaven-shaking roar.

An invisible ripple spread. Dan Yanxue, Kan Dongze, and Jiang Zijun were blown away, vomiting blood. Blood poured out of their ears and their heads almost exploded.

Horrified, the three of them summoned wings and fled. This monster was too terrifying.

“Oh? Damnable maggots, you’re definitely Lord Brahma’s descendants! Die!”

The monster let out a roar, and a huge claw slammed toward the three of them. Wherever the claw went, space was torn to shreds.

Qu Dajiang’s wings suddenly shook, and his body seemed to teleport a hundred miles away. This was his final burst of energy.

He managed to escape. But the exhausted Kan Dongze and Dan Yanxue were blown to pieces. Even their souls were turned to dust.

“Damn human race. Lord Brahma’s descendants are all shameless scammers! You can all die!”

The monster then sent another claw at Qu Dajiang.

“No!”

Qu Dajiang let out an unwilling roar, but he was powerless to run away. He was killed.

“Hmph, there’s another maggot? Die!”

The monster then turned toward the distant Long Chen. Its huge wings flapped once, and it tore through space, appearing beside Long Chen in an instant.

“Here!”

Long Chen tossed out Jiang Zijun behind him. He crashed into the monster’s head, while Long Chen continued fleeing.

The monster’s wings suddenly slammed into the lava, and a maelstrom erupted. Long Chen was like an ant blown into the air and further into the distance.

Jiang Zijun let out a sharp cry. He was powerless to resist as he flew closer and closer to the monster’s mouth. Jiang Zijun felt like he had entered a nightmare.

Just as he was about to reach the mouth, the mouth opened, and over a hundred teeth could be seen flickering with a cold light.

“NO-!”

When Jiang Zijun was about to enter its mouth, the monster blew out a breath of air. Who knew how many millennia it had been since the monster had brushed its teeth? The stench was overpowering.

However, this stench was better than the fragrance of flowers to Jiang Zijun, because he was still alive. He came to a pause, and his remaining upper body landed in a huge hand.

“Tell me, where is Lord Brahma?!” demanded the monster.

“I- I don’t know!” stuttered Jiang Zijun.

“If you don’t know, then just die!” FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

The monster clenched its hand, killing Jiang Zijun as easy as swatting a mosquito.

“Little fellow up ahead, I want to ask you some questions.” The monster suddenly called out to Long Chen.

“Little fellow?”

Long Chen was stunned. Not maggot? Could it be that there was room for discussion?

“Please, ask away. Junior will not hide anything that he knows. I am not Lord Brahma’s descendant. I came to kill his descendants. In fact, the reason you could break out of your seal was because of me. I was the one who removed the divine crystals from the formation!” cried out Long Chen. First, he brought up how he had no relationship with its enemies, then he mentioned that it owed him a favor.

“Tell me, do you know where Lord Brahma is?” demanded the monster as bluntly as ever. It didn’t seem to believe Long Chen.

“I don’t know where Lord Brahma is, but I know where his descendants are! I can bring you to them!”

“Really?”

“Of course! But before that, you have to agree to one of my conditions.”

“Bastard, do you know who you’re talking to? You dare to demand conditions from me? You want to die, is that it?!”

“Then fine, kill me. But let me warn you, other than me, everyone else here is Lord Brahma’s descendants. They won’t tell you any information. If you kill me, you’ll never find Lord Brahma.”

The monster was silent for a moment before it demanded, “What is your condition?”

“It’s very simple. I want you to kill every single one of Lord Brahma’s disciples in this world!” As Long Chen looked at this monster, a new plan hatched in his mind.
