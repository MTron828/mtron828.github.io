Chapter 3396 Lightning Falcon Race

After that finger moved, the donkey-faced man fell to the ground, and his body returned to its original form. He was actually a vulture.

His death stunned even Ying Bokong. Although Ying Bokong detested this fellow, the latter’s power was indeed slightly higher than his own. He had been suppressed for so many years, with his ranking never surpassing this fellow’s.

However, this old opponent of his was killed just like that, and it looked completely effortless. Because of this, he suddenly felt a chill.

Now he understood just how lucky he was that Long Chen hadn’t wanted to kill him. If he had, then there would no longer be a Ying Bokong in this world.

A single corpse at the Four Peak realm? Long Chen didn’t even bother taking it. Ying Bokong had those disciples put away the corpse and leave.

“Master, we should go too. The Ancient Orchid Domain is enormous. It will take a few days for us to reach the Auspicious Cloud Prefecture, and we’ll also need to worry about other experts,” said Ying Bokong respectfully once those disciples left.

Long Chen nodded. The Auspicious Cloud Prefecture was where all the heavenly geniuses of the entire star-field were gathering. All kinds of conflicts would erupt when such arrogant figures were stuffed into close proximity. Things would not be peaceful.F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

Long Chen felt that this was another way to eliminate the weaker people. The Sacred Pill Hall did not permit large-scale battles. Then it seemed that they could only allow these smaller-scale battles to occur.

The two of them then continued on their way. Other groups were moving carefully, but Long Chen didn’t care. He just followed the best path, unafraid of anyone.

They saw quite a few battlefields on the way along with some corpses. However, what irritated Long Chen was that those corpses were all human.

Based on the bloodstains, humans weren’t the only ones that had fought and died. It was simply that the corpses that weren’t of the human race had been taken away by others. Only the human corpses were left to rot in the wilderness.

Long Chen did have the urge to bury those people so that they could rest in peace, but thinking about the attitude of these humans, he shook his head. These pitiful people were also hateful. It wasn’t worth being sympathetic toward them.

“Kill!”

Suddenly, they saw sand and dust erupting, and battle roars shook the sky. A battle of thousands of experts had started.

After that, they saw giant birds flying, their claws raking through the air, tearing apart the clouds. Black pythons also surged through the air, unleashing black mist as they fought the divine birds.

“It’s the Scaled Eagle and the Black Python races. They’re mortal enemies. They’ll immediately start a life-and-death battle as soon as they see each other,” explained Ying Bokong.

The two of them arrived at the edge of the battlefield, and the battle seemed to already be over. After all, the number disparity between the two sides was immense. Clearly, the Black Python race must have launched a sneak attack against the other side.

Ying Bokong whispered that they should go around the battlefield. Although he wasn’t part of the Scaled Falcon race, they were both bird races. It was all too easy for him to be viewed as another enemy.

Furthermore, there were only two people in their group, and these experts might treat them as an easy target. But Long Chen ignored his suggestion and continued walking along the path, going by the edge of the battlefield.

The Black Python race instantly noticed Ying Bokong and narrowed their eyes. Their gazes turned toward the two of them.

Ying Bokong’s hair stood on end. Amongst these people were six whose auras were similar to his, as well as thousands of their underlings.

As expected, what he was afraid of occurred. Sensing no one else around, they immediately surrounded the two of them.

Long Chen didn’t even seem to see the experts blocking his way. He emotionlessly said, “If you don’t want to die, scram.” His footsteps were not slowing down at all.

“Little human, you dare to spout such big words? Die!”

The Black Python race’s experts shouted and collapsed on Long Chen.

“Fine.”

Long Chen raised a hand. After that, the temperature of the air instantly soared and countless flame runes danced in his hand.

“Raging Flame Prison.”

Flame pillars condensed, forming a giant flame prison. As a result, the Black Pythons in his way were all caught inside.

It rapidly shrank. Before the attacking Black Pythons even understood what was happening, it shrank into the size of a single fist.

As for the Black Pythons inside, they were crushed, turning into nothing more than blood mist that was incinerated by the flames. Their bodies and souls were wiped out.

The rest of the Black Pythons that weren’t inside the prison were terrified out of their minds. When they finally did recover their wits, they immediately fled for their lives.

As for Ying Bokong, his eyes almost popped out of his head. Long Chen had instantly killed so many experts. It was far too easy, like it didn’t require the slightest effort.

The absolute power that Long Chen had displayed finally terrified Ying Bokong. He even felt that their Falling Gate Star’s number one heavenly genius might not be a match for Long Chen.

The two of them then continued onward. Anyone who dared to block their path was directly wiped out by Long Chen. Long Chen didn’t encounter any powerful opponents on his way.

The domineeringness that Long Chen displayed made Ying Bokong lose any feelings of sadness at being defeated. Instead, he started to feel like being Long Chen’s servant wasn’t an embarrassing thing. Perhaps it was actually something for him to be proud of.

He didn’t need to dodge other people’s attacks now. Furthermore, when he ate the second pill from Long Chen, his feathers regrew and he directly summoned his true body, bringing Long Chen flying toward the Auspicious Cloud Domain.

It went without saying that with his silver feathers, Ying Bokong’s speed was amazing. He sliced through the air. The sight of him flying all-out drew the attention of countless experts, but those experts were even more shocked when they saw Long Chen on his back.

In the Integral Heaven Star-Field, it was always demonic beasts taking in humans as battle servants. They had never heard of a demonic beast submitting to a human. If a demonic beast was carrying a human, it was essentially becoming their mount.

Suddenly, a rumbling sound rang out in the distance, and a bolt of lightning shot through the air. Ying Bokong was flying at full power, but that bolt of lightning shot right past him, vanishing as quickly as it appeared. Its speed was astonishing.

Even Long Chen jumped in shock. It was his first time seeing such speed in the immortal world. Ying Bokong was already quite fast, but he was practically standing still in front of that bolt of lightning.

Long Chen had only vaguely seen a silver bird within the lightning. It wasn’t particularly big, perhaps only a few meters long. But its aura gave even Long Chen a sense of pressure. That was definitely a powerful existence.

Long Chen instantly put away his contempt. It seemed that the Integral Heaven Star-Field was actually quite powerful, and he simply hadn’t encountered those real experts yet. Such astonishing speed was a first for him. The person with that speed would be able to strike like lightning, giving no room to counterattack.

“The Lightning Falcon race’s emperor bloodline has also appeared,” said Ying Bokong, his voice quivering.
