Chapter 2715 The Sinister Play

“So quickly?”

Long Chen was startled. This was currently the time when everyone was resting and focusing entirely on increasing their realm.

At this moment, time was in the invaders’ favor, and it had only been a few days, so why would they launch an attack?

Tang Wan-er reported, “The alliance sent word that the Yin Yang World launched a sudden attack with one hundred thousand Heaven Merging experts. They caught us off guard, and by the time we gathered our forces, they retreated. However, then Devil Spirit Mountain attacked. There is also the demon race from the Ancient Battlefield and the Undying race of Resentful Death City. They all launched sudden attacks and pulled back just as we prepared to strike back.”

Long Chen nodded. “The Undying race, the Blood race, the devil race, and the demon race really are prudent. Even with such an advantage over us, they are still doing everything they can to increase their odds. They’re disturbing us so that we can’t properly cultivate.”

They had launched sneak attacks, but they were nothing more than disturbances. At the same time, they could also probe the real situation of the continent.

“Their sneak attacks killed over ten thousand of our Heaven Merging experts. That’s not a good omen. Those bastards are all hateful.” Tang Wan-er clenched her teeth furiously.

“War is simply like that. Any and all methods are used, and there are no rules to speak of. For victory, anything goes and that is the correct path.” Long Chen smiled and comforted Tang Wan-er. Even after all these years, she still had a child’s temper. Battle was not a game.

“How are you still smiling?” Tang Wan-er glared at him.

“What else should I do? Cry? If crying could win a battle, I don’t mind crying until the heavens are flooded.” Long Chen became serious. “Alright, did the report say anything about the power of these sneak attacks? What level have they reached?”

Tang Wan-er said, “The alliance’s news said that their main force was composed of newly advanced Heaven Merging experts. The senior Heaven Merging experts were just in charge of directing the troops. However, these new Heaven Merging experts have reached the mid realm, somewhere between the fourth Heavenstage and the fifth Heavenstage…”

“So high?” Long Chen was startled.

It had only been a bit more than ten days since the tribulation. How had they reached the mid Heaven Merging realm?

Even with the Dragonblood warriors focusing on cultivation and the assistance of medicinal pills, Gu Yang and the others had only reached the second Heavenstage.

There were also some sects that had disciples forcibly raise their realms regardless of risks to their foundations. However, even so, only over five hundred people on the entire continent had reached the third Heavenstage.

Those people had sacrificed their foundations in order to increase their cultivation speed. But even so, their enemies had advanced to the mid Heaven Merging realm. That speed truly caused despair.

“Exactly! It’s crazy! Their sneak attacks didn’t cause too many casualties for the continent, but it’s a serious blow to the continent’s morale,” said Tang Wan-er.

The fact that Long Chen had destroyed the karmic luck pearl, resulting in the continent no longer being able to produce a Sovereign was already a heavy stone on people’s hearts. But now, adding on the enemies’ terrifying cultivation speed, they couldn’t see the slightest hope. No matter how they cultivated with their lives on the line, it was meaningless. The difference was too great.

“This is most likely intentional. They want our confidence to collapse, so I would guess that they created these troops just for this attack. With such rapid cultivation, it’s no longer a matter of their foundations growing unsteady. Their cultivation bases are essentially set in stone. They will never advance again. Each world sacrificed a hundred thousand people just to shake our confidence. Hehe, they have some guts,” said Long Chen. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

He refused to believe that there was a way to allow someone who had just advanced to Heaven Merging to reach the fourth or fifth Heavenstage without some kind of price.

“The Xuan Master is of the same opinion. He said that this is mental warfare, and they definitely won’t stop with just this. As they shake our confidence, they also disturb our cultivation, forcing us to be too nervous to cultivate properly,” said Tang Wan-er.

Long Chen smiled. “The Xuan Master is correct. Did he say how we should counter them?”

“He did not.”

Long Chen was somewhat speechless. “Alright, then I guess he left this problem to me.”

However, thinking about it, he supposed that this was the correct call. He was currently the hope of the Martial Heaven Continent. If he was the one to settle this problem, it would raise the continent’s morale much more, and he would shatter their enemies’ mental warfare.

“Then what should we do?” asked Tang Wan-er.

“What else? We’ll strike back. We must have the initiative in our hands, or we’ll slowly be suffocated to death. Have the Dragonblood Legion go out and split into four to attack the four worlds. Have them work with Mo Nian and Zi Yan. Wilde also came back yesterday, and Zhiqiu has come out of seclusion. Every group will have a supreme divine item protecting them,” said Long Chen.

“Will that work? What if they fall into our enemies’ trap? Furthermore, if they encounter someone like the High Priest, they’ll be in danger.” Tang Wan-er was not at ease with such a plan.

“In truth, their sneak attacks are entirely unnecessary. We’re already weaker than them. They have experts that need to become Sovereigns, and that requires gathering the power of an entire world. By sneak attacking us, they’ve ended up reminding me what we should be doing. We will strike their worlds, disturbing the laws of their worlds so that the Alldevil Heavenwalker, the Blood Fiend Devil Lord, and the others are unable to become Sovereigns as quickly. That will win us precious time. If they don’t become Sovereigns, they won’t dare to enter the Martial Heaven Continent,” said Long Chen.

The Blood Fiend Devil Lord, the Alldevil Heavenwalker, Ye Ming, and the Nine-Headed Lion had all been defeated by Long Chen. If they wanted vengeance, they had to become Sovereigns first. Otherwise, they wouldn’t dare to find trouble for Long Chen again, or they would be purely courting death.

“Then what about us refining pills?” asked Tang Wan-er. If they weren’t here refining pills, the Dragonblood Legion would have their cultivation speed slowed down greatly.

“We’ll be refining pills here as usual. We don’t need to bother with them. Didn’t I already say that Mo Nian will be there? He can direct everyone. We’ll just come over if they need us,” said Long Chen.

“You’re not going?” asked Tang Wan-er, surprised.

“No. I want to focus entirely on refining pills. Once there are enough, I need to go look for the Eastern Wasteland Bell,” said Long Chen.

Long Chen then called over Meng Qi and the others. He had them stop with their refinement of the ordinary Heaven Merging Pills because they already had enough to last the Dragonblood Legion a long time.

Instead, they helped him refine demonic pills. Once he had enough, he would go out in search of the Eastern Wasteland Bell, leaving his clone to refine the ordinary Heaven Merging Pills with Meng Qi and the others.

Just as they were refining the demonic Heaven Merging Pills as quickly as possible, the Dragonblood Legion received his orders and began to mobilize.
