Chapter 3106 Absolute Power

The arm bracers shone with divine light, and a strange roar rang out, shaking people’s ears. A fierce and wild aura then erupted.

BOOM!

The earth collapsed and Long Chen was sent flying.

Long Chen took seven steps in the air before stabilizing. A trace of shock appeared in his eyes.

“The soul essence of an ancient beast? That’s good stuff.”

Those arm bracers were priceless treasures that had the soul essence of an ancient beast sealed in them. It had even been subdued, and with essence blood, it could be awakened for immense power.

“Long Chen, these arm bracers are priceless treasures of my Chu family. For you to die in front of them is your glory. Face your death!” Chu Gan’s arms shone as he charged at Long Chen, taking the initiative to counterattack.

Long Chen sneered, “Do you think you can control its power with your weak body?”

Just like that, Long Chen spread his fingers. That arm became covered in scales and reached for Chu Gan’s fist. When the fist and palm collided, the anticipated explosion didn’t occur, and there was only a muffled bang.

However, Chu Gan’s expression completely changed. He was shocked to find that the power of his bracers had vanished like a stone falling into a sea. Long Chen had actually absorbed his power.

He tried to pull back, but his fist was caught in Long Chen’s hand. Just at that moment, Long Chen’s foot landed on his armpit.

“AHH!”

Chu Gan screamed miserably as Long Chen crushed his bones and forcibly tore off his arm.

“What?!”

This sudden change caused everyone to jump. Just as they thought that Chu Gan’s activated Treasure items would put Long Chen at a disadvantage, Long Chen managed to land a heavy blow.

“Long Chen’s power is absolutely terrifying. He’s actually able to absorb Chu Gan’s power and reverse it on him,” said Luo Xue, her face covered in shock.

She had clearly sensed that when Long Chen’s foot landed, it contained Chu Gan’s aura within it.

In martial study, borrowing power to attack was a very common sight. But the absolute majority of cases of this involved borrowing natural power, or perhaps using special objects like Treasure items to temporarily store the power.

Relying on your own power to reverse your opponent’s power was very rare because such a thing required your own power to be several times greater in order to not be deathly dangerous. Otherwise, the slightest slip would cause your opponent’s power to explode within your own body.

However, Long Chen easily reversed his opponent’s power. That calm and ease with which he did this shocked her. Just how much power did Long Chen have in his body? He was able to endure that power easily.

It wasn’t just Luo Xue who saw the clues. Many peak experts also saw just how crazy this was, and it was precisely due to this that they were so shocked.

“This fellow really is a monster.” Even Bai Shishi was shaken. Clearly, Long Chen didn’t want to use his own power because he didn’t want to expose his abilities, which was why he had borrowed his opponents’ power.

After tearing off Chu Gan’s arm, he tossed it into the primal chaos space. As quick as lightning, his palm reached for Chu Gan’s head.

Having just lost an arm, Chu Gan was filled with pain. In the face of Long Chen’s killing blow, he instinctively raised his other arm to block. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

As a result, this arm was also ripped off. Long Chen’s voice was like violent thunder as he ripped it off.

Chu Gan’s physical body was tough, but compared to Long Chen’s, there was a definite difference. That was especially true after Chu Gan had just lost an arm. His scattered Blood Qi resulted in his defensive power sharply dropping, so it hadn’t required much effort to rip off his other arm.

“Nice!” Long Chen tossed this arm into the primal chaos space as well. Just like that, he had obtained two Treasure items. He was a bit moved inside.

With his other arm torn off, Chu Gan felt terror. There was no way for him to condense new arms in a short time. Without his hands, he couldn’t activate his tablet to even admit defeat.

Long Chen once more reached out for Chu Gan’s head. After obtaining his bracers, Long Chen no longer had any use for Chu Gan. Although those underpants might be a Treasure item, he wasn’t interested in them.

Long Chen’s palm slammed into Chu Gan’s head, but just at that moment, divine light erupted above the head. Long Chen’s palm ended up smashing into that divine light, shattering it.

However, when the divine light shattered, his palm landed on nothing more than air. Chu Gan had vanished.

Long Chen was startled. Chu Gan had lost both of his arms, and his aura was in chaos. There was no way he could activate a magical art or divine ability so quickly in that situation.

Long Chen then looked around. The martial stage had returned to its original appearance. In other words, Chu Gan had admitted defeat and the match was over.

This sudden change caught even Long Chen off guard, so he remained in this posture for a long time. The crowd was silent.

Just as they thought that Chu Gan was about to be slain, such a change had occurred. This result made no sense to them.

Long Chen was sent out just then, and people immediately burst into a discussion. Luo Xue asked him, “What happened? He didn’t have the power to activate his tablet at that time.”

They had thought that Long Chen had ripped off Chu Gan’s arms to make sure the latter couldn’t admit defeat. In truth, Long Chen was more interested in the arm bracers. If Chu Gan was killed, his things would be sent out along with his corpse. Even if he died without a corpse, his things would be returned.

In any case, he had lost his arms. It made no sense for him to be able to still escape. Furthermore, the divine light that had appeared in that last moment to protect him was also inexplicable.

Long Chen muttered to himself for a moment before looking at Luo Qing. “Miss Luo Qing, you should directly admit defeat for your battle with Chu Zhen.”

“What?”

Everyone was startled. Luo Xue, Luo Qing, Luo Bing, and Luo Ning in particular didn’t believe their ears. How could the Luo family’s disciples admit defeat to the Chu family’s disciples?

“Did you notice something?” In the end, it was Luo Xue who was the steadiest and asked the important question.

Long Chen nodded. “If my guess is correct, those four fellows of the Chu family have a strange method of combining forces that isn’t restricted by the martial stage’s formation. Just now, Chu Gan was saved by them.”

“But… how is that possible?!” People stared at him in disbelief.
