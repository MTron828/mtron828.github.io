Chapter 4415 What Course to Follow

Everyone watched as Little Crane transformed into her rainbow crane form and flew around Ye Ling. A cascade of rainbow light emanated from her, enveloping Ye Ling.

As Little Crane danced in the air, holy light fell from her. Despite the recent bloodshed, her dance purified the atmosphere, transforming the battleground into a peaceful holy land.

This marked the third time Long Chen witnessed Little Crane's captivating dance. Each time, he found himself drawn to the beauty and grace of her natural movements, which made him forget all his vexations.

The members of the Earth Spirit race were entranced, seemingly forgetting the purpose of the dance—to save their Saint.

As she danced, auspicious qi gathered, and the gemstone on Ye Ling’s forehead slowly lit up.

After a while, Ye Ling’s pale face gradually recovered some color, and her aura grew more active.

The Earth Spirit race’s experts were overjoyed to see that their Saint could be saved. If it wasn’t because they were worried about disturbing Little Crane, they would have started cheering.

As more auspicious energy gathered, Ye Ling's eyelids fluttered, and she gradually opened her eyes.

Long Chen then felt a vast power flow into her, realizing that Little Crane was not only preventing Ye Ling’s realm from dropping but also fully healing her wounds.

When Little Crane was done, she stopped dancing and transformed into the form of a little girl. Her forehead was now covered in sweat.

Seeing this scene, Long Chen felt a wave of heartache and hastily took out a handkerchief to gently wipe her sweat away. Following that, Ye Ling immediately rose from her position and bowed to Little Crane, expressing her gratitude according to their ancient etiquette.

“Thank you, great rainbow crane. The Earth Spirit race will never forget your favor.”

“Big sister, you don’t need to thank me. I still haven’t grown up and am too weak; otherwise, I would be able to resolve the bindings of the Heavenly Daos on you. I’m sorry,” said Little Crane apologetically.

Hearing that, Long Chen and Ye Ling were shocked. Resolve the bindings of the Heavenly Daos? Wasn’t that a heaven-defying power?

If the bindings of the Heavenly Daos were undone, wouldn’t Ye Ling be able to use the power of a Saint in this world?

Even though Long Chen had been with Little Crane all this time, he still didn’t know much about the rainbow crane race’s power. Hearing that she had such an ability, Long Chen was stunned.

A sudden thought then popped into his mind.

No wonder the High Firmament Academy has so many experts. Is it related to the existence of the rainbow crane race there?

“Don’t be sorry. You healed me and even recovered my energy. I am already endlessly grateful,” stated Ye Ling hastily.

Long Chen wiped away Little Crane’s sweat and found that her eyes were still bright. As she showed no sign of falling into a slumber again, Long Chen was at ease.

This meant that healing Ye Ling’s wounds didn’t put too much of a burden on Little Crane, so she didn’t need to rest.

Following that, Long Chen had Bally accompany Little Crane to play, and a group of the Earth Spirit race’s experts immediately came forward to accompany them. Little Crane had never encountered these lifeforms before, so she played happily with them.

Seeing her happy, Long Chen smiled. It felt like as long as Little Crane was happy, nothing in this world could vex him.

The auspicious qi Little Crane had gathered had yet to scatter even though she was no longer dancing. Seizing the opportunity, Long Chen directed the injured Earth Spirit race experts to absorb it for their recovery. To further aid their healing, Long Chen distributed medicinal pills for the ones with serious wounds. These were all top-grade pills with immense medicinal effect.

Moreover, having never consumed medicinal pills before, they didn’t have the slightest resistance to medicinal energy. As a result, the pills were much more effective on them, healing their heavy wounds in just a few breaths.

“Words cannot express my gratitude anymore. However, I will still thank you, hero of the human race.” Seeing that Long Chen’s medicinal pills were helping all of her people recover, Ye Ling solemnly thanked Long Chen.

“I am Long Chen. You can just call me by name, and I’ll call you race leader Ye Ling. Please don’t be too courteous. If you keep bowing, then I have to return the bow. In the end, who knows how long it will take for us to say anything? My waist can’t handle it,” laughed Long Chen.

The Spirit race was a race that respected ancient etiquettes, and the Earth Spirit race was the same. Long Chen wouldn’t reject such customs, but there was no need for such a thing when they were already so familiar with each other.

Seeing Ye Ling smile and nod, Long Chen asked, “Race leader Ye Ling, what do you plan to do now?”

In an instant, Ye Ling’s expression grew heavier. She looked at her people. Realizing that she had something important to discuss, they then distanced themselves.

“To tell the truth, I’m not sure what to do either.” Ye Ling let out a deep sigh. “I found that I’m a very disappointing race leader. I was unable to protect them and have fallen short of fulfilling the trust bestowed upon me by the previous generation. The Earth Spirit race has constantly declined under my leadership, and I could only watch as my people fell to the blades of our enemies…”

Ye Ling couldn’t stop a few tears from leaking out. Long Chen then flicked his finger, and violet qi condensed into a barrier around them. He didn’t want the rest of the Earth Spirit race to see her like this.

As the creator of the Dragonblood Legion, Long Chen understood this feeling of helplessness very well. Ye Ling wanted to protect her entire race, yet she was powerless to do so. Such a feeling was more agonizing than death itself.

“Thank you.”

Ye Ling hastily wiped away her tears, doing her best to remain calm. As the race leader, she had to retain her composure.

However, after being pursued to the brink of death, she had watched many of her people die. As a result, her mental state was starting to waver.

“Are you truly determined not to seek assistance from the Spirit race? If they were to learn of the situation, they would definitely come to help you,” suggested Long Chen.

Feeling down, she immediately said, “We cannot. No matter what, we cannot. We have the fiend curse on us. If we come into contact with the Spirit race, our curse will infect their pure souls.”

As expected, it was as Bally said. The Earth Spirit race would rather die than implicate the Spirit race.

“Race leader Ye Ling, I want to know what this fiend curse is,” said Long Chen.

“It’s a long story. If we start from the beginning, I suppose it originated with someone from your human race,” said Ye Ling.

“Who?”

“Lord Brahma.”𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m
