Chapter 4051 Primal Chaos Divine Item Heaven Earth Cauldron

“Qingxuan, you…!”

Long Chen was startled. Yu Qingxuan’s words made him sober up a bit.

“Long Chen, I know that you love me, but I can’t be selfish. If big sister Meng Qi treats me this well, how can I marry you here? What about big sister Meng Qi and the others?” said Yu Qingxuan softly.

“But…”

“There’s no buts. Big sister Meng Qi wants you to marry me, but I know that big sister Meng Qi is the heart of your heart. I would be letting down big sister Meng Qi if I were to marry you like this. You know that I don’t care about ranking. All I want is to be at peace.” Yu Qingxuan’s voice was soft but firm.

Long Chen was moved, but he also felt guilty. Yu Qingxuan was advocating for him, while Meng Qi was advocating for Yu Qingxuan. The love of such women was something difficult to repay even if he tore apart his own body.

This feast was originally prepared for Yu Qingxuan. Since they didn’t have much time, it was supposed to be a simple wedding ceremony.

However, Yu Qingxuan actually rejected this wedding, so Jiang Huixin could only end things here. After the simple feast, Yu Qingxuan was sent off by Jiang Huixin and the others. She then joined Long Chen at the transportation formation.

“Qingxuan, I know that we can’t keep you here. Your father and I know that an eagle must one day spread their wings and fly away from the nest. But no matter how far or high you fly in the future, remember that when you’re tired, you will always have a home in the Vermilion Bird Empire.” Jiang Huixin held Yu Qingxuan’s hands with teary eyes.

She knew that once Yu Qingxuan left, she would be like a kite whose string was cut. It was unknown whether they would even meet again in this life. As her mother, Jiang Huixin was even more unwilling to part with her daughter.

“Mom, forgive your child for being unfilial…” Yu Qingxuan was also crying. She also didn’t want to leave her mother.

“Alright, good child, look after yourself! Go!” Jiang Huixin knew that this would only make leaving harder for Yu Qingxuan. Hence, she wiped away her tears and sent them to the transportation formation.

“Don’t worry, I will definitely look after Qingxuan,” promised Long Chen.

Jiang Huixin nodded and waved her hand, bidding them farewell. After that, Guo Ran, Xia Chen, and all the Dragonblood warriors stepped onto the transportation formation as well.

Yu Qianxue, Zhu Yunwen, Zhu Yifeng, and the others all waved goodbye to Long Chen. They thought back to how they had barged through the trial by fire with him. They thought of how they had fought alongside him. They didn’t want him to leave, but they knew that Long Chen was a dragon, and the Vermilion Bird Empire was too small to contain him. Perhaps even the entire Violet Flame Heaven was too small. He had to soar in an even vaster sky.

The transportation formation glowed once more before Long Chen and the others vanished. Once they were gone, Jiang Huixin finally couldn’t hold back her tears.

“I’m sorry. I’m a coward to have made you endure this. You didn’t deserve it.” Just then, an apologetic voice rang out. It was Yu Xiaoyun.

Only then did people realize that he hadn’t truly passed out from the wine. He simply didn’t have the courage to watch as Yu Qingxuan left.

They all felt bitter about having Yu Qingxuan leave them as a child. Amongst all their children, they owed Yu Qingxuan the most, but they could only give her the least.

Since they couldn’t give her anything, they could only endure the pain of letting go and letting her pursue her own happiness. As long as she was happy, they could endure any pain.

“Xiaoyun!” Jiang Huixin directly fell into Yu Xiaoyun’s embrace and wept. Yu Xiaoyun then comforted her. Looking at the empty transportation formation, he sighed, “Raising a daughter is like growing a flower. You protect it, water it, and nourish it. In winter, you worry about the cold and in summer, you worry about the sun. But when she one day grows up, she is taken by a bastard called a son-in-law.”

Suddenly, Yu Xiaoyun turned toward Yu Qianxue and the other princesses. “All of you, remember! My daughters can only marry in, not out! I don’t want to see any shameless bastards like Long Chen again!”

All the princesses, including Yu Qianxue, looked at each other in baffled silence. From the start, the Vermilion Bird Empire’s princesses had never married out, no?

…

The void quivered. The scenery before Long Chen and the others then changed as they appeared in a barren wasteland.

The Vermilion Bird Empire had sent them off on a transportation formation with no fixed node. That way, no one would be able to tell where they had gone based on the spatial fluctuations.

“Boss, are we really leaving just like that? We just did something that shook the nine heavens! We should bask in that glory!” grumbled Guo Ran.

It had to be known that Guo Ran had truly shown off a brilliant light this time. On the battlefield, he had led the Dragonblood Legion in killing many Earth Venerates.Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

Now was his time to become famous, but instead he was silently running away. He was a bit unwilling to accept that. At the very least, he had to let others know what he looked like.

“Can you grow up a bit? Did you not see how serious senior Ye Wusheng was when she warned us? An expert on her level might come to find boss! What are we going to use to stop someone like that?” scolded Xia Chen.

Guo Ran simply had to let the world know about everything he did, or he would never settle down. He was just like Mo Nian. But Mo Nian didn’t bother intentionally announcing himself. His fame was built up through his own abilities.

“Do you think that you won’t have a chance to make a name for yourself when you follow me? The main thing is that taking out the bronze cauldron at the end probably poked the bear’s nest,” said Long Chen.

Even the dragon expert had told him not to use the cauldron, or countless terrifying existences would hunt him down.

Ye Wusheng had said the same thing. She clearly recognized its origins, which was why she wanted Long Chen to quickly leave.

“Boss, just what is this bronze cauldron from the three thousand worlds? I’ve flipped through all the ancient records that I could access, but I didn’t find anything about it!” said Guo Ran.

“How would I know?” retorted Long Chen.

Buzz.

Just then, a jade tablet on Long Chen’s waist flashed rapidly. Looking at it, he was delighted. It was the Huayun Trading Company’s message.

However, when he read the message, his expression stiffened, and shock gradually filled his face.

“Boss, what is it?” asked Guo Ran hastily.

Long Chen didn’t reply and simply handed the tablet to Guo Ran. Xia Chen impatiently stepped forward to take a look.

“One of the ten great primal chaos divine items, the Heaven Earth Cauldron, appeared within the Vermilion Bird Empire, shattering the dome of the heavens as well as the ten thousand Daos. Its qi is Yin and its character is soft, so it is suspected to be the Earth Cauldron of the Heaven Earth Cauldron. This information has already spread and shaken the nine heavens. Seek asylum as quickly as possible.”

“Primal chaos divine item, the Heaven Earth Cauldron?”

Everyone was completely shocked by this.
