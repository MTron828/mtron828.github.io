The two golden bulls were as big as mountains, with giant horns growing out of their heads. Their hooves shook the world as they stamped across the void.

Both of these golden bulls were Earth Saint demonic beasts. As divine mounts, they made the war chariot they were pulling appear even more domineering.

Upon becoming a disciple of the Long clan, even outer disciples could get a war chariot of the Long clan.

Although all the war chariots had similar designs, their size indicated a person’s status. An outer disciple’s chariot was about the size of a regular palanquin, only a few meters long, with simple runes.

Inner disciples had chariots several times larger, with more decorative designs. Moreover, the interior of the chariots was adorned with ornaments to make them more comfortable.

However, the chariot before them was like a mountain, sparkling gloriously and exuding a suffocating feeling of wealth. The dragon image on it was exceptionally domineering, giving off a feeling of being completely unrivaled.

The chariot headed in Long Chen’s direction. However, it flew over their heads without stopping. The two golden bulls simply pulled it past them, leaving behind only a loud rumbling.

Everyone stared at that luxurious chariot enviously, including Gui Jiu.

“Rank ten on the Heaven Rankings. Who would have thought we would get to see his chariot?” Fang Liude sighed emotionally.

That was a true heavenly genius, someone they wouldn’t be able to compare to in this lifetime. They didn’t even know what he looked like, but seeing his chariot already satisfied them.

“How many people are on the Heaven Rankings? How strong are they?” asked Long Chen.Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

Gui Jiu answered, “The Long clan’s heavenly geniuses are split into the Heaven, Earth, and Mortal Rankings. Each of them has five hundred people on them.”

“And what rank are you?” asked Long Chen.

Gui Jiu was a bit embarrassed. “I’m ranked sixteen on the Earth Rankings.”

Hearing this, Fang Liude and the others were shocked. So Gui Jiu was actually on the Earth Rankings and was ranked near the top.

To even qualify for these rankings, one had to be at least a nine star Doyen. Without that level of power, they weren’t even considered.

An eight star Doyen like Huanghui wasn’t qualified to be listed anywhere. He wasn’t even fit to carry the shoes of someone on the Mortal Rankings. Consequently, he was often bullied and vented his resentment toward those weaker than him.

Long Chen nodded. Gui Jiu’s power was much greater than when they had fought back then. He had clearly benefited from being in the Long clan. But even with his power, he could only stay in the Earth Rankings, which showed how strong the foundation of the Long can was.

“You don’t know this, but I was still unconvinced after you crushed my head. It was only when I saw you slaughter Mortal Saints and Earth Saints in front of the gate that I realized how lucky I was to keep this life of mine. After Saint Emperor Zhantian completely crushed a Heaven Saint with his clone, I realized how insignificant I was. After thinking about it, I decided to go to the Heavenly Desolation Long clan, passing the trials and becoming an inner disciple. Here, I experienced that one can find a handful of geniuses just by reaching out their hands.

“Furthermore, these geniuses also train like their lives are on the line. They’re like madmen when it comes to cultivation, and their power can suddenly soar in a matter of a day. For example, the person I beat yesterday could come back and beat me half-dead today. My position on the Earth Rankings hasn’t budged in two months. Instead of advancing, I’m constantly in danger of falling off,” said Gui Jiu bitterly.

In his family, Gui Jiu was considered a peak expert, which made him arrogant enough to be deceived by the Celestial race. When he heard this was his chance for fame and treasure, he directly attacked Long Chen. But after being crushed, he joined the Long clan. He thought he would leap to the Heaven Rankings instantly, but he found himself stuck on the Earth Rankings, and it took him immense effort just to maintain his position.

Later, with the Long clan’s support, his power advanced significantly. The Long clan’s foundation was truly astonishing. They dominated the entire Heavenly Desolation, with an inheritance stretching back countless years. Gui Jiu realized just how much of a frog at the bottom of a well he had been.

“What if you got your second head back? Would you be able to get to the Heaven Rankings?” asked Long Chen.

“It would be close. If I still had my second head, I should be able to get into the top three of the Earth Rankings. However, I really have no assurance when it comes to the Heaven Rankings. There are too many monstrous geniuses there,” replied Gui Jiu helplessly.

If he still had his other head, his power would at least double. But even so, he wasn’t confident about getting on the Heaven Rankings.

“Interesting. It seems that I underestimated the Long clan,” said Long Chen as he rubbed his jaw.

If Gui Jiu was telling the truth—that he wouldn’t be able to get on the Heaven Rankings even with his second head—then the geniuses on the Long clan’s Heaven Rankings were undoubtedly of an extremely high level.

“There’s no way around it. The people on the Heaven Rankings get so much better treatment. For example, everyone in the top fifty gets a chance to enter the Heavenly Fate Divine Pool. If they’re lucky, they can awaken a Heavenly Fate Ring, making them half a Heavenly Chosen. Do you know what a Heavenly Chosen is? They’re the strongest existences in this world. Long Ziwei, who just flew by, awakened his Heavenly Fate Ring when he underwent the Heavenly Fate Divine Pool’s baptism. As his power soared, his position on the rankings is now unshakable,” said Gui Jiu. Just talking about the Heavenly Fate Divine Pool made him excited.

Heavenly Fate Divine Pool? Heavenly Chosen? They were things Fang Liude had never even heard of. However, seeing how excited Gui Jiu was, they felt incredibly tiny.

“The Long clan actually has such a treasure?” asked Long Chen, surprised. Something that could turn people into half Heavenly Chosen was definitely heaven-defying.

Gui Jiu replied, “That’s not even all of it. I heard that they have an even more amazing treasure, one that has been passed down from the primal chaos era. However, I don’t know what kind of treasure it is. I just heard that it’s even more magical.”

“Amazing.” Long Chen nodded. Something from the primal chaos era? It had to be unimaginably precious.

“Are you here to get on the rankings?” asked Gui Jiu excitedly.

Shaking his head, Long Chen answered, “I’m not interested in the Long clan’s things. Once I gather some medicinal ingredients that I need, I’m leaving.”

Hearing that, Gui Jiu was disappointed as he wanted to know what rank Long Chen could get. However, if Long Chen wasn’t interested, then he couldn’t do anything about it.

In front of the gate to the ninth heaven, Long Chen had fought all those experts alone. Just how domineering had he been? Even after getting his head crushed, Gui Jiu couldn’t hold a grudge against Long Chen. That was because true experts could only look up to the strong.

As Long Chen was preparing to bid Gui Jiu farewell and bring Fang Liude out to gather the medicinal ingredient, the void exploded. Two giant bulls pulling a grand chariot appeared again.

A powerful pressure crashed down, covering this entire era. Fang Liude and his companions instantly collapsed, unable to move under this pressure. Even Gui Jiu went pale, his body shaking. However, there was a hint of anticipation in his eyes.

“Long Chen, is it? Come and face your death!”

An arrogant shout came from within the chariot. The two bulls charged toward Long Chen, as if intending to crush him to bits.
