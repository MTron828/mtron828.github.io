A dragon cry came from Evilmoon, which slashed toward Lu Zichuan. The current Long Chen seemed to be possessed by a devil. His killing intent merged with Evilmoon’s fiendish air.

A giant saber-image arrived in front of Lu Zichuan. With a cold snort, instead of dodging, Lu Zichuan raised his black sword in front of him.

BOOM!

Lu Zichuan’s black sword actually blocked Long Chen’s terrifying attack just like that, shocking others.

“People say that your power is unrivaled within the same generation, but it’s only on this level. Try to receive one of my attacks!” Lu Zichuan sneered, slashing his white sword at Long Chen. It was quick as lightning, unleashing a ray of sword-light.

Long Chen narrowed his eyes. His lightning wings suddenly flapped, and he dodged to the left. Lu Zichuan’s sword-light slashed right by him.

The sword-light instantly carved a bottomless gorge into the ground, stretching far behind the horizon.

“Who knew that this Lu Zichuan was so powerful?” Shocked cries rang out. Long Chen had always used power to suppress others, but this Lu Zichuan was actually able to receive his attacks and didn’t seem to find it very taxing.

“Long Chen, you don’t even dare to receive one of my attacks? Are you really such a coward? It seems that all your fame is fake!” sneered Lu Zichuan disdainfully.

He then sheathed his swords behind him, as if he was looking down on Long Chen and was unwilling to lower himself to attack.

“How laughable. Do you think this kind of trick is enough against me?” Long Chen laughed. Ignoring Lu Zichuan, he slashed Evilmoon behind him, meeting a blood-colored spear that had been sneak-attacking him. The master of the spear was Xie Luo who had sent flying before.

Suddenly, the sky shuddered. A giant meteorite came crashing down from the heavens. It appeared out of nowhere, without anyone expecting it.

BOOM!

The giant meteorite smashed into the ground, and flames exploded out of it. That expert from Pill Valley appeared. He was surrounded by flames, but he was already sweating.

“Heavenly Meteorites!” That expert let out a cry, and another meteorite fell from the sky. It was even bigger than the last.

Looking up, everyone gasped. There were actually eight more meteorites in the sky that had appeared at some point without anyone realizing it.

“What a powerful technique!” People couldn’t help being shocked. Such a grand technique had actually been used without anyone being the wiser.

Suddenly, a saber-image tore through the sky, slicing apart the meteorite that was on the ground. Long Chen came flying out.

Rumbling rang out as the eight meteorites smashed into the ground. However, Long Chen had already escaped, so they were meaningless.

After avoiding that flame expert’s attack, he swung Evilmoon, blowing away the attacks from two other Empyreans. He then dodged Xiong Tianba’s rod, weaving through his enemies to once more attack Lu Zichuan.

“A defeated coward also dares to come at me?” sneered Lu Zichuan. His black sword casually struck Evilmoon.

The two divine weapons clashed, causing only a muffled sound. There were no terrifying shockwaves.

Lu Zichuan’s expression suddenly changed, while Long Chen smiled. “What is it? Is your trick not good enough?”

Long Chen suddenly sent a kick straight at Lu Zichuan’s head. Lu Zichuan hastily twisted back, and his white sword slashed at Long Chen’s leg.

However, before he could slash it off, he was instead struck by a lightning spear.

Lu Zichuan coughed up a mouthful of blood. With a muffled groan, he flew back.

“What’s going on?” Startled cries rang out. Just before this, Lu Zichuan had been so domineering that he practically hadn’t placed Long Chen in his eyes. Long Chen hadn’t even dared to face his attack directly.

Even Xie Luo and the others were startled. Just what had happened to the unrivaled Lu Zichuan?

“Your constant provocations toward me should be because you didn’t want me to be calm enough to figure out your trick, right?” sneered Long Chen, shooting after him.

Di Feng’s three divine items merged into one, and his body became covered in divine light. He appeared before Long Chen, blocking him with a runic shield.

When Long Chen’s saber met his shield, the shield exploded, while Di Feng borrowed the power to fly back. However, he had managed to stop Long Chen’s advance.

At this moment, millions of spirit swords flew over. Leng Wufeng was also attacking.

They all wished to defeat Long Chen themselves, winning the crown of the number one expert of the junior generation, but now they found that it was just a beautiful dream.

Long Chen was too powerful, and no one could defeat him on their own. Furthermore, if they allowed him to escape today, considering his ruthless nature, they wouldn’t be able to rest in peace in the future.

So seeing Lu Zichuan in trouble, the others hastily went to assist him. If any one of their group of thirteen was killed or heavily injured, that would give Long Chen a chance to escape. They couldn’t permit such a thing.

Long Chen was forced to spread his lightning wings, blowing away the sea of swords. But as a result, he lost his best chance to chase after Lu Zichuan.

Just as he broke apart the sea of swords, three sharp attacks came flying toward him. He was forced to block and was knocked back. Then other attacks came, and Long Chen was forced to go all-out defending.

“Long Chen looks to be in trouble.”

“Only once an Empyrean awakens their manifestation are they a true Empyrean. This kind of power is far greater than ours. Even Long Chen might die.”

“But to fight against thirteen Empyreans with awakened manifestations, this battle only proves that Long Chen is the number one figure, even if he dies here.”

Seeing the thirteen of them forming an iron wall around Long Chen, they couldn’t help feeling emotional. Most of them had been let in by Long Chen. Although he had made them pay a protection fee, they hadn’t needed to use the barrier breaking beads. That money had definitely been money well spent.

So by now, they no longer felt that much resentment toward Long Chen. Seeing an expert like him surrounded, they couldn’t help feeling admiration. If he died like this, they wouldn’t feel good about it, but they also couldn’t help him.

Being surrounded, Long Chen tried to break through their blockade several times but failed. Perhaps if it was one on one, he wouldn’t fear any of them. But being surrounded by thirteen of them was extremely dangerous for him. The more time that passed, the worse the situation would be for him.

If the thirteen of them learned how to cooperate better, it would be the final nail in his coffin. Any of his techniques would be interrupted.

Thinking of that, Long Chen took a deep breath. He suddenly soared into the sky and raised Evilmoon.

“Stop him!” shouted Di Feng. He knew that this was the preparation for the seventh form of Split the Heavens. That was an explosive attack that none of them wished to receive. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

What they wished to do was slowly grind out Long Chen’s energy. The more time passed, the greater their advantage. There was no need to take this risk.

Long Chen’s saber was aimed toward Xie Luo. At the same time, his wings spread, forming a barrier around him.

The others roared, attacking with their divine items. Long Chen’s lightning wings immediately exploded, and Long Chen coughed up a mouthful of blood. His back was badly mutilated by the power that got through his lightning wings. Even with the Azure Dragon Battle Armor, he couldn’t receive so many attacks at once.

Even though he was injured, they did not manage to interrupt the seventh form of Split the Heavens. A giant saber-image tore toward Xie Luo. Space trembled.

Xie Luo’s expression changed. There was no way for him to receive this attack. But if he didn’t receive it, it would create an opening in their formation, and Long Chen would take advantage of that to run. However, receiving it meant that he would definitely die. This was Long Chen’s death blow that contained all his power.

In the end, Xie Luo didn’t have the courage to face death. He chose to avoid this attack. However, just as he moved, another figure took his place, blocking Long Chen’s path.

“Want to run? Keep dreaming!”

Lu Zichuan’s black sword slashed toward Long Chen’s saber. At the same time, black and white light appeared within his manifestation, condensing into two Yin and Yang fish. The two fish revolved around each other.

BOOM!

Long Chen’s full-strength attack struck Lu Zichuan’s black sword. Heaven and earth rumbled, but there was no terrifying qi wave that erupted.

As for Lu Zichuan’s manifestation, it instantly exploded in size, and his white sword slashed through the air. When his white sword swung through the air, all sound vanished. It was like spacetime had been severed by this sword.

A sharp Sword Qi slashed toward Long Chen. This attack was even more terrifying than Long Chen’s seventh form of Split the Heavens.
