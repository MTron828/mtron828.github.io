Chapter 3263 The Bravery of a Dragonblood Warrior

When the patriarch opened his mouth, fifteen disciples walked out from Jiang Baihe’s side. Those disciples all had cold and tough expressions as they looked at Qi Yu.

Last time, they had been ordered to eliminate him. They weren’t even planning on using poison at first, as that would damage their reputation. Although this matter had to be kept secret, they were Primals and didn’t wish to use such methods.

However, Jiang Baihe had ordered them to, as he would not permit any failure. He wanted to secretly eliminate Qi Yu at all costs. That was why he had bought off one of the new disciples under Qi Yu’s lead to poison him.

After poisoning him, all those people were killed. It was an easy cover-up. However, after being poisoned and surrounded, Qi Yu suddenly managed to grab a spirit beast and flee.

Jiang Baihe was infuriated with them for this failure. He was just a little bit off from killing them. But as they were unable to even accomplish such a small matter, they themselves were also angry.

Now that Long Chen had brought Qi Yu back and was challenging them to a one-against-fifteen fight against Qi Yu, they felt that he was sending Qi Yu to his death.

The martial stage was activated and the fifteen of them directly entered.

At this moment, Yu Xuan held Qi Yu’s hand nervously. She didn’t want him to go as she was afraid.

“Don’t worry. Believe in me.”

Qi Yu patted her hand and then walked up to the stage. Qin Feng said, “Brother, boss is here. Bring out the might of the Dragonblood Legion. Whether or not you are in the Dragonblood Legion, you are a Dragonblood warrior.”

Qi Yu suddenly turned back and looked at Long Chen. After he clenched his right fist and struck his chest hard, he smiled confidently.

Qi Yu stepped onto the martial stage. Its divine light covered them in a barrier, isolating them from the rest of the world. Somehow the barrier possessed a heavy aura. It was said that this barrier was something that even Immortal Kings would have difficulty breaking.

Seeing Yu Xuan extremely nervous, Long Chen was quietly happy for Qi Yu. True love endured hardship. Qi Yu could also be said to be blessed.

“Let the competition begin!”

An Elder of the Yuhua Palace announced the start of the battle. The fifteen Primals immediately pounced at Qi Yu, launching their sharpest killing blows.

BOOM!

Fifteen weapons whistled toward Qi Yu, crashing into his sword. However, with a single sword, he blocked all their attacks, and the result was that both sides were sent flying.

That caused startled cries to ring out. Qi Yu’s realm was the lowest of the fighters. But on his own, he had blocked the attacks of fifteen people. How did he do this?

Long Chen nodded after seeing that. Perhaps the position of the most foolish people in the Dragonblood Legion could only belong to himself and Wilde.DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

In just a few days, Qi Yu had started to understand how to use Heavenly Dao energy. 

Long Chen had climbed up the Honing Heavenly Staircase an unknown number of times but had still been too foolish to comprehend this power. If it hadn’t been for Luo Zichuan, he probably wouldn’t have learned how to control Heavenly Dao energy in his entire lifetime.

However, Wilde was truly foolish, while Long Chen was only this foolish because the Heavenly Daos were biased against him, so he hadn’t ever tried to grasp that feeling.

Qi Yu’s technique borrowed the power of heaven and earth, otherwise, there would have been no way for him to block all fifteen of their attacks.

Of all the experts present, only the palace master and the patriarch realized this. The power of heaven and earth was normally something only Divine Lords could start to get a grasp over. Those who could truly control Heavenly Dao energy had to be Immortal Kings.

Qi Yu had only left the Yuhua Palace for a few days but was already starting to control the power of heaven and earth. Hence, even the two of them were shocked.

Although it was only an embryonic form, he had taken this step in advance of all other Four Peak experts. This one step allowed him to stand out within the Four Peak realm.

“Kill!”

Qi Yu suddenly stamped on the air. The void shuddered, and he shot out like a meteor toward the fifteen of them who had yet to stabilize.

The fifteen of them had thought that their combined attack would definitely kill Qi Yu or at the very least leave him seriously wounded. They hadn’t expected to end up in a draw, and they hadn’t discussed how to cooperate any further than that.

BOOM!

Qi Yu arrived in front of one of those experts and slashed at his head. Seeing that he couldn’t dodge and that the people around him couldn’t help, he stabbed his spear toward Qi Yu’s chest.

The sword was shorter than the spear. Although he attacked second, just as Qi Yu’s sword struck his neck, his spear would definitely pierce Qi Yu’s chest. This was a trade, one life for a life, forcing the opponent to change moves if they didn’t want to die.

However, just as he stabbed his spear forward, his expression changed. He was shocked to find that Qi Yu’s sword contained all his power. There was no room for changing techniques. In other words, in order to kill him, Qi Yu no longer wanted his life.

That disciple hastily pulled back his spear to block. He didn’t want to die.

As a result, the hesitation resulted in him pulling back his spear slowly, and Qi Yu cut him in two. Blood then dyed the martial stage.

Startled cries rang out. Qi Yu was truly tough, to the point of craziness. This was entirely relying on risking his life without other techniques. It was a competition of whose guts were bigger.

After killing that disciple, Qi Yu shot off to the left. Two swords cut the back of his robes, and blood soaked his upper back.

At the same time as he dodged, his sword swung through an odd angle. Two more heads soared into the sky.

Using the smallest price, Qi Yu exchanged an injury for two lives. Normally, Four Peak experts could survive for a while even after having their heads cut off, but Qi Yu’s sword contained the power of the Heavenly Daos. At the same time as his sword cut off their heads, it also shattered their souls.

Three disciples were killed in an instant. Qi Yu was like a fiend who killed without batting an eye, an existence that had been released from hell. That chilling killing intent of his shook people’s souls.

The others instantly grew afraid. Even while Qi Yu was injured, they didn’t take advantage of that to attack. Instead, they chose to retreat, waiting for an even better opportunity.

As a result, that became a fatal mistake. As soon as they retreated, their formation scattered. Hence, Qin Feng shook his head and indifferently declared, “It’s over!”

As if cooperating with his words, Qi Yu moved like lightning, hunting down those remaining disciples. With every swing of his sword, he reaped one of their lives.

In just a moment, five more of them fell and only seven remained. Qi Yu was also covered in blood, but his eyes were icy. They didn’t contain the slightest emotion as he continued to kill.

“Junior apprentice-brother Qi Yu, don’t kill me! We had no choice in the matter! It was senior apprentice-brother Baihe who forced us! If you want revenge, kill the person responsible! Let us go-!”

One of those disciples actually knelt on the ground and wept, only to be mercilessly killed by a stroke of Qi Yu’s sword.

“Stop!” Finally, Jiang Baihe was no longer able to continue watching. He furiously roared.
