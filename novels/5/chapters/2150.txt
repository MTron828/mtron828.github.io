Chapter 2140 Drake Against Blood Phoenix

By the time Long Chen rushed over, he saw that millions of Magical Beasts had charged into the drake king’s territory and started a crazy battle.

The drake race and the other Magical Beasts were in an intense battle against them. Everything was chaotic, with more Magical Beasts joining in with each passing moment.

At first, Long Chen thought that it was a rebellion, but he quickly noticed that the Magical Beasts were split into two sides, and up in the sky, the drake king was fighting a giant blood phoenix.

“It’s the beast king from the other region.” Long Chen’s heart shook. The drake king had said that the Wild World was split into eastern and western sides. The drake king controlled the east, while the blood phoenix controlled the west. Unexpectedly, the blood phoenix had led a sneak attack now.

Long Chen examined the blood phoenix. Its blood-colored feathers actually had a flame burning within them. Wild runes whirled around it with every move of its body. Astral winds raged, and its sharp claws tore through the void. It was fighting evenly against the drake king.

“Boss, not good! One of our mines has been destroyed by the invading Magical Beasts! There are thousands of casualties amongst the original devil race’s disciples!” One of the Dragonblood warriors rushed over to him with a report.

The target of these Magical Beasts was the drake king. They had simply coincidentally passed by one of their mines and destroyed it in passing.

Although Wilde and his defense squad had rushed over immediately, there was no way for them to stop this army. They had only been able to save a portion of the people working inside the mine.

In his fury, Wilde stayed in the mine region and started fighting some of those Magical Beasts. The other Dragonblood warriors guarded the original devil race’s disciples as they retreated, and they sent one person over to report this to Long Chen.

“A bunch of uncivilized animals don’t know what respect is. Then let’s start a slaughter. Tell Wilde and the others to come over here once the original devil race’s disciples have all been evacuated. We’ll help the drake race eliminate them.” Killing intent blazed within Long Chen’s eyes. In the end, there were always unexpected changes to plans.

“Yes!” That warrior immediately left.

Long Chen stepped through the air, charging straight through the battlefield. Masking his aura, he went toward one of the large blood phoenixes.

That blood phoenix was currently fighting the drake king’s mate. The blood phoenix raked the drake’s back, ripping out a chunk of scales, but at the same time, it was struck by the drake’s tail, causing feathers to blow away in a wild whirl.

Clearly, the drake and blood phoenix races had been fighting for many years and were familiar with each other’s fighting styles. As soon as the battle started, it became bloody.

“Die!” Suddenly, Evilmoon came slashing for the blood phoenix’s neck from behind.

The phoenix’s head went flying, and blood filled the air. Just now, all its attention had been focused on its opponent, and in truth, although it had also injured the drake, the tail strike had broken its protective divine light and shaken its insides. That was a more serious injury, and Long Chen had grasped that timing perfectly, striking it during its weakest state.

The head flying through the air was struck by a wave of dragon breath from the drake, which killed it in body and soul.

Long Chen flicked a drop of blood at the drake, feeding it a drop of his essence blood.

“You be the main attack, and I’ll be the support,” transmitted Long Chen spiritually. That drop of blood had contained his spiritual seal as it was much more convenient to speak spiritually.

The drake roared and charged after another blood phoenix. With it going all-out and Long Chen launching sneak attacks at the right moment, another blood phoenix was slain.

The drake king’s mate was second only to the drake king, and it also possessed a certain level of intelligence. The two of them were able to work together well.

They picked out the strongest opposing Magical Beasts as their targets. The drake would force a scenario where both sides were injured, and Long Chen would take that chance to launch a killing blow.

They had no choice but to kill as many enemies as they could. Due to the battle with the winged devils, the drake race’s side had taken many losses, and this sudden attack from the blood phoenix race put them at an immense disadvantage.

The drake king and the king of the blood phoenixes were busy with each other and couldn’t interfere with the others. Due to the vast power discrepancy between the two sides, the drake king’s Magical Beasts were being slaughtered rapidly. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

Long Chen and the drake king’s mate ended up drawing quite a bit of attention. As a result, three of the blood phoenixes charged over.

One of them opened its mouth, unleashing a ray of light. A warning came from the drake, telling Long Chen that this was one of their strongest moves. Even the drake race didn’t like to receive this move head-on.

BOOM!

However, before the attack could be unleashed, the condensing power exploded, blowing apart the blood phoenix’s head. Its corpse fell to the ground.

“Who gave you the courage to open your mouth in front of me, Guo Ran?”

At this moment, Guo Ran appeared in the sky, holding a new blood-colored crossbow. He was looking disdainfully at the dead blood phoenix.

“Phoenix Blood Immortal Gold. He actually used such material to create a divine crossbow.” Long Chen instantly recognized the material.

Suddenly, Guo Ran’s crossbow blazed with runes. Long Chen barely sensed something fly out before he saw another late twelfth rank Magical Beast get killed. Its skull was as weak as paper in front of Guo Ran’s arrow. Even Long Chen was shocked.

Another arrow flew, and the second blood phoenix that was about to reach Long Chen was slain by Guo Ran’s arrow. This time, Long Chen managed to see the arrow. It also looked to be made of Phoenix Blood Immortal Gold, but it was too fast for him to see it clearly.

“Guo Ran, nice job! Keep going. Eliminate all the powerful Magical Beasts on the other side!” called out Long Chen. With Guo Ran’s killing tool present, this battle would become much easier. These Magical Beasts weren’t very intelligent and were just moving targets to Guo Ran.

“Thank you for your praise, boss! But I’m sorry to disappoint you. These demon slaying, evil warding, heaven shaking arrows... I only have three.” Guo Ran scratched his head with embarrassment.

“In the future, can you show off all the way instead of stopping midway?” Long Chen cursed. Seeing Guo Ran’s insufferably arrogant arrival, he had thought that Guo Ran would be able to turn the tables on his own. But it was just a show that lasted only for a moment.

“There wasn’t enough time! I had too much to do. There wasn’t time to make any more,” said Guo Ran helplessly.

All this time, he had been focused on the Dragonblood warriors’ weapons and armor. He barely had time just to create these three arrows.

Just as Long Chen was about to respond, the third blood phoenix reached him. As its claw reached toward him, it was whipped away by the drake.

BOOM!

Guo Ran unleashed another arrow, this one being golden. It struck that blood phoenix’s eye, causing it to explode. The blood phoenix let out a mournful cry.

“You think without my heaven shaking arrows, you can ignore me?” demanded Guo Ran. His current crossbow had been upgraded. It was just that he was still using his old arrows. Although they could be used, they weren’t as powerful as his new arrows.

However, if shot in the eye, there was no way a Magical Beast could endure it. As that blood phoenix writhed in pain, its head was cut off by Long Chen.

“Guo Ran, watch out!” shouted Long Chen suddenly. He saw two Magical Beasts charging toward Guo Ran.

“Damnit, time to run.” Guo Ran hastily fled. He didn’t dare to directly face these terrifying twelfth rank Magical Beasts. He hadn’t finished his new armor, and his old armor would be destroyed in one attack.

Just as Guo Ran was about to flee, a giant bone club whistled down, sending one of those Magical Beasts flying. Wilde had arrived.

Wilde’s arrival signified that the original devil race’s disciples in the mine had been evacuated.

Guo Ran was delighted and shouted, “Brother, well done! Let’s work together!”

Guo Ran jumped onto Wilde’s shoulder. Wilde had already transformed into a giant, and his power was limitless. He was able to directly face peak twelfth rank Magical Beasts. Being the support, Guo Ran shot arrows at the eyes, nose, mouths, and throats of the opposing Magical Beasts. Although he might not be able to slay them, he was able to affect them long enough for Wilde’s bone club to kill them.

The Dragonblood warriors had arrived. Forming into groups of dozens of people, they began to pick out their own targets. Their cooperation was seamless, and the targets they picked for themselves were killed one by one.

The drake race’s side was originally at an immense disadvantage, but with Long Chen and the Dragonblood Legion’s arrival, they quickly evened things out and gradually began to gain an advantage.

Long Chen worked with the drake king’s mate, killing over ten powerful Magical Beasts. By this point, the drake king’s mate was covered in wounds.

There was no way around it. It was picking out the strongest Magical Beasts for its targets. To give Long Chen the best chance, every move was practically a suicidal move designed to cause a lot of damage to its opponent at once.

“That’s about enough. You can rest.”

Seeing that the tide had been reversed, Long Chen flew off on his own. More Magical Beasts had arrived from the drake king’s side, and the other side’s defeat was essentially set in stone.

“Wilde, Guo Ran, let’s kill that big fellow!” shouted Long Chen, stepping into the battle between the drake king and the blood phoenix king.
