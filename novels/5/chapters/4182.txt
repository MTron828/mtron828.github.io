Chapter 4171: Don’t Need to Give Face

The palace master appeared to be in his thirties, possessing a physique akin to an iron tower and a tanned complexion. Primal chaos runes seemed to swirl within his eyes.

However, not one bit of his aura leaked out, so it was impossible to gauge his power based on his aura alone.

It was only thanks to the Nine Star Hegemon Body Art that Long Chen was able to sense the palace master’s hidden power beneath his calm exterior.

This feeling was something Long Chen had only sensed from Xu Jianxiong’s body. Most unexpected of all was that the palace master actually possessed the powerful aura of the dragon race.

Long Chen, owing to his own dragon bloodline, had incredibly acute senses in this regard. He couldn't be mistaken, which was precisely why he found this revelation so astonishing.

“Brat, what are you staring at? Shouldn’t you greet the palace master?” said Bai Zhantang irritably upon seeing Long Chen with Bai Shishi.

In his heart, his daughter was like a heavenly fairy, while Long Chen was a glib-tongued, flippant brat who was not a suitable match for his daughter.

Just now, Bai Shishi had pulled Long Chen down, but Long Chen was too shocked by the palace master’s status, so his movements were too stiff. As a result, Bai Zhantang couldn’t help chiding him.

“No need.”

The palace master waved his hand, also staring at Long Chen with a look of surprise in his eyes. After staring at Long Chen for a moment, he nodded, seemingly pleased.

After that, the palace master turned and left without saying another word. Seeing this scene, Bai Shishi couldn’t help but feel a bit uneasy, wondering whether Long Chen's lack of politeness had offended the palace master and led to his abrupt departure.

“Dean Long Chen, with Dean Bai’s departure, everything here has been left for you to manage. Also, the palace master isn't one to indulge in words; speaking isn't his forte. We trust you possess greater expertise in this area. But if moving mouth alone isn’t enough and you need to move fists, the palace master will happily help you,” said the expert standing beside Bai Zhantang.

For him to stand beside Bai Zhantang meant that he had a similar status. In other words, both of them were vice palace masters of the Battle God Palace.

This time, Long Chen could discern that Bai Zhantang was actually a Heaven Venerate. While he maintained the appearance of an Immortal King on the surface, he couldn't mask this fact from Long Chen's senses.

However, Long Chen also sensed something odd about his auras. It felt like his body had a seal in it, intentionally suppressing his cultivation base and hiding his aura.

Long Chen wouldn't have been able to discern Bai Zhantang's actual cultivation level had he not cultivated the Nine Star Hegemon Body Art. The High Firmament Academy had indeed concealed their power deeply.

What perplexed Long Chen the most was that in the Darklight Heaven, he had witnessed Bai Zhantang engage in numerous battles where they had been pushed to the brink. So why had he not released the seal on his cultivation base during those critical moments?

Long Chen refused to believe that Bai Zhantang had somehow advanced this far ever since Long Chen’s departure from the High Firmament Academy.

Furthermore, Bai Zhantang’s aura was different from an ordinary Heaven Venerate’s. It seemed to be a mix of an acquired and innate Heaven Venerate’s aura.

This discovery showed Long Chen that the name of the oldest academy in the nine heavens and ten lands was not mere embellishment. They had indeed concealed their true capabilities with great finesse.

Thinking back, the fact that these powers targeted the High Firmament Academy was truly laughable. It was like ants trying to devour a slumbering dragon.

“The dean has entrusted this place to me. I definitely won’t disappoint the dean or the palace master.” Long Chen cupped his fists.

Since things had progressed to this point, there was no point in objecting. With the High Firmament Academy’s profound foundation, they didn’t need to worry about him messing around, then he wouldn’t stand on courtesy.

Furthermore, Long Chen vaguely felt that the reason Bai Letian had him take charge must be because he had his own plans. Perhaps he was hoping for Long Chen to cause some trouble.

“Then we’ll trouble Dean Long Chen. I’ll take my leave first and not intrude on your family reunion.” That person laughed and patted Bai Zhantang’s shoulder before leaving.

Now it was just Bai Zhantang, Bai Shishi, and Long Chen. Long Chen looked at his father-in-law’s dark expression and instantly felt embarrassed. It seemed that this father-in-law of his had never had a good opinion of him.

“Palace master, do you have any instructions for me?” Seeing him not speaking, Long Chen could only take the initiative. This way, if Bai Zhantang didn’t have anything to say, he could leave. Wouldn’t he feel embarrassed sticking around when his fellow vice palace master had left?

“Hmph.”

Bai Zhantang opened his mouth several times, but he didn’t know what to say. In the end, he just snorted and left.

Long Chen shrugged to Bai Shishi helplessly, saying that he had been courteous and her father was the one who didn’t like him.

Bai Shishi simply smiled and brushed it off. In any case, she didn’t really talk to her father much anyway.

“Boss!”

Just then, Bai Xiaole came running over, crying out excitedly.

It wasn’t just Bai Xiaole. Qin Feng, Qi Yu, Mu Qingyun, Luo Bing, Luo Ning, Zhong Ling, Zhong Xiu, and many other familiar faces appeared.

They were all incomparably excited, especially Zhong Ling and Zhong Xiu. Having not taken part in the three thousand worlds, they hadn't seen Long Chen since he left the High Firmament Academy.

Long Chen had changed all of their lives, so they were grateful to him. After he left, they felt like they had lost a pillar that held them up.

Fortunately, Bai Shishi and Bai Xiaole had entered the three thousand worlds and brought back news of him, gratifying them all. Still, now that they saw him again, they couldn’t contain their excitement.

“Big brother Long Chen, we missed you!” Zhong Ling ran over to Long Chen and wept.

Long Chen had always viewed them as his little sisters. Seeing her weeping, his heart ached and he wiped away her tears while joking with her, trying to make her happy.

Once their emotions settled a bit, Long Chen asked Luo Bing and Luo Ning, “How is the Luo family doing lately?”

“The Luo family has disappeared.” Upon hearing his question, Luo Ning and Luo Bing’s eyes reddened.

“Disappeared? How can that be? When did this happen?” asked Long Chen hastily.

“It happened right after the three thousand worlds ended. When we returned to the Luo family, all that remained was a giant hole. It was like someone had just dug it out. Other than us in the academy, we are unable to get in contact with anyone else. We don’t know if… if…” Even the always staunch Luo Bing couldn’t help tearing up.

“After the three thousand worlds?”

Long Chen instantly thought of his grandfather. They had undone the seal back then. Was it his grandfather’s doing?

“Don’t worry, I think I know what happened. I’ll tell you later. They should all be safe,” comforted Long Chen.

Luo Bing and Luo Ning were overjoyed to hear that. This matter had been a constant heavy weight on their hearts, but Long Chen actually knew the cause of this matter. In an instant, they felt relieved of a heavy burden. It really was good having Long Chen present.

Just as everyone was talking, they heard a ruckus coming from the distance. Bai Xiaole couldn’t help furiously saying, “These people have gone too far! They’ve actually entered the core of our academy’s land. We already told them that we weren't even qualified to go there. How dare they!”

The ruckus grew louder and they even heard people starting to curse. Upon hearing this, Long Chen’s expression sank.

“Let’s go. We’ll teach them a lesson. When I give you the signal, beat them to death. There’s no need to give them any face.”
