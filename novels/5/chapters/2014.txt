It had to be known that ninety percent of the experts here were part of the human race. For someone to openly curse the human race like this, they were enraged. If this wasn’t the wrong place for it, they would have killed that idiot.

However, of all the experts here, not all of them were afraid of the ancient races and the Xuan Beasts. Someone responded, “For people like you, the only thing to do is bully you like Long Chen does. Once Long Chen beats all your teeth out, you won’t insult the human race every time you open your mouth.”

This person came from a neutral sect. Originally, he had no enmity with the Xuan Beasts or the ancient races. However, this person’s mouth was just too hateful. To suck up to the Xuan Beasts, did you need to trample on the human race? Did he not realize that the human race was his ancestor?

“Yes, they’re truly low-key! Once Long Chen even killed his way into their headquarters and took all their resources, they didn’t make a sound! So low-key!” added someone else. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“You...” That ancient race expert was about to curse back when he suddenly noticed that he was surrounded by experts of the human race. He swallowed his curses.

Seeing that he didn’t dare to continue talking, those experts couldn’t be bothered with him. They turned back to watch the fight.

At this time, Long Chen had come out of his carriage. He walked toward that expert of the Xuan Beasts.

“Now there will be a good show to watch. One’s Man Batian, one’s Xiong Tianba. Let’s see who’s stronger,” said someone excitedly.

Man Batian came from a neutral sect that had been in hiding. He had no relationship with anyone, and he was known as a tyrannical figure. There were already a few stories of his infamy. As for Xiong Tianba, he came from the Xuan Beasts who always looked down on the human race. If the two of them clashed, it would be a perfect case of irritating fellows fighting each other. The others were quite happy to watch such a show.

“You killed my mount. It seems I’ll need you to replace it.” Long Chen suddenly shot forward, smashing his rod at Xiong Tianba.

“Man Batian, you might be able to be arrogant in front of others, but you aren’t qualified to act like that in front of the Xuan Beasts!” Xiong Tianba roared and his rod also smashed toward Long Chen.

When those two rods collided, a heaven-shaking explosion erupted and divine light burst forward. The large Xiong Tianba was actually blown into the distance.

“Heavens, in terms of power, Man Batian is actually greater than Xiong Tianba!”

Long Chen sneered, “A little bear also dares to act this wild? In the future, just obediently pull my carriage.”

Long Chen’s current power and fighting style were identical to Man Batian’s. That was the only way to avoid other people’s suspicions.

This imitation was quite simple for Long Chen. Man Batian’s energy stemmed from the barbarian dragon, and he didn’t have any flashy techniques. Long Chen also liked that kind of fighting style that relied on overwhelming his opponents with power.

As soon as they clashed, he knew that in terms of power, Xiong Tianba was a far cry from Man Batian.

Man Batian was truly powerful. He definitely wasn’t stronger than True Immortal Jiaoqi, but he would only be the slightest bit weaker. The reason why Long Chen had crushed him so easily was because his azure dragon blood suppressed his barbarian dragon power.

“Power of the earth, Bear King Slaughters the Heavens!”

Xiong Tianba’s feet touched the ground, and his black fur suddenly became the color of the earth. His aura also completely transformed.

“How can a bear slaughter the heavens?” sneered Long Chen, smashing out his rod.

BOOM!

However, this time, the earth didn’t explode. Instead, it was like all the surrounding land had become one entity, resisting his strike.

Long Chen was slightly surprised. This Xiong Tianba actually had some ability.

Xiong Tianba was extracting the energy of the earth. His manifestation appeared behind him, and endless mountains appeared within it. They were crystal-clear.

“This is...”

“He’s fully awakened his manifestation?!”

BOOM!

Long Chen and Xiong Tianba were forced back by each other’s power.

“Man Batian, do you see? My manifestation has already fully awakened. Even in terms of comprehension, my Xuan Beasts are superior to your human race! I’ll let you experience the power of a fully awakened manifestation today!” Xiong Tianba laughed wildly. The mountains within his manifestation began to shudder. This was no longer just an image, but it was its own world.

“So that’s the case. No wonder you can only fully awaken your manifestation upon reaching the Life Star realm,” muttered Long Chen to himself as he looked at Xiong Tianba’s manifestation.

The world within the manifestation was illusionary. But when a Life Star expert condensed their astral space, it would become the foundation for the manifestation and could transform the manifestation from illusory to real.

The manifestation behind Xiong Tianba was a reflection of the world within his astral space. That was why it looked so real.

He was fully in control of his world energy because his manifestation was his world. With a fully awakened manifestation, he was a true Empyrean.

The mountains within his manifestation rumbled. Divine runes began to appear on the ground, sending energy toward Xiong Tianba.

“He’s using the power of his manifestation to gather the energy of the very Martial Heaven Continent. How can anyone fight him when he controls that much power?” exclaimed one of the ancient family alliance’s experts.

“Who would have thought that the first person on the continent to awaken their manifestation would actually be from the Xuan Beasts? They’ll probably brag about this for a lifetime,” sighed one of the neutral camp’s experts.

Both the ancient races and the Xuan Beasts despised the human race, and they would directly scoff at the weaker ones, explicitly saying the human race was garbage.

Now that Xiong Tianba had actually awakened his manifestation, they would never forget about this. This would be another thing they would hold over the human race.

“Is awakening a manifestation really so amazing? Everyone, look well. If I even have to use my manifestation, it will count as my loss,” sneered Long Chen. His rod suddenly rumbled as he activated his azure dragon blood.

A dragon cry resounded through the air. He was activating this divine item with the power of the azure dragon, and the power it unleashed was greater than what Xiong Batian could hope to unleash.

BOOM!

The ground exploded. The mighty and arrogant Xiong Tianba was sent tumbling back.

“Do you think the power of the barbarian dragon is something a little bear can block? Taking out my manifestation would be bullying you. Just obediently pull my carriage.”

A wave of dust swirled around Long Chen. Although he hadn’t summoned the Azure Dragon Battle Armor, he was already using the power of his dragon blood. He began unleashing a torrent of attacks at Xiong Tianba.

With each clash, Xiong Tianba was sent tumbling back. The ground shook with each step, and the earth exploded with each of Long Chen’s attacks.

“What’s going on? Was Man Batian always so powerful? Even someone with a fully awakened manifestation can’t stop him?”

“Something seems off. If Xiong Tianba fully awakened his manifestation, why wouldn’t the Xuan Beasts announce it?”

“That’s right, that’s not their style!”

“I understand! Look closely at his manifestation. He didn’t awaken it naturally. He must have used some outside power to forcibly awaken it. Look, there’s no air of life within it!”

A manifestation was like a painting, but once it was awakened, it had its own life. Xiong Tianba’s manifestation looked alive, but it lacked an actual air of life. It was stiff.

“There’s no blessing of the Heavenly Daos either. So he only managed to awaken it with some outside force. No wonder it didn’t increase his power that much.”

“What a greedy fellow. This Xiong Tianba was a genius who could stand at the peak, but due to his impatience, he’s ruined his future. He’ll only be half an Empyrean for the rest of his life. There’s no way for him to fix his manifestation. Once everyone else’s manifestations begin to awaken, he’ll be trash. Stupid.”

Xiong Tianba roared and suddenly transformed into a giant bear. Wielding his rod with both hands, his fur began to shine. The runes that had been spreading on the ground were suddenly all sucked up by him. He smashed his rod at Long Chen.

“He’s gone berserk! He directly summoned his true body!”

Startled cries rang out. After being suppressed time and time again, Xiong Tianba was actually staking everything on one attack.
