Chapter 3850 Long Chen’s Undefeatable Dao

Long Chen’s fists shattered heaven and earth. One punch after another struck Long Aotian.

However, Long Aotian simply sneered and waved his hand. Although Long Chen was repeatedly forcing him back, constantly blasting him away like he was a sandbag, he still didn’t suffer any injuries.

“What is going on?”

Xia Chen and the others were all dumbfounded. Did Long Aotian possess an undying body? Anyone else would have long since been blown apart by a single punch from Long Chen. However, no matter how Long Aotian was struck, he remained fine. Everyone was bewildered.

“You really are stubborn. He is using your seven-color Supreme Blood. Even if you beat him, you’re only beating yourself. Are you going to get competitive even with yourself?” The dragon expert couldn’t help being a bit vexed upon seeing Long Chen crazily unleashing attack after attack despite knowing that his attacks were meaningless.

“Senior, you don’t understand. Ever since I was born, my life has been full of trouble and misfortune. Although what I’ve experienced is just a fraction of a fraction of what you’ve gone through, I can see my path clearly. I know what I must face, and this path of pitfalls and holes must be traversed directly. I know my strongest point is not my talent, intelligence, or any treasures I have. The reason I could walk through this blood-stained path of mine until today is entirely because of my unyielding spirit. I cannot lose to anyone, not even myself. I have to maintain that sharpness. In all these years, no matter what dangers I faced, I did not shrink back or hesitate. I faced them head-on with utmost confidence that I would pass through another bloody battle that pushed me to the brink. Thus, no matter what kind of opponent I’m against, as long as it is someone in the same realm, I cannot be defeated. That is my path, that is my Dao. No one can block my path, not even myself,” responded Long Chen as he continued to fight.

Hearing that, the dragon expert was silent for a long time before slowly saying, “What you’re saying is also logical. Fine, since you have that confidence, do as you please.”

Long Chen and Long Aotian’s fight, or perhaps it should be said Long Chen’s violent beating of Long Aotian that caused no injuries to Long Aotian, left everyone stunned. Even Yin Changsheng and the others, true experts that had experienced countless battles, were unable to see what was going on.

“Long Chen, even if you use up all your energy, how long can you last? Once your aura starts to drop, how will you fight me? Hahaha, are you angry? Resentful? I will make you experience having fate toy with you, leaving you helpless, hahaha!” Long Aotian laughed arrogantly even as he was beaten.

Just as he laughed, another slap struck his face, sending him flying.

This time, Long Chen didn’t pursue him. He only stood in the air and coldly looked at him. “Other than the power of the five elements, you also have the energy of light and dark. The dark energy is devouring power, and the light energy is healing power. Your dark energy absorbs a portion of my energy, so you only end up enduring fifty percent of my attacks’ power. Even then, fifty percent is enough to injure you, just not too badly. In order to show how strong you are, you act fine even after being injured, making you seem undefeatable, creating the illusion that my attacks have no effect. In truth, you are simply using your light energy to heal as well. Hmph, in this world, there exists no perfect technique. Long Aotian, you are still the old you, always playing with shameful tricks.”

Long Aotian was enraged at this slap. He didn’t fear Long Chen’s punches or kicks, but a face-slap was a humiliating attack that no one could accept.

However, after this speech from Long Chen, Long Aotian was startled. Long Chen had actually seen through his technique.

The black and white in his manifestation was just as Long Chen said. One devoured and the other healed.

However, Long Aotian had not fully awakened his seven-color Supreme Blood. His dark and light energy was unable to be summoned outside of his manifestation like with the power of the five elements.

Despite that, they still gave him immense power. When most people attacked him, the dark energy directly devoured all of the damage.

But then, Long Chen’s energy was too powerful and concentrated to be devoured whole, so Long Aotian’s previously unmatched dark energy could only absorb half of it. As for the remaining half, he had to rely on the power of the five elements and his body to block it.

The power of the five elements also blocked a portion of Long Chen’s power. As a result, only around forty percent of it ended up striking Long Aotian.

Of course, even forty percent was enough to blow up a group of average Supreme experts. On the surface, Long Aotian acted unmoved. But in truth, his body was repeatedly injured.

It was simply that his light energy possessed powerful restorative abilities. His injuries were silently healed. Thus, it appeared to everyone that Long Chen’s attacks were ineffective.

“So what? Other than having the power of the five elements, I also have devouring power and healing power. Your attacks are weakened and unable to harm me. Even if you do injure me, those injuries are instantly healed. As for yourself? Every bit of energy that you use up is gone. Once your aura drops, your fate will be set,” sneered Long Aotian.Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

It was only after hearing them talk that Yin Changsheng and the others understood the mysteries behind this strange phenomenon. However, they were still completely shocked by Long Aotian’s seven-color Supreme Blood.

Yin Changsheng and the others were also Supreme experts, and their Supreme Blood also had special qualities. Those powerful abilities made them incredibly arrogant.

However, compared to Long Aotian’s seven-color Supreme Blood, their Supreme Blood seemed completely ordinary. They had never heard of a Supreme Blood that possessed the powers of metal, wood, water, fire, earth, dark, and light.

Clearly, Long Aotian wasn’t planning on bringing out anything else. Just by relying on this scoundrel technique, he wanted to forcibly exhaust Long Chen to death.

“It’s too bad that your dark and light energy isn’t strong enough. You can’t summon it outside of your body, so you need to rely on your manifestation to use it. Otherwise, if you could do that, it really would be a bit troublesome to break this move of yours,” said Long Chen lightly.

“My seven-color Supreme Blood still hasn’t reached perfection. Only the power of the five elements can be summoned outside of my body. Despite that, it’s enough to deal with you,” said Long Aotian confidently.

“Is that so? Then try and receive this attack.”

When Long Chen formed hand seals, space quivered and the sky darkened. A starry sky then covered the world.

“Astral summoning!”

Long Chen unleashed a single fist. Seven stars flowed on top of it, with nine hundred and ninety-nine stars appearing around this ring of seven stars.

This time, up in the sea of stars above the sky, nine hundred and ninety-nine stars suddenly lit up.

BOOM!

Long Chen’s fist smashed into Long Aotian. As a result, Long Aotian’s arms were both broken, and Long Chen’s fist struck his chest. People also saw Long Chen’s fist almost go through his back.

Long Aotian hacked up blood and bent like a shrimp, flying back.
