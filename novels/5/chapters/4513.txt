Chapter 4502 Immortal Ancient Battlefield

“Sweeping elder, I’m going as well!”

Within the academy, the black-robed palace master bowed to the sweeping elder.

The sweeping elder was solemn. “The path to the ninth heaven has opened, coinciding with the immortal ancient battlefield. Individuals like yourself, who missed the prime of this era but are catching the tail end of it, will be rushing in. Countless dangers await inside, with an overwhelming number of individuals more talented and formidable than you. Are you sure you want to take this risk?”

“That is why I’ve come to say goodbye. This parting might be forever, and perhaps this little one will never be able to repay your kindness. Please forgive me,” expressed the palace master.

The palace master appeared resolute in his decision to depart, prepared for the possibility of never returning. Despite this, his countenance remained calm. He had long surpassed the point of being concerned about life and death.

The palace master was an upright figure who disliked owing anyone anything. The only one whom he had never managed to repay was the sweeping elder, who had saved his life in the past.

The path to the ninth heaven was the opportunity for Long Chen’s generation, one in which the palace master wasn’t entitled to partake. However, the palace master had his own opportunity.

After all, the opening of the ninth heaven had caused a chaotic spacetime current to appear, creating a crack in the seal of the immortal ancient battlefield, a place without the restriction of cultivation base, so anyone could go in.

However, the spatial crack possessed enough power to crush ordinary Saints, so even someone like the palace master couldn’t guarantee that he could pass through it safely.

Even if he could pass through the crack, he didn’t know what kind of terrifying existences waited for him inside. Thus, the palace master was prepared for the worst-case scenario.

As a cultivator, he had stepped onto the path of no return. It didn’t matter whether it was a mountain of blades or a sea of fire inside; he could only advance, not retreat.

He could accept dying on the battlefield, but the thought of his cultivation base stagnating for the rest of his life was unbearable for him. What was more frightening than death was mediocrity, especially for a prideful expert like the palace master.

The sweeping elder nodded. “Since you have made your decision, go. Once you enter, you might encounter people related to Long Chen. Look after them.”

“People related to Long Chen?” The palace master was startled. Weren’t the only people related to Long Chen in the same generation as him? Why would they go to the ancient battlefield?

“Amongst them will be two twin sisters. They will definitely go to the immortal ancient battlefield because their ancestors died on that battlefield. They are part of the god race of the Netherworld that conceals an unknown secret. The black lotus has appeared, and the six Daos are resonating. Their sealed memories should have awakened. After awakening those memories, they will definitely search for traces of their inheritance in the immortal ancient battlefield,” replied the sweeping elder. His turbid eyes looked into the distance, as if seeing through spacetime. It was as if he could see the future.

“The Netherworld’s god race? Are they related to Long Chen?” asked the palace master.

“Not to Long Chen but to his inheritance. The scope of their relationship is grand. Sometimes, things that look completely unrelated are actually connected in ways that you will have never imagined. In this world, there are not that many coincidences,” said the sweeping elder.

The palace master nodded. He then bowed once more to the sweeping elder and left.

Once the palace master was gone, the sweeping elder’s gaze turned back to the vortex in the sky. The specks in his turbid eyes spun like stars in the cosmos, gradually forming a vortex identical to the one in the sky.

After a long time, the sweeping elder smiled. “The Grand Dao is in chaos. The fate of the heavens is shrouded. Unfathomable, inestimable! No guide to the laws, no order to the heavens! You wish to cover the heavens? Unfortunately, some people do not listen to the heavens!”

Within the vortex in his eyes, Long Chen’s figure appeared. He was leading the Dragonblood Legion and the academy’s disciples toward the vortex with no hesitation.

“Boss, this time, our Dragonblood Legion should be able to fully gather!” Guo Ran looked at the enormous vortex without the slightest fear. He was full of anticipation.

Hearing that, everyone, including Long Chen, had their blood heat up. Although over five thousand Dragonblood warriors had gathered, he still hadn’t encountered the rest.

Long Chen originally assumed that those people had met a grisly end upon entering the immortal world. Given their circumstances, that was understandable. However, back in the Vermilion Bird Empire, Long Chen had heard someone mention the wood element healing warriors of the Dragonblood Legion.

Even now, they hadn’t appeared, which made Long Chen extremely curious. His anticipation grew as he hoped to discover more Dragonblood warriors. Perhaps their delayed gathering signaled that the opportune moment had not yet arrived.

With the gate to the ninth heaven now open, elite individuals from all corners of the world, regardless of the era, were bound to emerge. The Dragonblood Legion would definitely find more of its people.

Yet, intertwined with this anticipation was an underlying nervousness. If, even now, the Dragonblood Legion failed to assemble entirely, it suggested that some of them might never return.

The competition within the immortal world was fierce, with unforeseen events unfolding at every turn. Every Dragonblood warrior had brushed by death countless times, so they were aware of just how dangerous it was.

Contrary to the idyllic image of a realm filled with gods and immortals, the immortal world proved to be bloodier than the mortal realm. No one could guarantee that they could survive to see the next day’s sunrise.

Thus, the Dragonblood warriors were hopeful but also nervous. With mixed emotions, they continued on.

At this time, they saw countless people around them, all gathering toward the spatial vortex.

The various sects and worlds had sent all their experts, looking like rivers flowing into the sky. It was a spectacular sight.Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

At this moment, everyone finally saw just how many terrifying experts had been hiding in this world. Heavenly Doyens that could be considered peerless existences during normal times were now as numerous as grains of sand.

The number of Triple Supremes was greater than the stars in the sky, and even individuals who couldn’t be classified as Supremes were joining the fray.

They all embraced the prospect of death, unable to accept a life devoid of significance. With this opportune moment at hand, their once-cherished lives seemed less valuable, and even in the face of certain death, they chose to take the gamble.

Just as Long Chen was leading everyone forward, he suddenly felt a sense of danger and turned back toward a mass of rising devil qi. A group of the devil race’s experts were rushing toward them.

Just as he noticed them, he also sensed several other experts appear from other directions. They had actually surrounded Long Chen and the others.

“Are you the human race’s Sage King? Your life ends here!” a sinister voice echoed, accompanied by the eruption of Doyen power. Bai Shishi and the others’ expressions shifted, as they sensed that the speaker’s aura rivaled that of the terrifying Lifehunter expert.

“Die!”

A blood-colored spear tore through the world, heading straight toward Long Chen.
