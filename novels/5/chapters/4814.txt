Chapter 4803 Heart-Devil Finally Appears

When Long Chen entered a meditative state, Heavenly Dao runes swirled around him, and as he gradually opened his energy barriers, the Heavenly Dao energy slowly entered him.

This energy soaked into him, merging with his own power, and he was merging with the Heavenly Daos.

Yes, this was not a one-sided merger. As Long Chen got accustomed to the laws of the Heavenly Daos, the laws of the Heavenly Daos were also accepting him.

However, Long Chen’s guard was up as he didn’t know how the laws of the Sovereign Emperor Heaven would treat him. Would they also be biased against him and target him? If so, something bad might be happening around now.

What Long Chen was worried about the most was if the Heavenly Daos targeted him at the same time as his heart-devil, that would be the worst-case scenario.

Long Chen tried to communicate with the Earth Cauldron, but it continued to ignore him. A bad feeling crept onto him.

The Earth Cauldron had accepted him as master. For him to not be able to summon it, it showed that there was something it could not speak of.

Long Chen had never doubted the Earth Cauldron. If it wasn’t saying anything, it had to have its reasons. Long Chen believed that it wouldn’t harm him.

For it to not answer was essentially a silent warning. He had to be on guard.

Fluctuations spread from Long Chen, but there were also fluctuations moving into him. The laws of the Heavenly Daos were being drawn into him.

These laws were different from the laws of other worlds. Compared to the Sovereign Emperor Heaven, the other heavens’ laws were incredibly incomplete.

Thus, the cultivators from outside the Sovereign Emperor Heaven did not have the recognition of the laws of this world, resulting in them being unable to use magical arts and divine abilities. They were still incapable of using the power of heaven and earth.

It was because the majority of cultivators relied on gathering the power of heaven and earth to unleash their powerful techniques. After all, a person’s power was limited, but the power of the Heavenly Daos was limitless. A powerful magical art could be a hundred times stronger than their own power.

Hence, once they were unable to mobilize the power of the Heavenly Daos, ninety-nine percent of cultivators felt like they had been stripped of their cultivation bases. They were filled with fear.

Being able to commune with the Heavenly Daos was of utmost importance to the newcomers. Without this, they wouldn’t have any chance of beating the natives.

As time passed, the laws of the Heavenly Daos grew more active around Long Chen. Countless Heavenly Dao runes were flying around him.

Not that far away, Bai Zhantang and the four protector Elders were watching him. Seeing those runes, the Divine Lightning Elder couldn’t help but say, “Dean Long Chen really is a supreme genius. He has just started but has already caused such a large disturbance.”

They had also gone through this process, so they knew that the start was the gentlest. Normally, there wouldn’t be anything visible during this time. It was only once the energy in them started to reject the power of the Heavenly Daos that the Heavenly Dao fluctuations around them grew more intense.

This rejection was not one of fire and water but a clash between receiving and giving. After all, the laws of the Heavenly Daos had their own will. What they granted, one couldn’t refuse; what they withheld, one couldn’t seize forcibly.

For example, a wood element cultivator would not require any other energies during this process. They had to abandon those energies to avoid absorbing impurities that affected their core energy.

However, when the wood element energy of the Heavenly Daos appeared, they had to absorb it fiercely. As a result, there was a kind of fight and rejection. This was something that every cultivator had to deal with.

For the Heavenly Dao fluctuations to be so intense at the start, it showed that the amount of energy contained within Long Chen was too enormous, to the point that even Heaven Saints were shocked.

“It probably isn’t a good thing,” wondered the High Heaven Elder.

“If it was a good thing, Long Chen wouldn’t have asked us to guard him. The four of you should guard the surroundings. I will stay at the center. We have to be on guard against our enemies and be ready to save Long Chen at any time,” said Bai Letian.

The four of them nodded, and with a flash, they all vanished.

At this moment, the space around Long Chen started to collapse as countless Heavenly Dao runes swirled around him. Amongst those runes were countless kinds of energies: metal, wood, water, fire, earth, wind, lightning, light, and dark—the basic building blocks of this world.

Lei Linger and Huo Linger had transformed into two large dragons swirling around Long Chen, absorbing their respective energies while blocking any other energies.

They had essentially filtered these Heavenly Dao runes. After going through them, specks of starlight and some blood-colored light slowly fell on Long Chen.

When these energies entered Long Chen, he shook, and a sacred dragon cry rang out. The next moment, Long Chen’s divine ring automatically appeared, and countless stars blazed within it.

BOOM!

Suddenly, the void around him exploded, and he felt as though he were an ancient beast awakened by the scent of fresh blood. With wild abandon, he started to voraciously absorb the energy he required, in a frenzy that bordered on the most berserk and barbaric form of absorption.

As his energy awakened, heaven and earth trembled in response, as if the world itself was angered. Dark clouds gathered ominously overhead, shrouding Long Chen in their shadows.

However, Long Chen ignored them and continued to absorb this energy. He could now sense his dragon blood power and astral energy awakening, and even his slumbering seven-color Supreme Blood and violet blood were starting to fluctuate.

Long Chen didn’t need to do anything and just needed to follow his instincts. On their own, his astral energy, dragon blood, seven-color Supreme Blood, and violet blood greedily absorbed the energy of this world. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

Gradually, the Heavenly Daos grew more berserk along with the fluctuations of the laws. A will of annihilation gradually enveloped Long Chen.

An angry vein throbbed on Long Chen’s forehead. Even though he told himself not to get angry, when he sensed that destructive will, his killing intent exploded.

The Sovereign Emperor Heaven was said to be the highest plane of the nine heavens—the strongest heaven and the peak of this world. Long Chen had hoped countless times that it would be a bit more fair.

However, his silent hope was instantly eradicated. If his world’s highest laws wanted to destroy him, it meant that this world would never be fair to him.

BOOM!

He suddenly stood up and stared up at the nine heavens. Anger simmered in his eyes as he confronted the ominous dark clouds overhead.

“Anger is always the display of the weak.”

Suddenly, a sinister voice echoed from behind him, causing Long Chen's heart to skip a beat. Taking a deep breath, he slowly turned around to face the source of the voice.

“You finally showed yourself.”
