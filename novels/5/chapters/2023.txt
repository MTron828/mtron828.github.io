Long Chen’s shout was like thunder, and a powerful aura suddenly caused Leng Wufeng to retreat in shock. His sword unleashed thousands of rays of light that formed a thick barrier in front of him.

Just as everyone thought that Long Chen was about to unleash the dying struggle of a trapped beast, all he did was say a single word and point at Leng Wufeng. He didn’t attack at all. With just a point and a shout, Leng Wufeng had fled in terror and summoned his strongest defense. It was both shocking and laughable.

“With just this little bit of courage, you dare to challenge me? Go back and train for another five hundred years!” sneered Long Chen.

As he said this, people realized that something was off. His previous shout had contained immense dragon might that had deeply shaken them, but afterward, runes began to appear on his body. Those runes began to rumble.

“No, that’s not his true body! It’s just a clone!” exclaimed one expert suddenly.

As for the elder from Pill Valley, he couldn’t believe his eyes. It had clearly been Long Chen’s true body. When had it become a clone?

“Long Chen, die!”

Leng Wufeng was infuriated. He had actually almost pissed himself for a clone? His sword slashed toward Long Chen.

“Want to kill this clone of mine? Give up. You don’t have the courage,” sneered Long Chen. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

BOOM!

Long Chen’s body exploded, transforming into arcs of lightning that faded away. Everyone was silent.

“What is going on?!” Pill Valley’s elder no longer appeared calm. He was completely dumbfounded, infuriated, and panicked.

“Long Chen fooled everyone. He only sent a clone to test us,” sighed someone.

“No. What came was his true body,” said an extremely thin man.

“His true body? You call this a true body?” said the first person irritably.

“It was his true body at the start, but once the fighting started, it became a clone,” replied the thin man.

Hearing that, everyone suddenly gasped, understanding.

Qi Fengxue sneered, “When Long Chen kicked that pervert, he already knew something was up, which was why when he slapped Xiong Tianba. He then unleashed such an explosion of power to cover everyone’s sight. My guess is that Long Chen condensed this lightning clone at that time, killed someone in the crowd, disguised himself, and left under his new identity. The odds of pulling off such a thing are normally very low, but with everyone’s attention gathered on Long Chen’s clone and Xiong Tianba, then adding in the chaos at the time, Long Chen easily escaped. It’s quite laughable that certain people thought that victory was already in their grasp and intentionally stalled for more time without realizing that the real Long Chen had long since left. Remember what Long Chen said? The goal isn’t to play with you, it’s to play you to death. This trip to Pill Valley wasn’t a waste. Thank you for the great show. Goodbye.”

After saying that, Qi Fengxue pulled Qi Xuan over to leave along with the rest of the Heaven Reaching Ancient Castle’s disciples. However, they found their path barred by a group of experts from Pill Valley.

“What? If we’re not loyal to Pill Valley, you’ll kill us? Even being neutral is no good, huh?” sneered Qi Fengxue.

The elder’s expression sank. He was filled with killing intent and rage. He had been completely duped by Long Chen, and now Qi Fengxue was taunting him in front of so many people.

However, he still retained some brains and waved his hand at those experts, having them back away. Qi Fengxue and the others left peacefully.

“Grand Elder Tianxi, Long Chen can’t have escaped! Our formation has already sealed the surroundings...” whispered one Elder.

“He didn’t run. He entered the Brahma secret realm,” said Grand Elder Tianxi.

This elder was actually one of Pill Valley’s Grand Elders. With that kind of status, it had been many years since he had been forced to handle such mundane affairs. However, this time, he had been completely fooled by Long Chen.

“Everyone, you’ve also seen just how crafty Long Chen is. The Brahma secret realm only has one exit, which is here in Pill Valley. Although he has fled inside, he’s still trapped. He won’t be able to escape our grasp. However, now you’ll need to be careful in the Brahma secret realm. Be clear on just how vicious Long Chen is. The only good thing is that he doesn’t have a barrier breaking bead, and so he can’t enter the core region. Even if he steals one of those beads from someone else, it would be useless because the power of the gods lies within the beads. As an enemy of Pill Valley, the bead would automatically explode if he tried using it. Even if it doesn’t kill him, he’ll end up covered in dirt. So you should make sure to protect your barrier breaking beads, because without them, you might not be able to escape him,” said the elder. He ordered people to continue distributing the barrier breaking beads.

The experts who received them walked into the channel. Perhaps at first they had been excited, but now knowing that a demon like Long Chen was inside, their hearts trembled.

As for the experts in charge of handing the barrier breaking beads over, they didn’t dare to make a noise because they had just made a grave mistake. They were closely defending the barrier breaking beads, but just now a certain person had come over to them and walked into the channel. They had carelessly given him a bead.

When they thought back to it, that person had to be Long Chen. With their attention drawn by his clone, they hadn’t even hesitated to give him one. They didn’t mention this.

“Hmph, who cares about Long Chen? Once I’m inside, I’ll cut off his head,” sneered Leng Wufeng, taking a barrier breaking bead and walking in.

The others looked at him disdainfully, but they didn’t say anything. Long Chen was able to scare him away with just a pointing of his finger, yet he still dared to say such big words? Did he even believe himself?

“Long Chen, just wait. Once my manifestation is fixed, you’ll be the first one I kill,” said Xiong Tianba hatefully. If he were to go looking for Long Chen, it would be no different than looking for death right now. All his hopes lay in finding something to restore his manifestation in the Brahma secret realm.

The other experts entered one by one. However, some of them were clearly struggling with a certain decision.

With Long Chen inside, it was like a tiger had been released, while they were all sheep. That feeling was terrifying.

However, with everyone else entering, those experts also clenched their teeths and entered, praying that they didn’t encounter Long Chen.

“Elder Tianxi, shouldn’t we alert the valley master?” asked one of Pill Valley’s Elders quietly.

“We cannot. The birth of the divine daughter has caused a divine blessing to descend onto her father as well. He is currently breaking through his shackles with that blessing. We cannot distract him,” said Elder Tianxi.

“Then what about Long Chen?” asked the Elder worriedly.

“What are you so worried about? Having entered the Brahma secret realm, Long Chen will probably die. If he encounters the divine daughter, he’ll definitely die. What mortal genius could contend with the divine daughter? Furthermore, it’s not a bad thing that he got in. It applies more pressure on the others to enter the core region. We’ll gain more supporters. The day that we dominate the continent grows ever closer.” Elder Tianxi smiled. Despite having been fooled by Long Chen, it seemed that he had found his confidence once more.

“What about the Heaven Reaching Ancient Castle? Are we really going to just let them off like this?” probed the Elder. The formation had yet to be dispelled. No one could leave.

“Let them go. Now isn’t the time to teach them their lesson. Once we control the entire continent, can’t we just crush whoever we want?” said Elder Tianxi indifferently.

The other Elders nodded and left. Without Edler Tianxi’s approval, they couldn’t deactivate the formation. Only with this approval could Qi Fengxue and the others leave Pill Valley’s territory.

“Long Chen, it doesn’t matter how many tricks you have. You won’t be leaving alive.” Once the others had all scattered, Elder Tianxi clenched his teeth furiously. That calm confidence of his had actually just been a front.

...

“They all said that they felt the Grand Dao here. Why don’t I feel anything?”

Long Chen walked through the channel, entering a new world. However, the closeness of the Grand Dao that the others had felt was nowhere to be seen for him.

Long Chen’s original plan was to speed away upon arriving, but he suddenly had a thought. He ran back to the channel and calmly waited there.

As expected, after a bit, one expert after another walked in. This time, it was no longer people from the Xuan Beasts but every single faction. As for the whole drawing lots to see who would enter first, that was all nonsense. They had just been stalling for time.

With Long Chen already in, they no longer had to do that, so everyone was slowly entering.

When those experts walked in, they were filled with great hopes and expectations. But upon seeing Long Chen waiting for them, their hearts sank.

“Oh, how are you?” greeted Long Chen.

“Heavens, have my eyes stopped working?!” Those experts let out startled cries.

“Long Chen, what are you doing?!” demanded someone from the ancient races.

“This road was opened by me, these trees were planted by me. If you want to pass, leave behind the toll fee first. If someone wants to cheat me, well, I’m only in charge of killing, not burying bodies!”

Long Chen rested Evilmoon on his shoulder lazily. He had an evil smile on his face.
