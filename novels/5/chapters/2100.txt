Chapter 2090 Infinite Eight Bitters Root

Kun Pengzi began walking over to Long Chen, but halfway there, he turned and walked to Huang Feiyan, sitting beside her.

Huang Feiyan’s mouth moved. Their seat was covered by a sound formation, so it was impossible to tell what they were talking about.

Kun Pengzi turned slightly to glance at Long Chen after hearing what she said. His sharp face was expressionless.

“Long Chen, you’ve gained another terrifying enemy. It was said that the Peng Emperor has passed on his life’s mission to Kun Pengzi, having entrusted everything to him. He is his true successor. As for you, considering your enmity with the Xuan Beasts, there will definitely be a fierce battle between the two of you,” warned Beitang Rushuang.

Even Beitang Rushuang was worrying for Long Chen. He really was surrounded by enemies, each stronger than the last.

“A fight’s a fight. I’m used to it,” said Long Chen indifferently. This was also a reason he hadn’t wanted to come to this gathering. This scene was essentially what he had predicted.

Of course, hiding was not a solution. In the cultivation world, yielding and accommodating others would not get you peace. It would just make the storm grow stronger before it crashed down upon you.

If you took a step back, your enemies would take a step forward. You couldn’t compromise your way out of that. In the end, you would be forced back to a land of death without a chance to turn things around.

Kun Pengzi’s arrival caused quite a few waves. After all, he was the son of one of the three Emperors. His status and position was extremely high.

Kun Pengzi as an Emperor’s son and the Pill Fairy as a divine daughter were like two huge mountains amongst their midst, suffocating them.

Only Shi Lingfeng was glaring at Kun Pengzi. Kun Pengzi was a true Emperor’s son. Hence, Shi Lingfeng’s own status as the descendant of one of the three Emperors was now no longer high.

First, the Peng Emperor had been acknowledged by everyone as one of the three Emperors. As for the Stone Emperor, he had barely managed to get that title because the Corrupt Emperor had refused to call himself Emperor. Even if he called himself Emperor, the Stone Emperor was just gilding his own face. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

Second, Kun Pengzi was the Peng Emperor’s direct son with a bloodline inheritance. As for Shi Lingfeng, he was just one of the Stone Emperor’s descendants. The Stone race were not humans nor beasts, so there was no such thing as a bloodline for them.

“Kun Pengzi, once this gathering is over, I want to ask for some pointers from you. Please show me the supreme techniques of the Peng Emperor.” In the end, Shi Lingfeng wasn’t able to stop himself from challenging Kun Pengzi.

However, in front of Kun Pengzi, Shi Lingfeng didn’t dare to be arrogant. Even though it was a challenge, it wasn’t overbearing.

“Any time you want,” responded Kun Pengzi in a cold tone.

As time passed, more and more experts filled the room. Long Chen counted over eighty people.

“That person is...” Suddenly, Ye Lingshan’s pupils shrank as she spotted someone at the entrance. At some point, a small, delicate figure had appeared.

She appeared silently without anyone noticing. It was like she didn’t even exist. If they didn’t personally see her, there would have been no way to sense her existence.

She wore a black cloak that covered most of her face. It only revealed a straight nose and a small mouth.

From her figure and what was revealed of her face, she looked to be around fourteen to fifteen years old. She hadn’t even fully grown up, but her appearance shook everyone present.

Every person here, as a supreme genius, possessed amazing spiritual perception. But not one of them had sensed this girl’s arrival.

Most shocking of all, this girl was the same as the Pill Fairy. She had a divine ring behind her head casting her in holy divine light.

Long Chen’s heart shook. He almost instantly thought of a certain name: Dong Mingyu.

Back in the day, she had gotten third place on the Devil Slaughter Rankings. Now she was appearing before everyone with another status. The ring behind her showed that she was also a divine daughter.

“Junior sister Dong Mingyu, you’re finally here.” Dongfang Yuyang immediately went to greet her. With another divine daughter present, the atmosphere grew heavier once more.

Even these supreme geniuses, who had swept through their generations, felt a mountain-like pressure in the face of those who had the inheritances of gods.

Dong Mingyu nodded without saying anything and walked over to her own seat. Her hood was up, not allowing anyone to see her expression.

For her large cloak to cover her small body was a bit odd looking, but the sight of her made every expert feel a profound sense of fear.

The Bloodkill Hall was legendary for its assassinations. They were skilled in killing targets far stronger than them. As their ordinary disciples could assassinate targets across realms, their divine daughter must be even more terrifying than them.

After Dong Mingyu’s arrival, there were a total of eighty-seven people. Long Chen didn’t see Mo Nian’s figure anywhere.

“Respected heavenly geniuses, thank you for attending our third auction. This auction is the most important one, and I trust that it won’t disappoint you.”

The original pill appraiser who had hosted the last auction came up once more, his voice resounding throughout the room. Perhaps he simply understood the characters of heavenly geniuses, and he didn’t waste words. He got straight to the first treasure.

“This is an Infinite Eight Bitters Root, an immortal remnant. It has long since gone extinct, and this root here might be one of a kind. It contains eight kinds of bitterness: birth, age, sickness, death, parting with love, meeting with hate, failure, and the five sufferings of the skandhas. It penetrates deep into the heart and can temper the will as well as bestow comprehension of life. It is one of the best medicines for peering into the Heavenly Daos. It can be said that this Infinite Eight Bitters Root is a priceless treasure, but the regretful thing is, due to how old it is, it has used up almost all its spirituality. It only has the slightest trace of life left. As a result, its medicinal effect has sharply dropped, and as for the eight realms of bitterness it embodies, their essence is sharply discounted...”

The middle-aged man couldn’t help having a regretful expression. Such a priceless treasure had been wasted like this.

The other experts’ eyes had been shining at the start, as they had heard of the great name of the Infinite Eight Bitters Root before. However, if such a priceless treasure had lost all its energy, then it wasn’t really valuable.

They even guessed that this Infinite Eight Bitters Root was something someone had just tossed in because it was useless. Its actual value was very low.

The middle-aged man continued, “Although its actual value is now low, it can be considered a one-of-a-kind object, so we decided to use it to open this auction. Whether or not it’s useful depends on the person. I’m sure many of the heavenly geniuses here have some interest in it. The Infinite Eight Bitters Root, starting price of thirty underworld spirit beads. Each bid must be five beads greater than the last. Let the bidding start now.”

Long Chen’s heart pounded wildly as he looked at that Infinite Eight Bitters Root. It was definitely an extremely precious medicinal plant. It had no tier, but if refined into medicinal powder, it could be merged into many kinds of medicinal pills to increase their quality. Any pill its powder was added to would no longer be as explosive.

That middle-aged man clearly knew that, which was why he had such a regretful expression. It had too little life energy to refine into medicinal powder. The amount of energy it possessed was probably only enough for one expert to experience the eight bitters realm, and that realm wouldn’t be as perfect as before.

The starting auction item was extremely important. It couldn’t be too precious, or it would overshadow the following items. It also couldn’t be ordinary, or people wouldn’t be interested in the rest of the auction.

So the first item had to be attractive while not being very expensive. Thus, this deteriorated Infinite Eight Bitters Root had been tossed out.

“Thirty-five underworld spirit beads.”

Someone immediately shouted a bid.

“Forty underworld spirit beads.”

“Fifty underworld spirit beads.”

...

The price grew higher and higher. It quickly reached seventy-five underworld spirit beads. This bid was from Huang Feiyan.

After this bid, many of the other bidders shook their heads. This price was too high, and they also didn’t want to fight against Huang Feiyan who was famous for being a petty woman.

“Eighty underworld spirit beads.”

Just as Huang Feiyan thought that the Infinite Eight Bitters Root was about to enter her pocket, Long Chen opened his mouth.

This time, Long Chen didn’t have Beitang Rushuang act for him. Last time, she had done it for Long Chen to get some advantage.

However, this time, it was different. As an alchemist, Long Chen knew why Huang Feiyan wanted this Infinite Eight Bitters Root. Her Spiritual Strength was her weak point as a Xuan Beast. She had always wanted to make up for it. Furthermore, as a Xuan Beast, her comprehension of the eight bitters like birth, age, and death was below average.

So even though this Infinite Eight Bitters Root had almost lost all its power, someone as rich as her could afford it for the chance that it might allow her soul to advance.

She had clearly shown her hand. This Eight Infinite Bitters Root was a must-have for her. If Long Chen made Beitang Rushuang bid for him, she would draw the ire of Huang Feiyan. Pulling someone he trusted down wasn’t something that Long Chen would do, so he bid himself.

As expected, Huang Feiyan instantly became frosty. She turned around to glare at Long Chen.

“One hundred underworld spirit beads!” Huang Feiyan was enraged. She thought that Long Chen was intentionally finding trouble for her.

“One hundred and five,” bid Long Chen.

He also viewed this Infinite Eight Bitters Root as a must-have because he had the primal chaos space. He could restore it and grow more. That would be of great help in his alchemy.

“Long Chen, you are courting death!” roared Huang Feiyan. An invisible pressure burst out of her, startling the other experts.
