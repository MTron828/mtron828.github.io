Chapter 3251 Dragonblood Warrior Qi Yu

Long Chen found that when the third medicinal pill entered his stomach, its power remained condensed and didn’t scatter. It formed a lump of energy, and the runes didn’t absorb it.

It seemed that they were satisfied and couldn’t eat anymore. Perhaps they were too full to consume more and needed to slowly digest this energy.

This was Long Chen’s first time encountering such a situation. After just two pills, he felt that his physical body had strengthened a great deal. As a result, he didn’t dare to imagine just how powerful his physical body would grow once he reached the peak of the Four Peak realm.

At the same time, he sank into thought. Looking at the primal chaos space, he had a feeling that it was bestowing some kind of indescribable energy to the Peakless Pills.

The immortal world’s Heavenly Daos refused to permit the birth of the Peakless Pill, perhaps because the pill would absorb some kind of taboo energy. But the primal chaos space somehow gave that energy to Long Chen.

Even the immortal world didn’t wish to give him this energy. Long Chen didn’t know what it was, but he was growing increasingly confident that the primal chaos space was greatly connected to the Nine Star Hegemon Body Art. Unfortunately, he knew too little about this treasure that he had obtained from the Jiuli secret realm.

“Jiuli secret realm… Jiuli race…”

The two names were the same. Just how were they connected?

Just as he sank into thought, Qin Feng came rushing over anxiously. “Boss, another brother of the Dragonblood Legion has come!”

Long Chen was startled. “Did something happen to him?!”

Long Chen rushed over to the infirmary to see a familiar face. He was Qi Yu. Long Chen naturally knew the name of every Dragonblood warrior.

He belonged to the second corps and thus was one of Li Qi’s subordinates. But at the moment, he was on his last breaths and unconscious. It looked as if he might lose his life at any moment.

“Our ferry was just about to be activated when this brother charged over, saying that he was from the Dragonblood Legion and he wanted to see Long Chen. Then he fell unconscious. We didn’t have any powerful healing experts on our ship and were barely able to conserve his life with medicinal pills. My apologies,” said an expert from the Huayun Trading Company.

Long Chen carefully examined Qi Yu’s wounds. His insides had been shattered, and his soul was damaged. Moreover, his body seemed to be under some kind of curse.

Even so, the High Firmament Academy’s healing experts were truly powerful. These terrible wounds had already been suppressed, so his life was in no danger. He would slowly recover.

“You’re too courteous. I will remember this favor.” Long Chen bowed to that expert from the Huayun Trading Company. The Huayun Trading Company was truly a terrifying existence.

They naturally had goods that had to come and go through the Heavenly Swell Domain. Thus, they needed to cross the devil sea.

Their merchant ships had special runes on them that made it so that they were essentially never attacked while crossing the devil sea. With every crossing, some people who wanted safe passage through the devil sea would pay a toll to get into the merchant ship.

Most experts that came here and went through the devil sea chose to use the Huayun Trading Company’s merchant ships. Although it was expensive, it was rather safe.

This time, just as they had been about to move out, Qi Yu had come flying over. After spitting out some rushed words, he fell unconscious.

Because all the experts from the Huayun Trading Company knew Long Chen’s name, they brought Qi Yu along. Once they were through the devil sea, they brought him to the High Firmament Academy. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

This person was very courteous. He specifically said that Zheng Wenlong had just left when Qi Yu arrived, so they hadn’t run into each other. Zheng Wenlong was unaware of this matter, so he shouldn’t be blamed.

Long Chen was extremely grateful to this person, so he immediately paid for the ferry fee and the medicinal pills. After that, that person said some polite words and took the money.

After all, this was a business relationship. Long Chen naturally wouldn’t let them lose out. However, if Long Chen had overpaid, the Huayun Trading Company would also be unhappy. To use the Huayun Trading Company’s words, their money had to be earned using their own abilities, not simply charity from others.

After sending off that expert from the Huayun Trading Company, Qin Feng looked at the unconscious Qi Yu. He then clenched his teeth angrily. “There are seven wounds on his body that could have been fatal. Furthermore, his body seems to have been poisoned. This is clearly a plot using poison. Just who would be so despicable?”

The Dragonblood warriors were all close. On the battlefield, they wouldn’t hesitate to receive the enemy’s attacks for their brothers. Hence, seeing Qi Yu in this state provoked Qin Feng’s killing intent.

“The situation probably isn’t simple. Qi Yu has actually awakened the primal bloodline on his own. He must have encountered his own special opportunity. Furthermore, his physical body has been strengthened several times. Although he can’t compare to you, he’s much stronger than other Primals. Don’t rush. Once Qi Yu awakens, we’ll know everything. The Dragonblood Legion won’t provoke trouble, but we’re not afraid of it either. If Qi Yu was in the right, it doesn’t matter who the other side is. We’ll make them pay the price.”

Long Chen was angrier than anyone when he saw Qi Yu’s state. He had a deep understanding of every Dragonblood warrior. They were all straightforward and sincere men, so Qi Yu couldn’t possibly have done anything wrong.

After a day, with the treatment of the infirmary’s experts, Qi Yu gradually awakened. When he opened his eyes and saw Long Chen and Qin Feng, he wept.

“Boss…”

“Good brother. Don’t get emotional. Your soul has been damaged, and too many emotions can further tear it.” Long Chen and Qin Feng were both aggrieved. This man that was unafraid of death was actually weeping.

“Boss, I’m sorry. I betrayed the Dragonblood Legion.” Qi Yu continued to weep.

“What are you talking about?” asked Long Chen.

Qi Yu wiped away his tears. He then lowered his head, not even looking at them. “When I ascended to the immortal world, I joined the Yuhua Prefecture’s Yuhua Palace. Because my aptitude wasn’t bad and I was willing to work for it, I rose to the level of a core disciple…”

As Qi Yu explained, Long Chen and Qin Feng came to know that Qi Yu had had much better luck than Qin Feng.

The Yuhua Prefecture was located in the Heavenly Star Domain, which was Xu Zixiong’s homeland. However, the Yuhua Prefecture was on the other edge of the Heavenly Star Domain, so it was further away from the Heavenly Swell Domain.

The Yuhua Palace was the number one force in the Yuhua Prefecture, and it had an Immortal King standing over it. It was a large existence even within the Heavenly Star Domain as a whole.

Qi Yu’s luck was quite good after ascending. He ended up right in the Yuhua Prefecture and joined the number one power, the Yuhua Palace.

Due to his aptitude and shocking killing power, the Yuhua Palace broke the rules and accepted him inside, and he soared like a shooting star. In just a few months, he rose to become a core disciple.

After becoming a core disciple, he still stood out amongst the crowd. He then received the favor of a senior apprentice-sister and obtained qualifications to attend a baptism. In just a single baptism, Qi Yu managed to awaken his primal bloodline.

Qu Yu was extremely grateful to that senior apprentice-sister. Both of their characters meshed, and they gradually became lovers. However, this was also the cause of a calamity.
