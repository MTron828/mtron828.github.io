Chapter 3239 The Chu Family’s Destruction

Chu Yingxiong’s death made the Chu family lose all hope. Having lost the will to fight, the Chu family’s experts fled.

As for the various experts of the Sheng Prefecture, they were led by the Chu family, and the only reason they fought so hard was because if they didn’t, they wouldn’t be able to keep their lives. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

They were afraid of the Chu family’s bloody methods, as well as Lord Brahma’s power. But with Chu Yingxiong dead, everything was over. There was no need for them to keep risking their lives.

As a result, all of the Sheng Prefecture’s experts fled. As for Qin Feng, Bai Xiaole, Xu Zixiong, and the others, they rejoined Long Chen.

Qin Feng and the others were covered in blood. Xu Zixiong in particular had several holes in his body, and one of his arms was almost falling from his body. Luo Bing, Luo Xue, and the others were also soaked in blood. Moreover, only over eighty archers remained.

Qin Feng’s side had also been an intense battlefield. His Treasure item saber was now jagged. It seemed that he had encountered a terrifying opponent as well.

If it hadn’t been for the Luo family’s archers, there would have been no way they could stop all those Divine Lords. Those Divine Lords had almost gone crazy. Quite a few of them were Lord Brahma’s fervent believers. Faith sometimes unleashed a terrifying power.

“Grand Elder, are you alright?”

Just then, a startled cry rang out. The Grand Elder had exchanged serious wounds with Chu Yingxiong. Now, he was tottering, his face white as paper. When his aura instantly weakened, it caused people to jump.

“It’s fine. The medicinal effect has passed, so a temporary weakness is natural. Help the Grand Elder recover, and we’ll immediately leave.” Long Chen grabbed Chu Yingxiong’s head as he spoke. Just then, he used thunderforce to shatter his soul and conduct a quick soulsearch.

Luo Changwen suddenly shouted, “This battle was between the Luo family and the Chu family. It has nothing to do with others. The Chu family was the ringleader, and the rest of you were simply forced to do their bidding. My Luo family won’t place the blame on you. You can also be counted as victims, so the Chu family’s businesses here are yours to split up as compensation. My Luo family will not be touching them.”

His voice reached those fleeing experts. Hence, they hastily stopped and looked back at the Luo family.

Long Chen raised his thumb as Luo Changwen. He truly was skilled. At the next moment, an Elder took out a family boat, and everyone quickly got on.

After getting on the boat, all the Luo family’s powerful experts felt a wave of weakness. Luo Changwen and Luo Changwu felt a splitting headache, so they sagged on the ground weakly.

This was the aftereffect of the Explosive Blood Pill. It overdrafted their bloodline power to forcibly increase their realm.

Fortunately, having gotten onto the flying boat, the outsiders couldn’t possibly notice. As they directly left, countless experts instantly turned greedy and charged back.

“Fuck, the Chu family has bullied us for so many years. It’s time for compensation!”

“Grab what you can!”

“Not just that, don’t forget to eliminate the Chu family while you can!”

The Sheng Prefecture’s experts directly charged back on the Chu family. Being forced to submit to the Chu family was something that they had no choice in. Moreover, only some people were loyal followers of Lord Brahma, but they had mostly been killed by Qin Feng and the others. The others had no feelings toward Lord Brahma and only had hatred for the Chu family.

“Kill!”

The Chu family was suddenly filled with the sound of battle once more. The Sheng Prefecture’s experts launched a slaughter against the survivors of the Chu family. Killing people for their treasures was a scene that constantly repeated itself all the time.

On top of the flying boat, Long Chen shook his head as he watched the chaos and flames that engulfed the Chu family.

“People in this world should understand gratitude when weak and respect when strong. The Chu family did things in an overbearing manner. Sometimes leaving people a way out is also leaving yourself a way out in the future.”

Long Chen’s quick soulsearch on Chu Yingxiong’s soul made him aware of all kinds of outrageous acts done by the Chu family. They were enough to enrage him, so their destruction today was retribution for all of that.

“It’s too bad that the Luo family’s fallen children weren’t here. Otherwise, there would have truly been a slaughter. The Chu family owes us far too much.” The Grand Elder clenched his teeth despite being in a weakened state.

The Grand Elder had followed Luo Zichuan the longest. He was the last remaining member of the ten great generals, and it was unknown how many people beside him had died to the Chu family’s hands. His hatred for the Chu family had already sunk into his bones.

The reason he had gone so crazy against Chu Yingxiong was because he suddenly thought of all his brothers that had died in Chu Yingxiong’s hands. Seeing victory in sight, he didn’t even care if he died. He was willing to drag Chu Yingxiong down with him.

“Grand Elder, if you go see our Luo family’s ancestors like this, they will definitely curse you,” said Luo Changwen. He knew what the Grand Elder was thinking. He wanted to go accompany those brothers once more, which was why he had launched such a foolish attack. If it hadn’t been for Luo Changwen and Luo Changwu at the end, he really might have died with Chu Yingxiong.

“You are correct. If I die like this, so worthlessly when I can still have use, my brothers will definitely curse me.” The Grand Elder nodded, taking this lesson to heart.

Luo Changwen nodded. “The ancestors of the Luo family were all heroes. They didn’t frown at all when going into battle. But for them to go slaughter those weak children and women, even if there is a giant sea of blood’s worth of enmity between us, they definitely wouldn’t be able to do that. Since they can’t do that, and since such a scourge cannot be left alive, this is the best end.”

The other Elders all nodded. Although they hated the Chu family to an indescribable level, after killing their warriors, they were unable to carry out the full massacre.

Looking at the sea of fire filling the Chu family, and the countless experts slaughtering and pillaging their land, they knew that the Chu family was truly done for.

Even if the Luo family didn’t do anything, the Sheng Prefecture’s experts would make sure that the Chus were torn out by the roots. They were all afraid that the Chu family might rise once more and find them for revenge.

It was just like back in the day when the Luo and the Chu families first fought. They wouldn’t let this history repeat itself. They would not let the Chu family rise once more.

All of them could see the Luo family’s mistake. Thus, they would not let that history repeat itself. They were not the Luo family. If those remnants were not annihilated, they would have to worry about their descendants being wiped out.

“Long Chen, are you alright?” Luo Changwen turned to Long Chen. He was also covered in blood.

“I’m fine. I didn’t even have a chance to use my abilities. It was definitely a vexing battle for me. We only won thanks to everyone’s contributions.” Long Chen smiled bitterly.

It felt like he had never had a chance to really use his full power. Even Lei Linger hadn’t had a chance to unleash any big moves. By the time he had a chance to do anything, his saber was broken, and then that terrifying lifeform had prepared.

Overlooking the entire battlefield, it felt like he had been the most useless one. This truly was a vexing battle.

“You’re too humble. Without you, the Luo family would probably have been destroyed,” said Luo Changwu. “Only now did I understand what it means that the younger generation will surpass the old. Speaking of which, did you manage to find out any of the secrets of the Chu family?”
