Chapter 3407 Controversy

A blinding light illuminated the world. It was like seven suns were shining right in front of them, and they couldn’t even open their eyes.

The seven colors were shining together. People couldn’t believe what they were seeing.F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

“I don’t believe it! There must be something wrong with the testing gate!” shouted one expert. How could they possibly believe such a thing? This was completely against the laws of cultivation.

The Four Peak realm involved abandoning all other powers in the body and focusing on the four strongest to decide their future path. This rule had never changed since ancient times.

Thus, the only thing they could believe was that the testing gate was broken. Everyone’s attention focused on those elders of the Sacred Pill Hall.

However, those elders were also shocked. They knew that there was nothing wrong with the testing gate.

The light vanished. After that, one of the Sacred Pill Hall’s elders announced, “Everyone, we have never encountered such a thing either. Perhaps this junior brother cultivates a special cultivation technique, or perhaps he has some treasure that interferes with the testing gate. These are all just guesses. Our Sacred Pill Hall doesn’t dare to say anything rash about whether or not a person in this world can cultivate seven kinds of power. We can only set this matter aside for now. I will report to the higher-ups that this Boss- cough, that this junior brother has a strange result. Junior, we will inform you later about what fee you must pay to enter the Divine Lord Immortal Realm.”

That elder had directly read from Long Chen’s status plate and almost called him Boss Long San. Fortunately, he managed to cover it up. He then tossed the status plate back to Long Chen with a glare.

He was no fool. He knew that Long Chen had done this on purpose. What person dared to call themselves that? What would his own family’s people call him then?

Although this elder didn’t say that there was no problem with the testing gate, he also didn’t believe the fact that Long Chen could cultivate seven different kinds of power at once. So, he simply put out two other possibilities to cover up this matter.

However, this matter still caused huge waves. Everyone was staring at Long Chen. They began to feel that he was probably a mysterious and terrifying fellow.

Long Chen then walked down. Lei Yuner was the first to receive him, and she grabbed his hands. “I knew that you were hiding yourself deeply! But I didn’t expect you to be this amazing!”

If others simply refused to believe it, then Lei Yuner absolutely did believe it. She didn’t care about common sense. She believed her own eyes and perception.

Just then, the next person started the test, and it went as normally as possible. Everyone once more glanced at Long Chen oddly.

There was definitely no problem with the testing gate. Then those guesses from the Sacred Pill Hall’s elder might really have struck the mark.

Either his cultivation technique was special, or he had some peerless treasure that interfered with the testing gate. That, or… he really did cultivate all seven kinds of power.

Whichever guess was right, Long Chen would still be counted as a mysterious and powerful existence. Now, countless demonic beasts were moved.

“Don’t even think about it! He has agreed to have my child! If you want some as well, then you better discuss it with my Lightning Falcon race first. We might consider renting you some time as well!” shouted Lei Yuner, blocking the other demonic beasts from charging at Long Chen.

Long Chen almost coughed up blood. How did he end up being treated as some stud horse? For rent? What?

However, he didn’t contradict her words because rather than being entangled with all those demonic beasts, dealing with her alone was easier.

Those demonic beasts flinched back. The Lightning Falcon race’s name was quite effective, and no one dared to provoke them.

However, some of them weren’t much weaker than the Lightning Falcon race. So, some outstandingly beautiful and powerful women came up to give Long Chen their ‘business cards’.

Lei Yuner didn’t stop them as she truly had no confidence. What if Long Chen was unhappy with her blocking them? It would be troublesome if he were to turn his back on her.

Long Chen smiled lightly and politely accepted those cards. He couldn’t help finding it funny. He hadn’t lived this life for nothing and had actually managed to run into such a funny situation.

The cards had the names, origins, and power level of their families and races, as well as what kind of glorious future he would have if he joined their families.

In front of their thirsty eyes, Long Chen politely said that he would consider it. It could be considered giving them face.

Just as Long Chen and Lei Yuner were preparing to leave, they were blocked by a group of experts. When Lei Yuner was about to unleash her wrath on them, she saw the leader and hastily bowed.

“Yuner greets the race leader.”

In terms of seniority, this elder was Lei Yuner’s maternal grandfather. Lei Yuner’s mother was his daughter, and her father was a human expert.

It could be said that Lei Yuner was an excellent example of a successful breeding between the human race and the demonic beast race. Her physical body and bloodline power were still powerful, but she had also gained her father’s powerful Spiritual Strength and mental energy, which awakened her bloodline Lightning Pupils.

This was a bloodline divine ability that the Lightning Falcon race had lost for countless years. But it had awakened from Lei Yuner’s mixed blood. It was a huge stroke of luck.

Lei Yuner had inherited ninety percent of her mother’s bloodline talent, as well as ten percent of her father’s. But this ten percent was precisely what she needed. It could be said that she had been born with all the strong points of her parents.

Although the Lightning Falcon race’s direct line of descent had thousands and thousands of members, those with the status of princess like Lei Yuner numbered only a few dozen. As for princes, they had over a hundred. But Lei Yuner was the one that the race leader viewed the most fondly, and the one that he pampered the most.

The position of princess was actually higher than a prince in the Lightning Falcon race, and Lei Yuner stood at the top of all the princesses. Thus, even those half-step World Kings were not placed in her eyes.

“Little fellow, you’re very powerful. If you come to my Lightning Falcon race, it will be my Lightning Falcon race’s blessing,” said the race leader. He patted Long Chen’s shoulder, nodding with praise.

“Senior’s control over energy has definitely reached a pinnacle. It’s very admirable.” Long Chen smiled slightly. This elder looked as if he was just casually patting Long Chen’s shoulder, when actually, an incredibly miniscule energy entered his body to investigate him. Anyone else would probably have been unable to sense it.

The race leader laughed. “Not bad! Youngster, you know how to talk. I like you. Yuner, don’t neglect him and have others mock my Lightning Falcon race for not having manners.”

Seeing him praise Long Chen like this, Lei Yuner was delighted. She immediately nodded and dragged Long Chen away.

Watching them leave, the two half-step World Kings hastily said, “Leader, isn’t this attitude completely cutting off other paths?”

“What do you know? This little human possesses a terrifying physical body. His Blood Qi is strong like a dragon. Perhaps his body is not at all inferior to that brat from the Mammoth Divine Elephant race. Remember, if he is pulled into our Lightning Falcon race, all his children will be ours. We also have dozens of other princesses and tens of thousands of women in the direct bloodline at the appropriate age. If we obtain this fellow and constantly sow seeds, wouldn’t it be tens of thousands of times better than having a marriage with the Mammoth Divine Elephant race?” said the race leader irritably.

He left with them after that. If Long Chen had heard this conversation, he probably would have spat out blood.

Those watching also gradually scattered. No one paid attention to the eighth prince of the Mammoth Divine Elephant race glaring darkly from a distant corner. Cold killing intent raged in his eyes.

“This bastard, you dared to ruin my affairs? Just wait until I tear you to pieces!”
