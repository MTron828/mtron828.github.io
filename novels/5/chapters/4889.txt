Chapter 4878 Blaze Dragon Bone

Long Chen and Mo Nian felt a powerful pressure crash into them, pushing them forward. Both of them nearly spat out blood from the impact. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

At this moment, a powerful resistance tried to stop them, almost crushing them. This gap in Heaven Screen Mountain’s barrier was actually the entrance gate, and since it hadn’t fully formed, the remnant runes still posed a large issue. Long Chen and Mo Nian were straining against this resistance.

Xing Wujiang had long since calculated the right timing, wanting to send Long Chen and Mo Nian in before anyone else. Mo Nian, in particular, needed to reach the devil corpse as quickly as possible. Any delay could introduce unpredictable variables.

Xing Wujiang acted quickly, but the vice hall master also wasn’t slow and immediately sent Qianwu in. However, in the end, she was a bit slower than Long Chen and Mo Nian.

Regardless of whether the vice hall master was actually stronger than Xing Wujiang, in terms of opening Heaven Screen Mountain, Xing Wujiang had far more experience. However, just as Qianwu moved, four more figures shot out like bolts of lightning, following behind her.

When the four figures shot out, even the vice hall master was startled. After all, those who dared to charge in the moment Heaven Screen Mountain opened had to have someone of their caliber assisting them. Otherwise, they would be sending them to their deaths.

Only experts of their level could block the resistance enough to send others through at this critical time. In other words, there were four more powerful beings hidden within the crowd, at least as strong as the vice hall master.

Flames ignited around Qianwu, transforming into a pair of giant wings. With the vice hall master's assistance, she accelerated, disregarding the immense pressure.

“You pieces of trash, if you have guts, come and fight me, Huo Qianwu!”

Only now did Long Chen learn this woman’s full name. However, her words were rather venomous, making Long Chen and Mo Nian find them both laughable and infuriating.

Mo Nian couldn’t help but respond, “Are you an idiot? Who would stay behind to fight you? Are you sure your head isn’t full of crap?”

Mo Nian wasn’t in the habit of indulging others. So, it didn’t matter whether it was a man or woman, he directly cursed back.

“You don’t dare to fight yet still spout such arrogance. Are all men cowards like you? You’ve disgraced all the men in the world!” shouted Huo Qianwu, her mouth not pausing even as she chased with all her power.

“Just like us, your dad’s a man too. I don’t think you should talk to your father like that,” retorted Mo Nian without hesitation.

Long Chen almost slapped his leg in praise. Mo Nian's wit was anything but ordinary; his reaction speed was incredibly fast. Huo Qianwu almost choked at his response, unable to find a retort. Gritting her teeth furiously, she watched as the exit of the channel drew closer.

Suddenly, she swung her hand, and a flame whip shot toward Long Chen and Mo Nian.

The appearance of the whip caused the entire channel to shudder. Seeing this scene, Long Chen and Mo Nian both were worried. If the channel collapsed, everyone within it would die.

Clearly, Huo Qianwu was capable of using some unknown power to compress this channel. If they didn’t want to die, they had to turn back and face her.

“This woman is crazy! I’ll kill her!” raged Mo Nian. Her provocations had pushed him to his limits. She was absolutely shameless.

“You have something important to do. Leave this crazy woman to me,” said Long Chen, shaking his head. Mo Nian's target was the devil corpse, and this matter was critical to Xing Wujiang's life. They could not afford to be careless.

Every bit of time Mo Nian gained increased their chance of success. Just as the flame whip was about to reach them, Long Chen caught it with his left hand and shoved Mo Nian’s back with his right hand.

BOOM!

Long Chen suddenly blazed with light and sent Mo Nian flying like a shooting star. Long Chen had borrowed Huo Qianwu’s power to directly throw Mo Nian into Heaven Screen Mountain.

Long Chen had been planning on mocking her for failing to stop him, but then, he was shocked by the flame whip’s power. If Mo Nian hadn’t helped him bear the brunt of it, he would probably be badly injured.

Long Chen released the whip as the recoil force slowed him down after pushing Mo Nian forward. At this moment, Huo Qianwu reached him.

Snorting, Long Chen aimed a kick at her face. Normally, he wouldn't use such humiliating techniques against a woman, but this crazy woman didn’t deserve any mercy.

Long Chen’s attack enraged Huo Qianwu, and her whip coiled around his foot like a rope.

“Rude brat, I’m taking your leg!” exclaimed Huo Qianwu, her whip moving with shocking speed, instantly binding Long Chen’s leg. Just as she was about to rip his leg off, she was startled to realize that Long Chen had intentionally let her bind his foot. By pulling on the whip, she caused his other foot to whip toward her cheek.

Huo Qianwu's reactions were fast; she managed to raise her hand to defend, but the force of Long Chen’s kick was just too much. Her hand slammed into her own face, and she was violently forced back.

Though the kick didn't land directly on her face, the impact through her hand was nearly as effective. Huo Qianwu was sent flying.

However, Huo Qianwu didn’t panic. She twisted her whip, causing countless bone spurs to emerge out of it. Even after being kicked, she still wanted to tear off Long Chen’s leg. Unfortunately, these bone spurs were unable to pierce Long Chen’s skin. They let out an ear-piercing sound as they scraped against his dragon scales.

Numerous white marks were left on Long Chen’s leg where her whip passed. Some blood oozed off from between his scales.

In this exchange, although Long Chen had the upper hand and sent Huo Qianwu flying, he was utterly shocked. He stared at the flame whip in her hand. Through the raging flames, he saw a whip made of bone.

“Blaze dragon bone!”

Long Chen finally recognized the origin of this whip.
