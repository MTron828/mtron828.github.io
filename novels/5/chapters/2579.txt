Chapter 2568 Bitter Pill

These people were all elders, people with great authority on the continent. Yet, upon seeing Long Chen, they were a bit embarrassed, but they thickened their skin and walked in.

How could Long Chen not see what was going on? He immediately stood. “It seems that the alliance head is planning on holding a gathering. This little one will bid his farewells.”

“Little brat, sit down!” Qu Jianying reddened from anger. Long Chen had instantly seen through her intentions.

Long Chen sat back down. The old man didn’t say anything, looking up at the sky as if nothing here had anything to do with him.

“What do you think should be done in order to strengthen the Martial Heaven Alliance?” Qu Jianying spat out through clenched teeth.

“How could I dare to have an opinion? You look like you’re going to bite me if I say something against you. It’s like I won’t even live to walk out of this courtyard.” Long Chen bitterly smiled.

It really was a case of growing more and more unreasonable with age. After having her plot seen through, she got angry.

It seemed everything before had been a foundation to make Long Chen pull these people in. Although Ye Lingshan was the future alliance head, Long Chen was the true leader of the Righteous path and their strongest force.

In order for these people to join the Martial Heaven Alliance, the first requirement was Long Chen’s approval. Otherwise, if they angered Long Chen, he would leave the Martial Heaven Alliance. Then the people’s hearts would immediately fall apart.

However, it was also unacceptable to not allow them to join. The Martial Heaven Alliance’s divine item, the Martial Heaven Virtue Tablet, required their power in order to unleash its full potential. With the tribulation about to descend, every bit of power could decide life or death.

Although Qu Jianying also didn’t like these people, especially the traitors, now was not the time to bother with those things.

As a result, she had thickened her skin to have Long Chen discuss this matter. Originally, it should be up to Ye Lingshan to do this, but she was worried that Ye Lingshan wouldn’t be able to handle Long Chen, so Qu Jianying had used her status as his senior to require him to participate.

“Long Chen, respectful greetings…” One of the elders thickened his skin and got started.

“Stop, I can’t accept it.” Long Chen waved his hand, indifferently saying, “I’m unable to accept such words from you. If I remember correctly, you were one of the people trying to con others into leaving the Martial Heaven Alliance.”

“That… I was ignorant back then…” The elder was embarrassed. He was quite eloquent and actually quite famous for it. It was precisely because of his eloquence that he had managed to convince many others to leave the alliance as well.

Now that they were returning, he was the one who thickened his skin to speak for those people. So many people had left because of trusting in him. If he didn’t take responsibility for it, he would probably be beaten to death by them.

“So you were ignorant back then. Then are you still ignorant now?” sneered Long Chen.

“Now I’ve been enlightened and know right from wrong…” said the elder hastily.

“Then when will your next moment of ignorance come?” Long Chen curled his lips.

“That…” The elder turned red, not knowing how to reply.

“You’ve taken a blade and left a heavy cut on the Martial Heaven Alliance. Who knows when your next cut will come? Don’t try to push the responsibility onto Pill Valley, the Corrupt path, or the others. You are responsible for your own actions. Who knows whether or not you will be bought by the invaders when the time comes? Will you leave a fatal wound on the Martial Heaven Alliance this time?” demanded Long Chen.

“We swear on our souls…” The elder raised his hand along with the others.

“Put your hands down. I’m not saying these things for you but for the alliance head. I don’t care whether or not you come back. Perhaps it is precisely because it is difficult for me to change my opinion that I’m not suited to be a leader. I don’t have that tolerance to forgive other people’s faults. Betrayal in particular is impossible to forgive. Due to this, I will not state an opinion about your return. Whether or not you return, I am still me. My goals haven’t changed. I don’t want to be some hero, I just want to live while protecting my friends and family. To me, you are completely dispensable. With or without you guys, it doesn’t matter. However, it’s not just me. The people who are most loyal to the Martial Heaven Alliance are the ones most hurt and feel the most disgust for you. Rather than wasting time with me, you should be thinking about how you can make things up to them,” said Long Chen indifferently.

When it came to the neutral factions, Long Chen didn’t like them, but he didn’t hate them either. The ones he hated were those that had betrayed the Martial Heaven Alliance.

Even if it was Qu Jianying trying to advise him, he could not forgive them. But he also wouldn’t kill them or cause trouble for them. He didn’t have the time.

“Then you do not oppose us joining the Martial Heaven Alliance?” asked the elder.

“I do not oppose nor do I endorse it. There is just one thing I want to say.” Long Chen’s suddenly became icy. “If you join and betray the Martial Heaven Alliance again, then no matter where you hide, I will still kill you.”

“Yes, we definitely will not betray you again!”

Those elders were delighted to hear this. Long Chen was essentially approving of them joining the Martial Heaven Alliance. The most difficult juncture had now just passed smoothly.

They hated themselves for their foolishness. Back then, they had thought that the Martial Heaven Alliance had already fallen and would gradually decline until it collapsed. They had seized that opportunity to leave before being implicated themselves.

However, the Martial Heaven Alliance was instead lifted by Long Chen, obtaining the support of the Wine God Palace, the Illusive Music Immortal Palace, and the Divine Ice Palace. Now they were even able to challenge the divine families.

The ones who had left the Martial Heaven Alliance now had nothing to rely on. Once the battle started, they would be instantly devoured by the tide.

Only with a powerful force to rely on did they have any chance of survival. Worst of all, their elite disciples had almost all “betrayed” them, joining the Martial Heaven Alliance against their orders. These old fellows were now only leading a group of young disciples that had yet to grow up, so they had no hope for their futures. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

Returning to the Martial Heaven Alliance was their best option, so they were willing to give up their dignity for this. This was also the will of everyone in their sects.

Long Chen had essentially relented, causing them to thank him and over again. Eventually, they left the courtyard.

“Count yourself tactful.” Qu Jianying smiled, relieved.

“I can’t be bothered to deal with them. The main thing is whether or not the Martial Heaven Alliance can handle the disciples under its banner,” said Long Chen.

“Ye Lingshan has already handled things. In truth, many of their disciples have joined us, leaving their sects hollow shells. Having to suffer through these days afraid of being destroyed at any moment is enough suffering for them. Even though they’re coming back, their actions have left a stain on them. Unless they contribute some kind of great merit, it will be difficult to wash away that disgrace. However, all people have emotions. Those disciples who left their sects to join us have always thought of their sects. Just because of the foolishness of a small portion of people in the sect, the ones in power, the entire sect had to pay the price. That isn’t fair to the others. After all, many people are unable to voice their own thoughts on the matter. Those old fellows are hateful, but there are tens of thousands of innocent disciples in their sects. We can’t ignore them.” Qu Jianying sighed.

This wasn’t her being soft-hearted. It was truly the case. There were many disciples still in their teens in those sects. They didn’t know what was right or wrong, but they still had to pay the price for the ones in charge.

When the battle started, they wouldn’t even have a place to hide. They would die miserably in the chaotic battle, and that was not what Qu Jianying wanted to see.

Long Chen nodded. “Perhaps you are correct. All things have good and bad parts. Forcibly stripping away the bad parts results in excluding a great deal of the good as well.”

Qu Jianying smiled. “I’m glad you understand. You should know that Lingshan has been under immense pressure.”

“Although I understand, I’m unable to accept it. That’s why the head of the Martial Heaven Alliance must have a far vaster heart than me. I’m unable to do the same. I am too direct.”

Long Chen knew that Qu Jianying also felt bitter about letting them join. Long Chen could also understand her reasons for letting them join. However, Long Chen wouldn’t have been able to make the same decision as her. If traitors appeared in the Dragonblood Legion, there was no way he could accept it. He couldn’t imagine how much pain that would cause him.

“One reason for accepting them is because of their innocent disciples. Another reason is because we truly need them. Once they join, all their sects’ karmic luck will support us, and that will allow the Martial Heaven Virtue Tablet to unleash its greatest power. Do you still remember why I had you let the sea demons and the Corrupt path leave?” asked Qu Jianying.

“I really don’t.” Long Chen shook his head. He had wanted to wipe them all out back then.

“It is because both of them have their own terrifying trump cards. The Corrupt path’s trump card is something that even the divine families are afraid of,” said Qu Jianying gravely.

“What trump card?”

“Let’s first talk about the sea demon race. Daoist Heavenly Feather killed one of their kings. However, they have more experts on that level. In truth, the Six Horn Sea Serpent race is not the strongest of the sea demons. They have other experts hidden deep within the sea, and the other sea demons are essentially their servants. Those hidden experts won’t even react to Daoist Heavenly Feather killing that thirteenth rank sea demon. However, if she were to charge into the sea and start slaughtering them, they would definitely make a move,” said Qu Jianying.

Long Chen’s heart pounded. So the Martial Heaven Sea-Ring was actually hiding such experts.

“What about the Corrupt path? Is it the Corrupt God Cemetery?” asked Long Chen.

“No. The Corrupt God Cemetery is just a pretense. Their strongest trump card is another danger zone, Resentful Death City.”
