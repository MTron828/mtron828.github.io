Chapter 2771 Primal Chaos Bead vs. Heaven Devastating Bracelet

“Deal with it!”

Long Chen cried out excitedly when he sensed that will awaken. He had finally succeeded. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

Even without Long Chen’s shout, the primal chaos space shuddered and a fierce aura erupted. It was as if a sleeping dragon had been awoken.

Long Chen only sensed a formless power strike the Heaven Devastating Bracelet before a giant explosion shook the primal chaos space.

At this moment, the giant Heaven Devastating Bracelet was pierced through. A giant hole appeared in it.

The Heaven Devastating Bracelet hadn’t shattered, but just how many times more power must it require to pierce through it rather than shatter it? Even the Martial Heaven Continent was stunned.

After that, the runes covering the Heaven Devastating Bracelet began to explode, and countless cracks appeared throughout the Heaven Devastating Bracelet.

As a result, the world’s aura suddenly cleared, and endless spiritual qi exploded. The density of the spiritual qi was hundreds of times greater than the best spirit gathering formation.

“What?!”

Seeing the Heaven Devastating Bracelet’s runes vanish, the invaders were dumbfounded.

“How can that be?! The Heaven Devastating Bracelet is an immortal item from a higher plane! There is no power in the lower plane that can destroy it!” exclaimed the Blood race’s Emperor.

In the immortal battle back then, the Martial Heaven Continent had been in its strongest state, with countless experts. Even so, no one had been able to destroy the Heaven Devastating Bracelet.

Even though the Heaven Devastating Bracelet had been suppressed, as long as it was given time, it would automatically recover. They were never able to destroy it.

However, now it was destroyed, and they didn’t even see how it was done. Its item-spirit was dead, and the energy it had been extracting all these years was slowly released back into the continent.

“You… you really did it… The Heaven Devastating Bracelet’s energy is slowly returning to its source…!” exclaimed the Martial Heaven Continent.

Just at this moment, the five Sovereigns’ barrier spread, encompassing the Heaven Devastating Bracelet as well.

“Long Chen, don’t waste time. The crisis hasn’t ended. Absorb the energy and become a Sovereign. We must seal the path before they descend!” said Sovereign Yun Shang.

“Everyone else, focus on cultivating. We will keep your foundations stable. Make further breakthroughs!” said Sovereign Zi Yang to the Martial Heaven Continent’s experts.

The five Sovereigns sat in the air, in the east, west, south, north, and center. At the same time, the five supreme divine items unleashed divine light that thrummed through the air. It made people’s minds instantly forget about the invaders, which allowed them to enter a meditative state as fast as possible.

“Stop them!”

The Blood race’s Emperor howled and led his army in attacking the five Sovereigns’ barrier.

They hadn’t been able to shake their barrier before. But now that the barrier had been expanded, due to how its power had been spread further, it was shaking with every blow.

However, this barrier was created with the five Sovereigns’ soul essence, and it contained the power of five generations of Sovereigns. Even if it was spread thinly, the invaders were unable to break it temporarily.

Just at this moment, spiritual qi was exploding out of the Heaven Devastating Bracelet. The energy it had accumulated for tens of thousands of years was being released.

As for Long Chen, he was standing within the hole of the Heaven Devastating Bracelet. Stars revolved around him, and he was crazily sucking in the energy of the Heaven Devastating Bracelet.

In just a short half an incense stick’s worth of time, Long Chen’s aura grew another level. He had reached the tenth Heavenstage.

With his astral energy awakened, Long Chen’s Nine Star Hegemon Body Art possessed a terrifying devouring power. If it weren’t for Ye Ming launching the attack in advance, Long Chen could have taken a stroll throughout the various worlds, and it wouldn’t take too long for him to absorb enough energy to at least become an Emperor.

The Heaven Devastating Bracelet had been like a blood-sucking leech absorbing the Martial Heaven Continent. Now that it had been killed by the primal chaos bead, all that energy was finally returning to the continent.

The primal chaos bead had once more shown its terror. The Heaven Devastating Bracelet that had been shocking the Martial Heaven Continent for so many years was killed in one blow.

Regretfully, the primal chaos bead had returned to silence once more. No matter how Long Chen tried to commune with it, it ignored him.

Ever since he had obtained the primal chaos bead, he had only been able to control the space inside of it. He couldn’t actually use it to attack. However, he knew that when it was provoked, it would automatically strike back.

This time, his gamble had paid off. Long Chen knew that his luck was rotten, but bad luck didn’t matter in front of absolute power. The primal chaos bead had instantly wiped out the Heaven Devastating Bracelet. It could only be said that the two were not on the same level.

Long Chen knew that the most terrifying existence on him was the primal chaos bead. Regretfully, he had no idea how to use it.

However, just using it to destroy the Heaven Devastating Bracelet already satisfied him. It had saved the Martial Heaven Continent and returned its energy.

At this moment, starlight appeared around Long Chen. The Heaven Devastating Bracelet’s energy poured into him at an unimaginable rate.

While Long Chen was cultivating, a rain of light fell within the barrier. This was the rain of the Heavenly Daos, and it allowed people to quickly comprehend the Heavenly Daos and make breakthroughs.

It was the Martial Heaven Continent’s will. Since Long Chen no longer needed her help, she passed this energy to the Martial Heaven Continent’s experts.

She was the heart of the continent and its will. She was the highest law of the continent.

Hence, with her help, countless experts made breakthroughs. With every breath, countless people advanced. Those at the lower realms in particular were making consecutive breakthroughs.

Those in the early Heaven Merging realm made three breakthroughs in just an incense stick’s worth of time, reaching the mid Heaven Merging realm.

The Dragonblood warriors’ auras also rapidly climbed. They seemed on the verge of advancing to the tenth Heavenstage. Upon seeing this, the invaders’ expressions all changed.

At this moment, they assaulted the barrier with all their power, causing it to shake intensely. Its defensive power had fallen.

“We can’t continue like this. If this matter is delayed, all of us will be killed,” said the Undying race’s Gui Si.

Ye Ming was attacking the barrier with all his power. He was the only one who had become a Sovereign. But even he was unable to break this barrier in a short time.

Ye Ming was infuriated. Even as a Sovereign, he still faced consecutive setbacks and defeats. He had barely managed to suppress Long Chen before Sovereign Yun Shang appeared, and the latter had actually viewed him as nothing.

“Then what can we do?!” roared Ye Ming.

“There is no other way. Carry out the blood sacrifice!” said the Blood race’s Emperor. Upon hearing this, the others’ expressions changed, but they nodded.

Very quickly, countless lifeforms came pouring out of the entrances to Devil Spirit Mountain, the Yin Yang World, the Ancient Battlefield, and the Corrupt God Cemetery.

The lifeforms of the devil race, Blood race, demonic beast race, and Undying race were thrown out like beasts of burden. They all had low cultivation bases.

They had just come onto the continent when various attacks fell, blasting them apart. Their blood dyed the ground.
