Chapter 4019 Lightning Sea Sacrificial Altar

Long Chen and the others’ hearts clenched. If they were noticed in this state, wouldn’t they be instantly caught like a fish in a net?

However, Weng Taibei simply looked at the pillar of lightning and didn’t move. Instead, he took out a formation disc.

“Empire lord, how much longer?” asked an elder beside Weng Taibei. This person was the elder that had accompanied Weng Tianyao to the Vermilion Bird Empire. In other words, it was Weng Tianyao’s master.

“The lightning pillar’s color has deepened. Things are progressing well. In at most seven days, we can awaken the immemorial lightning beast,” said Weng Taibei.

Long Chen and the others instantly relaxed when they heard this. It was fine as long as they weren’t noticed.

However, with Weng Taibei staring so intently at the lightning pillar, they didn’t dare to move. They just had Lei Linger maintain their disguise.

“Hmph, once the immemorial lightning beast comes out, who will dare to fight us? After so many years of offerings, the immemorial lightning beast can definitely rival the immemorial Vermilion Bird. When all eight empires bring out their immemorial divine beasts, no matter how powerful the Vermilion Bird is, it still won’t be a match for all of them. There’s simply no doubt to the Vermilion Bird Empire’s destruction,” said Weng Tianyao’s master darkly.

“However, we cannot be careless. Yu Xiaoyun is just an idiot that we don’t need to consider, but his two empresses are crafty and cunning. They’re not so easy to deal with. How are things going over there?” asked Weng Taibei.

“Everything is under control. The Vermilion Bird Empire has long since lost their sharpness. Over the past few years, their focus on martial arts declined, and their interior is a mess right now. Also, a portion of their people are on our side, while another portion is just waiting and watching. Our arrangements throughout the Vermilion Bird Empire are essentially complete. We are prepared for everything and just have to take this final step.”

Long Chen’s heart shook. Yet another grand plot, but he still didn’t know what this plot was.

“Good. In any case, just don’t be careless,” said Weng Taibei.

“Empire lord, we have steadily seized victory. Why are you so cautious?” asked the elder. Weng Taibei seemed particularly careful this time, as if he didn’t dare to have anything go the slightest bit off.

Weng Taibei stared at the lightning whirlpool for a long time before finally saying, “I don’t know. I keep feeling a bit uneasy, as if some great tribulation is about to descend.”

“Empire lord, you’re worrying for nothing. Perhaps if our Violet Thunderclap Empire were to challenge the Vermilion Bird Empire alone, we wouldn’t know who would win. But with all eight empires joining forces against them, they have no chance. Those empires also know what the consequences of failure are, so they’ll definitely bring out their full power. Furthermore, we have so many backup plans. The Vermilion Bird Empire’s destruction is set in stone,” said the elder.

“I know. However, for some reason, I still feel worried. In any case, we have no other stuff to do at this point. Being careful is nothing bad. Go take a look at the situation in the other empires. You must keep up a tense atmosphere, or they’ll start skimping. There can be no slip-ups at this point,” ordered Weng Taibei.

“Yes!”

The elder assented and left, but he had a slightly odd expression. He felt like Weng Taibei was overthinking things.

For the eight empires to join forces against the Vermilion Bird Empire, there shouldn’t be any suspense at all. If they were too cautious, the other empires might secretly look down on the Violet Thunderclap Empire.

It had to be known that the Violet Thunderclap Empire displayed an even greater force than the Vermilion Bird Empire on the surface. Thus, for Weng Taibei to be so cautious showed that even after joining forces with the other empires, the Violet Thunderclap Empire was still afraid of the Vermilion Bird Empire.

It had to be known that the reason the other seven empires dared to cause trouble for the Vermilion Bird Empire was entirely because of the backing of the Violet Thunderclap Empire. They all thought that the Violet Thunderclap Empire was stronger than the Vermilion Bird Empire.

What Weng Taibei didn’t know was that this mission he had entrusted to Weng Tianyao’s master was treated as nothing. This elder only took a stroll through the other empires.

At this moment, Weng Taibei stood in the air, personally overseeing things here. When his full attention was no longer focused on the lightning pillar, Lei Linger continued to control the thunderforce and send the flying boat down the stream of lightning.

The flying boat finally reached the ground where an underground palace resided. There was a giant space here, practically as large as the imperial city.VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

At the core of this space was a giant sacrificial altar with a sword and bell floating beside it. Two empty spots could also be seen there.

Clearly, this spot was jointly controlled by four divine weapons. Two of them had been taken by Lei Linger, leaving only behind the sword and bell.

Endless lightning filled this space, forming a giant sea of lightning with the altar as its center.

On the altar, a sphere of lightning contained a curled-up beast that emitted an immemorial aura.

This beast looked to be some kind of lizard, and its scales were flickering with runes, emitting heaven-shaking power. Even through the lightning sphere, everyone could sense its terrifying power.

“It seems that this is the immemorial lightning beast.”

Long Chen was delighted to see it, while Yu Qingxuan and the others were not. This was an existence comparable to the immemorial Vermilion Bird, and the Violet Thunderclap Empire was planning on using it to deal with them.

Furthermore, from what they had heard, the eight empires actually planned to use all their trump cards at once, destroying the Vermilion Bird Empire in one go. They apparently possessed more than one such beast.

Originally, they had been preparing to show their power after coming out of the Vermilion Bird’s trial by fire. However, this one beast was like a bucket of cold water over their heads. Now, they felt a chill from the top of their heads to the tips of their toes.

An existence like this was not something that they could fight, causing their high spirits to instantly vanish.

“Lei Linger, what do you think?” asked Long Chen.

Lei Linger eyed the immemorial lightning beast greedily. After that, she formed some hand seals, and the four divine weapon images on her palm constantly revolved. It seemed that she was calculating something.

“Big brother Long Chen, give me some time! I can consume it!” declared Lei Linger.

“Weng Taibei said that it would be done in seven days. Can you do it?”

“Seven days should be enough. Leave it to me!” After saying that, Lei Linger transformed into a lightning dragon and slowly merged into the lightning sea, stealthily getting close to that beast.

While Lei Linger dealt with the immemorial lightning beast, Long Chen had the flying boat follow the guidance of the Wild Blade and the lightning tower to a gate beneath the sea of lightning.

The gate slowly opened. When they saw what was inside, Yu Qingxuan and the others let out startled cries, while Long Chen’s eyes glowed.

“We’ve struck gold!”
