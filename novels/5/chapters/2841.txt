Chapter 2830 God Institute’s Elite Group

Long Chen pointed his sword at Ming Ze, and an invisible mental pressure suddenly locked down on him, causing Ming Ze’s hair to stand on end.

This mental pressure was not related to Spiritual Strength. It was a kind of will, a determination to kill. This will of Long Chen’s had been tempered through endless slaughter.

Ming Ze had never experienced such a bloody battle in all his life. Hence, all his terror was dragged out of his heart by this pressure.

Although he tried to suppress it, his face turned white. The terror in his eyes was not concealed in the slightest; everyone could see it.

An Earth Master was actually terrified? The disciples were in an uproar. Just what kind of past did Long Chen have? Why was he so terrifying? Was he really a newcomer?

Heaven Master Yun Yang said, “Instructor Long Chen, since you’ve accepted the badge, your current status is that of an instructor. Although instructors can privately settle their disputes, such an extreme battle must go through an inquiry, and the institute head must approve of it. This direct challenge of yours can be declined by instructor Ming Ze. Furthermore, a life and death match requires irreconcilable enmity between the two sides. Your actions are not in accordance with the rules.”

Hearing this, Ming Ze instantly relaxed, and a giant weight fell from his shoulders. However, he still said, “Long Chen, since you’re a youth, I won’t quibble with you over your impetuous nature. Did you really think that I am afraid of a little fellow whose mortal qi has yet to regress? In the God Institute, all things are in accordance with the rules, especially for instructors. You must be an example, but who would follow the lead of someone as childish as you? How laughable.”

He said these things in order to save a bit of face. However, by saying this, he had accidentally told everyone that he was afraid.

“I, Long Chen, came to the High Firmament Academy to cultivate. I have many important things to do, and I don’t have time to waste being stalled by idiots like you. I don’t care if you have fights and competition with others, nor do I feel like interfering in your childish games. But anyone who blocks my cultivation is my enemy. Your foolishness can cost me my life in the future, so I will pay any price to eliminate you. Luckily, your life is spared this time, but that doesn’t mean you’ll be as lucky next time,” said Long Chen icily.

“How brazen! You…” Ming Ze roared furiously, but this anger was nothing more than an act. He had to at least appear tough in front of everyone.

“Let us end this topic here. As instructors, every one of your actions can influence the futures of our disciples. Take note of your words and actions. Make sure you live up to your status as instructors,” said Heaven Master Yun Yang. He didn’t want their conflict to grow any further. To Long Chen, he said, “Wearing our robes is the rule of the God Institute. It cannot be changed easily. Otherwise, without rules, the entire academy would be thrown into chaos. However, rules are dead. People can change them. But whether or not they can be changed depends on the person’s power. Long Chen, you are the person with the greatest potential that I’ve ever seen. As a Heaven Master, I don’t wish for such a talent to leave. That would be a loss to the God Institute.”

“Next you’ll be saying, however, right?” Long Chen smiled.

Heaven Master Yun Yang smiled and nodded. “However, rules are rules. They can’t be changed randomly. If you want an exception, I can give you a chance. If you grasp this chance, you can maintain your style.”

“Heaven Master!” Ming Ze and the others immediately shot up to indicate that they did not approve. If this backdoor was opened, wouldn’t the God Institute be thrown into chaos? If the instructors were all given special treatments, how would they control the disciples? Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

Heaven Master Yun Yang waved his hand, indicating for them to quiet down. He continued, “Instructor Ming Ze has a group of elites under his administration. They are famous even within the entire academy…”

All the instructors looked at Ming Ze oddly when they heard this. As for Ming Ze, his face was like that of a pig.

“Heaven Master, I…” Ming Ze tried to explain, but Heaven Master Yun Yang interrupted him.

“This Elite Group is composed of the elites from various regions. They’ve been in the God Institute for over a year now, but their rate of advancement is only barely passable. This Elite Group has thirty-six people. If you can lead ten of those people into the Human tier divine rankings within one month, I will help you resolve your issue.”

At this moment, Long Chen clearly saw Ming Ze’s relaxed smile. That smile said everything.

“It seems that this is not an easy task,” said Long Chen.

Heaven Master Yun Yang nodded. “Of course. If you wish to change a tradition stretching back tens of thousands of years, how can it be so easy? Otherwise, if the institute head blames me, I would be in trouble.”

“Alright. I’ll try it,” said Long Chen.

“If you agree to this, you cannot renege.” Heaven Master Yun Yang shook his head. “This is not a game. This relates to the prestige of the rules of the God Institute. If you accept and win, you can change the rules. If you fail, you will receive the punishment of the rules. You cannot just say you refuse to do it and leave. Otherwise, there would be no need for me to risk being punished by the institute head to give you this chance. I’ve brought out the God Institute’s sincerity. Don’t you think you should bring out your sincerity as well?”

“How old are these people? How is their aptitude? Their cultivation bases?” asked Long Chen. He was no fool. This task was definitely at a heaven-defying level of difficulty, or Ming Ze wouldn’t be smiling so pleased.

“They are all very young. They were accepted last year, and their talent is all above average. Their cultivation bases are in the late Mortal Transcendence realm.”

“It’s already been a year, but they remain in the late Mortal Transcendence realm. You wouldn’t be asking me to teach a group of pigs, would you?” asked Long Chen.

Heaven Master Yun Yang laughed. “Of course not. However, these disciples all have certain backgrounds. They are all lazy. Despite not being strong themselves, they are quite temperamental. They are only here as gilding for the academy. In another month, that gilding period ends, and they will leave. In many people’s eyes, they are a group of people that cannot be saved. If you can lead a portion of them into the divine rankings, I will resolve your problem. Furthermore, if you succeed, I will ask the institute head to give you greater privileges. As long as you have the ability, you can do anything. The God Institute always views people with talent favorably. But the precondition is that your talent must be enough to draw the attention of the institute head.”

“They’re lazy and temperamental? Haha, I just so happen to be an expert at curing such illnesses. I accept this task.”

Long Chen smiled. He knew that this was an incredibly rare opportunity for him.

“Show me what students are so hard to teach. If they refuse to grow, I’ll just break them down and rebuild them into something new.” There was the slightest cruel glimmer in Long Chen’s eyes at this moment.
