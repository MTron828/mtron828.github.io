Chapter 3528

“Sorry, I’ve killed countless lifeforms in my lifetime, especially those from the devil race. I really can’t remember them all. Which race are you looking to avenge? I feel like it’s very funny. Whether it’s in the mortal world or the immortal world, it’s your devil race that attacked my human race countless times. If someone should be looking for revenge, it should be me!” said Long Chen indifferently, looking at that Immemorial Flame Devil.

“This lord will give you a chance to fight. Have a one-against-one fight against this lord to decide your life and death,” said that Immemorial Flame Devil icily.

“I don’t mind. As long as you want to die, you can pick the time and place. I will fulfill your wish.” Long Chen shrugged.

His enmity with the devil race was carved into his bones. On the Martial Heaven Continent, he had witnessed countless innocent humans being slaughtered by the devil race. Those scenes could never be erased from his mind.

“Unacceptable!”

Unexpectedly, Zhao Mingxuan actually spoke up for Long Chen.

“Long Chen’s life is mine. I don’t care what race you’re from, it means nothing in front of me.”

“You don’t care about your life, is that it?” That Immemorial Flame Devil turned to Zhao MIngxuan, the golden light in his erupting. He seemed like he might attack at any moment.

“There’s no need to argue here. Whatever enmities you have can be settled inside of the Heavenly Flame World, no? What’s the point of arguing when you can’t even fight here?”

Another lifeform spoke. This was a greater demon with an astonishing Blood Qi, and it was also a terrifying existence.

“There really is no need. Fighting here is just showing off in front of others. After a little scuffle, both sides spit out some harsh words, and that’s it? What’s the point? Let us wait until we enter the Heavenly Flame World before people start throwing around words of life and death. We can just see who is laughing in the end,” sneered someone else.

This place did not just have heavenly geniuses. Their various protectors were also here, and it was unknown how many World Kings were hidden among them.

If something unexpected happened here, they would definitely interfere to protect their own race’s disciples.

If the other side was too powerful, they would just activate a transportation talisman. Then the old fellows of those major forces would also appear.

Such a sight often occurred in past descents of the Heavenly Flame World. When those old monsters appeared, all they did was spit words at each other without actually fighting. That was because all sides were restrained by everyone. They wouldn’t really fight.

However, once they entered the Heavenly Flame World, it would be different. The outer region did permit World Kings to enter, but the deeper area was restricted by laws that only allowed Divine Lords to enter.

The Heavenly Flame Spirits only appeared in the depths, so that was where the real fighting would occur. With no World Kings to interfere, life and death would be decided by each individual’s true power.

Furthermore, the depths of the Heavenly Flame World did not just have terrifying flame spirits that would cause carnage. The most terrifying thing was the fellow members of the same race who would kill each other just to get an advantage.

Thus, the only person you could trust once you entered the Heavenly Flame World was yourself. That was a true lawless world.

Although the heavenly geniuses here were all Divine Lords, not all of them were youngsters. Some of them were old monsters that had been sealed for many years. They also knew that there was no way a fight would occur here, so they couldn’t even bother to pay attention to this argument.

Hearing that, the Immemorial Flame Devil sneered, “Fine. I’ll settle things with you in the Heavenly Flame World.”

This sneer was not just for Long Chen but also the entire human race.

“Brother, if you need any help, just say the word.”

Suddenly, a large figure walked toward Long Chen. What shocked everyone was that it was an expert of the Lava Giant race.

The Lava Giant race was also a spirit race, and he actually stood by Long Chen’s side. It had to be known that the Lava Giant race was an enormous race, and they were very protective of their own people. They weren’t easy to provoke.

“Many thanks. But I feel like I can handle my own matters. I appreciate your kind intentions.” Long Chen cupped his fists.

“No need to thank me. My Lava Giant race is also a member of the Stone Spirit race. You’ve helped the Stone Spirit race before, so you are a kind person. I am willing to help you,” said the Lava Giant.

Long Chen was startled. He suddenly thought of the Heaven Merging Stone Spirit race’s expert that he had released. Long Chen had even given him a name, Shi Tongtian.

He hadn’t expected the Lava Giant race to also be a part of the same race as the Heaven Merging Stone Spirit race. Furthermore, this Lava Giant could actually tell that Long Chen had helped one of his people before. But Long Chen didn’t want him to be drawn into his personal grievance.

That was because just now, Long Chen had noticed quite a few races glaring at him with killing intent. They were unwilling to show their true selves at the moment, and it wasn’t just the devil race. There was the Blood race, the Nether race, and others.

In other words, he would be attacked from all sides once he entered the Heavenly Flame World. Although this expert’s aura was very terrifying, Long Chen didn’t wish for him to be affected.

That Lava Giant was quite stubborn though, directly saying that anyone who wanted to make things hard for Long Chen would have to face him first.

That gave quite a few people a sense of pressure. The Lava Giant race was not an existence that they wished to provoke. Their race was spread throughout the nine heavens and ten lands, and they were also very united. If one was provoked, the rest would also be provoked. The wrath of the Lava Giant race wasn’t something that just anyone could endure.

Yu Qingxuan smiled when she saw the Lava Giant race stand by Long Chen. That proved that he was a good person. He had helped many people.

Long Chen helplessly thanked the Lava Giant. He then walked toward the Heavenly Flame World’s gates alongside Yu Qingxuan.

The closest space next to the gates had long since been occupied. But slightly further away, there were still some empty spots.

However, if you wished to reach those spots, you had to pass through the encirclement of people. The two of them had just started walking through when someone blocked their way.

“Sorry, but I will only permit fairy Qingxuan to pass. I won’t let a murderous villain who kills people for their treasures to pass.”

This was a ninth Heavenstage Divine Lord, and he looked at Long Chen with obvious loathing and disdain.

Seeing this, Yu Qingxuan was enraged. These people were actually labeling Long Chen as such a villain just because of some words from the Soaring Dragon Company. It was absolutely vile.

Long Chen couldn’t help sighing and shaking his head.

Seeing him sigh and shake his head, that person sneered, “Do you not know what you’ve done? By standing beside fairy Qingxuan, it is like you are placing a turd beside a beautiful flower. If I wasn’t afraid of blaspheming a fairy, I would wring off your head long ago.”

That person’s expression grew sinister. His eyes were full of hatred and envy.

“Don’t force me.” Long Chen once more shook his head.

“So what if I force you? I am the Amethyst Firmament Gate’s-”

Immediately, Long Chen’s hand reached out like a bolt of lightning toward that person’s neck.

Just as Long Chen’s hand was about to touch his neck, that person sneered sinisterly.

All of a sudden, two strange snakes appeared on his shoulders, biting down on Long Chen’s wrist.
