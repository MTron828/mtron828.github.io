Chapter 3566

Nine Underworld Island. It wasn’t within the Chaotic Star Sea. Instead, it was located in a neighboring star-field. Based on direct line distance, it actually wasn’t far.

However, the Chaotic Star Sea had chaos domains that were filled with countless uncrossable spatial cracks.

Coming from the outside, there was only one way into the Chaotic Star Sea. From anywhere else, you would be forced to make a long detour. This also made it so that the news inside the Chaotic Star Sea was isolated. News from the outside world took a while to enter, and news from inside took a certain amount of time to spread to the outside world.

Although Long Chen had shaken the Dragon Blaze Prefecture, for it to spread to the outside world would take a bit of time.

BOOM!

A formation shattered. A metallic case of treasures was taken away by Long Chen.

“Long Chen, you goddamn bastard, you won’t have a good death!”

A mid stage World King cursed at Long Chen, his eyes green with fury.

However. Long Chen ignored that person’s fury. In front of the fury of countless experts of the Soaring Dragon Company, he chose to simply ignore it. He was already used to this sight.

In the Chaotic Star Sea, this was the seventh treasury of the Soaring Dragon Company that he had plundered. To use Long Chen’s words, bandits never leave empty-handed. If he was going to leave, he had to at least get some travel expenses.

Furthermore, in order to prevent the Soaring Dragon Company from transporting too many of their treasures away, he plundered over ten strongholds overnight. After plundering them, he broke their transportation formations and communication systems, making it so that they couldn’t warn the others.

When the treasury entered the primal chaos space, Long Chen smiled. Robbing others really was the fastest way to get rich.

Perhaps the higher-ups were still discussing how to deal with him. Perhaps they didn’t think that he would attack them again so quickly. In any case, Long Chen caught them unprepared.

Even the strongest experts in these strongholds were merely mid stage World Kings. Such a figure couldn’t even summon the courage to attack Long Chen. Hence, they only cursed at him, watching as this bandit sucked their treasury into his pocket.

“Cursing people is wrong. Businessmen should live off of the principle that amiability makes you rich. With this kind of attitude, do you think that I’ll conduct business with you next time? Let me tell you, if you don’t change this attitude, I won’t come even if you ask me to,” advised Long Chen kindheartedly.

“You… you… you are absolutely shameless…”

That elder was so enraged that he almost coughed up blood. After snatching their things, this bandit said amiability made you rich? In all his years, the elder had never seen someone so shameless.

“Alright, don’t be mad. I’m sure if you work on yourself, with your talent and aptitude, through hard work, you can quickly accumulate more wealth. I’ll leave for now, but don’t worry, as long as I have time, I’ll definitely be back!” Long Chen laughed and waved goodbye to them as if they were old friends that he was unwilling to part with each other.

“Go kill yourself! Never come back!”

The Soaring Dragon Company’s experts cursed Long Chen furiously. Regretfully, Long Chen had long since vanished.

Looking at their stronghold that was completely wrecked, these experts almost cried. They could only clean up the wreckage as they thought of a way to inform the higher-ups.

In the surroundings, countless experts had seen everything and felt absolute admiration for Long Chen. Some even sneered at the Soaring Dragon Company’s misfortune because their reputation really was no good.

Long Chen plundered seventeen treasuries before sitting on a transportation formation. After multiple transportations, he appeared in the ferry land of the star-field.

Just like that, he swaggered onto a flying boat. When Long Chen stepped on, countless experts shouted in shock, recognizing him.

Long Chen’s bounty had long since spread throughout the entire Chaotic Star Sea. Hence, countless people had wanted to use his head to exchange for wealth.

However, then the news of Long Chen’s battle in the Dragon Blaze Prefecture spread throughout the Chaotic Star Sea. Now, most people knew just how terrifying he was.

What kind of joke was that? The existence called the strongest flame in the nine heavens and ten lands had been killed by Long Chen, and even late stage World Kings had been slain in droves by him. With two Divine Venerates supporting him, who would dare to provoke him?

Even if you counted those two Divine Venerates out, just with Long Chen’s own power, who dared to even think about touching him? Were they that tired of living?

Long Chen stepped onto the flying boat and found that it wasn’t even half full. But the boat directly set out.

Originally, if the boat wasn’t full, they wouldn’t set off. They would wait, usually ten to fifteen days, for there to be enough people to move out.

Clearly, the ones operating the flying boat wanted to hurry up and send off this demon that was Long Chen, afraid that some other experts might chase him here and start a battle. Then they would all be doomed.

The one in charge of maintaining order on this ship was originally an early stage World King. But when Long Chen appeared, they were immediately switched with a late stage World King.

That World King immediately greeted Long Chen ardently, a very warm smile on his face. He was quite smart, subtly expressing that even if they had to lose money, they would send Long Chen away.

However, if the worst-case scenario did occur, then they hoped Long Chen would have mercy. After all, they were a small business and couldn’t endure such a loss. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

Long Chen instantly understood. They were afraid that people from this side would chase after him and start a fight, as well as afraid that once he arrived on the other side, his enemies would be waiting for him.

If they had to fight, Long Chen shouldn’t implicate them. They should find a more secluded place to fight.

A grand late stage World King was practically begging him, so Long Chen naturally couldn’t make things hard on these people. If his enemies really did come find him, he wouldn’t implicate them.

However, Long Chen also didn’t mistreat this World King elder and directly gave him a jug of fine wine. This elder was a water element cultivator, and this wine was made by a mighty water cultivator in the Wine God Palace. Seeing this wine, the elder repeatedly thanked Long Chen.

Just as he thought that he was about to lose out on some money, he was given such a gift. It had to be known that the Wine God Palace’s wine was not something that could be bought no matter how much money you had.

Furthermore, this elder had been stuck at the seventh Heavenstage for countless years. But with this wine, he felt like he could break free from his shackles. He was filled with gratitude toward Long Chen. No one had ever sent him such a precious thing before.

“Senior, do you know how to get to the Hongying Star-Field?” asked Long Chen.

“You want to go to the Hongying Star-Field?” The elder was surprised.

Long Chen actually wasn’t going to the Hongying Star-Field. He wanted to go to the Nine Underworld Island. However, he was asking this question in front of everyone to mislead his enemies. Who knew whether or not his enemies’ eyes were also within this ship?

“Yes.” Long Chen nodded.

“I’d advise you not to go. Hongying Star-Field is also called the Alldevil Star-Field. In the past few years, the Alldevil race started a war with the human race inside, and I heard that the situation is very precarious. The spatial channels have all crumbled, so those above the Immortal King realm are unable to pass through the chaotic flow of space there. It’s a land of death,” said the elder.

“The Alldevil Star-Field?”

Now it was Long Chen’s turn to be surprised. A name popped up in his mind. Xie Qianqian.
