Chapter 3755 He Pushed Me

BOOM!

A giant serpent mouth crashed down on the earth, leaving a giant hole in the ground. However, people clearly saw Li Chenggang smile coldly right before then. A rune appeared in both of his hands. When he pressed these two runes against each other, his figure vanished.

As Li Chenggang had escaped, the giant winged serpent only spat out mud. His attack was still one step too slow.

Everyone was shocked to find that the six wings on his back were completely destroyed. Blood still dripped out of them. Li Chenggang’s attack had clearly caused him a significant wound.

It had to be known that the Six Wing Soaring Serpent’s wings were the most important parts of their body. Many of their divine abilities were unleashed through their wings, so such an important part had to be very powerful.

However, even that powerful part was shattered by Li Chenggang. It could be seen just how terrifying his power was.

“No wonder the four immemorial sects are high and aloof existences that cannot be provoked. The legends aren’t for nothing.” Although it was just a few short exchanges, this brief fight between Li Chenggang and the Divine Venerate truly shook people.

This demonic beast Divine Venerate had almost been killed by Li Chenggang at the start due to his carelessness. Furthermore, even after he managed to enter his full-power state, Li Chenggang could still block one of his attacks and injure him with one blow. That was truly stunning.

Although that one block and attack exhausted Li Chenggang already, forcing him to flee, it had to be said that Li Chenggang truly did possess some fighting power against a Divine Venerate.

People looked at Long Chen in the distance and suddenly had a thought. If Long Chen had joined forces with Li Chenggang from the start, perhaps they really could have killed this demonic beast.

Li Chenggang was incredibly powerful, but his power still wasn’t enough to go against a true Divine Venerate. Today, people had witnessed his power, as well as the almighty absolute power of a Divine Venerate.

At this moment, the demonic beast returned to human form. He was covered in blood. It was a wretched sight.

His ominous gaze suddenly targeted Long Chen. Long Chen also looked back at him. He sneered. 

“What, you want to cast your anger on me? If you really want to die so badly, I’ll help you out. In your current state, there’s a seventy percent chance that I can kill you relying on my own power. Do you want to test it?”

The demonic beast’s six wings had been shattered. He was unable to heal in the short term. Thus, his current power was at most seventy percent of his peak, or perhaps even lower.

Long Chen had his own pride. Li Chenggang had fought this expert in his peak state, so Long Chen didn’t want to take advantage of his opponent’s weakness.

That demonic beast’s heart quivered. His rationality grappled with his fury.

Right now, if he were to fight Long Chen and lose, it would be embarrassing. If he fought and won, he still wouldn’t dare to push him too far because he was afraid of drawing out Bing Po again. In the end, he snorted and returned to the city.

Long Chen remained indifferent. It was as if everything was within expectations, and he brought Jiang Lei into the city. The ruckus caused by Li Chenggang slowly settled.

Long Chen and Jiang Lei entered the city. Long Chen wanted to get a decent weapon for Jiang Lei, but lightning attribute weapons were too rare. It was very difficult to buy any.

Suddenly, Long Chen spouted a group of people in the crowd. His eyes brightened and he walked toward them.

It was a group of seven experts. Their leader was a Supreme heavenly genius with lightning runes revolving around him. He was a rarely-seen lightning cultivator with astonishing Blood Qi. However, he was a demonic beast.

This demonic beast had just entered the city. He had an arrogant indifference on his face and looked down on the people around him.

Long Chen and Jiang Lei then walked over, just happening to end up crashing into him.

“Scram!”

That Supreme expert directly pushed Long Chen aside.

Pow!

In return, Long Chen slapped him in the face. “Who do you think you are to act arrogant in front of Boss Long San?”

This group of people was actually quite blind. They actually didn’t notice that wherever Long Chen went, others fled.

They thought that these people were fleeing due to them. Hence, Long Chen’s slap caused countless people to cry out in shock. No one had expected Long Chen to dare to start a fight within the city. This wasn’t just a simple fight but a slap in the face of the city lord. However, the next scene caused their eyes to bulge out of their heads.

Long Chen had just slapped him when Jiang Lei’s sword swung out, directly cutting off his head.

As a result, that person’s headless corpse fell and his spiritual fluctuations vanished. He was killed just like that. They overtly killed a Supreme heavenly genius right within the city. Seeing this, countless people fled for their lives. They knew that something terrifying was about to occur.

“Long Chen, you have gone too far!”

The demonic beast Divine Venerate once more appeared, erupting with killing intent. Flames almost burst out of his eyes.

Although he was no friend or foe of Long Chen’s, for Long Chen to kill someone from the demonic beast race was clearly a challenge to his bottom line.

“Long Chen, why did you kill someone on the streets?” The other human Divine Venerates were also ashen. If he had to kill people, why couldn’t he leave the city first? To kill people here, was he not slapping them in the face?

“He pushed me.” Long Chen pointed at the corpse innocently.

“You…!”

The demonic beast was purple with rage. “This is your reason for killing him?!”

Long Chen sneered, “Does there need to be a reason for killing someone? How many times have you attacked the human race? How many times have you plundered us? How many of our lives have you reaped? Do you have a reason? I’ve given you my reason. If you don’t like it, we can fight right here and now. In order to heal your wings, your Blood Qi energy is at its weakest. You can’t even unleash fifty percent of your combat power now. I can kill you without the slightest effort. Do you want to try it?”

The demonic beast Divine Venerate was shocked, as well as enraged. Just as Long Chen said, he was currently focusing all of his Blood Qi on repairing his wings. He was in a very awkward state now. If he attacked Long Chen now, he really wouldn’t have the slightest confidence. That was ignoring the still hidden Bing Po.

“Your human race wishes to declare war on my demonic beast race?!” The demonic beast Divine Venerate turned to the human Divine Venerates.

Those human experts cursed inside. Since he didn’t dare to face Long Chen, he just had to use them as the villains?

“This matter is your personal grievance. It has nothing to do with my Seven Star City.” One of the human Divine Venerates shook his head. Ever since Li Chenggang had said that Long Chen was the dean of the High Firmament Academy, this Divine Venerate was restrained by his fear of him. He wouldn’t provoke Long Chen for nothing.

“You…!”

The demonic beast’s expression sank. He was in a weak state right now, and it wasn’t as if he could really fight. Hearing this, he almost coughed up blood from rage. 

Long Chen glanced at Jiang Lei. Jiang Lei immediately understood and walked over to the corpse. He bowed toward it.

“You were an opponent worthy of respect. In order to express my respect for you, I won’t let your headless corpse rot on the street. I’ll find a good place for you to rest.”

Then, in front of everyone, Jiang Lei magnanimously gathered the corpse, along with the sword on his back that was flickering with lightning.

Upon seeing that, countless people had expressions of realization appear on their faces. It seemed that Long Chen had set his gaze on this expert’s weapon, so he had directly killed him.𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“You… just wait!”

The demonic beast Divine Venerate’s expression twisted with fury, but he was helpless. Flames almost burst out of his eyes. This was a huge insult to him and the entire demonic beast race.

“Let’s go!”

Long Chen ignored him. Together with Jiang Lei, they walked onto the transportation formation. Seeing that he was leaving, countless human experts sighed with relief. This demon of pestilence was finally leaving. They didn’t even ask him for the transportation fee. They only asked him where he wanted to go and directly sent him there.

Just after Long Chen and Jiang Lei left, divine light covered the sky. The entire Seven Star City was locked down, shocking everyone present.
