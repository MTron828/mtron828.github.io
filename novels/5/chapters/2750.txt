Chapter 2739 Profiting From Disaster

“Are you going to speak?!” roared the Heaven Executioner. His patience was gone. Long Chen had too many secrets on him. Hence, even now, the divine families refused to give up.

However, the only one capable of making Long Chen open his mouth was the Heaven Executioner, and even he had failed. If he had failed, then there was no point in others even trying.

As a result, the divine families had given the Heaven Executioner the order to try one final push, and if it still failed, all they could do was kill Long Chen.

Although Long Chen was caught and trapped here, just the idea of him living made them uneasy.

“Back then, you crippled my Dantian, but I still managed to grow to this level. Do you feel like there’s any chance that I’ll submit to you?” sneered Long Chen.

“Then I’ll just cripple you once more!” The Heaven Executioner furiously unleashed a palm on Long Chen’s Dantian.

“Primal chaos bead, someone’s attacking you. You better kill him!” Long Chen prayed inside. He had successfully baited the Heaven Executioner into attacking his Dantian.

BOOM!

Long Chen’s Dantian rumbled. The primal chaos bead didn’t react, but his 108,000 stars appeared.

“Not good!” Long Chen’s expression changed.

“You have this many astral spaces?” The Heaven Executioner was surprised. A star diagram had appeared within Long Chen’s Dantian and manifested before him.

“Eastern Wasteland Bell, what are you doing?! I can’t stall any longer!” roared Long Chen inside. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

“Close! Just the final step remains!” responded the Eastern Wasteland Bell, also at a critical juncture.

Unfortunately, both of them were at critical junctures. If the Eastern Wasteland Bell came over now, everything would be for naught.

Long Chen had the most difficult choice in front of him. He glared at the Heaven Executioner, and the Heaven Executioner smiled sinisterly. “No wonder you have so much power. So your cultivation path is different from everyone else’s. A total of 108,000 astral spaces. It really is hard to imagine. Just how strong is your world energy? Fortunately, you didn’t get to continue growing. With this kind of foundation, even just reaching the Emperor realm might be enough for you to be completely unrivaled. How unfortunate for you that this is your fate. You were fated to die to my hands. Whether it was when you were first born or today, you never managed to escape my grasp. You have so many stars. Crushing them one by one sounds like a fun idea. I’ll try it.”

The Heaven Executioner finally saw some hope of success, so he smiled excitedly. Long Chen’s furious gaze only stimulated him.

Long Chen clenched his fists. Strike back or endure? If the Eastern Wasteland Bell couldn’t fully recover, it wouldn’t be able to handle the Heaven Devastating Bracelet. The Eastern Wasteland Bell had told him that the Heaven Devastating Bracelet was their most terrifying enemy. If they couldn’t deal with it, the Martial Heaven Continent would be destroyed no matter what.

However, if he endured, his stars would be destroyed. That would affect the power of the Nine Star Hegemon Body Art, and he might even be crippled. Long Chen was caught in a painful dilemma.

BOOM!

Just as Long Chen was hesitating, the Heaven Executioner formed a hand seal. A hand appeared within the star map in Long Chen’s body, grabbing one of the stars and crushing it.

The star exploded, causing Long Chen to let out a furious roar. This was a humiliation, and a wave of anger that he could not suppress exploded out of him. His killing intent condensed into a solid form.

“Hehe, good, now it’s interesting. You refused to make a sound before. A wooden log isn’t interesting. Scream some more…” The Heaven Executioner grew more excited seeing this reaction.

However, just as he was pleased by this, a majestic energy surged out of Long Chen’s Dantian. In that instant, space and time seemed to freeze. The Heaven Executioner was shocked to find that he couldn’t move.

Most terrifying of all, the power of heaven and earth had vanished along with the laws of the Heavenly Daos. He couldn’t sense any Heavenly Dao energy.

“What…?!”

The Heaven Executioner was terrified. He didn’t know what had happened. The power of the outside world had vanished, and even his own world energy was sealed. He had fallen from a peak expert to an ant in an instant.

Mist surged out of Long Chen’s Dantian, and the formations binding Long Chen’s body turned to dust. But no alarm rang out.

Even the destroyed formation runes were unable to spread. It was as if the world was frozen. The only thing moving was a cyclone around Long Chen’s Dantian.

“So that’s the case. It seems that I need to thank you for helping me inadvertently open the gate to the Nine Star Hegemon Body Art.”

Long Chen smiled oddly at the terrified Heaven Executioner. One of his 108,000 stars had been broken. Due to that, it created space for the rest of his 108,000 stars to start moving.

Before this, his star map was like a game board covered in pieces. Since the board was full, there was nowhere for any of the pieces to move.

However, once one piece was removed, it created space for the rest of the pieces to move.

Minutes ago, his star map was dead. Now, it was alive. His 108,000 stars began to move on their own, and as they did, endless power filled Long Chen’s body.

“Only when something is imperfect is there room to grow. Something that is perfect is dead. Because the moon wanes, it also waxes. Only by being imperfect is it possible to manifest the changes of the Dao.”

Long Chen instantly comprehended this. The enlightenment that the Sovereigns had tried to pass down to him through their experiences and techniques became clear.

Long Chen reached out and tore off the Heaven Executioner’s arm. In his hand was a violet jade pendant.

Seeing that jade pendant, Long Chen’s expression changed. The Heaven Executioner sneered, “Hehe, although I couldn’t ring the alarm, the spiritual imprint inside of my Soul Calming Jade has been erased. In other words, you are trapped in this world. It will take years for you to find the spatial node of this world. By that time, the Martial Heaven Continent will have long since been destroyed. Furthermore, when they see that the channel to this world has been shut, they’ll know what happened. They’ll destroy this entire world along with you just to ensure that you have no chance of survival. Hahaha, you can’t escape!”

Long Chen punched the Heaven Executioner’s Dantian. As a result, the Heaven Executioner coughed up a mouthful of blood, and cracks spread throughout his body. He almost exploded from this one punch from Long Chen.

“Oh, sorry. I was just trying to cripple your Dantian, but I used a bit too much power. Fortunately, you didn’t die. That would be letting you off far too easily. I’ve memorized all your techniques. Let’s switch positions and just see how tough your bones are!”

After crippling the Heaven Executioner, a rune on Long Chen’s palm lit up. The blue-haired Lei Linger appeared.

“Lei Linger, you should know what to do.”

“Big brother, don’t worry. I won’t let him die. I’ll make sure he lives a life worse than death. I’ll return double the pain he made you suffer.” Lei Linger took out a small lightning blade and stabbed it into the Heaven Executioner’s chest. The method, angle, and positioning were all the same as the Heaven Executioner’s technique.

“AHH!” The Heaven Executioner let out a miserable scream, his body quivering in pain. At this moment, Long Chen smiled. That scream was like music to his ears.

“Lei Linger, bring him with you. Let’s go find the Eastern Wasteland Bell.”

Just as Long Chen said this, the void shuddered. The Eastern Wasteland Bell appeared before him.
