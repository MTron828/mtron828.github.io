Chapter 2178 The Blood Emperor Family’s Beauty

In front of the berserk and powerful Shi Lingfeng, Guo Ran still appeared as relaxed as ever. The saber in his right hand lit up at the same time as the wings on his back. The light was brighter than the sun and quickly condensed into the saber.

Shi Lingfeng’s fist smashed into the saber, unleashing an explosion of light. Both their bodies rocked as they actually ended up even in power.

Suddenly, another saber appeared in Guo Ran’s left hand. Pulling back the saber in his right hand, he swung the saber in his left hand at Shi Lingfeng’s waist. Sparks flew as a large cut appeared in Shi Lingfeng’s body.

Golden liquid flowed out of that wound, and it seemed to contain an enormous amount of spiritual qi. It should be Shi Lingfeng’s blood.

Shi Lingfeng roared and kicked Guo Ran, while Guo Ran blocked with his knee. The two once more separated.

“Bastard, didn’t you say you would only use one hand?!”

“Idiot, aren’t I only using one hand?” Guo Ran waved the blade in his left hand.

“Bullshit, you’re clearly using both hands!” cursed Shi Lingfeng.

“After having one eye plucked out by my boss, did your other eye become blind? I clearly only used my left hand after my right hand was done. Isn’t that still one hand at a time?” sneered Guo Ran.

“You...!”

“You idiot, you don’t even understand this principle. Then I’ll give you a display to show what’s one hand and what’s two hands.”

Guo Ran suddenly flew at Shi Lingfeng, slashing one of his sabers at him.

“This is one hand!”

BOOM!

“This is also one hand!”

BOOM!

Guo Ran swung his sabers alternatively, forcing Shi Lingfeng back twice. Just at this moment, Guo Ran pressed his two sabers together.

The two sabers actually merged into one, and in that instant, a terrifying pressure crashed down. Guo Ran’s armor suddenly flashed, and his saber hacked down like lightning.

“This is two hands!”

BOOOM!

This time, Guo Ran’s saber slashed partly through both Shi Lingfeng’s hands. Everyone clearly saw cracks appear on his hands, and golden liquid burst out. Shi Lingfeng smashed into the ground.

The sabers separated once more, and Guo Ran rested them both on his shoulders, having them form an X sign. Although they looked a bit strange, they were definitely flashy.

Looking down at the ground where Shi Lingfeng was, Guo Ran lazily said, “Stone head, now do you understand? Do you know how to differentiate between one hand and two hands?”

Guo Ran had actually beaten the Stone Emperor’s heir into such a state, shocking everyone present. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

Although Guo Ran had some fame in the Dragonblood Legion, the reality was that in the eyes of the rest of the world, he was a minor figure of complete insignificance.

The fact that Guo Ran relied on his armor and not his own power made other experts look down on him. They refused to acknowledge such a fighting style.

Just because the Mechanism Sect was arrogant didn’t mean that the rest of the world acknowledged them either. They never dared to provoke true experts. In the eyes of the likes of the everlasting families, the Stone race, or other powers with their own profound foundations, the Mechanism Sect was nothing more than an irritating fly.

Even the Mechanism Sect’s mechanism arts weren’t important to them. They considered it a heretical path. As for Guo Ran, he was just a dabbler of that path.

However, Guo Ran had now beaten Shi Lingfeng, and that was exceptionally shocking.

“Are his mechanism arts even greater than the Mechanism Sect? But how could that be possible?” People were full of questions. Was this heretical path actually so powerful?

They had clearly sensed Shi Lingfeng’s terrifying aura. That level of power was suffocating, but Guo Ran had easily beaten him. That was hard to believe.

“Is the entire Dragonblood Legion this terrifying? First Yue Zifeng killed Jian Wuchen, and now some armored, nameless freak was able to crush Shi Lingfeng. Just what is going on?” demanded one of the ancient race’s supreme geniuses.

“Aren’t they supposed to be part of a declined era? Wasn’t the qi flow of the continent insufficient to give rise to more experts like us? How could such terrifying experts appear just before the qi flow eruption?”

“Can any random member of them match a supreme genius? The Dragonblood Legion is too terrifying!”

Looking from Guo Ran to the bottomless hole in the ground, their hearts shook. It was no wonder Long Chen dared to be so arrogant as to occupy the strongest qi flow stream.

The Stone race’s experts’ expressions changed, especially their seniors who were standing at the rear. Some of them tried to charge forward as well, but they were stopped by their leader.

BOOM! Shi Lingfeng came charging out of the ground. His cracked arms had recovered.

The earth began to shine, and the light gathered at Shi Lingfeng.

“Wow, not bad! You’ve recovered so quickly. I forgot that you stone heads are born from the earth.” Guo Ran praised Shi Lingfeng, but that praise sounded more like an adult praising a child.

“Great Earthen Support, Stone Spirit Possession!”

Shi Lingfeng ignored Guo Ran, letting out a furious roar. The surrounding earth radiated golden light that he absorbed. He once more charged at Guo Ran.

BOOM!

This time, Guo Ran shuddered from the impact. Even with the protection of his armor, his arms were numb. “After drinking your mother’s milk, your power really is different! It looks like we can properly play now. You like to fight barehanded? Then I won’t use my blades either.”

Guo Ran actually put away his blood-colored sabers and began exchanging punches and kicks with Shi Lingfeng. Every collision caused spatial rumbling. Sparks flew about. The sound of stone and metal clashing was very piercing.

“This armor of Guo Ran’s is much more agile than before. It’s like it’s a part of him. He really has some talent in this regard.” Just as Long Chen was watching Guo Ran’s fight, he heard a voice ring out behind him.

“Oh? Mo Nian, when did you get here?” asked Long Chen, surprised. Mo Nian had come.

Mo Nian’s face darkened. He cursed, “I’ve been here forever! When I said something, you all ignored me! Am I really so easy to overlook?”

“About that, I can testify that Mo Nian came before us.” Bao Buping raised a hand.

Only then did Long Chen see that Mo Nian had brought over ten thousand of the Mo family’s disciples. Long Chen had been so focused on the Sovereign seal that he hadn’t noticed. With Gu Yang and the others around, he didn’t need to pay too much attention to the surroundings.

So when Mo Nian arrived, Gu Yang and the others had greeted him, but Long Chen hadn’t even looked his way, depressing him. Had Long Chen’s status grown to the point that he no longer recognized his friends?

However, when Mo Nian heard Long Chen’s question, he almost coughed up blood. How exactly had Long Chen simply not seen him?

“Long Chen, it’s been a long time.” A woman standing behind Mo Nian walked forward.

“Haha, it really has been a long time. Lady Liu’s heroic air is still the same after all these years.” Long Chen laughed. This woman with her hair tied up behind her head and her slender figure was Mo Nian’s fiancee, Liu Zongying.

Long Chen still remembered the first time he had encountered this woman. She had been like a fierce tiger, wanting to teach him a lesson, saying that he had misguided Mo Nian into being unfaithful.

At that time, Liu Zongying had been a Celestial whose power was even greater than Mo Nian’s, making him afraid of her.

Later on, Mo Nian awakened a special manifestation and soared, while Liu Zongying stayed in her old state.

However, her position in Mo Nian’s heart never changed. Perhaps Mo Nian had gotten so used to her beatings that he felt unwell without them.

“Yes. You’re also not bad. After so many years, you’ve gotten a group of women.” Liu Zongying glared at Long Chen.

“Yes, not bad. Mo Nian said he would do the same one day,” said Long Chen.

Fortunately, there wasn’t someone as intense as Liu Zongying amongst his women. Although Tang Wan-er got jealous easily, it was much better than Liu Zongying’s intense jealousy.

As expected, Liu Zongying turned her attention to Mo Nian. “You said that?”

Before Mo Nian said anything, Long Chen piped up, “No, he never said that. I must have made a mistake.”

Seeing how fake that explanation was, Mo Nian’s expression darkened. Long Chen was acting like he was covering up the truth.

“Look, Guo Ran’s attacking!” cried Mo Nian.

“Alright, there are too many people here, so I’ll give you some face. When we get back, you’ll have to give me a perfect explanation,” said Liu Zongying quietly.

Long Chen smiled brightly. Mo Nian would constantly con him when he was bored, and now Long Chen wanted to have some vengeance.

All the Life Star experts that had come were in qi flow streams, absorbing the energy. They watched as Guo Ran and Shi Lingfeng fought.

Seeing how even things were even when Guo Ran was just fighting with his fists, they concluded that it was not a fluke that Guo Ran had sent Shi Lingfeng flying at the beginning. It was true power.

“Long Chen, Long Chen! The Blood Emperor’s family beauty has come. Are you interested?” Mo Nian suddenly patted Long Chen on the shoulder, pointing in the distance. Long Chen followed his gesture, and his body suddenly quivered.

“Such a beauty actually exists in this world?”
