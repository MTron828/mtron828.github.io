Chapter 1472 World Destroying Apocalypse Light

Translator: BornToBe

“Long Chen, don’t slander others. Who are you accusing of destroying the Xuantian Dao Sect?” shouted Qi Yunao angrily.

“Long Chen, what nonsense are you saying? When did the Xuantian Dao Sect get destroyed?” Luo Jinnan also shouted along. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

“Hahahahaha...” Long Chen raised his head and laughed loudly. This laughter was full of killing intent. The world seemed to become dark, as if all its light and color had been sucked away. Even the sun in the sky no longer appeared as bright.

“This killing intent...” Dragonbone Evilmoon muttered to itself, shocked.

Long Chen was laughing out of rage. He was now one hundred percent sure that these two were aware of the Xuantian Dao Sect’s destruction.

According to logic, if Qi Yunao didn’t know about what happened with the Xuantian Dao Sect, he would first display shock and not immediately accuse him of slander.

As for Luo Jinnan, adding on his cover-up only made it worse. These two definitely knew about this matter. In fact, perhaps Luo Jinnan had participated in it.

Seeing these two sanctimoniously criticizing him, acting like they stood on the side of right and morality, Long Chen’s killing intent soared.

“Since that’s the case, you can both die!” Long Chen’s divine ring appeared, five stars circulated in his eyes, and green dragon scales covered his body. He raised Dragonbone Evilmoon, and a huge saber-image tore into the clouds.

“Not good!” Qi Yunao’s expression changed. This attack was so powerful that even before the saber-image slashed down, the mountain beneath him was crumbling. “Qiankun Formation, Soul Devouring Staff, Seal!”

The Violet Gold Soul Devouring Staff’s divine light suddenly connected to the peaks of the eighty-one mountains in the Heaven Suppressing Magic Sect. Their power combined to form a giant ‘Seal’ character.

When the Seal character appeared, time and space froze. The world entered a strange static state.

This was the Heaven Suppressing Magic Sect’s Qiankun Formation. It came from ancient times, and its power was terrifying. With the Violet Gold Soul Devouring Staff at its core and the energy within the eighty-one mountains, this formation could seal devils and gods.

When the Seal character appeared, everyone was unable to move.

However, there was one exception. It was unable to seal Dragonbone Evilmoon. The two dragon images on it seemed to come to life, and the saber-image fell onto the Seal character.

The Seal character instantly exploded. It was unable to bear Evilmoon’s power.

When it exploded, the eighty-one mountains were also blown to bits. The entire Heaven Suppressing Magic Sect was badly damaged.

As for the disciples on the mountains, not one of them managed to escape. They were all killed. Even Soul Transformation Elders were unable to survive those explosions.

In the entire Heaven Suppressing Magic Sect, the only mountain to survive was the one Long Chen was standing on. It was the core of the Heaven Suppressing Magic Sect and protected by the Violet Gold Soul Devouring Staff. It was now a lonely mountain in this destroyed land.

“Long Chen, I will tear you to pieces!” Qi Yunao let out a furious roar. He practically went insane. This one attack almost completely destroyed the Heaven Suppressing Magic Sect.

“Qi Yunao, when you joined hands with the Corrupt path to destroy the Xuantian Dao Sect, did you once think about the Xuantian Dao Sect’s grief? Let’s just see who tears who to pieces!” Long Chen roared furiously, and black light exploded out of Evilmoon. The world seemed to transform into an endless hell.

“World Destroying Apocalypse Light!”

Qi Yunao raised the Violet Gold Soul Devouring Staff. Divine light condensed and shot toward Long Chen.

BOOM! The black light collided with the divine light. The void exploded, and thunderous rumbling shook their ears.

“Long Chen, I can only give you an incense stick’s amount of time. Figure things out on your own,” said Dragonbone Evilmoon.

Long Chen understood that in Evilmoon’s current state, it could only last for this long.

“Brother Luo, quickly kill Long Chen!” Qi Yunao’s expression changed. He was shocked to find that the Violet Gold Soul Devouring Staff was sucked in by Long Chen’s black saber. They were in a deadlock, so he immediately asked for Luo Jinnan’s assistance.

“Long Chen, you fiend, you’ve once more slaughtered countless innocents. Today, I’ll take the places of the heavens to punish you!” Luo Jinnan shot toward Long Chen with a sword in his hand.

“Fuck your heavens!” Long Chen released Evilmoon, a pot appearing in his hand.

BOOM!

Another explosive sound rang out. Luo Jinnan’s sword shattered, while he himself was blown back, coughing up blood.

“What?!” Qi Yunao was shocked to see this. He hadn’t expected Long Chen to be able to release his weapon and continue fighting.

As for himself, when he tried to do the same, he found some strange energy from the black saber preventing him from throwing it off. It stuck to the Violet Gold Soul Devouring Staff like glue.

“Is this how you plan on tearing me to pieces? Then let’s see who tears who to pieces. Star Fall!” Long Chen raised his hand, and a golden sphere appeared, quickly growing larger before it rapidly fell down.

“Not good! Run!”

The experts on the core mountain all jumped in terror. They had never imagined that even Qi Yunao wouldn’t be able to kill Long Chen. Now they were all filled with regret.

If they had fled when Long Chen had warned them, they wouldn’t have fallen into such desperate straits.

BOOM! Star Fall landed on the ground and exploded. A wave of flames spread in every direction.

“AH! No!”

“Save me!”

“I don’t want to die!”

Cries of misery and despair intertwined. But very quickly, hundreds of thousands of experts were turned to ash. The only area of the Heaven Suppressing Magic Sect that hadn’t been destroyed had now become a sea of flames.

On this huge mountain, the only structure to survive was the statue of the Heaven Suppressing Magic Sect’s founder.

“Long Chen...” Qi Yunao’s eyes almost exploded. He clenched his teeth so hard that blood almost came out. All the Heaven Suppressing Magic Sect’s experts were dead now.

The sole survivor of the sect was Qi Yunao. All their buildings had been destroyed.

The thing that enraged him the most was that even at this moment, the Violet Gold Soul Devouring Staff was still bound by the black saber and unable to escape.

If he wanted to kill Long Chen, he would have to fight him with his fists. But that would be no different than suicide.

“Brother Luo, go to the ancestral statue’s head, quick!” shouted Qi Yunao furiously.

Luo Jinnan didn’t know what he was planning, but it just so happened that after being blown back by Long Chen’s attack, he was very close to the statue.

Buzz.

Just as Luo Jinnan reached the head of the statue, Qi Yunao pressed the space between his eyebrows. Fresh blood spurted out, condensing into a rune in his hand. It rapidly lit up.

When the blood rune lit up, a rune also appeared on the same spot of the giant statue. Divine light flowed out into Luo Jinnan’s body. Bathed in that divine light, a runic sword condensed in Luo Jinnan’s hand. With the divine light flowing around him, he seemed like a completely different person.

“Brother Luo, you have been blessed by the ancestor! Take my place to get rid of Long Chen! But leave his soul behind; I want to make sure he never reincarnates ever again!” roared Qi Yunao with rancor.

Luo Jinnan nodded and shot toward Long Chen, many times faster than before. He let out a single slash of his sword. Although it was a simple slash, its power caused the stars to quiver.

BOOM!

Long Chen raised his pot, but as a result, he let out a muffled snort as he was blown back. Both his arms were numb, and his chest was hurting. He almost coughed up blood.

Long Chen’s eyes began to shine. It seemed he had underestimated the Heaven Suppressing Magic Sect. Fortunately, he had Evilmoon first entangle the Violet Gold Soul Devouring Staff, making it so Qi Yunao couldn’t interfere.

If Qi Yunao had this blessing and used the Violet Gold Soul Devouring Staff in this state, then his power wouldn’t necessarily be something Evilmoon could block.

Two streaks of sword-light flew toward Long Chen. They were like torrents of power, and no matter how Long Chen dodged, he would still be struck.

This kind of attack possessed an invisible locking power. It would follow Long Chen to the ends of the earth. Even if the attacker launched it with their eyes closed, it would land. This kind of attack could only be met head-on.

Long Chen blocked them both but couldn’t help coughing up blood. The runic power behind these attacks was able to bypass the pot to land on his body.

“Long Chen, you should hurry up and let yourself be captured. That’s the only way to lessen your sins!” shouted Luo Jinnan as he once more attacked with his runic sword.

“Double Dragon Destruction!” Long Chen suddenly shouted, unleashing Lei Long and Huo Long.

“An insect’s insignificant struggle! Break!” Luo Jinnan sneered. He felt a great power supporting him right now. He was like a god who could destroy the world with a wave of his hand.

Long Chen’s fierce attack blew apart. Lightning and flame runes flew out in every direction.

In front of the current Luo Jinnan, everything seemed so powerless. He was invincible.

“Die!” Luo Jinnan charged in front of Long Chen, slashing his sword into him.

Bang! Long Chen’s body exploded, and Luo Jinnan’s expression changed. At the same time, Qi Yunao’s furious roar rang out.

“Long Chen, you dare?!”
