Chapter 4649 Treasure Land of Fengshui

When Long Chen and the others exited the dragon cemetery, they saw lightning flashing in the distance. The world had darkened, causing the distant specks of lightning to look like stars.

Now, there were countless thundering stars in the surroundings, and every single one of them represented someone undergoing tribulation.

“They’ve started their tribulations. We should hurry up.” Seeing countless people already undergoing tribulation, Guo Ran grew antsy.

This world’s laws had changed, with more spiritual qi gushing out. According to history, this was the optimal time to undergo tribulation. The reason countless people had entered the world of the ninth heaven was precisely to undergo tribulation here.

“There’s no rush. We still have time. Let’s seek a better location first,” suggested Long Chen.

Regarding the optimal method for undergoing tribulation here, Long Chen indeed didn’t know that much. However, he believed that if he was about to do something wrong, the Earth Cauldron would correct him.

Since the Earth Cauldron hadn’t said anything all the time, it meant that he still had some time to kill.

“Then where should we go?” Guo Ran eyed their surroundings, but all he saw was heavenly tribulation all around the place.

“That’s easy. Wherever the most people are is the best place to undergo tribulation,” replied Long Chen. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

Everyone looked in one direction after he had said this—the densest star cluster. The roaring of heavenly tribulation was particularly powerful there.

They immediately set off in that direction, passing by many cultivators who were undergoing tribulation. Sometimes, Long Chen and his companion would simply pass through them.

“There are some fellows from the devil race. Should we kill them?” asked one of the Dragonblood warriors

When they saw the devil race’s experts undergoing tribulation, their killing intent instantly rose.

“No need. If you kill them, it will count as interference against the heavenly tribulation. It’s not a good thing. Being locked down by a heavenly tribulation will slow us down, and it might introduce some unknown variables,” reminded Long Chen.

These devil experts were nothing more than ants. It wasn’t worth wasting time on them.

When Long Chen and the others passed straight through other people’s tribulations, those people turned green with fright. They cursed Long Chen and his companions, fearing that their presence might interfere with their own heavenly tribulations, potentially resulting in their demise by a bolt of heavenly lightning.

However, when this lightning fell on the Dragonblood warriors, it simply shattered upon contact. Heavenly tribulation on this level couldn’t even count as an itch to them.

Even Bai Shishi, Bai Xiaole, Yu Qingxuan, and the others with weak physical bodies were capable of completely ignoring this lightning.

This time, the baptism of the Sovereign clan’s dragon blood had truly transformed everyone. While these people undergoing tribulation were going all-out, this level of lightning was nothing to the Dragonblood Legion.

Long Chen and the others passed through without affecting the tribulation at all. They were so strong that they didn’t even summon their protective divine light around their bodies.

Due to them putting up no resistance at all, the heavenly tribulation didn’t take note of them. They passed through easily. The ones undergoing tribulation had a bad fright, but as for whether or not they would recover from this fright and pass their tribulation, no one knew.

Long Chen guided the Dragonblood warriors on a straight path through the tribulation area. Countless individuals undergoing their own tribulations either cursed at them or pleaded for mercy.

Long Chen and his companions would navigate around the tribulations of those who politely requested, showing them courtesy. However, they showed no leniency to those who cursed at them, confidently passing through their tribulations.

Guo Ran in particular would fly right past the person undergoing tribulation, terrifying them with the thought of him suddenly attacking.

As they advanced, they saw more people undergoing tribulations, some in small groups of three to five people. After all, collective tribulation would amplify the power of the tribulation and introduce unpredictable factors.

Nevertheless, there were always exceptionally confident experts from the same sect or similar backgrounds who took the risk of collective tribulation. They understood that the stronger the heavenly tribulation, the greater the potential benefits. However, this risk also heightened the danger they faced.

“Curious. Where are those idiots of the Celestial race?” Guo Ran and the others were about to reach the core area of this place, but they hadn’t seen a single member of the Celestial race.

The Dragonblood warriors were still nursing a grudge against the Celestial race from their last battle. They hoped to encounter them here so they could draw a conclusion to their grudge.

“Are they no longer in the Void Spirit World?”

Long Chen was able to freely move between the Void Spirit World and the Fantasy Spirit World thanks to the Earth Cauldron, but he chose to undergo tribulation in the Void Spirit World because this place was the most suitable for those who came from outside of the ninth heaven. Other than that, he hoped to see Luo Changsheng.

“They might be in a secret tribulation land,” guessed Xia Chen.

Long Chen nodded. “You’re probably right. Although there are many people undergoing tribulation here, there aren’t many peak experts. They’ve likely chosen a secluded location for their tribulations, one where they can avoid interference from others.”

“Fuck, they actually get special treatment!” Gu Yang cursed.

“Ignore them. Even if you know this, you can’t find them. Just undergo your own tribulations here,” assured Long Chen.

Long Chen brought them to the very core of this region—an enormous mountain range that was covered in craggy rocks. From a distance, it looked like a giant stone beast kneeling on the ground.

Countless experts had gathered here. A giant lightning vortex had appeared high in the sky, the result of millions of people undergoing tribulation affecting each other.

“Inferior humans! Scram!”

When Long Chen arrived at the center of the experts, a cold shout rang out from a cluster of rocks. A group of large horned lifeforms emerged, glaring at Long Chen and his companions like bloodthirsty beasts.

Their Blood Qis were astoundingly powerful. While they occupied the core region, they weren’t undergoing tribulation yet. They seemed to be waiting for something.

Their intimidating aura deterred anyone else from undergoing tribulation in their vicinity, leaving the area devoid of anyone.

“Eight-star Doyens?”

Guo Ran and the others were surprised. As these people possessed vast Heavenly Doyen energies, they were definitely powerful experts.

However, when Long Chen and the others got close, those powerful experts were shocked as well, as they sensed the overwhelming Blood Qi from the Dragonblood warriors.

“Everyone, prepare yourselves for your tribulations,” commanded Long Chen, not giving those people a second glance.

“Courting death!”

Seeing Long Chen treat them like empty air, one of the imposing lifeforms couldn’t tolerate the disrespect and unleashed a thunderous roar. A massive saber then appeared, hurtling toward Long Chen with deadly intent.
