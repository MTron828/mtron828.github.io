Chapter 1951: 1951

Three were killed in one blow each . The third Netherpassage expert had clearly blocked Long Chen’s saber but had been unable to stop his lightning spear .

“That’s clearly a powerful paragon art! How can he use it so quickly?!”

Everyone was stunned . The intense fluctuations of that spear meant that it was a paragon art . And they were correct, it was the lightning paragon art, the Wild Lightning Soul Battle Spear .

What they didn’t know was that Long Chen’s paragon arts had two states . One was powered with Lei Long’s energy, while the other was with the lightning field’s energy .

Only when he was connected to the lightning field would his paragon arts be at full power . However, he was still capable of using it with just Lei Long’s power .

If it was before, Lei Long’s power wouldn’t be enough to heavily injure Netherpassage experts . But Lei Long had devoured a great deal of divine lightning during the Dragonblood Legion’s tribulation, resulting in it once more advancing . Its divine energy was more concentrated, and it easily pierced through that Netherpassage expert’s defensive divine light .

With Evilmoon in his right hand and the Wild Lightning Soul Battle Spear in his left hand, Long Chen was like a devil god, mercilessly reaping the lives of Netherpassage experts .

Perhaps it could be said that the first two to be killed were still affected by the seventh form of Split the Heavens, so Long Chen had relied on some technique . However, the third Netherpassage expert had been slain with pure power .

In just the blink of an eye, Long Chen had killed three Netherpassage experts, using his power to take the dominating role on the battlefield .

“Heaven-defying, absolutely heaven-defying . ”

“He’s worthy of being called the strongest expert of the Martial Heaven Continent’s junior generation . This is a real man . ”

Those two women from neutral factions looked at him with worshipful expressions . They were of the same age, but in their lifetimes, they wouldn’t even dream of doing what Long Chen had done .

Long Chen’s lightning spear vanished, and he shot after the closest panicking Netherpassage expert .

That expert’s expression changed, and he chose to do something no one had previously imagined . He decided to turn and flee .

Long Chen snorted and lightning flashed around him . He caught up in just a second, slashing his saber down with both hands .

“Bastard, I’ll go all-out!” That Netherpassage expert felt despair as he was too unlucky to actually be targeted by Long Chen . He spat a mouthful of blood onto his sword, and divine power roared .

“What are you going to use to go all-out? The seventh form of Split the Heavens?”

Long Chen sneered and his saber fell .

In front of the seventh form of Split the Heavens, that Netherpassage expert’s attack appeared weak and insignificant . It didn’t even cause a ripple . He was instantly torn through .

“Fucking satisfying . ” Evilmoon was shouting with delight . The blood of these Netherpassage experts excited it, and it felt refreshed to be able to unleash its power .

Another Netherpassage expert was slain once again with absolute power . This scene was even more shocking . Hence, the remaining Netherpassage experts fled and vanished from sight .

“Fine, you should stop too . Your physical body has reached its limit . Without advancing to Netherpassage, you probably won’t be able to control the full power of the azure dragon,” said Evilmoon .

It found that cracks had appeared in Long Chen’s bones . He was so powerful that his own body couldn’t handle it .

Although Long Chen’s physical body had been reforged by the azure dragon essence blood, he still couldn’t use its full power . He would need to get stronger first . As a member of the dragon race, Evilmoon was very sure about this .

Putting away Evilmoon, Long Chen didn’t show any happiness or sorrow . In front of everyone’s dumbfounded gazes, he slowly walked away .

Over ten Netherpassage experts had tried to stop him . As a result, four of them died while the others fled miserably .

Everyone suddenly thought of Long Chen’s previous words about adding some color to this battlefield with the blood of Netherpassage experts . He had really done it .

“The stories say that Long Chen never says any empty words . I believe it now,” sighed someone .

“I don’t understand how a hero of our Righteous path has ended up isolated and surrounded by enemies . Why would the alliance head expel senior apprentice-brother Long Chen? It’s completely unjust,” said one young disciple angrily . As soon as he said this, quite a few expressions changed .

Long Chen’s expulsion had caused huge waves, and countless young disciples were filled with indignation for him, wanting Qu Jianying to repeal this .

Even the seniors and masters of the various sects were unable to suppress their momentum . Long Chen’s prestige amongst the junior generation was just too great .

Things had only just calmed down when this disciple brought it up again . It was like splashing oil on a fire .

“The alliance head naturally has her own plans . What could a child like you understand? Don’t you see that Long Chen didn’t say anything at all about that? Get back, or I’ll have to imprison you!” shouted an elder . That disciple clearly belonged to him . ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

“Hmph, how am I child? I’m seven years older than senior apprentice-brother Long Chen . When he was my age, he was already thrown into the bloody world, while I had to be beaten and scolded all the time . I wanted to go out into the world, but you didn’t let me, saying it was dangerous and raising me wasn’t easy . If I did dodge any danger though, you would scold me for being a coward and not being a man . No matter what I do, I’m wrong . Senior apprentice-brother Long Chen didn’t have anyone telling him what to do, but he knew what he needed to do, while we don’t get to do what we feel like we need . If you old fellows were always right, you would have long since reached the peak of this world instead of being cowards who don’t dare to say anything to enemies that come knocking at your door!” shouted the young disciple . All his accumulated resentment and anger erupted at once .

His words formed a resonance amongst the junior generation present . They were the geniuses of their various factions, and they all had the same pain .

They might not need to worry about being clothed or hungry, which was a life countless people longed for . But they knew that they weren’t free .

Their seniors always looked after everything that they did . They had to act according to their standards, and if they didn’t, they would be wrong . That made them feel lost in life, and more and more rebellious .

The reason Long Chen had become an idol of countless experts was because he hadn’t relied on anyone to reach his current height .

They were filled with reverence, as well as envy for his freedom . He was a wild horse, while they were caged birds that weren’t allowed to fly as they wanted to . Instead, they were kept in a cage, and when they were allowed to fly, they had a string tied to their legs that was holding them back .

“Little brat, who do you think you’re talking to? I’m your father!” raged the elder .

“Can a father be this unreasonable? If your father was unreasonable with you, did you have to be unreasonable with me? You didn’t have the power to go against your father . You’re a coward, but I won’t be like that . What qualifications do you have to scold me?” The young man refused to submit .

Only then did everyone hear that they were a pair of father and son . However, that son’s words were clearly unfilial . He actually called his father a coward .

“You... you fucking...”

The father was enraged but didn’t know what to say . He grabbed his son and beat him .

“Hey! You old man, what did your son do? Did he say anything wrong? Just because you couldn’t out-talk him, you beat him? Useless seniors like you restrict our growth, or perhaps each one of us could be on the same level as senior apprentice-brother Long Chen!” His actions immediately incurred public wrath .

“Exactly, you’ve throttled our Dao-hearts . Even geniuses would be raised into idiots by you . If it weren’t for your foolishness, even if we weren’t like Long Chen, we would still be real men like the Dragonblood warriors!”

“Fuck, you’re not releasing him? Brothers, beat this old man! Just how much are we supposed to take without fighting back?!”

Dozens of young men charged forward at the same time at the father .

“Bastards, you-!”

Bang!

The old man roared . Just how had looking after his own child ended up incurring so many people’s wrath? Just as he was going to frighten them away, a fist struck him in the eye, making him see stars .

There were too many people for him to know who had done that . In his anger, he sent a punch at those men .

“Brother, don’t be afraid, we’ll save you! Youngsters like us should be united against oppression!”

“Good brother! We’ll rebel together! We’ll all be unrivaled heroes like senior apprentice-brother Long Chen!”

Just as they started a chaotic brawl with some others coming to try to intervene and calm things down, rumbling rang out . Before anyone could say anything, a war chariot appeared in the sky .

“Where is Long Chen?!”

A thunderous roar rang out . It stabbed people’s eardrums, and weaker people even began to bleed from their ears . They stared in shock up at the sky .
