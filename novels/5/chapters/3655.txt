Chapter 3644 Supreme Heavenly Genius, Ji Wuying

Long Chen’s saber contained his full heart and spirit, and it completely locked onto that person, not letting him get away.

BOOM!

Two divine weapons clashed together, resulting in an explosion of sparks. When that happened, the world was like a mirror that was struck. Cracks instantly spread throughout the void.

“Spatial energy?”

Long Chen was startled. At this moment, his saber’s power was released into the void by a strange energy.

Due to how long he had known Bai Xiaole, he was familiar with spatial energy. Seeing this, he instantly had a bad feeling.

Without hesitation, Long Chen slashed his saber behind him.

BOOM! Another explosion caused cracks to appear in the void.

Long Chen repeatedly slashed his saber sixteen times. Other than the first one when he took the initiative to attack, the rest were all him being forced to passively defend.

The attacker was as quick as lightning, and his movements were like that of a phantom. Long Chen couldn’t even grasp them. Furthermore, the attacker’s target was always Xia Chen who was behind him.

That enraged Long Chen. This person actually dared to ignore him and focus on killing Xia Chen when he was right there.

“Long Chen, is it? You’re quite famous, but is this all your power? If I, Ji Wuying, wish to kill someone, then not even ten of you would be enough to stop me.” That person sneered, and his sword continued to dance in the air, aiming for Xia Chen.

“Even Enpuda doesn’t dare to say such big words in front of me. Who do you think you are? Do you think having a Supreme Bone is so amazing?” Long Chen snorted. After his battle with Alldevil Tianye, he was more familiar with Supreme Bones. Thus, he could sense the aura of a Supreme Bone on Ji Wuying’s body.

Furthermore, this person was capable of activating spatial energy without hand seals, incantations, or even using his Spiritual Strength. It was directly unleashed. That meant that his spatial energy was not something he latently cultivated but a kind of innate divine ability.

It was somewhat similar to Bai Xiaole’s Three Flower Pupils. However, even when it came to the Three Flower Pupils, the body, mouth, and will still had to work together to use spatial power.

On the other hand, this person’s spatial power was unleashed all on its own. That made Long Chen guess that it was the natural spatial energy of this person’s Supreme Bone.

“Split the Heavens 1!”

Violet qi burst out of the Minghong Saber, and it slashed through the air. Its sharp killing intent locked onto Ji Wuying once again.

BOOM!

Cracks once more appeared in the void. However, it was different from before. Previously, Long Chen’s energy was all blocked by spatial energy. But this time, a violet saber-image continued through the spatial cracks to strike Ji Wuying.

Ji Wuying was forced back three steps. On the third step, the ground beneath his feet exploded, and it was caused by a golden talisman that had appeared there.

The golden talisman’s explosion made Ji Wuying grunt in pain. His lower legs were turned into pulp.

That talisman was placed by Xia Chen. Even Long Chen didn’t know how he had sent the talisman there. The timing and location were so perfect that even Ji Wuying was struck by it.

All of a sudden, the void exploded and a black-armored figure came flying out. His black saber slashed down on Ji Wuying with all his power.

Guo Ran had arrived. After receiving a message from Long Chen, Guo Ran immediately rushed over. Long Chen chased Xia Chen, while Guo Ran chased Long Chen, resulting in him arriving now. Without hesitation, he unleashed his strongest attack.

“Split the Heavens 2!”

Ji Wuying had just been knocked back by Long Chen and injured by Xia Chen. Hence, now that Guo Ran’s attack came, he didn’t even have time to think and could only block hastily.

As a result, Guo Ran’s blow sent him flying. Without a chance to unleash his spatial energy, he was blown far into the distance.

After that, Xia Chen took out dozens of talismans. With a wave of his hand, those talismans covered heaven and earth.

“Hmph, interesting. To be able to injure me, although you used numbers, I have to say that you have some ability. But if you want to trap me, you must be dreaming. Next time, I will take your life.”

Ji Wuying’s figure suddenly vanished into the void.

It was then that Xia Chen’s talismans unleashed a barrier of light. He had been trying to keep Ji Wuying trapped here, but he was one step too late.

“Fuck, he got away! That’s too bad, but, hehe, who cares? We’ll kill him next time. Brother Xia Chen, I really missed you. Without you, I feel like the entire world is black and white. I can’t see a trace of color.” Guo Ran was a bit displeased that Ji Wuying escaped, but seeing Xia Chen again made him forget about that. Guo Ran immediately walked over and gave Xia Chen a fierce hug.

“Yes, these days without you really have been hard. Us brothers can’t be parted. Now, we can collaborate once more.” Xia Chen embraced Guo Ran tightly. The two of them began weeping without being aware of it.Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Guo Ran and Xia Chen were perfect partners. After so many years of collaboration, they could practically communicate without words. A simple gaze was enough to convey what they were thinking to each other.

Hence, the two of them only needed a glance to know that both of them had suffered during this time. They couldn’t even say anything and simply wept.

It was only after a while that the two of them calmed down. Xia Chen then activated a transportation talisman, sending the three of them into a secluded mountain range.

This place was also not safe. According to Xia Chen, his enemies would manage to track them down in at most six hours.

Long Chen felt that six hours was enough. He then checked Xia Chen’s body and found that his outer wounds were nothing. The main concern was the injury to his soul. In order to block Gongsun Xuan’s attack back then, he had paid a terrifying price. Because of it, he had yet to recover.

After giving Xia Chen several medicinal pills, Long Chen used his own Spiritual Strength to help him recover.

Although Long Chen wasn’t a talisman cultivator and didn’t purely raise his soul energy, his Spiritual Strength was incomparably powerful. With the aid of his Spiritual Strength, Xia Chen’s soul energy would quickly recover as well.

In just four hours, Xia Chen’s soul energy recovered to around eighty percent, and his outer injury was also healed. Only then did Long Chen ask Xia Chen about the situation.

When this matter was raised, Xia Chen was first silent for a moment before flames of fury filled his eyes.

“I, Xia Chen, have never hated someone so much in this lifetime. Boss, I will definitely kill Gongsun Xuan and that bitch.”
