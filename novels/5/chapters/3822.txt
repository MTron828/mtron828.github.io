Chapter 3811 You Bring Out the People, I’ll Put Out the Work

The city lord was enraged but was shocked inside. He had been completely confident in killing Long Chen with this attack, but Long Chen had managed to instantly unleash such immense power. It made no sense.

He hadn’t used his full power yet, but he also knew that Long Chen hadn’t done that either. Perhaps if they were to fight, he was assured of being able to kill Long Chen in a few moves. But just as Long Chen said, if he were to unleash his full power, Silver Moon City would be wiped out of existence in just those few moves.

He couldn’t beat Long Chen without using his full power, but if he did use his full power, his city would be destroyed. Killing Long Chen came at too high of a price, but letting him off was intolerable. As a result, the city lord quivered with rage, not knowing what to do.

“Aiya, I say, what’s the big deal? You have so many sons. You’re not going to miss one or two. Furthermore, this son of yours was so bad. Now that he’s dead, you’re going to save a great deal of stress and time! You can use that time to have another one. How about this? I will be the mediator. If you feel like you’ve suffered an undue loss here, how about I help you make up for it?” Mo Nian suddenly stepped forward at this time to give his advice over this matter.

“What do you mean?” demanded the city lord.

“I mean if you feel like having children is taxing, just lend me your lady. I guarantee that within three years, you’ll have one big fellow and one little fellow. Then wouldn’t this matter be settled peacefully? If you’re lucky, you can even have one big fellow and two little fellows, maybe even three little fellows! Then you’ll have profited immensely. You bring out the people, I’ll put out the work… aiya, what the fuck!” Mo Nian wasn’t even done talking when the city lord furiously unleashed a punch at him. The boots on his feet lit up.

The next moment, space exploded and the city lord’s furious attack missed. Mo Nian had escaped from his spiritual lock.

Mo Nian then stood behind Long Chen, furiously cursing, “We’re just talking! What are you hitting people for?! After offering my help, why did I get such treatment?!”

Everyone was shocked. This fellow was even more infuriating than Long Chen. Anyone who was a man probably wouldn’t be able to endure what he said.

His movement art was also completely bizarre. Even at such a close distance, under the city lord’s lock, Mo Nian had easily avoided his attack. That was practically impossible.

The city lord was also shocked. Fortunately, that hadn’t been a full-power attack, as he had controlled his power in order to not damage Silver Moon City. It was thanks to this that he had managed to pull back his fist before it landed. Otherwise, the consequences would be unbearable.

The city lord now realized that Mo Nian had intentionally antagonized him, showing him that he possessed power that was not inferior to Long Chen’s. If they were to fight, there was no way Silver Moon City would be unscathed. They even had the ability to retreat safely.

When Long Chen said that if he wanted to leave, no one could stop him, the city lord hadn’t taken him seriously. But after this one dodge from Mo Nian, he understood that it wasn’t a bluff.

The city lord clenched his teeth, not knowing what to do. If they were not within Silver Moon City, he’d definitely kill this group of hateful fellows.

The other experts inside the city quivered in fear, not daring to make a sound. In all their years following the city lord, they had never seen him this angry.Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

The spectators were all dumbfounded. They hadn’t expected things to progress to this point. Long Chen really was wild. He killed the city lord’s son right in front of him and even directly challenged him, with the city lord not daring to receive this challenge.

“Long Chen, do you think it’s amazing to hide like a tortoise here? If you have guts, come out of the city and have a decisive fight with me!” shouted the Nine Underworld Luocha.

Even after seeing Long Chen display such power, she was fearless. She clearly had absolute confidence in her own power.

“A brain is a good thing. I hope you can get one. If you want to fight, then go ahead and attack me.” Long Chen looked at the Nine Underworld Luocha. This idiot’s power continued to grow, but her brain just stalled.

Go out of the city at this time? Did she get water in her head? As long as he left the city, the city lord would immediately explode. He wasn’t so foolish as to do that.

Just like that, Long Chen swaggered into the city. The disturbance here had long since drawn out everyone within the city.

Once he swaggered in, the people made a path for him. Almost all the humans looked at Long Chen respectfully.

“Count it as your victory. But I will remember this.” The city lord looked at Long Chen coldly.

In the end, he chose to just watch. A single son was not enough for him to lose his rationality and destroy everything that he had built.

Long Chen seemed to have long since expected this result and didn’t even look back. He directly walked into the city. As for the Nine Underworld Luocha, Yin Changsheng, Ji Wuming, and the others, seeing that he refused to leave the city, they could do nothing to him.

They didn’t dare to attack. If they damaged the city, the city lord would go crazy on them. They didn’t want to face such a terrifying expert. If they wanted to kill Long Chen, they would have to find another opportunity.

Although they were a bit unwilling, they were helpless. Yin Changsheng cursed over not having arrived just a moment earlier. If that had happened, he could have stopped Long Chen outside the city.

“Boss!”

Once he was in, the Dragonblood warriors came rushing over with weapons in hands. Clearly, they had been in seclusion and had just received the word, resulting in them being slower and only getting here once things were already over.

During this time, more Dragonblood warriors had gathered in Silver Moon City. There were three hundred and seventeen of them.

When those Dragonblood warriors saw Long Chen, they all wept tears of joy. Long Chen then embraced each of those Dragonblood warriors tightly before leading them to the transportation formation.

“We’re going to Clear Sky City, but this transportation formation can’t bring us there directly. If you want to kill me, don’t miss this chance,” announced Long Chen while looking at Yin Changsheng, the Nine Underworld Luocha, Ji Wuming, and the others.

Long Chen knew that they would definitely chase him. Thus, he directly told them where he wanted to go. If they wanted to die, they could come. At this moment, Long Chen had the confidence to face any expert.

Moreover, he wanted his name to resound within Silver Moon City for a long time. So, if any Dragonblood warriors arrived later, they would know where he went.

“Long Chen, do you only know how to run? Can you not have an honorable fight?” mocked the Nine Underworld Luocha.

Long Chen couldn’t even bother to respond to her. As expected of the disciple raised by that master. If the master’s head wasn’t good, then the disciple was the same. Their words were practically laughable. She actually used such a childish provocation.

Long Chen and the others stepped onto the transportation formation. Mo Nian only eyed the enraged Yin Changsheng and chortled. “Brother, my apologies. I am not able to accept your filial respect this time. Don’t worry, with your talent and diligence, another chance will come.”

Just then, Xia Chen activated the transportation formation. Long Chen and the others vanished.

But just as they vanished, the city lord appeared on top of the transportation formation, making everyone jump.

His figure also began to grow dim. He actually borrowed this transportation power to chase them.

Suddenly, his expression changed. The countless runes on top of the formation lit up. In front of everyone’s shocked gaze, this entire high level transportation formation exploded.

“Idiot.”

From within the explosion, Xia Chen’s mocking voice rang out.

“Just wait!”

After failing to chase and even being schemed against, costing him his transportation formation, the city lord roared furiously. But it was of no use.
