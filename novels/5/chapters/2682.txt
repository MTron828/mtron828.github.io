Chapter 2671 The Strongest Spirit Bone

When that light appeared at the pit of Long Aotian’s stomach, every single expert present felt an ache in their bones.

A supreme, unequaled aura suppressed everyone. In the face of that aura, people felt absolute suppression and fear.

“The strongest Spirit Bone amongst Spirit Bones! A Supreme Spirit Bone!”

A startled cry rang out. When Long Aotian activated his Spirit Bone, people immediately recognized that legendary aura.

The heavens had three treasures, the sun, the moon, and the stars. People had three treasures, the essence, the qi, and the spirit. Those corresponded to the Spirit Blood, Spirit Root, and Spirit Bone.

The Spirit Root was something essentially everyone had, but its quality differed. Many cultivators had some degree of Spirit Blood, but only a small portion of people was qualified to activate it.

Furthermore, even if they could activate it, the Spirit Blood could be differentiated between innate and acquired. The former was inherited from ancestors, while the latter was cultivated by the self.

On the other hand, Spirit Bones were so rare that not even one in a million cultivators might have one. Those who had Spirit Bones were true geniuses amongst geniuses.

Most Spirit Bones were naturally formed. Although they could be awakened after birth, the price for such a thing was immense. For example, the divine bones that Long Chen had obtained in the Ten Thousand Dragon Nest could be used to awaken a Spirit Bone after birth.

However, such treasures were incredibly rare. That was why there was an old phrase in the cultivation world: the Spirit Bone was something you had at birth or something you would never have.

Spirit bones were simply too difficult to obtain, even for supreme sects or giant clans. Endless manpower could be invested into such an endeavor, only to fail.

The Spirit Bone was what connected the qi and spirit. Only when all three existed could it give birth to endless possibilities, a reflection of the principle that the Dao birthed one, one birthed two, two birthed three, and three birthed all things.

As the Dao foundation of a person, in the ancient era, the spirit bone was even called the immortal seed, the crux for becoming an immortal or god. Someone with a Spirit Bone was guaranteed to become a god or immortal as long as they didn’t die midway.

There were also many kinds of Spirit Bones. There were metal, wood, water, fire, earth, wind, lightning, light, dark, annihilation, devouring, and other powers. However, one Spirit Bone could only possess one kind of energy.

Amongst all those Spirit Bones though, there was one kind that transcended that restriction. It contained all manifestations of the world. Such a Spirit Bone was called the Supreme Spirit Bone, the strongest of all Spirit Bones, something that stood at the very apex.

BOOM!

The divine light smashed into the ancient zither, shaking the world. As a result, countless experts felt their bodies be viciously wrung, and they coughed up blood, turning pale with terror.

That attack had contained a supreme will. It was not just a clash of laws but also a clash of wills. Hence, everyone felt like their souls had been damaged.

A vein throbbed in Long Chen’s forehead, and killing intent boiled in his eyes. He was involuntarily quivering.

That aura was incredibly familiar to him. That Supreme Bone was his. It was a bare cruel hand that had extracted it from his body.

Moreover, Long Chen not only sensed the Supreme Bone, but he also saw a rainbow divine light. That divine light was his Supreme Spirit Blood, one containing all the manifestations of the world.

“Hahaha, The Dragon roars at the Heavens, looking down arrogantly on the mortal world of dust. My son Long Chen possesses a special Spirit Root, a divine Spirit Bone, and supreme Spirit Blood. He’ll definitely become a peak figure above the nine heavens, one who will arrogantly look down on all else! Hahaha…”

That clear and domineering laughter seemed to ring out in Long Chen’s mind once more. He had seen a portion of this scene with the help of Future Lake in the Eastern Wasteland.

At that time, his cultivation base was still low, allowing him to look back at a fragment in time. But as his cultivation base grew, it became impossible to even catch a glimpse of his past.UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

However, Long Chen was puzzled on one point. He had a divine Spirit Bone, but in Long Aotian’s hands, that innate divine spirit was gone, which turned it into the Supreme Bone.

Regardless, they were all his. Long Aotian had stolen his everything.

“Long Chen, control yourself! Sovereign Han Wei is doing this to help you uncover the mystery. You know him, but he doesn’t know you yet! That’s an advantageous position for you. If you can’t endure, Sovereign Han Wei’s efforts will be wasted. Furthermore, you’re still in the middle of your tribulation. Every bit of energy you save is a bit more chance you have of passing!” shouted Evilmoon, afraid of Long Chen going berserk.

It was extremely likely that Sovereign Han Wei was doing this for Long Chen, forcing Long Aotian to reveal his trump cards. If Long Chen went crazy, it wouldn’t be worth it.

“Evilmoon, you aren’t me. You don’t understand. If I could still endure at this point, I wouldn’t be Long Chen.”

Long Chen suddenly took a step, vanishing.

The void rumbled. Sovereign Han Wei’s ancient zither exploded along with Long Aotian’s divine light. Moreover, Sovereign Han Wei was actually sent flying back.

“What?! The Sovereign was defeated?!”

“Is Long Aotian stronger than a Sovereign?!”

Everyone was stunned by this result. Long Aotian was absolutely terrifying. This attack using his Supreme Bone shook heaven and earth.

“Long Aotian truly is powerful. However, he’s not necessarily stronger than a Sovereign,” said someone else.

“Why is that?”

“Long Aotian has a body of flesh, but the Sovereigns are nothing more than projections created by the heavens. They have no physical bodies. The Sovereigns also have Spirit Bones, but the Sovereigns that have manifested here are unable to utilize the same force of condensing their essence, qi, and spirit. However, I do have to admit that Long Aotian might be the strongest existence below a Sovereign,” sighed that person.

“What about Long Chen?”

“Most likely…” That person shook his head. Long Aotian was simply too powerful. With the appearance of a Supreme Bone, other than the Sovereigns, no one could compete against him.

BOOM!

Just at this moment, the void exploded and rainbow light blazed. The Nine Dragons Devour the Heavens Diagram behind Long Aotian had become rainbow-colored. The nine dragons were all different colors, and blood Qi erupted from them as if they were alive.

“I hereby announce that I, Long Aotian, am the sixth generation Sovereign! Starting today, follow me and prosper, defy me and die!” roared Long Aotian.

The current Long Aotian had used his Spirit Blood to activate his Nine Dragons Devour the Heavens Diagram. His Blood Qi shook everyone.

“You aren’t a Sovereign. You will only be one of the souls that die to my blade.”

An icy voice rang out within the thundering dragon roar. That was a voice that seemed to come from the depths of hell.

At this moment, a figure was reflected in people’s shocked eyes. It was a black figure with killing intent that shook the heavens. Long Chen had appeared in front of Long Aotian.
