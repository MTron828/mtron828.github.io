Chapter 4565 Violent Rage

The golden monkey charged at Long Chen in the middle of his fight with Xie Fei. Demonic qi erupted from it, and ancient runes danced along the length of its staff.

In the moment of its assault, its fur ignited, radiating a brilliance akin to a golden sun, engulfing the creature in a halo of light.

BOOM!

Having just exchanged blows with Xie Fei, Long Chen then swung his saber at the golden monkey in an attempt to block its attack. However, he was shocked to find that its power was several times greater than that of Xie Fei.

Long Chen had not expected this tiny little monkey to possess such terrifying power. With a grunt, he was sent flying, his arm almost numb. He almost lost hold of his saber.

“The Golden Fur Heaven Merging Monkey race is an extremely ancient species. If you underestimate it, you will suffer,” warned the Earth Cauldron.

The monkey with violet pupils shot after Long Chen once more, and golden light continued to blaze out of it, turning this world into a golden sea.

As Long Chen’s tendons unleashed a rumbling sound, golden dragon scales automatically covered him, and a sacred dragon might erupted.

The golden monkey’s Blood Qi had triggered Long Chen’s dragon blood. Resembling a sacred dragon that had been provoked, Long Chen’s dragon blood unleashed its fury.

“So you’re a descendant of the hateful dragon race! No wonder I already disliked you from the moment I saw you! Die right here and now!” The golden monkey’s eyes instantly grew bloodthirsty when it saw those dragon scales. It seemed as if it truly had a profound enmity with the dragon race.

“Die!”

The golden monkey bared its fangs, channeling a primal rage akin to avenging its fallen kin. With explosive force, it surged forward, charging at Long Chen like a blazing sun on the horizon.

In response, Long Chen raised his head and unleashed a resounding roar, infused with the primal fury of a dragon. The earth trembled under the weight of his power.

As specks of golden light danced in Long Chen’s eyes, his fury surged forth, enveloping him in the divine will of the dragon. In that moment, he transcended his humanity and embodied the essence of a dragon.

The true dragon lineage reigned supreme among all beastkind. Devil beasts, demonic beasts, spirit beasts, divine beasts, sacred beasts—any creature of the beast race instinctively bowed before the true dragons, compelled by an undeniable urge to submit.

Provoked by the golden monkey, Long Chen’s dragon blood stirred within him, unleashing his latent draconic power. The indomitable will of the true dragon filled his soul.

“A little monkey dares to challenge the might of the divine dragon?!” Long Chen roared, his voice resonating with a depth and majesty that echoed the authority of the dragon. The divine power of the dragon surged within him, raging against the audacity of the golden monkey.

“The dragon race has declined! Are you still lost in your past glory days? Your primal chaos Dragon Sovereign has been dead for countless years, and you think you still lead the beast world? It’s time for you to wake up from your dream!” sneered the crowned monkey, its staff smashing toward Long Chen with supreme divine might.

In front of that attack, Long Chen’s left hand turned into a claw, and a golden dragon claw stretched out of his divine ring at the same time.

BOOM! 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

The immense dragon claw was so huge that the monkey couldn’t dodge it, and it collided with the monkey head-on. However, to everyone’s surprise, the massive dragon claw erupted into a burst of energy, proving unable to contain the agile monkey’s movements.

“I already said that the true dragon race has declined. Your former grandeur is nothing but a memory. If you hadn’t unleashed the power of your bloodline, I wouldn’t have even sensed its feeble existence. It’s high time for the dragon race to relinquish its claim as the emperor of all beasts,” the monkey declared, its violet eyes flickering with a demonic light. Its voice resonated with arrogance and an overwhelming sense of dominance.

Long Chen was shocked to see his divine ability shattered. This monkey was truly terrifying, and it was Long Chen’s first time seeing an expert with such a terrifying bloodline.

Long Chen’s fury exploded in front of its taunting, and he sneered, “Even if the dragon race were to relinquish its throne, creatures like you have no place vying for such a position. Spare me your delusions. The human race has a saying, even if a monkey wears dragon robes, it won’t look like a noble. Do you think putting on a garbage crown makes you a king? Do you think some monkeys can be the ruler of the mountain even if the tigers are gone? Your kin can’t even beat the tiger race, and you want to contend with the dragon race? Don’t make me laugh!”

Each of Long Chen’s words was like a poison arrow stabbing the monkey’s heart. It instantly went berserk.

Just as Long Chen said, although the Golden Fur Heaven Merging Monkey race was shockingly powerful and ancient, with their lineage tracing back to the primal chaos era, they ranked surprisingly low among the divine beast races, not even placing within the top thirty.

That was because their power wasn’t extremely high. Instead, their fame stemmed from their extraordinary reproductive capabilities.

Aside from their sheer numbers, they relied on bloodline pressure to oversee those branches, resulting in them being extremely united. There had never been such a thing as a traitor in their ranks.

Moreover, their bloodline bestowed upon them a remarkable talent: the ability to control desolate beasts with low intelligence. This conferred a significant advantage in large-scale group battles, establishing their dominance on the battlefield.

However, they were ultimately unable to enter the top ranks of the beast race, so they were not qualified to fight for the position of emperor of the beast race.

Long Chen had inadvertently stabbed the monkey right where it hurt. In its berserk state, it roared and smashed its staff at Long Chen once more.

“Divine Dragon Tail Pendulum!” Long Chen shouted and unleashed a kick. At the same time, a golden dragon tail came out of his divine ring like a heavenly whip.

“Heaven Merging Staff!” the monkey roared, its fur exploding outward as a surge of explosive power coursed through its staff.

BOOM!

The staff blasted Long Chen’s Divine Dragon Tail Pendulum apart. Most terrifying of all, it continued toward Long Chen, seemingly not affected at all by his attack.

“The great Golden Fur Heaven Merging Monkey race isn’t an existence a lowly ant like you can judge!” The monkey let out a furious roar, its voice hoarse in its berserk state.

“Long Chen!”

Feng You was about to abandon all her enemies and rush over when a maiden in violet robes appeared in front of Long Chen.

This young maiden held a violet sword in her hands and swung it at the monkey.

She appeared silently, but when this sword fell, the entire world thundered, as if this world was instantly sucked into a heavenly tribulation.
