Chapter 3674 Making a Getaway

When Long Chen activated his Purgatory Eyes, the entire world turned dark. A dark, violent, murderous aura unfurled.

Even Guo Ran and Xia Chen felt cold. When Long Chen opened his Purgatory Eyes, it was like a devil from the depths of hell had come out. Moreover, this devil was overflowing with a desire to devour all life. It made people feel an innate fear.

“Three Flower Void Breaker!”

A three flower petal mark appeared in Long Chen’s left eye. As the flower petals spun, the space in front of Long Chen also spun with it. After that, the net made out of faith energy had a giant hole twisted into it by dark energy.

“How is this possible?!” Liao Bencang couldn’t help crying out in shock when he saw this. Even with his experience and knowledge, he didn’t dare to believe what he was seeing. Long Chen actually possessed a terrifying power that could suppress faith energy.

Long Chen activated the Purgatory Eyes through Bai Xiaole’s Three Flower Pupil techniques. Its power directly blew a hole through this indestructive faith net. Xia Chen and Guo Ran were delighted, but their expressions quickly changed.

“Boss!”

That was because Long Chen’s left eye was now bleeding. It looked horrifying.

“Run!”

Long Chen shut his left eye and opened his right eye. He shouted at the two of them.

Xia Chen had long since been prepared. As soon as they flew out of the net, he activated his formation disc. Divine light wrapped around them, and they instantly vanished.

Liao Bencang had been attacking Long Chen, but Xia Chen had helped him instantly move to the edge of the net, while Guo Ran blocked him.

The three of them then vanished as soon as they broke the net. It was seamless. Liao Bencang’s next attack only landed at this time, but it was already too late.RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

“How hateful!”

Liao Bencang cursed furiously. He had actually allowed the three of them to escape. Looking at the Nine Underworld Island that no longer had any islands, as well as his faith energy that was no longer very pure after using up so much of it, Liao Bencang’s face twisted with hatred.

“Long Chen, you little bastard! Just wait, this god will tear you into a million pieces!”

…

At this moment, Long Chen, Xia Chen, and Guo Ran came flying out of the void. All three of them coughed up blood. Although Liao Bencang’s attack hadn’t reached them, it had shattered the void, affecting Xia Chen’s instant transportation. Because of it, space was tearing at them, and they almost ended up in the chaotic flow of space. They were injured to various extents.

“That bastard, how is he so strong?!”

Guo Ran wiped some blood off of his mouth. His Supreme Bone was in so much pain that he couldn’t even lift it.

Although Guo Ran had heard Long Chen say that experts like Enpuda and Liao Bencang were not existences that they could currently handle, he had no idea that a single avatar from Liao Bencang would be able to make them flee so miserably. If Long Chen hadn’t broken the net, they would definitely have died today. Liao Bencang was so powerful that it was beyond reason.

Guo Ran had just obtained the Supreme Bone and the confidence that came with it, only to encounter Liao Bencang. Even half-step Divine Venerates were no longer placed within his eyes. He had thought that only true Divine Venerates could match him in combat, but now his confidence was torn down. That feeling was truly aggravating and painful.

Xia Chen also felt some lingering fear. He hadn’t expected a single World King to be terrifying to this extent as well. Liao Bencang was monstrous.

Long Chen took out an eyepatch and covered his left eye. He indifferently said, “There’s nothing to be surprised about. If they weren’t god cultivators, old fellows like Liao Bencang and Enpuda would have long since become Divine Venerates. Although their realms stagnate at the World King realm, their power is not at all inferior to Divine Venerates. They have been accumulating believers for tens of thousands of years, gathering faith energy. Did you think that they were doing that for nothing? That faith energy is the result of countless generations of people working together. Those people lay down the foundation for Liao Bencang. Every cultivator is like a tree. We can only see the surface of the tree but not the roots spreading beneath the ground. Liao Bencang might look like a World King on the surface, but his roots beneath the ground are thicker than even a Divine Venerate. Realm does not represent everything. If you view him as an ordinary Divine Venerate, would you feel better?”

Long Chen instantly felt a wave of relief in his left eye. The eyepatch that Bai Xiaole’s mother had made for him was truly effective.

This was Long Chen’s first time using the Purgatory Eyes like this. They possessed endless power, but they were different from Bai Xiaole’s Three Flower Pupils.

These Purgatory Eyes seemed to only be a window to the dark energy within him. They could unleash the dark energy, but condensing that dark energy into a divine ability would injure his eyes. Even now, Long Chen hadn’t figured out a better way to use the Purgatory Eyes.

Furthermore, using the Purgatory Eyes made him worried about awakening his heart-devil. Thus, he definitely wouldn’t use them unless he had no other choice.

This time, after using the Purgatory Eyes, he would need to rest this eye for a long time again. After a quick break to recover, Xia Chen brought them through several transportations before they found a safe location to rest.

Other than his eye, Long Chen’s wounds in this battle were nothing. However, within Liao Bencang’s domain, he was unable to unleash his full power, resulting in the fighting being very aggravating.

On the other hand, Guo Ran and Xia Chen’s injuries were rather heavy. Because Xia Chen was a talisman cultivator, his physical body was weaker. So, even with the support of his talismans, he was unable to block Liao Bencang’s power.

However, the one with the worst injuries was Guo Ran. In order to buy time for Long Chen, that Supreme Bone of his had almost been blown right off of his body. The runes on his body had grown loose.

Even so, Guo Ran was truly quite powerful. Relying on his own power, he managed to block Liao Bencang’s full-power attack. That was enough to be proud of.

Long Chen spent half a day before recovering. He then guarded the two of them as he refined more pills.

This battle gave Long Chen a sense of immense danger. Although he had thought that he had given Liao Bencang and Enpuda a high estimation of power, he was still shocked by Liao Bencang’s power.

Faith energy was practically cheating. The reason that they were able to flee this time was definitely greatly due to luck. There were two main things that contributed to their escape. One was that Liao Bencang had only come in an avatar, and the other was that his avatar hadn’t come with a World Domain divine item.

Long Chen didn’t know what kind of limitations there were for summoning this kind of avatar. If Liao Bencang had had a World Domain divine item at the time though, then even if all three of them had joined forces, they would have been killed with a single blow.

If Long Chen could summon his seven-color divine ring, he would be fearless in facing Liao Bencang’s faith energy. But in the end, it was too weak and was suppressed. The violet divine ring was crushed. After it was destroyed, the pressure on Long Chen was like a mountain. It was suffocating.

“It seems that as long as I can master the seven-color divine ring, I won’t need to fear his faith domain. I should hurry up.” Long Chen’s expression grew solemn. This battle with Liao Bencang gave him a sense of crisis.
