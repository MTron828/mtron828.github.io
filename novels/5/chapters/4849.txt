Chapter 4838 Twenty-First Martial Stage

Long Chen effortlessly killed Hu Yifei. People were shocked not only by the act of killing but also by how effortlessly Long Chen did it, as if he only killed a chicken.

While Hu Yifei might not be the strongest heavenly genius in Devil Fall City, he was definitely a well-known existence amongst the junior generation. However, he couldn’t struggle in the slightest against Long Chen. Even his most powerful attack was effortlessly crushed by Long Chen's bare hand, highlighting the vast power disparity between them.

After killing Hu Yifei, Long Chen then challenged the Iron Blood Gate’s Cao Shaoqing, the gate master’s grandson. The latter was someone with an illustrious status and unfathomable power.

“Heavens, just who is he?!” Only now did people realize that this black-robed youth might have a shocking background. In fact, he might even be here specifically to crush the Iron Blood Gate.

“Hopefully Cao Shaoqing accepts his challenge! Then these tickets will be really worth it!” An excited cry rang out and was echoed by the people throughout the crowd.

They had profited after seeing two fights occur today. If Cao Shaoqing were to join the fight, according to the martial stage’s rules, the battle could continue, and the spectators wouldn’t need to buy another ticket.

Long Chen waved his hand, causing his tablet to fly into the air. However, as he didn’t know how to activate the challenge function of the tablet, it just floated in midair. That wasn’t a problem though. Long Chen simply eyed Cao Shaoqing coldly. As long as he accepted the battle, his tablet would naturally be activated.

Everyone’s gaze concentrated on Cao Shaoqing. At this moment, Lu Ziqiong’s expression completely changed, and he hastily told Mo Nian, “You have to stop him! Cao Shaoqing possesses the Immemorial Blood Crocodile’s blood. His Blood Transformation Divine Technique has already reached—”

Mo Nian waved his hand to calm her down. “Rather than worrying about him, you should worry about that fellow Cao Shaoqing.”

“What?”

Lu Ziqiong and the others were in disbelief at what they had just heard. While Lu Ziqiong's intuition had hinted that Long Chen and Mo Nian were strong, she had only thought they would be slightly more powerful than her. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

She had invited them in hopes of forming a beneficial relationship with peers of comparable strength. Having spent her entire life in Devil Fall City without venturing beyond, she was eager to learn about the outside world from Long Chen and Mo Nian. They could then exchange insights about cultivation and the Dao.

However, she had misjudged. Long Chen was not just slightly stronger than her; he had effortlessly killed Hu Yifei with a wave of his hand. Moreover, he was now preparing to challenge Cao Shaoqing, whom Mo Nian believed Long Chen could defeat. How could they be so confident in themselves?

At this moment, Cao Shaoqing’s voice rang out. “As you wish.”

Cao Shaoqing's voice was akin to grating iron—hoarse yet resonant, capable of terrifying even the heavens. He waved his hand, unleashing a golden light that soared into the air.

“Heavens, that tablet has ten marks!” Sharp-eyed people instantly saw the ten golden marks on it.

Earlier, Mo Nian, Hu Yifei, and Lu Ziqiong had each displayed their own Golden Devil Fall Tablets, each bearing only a single golden mark. However, Cao Shaoqing's tablet boasted an impressive ten marks.

“Has he killed ten Heaven Saint devil creatures?! He’s a monster!”

“As expected of the peak heavenly genius of the Iron Blood Gate! Just his tablet alone is enough to terrify people!”

“This black-robed fellow is doomed.”

Just as people were discussing, the two tablets met each other, causing the void to quiver. Two rays of divine light shot out, enveloping Long Chen and Cao Shaoqing.

“What’s going on?”

Mo Nian was startled by what he saw. After all, such a thing didn’t occur when Long Chen and Hu Yifei clashed tablets.

Lu Ziqiong explained, “The level difference between their tablets is too vast, so the starry cloud formation is evaluating their power. If the power disparity is too vast, the star cloud formation won’t recognize this fight and they won’t be allowed to fight.”

“What? How humane. What exactly is this formation evaluating?” asked Mo Nian.

Lu Ziqiong said, “I’m not that sure. However, I’ve heard that the evaluation is extremely accurate. Different martial stages are selected based on the combatants' abilities. The chosen stage always matches the fighters perfectly, ensuring that their destructive power remains within the limits of the stage. As a result, it's very rare for any martial artist to take on any damage.”

“Then can it sense hidden power?” asked Mo Nian.

Lu Ziqiong and the others stared at him blankly. Clearly, they didn’t know too much about it, but according to their memories, the star cloud martial stage had almost never made any mistakes.

Lu Ziqiong said, “The star cloud martial stage calculates the combined power of the fighters to determine the most suitable stage. For instance, in my battle with Hu Yifei, the stage selected was based on our combined peak powers. When Hu Yifei challenged Long Chen, Long Chen's tablet was deemed too weak, so the stage remained unchanged. However, with Cao Shaoqing's tablet being much stronger, the stage is undergoing a new evaluation.”

Just then, the void quivered, and an ancient and emotionless voice rang out.

“The battle will be six hours from now on the twenty-first martial stage.”

“The twenty-first martial stage!”

Hearing that, the experts present became very excited, like a boiling pot.

“Lu Ziqiong and Hu Yifei’s fight only got them the thirty-seventh stage, but the formation picked the twenty-first stage for these two!”

“Doesn’t that mean that their power is far greater? Heavens, just how powerful are they?”

“It’s supposed to be based on both of their powers added together. Is it possible that it’s just Shao Caoqing who’s too strong?”

“You think Cao Shaoqing is going to kill this black-robed fellow like how this fellow killed Hu Yifei?”

Many discussions started, but Long Chen frowned in disappointment. He had anticipated the battle to commence immediately and hadn't expected a relocation and a six-hour delay.

Suddenly, Long Chen was transported away, and the star cloud martial stage vanished, causing a wave of outcry among the spectators.

“We need to buy new tickets!”

Those spectators hurriedly dispersed, scrambling to secure tickets again. However, with the news broadcast across the city, their chances of getting a seat were very remote.

At this moment, Lu Ziqiong went to Long Chen and bowed deeply. “Thank you.”

When Long Chen wanted to say some courteous words, the space beside them twisted, revealing a figure. Seeing it, Lu Ziqiong and the other disciples of the Lu family hastily bowed.

“Greetings, Vice Sect Master.”
