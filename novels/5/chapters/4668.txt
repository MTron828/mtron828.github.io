Chapter 4657 You Know How to Play

Long Chen’s lightning wings tore through the void as he chased after Yan Tianhua.

“In the end, these lightning wings are still slower than the Kunpeng wings. It’s too bad that they were gone. If I have a chance, I’ll get another pair. It’s not convenient to not be able to catch up.” Nnêw n0vel chapters are published on n0v/e/(lb)i(n.)co/m

Long Chen was chasing him at full power, but he was getting further and further away. If it weren’t for Lei Linger locking onto that fellow, he would have gotten lost long ago.

Thankfully, Yan Tianhua left a trail of devastation in his wake. Wherever the air had been struck by his terrifying heavenly tribulation, space became unstable. While this made it relatively easy to track him, Long Chen couldn’t use any spatial transportation to catch up to him.

On the way, he saw countless people roaring and cursing Yan Tianhua, but there was nothing they could do.

These people were too stunned. With their tribulations taken, they just couldn’t calm down and think. Long Chen was only able to devise a solution because he was not personally affected by the situation. If his own tribulation had been stolen, he wouldn’t have been able to remain composed and think things through either.

Long Chen was on a crazy chase for three days and nights. All of a sudden, he could see endless tribulation clouds around him.

The clouds were slowly gathering into a giant vortex of clouds. Long Chen had to fly for a day before reaching the core of the vortex.

“There really is a scheme here.”

Specks of divine light shone like twinkling stars within the core—a sign that lightning was accumulating inside the clouds. Clearly, many people were preparing for their tribulations here, not just one.

Long Chen flew over. As he got closer, he saw hundreds of spheres of light at the heart of the vortex. These spheres of light were like sesame seeds within these enormous tribulation clouds. However, in reality, these spheres were many times larger than the result of the Dragonblood Legion’s collective tribulation.

These spheres of light were absorbing energy from the enormous vortex to strengthen themselves.

Upon closer inspection, Long Chen noticed that each sphere of light contained a person, except for one that housed a white bone horse and a bronze chariot.

“It’s him!”

Long Chen was startled. He instantly recognized the fellow who had been the first to enter the Fantasy Spirit World, only for Long Chen to drag him out. With an X-shaped scar on his face and a scarlet broadsword on his back, he was easily identifiable.

He wasn’t undergoing the tribulation alone; his horse and chariot were also within it. Were they planning on undergoing tribulation together?

Long Chen then realized that countless experts had gathered here, spreading around the core region’s edges. They had set up formations and barriers to protect themselves.

“Are they just spectators? No, they’re probably on the same side as the people undergoing tribulations. They’re their guards.” Long Chen instantly noticed that these people had gone through their own tribulations. They were all Divine Venerates.

These Divine Venerates hailed from various races, forming a blockade around the core region. As soon as Long Chen appeared, he instantly drew the attention of countless experts.

“Where did this idiot come from? Did you come to throw your life away?” shouted one of those guards.

“The human race really is stupid. Do you think you can just come here and stroll around?” sneered an expert from the demon race.

There were humans among the guards as well, and his words were directed toward them.

“Idiot, do you know who he is? You shouldn’t spout big words before thinking,” sneered a human expert, clearly knowing Long Chen’s identity.

“What a joke. Is there anyone in the human race worth remembering? We don’t even care about you people, so why would we care about this little thing?” mocked the demon expert.

“You are hopelessly stupid to not even recognize this era’s number one genius, Long Chen. He’s from the number one academy in the world. Are you blind or deaf? Have you never heard of him?” asked the human expert.

“Number one? That’s dogshit. Your human race only knows how to brag,” sneered the demon expert.

“He is not only the High Firmament Academy’s number one expert of this generation but also the number one expert of the human race. You are merely mice in front of him,” sneered the human expert.

At first, Long Chen felt flattered, thinking this person was praising him out of admiration. However, as the conversation progressed, the tone shifted. It became apparent that this individual was setting him up as a target, exaggerating his status as “number one” in various aspects. He was quite sinister.

Despite the brewing tension, Long Chen boldly approached the core region, displaying a brazen attitude. He flew past the guards, drawing immediate attention from those within the core.

“Long Chen!”

Originally, these people had their eyes closed and were waiting for their tribulations to come. However, when they sensed Long Chen, they all shouted his name.

Their voices were not friendly at all, startling the guards, causing the human expert who had bragged for Long Chen to jump in fright.

The ones shouting gritted their teeth with rage, their voices dripping with bloodthirst as if there was some immense enmity between them.

“Wow, so many friends here!” Feeling the dense killing intent, Long Chen was surprised to sense several familiar auras.

“Long Chen, you goddamn bastard, die!”

As this furious roar rang out, a ray of divine light shot out of a sphere of light. It was a lightning sword that contained the power of heavenly tribulation.

This attack might not be that strong, but it had one crucial aspect: once it struck, the victim would be locked by the heavenly tribulation and forced to undergo tribulation whether they wanted to or not.

This person was none other than Yu Zihao, the individual whom Long Chen had duped out of countless medicinal ingredients. He nearly bankrupted himself without any reward in the end.

This arrogant disciple of Lord Brahma glared with such intensity as if Long Chen had murdered his father and desecrated his grave. His gaze seemed to yearn for Long Chen’s flesh while he still drew breath.

As the lightning attack approached, many expected Long Chen to evade it. Instead, he simply waved his hand casually.

BOOM!

His palm blew the lightning sword apart.

“You really know how to play! Let me join!” Long Chen smiled.
