Chapter 3226 Secret of the Violet Blood

The treasured saber Violet Fern was matched by its sheath. They were one set and complemented each other, so they had to be together to unleash their greatest power.

However, Luo Zichuan had only brought the saber, not the sheath. That made Luo Changwu feel uneasy.

Luo Zichuan had previously told him and his big brother that Violet Fern’s sheath had the life teachings of his Saber Dao. If something happened to him, those teachings must be transmitted to future generations.

Hearing that, Long Chen was startled. “Where did the family head go?”

Luo Changwu shook his head. “Father never tells us what he’s doing. But if my guess is correct, he has gone to that place.”

“Where?” pressed Long Chen.

Luo Changwu hesitated. In the end, he sighed and said, “Father did say that you can be trusted. The Luo family doesn’t need to keep any secrets from you. Fine, I’ll tell you. This relates to the secrets of the Luo family…”

Luo Changwu told Long Chen a story that made his heart pound. The Luo family was originally the grand and famous Violet Blood race of ancient times, an existence on par with the Jiuli and Heavenly Eye races.

Before each family head died, they would always transmit a secret that was kept from others. That secret was that the Luo family was nothing more than a tiny weak branch of the Violet Blood race.

The true Violet Blood race was trapped in a danger zone. But before being trapped, they managed to send out a small group of their people with lower quality bloodlines. After that, those people ended up scattered throughout the immortal world.

Many people in the immortal world possessed a trace of the Violet Blood race’s bloodline. However, over time, that trace had been diluted to the point that it could be considered nonexistent.

Thus, the people from the Violet Blood race that had been sent out silently merged with the rest of the immortal world.

As for the Luo family, it began with one of those people. For millions of years, they had one mission, and that was to save the Violet Blood race that was trapped in the danger zone.

The crux to saving them was to restore their ancestral violet blood. According to Luo Zichuan, Luo Ningshuang was their only hope of saving the Violet Blood race.

However, Luo Ningshuang rebelled against this, secretly going to the lower plane and having a child there. That was why Luo Zichuan was so infuriated that he imprisoned her.

These were all secrets of the Luo family. The only ones who knew of them were Luo Zichuan, Luo Changwu, and Luo Changwen. Now there was a fourth person who knew of it.

The reason why Luo Changwu told Long Chen these things was because he felt that since his father had elevated Long Chen to the most trustworthy position, there must be some deeper meaning. So while he hesitated, he still told him.

Hearing this, Long Chen understood just why Luo Zichuan had such an urge to kill him. This truly was related to important matters.

Luo Ningshuang was the only hope of the Luo family. As a result of an accident arising from many factors, a string of karma was formed and bound.

Luo Zichuan was about to succeed in the mission that the Luo family had been entrusted to for millions of years, only for the stubbornness of a single woman to ruin all those efforts. How could he not be angry?

Long Chen had truly hated Luo Zichuan at first. After learning all this, he could only bitterly smile. If he was Luo Zichuan, what would he do?

“I worry that my father is unable to wait that long and has gone there. Although his bloodline is the purest of the current Luo family, and his power is unsurpassed, he has not reached the point of reviving the ancestral bloodline, nor has he awakened the violet blood divine abilities. I’m afraid…” Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

“Senior is worrying too much. Someone as wise as the family head won’t sacrifice a body that still has a use for no reason. The family said that he was going on a trip to resolve his old grudges. That doesn’t necessarily refer to this matter. It’s very likely his own personal grudges,” said Long Chen. All he could do was comfort Luo Changwu.

In truth, he was also very worried. But considering Luo Zichuan’s wisdom, Long Chen didn’t really believe that he would do such a foolish thing. He must have another reason for leaving.

Furthermore, for him to tell Luo Changwu that Long Chen could be trusted to this extent, it was essentially entrusting the Luo family to him.

Even so, Long Chen still didn’t have a good feeling. The fact that Luo Zichuan had transmitted his life’s teachings to him probably wasn’t a good omen.

However, he had already gone. Luo Changwu didn’t even know where the danger zone that the Violet Blood race was trapped in was, so panic and worry wouldn’t have any use.

“If my mother made a mistake, I will take care of it. I need to find Long Aotian and see if I can restore my violet blood.”

Just as Long Chen had this thought, he had another thought. If he restored his violet blood, what would happen to his dragon blood? Would they clash?

Long Chen felt a headache. The matter of the Luo family was too complicated. It wasn’t something that he could figure out now, so he could only take things step by step.

Fortunately, he felt that someone with Luo Zichuan’s wisdom wouldn’t put his mother in any real danger. That made him temporarily at ease.

“Senior…” said Long Chen.

“Don’t call me senior. It would make us feel distant. I’m only a bit older than you. You can call me big brother,” said Luo Changwu.

What? If the seniority was messed up to that extent, wouldn’t his mother beat him? Long Chen hastily said, “I feel like martial-uncle would be best.”

Actually, Long Chen should call him uncle. But at least this way, the seniority was not a mess.

“Martial-uncle, since the family head trusts me to this extent, I must treat the Luo family as my own family. So let us talk frankly. I wish to know exactly how strong the Luo family is,” said Long Chen.

Luo Changwu said, “I’m ashamed to say it, but our Luo family has always been dependent on father. He is the only Immortal King. Including myself and my big brother, there are eleven peak Divine Lords with awakened primal bloodlines. But even after so many years, none of us are able to take the final step. If junior sister was present, with her talent, she would have long since reached the Immortal King realm. With two Immortal Kings, father probably wouldn’t have it so tough.”

Luo Changwu was ashamed. He and his brother wished to share his father’s burden and step into the Immortal King realm. Unfortunately, the barrier to that realm was like a heavenly chasm that firmly blocked them, not allowing them to see any hope of crossing it.

The Luo family had eleven Primal Divine Lords, five hundred ordinary Divine Lords, and forty-six Four Peak Primals. In truth, that foundation was very powerful. Outsiders were unaware of just how many Primals they had.

To the outside world, the Luo family had no Primal Divine Lords and only had six Four Peak Primals such as Luo Xue and Luo Qing. The rest were kept hidden.

However, Four Peak Primals in the Heavenly Swell Domain had great difficulty maintaining their primal bloodlines when attacking the Divine Lord realm. Only a few were able to luckily maintain their primal bloodlines.

As for Luo Changwu and Luo Changwen, the reason that they were able to maintain their primal bloodline was because Luo Zichuan had protected them. It was said that Luo Zichuan had paid quite the price for that.

“Martial-uncle, pick out six hundred elite disciples. I’ll help them awaken their primal bloodlines,” said Long Chen.

“What?!”

Luo Changwu jumped in shock. He didn’t dare to believe his ears.
