Chapter 2749 Nine Dragon Slaughter

As soon as Long Aotian attacked, the other experts of the divine families entered the formation, completely sealing this place.

At the same time, Long Chen waved his hand, and Lei Linger transformed into a lightning blade similar to Evilmoon in his hand.

BOOM!

When Long Chen slashed his saber, lightning exploded and the ground beneath his feet quaked. The palace began to crumble.

This grand palace was the divine families’ ancestral palace. It had countless formations and restrictions around it. Even in Long Zhantian’s battle back then, when he slaughtered the divine families’ experts, this palace had managed to survive.

However, now the palace was crumbling, unable to endure this power. The powerful winds forced the other experts to retreat.

Long Chen was blocking Long Aotian’s spear with his lightning blade. Meanwhile, countless stars lit up within his divine ring. No matter how Long Aotian tried, he was unable to shake Long Chen.

“Do you know pain now? Anger? Resentment? No, this isn’t enough. This is far from enough. Back then, my father had clearly reached the realm of a Saint, but due to your father’s insidious sneak attack, his realm was forcibly suppressed to the ninth Heavenstage. If it weren’t for that bastard playing the family card, causing my father to be softhearted, could the divine families have ever suppressed him? His realm was suppressed and his entire family betrayed him. His son’s very life was in question. Just how much anger must he have felt at that time? Just how much resentment must he have felt?” Long Chen’s voice was icy at the start, but it grew more emotional toward the end, until he was in a furious rage.

He hadn’t witnessed the battle back then. Everything he knew was from the Heaven Executioner’s mouth. But it felt as if it was happening right now.

His father and mother had bled for him right in this place. They had suffered here. It felt as if he had returned to that year. He could almost see his parents’ fury and their helplessness.

BOOM!

Long Aotian couldn’t endure it any longer and was gradually being forced back by Long Chen’s rising torrential aura. With every step back, the void exploded.

All the divine families’ experts were stunned. Long Chen was clearly only at the ninth Heavenstage, and yet he could force back Long Aotian who was already a half-step Emperor.

“My cultivation base is still in the ninth Heavenstage. Today, I will represent my father in getting justice from the divine families.”

Finally, Long Chen’s power erupted, and Long Aotian was no longer able to endure. He was sent flying.

The divine families’ Saints immediately attacked, using their sharpest, most ruthless attacks all together.

BOOM!

Long Chen sneered. At this moment, starlight appeared on his lightning blade. With a single slash, those three Saints’ attacks crumbled and the three of them coughed up blood.

“The wounds my father inflicted on you have yet to heal even now? If you’re so useless, what’s the point of you living?”

As Long Chen stepped toward those three Saints, their expressions completely changed. Long Chen was even more terrifying than Long Zhantian. He had locked them down with his Spiritual Strength.

BOOM!

Suddenly, a ray of divine light shot out from their grand formation. However, it had just appeared before it was shattered.

The three elders used that opportunity to escape his lock. However, they had just moved when one of them had his head cut off by Long Chen’s blade.

His head fell to the ground, his soul destroyed. One of the ringleaders of that matter back then was executed just like that. After that, Long Chen walked toward the other two.

All the divine families’ experts were dumbfounded. They had originally been thinking that together, they would instantly slaughter Long Chen. They had millions of Heaven Merging experts, with over eight hundred thousand being in the late stage. With these numbers, they could at least slowly crush him.

In fact, they had even thought that with Long Aotian present, he would be able to directly kill Long Chen with no outside help. However, even as a half-step Emperor, Long Aotian was not able to match Long Chen’s power at the ninth Heavenstage.

At this moment, a starry sword suddenly slashed down from the heavens, and the sharp will of the Sword Dao appeared. It was Ye Liangchen unleashing his strongest attack.

“When it comes to astral power, you don’t understand any of the profundities. When it comes to the Sword Dao, all you are is a copy. Yet you still think of trying to merge them?” Long Chen snorted, and without even looking back, he raised his palm behind him. A star diagram then appeared in his palm, and he caught Ye Liangchen’s divine sword barehanded.

BOOM!

Just like that, his palm collided against Ye Liangchen’s divine star sword. As the power of Long Chen’s stars erupted, Ye Liangchen’s sword instantly shattered. Even his sword arm was destroyed. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

After blocking Ye Liangchen with his left hand, Long Chen’s right hand swung the lightning blade at the other Saint. That Saint that was doing his best to flee had his head severed.

One head soared into the air with an unreconciled expression. A generation’s Saint died just like that.

Feng Fei and Jiang Wuchen’s attacks came at that moment. Looking at them, Long Chen snorted and swung his blade. As a result, both of them were sent flying, coughing up blood.

“How can this be?!”

Jiang Wuchen felt a mix of shock and rage. He had recently become a Saint and thought that with his Heaven Merging power, he would be able to beat Long Chen.

However, despite their difference in realm growing greater, their difference in power also grew more and more. No matter how he trained, he was unable to prevent Long Chen from creating a giant gap between them.

In their first battle, he had been able to fight Long Chen. Now that he had advanced to the Saint realm, with his cultivation base surpassing Long Chen, he couldn’t receive a single blow from the latter.

Feng Fei was pale. The majority of Long Chen’s attack just now had been blocked by Jiang Wuchen, but she was still injured.

It was because she was a soul cultivator. Long Chen’s attack contained a supreme will that damaged her soul.

The final member of the three Saints of the divine families fled. However, just as he was about to enter the crowd, Long Chen raised his hand and the world froze. Following that, the old Saint involuntarily flew toward Long Chen.

“No!”

The Saint cried out in terror as he involuntarily flew back at Long Chen. Long Chen’s lightning blade then swung through the air, aiming for his neck.

The lightning blade met his neck, turning him into a corpse. It wasn’t just his physical body that was killed, but his soul was also sliced through. All the Saints that had fought Long Zhantian back then were now dead.

“Emperor Blood Devouring, Nine Dragon Slaughter!”

Suddenly, an illusory image of an Emperor’s crown appeared on Long Aotian’s head, and his body split into nine. His manifestation’s nine dragons flew toward Long Chen.

After that, the nine Long Aotians vanished, merging into the nine dragons. Right now, the formations of the divine families shuddered. This attack had sucked away the power of this entire world.

Ye Liangchen and the others turned pale, hastily retreating to avoid being sucked into this terrifying attack.

“Long Chen! Die!”

Long Aotian roared furiously. The nine dragons smashed into Long Chen from nine different directions, striking him like meteors.
