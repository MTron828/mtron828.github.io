Chapter 4744 Assassin Sneak Attack

The moment Long Chen moved, an ear-piercing alarm spread throughout the High Firmament Academy. After that, barriers started to rise within the grand formation.

BOOM!

However, those barriers had just appeared when a sword tore through the sky, piercing through the barriers.

“What?!”

Long Chen and Bai Zhantang’s hearts shook as they knew only a Sage King could pierce the academy’s barriers in one move. Both of them had a bad feeling.

“Violet-gold assassins!”

With the barrier pierced through, a translucent figure shot through and was met by Dragonbone Evilmoon.

BOOM!

Long Chen’s strike sent that figure flying back, but he was also knocked back by that person’s power, and he almost spat out blood.

“The target has appeared!” shouted the translucent figure. Following that, ripples spread through the void, revealing fifteen figures in the surroundings.

When they emerged, a powerful divine pressure crashed down, emanating the auras of Sage Kings. Long Chen was instantly locked down by these sixteen experts.

Under the combined pressure of sixteen Sage Kings, Long Chen felt as though a star was bearing down on him, causing his bones to creak. If he were an ordinary Divine Venerate, he would have been flattened instantaneously.

“Kill the first target, then search for the second target! End this battle quickly!” ordered one of the Sage Kings.

Sixteen sharp swords sliced through the air, aimed at Long Chen.

“Are you treating me as nothing more than thin air?!” A furious roar echoed as Bai Zhantang charged forward. Despite him and Long Chen advancing together, they completely disregarded his presence. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

One of the sixteen figures broke away from the group and scattered countless afterimages across the sky, making it impossible to discern the real one.

“Leave him to me!” shouted that person. Among the countless images, one suddenly materialized in front of Bai Zhantang, thrusting a sword toward his throat.

“Fuck off!” Bai Zhantang bellowed, unleashing a wild aura. The pressure of a Sage King emanated from him as his broadsword swung toward his opponent.

BOOM!

After two divine weapons collided, the Sage King assassin instantly vomited blood.

“A sealed cultivation base?” That Sage King was shocked and enraged.

“Hundred Ghost Seal - Release!” Bai Zhantang roared, and countless runes appeared around him like chains, and following his roar, they shattered.

A strange creature with long hair cascading to its feet, two horns on its head, and ancient robes emerged behind him. Ghostly qi permeated the surroundings, giving the impression that this place had transformed into the underworld.

When Bai Zhantang’s seal was undone, his power surged forth like water from an opened dam. A wild qi wave then blew away the clouds.

“There’s actually a hidden expert here!” Those Sage Kings were startled by Bai Zhantang’s power. “Kill him first!”

Just then, a resplendent dragon cry echoed through the air, accompanied by a surge of Blood Qi that filled the sky. Long Chen emerged with a long blood-colored cloak fluttering behind him.

“I was wondering how you came so fast. Did you sprint over here after my father decimated your comrades, leaving you shaking in your boots?” Long Chen taunted, casually resting Evilmoon on his shoulder as he regarded the Sage King assassins with disdain.

“Now is the moment! If we can’t get to the second objective, we’ll carry out our first one!” shouted their leader.

The group of sixteen divided their forces: ten of them lunged at Long Chen, while the remaining six headed toward Bai Zhantang.

“Are you looking down on me? Die!” Seeing only six of them come at him, Bai Zhantang was provoked. His broadsword smashed toward those six Sage King assassins.

As he attacked, the long-haired monstrosity behind him opened its mouth, emitting an ear-piercing scream that shook even Long Chen’s soul.

BOOM!

Bai Zhantang’s broadsword fell, sending the six of them hurtling through the air, blood oozing from their mouths. They were horrified.

A single scream from the monster behind Bai Zhantang shook their souls so much that they almost left their bodies. Fortunately, they were strong and reacted fast enough, dragging their souls back in. Otherwise, they would have died just now.

Meanwhile, on Long Chen’s side, ten sharp swords were attacking him in unison, and Dragonbone Evilmoon danced through the air. In the blink of an eye, they clashed over a thousand times. These ten Sage Kings were attacking according to a set formation, and their swords always came from different angles and different timings. Their cooperation was flawless.

Evilmoon howled through the air, blocking all their swords. However, these ten Sage Kings completely trapped Long Chen.

Bai Zhantang wasn’t doing too well either. Although he had taken the initiative at the start, the six of them quickly recovered and started to push him back.

Bai Zhantang's frustration was evident. It appeared that he rarely encountered coordinated attacks that hindered his ability to unleash his full power, prompting him to shout in anger. "They're resorting to this tactic?!"

Just then, the High Firmament Academy’s grand formation started to ripple, and one translucent figure after another appeared. To Bai Zhantang’s astonishment, these people were all nine star Heavenly Doyens, and there were around hundreds of thousands of them.

“Not good!” Just as Bai Zhantang was about to stop them, the six Sage King assassins blocked him again.

“Long Chen, they’re luring the tiger from the mountain! They’re after the academy’s foundation!” shouted Bai Zhantang. He had misread these people’s intentions.

“Destroy the academy’s foundation? You’re overestimating them,” replied Long Chen contemptuously. Looking at the tide of Heavenly Doyens, Long Chen sneered. How much of a ripple could a group of fake Doyens cause?

Just then, one figure after another flew out of the inner academy, attacking the nine star Doyens. In just a moment, blood cascaded down from the sky.

“The Dragonblood Legion is present! If you’re not afraid of dying, come at us!” The Dragonblood warriors’ roars shook the world.
