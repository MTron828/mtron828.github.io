Chapter 3182 Fiendish Power

The rune glowed with all the colors of the rainbow as it struggled. However, blood sprayed out of Bai Shishi’s hand, speckling her white clothes.

She held on to that rune as if her life depended on it because she could sense the boundless metal energy within it. This time, Long Chen didn’t con her. This rune was something she dreamed of obtaining.

“Quickly use your will to subdue it. Time is running out!” shouted Long Chen. After over ten breaths, Bai Shishi was still unable to suppress it. Feeling that the situation wasn’t good, he gave her a reminder.

However, there was no need for that reminder. She was already doing everything she could. But this rainbow rune that existed only in legend contained the will of the Heavenly Daos and was very difficult to subdue.

After a long struggle, her hand was bloody, but the rune had merged into her body. It left behind a seven-color mark on her palm.

Bai Shishi was delighted, but she suddenly heard Long Chen’s shout. “Left side”!

Without even thinking, she reached out and her left hand grabbed something. At this moment, the void shuddered and another rune appeared.

Startled cries rang out. When that rune merged into her body, it emitted a violet color. That was actually a rank seven Heavenly Dao rune.

It also glowed brightly and tried to struggle away, but compared to the peak rank rune, it was clearly a bit weaker. As a result, Bai Shishi’s body trembled, but she wasn’t injured further.

She struggled with all her might to subdue it, but it refused to submit. The furious struggle left people holding their breath.

The heavenly tribulation was already starting to scatter. Time was running out.

This showed them that this wasn’t just luck. Without power, even if an opportunity threw itself into your hand, you wouldn’t be able to grasp it.

Ignoring that peak rank rune, even a rank seven rune wasn’t something that normal cultivators could subdue even if they were given the full time of the tribulation.

Thus, greed was useless without power. Forcibly trying to grasp it would only harm yourself. Even Bai Shishi, with her terrifying power, was having immense trouble.

Just as everyone thought that as long as they could have Long Chen’s pointers, they could also gain the best Heavenly Dao runes, that thought was erased.

The second rune was finally subdued. However, the tribulation shuddered and the runes began to fade.

However, just then, Bai Shishi spread both her hands and grabbed two runes. Both those runes flashed with azure light and were subdued.

In the last instant, Bai Shishi had just barely managed to grab two more runes, and they were actually rank five runes. That was also fortuitous.

Another rank seven or even rank six rune would resist. She didn’t have enough time to subdue them. But with her power, she could instantly subdue a rank five rune and below.

Rank five runes were the best choice for her in that last moment. In that last moment, one of those runes was one that she had sensed beforehand and been ready to grab, but the other one was just a random grab. She was lucky that it was also a rank five rune.

The heavenly tribulation scattered and Bai Shishi sighed with relief. However, she felt a wave of fatigue. It felt like she might collapse.

The Heaven Female Alliance’s disciples hastily ran over to support her. She was pale as she had clearly used up all her energy, but an excited light shone in her eyes.

“Long Chen, thank you.” Helped by everyone, Bai Shishi came over to Long Chen.

When that peak rank rune entered her body, she clearly sensed her bloodline runes changing. Her sense toward the world’s metal energy was hundreds of times clearer than before.

Furthermore, her own metal energy was undergoing some kind of transformation. She wasn’t clear on what it was exactly, but she had a feeling that once she finished merging with this rune and formally entered the Four Peak realm, her power would completely transform.

A peak rank metal energy rune and a rank seven spiritual energy rune. Those were both thanks to Long Chen. That was truly an immense favor.

Long Chen smiled. “I like to talk nonsense. There’s no need to thank me if that nonsense was correct. I just hope that you won’t kill me when my nonsense is wrong in the future.”

Quite a few people laughed. Just before this, Bai Shishi had said that she would kill him if he continued spouting nonsense.

Bai Shishi’s expression sank. Seeing her expression, Long Chen hastily waved his hand. “We’re all friends. It’s just a joke. If you get so angry, I won’t dare to talk to you again. What were the two last runes at the end? I didn’t get a clear look.”

After hearing that, Bai Shishi’s expression softened. After knowing Long Chen for so long, she found him to be a foolish fellow who liked to joke, but he never had any malice.

She said, “One is a bloodline rune. The other though, ugh. It’s an earth element rune.”

The bloodline rune could strengthen her physical body. But that earth element rune was difficult to bear. She was a pure metal cultivator, so that earth rune was useless to her. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

“An earth element rune is good,” said Long Chen and Bai Shishi’s mother at the same time.

“What? How?”

Bai Shishi’s mother was the one who said, “Foolish child, other than cultivating, did you not study anything? Metal is born from the earth. The two complement each other. With this earth energy, your metal energy will be thicker and easier to control.”

Long Chen said, “With this earth energy, your metal energy will have that trace of softness that you lack. To use the words of the common people, it will make you down-to-earth.”

Bai Shishi laughed at that. For both Long Chen and her mother to like this earth energy rune so much, it seemed that it really was valuable. Hence, her mood improved.

“Long Chen, how did you see through the Heavenly Dao runes? Could it be that your eyes- ah, sorry,” said Bai Shishi, hastily apologizing when she saw that Long Chen was still wearing an eyepatch.

His eye was still injured from using the Three Flower Pupils. Bai Shishi had secretly asked Bai Xiaole’s mother about it, and the latter told her that Long Chen had forcibly exceeded his own limits to use that eye art, and he had received a backlash from the Heavenly Daos. There was even danger of him losing the eye.

Everyone had stopped talking about his eye in order to not pain his heart. But she had forgotten about it just now in her excitement.

Long Chen laughed, “What are you thinking? This eye will be fine after some more rest. There’s no need to be worried. The reason I could sense the lightning runes was because from the very first day I set foot in the cultivation world, I’ve been in contact with heavenly tribulation the entire time. We’re old acquaintances. I should be the one saying sorry. I didn’t expect that your will was so weak that you almost got conned.”

Bai Shishi glared at him. But after what she had said about his eye, she also didn’t feel good retorting.

In a bit, everyone scattered. However, Bai Shishi’s mother had Long Chen remain.

“Did you sense that fiendish power?”
