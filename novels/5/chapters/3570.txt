Chapter 3559

The rune on Yan Hong’s forehead was pierced through by the Ice Soul energy and shattered instantly.

Long Chen had been waiting a long time for this chance, having tried countless times to kill Yan Hong. His violet qi might be able to harm Yan Hong, but it was unable to kill him.

Yan Hong was a flame body, so other energies were unable to cause him substantial wounds. Even Long Chen’s violet qi was unable to do so.

Flames either had to be extinguished with water energy or overwhelmed with flame energy. The only thing that Long Chen had in his hands that could possibly kill Yan Hong was that trace of Ice Soul energy.

However, this trace of Ice Soul energy wasn’t very powerful. It was not the true Ice Soul Divine Flame. If he had used it at the start, it wouldn’t necessarily be able to threaten Yan Hong.

It was another story now though. Yan Hong's core energy was exhausted, so he had no choice but to summon the final dregs of his energy in the form of this rune. Long Chen’s chance was finally here.

After Yan Hong was wiped out by this attack, a flame dragon appeared and devoured Yan Hong’s core runes.

In order to kill Yan Hong, all the food that was stored for Huo Linger had been exhausted. Hence, Huo Linger naturally wouldn’t let off Yan Hong’s flames. She devoured it, treating it as a kind of compensation.

Yan Hong was slain, dumbfounding countless experts. The battle might have ended, but there were still endless flames burning. They didn’t dissipate for a long time.

“Yan Xu’s son was slain?”

All the experts that had entered the Heavenly Flame World were filled with disbelief.

“He… he was Yan Xu’s son?!”

“Long Chen killed Yan Xu’s son?!”

An uproar exploded. Yan Xu was called the Flame Sovereign, the strongest flame of the nine heavens and ten lands, as well as the most evil flame. The senior generation all knew of him.

However, there were many branches of Yan Xu Flames, so no one had expected that the one Long Chen just killed would be the Flame Sovereign’s son. People then stared at Long Chen in shock and terror.

Long Chen had killed the Flame Sovereign’s son. That was a huge calamity for him. Who could withstand the wrath of the Flame Sovereign? Would there be a place for Long Chen to hide in the nine heavens and ten lands? Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

Some people even began to leave for fear that the Flame Sovereign would suddenly descend and they would be implicated by Long Chen. Perhaps the entire Chaotic Star Sea was going to be destroyed.

Long Chen suddenly spat out a mouthful of blood. After repeated battles, he had used up too much energy.

Summoning the Starry Sea Births Violet Qi manifestation had caused his power to soar, but it had put an immense burden on his body as well. The current him still had some difficulty summoning it.

Furthermore, he had also summoned astral energy from outside his body. That was not his energy, and forcibly using it had caused him injury. Moreover, this kind of injury was something that not even the primal chaos bead could immediately heal.

He had been suppressing his wounds the entire time just to kill Yan Hong. Now that the latter was dead, he could no longer endure anymore and spat out blood.

Lightning wings appeared on his back. If he didn’t leave now, it would be too late. Those late stage World Kings were like tigers watching their prey. Before they recovered from their shock, he had to flee.

Fortunately, while Long Chen and Huo Linger were completely exhausted, Lei Linger still had plenty of power. He could flee at full speed. Then not even these late stage World Kings could catch up to him.

But all of a sudden, startled cries rang out in the distance. Long Chen looked in that direction and instantly froze.

“You are courting death!”

Just then, a furious roar rang out. People looked over and didn’t dare to believe their eyes.

The master of the Raging Flame Heavenly Palace had appeared behind Yu Qingxuan at some point. Those two protectors by her side had been sent flying.

That palace master then pointed his sword at Yu Qingxuan’s back. Yu Qingxuan’s life was in his hands. Seeing this, everyone was dumbfounded.

“Has he gone mad?! Does he not know that Yu Qingxuan’s master is Dongfang Zichu?! That’s a Divine Venerate!” People stared in disbelief at him.

Just how illustrious was Yu Qingxuan’s status? He dared to use her as a hostage? Was he not afraid of Dongfang Zichu’s wrath? His entire Raging Flame Heavenly Palace would be destroyed!

“Long Chen, should you dare to leave, I will kill her!” The palace master looked at Long Chen with a sinister smile.

“Despicable!”

“Shameless!”

Countless people roared furiously when they saw this.

“Zhu Yifeng, have you gone insane?! If you dare to touch a hair on Qingxuan’s body, I guarantee that your Raging Flame Heavenly Palace will be slaughtered like a chicken!” shouted Yu Qingxuan’s protectors furiously.

They had never dreamed that the palace master would dare to be so brazen as to capture Yu Qingxuan. By the time they reacted, she was already in his hands.

Yu Qingxuan’s gaze was also frosty. Rainbow flames burned in her eyes, and she stealthily began accumulating power. At this moment, the flames of her fury soared. She had an urge to immediately kill this palace master.

“Why…”

Long Chen spoke. What surprised everyone was that despite Yu Qingxuan falling into the palace master’s hands, his voice was calm.

It was just that his flat voice seemed to come from the depths of a dark hell, like the murmuring of a devil god, the question of a Yama King that directly pierced the souls.

“Shut up! Hand over your core flame, otherwise… I will kill her!” declared the palace master.

Everyone now understood. The palace master had set his sights on Long Chen’s core flame. Long Chen’s flame energy had been witnessed by everyone.

When Yan Hong was slain, he shouted a name, Ice Soul. Furthermore, a cold chill filled the air the moment he was killed. That caused everyone to think of the Ice Soul Divine Flame, an existence ranked eighth on the Heavenly Flame Rankings.

To be able to destroy the Yan Xu Flame and kill Yan Hong, it would have to be a supremely terrifying flame. In other words, Long Chen was in possession of the Ice Soul Divine Flame.

Furthermore, a flame dragon had then devoured Yan Hong’s core flames after he was killed. The palace master instantly grew greedy. He didn’t even care about the Raging Flame Heavenly Palace. He only wanted Long Chen’s core flame. Thinking of this, everyone was moved. Long Chen’s core flame could actually use the Ice Soul’s power and had devoured Yan Hong’s flame. Anyone who obtained that flame would probably be unrivaled as long as they survived.

No wonder the palace master dared to take such a risk. After thinking this through, a lot of experts stared at Long Chen. Their gazes also burned greedily. Dozens of late stage World Kings then surrounded Long Chen.

Just like the palace master, they were moved. If they could obtain Long Chen’s core flame and then go into hiding for a few ten thousand years, would anyone dare to make things hard on them in the future?

Who cared about a sect? They would rebuild one at that time! They even felt some regret that they weren’t the ones to capture Yu Qingxuan instead. Now, it was too late. Once Long Chen handed over his core flame, they would immediately start fighting over it. They definitely wouldn’t let the palace master obtain it for free.

“Why not live a proper life? Why must you force me?”

Long Chen slowly raised his lowered head. When his head was raised, his entire aura changed. The dark energy that he had been bitterly suppressing erupted like a volcano!
