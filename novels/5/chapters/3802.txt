Chapter 3791 Mo Nian’s Manifestation

There were over ten Divine Venerates in front of the city and hundreds of Supreme Immortal Kings. Their expressions were twisted darkly. They were blocking one person’s path with furious expressions.

The person being blocked wore simple robes. He had a horsetail whisk in his hand, and his hair was tied up into a bun. From those characteristics, he gave off the feeling of an immortal Daoist.

However, his slightly chubby face and wretched expression that could not be concealed in his eyes ruined the overall image. It was a typical case of dressing a monkey in royal clothes. No matter how well-dressed it was, it didn’t quite look like the image. Long Chen almost died laughing when he saw Mo Nian’s costume.

“Damn human race, you dare to ruin my race’s holy land and blaspheme my ancestor’s corpses. You also stole my race’s treasures! Today, if I don’t tear you into a million pieces, your human race will never know what respect is!” shouted one Divine Venerate.

These people were experts of the devil race. They blocked Mo Nian’s path in front of the city.

This ancient city was different from other cities. It was the only one within the three thousand worlds that only permitted humans inside. Other races that dared to get close would be mercilessly killed.Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

It was said that the city lord of this Clear Sky City was a vicious character in charge of the Clear Sky Legion. They were all fierce warriors of the human race, said to be unafraid of death.

They stubbornly created a land that belonged solely to the human race within the three thousand worlds, relying only on their blood and unyielding natures.

Clear Sky City had had countless battles throughout history. Hence, the surrounding land was filled with countless corpses. It could be said that this city was built on top of a foundation of blood and corpses. It was the human race’s most glorious city.

Throughout the rest of the three thousand worlds, all the human race’s settlements had to lower their heads to other races. Only Clear Sky City was tough enough to not be bullied at all. It was a typical case of rather fighting to the death than yielding.

This caused countless races to attack and try to take the city over. They wanted to destroy the human race’s will to fight. But after having some huge casualties, they couldn’t maintain their attempts. In the end, Clear Sky City managed to survive.

Although there were three human settlements amongst the three thousand worlds’ ten greatest cities, only Clear Sky City rejected the other races from entering. It could be said to be a transcendent existence of the human race.

Any human experts who came here would receive shelter behind the city’s walls as long as they didn’t break the city’s rules. They could live in peace.

Thus, this city had the greatest human population of all human settlements. Naturally, with such a populace, there were also more elites. If those elites were strong enough, they would be selected to join the Clear Sky Legion.

The Clear Sky Legion had thirty million members. Whether it was the warriors or the officers, they would undergo a trial every half a year. Those ranked at the bottom would be removed from the legion.

That made the elites of the city fight for these spots. With this competition, the Clear Sky Legion was truly a place of elites amongst elites. This was what preserved their peak power.

The thirty-million Clear Sky warriors were so intimidating that no one dared to run wild in Clear Sky City. Thus, even these devil experts only dared to stop people outside the city. If Mo Nian were to enter the city, they could only obediently leave. If they dared to let out a single fart, they would be killed.

“It seems that your temper is too strong. In truth, your ancestors had a destiny with me. But now, this destiny is over, and both sides can mind their own business. Even if you try to pull me back, it’s useless,” said Mo Nian calmly in the face of the devil experts’ furious gazes.

“What bullshit! You blasphemed our ancestors! You brought their bones to see the sun and stole all the treasures within their tombs! How does that count as destiny!?” cursed that Divine Venerate.

His voice was so loud that it drew attention from the surroundings. Long Chen knew that these people were afraid of Clear Sky City attacking them simply due to their existence, so they righteously made their reason clear first. It was Mo Nian who provoked them first, so they had a reason to target him.

Furthermore, attacking someone outside the city was not breaking the city’s rules. That was expressing their respect for Clear Sky City.

Mo Nian shook his head and innocently said, “Your ancestors’ bones were buried too long. The damp environment down there turned everything toxic, causing the bones to rot. I brought them out to dry in the sun out of kind intentions. How can you wrongly accuse a good person of such crimes?”

“Wrongly accuse a good person?! You…!” That devil expert quivered with rage. He had never seen such a shameless person in his life before.

“Don’t waste time on him. Hand over the Soul Guarding Bead, or you will die a miserable death today.” One of the other Divine Venerates took out their weapon and pointed it at Mo Nian.

“Soul Guarding Bead?”

Long Chen instantly understood why these devil experts would so furiously chase after Mo Nian.

The Soul Guarding Bead in ancient tombs was used as a dwelling place for the ancestral spirits. It was also where their faith energy condensed.

In the immortal world, many races had their faiths in their ancestors. The human race was also like that. Families worshiped their ancestral tablets, nourishing their ancestral heroic spirits. This faith energy would make sure that their heroic spirits did not fade away. It was what upheld an entire family or race’s karmic luck, helping them awaken their bloodlines.

Mo Nian had actually plundered their ancestral tomb, even taking the Soul Guarding Bead. It was no wonder they would dare to take the risk of coming to Clear Sky City and stopping Mo Nian.

“What are you saying? We’re all friends. This treasure has destiny with me. I’d ask you to please not make things hard on this poor Daoist!” said Mo Nian lightly, shaking his head as if he had done nothing wrong.

“Kill him!”

Seeing him still feign innocence, those devil experts finally lost their patience. Their head Divine Venerate directly attacked.

Following him, the others also attacked. Over ten Divine Venerates flew forward along with hundreds of Supreme Immortal Kings. This region was fully locked down, and they didn’t give Mo Nian any chance of fleeing.

“Boss, let’s go!” said Jiang Lei urgently.

“No need. This fellow’s quite strong!” Long Chen shook his head. He understood Mo Nian far too well. If Mo Nian didn’t have the power to back his words up, he’d have long since run off.

This fellow’s fleeing arts were completely unrivaled. If he dared to still be standing there, it meant that he had absolute assurance.

BOOM!

A heaven-shaking explosion erupted. As a result, those experts charging at Mo Nian were all sent flying. The closest Divine Venerates coughed up blood and tumbled back miserably. It was a shocking sight.

A wild qi wave then spread along with a sacred might, and a giant palace appeared behind Mo Nian. The palace was solemn and dignified. It exuded a majestic aura. Every brick and tile gave off the divine might of the Heavenly Daos. It was like its own world.

This was Mo Nian’s manifestation. This manifestation suppressed the ten thousand Daos, and even the Divine Venerates were shaken to the point of coughing up blood. Long Chen himself jumped in shock. When did this fellow gain such a terrifying manifestation?

The world quivered. However, unexpectedly, Mo Nian didn’t attack. He only took out a shovel and dug a large hole in the ground.

Those devil experts were enraged. Seeing Mo Nian minding his own business and digging, one of them roared and slashed his sword across space.

Mo Nian’s figure vanished. In front of everyone’s shocked gazes, he appeared above that person’s head and smacked him with his shovel.

That person’s bones shattered and he instantly died. His corpse then flew through the air and landed perfectly in the hole that Mo Nian had dug.

Just as everyone was completely shocked, Mo Nian was like a phantom, appearing beside the other Divine Venerate. His shovel once more smashed down.
