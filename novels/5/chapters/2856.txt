Chapter 2845 Slander

BOOM!

A disciple of the Elite Group sent another disciple flying with a slash of his sword. He smashed into the barrier and fell unconscious.

“The challenge is successful!” announced the examiner, causing a clamor amongst the disciples.

“Thirty-six people all succeeded in their challenges! Not one of them lost! And they all challenged people in the top fifty! The rankings are now filled with fresh blood. Heavens, this world is crazy, right? How is this possible?”

Just what kind of method had this boss San used to turn a group of trash into a true Elite Group in just a short month? That was heaven-defying.

The instructors were just as shocked. Looking at the Elite Group, they felt like they were going crazy.

The most unacceptable thing to them was that these disciples had beaten their opponents in under ten moves. Their challenges were won in just a few breaths’ time, and that terrifying combat power shook them to their core.

When the final disciple won, they fell into stunned silence. Even Mu Qinygun and the Unfettered Alliance’s members had stopped cheering. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

They were simply stunned. The Elite Group’s disciples were like tigers. When their gaze fell on their opponents, it was like they were looking at the person who had killed their father. That was how fierce and vicious they were.

Furthermore, they had won all these challenges without any powerful techniques. They had simply used very ordinary techniques, but their opponents were unable to block them.

“This is impossible! Long Chen definitely cheated!”

Suddenly, Ming Ze shouted. He was unable to accept this reality, and other instructors also stood with him.

The disciples stared in confusion before realizing what was going on. They were collectively rising against Long Chen.

Long Chen had used a month to raise a group of trash into elites. That was a slap in the face of all the other instructors.

In the entire corps of instructors, who was able to do what Long Chen had just done? His current display was saying that all of them were terrible teachers who had misjudged geniuses as trash.

“I propose that we hold an investigation into these disciples to see if they secretly consumed some kind of drug! Sacrificing a disciple’s longevity for short-term goals is simply destructive and contrary to the goals of the academy!” shouted an instructor.

“Fuck your mother!” Even before Heaven Master Yun Yang could speak, the Elite Group burst into curses.

“Other than smearing others, do you pieces of shit have any ability?”

“You’re jealous of boss San’s ability, so you use this kind of underhanded method? Fine, let’s bet right now! Heaven Master, you can test all of us. If we cheated, everyone in the Elite Group will kill themself. If we didn’t cheat, then all these jealous and dark-hearted pieces of trash can scram out of the God Institute!”

“That’s right, despicable little people like you aren’t fit to be instructors! How are people like you supposed to teach others? You want us to learn your vileness? Let’s bet with our lives!”

The proud Elite Group was enraged by this slander. Questioning Long Chen was the most unacceptable thing to them.

Although Long Chen’s training had practically been torture during this meantime, and he had never smiled at them, that didn’t stop them from worshipping his strength. They were originally terrified of Long Chen, but as they gradually understood his abilities, that terror transformed into reverence. The more they cultivated with Long Chen, the more they felt him to be as vast as a mountain, as deep as a sea. They were nothing more than specks of dust compared to him.

Now, a bunch of people of higher rank but without any ability dared to blaspheme Long Chen. This scene made the Elite Group have an urge to charge up and kill them right now.

The other disciples found it both shocking and comical that the Elite Group would be so enraged. All of them were holding their weapons, a vicious light in their eyes. But Long Chen was still sitting there like he was sleeping.

“Brazen!”

“Impudent!”

“You wish to rebel?!”

The instructors were surprised and then became angry. They began to shout back, turning this into a chaotic spectacle.

“That’s enough!” A wave of divine pressure suddenly spread from Heaven Master Yun Yang, shaking everyone’s hearts. “The quality of the God Institute’s instructors has declined. It seems that we should consider forming a ranking just like the one we have our disciples so that we can get rid of the worse ones. Ming Ze, if I recall properly, you were promoted to the Earth rank over three hundred years ago, correct? It seems that ever since your promotion, you haven’t made any contributions. To have arrogance is not important, but arrogance must have a foundation. Where does your foundation lay? With no evidence, you accused instructor Long Chen of cheating and even had a group of people currying favor with you to twist reality. Does your foundation lay in using your position to accumulate numbers? Pulling in some people and relying on them, did you think such support can allow you to do whatever you please? Remember, this place is the High Firmament Academy. The biggest person here is the dean. Hence, unless your backer is the dean, I’d advise you not to mess around so much.”

Heaven Master Yun Yang usually spoke kindly, and no one had ever seen him enraged. But his words today were a bit heavy. It seemed that the good-tempered Heaven Master Yun Yang was extremely dissatisfied with Ming Ze and was warning him.

“Heaven Master, disciple only felt that-!” Ming Ze began to sweat.

Heaven Master Yun Yang waved his hand. “If you suspect instructor Long Chen is cheating and wish to investigate, that is an insult to instructor Long Chen’s character. To be fair, an investigation is possible, but if nothing is revealed by this investigation, you will have to kneel outside the God Institute’s transportation formation for three days.”

“That’s…” Ming Ze and the others’ expressions changed.

“What? You wish to humiliate others, so you must accept being humiliated if you’re wrong. Your dignity is not worth more than other people’s dignity.” Heaven Master Yun Yang’s gaze suddenly became cold. His eyes were like two sharp blades looking at Ming Ze.

“I… I… I feel like there’s no need for such a thing. I believe in instructor Long Chen.” Ming Ze finally submitted after hesitating a long time.

He knew that Heaven Master Yun Yang was enraged. If he pressed it, everything would occur according to the rules.

Although he felt that Long Chen had most likely cheated, he didn’t dare to take the risk. That transportation formation was something that millions of disciples went through every day. Kneeling there would be worse than death.

“Ha!”

“Haha!”

“Hahaha…!”

The Elite Group’s disciples laughed, but they didn’t smile. They were using this method to insult Ming Ze and the others.

The other disciples also found it laughable. This Earth Master Ming Ze now looked like he had kicked an iron plate.

Seeing Ming Ze and the others lower their heads and fall silent, Heaven Master Yun Yang finally turned to Long Chen with a slight smile.

“Instructor Long Chen, don’t sleep. I wonder if you can share with us your experience? I believe that many people would like to hear it.”

Everyone’s ears perked up. They then looked at Long Chen, their hearts pounding. They all wanted to know how Long Chen had allowed this group to advance so quickly. What kind of secret lay within this?
