Chapter 2892 Fully Expelled Mortal Qi

Luo Ning and Luo Bing were delighted. They had essentially done something meritorious for their family. If Long Chen formed a collaboration with the Luo family, then the Luo family’s current predicament would be resolved.

Furthermore, both of them had now awakened their bloodline power, so they could start unleashing their bloodline divine arts. Even if Gu Fei and the others were concealing their power, both of them had the confidence to defeat them and win the immortal competition.

The reason that the Luo family could become the overlord of a prefecture wasn’t because of luck. It was because of their own power. Their own foundation ran extremely deep, and their bloodline power was terrifying.

Luo Bing and Luo Ning had just awoken this power and needed to go into seclusion. One reason was to get used to their new conditions and start cultivating the secret arts relating to their bloodline. The other reason was because violet qi still continued to come from their bodies, and it was too obvious. If they went out, it would be telling everyone that they had awakened their bloodlines. Then their enemies would be prepared.

Taking a page out of their enemies’ playbook, they chose to stay hidden during this time. When they came out, they would give Gu Fei and the others a nice surprise.

Luo Bing then sent word back to their family that the two of them had managed to achieve the spiritual awakening of their bloodlines.

After arranging these things, Long Chen could be considered to have taken his first step to going to the Luo family. Hence, he felt a weight fall from his shoulders.

However, when it came to looking for his mother, he felt both anticipations as well as a certain nervousness. He didn’t even remember the face of his biological mother, so he had some contradicting emotions when it came to looking for her.

After a while, Long Chen returned to his home and started familiarizing himself with the Seven Supreme Yang Technique and the Starry River of the Sky Art. When he tried to use the Seven Supreme Yang Technique, he found that its creator truly had some amazing insights.

The human body already came with all the elements of metal, wood, water, fire, earth, wind, and lightning. But even Long Chen hadn’t sensed these energies within him until now. That was because they were far too weak. They could be considered to be in slumber, so subtle that they were completely overlooked. Long Chen only controlled lightning and fire.

According to the Seven Supreme Yang Technique, he needed to draw out the potential of his metal, wood, water, earth, and wind energies. When he used his flame energy or thunderforce, these energies would then undergo a transformation, becoming fuel to support his lightning and fire.

However, Long Chen didn’t do this. As he cultivated the Nine Star Hegemon Body Art, the Seven Supreme Yang Technique was only here to deceive others. His true trump card wasn’t his thunderforce or his flame energy, it was his own body. He couldn’t put the cart in front of the horse.

Long Chen’s divine ring appeared. After that, red, orange, yellow, green, azure, blue, and violet colors wove together. The mix of metal, wood, water, fire, earth, wind, and lightning energies forced a rainbow ring out.

It was different from his usual divine ring. The colors were not separate in this divine ring; they were mixed together. When he tried to circulate his thunderforce, he found that all the colors ignited to become one color.

Long Chen could clearly feel the metal, wood, water, earth, and wind energy transforming into lightning energy. But their support was currently extremely weak because Long Chen had only awakened those energies for appearances. He hadn’t let them grow.

However, his flame energy could not be absorbed into the flow. Likewise, when he used his flame energy, his thunderforce would not be absorbed by it either.

It was because his flame energy and thunderforce were independent entities. They came from Lei Long and Huo Long. Thus, the Seven Supreme Yang Technique wasn’t effective on them.

Long Chen then tried to use his divine ring. When his divine ring appeared, the rainbow divine ring grew with it. He tested it several times and found that the rainbow divine ring could limitlessly grow. But once it grew like that, the Seven Supreme Yang Technique’s power was also dispersed.

Long Chen didn’t care about that. The only thing he cared about was whether or not the Seven Supreme Yang Technique could cover up his actual divine ring, and this showed that it could.

From the outside, it looked like a messy ring of colors. It was impossible to see the six-color divine ring inside of it.

Seeing that everything looked good, Long Chen switched to the Starry River of the Sky Art. After that, a starry river appeared in his divine ring, and it was somewhat similar to his star diagram. However, when the starry river appeared, his 108,000 stars suddenly quivered.

BOOM!

The starry river collapsed, replaced by his star diagram.

“It won’t even allow a substitution?”

Long Chen jumped in shock. He hadn’t even activated the Nine Star Hegemon Body Art, but as soon as the starry river appeared, the Nine Star Hegemon Body Art automatically destroyed it.

He tried it a few more times, but every time the starry river appeared, the Nine Star Hegemon Body Art would automatically activate and destroy it.

“Whatever. A starry river and a star diagram are only different in shape. Outsiders shouldn’t be able to tell the difference.”

Long Chen could only give up on this. This kind of thing was a complete headache. He didn’t have the time or energy to waste on this.

As long as others didn’t instantly recognize him, it was fine. His status would be revealed sooner or later. But the later, the better.

“Time to try using astral energy.” Long Chen closed his eyes. He began to circulate astral energy according to the Starry River of the Sky Art.

When a star diagram appeared in his hands, Long Chen felt like his Yuan Spirit had been extracted from his body. He could see the cosmos and the limitless stars. It felt like he had entered a state of emptiness.

It was as if he was a spectator observing the world.

Suddenly, pain wracked his body and he coughed up a mouthful of blood. This special state was instantly broken, and Long Chen was brought back to reality.

The star diagram in his hands had exploded, turning his hands into a bloody mess. He then rubbed his head to find that his forehead had also split open. Blood slowly flowed out.

“What happened?!”

Long Chen still didn’t understand what was going on. He had almost died just now!

“Without condensing the seventh star, you circulated the seventh level of the Nine Star Hegemon Body Art. Your guts are pretty big. If I hadn’t taken action, you would be dead.” An ancient voice suddenly rang out in Long Chen’s mind.

“Senior!” Long Chen was delighted. This was the mysterious voice that had repeatedly rang out in his mind ever since he had started cultivating the Nine Star Hegemon Body Art. Furthermore, this time, it was far clearer, no longer disjointed. Did this mean that he could uncover some of the secrets of the nine stars?

“Great nine star heir, you’ve finally come to the immortal world. We can see hope. Quickly grow up. Nine star heirs all grow up against adversity. You are the strongest warriors of this cosmos. Don’t humiliate the prestige of the nine star heirs. I don’t know how you ended up touching the power of the cosmos, but remember, without condensing the seventh star, touching that power is the same as killing yourself. I could save you once, but I can’t save you a second time. Furthermore, using this power will allow your enemies to instantly lock down your location and attack. Remember this at all costs… remember…”

“Senior!”

Long Chen cried out, but that ancient voice had vanished like an illusion.

Long Chen rubbed his hand, and the blood continued to flow. He had actually caused such a strange injury to himself.

It was only when he slowly circulated the Nine Star Hegemon Body Art that the wound slowly closed. Long Chen finally relaxed slightly.

“The Starry River of the Sky Art is actually similar to the Nine Star Hegemon Body Art’s seventh level. I almost died because of it.” Long Chen felt a burst of fear. It seemed that he couldn’t randomly cultivate things in the future, especially not things that were similar to the Nine Star Hegemon Body Art.

Long Chen rested for half a day and then went out to hold classes for Mu Qingyun and the others. Time passed just like that until it was the day of the divine competition.

“Brother San, you’ve actually fully expelled your mortal qi!” When the Unfettered Alliance’s disciples gathered, Mu Qingyun suddenly cried out in delight when she looked at Long Chen.
