Chapter 3480 Settling Debt

“Are they after that treasure?” asked Long Chen.

“Yes. This treasure has caused the deaths of everyone in my family. Now it’s just the two of us left. I didn’t expect them to refuse to let us off even now,” said Bai Fang hatefully.

Ever since those people had set their sights on Bai Fang and Bai Rui, Long Chen already felt that things were not so simple. After all, the two of them were lacking experience. Although they had changed their appearance, their technique wasn’t very good. Long Chen could easily see through it, but he simply acted like he couldn’t.

“I don’t mind if I die. But I am worried that my sister won’t be able to survive on her own. She is terrified of the world and probably wouldn’t survive much longer like this. Brother Long, I beg you to help us.” Bai Long looked at Long Chen pleadingly.

Currently, Bai Rui was sleeping on her big brother’s lap. She was blithely unaware that a crisis had already befallen them.

“I can. As long as you don’t leave my side, I can guarantee your safety.” Long Chen nodded.

“Many thanks, brother Long. I will immediately-”

“As for the treasure, it’s alright. I’m not greedy for your treasures. I’m only helping you because I think that you are kind. In my opinion, a kind heart should be treated warmly.” Long Chen waved his hand.

The two of them didn’t have any scheming in their hearts at all. Otherwise, they wouldn’t be viewed as fat sheep by others.

As for whatever their so-called priceless treasure was, Long Chen wasn’t interested. Just looking at their cultivation bases, he could tell that their background wasn’t powerful. He was only helping them out of sympathy.

This promise from Long Chen instantly made Bai Fang’s eyes redden. Ever since they were forced to flee for their lives, Long Chen was the only good person they had encountered.

Originally, the two of them had some money on them, but due to not knowing the pitfalls of the world, they ended up suffering some losses. All their money was conned away.

If they hadn’t bought the tickets for the ship in advance, they might not even have this final hope left. Without any experience and with bad luck plaguing them, they only encountered bad people. Bai Fang even felt like sometimes there was no more hope for them.

Long Chen’s existence was like a final straw of hope. Bai Fang could see that Long Chen was powerful. Originally, he was hoping to obtain Long Chen’s support after arriving at the Violet Flame Heaven. After all, the two of them had no idea where to go in the Violet Flame Heaven.

Unexpectedly, even on the ship, they were targeted. Feeling afraid, he begged for aid from Long Chen, and Long Chen readily agreed without wanting any reward. That made Bai Fang feel the sunlight within his world of darkness.

The ship pressed onward. Wild winds and storms would sometimes buffet it. The other times, there would be a bright and glaring sun. Even this giant ship appeared miniscule on this endless sea.

Furthermore, Long Chen sensed some strange laws affecting the space around. It was very difficult to fly here. There were invisible chaotic spatial currents. One mistake and you might be blown to who knew where.

Even if you possessed a powerful physical body that didn’t fear the current, in that chaotic flow, it wouldn’t be long before you were so lost that you would never be able to find your way out.

As the ship moved, Long Chen felt like it was passing through the starry sky. There were endless stars above, while at the bottom there seemed to be another starry sky. That feeling was truly mysterious.

Long Chen thought of the clumps of nebulas that the Heavenly Rainbow Fairy had shown him. Those were the nine heavens. There seemed to be a black area between the heavens, separating them. Long Chen then looked at the originally blue seawater. It was starting to turn black. This was further proof that the Heavenly Rainbow Fairy had shown him the true world.

Long Chen often went to the deck and just stared out into space. Bai Fang and Bai Rui were very obedient, never separating from him. As for those Immortal Kings that had suddenly appeared, they seemed to be getting a bit impatient.

“Hey, brat, this is your middle level tablet. Go to your room.” The conman that had scammed Long Chen appeared, tossing a silver tablet to Long Chen.

Bai Fang tensed up. Bai Rui didn’t know what was going on, but she didn’t want to part with Long Chen as she would feel afraid. No matter how inexperienced she was, she still managed to notice those Immortal Kings eyeing them.

Long Chen didn’t catch the tablet. So, the tablet that countless people in the low level dreamed of obtaining clattered to the ground.𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“What do you think you’re doing?” That man’s expression darkened.

“I’m doing whatever you’re doing,” said Long Chen indifferently.

It seemed that the ones to set their sights on Bai Fang were the Soaring Dragon Company. This practically toppled Long Chen’s understanding of businessmen.

“Are you looking to die?” Killing intent appeared in that man’s eyes. It seemed that he had also been holding back a long time and couldn’t endure any longer.

“That’s precisely what I was going to say to you.” Long Chen smiled.

Just then, over ten experts surrounded Long Chen. Several of them had been brought by this man, while the others had been eyeing Bai Fang and Bai Rui this entire time. They were all Immortal Kings.

Seeing this, Bai Rui cried out in horror and hid behind Bai Fang. Bai Fang also jumped in fear. So many Immortal Kings were making their move all at once. He was worried that Long Chen wouldn’t be able to stop them.

He wanted to help, but there was nothing he could do against so many Immortal Kings. He was nothing more than an ordinary mid stage Divine Lord, not a match for these people. His head turned empty.

“If you want to die, I’ll kill you right now,” said that man.

Long Chen didn’t immediately reply. He only turned to Bai Rui, who was pale with fright.

“You’re tired. Sleep for a bit!”

Bai Rui’s head suddenly buzzed. Just like that, she collapsed on Bai Fang’s back, sleeping.

Only then did Long Chen turn back. His smile vanished, replaced with an icy expression.

“What did you say just now?”

“I said, if you want to die, I’ll kill you!” shouted that man.

BOOM!

He had just finished speaking when Long Chen’s leg kicked out like lightning, striking him right in the chest. That man was sent flying like a cannonball, smashing into the wall.

The immense power caused the ship to shake. No one knew whether it was a coincidence or not, but the place he smashed into was the same spot that the bald man had been slapped into at the start of the journey.

However, this kick was even more vicious. The wall was several feet thick and made of the best steel. Because of it, the bald man had only left some bloodstains as he slid down, and the wall had been undamaged. But this time, a hole was smashed into that thick wall.

That man coughed up three mouthfuls of blood. Even some of his insides were spat out. His head tilted as he collapsed on the ground just like that. It was unknown if he was dead or alive.

“Die!”

The other Immortal Kings were enraged. They hadn’t expected Long Chen to dare to attack first. They pounced on him.

After that, a cold light flashed and over ten heads flew into the air at once.
