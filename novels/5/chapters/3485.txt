Chapter 3474 Consuming the Violet Tower Pill

Half a month later, the seventh branch academy was rebuilt. All the materials that went into it were top grade. Long Chen had spent a full ten million immortal king crystals to create a seventh branch academy that was a war fortress.

Other than not being able to move, it had almost no weaknesses. An attack like the last one was unable to shake this academy.

However, Long Chen also knew that the just-defeated Enpuda and Liao Bencang wouldn’t be returning any time soon. They knew that Long Chen wouldn’t give them that chance.

Furthermore, they had taken heavy losses this time. Liao Bencang had lost two avatars, which signified that his divine energy was no longer able to descend upon the Darklight Heaven.

During the time that the seventh branch academy was being built, Long Chen proposed to Bai Zhantang to directly wipe out the Nine Underworld Hall and the Bloodkill Hall. Bai Zhantang instantly agreed.

However, when they arrived at the various Bloodkill Halls and Nine Underworld Halls spread throughout the major domains, they found that the people there had long since vanished. Bai Zhantang was so enraged that he directly smashed apart their palaces.

Clearly, Enpuda and Liao Bencang had also known that the High Firmament Academy would counterattack. In order to conserve their forces, they had their believers hide themselves.

Even as their palaces were smashed apart, even as their divine statues were broken, the Nine Underworld Hall and the Bloodkill Hall didn’t show themselves. Without those as a foundation, they wouldn’t dare to reveal themselves in the near future either.

“You’re going to the Violet Flame Heaven? Have you thought this through?” asked the sweeping elder.

“I suppose I haven’t really thought it through. The main thing is that there is nothing to think about.” Long Chen shook his head with embarrassment.

He had no plan or ideas for the Violet Flame Heaven. He knew nothing about it. Moreover, planning wasn’t his style. Planning wasn’t as fast as taking action, so he couldn’t be bothered.

“The Violet Flame Heaven has ten thousand races standing tall, and experts are as common as ants. Heavenly geniuses are so numerous that they are like grains of sand in a river. Going to take a look there is good too.” The sweeping elder nodded.

“The seventh branch academy is already rebuilt, and everything is settled appropriately. I came to ask for some pointers, to see if you have anything I should pay attention to,” said Long Chen.

As his cultivation base grew, Long Chen found that this elder was growing increasingly unfathomable. The rainbow crane race had long lifespans, but this elder had sent off several generations of them. This was definitely a true living fossil. Listening to this elder definitely wasn’t bad.

“There’s nothing in particular. For youngsters to suffer a bit isn’t a bad thing. They only learn their lessons that way. If you slam into many nails, either you learn to get out of the way or you grow an iron armor,” said the elder with a smile.

Long Chen also smiled. “Senior is laughing at me. Does senior think that I’m so hot-headed and don’t learn my lessons?”

Long Chen was precisely the kind of person to smash into a wall over and over again without looking back, smashing himself into it until he finally broke through.

Sometimes when he was calm, he would also feel himself to be very foolish. But it was truly rare for him to be so cool-headed. If he was always cool-headed, he wouldn’t be Long Chen.

“That is just your character. It can’t be called bad, but it also can’t be called good. Every person pursues their own things. Since people have different goals, they have different attitudes toward life. Such a thing cannot be judged. The Violet Flame Heaven is a good place. But a good place also has even crueler competition. Things appear in order on the surface, but that peace covers up the wild undercurrents beneath. Within the Violet Flame Heaven are the ruins of the thirty-sixth branch, the forty-seventh branch, and others. There are seven branch ruins in total. As long as our main academy remains, the foundation stones are in a deep slumber and cannot be broken. If you can activate a branch academy, our High Firmament Academy’s power will be able to descend upon the Violet Flame Heaven. However, you have to know that the reason that you could take back the seventh branch academy is because the other side had abandoned the Darklight Heaven. They have now sealed off the others. It will be very difficult for something like the seventh branch academy’s incident to occur again. Don’t get greedy for premature success,” said the sweeping elder.

Long Chen nodded. Taking back the seventh branch academy had mostly been thanks to luck, while the other aspect was that the other side simply hadn’t placed him in their eyes. After all, at that time, he had only been in the Four Peak realm.

The other thing was that the struggle for the Heavenly Rainbow Flame had drawn the other side’s attention, and that was what had given Long Chen his chance. Despite that, it had taken Long Chen a great deal of effort to take back the seventh branch academy. After suffering that loss, the other side definitely wouldn’t be so careless again.

“Senior, don’t worry, this time I will definitely be careful. Do you have any other pointers for this little one?” asked Long Chen.𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“No.”

The sweeping elder shook his head.

Long Chen bowed to the elder and left. Originally, he was thinking of going to see the rainbow crane race, but thinking of how Little Crane was probably still sleeping from using up so much energy to expel the death qi last time, he chose not to disturb her.

The sweeping elder hadn’t given him much advice. That actually made Long Chen feel even steadier. And back in the seventh branch academy, everything was almost ready.

Long Chen searched through all the wealth from the Integral Heaven Star-Field. He tossed them into the various treasuries. In the future, the seventh branch academy’s disciples could exchange points for those treasures.

The main resources were medicinal pills. There was a veritable ocean’s worth of medicinal pills. Even if Long Chen shared them with the main academy, they wouldn’t be used up without at least a few centuries. So, it could be said that the seventh branch academy’s financial power was terrifying.

After devouring so many corpses, the primal chaos space’s Wood Foundation Divine Trees had exploded in growth, reaching a tremendous height. Their enormous life energy was like a sea.

Last time, in battle, Long Chen clearly felt just how powerful their life energy was. As long as they were present, Long Chen possessed a kind of undying body.

BOOM!

Suddenly, his body shook intensely, and a wild power exploded within him. It was like hundreds of volcanoes were erupting at the same time within him.

Long Chen had just consumed a Violet Tower Pill. Despite being mentally prepared and even summoning the divine ring and battle armor, the immense power was still like wild horses refusing to listen to orders. Those horses were running rampant throughout his body.

They seemed to have their own spirits and didn’t want to be devoured. They were doing their best to resist. Long Chen tried to control them, but he was unable to force them to that spot right below his Dantian.

They also seemed to know that they would be devoured if they entered that place, so they resisted with all their power.

BOOM!

Long Chen suppressed the medicinal energy with all his power. Just as he was about to force it to the position of the Violet Tower Star, the medicinal energy exploded, transforming into trillions of droplets that fled to the star diagram in his Dantian.

“This…”

Long Chen suddenly had a thought. When that medicinal energy scattered, it merged into the 108,000 stars, trying to use them to conceal themselves. Long Chen immediately activated his astral power.

After being scattered, the medicinal energy instantly lost the ability to resist. Long Chen was about to send that medicinal energy toward the position of the Violet Tower Star when the FengFu Star suddenly shook. Without giving Long Chen a chance to react, it was like a black hole cleanly devouring all of the medicinal energy.

“This path was opened by me? Pay my toll if you want to pass?”

Long Chen was dumbfounded. The medicinal energy that was supposed to be used to condense the Violet Tower Pill had been entirely consumed by the FengFu Star. Could it be…?

Just then, something that dumbfounded Long Chen occurred.
