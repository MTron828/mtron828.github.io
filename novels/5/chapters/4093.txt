Chapter 4082 Sage King Crown

“This is one of the largest conventions of the Nirvana Overflow Heaven. All the Immortal Kings of the nine heavens and ten lands will come to compete for the Sage King Crown,” said the guild master.ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

“Everyone in the nine heavens and ten lands?” Guo Ran was delighted to hear that. He and Long Chen thought of the same thing. Wouldn’t that mean that the Dragonblood Legion would be reunited?

“Ah, a slip of the tongue. Only the most apex Immortal Kings of the nine heavens and ten lands will come. Normal geniuses would only be qualified to watch,” said the guild master.

“Can you explain what this Sage King Convention is in detail?” Long Chen was instantly interested.

This Sage King Convention actually had a longer name: Nirvana Overflow Ten Thousand Race Sage King Convention.

Every time it was held, its contents were different. Also, it wasn’t held by any one person or power but automatically held by the Sage King World.

The Sage King World was in the center of the Nirvana Overflow Heaven, a wild land that no one showed any interest in during normal times.

However, every few hundreds of thousands of years, or perhaps even millions of years, the Sage King World would open, and the Sage King Martial Stage would descend. It was said that the Sage King Martial Stage was created jointly by the ancestors of the ten thousand races in the primal chaos era, so it contained the karmic luck of ten thousand races. It was only through their combined efforts that it was constructed.

Anyone from any world, from the initial Immortal King realm to the full circle of the Immortal King realm, could attend this convention.

Legend had it that there was once a period of comparative peace in the primal chaos era, and a major reason for this period of peace was the Sage King Martial Stage.

It was said that the construction of the Sage King Martial Stage was proposed by the Spirit Race’s Sage Emperor. He was the one who had led the ten thousand races in drawing up the agreement and laws of the stage.

In the primal chaos era, the Sage King Martial Stage was activated once a century, and the winner would obtain the Sage King Crown.

This so-called Sage King Crown was the karmic luck that the Sage King Martial Stage had accumulated from the nine heavens, and it would all fall to one person, the champion.

What was interesting was that the person who obtained the Sage King Crown essentially had a one hundred percent chance of reaching the Eternal realm.

With the Sage King Crown, there would be no bottlenecks. Even if you just slept all day, the Heavenly Daos would merge power and comprehension into your body, and it lasted all the way until you reached the Eternal realm.

“Is this real?!” Long Chen jumped in shock. This Sage King Crown was basically cheating.

“Of course it’s real. However, in the current era, things have changed. The Sage King Martial Stage used to appear every century, but now it takes hundreds of thousands of years to millions of years before it can form. That is because it needs to condense enough karmic luck before it appears. In the primal chaos era, it only took a century. But now there is less energy in the world, and everything has changed. Counting the years, it has been a full eight million years since the last opening of the Sage King World. Furthermore, in these eight million years, no Eternal expert appeared in the Nirvana Overflow Heaven. Clearly, even with the support of the Sage King Crown, it is not so easy to enter the Eternal realm,” sighed the guild master.

Eight million years, and no one had reached the Eternal realm? Then it really had to be difficult. No wonder he said that all the apex geniuses of the nine heavens and ten lands would come.

Becoming Eternal? That would be the true peak of the immortal world. Someone like that would even be able to fight Lord Brahma. Upon thinking of this, Long Chen’s heart was instantly set ablaze.

“Ah yes, the Sage King Crown isn’t the only treasure there. Anyone who enters the top ten thousand will receive the blessing of karmic luck, and the top thousand will obtain primal chaos qi that cleanses the body and soul. Starting from the top hundred, they will have their pick of various divine weapons, battle armor, medicinal pills, cultivation techniques, Battle Skills, and other treasures. Even just getting in the top ten thousand is no small thing. Obtaining the karmic luck blessing alone will give a person more acknowledgment from the Heavenly Daos. To the Heavenly Daos, it would be like you were their son. The support of karmic luck is something extremely desirable, let alone the cleansing of primal chaos qi. You should know that the Sage King Martial Stage needed eight million years to gather the energy for these rewards, so they definitely aren’t ordinary. Thus, as long as they receive word of this, every major power’s heavenly geniuses will go crazy. Heavenly geniuses that have been sealed for countless years will also awaken. At the time, the Sage King Convention will truly be a land of heavenly geniuses.”

“Excellent! Then I’ll be able to see Meng Qi, Chu Yao, Wan-er, Zi Yan, Mingyu, Zhiqiu, Xiaoqian, and the others.” Long Chen’s heart was set ablaze. He had previously been thinking about how to reunite with everyone.

But now, his opportunity had come. Long Chen believed that everyone would see each other again soon. The Dragonblood warriors would know that Long Chen would attend, and so they would definitely do everything they could to come over.

“The Sage King Martial Stage is in the midst of activating. It will probably be fully activated in half a year. Mister Long Chen, you have to make your preparations in advance. If you need anything from my Huayun Trading Company, just ask. Don’t stand on courtesy.”

“I truly do need your help. I have some things on hand that I don’t need, and some materials that I do need.” To the side, Guo Ran finally had a chance to interject.

In the three thousand worlds, Guo Ran and Xia Chen had gained countless treasures. However, they didn’t have an immediate use for most of them. Later on, they were always too busy to deal with them.

Now, they finally had a chance, so Guo Ran naturally wouldn’t let it go. He directly tossed out all the divine weapons and battle armor and various oddities from the three thousand worlds. Keeping them on hand was a waste of space.

The majority of these treasures were obtained from that odd tomb. Many of the divine weapons had already rotted, and some of the runes had lost their spirituality. However, they did have some value in terms of research.

In Guo Ran’s hands, they naturally weren’t worth any money, as they had long since made copies of the runes. However, by giving them to the Huayun Trading Company who could sell them to people who needed them, they could get a huge amount of money.

Most importantly, the Huayun Trading Company’s business channels were incredibly widespread. They were always able to find a suitable buyer. When Guo Ran took out these treasures, even the experienced guild master was moved. He immediately called over some appraisers. Just like Long Chen, Guo Ran didn’t even look at how they calculated it. He simply handed a list to the guild master.

After that, Guo Ran directly asked them to gather the materials on the list. If the value of the treasures that he took out wasn’t high enough, he told the guild master to directly ask for money from Long Chen.

Hearing this, Long Chen rolled his eyes. It seemed that even now, he had to be raising Guo Ran. However, there was no way around it. Who asked him to be the boss?

Long Chen also took this chance to toss out a random assortment of items that he had in the primal chaos space. Anything that he couldn’t use, he took out.

He directly said that if it had value, sell it, and if it didn’t have value, just throw it out. In any case, he fully trusted them.

At this time, another elder of the Huayun Trading Company suddenly came running over. His expression was rather serious.

“What is it?” asked the guild master, startled.

“The Soaring Dragon Company’s people have come. They’re probably here for mister Long Chen.”
