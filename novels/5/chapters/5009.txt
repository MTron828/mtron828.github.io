When the first star accepted the blood rune, it seemed as though all resistance from the stars instantly dissipated. In the blink of an eye, every star was adorned with a violet blood rune, transforming the starry sea into a mystical violet hue that took Long Chen’s breath away.Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

“The violet blood can not just mediate the clash between the seven-color Supreme Blood and dragon blood, but it can also seamlessly integrate with the stars. There must be some hidden secret behind this that I don’t know,” Long Chen mused aloud.

Long Chen gazed at the violet starry sea before him, pleasantly surprised yet deep in thought. He couldn’t help but ponder the circumstances of his birth. His father was from the Jiuli race, while his mother was a descendant of the violet blood race. Was their union truly a coincidence?

Back then, the dragon expert had chosen him to inherit the Dragon Blood Battle Armor. Was that connected to his lineage? Moreover, he distinctly remembered obtaining the primal chaos bead from the Jiuli secret realm. What significance did this hold?

The Pill Sovereign’s memories contained countless pill formulas. But if it weren’t for the primal chaos space, the pill formulas would be useless regardless. Every element seemed crucial for him to achieve his current level of prowess. Long Chen couldn't help but smile. Heavenly Chosens? They were dogshit. He believed he was truly chosen by fate, or perhaps it was more accurate to say that he would decide the fate of the heavens.

Long Chen felt like he had come to a profound realization, but ultimately, he brushed it aside. He just had to focus on raising his power. Whatever else was meant to happen would unfold in due time.

His consciousness delved deeper into the starry sea, where he continued to infuse his violet blood energy. His goal was to infuse the entire starry sea with his violet blood.

Unlike before, Long Chen noticed that his stars no longer actively resisted the infusion of his violet blood. The initial explosions of the blood runes occurred due to the stars’ natural defense mechanisms. However, once these defenses were breached, the process became much simpler.

Still, covering all 108,000 stars with his violet blood was a laborious task.

Fortunately, the thing he was worried about didn’t occur. Before his violet blood was exhausted, he successfully covered the entire starry sea.

Long Chen finally sighed with relief. If the violet blood didn’t have enough power to cover the entire starry sea, he would have to immediately give up on this plan.

If he hadn’t gone through the divine pool’s baptism, which elevated his dragon blood, violet blood, and Supreme Blood to unprecedented levels, there would have been no way his violet blood could cover his entire starry sea. Previously, his coverage had been only two-dimensional. However, the starry sea was not merely a flat image—it was three-dimensional. Thus, covering it all required an unimaginable amount of energy.

Suddenly, the starry sea vanished and then reappeared. But this time, there were no astral fluctuations, only the power of his violet blood.

Long Chen extended his hand, palm facing up. When he activated the technique engraved on his soul, his violet blood starry sea slowly revolved, and the stars started contracting.

Suddenly, a burst of pain shot through Long Chen’s palm. A starry sea diagram appeared on his palm, and violet flames burst forth.

Remaining composed, Long Chen understood that this pain was an essential part of the process. He had to endure this tempering if he wanted to unleash the technique.

However, as time passed, the pain intensified astonishingly.

The Earth Cauldron had told him that the violet blood was the gentlest energy and the easiest to control. Yet, right from the outset, the pain was already difficult for Long Chen to endure.

His physical body had been trained to a level that countless people could only aspire to, but despite this, it fell short of the requirements necessary to unleash this technique. Otherwise, his hand wouldn’t hurt so much.

Behind him, the violet blood starry sea continued to contract, gradually forming a vague cross. A wound in a similar shape then appeared on his palm, where the violet blood continued to burn.

Long Chen’s arm started to throb from how intense the pain was. Long Chen was astonished. This technique is imbued with the gentlest violet blood. If it were astral energy, my hand would have burst long ago.

Gritting his teeth, Long Chen persevered. As time passed, the stars behind him continued to contract into the cross, gradually becoming clearer. With each moment, Long Chen gained a deeper understanding of the sheer power of this attack.

“I see. All my violet blood energy will be compressed into one attack!” Previously, Long Chen had only understood the basic principles of this technique. But now, as he personally put it into practice, he realized why this attack was so fearsome.

Perhaps once he mastered it, he would be able to regulate how much power to channel into it. However, not this time. He had to unleash his full power without holding back at all. That was the only way to guarantee he condensed the Cross Blood Rune and unleashed the attack.

Thus, cultivating this technique required the opposite approach from cultivating a regular one. Normally, when training in a new divine ability or magical art, one had to take it slowly. However, the God Slaying Cross required pushing the user to the limit in one go.

It was no wonder the Earth Cauldron had mentioned that even amongst the nine star line, only a few could control this technique. However, those who could were considered elites.

Cultivating it wasn’t about comprehension; it depended solely on whether the body could withstand the impact. It was straightforward and crude.

Luckily, the crude aspect was only for other nine star heirs. Long Chen was using a special trick to train in the God Slaying Cross.

After all, Long Chen had the right conditions to master this technique. By using his bloodline power first, he could simplify the process of unleashing the God Slaying Cross with his astral energy later. This approach would significantly reduce the difficulty and time required.

Amongst nine star heirs, even the fastest took a few months to master this technique. Slower individuals could take up to ten years, and if they couldn’t achieve an initial level of mastery within that time, they would have no hope of ever mastering it.

However, Long Chen didn’t need to do that. Once his physical body reached the necessary level, he could instantly master this technique.

As the violet blood starry sea continued to contract, Long Chen’s palm shook intensely. The pain made his face twist. Even with his high pain tolerance, the agony blurred his vision. He bit his lip until it bled to keep himself conscious.

If he couldn’t even endure the gentlest violet blood, how could he even talk about standing at the top? This was only a middle-tier divine ability of the nine star line.

What the Earth Cauldron hadn’t told Long Chen was that the nine star line had a special core technique for resisting pain. Nine star disciples wouldn’t be so foolish as to do it like this.

Suddenly, violet divine light unfurled on his palm. The violet starry sea behind him instantly vanished as Long Chen sensed all its power flow into his palm.

Startled, he hastily looked for a target. If he didn’t unleash this power somewhere, his entire arm would explode.

Fortunately, there was a giant rock inside the training room. Long Chen slammed his palm onto the rock, and for some reason, he suddenly shouted, “Blood Ocean - God Slaying Cross!”
