Chapter 943 Devil Execution Conference

Translator: BornToBe

“If only I had known how monstrous the Eastern Wasteland Bell was before. I should have planned things out properly.”

Long Chen had a face of regret as he sat in a private room. Who would have thought that the broken, practically crumbling apart Eastern Wasteland Bell would be so terrifying?

It killed half-step Kings without the slightest effort, and King items were nothing more than toys to it. The Eastern Wasteland Bell was incredibly powerful.

Right now, his strongest trump card had disappeared, but he still hadn’t gotten his revenge on Ji Changkong. He couldn’t help but feel a bit disappointed. If only he could have drawn over the ancient races and the Remote Heaven Gang together, he could have had the Eastern Wasteland Bell handle them all at the same time.

But regret had no use. The Eastern Wasteland Bell had already left. He didn’t even know if he would ever see it again.

Furthermore, there was something else that made him jittery. When he had advanced to Sea Expansion, that mysterious voice hadn’t appeared.

The pill formula for the fifth star of the Nine Star Hegemon Body Art also hadn’t appeared. Could it be that the fifth star required him to reach Foundation Forging first?

The Nine Star Hegemon Body Art was completely different from the other cultivation techniques he knew of. He couldn’t cultivate like others, making him feel unsure of what he was supposed to do. He still knew too little about the Nine Star Hegemon Body Art.

The fortunate thing was that other than the Nine Star Hegemon Body Art, he also had the Dragon Blood Body Tempering Art. The Green Dragon Battle Armor that he could summon was now his strongest trump card.

“Long Chen.” ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

Suddenly, the stone door to his room was pushed open. Ouyang Qiuyu walked in and sat in front of him.

“Is there any news?” asked Long Chen.

“The entire Eastern Wasteland is in upheaval,” sighed Ouyang Qiuyu.

How could it not be? The ancient races had moved out in full force to suppress the Xuantian Dao Sect. But as a result, they had been annihilated.

In truth, back then, the ancient races had intentionally drawn other people’s attention when they had moved out. Their excursion had been supposed to be a display of their might.

Countless people had been around and had activated photographic jades so that they could record the sight of the Xuantian Dao Sect being destroyed.

However, they had never imagined that what they would record was something even more shocking than the destruction of the Xuantian Dao Sect.

The entire Eastern Wasteland had been thrown into a state of panic, especially those smaller powers of the Xuantian Dao Sect that had sided with the Remote Heaven Gang. Each day, they had lived in fear that the Xuantian Dao Sect would find them to settle the bill.

The most fearful one would have to be the Remote Heaven Gang. Those who had committed shameful deeds were always the most terrified.

Right now, the Remote Heaven Gang was like an overturned nest of ants. They were doing everything they could to draw in other powers. It was unknown what methods they were using.

As Long Chen’s vicious methods shook the Eastern Wasteland, the Remote Heaven Gang managed to gather the majority of the powers within the Eastern Wasteland.

“Long Chen, do you really have the confidence?” Ouyang Qiuyu was worried. Although she didn’t know the Eastern Wasteland Bell’s origin and she hadn’t asked, it was clear that the Eastern Wasteland Bell had left after that one attack. She had seen that clearly.

The Eastern Wasteland Bell’s power had surpassed her understanding. But she knew such a divine weapon wasn’t something that would accept someone like Long Chen as a master. Otherwise, it would be under his control now.

It was obvious from its departure that it had only agreed to help Long Chen once. That was why Ouyang Qiuyu was worried.

Long Chen shook his head. “Nope. My strongest trump card is gone.”

“Then why don’t we slow things down and just wait a bit...” advised Ouyang Qiuyu. Long Chen was too ruthless. She had already alerted the head sect about this matter using a special spiritual message. They would quickly send experts to handle this matter.

In Ouyang Qiuyu’s opinion, the smartest decision was to wait for the head sect’s experts to arrive. After all, Long Chen had used up his trump card. If the Remote Heaven Gang had some unknown trump cards, it would be over for them.

“I understand. Sect master-”

“Call me big sister,” said Ouyang Qiuyu.

“Alright, big sister. I understand what you’re saying, but it’s useless.” Long Chen shook his head.

“What is useless? I don’t understand.”

Long Chen sighed. “In truth, during the Immemorial Path, I was always careful and tried not to make enemies or provoke anyone who didn’t provoke me. I did my best to protect my people. But when the time came, I was still surrounded by enemies. I was cautious, I was reserved, but I still caused Little Snow to die. This time, I’ve finally seen through who my true enemy is. It is these damn heavens. No matter how I scheme, I can’t outscheme the heavens. So now I can’t be bothered to scheme, nor do I care about other people’s schemes. I want to find my original mental state.

“I no longer trust in using smarts to handle my problems. I will only trust my power. I need to find my old self, that young, impetuous, and a bit foolish self that was full of hot blood. I have no schemes. I will simply bring my brothers to slaughter our enemies. If we encounter a mountain, we’ll split it. If we encounter a river, it will part for us. And if our lives aren’t hardy enough to survive, then we can all die together. Eighteen years later, we’ll have reincarnated and gathered back together, once more rising up to battle our enemies.”

Long Chen’s eyes shone with a determined light. He found that as his cultivation base increased, he had begun to lose his old self. If he had been vicious enough in the beginning, if he had paid any price to kill his opponents as soon as he had encountered them, who would still dare to provoke him?

Right now, what he needed to be was a madman, a bloodthirsty, merciless man. He would make all his enemies terrified of him, making it so no one dared to form the slightest bit of hostility against him.

He was extremely calm now. He no longer bothered scheming against his opponents’ trump cards. He couldn’t outscheme the heavens, so there was no point. His choice was to use the simplest, most direct method: fight with his life on the line.

Little Snow’s death had made him clearly see the essence of cultivation. All resources and opportunities were gained through killing and fighting. Since he had stepped onto the cultivation path, he couldn’t be kind or soft. That would cause his own death.

If it only caused his own death, then fine. But foolish kindness would also cause his people’s deaths as well. That was the most foolish part of it.

“Big sister, you don’t have to go with me. I-”

“In truth, this isn’t just for you. These thousand years of life were like a dream. I’ve seen people be born, mature, grow old, and die. I’ve seen joy, and I’ve seen sadness. I’ve seen twisted faces and ugly affairs. I’ve experienced much-”

“Big sister, are you tired of living?” Long Chen was startled.

“Brat, I’m living quite happily! How could I want to die?” Ouyang Qiuyu glared at him.

“Then that’s good. After all, I don’t have big sister’s experience-”

“Are you saying I’m old?!” Ouyang Qiuyu’s glare became even more vicious.

“No, no, definitely not!” Long Chen flapped his hand.

“If not, then shut your mouth. You really are becoming more and more irritating! I don’t know how you seduced those two beautiful girls. When I say I’ve experienced a great deal, what I mean is that it’s like I’ve been playing chess for hundreds of years. The chessboard is completely chaotic now. The reason I can only touch the barrier but am unable to become a half-step King is because of this. That’s why I’m prepared to go cause some trouble with you. By changing my mentality and viewing my path through another viewpoint, I want to see if I can use that opportunity to become a half-step King,” said Ouyang Qiuyu.

“Why just half-step King and not a full King?” asked Long Chen.

Ouyang Qiuyu sadly shook her head. “It’s not so easy. My Spirit Blood isn’t pure enough. Half-step King is my limit.”

“So that’s what it is.” Long Chen came to a sudden comprehension of why all those rank four Celestials would submit to Xue You, Yu Changhao, and the others.

It was all because of the purity of their Spirit Blood. Two people could both be rank four Celestials, but without pure enough Spirit Blood, a person’s cultivation base would forever be limited to half-step King.

Only people like Xue You and the others were able to cross that barrier and become true Kings.

“I would have forgotten about this if you hadn’t reminded me. Here.” Long Chen took out a small bottle. Inside was only a single drop of blood.

“This is... Ten Thousand Spirit Blood?” Ouyang Qiuyu was shocked.

“Correct. You already possess Spirit Blood, so this Ten Thousand Spirit Blood can make it even purer, allowing you to cross the barrier and become a King eventually.” Long Chen smiled.

“I...” Ouyang QIuyu’s expression was complicated as she looked at it.

“You should hurry and refine it. This Ten Thousand Spirit Blood is exceptionally profound. It actually contains a trace of heaven and earth’s laws, which will make it easier for you to comprehend the Heavenly Daos.”

Ouyang Qiuyu was silent for a long time before she finally accepted the Ten Thousand Spirit Blood. She entered seclusion.

Long Chen also gave another drop of Ten Thousand Spirit Blood to Shui Wuhen. He trusted the two of them.

This Ten Thousand Spirit Blood was incredibly important. It could activate a person’s Spirit Blood and was a heaven-defying treasure that could allow people to draw out their own attribute’s potential. Lord Heaveneye had essentially sacrificed hundreds of thousands of aboriginals to obtain this Ten Thousand Spirit Blood for him.

So Long Chen viewed it as exceptionally precious. Other than Ouyang Qiuyu and Shui Wuhen, he didn’t share it with anyone else.

The reason Ouyang Qiuyu was so moved wasn’t just because of the Ten Thousand Spirit Blood, but also because Long Chen had shared its secret existence with her. Now she understood why the Dragonblood Legion was so terrifying.

In truth, she didn’t know that the reason the Dragonblood Legion was so powerful was because of a combination of the Ten Thousand Spirit Blood, Heavenly Dao Fruits, and Divine Mortal Molting Elixir.

The days passed one by one. Long Chen kept a close eye over the state of affairs within the Eastern Wasteland. Finally, he received an invitation.

“Devil Execution Conference?”

Long Chen’s mouth curled into a disdainful smile. He directly ripped the invitation to shreds.

“Guo Ran, alert the sect master. We’re moving out.”

Long Chen looked into the distance, icy killing intent in his eyes. “Ji Changkong, I’ve given you plenty of time to prepare. Don’t disappoint me!”
