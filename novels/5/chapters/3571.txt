Chapter 3560

“Why?!”

Long Chen suddenly raised his head and roared. His voice was like thunder spreading throughout the nine heavens, causing the stars to quiver and the world to change color.

At the next moment, sinister dark energy gushed out from the bottom of Long Chen’s feet. It was like a devil that had been sealed for millions of years was now opening that seal. An ominous killing intent caused the Heavenly Daos to quiver.

In just the blink of an eye, the heavens turned dark and that evil aura covered this region, turning it into hell.

Long Chen’s eyes were pitch-black, like two black holes. His Purgatory Eyes were finally fully activated, and his aura had completely changed, becoming gloomy, cold, and bloodthirsty.

Gusts of wind blew through this hell-like world, and people felt a chill all the way down to their souls. The Heavenly Daos were stripped away, so this entire world seemed to have become a world of death.

“Hahaha!”

Long Chen suddenly raised his head and laughed.

“I’m finally out! I’m finally out! You suppressed me for so long. Starting today, I am the true Long Chen. All beings in this world must crawl beneath my feet! Submit to me and prosper, oppose me and perish!”

Long Chen’s voice was icy-cold. It was filled with a domineeringness that looked down on the nine heavens and also on all other lives. It was the voice of someone who took lives without feeling anything. The current him was truly like a devil god in control of the lives of all living beings.

Long Chen suddenly looked at the Raging Flame Heavenly Palace’s master, and the palace master’s hair instantly stood on end. An intense sensation of danger made him quiver. All of a sudden, he directly let go of Yu Qingxuan and fled.

Just as he fled, the black runes in Long Chen’s eyes circulated. Suddenly, a spatial gate appeared in front of the palace master, shocking him. But before he could react, he dove into it due to his momentum.

After that, another spatial gate appeared in front of Long Chen, and the palace master came flying out of it. An icy hand that had been waiting for him caught his throat.

Runes appeared all over the palace master’s body as he struggled. But those runes all winked out of existence just as they appeared. His body then quivered a few more times in Long Chen’s hand before suddenly stiffening and never moving again.

“How useless. You were forced to be in such desperate straits by this trash? If you had let me out sooner, I’d have long since swept through this world.” Long Chen looked at the palace master with a sneer.

Countless people were stunned. The current Long Chen was a completely different person. His aura was completely changed and the black aura coming from his body terrified every single person.

With a light squeeze, the palace master exploded in his hand without being able to make a sound.

“Save me!”

The palace master’s physical body was destroyed, but his Yuan Spirit appeared, still caught in Long Chen’s hand. He shrieked.

After that, black qi flowed out of Long Chen’s hand. Like flames, it burned the palace master’s Yuan Spirit. People were shocked to see that Yuan Spirit melting until it turned into nothingness.

Everyone felt a chill. The previous Long Chen whose power could swallow the heavens and slay Yan Hong had been shocking enough.

But the current Long Chen was even more terrifying. A seventh Heavenstage World King didn’t have the slightest power to resist in front of him.

Most shocking of all was that Long Chen was clearly out of energy before this and was preparing to flee. It was only due to the palace master using Yu Qingxuan as a hostage that he stayed behind.

Long Chen was like a devil god in this state, with black qi gushing out of him. He seemed stronger than ever. He was even more terrifying than the previous Long Chen. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

BOOM!

Suddenly, the void exploded and a giant claw reached through the void, smashing toward Long Chen with endless divine might.

“What?!”

“This aura…!”

“It’s… Yan Xu Flame!”

“Yan Hong didn’t die?!”

“No, this pressure is even greater than Yan Hong’s…”

Everyone jumped in terror when they saw that heaven-covering claw. Its flame aura was clearly that of the Yan Xu Flame, but the pressure that it exuded was over ten times greater than Yan Hong’s.

“You dared to slay my ninth brother?! Ignorant lifeform, do you know what kind of calamity you have provoked?!”

As the huge hand descended, a resounding voice rang out with endless fury.

Heaven and earth collapsed. This attack was completely unstoppable. Even late stage World Kings felt as insignificant as ants in front of this claw. If they touched it, they would definitely die.

“He’s Yan Hong’s big brother!”

People were shocked. In other words, this was another son of the Flame Sovereign. Furthermore, he was even more terrifying than Yan Hong.

In the face of that giant claw, Long Chen remained expressionless. His black eyes were entirely apathetic, as if nothing in this world could shake him.

Long Chen slowly reached out a hand toward that huge claw. His divine ring vanished and his starry river was gone. Instead, replacing them was a pair of eyes, a pair of absolutely emotionless eyes that were like that of a god’s.

BOOM!

Two hands of completely different proportions clashed. As heaven and earth were torn asunder, a ripple spread like a blade, cutting heaven and earth into two layers.

Moreover, people could see fragments of spacetime flying about in the air and freezing. They saw the world slowly split apart and then overlap each other.

When the broken parts of the world layered on top of each other, an even more terrifying power erupted. A black ripple once more spread in every direction, forming a region of death.

Within this region, the void was destroyed. The world was being destroyed and repaired over and over again.

As a result, those late stage World Kings that had been intent on taking Long Chen’s core flame were directly blasted to bits. Although they fled as soon as they sensed something off, they were still too late. Not even their Yuan Spirits could escape that darkness.

“Yan Xu World, Ten Thousand Daos Return to One!”

Suddenly, a furious roar rang out and black flames condensed into millions of chains that sealed heaven and earth. Long Chen instantly became trapped by those chains.

“Black World, No Laws, No Heaven!”

Long Chen formed hand seals and shouted as well. After that, black qi gushed out of his body, and a mark appeared within that pair of eyes behind him.

Those chains instantly exploded on contact with the black qi coming from his body, transforming into runes.

“The Ghost Sovereign’s mark?! Who are you?!” That voice was shocked and enraged. It actually recognized that mark behind Long Chen.

“Who cares- AH! Bastard, what are you doing?! Stop…!” Long Chen suddenly clutched his head and roared painfully.

“You useless trash, you aren’t qualified to control this body!” Long Chen roared. The darkness in his eyes gradually receded.

“AH! Infuriating! That damn bastard, that big brother of Yan Hong’s! He made me use too much power! I can’t suppress him. Just wait… Next time… I will kill you…” That icy voice let out an unwilling, furious roar.

By the time his voice faded, so had the black qi. Long Chen’s eyes returned to their normal color.

BOOM!

Just then, the shattered chains once more shot toward Long Chen. After that, Long Chen formed hand seals, and his divine ring appeared once more.

“Get in here!”
