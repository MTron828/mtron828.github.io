Chapter 1924: 1924

The Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow pierced through space rapidly .

“Long Chen, where are we going?” asked Meng Qi .

“Just go straight toward the eastern sea . Meng Qi, it’ll be hard on you, but maintain your spiritual senses . If you sense any powerful auras, immediately avoid them . ” Long Chen’s expression was grave .

“What is the matter?” asked Mo Nian .

“Have you forgotten? The main conspirators behind this scheme are Pill Valley and Heavenly Fate Island . Considering their characters, how could they let us run? We’ll definitely run into obstructions on our way, so everyone should be prepared,” said Long Chen .

“Fuck, no way! I just started being a good person, and I’m getting hunted down for it? I was able to get around when it was just me, but as soon as I go with you, I end up like this!” cursed Mo Nian .

He thought about how free he had been by himself . Now that he was fighting for the Martial Heaven Alliance, the Martial Heaven Alliance actually couldn’t protect him .

Long Chen smiled . “Don’t be resentful . As my brother, if I don’t con you, who else am I going to con?” Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

“Ah, that’s true . ” Hearing this, the curious thing was that Mo Nian actually smiled . “But there’s one thing I don’t understand . Why aren’t you angry?”

“Why would I be angry? I’m grateful for what I have . I’m a disciple of the Xuantian Dao Sect . Without the Xuantian Dao Sect, I wouldn’t have my current achievements . The Heaven Splitting Battle Sect is also my sect, and without the old man’s care, I might have long since died . Qu Jianying is the old man’s partner, and she cares so much about me she is willing to become enemies with the various powers of the world . In truth, although this war had been brewing for a long time thanks to certain people’s schemes, if it weren’t for me, senior Qu Jianying wouldn’t be forced into such a passive position . As men, if we dare to cause trouble, we have to accept the consequences . We can’t retreat from this, nor can we blame god or others-” said Long Chen righteously .

“Stop, stop! If you keep talking, I’ll look like a petty little person who forgets favors in comparison . I admit that you’re right, okay?” Mo Nian waved his hand in front of Long Chen . In terms of eloquence, he couldn’t compare to Long Chen . His conning ability was truly spectacular .

Suddenly, Cloud’s body turned . Everyone shook, almost falling .

“It’s as you said, Long Chen . There are experts trying to block us . I had Cloud avoid them,” said Meng Qi who was standing atop Cloud’s head, her expression grave .

“What level are they?” asked Mo Nian .

“I’m not sure . As soon as I sensed them, I had Cloud avoid them . ”

“Without thinking about it, since they were sent to stop us, they have to be Netherpassage experts,” said Long Chen .

Suddenly, Cloud began turning rapidly through the air . Meng Qi’s expression changed .

“Not good . The path ahead has been fully blocked . There’s three people ahead, and we have to charge past one of them . ”

“You pick one,” said Long Chen .

“Curious . How did they know where we’d run?” asked Mo Nian .

“You’re underestimating Heavenly Fate Island too much . For their island master to even personally come out, even if we have divine items protecting us, they should still be able to read some slight clues . If they didn’t have that little bit of power, Heavenly Fate Island wouldn’t have achieved their current position with just scams,” said Long Chen . “Zhiqiu, Mo Nian, Zifeng, come to the front . Prepare your attacks . Whether or not we can charge past is dependent on this strike . ”

Although Chu Yao, Liu Ruyan, and the others were also very powerful, they weren’t sharp enough . If too many people attacked at once, the Heavenly Dao energy in the surrounding space would become sparse .

Long Chen and Yue Zifeng weren’t Empyreans, and just Ye Zhiqiu and Mo Nian were enough . Any more and it would affect their attack power .

“Cloud, slow down and prepare yourself . ”

Long Chen took a deep breath . He raised his hand, and a black flame lotus began to condense in his hand . Following that, sacred chanting began to resound through the air .

The entire world felt like it had been ignited . Endless flame energy gathered into the flame lotus .

The flame lotus had nine petals, and each petal had a black sphere form at the top . As more flame energy was absorbed, runes began to light up along the petals, sending the flame energy to the spheres at the top of the petals .

A terrifying aura slowly rose, growing stronger and stronger . The flame lotus also grew until it was gigantic .

“World Annihilation Flame Lotus!”

Long Chen suddenly flung the flame lotus through the air .

Once he threw it out, Cloud sped up to follow it . The two of them charged through the air .

Sacred chanting continued to resound through the air, and the flame lotus only grew larger .

Just a moment later, they saw a giant net of twisting black and white energy . At the center of the net was an elder sitting in meditation .

He had actually used his life and death energy to lock this space down . There were also Netherpassage experts to his distant left and right to make sure that no one could get past .

When he sensed the flame lotus, the elder’s eyes popped upon . With a snort, a blade appeared in his hand . Divine light flashed .

BOOM!

The nine black spheres on the top of the lotus exploded . A terrifying explosion erupted .

The elder’s arm shook . He was surprised that this flame lotus possessed such explosive power . He was actually knocked back a few steps, and the net behind him trembled .

At the same time, Long Chen, Ye Zhiqiu, Mo Nian, and Yue Zifeng attacked . Two rays of Sword Qi, a saber-image, and an arrow shot out .

“Not good!” This strike was perfectly timed with the flame lotus . Hence, the elder had no chance to recollect himself . His blade rumbled and divine runes flew out .

BOOM!

His hasty block didn’t even have half his true power . He was knocked back, and he coughed up a mouthful of blood . It had to be known that this combined strike from Long Chen, Mo Nian, Ye Zhiqiu, and Yue Zifeng was something that even a Netherpassage expert couldn’t take lightly, let alone receive with just half their power .

However, a Netherpassage expert was still powerful . Although he had been injured, the net behind him didn’t break .

“Cloud!” shouted Long Chen .

Runes suddenly appeared in Cloud’s eyes . Two rays of light shot out, striking his net .

“Hmph, you think you can break my domain?! Keep dreaming!” The elder was shocked and enraged . To be injured by Soul Transformation disciples was an insult .

Although this injury was nothing to him, it still infuriated him . Seeing Cloud attack his net, which was a condensation of his life and death domain, he snorted . His blade slashed down .

However, unexpectedly, when Cloud’s attack landed, it formed a ripple that spread to form a giant black hole . Cloud’s body entered the ripple and then vanished .

The elder’s blade landed on thin air . His life and death domain was still present, but Long Chen and the others had already vanished .

“But... how is that possible?” The elder was dumbfounded . He suddenly thought of a kind of divine ability that the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow possessed that could ignore spatial bindings: the Heaven Swallowing Voidbreaker .

However, the Heaven Swallowing Voidbreaker divine ability could only be used by descendants that possessed extremely pure bloodlines . Furthermore, they had to have advanced to the eleventh rank first . These two requirements were a must, and yet Cloud had done it at just the tenth rank .

“Damnit, they got away . ”

At this moment, the two other Netherpassage experts rushed over . The plan had been for the three of them to cooperate . Together, Long Chen and the others stood no chance .

However, this flawless plan had actually met with failure . Looking at the direction Long Chen had gone, they didn’t know what to do .

“Do we chase?”

“That’s no good . The Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow’s speed is number one in the world . Even the Golden Peng race has to concede defeat in that regard, so there’s no way we can catch up . Hurry and report what happened here . Have the higher-ups think of something,” said the injured Netherpassage expert . Sighing, he had no choice but to admit that he had been too careless .

...

“Hahaha, success!” Mo Nian laughed . The others sighed, relaxing .

“Long Chen, what is it?” Meng Qi saw that Long Chen wasn’t smiling .

“I keep feeling like something’s wrong . ” Long Chen shook his head . Li Tianxuan had told him that no one could calculate anything about him . If others were with him, their fates were linked with his, so Heavenly Fate Island shouldn’t be able to calculate anything about Mo Nian or Ye Zhiqiu either . Therefore, they shouldn’t be able to track their location and direction so easily .

“Fuck, what is this?! Long Chen, you’ve all been expelled from the Martial Heaven Alliance!” Mo Nian suddenly took out a jade plate on his waist .

“Yes, I know . I discussed it with the Xuan Master before leaving . This is the only way to resolve the current crisis . ” Long Chen nodded .

“What the fuck? Haven’t you become everyone’s target then?!” Mo Nian was speechless .

“I’m used to it . We would have left the Xuantian Dao Sect and the Martial Heaven Alliance sooner or later . Leaving now or later makes no difference,” said Long Chen . “Meng Qi, help me examine everyone spiritually . See if anyone left a spiritual mark on us . ”

However, even after a couple of hours, Meng Qi shook her head . She hadn’t found anything odd, making Long Chen frown . This kind of result meant that they either weren’t tracking them this way, or whoever had done it was at such a supreme level that even Meng Qi’s Spiritual Strength was unable to expose them .

After hours of flight, Cloud had already crossed the Eastern Xuan Region and reached the Martial Heaven Sea-Ring . Cloud’s speed was truly amazing .

BOOM!

Suddenly, the seawater exploded . A giant sea demon charged out, trying to bite Cloud .
