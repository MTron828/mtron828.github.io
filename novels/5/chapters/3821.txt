Chapter 3810 Have Another

Countless people kowtowed toward this middle-aged man when he appeared.

“City lord!”

This middle-aged man looked at Long Chen frostily. There was the slightest hint of trepidation in his eyes. Just now, he had attacked silently without any warning, so he hadn’t expected this black-robed man to be able to block him.

As the lord of Silver Moon City, his power naturally had to be high enough to intimidate other experts who might come. Otherwise, there was no way for him to occupy any territory within the three thousand worlds.

The city lord’s aura was hidden, and people couldn’t even sense his existence. However, when he appeared, everyone’s heart shook. This person seemed to have reached the point of merging into heaven and earth. He represented this city and this world. It was like he was the master of everyone’s life here.

This was an absolutely terrifying existence, an almighty expert that people couldn’t fathom. It was like a thought from him could wipe all of them out, and they wouldn’t even be able to resist.

“Father, kill them!” shouted the junior city lord impatiently when he saw his father just sizing up Long Chen and the others.

Long Chen raised his hand, once more sending the junior city lord’s face to Xia Chen. Xia Chen then slapped him sixteen times, causing the latter’s face to bleed again.

Everyone was shocked. To slap the city lord’s son right in front of him, that was no different than slapping his face.

As expected, the city lord’s expression sank and fury rose out of him. “Are you going to force this lord to kill you?”

“I don’t believe you dare to fight here unless you no longer care about this city. Furthermore, even if you did, even if I couldn’t beat you, I can easily retreat. If I want to leave, no one here can stop me. However, after the battle, there would no longer be a Silver Moon City, and as the city lord, you would become a laughingstock. Of course, you can treat this as me just trying to scare you. You can entirely try to test me and see if I’m just saying big words,” said Long Chen lightly.

Long Chen was fully confident now. His seven stars were activated, and his meridians had been rebuilt. As a result, his former cautiousness was thrown away. His mind felt clearer, and his confidence was steadier than ever. He was even more domineering than before.

This was confidence in one’s own power. It could be said that the dragon expert’s arrangements had benefited him immensely.

Thus, even in front of a terrifying existence that he had never encountered before, Long Chen was still full of confidence, as if everything was under his control.

The city lord suddenly smiled. “Not bad. Youngsters should have this courage and vision. This matter is nothing more than a misunderstanding. My son was foolish and he was used by others. I hope you can give me face and let him off. I can let bygones be bygones.”

These words shocked everyone here. Was he looking for peace? When did he become so soft?

However, some people were sneering sinisterly inside. This was clearly a lie. If Long Chen handed over the junior city lord, the city lord would no longer have any misgivings. He wouldn’t instantly kill them.

The city lord was treating them too lightly. This could only trick someone with small guts, so Ji Wuming smiled mockingly. As expected, a foolish son was raised by a foolish father.

Have Long Chen hand over his hostage? That was a huge joke. It seemed that his wisdom had not grown even after all his years of life.

“Unacceptable!”

Even before Long Chen responded, the junior city lord started roaring again.

“I want to kill them! They hit me! I’ll kill their whole family, their entire bloodline!”

This roar caused countless people to shake their heads. This fellow’s foolishness was unparalleled. Even at this time, he was still trying to threaten others. Claiming that he would kill their entire family and bloodline? Was that no different than courting death?

“Shut up!”

The city lord’s expression sank, and he shouted at his foolish son furiously.

There was no way for him to transmit messages to his son spiritually. His son’s soul was entirely under Long Chen’s purview. Also, the city lord had already given him a meaningful glance, but this idiot hadn’t understood.

“No, I want them dead-!”

Long Chen then slapped him. Even though Long Chen wasn’t using any power, his face still caved in. He instantly fainted.

“So loud.”

Long Chen frowned. After this slap, things quietened down. But the city lord’s expression had become even uglier.

“What do you want?” asked the city lord darkly.

“I, Long Chen, never threaten others.” Long Chen raised the unconscious man in his hand. His body quivered and he instantly woke up.

“What does that mean?” The city lord’s expression suddenly changed.

“AH!”

The junior city lord screamed like a pig being slaughtered. It seemed he was suffering unbearable pain.

“You don’t understand? Your son wants to kill me. He wants to kill my whole family and my whole bloodline. Do you think I can let him live?” asked Long Chen coldly.

“You dare?!”

“Take advantage of your youth to have another kid!”

BOOM!

The next moment, Long Chen’s hand quivered and the junior city lord exploded, his soul extinguished. He was killed by Long Chen just like that.

“DIE!”

The city lord’s palm crashed down on Long Chen. At the same time, countless runes lit up on the ground. The entire world was covered by some mysterious energy.

“Split the Heavens 1!”

When Long Chen slashed the Minghong Saber, violet qi swirled and his saber cry shook the heavens. The violet qi in his meridians was crazily compressed, causing explosive power to gush out.Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

BOOM!

All of Silver Moon City shook. Some buildings became covered in fine cracks from the intense shaking.

After their collision, Long Chen was forced back a few steps, while the city lord was also knocked back. They were evenly matched. However, their terrifying power shook countless people.

Within the crowd, Ji Wuming narrowed his eyes. “Master really was right. This Long Chen is definitely a terrifying existence. I cannot be the slightest bit careless.”

Those as powerful as Ji Wuming, the Nine Underworld Luocha, Yin Changsheng, and Mo Nian could instantly see that this was not a full-power attack. It was but a quick attack.

The city lord had given no chance for Long Chen to accumulate power. Hence, he had used his full speed to attack and kill Long Chen before he could summon his power.

For an ordinary expert, such an attack would definitely lead to death. The city lord was relying entirely on his realm advantage to crush Long Chen.

However, what he didn’t know was that Long Chen’s meridians had been strengthened many times over. He was able to fully unleash his power in one go.

For most people, unleashing their power was like boiling cold water. They needed a warm-up before they reached their full power. However, Long Chen was able to boil the water in an instant. That kind of explosive might shocked everyone.

Long Chen rested the Minghong Saber on his shoulder. Appearing incredibly domineering, he coldly said, “Do you want my life or do you want your city?”
