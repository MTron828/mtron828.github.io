Chapter 2552 Absolute Power Suppression

Balls of light appeared, looking like stars in the sky. Those were the disciples that were leaving the Star Field Divine World. At this time, it was impossible to see who was who within that light. However, everyone was searching for the auras that they were most familiar with.

“What?!”

The arrogant sea demons’ expressions fell. They could only sense the auras of a few sea demons.

However, the worst thing was that they didn’t sense the existence of the prince of the Six Horn Sea Serpent race.

As the crowned elder of the sea demon race was also from the Six Horn Sea Serpent race, he began to grow uneasy.

The sea demon race was not the only ones whose expressions fell, there was also the Corrupt path. At this moment, Xie Wentian and the others could sense no more than a thousand Corrupt disciples amongst those balls of light. Where had the Corrupt path’s army of hundreds of thousands gone?

Furthermore, Tian Xiezi’s aura was not present. The only thing that made Xie Wentian feel slightly better was that Ye Ming’s aura was still there.

Meanwhile, Di Long turned pale. He no longer had his dignified appearance of having victory in grasp. He couldn’t find Di Feng’s aura.

Only the Martial Heaven Alliance, Beitang family, Nangong family, Mo family, Xuan Beasts, and some neutral powers gradually smiled. They could sense the majority of those familiar auras. They relaxed ever so slightly.

However, those balls of light were still shining brightly. They could only barely sense auras but not see their appearances.

“Long Chen, Lingshan, and the others are all alive. Hehe, I told you that they’d be fine,” laughed the old man.

“Look at the Corrupt path, sea demon race, and ancient family alliance. It seems that they aren’t too happy.” Li Tianxuan smiled slightly. He had the most confidence in Long Chen.

Hearing him, the others looked over to see that those people’s expressions were truly ugly.

“Could it be…”

Suddenly, one ball of light shot out like a shooting star at another. Even before leaving the balls of light, whoever was inside was attacking.

BOOM!

The other ball of light exploded and a wretched figure appeared, flying back.

“Dongfang Yuyang?”

The one inside the ball of light was the Dongfang family’s peak genius. He appeared panicked and hastily fled.

BOOM!

The other ball of light that had attacked him exploded, revealing Long Chen.

“Last time, I let you off too easily by killing you. Thank you for giving me another chance.”

Lightning wings spread on Long Chen’s back, and his figure vanished, reappearing in front of Dongfang Yuyang. His speed was shocking.

On the Martial Heaven Continent, with the familiar laws and space, his speed increased. It was because Lei Long had been impacted by the Star Field Divine World.

“Long Chen, you killed Di Feng and the young king of the sea demon race, suppressed Zhao Ritian, and almost wiped out the sea demon race and the Corrupt path’s disciples! Do you think you can leave this place alive?!” roared Dongfang Yuyang.

“What?!”

This roar from Dongfang Yuyang was transmitted into the ears of every single person present, shocking everyone. Was this really true?

The Dongfang family, sea demon race, and the Corrupt path’s expressions all changed. Furthermore, the three Sovereign sprouts of the divine families were startled. Zhao Ritian had been suppressed?

“You won’t get to see whether or not I live,” sneered Long Chen. He knew that Dongfang Yuyang was trying to get everyone to attack him, so that Dongfang Yuyang would have a chance to slip away.

However, Long Chen didn’t care. His astral spaces shuddered with a terrifying power. Upon entering the twelfth Heavenstage of Netherpassage, Long Chen learned how to focus all his power into one spot.

His fist howled through the air and seemed covered by countless stars. Even heaven and earth were suppressed by this fist. There was nowhere to run.

“I’ll go all-out against you!” Dongfang Yuyang roared, and his manifestation burst into existence, shocking everyone.

“Isn’t that Shi Lingfeng’s manifestation? The Stone Emperor’s manifestation!”

“There’s also the Blood Emperor’s manifestation and the Peng Emperor’s manifestation! Heavens, how can he possess so many manifestations?!”

Everyone was stunned. Shi Lingfeng, Kung Pengzi, and Xue Luocha’s manifestations had been seen by many people before. Those were the manifestations of Emperors. After just one look, it was impossible to forget them.

For Dongfang Yuyang to summon three Emperor manifestations at once, they immediately thought of Daoist Heavenly Feather’s words.

“He really is a Heaven-Seizer!” Furious roars rang out. People glared at the Dongfang family head, killing intent blazing within them.

BOOM!

The void erupted as though a sun had exploded. Long Chen’s fist then smashed into Dongfang Yuyang’s sword, which instantly exploded along with the three Emperor manifestations. After that, Dongfang Yuyang hacked up blood.

“What?!”Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

Just now, they had sensed the auras of the Peng Emperor, Stone Emperor, and the Blood Emperor on Dongfang Yuyang’s sword. That meant even with the power of three Emperors concentrated into his sword, he was unable to beat Long Chen’s simple punch.

“Long Chen is far more terrifying than before.” The Martial Heaven Continent’s experts were all amazed. Just what had happened to Long Chen inside of the Star Field Divine World for him to have such a transformation?

What he was facing was a Heaven-Seizer, a forbidden existence. The latter had concentrated the power of three Emperors but was still unable to receive a single attack from Long Chen. Hence, everyone was dumbfounded. Was the power of a Heaven-Seizer not as great as they had expected?

Furthermore, from their previous words, it seemed that Long Chen had killed Dongfang Yuyang once. But it seemed to have been a clone.

Dongfang Yuyang hastily retreated as he hacked up blood. However, Long Chen’s hand reached out like a sharp claw, grabbing Dongfang Yuyang’s fist and pulling.

As a result, Dongfang Yuyang shrieked. His arm was torn off.

“Dongfang Yuyang, you can only hide behind your sinister schemes. When it comes to true power, you’re dogshit. Your word is worth even less than dogshit. Did a little despicable person like you rely on these little schemes to become an expert? You must have been dreaming. Real experts are created through true power. To use the old man’s words, in front of absolute power, all schemes are meaningless,” Long Chen sneered and waved his hand. The torn-off arm then exploded and Long Chen moved toward Dongfang Yuyang once again.

“Hehe, that’s just what I said. At least he remembered those words.” The old man smiled, pleased.

Having lost an arm, Dongfang Yuyang flew back, trying to reach the other experts of the Dongfang family. He begged for assistance.

Those Dongfang family experts also charged over to save him, however, space shuddered, revealing a blue barrier around the spatial door, separating Dongfang Yuyang from the other experts of the Dongfang family.

“The world wall is still present. It is impossible to enter that space!”

The world gate was still slowly closing. Only once it was fully closed would that space be opened.

Hence, Dongfang Yuyang was knocked back by the world wall, allowing Long Chen to grab his other arm and tear it off.

Long Chen then kicked Dongfang Yuyang’s abdomen, sending him flying and causing his abdomen to cave in. More blood was hacked out.

“As a Heaven-Seizer, you should have endured until you had reached the point of controlling this world. In terms of martial power, you aren’t my match. In terms of intelligence, you’re an idiot. Other than managing to reach new levels of despicableness, you are nothing.”

The other arm in Long Chen’s hand also exploded. After that, he began advancing toward Dongfang Yuyang step by step.

Dongfang Yuyang continued to hack up blood. Both his arms had been torn off, and blood had turned his white robes scarlet. His handsome face was now twisted in bitterness and fear.

He clenched his teeth. In the Star Field Divine World, he had had a fortuitous encounter that allowed him to create a substitute with the exact same power as the true body. Such a substitute was exceedingly rare. Hence, he hadn’t expected that this substitute would actually be destroyed by Long Chen.

At that time, he had been traumatized. It was fortunate that it had been his substitute and not his true body, or he would already be dead. The power that Long Chen had displayed terrified him.

During this entire time, he had been hiding in the Star Field Divine World, not even daring to go searching for treasures.

He had thought that now that he had left the Star Field Divine World, he would be safe. However, he hadn’t expected Long Chen to take advantage of this moment when the world wall had yet to fade to attack him.

Long Chen’s attacks contained terrifying power that suppressed the Heavenly Daos and Dongfang Yuyang’s core energy. Hence, he couldn’t heal. Having lost both his arms, he appeared incredibly miniscule to the domineering Long Chen. Seeing Long Chen walk toward him like a death god, he was lost in terror.

“Feng Fei, Ye Ming, Pill Fairy, come save me! We are allies!”

Not one ball of light responded to him.

“You can shout until you break your throat. Those balls of light contain the final blessing of the Star Field Divine World. Other than me, no one else is willing to give up that blessing to look after you,” sneered Long Chen. He stepped toward Dongfang Yuyang.

Outside the world wall, the Dongfang family head began to beg Ye Liangchen to intervene. After all, the Dongfang family had cast their lot toward the Ye family, becoming their subordinates.

Ye Liangchen then frowned and suddenly shouted, “Long Chen, release Dongfang Yuyang, and I can give you a chance to live.”

BOOM!

Dongfang Yuyang’s body exploded. Carrying his head, Long Chen turned to look at Ye Liangchen.

“From which rat-bastard hole did you climb out of? My mood’s not very good, so don’t try to court death today.”
