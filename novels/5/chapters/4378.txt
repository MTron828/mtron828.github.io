Chapter 4367 Mountains of Corpses

The spear made of a golden elephant tusk exploded. However, what replaced it was a starry river spear containing unmatched destructive power.

BOOM!

When this new spear struck the Eternal expert’s spear, the power of the starry river erupted. The Eternal expert then crumbled out of existence along with his spear.

Starlight filled the sky, but the Eternal expert was gone, leaving no trace behind, not even his corpse.

“How can this be? That’s an Eternal expert! Even if his physical body was destroyed, at least his bones should remain!”

Long Chen’s attack not only scared his enemies but also his allies. They were all stunned.

This attack had exceeded the scope of their understanding. Given just how powerful the body of an Eternal expert was, even a drop of their blood would stain the ground for tens of thousands of years.

However, after this attack, that Eternal expert from the Dragon Elephant race was wiped out of existence, not even his bones remaining. If the onlookers hadn’t witnessed the explosive death firsthand, they might suspect that he had been mysteriously transported elsewhere.

BANG!

Just as Long Chen wiped out the Eternal expert, Huo Linger’s cage compressed to the limit, and the Shadow expert was crushed to nothing.

As for the remaining four geniuses who tried to save him, they were unable to reach Huo Linger, as Bai Shishi, Gu Yang, Xia Chen, and Guo Ran blocked them.

“Dragonblood Cross Slash!”

Guo Ran was the fastest. As he raised his sabers at his target, his battle armor lit up. The Dragonblood warriors behind him unleashed their powerful Blood Qi as well, and dragon cries rang out.

The expert Guo Ran had set his sights on was a greater demon with overflowing demonic qi. The latter then opened his mouth and spat out a blood arrow.

It was a simple move but contained his full power. As one of the peak experts of the Great Desolate World, he had his own pride and his own temper. After all, two of their Great Lords had been wiped out in the first clash. If they didn’t counterattack now, the Great Desolate World would become laughingstocks. As a result, he wanted to kill Guo Ran in one move to win back the face of the Great Desolate World. Even knowing that Guo Ran was just one of Long Chen’s subordinates, this demon expert unleashed his full power with this attack, as this was their one chance to win back face.

The Eternal experts of the Great Desolate World were already charging over. As long as this demon expert killed his target instantly, then in the future, he would be the greatest heavenly genius of the Great Desolate World.

BOOM!

A giant cross smashed into the blood arrow, and the latter was instantly crushed, like tofu being struck by an iron hammer. It wasn’t even able to halt the giant cross.

“Impossible!”

The greater demon was stunned. Before he could react, the Dragonblood Cross Slash already blasted through his attack and struck him, blowing him apart.

The attack continued, leaving a giant cross shape in the void wherever it passed.

The cross left behind flames in its wake; that was the laws of the Grand Dao being incinerated. The sheer magnitude of this attack left countless onlookers astounded, including Guo Ran.

However, Guo Ran reacted the fastest. After he rested his sabers on his shoulders, he arrogantly said, “What Six Great Lords? You aren’t even able to receive a single attack from me, but you dare to call yourselves great?”

Guo Ran’s voice echoed throughout the air. With his flashy battle armor, he appeared incredibly powerful and arrogant. The enormous cross lingered in the void before him.

The Dragonblood warriors were left speechless. The attack had evidently been the culmination of all their combined power to kill their opponent, yet in Guo Ran’s words, it was just a single casual blow from him.

However, they were already used to Guo Ran’s shamelessness. If he didn’t show off when he had such a good opportunity, he wouldn’t be Guo Ran.

The Dragonblood warriors knew his antics, but the others wouldn’t. They thought that this casual blow from Guo Ran didn’t seem inferior to that of Long Chen.

After Guo Ran killed his target in one move, Xia Chen, Gu Yang, and Bai Shishi clashed with the other three experts.

Gu Yang and Bai Shishi unleashed their full power. Facing the Great Desolate World’s strongest experts of the junior generation, they naturally couldn’t hold back.

As for Xia Chen, he was even more ruthless. With a wave of his hand, tens of thousands of talismans flew out, each of them being a killing talisman. Following that, all kinds of energies condensed. Some talismans transformed into prisons, some transformed into beasts, and some even took human form and detonated after charging at their target.

The Great Desolate World’s experts had never encountered experts like them. The three Great Lords were pressed back, barely able to hold them off. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

“Kill!”

At this time, the Dragonblood warriors flooded forward. Wielding their growth-type Eternal divine weapons, they started a slaughter. Every stroke of their sword would kill one of the experts of the Great Desolate World.

The Great Desolate World’s experts gathering here today were all powerful figures of the junior generation, elites amongst elites. However, even if they were all Triple Supremes, they were nothing in front of the Dragonblood warriors.

The Dragonblood warriors unleashed their might like tigers freed from their cages, demonstrating incomparable savagery. Every single one of their moves seemed almost suicidal, as if they were willing to throw their lives away just to bring down their opponents.

Ever since the Great Desolate World had crushed the human race, a battle of this magnitude had never unfolded. As a result, neither the junior nor senior generations ever confronted enemies as savage as the Dragonblood warriors.

In the first clash between the two armies, the Great Desolate World’s experts instantly crumbled. The air was filled with the gruesome spectacle of flesh and blood. Terror gripped their hearts, compelling them to retreat.

After that, their morale instantly plummeted, and the Dragonblood warriors slaughtered them easily.

The Great Desolate World’s experts outnumbered them ten to one, but the moment the Dragonblood Legion stepped forward, they were utterly defeated.

It had to be known that the other human experts had not even attacked yet. Around five thousand Dragonblood warriors were already enough to terrify them.

Hence, when the Starry River Sect’s warriors and the rest of the human race’s experts fell upon them, this battlefield became a slaughter ground. The earth was instantly dyed red with blood.

“Kill them! Don’t retreat! Cut off their rear and slaughter the human race!”

At this moment, a furious roar rang out, accompanied by an eruption of devil qi. An Eternal expert of the devil race had come. After that, more and more Eternal auras erupted. The Great Desolate World’s Eternal experts were revealing themselves.

“Brothers of the Dragonblood Legion, we’ve come from the mortal world to the immortal world, and we’ve never done something like wiping out an entire race. However, today, these foes before you wish to wipe out the entire human race. There is no more mercy. Slaughter them all! Every lifeform from the Great Desolate World will be slain today to avenge the humans they slaughtered! Teach them what respect is! Today, we will kill them until rivers of blood flow, until mountains of corpses pile up!” shouted Long Chen.

Killing intent ignited in his eyes as the seed of slaughter, confined deep within his soul, gradually broke free from its seal. A power that Long Chen had long restrained now stirred awake.

Long Chen’s golden wings quivered, propelling him through the battlefield toward the incoming devil expert. He raised his hand, summoning the Seven Peak Sword into existence, and with a swift motion, he slashed it through the air.
