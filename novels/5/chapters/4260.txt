Chapter 4249 Xu Xin-er’s Trump Card

The violet-gold bell quivered and rapidly grew. From within it, a spatial gate opened, and enormous figures appeared one after another. Their terrifying pressure crashed down on everyone.

“Storm Heaven Devouring Python!”

“Blue Eye Golden Scale Eagle!”

“Blood Mark Sabertooth Tiger!”

“Heavens, those are all beasts with immemorial bloodlines! Aren’t they extinct long ago?!”

These three immemorial beasts had desolate qi around them and were ancient species with pure bloodlines.

These beasts should have gone extinct in the immemorial era. But now, three of them had appeared at once.

These three immemorial beasts gave off terrifying auras. However, their cultivation bases were locked into the Immortal King realm. They were clearly Xu Xin-er’s housepets.

After all, a housepet’s cultivation base couldn’t be higher than its master, or it was all too likely for it to devour its master. But even though their cultivation bases were suppressed to the Immortal King realm, their auras caused countless Triple Supremes to quiver.

These three beasts came from ancient times, so their combat prowess undoubtedly exceeded that of the current era's heavenly geniuses. After all, back in that time, the laws of the Heavenly Daos were complete, and the density of spiritual qi couldn’t be compared to now.

After summoning these three immemorial beasts, Xu Xin-er stood atop the Blood Mark Sabertooth Tiger. It let out a roar, its eyes turning scarlet, as it instantly entered a state of bloodthirsty frenzy. The other two immemorial beasts followed suit, enveloped by a whirl of Blood Qi.

“Long Chen, are you prepared to die?!” shouted Xu Xin-er.

“I’m always prepared to die. But not because of you,” said Long Chen indifferently.

Long Chen had long since been mentally prepared. He knew that Xu Xin-er’s violet-gold bell was not a fighting Eternal divine weapon.

From the moment she first used it to grab the Violet Pupil Nine Tail Fox, Long Chen already knew that it was a special treasure with its own internal space.Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

Although these three beasts were powerful, they didn't possess the level of power to instill fear in Long Chen.

“You fool, do you think that Yifeng lost to your hands? He only lost to his own carelessness, unable to even unleash a tenth of his power. A single mistake set off a chain reaction from which he couldn't recover. If you were to truly fight, you wouldn’t be a match for him!” declared Xu Xin-er. It seemed that she felt that Xu Yifeng’s death was extremely unfair.

“If your Xu family has a way to drag him from hell, I’ll give him a chance to fight me fairly,” said Long Chen.

“You…!” Xu Xin-er quivered with rage. After all, Xu Yifeng was fully dead. Just how were they supposed to drag him back?

“Idiot, even now, have you not noticed? Everyone who exchanged blows with you was holding back! That’s the only reason why you’re still alive!”

“Oh? Is that so?” Long Chen acted like he had no idea.

Xu Xin-er sneered, “They’re all holding back to fight for the karmic luck bead at the end.”

“Stop spouting nonsense!”

In the distance, Lian Wuying’s expression changed. She shouted sternly, sensing a foreboding unease creeping over her.

“I’m spouting nonsense? You idiots, you just watched as Xu Yifeng died! Now you’re going to criticize me?” Xu Xin-er sneered.

Clearly, Xu Xin-er harbored a deep-seated resentment toward everyone present. After all, they had only watched as Xu Yifeng was slain.

“He can only blame himself for his death. He lacked the ability to fight yet still had to make himself stand out. His death cannot be blamed on others,” sneered Lian Wuying.

“His death cannot be blamed on others? Then I can say whatever I want, and it won’t have anything to do with you! So shut the fuck up!” cursed Xu XIn-er.

“You are courting death!” Lian Wuying’s killing intent rose.

“You want to kill me? Let’s see if you have that ability!” taunted Xu Xin-er. She then turned back to Long Chen. “All the peak experts here are holding back. They haven’t even used half of their power because their goal is the karmic luck bead. Once the ceremony is complete, the karmic luck bead will explode. Then its fragments will fly out in every direction. Anyone who grabs them can absorb their karmic luck, and with that karmic luck-”

“Shut up, you crazy bitch!” Ye Wuchen roared furiously. He had the urge to kill Xu Xin-er right here and now.

Numerous experts on the battlefield fell into a stupor. Xu Xin-er actually knew why this Sage King Convention was different. Furthermore, it seemed that quite a few others also knew of it.

Xu Xin-er seemed to have gone insane. It seemed that she was going for broke, wanting to expose this secret so that every person knew it. Hearing this, even the people attacking the Dragonblood Legion slowed down their assault.

“Shut up? Why should I shut up? You just watched as Xu Yifeng died! You thought that it was a good chance to get rid of one of your competitors, didn’t you?! Fine, Xu Yifeng is dead now! I, Xu Xin-er, am no longer interested in the karmic luck fragments. I only want Long Chen’s death, but I won’t let you take the upper hand either. Those who knew this secret in the Xu family were only me and Xu Yifeng. Less than a hundred people in total knew of this. Hehe, but rather than a hundred people splitting the karmic luck bead, have fun splitting it with every single person here! Hey, you idiots, others incited you to throw your lives away, and you didn’t even realize why! You’ve all fallen for their trap-!”

Suddenly, the void twisted, and a sword slashed through the air. Ye Wuchen finally couldn’t endure it any longer.

Even when Ye Wuchen attacked, Xu Xin-er didn’t turn to look at him. Instead, the giant python beside her stuck out its long tongue, accurately wrapping it around him.

Ye Wuchen’s expression changed as a chill ran down his spine. At this moment, a sensation of death welled up within his heart.

Ye Wuchen suddenly vanished, and the python’s tongue missed.

However, at that moment, countless people let out startled cries. The python's tongue had left a dark streak in the air as it swept past, resembling a spatial crack that didn’t heal for a long time.

“Heavens, even the laws are being corroded!”

That python’s tongue had to have some powerful poison on it. If one were ensnared by it, there might not be even a trace of their bones left behind.

“You want to silence me? Keep dreaming! The Xu family’s power isn’t something that you can imagine! If you think that just because Xu Yifeng is dead, the Xu family is easy to bully, you are truly blind! In any case, I’m no longer after the karmic luck bead. But if I can’t obtain it, I’m not going to let the rest of you obtain it for free! You idiots that are still fighting, stop being used by others! Your lives and blood are the key to activating the ceremony. Wouldn’t it be better to save your energy for the final competition for the fragments of karmic luck? Your leaders view you merely as tools and sacrificial lambs!” announced Xu Xin-er.

“Don’t listen to her! She’s gone insane!”

However, those shouts were ineffective. The people attacking the Dragonblood Legion retreated, all of them warily looking at each other. They didn’t know who to listen to, but they felt that Xu Xin-er’s words sounded more believable.

A strange atmosphere covered the martial stage.
