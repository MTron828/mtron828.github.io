Chapter 2935 Bad News

“I didn’t think that the Luo family would produce such an idiot. He actually pushed out boss San,” said Li Cai angrily on the way back to the outer academy.

Long Chen shook his head indifferently. “Even if they invited me, I wouldn’t join the Luo Alliance. I don’t like groups.”

Long Chen felt like his actions just now had been a bit inappropriate. He was still a bit too childish. He had never planned to join, so why did he get angry now?

Perhaps it was because the Luo family was his mother’s family, so he couldn’t endure thinking that his mother’s family would have such idiots.

“Long Chen, wait a moment.”

Just at this moment, Luo Bing, Luo Ning, and the others rushed over. Luo Bing was extremely apologetic. “I’m really sorry Long Chen.”

“There’s nothing to be sorry about. I wasn’t planning on joining any guild,” said Long Chen.

“No, it’s not the same. Luo Qingyang treated you with such an attitude, so I’m sorry for subjecting you to that,” said Luo Bing.

“My big sister actually had a fight with Luo Qingyang because of you. We’re planning on establishing our own Luo Alliance,” said Luo Ning. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

Long Chen solemnly said, “That wouldn’t be good. You’re essentially splitting the Luo family’s forces. It will only make it easier for Chu Yang to defeat you.”

“I know. But Luo Qingyang is too narrow-hearted to focus on the Luo family’s future development. Also, I wish to establish my own Luo Alliance because I don’t want to have to fight with him over strategy. I’ll report this to the family after I establish it. If our Luo Alliance’s power surpasses Luo Qingyang’s, then according to the rules, I can take in the old alliance and become the leader of both. The Luo family’s leaders must prioritize the family’s future over everything else, or they wouldn’t be fit to be a leader,” said Luo Bing seriously.

“You’re too strongly attached. There’s no need for you to do this, right? Even if I don’t like Luo Qingyang, it won’t affect our relationship. The collaboration we discussed earlier can still be carried out, so don’t worry about it. It might be better for you to work with Luo Qingyang for now. Once your power surpasses his, you can take his position. That might be safer,” said Long Chen.

Luo Bing shook her head. “You don’t understand. I’m stubborn. After that falling out, I won’t work with him any longer. I have to hurry up and resolve this matter.”

“It’s too bad that the God Institute’s disciples can’t join your Immortal Institute’s guilds, or together, we would be stronger,” said Mu Qingyun.

Although they were all inner academy disciples, there were still many institutes dividing the academy. Most of a person’s movements had to be within their own institute, so Mu Qingyun had no way to form one guild with Luo Bing and Luo Ning.

“It’s fine, we can just be allies. We’ll help each other,” said Luo Bing. Together, they would have additional assurance in the inner academy.

Furthermore, they would have to make their breakthroughs to the Divine Flame realm now that they had entered the inner academy as elite disciples. After they became Divine Flame experts, while it couldn’t be said that they would instantly leap to being first-rate experts, they would definitely be above average.

After chatting a bit, the previous air of displeasure over Luo Qingyang dissipated. Long Chen had already expressed that he wouldn’t join any guild, so they would have to rely on themselves.

Mu Qingyun, Luo Bing, and the others all nodded with a smile. They knew that Long Chen didn’t want them to get dependent on him. In cultivation, the only one that you could rely on was yourself.

If both of their guilds were actually in trouble though, they didn’t believe that Long Chen would just watch. Furthermore, Long Chen needed to increase his power, so they shouldn’t disturb him. Hence, whether or not he joined their guild was nothing more than a formality. They felt more free after thinking through this.

Upon returning to the outer academy, Mu Qingyun gathered the rest of the Unfettered Alliance. This time, less than four hundred members of the Unfettered Alliance were joining the inner academy. After all, over fifteen hundred of them weren’t able to participate in the competition, so they would be remaining in the outer academy.

Mu Qingyun had to arrange things for these people. The Unfettered Alliance needed to continue growing there. That way, they would have a source of fresh blood in the inner academy after the next divine competition.

For example, if Chu Kuang hadn’t died, then the Chu Alliance would have gained a large batch of powerful experts this time. Those disciples would instantly strengthen the Chu Alliance to a new level.

Originally, the Chu family’s plan was for Chu Kuang to lead these new forces into the inner academy. Once they reached the Divine Flame realm, they would sweep through their opponents, crushing the Luo Alliance. Regretfully, this plan hadn’t accounted for an anomaly like Long Chen.

The disciples that hadn’t participated in this divine competition would have a chance in the next competition. However, those that were weaker but had reached the peak of Mortal Transcendence wouldn’t be able to wait any longer. They could only make their breakthroughs to the Divine Flame realm and enter the inner academy as ordinary disciples.

Cultivation was simply that cruel. There was no other way around it. As the resources were limited and the academy wasn’t a charity, the resources were given to the strong.

Mu Qingyun had chosen a new leader for the Unfettered Alliance in the outer academy. She then encouraged them to work hard and win the next competition so that they could also become elite disciples. After that, she passed down some administrative tasks.

As for Long Chen, he wanted to see the Seven Star Elder, Heaven Master Yun Yang, and Heaven Master Dong Ming. They had all helped him, so he had to thank them.

However, he didn’t get to see the Seven Star Elder. He heard that the latter was in seclusion to refine pills and would probably only come out next month. As for Heaven Master Yun Yang, he was lecturing right now, so Long Chen went to see Heaven Master Dong Ming.

Heaven Master Dong Ming heaped piles of praise on Long Chen, encouraging him to study more in the Immortal Institute once he entered the inner academy. He felt that Long Chen could walk the path of dual God and Immortal cultivation. He also told Long Chen that if he had any trouble, he should find him.

After paying respects to Heaven Master Dong Ming, Long Chen thought about going to see the head judge of the Discipline Institute. But after thinking about it, he decided against it. This position was special, and getting too close might bring a bad name to the Discipline Institute and the head judge.

In any case, he estimated that he would be seeing the head judge quite a bit in the future. After all, with the endless fighting in the inner academy, he would probably have to go on trials quite a bit.

On the third day, Long Chen received a bit of vexing news. Chu Huairen and the other magistrate had been released.

Last time, they tried to kill him. But somehow, they had been released, and it seemed that they hadn’t even been punished. This meant that the head judge didn’t manage to knock them down.

Those two actually dared to kill him in front of everyone but had escaped without any punishment? Was this academy rotten to the core?

Or was it to say that even the dean had been bought by the Chu family? How was Long Chen supposed to play with them now?

This news left him vexed. Hence, he randomly walked around, and without realizing it, he wound up in a secluded corner. After that, he sat on a stone bench, staring into the air blankly. He wasn’t afraid of Chu Yang, but having those two old fellows targeting him was irritating.

Just at this moment, he heard the soft sound of sweeping. An ashen-robed elder was sweeping not too far from him.

“Youngster, your steps are heavy and your aura is turbulent. Did you encounter something vexing?” The elder’s head was lowered. He almost seemed to be talking to himself.
