Chapter 4666 Leave it to Me

Yue Zifeng’s voice, though gentle and composed, resonated with an intensity that cut through the angry roars and booming thunder, reaching every ear as if whispered directly into their souls.

What chilled them to the core was the sensation of a razor-sharp sword will piercing their very being, as though a blade hung perilously close to their necks. With each word he uttered, it felt as if their lives hung by a thread, subject to his will alone.

These were no ordinary individuals; they were esteemed experts among experts, with those enduring the tribulation standing as apex predators among their kind. However, Yue Zifeng’s voice alone was enough to send shivers down their spines.

The fact that such a terrifying person was willing to be Long Chen’s subordinate, calling him “boss,” raised questions about Long Chen’s strength. How strong would he have to be to command someone of Yue Zifeng’s caliber?

Other than that, Yue Zifeng’s voice was unmistakably full of regret. In other words, he did want to fight Luo Changsheng but thought that it was unlikely to ever happen, because Luo Changsheng would not survive his clash against Long Chen.

Everyone knew that sword cultivators were aloof and looked down on schemes and tricks. They wouldn’t use psychological warfare. In other words, this was truly what Yue Zifeng was thinking.

“I didn’t expect you to be able to submit like this. I’m amazed. Unfortunately, for a prideful sword cultivator to actually follow a lecherous pervert. Sigh, in the end, you’ll never reach the right path,” stated Luo Changsheng with a regretful tone.

In front of this slander, Yue Zifeng didn’t even twitch. “I won’t fall for the same trick twice. You don’t need to waste the effort. Just save your energy and start thinking about how you’ll survive later on. I’ll pray for you.”

“Die!”

Just then, a sword-wielding expert sliced through the fabric of space. This person was also an expert of the Sword Dao. Demonstrating his remarkable skill, he effortlessly bypassed the blockade of ordinary Dragonblood warriors.

His Sword Qi streaked through the air with deadly precision, aimed directly at Yue Zifeng. However, Yue Zifeng remained standing, his expression one of indifference, and he didn’t attempt to evade or counter the attack.

The Dragonblood warriors cried out in alarm as the Sword Qi pierced toward Yue Zifeng, seemingly unstoppable. Yet, to their astonishment, the Sword Qi halted abruptly, mere inches from Yue Zifeng's head. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

The attacker’s expression changed, overcome with a sudden sense of dread as Yue Zifeng fixed his gaze upon him. He felt like time had come to a standstill, as if an invisible power had separated him from this world.

“As a sword cultivator, you still care about mundane things like fame. You are not worthy of the sword in your hand,” said Yue Zifeng coldly.

Suddenly, Yue Zifeng raised his hand, and a sword appeared in it. To everyone’s surprise, this sword was the attacker’s weapon, but no one saw just how Yue Zifeng had taken this sword.

“One man, one sword, master and friend. He is not fit to be your companion. Go find someone who will properly cherish you!” Yue Zifeng’s voice echoed with authority as he waved his hand, causing the sword to slice through the void and disappear in an instant. At the same time, its old master turned to dust.

No one witnessed how Yue Zifeng executed the deed, leaving countless onlookers trembling in disbelief at the bizarre sight.

As for Long Chen, he simply smiled, his eyes filled with admiration. Yue Zifeng had never failed to impress him. After overcoming this setback, Yue Zifeng directly stepped into an even higher realm of the Sword Dao, a realm that even Long Chen couldn’t fully understand.

“Zifeng, I leave this place to you!” said Long Chen.

“Boss, don’t worry about us. I’m here.” Yue Zifeng nodded to Long Chen.

Hearing that, countless people felt a chill. It seemed that something big was about to happen.

“Luo Changsheng, do you remember what I said before?” Long Chen turned to look at Luo Changsheng. His previous calm air had vanished without a trace, replaced with a sinister, bloodthirsty killing intent.

Long Chen looked like a fiend baring his scarlet fangs, affecting every expert with his chilly killing intent. Their souls quivered in fear—a spontaneous instinct toward death.

“I told you that you shouldn’t have slandered the Dragonblood Legion. You shouldn’t have talked shit about my brothers.” Every single one of Long Chen’s words dripped with bloodthirst.

“So what?” sneered Luo Changsheng.

“Your bewitching art is now useless on Zifeng, so I no longer need to endure it. To tell the truth, you really are hateful. Inverting black and white, smearing other people’s reputation, acting like some saint when you’re clearly a treacherous bastard. People like you have no humanity, no bottom line. You’ll use any despicable trick you can, and that’s why I won’t be letting you leave here alive.” Long Chen had decided that he would definitely kill Luo Changsheng.

Yue Zifeng really did know Long Chen well. He knew that Long Chen would definitely kill Luo Changsheng, which was why he had made that declaration.

Long Chen had seen countless people, and he knew that a despicable little person like Luo Changsheng was the most dangerous kind of enemy. If he wasn’t dead, there would be endless trouble. Moreover, Long Chen couldn’t risk leaving him to Yue Zifeng.

“Hahaha, what a shameless leader. After assaulting the kindhearted Spirit race’s women, you dare to talk to me like you have any morals? Do you think anyone here will believe you?” Luo Changsheng laughed.

Long Chen coldly said, “I know that the highest realm of a bewitching art is to deceive even yourself. That’s fine. I won’t bother explaining anything. I’m just saying this so you can’t blame me for not giving you a chance to fight back when I end you.”

“Big words. Let’s see what you’re truly capable of.” Luo Changsheng had finally been provoked. After all, he was also a peak heavenly genius, and Long Chen and Yue Zifeng’s attitudes toward him were intolerable to him.

“Then open your eyes and watch. Don’t piss yourself!” Without hesitation, Long Chen conjured a massive lightning blade in his hand and brought it crashing down with formidable force.
