Chapter 4094 Uncle Tree’s Innate Divine Ability

The Heaven Venerate of the Soaring Dragon Company had a bad feeling. Even the Jiang clan’s people had said that Long Chen wasn’t someone that they should provoke.

However, he misinterpreted Feng Fei’s intention. He thought that it was Long Chen’s background that was very powerful, an existence that the Soaring Dragon Company couldn’t provoke.

Even so, with Long Chen having plundered three of their branches here, the Soaring Dragon Company naturally couldn’t just swallow it. No matter how tough Long Chen’s background was, the Soaring Dragon Company demanded an explanation.

That was why he gave the order to capture Long Chen and the others, but he told them that Long Chen had to be caught alive. As for what to do with them in the future, they would leave it to the higher-ups. Anything was fine as long as they were caught alive. So, everyone understood what he meant and attacked at once, splitting up to capture everyone from the Dragonblood Legion.

They split up to catch Uncle Tree off-guard, as he couldn’t possibly look left and right at the same time. If they could capture a portion of them, the others wouldn’t stubbornly resist.

“It really is a case of kind words being unable to convince ghosts about to die. Uncle Tree, there’s no need to hold back,” said Long Chen when he saw that these people had ultimately chosen to attack.

BOOM!

Just as those people made their move, Uncle Tree manifested his true body. The next moment, endless tree branches rained down upon this entire world like sharp blades, leaving no openings at all.

The Earth Venerates in the lead were instantly pierced through and exploded, killed in body and spirit. As for the Heaven Venerates, they roared and resisted crazily.

Countless branches descended like rain, assuming forms of swords and spears, rending the earth asunder. The area of devastation expanded ceaselessly, enshrouding heaven and earth within a sphere of annihilation.

Uncle Tree didn’t hold back. He directly mobilized his core energy, unleashing the divine ability of the Undying Dragon Tree race.

Even Heaven Venerates were unable to block his attacks. At first, they managed to brandish their weapons and cut through the branches, but the onslaught was endless, steadily diminishing their defensive area. With no escape route left, their bodies were eventually pierced through.

“Stop!”

A Heaven Venerate finally became afraid and roared. Regretfully, it wasn’t Long Chen who said it, so Uncle Tree ignored it. His true body spread even more, covering the sky and raining down branches endlessly.

“Ah!”

In just two breaths’ time, someone was unable to hold on. He was struck in the vitals and instantly killed.

“No!”

With that person’s death, the others fully panicked, and in their panic, it became even harder for them to defend.

Uncle Tree was merciless. The remaining Heaven Venerates were all slain one by one.

From start to finish, it only took a few breaths time. In the end, the nine Heaven Venerates were slain. It was absolutely astonishing.

Countless branches, resembling colossal spider legs, had previously impaled the ground. These branches were now uprooted, leaving behind a multitude of holes. Within many of these holes, traces of blood were evident – the blood of the fallen Heaven Venerates.Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

“Uncle Tree is incredible!” Guo Ran and the others were also stunned. With one move, he unleashed an endless torrent of attacks, and anyone within Uncle Tree’s attack range was caught inside. Within that domain, there was nowhere to dodge.

In front of such a torrent of attacks, you could only take them head-on. Perhaps if there was someone on the same level as him, it would be more difficult, but even then, Uncle Tree could just rely on the Undying race’s terrifying life energy to exhaust his opponent.

If the opponent was weaker than Uncle Tree, then they would definitely be slain in a moment. Most frightening of all, the outcome was the same whether he was targeting one person or multiple people.

The sheer intensity and rapid fire of this divine ability were absolutely astonishing. Guo Ran and Xia Chen both knew that if they encountered such an attack, they would be utterly defenseless.

No matter what formation they used, there was no way it would be effective. These attacks would slowly grind away at their defense until it was gone.

When Uncle Tree returned to human form, Long Chen hastily asked, “Uncle Tree, are you alright?”

Long Chen noticed that there was a touch of unhealthy redness on Uncle Tree’s face now. Furthermore, the fluctuations of his aura were a bit off.

“Perhaps I stayed in the fiend eye for too long, leading to a significant drain on my core energy. Now that I used my divine ability that relies on my core energy, it ended up being too much. Master, don’t worry. I’ll be fine once I rest a bit,” said Uncle Tree. He was moved that Long Chen would be so concerned about him. Long Chen had never actually viewed him as a servant and was always very respectful.

Long Chen nodded. “Then you should rest now.”

Xia Chen immediately summoned the flying boat again, and they flew off. This time, Xia Chen’s flying boat was several times faster than the last one, and it left behind no aura at all. It would be much harder for anyone to track them.

Previously, Long Chen had planned to use the Soaring Dragon Company’s Heaven Venerates as a grindstone for the Dragonblood Legion to accumulate more combat experience. He wanted the Dragonblood Legion to be able to fight under the pressure of Heaven Venerates.

After all, they would only be able to unleash their full power when they could face the pressure of Heaven Venerates fearlessly. Following numerous clashes, the once-potent aura of the Violet Flame Heaven in their bodies had gradually waned, intermingling with the Heavenly Daos of the Nirvana Overflow Heaven. Just from their auras, without examining closely, others would be unable to tell that they were foreigners.

The only thing that Long Chen hadn’t expected was that they would draw over this many Heaven Venerates in one go.

Although Uncle Tree had slain them all, Long Chen also saw his limits. It wasn't a matter of Uncle Tree lacking strength; rather, his core was still too damaged from the fiend eye.

If Uncle Tree wanted to fully recover, he probably had to return to the Undying World. He would need the aura of the Undying World to recover his core energy.

“Boss, Feng Fei seems to be doing very well. She even has a Heaven Venerate steed, and her power is even more shocking. How did she get so powerful?” asked Guo Ran.

Long Chen nodded along. “I also found it strange. However, she said that she had a seed planted in her at birth. Now that I think back, the Jiang clan must have planted many such seeds. But probably not every seed manages to bear fruit. The current Feng Fei has managed to merge three flowers in the Immortal King realm and has reached the initial realm of controlling Heaven Dao energy. Such a genius can only be called a Supreme genius.”

In truth, the instant Long Chen saw Feng Fei, he was badly frightened. It was his first time encountering someone in the immortal world who gave him such enormous pressure in the same realm.

Long Aotian had already been strong enough, but in the end, his Spirit Blood, Spirit Root, and Spirit Bone were not his own.

On the Martial Heaven Continent, despite Feng Fei’s exceptional talents, her actual power was somewhat weaker than Long Aotian, Ye Liangchen, Zhao Ritian, and others. But unexpectedly, she had gone through a complete metamorphosis after coming to the immortal world.

Although Long Chen didn’t know the details, he knew that there had to be some karma behind this. He even felt that there might be some astonishing secret behind this.

“Boss, where are we going now?” asked Xia Chen.

BOOM!

Suddenly, they heard heaven-shaking explosions in the distance, and the aura of Heaven Venerates struck them.

“There’s Heaven Venerates fighting! Let’s take a look.”
