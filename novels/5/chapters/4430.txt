Chapter 4419 Biluo

This maiden was in white robes, and her hair was also white. It wasn't the white of old age; rather, it resembled the purity of a gemstone.

Her eyes were closed as if she was in a slumber. Her breathing was disorderly, and her spiritual fluctuations were also unstable.

Ye Ling rushed over and touched this maiden’s forehead. In an instant, she woke up, looking around in panic. She then brought her hands together to form hand seals.DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

“Ye Xue!” called out Ye Ling hastily.

This shout caused Ye Xue to blink. Her eyes gradually shifted from dim to bright.

“Master!” The maiden cried out in delight and was about to rush into Ye Ling’s embrace. However, she then grew bewildered and stopped.

“The illusion has been dispelled. It’s over,” said Long Chen.

“Ye Xue, don’t worry. Master is here.” Ye Ling walked forward and comforted the bewildered Ye Xue.

“Master, I thought I would never see you again.” Ye Xue suddenly burst into tears. “Everywhere I went, there were only bad people. They continuously hunted me.”

“It’s alright. You’re safe now.” Ye Ling hugged Ye Xue and patted her back.

Ye Xue cried like an aggrieved child, her tears constantly falling to the ground. Sobbing, she suddenly pointed at the Long clan’s people. “They’re all bad people! They attacked me and even said that master was in their hands! They even made a fake master! I was bewildered, which is how I fell for their illusion. Master, I was so afraid. In the illusion world, you were already dead…”

Ye Ling continuously comforted Ye Xue, who held on tightly and cried. When those tears fell on the earth, they actually unleashed a dense medicinal fragrance.

Seeing this scene, Long Chen suddenly came to a realization and sneered at the patriarch. “Your Long clan really knows how to scheme. You were just watching at first. You didn’t care about the Earth Spirit race, but then you saw Ye Xue and wanted to turn her into a medicinal pill. How vicious. But I have to say, that doesn’t match your Long clan’s style.

“Don’t forget that your surname is Long. You are also from the Long clan!” barked the patriarch.

As Long Chen had mentioned, Ye Xue was a precious spirit flower—an ancient great desolate species known as the Thousand Leaf Sacred Light Snow Lotus.

Possessing a powerful sacred energy, she held the inconceivable ability to concentrate the power of the Heavenly Daos. Her tears contained medicinal fragrance that affected the Heavenly Daos, and this aspect of hers gave Long Chen a familiar feeling, reminiscent of the sensation he experienced when encountering Netherdragon Tianye.

Long Chen instantly realized that Ye Xue was also qualified to become a Heavenly Doyen. Perhaps she already was one.

However, being from a non-combatant race, Ye Xue lacked formidable killing prowess. This vulnerability caught the attention of the Long clan and led to her unfortunate capture.

Ye Ling had led the Earth Spirit race out of the Esoteric Spirit World to flee from their pursuers. However, their enemies then sent out word that they would pay handsomely for the heads of the Earth Spirit race’s experts, prompting the Long clan to dispatch their people to assess the situation.

The Long clan was quite lucky. Upon arriving to assess the situation, they witnessed Ye Xue escaping from an encirclement. Seizing the opportunity, they immediately targeted her and even went to the extent of eliminating all the other pursuers to secure their prize. Their intention was to capture Ye Xue without causing her harm, as any injury might compromise the medicinal effect they sought from her. Hence, they surrounded her and persistently cornered her.

Finally, seeing how naive she seemed, they felt that the best option was to use an illusion to subdue her.

Their plan succeeded, and they jubilantly brought her back to the Long clan to consider the optimal way to refine her. However, Long Chen's sudden appearance threw their plans into disarray.

The Long clan directly found themselves in a dilemma—should they relinquish Ye Xue, whom they had captured with so much effort, or risk antagonizing Long Chen? The situation intensified when Long Chen effortlessly dispatched one of their Eternal experts with a single punch, instilling terror in the Long clan.

Still, they weren’t willing to give up. Some of them proposed extracting a portion of her essence blood or cutting off one of the limbs. They could just claim that Ye Xue was already in this state when they encountered her. However, Long Chen adamantly insisted that he would kill their Eternal experts if she suffered even the slightest harm. He refused to be reasonable.

Unwilling to risk the consequences, the Long clan had no choice but to hand Ye Xue over in her complete state. Filled with resentment, they could only cast hateful glares at Long Chen.

Long Chen darkly remarked, “The moment you extracted my father’s essence blood, me and my father were no longer people of the Long clan. What a shame that Ye Xue is completely fine. The heavens really are blind to let you off again.”

Currently, there wasn’t a single good person in the Long clan. The Long clan could consider themselves lucky this time. Otherwise, Long Chen would have slaughtered them.

“You can go. The Long clan doesn’t welcome you,” said the patriarch coldly.

“You’re in such a rush to get rid of me. Are you afraid that I’ll see through more of your secrets?” Long Chen's gaze swept across the land, suddenly fixing on a hole amidst some ruins.

Beneath the ground lay a palace, visible through the hole. Long Chen could sense a formidable concealed aura emanating from within. As he focused on that spot, the expressions of the patriarch and the other Eternal experts tightened.

Long Chen sneered, “I know that the Eternal clans have their own trump cards. You not only raise these few Eternal experts right here but also more disciples like Long Aotian. Furthermore, I know that you are unwilling to let things rest between us. You will definitely come for revenge. I am the same. This enmity will be avenged sooner or later. I’ll wait for you.”

After saying that, Long Chen nodded to Ye Ling, and the three of them left the Long clan.

Once they were gone, an Eternal expert cursed, “What a tyrannical brat! This Long Chen really deserves the worst death possible! We’ve spent so many days hunting and killing so many people just to obtain that woman!”

“He really deserves death. With that woman, plus our ancestor’s Heavenly Divinity Sacred Baptism, we could have given rise to three Doyens. Now, we’re back to the start. The Heavenly Divinity Sacred Baptism can only produce a single Doyen like this,” said another Eternal expert, gnashing his teeth so hard that they were about to shatter.

“It’s a shame about Aotian. We were too foolish back then. We should have hidden him. If Aotian could have lived to today, would Long Chen dare to be so arrogant?” sighed another elder.

“It’s fine. Even without Aotian, we still have Biluo. As long as she becomes a Heavenly Doyen, her Heavenly Divinity bloodline will be activated. We were hoping to have Aotian and Biluo marry to produce a peak genius possessing both Supreme Blood and Heavenly Divinity blood, but it was all ruined by Long Chen. However, our Heavenly Divinity bloodline is also unmatched. We’ll just patiently wait for Biluo to come out of seclusion and cut off Long Chen’s head!”

The patriarch gazed at the divine altar at the bottom of the underground palace, where a woman sat on its heart. Sacred light bathed her, but her face remained in shadow, making her appear mysterious and strange.
