Chapter 1946: 1946

BOOM!

Evilmoon smashed right into the bone club . The sound of their collision was bizarre as countless divine runes clashed against each other . ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

Powerful astral winds erupted, and an irresistible force blew back the others .

“Boss!”

The world shuddered as Long Chen pressed down as hard as he could with Evilmoon . However, he felt the Golden Eye Berserk Ape’s power grow stronger and stronger . He couldn’t stop it .

“Long Chen, don’t anger it! It’s going to go berserk!” shouted Meng Qi . The runes in the ape’s eyes were revolving faster and faster . That was a sign it was going to enter its berserk state .

“Wilde, attack it from behind! Whether or not we can beat it depends on you!” shouted Long Chen .

Suddenly, Long Chen’s aura changed . A powerful dragon might soared out of him . He was actually activating his Spirit Blood, and all the Dragonblood warriors shook . Their own blood was resonating .

The golden runes in the ape’s eyes instantly became sluggish . For the first time, it appeared a bit afraid .

BOOM!

The ape was suddenly blown back by Long Chen’s saber .

It stumbled back three steps, each step causing the ground to shake and crumble . However, just as it was about to stabilize itself, a giant figure appeared behind it .

Wilde had actually transformed into a silver giant . He was the same size as the golden ape, and he suddenly bit down on its neck .

The Golden Eye Berserk Ape roared . It tried to shake off Wilde, but Wilde refused to let go . He began to rip out chunks of its flesh with his teeth .

Wilde managed to tear all the way down to the bones, but then even those bones crunched and broke . Wilde’s teeth were shockingly sharp .

The Golden Eye Berserk Ape tried to enter its berserk state, but it failed over and over again due to Long Chen’s dragon might .

The bones in its neck eventually shattered, and it lost balance . At that moment, Long Chen stabbed it through its head, killing it . It died without being able to unleash its true power .

Once its corpse fell to the ground, Wild returned to his normal size . He ran over to Long Chen, his eyes red . “Brother Long, I missed you! I was looking for you everywhere, but I never found you . ”

Large tears squeezed out of Wilde’s eyes . He had gotten lost not long after entering this world, but in his panic upon finding he was lost, he found that he had no idea how to return .

He had been looking for the way back all this time . It could be said that it had been a kind of torment for him, so he was emotional enough to cry upon seeing Long Chen .

“Good brother, it’s fine . Aren’t I right here?” comforted Long Chen .

Wilde had grown even stronger, but his heart was still as pure as ever . He was still that brother who would take a whip for someone just because of a bun .

Long Chen felt some shame . He had thought that Wilde would know that all he had to do was eat and sleep . He hadn’t thought that Wilde was so dependent on him .

After comforting him, Long Chen asked what had happened during his time in this world .

By now, all the Dragonblood warriors had already arrived . However, the newcomers were too late . The battle had already ended .

They came over to greet Wilde . Last time, when Wilde woke up, Long Chen had brought him to the Skyscraping World before they had gotten time to catch up .

With everyone gathered, Wilde began to tell a story . However, his child-like way of thinking meant it was difficult to piece together the whole story . Even his memories weren’t very connected .

However, they came to a general understanding that Wilde had been hunting down powerful Magical Beasts upon entering this world, but only when he was full did he realize he didn’t know the way back .

Wilde had been working hard to return, but he had actually been getting further and further away . When he was hungry, he would kill some Magical Beasts . Once he was full, he would continue searching .

After several months, it was unknown just how many Magical Beasts he had killed . Wilde’s horns had turned silver now, with silver runes flowing on top of them . A fiendish aura came from them that frightened the others despite knowing that Wilde was on their side .

Perhaps it was because he had consumed too many Magical Beasts, but Wilde’s body now had a desolate aura around it . His giant body, which was close to six meters tall, was bulging with energy . It was like he could smash a person apart with a punch . They instinctively felt on guard against him .

The sight of Wilde tearing into the Golden Eye Berserk Ape’s flesh repeatedly was many times more frightening than the sight of a Magical Beast eating . After all, Wilde was in human form .

Wilde didn’t even realize how much stronger he had gotten . All his focus had been on returning home .

Regretfully, he had ended up charging even deeper into this foreign world . The original devil race was unable to go that deep .

This time, Wilde had been hunted down by the Golden Eye Berserk Ape and coincidentally ran into the area that the Dragonblood Legion had been searching .

“Wilde, how did you provoke this Golden Eye Berserk Ape?” asked Meng Qi .

“It seems I ate a few apes that looked like it? I got beaten pretty badly at the time, and it wasn’t easy to run away . But after eating some more, I snuck my way back . I wanted to take its club . It’s definitely a treasure, and it’s really painful being hit by it! I needed such a weapon . But I didn’t succeed in sneaking away with it, so we started fighting . With its club, I couldn’t beat it, so after I started feeling hungry again, I had to run away . But the second time, it chased me down . Then I ran into you guys!” Wilde rubbed the bone club with a happy smile .

“How heavy!” Long Chen tried to pick up the club, and he almost failed . The current Long Chen had already undergone the transformation of the azure dragon essence blood, but the club was still almost too heavy for him to pick up .

Seeing Long Chen’s expression change, Gu Yang also walked over . He tried to hold it, and as a result, as soon as Long Chen lightened his hold, Gu Yang’s body sank into the ground .

Long Chen hastily picked the club back up . Even Gu Yang was unable to carry such a heavy object without activating the Dragon Blood Battle Armor .

As for Wilde, he wielded it easily . Clearly, his power had reached an inconceivable level during this time .

“This bone club is a remnant of an ascender . If this club was left behind by a Magical Beast from this world, then we’re really in danger,” said Yue Xiaoqian after closely examining the bone club . Its origins had to be terrifying . It was even able to easily smash apart half-step divine items .

Long Chen understood . Yue Xiaoqian was worried that this bone club might have been left behind by some unknown race .

If that race still existed, then the original devil race would be in trouble now that they were exploring their world . It might result in the destruction of their race just like Yue Xihan feared .

“Let’s go back . We’ll leave a mark for this place and make it off-limits in the future . Also, make a mark for the area that’s already been explored . In the future, our original devil race can just move about in this small region,” said Long Chen . “In any case, the area that the Dragonblood warriors have explored during this time should be large enough for you to spend decades looking through carefully . ”

Yue Xiaoqian nodded . After that, Wilde took the corpse of the Golden Eye Berserk Ape . He said that its flesh was very beneficial to him . He could eat it for a long time, and this was the biggest ration he had ever gained in all of history .

On the way back, Long Chen learned that everyone had made many gains . They had killed an uncountable number of twelfth rank Magical Beasts . In fact, each person managed to obtain several eggs or some young of Magical Beasts .

“Boss, we can give everyone a twelfth rank Magical Beast as a steed!” Gu Yang was extremely excited . If the Dragonblood Legion rode into battle on over ten thousand twelfth rank Magical Beasts, just how imposing would that be? There was no such precedent in the Martial Heaven Continent!

“What about these?” Long Chen handed over a life ring .

Gu Yang opened it and took out the five furry fellows inside . “Wow, what cute little fellows . ”

“These are Explosive Flame Golden Lions!” exclaimed Meng Qi instantly .

“Are these lions powerful?” asked Gu Yang .

“Of course they’re powerful! These Explosive Flame Golden Lions possess extremely pure bloodlines based on the color of their fur . If they are given the right medicines and nutrients to stimulate their potential, they’ll definitely enter the mid twelfth rank after maturing . Even the late twelfth rank is possible!”

“The late twelfth rank? So they would be as powerful as that Golden Eye Berserk ape?!”

“No, that’s impossible . The Golden Eye Berserk Ape is actually more terrifying than you imagine . It was simply cowed by Long Chen’s dragon might, so it was unable to enter its berserk state . If it was in its berserk state, then even a true third step Netherpassage expert would have to avoid it . As for us, we’d have to run for our lives . There’s no way that the Explosive Flame Golden Lions can compare to it, but they’re still very powerful . They also possess an innate flame energy which will be extremely helpful in the future if they’re properly raised . ” Upon saying that, Meng Qi smiled . “Most importantly, once they’ve matured, they’ll be powerful and look impressive . You’ll definitely fall in love with them . ”

Gu Yang and the others learned that these five Explosive Flame Golden Lions were actually being left to the four captains and Guo Ran, so they were delighted .

They had found Wilde, explored a large region, and obtained plentiful gains . They excitedly returned back to the base .
