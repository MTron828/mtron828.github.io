Chapter 2410 Once More Entering the Netherworld

Mo Nian was within one of the secret rooms beneath the Mo family’s ancestral land. Even with Mo Yi leading the way, they had to go through thirteen blockades and be investigated time and time again before being let through.

Mo Nian’s safety was paramount to the Mo family. He was not just Mo Yi’s grandson now but the hope of the entire Mo family. There could not be any mistakes.

There were over thirty Netherpassage experts guarding the secret room. What surprised Long Chen was that one of them was at the fourth step.

“Greetings, family head.”

Mo Li hastily bowed upon seeing that man. Long Chen had never known that the Mo family possessed an expert on this level. No wonder Mo Nian had been able to run rampant in the outside world.

The old man nodded at Long Chen kindly. “Your reputation precedes you, Long Chen. I’m honored to see you in person.”

“Senior overpraises me. As Mo Nian’s brother, I should have come to see you a long time ago. I’m ashamed of being held back by so many trifles,” said Long Chen.

“What kind of joke is that? Don’t be so serious. Come in. Mo Nian is inside.” The head of the Mo family personally opened the door, bringing in Long Chen and Mo Yi. The final barrier to Mo Nian was actually the head of the family.

Mo Nian’s body was seated atop a stone disc. His fiancee, Liu Zongying, was beside him. She looked like she had been weeping.

“Long Chen!” Upon seeing Long Chen, Liu Zongying’s reddened eyes brightened.

Long Chen nodded toward her and walked over to Mo Nian. His face was dark without the slightest trace of life. He was like a corpse.

However, this was the natural husk left behind when attacking the Netherpassage realm. The soul was already in the Netherworld. It could be said that in some ways, Mo Nian was already dead.

“Long Chen, you have to help Mo Nian. He…” Liu Zongying bit her lip and began to cry. Although she was normally fierce toward Mo Nian, her feelings for him were true. Even after all this time, Mo Nian had yet to awaken. She felt like her sky had fallen, and she had been unable to calm down enough to cultivate during this time. After reaching the Netherpassage realm, she stayed beside him, refusing to leave.

“I’ll think of a way.” Long Chen nodded and pressed a finger against Mo Nian’s forehead. This action made the others jump.

The family head hastily said, “Long Chen, you can’t! If you send your soul inside his body, you will be drawn into the Netherworld. The laws there will not permit you to enter, and you will be destroyed. Such a thing is in defiance of the Heavenly Daos.”

Although the Martial Heaven Continent’s side knew very little about the Netherworld, some of its laws were well known. A state like Mo Nian’s had occurred in the past of the cultivation world. When others tried to help them, they all died without exception. No one could help someone cheat their way through the Netherworld.

Liu Zongying regretfully said, “Long Chen, I’m sorry for saying that. If something happens to you, Mo Nian won’t forgive me when he wakes up.” Her intention had never been for Long Chen to do such a thing.

“Don’t worry about me. I’m not suicidal. I’m just seeing if I can link up with Mo Nian and see what state he’s in,” said Long Chen. He pressed the rest of his hand onto Mo Nian’s forehead.

Mo Yi’s heart was pounding hard. This was far too dangerous. If something happened to Long Chen, they would have no way to explain themselves to Mo Nian. They all became apprehensive, in a mix of hope and uneasiness.

Long Chen’s Spiritual Strength slowly entered Mo Nian’s mind-sea. It was completely empty.

As Long Chen carefully entered Mo Nian’s spiritual space, even he was a bit nervous. This truly was dangerous. If his soul was drawn into the Netherworld, then considering that he no longer met the requirements for attacking the Netherpassage realm, he would be exterminated by the laws of the Netherworld.

He kept absolute control over his spiritual fluctuations, not disturbing the core of Mo Nian’s mind-sea. That core was a dark yellow ball of light, the essence of his soul. That place was also called the Niwan. It could be considered a bit similar to a Magical Beast’s crystal core. If his Spiritual Strength fluctuated and activated the Niwan, then he would be instantly drawn into the Netherworld.

What he wanted to do was fully enter Mo Nian’s body without disturbing his Niwan. That was essentially impossible considering the harsh requirements over someone’s Spiritual Strength.

However, this was the best option that Long Chen had thought of before coming here. He had great confidence in his Spiritual Strength. But to say that he wasn’t nervous would be a lie.

To be safe, he kept a portion of his Spiritual Strength within his own body. Just in case, perhaps he would be able to rip his soul back out if something happened.

“Damn, when did this fellow’s Spiritual Strength become so powerful? I’ve already passed forty percent. Past fifty percent and I won’t be able to pull back.” Long Chen’s heart tightened. He had originally thought that Mo Nian’s Spiritual Strength wasn’t so strong, and that he could take control with under half of his Spiritual Strength. But with how powerful Mo Nian’s Spiritual Strength actually was, it seemed that he wouldn’t be able to follow through with that plan.

Long Chen cursed. When did this fellow become so low key? If Long Chen didn’t fill his spiritual sea, he wouldn’t be able to achieve his goal.

Clenching his teeth, Long Chen continued sending in his Spiritual Strength, his nerves growing more and more tense. He had to avoid disturbing Mo Nian’s Niwan.

“Finally.”

When around sixty percent of his Spiritual Strength had entered, Mo Nian’s body shook ever so slightly. Long Chen instantly stopped.

Long Chen sighed. He had managed to avoid touching Mo Nian’s Niwan. He slowly focused on Mo Nian’s Dantian, in particular the giant star.

That was Mo Nian’s astral space. He looked around it and didn’t see the Five Element Sun Hunting Bow, making him have a trace of hope. So Mo Nian had managed to bring the Five Element Sun Hunting Bow into the Netherworld with him.

It seemed that Long Chen wasn’t the only one who possessed the ability to bring objects into the Netherworld. “Evilmoon, can I use you as a bridge to communicate with Mo Nian?”

“What are you using me for? The laws of the Netherworld aren’t to my taste. Using Ling-er would be better. She is a demonic furnace and the materials that went into creating her came from the Netherworld,” said Evilmoon.

Long Chen immediately turned to Ling-er, who agreed. Using the Demon Moon Furnace, he entered Mo Nian’s astral space.

When the Demon Moon Furnace entered Mo Nian’s astral space, it began to thrum according to a specific rhythm. However, even after a long time, there was no further reaction.

Long Chen didn’t give up, and the Demon Moon Furnace continued to thrum. Eventually, it said, “Big brother Long Chen, there is a fluctuation calling me. Should I go?”

Long Chen was delighted. “Not yet. Continue connecting with it. I will transmit my spiritual fluctuations over as well.”

Mo Nian finally responded. This was Mo Nian’s astral space, and it had a definite connection to Mo Nian’s soul. Using the Demon Moon Furnace’s fluctuations, he tried to draw Mo Nian’s attention, and had finally succeeded. This meant that Mo Nian was definitely alive.

“Ling-er, I will entrust my soul to you. When Mo Nian calls you over, bring me with you,” said Long Chen.

“Alright.”

“Evilmoon, you protect the bit of my soul that connects with me here. When I want to return, if I don’t have the ability to, help pull me back,” said Long Chen.

“Don’t worry about it,” said Evilmoon.

“Thanks!” Long Chen sent his Spiritual Strength pouring into the Demon Moon Furnace. In that instant, his aura vanished.

“Long Chen!” Mo Yi, the family head, and Liu Zongying all let out startled cries. They instantly turned as pale as paper.

“Long Chen had gone to the Netherworld to bring Mo Nian back. There’s no need for you to worry about him.” Evilmoon’s icy voice rang out, shocking them.

…

Within the Demon Moon Furnace, Long Chen followed Mo Nian’s spiritual fluctuations, and he appeared in a dark world.

“Long Chen, is that you?” From within that darkness, Mo Nian’s voice rang out.

“Who else would it be, a ghost? Get out here!” snorted Long Chen. Not sensing any danger, he jumped out of the Demon Moon Furnace.

Upon seeing Mo Nian, he jumped in shock. “Who did this to you?!”
