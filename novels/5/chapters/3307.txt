Chapter 3296 The Unmatched Devil Eye Water Lily

They were already very close to Zhaoming Ancient City. But the Devil Eye Water Lily had also descended upon them. With its next blow, it could kill them all.

It was precisely due to this that Long Chen charged at the Devil Eye Water Lily. Only by taking the initiative against it could he win a chance for the others to get away.

A giant saber-image soared into the heavens and slashed down.

“Split the Heavens!”

BOOM!

The saber-image smashed into the nine-colored lily and exploded, unable to shake the lily at all.

“Ah, without Heavenly Dao energy, an ordinary attack is unable to threaten it at all.” Long Chen sighed powerlessly inside. He didn’t dare to merge the power of the Heavenly Daos into his attack again, as he only had half of his spiritual yuan remaining. If he couldn’t force it back in one move, then the backlash would cause him to temporarily lose his combat power. He might even lose consciousness. So, he couldn’t gamble on that. He was aware of just how bad his luck was.

The lily merely quivered ever so slightly before charging at Long Chen. However, its speed was impacted by the blow, which was precisely the effect that Long Chen wanted.

After that, flames appeared in Long Chen’s left hand, and lightning appeared in his right hand. In his left hand was a flame lotus, while in his right hand was a lightning sphere. The flames and lightning mixed together and instantly grew.

Long Chen then sent the mix of lightning and flame energy smashing into the lily.

As a result, a huge explosion erupted. The lightning and flame runes were exploding all over, filling the sky with chaos and shattering the ten thousand Daos. Seeing this, countless birds and beasts fled for their lives. It was as if the apocalypse had come.

Within this explosion of flames and lightning, Long Chen retreated and coughed up three large mouthfuls of blood. This one attack contained a mix of all of Lei Linger and Huo Linger’s power.

Neither of them had held back at all, and so there had been no way for them to protect Long Chen. Thus, even he himself was injured by this explosion.

As for the lily, it was enduring over ten times the impact that he did. The glorious and glistening lily was now turned black by the lightning and flames. Two of its petals were dropping. It was clearly injured.

Suddenly, a huge eye opened inside this charred lily. All the colors of the lily then flowed into this eye, turning it into a nine-colored devil eye. In that instant, Long Chen’s expression completely changed. He hadn’t thought that this attack of his would only manage to injure some petals, but not its core.

When its devil eye opened, a nine-colored sword condensed of light shot toward Long Chen.

“Not good!”

Long Chen’s heart sank. In that instant, he found himself unable to move. It was the same move that he had faced inside of the lily.

However, this time, it was too far for his black soil to reach the lily. Even if he poured out all the black soil that he could, it wouldn’t affect anything.

Long Chen hadn’t expected this. Its previous divine abilities were physical attacks, but now it was a kind of spatial pupil art. It was countless times stronger than Bai Xiaole’s techniques.

Despite already giving a high estimate of the Devil Eye Water Lily’s power, he had still underestimated it. He was now caught in its grasp once more and could only watch as that nine-colored divine light shot toward him. He was unable to dodge.

His head was blank. He had failed. The power difference between the two of them was too great. Also, the price for failure was death. He was unwilling, but all his struggle was useless. He was unable to break free from this spatial compression. It was his first time feeling so powerless.

Just as the sword of light was about to pierce his body, a golden ray stabbed into the devil eye, instantly piercing through it.

After that, a strange but furious roar shook heaven and earth. The sword attacking Long Chen vanished and the heaven-encompassing lily closed in on itself. Its body vanished.

Bai Shishi then appeared, her face pale as paper. She had unleashed her full power to activate her golden sword’s power, dealing a heavy injury to the Devil Eye Water Lily. That meant she had saved Long Chen’s life.

Long Chen was delighted. But seeing that she had overdrafted her power, he caught her and carried her toward Zhaoming Ancient City as fast as possible.

“Didn’t I tell you to run? Why didn’t you listen?” Looking at the incredibly pale Bai Shishi, Long Chen sighed.

Despite how deathly pale she was, she had a very pleased expression. “If I had left, wouldn’t you have been killed? Furthermore, when have I ever listened to you? I, Bai Shishi, only listen to myself.”

Bai Xiaole had activated his spatial art to bring them all away. But Bai Shishi had jumped out of his range and hadn’t gone with them. As she worried about Long Chen, she had been gathering her power for an all-out attack the entire time.

Her prudence ultimately saved Long Chen’s life. Her response made Long Chen laugh, but it also moved him. This stubborn girl actually had such a cute side.

Being held by Long Chen and seeing the smile that was a bit bitter on his face, Bai Shishi was even more pleased.

“Your life was saved by me, so you’ll need to treat me as your savior. You can’t treat me so fiercely in the future, or I’ll bring up this matter again.”

Long Chen laughed. He knew that someone as proud as Bai Shishi wouldn’t do such a thing. It was just a joke.

That smile left Bai Shishi a bit dazed. This was a smile from Long Chen’s inner heart, and it was very warm. It was like the sun nourishing all life, making her feel warm and safe.

After staring for a bit, Bai Shishi’s face reddened. She slowly leaned her head against Long Chen’s chest. Smelling his particular odor, she actually fell asleep with a sweet smile on her face.

Within Zhaoming Ancient City, countless people were shaking with terror. When they saw that immense Devil Eye Water Lily, when its devil qi reached them, they were so terrified that they couldn’t even move.

Moreover, when they saw Long Chen fighting that terrifying lifeform, they were dumbfounded. Bai Xiaole and the others then appeared in the city, and then Long Chen came back while holding Bai Shishi. As for that terrifying lifeform, it had left. 

Long Chen and the others sat on the ground, panting. They felt paralyzed. As for Jiang Yuhe and the others, they were simply lying on the ground without a care, soaking in sweat. It was still pouring out of them until they were lying in small pools.

Having returned with their lives, they swore to never go out adventuring again. It was their first time feeling just how beautiful it was to be living.

Long Chen then gave Bai Shishi a medicinal pill to heal and found a place for her to have a good rest.

The Devil Eye Water Lily didn’t come back after leaving, and even the black dragons didn’t pursue them. Long Chen finally sighed with relief. It seemed that Zhaoming Ancient City truly possessed something that those existences were afraid of. They didn’t dare to approach it.

The next day, Bai Shishi woke up and Long Chen gathered everyone.
