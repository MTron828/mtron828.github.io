Chapter 2547 Ye Lingshan’s Heart-Devil

Ye Lingshan lifted Long Chen up, but he didn’t resist. He simply looked at Ye Lingshan with a smile that was not a smile.

“My wives are all watching from a distance. Are you not afraid of their vengeance?”

Ye Lingshan glared at Long Chen. After a while, her eyes reddened slightly and she let go, once more sitting down. She then lowered her head and lightly said, “Thank you.”

“Thank me for what?” asked Long Chen.

“Thank you for caring,” said Ye Lingshan quietly. “I know you came to talk to me and accompany me. I know many people care about me…”

“But you are unable to walk out of that shadow?” Long Chen sat down beside her. He then plucked a blade of grass and chewed on it. Looking at the clouds beneath the tree, he had an easy smile.

“Yes.” Ye Lingshan nodded.

Long Chen said, “I thought that Dongfang Yuyang’s death would make you feel a bit better. But now that you’ve heard that Dongfang Yuyang is still alive, your heart-devil is growing stronger?”

Tears silently fell down Ye Lingshan’s cheeks and dripped onto the grass, and her hands were tightly clenching her clothes. After that, she lowered her head, not letting Long Chen see her crying. That stubbornness was heart-wrenching.

Long Chen shook his head. “It seems that you still haven’t suffered enough setbacks in life. Even though your youth wasn’t blessed, it wasn’t enough. I should thank the people who constantly cast me under their shadow back in my youth. They made my heart unbreakable. Back then, I was just an ordinary little person. But even as failure, helplessness, anger, and despair nibbled at my heart like rats, they didn’t leave behind any heart-devils. That’s because I was sure that a chance would come sooner or later. I worked harder than anyone every single day just waiting for those chances. I then firmly grasped those chances to save my fate. That’s why old people say that it’s best to make mistakes early on because while you’re still young, when you fall, you cry. But after crying, you instinctively get back up. However, those that have never fallen don’t know how to get back up after stumbling. It’s as if the heavens are collapsing for them. If they could climb up, pat the dust off their butt, and look up at the sky, they would see that the sky's still blue, that the white clouds are still relaxed. Then forcing a foolish smile, they would realize that life is still very beautiful.”

Ye Lingshan’s tears turned into laughter. She was embarrassed and vexed by Long Chen’s teasing, so she reached out to pinch him, only to find that his skin was tough as dragon leather and impossible to pinch.

“How thick. No wonder you can say such shameless things,” said Ye Lingshan irritably.

“Of course. If it wasn’t for this thick skin, how could I have pursued so many wives that are as beautiful as heavenly feathers?” said Long Chen.

“Shameless.”

Ye Lingshan cursed him, only to find that the heaviness on her heart had lifted quite a bit.

She glanced at Long Chen, seeing him lying down while still chewing on the grass. He was staring at the clouds, and it was unknown what he was thinking.

“Hey, didn’t you come to cheer me up? Why aren’t you saying anything else?” Ye Lingshan nudged him.

“Cheer you up? No. Even without me, with your ability, you would be able to walk out of this shadow on your own,” said Long Chen.

“You have such faith in me?” asked Ye Lingshan.

“Not just me. Everyone from the Martial Heaven Alliance believes in you the same way. Moreover, the alliance head’s sharp vision would not misjudge you. I came over because that girl Liu Ruyan is constantly vexing me, so I wanted to tease you and make myself feel better.” Long Chen closed his eyes lazily.

“You have no sense of shame.” Ye Lingshan snorted. This was far too shameless.

“This time, your assessment is on the mark.” Long Chen smiled.

After a moment’s hesitation, Ye Lingshan’s face twisted slightly. She said, “Long Chen…”

“What do you want? Let me tell you, my wives are right there, so don’t try anything improper!” Long Chen shot up, staring at Ye Lingshan with a shocked expression.

“You really piss me off!” Ye Lingshan clenched her teeth furiously and stood to walk away.

“Hehe, it was just a joke. Don’t take it so seriously. When did you become so petty?” Long Chen hastily grabbed her and plastered a smile onto his face.

“You really are hateful. I don’t know how those big sisters fell for you. If it was me, I’d have long since throttled you,” snorted Ye Lingshan at his wretched smile.

“That’s why we’re not the ones together, right? So what did you want to say just now?” asked Long Chen.

“It’s nothing,” said Ye Lingshan angrily.

“Hehe, it’s due to your heart-devil?”

Ye Lingshan didn’t reply. Long Chen knew Ye Lingshan’s character, which was the only reason he was teasing her like this. He didn’t expect her to react so strongly though.

“Actually, the matter of the heart-devil is not necessarily a bad thing. It is like a mirror reflecting your weaknesses. The greater you fear something, the clearer it will be in the mirror. You will see things that you don’t want to see, as a person cannot avoid looking into a mirror forever. Those who dare to look at their own weaknesses are those who can get stronger. When you’re bored, you might consider thinking even more about Dongfang Yuyang,” said Long Chen.

“What would I think about him for?” demanded Ye Lingshan.

“If you don’t, you won’t have a chance to reflect on this heart-devil. Once we leave the Star Field Divine World, I’ll be hunting him down. I don't know if what I killed last time was a clone or substitute, but even before I knew he was still alive, I felt that I had left him off too easily. I didn’t think that the heavens would treat me so well this time. They’ve given me another chance, and I’m going to cherish it. I won’t let such a despicable person have a comfortable death,” said Long Chen.

Last time, when he had killed Dongfang Yuyang, his rage had not been quenched after killing him. Long Chen had never encountered such a shameless person. Dongfang Yuyang had acted like an upright gentleman but was the exact opposite inside. Hence, killing him had not been satisfying enough.

Thinking of how he could kill him again, Long Chen was full of anticipation. Killing him twice was definitely a more satisfying ending.

“But once we’re out, the various powers…” said Ye Lingshan.

“It doesn’t matter who’s there. I’ll still kill him. They won’t be so lucky,” said Long Chen confidently.

Dongfang Yuyang was sinister and shameless. He was the most dangerous kind of enemy. Hence, he was number one on Long Chen’s to-kill list.

For some reason, after Long Chen had broken the cultivation rules of the Nine Star Hegemon Body Art, his confidence began to grow. If it had to be described as something, then he would consider it absolute daring.

“Why do all thorns become so simple in your hands?” Ye Lingshan smiled bitterly.

She had been too ashamed to even ask for help, but now she felt so childish, making her feel like needing to ask help from Long Chen for this tiny matter was embarrassing. But for some reason, she also felt that Long Chen gave off an extremely warm and reliable feeling, as if he could prop up the very heavens.

The so-called heart-devil inside of her had started to fade away. However, Ye Lingshan even considered doing as Long Chen said and not letting it fade so quickly. She needed the bravery to face it.

“To make complicated things simple is my life’s mission. Whether I do it correctly or not is a different matter though. Just making it simple is good. This is what the old man taught me,” said Long Chen.

“Perhaps the old man’s words are the only ones that can get through to you,” laughed Ye Lingshan.

“That depends on whether or not he’s right. If he’s wrong, I would retort even if he tries to hit me. Speaking of which, there might be some good news once we return.” Long Chen suddenly smiled.

“What good news? Why is your smile so sinister?” Ye Lingshan covered her mouth. That smile of Long Chen’s did not seem like it was good.

“The old man and the alliance head might very likely get married,” said Long Chen certainly.

“What? No way.”

“Why not? Their relationship has tied them together for a lifetime. The alliance head has sacrificed her best years for the Martial Heaven Alliance, while the old man is also a stubborn donkey and refuses to lower his head to her. The two of them care so much about each other but act like foes. Now, the two of them are finally getting along again, and they both intend to stay together. Once we return, the alliance head will be giving her position to you in full. She will be free. After that, I’m thinking that we should play matchmaker. You go advise the alliance head, and I’ll advise the old man,” said Long Chen.

“Giving advice is no problem, but both of them are stubborn and have their own pride. I’m not so sure it’s a good idea,” said Ye Lingshan.

After all, the two of them were of a certain age. Wouldn’t having a wedding ceremony make others ridicule them?

“The two of them have done far more shameless things. Why would they be afraid of this?”

“Are you telling the truth?” Ye Lingshan was startled to hear that.

“Let’s not discuss the matter of face. I’ll handle the old man. He loves the alliance head so much that he would sacrifice his life for her. He would definitely feel bad if he didn’t give her a grand ceremony. Both of them are heroes of the Martial Heaven Continent as they gave up their youth to their responsibilities. The juniors like us must make things up to them,” said Long Chen.

“Fine, I’ll try it. But I don’t know if I can convince her,” said Ye Lingshan.

“Then we’ve decided. I’ll handle the old man, and the alliance head will just have to take the donkey downhill,” said Long Chen.

“Are you cursing the old man?” laughed Ye Lingshan.

After discussing this matter, Ye Lingshan felt much more relaxed. Her heart-devil was cast aside, and she also joined Meng Qi and the others up on the mother tree for fun.

Time passed by quickly. One day, runes appeared over Long Chen and the others’ bodies. A strange aura began to grow around them.Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

“Everyone, gather up!” shouted Long Chen. The day of their return to the Martial Heaven Continent had finally arrived.
