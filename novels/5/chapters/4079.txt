Chapter 4068 Landing on the Nirvana Overflow Heaven

Long Chen was about to summon Lei Linger to consume the lightning, but the Earth Cauldron suddenly quivered again. After that, all the lightning serpents instantly vanished.

Heaven and earth became silent as if nothing had occurred. As for the nine golden pills inside the Earth Cauldron, lines of lightning now appeared on top of them. They had become tribulation pills.

“It’s… it’s done?”

Long Chen was stunned. He felt like the refinement had yet to start, but it was already over. It was so fast that he couldn’t even react.

This lightning had almost been equal to the Immortal King tribulation of a Double Supreme. But it was absorbed by the Earth Cauldron before it even fell.

In the blink of an eye, the tribulation was over, and the golden pills turned into tribulation pills. At this moment, Long Chen simply stared at the Immortal King Pills sparkling with golden light and lines of lightning. He had to admit that he was truly shaken.

At first, Long Chen had been thinking that using the Earth Cauldron to refine pills would be incredibly difficult. But after warming it up and sacrificing the medicinal ingredients to it, everything became easy, so easy that he couldn’t believe it. It felt like a dream; it didn’t seem real.

When he picked up the medicinal pills, he could sense the vast medicinal energy inside of them. A single pill felt like an entire world to itself, and immense energy flowed within it, manifesting its own laws.

“These top grade golden pills are incredibly powerful. I’ve never seen such powerful golden pills. Long Chen, you’re amazing.” Yu Qingxuan stared at the golden pills excitedly.

“It’s not that I’m amazing, it’s the cauldron. I don’t dare to believe that this is real,” said Long Chen.

Long Chen continued refining pills. After tossing the ingredients inside, everything went as easily as before. At first, the cauldron was sealed in just a few breaths’ time. Then, when Long Chen put his hand on the lid, a powerful suction absorbed his essence, qi, and spirit, triggering the tribulation clouds. In the end, the Earth Cauldron simply shook for a bit and all the lightning in the sky vanished, a sign that nine top grade golden pills were born.

Following that, heavenly tribulation began to repeatedly gather and vanish, gather and vanish.

Each cauldron of pills was complete in just a few breaths’ time, and Long Chen spent four hours refining like this. In the end, he was incredibly weary, his face pale and his aura weak. It felt like his essence, qi, and spirit were exhausted, so he had no choice but to stop.

In four hours, Long Chen had done two hundred and forty-some refinements, which resulted in over two thousand golden pills.Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

This result was terrifying. Every cauldron of pills contained only top grade golden pills, and no other tiers appeared, let alone garbage pills. Looking at over two thousand top grade golden pills, Long Chen felt so blessed that he was going to pass out.

“I understand. The Pill Dao is to gather the essence of vegetation with the spiritual qi of heaven and earth, turning it into one body. Between heaven and earth, the alchemist is the bridge. Thus, heaven, earth, and man are three entities in one. The heavens have three treasures, the sun, moon, and stars, while man has three treasures, essence, qi, and spirit. By drawing the essence, qi, and spirit into the pill, you can join the pill with heaven and earth,” said Yu Qingxuan.

While Long Chen was bitterly having his essence, qi, and spirit extracted, Yu Qingxuan was pondering what this meant in terms of alchemy. Why was the Earth Cauldron doing this? After comprehending, she grew excited. She had once more broken through a bottleneck on the Pill Dao.

“Qingxuan, why don’t you try using the Earth Cauldron? Then we can take turns and refine more pills,” said Long Chen.

The Earth Cauldron wasn’t something that could see the light of day. However, now they were alone on the heavenly river, so they could be brazen and use it like this. Once they arrived somewhere else, they wouldn’t be able to be this careless anymore.

But then, Long Chen felt powerless over the fact that the Earth Cauldron refused to pay any attention to Yu Qingxuan. She couldn’t even send her flame into it. Thus, they could only give up.

However, Yu Qingxuan wasn’t disappointed. After the failed attempt, she simply took out her own pill furnace and started a refinement. The Earth Cauldron had enlightened her, and when her refinement was complete, it also drew down heavenly tribulation.

This time, the Earth Cauldron didn’t move. It seemed that it disdained absorbing heavenly tribulation that it didn’t summon.

Long Chen then called out Lei Linger, and she devoured the tribulation lightning. After she was done, Yu Qingxuan opened the lid to reveal a top grade golden pill, along with some other high grade pills as well. This was not luck or coincidence. Her alchemy skills had greatly improved at this one moment.

However, Yu Qingxuan’s top grade golden pill had not gone through tribulation, so Long Chen simply handed it to Lei Linger, and Lei Linger quickly returned a tribulation golden pill to her.

“This is possible?” Yu Qingxuan was stunned. Was this not cheating? However, it was truly a tribulation pill. She had never thought that tribulation pills could be created like that.

After resting for a few hours, Long Chen continued refining pills. The effect of top grade golden pills was so great that Long Chen didn’t dare to give them to Guo Ran and the others, afraid that they would have trouble with the pills.

However, he had to take advantage while there was no one on the heavenly river to refine as many pills as possible. Yu Qingxuan simply stood beside Long Chen, and at the same time, sensed the fluctuations of the Earth Cauldron, using the experience to corroborate her Pill Dao.

When Long Chen rested, Yu Qingxuan refined pills herself, merging her new insights from the Earth Cauldron into her refinements. Even though she was merely using a World Domain pill furnace, she was also capable of refining top grade golden pills. Almost every single refinement produced one.

Although they were both top grade golden pills, the actual quality of her pills was inferior to the top grade golden pills of the Earth Cauldron. But even so, Yu Qingxuan had improved immensely compared to before.

Yu Qingxuan didn’t even care about all the top grade golden pills that she was refining. What truly excited her was that her comprehension of the Pill Dao had climbed a level. It was like she had found the golden key to a treasure chest of enlightenment.

As the two of them continuously refined pills, heavenly tribulation clouds kept forming above them, only to be absorbed by the Earth Cauldron or Lei Linger. It was truly a bizarre scene.

While Long Chen and Yu Qingxuan refined pills, the others didn’t slack off either. They focused on their own cultivation. Although they didn’t dare to consume the golden pills that Long Chen refined, they did consume the golden pills that Yu Qingxuan refined.

Yu Qingxuan’s golden pills were amazingly effective and so powerful that even Guo Ran and the others were almost unable to consume them. They were somewhat unable to suppress their medicinal energy, resulting in their realms almost charging into the eighth Heavenstage after consuming one pill.

However, if they simply broke through like that, it would not be a blessing but rather a problem, causing their foundations to grow unsteady.

Hence, they did their best to suppress the power of the pill while also cultivating, which caused a portion of the medicinal pill’s energy to be wasted. Although it was a bit wasteful, it was better than having their foundations grow unstable.

A full month passed just like that. Guo Ran, Xia Chen, and the Dragonblood warriors also managed to slowly break through to the eighth Heavenstage thanks to the golden pills.

On this day, Long Chen finally stopped refining pills and looked into the distance solemnly.

“The wind is rising. Everybody, prepare yourself. The Ghost Ship is about to land, and we’re about to set foot into the Nirvana Overflow Heaven.”

Hearing this, everyone tensed up. The Nirvana Overflow Heaven was even more ancient than the Violet Flame Heaven, so there were countless experts here. It was their new challenge. At the same time, they looked forward to reuniting with their brothers that had been scattered throughout the Nirvana Overflow Heaven.
