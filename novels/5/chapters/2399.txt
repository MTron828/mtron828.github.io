Chapter 2389 The Divine Families’ Treasury

Translator: BornToBe

As they walked across the bridge, quite a few people looked toward Long Chen. It was surprising to see someone who wasn’t wearing the robes of the divine families here. Outsiders were rarely allowed to enter this place.

Those gazes weren’t very friendly, but neither were they hostile. Perhaps these people didn’t know who he was.

Shen Chengfeng and the two vice commanders stuck close to Long Chen, afraid of him doing something.

Long Chen sighed inside at what he saw. This place was truly worthy of being the treasury of the divine families. The inside of the mountain had been fully excavated and turned into a tower with dozens of levels. The inside was like a shop in the secular world.

However, it wasn’t as noisy as in the secular world’s markets. The people inside were all minding their own business, walking hurriedly with their heads down. These people weren’t here for sightseeing. They immediately left after buying what they wanted.

“Large items like war chariots are found on the lowest level. Do you want to go take a look and help give us ideas?” probed Shen Chengfeng.

“Alright, let’s take a look.” Long Chen nodded. Since Shen Chengfeng and the others had asked him to come here, he would put aside his own matters temporarily.

They arrived at the bottom level. This place was no different from above. It still looked like a giant store, except on a larger scale. Every item was hundreds of meters in size.

There was one area with giant stone platforms, and war chariots were displayed on each of them.

Those war chariots were not just models. They were true war chariots. The formations on the stone platforms shrank them from their original size.

There was no introduction written on top of the stone platforms. There were attendants around, but they were all icy. They didn’t even look at the customers.

Only when someone needed them would they do their duty of exchanging their points and give them a certificate for the warehouse to bring out an item.

There was no such thing as bargaining here, nor was there any chance of anyone stealing something. These people were merely in charge of exchanging the points. They were apathetic.

“Long Chen, this model is the one that Ye Lingfeng had. The price is a hundred thousand points. It is a flexible item capable of offense and defense. Chariots like this that can fly through space are absolute treasures. They aren’t just a powerful killing weapon but also proof of status and power.”

“Let’s look at the others.” Long Chen didn’t reply directly.

Long Chen looked through the wares, seeing many war chariots, ballistas, and cannons. He even saw the Divine Dragon Tyrant Crossbow.

Every item he saw was a supreme killing item with terrifying power. There was not one person who wouldn’t want them. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

However, after looking through them all, Long Chen asked, “Why don’t you tell me your own thoughts?”

“We are thinking of getting eight chariots. We have eight large fighting squads, so each of them can have one. We have another two squads, and I’m preparing to get them a God Slaying Cannon and a Heavenly Shield Formation. That will multiply the power of the eighth legion. Even compared to the third legion, our power would not be lacking,” said Shen Chengfeng confidently.

“However, using these tools will increase the costs of each fight,” said Long Chen.

“We’ve considered this. Only a large investment can bring the greatest rewards. We can increase our hunting range and kill more demonic beasts,” said Shen Chengfeng.

Long Chen nodded. “Yes, you’ve factored in the battle costs. But there is one cost that you did not factor in.”

“What factor?

“The cost to the people.”

Shen Chengfeng looked at him oddly. “What do you mean?”

Long Chen hesitated. Looking around and seeing no one else around, he said, “Fine, since you’ve taken me as a brother, I’ll tell you. After obtaining such a powerful support, will the eighth legion’s warriors still possess the same courage to face death as they have now? Money can be a double-sided blade. If you master it, it can be used as a sharp weapon and allow you to soar. But if you can’t control it, you become a puppet to it. You become reliant on it, and your will is slowly ground down. Normally, going from poor to rich takes a long time, and you will get used to it. But people with overnight success haven’t gone through that process. Their wealth pulls them into a bottomless abyss. None of your ideas are wrong, but you have not taken into account how it will affect yourselves. Once things are comfortable and easy, the eighth legion’s power will soon collapse.”

“This…” Shen Chengfeng began to sweat. The vice commanders also felt a chill.

They truly had felt like the newly rich. They wanted to quicken their pace, but now they thought about where this money had come from. Had not it been the result of Long Chen bringing them along in a con? They had money now but what about in the future? What about when Long Chen wasn’t here? Would things go so smoothly all the time?

Long Chen solemnly said, “There is something else. No matter who you’re working for, make sure to think about yourself as well. Even if you have to be a chess piece, you have to consider the entire board and leave yourself a way out. Suddenly soaring in power will turn you into a sharp blade to be used, but no matter how sharp the blade, if struck too many times, it can still shatter. Don’t wait until you’re too damaged to do anything to realize this, because then it will be too late. Another blade will replace you. If you don’t want to be abandoned, maintain your sharpness.”

“Senior apprentice-brother Long Chen, I don’t quite understand. Can you explain it more directly?” asked one of the vice commanders.

Long Chen was speechless. Was he supposed to directly say that the Long family was using them, and if they weren’t useful enough, they could easily be discarded? It was just like Ye Lingfeng’s vice commander who had been sacrificed. It was because he didn’t bring them enough value.

Shen Chengfeng understood. These words had surpassed the scope of a friend. If the Long family were to learn that Long Chen was telling them these things, they wouldn’t like it. However, Long Chen had still told them, treating them as brothers. This warning contained great meaning and was an alarm to him.

“I understand. Long Chen, what should we do then?” asked Shen Chengfeng.

“Buy one chariot. That thing can save your lives at a critical moment. The rest should be spent on raising each person’s individual power. Don’t let our brothers get so arrogant that their tails raise all the way into the heavens. Otherwise, the next time someone’s slapped in the face, it will be you. The eighth legion’s current strongest point is your cohesiveness and the spirit to refuse to admit defeat. If they have nothing stopping their arrogance, you’ll have to set up something yourself. It’s not always a good thing for your steps to be big. Steadiness while maintaining everyone’s passion will allow you to stay sharp,” said Long Chen.

Shen Chengfeng nodded. “I understand. We’ll buy one war chariot. Half will be spent on pills, weapons, and armor, while the remaining half can be saved for a reward system for the brothers that do outstanding work. Haha, if they do well enough, I might just give them my commander spot.”

Long Chen smiled. Shen Chengfeng had finally understood. Long Chen hoped that he would remember these words, as they might be able to save his life one day. After all, the interior of the divine families was extremely complicated.

Shen Chengfeng quickly went to buy his items. Furthermore, he only bought the armor that was one level higher than the warriors’ current armor. He would raise his legion one step at a time.

Long Chen didn’t follow him when he went to buy the weapons and armor. Instead, he went for his own stroll.

He wasn’t interested in these large items. Although they were powerful, they weren’t too useful. The war chariot required hundreds or even thousands of people to use. They were too awkward to use properly. The Dragonblood Legion wouldn’t play with something like that.

However, as he strolled through the treasury, he activated a photographic jade from inside the primal chaos space. Although there was no way to see the secrets in the core, just what was present on the surface was definitely enough to benefit Guo Ran and Xia Chen.

No one bothered him as he strolled through the wares. After spending around an hour in the area of the large-scale weapons, Long Chen went up to the floor with the medicinal pills. It was packed with people unlike the bottom floor.

“As expected, the divine families have alchemists capable of refining top grade eleventh tier pills. Based on their auras, they were refined within the last three years.”

Long Chen saw a medicinal pill on a sales counter that showed off the power of the divine families. On the Martial Heaven Continent, each top grade pill was something countless people fought for but were still unable to buy. But here, there were counters filled with them. That was a bit frightening. Was this to say that the divine families were even more skilled in alchemy than Pill Valley?

Long Chen squeezed through the crowds. He found that the area ahead was much emptier. That was because this was the area for twelfth tier pills.

“Damn, one pill is over thirty thousand points?!”

Seeing a Star Cloud Soul Nourishing Pill, a top grade twelfth tier pill, Long Chen was gobsmacked. Three pills were equivalent to a war chariot? No wonder there were so few people here.

“The Seven Star Soul Fixing Pill. This is also to nourish the soul.”

“Divinity Star Raising Pill. This is used for strengthening astral spaces. That’s quite rare.”

“This is…”

Long Chen saw quite a few twelfth tier pills on display. Those pills were nonexistent on the Martial Heaven Continent. Perhaps Pill Valley did possess them, but they were hidden.

The various pills amazed Long Chen. There were hundreds of kinds. At the end was the area for medicinal ingredients. That was his real target. But he had just arrived and started to appraise the medicinal ingredients present when a quivering voice rang out.

“Big brother Long Chen!”
