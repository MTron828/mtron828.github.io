Chapter 5032 The Strongest Dragon Blood Battle Armor


Two figures tumbled back, leaving two large ditches in the ground. When they regained their footings and stood up, they were covered in dust and dirt.

They stared in shock at Long Chen, who was now covered in blood-colored dragon scales. A blood-colored cloak floated gently in the wind, while a pitch-black and sinister saber rested on Long Chen’s shoulder.

Behind him, a divine ring spun, with a giant dragon figure inside it. The enormous divine ring could barely contain a few scales of the dragon, its full form impossible to see. This scene sent chills through everyone’s soul.

“Hahaha, this is Boss’s strongest state!” Qin Feng shouted in excitement upon seeing this familiar sight. Long Ziwei and Gui Jiu stood dumbfounded.

Compared to before, the aura of Long Chen’s Dragon Blood Battle Armor didn’t erupt crazily. There were no qi currents unfurling into the sky. Furthermore, there was now a never-before-seen rune on every single scale. That rune was extremely faint, so faint that it wouldn’t be noticed without looking closely.

However, it was this faint rune that caused Long Chen’s aura to undergo a complete transformation. His power was no longer crazily raging outside his body, but reserved within him. Now, his Dragon Blood Battle Armor lacked some of its wildness but had gained a new depth. If Long Chen had been like a tall waterfall splashing down with torrential power, now he was like a deep blue sea. The surface of the sea was completely calm, but endless power was hidden beneath the serene exterior.

“What just happened?” asked Jiang Wuwang, turning to Feng Fei. Distracted for a moment, he didn’t see how Long Chen had sent them flying. Did Long Chen hack the two of them with his saber? Or did he use some other technique to send both of them flying at the same time?

“Before they could reach Long Chen, they were blasted away by his aura,” replied Feng Fei.

“Don’t joke around.” Jiang Wuwang shook his head irritably, thinking that Feng Fei was joking with him.

Feng Fei didn’t argue; her full attention was on Long Chen. Since she had chosen to be a spectator, she had to watch properly. She couldn’t be the slightest bit distracted.

The four divine clans’ peak experts were no longer so calm, especially the Ye and Zhao clans. They started to feel uneasy.

Although they had set up many backup plans, Long Chen continuously revealed more trump cards, so they started to get nervous.

On the battlefield, Ye Lingxiao and Zhao Qingtian had no idea what had just happened. They hadn’t even seen Long Chen take out his weapon before they smashed into something and were sent flying.

Long Chen’s aura had undergone a complete transformation. His cultivation base was no longer at the ninth Heavenstage; he had ascended to the great circle of the Divine Venerate realm. Despite all of them being Divine Venerates, Long Chen’s aura appeared significantly denser than theirs.

At this moment, people could clearly sense Long Chen’s cultivation base, which shocked them even more. Long Chen’s aura was even stronger than the peak heavenly geniuses of the ancient era.

Throughout this entire competition, it seemed only Long Tianrui’s aura could match Long Chen’s. This discovery made the higher-ups of the four divine clans even more uneasy.

Long Chen lazily looked through the barrier at the Long clan leader’s shocked face. 

Long Chen asked, “So? Do you regret it? Did you think killing me and shifting blame to the Brahma Pill Valley would be enough to solve everything? I pity you. You do possess some intelligence. Unfortunately, your prejudice against me and my father is a fatal flaw. With our characters, we would have eventually repaid any favor to the Long clan. While the benefits you gave me were rightfully mine, I couldn’t accept them without feeling indebted to you. Regrettably, your intelligence was eclipsed by your greed. Then with two pig-like teammates inciting you, you chose a path of no return.”

Now that things had reached this point, there was no need for pretenses. Long Chen had no misgivings, so they might as well lay all their cards on the table.

The Long clan leader gritted his teeth and said, “You are spouting nonsense. If it weren’t for you wantonly killing people—”

“That’s enough. You’ve shown your true face. Spouting more pompous lies is meaningless now. However, there is one thing I want to ask you, clan leader,” interjected Long Chen.

Seeing Long Chen not mentioning the Earth Cauldron, the clan leader was in no rush to lock down the barrier. He replied, “What do you want to ask?”

Pointing at Ye Lingxiao and Zhao Qingtian, Long Chen questioned, “Do you not want these two things? Do you want to use my hands to get rid of them?”

Seeing this scene, Ye Lingxiao and Zhao Qingtian were enraged. Long Chen was looking down on them too much.

Zhao Qingtian suddenly crumbled into mud, and from it emerged a mud figure who silently took on Zhao Qingtian’s form. This mud figure swiftly thrust its glaive at Long Chen’s back.

This strange scene unfolded before the eyes of everyone, startling them as they had never seen such a bizarre attack before. It was practically impossible to defend against.

“Country bumpkins only know how to launch sneak attacks from behind,” remarked Long Chen, still looking at the Long clan leader. Without turning around, he swung Evilmoon behind him, and it accurately intercepted Zhao Qingtian’s glaive.

The earth erupted, sending a massive shockwave in every direction. Zhao Qingtian coughed up blood and was hurled across the ground, landing heavily in the distance amidst a cloud of dust that billowed like a waterfall in reverse.Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Struggling to his feet, Zhao Qingtian suddenly spat out a mouthful of blood. The Zhao clan’s experts were no longer able to sit still; fear had finally gripped them.

“Damn, it’s that strong?”

Long Chen himself was startled. Although the Earth Cauldron had promised that the Dragon Blood Battle Armor would give him a nice surprise after cultivating the dragon blood God Slaying Cross, this surprise was beyond expectation. A casual blow had sent Zhao Qingtian flying.

“Are you joking? The Sovereign Blood Seal has appeared on your scales. Though faint, a trace of Sovereign might isn’t a joke. This surpasses all laws,” said the Earth Cauldron.

Seeing Zhao Qingtian being sent flying, Ye Lingxiao felt no pity. Looking at Zhao Qingtian mockingly, Ye Lingxiao cursed, “Idiot, I knew your earth energy was trash. In the end, it’s up to me.”

Turning to Long Chen with a sinister smile, Ye Lingxiao continued, “I admit you’re very strong, but you’ll still die. No one can block the complete Lingfeng Possession.”

“Lingxiao, don’t!” The Ye clan leader cried out in fright upon hearing this.

Buzz.

Ye Lingxiao slowly closed his eyes. When he reopened them, his pupils had completely changed. His aura became incredibly ancient, transforming him into someone no longer recognizable as Ye Lingxiao.

As he raised his sword toward Long Chen, an ancient voice echoed forth.

“I am Lingfeng. Who are you?”
