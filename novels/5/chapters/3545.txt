Chapter 3534

The giant net fell, enveloping heaven and earth. Seven devil race experts were besieging a giant flame lizard and didn’t even sense anything before they were caught by the net.

“Contract!”

Long Chen shouted and the Phoenix Blood Heavenly Silk Net instantly contracted. After that, those seven devil experts and the giant flame lizard exploded, and a sphere of light appeared in the net.

However, before Long Chen could even move, Huo Linger had transformed into a flame dragon and devoured it. From the moment of the attack until the gains were devoured, only a blink of an eye had passed.

“Damn, this Phoenix Blood Heavenly Silk Net is too powerful! It is practically a waste of a treasure in Luo Zijun’s hands!” Long Chen was incredibly excited.

That Heavenly Flame Spirit with two kinds of runes was equivalent to a second Heavenstage World King, but it was instantly killed without the slightest ability to resist.

Even those devil experts and their weapons were destroyed. In front of the Phoenix Blood Heavenly Silk Net, the Heavenly Flame Spirit that was on par with a second Heavenstage World King was trash.

“With such a good treasure, if I didn’t take advantage, I would be wasting it.”

Seeing how terrifying the Phoenix Blood Heavenly Silk Net was, Long Chen didn’t waste any time. He continued rushing deeper.

Huo Linger had told him that the flame energy contained within this stronger Heavenly Flame Spirit was over ten times greater than what those first Heavenstage Heavenly Flame Spirits had.

Furthermore, Huo Linger was originally a spirit of ten thousand flames. So, absorbing the Heavenly Flame Spirits could not be easier for her. As her power slowly grew bit by bit, she had the urge to devour the entire Heavenly Flame World.

This Heavenly Flame World could be viewed as the starting point of her transformation.

Huo Linger and Lei Linger had always been Long Chen’s strongest trump cards. However, after entering the immortal world, Lei Linger’s power far surpassed Huo Linger’s. In fact, their combined attack actually required Lei Linger to weaken her power to cooperate with Huo Linger. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

Huo Linger had her own pride, and although she hadn’t said anything, she thirsted to get stronger inside. Now, she finally had that chance.

Suddenly, the land in front of them vanished, replaced by a sea of lava. Long Chen saw quite a few lifeforms flying to and fro on top of the sea of lava. It was like they were chasing something.

BOOM!

All of a sudden, one lifeform shouted and threw his flying trident into the sea. A three-foot-long fish was pierced and dredged out of the lava sea.

However, the fish unexpectedly hurled a mouthful of flames at that lifeform, who then hastily swung his trident to the side, parrying the flames.

Even so, many parts of him were already charred black. Clearly, he had been struck by those flames several times now. Supposedly, it was his experience that allowed him to parry the last attack.

“Damn, there are Heavenly Flame Spirits beneath the lava sea as well?!” Long Chen was startled.

These strange fish were actually first Heavenstage Heavenly Flame Spirits. That lifeform immediately put away the Heavenly Flame Spirit after obtaining it.

Everyone here was not intent on directly absorbing them for fear of someone else attacking them in the middle. Just like Luo Zijun, they were waiting to gather sufficient quantities before finding a safe place to absorb the spirits.

Furthermore, everyone was tense, looking at each other cautiously. Even those from the same race couldn’t be trusted.

If they were truly powerful, they would instantly sense the danger to their lives and wouldn’t hesitate to flee from this place.

After that lifeform obtained one fish, he looked around and tossed something into the lava sea. Due to how quick his movements were, Long Chen didn’t even see what it was.

However, with his powerful Spiritual Strength, Long Chen found that after that person tossed that thing, another fish was drawn over. The moment the fish ate what he had tossed out, he threw his trident, catching another Heavenly Flame Spirit.

“Not bad. You can actually go fishing here.”

Long Chen instantly understood that this fellow was likely tossing flame ores into the lava sea. The fish were attracted to those flame ores.

However, these ores would have their energy quickly dissipate within this lava sea. In just a few breaths, they would turn into chunks of garbage.

It was precisely due to this that they drew over these fish with their flame energy. However, the chances of success using this method were too low. If there were no fish in the surroundings when you tossed the ore out, you would just be constantly losing bait. The main thing was still luck.

“Luck? Fuck your luck. I’m not relying on that thing.”

Long Chen shook his head and directly flew toward the lava sea. With his Spiritual Strength stretched out, he started to search for those fish.

However, he quickly found that it was too deep for his Spiritual Strength to penetrate all the way. He could only spread it a hundred miles in.

Long Chen also found that these fish weren’t in groups. They were all isolated, but he didn’t want to foolishly try to bait them like others.

“Huo Linger, you lure them together. We’ll catch all of them in one go!”

Long Chen had Huo Linger transform into millions of tiny flame dragons that entered the lava sea. She then spread throughout this region.

As expected, those tiny flame dragons quickly drew the attention of the fish. They chased the tiny flame dragons down to consume them.

With Huo Linger’s power spread, she couldn’t beat these strange fish that were comparable to first Heavenstage World Kings. Hence, she only played a game of cat and mouse with them.

In just a bit, countless flame dragons caused the lava sea to roil. Countless fish were chasing them, and even some fish from the depths of the sea were disturbed.

The giant lava sea roiled and raged as countless fish went crazy chasing after the tiny flame dragons.

Controlling all these split bodies was very difficult for Huo Linger, so some of them were consumed.

But she wasn’t worried. She continued to direct them all to one place, and those fish flocked over in inestimable numbers.

The moment they were all gathered in a ten-thousand-mile area, Long Chen cast out the Phoenix Blood Heavenly Silk Net, which instantly covered that area.

The surface of the lava exploded as the fish struggled within the net. Long Chen had caught hundreds of thousands of them. However, the net shook as they resisted with all their power. Explosions repeatedly sent pillars of lava soaring into the sky.

As the fish resisted with all their power and spat out flames, Long Chen was shocked to find that there were actually too many of them. He was unable to reel them in.

“Huo Linger, help me contract the net!” Long Chen quickly reacted. These were no fish after all; they were a group of World King Heavenly Flame Spirits.

At this moment, the Phoenix Blood Heavenly Silk Net glowed. Those struggling fish exploded into flame runes when they smashed into the net.

With Huo Linger’s flame energy injected into it, the silk’s runes lit up and explosions rang out from inside the net. In just a few breaths’ time, those fish were all turned into runic spheres.

After that, Huo Linger transformed into a giant dragon and devoured all those flame runes. In an instant, Huo Linger became a fatty. Her aura grew crazily.

But when the lava sea began to rise, Long Chen’s expression changed. Putting away the Phoenix Blood Heavenly Silk Net, he fled.

BOOM!

He had just left when a giant mouth broke through the surface of the lava and tried to devour him.
