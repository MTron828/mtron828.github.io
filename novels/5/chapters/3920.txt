Chapter 3909 Flying Into a Rage

When this figure appeared behind Yin Changsheng, a wave of divine might raged in the air. After that, Yin Changsheng’s bloodline fluctuations and his every breath resonated with such force that the Heavenly Daos themselves trembled in response.

When his spear pierced through the air, it locked down heaven and earth, tearing through space straight at Mo Nian.

“What is this? Is it the master of your Sacred Pill Hall?” Mo Nian shouted as he stared at that giant figure. But just as the spear was about to reach him, his figure swayed and the spear passed by him.

“What?!”

Seeing this, countless people cried out in shock. This spear of Yin Changsheng had locked down heaven and earth with such power that even people outside the battlefield could sense that terrifying lock. But Mo Nian dodged it just like that, completely unaffected by it.

Yin Changsheng let out furious roars and repeatedly attacked, but each of his blows missed. Mo Nian was like a slippery fish. Despite clearly being locked down, he kept easily dodging. It made no sense according to the standards of the cultivation world, causing Yin Changsheng to feel like he might explode in fury.

“Hey, can I ask you a question? Is this fellow the master of your Sacred Pill Hall? Hey, don’t look like your dad just died. Can’t you speak?” asked Mo Nian as he repeatedly dodged. That tone was like he was chatting with a friend.

“Fuck off!” Yin Changsheng cursed. He had never cursed someone so much in this lifetime.

He had always thought that cursing was a display of weakness, the meaningless howls of the weak. But today, he found that cursing Mo Nian was the only way to cause any harm to him.

“Wow, your mouth is quite dirty! Did your parents feed you crap growing up?” scolded Mo Nian.

“If you have guts, fight me directly!” howled Yin Changsheng.

“Fool, you will never know how badass your grandpa Mo is. Have you not heard?” Mo Nian clapped his forehead like he was annoyed. As he dodged, he said, “I forgot something very important. Can you pause for a moment? Ladies and gentlemen, young and old, fall back. I’m going to start showing off now. Listen to this: the limitless palace in front of the limitless mountain, the limitless trees before the limitless gate, the dreams of heavenly geniuses vanish without a trace as soon as they encounter Mo Nian!”

“Go fuck yourself!” Yin Changsheng was purple with rage. Mo Nian was constantly dodging his attacks with an elusive grace akin to wisps of smoke, and none of his attacks had any effect whatsoever.

Mo Nian was treating him like a monkey to be toyed with while chanting such a thing for everyone. For Yin Changsheng, this act was even more enraging than when Mo Nian smacked him in the face with his shovel.

Yin Changsheng cursed all the way to Mo Nian’s eighteen generation ancestors, leaving countless people on the battlefield dumbfounded.

They had seen plenty of random lowlifes shouting curses on the streets, but they had never seen such a heavenly genius cursing like them.

The sound of a spear booming through space and raging curses mixed, covering all of heaven and earth. Yin Changsheng cursed with every attack, and he seemed to have gotten used to it. Now, his attacks grew fiercer, his curses sharper.

In the distance, heavenly geniuses wearing the robes of the Sacred Pill Hall were dumbfounded. Yin Changsheng was a god-like existence in their hearts, but he actually knew how to curse like this? They stared at him oddly, filled with disbelief.

They had yet to receive any orders from Yin Changsheng, so they didn’t dare to make any brash moves, simply hiding in the distance.

Not far from them were countless experts from the devil race, Blood race, demonic beast race, Giant race, Underworld race, and others.

This place had drawn countless people from various races. But most of them were only watching from a distance, not going into the core of the battlefield.

The core of the battlefield was filled with experts as well, but they were random cultivators or people from weaker groups, akin to a bunch of rabble. The truly powerful races and groups were only watching right now.

As Mo Nian fought Yin Changsheng, Meng Qi, Bai Shishi, the Pill Fairy, Bai Xiaole, and Guo Ran had started fighting the Underworld Eye Giant, Weng Tianyao, and the mysterious beast cultivator. They worked together to keep these three back.

Yue Zifeng and the Nine Underworld Luocha were still evenly matched, both of them unleashing waves of Sword Qi that tore through heaven and earth. No one dared to get close to their battlefield.

As for the Dragonblood Legion, countless people were assaulting them with no regard for their own lives. From time immemorial until now, treasures were always capable of driving people mad, and crazy people were the most frightening existence because they were unafraid of death. Now, the lunatics simply wanted to tear an opening in the Dragonblood Legion’s blockade and charge through. They all thought that they would be the ones to tear through and obtain the dragon scale.

However, they didn’t realize that as soon as one of them made an opening in the Dragonblood Legion’s defenses, countless spectators would flood over them. They would be drowned by those powerful experts and wouldn’t have any chance.

Alas, once a person was driven to this level of madness, they wouldn’t have this level of rationality. The only thing that they were thinking about was the treasure; everything else was unimportant.

More and more experts arrived on the scene, each exuding a progressively more intimidating aura. They were all monsters, existences that led their own races.

Just like the others, they didn’t directly join the battlefield but simply watched, making sure to keep an eye on the situation. They occupied favorable positions and waited for their chance.

“Not good. More and more people are coming. There’s nowhere to hide, nowhere to run!” cried out Bai Xiaole as he watched the sea of people grow.

“Useless brat, why hide, why run? If you’re so afraid, why even come out?” cursed the Violet Pupil Nine Tail Demon Fox. It was extremely dissatisfied with its contractual partner.

“But there are too many enemies! We’re capable of fighting outnumbered one to a hundred, one to a thousand, but now it’s going to be one against a million!” quibbled Bai Xiaole.Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

There were truly a frightening number of enemies now. Furthermore, they were growing increasingly powerful, staring at Long Chen like hungry wolves stalking their prey. Bai Xiaole had never been in such a terrifying situation, so he was naturally panicking a bit.

“Fool, no matter how many ants appear, can they bite an elephant to death? Shut your mouth! Stop speaking, you’re embarrassing me,” shouted the Violet Pupil Nine Tail Demon Fox.

“But I am a bit afraid…”

“You…!” The Violet Pupil Nine Tail Demon Fox wanted to slap him, but it endured. “Don’t worry, as long as I’m here, you won’t die. Focus on the battle at hand and concentrate your Spiritual Strength. When the moment comes, I will need your power.”

“Alright.”

Bai Xiaole was reinvigorated by this, and he concentrated on working together with the Violet Pupil Nine Tail Demon Fox.

Suddenly, four explosive sounds rang out from the east, south, west, and north. As four world-shaking auras could be sensed, all the experts shook and looked in those four directions.

“Divine Venerates that have fully merged their Supreme Blood and Supreme Bones?”

When they saw the four figures coming, countless people cried out in shock.
