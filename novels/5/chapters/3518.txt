Chapter 3507

That Lava Giant race’s expert descended like a meteor upon the city. He smashed into the ground outside the city, patted some dust off of his body, and then walked through the city gates just like that.

Although he had shrunk his body, he was still six meters tall. With the raging flames coming off of his body, his aura was astonishing.

The guards of the city usually took a fee from people entering the city gates, but when that Lava Giant appeared, those guards quivered and didn’t dare to approach him.

He was just like a moving volcano. Once he erupted, he could melt heaven and earth. The other cultivators also avoided him.

“This is also a terrifying figure.” Long Chen’s heart shook. This person’s power was as vast as a sea. He was another unfathomable existence.

The Lava Giant race was considered one of heaven and earth’s spirit races. They possessed unending longevity. However, it was said that they were naturally violent and not easy to get along with. Thus, other lifeforms preferred to avoid them as much as possible.

The Dragon Blaze Prefecture’s capital city had three gates to go through before it counted as the inner city.

The inside of the city was exceptionally lively recently. Just walking through the streets, Long Chen was bumping shoulders with countless experts. Also, he had never seen so many flame attribute cultivators in his life before.

However, countless experts glanced at Long Chen oddly when they walked past him. That was because there were no flame energy fluctuations coming from him.

It had to be known that the Dragon Blaze Prefecture was a place where flame energy gathered. Other than flame cultivators, others found it very difficult to exist in such an environment. Thus, Long Chen was particularly conspicuous.

The street was wide, and it was a single straight line with countless buildings on both sides. They were ancient and yet prospering. Everything was neat and tidy.

No one dared to cause any trouble in the Dragon Blaze Prefecture because there was a supremely terrifying city lord here. Furthermore, this city lord’s temper wasn’t good.

It didn’t matter what race you were from or what background you had. As long as you broke the rules here, you would be sternly punished.

It was forbidden to fight within the inner city. If you had to fight, then there were hundreds of martial stages in the outer city. You could always challenge people to life-and-death duels there.

The martial stages here were another large feature of the Dragon Blaze Prefecture. It was because the Dragon Blaze Prefecture’s experts liked to bet on the results. Even the city lord himself would bet sometimes when there was a fight between real experts.

However, due to his status, he was only gambling for fun and didn’t put down much as a wager. That would harm his dignity as the city lord.

Thus, the martial stages in the outer city were quite popular. There were always a few life-and-death challenges going on. Sometimes, it would even take days before it was your turn to fight.

However, there were some restrictions. If too much time passed, the observers would be irritated. Thus, if they took too long, then the battle would end and the fighters could simply leave.

Compared to the rest of the Chaotic Star Sea’s prefectures, the Dragon Blaze Prefecture was more orderly. The city at least was prospering.

People were coming and going on the street. There were countless experts, but there was no need to worry about safety. In fact, most people had relaxed smiles.

Although Long Chen didn’t have flame fluctuations, causing quite a few people to look at him oddly and perhaps even disdainfully, no one provoked him.

Suddenly, a disturbance appeared up ahead, startling Long Chen. What? Did people feel like this place was too orderly, so they just had to cause a fight?

However, he quickly found that he was wrong. It wasn’t a fight. It seemed that some amazing figure had appeared, drawing countless others over to take a look.

“Heavens, the Daluo Star-Field’s fairy Qingxuan has actually descended upon our Chaotic Star Sea!” A shocked cry rang out.

“Fairy Qingxuan?” Long Chen’s heart skipped a beat.

“The Daluo Star-Field’s fairy Qingxuan? The one said to be the number one flame element heavenly genius to appear in the Violet Flame Heaven in the past thirty million years? Who would have thought that she’d appear here?”

“It’s rumored that she crossed heavens not long ago, obtaining the rank nine Heavenly Flame, the Heavenly Rainbow Flame, in the Darklight Heaven. She is this era’s master of the Heavenly Rainbow Flame.” Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

“Some people estimate that despite only being a Divine Lord, she has power that can match the fourth Heavenstage World Kings! I wonder if it’s true or false.”

“Who cares if it’s true or false? I heard that fairy Qingxuan has a Heavenly Flame body, that when she was born, a Jewel Blood Jade Orchid burned in the heavens for three days and nights- Hey, who is pushing me?!”

That man was enraged, barely glimpsing a black-robed man pushing past him. He tried to grab the black-robed man, but the latter had already slipped through.

Long Chen’s heart was pounding hard. She was Qingxuan. The Jewel Blood Jade Orchid was proof of their love. He was finally seeing her again.

Long Chen was shoving forward regardless. He was extremely powerful, and others were unable to stop him. Hence, those people cursed at Long Chen furiously when he pushed through them, but they didn’t dare to attack him.

Long Chen ignored them. He pushed through and quickly saw a group of people around a woman, like stars around the moon.

“Qingxuan…”

When Long Chen saw the same white-robed Yu Qingxuan that was like a lotus flower just breaking out of the surface of the water, untouched by a single speck of dust, his eyes reddened and tears almost came out.

This was the woman that he owed a thousand reincarnations to, the one who moved the most tender part of his heart. Long Chen’s heartbeats quickened. Looking at her familiar face, he thought of the Martial Heaven Continent. He thought of how she had died in his arms, and he didn’t know how he could repay her.

Now, she no longer recognized him, and he didn’t know how he could awaken her memories. He simply stared at her, his mind blank.

There were over ten men around Yu Qingxuan, passionately talking to her. Every single one of them possessed very powerful auras. Furthermore, their clothes were luxurious, and they wore golden crowns and jade belts. Every single one of them gave off the aura of World Domain divine items.

Even the golden thread on their sleeves was made out of the highest grade King item materials. A design made of this golden thread might surpass the savings of most families.

These men looked at Yu Qingxuan adoringly. It seemed that to express their emotions, they were introducing her to everything here.

Yu Qingxuan politely listened to all of their introductions, occasionally nodding. This single nod was the greatest encouragement to these people, and they grew even more passionate.

There was a group of guards behind Yu Qingxuan, and two of them actually had halos of light behind their heads. Their auras were even more terrifying than third Heavenstage World Kings. These two guards were two almighty fourth Heavenstage World Kings.

“Fairy Qingxuan, this is my Dragon Blaze Prefecture’s best restaurant, the Fallen Immortal Pavilion. In my opinion, this name perfectly matches how fairy Qingxuan has descended upon us,” said one of the handsome men, pointing at the restaurant.

“Young master Feng Xiang is wrongly praising me. Qingxuan does not dare to accept. It’s just that, young master Feng Xiang, gathering so many people doesn’t seem to be very appropriate.” Yu Qingxuan looked at the countless people surrounding her and felt a bit uncomfortable.

“How could it be inappropriate? Fairy Qingxuan, we are honored by your presence. As the city lord’s son, I naturally must receive you properly. Otherwise, people will laugh at my Feng family for being miserly. Fairy Qingxuan, everyone, please come this way. I’ve reserved the restaurant. Let us taste the delicacies, enjoy the sight, and discuss the Flame Dao. I’m sure that it will be exciting.” Feng Xiang gestured.

Yu Qingxuan didn’t seem to enjoy this kind of treatment, but having already reached this point and with how ardent this guy was being, she didn’t feel good rejecting him. She simply thanked him and was about to go into the restaurant when her gaze swept across the crowd once. A delighted smile then appeared on her face.

“Little brother, you’ve also come?”
