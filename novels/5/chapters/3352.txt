Chapter 3341 Reinforcements Arrive

Long Chen didn’t dare to look at those creatures in the pool. No matter what, they were definitely more terrifying than the Devil Eye Water Lily. They were just waiting for him to take the bait.

However, having reached this point, Long Chen couldn’t possibly give up. He slowly approached his target.

The flying boat was moving as slowly as possible to avoid making any waves. On the edge of their seats, the flying boat slowly descended to the foundation stone without drawing the attention of the Devil Eye Water Lily.

Long Chen then took out a fist-sized tower with nine levels. Clenching his teeth, he placed it on the foundation stone.

When the tower and foundation stone were connected, divine light erupted, filling this hole. After that, this dark world became as bright as daytime.

As a result, countless roars rang out and this valley boiled over. Huge dragons then filled the entrance, sealing this space.

A rumbling rang out at this moment as Devil Eye Water Lilies popped out of the pool. Other than the original one, there were now four more. Their auras were more terrifying than the original Devil Eye Water Lily.

Their leaves then spread, filling heaven and earth. Their explosive killing intent and divine sense swept through the valley.

After activating the divine tower, Long Chen sent the flying boat into the pool of water and hid their aura.

This was a typical case of it being the darkest beneath the light. Those Devil Eye Water Lilies swept their divine sense out repeatedly but were unable to find anything.nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

At this moment, Bai Shishi and the others were holding their breaths. Those Devil Eye Water Lilies were probably the seniors of their race. Their divine sense caused the void to rumble, and the sound made them quiver. If they were noticed, not even ten thousand lives would be enough to escape the calamity.

Huge dragons roared and circled the heavens, overlooking this entire space. But they were unable to find their target.

They were dumbfounded. How had their target vanished? After a bit, Long Chen’s heart leaped.

“We’ve been noticed!”

Long Chen hastily sent the boat flying out of the pool. Just as they flew out, the pool exploded. The rear of the flying boat was struck by water arrows, sending it tumbling through the air.

BOOM!

The flying boat was exposed and five sets of leaves wrapped around it. In that instant, the flying boat was completely caught.

Space twisted. Long Chen and the others seemed to arrive in a completely different world. In this world, they were as weak as ants.

BOOM!

The flying boat was torn apart, revealing Long Chen and the others. At this moment, threads targeted Long Chen like steel needles.

Bai Shishi and the others instantly found themselves unable to move an inch. They felt all their power be stripped from their bodies.

“Do you still want your lily seeds?!” shouted Long Chen.

With this shout, the countless threads stabbing toward Long Chen came to a stop right in front of his face.

The threads stopped, but a whistling wind blew by, to the point that Long Chen’s skin was about to break apart. This energy was absolutely terrifying. The helpers that the Devil Eye Water Lily had summoned were too terrifying.

“Hand over the seed pod. Otherwise, you’ll beg for death and not receive it,” said a sinister voice through spiritual fluctuations.

These fluctuations were very familiar. They were from the original Devil Eye Water Lily. Clearly, it still had some hope.

The Undying race truly did have low intelligence. Even the fact that Bai Shishi had refined the metal lily seed wasn’t sensed by it.

“If you want me to hand over the seed pod, alright. But you have to agree to one of my conditions,” shouted Long Chen.

“You have no qualifications to demand conditions. Hand it over or die!” roared the Devil Eye Water Lily.

It was quite tough to negotiate like this. It had the same temper as Liu Ruyan. Long Chen then said, “If I hand it over, will you let us leave?”

“No. You must die!” declared the Devil Eye Water Lily furiously.

Hm? Are you an idiot? You’ll kill if it’s handed over, and you’ll kill if it’s not handed over. What’s the point of such a threat? Are the Undying race all so stupid? Just how are we supposed to discuss anything?

“Let’s just discuss this! I will-” Long Chen smiled.

“Shut up! Treacherous human race, if you won’t hand it over, then die!”

BOOM!

The Devil Eye Water Lily’s temper was very explosive. It actually didn’t give Long Chen a chance to speak. Those threads continued to stab toward them.

Encountering this fool made Long Chen want to curse. He had been trying to stall for time, but there was no communicating with this fool.

It was going to use its tentacles to control them. Unable to move his body, Long Chen was about to unleash the black soil of the primal chaos space again. However, whether or not it would be effective again this time was up to luck.

BOOM!

However, before Long Chen could make his move, the space that they were in exploded. They felt their bodies lighten, and the bindings around them vanished in an instant.

After that, Long Chen saw a pair of eyes, a pair of eyes that covered the dome of the heavens. It was the Three Flower Pupils.

“Mom!”

Bai Xiaole cried out delightedly. Only then did Long Chen and the others realize that they were in the tower. It was burning with divine light.

“The divine tower has finally been ignited. Our lives are saved.” Long Chen wiped off some sweat. Their reinforcements had arrived.

A rumbling rang out. As that pair of eyes stared down from the heavens, the world shuddered. After that, the five Devil Eye Water Lilies glowed, their leaves growing explosively and their Undying Qi erupting. Rays of divine light fell from them like swords.

BOOM!

The pair of eyes in the sky then exploded and a figure appeared in front of Long Chen and the others. It was Bai Xiaole’s mother.

Just then, the five Devil Eye Water Lilies attacked at the same time. Millions of rays of divine light shot toward the tower.

BOOM!

At this moment, a resplendent golden light exploded. An ancient, rusty sword scabbard had appeared, and it shattered the combined attacks of all five Devil Eye Water Lilies.

The scabbard was in the hand of a long-haired man. It was Bai Xiaole and Bai Shishi’s father, Bai Zhantang.

“This should be the scabbard of the High Firmament Divine Sword. As expected, they aren’t Divine Lords. They are all Immortal Kings!” thought Long Chen.

“Human race, you are courting death!”

The Devil Eye Water Lilies roared furiously, their bodies growing explosively. Terrifying spatial cracks then appeared around them.

As endless Undying Qi poured out of the cracks, the five Devil Eye Water Lilies grew so large that they covered up the stars.

BOOM!

With the five of them attacking at once, five rays of divine light descended from the heavens. Every single one of those attacks contained the power to destroy heaven and earth. Let alone being struck, even the shockwaves were so powerful that Long Chen felt like he would be instantly wiped out. This was the true power of the Devil Eye Water Lilies.

The next moment, space shuddered and one figure after another appeared. Thirty-six elders had come out of the void.

They sat in the air, forming hand seals. The thirty-six of them then glowed, and all their auras poured in one direction, into the scabbard in Bai Zhantang’s hand.
