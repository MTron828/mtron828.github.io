Chapter 4501 Black Lotus, Yan Xu Flame

That seed in the heavenly gate was a lotus seed, and it looked extremely similar to the lotus seed in Long Chen’s primal chaos space.

However, Long Chen’s lotus seed was golden, and this one was pitch-black with black qi swirling around it. Even through space, he could feel the vast primal chaos aura around it.

Long Chen found that the pillar of light shooting out of the gate to the Esoteric Spirit world behind him had grown brighter after this black seed appeared. Primal chaos qi was gathering from every world gate, and the seed inside the heavenly gate was receiving the nourishment of that energy. It started to germinate, and its form quickly changed. When its first leaf burst out, Long Chen could see what that was.

“It really is a lotus!”

Having personally witnessed the Devil Eye Water Lily’s growth, Long Chen couldn’t help but draw parallels to the lotus leaf before him. However, the lotus leaf’s aura was millions of times stronger.

Despite the immense distance that separated him from the solitary leaf, it exuded a formidable pressure that sent shivers down Long Chen’s spine.

When Long Chen looked at that black lotus seed, countless eyes throughout the world also looked at it.

Some were terrified, and others were excited. After the first leaf appeared, its growth accelerated, and that single leaf grew to the point that it could cover an entire prefecture.

Once this leaf reached a certain size, it stopped growing, and the second leaf appeared. When it emerged, the world started to shake, as it forcibly sucked the primal chaos qi in the world.

Seeing this scene, countless sects started to panic and hastily shut down their formations, especially their primal chaos spirit gathering formations. They found that the primal chaos qi within their spirit stones was undergoing forcible extraction.

Following that, the third, fourth, and fifth leaves appeared. The growth of every heaven-shrouding leaf sucked this world’s primal chaos qi away.

When the ninth leaf appeared, the world seemed to return to the point before the various world gates opened. There was no longer any primal chaos qi around.

The ninth leaf fully absorbed the primal chaos qi from the entire world in just a few breaths, and this terrified countless people.

A black flower bud had appeared on it. When it emerged, there was no further change in this world as the primal chaos qi had been sucked away.

Just then, the various world gates shook. The Esoteric Spirit World’s gate started to crumble, forming a giant channel.

Long Chen observed with his naked eye as exceptionally pure primal chaos qi coalesced into an overwhelming torrent surging out from that channel.

“Not good. I have to return to the academy.”

Long Chen tried to use Xia Chen’s transportation formation here, only to find that it had lost effect.

Without thinking about it, he knew that it had to be connected to the black lotus. Long Chen then summoned his Kunpeng wings and transformed into a streak of light, heading toward the High Firmament Academy.

“I’m a bit slower…”

Long Chen’s heart shook. The fact that his speed was slower meant that the world’s laws were silently changing.

The mysterious black lotus was affecting the entire world. Its nine leaves shrouded the heavens, and the bud unfolded in a gradual blooming process, seemingly in preparation to open the gate to the ninth heaven. However, this gate gave off an ominous aura more reminiscent of a gate to hell.

The lotus consumed the entire world’s primal chaos qi. It was definitely the most terrifying existence that Long Chen had ever encountered in this lifetime.

As the lotus slowly bloomed, the enormous heavenly gate started to twist. Upon closer inspection, Long Chen found that the opening of this gate was a bit strange.

Long Chen passed by countless sects and cities and saw many experts staring at the sky in horror. They felt incomparably minuscule in front of that black lotus, their hearts filled with terror and unease.

When they saw Long Chen fly by, those with sharp eyes recognized the golden Kunpeng wings to be Long Chen’s. After all, Long Chen was the most famous existence within the Darklight Heaven—this generation’s Sage King who had defeated the first awakened Heavenly Doyen.

The Darklight Heaven was now teeming with formidable monsters, rumored to be able to easily slay Long Chen. However, those rumors couldn’t be trusted.

After all, hadn’t Netherdragon Tianzhao also said the same thing, only to be beaten by Long Chen? No matter how powerful those monsters were, as long as they didn’t fight Long Chen, Long Chen was still viewed as an undefeatable battle god.

Just as Long Chen was flying through the air, the black lotus’s bud slowly opened, and black flames appeared inside of it.

“What?!”

Long Chen’s expression completely changed when he saw those black flames.

“That flame is…!”

Long Chen couldn’t believe it. It was Yan Xu Flame, the strongest flame of the nine heavens and ten lands, and it was also one of Long Chen’s mortal enemies.

Long Chen had fought against Yan Xu’s sons and even slain his ninth son. Thus, Long Chen was extremely sensitive toward Yan Xu Flame.

“Is the black lotus related to Yan Xu?” muttered Long Chen. He suddenly had a bad feeling.

Yan Xu Flame was the strongest flame of the nine heavens and ten lands, an existence capable of devouring all the world’s flames. Long Chen had to be careful.

“Big Brother Long Chen, it would be best if I could devour that flame,” Huo Linger expressed with excitement, her voice resonating.

Long Chen felt a stir in his heart. The Yan Xu Flame was renowned as the strongest, capable of devouring all other flames. Yet, Huo Linger possessed the ability to consume any flame as well. The question lingered: who was truly stronger?

A sudden smile crossed Long Chen’s face. As expected, the concept of everlasting supremacy was nonexistent. All things had their own banes. Perhaps Huo Linger was the bane of the Yan Xu Flame? That wasn’t beyond the realm of possibility.

With Huo Linger by his side, Long Chen felt a surge of confidence. Now, as he gazed at the formidable flame in the sky, his vigilance transformed into greed.

If Huo Linger could absorb it, then who cared about Doyens? Who cared about Saints? They would all be juniors in front of him.

Huo Linger expressed her desire to devour the flame, signifying her confidence in possessing the necessary power. The inclination was right; all she lacked was the opportunity.

Hours later, Long Chen returned to the High Firmament Academy, and the black lotus had already fully bloomed.

The lotus rotated, its leaves trembling as primal chaos qi surged toward it. Black flames erupted from the lotus, causing the entire world to contort and twist.

BOOM!

Suddenly, the black lotus blasted the gate apart, leaving everyone dumbfounded. If the gate was blown apart, how could they enter?

The moment the gate exploded, the black lotus also vanished and left behind an enormous black vortex in its stead.

At this moment, Long Chen saw many figures rushing toward that vortex like bolts of lightning.

“Could it be…?” Long Chen was stunned.

“Yes. That is the gate.”

Just then, Bai Letian silently appeared by Long Chen’s side. The Dragonblood Legion, the academy’s disciples, and the Battle God Palace’s disciples walked out of the gate of the academy.Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

“Move out. Enter the heavenly gate and see the original form of this world. The key to changing this world lies within. Children, I wish you good fortune!” Bai Letian looked at Long Chen, Bai Shishi, Bai Xiaole, and the others with a hint of reluctance.

Long Chen knew that his reluctance stemmed from the knowledge that once they entered, many of them might not ever return.

However, they were cultivators. After stepping onto this path, they could no longer retreat. Even if they had to face death, they had to see the real world.

“Move out!”

Long Chen cupped his fists toward Bai Letian. With a wave of his hand, he led everyone toward that enormous vortex.
