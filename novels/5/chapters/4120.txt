Chapter 4109 Golden Lotus Seed Reacts

“Are the preparations complete?” asked Long Chen.

“Boss, don’t worry! Everything is ready!” said Guo Ran confidently.

Long Chen nodded. Just like that, they walked straight through the black gate. Seeing their confidence, Xu Jianxiong and the other Heaven Venerates of the Fullmoon race couldn’t help shaking their heads.

Children were simply children. They were always impatient, as they didn’t know just how terrifying the world was.

At this moment, Xu Changchuan was following Long Chen and the others, and his excitement far surpassed his nervousness. Xu Jianxiong and the others also sighed over that. It must be nice to be young.

Unfortunately, elders like them had experienced so much that they could no longer return to their young and arrogant selves. The passage of time had transformed them, making them old and afraid as they had experienced so much pain in their lives.

“Everything is prepared. If the situation worsens, we can immediately withdraw. Most important of all is to guarantee Long Chen’s safety,” transmitted Xu Jianxiong to the rest of the Fullmoon race’s experts.

Long Chen was their hope of rising. Even if they died, they had to protect him.

The reason they were willing to bring Long Chen and his companions here was to let Long Chen see reality and dampen his sharp drive. After all, youngsters often didn’t have accurate views of reality, and only harsh truth could give them the blow that made them grow up.

However, Xu Jianxiong was worried that this blow would be too great. He hoped that they wouldn’t be too discouraged.

As soon as they passed through the gate, even before they got a good look at the surroundings, countless angry roars rang out, and berserk killing intent flooded down on them from every direction.

“Prepare yourselves!”

Xu Jianxiong sent another warning to everyone. It would be best if they managed to protect everyone. Otherwise, they would lose the face of the Fullmoon race.

“Double Dragon Universe Lock, Yin Yang Heavenly Hegemon Formation!”

Xia Chen instantly tossed out three thousand six hundred formation discs when he stepped into this world. The next moment, a giant screen of light rose.

This half-dome curtain of light had two giant dragons swimming within it. One was black, one was white. With Yin and Yang weaving together, energy poured out of the three thousand six hundred formation discs and into the formation.

Divine light then soared into the heavens, illuminating this dark world. After a moment of observation, they could see that this place was a wild world of desolation. They saw an unending mountain range without a single blade of grass growing.

When the formation lit up, countless creatures came flying toward them from a distance. All of them had powerful auras. With every step they took, the mountains quivered. Their roars were hungry, as if they were wolves that had been starving for countless years and now saw flesh.

“They really are all at the level of Divine Venerates!”Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

The expressions of the Fullmoon experts changed. Although they had long since expected this, seeing the endless tide of powerful dark creatures still shook them.

Although they could only be considered Mortal Venerates by the human race’s standards, they were so numerous that even Heaven Venerates would be drowned by them. When surrounded by monsters that felt no pain nor fear, without support, a Heaven Venerate would still die.

“How long?” asked Long Chen.

“Ten breaths,” answered Xia Chen.

“Alright. We’ll buy you ten breaths’ time.”

Xia Chen’s formation would take ten breaths’ time to reach its strongest state. However, during this time, it couldn’t receive any intense blows.

“Uncle Tree, Uncle Xiong, help us hold the line here. You don’t need to attack, but if any Heaven Venerate creatures descend, we might need your help to accurately kill them. Thank you!” After saying that, Long Chen charged out.

The Dragonblood warriors also flew out, and only Xia Chen and Guo Ran remained behind. Xia Chen was busy with the formation, while Guo Ran busied himself with setting up a platform. He was exceptionally busy, but no one knew what he was doing.

“What about me?” Xu Changchuan was dumbfounded. Everyone else had gone out, but he was still stuck here. It was like Long Chen had forgotten about him.

“Just watch safely!” said Xu Jianxiong.

“Race leader, we…” said a Heaven Venerate.

“Just do as Long Chen says. Be ready to assist him at any moment,” ordered Xu Jianxiong. Looking at Long Chen and his companions’ practiced formation and their lack of panic, he decided to listen to Long Chen.

Countless dark creatures with black qi coming out of their bodies charged at them like fiends from hell that had been released from prison. Their killing intent exploded, and when they saw Long Chen and the others, their eyes turned blue.

“Split the Heavens 1!”

Long Chen was the fastest, and with a spin, a crescent moon saber-image flew out, extending for thousands of miles before vanishing.

As the saber-image possessed the will to destroy the very heavens, the dark creatures struck by it were directly blown apart as though they were made of paper mache.

With this one attack, countless dark creatures were slain, as it left behind shattered giant mountains in its path. It was such a shocking scene that even Xu Jianxiong was moved.

“What a domineering will. The chaotic laws are forced to bow their heads.”

What shocked Xu Jianxiong was not how sharp Long Chen’s attack was, but that his attack contained the will to rise above the heavens. According to reason, with the laws in complete chaos, the energy of heaven and earth could not be used by others and would even have a suppressive effect.

However, this attack of Long Chen forced heaven and earth to submit, leaving these creatures unable to pose any resistance. Just like that, they were blasted through like rotting wood.

Of everyone present, only Xu Jianxiong could comprehend the attack. The other Fullmoon experts saw it but didn’t comprehend this point. They thought that Long Chen’s power was simply so great as it could force its way through the chaotic laws and suppress the dark domain.

The Heaven Venerates were all stunned. The divine might of this saber was something even they, as Heaven Venerates, were unable to replicate. Just what was going on?

“Eh?”

After that one blow, Long Chen suddenly sensed the golden lotus seed in the primal chaos space quiver ever so slightly.

When he focused on it, he saw that the golden lotus seed, which had turned listless after destroying the Yan Xu Gate, had now recovered a trace of its luster.

Nonetheless, this trace of light was extremely weak. Its aura seemed to have strengthened slightly, yet also remained unchanged. Long Chen didn’t know if it was a misperception on his part.

“Will killing these dark creatures let it recover faster?” Long Chen had an amazing thought. If this was true, he would really have struck gold. “I’ll know after I try it out!”

Suddenly, Long Chen put away the Minghong Saber and raised his hand, summoning a giant flame lotus on it. After that, sacred chanting rang throughout the world.

The flame lotus rapidly grew, covering the sky in the blink of an eye. As a result, wild flames ignited the dome of the heavens.

“World Extermination Flame Lotus!”

When the giant flame lotus shot out, it directly smashed into the tide of dark creatures charging over.
