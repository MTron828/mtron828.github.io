Chapter 4428 Collectively Coming Out of Seclusion

Heavenly Fiend Prefecture, Life End Mountain, Dragon Extinction Ridge.

Located in the remote southwestern region of the Darklight Heaven, this place was a desolate wasteland seldom frequented by people.

According to ancient tales, an apocalyptic battle unfolded here in the primal chaos era, leaving the area teeming with the burial sites of countless fiends. Due to the pervasive contamination from their corpses, the land became inhospitable for cultivators.

However, all of a sudden, this once-forgotten place captured the attention of the entire world, all thanks to a single challenge letter.

The one issuing the challenge, Netherdragon Tianzhao, was the strongest heavenly genius of the nether dragon race. As the first Heavenly Doyen of this generation, he achieved a milestone unparalleled in this era. So it was no wonder people would be curious of him.

While there were rumors of budding Heavenly Doyens making breakthroughs in the various worlds, up until now, no one had publicly acclaimed that they made this final breakthrough.Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

Heavenly Doyens, recognized as the representatives of the will of the Heavenly Daos, stood as unmatched existences in this world. They were regarded as experts with limitless prospects.

Although countless people had heard of how terrifying Heavenly Doyens were, no one had seen one yet. Brimming with curiosity to verify the legend, many of them were attracted to this region.

However, many people found it strange as well. Why did a Heavenly Doyen challenge someone who wasn’t even a Supreme? This curiosity caused countless people to gather information on Long Chen. At the same time, information from beyond this heaven finally reached the Darklight Heaven. In particular, the information about Long Chen came from the Nirvana Overflow Heaven.

“Sage King?! Long Chen is this era’s Sage King?!”

When they received this information, people finally understood why a Doyen like Netherdragon Tianzhao would challenge someone like Long Chen to a battle.

A Sage King was this world’s strongest heavenly genius. Even if Long Chen hadn’t killed Netherdragon Tianye, Netherdragon Tianzhao still had to challenge Long Chen if he wanted to be the best.

The two of them were the strongest heavenly geniuses of their worlds. If they encountered each other, there would definitely be a fierce battle—a competition between two races.

After a while, more information regarding Long Chen’s actions in the Nirvana Overflow Heaven reached the crowd. When they learned that Long Chen had directly led people to destroy the Great Desolate World and even fought against a Saint of the humanless world, they were completely stunned.

Even if that Saint was in its weakest state following its recent advancement, Long Chen still managed to destroy its head in its own world. This feat was absolutely shocking.

Originally, they had thought that Netherdragon Tianzhao only challenged Long Chen as an excuse to test the High Firmament Academy’s stance. As a result, most of these experts had assumed that Long Chen wouldn’t be a match for Netherdragon Tianzhao.

After realizing that Long Chen was also a terrifying monster, they knew that the battle between the two of them would be spectacular.

Upon receiving the challenge letter, Long Chen publicly announced the time and location of the fight. As a result, countless experts immediately rushed to the Heavenly Fiend Prefecture.

In just seven days—a mere flicker of time for most experts—they would engage in combat. Fearing to miss this historic battle, some factions mobilized their full forces to personally witness the clash between a Heavenly Doyen and the reigning Sage King.

Everyone wanted to see who was stronger: the reigning Sage King or a Heavenly Doyen. Did Long Chen really represent the human race’s greatest power?

Just as the outside world was going crazy, the High Firmament Academy was quiet. Everyone from the Dragonblood Legion was in seclusion, advancing rapidly.

Long Chen was also digesting the leftover medicinal energy, bringing himself to his top condition. As time passed, seven days later, he emerged from seclusion.

His cultivation base had undergone another breakthrough, reaching the fifth Heavenstage. By now, Long Chen had absorbed nearly all of the medicinal energy from the Sacred Light Snow Lotus Pill.

Although Long Chen's seclusion was quite short this time, it was enough for him. The Sacred Light Snow Lotus Pill had no side effects, solidly raising his realm.

After coming out of seclusion, Long Chen felt incredibly refreshed and powerful. Now, he had the utmost confidence in himself.

“Boss!”

When Long Chen emerged, he found that the Dragonblood Legion was waiting for him, along with Yu Qingxuan, Bai Shishi, Bai Xiaole, and the others.

“Damn, your advancement rate is amazing!” Long Chen found that Gu Yang, Li Qi, Song Mingyuan, Yue Zifeng, Guo Ran, Xia Chen, Bai Shishi, Bai Xiaole, and the others had reached the seventh Heavenstage. Now, they were all late stage World Kings.

“It’s all thanks to Big Sister Qingxuan’s medicinal pills. I feel that advancing through the World King realm is even easier than the Immortal King realm,” said Bai Shishi. She stood beside Yu Qingxuan, nodding to her gratefully.

After all, Yu Qingxuan’s medicinal pills were all top-grade golden pills with shocking effects, and along with the primal chaos qi eruption, her skills also advanced. This period really marked an era of heavenly geniuses erupting with power.

Since that was the case, not only the Dragonblood Legion but all cultivators also advanced like there was no tomorrow. Overall, the difficulty of breaking through bottlenecks had fallen.

“Boss, take a look. What do you think of my new battle armor?” Guo Ran waved at Long Chen excitedly.

“These characters…”

Long Chen suddenly focused on the several immortal characters on Guo Ran’s armor. A sense of immense pressure enveloped them—they were Jiuli immortal characters.

Long Chen had seen second-generation Jiuli immortal characters before, and they hadn’t given off such terrifying pressure. Hence, Long Chen suspected them to be first-generation Jiuli immortal characters. However, when did Guo Ran gain the ability to inscribe first-generation Jiuli immortal characters?

“Hehe, these are first-generation Jiuli immortal characters! Actually, it’s all thanks to boss. I encountered Li Chenggang of the Calligraphy Sect, and he was really interested in my armor. After that, he directly gave me seven first-generation Jiuli immortal characters and even broke them down for me. When I added them to my battle armor, it was like adding wings to a tiger! Now, I’m not afraid of anyone anymore!” said Guo Ran arrogantly.

Having upgraded his armor and merged first-generation Jiuli immortal characters into it, he was confident to take on any heavenly genius in the same realm.

“Boss, why don’t I fight for you? I’ll put that Netherdragon Tianzhao in his place!” Guo Ran patted his chest confidently.

“You are indeed powerful, but you aren’t there yet. Even I might not be able to kill him,” answered Long Chen.

“What? Boss, are you kidding?”

Guo Ran was shocked. In his heart, his boss was unrivaled, and no one in the same realm could beat him.

Long Chen simply smiled and didn’t reply further. He then turned to everyone. “My duel with Netherdragon Tianzhao might result in a chaotic battle at the end. I’ll warn you once. As soon as someone interferes in our battle, my brother will kill them without hesitation. Dragonblood warriors! Pick out the strongest people. It would be best if you could keep their corpses intact for me.”

The Dragonblood warriors all smiled as they understood what Long Chen wanted.

Long Chen was about to leave when several figures appeared.
