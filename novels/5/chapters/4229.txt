Chapter 4218: Watching as They Die

Guo Ran and the others sighed when they saw those dark creatures. They couldn’t help shaking their heads.

Following that, the scene that they had long since anticipated occurred. Countless disciples who had charged into their ranks were slain by these new dark creatures.

These creatures with silver marks on them were elites amongst dark creatures. Guo Ran and the others were all too familiar with them. Their power was equal to the heavenly geniuses of the human race, around the level of Double Supremes.

Back in the life-forbidden area, even the Dragonblood warriors didn’t dare to be careless against those dark creatures with silver marks.

Currently, there were some silver-marked creatures mixed into the ranks of normal dark creatures, and occasionally one with golden markings would appear. Facing them, the normal experts would naturally be at a disadvantage.

At the start, there weren’t that many elite creatures. But in the blink of an eye, they became the main force.

More and more of the gold-marked creatures appeared. As their claws and teeth were comparable to World Domain divine items, normal experts were unable to pose much of a threat to them.

As more dark creatures appeared, it was like a flood spreading in every direction. In the face of this overwhelming onslaught, countless experts abandoned the fight and hastily turned to flee.

However, fleeing now was a bit too late. Countless experts were directly drowned by the wave of dark creatures and torn apart. Moreover, lifeforms that were slain by these dark creatures couldn’t even escape as Yuan Spirits. They were fully dead.

As for those experts who had left Long Chen’s side, they were still on the edge of the battlefield. Seeing the situation change, they immediately fled.

“Senior apprentice-brother Long Chen, save me!”

A terrified cry rang out, emanating from none other than the person who had been first to leave Long Chen’s camp. Gone was his previous arrogance, replaced by sheer terror as he desperately flew, pursued by an endless swarm of dark creatures behind him.

“I already gave you a chance, but you wasted it. You even brought down so many others with you. In this world, no one owes anyone anything. You didn’t cherish your own life, but you want others to risk their lives to save you? Sorry, but I’m no saint. I can’t do it.” Long Chen shook his head.

“Long Chen, you’re just going to watch as we die?! You… Ah, no!”

The distraction caused his speed to drop, and he was then devoured by the wave of dark creatures, vanishing without a trace. Even his screams were drowned out.

“Prepare for battle. The Dragonblood warriors will be the main attack force. Battle God Palace’s experts, you will assist the attack. Disciples of the Starry River Palace, you will be the wings, switching between offense and defense. Disciples of the academy, provide support wherever you can. As for the others, if you have the power, join the defenses. If you don’t, don’t mess around. Just patiently wait,” said Long Chen. As the flood of dark creatures reached them, his voice was still calm.

The Dragonblood warriors unsheathed their swords the moment Long Chen finished speaking. As a result, the flood of dark creatures seemed to crash into a giant wall. Their initial assault was completely obliterated.

With just one move, the wave crashing toward them was stopped. Furthermore, it was done easily, as if it took no effort at all, shocking all the onlookers.

The Battle God Palace’s disciples were originally a bit unhappy to be relegated to a supporting role. After all, they were all war-like fighters, extremely confident in their own power. However, after seeing the Dragonblood warriors unleash this one attack, they were completely convinced.

The most frightening thing wasn't the fact that just over two thousand individuals managed to halt such a relentless assault. It was the astonishing unity of their movements. Every bit of their power perfectly harmonized and supported each other, creating a profound force that shocked everyone.

Perhaps if it was just two people attacking together, it was understandable. But for two thousand people to have such a level of cooperation? It was unheard of.

“Kill!”

After a brief moment of shock, the Battle God Palace’s disciples began to attack the straggling creatures. Meanwhile, the Starry River Sect’s disciples summoned their manifestations, causing starry rivers to surge forth. Their killing power was also astonishing. These dark creatures were annihilated as soon as they got close.

The Starry River Sect’s disciples were surrounded by stars, their auras astonishing. To everyone’s surprise, their manifestations could actually link together and support each other. It was like they were one enormous star formation.

With the charge stopped, the threat of these dark creatures plummeted. The academy’s disciples didn’t even need to step up, let alone the other disciples. They just silently watched.

“Long Chen, what do you think?”

Meng Qi stood beside Long Chen, staring at the passageway leading above the heavens where endless dark creatures continued to descend. Her gaze was a bit grave.

“Naturally, I think best with you by my side,” said Long Chen.

Meng Qi smiled and shook her head, her smile melting Long Chen’s heart. Regrettably, there were too many people around for him to steal a kiss from her.

Seeing him looking at her like that, Meng Qi blushed, but she was happy. After being apart for so long, they had finally reunited.

The crowd left no room for her to have a private conversation with Long Chen; there was no chance to express their emotions. Nevertheless, Long Chen’s familiar gaze, the same as when they had first met in the Phoenix Cry Empire, warmed her heart.

She could feel that Long Chen’s love for her had not diminished in the slightest. However, Meng Qi didn’t dare to express it here, so she scolded, “I was asking what you think about the dark creatures!”

“Why would I want to think about them? With so many of my beautiful wives around me, I’m totally captivated by you all. I can’t even get enough of looking at each of you, so why would I look at them?” said Long Chen in a voice only those closest to him could hear.

They all blushed. This praise was far too blatant, but they also knew that it was intentional.

“Don’t mess around. At this critical time, you should be a bit more serious,” rebuked Meng Qi.

Long Chen nodded. It truly wasn’t the time for jokes.

Hence, Long Chen’s expression turned serious. As he looked at the spatial channel, he said, “This time, the Sage King Convention is extremely off. The rules have all changed. Now, it’s like a poison jar, and we’re the bugs. I thought the title of Sage King would be given to the last poisonous bugs alive. In other words, the only way to win is to kill all others. It’s clearly a trap set up to kill us all. But now, even these dark creatures have appeared, so my original theory no longer works. It seems that there is another trap in this generation’s Sage King Convention.”

“What do you think that trap is? Or what is the goal?” asked Meng Qi.

Long Chen shook his head. Just as he was about to say something else, his expression changed. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

“Guo Ran, kill them!”
