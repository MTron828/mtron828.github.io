Chapter 5054 Slaughtering Dragons


“Defend the Ten Thousand Dragon Nest!” Bai Yingxue shouted. 

The white dragon race’s experts poured out, instantly forming a solid defense around the core of their Ten Thousand Dragon Nest, which consisted of three inner layers and three outer layers.

As long as they properly defended those areas, even a three-vein Heaven Saint would have a hard time damaging the Ten Thousand Dragon Nest.

Meanwhile, the three-vein Heaven Saints of the Netherdragon race were enraged by the crippling of their nest, so they harnessed its power and launched a furious counterattack. But Bai Yingxuan could still suppress them completely. However, by holding her down, they prevented her from helping her disciples.

“Kill!” the Netherdragon experts roared. The crippling of their nest was a devastating blow to them, fueling their fury as they attacked relentlessly, wanting to tear apart the white dragon race.

Just as the white dragon race took a position of absolute defense, one figure charged into the Netherdragon race’s army.

“Long—” Bai Yingxue cried out. When she remembered that Long Chen was hiding his identity, she shut her mouth.

The white dragon race was formidable, especially in their ability to work together. With the Dragon Guard on the offense and the Dragon Inheritance on defense, they showcased impressive killing power while sustaining minimal casualties. They quickly formed a formation to maintain their absolute advantage. 

However, Long Chen didn’t join them and charged out alone. Seeing him lunging forward, Bai Yingxue felt anxious. Although she knew that Long Chen was powerful, was he not just throwing himself to his death like this?

After all, the opposing army possessed over thirty two-vein Heaven Saints, close to a hundred one-vein Heaven Saints, and around fifty Heavenly Chosens. In terms of sheer numbers, the Netherdragon race was actually slightly stronger than them.

As Long Chen charged into their midst solo, the white dragon race’s side let out startled cries. Many did not know him well, but since he had joined them, they considered him one of their own. But now there was no chance for them to save him.

“Where did this idiot come from?! Die!” a Heavenly Chosen of the Netherdragon race roared, summoning his Heavenly Fate Disk as a powerful fist hurtled toward Long Chen.

“Scarlet Dragon Battle Armor!” Long Chen called forth his dragon scales, his Blood Qi erupting. Against these countless experts, he didn’t dare to be careless and immediately summoned his Dragon Blood Battle Armor.

When a cross appeared in Long Chen’s palm, the Earth Cauldron’s voice echoed in his mind. “Hold back a bit. Don’t waste your energy, so use as little as you can.”

Long Chen’s palm collided with the Heavenly Chosen’s fist. 

BOOM!

With an explosive sound, the Heavenly Chosen’s fist was blasted to bits.

“What?!”

This time, even Long Chen jumped in shock. This expert’s aura and Blood Qi were so potent, surpassing those of Zhao Qingtian and Ye Lingxiao. Yet, Long Chen’s light attack blew him apart effortlessly, leaving Long Chen baffled by how weak he truly was.

“Your attack is called the Sovereign Blood Seal - God Slaying Cross. It differs from other God Slaying Crosses. Moreover, the Sovereign blood has a natural suppressive effect on the dragon race. If you used your violet blood or seven-color Supreme Blood, you would have to use much more energy to kill them. But with the Sovereign Blood Seal, they are nothing more than ants,” explained the Earth Cauldron.

Now, Long Chen understood. It made sense that such a strong expert couldn’t resist his attack; he was completely suppressed. The defenses of his physical body were as fragile as paper against the Sovereign Blood Seal.

Long Chen’s attack shocked everyone, including those two three-vein Heaven Saints fighting Bai Yingxuan.Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“That power… Could it be…?”

Just then, a dragon spear shot toward Long Chen like lightning. He was about to dodge when the Earth Cauldron’s words echoed in his mind. “Don’t dodge. Use the Sovereign Blood Seal to block it.”

With a thought, Long Chen raised his hand and summoned a cross rune again. As he grasped the spear, the power of the Sovereign Blood Seal erupted. While the spear was fine, the two-vein Heaven Saint wielding it exploded into a mist of blood.

Damn, isn’t this cheating?

Long Chen’s eyes almost popped out of their sockets. This Sovereign Blood Seal’s suppressive effect on the dragon race was absurd. One touch meant one death.

“It truly is like cheating to use it against the Netherdragon race. Because of their betrayal, they have been cursed by the Sovereign Blood Seal, so its effect is a hundred times greater on them. However, this technique won’t be so effective against the white dragon race. Well, what I’m saying is that your chance has come. Act as wantonly as you please!” said the Earth Cauldron.

If the suppression was that vicious, what did Long Chen have to fear?

Feeling arrogant, Long Chen charged straight toward the shocked Netherdragon experts.

“Those who block me will die!” shouted Long Chen, his fists randomly striking them.

Like a phantom, Long Chen shot through their midst, targeting the two-vein Heaven Saints and Heavenly Chosens. Every palm strike was fatal, and he never needed to use a second attack.

As long as the slightest bit of the Sovereign Blood Seal’s power touched the Netherdragon experts, they would instantly explode. This quickly turned into a slaughter.

Whether they used their weapons or their bodies to block Long Chen’s touch, they would die. The Netherdragon race was instantly thrown into chaos, scattering like chickens. In but an instant, over ten two-vein Heaven Saints and twenty Heavenly Chosens were dead.

They quickly realized that Long Chen was targeting the strongest experts, so those experts hastily fled in terror. However, since this army of hundreds of thousands of people was in chaos, there was nowhere for them to retreat to.

Furthermore, Long Chen was like a phantom. Amidst the chaos, he moved freely, like the wind and lightning. Every flash brought down the life of a top expert.

The entire Netherdragon army collapsed because of Long Chen. No one knew who shouted “retreat” first, but the word suddenly echoed on all sides, and they withdrew. In the end, their courage dissipated before they could reach the white dragon race’s Ten Thousand Dragon Nest.

Bai Yingxue and the rest of the white dragon race were still stunned. All on his own, Long Chen had crushed the Netherdragon race’s army.

“Hey, wait! You dropped some money!” Long Chen shouted, chasing after them.
