Chapter 4029 Insidious SchemeUpd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

With a few flaps of his wings, Long Chen instantly reached his max speed, feeling full of anxiety.

“What a sinister scheme. They aren’t planning on devouring the Vermilion Bird Empire but completely wiping it out. When the Nether River Sacrificial Ceremony is complete, the spatial gate will open, and the Nether River’s water will flood into the Vermilion Bird Empire. This water is toxic, filled with endless resentment, so wherever the water goes, all life is extinguished. How would they benefit from that? Are they going to pay such a huge price just to erase the Vermilion Bird Empire?”

Long Chen could not comprehend why the Violet Thunderclap Empire would do such a thing.

This was clearly a big chunk of meat that they were going to destroy without taking a single bite. It made no sense for Long Chen.

From the memories of Weng Tianyao’s master, Long Chen saw their plan—an altar for the Nether River Sacrificial Ceremony had secretly been constructed in the city bordering the Vermilion Bird Empire. This city served as the stronghold for the empire's traitors, attracting countless renegades and individuals who had chosen to abandon their allegiance to the empire.

Before launching their assault, the eight empires had announced that they were only targeting the imperial family, not indiscriminately killing commoners. Hence, they intentionally carved out a non-combatant area, which was precisely the grounds of the ceremony.

Unaware of the impending death trap that awaited them, the traitors continued to gather others in hopes of earning the favor of the eight empires.

As Long Chen slew Weng Tianyao’s master, the ceremony promptly commenced. The grand formation activated, and in an instant, black flames consumed the entire city.

The black flames that engulfed the city were the fiendish flames of hell, and those sacrificial lambs could only meet their demise after suffering endless pain.

“AHH! What’s going on?!”

“What are these flames?!”

“No! I don’t want to die!”

“It’s a trap! They’re killing us!”

“Heavens, is this the Vermilion Bird God’s punishment for betraying the empire?”

Countless experts wept as they tried to flee. But the moment they left the city, they were shocked to find a black barrier in front of them.

No matter how they charged at it, they were forced back by a terrifying force. Meanwhile, the flames on their bodies grew, and no one could extinguish them.

“No!”

Amidst the chaos, cries of despair echoed through the air as millions of experts found themselves trapped within the flames, enduring excruciating pain. The hellish flames mercilessly consumed their bodies, souls, and Yuan Spirits, prolonging their suffering rather than granting them a swift end.

As their lives were slowly extracted by the formation, the feeling of regret, hatred, and unwillingness lingered in the air. This endless resentment was then absorbed by the formation.

The next moment, the image of a gate gradually appeared in the sky. It seemed to have the design of a flower on it, but it was too indistinct to see it clearly.

As time passed, more and more resentment was absorbed by the gate, and the gate slowly lit up.

“Not good! The sacrifice is already starting!”

While rushing over, Long Chen sensed those horrifying fluctuations and grew even more anxious.

BOOM!

Suddenly, Long Chen was struck by a ray of divine light, resembling two shooting stars perfectly crashing into each other.

The impact sent Long Chen tumbling backward, his Blood Qi flipping inside of him, and stars spinning in his eyes. He almost coughed up blood.

When the divine light scattered, Long Chen saw an enormous figure which caused his pupils to shrink in astonishment.

“Long Chen, I will repay the enmity of cutting off my wings a hundredfold today!” The enormous figure vanished, replaced by a man exploding with killing intent.

“Kun Tu!”

Long Chen hadn’t expected Kun Tu to actually come. Most shocking of all, his Blood Qi was so powerful that it didn’t seem the slightest bit weaker than Long Chen’s.

After sensing his aura, Long Chen suddenly realized that Kun Tu had become a World King. Just how was that possible? It had only been a short time since they had last met. How could he advance to the World King realm so quickly?

With the World King Divine Radiance behind his head, his Blood Qi shook the surrounding space, causing ripples of death to spread. An enormous Kunpeng image then appeared behind him.

The current him was like the master of the world, his gaze exuding such power that others dared not meet his eyes. As he stood there, his icy killing intent bore down upon Long Chen like an unyielding force. As for his eyes, they glowed with golden runes, as if on the brink of bursting into flames at any given moment.

Through gritted teeth, Kun Tu vowed, "Long Chen, I will tear your corpse apart today!" His intense hatred for Long Chen was palpable. Merely seeing Long Chen already brought forth a surge of animosity from deep inside him.

“I don’t have time for you. Scram!” Long Chen’s Kunpeng wings flapped, and he shot at Kun Tu like a bolt of lightning.

In front of Kun Tu who had become a World King, Long Chen wasn’t the slightest bit afraid. He simply stamped a foot at him.

“Die!” With a resounding roar, Kun Tu unleashed a powerful punch, determined to strike Long Chen.

Yet, to his surprise, Long Chen's attack was a clever feint. In a swift motion, Long Chen's Kunpeng wings flapped, propelling him high above Kun Tu's head, and he swiftly made his escape.

After all, the gates of hell had been opened and Long Chen had to stop it. Otherwise, everything would be over.

“Bastard, where do you think you’re going?!”

Feeling enraged, Kun Tu transformed into a giant Kunpeng, and countless runes flowed on top of his wings. He then shot after Long Chen like a shooting star.

What shocked Long Chen was that after becoming a World King, Kun Tu’s wings were completely different. Many of the runes that appeared on his wings were different from Long Chen’s wings.

Furthermore, his speed was actually greater than Long Chen’s. Although Long Chen flew away first, Kun Tu already caught up to him in just a few breaths’ time.

As Kun Tu closed in on him, Long Chen swiftly swung his saber out. In response, Kun Tu folded his wings and met Long Chen's attack head-on. The collision sent powerful shockwaves rippling in all directions. As a result, Kun Tu's body staggered backward, coming to a halt, while Long Chen skillfully harnessed the force of the impact to maintain his flight.

“Coward! If you have guts, fight me properly!” roared Kun Tu, chasing after Long Chen once more.

Undeterred by Kun Tu's pursuit, Long Chen pressed on, propelling himself forward at full speed. As Kun Tu was closing in on him once more, Long Chen's keen eyes spotted a black barrier looming ahead.

Countless people were screaming in pain inside of the black barrier. As the black flames burned, black threads slowly floated into the sky.

At this moment, Long Chen saw a black spatial gate slowly condensing in the sky, having a strange design on it. Long Chen actually felt that the design was slightly similar, however, he was unable to recall where he had seen it before.

When Long Chen saw that the barrier was still present, he was relieved. So, he was still on time. If the spatial gate was not fully condensed, there was still a chance to stop it.

As Long Chen prepared to charge toward the barrier and shatter it, the space in front of him suddenly distorted and warped.

The next moment, he found himself confronted by the Kunpeng race’s patriarch, as well as the Alldevil race’s old monsters, the Netherworld’s experts, and even the Nine Underworld Hall’s master, Liao Bencang.

All the experts that had fought Xia Guhong in the Violet Flame Heaven Capital had appeared. Moreover, as Long Chen had killed almost all their disciples, the moment they saw Long Chen, their eyes turned scarlet.

“You bastard of the human race, return my people’s lives!”

One of the devil race’s elders roared and was the first to charge out.

“Let’s settle things today!” Seeing all these powerful experts, Long Chen showed no hint of fear. Instead, his blood was set ablaze with battle intent.

“Dragon King Battle Armor!”
