Chapter 3231 Descending Upon the Sheng Prefecture

When the craftsmen saw Long Chen take out a branch of wood that was three feet thick and three hundred miles long, they were completely dumbfounded. The arrows that they crafted were always made of high quality metal, not wood.

However, when they examined this wood, they found that it was harder than metal, causing them to jump.

Even Luo Changwu was stunned. Although he had read many books, he didn’t recognize this wood. He had never seen such tough wood.

This piece of wood was actually only from a branch. If it was the trunk, then it would be even tougher. But Long Chen was unwilling to sacrifice a Wood Foundation Divine Tree. This branch was already enough to make hundreds of thousands of arrows.

However, this wood was so tough that turning them into arrows would take quite a bit of labor. Long Chen definitely couldn’t afford to waste so much time on that.

Fortunately, these craftsmen were very capable. They quickly found suitable tools to fletch the wood, turning this branch into as many arrows as possible while wasting as little as they could.

When the first arrow was done, Long Chen took out his bow and shot the arrow. It instantly vanished, and an explosion occurred in the distance. It had struck a thick metal shield, blasting it apart.

“What a sharp arrow!” exclaimed Luo Changwu. It was his first time seeing an arrow with such terrifying power.

Most importantly, it vanished from sight as soon as it left the bowstring and didn’t make any sound. It was as if it had merged into space, becoming impossible to track.

“This still isn’t too great. If it was a wood element expert who shot it, it would be even sharper, and the arrow would contain their wood energy. That energy will instantly explode when the arrow strikes its target. Even if the opponent is another wood cultivator, they won’t necessarily be able to block it,” said Long Chen with a smile.

Of course, these arrows were extraordinary. They were from a branch of the Wood Foundation Divine Tree and contained powerful wood energy.

Hearing that, Luo Changwu immediately found some wood element experts. Long Chen was surprised that they actually used a human target to test it. At this moment, an arrow was shot into the shoulder of a Divine Lord.

As a result, that Divine Lord’s body instantly stiffened. His body became covered in a bark-like pattern, and he was unable to move.

When the arrow was plucked out, the wood cultivators tried to heal him. They then spent a full hour working on him before he was fully recovered. This terrifying arrow shocked and delighted the Luo family’s experts.

“Martial-uncle, you should gather three hundred wood element archers. Even if they aren’t that skilled in archery, in a large-scale battle, they can close their eyes and randomly shoot, and they’ll still hit a few. These archers will be what we use for our sneak attack. After they’re done, we’ll retreat. Their power doesn’t really matter as long as they can shoot,” said Long Chen.

“That’s no problem. With our years of fighting the sea demons, almost everyone in the Luo family has practiced their archery. Although they’re not necessarily divine archers, they have some skill in this regard. Picking out three hundred elites will be no problem,” said Luo Changwu confidently.

Long Chen had already handed him the pills. This was Luo Changwu’s first time seeing a giant treasure pill. After being nourished by Lei Linger, these pills had almost no flaws at all. Just by holding them in his hand, Luo Changwu felt his violet blood starting to surge. The power of these pills was terrifying.

Originally, he was still a bit worried. But these arrows and pills made him fully confident. With these arrows, Four Peak disciples could easily slay Divine Lords.

After three days of preparation, they were ready to leave. Qin Feng, Bai Xiaole, and Xu Zixiong also came with them. After the tempering of the Honing Heavenly Staircase, it was as if they had been transformed. Xu Zixiong in particular appeared different. His gaze was sharper.

Luo Changwu led a group of the Luo family’s experts along with three hundred elite archers. Luo Bing, Luo Ning, Luo Xue, and Luo Qing were also present. The Luo family didn’t intend on hiding them.

After gathering, they secretly went through a transportation formation. When they came out, there were already people waiting for them.

“Greetings, Uncle Wen.” Long Chen hastily bowed toward the head of this group.

This person looked very similar to Luo Changwu, but he appeared even steadier than him. He was Long Chen’s uncle, Luo Changwen.

“Changwu has already told me about your matters. We are one family, so I won’t say any overly courteous words. Since the idea was proposed by you, you will lead this sneak attack. The two of us brothers will follow you,” said Luo Changwen with a smile.

“Uncle Wen, since you already said that, I won’t stand on courtesy, haha. To tell the truth, if you’re going to listen to me, I feel a bit more assured.” Long Chen laughed. This sneak attack naturally must be led by Long Chen, or it could easily fall into chaos. If Luo Changwen was also willing, Long Chen would naturally take over that privilege.

Luo Changwen and Luo Changwu laughed along. They did like this character of Long Chen’s. It was simple and direct. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

“This place is where the Ying Prefecture connects to the Sheng Prefecture. It is also the only path from the Ying Prefecture to the Sheng Prefecture. There are countless experts gathering on the other side. They seemed to be waiting to gather enough forces to attack us. If we want to pass, we will definitely disturb them,” said Luo Changwen.

The Ying Prefecture was almost an island surrounded by the devil sea. It bordered the Sheng Prefecture, but their relationship wasn’t very good, so naturally there were no direct transportation formations between them.

There was simply this mountain range connecting the two. Thus, when the Sheng Prefecture’s experts began to gather here, the Ying Prefecture’s people would naturally notice.

While the Luo family allowed for peaceful coexistence between the various forces within the Ying Prefecture, the Chu family in the Sheng Prefecture claimed the land for themselves. When they became the boss of this place, they began expelling outsiders and adding Lord Brahma’s followers to their territory. With such a powerful backer, they quickly became the only force within the Sheng Prefecture.

Although there were countless sects in the Sheng Prefecture, they all had to listen to the Chu family’s orders. This was a display of the Chu family’s dominance. Considering that the forces of the entire prefecture belonged to them, the Luo family was unable to obtain any advantage over them. Even after so many years, they were in a stalemate.

“Since it’s a sneak attack, we naturally won't charge over and alert them. We are sneak attacking the Chu family, not the Sheng Prefecture. Pulling the carpet out from somebody is the true King Dao,” said Long Chen mischievously.

“Sneak attacking the Chu family?” Luo Changwen was startled. He then looked at Luo Changwu because this brother of his had said that they were organizing an expedition to get a closer look at the Chu family’s movements.

Luo Changwu simply shrugged, indicating his own innocence. Long Chen had said that it was a sneak attack, so he had assumed it was an attack on the Sheng Prefecture’s experts in order to draw out the Chu family’s experts. After a brief fight, they would then see what kind of power they had. Long Chen hadn’t said that it was a direct attack on the Chu family. If they were going to go all that way, would it even be a probing blow?

Luo Changwu instantly had a bad feeling. Considering Long Chen’s guts, he had no idea what Long Chen would do. Luo Changwen had even said that they would listen to Long Chen just now. If they were to ask for details at such a point, it would appear rude.

“Don’t worry, we are simply probing them. If their power is fake, we’ll fight. If they do have power, we won’t fight them directly. After all, I, Long Chen, am not fond of taking losses,” said Long Chen.

Thinking of that, this was true. Long Chen was famous within the Heavenly Swell Domain. His intelligence did not lose out to anyone. Now that Long Chen said this, the two of them felt rather bad.

“Xiaole, now is the moment to display your ability,” said Long Chen.

Bai Xiaole’s spirits soared. As he formed hand seals, his eyes glowed. Space twisted around them, and they vanished.
