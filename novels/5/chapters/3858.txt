Chapter 3847 Thousand Illusion Spirit Coffin

The moment this tiny coffin appeared, strange marks appeared on top of it. Those marks were exactly the same as those thirty-six coffins.

Moreover, it wasn’t just the marks. Even the color and texture began to change, and it quickly became a perfect copy of the outer form of those coffins. Even their auras were identical.

“You’re…!” Xia Chen was startled. He didn’t know what Mo Nian wanted to do.

“This is another one of my treasures, like the flying shuttle. The Thousand Illusion Spirit Coffin can mimic the appearance and aura of any coffin. In the past, if I encountered some terrifying lifeform in a tomb, I would just hide inside this coffin, and they would never find me. We’ll hide in this coffin, and Xia Chen, you use a mirror illusion art to replace our figures here. Leave behind some movement scenes to trick others. I trust that this isn’t hard for you, right? Hehe, then we’ll stealthily get close to those coffins. Based on my intuition, there is definitely something big inside, something that can let us become rich moneybags overnight,” said Mo Nian stealthily.

“But boss is still fighting…” Xia Chen was hesitant. For them to secretly open the coffins while his boss was in a bloody battle made him feel uneasy.

“So what? Just who is your boss? He has even more trump cards than me. Furthermore, they’re still in the warm-up phase. Long Chen doesn’t have time to search for treasures, while Yin Changsheng, the Nine Underworld Luocha, Ji Wuming, and Shi Yang are all on guard against each other. They won’t dare to make any moves rashly. Now is our best chance. Come, don’t hesitate. If we miss this chance, we won’t get another,” urged Mo Nian.

Xia Chen still hesitated and looked at Yue Xiaoqian, hoping for her to decide. Neither he nor Guo Ran wanted to make any rash moves.

Yue Xiaoqian looked at Long Chen and nodded. “Right now, Long Chen and Long Aotian are both treating this as a chance to get accustomed to their new power. While it looks intense, there is still some time until they truly reach the point of deciding victory or defeat. Since Mo Nian is so confident, let’s try it. Long Chen is too obsessed right now to think of getting treasures. We’ll have to do it for him.”

Hearing that, Xia Chen stealthily set up the formation. Long Chen and Long Aotian were unleashing a tempest of attacks, and everyone was watching them. Thus, no one noticed their tiny movements.

In truth, at first, Ji Wuming and the others had been paying some attention to Mo Nian and the others. They didn’t want them to get a hand on the treasures first.

However, as the intensity of Long Chen and Long Aotian’s battle rose, as their attacks grew increasingly powerful and sharp, their attention was unconsciously drawn away.

Long Chen was one of their most powerful enemies, and they didn’t know much about his combat skills. Watching him fight would benefit them when they fought him in the future.

Other than that, the main treasure that people cared about was the thirty-six coffins floating in the air. They were in the center, and if anyone got close to them, everyone would see it.

Other than that, Yin Changsheng, the Nine Underworld Luocha, and Shi Yang’s attention wasn’t on Mo Nian and the others. Instead, it was on Ji Wuming, who could control time and space. Only he had the ability to silently take the treasures without anyone being the wiser.

However, even as they glared at him, Ji Wuming was very obedient and didn’t make any moves. He just watched the fight.

Very quickly, there was the slightest spatial change on Xia Chen’s side. Their figures remained where they were, while their actual bodies stealthily entered a coffin.

The figures of Xia Chen and the others that people were seeing were no more than a projection that Xia Chen had set up. It was a recording set to loop. If others didn’t get close, they wouldn’t notice anything.

As for Mo Nian's coffin, it was about the same as his flying shuttle. People could hide within it, and it possessed its own concealing abilities.

Even so, this Thousand Illusion Spirit Coffin didn’t possess any flying abilities. It could only slowly float toward those coffins. Xia Chen and Guo Ran were all tense, afraid of being noticed.

However, they quickly found that their worries were for nothing. Mo Nian had spent all these years grave robbing. He was a master at it. The treasures that he had obtained were things that most people would never even see in all their lifetime.

Although the majority of those treasures were taken by his master, the Immoral Daoist, he wouldn’t touch his disciple’s life-saving trump cards.

After all, Mo Nian was his only disciple and also the heir to the Limitless Palace. No matter how immoral the Immoral Daoist was, he wouldn’t harm his own disciple.

At this moment, the Thousand Illusion Spirit Coffin approached one of the coffins. Everyone’s attention was still on Long Chen and Long Aotian; no one looked at them.

Mo Nian had them stop above the coffin. Following that, the Thousand Illusion Spirit Coffin slowly grew until it covered up this coffin.

From the outside, it didn’t look like anything odd. However, Mo Nian and the others now stood on top of one of the coffins.

This coffin was ten meters long and five meters tall. Standing on it, Guo Ran felt like he might explode at any moment from the terror. It was as though he was standing on top of the head of some monster.

As for Mo Nian, his eyes were shining. He was rubbing the marks on the coffin like he was rubbing the skin of a beautiful woman. That gentleness and single-mindedness was impressive.

Yue Xiaoqian also studied those marks closely. She suddenly said, “These marks appear to be the veins of the red spider lily’s leaves, and the Netherworld’s aura comes from inside. So, this coffin most likely contains some lifeform of the Netherworld.”

Mo Nian praised, “Amazing, truly amazing! You even managed to find this out! Yes, these marks are the veins of the red spider lily’s leaves. The red spider lily is also called the Hell Flower. When the flower blooms, the leaves vanish. When the leaves are born, the flower disappears. It is just like the cycle of life and death, an endless cycle. The flowers represent new life, while the leaves represent death. These veins contain a powerful aura of the Netherworld, so a Netherworld expert should indeed be inside. I’m going to open it. When I do, death qi might instantly pour out. Xia Chen, help me purify it so it doesn’t make a fuss.”

Mo Nian took out a brush, and it had blood-like ink on it. He then began to draw strange marks on the coffin.

He spent a full incense stick’s worth of time drawing before putting away his brush. After that, he sprinkled some powder on the coffin and formed hand seals, muttering something.

It was unknown what he was muttering. It seemed to be a scripture. After a while, the designs that he had just drawn onto the coffin slowly lit up as if coming alive.

Following that, the coffin quivered. With a light sound, the lid slowly opened.

When the slightest crack appeared, a vast aura came erupting out. But when that aura appeared, Mo Nian and the others were dumbfounded.

“Quick!”

Mo Nian quickly cried out. What was coming out was not death qi but pure primal chaos qi!𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com
