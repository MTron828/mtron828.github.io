Chapter 4842 Danger Around Every Corner

“Quick, quick! Give me one of your seats!” Mo Nian jumped. If Long Chen didn’t give him one of the ten spots, he wouldn’t even be able to watch the fight.

Long Chen and Mo Nian hastily took out their tablets, but then they only stared at their tablets.

“How are you supposed to do it?”

“Quick, find Lu Ziqiong!”

Lu Ziqiong had previously given them her seats, but Mo Nian and Long Chen didn’t know how to do it.

Seeing the two of them rushing over, Lu Ziqiong jumped. In truth, she had wanted to remind Long Chen a while ago, but with the two of them in seclusion, she didn’t want to disturb them.

It was only when time was running out that she forced herself to remind the Feather Spirit race about Long Chen's upcoming martial fight. As for Yu Tong and Yu Fei, they had completely forgotten about it until Lu Ziqiong brought it up, causing them to panic and almost cry.

To ensure the seats weren’t wasted, Lu Ziqiong quickly reserved spots for herself, Mo Nian, Yu Tong, Yu Fei, and Lu Ziyu, leaving five seats still available.

“Senior, do you want to come?” asked Long Chen as he looked at the race leader.

The race leader hesitated. “It has been a long time since I’ve left the sacred mountain. If I’m going to go out, it would be nice to take a breather. Can I have the rest of the seats?”

“Of course. No problem,” replied Long Chen directly.

After all, those seats would be wasted if no one used them, and Long Chen didn’t know anyone else in Devil Fall City. Giving them to Lu Chengfeng and the others? Long Chen would rather the seats be wasted.

At first, Long Chen had expected the race leader to give the four seats to the strongest heavenly geniuses among the Feather Spirit race's younger generation. However, to his surprise, the four to come were all elders, their auras cold and gloomy, their eyes containing an intimidating killing intent. They seemed akin to devil owls gliding through the night sky, capable of shaking people to their core with just a glance.

Most terrifying of all, all four of them were formidable Heaven Saints. When Long Chen and Mo Nian saw them, their hearts shook. Their dense killing intent couldn’t be concealed even if they tried.

“I heard that your opponent is the grandson of the Iron Blood Gate’s master. I have invited our Protector Elders to come along so that you won’t feel any pressure,” said the race leader.

“Greetings.” The four of them didn’t bow to the race leader, but they did bow slightly to Long Chen.

“Race Leader...” Long Chen’s heart immediately warmed when he heard that.

The Feather Spirit race was treating him so well, living up to what they had promised him. If he was truly in trouble, they would mobilize their full power to help him.

The race leader even came out with the four Protector Elders to support him, clearly worried about Long Chen being bullied by the Iron Blood Gate.

“Please, there's no need to address me as race leader. Just call me Yu Luo. You are the most important guest of the Feather Spirit race. We may not have much to offer, so please don't take offense,” said Yu Luo sincerely.

“Many thanks for your support, Race Leader Yu Luo. I will forever remember this favor.” Long Chen cupped his fists, extremely moved by their complete trust and full support.

“Then let us move out!” The race leader smiled and gestured with her hand. A large green leaf then gently lifted them up and carried them away from the sacred mountain.

As the leaf flew off, Long Chen noticed a branch beneath them propelling them forward, and it revealed the massive tree atop the Feather Spirit Sacred Mountain.

This tree sent them over and then hovered on Devil Fall City. Countless experts came out of buildings to look at it, and the streets swelled with shocked spectators.

At this moment, the race leader's high bun came undone, allowing her hair to flow freely. This simple change transformed the atmosphere around her entirely.

Once noble, refined, and approachable, she now exuded a heroic aura, a sacredness untouchable by blasphemy, and a certain aloof arrogance that kept people at a distance. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

The race leader explained, “Devil Fall City might seem peaceful on the surface, but there are dark undercurrents at play. Danger lurks around every corner. The four noble families have lusted after the city lord’s position for a long time. To make things worse, the city lord, Xing Wujiang, has no heir. Rumor has it that an incident occurred during his attempt to ascend to a higher realm, leading to his lineage's demise. As a result, the four noble families can no longer sit still. The Violet Palace Sect’s Gao Jianli and the Iron Blood Gate’s Cao Guofeng were the first to start stirring the pot. However, the Yellow Spring Pavilion and Heaven Heart Hall are also not willing to fall behind. They have repeatedly tried to test Xing Wujiang’s stance. The fight for his position might erupt at any moment. If the wind blows a single straw, that might be the straw that breaks the camel’s back. Thus, we must be cautious.”

Hearing this, Long Chen was moved. The race leader didn’t wish Long Chen to become a pawn in this fight, especially not a sacrificial pawn lost in the struggle between these five major factions.

“Long Chen, you don’t have to go through with this... I don’t want you to be used by others. I...” said Lu Ziqiong firmly as she bit her lip, startling Long Chen and the others. Lu Ziyu just looked at her blankly, not understanding the meaning behind those words. However, she vaguely had a bad feeling.

Long Chen looked at her ashamed expression and interrupted her, smiling. “Thank you for your worries. But please don’t keep going.”

Lu Ziqiong couldn’t hold herself back. “The truth is...”

Long Chen placed a hand on her shoulder. “I know, so thank you for your worries. However, in this world, man’s plans cannot beat the plans of the heavens, and the plan of the heavens cannot beat me. I don’t care about other people’s schemes. To live with dignity in this lawless world, I will walk my own path, and anyone who gets in my way will be crushed beneath my feet. That is my Dao. So whether it is in an open or hidden scheme, it’s not an issue for me.”

Feeling the warmth from Long Chen’s hand and hearing his sincere words, Lu Ziqiong teared up. “I’m sorry...”

Reflecting back, she recalled the time of his clash with the Iron Blood Gate's disciples that she had been instructed to intervene. Afterward, she was tasked with extending an invitation to Long Chen's group. Following this, she hadn't received any further instructions, which now struck her as odd.

Now, with the race leader's revelations to Long Chen, Lu Ziqiong realized that she too had been manipulated as part of a larger scheme. If she were to cause Long Chen’s death, she would never be able to feel at peace anymore.

“You have nothing to be sorry about. We’re friends, right?” asked Long Chen.

“That’s right, we’re all friends. Whatever trouble you encounter in the future, you can come to find the two of us,” continued Mo Nian as he patted his chest, feeling a burst of compassion upon seeing Lu Ziqiong’s pitiful appearance.

Just then, the starry clouds appeared in front of them, and they descended upon the star cloud martial stage once more. However, some people blocked their way this time.
