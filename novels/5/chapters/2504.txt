Chapter 2494 Resentful Spirit

Long Chen’s saber slashed through the air. The figure in front of him was just an illusory figure, but their Sword Qi still managed to injure him.

Others could harm him now, but he was unable to harm them. Long Chen felt a chill.

“That is a terrifying expert. The power of his sword is able to pass through the river of time to affect you. However, theoretically, an expert on this level has yet to reach the level of slicing through time. He is most likely from the same era as you or at least somewhat close,” said Evilmoon.

“You’re finally speaking,” said Long Chen. When Yun Tian had revealed his identity, Long Chen had actually been worried about Evilmoon cursing him. After all, its current state was due to Yun Shang. It had immense hatred for Yun Shang.

If Evilmoon wanted to kill Yun Shang’s son to avenge itself, Long Chen would be in a difficult position. But Evilmoon had been silent the entire time, and he didn’t know what it was thinking.

“Who do you think I am to bother with someone from the junior generation? You really underestimated the pride of the dark evil dragon race. If I wanted vengeance I’d get it against Yun Shang himself,” snorted Evilmoon.

Long Chen felt a weight fall off his shoulders. “Then what is going on here?”

“What else? Isn’t it obvious? This Ghost Ship passes through time. Wherever it arrives, experts charge onto it for that strange tower. Everything you’ve seen is just fragments of time. This Ghost Ship might have passed through hundreds of millions of years. Whether it was those lifeforms that you saw or even yourself, you’re all just passing travelers to the Ghost Ship. Perhaps years from now, someone else will step onto the Ghost Ship and see you. There’s nothing curious about it. The Ghost Ships are inexplicable mysteries of the cosmos. Where they come from, where they are going, no one can say for sure. As for being called ships of misfortune, that’s because the people who encounter them are affected by too much karma, and their lives aren’t tough enough to endure it. As for you, you don’t need to worry about this because you already have so much karma implicating you that this addition is nothing,” explained Evilmoon.

“The main thing is that their attacks are able to reach me while I can’t attack them, and I haven’t even reached the core. Aren’t I going to die before getting a chance to add this karma?” Long Chen didn’t really mind the karma.

“There’s nothing you can do about it. The river of time flows from top down. Have you ever seen someone try to fart at someone upwind from them?” said Evilmoon.

“Damn, that comparison is convincing.” Long Chen was speechless, but Evilmoon was correct. He was unable to go back through time to attack these people that might have died countless years ago.

“Stop hesitating. Time is pressing. Just staring at these lifeforms isn’t going to help you much. That tower definitely has something good in it. It’s not like you can go back at this time. If there are no other variables, then it’s entirely up to you whether it’s a good thing or a bad thing. Furthermore, haven’t you noticed? You’ve fully recovered. Your dragon blood energy has returned to its peak. What are you doing being so careful?”

Only now did Long Chen realize that his dragon blood energy, Spiritual Strength, and spiritual yuan had all fully recovered. Even his previous injuries were gone.

“What’s going on?” asked Long Chen.

“Time is in chaos on the Ghost Ship. Every step is hundreds or thousands of years through the river of time. Although it’s not equivalent to you actually experiencing that time, your energy began to recover without you even being aware of it. And you don’t need to worry about your life draining away. I’m not saying you’ll age a hundred years with each step. There are many things about the Ghost Ships that cannot be judged according to common sense. No one can explain them. To sum it up, you can close your eyes and walk forward blindly.” After talking for a while, even Evilmoon started to grow confused with its explanation and decided to give up. It simply urged Long Chen on.

Long Chen felt the powerful spiritual yuan within his body and the vigorous dragon blood. His confidence increased and he pressed onward.

Scenes flew past him as he advanced. However, as countless illusory attacks passed through the air, Long Chen no longer dared to be as careless as before.

When the occasional attack came toward him, he still dodged. Although most of the time that was meaningless, there were two times when the attacks actually did affect him.

The most troublesome thing about those attacks was that he was unable to sense them. He didn’t sense the danger because those attacks were not targeted toward him. It was like arrows raining on the battlefield that occasionally fell on him.

BOOM!

A streak of light was blasted apart by a swing of Long Chen’s saber. Long Chen’s wrist shook and his arm turned numb.

“Damn, these people are quite powerful, huh?” Long Chen was startled. That light had come from an extremely unremarkable figure on the battlefield, but it possessed immense power.

After that, a giant beast opened its mouth and tried to bite Long Chen right as he finished his next step. By the time he realized it was trying to swallow him, he already found himself in its giant mouth.

BOOM!

Evilmoon blasted apart the beast, filling the air with blood.

“Huh?”

This time, Long Chen and Evilmoon were both dumbfounded.

“Didn’t you say that we couldn’t attack them?” asked Long Chen.

“Ah… I don’t know either. Theoretically, they’re nothing more than images from time. They should have long since been wiped out by the river of time. They no longer even exist, so how can they attack us? Is this to say that they’re still alive? So… be careful!” Evilmoon suddenly shouted.

A figure covered in black qi suddenly came charging toward Long Chen’s back along with a sharp bone spear, all without the slightest sound.

This time, Long Chen didn’t need Evilmoon’s warning to sense this lifeform’s existence. He twisted, blocking the spear with his blade. A screech rang out when it stabbed into Evilmoon.

Long Chen reached out to grab the lifeform’s throat, but his hands passed straight through it.

Just as his hand passed through its body, the lifeform became illusory and faded away bizarrely.

“No, these are resentful spirits that should be living in Purgatory. Why would they appear on the Ghost Ship?” exclaimed Evilmoon.

The strange way that this lifeform vanished was truly frightening. It was like an assassin that came and went without the slightest warning.

Long Chen continued onward, gradually getting closer to the tower that all the lifeforms were desperate to reach. This illusory world gradually became real.

He was no longer just a spectator to the battlefield. Instead, various lifeforms were starting to attack him as he passed through their times.

BOOM!

Long Chen’s divine ring appeared behind him, and he slashed one lifeform back with Evilmoon while stabbing a lightning spear behind him.

Another curious lifeform had appeared silently, but when it was pierced by the lightning spear, it let out a wail and dissipated into green smoke.

“Yes, they’re definitely resentful spirits condensed of unyielding hatred. They are a bit similar to Yuan Spirits, but still different. The strange thing is that these resentful spirits are supposed to only be able to exist within special spaces. The only place they can move about freely with their own thoughts is supposed to be Purgatory. This Ghost Ship truly is bizarre. Does this ship also contain the laws of Purgatory?” wondered Evilmoon.

Long Chen didn’t have time to think about it. More and more lifeforms were attacking. With every step, he was facing countless enemies. The further he went, the stronger they grew.

Without killing them, he didn’t dare to take a second step. The instant he switched between worlds, there was a moment of displacement. That moment could be death for him.

Seeing the tower up ahead, Long Chen gritted his teeth. Lightning exploded out of him. With a lightning domain around him, he charged forward.

Within this river of time, those lifeforms were paralyzed by his lightning. He charged all the way to the tower in one go.

When he arrived at the bottom of it, he saw a giant door. It was inscribed with two ancient characters that he didn’t recognize.

Ignoring the characters, he charged into the door with lightning surrounding him. A terrifying pressure crashed down upon him as soon as he entered. At the same time, he saw blinding light coming from in front of him. He didn’t even know how many attacks were coming.

“Split the Heavens 8!”

He had expected that the inside of the tower would be far more dangerous. He immediately unleashed the attack he had been preparing.

BOOM!

Divine light exploded. It was unknown just how many lifeforms were killed in that instant by Long Chen’s attack. But there were still over ten attacks that landed on Long Chen, leaving wounds on him. One ray of Sword Qi in particular pierced through his lower leg.

“Azure Dragon Battle Armor!”

A brilliant dragon roar resounded throughout the tower. With Evilmoon in hand, Long Chen was like a wild gale sweeping through the lifeforms he saw.

The surrounding lifeforms were rapidly killed, but Long Chen was surprised to see the lifeforms quickly reform after being killed.

“Don’t waste time. Climb up to the second floor,” said Evilmoon.

Only now did Long Chen see a giant staircase that seemed to be leading to the next level. He rushed over, but as soon as his foot set onto it, the world around him suddenly changed.
