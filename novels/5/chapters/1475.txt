Chapter 1470 Killing His Way Into the Heaven Suppressing Magic Sect

Translator: BornToBe

The Heaven Suppressing Magic Sect was also one of the three great heavenly sects. It was one of the three strongest sects in the Martial Heaven Continent after the immortal era. Its history was extremely long.

After the last dark era, the three great sects had completely declined. But compared to the Xuantian Dao Sect and the Heaven Splitting Battle Sect, the Heaven Suppressing Magic Sect had lost much less in the dark era.

There were rumors that during the last dark era when everyone else went all-out to face the bloody slaughter, the Heaven Suppressing Magic Sect had secretly held back its true power, acting like a turtle in its shell. That was the only way its inheritance could be preserved perfectly. So amongst the three heavenly sects, it was flourishing the most.

The Heaven Suppressing Magic Sect had always suppressed the Xuantian Dao Sect after the dark era. Practically, everyone on the Martial Heaven Continent felt that the Xuantian Dao Sect had become a convenient punching bag.

However, the truth was that someone in the shadows was secretly directing the Heaven Suppressing Magic Sect to suppress the Xuantian Dao Sect.

The one secretly directing them was Pill Valley. To be more accurate, it was the radical faction within Pill Valley. They were the ones thinking of various strategies to use against existences that refused to submit to Pill Valley.

The Heaven Suppressing Magic Sect’s suppression of the Xuantian Dao Sect was a good example. The Xuantian Dao Sect had declined to the point where they couldn’t retaliate.

There were thousands of years of history involving the Heaven Suppressing Magic Sect bullying the Xuantian Dao Sect. It had become the accepted state of things.

Due to their bullying, the Xuantian Dao Sect had become the laughingstock of the continent. Even many second-rate sects looked down on them.

If they didn’t have their fame as one of the three great heavenly sects, it might be very difficult for them to even recruit disciples. Even so, they were only able to get some ordinary disciples.

When Long Chen had joined the Xuantian Dao Sect, the fact that there had been rank five Celestials joining had delighted the Xuantian Dao Sect. But in the eyes of other sects, they were just garbage and not fit to be seen.

However, after Long Chen had joined the Xuantian Dao Sect, the Xuantian Dao Sect had gone through a heaven-flipping change. Ever since the disciples Ma Xingkong had led over to humiliate the Xuantian Dao Sect had been given a slap in the face by Long Chen, the Xuantian Dao Sect had been filled with new air.

That resounding slap was like a proclamation that the Xuantian Dao Sect was no longer the old Xuantian Dao Sect.

Starting then, the Dragonblood Legion had rapidly risen, growing stronger and more terrifying by the day. In just a few years, they had grown to the point that they shocked the entire continent.

Previously, Long Chen had announced to everyone in front of the Xuantian Dao Sect that the Xuantian Dao Sect was rising. Anyone who dared to block their rise, whether they were man or god, would be eliminated.

The Xuantian Dao Sect had risen rapidly, while the Heaven Splitting Battle Sect was also recovering. It was like a spring breeze was blowing through the branches of two withered trees. These two ancient sects that had been dormant for so long were finally starting to thrum with vitality, and they supported Long Chen.

On the opposite side, the Heaven Suppressing Magic Sect had grown more and more mediocre in comparison. They now no longer dared to challenge the Xuantian Dao Sect. They were constantly worried.

That was because everyone knew of the grievances between them and the Xuantian Dao Sect. If the Xuantian Dao Sect suddenly rose, the Heaven Suppressing Magic Sect wouldn’t have any good days in the foreseeable future.

However, their vice sect master, Ma Xingkong, had been slain in the battle of Devil Spirit Mountain. As for their sect master Qi Yunao, he had been summoned by Pill Valley to charge toward the Xuantian Dao Sect along with the experts from other sects and the ancient races. But instead, they had been viciously slapped in the face and forced to leave dejectedly. After that, the Heaven Suppressing Magic Sect had been completely obedient.

The entire Heaven Suppressing Magic Sect was very reserved, no longer having their old arrogance. Even their disciples were no longer arrogantly looking down on others.

The reason Long Chen knew this was because he had spotted several of the Heaven Suppressing Magic Sect’s disciples.

He was in front of the Heaven Suppressing Magic Sect’s gates. Warm sunlight sprinkled on the ground. Towering mountains covered in mist filled this region. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

There were dozens of disciples standing in front of the gates. They had long since gotten used to this beautiful scene and stood there like wooden statues, not moving.

These disciples were at the Sea Expansion realm and were Celestials. For the Heaven Suppressing Magic Sect to send Sea Expansion Celestials to guard the gate, it could be seen how much stronger they were than the Xuantian Dao Sect. The Xuantian Dao Sect normally had outer sect disciples guarding the gate, and they were only at the Xiantian realm.

Those disciples now saw a black-robed man with a large black saber resting on his shoulder slowly walking up the steps. He was sharply contrasted by the sunlight.

He was walking slowly and calmly, yet each step caused the ground to shake. It was like a giant was walking.

The sunlight caused a halo to appear around him, making it so others couldn’t see his face clearly. This figure was mysterious, yet he also gave off a heavy feeling that made it hard for them to breathe.

“This place is the Heaven Suppressing Magic Sect. Newcomers must state their names!”

Those disciples shook. This black-robed man hadn’t released any of his aura, but they all felt their hair standing on end.

The black-robed man seemed to not hear their words. He continued walking slowly. He was getting closer and closer, and the ground was shaking harder and harder.

His footsteps were like thunder in their ears. Those disciples felt that this person was a fiend from hell slowly approaching them. They could smell the scent of blood and slaughter.

All the disciples suddenly took out their blades. One carefully shouted, “Newcomer, report your name! Otherwise, don’t blame us for activating the grand formation to kill you!”

Yet, the figure still ignored them. He continued walking. As he advanced, the sunlight eventually fell away from his figure.

“Long... Long Chen!”

When the piercing sunlight stopped shining on him, those disciples all saw the young face that had shaken the entire Martial Heaven Continent.

Sword-like eyebrows and starry eyes. It was a handsome face that was worth a second look, but at this time, that face was completely icy. His eyes contained terrifying killing intent.

With Evilmoon on his shoulder, Long Chen slowly advanced. He had black robes and a black saber. He was just like a devil god.

“If you don’t want to die, don’t get in my way.” Long Chen’s footsteps didn’t pause as he slowly raised Evilmoon.

Buzz.

One of the disciples hastily slapped one of the stone pillars beside him. Countless runes gathered in the air into a runic blade that slashed down on Long Chen.

This runic blade was the result of the Heaven Suppressing Magic Sect’s grand formation. It could easily kill Life Star experts.

BANG! A scale-covered fist smashed apart the huge runic blade, and the resulting shockwave killed the disciples guarding the gate.

“I gave you a chance, but you didn’t take it. Don’t blame me.” Long Chen snorted and took a single step forward, vanishing. When he reappeared, he was within the Heaven Suppressing Magic Sect.

Continuous explosive sounds began to ring out, and a huge barrier of light covered the entire Heaven Suppressing Magic Sect. But at this time, Long Chen was already inside.

“Who dares?!” A cold cry rang out. A Life Star expert appeared.

However, Long Chen ignored him. He continued at the same pace, going toward a certain mountain.

The Heaven Suppressing Magic Sect had eighty-one large mountains and forty-nine rivers. The refined mountains and winding rivers made the scenery here exceptionally beautiful.

“Even such beauty couldn’t influence their hearts.” A disdainful expression appeared on Long Chen’s face. He hadn’t expected the Heaven Suppressing Magic Sect to be so beautiful. However, there was no way to describe the Heaven Suppressing Magic Sect as a magical wonderland filled with heroic spirit.

This beautiful scenery had only raised a group of sinister and shameless fellows. This beauty was a waste.

“Long Chen, you dare to barge into my Heaven Suppressing Magic Sect? Haha, your guts are quite big!”

Countless experts began to rush over, and they all saw that it was Long Chen. A Life Star expert sneered at him.

“My guts might be even bigger than you think. Call out Qi Yunao.” Long Chen didn’t even look at that person. He continued advancing, crossing several miles with each step. It looked both slow and fast at the same time.

“Little brute, you’re listed as a wanted criminal throughout the entire Martial Heaven Continent, but you still dare to say such arrogant words?! Since you want to die, I’ll help you out!”

This Life Star expert was the person promoted to the vice sect master position after Ma Xingkong had died. The only reason he had been promoted was thanks to Long Chen. If Ma Xingkong hadn’t died, he never would have had that opportunity to be promoted.

Yet, he didn’t thank Long Chen at all. With a cold smile, he took a single step, seeming to teleport in front of Long Chen.

This was a spatial art, and it was extremely profound. Normally, only a Life Star expert could possibly use such a technique.

When he appeared in front of Long Chen, the runes behind him connected with the grand formation in the air. He sent out a punch at Long Chen.

This punch contained the power of the grand formation. It seemed to come from every direction.

Pow!

He was still sneering when a large hand viciously slapped him across the face and distorted his smile.

The sound shook the sky, and the entire formation trembled. This new vice sect master was slapped flying.

The sound of bones breaking also rang out. The vice sect master’s face had caved in. Beads of blood sprinkled through the air along with some broken bones.

The millions of disciples of the Heaven Suppressing Magic Sect were struck dumb like chickens having heard thunder.

They couldn’t believe their eyes. Their vice sect master, a Life Star expert, someone backed up by their sect’s grand formation, was sent flying by a slap in the face from a disciple of the Xuantian Dao Sect.

This was thanks to the grand formation’s protection. Otherwise, this vice sect master would no longer exist in this world.

At the Jade Core realm, Long Chen almost killed a Life Star expert with a slap. All the experts of the Heaven Suppressing Magic Sect were stunned, unable to move or speak.

“Help me out? Do you really think you’re capable of that? What a huge joke.” Long Chen didn’t even look at the vice sect master. He continued walking forward.

As he advanced, all the experts in front of him fell back.

Even their vice sect master had almost been killed by a slap. They were filled with horror.

“Little brute, you’re too arrogant. This isn’t somewhere you can run rampant. Be suppressed!”

The vice sect master suddenly let out a furious roar and rapidly formed hand seals. The grand protective formation began to quiver.
