Chapter 4270 Grand Yan Emperor, Yan Wudao

BOOM!

With an explosive sound, Long Chen’s saber-image simply exploded, and that yellow-robed elder was completely unscathed. In fact, he didn’t even bat an eye.

“What?!”

Countless people stared at him in shock. It had to be known that Long Chen and Long Aotian’s attacks had reached the point of easily slaying innate Heaven Venerates. However, this person hadn’t done anything at all, simply allowing Long Chen’s attack to land on him.

At the very least, the palace master had used a palm to crush Long Aotian’s Sword Qi. That had been stunning enough to most people, but this yellow-robed elder gave them even more shock.

“That’s the Grand Yan Empire’s emperor, Yan Wudao!” Suddenly, a startled cry rang out from an elderly expert as he recognized this person’s identity.

“Yan Wudao? As in Yan Wuji? Are they brothers?”[1]

“No, they aren’t from the same generation. Yan Wuji is a sealed heavenly genius from long ago, and Yan Wudao is the current emperor of the Grand Yan. The reason they have the same Wu character in their name is because in the Grand Yan’s inheritance, the Wu character appears every thirty-six generations,” said that elder.

“Palace master, it seems that he’s here for you.” Bai Zhantang eyed Yan Wudao solemnly. This was a terrifying figure.ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

But as always, the palace master was expressionless and just glanced at Yan Wudao indifferently.

BOOM!

Just as everyone was shocked by Yan Wudao’s display, explosive sounds on the martial stage drew their attention once more. The entire barrier was already filled with holes, but in the end, it hadn’t completely fallen. Despite looking to be on the verge of collapse, it still stood. As Long Chen and Long Aotian continued their battle, violent waves of qi buffeted the experts within the martial stage. Numerous individuals sought refuge as far back as they could, trembling in fear.

As for the Dragonblood Legion’s side, they had gone into a state of absolute defense. Meng Qi, Chu Yao, Tang Wan-er, Ye Zhiqiu, Guo Ran, Xia Chen, Gu Yang, and the others held the line.

Lian Wuying, Zhao Xingtian, and the others were still attacking them, but they were powerless to break through the formation.

Most terrifying of all was this one giant on the outskirts of the Dragonblood Legion’s defenses. Wilde was still slaughtering all enemies in his path.

Any demonic beasts, devil creatures, or even experts of the Undying race, as long as they weren’t human, would be consumed by him after he killed them.

After fighting for so long, Wilde showed no sign of running out of energy. Instead, he was fighting fiercer and fiercer, charging through the enemy ranks with no one capable of stopping him.

Wilde's defenses were truly remarkable. Even Eternal divine weapons could only barely penetrate his skin, but no more than that. Ordinary weapons weren’t even an itch when they landed on him.

As for magical art attacks, they were essentially useless. With a monster like Wilde running rampant, Lian Wuying and the others couldn’t launch a proper concentrated attack to pierce through the Dragonblood Legion’s defenses.

Sometimes, they would barely manage to create an opening when Wilde came charging over, ruining their attack. As a result, Lian Wuying and the others were incensed.

Wilde wasn’t smart enough to even know what a hole was on the formation. However, one of his strong points was that he listened well. With Guo Ran directing him, his power was unleashed right where they needed it.

Wilde was now unstoppable on the battlefield. As the Undying experts capable of stopping him had been slain by Long Chen, there was now no one capable of restraining him.

Even Lian Wuying’s attacks could be destroyed by Wilde’s bare hands, and he was even able to tear through her lily leaves. He then used those leaves to wrap his meat for flavor and efficiency, driving Lian Wuying crazy.

On another battlefield, Mo Nian was fighting Yan Wuji, and the battle was equally intense. Mo Nian had finally taken out his bow, and the two were evenly matched. But compared to Long Chen and Long Aotian’s battle, they were fighting very conservatively, competing with movement arts, techniques, skills, and speed.

They left behind tens of thousands of afterimages as they shot through the air. There was no way to see their movements clearly. This intense battle was also extremely dangerous. One mistake could instantly decide the victor and the loser.

However, if the two continued to be evenly matched, then this battle would be drawn out into a battle of attrition. They weren’t using an exceptionally large amount of energy, so a battle like this could last for a while.

BOOM!

Long Chen and Long Aotian once more clashed, unleashing wild qi waves that buffeted the martial stage once again.

The barrier was like a broken spider web now, with cracks and sagging sections, but it staunchly refused to crumble.

Within the barrier, countless experts wanted to flee. However, when they tried to charge through the holes of the barrier, they were still exterminated by the laws of the barrier. Even Triple Supremes were unable to pass through.

Although the barrier looked like it was half gone, it still possessed terrifying power, and it was impossible to pass through it.

As for Feng Fei, she led the Jiang clan’s experts to one corner and bitterly endured. Their full focus was on Long Chen and Long Aotian’s attacks, doing their best to dodge them.

The shockwaves coming from their battle were something that Feng Fei could easily dodge, but the majority of the Jiang clan’s disciples couldn’t. If she were to dodge by herself, most of the Jiang clan’s disciples would be wiped out. She would have to bear the consequences of such a thing.

Now, the Jiang clan’s disciples no longer felt the slightest resentment toward Feng Fei. Even those who had been thinking the same thing as Jiang Feng understood just how foolish their line of thinking was.

It was Feng Fei who was smart enough to make the Jiang clan’s disciples remain neutral this entire time. Against a terrifying expert like Long Chen, it would be one thing if they really could kill him. But if they couldn’t, then once he grew in the future, the Jiang clan would really be doomed.

While they rejoiced inside, they also laughed at the Zhao, Ye, Long, and other Eternal clans. They had all participated in attacking the Dragonblood Legion.

As a result, they had taken countless casualties without gaining the slightest thing from those sacrifices. Furthermore, they had fully offended Long Chen. It went without saying that there would probably be a good show to watch in the future between them and Long Chen.

Although the Jiang clan’s disciples hadn’t gained anything either, other than Jiang Feng, not one of them had died foolishly. They could be considered the most fortunate among these factions.

However, this fortune might vanish at any moment, so they had to preserve that luck. In order to make sure that they all survived, they had to avoid getting swept up in Long Chen and Long Aotian’s attacks.

It could be said that everyone was watching Long Chen and Long Aotian’s battle seriously. Their battle was the determinant of whether or not they would see tomorrow’s sun.

Suddenly, both Long Chen and Long Aotian retreated at the same time. The two stared at each other coldly, and heaven and earth seemed to freeze.

“I know that you are still holding back,” said Long Aotian coldly.

“I also know that you are holding back,” responded Long Chen.

“Are you afraid?” Long Aotian smiled mockingly.
