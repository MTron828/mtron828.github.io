Chapter 3508

When Yu Qingxuan’s gaze swept over the crowd, she immediately saw a black-robed man standing out like a crane amongst chickens, like a phoenix amongst crows.

She was delighted, and that kind of delight came from her inner heart. When she saw Long Chen, a sweet smile appeared on her face, and it was not the same smile she gave off for social niceties.

Hence, everyone was startled. Following Yu Qingxuan’s gaze, they saw a handsome, black-robed man whose eyes were like stars. The light in his eyes contained strong emotions, and he was staring at Yu Qingxuan unblinkingly.

Seeing that she recognized him, Long Chen smiled and nodded. “I really didn’t expect to see you here.” This was true. Who would have thought that he would see Yu Qingxuan in such a place? He was extremely moved.

“I’ve always felt very guilty about what happened last time. Thank you for giving me the Heavenly Rainbow Flame. I will always remember that favor.” Yu Qingxuan came up to Long Chen, speaking sincerely.

Hearing this, everyone was shocked. From what she said, the Heavenly Rainbow Flame was actually given to her by this black-robed man?

However, when they looked at Long Chen, they found him to be very ordinary. He might have a somewhat arrogantly large saber on his back, but he didn’t give off any sense of pressure. His aura was comparatively mild. Other than being a bit handsome, he seemed like an ordinary person.

Such a person was connected to the rank nine Heavenly Flame, the Heavenly Rainbow Flame? Furthermore, he had given it to fairy Qingxuan? Knowing this, people felt a bit dazed.

“You’re too courteous. The Heavenly Rainbow Flame is part of your life from the start. It has no fate with me. Moreover, the aura of your soul is fluctuating, along with the divine light in your eyes. You have started to try merging with the Heavenly Rainbow Flame, correct? Congratulations.” Long Chen smiled.

Back then, the Heavenly Rainbow Fairy had told him that he was not to be the master of the Heavenly Rainbow Flame. At that time, he had refused to accept it and had even said that he would kill anyone who dared to fight him over it.

However, when Yu Qingxuan appeared, he actually offered it to her with both hands. Although it was a bit of a slap in his own face, he was happier than ever.

“You’re very amazing. You even managed to see this. It seems that you are a flame expert as well. However, that just makes me feel even more guilty.” Yu Qingxuan looked at Long Chen with a bit of embarrassment.

Long Chen could see through her current state, which meant that he was a true expert of the Flame Dao. The Heavenly Rainbow Flame was even more important to such a person and would be treated as important as their own life. For Long Chen to have given her the Heavenly Rainbow Flame, it was like he had given her his life.

“I told you that let alone the Heavenly Rainbow Flame, even if you wanted my life, I would give it to you without hesitation,” said Long Chen solemnly.

Yu Qingxuan blushed. These words were a bit too unsubtle.

However, she then thought back to when she had first encountered him. At that time, he said that he loved her, saying that he would transform himself into a stone bridge that endured millennia of winds, sun, and rain just to wait for her to cross.

Although Yu Qingxuan’s status was special and her beauty was as transcendent as ever, resulting in her having countless people pursuing her, she had never heard such moving words of love.

With Long Chen saying this, the other men around Yu Qingxuan all had ugly expressions. Just how majestic was Yu Qingxuan’s status? They were all working hard to show themselves off, hoping to win the favorable opinion of this beauty.

Instead, it was this ordinary little fellow with ordinary clothes and an ordinary aura that was so nakedly expressing himself to fairy Qingxuan. He did not leave them with any face.

They were all people with large backgrounds. Hence, an ordinary person like Long Chen normally wasn’t given a second glance, but fairy Qingxuan was connected to such a figure and was even talking and smiling with him.

Her gaze in particular was different compared to when she looked at them. Hence, they all felt a bit uncomfortable inside. For Long Chen to say such words, he essentially expressed his feelings toward her, irritating them.

“Fairy Qingxuan, the delicacies and wine have been prepared. We should sit and chat!” interjected Feng Xiang.

“Oh! Sorry, I forgot. Then can I invite my friend to join us?” asked Yu Qingxuan.

“That… that’s not very suitable. His status…” Feng Xiang hesitated. He clearly didn’t want Long Chen to go up with them.

“I’m just an ordinary cultivator with no ability or status. It really isn’t suitable for me to be with all you heavenly geniuses. Qingxuan, I have received your kind regards. Don’t let me make you feel unhappy.” How could Long Chen not see through these people’s intentions? He smiled at Yu Qingxuan.

After that, those people’s expressions improved slightly. However, they didn’t know that Long Chen naturally wouldn’t let go of such an opportunity. Although the current Yu Qingxuan was no longer the old Yu Qingxuan, Long Chen believed that the two had essentially the same fundamental character. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

As he expected, Yu Qingxuan frowned. “Why must people separate themselves according to status? Can people of different statuses not be friends? If that’s the case, then I’m not going. I’ve received everyone’s warm greetings today. I would rather-”

Long Chen smiled slightly. Yu Qingxuan was still just as kind as ever. She felt that she owed him a huge debt. Hence, the more Long Chen talked like this, the more apologetic she felt.

Furthermore, from her words, he could tell that these people had no relationship with her. He relaxed quite a bit.

“Fairy Qingxuan misunderstood brother Feng Xiang! He simply meant that everyone’s status and cultivation bases are different. We all have different cultivation paths. Brother Feng Xiang prepared delicacies that are mostly top grade flame element foods, and the wine is also very strong. He was simply afraid that this junior brother wouldn’t be able to endure it. If something happened, it would ruin the mood. Furthermore, everyone’s level is different, and everyone’s Dao discussion is different. Brother Feng Xiang is worried that this junior brother will be embarrassed. He has no evil intention,” said another man with a golden crown and luxurious clothes.

“Right, right! Brother Mingxuan is right, that’s what I was thinking. If this junior brother wishes to come, I, Feng Xiang, will be overjoyed. Junior brother, what do you say?” Feng Xiang was originally looking down on Long Chen, but now he quickly acted pragmatic.

Although he might look down on Long Chen, Yu Qingxuan was unhappy due to that, and that would ruin everything for all of them.

Mingxuan had given him a good way out, so he directly tossed the ball to Long Chen.

His meaning was that Long Chen had better be smart, or even if he did come, he would have no good fruit to eat. He would only embarrass himself.

How could Long Chen not be clear on what they were thinking?

Long Chen’s eyes brightened and he excitedly said, “So everyone is a heavenly genius of the Flame Dao? Then I’ve been rude. I know a little bit about the Flame Dao, and I really want to hear everyone’s marvelous thoughts on the Flame Dao. Haha, it seems that fairy Qingxuan really is my lucky star!”

The gazes of those men changed when Long Chen said this, but they did their best to cover it up. Feng Xiang could only say, “Since that’s the case, junior brother, please come with us!”

He had already invited Long Chen. If he now said that Long Chen couldn’t come, Yu Qingxuan might immediately turn hostile. He didn’t want such a small matter to result in absolute failure. However, these people had definitely formed a grudge against Long Chen. It seemed that in a bit, they would be making things hard for Long Chen.
