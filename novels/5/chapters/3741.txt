Chapter 3730 Chaos

Light pulled the Divine Lords of the Violet Flame Heaven Capital into the gate. More and more of them were flying up.

Even this giant channel began to feel packed, and some lifeforms ended up very close to each other. Guo Ran had precisely attacked that demonic beast expert because they were right beside each other.

That demonic beast had previously challenged the entire human race, so Guo Ran naturally wouldn’t let him off.

This resulted in countless demonic beasts charging at him. However, there seemed to be an invisible force keeping them in place. They were able to move within a certain range around themselves, but past that range, they would be blocked and knocked back to their original location.

Seeing this scene, Guo Ran arrogantly laughed. “I’ve long since found you animals displeasing to the eye. Anyone who doesn’t like it can come and fight me right now!”

The other races were provoked by this shout. One of them was a Supreme expert from the Netherworld. He was the closest, and with a sharp blade in his hand, he attacked. “Inferior human race, you old slaves, when did it become your turn to be arrogant?!”

“When is it not my turn to be arrogant?” Guo Ran sneered, and in the face of that blade, Guo Ran received it barehanded and punched that expert with his other hand.

BOOM!

A huge explosion erupted. Guo Ran then let out a grunt and fell back a few steps.

On the other hand, his opponent was sent flying, shocking everyone else. They were all limited by the laws of the three thousand worlds right now and didn’t have that much space to move. How could this Netherworld expert escape this limit and fly so far?

Furthermore, he wasn’t flying in a straight line. He was dropping further and further.

“How can this be?!”

People’s expressions changed. They had tested it. They were being pulled up by some invisible force and couldn’t fight back against it. Although they could move left and right, their bodies were constantly being pulled into the gate. They couldn’t retreat as their names were on the Grand Dao Flower. 

“You… inferior human… you… sneak attacked…”

Another expert from the Netherworld caught this person and was shocked to find a bloody hole in his head. There were strange rust marks around the bloody hole. That Supreme expert was already dead. Even his Yuan Spirit was gone.

“Inferior? No matter how inferior I am, can I reach your level? You bastards used numbers to attack the human race. Is that not the actions of an inferior species?” sneered Guo Ran.

Just now, in their clash, Guo Ran’s true killing blow wasn’t his Supreme Bone but the arrow concealed in his left arm.

The arrow was merged with the rust that Long Chen had given him. This rust came from the Ghost Ship that Long Chen had climbed, and it contained the power of time. Once it fell on a person’s body, their body would instantly rot.

Guo Ran and Xia Chen had even made special runes using the power of time of this rust. This arrow was a silent killer. Once it struck someone’s head, that person’s Yuan Spirit would be instantly annihilated.

That was why the other experts present didn’t notice Guo Ran’s attack. All their attention was focused on his Supreme Bone.

“Inferior human race! Die!”

The Netherworld’s experts were enraged after seeing one of their Supreme heavenly geniuses dead. They began to attack the human race.Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

At the same time, the demonic beast race, the devil race, the Blood race, and the others also attacked the human race. Everything descended into chaos.

A rain of blood filled the space in front of the gate, falling to the ground. The human race’s experts reacted quickly upon seeing this unfavorable situation. They quickened the pace and shot straight toward the gate. Once they arrived in front of it, they vanished.

“So you can charge forward yourself!”

Upon noticing this, the others also quickly shot toward the gate, breaking through the encirclement of the various races.

“Stop the human race! Kill them!” roared one expert.

“Idiot. Do you think you can stop the human race? Death Ripple, Spatial Slaughter!”

Enpuda’s disciple, Ji Wuming, appeared. When experts from the other worlds got in his way, with a cold snort, he extended a single hand, and a ripple spread. It was a terrifying spatial blade that destroyed the surrounding space. Wherever that ripple passed, those that blocked him were blown apart.

“Spatial energy! Get out of the way!”

A shocked cry rang out. Those experts blocking him fled as if they were avoiding a death god.

Following that, a chilling killing intent appeared and countless experts exploded. A woman came forth. This woman was the Nine Underworld Luocha.

What shocked people was that she hadn’t even made a move, but those in her way had simply been blown apart by an invisible energy.

“Don’t block her! She isn’t human!” shouted one of the Underworld’s Supreme experts, his expression changing.

“Foolish lifeforms. You don’t even recognize the noble Luocha race.”

The Nine Underworld Luocha sneered. At this moment, divine light flowed out of her body, forming a bizarre domain. No one dared to even get close to it.

Her figure suddenly moved. With a sword in hand, she tore through space, causing countless startled cries to ring out.

“It’s Long Chen!”

Seeing the direction she was going, they saw the motionless Long Chen whose hands were clasped behind his back. 

Just as her sword was no more than a few feet away from Long Chen, she was no longer able to push it forward. A strange law blocked her and sent her flying back.

As for Long Chen, he didn’t even glance at the Nine Underworld Luocha. He just slowly floated up to the gate. His expression infuriated the NIne Underworld Luocha. Being completely ignored was even more humiliating than being loathed.

However, she knew that the two of them were separated by the limits of the laws. She was unable to attack him. If she tried to break this law, she was afraid that this would cause her to lose her chance to participate in the opening of the three thousand worlds. She didn’t dare to take that risk.

“Long Chen, your life is mine.” The Nine Underworld Luocha clenched her teeth.

Long Chen still didn’t even look at her. His attention was entirely on the Dragonblood warriors.

The Dragonblood warriors knew what he was thinking. They immediately rushed toward the gate as soon as they were lifted. Although there were many layers of blockades, they still managed to make it through the chaos and vanished.

Long Chen, Xia Chen, and Guo Ran could only relax when they saw that their people had entered. Only then did they fly toward the gate. Those that couldn’t beat them didn’t dare to block them. As for those who did dare to block them, they were too far and could only glare at them.

Suddenly, Long Chen smiled and saw a figure right in front of the gate. Yu Qingxuan smiled at him. It could count as a greeting before she turned and entered the gate.

Long Chen then lowered his head and saw Xia Guhong smiling at him in the Violet Flame Heaven Capital. Xia Guhong clenched his fist and rapped his chest. Long Chen then nodded and rapped his own chest with his fist as well.

Long Chen gave a look at Guo Ran and Xia Chen. After that, the two of them immediately entered the gate and vanished.

When Long Chen reached the gate, the void exploded. A lightning sword shattered spatial restrictions to attack Long Chen.

“Weng Tianhao!”

The experts on the ground cried out in shock. He actually took the risk of attacking at this time? Was he crazy?
