Chapter 3447 Who is the Bigger Boss?

“Quick, replace the immortal king crystals!” shouted Bai Zhantang.

The attack of the devils rapidly depleted the energy of the immortal king crystals maintaining the formation.

“It’s only been two hours since we last replaced them! It seems that they have increased their attack power.” Bai Shishi’s mother frowned, looking at the devils outside the formation.

“If this continues, the immortal king crystals we have won’t last more than a few days,” said Heaven Master Yun Yang gravely.

Heaven Master Yun Yang and Heaven Master Dong Ming had been promoted to deputy deans of the academy. Essentially, Long Chen had left all the work to the two of them. So, in the past two days, the two of them had gotten quite a few more white hairs.

The main academy had sent over immortal king crystals to support the formation, but they would only last at most three more days at this rate. In just one day, almost a thousand immortal king crystals were exhausted. That was an incredibly painful price.

“Your dean is back, and he doesn’t seem worried at all, so what are you all worried about?” said Bai Zhantang irritably.

He was left in a bad mood from seeing Bai Shishi run up and hug Long Chen, so he intentionally said some cold words.

“What kind of attitude is that? After seeing the great dean, shouldn’t you hurry and bow in greeting? Instead you act arrogant? It seems that you don’t place my boss, the dean, in your eyes!” chided Bai Xiaole. With Long Chen’s return, he instantly stood up straighter.

Bai Shishi and Bai Xiaole’s mothers laughed when they heard that. But Bai Zhantang’s expression darkened. He angrily roared, “You little brat, you don’t know who the bigger boss is!”UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

Bai Zhantang grabbed Bai Xiaole by the collar. He would show his son who the boss was today.

In the past few days, Bai Xiaole had been very obedient in front of Bai Zhantang, making him happy. So, he had given his son quite a few good things during this time. But now, this little fellow instantly flipped on him when Long Chen returned. It seemed that all his previous respectfulness had been faked. As his father, Bai Zhantang felt like he needed to teach his son a lesson.

Just then, Bai Zhantang’s wrist was caught by Long Chen’s hand. He naturally couldn’t let Bai Xiaole suffer for him.

“Sorry, deputy palace master, this place is the seventh branch academy. I am the biggest one here,” said Long Chen with a smile.

Suddenly, the bricks beneath Bai Zhantang and Long Chen’s feet shattered. Clearly, the two of them were competing. As the ground was unable to endure their power, cracks spread on the ground.

Just then, a hand slapped Bai Zhantang on the back of his head. Unexpectedly, it was Bai Shishi’s mother.

This graceful and elegant woman was now frosty with anger. The slap on the back of his head sent Bai Zhantang reeling.

“Just how old are you to quibble with a child? Can the bigger boss be so immature?”

Everyone, including Long Chen, was shocked and their jaws dropped. In her current state, she seemed to be a tigress, a completely different person from her normally warm self.

As a result, Bai Zhantang’s fury vanished. Like a defeated rooster, he lowered his head and didn’t make a sound.

“I wanted to give you some face, but you get more and more out of control. We’re leaving. Stop embarrassing yourself here,” ordered Bai Shishi’s mother.

Bai Zhantang really did leave just like that with his head down. Let alone Long Chen, even Bai Xiaole was stunned. He only reacted after a moment and cried out, “Aunt, you’re so amazing!”

As soon as she turned to look at Bai Xiaole, her anger vanished. She returned to her warm self and smiled at him. “Men. You can’t indulge them too much, or they’ll think that they’ve become a god, don’t you think?”

Long Chen instantly caught goosebumps all over. These words were clearly for him.

“Cough, deputy dean Yun Yang, deputy dean Dong Ming, when it comes to immortal king crystals, there’s no need for you to worry. As long as I am present, we won’t be lacking money.” When Long Chen waved his hand, countless people cried out in shock. It was because a small mountain of immortal king crystals had appeared. The clear sound of a few crystals rolling down was exceptionally pleasant in their ears.

Everyone was stunned, even Bai Shishi and Bai Xiaole’s mothers. Even experts on their level were shocked.

After all, seeing hundreds of thousands of immortal king crystals at once was truly shocking. Heaven Master Dong Ming and Yun Yang were delighted.

“Now we’re saved. These immortal king crystals will be enough to last us several months,” said Heaven Master Dong Ming excitedly.

“What are you talking about? This is just some pocket money that is to be given to everyone as a side benefit. Every expert who came to support us will get a portion. We can’t let them come for nothing, or they’ll think that our seventh branch academy is stingy,” said Long Chen, waving his hand.

“Pocket money?”

“Side benefit?”

Everyone was stunned. Long Chen was actually going to split these immortal king crystals with everyone? Bai Shishi and Bai Xiaole’s mothers were stunned. Furthermore, Bai Zhantang, who had just dejectedly left, now ran back.

“Little fellow, those are your words! It just so happens that my brothers are missing some pocket money.”

Bai Zhantang eyed those immortal king crystals. Before he was even done talking, Bai Shishi’s mother grabbed his ear and dragged him away.

“We came due to the academy’s orders, and we have to carry out those orders. How can we ask for other rewards?” chided Bai Shishi’s mother.

“This doesn’t count as that. Just who is Long Chen? He is the dean. How can you not give face to the dean?” said Bai Zhantang righteously.

“Can you save yourself some face?!” demanded Bai Shishi’s mother.

“For my brothers, who cares about face?” said Bai Zhantang loftily.

“You!”

“Seniors!” Long Chen hastily interrupted them. “The deputy palace master is correct. You have come to save us twice. These immortal king crystals are only a small token of my gratitude, so you must accept them.”

“But right now, the defenses are more important,” said Bai Shishi’s mother. She was of the opinion that Long Chen had taken out these immortal king crystals due to the words that she had just said in order to win some face.

“I already said that this is just some pocket change. The academy’s regular expenses have been taken care of here.” Long Chen directly tossed a chest to Heaven Master Dong Ming.

Heaven Master Dong Ming opened it and almost cried out. After that, he hastily covered up the chest. But from Bai Shishi’s mother’s vantage point, she had managed to catch a glimpse of the interior. It was a huge space filled with immortal king crystals. That was more immortal king crystals than she had ever seen in her entire life.

That one chest had ten million immortal king crystals. Heaven Master Dong Ming almost fainted. Despite knowing that everyone in this place could be trusted, he still immediately covered it.

Although others couldn’t see what was inside the chest, just from his expression, they knew that there had to be more immortal king crystals inside compared to what Long Chen had taken out before.

After seeing those immortal king crystals, Bai Shishi’s mother understood that Long Chen wasn’t joking around. She then released Bai Zhantang.

Bai Zhantang didn’t stand on courtesy and directly gathered the pocket change of immortal king crystals. Before leaving, he hesitated for a moment, seemingly pondering if he should thank Long Chen. But he then left without saying anything.

“Xiaole, gather all the Four Peak disciples. I’ll lead you through your collective tribulation,” said Long Chen, laughing heroically.

Hearing this, all the disciples inside the seventh branch academy shouted excitedly. They had been waiting a long time for this day.
