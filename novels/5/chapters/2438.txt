Chapter 2428 The Arrogant Mo Nian

Translator: BornToBe

“Heavens, there’s so many people!”

When they arrived, they saw a veritable ocean of people. Everyone’s hearts thumped. The number of people present was truly monstrous.

Up ahead was the entrance to the divine families. The experts of all the various powers had long since arrived.

Originally, Long Chen had thought that the Martial Heaven Alliance would have brought the most people. But upon arriving, he saw that it wasn’t the case.

The Martial Heaven Alliance had had over a million elite disciples, but while attacking the Netherpassage realm, half of them had failed.

These remaining eight hundred thousand disciples were the full power of the Martial Heaven Alliance. The numbers advantage that they had assumed they would possess was not so obvious any longer.

An initial estimate of the experts present was around five million. Long Chen and the others were stunned.

Those experts saw Long Chen’s group arriving. Some people amongst the crowd beckoned toward him, creating a path for him.

The ones greeting him were those from the Beitang family, the Nangong family, the Illusive Music Immortal Palace, and the Xuan Beasts. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

Nangong Zuiyue, Beitang Rushuang, and Zi Yan were leading their respective groups. They had long since arrived and had helped occupy space for Long Chen.

“It’s been a long time. Your radiance is as blinding as ever. Here, let us have a pure hug for each of you.” Long Chen walked off the flying boat, laughing as he greeted them.

Regretfully, the three of them ignored him, brushing past him and instead warmly greeting Meng Qi and the others.

“Boss, while your cultivation base grew during this time, your pick-up arts have clearly regressed,” snickered Guo Ran.

“Brother Long, it’s been a long time.”

Suddenly, a man walked out of the crowd. The first thing noticeable about him was the giant die behind him.

“Hu Feng.”

This person was the heir to the Gambling Heavenly Dao, Hu Feng. It almost felt like he had vanished during this time. It had been a long time since there was any news of him.

At this time, Hu Feng didn’t even appear to be a cultivator. He seemed much more like a refined scholar.

“It really has been a while. I see that you’ve profited quite a bit recently. I wonder if you can guide this little brother to profit as well.” Long Chen smiled. He had never sensed any hostility from Hu Feng.

“Brother Long is joking. I’ll probably be the one following you this time in the Star Field Divine World. I’ll be hoping for your guidance,” said Hu Feng humbly.

“Oh? Do you know more about the Star Field Divine World?” asked Long Chen curiously.

Hu Feng shook his head. “I am not clear about the Star Field Divine World. However, I did some divination, and I know that a tribulation is coming for me, one that will decide my life or death. I have found that if I have a certain person’s help, I will be able to benefit immensely from this tribulation, but I was unable to find any clues about who that person is. But after pondering over it, I believe that brother Long is the one most likely to be able to help me during my time of crisis.”

“You know divination? Brother, can you help me tell when I will become a famous figure?” asked Guo Ran excitedly.

“Brother Guo is joking. I can only gamble against the Heavenly Daos myself. This divination is limited to myself. Furthermore, brother Guo, you have created an unprecedented cultivation path with your armor. You’ve long since become a famous figure.”

“Hahaha, although I know that you’re just being polite, I don’t know why, but it really feels good.” Guo Ran gave him a thumbs-up.

“Brother Hu, what is there to say? We naturally should help each other out in the Star Field Divine World. If the Martial Heaven Alliance’s disciples are in trouble, I trust that you won’t just stand to the side and watch, right?” said Long Chen.

“Of course not.” Hu Feng nodded.

“Who would have thought that the world’s number one alliance would have so few people? It seems that quite a few lives were lost on the Netherpassage path.” Just as they were conversing, a sinister voice rang out above the chatter of the crowd. Things fell silent.

The Martial Heaven Alliance’s disciples’ expressions sank. This was a clear provocation. They looked over to find that the voice came from the side of the Corrupt path.

The Corrupt path’s experts opened a path, revealing two people. One of them was the Corrupt path’s number one heavenly genius, Tian Xiezi.

Beside him was another person, but that person was covered in a black cloak that concealed his face.

There was no aura coming from him. Without looking at him, it was impossible to sense his existence.

Black qi whirled around Tian Xiezi as if he was a god of death. The Death Qi within him was incredibly powerful. He had reached the third step of Netherpassage, and his death energy was extremely dense. It also contained a corrosive aura. Just looking at him made people feel like they were being invaded by death energy, as if they were rapidly aging.

Tian Xiezi had grown far stronger during this time. That wasn’t just his cultivation base but something else. His voice was full of arrogance.

However, Long Chen wasn’t even looking at him. His gaze was on the person beside him. That person gave him an extremely dangerous feeling. That feeling was a bit familiar.

Long Chen suddenly realized what was so familiar about it. “You’re that person on top of the lotus throne in the Corrupt God Cemetery.”

When he had charged into the Corrupt God Cemetery while chasing Tian Xiezi, he had been drawn into the depths of the cemetery by the Corrupt Emperor. The Corrupt Emperor had only had a wisp of his remnant soul remaining and had been unable to kill Long Chen.

He had tried to use the mechanisms of the cemetery to kill Long Chen. There had been a black lotus throne between the sixteen coffins. Long Chen had tried to attack the person sitting there, but he had triggered a formation and almost died.

At that time, he had only seen his back, but the instant that he had attacked, a trace of this person’s aura had leaked out.

Although it had just been a trace, the Nine Star Hegemon Body Art had memorized it. Despite the fact that this man wasn’t releasing any aura now, Long Chen could still guess his identity.

However, the man didn’t move or reply. It was as if he hadn’t heard Long Chen.

“Long Chen, your death is at hand. The Star Field Divine World will be your burial ground!” Tian Xiezi laughed arrogantly.

“This fellow’s a bother. Boss, how about we just kill him now? As long as you give the order, I’ll immediately bury him,” said Guo Ran.

Tian Xiezi was truly arrogant. The Dragonblood warriors were bristling. If Long Chen gave the order, they would immediately attack.

The killing intent of the Dragonblood Legion filled the air, shocking the other experts. The atmosphere instantly grew tense.

“Ten years I wandered with my bow, my arrows causing heaven and earth to shake. The nine heavens, ten lands, and all the universe will revolve around me.”

Suddenly, a voice rang out from a great distance, cutting through the tense atmosphere. Everyone’s attention was drawn over.

Mo Nian appeared, the hood of a cloak covering his face above his nose. A faint smile of contempt was the only thing revealed.

Mo Nian was standing at the front of a flying boat, and he had a multicolored bow on his back. It went without saying that this arrival was quite flashy.

He slowly took off his hood, revealing his face. Overlooking the experts, he laughed, “Rookies, tremble in fear. I am no longer the old Mo Nian. My friends, unleash your cheers. I will be your strongest support. As for my enemies, unleash your cries, because I will be your nightmare. You can spend your final moments living in terror.”

“Has Mo Nian gone crazy? Is he not afraid of a beating?” Guo Ran looked at Mo Nian in disbelief. Mo Nian’s aura clearly showed that he had just entered the Netherpassage realm.

His life and death energy was still fluctuating. He had yet to even balance it, meaning that his tribulation had just finished. Someone who had just advanced to Netherpassage was acting this arrogant?

“No. He wouldn’t be Mo Nian if he wasn’t arrogant in his current state,” said Long Chen with a smirk. The current Mo Nian truly looked like he needed a beating. But his realm was simply bait. Cultivation base wasn’t the only indicator of power. Mo Nian was truly evil. He was intentionally releasing the aura of his cultivation base, acting like a pig to eat the tiger.

“Di Feng, where are you? Your daddy Mo is here to settle our debts.”

Mo Nian swaggered off the flying boat, shouting at the distant experts of the ancient family alliance.
