Chapter 3214 Who is More Arrogant

That voice wasn’t loud or angry, yet it contained unquestionable might. Even Long Chen felt his heart pounding when he heard it.

Just from this voice, Long Chen could sense the pride and stubbornness within the speaker’s bones. Just the voice alone made his heart fall.

He was similar to Long Chen in some areas. This person would never change the things that he had decided on, nor would he ever feel remorse for the things that he had done.

As a result, it was probably going to be a clash of two sharp points. Long Chen had come to investigate his mother, but just this voice made him feel like it was going to be far more difficult than he had expected.

As for Luo Changwu and the other members of the Luo family, when they heard the voice mention the Honing Heavenly Staircase, all their expressions changed. But not one person dared to contradict him.

“Family head, Long Chen has just set foot into the Four Peak realm…” said Luo Changwu hesitantly.

However, no response came. Clearly, the family head had decided on this matter, and there was no room for negotiation.

After a bit, seeing no response, Luo Changwu sighed and turned to Long Chen apologetically. “Long Chen, maybe you shouldn’t have come. Why don’t you go back and return when you’ve reached the Divine Lord realm?”

“What? Is that Honing Heavenly Staircase a mountain of blades or a deep fryer?” asked Long Chen.

“You might not know this, but the Honing Heavenly Staircase is a trial ground of our Luo family. There are ninety-nine steps on it, and it is a remnant from ancient times. The first forty-nine steps are for Four Peak disciples, while the top forty-nine steps are for Divine Lords. My talent is limited, and I only reached the seventy-ninth step. Afterward, I never tried again. In the recent history of the Luo family, only the family head managed to climb all ninety-nine steps, and he did it at the late Four Peak realm. To have you, someone who has just advanced to the Four Peak realm, also climb the Honing Heavenly Staircase… it truly is difficult,” said Luo Changwu with difficulty.

After all, in so many generations of the Luo family, only one such terrifying figure had appeared, and now he was using himself as the standard. No, it should be said that he was requesting an even higher standard from Long Chen.

However, Luo Zichuan possessed absolute authority within the Luo family. No one could question his orders, not even Luo Changwu, his own son.

On the other hand, Long Chen had helped the Luo family immensely in their time of need and was viewed very importantly by the Luo family. For them to treat him like this was a bit unacceptable. Luo Changwu was unable to comprehend what his father was thinking.

“Since the family head wishes it, wouldn’t it mean that I’m afraid if I don’t go? If the family head could climb it, well, while I naturally can’t compete with the family head, I do have the courage to at least try,” said Long Chen.

Knowing that this was a trial his grandfather had set for him, Long Chen felt even greater ire for him. He had already given the Luo family so many benefits. Even if the Luo family was arrogant and didn’t need to fawn over him, it seemed that they weren’t qualified to stand on airs with him, no?

If it weren’t for his mother, would he have to suffer this grievance? They wanted to test him? Then come.

Long Chen was also extremely proud and arrogant. Luo Zichuan was using his own path to test Long Chen, so how could he retreat?

The feeling that Long Chen got from Luo Zichuan was that he was exceedingly prideful. Even though Long Chen had helped the Luo family, if Long Chen wished to speak to him, he had to have the proper qualifications. And those qualifications were for him to ascend the Honing Heavenly Staircase.

For there to be such an unreasonable person in this world made Long Chen angry. Fine, he would use his power to show that he didn’t lack the same arrogance.

Luo Changwu also saw that despite Long Chen’s smile, he was a bit angry. That was precisely what he had been most afraid of. The Honing Heavenly Staircase wasn’t something that could be forcibly climbed. If a person couldn’t recognize their limit and forced it, they would die.

It was unknown just how many arrogant heavenly geniuses of the Luo family had died climbing the Honing Heavenly Staircase. If Long Chen lost his life here after overstepping his limit, wouldn’t the Luo family become the laughingstock of the world?

He didn’t understand why his father would do this, but Luo Zichuan never explained his actions. From the top to bottom, all members of the Luo family simply had to obey him.

Luo Changwu saw Long Chen’s anger and couldn’t help feeling profoundly helpless. If he tried to advise Long Chen now, it would instead be viewed as looking down on him, making Long Chen want to show off even more. After all, at such a young age, they cared especially about being looked down on.

“Then let’s go. I hope you can stay calm. If you really can’t do it, don’t force it. That is very dangerous.” Luo Changwu patted Long Chen’s shoulder. All he could do was tactfully express his opinion.

“Junior understands. I cherish my life more than anyone. I won’t lose it for nothing,” said Long Chen. This uncle of his was at least not bad. He wasn’t as irritatingly overbearing as his grandfather.

Hearing that, Luo Changwu was a bit more at ease. If Long Chen really could understand how to retreat when he needed to, that would be excellent.

Bai Xiaole and the others were attended to by other people from the Luo family. Only Long Chen followed Luo Changwu past layers of stone trees at the rear.

Luo Changwu’s expression was grave, and he didn’t say a word. Long Chen smiled. “Senior, there’s no need to be worried.”

Luo Changwu shook his head. “The family head’s thoughts are known only to himself. Even as his son, just like my big brother, I never know what he’s thinking. Ever since we were young, we could only listen to his orders. Only junior sister…”

Luo Changwu suddenly shut his mouth, an expression of pain appearing in his eyes.

Long Chen’s heart pounded. He knew that this junior sister of his was his mother. Long Chen wanted to ask him more about her. He so badly wanted to tell him that he was his junior sister’s son.

However, he couldn’t. At the very least, he still couldn’t lay all his cards on the table. He wanted to ask where his mother was and reunite with his father first.

As for the grievance between his mother and the Luo family, that wasn’t something that could be resolved with martial power, nor was it something that he could resolve. This family head was too stubborn, so stubborn that others couldn’t breathe.

Clearly, Luo Changwu was full of respect and reverence for him, and although he didn’t approve of his father’s methods, he was powerless to change anything.

The Luo family inhabited this stone mountain range. There was a stone forest with caves all around for the Luo family’s people to cultivate in.

On the way, Long Chen noticed that the Luo family’s territory was even larger than he had expected. However, such a big family didn’t have that many people. It was a huge land, with few people.

He knew that due to the Chu family’s tricks, the majority of the Luo family’s forces were distributed to the other battlefield. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

In less than an hour, as Long Chen walked, the stone trees in his sight became taller and taller until he saw a stone cliff soaring into the clouds.

Looking from a distance, he saw clouds circling the waist of the mountain. It gave off a grand and heavy feeling. Just looking at it made his soul twinge.

At the foot of the mountain were stone steps, and every step was several meters high. It was as if the steps were for giants.

“This is the Honing Heavenly Staircase. The family head is at the top. Be careful. Sometimes retreating is the wisest option,” said Luo Changwu, once more patting Long Chen’s shoulder before leaving.

Long Chen stood at the bottom of the stone staircase. Staring up at the path that led beyond the clothes, he felt a pair of eyes watching him.

Long Chen took a deep breath and raised his leg to start the climb.
