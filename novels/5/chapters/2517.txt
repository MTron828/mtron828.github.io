Chapter 2507 Covering the Stars

Wilde had swung the door bolt fewer than twenty times but had still exhausted all his energy. He was soaked in sweat and panting heavily.

Wilde shrank and fell to the ground. However, the door bolt also shrank with him. It became a few meters long and as thick as a person’s leg, a perfect size for Wilde to hold in his current state.

Although Wilde had shrunk back down, the golden light on his body had yet to fully regress. Wilde couldn’t return to his normal state, or the door bolt would sink him into the earth.

Wilde held the door bolt in one hand and took out a bowl with the other. He grabbed a tail from within the bowl and tossed it into his mouth.

He chewed a few times and swallowed it. His aura began to recover. Then he ran over to a pile of corpses. With a wave of the bowl, thousands of Corpse Devouring Armored Spiders shrank until they were the size of a sesame seed. They were then rapidly popped into his mouth.

That wasn’t enough. He began to run around with the bowl, consuming the corpses at a crazy rate. His energy was quickly restored.

At this time, more and more of the Corpse Devouring Armored Spiders came flying over. The Dragonblood Legion continued to maintain their formation, slaughtering the ones that entered Long Chen’s flame domain.

“Wilde, eat later. Hit them a few more times!” called out Long Chen.

“Alright!” Having recovered a bit, Wilde summoned his Barbarian Blood Gold Body once more. He swung the door bolt, and a rain of corpses fell again. His killing power could not be compared to the Dragonblood Legion.

After five swings, the sky was empty. There were no more Corpse Devouring Armored Spiders to kill.

Wilde began to pant heavily once more. He devoured more corpses to recover his energy while everyone else cleaned up the battlefield.

This time, Long Chen didn’t take more of the corpses. Although he needed them, they were Wilde’s rations. Long Chen couldn’t fight with Wilde over them.

The Heavenly Qilin Demon Trees were now three-hundred-meters tall, but they were still in the sapling state. Despite that, the amount of energy within a single one of them was greater than the forest of World Trees. This was a nice surprise.

After Wilde recovered a bit, they prepared to move out. To save time, Long Chen summoned the Azure Dragon Battle Armor and put the door bolt in his astral space. For the safety of the Heavenly Qilin Demon Trees, he couldn’t put it into his primal chaos space.

The immense power of the door bolt caused his entire astral space to shake. It was fortunate that he had advanced to the fourth step of Netherpassage, or his astral space might have been broken.

Without the door bolt, Wilde could jump onto Cloud’s back with everyone else. Cloud spread her wings and transformed into a streak of rainbow light.

They followed the marks of battle. The space ahead of them grew darker and darker as if they were throwing themselves into a bottomless abyss.

“Why is the aura here so cold?” Tang Wan-er shivered.

It wasn’t just Tang Wan-er. Everyone else felt the same thing. It felt like they were approaching somewhere terrifying. This place was full of the aura of death.

Only Wilde didn’t sense anything. He had eaten an unknown number of the Corpse Devouring Armored Spiders and fallen asleep.

“The divine families definitely hid something from me, but the Corrupt path and Pill Valley seem to know it. However, it doesn’t matter what kind of scheme they have. It will quickly be revealed,” said Long Chen.

Upon entering the Star Field Divine World, he immediately smelled the scent of a sinister scheme. The divine families had hidden things about the Star Field Divine World.

As for the Corrupt path and Pill Valley, they also didn’t breathe a word of what they knew to anyone else. Even Di Feng who had leaned heavily on the divine families might not necessarily have come into contact with such a core secret.

As for the idiots of the sea demon race, they were being used and had no idea.

When it came to the everlasting families, he believed that Nangong Zuiyue and Beitang Rushuang didn’t know anything, or they definitely would have warned him, either explicitly or at least implicitly.

Only Dongfang Yuyang seemed to have hidden himself truly well. It seemed that he knew many things. He was like a ghost hiding in the dark waiting to deal a fatal blow.

However, based on Long Chen’s guess, Dongfang Yuyang must have known quite a bit in order to obtain Di Feng’s trust. Without that, Di Feng wouldn’t have died to his hands so easily.

The world ahead of them grew darker. It was like endless darkness. Although everyone used their divine sense to replace their eyes, this darkness still made them feel an instinctual fear.

“Long Chen, this is most likely a trap,” said Meng Qi. Looking at the endless darkness ahead of them, she felt like they were entering the mouth of a terrifying beast.

“I know. Yun Tian must know as well. But the fact that Yun Tian still felt duty-bound to charge in means that he has enough of a reason. We have to follow no matter what. Now that the Dragonblood Legion has advanced to the fourth step of Netherpassage, who do we have to be afraid of?” Long Chen smiled.

“Exactly, we’ve reached the fourth step and finished awakening our manifestation. Who can stop us?” Guo Ran laughed heroically. The current Guo Ran was growing increasingly conceited.

Upon entering the Star Field Divine World, his heaven-defying karmic luck had caused his confidence to inflate. His new armor in particular made him feel like he was also a peerless expert. He wanted to test its power.

The Dragonblood warriors also felt an itch for a real battle. Hearing that it was a trap, rather than being perturbed, their battle intent soared.

“The auras in the earth are growing denser,” said Dong Mingyu as she looked at the scars of battle.

As an assassin, she was sensitive to all auras. Looking at the battle scars, she guessed that they had been made within the last few hours.

Cloud’s speed was truly amazing. They were getting closer and closer. If this place wasn’t so dangerous that Cloud didn’t dare to use her full speed, perhaps they might have already caught up.

“Yun Tian has been injured!” Long Chen’s heart shook. He reached out a hand, and a rock came flying into his hand. There was a drop of blood on it.

The blood was bright red and had sunk into the rock’s veins. It still emitted Yun Tian’s aura. Only a Sovereign’s descendant would possess blood with such a noble aura.

“Cloud, go faster. Everyone, prepare for battle,” said Long Chen. Evilmoon appeared in his hand.

Yun Tian was in danger. He was hunting down Ye Ming while facing multiple powerful enemies. The fact that he had been injured meant he was at an absolute disadvantage.

That was very normal. He was facing the combined attacks of Feng Fei, the Pill Fairy, Zhao Ritian, Ye Ming, and others. The fact that he could continue hunting down Ye Ming like this meant that his power was truly heaven-defying.

However, no matter how heaven-defying he was, against that many powerful enemies, he would sooner or later run out of energy.

Even though he had been injured, Yun Tian hadn’t stopped. Based on the battle scars, he was focused entirely on killing Ye Ming. Ye Ming’s blood had been extremely common on their way here, but not anyone else’s.

Cloud’s feathers lit up with rainbow light. Her speed gradually increased. Due to how fast they were, Cloud was unable to even search the tracks. She needed Meng Qi to indicate which direction to go.

“Up ahead, it seems… there’s a giant tree?” exclaimed Meng Qi suddenly.

With Cloud’s speed, everyone else also quickly sensed it.

“Heavens, what tree is this big?”

Everyone was shocked, even Long Chen. There was no way to describe the size of this tree.

Even with Cloud’s speed, after several seconds, it still looked like they had barely gotten closer to it. Compared to its size, Cloud’s speed seemed to have dropped.

This tree had already escaped the sky. The stars in the sky were like its fruit. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

Compared to this tree, the Heavenly Qilin Demon Tree and the Luo Spirit race’s Life Spirit God were saplings. Everyone was deeply shaken. If they were not personally seeing it, none of them would have believed there could be such a giant existence in this world.

“Strange, why doesn’t this tree have any vitality?” muttered Liu Ruyan.

Only then did everyone else realize it. Theoretically, such a giant tree should be emitting a vast amount of life energy. They should already be able to sense it. But even at this distance, they couldn’t feel anything.

“Is it already dead?” wondered Guo Ran.

“Cloud, don’t hold back any longer. Go straight toward that tree!” shouted Long Chen suddenly.

Cloud’s wings shook and space suddenly twisted. Everyone felt like they had entered a tunnel where time was flowing past them.

In just a moment, they reached the tree. Once they were beneath its crown, they could truly feel its size. If this tree was planted within the Martial Heaven Continent, it might be able to completely cover the Central Plains.

Even after entering its crown, it took an incense stick’s worth of time to see a towering trunk.

Suddenly, countless black figures charged out of the earth at them.

“It’s the Heaven Devouring Black Armor Corps!” shouted Long Chen. He swung his saber, unleashing a river of black stars that slaughtered them.

Their arrival caused Cloud’s speed to drop. The space around them once more became clear, and they heard explosions coming ahead.

Long Chen looked over. He saw a huge furnace unleashing divine light be sent flying back.

“We’ve found them!” shouted Long Chen.
