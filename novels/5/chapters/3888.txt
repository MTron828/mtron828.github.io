Chapter 3877 All-Out Assault

“What’s wrong?” asked Xia Chen.

“Don’t you feel like there are fewer people than expected?” responded Guo Ran.

Just as Guo Ran said, three days had passed, and this disturbance had definitely shaken the vast three thousand worlds. With their great talents, the peak experts possessed the ability to traverse the majority of the three thousand worlds to come here. However, Yin Changsheng, the Nine Underworld Luocha, and experts of their caliber were conspicuously absent.

What piqued Guo Ran’s curiosity the most was that even Long Aotian hadn’t come. Given the magnitude of this disturbance, it should have reverberated far and wide, reaching the corners of the three thousand worlds, drawing countless experts over.

“It’s not surprising. There are many treasure lands with special inheritances in the three thousand worlds. Perhaps the other experts have found great places, so they are ignoring the disturbance here. I guess those who came here either had no special inheritances to obtain or had simply abandoned their original treasure lands due to the huge disturbance here. But now that they’ve left, they probably won’t be able to get anything if they go back to those places. Anyway, spending all their time running around will only cause them to miss out on the surging primal chaos qi. Then they’ll have wasted this golden opportunity.” Xia Chen eyed the many experts around. They were glaring at Xia Chen and the others, wanting to come over yet not daring to.

There were also some who knew how to judge the situation and began to go for the other dragon corpses. Although the ones at the core had been occupied, there were still other corpses in the outer regions.

Although the primal chaos qi in that area wasn’t even a tenth of the core, they had no other choice. If they were to return to where they were from originally, they probably wouldn’t have a spot either.Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“So that’s the case.”

After hearing this, Guo Ran nodded. He felt that Xia Chen’s theory was reasonable. After all, the three thousand worlds had more than one treasure land.

They had just come from such a place with Mo Nian. In a tomb, they had obtained plenty of treasures, and the primal chaos qi there had also been abundant. Thus, they had been planning on just staying there to absorb that primal chaos qi.

However, after sensing Long Chen’s summons, Xia Chen and Guo Ran knew that they had to leave. Thus, they abandoned their treasure land and came here.

Perhaps others had simply decided not to abandon the places that they found. After all, who knew what the situation was like in other places? Furthermore, in most cases, it was better to find things that suited you. Some treasure lands contained different kinds of energy. Because of that, many experts would sense the specific energies that suited them and make those treasure lands their targets.

“No, that’s bad too!”

Guo Ran’s expression suddenly changed. “If that’s the case, what if they condense Heavenly Dao Crowns and then rush over here?”

Xia Chen said, “You’re right. That’s why we have to prepare in advance. Guard this place. I’ll set up formations to protect boss.”

Xia Chen then took out formation discs and embedded them in space. There were a total of one hundred and eight formation discs, like stars floating around the dragon scale.

Every formation disc also had one hundred and eight talismans inside of them. In total, they formed a giant grand formation protecting Long Chen.

As for Long Chen, his condition had changed. Now, the divine light around him was denser, and the golden light was like silk threads wrapping him. He was soon completely covered.

Every strand of that silk possessed boundless power and emitted a sacred aura. It was like a single strand of it could sever heaven and earth.

Xia Chen and Guo Ran didn’t know what Long Chen was experiencing, but they knew that he could not be disturbed.

One day, two days, three days… Ten days passed. More and more golden silk appeared around Long Chen. He was now fully wrapped in a golden cocoon.

The golden dragon scale’s aura finally began to fade, its energy pouring into this cocoon. Clearly, Long Chen had entered a critical state.

Not that far from Long Chen was an ancient, majestic palace. It seemed to exist beyond the cosmos, standing above the ten thousand Daos.

However, this was not a true palace but Mo Nian’s manifestation. He hadn’t occupied a dragon corpse. Instead, he was absorbing the terrifying primal chaos qi beside Long Chen.

After all, the dragon scale was the primal chaos source of the three thousand worlds, a place where the primal chaos qi was gushing out of the most. Long Chen couldn’t even absorb it all himself, which was why Mo Nian benefited from him, taking in the energy that Long Chen couldn’t absorb.

Also, Mo Nian didn’t stand on courtesy. He made sure to suck in every drop of primal chaos qi that Long Chen couldn’t absorb. It was all absorbed into the palace.

His manifestation was originally very indistinct, but as he absorbed all this primal chaos qi, it grew clearer. The roof, the doorposts, the marks on the brick walls, they all gradually became clear.

As the palace grew clearer, the signboard on the gate was particularly conspicuous. There, written in gilt, was the name Limitless Palace. Just that writing alone seemed to contain endless profundities, as if the energy inside of it was manifesting some great secret.

Mo Nian was seated before the gate where a pine tree stood tall. Most palaces seldom had trees adorning their gateways; instead, they were often adorned with majestic divine beast statues, standing guard with an imposing presence.

Even if they did plant a tree, there should be one on each side. But the Limitless Palace only had a single tree planted right in front of the gate, blocking the entrance. That was very much against normal aesthetics and fengshui. This peculiar arrangement piqued the curiosity of onlookers, leaving them unable to resist questioning its significance.

It was an enormous pine tree thousands of miles tall, but other than being large, it appeared really ordinary.

At this moment, drops of strange light fell from it, enveloping Mo Nian. Those drops of light were extremely bizarre, almost demonic, so when they fell on him, his slightly wretched face became even more wretched. Even the Limitless Palace’s sacred light could not conceal his wretchedness. This was something that people found very strange.

As the image of Limitless Palace grew more and more solid, the space on its edges began to collapse. It was as if the palace was being brought into reality, shattering the ten thousand Daos within its domain.

Other than Mo Nian, there were also Gu Yang, Li Qi, and Song Mingyuan. All their Blood Qis were soaring. Also, their bodies were swollen with power as if they might explode.

Countless cracks appeared on their skin, and light red blood slowly oozed out. Beneath those cracks, people could see golden blood flowing. That was the true dragon essence blood expelling their original essence blood, a complete blood exchange. They had also reached a critical juncture and were on the verge of switching out their blood.

Once their blood was switched out, they could start condensing Heavenly Dao Crowns. However, they took far more time than Guo Ran and Xia Chen. That proved that the potential of their physical bodies was far greater than theirs.

Suddenly, a group of lifeforms appeared in the distance. The world rumbled as they tore through the void. When Xia Chen and Guo Ran saw this group, they instantly tensed up and prepared to fight.

“This time, it’ll probably be an all-out assault.”
