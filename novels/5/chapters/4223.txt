Chapter 4212 Traitors of the Violet Blood Race

Following Xu Yifeng’s roar, the violet qi around him surged, forming a sea of violet qi. This violet qi even passed through the barrier around the martial stage.

The next moment, the entire Sage King Prefecture darkened. The land was cast in violet light.

“What a terrifying manifestation! It even passed through the martial stage’s barrier!”

“It lives up to being one of the strongest bloodlines of the nine heavens and ten lands. Anywhere the violet qi covers is his domain. Even the Heavenly Daos have submitted.”

“It really is incredible. This is the true unrivaled bloodline. I’ve never seen a person’s manifestation capable of causing such a disturbance.”

Xu Yifeng's manifestation left countless people astonished as it demonstrated the ability to pass through the barrier. Even the senior experts stood in stunned disbelief.

The fact that Xu Yifeng's manifestation could traverse the barrier implied that he could access the energy outside of the barrier. Meanwhile, those confined within were restricted to the power in it. In an instant, he had placed himself in an undefeatable position.

As the rumbling sound came from Xu Yifeng’s manifestation, a violet sea roared, sending huge waves soaring into the heavens. Its aura was suffocating.

Xu Yifeng locked eyes with Long Chen, who in turn focused not directly on Xu Yifeng but on the violet blood manifestation standing behind him. Long Chen’s gaze was sharp. He seemed to be pondering something.

As for Xu Yifeng, seeing him thinking, he actually thought that Long Chen was scared.

“What? Are you afraid? It might be too early for that. I’ve only taken out fifty percent of my power at most.”

“Bring out your full power. I don’t want to waste time. Otherwise, once I attack, you will only be able to feel regret in the other world,” said Long Chen as he pulled his gaze from Xu Yifeng’s manifestation and turned to look at him.

Xu Yifeng’s words were already shocking enough, but Long Chen’s words were even more arrogant. People couldn’t believe their ears. Just what were these fellows saying?

Xu Yifeng was not even in his combat state, but he was already this powerful. As for Long Chen, he said that in this state, Xu Yifeng would not be able to fight back once he attacked. He was even saying that Xu Yifeng would be directly killed.

Although they couldn’t say that Long Chen was simply bragging, they felt that this was too exaggerated. People refused to believe it and couldn’t accept it.

“Hahaha!” Xu Yifeng laughed. In his view, Long Chen had been stunned by his manifestation. For him to now say something so arrogant, he sneered, “You really are an ant who doesn’t know how high the heavens are. Even bragging has a limit. You are not qualified to be arrogant in front of me.”

Xu Yifeng finally made his move. Stamping on the air, he crossed the distance between them with a single step and smashed a fist down.

Even before his fist landed, countless cracks already appeared in the void. It was as if heaven and earth were unable to contain his power.

“Starry Sea…

Countless stars appeared within the divine ring behind Long Chen. They were like a sea of stars.

“... Births Violet Qi!”

Violet qi burst out of the starry sea, turning the stars violet. Long Chen had summoned his own manifestation. This was his first time summoning it ever since his Violet Tower Star had reached its peak.

As violet qi raged within the starry sea, Long Chen calmly unleashed his own fist. Despite attacking second, his fist arrived first.

BOOM!

With an explosive sound, the entire martial stage rocked like a boat on a stormy sea. The seawater around the martial stage became a tsunami crashing into the buildings on the land of the prefecture. Countless people were blasted by it.

When the seawater passed and the onlookers looked back at the martial stage, they gasped. The cracks on the martial stage beneath Long Chen’s feet had spread tens of thousands of miles. As for Xu Yifeng, he was blown back wretchedly, retreating eight steps before stabilizing himself.

“Look!”

Suddenly, someone pointed at the sky. At some point, above the nine heavens, stars had appeared, making this world feel as if it was beneath a sea of stars.

“Is this Long Chen’s manifestation?!”

People looked at the starry sea in the divine ring behind Long Chen and then at the sea of stars above them. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

Xu Yifeng’s manifestation was capable of spreading outside the barrier. That was shocking, but they felt that this was still understandable. After all, he possessed one of the strongest bloodlines of the nine heavens and ten lands.

However, Long Chen had no such thing, but he was still capable of summoning such a terrifying manifestation. Furthermore, people didn’t even know the origins of this manifestation.

Only the experts from the Starry River Sect looked at this sea of stars excitedly and reverently. They knew that this was the strongest manifestation of the Starry River Sect.

Xu Yifeng was forced to use his full power just to stabilize himself, causing the ground beneath him to erupt. This time, he was genuinely infuriated, feeling like he was being toyed with. His confidence was given a blow.

“Watch out!”

When Xu Xin-er’s startled cry rang out in his ear, he felt a chill behind him. Almost instinctively, he threw himself to the side.

Just as he retreated, a golden dragon claw appeared in front of him. Had he been even slightly slower, it would have torn through him,

Everyone was startled. They then looked to see that Long Chen was still in the distance, so their first thought was that someone had launched a sneak attack on Xu Yifeng.

However, they quickly realized that the master of the dragon claw was precisely Long Chen. At this moment, a pair of golden wings materialized on Long Chen’s back. Those were Kunpeng wings.

When they saw this, that Long Chen standing in the distance vanished from their sight. It was nothing more than an afterimage.

“How can this be?! How can he have such terrifying speed?!” People were stunned, especially the experts outside.

Long Chen hadn’t used illusory or bewildering techniques. His speed was just so fast that it had broken the limits of perception.

The Xu family's experts, along with those from the demonic beast and Kunpeng races, all had their expressions change when they saw Long Chen's wings. It was clear to them that Long Chen had refined a pair of Kunpeng wings. This was a disgrace to the Kunpeng race.

Long Chen’s attack shook heaven and earth, yet his face was still calm. At this moment, everyone could see specks of violet blood staining his palm.

Long Chen slowly raised his hand and sniffed the violet blood on it. In an instant, his killing intent rose to the peak.

“As expected, you really have betrayed the Violet Blood race. Then there’s nothing to say. You can all just die!”

Long Chen’s Kunpeng wings quivered. Like an ancient beast, countless afterimages appeared in the air as he shot after Xu Yifeng.
