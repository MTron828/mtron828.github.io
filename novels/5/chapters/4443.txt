Chapter 4432 Guo Ran vs. Half-Step Doyen

As Bai Xiaole swiftly formed hand seals, the Violet Pupil Nine Tail Fox on his shoulder also had the three-flower image swirling in its eyes—identical to Bai Xiaole’s.

Their combined power managed to capture that half-step Doyen. While the latter managed to escape the spatial bindings, he was already dragged over to the Dragonblood Legion’s.

Considering the anger the Dragonblood warriors felt toward this fellow, letting him go was out of the question.

Guo Ran was the first to attack. As his battle armor manifested on him, he swung his golden sabers at the half-step Doyen. The latter was shocked, not expecting the Dragonblood Legion to scheme against him. With a furious roar, he summoned a divine light out of him, and a sword appeared in his hand.

BOOM!

Divine light illuminated the sky as both the half-step Doyen and Guo Ran were knocked back at the same time, causing ripples in the void.

This left countless onlookers in astonishment as they gazed at the formidable figure of Guo Ran in his armored state.

They hadn’t expected that even without Long Chen’s interference, one of his subordinates would be able to match evenly against a budding Heavenly Doyen.

The half-step Doyen seethed with rage. Before this, he had been prepared to challenge Long Chen, but now, one of Long Chen’s subordinates proved sufficient to handle him. This was an absolute disgrace.

“Die!”

In his fury, he somehow harnessed a fraction of a Doyen’s power, and heavenly might erupted out of his manifestation.

Gripping his sword with both hands, this fellow exerted such power that his Eternal divine weapon rumbled explosively. Seeing his scene, the onlookers were shocked to see that he was actually capable of unleashing the true might of an Eternal divine weapon.

Oddly enough, he was simply a World King—a vast distance away from the Eternal realm. Thus, he naturally didn’t have the Eternal energy to truly unleash the power of an Eternal divine weapon.

If he was using the power of a Doyen in place of Eternal energy, then perhaps he could activate the power of an Eternal divine weapon. However, the cost of doing that was immense. At most, he would be able to unleash such an attack twice.

In other words, he was planning on deciding victory or defeat right at the start against one of Long Chen’s subordinates. It seemed that he had quite the temper.

“If an idiot like you is still alive, why would I die?”

Guo Ran didn’t retreat. Against this full-power attack, he shot forward. When his imitation Kunpeng wings appeared, Long Chen noticed a pair of foreign immortal characters on them.

BOOM!

In front of everyone’s eyes, their weapons clashed in an explosion of divine light. Many believed that Guo Ran would be obliterated by the power of an Eternal divine weapon, but then a shocking scene unfolded.

Guo Ran’s Kunpeng wings unleashed two rays of divine light that were like sharp swords piercing the heavens.

“That’s…?”

This time, even those familiar with Guo Ran were surprised. They had never seen such a technique before.

“He is actually dispelling the half-step Doyen’s power!” exclaimed one of the World Kings of the Jiang clan as rays of divine light shot out of Guo Ran’s wings.

From a distance, they could see that the half-step Doyen’s power was being split in two by Guo Ran and injected into the void. Two huge holes were left in the void—black as ink and filled with spatial blades, resembling the eyes of a fiend.

This World King was one of the two budding Doyens of the Jiang clan. Now, their arrogance had vanished, replaced with shock.

“Long Chen has such a terrifying subordinate? What’s his name?” asked the other budding Doyen.

He clearly directed the question to Feng Fei, but she merely gave him the cold shoulder. The two had clearly shown disdain toward her. Now after witnessing Guo Ran in action, they expected her to answer their questions? Seeing this, Feng Fei just sneered. She had given them a reminder out of the kindness of her heart, only to be snubbed. Did they now comprehend the terrifying power of the Dragonblood Legion?

“Feng Fei, you-” That budding Doyen got angry.

“Just watch!” Jiang Wenyu interrupted him, not wanting the Jiang clan to start fighting amongst themselves. Otherwise, they would be laughingstocks.

Although Feng Fei had not yet become a budding Doyen, her status was unique. With the backing of the clan’s patriarch, even Jiang Wenyu didn’t dare to be too disrespectful to her.

The only reason Jiang Wenyu had greeted Long Chen was that the patriarch had told him not to get into Long Chen’s bad side.Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

As a peak heavenly genius of the Jiang clan that had been sealed back in the ancient era, Jiang Wenyu was an unrivaled existence in his clan. However, the patriarch wanted him to not provoke Long Chen? With his pride, Jiang Wenyu was naturally displeased. Even so, just because he was a bit unhappy didn’t mean that he dared to go against the patriarch’s orders.

If he wanted to one day lead the clan, other than the support of the council, he also needed the approval of the patriarch. As a result, Jiang Wenyu didn’t dare to ignore the Jiang patriarch’s orders.

Not only members of the Jiang clan were astonished, but everyone present shared the sentiment. Although Guo Ran was using a trick to redirect his opponent’s power, that kind of power wasn’t something just anyone could redirect. In battles between experts, every move held purpose—there were no mere coincidences.

That half-step Doyen was astounded by the sight. His unleashed power surged forth like a torrent of wild horses, yet it proved ineffective against Guo Ran, causing no harm. He immediately pulled back to reduce the strain on him.

“Idiot!”

Seeing him suddenly retract his power, numerous experts shook their heads. This person’s actual fighting experience was far too lacking.

As expected, the moment he pulled back, the divine light shooting out of Guo Ran’s wings vanished. In response, various runes lit up all over Guo Ran, and he shoved his sabers forward, summoning a surge of energy that hurtled toward the half-step Doyen. Like a kite whose string was cut, the latter tumbled backward, blood spraying out of his mouth.

“What an idiot. The reason for his loss is so stupid.” Many experts cursed upon seeing this scene.

Someone aspiring to become a Heavenly Doyen actually committed such a basic mistake. With this glaring opening, Guo Ran directly inflicted a significant injury to the half-step Doyen, conclusively sealing the outcome of the battle.

“Damn bastard, you only rely on your tortoise shell and some tricks! Just wait, next time, I’ll blow that tortoise shell apart!” the half-step Doyen cursed furiously.

His defeat left a bad taste, and he refused to accept it. However, it didn’t matter what he felt. Having utilized his Doyen power to wield an Eternal divine weapon, he was now depleted of energy.

Seeing Guo Ran coming after him, he snorted, and Heavenly Dao energy flowed around him. With a burst of divine light, he vanished.

Just as he did, a streak of sword-light fell, slicing apart the divine light that filled the sky.
