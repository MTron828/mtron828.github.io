Chapter 3537

“Big brother Long Chen, up ahead on the left side. It says that there is the nest of a seventh Heavenstage World King Heavenly Flame Spirit.”

“Big brother Long Chen, wait a moment. There’s an underground flame river up ahead. You’ll get washed away as soon as you step on it. We have to wait until it calms first…”

The little fox repeatedly chattered away while Huo Linger translated. This little fox had clearly figured out the way home and was clear on where the danger was.

Furthermore, it explained the terrain of the surroundings as well. As a result, they essentially gained a map of this region.

The little fox had been here for countless years, so it was very familiar with the terrains and Heavenly Flame Spirits here. Long Chen was delighted by this. With this map, he found that there were many treasures to be taken. However, first he had to send the fox home.

Through the fox’s pointers, Long Chen was constantly avoiding the more terrifying existences. Against the weaker ones, Long Chen directly devoured them.

The little fox said that it wasn’t afraid of those terrifying existences because they all ignored it.

It was only Heavenly Flame Spirits at the third Heavenstage and below that would try to kill it. It was always forced to flee in terror by those fellows, causing it to miss its chance to return home. Every time, he could only watch as the exit back to his home vanished.

The laws of the Heavenly Flame World didn’t seem quite the same as what Long Chen had imagined. There were terrifying existences here that could get along with the weaker ones. The weak Heavenly Flame Spirits actually weren’t afraid of those stronger ones.

That was because after they grew to a certain level, they would no longer devour the weak. Thus, there was no conflict between the strongest and the weakest Heavenly Flame Spirits.

Due to that law, there were weak Heavenly Flame Spirits everywhere. It was those weaker ones that became the little fox’s bane, cutting off its path home.

However, Long Chen still had to be careful. While those terrifying existences might accept weak little Heavenly Flame Spirits, they would not permit a human in their territory. Once they sensed him, that would spell trouble.

As he approached the depths of the whirlpool, he found that the flame energy grew even more terrifying. Sometimes, he wouldn’t even need the little fox’s warning before he sensed some aura that made his hair stand on end.

The further they went, the more terrifying the Heavenly Flame Spirits got. In fact, Long Chen even saw a Heavenly Flame Spirit with nine kinds of runes on its body sleeping soundly on top of a mountain.

That was equivalent to a ninth Heavenstage World King. When it snored, Long Chen’s soul almost fled. Furthermore, more and more of those ninth Heavenstage Heavenly Flame Spirits appeared. The little fox said that the exit was right behind them.

Long Chen even started to regret it a bit. This was practically playing with his life. Why had he agreed to this? But an agreement was an agreement, so he forced himself through. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

Fortunately, those ninth Heavenstage Heavenly Flame Spirits were all in slumber. As long as he didn’t make any noise, he wouldn’t disturb them.

Long Chen did a quick count. There were hundreds of such Heavenly Flame Spirits. On his way here, he had also killed a few dozen of weaker Heavenly Flame Spirits, but that had not disturbed these terrifying existences.

Finally, one day later, Long Chen saw a spatial gate up ahead. This spatial gate had golden flames spurting out of it. After that, Long Chen saw a giant golden dragon slumbering there, allowing the golden flames to wash over its body. It looked like it was enjoying a bath.

“Not good. The little fox says that this Heavenly Flame Spirit is now awake, so it can’t get back,” said Huo Linger.

“Didn’t it say that more powerful Heavenly Flame Spirits won’t make things hard on it?” asked Long Chen.

“It says that this is a terrifying king of the Heavenly Flame Spirits. Based on the human race’s realms, it should belong to the Divine Venerate realm. It won’t attack the little fox, but just its pressure alone will crush the little fox. With it at the exit, the little fox can’t get through,” said Huo Linger.

Long Chen looked at the little fox. As expected, he saw a disappointed expression. It was on his shoulder with paws over its eyes as if it was crying. Just as success was right before it, it sank into despair. That feeling was truly unbearable.

“Don’t cry. There are always more solutions than problems. I’ll think of a way to get you through,” said Long Chen.

The little fox shook its head and continued crying. Huo Linger said, “It says that there is no solution. That Heavenly Flame Spirit king is attracted by the golden flames. It is absorbing them to raise its cultivation base, so it won’t leave. If we try to force our way through, the three of us will die. It doesn’t want to implicate us, so it says to give up.”

Seeing how hard the little fox was crying, Long Chen also didn’t know what he was feeling inside. He was currently thinking as he eyed that dragon.

This was a twin-winged vile dragon, one of the more fearful dragon species.

However, since it wasn’t a lifeform of flesh and blood, Long Chen’s dragon pressure would not have any effect on it.

It was standing right in front of the gate with its mouth open, absorbing the golden flames coming out. If they wanted to get through the gate, they had to walk over its body.

“I’ll try it!”

Long Chen thought for a long time and was unable to think of any solutions. Thus, he chose to stop thinking and just walk over!

“The little fox says that it’s too dangerous. Don’t try,” said Huo Linger.

Long Chen looked at the little fox. It was crying as it looked at him, seemingly unwilling to let him die.

Long Chen smiled and rubbed its head comfortingly. No matter what, he would have to try. Giving up like this was not his style.

He stealthily slipped close to the two-winged vile dragon. As he did, his hair stood on end. Its power was truly terrifying. It was like a volcano, and if the slightest bit of its power was unleashed, he would be blown to bits.

Fortunately, it was focused on the golden flames and didn’t pay attention to them. Long Chen then had Huo Linger also absorb some of those golden flames so that she could cover their auras. That way, they wouldn’t be sensed so easily.

Long Chen quickly reached the vile dragon’s tail. This was an incredibly long tail, almost half the length of the entire vile dragon.

He didn’t know what species this vile dragon was. If it weren’t for this long tail, it would look more like a bat. At the end of this tail was a giant bone stinger that was like a spear, flickering with cold light.

Fortunately, Long Chen and the others were as tiny as ants in front of it. As they cautiously progressed, they didn’t draw its attention.

However, once they climbed onto its back, Long Chen sensed an immense pressure that was growing greater. Furthermore, the golden flames were gushing out here, which was also pressing him back. He had no choice but to use his astral power just to protect himself.

Long Chen continued climbing up the dragon’s back. He saw the gate right before him, but it was at this moment that the dragon’s eyes opened.

“Fuck!”

Long Chen instantly tossed out the net around the dragon and shot toward the gate like a shooting star.
