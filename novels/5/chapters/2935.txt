Chapter 2924 Victory

Mu Qingyun and the other disciples of the Unfettered Alliance were covered in blood, but in their hands was the flag. They stood on the altar in victory.

As for the Prime Glory Alliance’s disciples, they had been killed. When Long Chen and Chu Kuang broke the formation, it made it impossible for them to admit defeat and be transported out.

After breaking inside and killing them, the Unfettered Alliance set up their own barrier and lit the lamps up, obtaining the flag. Only then did the barrier go down.

However, when the barrier went down, it revealed a completely deformed battlefield. It was no longer recognizable.

“Where are we?”

“Did we die?”

“No, we can’t be dead, right? Are we in spiritual states?”

“Brother San!”

Mu Qingyun spotted Long Chen’s black figure and cried out.

“Brother San has also died?”

“What nonsense is that? None of us is dead.”

Just at this moment, multiple figures entered the battlefield. Those were the ones in charge of healing the injured as well as cleaning up the battlefield. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

Chu Huairen and the other magistrate were chained by a group of law enforcement disciples and carried away. However, before leaving, they both glared at Long Chen. Despite not saying anything, their sinister gazes said everything for them. The Chu family would not rest when it came to its vengeance against him.

Being glared at by them, Long Chen cursed, “What are you staring at?! Didn’t you promise me ten thousand beauties? I gave you half, so you should give me half at least. Why are you reneging now? Didn’t you say that the Chu family never broke its promises? That your word is gold? Peh, how shameless.”

The two of them almost coughed up blood. Was there anyone more shameless than Long Chen in the world? He had already killed Chu Kuang yet came to them with demands for beauties?

“Head judge, many thanks.” Once the two of them were dragged away, Long Chen cupped his fists to the head judge.

“I should be the one thanking you. Hopefully, some tumors have been removed this time. Little brother, you’re very powerful. You have limitless potential. Most important of all, you have that unbending Dao-heart. That’s the core of a man. You’ve revealed your outstanding talent this time, but be careful. The tree that stands highest in the forest is the one buffeted by the most destructive wind. You will have to face even greater challenges in the future.” The head judge patted Long Chen’s shoulder.

Long Chen’s power had truly surpassed his expectations. Hence, he was admiring his senior brother Zhan Feng more and more. That day, he had sent the head judge a spiritual message to take note of Long Chen and that his potential was shocking. The head judge had also felt that Long Chen was very powerful, but he had definitely not expected Long Chen to have reached this level. He was practically a monster.

“Hehe, it’s fine. Since I dare to excel, I’m not afraid of the wind,” said Long Chen.

“I have to leave now. I will report this to the institute head, and hopefully the two of them will be removed,” said the head judge, vanishing.

At this moment, others ran over, quivering with fear. “Boss San!”

“What is it? Hurry up,” said Long Chen impatiently.

“Uh, about the head. Can you hand it over to us? It’s one of the rules of the competition…” said that disciple fearfully.

“Why would I want this thing? You can have it. With how pale you look, I think you should use it for soup to replenish your Blood Qi.” Chen tossed Chu Kuang’s head to him.

The reason why Long Chen had wanted to keep Chu Kuang’s head was because he was worried Chu Kuang might have some secret art to continue surviving as just a head. He had been planning on testing it a few times.

However, Chu Huairen hadn’t fought for the head, so he had clearly been worried for nothing. For someone in the Mortal Transcendence to lose their head, they could only die.

That disciple fearfully received the head, and his face really was frighteningly pale. Using a person’s head for soup? Disgusting.

After that, another disciple gave him a transportation talisman. When he crushed it, Long Chen was brought back to the plaza.

When he reappeared, he could no longer see the ruined battlefield. This place had been returned to its original appearance. The spectators had also left.

Only Luo Bing, Luo Ning, and the disciples of the Unfettered Alliance remained. Mu Qingyun was the first to run over and grab Long Chen’s hand, excitedly crying out, “Brother San, we won! We won! We’re inner academy disciples!”

This victory was hard-won. They had lost all hope of winning multiple times but had successfully won thanks to their efforts.

Mu Qingyun was so emotional that her eyes were wet. Long Chen said, “This is the path of cultivation. Once you step onto it, there is no other choice. You must continue to advance. Live better. Cultivate better. You have to rise to even higher places in place of your fallen brothers. You must see even better scenery so that they can be proud of you.”

Mu Qingyun and the others nodded. This one battle had made them grow. Battlefields were there to truly temper people. Today, they had gone through an important transformation of their lifetime.

“Long Chen, thank you.” At this moment, Luo Bing walked over.

Long Chen had declined the Chu family’s enticement, even killing Chu Kuang despite their threats. He was now truly mortal enemies with the Chu family. A large part of that was because of Luo Bing and Luo Ning, so her gratitude toward Long Chen could not be expressed with just a single thanks. But she also didn’t know what else to say.

“No need to thank me. The main thing is that I simply didn’t believe that old fellow’s lies. How could I possibly believe that he could find ten thousand beauties like you? Does he think I’m a fool? I’d have definitely slapped him if I could.” Long Chen laughed.

Luo Bing and Luo Ning also laughed. This fellow really knew how to talk.

After the battle, everyone went to rest. After all, Long Chen was quite tired. That final attack had used up all his energy.

He didn’t know what was going on, but in the immortal world, the power of the World Extermination Flame Lotus had grown to the point that it almost couldn’t be controlled. Even he was injured by it.

It seemed that the flame essence in the immortal world was too dense, so a huge amount of energy was absorbed by it in just an instant.

Long Chen almost didn’t dare to imagine what would happen if he also activated the Nirvana Scripture. Would that explode himself?

After returning to his house, Long Chen installed some alerting formations around. He then summoned Huo Long as a bodyguard for himself. The Chu family’s presence within the academy was too great for him to assume that he wouldn’t be sneak attacked.

After setting that up, he simply fell asleep, and this sleep lasted three days and nights. If Mu Qingyun hadn’t come, he would have continued sleeping.

“Brother San, we’re going to the inner academy to check in,” said Mu Qingyun. She had a new set of robes on her.
