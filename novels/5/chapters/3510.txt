Long Chen originally didn’t want to kill people, but he felt like the dark energy inside his body was starting to grow active again.

If he continued to endure, that dark energy would continuously accumulate. Furthermore, this dark energy was the nutrition that his heart-devil used to grow.

If he wanted to contain the growth of his heart-devil, he had to calm his mind, and he shouldn’t keep his negative emotions inside. It was the only way to suppress his heart-devil and control it.

Although he had the mission to destroy the Devil Peering Mirror, he couldn’t neglect his own growth either. He had to do both things at once.

His original plan was to sneak into the Nine Underworld Hall, but now that he knew about the details, there was no way he could do it. If he wanted to enter the Nine Underworld Hall, he would have to be a disciple of the Nine Underworld Hall.

All the disciples had to offer worship to the hall master. To have Long Chen kneel to Liao Bencang? How could that be possible?

Furthermore, the Nine Underworld Hall’s people were assassins, so the rules were very strict. Ignoring whether or not he could muddle his way in, even if he could, it would require too many preparations. He didn’t have that much time.

Right now, Long Chen didn’t have any plans, so he could only take things step by step. He also knew that even without the matter with the Soaring Dragon Company, there was no way he could conceal his tracks.

The Nine Underworld Hall’s information network was top tier. As long as he appeared somewhere, the Nine Underworld Hall couldn’t possibly fail to find out, unless he disguised his status by changing his appearance…

Unfortunately, he found himself having an extremely bad reaction toward such conduct. He didn’t know if he detested it personally, or if that untouchable, arrogant will inside his soul refused to allow him to do so.

Ultimately, he chose to descend upon the Violet Flame Heaven under the identity of Boss Long San. As for the rest, he wasn’t in the mood to think that much.

The Chaotic Star Sea, also called the Chaotic Star-Field, had thirty-seven prefectures, four seas, six islands, and eleven chaos domains.

The so-called chaos domains were places where space was unstable. All kinds of energy mixed together there, and many experts crossed heavens specifically to come to the chaos domains. As long as they could grasp the energies that appeared there, they could use them to temper themselves.

These energies were said to be the source energies from which the nine heavens and ten lands were produced. Comprehending these energies was extremely beneficial, as they allowed one to peer into the mysterious workings of the nine heavens. Legend had it that once a person comprehended this secret, it was essentially like controlling the true Heavenly Daos. They would be able to control all the energies of the nine heavens and ten lands, becoming the master of the world.

However, the chaos domains were very dangerous. One moment, it might be like spring with flowers blooming and life energy thrumming. But the next moment, a star might fall on you, and lava might burst out of the sky. If you had bad luck, a merciless storm could suddenly descend and seal everything in ice.

Legend had it that the chaos domains were created by the chaotic flows of an ancient battle. The laws of the nine heavens had yet to heal even now, so it could be said that the chaos domains were one of the wounds left behind on the nine heavens and ten lands. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

However, this wound also brought endless opportunities to people. Even though they were very dangerous, cultivators continued to throw themselves toward them.

Long Chen went directly to a place called the Yu Prefecture. He had learned that this was a peaceful place because it was controlled by the entity that he was very familiar with, the Huayun Trading Company.

Right now, the thing that gave him the greatest sense of ease from outside was the Huayun Trading Company. Even so, Zheng Wenlong still had many things to deal with in the Darklight Heaven, so he had to finish those things before he could follow Long Chen.

However, he said that any business in the Huayun Trading Company could be trusted. Long Chen could be brazen enough to do his regular large-scale trades.

Although the success of those trades would have nothing to do with Zheng Wenlong, he didn’t mind. He had to first deal with all the things on his plate before he could leave. Long Chen had also given him many things to do in the Darklight Heaven. Hence, he truly didn’t have the ability to follow Long Chen into the Violet Flame Heaven yet.

When Long Chen entered the Yu Prefecture, he could clearly feel that the atmosphere was completely different. The people walking the streets were mostly amicable. There were no random fights or brawls on the streets, or people trying to come up and scam you.

Furthermore, in front of the transportation formation were disciples of the Huayun Trading Company patiently explaining the situation of the Yu Prefecture to newcomers. They would answer all questions, and there was nothing to nitpick about their attitude.

However, not that far away, Long Chen also saw four cold-faced experts with weapons on their backs. Long Chen smiled. Those were for the people who didn’t respect the rules.

Once everyone else was done asking their questions, Long Chen stepped forward. “I want to see your president.”

Long Chen handed over a tablet to a woman, and she was startled when she saw it. She hastily said, “Sir is a violet-gold guest of the Huayun Trading Company. My apologies, I’ll immediately ask for the president to come by.”

“No need. I’m old friends with your Huayun Trading Company, and there’s no need for all those manners. I’m just looking for someone, so if you could just bring me over to them, that will save us a great deal of time,” said Long Chen.

This violet-gold card was the only one in Zheng Wenlong’s possession. It was the most precious V.I.P. card that he could give. At his level, he was only authorized to give away a single one. With this card, Long Chen could ask for help from anywhere the Huayun Trading Company existed. As long as it didn’t betray the Huayun Trading Company’s principles, they definitely wouldn’t reject him.

Long Chen was quickly sent to the Huayun Trading Company’s headquarters in the Yu Prefecture. After that, Long Chen was surprised to see that their president was actually a woman who looked to be in her thirties.

“So sir is mister Long Chen. I didn’t expect sir to be such a promising youngster. Meeting you today is the blessing of three lifetimes. This little one is Qi Fang, greetings to mister Long Chen.” This World King didn’t stand on any airs. Although she was a woman, she didn’t put on any affectation, simply polite and poised. When she smiled in particular, it was like a spring breeze, feeling very amiable.

“President Qi Fang is courteous. This little one is a newcomer and will need to ask for some extra care. May I ask how you learned this little one’s name?” asked Long Chen.

Qi Fang laughed. “There are only three thousand and six hundred violet-gold cards that the Huayun Trading Company distributed. The majority are given to sects and major families and such, and only two hundred and seventeen are given to specific people. We keep a record of every violet-gold card, and as president, I must firmly memorize that record. After all, you are the people that we depend on for our livelihood. I wouldn’t dare to neglect you. Other than that, have you forgotten? You asked us to disseminate a certain piece of information before.”

Long Chen smiled. The Huayun Trading Company’s people truly had a good upbringing. No matter what their status, they gave people a very comfortable feeling.

After that, the two of them sat down, and Qi Fang personally poured tea for Long Chen. He thought about stopping her, but he felt like that would be awkward. Qi Fang smiled and said that it was fine, so Long Chen could only thank her.

“Mister Long Chen, you did some heaven-shaking things as soon as you set foot in the Violet Flame Heaven. You destroyed the Soaring Dragon Company’s dock and their stronghold in the Evergreen Prefecture. You even plundered several of their strongholds. I simply prostrate myself in admiration toward you. Let me use this tea as wine to toast to you.” Qi Fang raised her teacup toward Long Chen.

Long Chen was startled. The Huayun Trading Company’s information network was so vast. They actually knew all of this. Long Chen then raised his cup, touching it to Qi Fang’s cup before drinking it.

“Hahaha, amazing, absolutely amazing!”

Qi Fang suddenly laughed wantonly, and her refined air completely vanished. Long Chen was startled.

“My apologies. Seeing the Soaring Dragon Company suffer such a loss, I’m just too happy. They’ve finally faced their tribulation.” Qi Fang hastily reigned in her emotions when she saw Long Chen looking at her oddly.

“It seems that you knew about the matter of the Fiend Devil Eye?” Long Chen looked at Qi Fang in disbelief.
