Chapter 4005 Beginning Soul Refinement

Could it be that this wasn’t a puppet? Long Chen stood in front of this expert, sensing his powerful Supreme fluctuations.

“Inferior human race, you dare to enslave the mighty winged devil race?! You will be cursed for eternity, rotting away in pain, forever vanishing from this world!” roared the winged devil.Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

“No, he can’t see me. He’s still a puppet…” Long Chen looked at the latter’s lifeless eyes and murmured to himself.

“Damnable human race, you’ve blasphemed the mighty winged devil race! You will pay a painful price for your foolishness!”

The winged devil continued to roar furiously. However, as it repeatedly cursed and roared, it kept repeating the same things.

He kept saying the same things as he walked around, not even looking at Long Chen.

When Long Chen walked forward a few steps, that winged devil’s body suddenly quivered and his eyes glared at Long Chen. Within those lifeless eyes, a flame-like diagram appeared.

“Die!”

The winged devil roared and shot toward Long Chen, its claws like hooks aiming for his head.

The claws were as quick as lightning and emitted an ear-piercing explosion. However, Long Chen snorted and simply punched away his claws.

As a result, the winged devil’s claws were shattered, but bloody marks appeared on Long Chen’s fist.

“My defenses are finally broken.”

Looking at the wounds on his hands, Long Chen finally knew how far his physical body had been strengthened.

A Supreme Divine Venerate winged devil using his sharpest claws was barely able to penetrate his defenses. That was a reality that he found hard to believe.

If it was before, such an attack would require him to summon the Dragon Blood Battle Armor, and even then, he would not dare to receive it with just his body. He would definitely use his Minghong Saber.

However, it merely caused some bloody marks now, while his opponent’s claws were directly shattered. So, it was clear that he still had an absolute advantage in terms of power and defense.

The winged devil roared and his wings quivered, slashing down like blades.

Long Chen then blocked eight of its attacks. These wings were able to pierce his skin but unable to slice apart his muscles, let alone reach his bones.

“Now my physical body really is unrivaled.”

Long Chen was overjoyed as he fought. This winged devil’s claws and wings were comparable to the strongest World Domain divine items. However, his basic attacks were unable to cause Long Chen any substantial injuries.

In the end, the winged devil’s claws and wings were torn apart. Just like before, Long Chen didn’t kill his opponent, leaving them for Yu Qingxuan and the others. One reason was as a warning to them about these opponents, while the other was to tell them that he was still doing well up ahead.

As he continued onward, more winged devils appeared. Sometimes, there would be two together or even three. But Long Chen always tore off a wing or cut off an arm before continuing onward, leaving the injured ones for the royal disciples to face.

That way, the level of danger would drop, but the enemies’ actual combat power wouldn’t be reduced too much, making it a good trial for the imperial disciples.

As Long Chen ascended to the seventh step, he was confronted not only by the formidable winged devils but also by a host of other powerful devil races. All of them were very powerful.

Long Chen rushed through them and crippled the dangerous ones. Only when he felt like they no longer had the power to one-shot Zhu Yifeng and the others did he continue.

On the eighth and ninth steps, the devil experts were in groups, and there were tens of thousands of them. Even Long Chen had no choice but to activate the Dragon Blood Battle Armor. Only in this state could he prevent himself from being drowned by their numbers.

Against so many of them, even Long Chen was left disoriented and lost. He tried to break through their formation several times without reaching the tenth step. He was repeatedly forced back.

It was because Long Chen didn’t wish to kill them all. He didn’t know if that would cause them to vanish and not be replaced. If he killed them all, the imperial disciples would have no training partners, and it might ruin their advancement.

Having reached the sixth level, Long Chen could already tell the tempo of the trial. Every level had good things inside with a steady increase in difficulty that pushed people just the right amount. He couldn’t ruin it and pull any cheap tricks, or the others might not be able to pass the further levels.

After a couple of tries, Long Chen finally managed to charge through the devil experts. When he reached the tenth step, the violent pressure once more appeared.

The devil experts here had gone from the initial Divine Venerate realm to the peak of the Divine Venerate realm. Although they were not Double Supremes, peak Divine Venerates still had terrifying power.

The worst thing about this level was the immense pressure that Long Chen was under, while the devil experts remained unaffected. As soon as he stepped up, several devil experts attacked him.

Hence, he retreated to the nine steps, but the devils there attacked him directly. Keeping his calm, he fought off those devils on the ninth step, took a breath, and returned to the tenth step.

As soon as he did, it was like lead was poured through his body, causing his speed to plummet and his reactions to slow down. But his opponents were still as quick as lightning.

As a result, Long Chen didn’t even last a single breath’s time before being forced back. He didn’t even manage to remember what those attacking devils looked like.

“It’s too difficult just being by myself. The pressure is all concentrated on me,” cursed Long Chen.

He had a thought to throw off the heavy equipment. That would reduce the pressure and increase his speed. However, he kept them on. If he took them off, the effect of this trial would plummet, and there was also his face to consider. Hence, he gritted his teeth and continued.

Golden scales covered his entire body as he attacked the devils on the tenth step. Their weapons struck his body, causing his Blood Qi to surge and churn within him.

However, Long Chen clenched his teeth and persevered. Although it was difficult fighting while he was slower than them, this trained his reaction speeds and perception.

In the end, Long Chen was able to last an hour on the tenth step, but he was still forced back to rest. That wild tempest of attacks drained his energy.

At this time, Yu Qingxuan and the others had yet to reach the sixth step. But based on Long Chen’s estimation, they should have reached the fifth step.

After resting a bit, Long Chen prepared to attack the tenth step once more when the dragon expert spoke to him.

“Enter the next phase. Start the soul refinement!”
