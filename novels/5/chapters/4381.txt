Chapter 4370 The Strongest Clash

Even in front of over eighty Eternal experts gathering their power, Long Chen’s expression didn’t change. He simply walked to the front and looked at them coldly.

Numerous onlookers were shocked by his words. Just what was going on? Was this whole setup really just to scare Long Chen and the others away? That didn’t seem like it.

The Great Desolate World’s Eternal experts were quivering. Their Blood Qi was pouring out of them and entering that divine bird, causing the bird’s destructive aura to constantly grow.

“Idiot, even in the face of death, you still dare to act tough. Our combined power is unstoppable by anyone in this world. All of you will die!” roared an Eternal expert.

“But if you scram now, you’ll still have a chance to live.” The Eternal expert suddenly added an extra line that stunned the onlookers.

What was going on? After preparing this terrifying move, the Great Desolate World’s experts wanted them to run? Were they really so kindhearted?

“When you slaughtered the human race, did you give them a chance to live? I already said, ‘Today is the day we settle all our debts.’ You owe the human race a debt, and I’ll be taking it from you, including the interest. A blood debt must be paid in blood. Don’t even think about getting away. With the Dragonblood Legion here, either you all die, or we all die. There is no third choice,” said Long Chen.

“Stubborn pig! Since you want to die so badly, we’ll just kill you all!” shouted that Eternal expert.

All of a sudden, the Eternal experts of the Great Desolate World exuded a pillar of light that flowed into the Eternal divine bird in the sky. That light then formed a bridge that connected all of their energy.

“They’re using the laws of the Heavenly Daos to merge their power into one! Only Heavenly Dao energy can bridge the gap between different races to merge their power,” said Xia Chen gravely.

“Have they become the master of this world? Otherwise, how could they control the power of the Heavenly Daos?” asked Bai Xiaole.

“That’s impossible. If they were the masters of this world, we would have been powerless to fight them,” said Bai Shishi.

No matter how strong a person was, how could they fight the very world? Furthermore, these Eternal experts simply didn’t have the power to gain control over this world.

Although they might be able to cross the gap between their races to merge their power, Bai Shishi refused to believe that they had gained control over the Great Desolate World.

In that moment, an increasing surge of power welled up within the Eternal divine bird. A horrifying pressure altered the color of the world, sending shivers down even the spines of the Dragonblood warriors. Never before had they witnessed such overwhelming and terrifying force.

“Fools! Do you really want to die?” cursed that Eternal expert.

“I understand! This move is a sacrificial technique! After this, all of them will die!” exclaimed Guo Ran suddenly.

After he said this, the others also understood. It was no wonder they had been holding back the entire time and were just accumulating power instead of unleashing it. So, they were trying to scare Long Chen and the others away.

This was a desperate gambit, an action they were unwilling to face the repercussions of. They were just trying to scare Long Chen and his companions away.

Long Chen had long since seen through this play. According to his calculations, if they were to unleash this move, that divine bird would definitely die as the core of this power, and the others would at least be on the verge of death, if not actually dead. They would no longer have the power to keep fighting.

At that time, even if Long Chen and the others were slain, the rest of the Nirvana Overflow Heaven’s people could simply come and wipe them out. Then the Great Desolate World would be under the rule of the human race.

“Bastards, all of you can die!”

The divine bird’s wings spread, and a blazing sun appeared in its beak.Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Buzz.

An overwhelming aura of impending death suddenly enveloped everyone on Long Chen's side. Numerous hearts in the group trembled in fear, and this triggered their instinct to flee. However, witnessing Long Chen and the others standing firm, they gritted their teeth and resisted the urge to run.

“Since you refuse to make your move, we won’t stand on courtesy. Guo Ran, start your performance.”

Long Chen turned to Guo Ran, and he instantly understood. After his battle armor lit up, he crossed his sabers in front of him.

“Can you do it?” whispered Long Chen.

“It’ll be no problem,” said Guo Ran confidently.

Long Chen pressed a hand on the back of Guo Ran’s armor. Following that, a majestic dragon cry resounded throughout heaven and earth. Long Chen had put away his starry sea manifestation and summoned the Dragon King Battle Armor instead.

A surge of violent power coursed into Guo Ran, causing his battle armor to radiate an unprecedented brilliance. The clouds in the sky were blasted away, and the millions of runes on his armor illuminated with intensity.

At this time, over five thousand Dragonblood warriors also unleashed the power of their dragon blood, sending it into Guo Ran’s armor. After that, every single rune on his armor seemed to come to life.

Feeling all this energy, Guo Ran was unable to control his excitement. However, his expression quickly changed. Some parts of his battle armor were reaching their limit and could not contain more power.

In previous tests with the Dragonblood warriors, the combined addition of all their power could, at most, bring Guo Ran's armor to sixty percent of its limit. There was no need to worry about exceeding the limits of his battle armor.

However, with the addition of Long Chen, that wild power poured into his battle armor, instantly propelling it to its limit.

“Dragonblood Cross Slash!”

Guo Ran was so frightened that he instantly unleashed his technique, afraid his battle armor would explode if he waited a second longer.

BOOM!

A giant cross emanated from Guo Ran’s sabers, slashing toward the divine bird in the sky.

On the other hand, the Great Desolate World’s experts simply didn’t want to unleash their final move. After all, they didn’t want mutual destruction and just sought to scare them off.

Their plan was well thought out—by instilling fear, they hoped to initiate negotiations. Even giving Long Chen and the others a sky-high price for peace wasn’t out of the question.

However, Long Chen didn’t fall for it. He actually attacked first, and it stunned the Great Desolate World’s experts. They found themselves trapped in the corner that they had backed themselves into.

“Kill them!” The Eternal experts roared with fury. Since they had no other way out, they could only risk it all.

All their power was instantly sucked away. The divine bird swelled and then erupted, and at that moment, the blazing sun in its mouth shot out.

The sun collided with the cross—one side bearing the death blow of over eighty Eternal experts, and the other side carrying the combined power of over five thousand Dragonblood warriors. This was a world-shaking collision.

BOOM!

These two supreme attacks crashed together just like that.
