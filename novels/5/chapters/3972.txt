Chapter 3961 The Nineteenth Prince Zhu Yifeng

Within the primal chaos space, Long Chen was studying star diagrams. The dragon expert had said that due to his path deviating from the original Nine Star Hegemon Body Art, his current Seven Star Battle Armor was a far cry from the true Seven Star Battle Armor.

However, Long Chen could still change the Seven Star Battle Armor, adjusting its circulation path and arrangement into a stronger form.

But while saying it was easy, actually doing it was a different matter. Right now, the seven stars and the star diagram complimented each other, thus, moving a single star would cause the entire thing to change, including the entire starry sea. If he were to try using it in a bad form, there would be a power backflow and he would simply instantly explode. Thus, Long Chen was still in the theory phase.

With the help of the Seven Treasure Colored Glass Tree, Long Chen had come up with dozens of possibilities. However, he knew that this wasn’t enough. He had to keep going until he exhausted all possibilities. Then he would compare them, using all these different possibilities to dredge out and corroborate the path that was truly his.

It was at this time that certain runes in the training room lit up to indicate that someone outside wished to see him. Originally, Long Chen was planning on ignoring this person. However, the training room said that the person who wished to see him was Zhu Yifeng.VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

The Zhu surname was the surname of the Vermilion Bird Empire’s royalty. Thinking of this, Long Chen was worried about the possibility that Yu Qingxuan had sent someone to him, so he left the primal chaos space to check it out.

“Brother Long, do you still remember this junior brother?” That person smiled when he saw Long Chen come out.

To his surprise, the person who came to find him was the youth who had shared a seat with him in front of the stage that day. His name was Zhu Yifeng.

“So it’s brother Zhu. May I ask what you need from me?” asked Long Chen, getting right to the point.

“Ah, I feel great reverence for brother Long. That day, when you slapped Eunuch Wei, I almost cheered. That damn eunuch, you don’t even know how hateful he is! My imperial father favors him, so he actually doesn’t even care about a prince like myself! I’ve long since wanted to slap him, but never had a chance to. Of course, even if I had the chance, I wouldn’t dare to do so. I wouldn’t be able to beat him,” chortled Zhu Yifeng.

Long Chen laughed. This Zhu Yifeng was quite interesting. At least, he was much better than those icy princes and princesses that Long Chen had encountered before.

“I heard that you came here to propose to Princess Qingxuan. That’s amazing!” Zhu Yifeng gave Long Chen a thumbs-up. “Princess Qingxuan is my imperial father’s most cherished daughter. Don’t think that he wouldn’t be strict and cold toward us just because we are his children. If we make mistakes, we are always punished and even more heavily than others. Actually, I was originally the twentieth prince, but the nineteenth prince was killed by my imperial father, so I’m now the nineteenth.”

“He killed your older brother? Why?” Long Chen jumped in shock. How could someone kill their own son?

“My brother had some dealings with the Violet Thunderclap Empire. I’m not sure about the details, but my imperial father was so furious that he directly cut off his head. No one was able to stop him. Ah, don’t tell anyone that I told you this! If my imperial father hears of it, even if he doesn’t kill me, I’ll definitely lose a layer of skin!” Zhu Yifeng suddenly realized that he had exposed a major secret, a taboo subject in the royal family. Hence, he instantly turned pale and looked at Long Chen beggingly.

“Don’t worry, I’m not a blabbermouth. Furthermore, your father is my future father-in-law. We’re a family, so why would I harm you?” Long Chen patted Zhu Yifeng’s shoulder. This child spoke directly from the heart, so Long Chen’s wariness toward him instantly dropped a great deal. Getting along with such people was much easier.

Zhu Yifeng sighed with relief after hearing Long Chen’s guarantee. All of a sudden, he excitedly asked, “That’s right, brother Long, what were the results of your proposal? I only heard that you’ve started the trials. Are things progressing smoothly?”

“His Majesty treats me decently. He agreed that it would be alright as long as I passed the trials. The two empresses are also nice and even wanted to give me a golden status plate at the time, but I refused. I, Long Chen, am a man who raises the heavens from the earth. How could I rely on other people’s help for such a thing?” Long Chen’s face didn’t even redden in the slightest as he spouted these lies.

Back then, he and the emperor had come so close to exchanging curses right at each other’s faces. But somehow, Long Chen managed to say that their relationship was decent.

“Wow, brother Long, you’re amazing! No, big brother, my real brother! You’re going to be my brother-in-law soon. In the future, make sure to look after me!” Zhu Yifeng’s nature was very simple. He believed whatever Long Chen said without the slightest suspicion. He was even grabbing Long Chen’s hand like he had found his lucky star.

“Cough…” Seeing Zhu Yifeng believe him to this extent, Long Chen actually felt a bit bad and hastily said, “Ah, although becoming the imperial son-in-law is nothing difficult, I’ll need to take it step by step. The goal is still a bit far.”

“Just based on the fact that you dared to slap Eunuch Wei’s head into that of a pig and still leave the palace safe and sound is enough to show me that big brother is definitely a major figure! Ah, don’t misunderstand, it’s not that I’m trying to drag you to my side. I’m different from the other princes and princesses. I have no desire to fight for the position of emperor. Well, the main thing is that I simply have no chance. Thus, I just want some support. I don’t care who becomes the next emperor. As long as they ignore me, it’s fine. I just want to live a simple life,” said Zhu Yifeng.

“If you don’t even want to become the emperor, why would others make things hard on you? Why would you need a backer?” asked Long Chen.

Zhu Yifeng had a crying expression as he said, “Big brother, you don’t understand. The imperial family doesn’t care about family love. As an imperial disciple, you have to be outstanding. You have to be learned and powerful. Since it’s only just us here, I’ll tell you the truth. If my imperial father were to hear me say something so unambitious, he would definitely cast me into the fire prison. Let alone my imperial father, even my mother would give me a beating. The princes and princesses are all competing against each other, both openly and in secret. As for me, I’m dumber than them, and I can’t beat them in martial power either. So, amongst my brothers and sisters, I only dare to fight with words, acting like I’m not afraid of them. In truth, I’m terrified inside, but I can’t show it.”

“Your talent is already so good, but you can’t beat a single prince or princess?” Long Chen eyed Zhu Yifeng. Although he wasn’t a Double Supreme, his flame energy was extremely pure. According to reason, he shouldn’t be weak.

“I can’t. I can’t beat a single one.” Zhu Yifeng almost wept. He suddenly thought of why he had come here in the first place and said, “Big brother, I came because I thought of something that can let you rise in martial artist rank very quickly. You won’t need to waste so much time.”

“Oh? Let me hear it.”

“During the next competition, I’ll make an agreement with the arena. Once you win, you will be directly promoted to my training partner. After all, every prince and princess has the authority to pick a training partner from the martial stage once a year. I still haven’t done so this year, and this can help you out a little bit. Hopefully, when you soar, you can look after me a bit.”

Long Chen directly agreed to such a good thing. This way, he could borrow Zhu Yifeng’s status and directly be promoted to higher-level fights. Hearing this, Zhu Yifeng was delighted and immediately said that he didn’t want to delay Long Chen’s cultivation. He then bid Long Chen farewell.

Three days later, it was Long Chen’s turn on the martial stage again, and Zhu Yifeng was already waiting for him. After the advocate took out a document and gave it to Long Chen, Long Chen directly signed his name there.

Just like before, as soon as Long Chen stepped onto the stage, the opponent directly cursed, admitted defeat, and left.

“Hahaha, big brother, now you’re my training partner! We’re comrades now!” Zhu Yifeng danced in excitement.

“You’re getting happy too early.”

Just then, an icy voice rang out, and Princess Yu Qianxue appeared with a dozen bodyguards around her. When Long Chen saw her pleased smile, he instantly had a bad feeling.
