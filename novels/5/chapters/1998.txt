“Fight with you? No, I’m going to kill you,” sneered Long Chen. He raised Evilmoon back onto his shoulder, panting a bit.

Their wild battle had resulted in his spiritual yuan dropping. The Azure Dragon Battle Armor, utilizing his world energy, and the Five Star Battle Armor gave him immense power but used up a great deal of energy. Evilmoon in particular consumed much more energy after having its seal undone. Its weight was astonishing.

At first, the majority of the energy had come from Evilmoon, but then it had become half and half, and then Evilmoon had run out of energy, leaving most of the burden on Long Chen.

Long Chen cursed Evilmoon for being unreliable. He had thought that after undoing its seal, it would be able to dominate these old monsters.

Even though he had the energy within his 108,000 stars and his divine ring absorbing energy, he couldn’t keep up with this exhaustion.

As for Ji Wuming, he was using the karmic luck of Heavenly Fate Island. He wasn’t using up much of his own energy. On the other hand, Long Chen had already used up a third of his spiritual yuan. Any more and his combat power would weaken, and he would exhaust himself even more to keep up,

“Kill me? What a huge joke. I have endless karmic luck supporting me. The world’s energy is mine, while you have nothing,” sneered Ji Wuming.

The distant experts couldn’t help shaking their heads at this shamelessness. He was actually fighting a battle of attrition with a Life Star disciple and even mocked him? He was essentially cheating by relying on Heavenly Fate Island’s karmic luck. This wasn’t even his own power.

“Should we attack together?” whispered Gu Yang.

“What are you worrying about? If boss says he’s going to kill him, he’s definitely capable of doing it. We just have to watch,” said Guo Ran. He might even have more confidence in Long Chen than Long Chen himself.

Within the Dragonblood Legion, Chu Yao smiled faintly. She slowly closed her eyes and formed hand seals. Three verdant leaves appeared behind her. Those leaves glistened brightly, almost seeming to drip energy.

Three giant leaves also appeared behind Long Chen. In that instant, he felt his energy rise once more to its peak.

Ji Wuming had been planning on capturing Long Chen once he was exhausted. Although the Fantasy Star Sword’s energy was also being exhausted by Long Chen’s ferocious attacks, it wasn’t as bad as Long Chen’s energy consumption.

Although Heavenly Fate Island had been destroyed, that didn’t mean that he couldn’t establish his own sect, becoming the founder and ancestor of a new power. By catching Long Chen, he would be able to obtain enough for that sect. He could use Long Chen as a gambling chip to bargain with Pill Valley and get the resources that he needed. So he hadn’t been pressing Long Chen hard for fear that he would run, or the old man and the others would come save him.

“Split the Heavens 7!”

It was a nice plan, but Long Chen suddenly unleashed a thunderous attack that sent him flying back and coughing up blood.

“Why bother? Exposing your trump cards for this?” Evilmoon sighed. In its eyes, Ji Wuming was essentially crippled. There was no need for Long Chen to force himself to kill him.

Even if they just waited a day, Long Chen would be able to easily defeat him. In two days, Ji Wuming would have to flee on sight. In three days, Ji Wuming wouldn’t even be able to flee upon seeing him.

Evilmoon didn’t know what nerve of Long Chen’s had been plucked, but he simply refused to wait. Exposing the Wood Spirit Union for this was definitely not worth it.

Long Chen ignored Evilmoon’s sigh. He knew that he had to kill Ji Wuming no matter what the price.

Chu Yao’s Wood Spirit Union was even more amazing than before. She had advanced to the Life Star realm and had created a giant astral space. The Life Star realm was perfect for wood cultivators. While an ordinary Life Star expert would have their spiritual yuan increase by ten or even tens of times due to creating an astral space, wood cultivators would see their wood spirit energy increase a hundredfold perhaps up to a thousandfold.

With the Wood Spirit Union, Long Chen’s spiritual yuan instantly reached max capacity once more. Even his soul was being nourished and he was completely refreshed.

“Now you know what I’m using to fight you?” sneered Long Chen, once more attacking with the seventh form of Split the Heavens. It was like he didn’t even have energy considerations anymore.

Ji Wuming was forced back repeatedly and continuously coughed up blood.

“This is...”

The experts looked in shock at Long Chen. His aura had clearly been dropping, but now he had instantly returned to his peak condition.

“It’s that girl!”

Everyone turned to look at Chu Yao who was in the Dragonblood Legion. Her manifestation was active, and within it was an endless river cutting the world in two. The river flowed and surged, unleashing waves of life energy. The battlefield was a ruined land, but the area around Chu Yao was blooming with all kinds of vegetation. It was sprouting out of the ground like it was spring. Only the area around her was a world of thriving life.

“What amazing life energy.” People couldn’t help sighing. They had never heard of a wood cultivator that was so powerful.

At this time, Yu Xiaoyun realized why no one from the Dragonblood Legion went to help Long Chen. They had a powerful wood cultivator amongst them that could share energy with Long Chen. Hence, they were there to guarantee her safety.

Ji Wuming tumbled back, unable to endure.

“His Fantasy Star Sword...!”

Startled cries rang out. A thumb-sized nick had appeared in the Fantasy Star Sword. That meant that its karmic luck had already mostly been exhausted. As for Ji Wuming, his own life and death energy was unable to block Long Chen’s berserk attacks.

“We can’t let him die!” Yu Xiaoyun’s expression changed. He charged over.

“Get back here.” The old man had been keeping a close eye on Yu Xiaoyun and immediately launched an attack with the Heaven Splitting Blade. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

Yu Xiaoyun’s expression changed. He immediately gave up on saving Ji Wuming and switched to defending against his madman opponent. He couldn’t let the old man unleash any big suicidal moves.

However, the others hadn’t even had time to move when a giant dragon claw came smashing down from the sky. It was the silver drake king.

Lei Long had consumed so much thunderforce from Long Chen’s thunderforce that it couldn’t endure it. By creating the lightning channel once more, it could let out a bit of that energy so that it could focus on absorbing it slowly instead of simply containing it.

This lightning channel was very stable, but it still wasn’t enough to allow the entire drake king to fit through. However, just one claw was no problem.

Ji Wuming howled, blocking with his sword. As a result, the dragon claw exploded, but Ji Wuming was now covered in cracks.

“Die!”

Long Chen once more unleashed the seventh form of Split the Heavens. Ji Wuming summoned all his power to defend again.

As a result, the Fantasy Star Sword exploded along with its master, and Ji Wuming’s Yuan Spirit was slain along with him. The leader of Heavenly Fate Island, a Netherpassage expert of the third step, someone supported with a core divine item that was using up its karmic luck to fight, was slain by a Life Star disciple. The world was silent for a moment.

Rumbling rang out as nine lightning drakes appeared in the sky. They were the strongest lightning drakes within the lightning field other than their king.

Their bodies were now much larger, but the surprising thing was the slight bulge on their foreheads. That was where a dragon’s horn was supposed to be.

A drake was not a dragon, and drakes did not have a dragon horn. For this sign to now appear meant that they were truly starting to transform into dragons.

Originally, they would have never managed to become true lightning dragons in their lifetimes, but it was the divine nature of Long Chen’s tribulation that had caused this transformation. They had not only gotten stronger, but their intelligence had also grown.

The nine drakes unleashed a united dragon cry, which was like rolling thunder. They coiled behind Long Chen, glaring at Yu Xiaoyun and the others. It seemed that if Long Chen gave the order, they would attack.

Long Chen was soaked in blood, yet he appeared mightier than ever. With the nine drakes behind him, he seemed like a god. A killing god.

“Yu Xiaoyun, bring your people away and scram. Today is a joyous day, celebrating the rise of the Dragonblood Legion. I’m not in the mood to kill people, so you can decide whether you want things to stop here or to fight,” shouted Long Chen.

Looking at Long Chen who appeared like a killing god, people couldn’t help muttering to themselves that if he looked like this when he wasn’t in a mood to kill, what would he look like when he was?

The old man was smiling brightly at the fact that Long Chen had slain Ji Wuming. He returned to his camp. “Fuck, today was really satisfying.” He had never been so proud in his life. It was like Long Chen’s glory was his own.

Yu Xiaoyun’s expression was dark. He looked at the nine lightning drakes and the channel behind them. The silver drake king didn’t come out. He then looked at the Dragonblood Legion and Qu Jianying and the others.

“There’s no need to look. Our power is definitely greater than your side’s If we go to war, your losses will definitely be greater than ours. Most importantly, the Martial Heaven Alliance’s hearts are united, while your alliance is nothing more than a clobbered group. Hurry up and decide whether or not we’re fighting,” sneered Long Chen.

“Long Chen, count yourself vicious today. However, don’t get too pleased.”

Yu Xiaoyun actually turned and left, with the other experts following.
