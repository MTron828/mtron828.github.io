Chapter 3308 Con

As soon as these Immortal Kings looked at him, Long Chen knew that they were going to declare his sins.

So, he didn’t even give them a chance to speak. He directly said, “I admit that I went a bit too far this time. But I don’t regret it. This fellow cut in line, which is already disrespectful to the Heavenly Rainbow Fairy. He then challenged me, another blasphemy. He even said that I was not qualified to offer my respects to the Heavenly Rainbow Fairy. That was what made me break. The Heavenly Rainbow Fairy did not just protect the people of the Heavenly Rainbow Domain but all the human race. All humans must respect her and be grateful to her. I beat him today to tell everyone that the Heavenly Rainbow Fairy is not just the protector of the Heavenly Rainbow Domain, but all of humankind. 

“It is precisely because there was a protector like the Heavenly Rainbow Fairy that was willing to sacrifice her own life without hesitation that our human race has continued to survive. It was the sacrifice of such a grand figure that led to our human race no longer being treated as the bottom of the food chain. Our current era of peace was won through the sacrifice of her blood and life. Heroes are not differentiated by domain, by sex, or by origin. The Heavenly Rainbow Fairy does not belong to just the Heavenly Rainbow Domain, but to all humans. Seniors, tell me, am I qualified to offer sacrifice to the Heavenly Rainbow Fairy?”

“Well said. The Heavenly Rainbow Fairy’s benevolence should be firmly remembered by all people. Heroes are not differentiated by domain.”

As soon as Long Chen said this, countless people agreed with him. They were all the natives of the Heavenly Rainbow Domain, so they all felt immense gratitude toward the Heavenly Rainbow Fairy. She was their belief.

Hence, they all had a good first impression of Long Chen when they saw him treat the Heavenly Rainbow Fairy with such respect. For him to go all-out to protect her dignity, they began to speak up in support of him.

Long Chen then cupped his fists toward them to express his thanks. He continued, “I don’t mind enduring whatever punishment seniors wish to give me. I, Long Chen, will accept. As long as I can protect a hero’s dignity, even if I am reduced to the wickedest of the wicked and must carry the name of infamy, who cares? I attacked today to tell certain people that if they come out to this domain, they shouldn’t be too arrogant. They have to remember to be respectful and grateful. Otherwise, others will make them pay the blood price.”

“Bastards like this must be taught a lesson! We support you!”

A shout came from the crowd. This one shout resulted in countless others shouting their agreement as well.Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

Long Chen was unleashing an air of utmost righteousness, but when he heard that shout, it almost broke his farce. That was actually Qi Yu shouting from amongst the crowd. His timing was perfect.

The native experts all supported Long Chen. In their opinion, as long as someone revered the Heavenly Rainbow Fairy, they were a friend. Those who dared to blaspheme the Heavenly Rainbow Fairy were all enemies. So, they naturally supported Long Chen.

As for the experts that had come from outside the domain, they exchanged glances, a bit stupefied. Long Chen’s excuse was a bit too forced, was it not?

Yang Zicong had merely provoked him with a single sentence, and he gave him such a violent beating. Frankly, both of them were in the wrong, and Long Chen’s sin was clearly greater than Yang Zicong’s. But based on the current state, Long Chen had somehow become the upholder of righteousness, an incarnation of chivalry, a hero for the common people.

Those Immortal Kings were also dumbfounded. Just who were they? Could Long Chen’s little tricks escape their observation? It was clearly Long Chen who had gone too far this time.

However, Long Chen didn’t even give them a chance to speak before managing to pull in a huge group of supporters. With so many people supporting him, how could they possibly cause trouble for Long Chen?

If they really did punish Long Chen, it would give the feeling of repaying kindness with enmity. It would definitely draw the dissatisfaction of the native people.

“You are Long Chen? The one from the High Firmament Academy?” asked one of the Immortal Kings suddenly.

“That’s right, this untalented one is the dean of the High Firmament Academy’s seventh branch, Long Chen. I greet seniors.” Long Chen cupped his fists toward them.

People had recognized Long Chen, but this was a giant plaza where shouting was forbidden, so only a few people had actually guessed his origin and told the people around them. The rest were still in the dark.

Now that Long Chen reported his origin, it caused an uproar here. So this was the person that had been the recent topic of discussion. The person at the center of all those rumors was actually this black-robed youngster.

With Long Chen cupping his fists toward them, those six Immortal Kings hastily returned the courtesy. “So the dean of a branch of the High Firmament Academy has come! How rude of us!”

Although Long Chen’s cultivation base was not high enough, his status as a dean of the High Firmament Academy was something that even they couldn’t be rude toward. They needed to treat him as an equal, as that was the most basic etiquette. If they didn’t, it would not only show that they hadn’t been raised right, but it would also be as if they were looking down on the High Firmament Academy.

It had to be known that the High Firmament Academy was the oldest academy in the immortal world. With such a long inheritance, although it had declined, no one could underestimate them.

“Dean Long Chen, if you wish to offer sacrifice to the great fairy, you could have simply told us in advance. Sect leaders have their own path,” said one of the Immortal Kings.

Since sect leaders were all so busy, they didn’t have time to line up to offer sacrifice to the Heavenly Rainbow Fairy. Furthermore, it was not suitable for someone of that status to stand in line.

Thus, such figures had a special passage to the statue. They could directly go there without lining up.

However, Long Chen shook his head. “In front of the Heavenly Rainbow Fairy’s eyes, all people are equal. When she protected us, it was not based on power or weakness, so we should not separate ourselves like that when offering sacrifice to her. Since I admire the Heavenly Rainbow Fairy, I naturally will not be afraid of some time spent in line.”

Hearing his words, those Immortal Kings were moved. One of them sighed, “As expected of the dual champion of the Nine Prefecture Convention and the High Firmament Academy’s youngest Heaven Master instructor in all of history, as well as the youngest dean. We are ashamed. You are correct, all people are equal in front of the Heavenly Rainbow Fairy. Thus, no one should be given special treatment. We will consider whether or not we should remove this path. It seems that it really is against the Heavenly Rainbow Fairy’s intentions.”

This Immortal King was clearly touched by Long Chen’s words. He greatly admired Long Chen’s wisdom and heart.

It wasn’t just the Immortal Kings that were moved. There were countless experts, especially the native ones that looked at Long Chen with admiration. In their hearts, the Heavenly Rainbow Fairy was supreme. Status, cultivation base? They were all nothing in front of her. Long Chen’s words had touched their hearts.

Bai Shishi felt the most admiration for him of all. So many people had been conned by just a few words from Long Chen. Even the Immortal Kings were feeling admiration for him. She was fully convinced by his mouth. With that mouth, he could even convince dead people to come back to life.

Even though he had just beaten up someone in front of the Heavenly Rainbow Fairy, it seemed that people had to be grateful to him. Just how was that possible?

“Your sanctimony means nothing. By acting like this, are you trying to cover something up?” Just then, a cold laugh rang out. That voice was full of disdain and contempt, as well as a naked provocation.
