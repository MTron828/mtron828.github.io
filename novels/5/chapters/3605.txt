Chapter 3594

Guo Ran’s heart didn’t soften in the slightest in front of Wang Zixu’s begging. His saber pierced through Wang Zixu’s chest, and he lifted him off of the ground just like that.

“Stop!”

The Wang family’s people roared furiously. The Wang family was extremely powerful in the Heavenly Dragon Divine Armor College, possessing tens of thousands of experts. But they only dared to roar and not a single person dared to step forward.

That was because the death of their late stage World King at the hands of Huo Linger had completely broken their courage. In the end, when they saw a truly ruthless person, they didn’t dare to move.

As for the Assembly Elder of the Wang family, his eyes almost popped out of their sockets. Wang Zixu was their Wang family’s greatest genius in history, and he was also their only hope. If Wang Zixu died, their Wang family would fully decline.

However, an old fellow like him was powerless to save Wang Zixu, and veins throbbed on his forehead. He could only roar at Xue Yifan.

“Xue Yifan, are you blind? How can you allow your disciples to slaughter each other?!”

“Hahaha!” Not waiting for Xue Yifan’s reply, Guo Ran raised his head and laughed. “Disciples aren’t allowed to slaughter each other? And yet, when he tried to kill me, I didn’t hear you say a single thing! So his life is important, but mine is that of an ant? Let me tell you, even if the heavens collapse right now, with my boss present, I will still kill Wang Zixu. No one can save him.” Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

Guo Ran lifted Wang Zixu into the air with his saber. His expression was rather frightening.

Long Chen sighed inside. Guo Ran had been suppressed for too long and was completely erupting today. This was precisely the day Xue Yifan had been waiting for. Regretfully, this little fellow knew how to endure far too much and only dared to release this fury after Long Chen arrived.

“Guo Ran, don’t kill me! I beg you! I don’t want to die, I want to live! As long as you don’t kill me, I’m willing to be your attendant! I’m willing to be your servant! I only ask that you spare my life…!”

Wang Zixu was held in the air. With every word, a sharp pain ran through his body. But with his life in Guo Ran’s hands, he was powerless. Face? He didn’t care about it any longer and begged for mercy.

“If you had known that this day would come, would you have acted the same way? You bullied me, humiliated me, and blocked my cultivation path. I was able to endure all of this because cultivation is inherently unfair. But you are completely unforgivable. You killed my brother. Do you know how Tu Bao died?” thundered Guo Ran, clenching his teeth as he stared at Wang Zixu.

Hearing Tu Bao’s name, Tu Hu’s body shook. That was his little brother that had passed back in the hunting grounds. However, Tu Hu had always thought that his brother died to the devil beasts. Only now that Guo Ran mentioned him here did Tu Hu learn just how unjust Tu Bao’s death was.

“You damnable bastard, you actually used his life to threaten me and force me out. Brother Tu Bao was so enraged that he killed himself to stop you. Do you still remember my words from back then? I swore that I would cut off your head as a sacrifice to his spirit,” snarled Guo Ran, killing intent exploding out of him.

“No-!” Wang Zixu let out a cry of despair.

Guo Ran suddenly pulled his saber out of Wang Zixu’s body and slashed it through the air. Wang Zixu’s head instantly flew off.

However, there was no blood because Wang Zixu’s blood had long since run dry. This one slash did not just cut off Wang Zixu’s head but also extinguished his soul. The genius of the Wang family was fully dead.

Grabbing Wang Zixu’s head with one hand, Guo Ran looked up into the heavens and roared, “Brother Tu Bao, I, Guo Ran, have accomplished my promise to you…!”

After that roar, Guo Ran began to bawl. Tu Hu and Tu Bao were his closest brothers here. They had started following him before he even began to stand out simply due to having similar characters. In spite of the dangers of following him, they had still done so.

During that hunting trial, Guo Ran had long since known that those people would try to suppress him. Hence, he had hidden himself at the start, not wanting to face Wang Zixu. At that time, if he were to fight Wang Zixu, he would simply be sending himself to his death.

However, who would have thought that Wang Zixu would be so exasperated as to actually capture Tu Bao in order to threaten Guo Ran?

At that time, Guo Ran had been hiding in the dark. But even knowing that he couldn’t beat Wang Zixu, he was prepared to fight Wang Zixu to the death when Tu Bao directly self-detonated in his rage. Guo Ran could only just watch as his brother died in front of him.

After that, Guo Ran’s exploding killing intent directly exposed his location. It was at this time that Wang Zixu chased him all the way to a dangerous place like the devil dragon nest.

Having vanquished his mortal enemy, Guo Ran should be happy. But thinking of how powerless he had been that he couldn’t even save his own brother, he simply wept in grief.

Long Chen walked onto the stage and patted Guo Ran’s shoulder. Of everyone here, he was the one capable of understanding Guo Ran’s emotions the best.

Guo Ran had never wanted to be the boss because he was unwilling to endure having such power. That profound feeling of powerlessness could tear a person’s heart apart. But there was nothing he could do. After all, Tu Hu, Xie Qianqian, and the others all relied on him. If he fell, they also wouldn’t have good endings.

The pressure on Guo Ran, the pain in his heart, only he could understand. Yet, he had to act like he had a plan to give everyone confidence, while he himself wasn’t sure how long he could endure. That feeling was completely unbearable to him. Now that he had avenged Tu Bao, the emotions that he had suppressed for so long erupted.

“Don’t cry. That’s about enough. Brother Tu Bao’s spirit definitely wouldn’t want to see you like this,” comforted Long Chen.

After crying for a while, Guo Ran felt like all those emotions that he had been holding back were released. After he stopped crying, he seemed to be a completely different person, as if a curse had been undone. Tu Bao’s death had always been a heavy weight on him.

“Xie Liuer, Leng Hui, don’t you also refuse to recognize me? If you want to challenge me, I definitely won’t retreat. Anyone who wants to fight me can come right now!” Guo Ran wiped away his tears, took a deep breath, and pointed his black saber at them, his gaze sweeping across the crowd.

Xie Liuer and Leng Hui’s expressions changed. They didn’t dare to make a sound. Wang Zixu was dead, and they all knew their own power levels. How could they dare to challenge Guo Ran?

As for the others, there was no way that they could challenge him. Although there were others amongst the senior generation who were stronger than Wang Zixu, according to the college’s rules, they were not qualified to challenge Guo Ran.

Furthermore, they weren’t blind. The winds of the Heavenly Dragon Divine Armor College had completely changed. If they stepped out now, it would be no different from courting death.

Anyone with a brain could see that the dean was supporting Guo Ran. He had publicly torn off any pleasantries with the assembly. Moreover, Guo Ran had shaken everyone by killing Wang Zixu. Now, the dean would be making his move on the assembly. The entire Heavenly Dragon Divine Armor College was probably about to go through a cleansing.

If they came forward to challenge Guo Ran at this time, it would be opposing the dean. If that happened, they definitely wouldn’t have a good ending.

“Although the two of you also targeted me, you never killed my brothers. Due to our relationship as fellow disciples, as the proxy dean, I won’t cause trouble for you because you didn’t give me a reason to kill you. But some people won’t have that ending. Zhao Guangdi, Yue Changhui, Li Xiaochong, Gu Yi…”

After Guo Ran listed off over thirty names, those disciples’ expressions all changed.

“Come out and face your death!” shouted Guo Ran. After that, an uproar erupted.
