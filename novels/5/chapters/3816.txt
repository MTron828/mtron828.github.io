Chapter 3805 Different Path

Long Chen’s meridians were riddled with tiny holes and scars. They were almost broken. The last fight had been incredibly dangerous.

It had to be known that unleashing all your power in one attack was innately a kind of taboo, as this was entirely a self-damaging fighting style. You might not even be able to hurt your opponent before killing yourself.𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

Furthermore, Long Chen had just condensed the Seven Star Battle Armor and was unable to fully control this new power yet. Such a full-power attack had been no different from courting death.

Long Chen normally wouldn’t make such a low-level mistake. But the dragon expert had told him to do so, so he had done so. As expected, this attack almost crippled him.

However, Long Chen hadn’t expected this injury to get him some primal chaos qi. He couldn’t help prostrating himself in admiration toward this dragon expert.

Although his meridians were badly damaged, as long as he was given some time, it wouldn’t be difficult to heal them.

After all, he had quite a bit of primal chaos qi in his body now and seemed to understand the dragon expert’s intentions. He directly started circulating the primal chaos qi through his damaged meridians.

As expected, when this primal chaos qi poured through his meridians, the wounds quickly healed. Furthermore, they were now several times thicker and ten times tougher than before.

Long Chen was delighted by this. Now his violet qi would no longer leak, and he would also be able to directly summon the Seven Star Battle Armor.

The reason that he had been unable to fully control the Seven Star Battle Armor’s power was because it was too powerful, to the point that his meridians couldn’t endure it.

Furthermore, with his meridians pushed to their limit, they naturally ended up releasing a bit of violet qi to guarantee their proper function. As a result, much of his violet qi was wasted.

It was like someone who could only lift a hundred pounds suddenly wielding a weapon that was two hundred pounds. There was no way for them to properly use it. They would have to cut away a part of it so that they could lift it.

Once you reached the limit that you could lift, you would let your body slowly acclimate to it and slowly increase the weight again. For Long Chen, his meridians were the foundation of how much power he could use. However, even his toughened meridians from the tribulation were still unable to endure the full power of the Seven Star Battle Armor.

But now, with the nourishment of the primal chaos qi, his almost crippled meridians were rebuilt. Their width didn’t change, but their strength and elasticity increased by many times. He would no longer have to worry about his qi leaking.

In other words, the current Long Chen could fully control the Seven Star Battle Armor’s power. He had the urge to charge back right now and keep fighting.

However, thinking about it, he had just fought such an immense battle and used up almost all of his violet qi, so he knew he shouldn’t do it. But it went without saying that his trust in the dragon expert had reached an almost naive level.

“Senior, you really are amazing. You knew that my attack would have such benefits,” transmitted Long Chen.

“Based on my predictions, you should have gained more benefits. I don’t mean to knock you down, but amongst nine star heirs in the same realm, you can only count as average. You wouldn’t even be considered as above average,” sighed the dragon expert.

“What? How can that be? Even though I am so powerful now?” asked Long Chen, dismayed.

It had to be known that the current Long Chen didn’t even know just how terrifyingly powerful he was. After advancing, he was no longer the old Long Chen. He felt like he could rampage wherever he went.

However, the dragon expert’s words were like a bucket of ice water dumped over his head. He was shocked and refused to believe that he was that lacking.

“You must accept this reality. I’ve seen many nine star heirs and their Seven Star Battle Armors. Your combat power can only be considered average amongst them. But don’t look down on yourself. It isn’t that you didn’t work hard enough or are lacking talent. Your Nine Star Hegemon Body Art is only the base outline without the accompanying Battle Skills. After all, the Nine Star Hegemon Body Art’s cultivation technique has a set of Battle Skills with it. For you to reach this level is already not bad,” comforted the dragon expert.

This comfort only made Long Chen feel more disappointed. He was someone extremely confident in himself, so this evaluation made him feel hollow. It was difficult to endure.

“Senior, you must know the Nine Star Hegemon Body Art’s Battle Skills, right?” probed Long Chen.

“I don’t. The secret arts of the nine stars are only known by the nine star line. Outsiders cannot comprehend them. Also, the starry river line can be considered a branch of the nine star line. Although your auras might be a bit similar, in terms of true power, it is like a calm river compared to a vast sea. There is no comparison as the two are not on the same level. Even if I knew the Battle Skills of the nine star line, it would be meaningless. And even if other nine star heirs were to transmit them to you, it would mean nothing to you,” said the dragon expert.

“What are you talking about?” Long Chen was startled.

“Do you not know yourself? Ever since the Five Star Battle Armor, your path changed. You forcibly changed the cultivation path of the Nine Star Hegemon Body Art, and there is no going back. Let alone me, even the creator of the Nine Star Hegemon Body Art would not be able to change it,” said the dragon expert.

“Oh, that’s right. I changed the orbit of the six-point star, strengthening it! In other words, the Seven Star Battle Armor is still in its original state, and due to my different cultivation path, it is weaker. If I can change this state, based on my past experience, its power should rise to at least another level.” Thinking of that, Long Chen’s dismay was burned away by excitement.

Back when he had first changed the Nine Star Hegemon Body Art, he had a feeling that his future path would not be easy to walk. But since he had started down this path, he wouldn’t regret it.

He also believed in himself. He would have the ability to walk a different path, one that would not be any inferior to the original Nine Star Hegemon Body Art.

“Hahaha, not bad. Youngsters should have this kind of drive. They need the ambition to climb over difficulties. This is why I was willing to help you back then. That drive to never accept defeat was just like mine back in the day. Who knows whether it’s good or bad that you changed the cultivation path of the Nine Star Hegemon Body Art? Since everything is unknown, you can just press onward without regrets. However, the current you still need to accumulate more power. If you wish to change the Seven Star Battle Armor, you will need to fully master the current Seven Star Battle Armor. Your meridians went through the baptism of heavenly tribulation and you had the aid of nine star heirs. Now, you even repaired them with primal chaos qi. Your meridians are now strong enough, and you are only lacking one thing,” said the dragon expert.

“What is it?” asked Long Chen hastily.

“What you are missing is my dragon king essence blood.”
