Chapter 4798 Mixed Beast Alliance

The beast-like roar was like a heavenly drum, resounding throughout the mountains and sky with the might of the Heavenly Daos. Perhaps only a Heaven Saint could possess such a voice.

“It’s our mixed beast race’s patriarch,” exclaimed Feng You, feeling somewhat startled and delighted.

She immediately called out, “Disciple Feng You greets Patriarch!”

At this moment, the fabric of space rippled, revealing a group of mighty experts. At their helm stood an elder covered in resplendent golden fur, his face resembling a gleaming golden plate, complete with silver horns protruding from his head. With the elder’s appearance came a suffocating wave of Blood Qi, so potent that it left the young disciples reeling, on the verge of collapse.

Behind this elder were two Heaven Saints, as well as a group of young men and women numbering in the hundreds. All of them had markings of demonic beasts, so they were without a doubt members of the mixed beast race. However, when Long Chen saw them, he frowned. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

These people were too barbaric, showing no basic courtesy. Why would they come to the High Firmament Academy’s domain with such an overbearing attitude?

Of course, Long Chen was unaffected by this little bit of pressure and neither were the Dragonblood warriors. However, the other disciples could hardly breathe because of it.

“Greetings, Patriarch!”

Following Feng You’s lead, the rest of the mixed beast race fell to their knees.

Seeing this scene, the horned elder waved his hand and coldly said, “Rise!”

Feng You was startled and had a bad feeling, not knowing why this elder was talking like this.

“Girl, you need to think more. How can you live with a rabble of humans? We were waiting for you!” chided the horned elder.

Long Chen’s expression instantly sank. Just who was the rabble of humans? He was about to question the damn Elder, but Yu Qingxuan already grabbed his hand and shook her head. After all, this person was Feng You’s patriarch. If Long Chen offended him, Feng You would be the one facing his wrath.

Of course, Long Chen understood this, but this old fellow had gone too far, disrespecting not only Long Chen himself but also the esteemed dean, reducing him to the level of mere rabble. What about the dean's dignity?

“Patriarch, it was all my fault. I am prepared to shoulder all responsibility,” Feng You interjected hastily, recognizing the gravity of the situation.

In truth, she sighed inside. She understood Long Chen’s temper too well. If he were to be angered, he would really dare to eradicate all of these insolent guests.

Although Long Chen wasn’t a match for a Heaven Saint, the High Firmament Academy had the four Heaven, Earth, Lightning, and Wind Protector Elders, as well as the High Firmament Divine Sword. If they were to clash, the mixed beast race would surely fall. However, that wasn’t what Feng You wanted to see.

“That’s enough. This matter is settled here. Remember! Now that you’ve come to the Sovereign Emperor Heaven, you have joined the mixed beast alliance. You cannot act selfishly any longer, understand?” reprimanded the horned elder.

“Disciple understands. I promise not to make such a mistake again!” replied Feng You hastily.

Long Chen, Guo Ran, Yue Zifeng, and the others exchanged a look. They could see the pity in each other’s eyes.

In the end, Feng You lowered her prideful head. Someone who wasn’t afraid of death had lowered her head to reality. She had made no mistake, so why apologize and say that she had?

Such a thing could be considered a concession. On the path of cultivation, one step back would mean being pushed back further and further until there was nowhere to go. There was no retreat when it came to cultivation.

“Rise. We can discuss it later.” The horned elder waved his hand and indicated for everyone to rise.

Feng You and the others rose and silently followed the horned elder away. They were clearly being cautious.

Perhaps to Long Chen and the others, joining any faction would be considered mutually beneficial. But for most people, joining a powerful faction meant that they had a sense of safety, that they didn’t need to be scared of suddenly being killed at any moment. This was their chance to have a home.

To Feng You and the others who had been surviving in the cracks of the world, being able to join the mixed beast alliance was like finding their final home. It was the hope of countless generations of their seniors. This dream had been realized in their generation.

No one cherished this opportunity more than Feng You. Thus, at this time, her dignity and temper were no longer important. She was content just to be able to join the mixed beast alliance.

Just as they were leaving, a man with wings on his back and a golden sword in his hand eyed Long Chen disdainfully and asked, “Are you Long Chen?”

Long Chen and the others ignored him. When Feng You passed by, Long Chen reached out and patted Feng You’s arm.

He would have patted her shoulder if he could, but she was just too tall. If he wanted to do that, he’d have to stand on his toes, but it would look too awkward.

“Remember, we will always be comrades who have fought alongside each other.”

At the mention of this, Feng You’s eyes reddened, so she just bit her lip and nodded. She wanted to say something but didn’t know what to say.

She understood that Long Chen recognized her as a comrade. It meant that in times of trouble, she could rely on him for assistance without hesitation.

Understanding Long Chen's unwavering character, Feng You knew that his word held immeasurable value. This one promise was enough for him to fight to the death for her.

Feng You patted Long Chen’s arm as well before leaving. For some reason, Long Chen felt a sense of loss as he watched her leave.

“Hey, are you deaf? I was asking you–!”

Pow!

The rude mixed beast expert hadn’t even done speaking before Long Chen slapped him in the face, sending him tumbling to the ground.

“You shameless brat, how dare you—!” shouted the horned elder.

The horned elder had tacitly assented to this disciple’s behavior. Having heard some rumors about Long Chen in front of the gate, he didn’t dare to believe it. Thus, he incited that disciple to provoke Long Chen. Although that disciple wasn’t their strongest young expert, he was definitely outstanding—at least enough to gauge Long Chen’s strength.

With a single slap from Long Chen, this unlucky bastard plummeted to the ground, unable to withstand the force of Long Chen’s slap. Seeing this scene, the horned elder seethed with rage and reached out to grab Long Chen.

However, before he could lay a hand on Long Chen, a hand composed of lightning runes blocked his way. With an explosive sound, the Divine Lightning Elder sent the horned elder flying. Lightning runes clung to the horned elder, flickering a few times before they finally vanished.

“Do you really think the High Firmament Academy can’t deal with you? If it weren’t for Dean Long Chen and this girl’s friendship, I promise you that not one of you would live to see tomorrow’s sun,” said the Divine Lightning Elder icily, unable to hold back in the face of this shamelessness.

“You...!” The horned elder snorted, “Fine, then we’ll see just how long a declined academy can last in this world!”

“We’re leaving!”

The horned elder waved his hand, leading the mixed beast race’s troops away along with Feng You who didn’t even look back.
