Chapter 3829 Uninvited Guests

When Long Chen dashed forward, he saw the Vajra Blood Bat quivering within the channel. Some kind of energy was pulling at it. It seemed that it was trying to drag the Ghost Dao lifeform out of the Vajra Blood Bat’s body.

The Ghost Dao lifeform screamed and struggled, but its body was actually being pulled out. It was about to be sucked away by this mysterious power.

Long Chen slashed his saber down. The void quivered and a sharp saber-light cut through the void, seemingly severing something.

The Vajra Blood Bat instantly regained its freedom and fled to Long Chen’s shoulder, not daring to move from there.

Long Chen looked ahead. Within the darkness, he saw a giant python. But curiously, its eyes were growing where its nose should be.

“Pupil arts!”

When Long Chen looked at it, his heart shook. Those eyes possessed strange marks in them. When those marks spun, they unleashed magical power.

With just a glance into its eyes, Long Chen’s mind grew dizzy. Forceful mental energy invaded his soul.

“Devil Pupil Ghost Python!”

Four words leaped out of Long Chen’s mind. This was a terrifying immemorial lifeform, a nightmare-class malevolent spirit.

The Vajra Blood Bat squeaked, saying that this evil corpse had just appeared. When it was playing here yesterday, it had yet to appear.

However, the Ghost Dao lifeform had no concept of time. By yesterday, perhaps it was talking about centuries or millennia ago.

Mo Nian and the others also rushed over. When Yue Xiaoqian saw this evil corpse, she was completely shocked. She also recognized this terrifying lifeform.

Buzz.

Suddenly, this entire world spun. Heaven and earth collapsed, and the sky suddenly brightened. They had actually been transported out of the tomb and were back at the cave entrance made of countless bones.

“What’s going on?!”

“It’s an illusion!”

Long Chen looked at the Vajra Blood Bat on his shoulder and his expression changed. The next moment, he formed hand seals, and violent Spiritual Strength exploded out of him.

BOOM!

The space before them shattered like glass. They were once more inside the channel and heard the Vajra Blood Bat crying out in a panic again.

This Devil Pupil Ghost Python had actually managed to draw them into an illusion. To draw all five of them into such a perfect illusion at once was terrifying. Long Chen was the first to realize that they hadn’t been transported out because the Vajra Blood Bat on his shoulder had stopped emitting spiritual fluctuations.

They had just escaped from this illusion when a giant gaping maw opened and a powerful suction force directly sucked them toward it. It felt like their souls would be ripped out of their bodies.

“Cloud Piercing Arrow!”

Mo Nian’s roar was like thunder, and his divine bow unleashed an arrow that pierced through the python’s upper mouth and out its nose. It directly shattered its eyes.

At the same time, a talisman flew out from Xia Chen’s hand, sealing its head. This giant Devil Pupil Ghost Python instantly went still.

“How monstrous. They’re all lifeforms that we’ve never seen before. We have no idea about their abilities,” said Guo Ran. From the start to the end, he had no idea what had just happened. He just stood there foolishly, not knowing what to do.

“These lifeforms aren’t from the same era as us. None of us can understand their divine abilities, so we have to be careful. Everything can easily lead to a disaster,” said Mo Nian gravely.

He also didn’t recognize this Devil Pupil Ghost Python. This heavenly tomb was exceedingly dangerous. Every single monster inside of it was frightening.

“This python’s corpse contains quite a bit of primal chaos qi. It has dozens of times more than the other lifeforms we encountered,” said Xia Chen after taking off the talisman and sensing the primal chaos qi that it had just absorbed.

“I’ll keep the fangs,” said Guo Ran, pulling them out.

Long Chen then tossed its corpse into the primal chaos space. It was quickly devoured, emitting an ocean’s worth of life energy. The remnant primal chaos qi was also unleashed, nourishing all the vegetation in the primal chaos space.Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

The Moon Trees also grew another inch despite how slow they usually grew. The black flames around them grew with them.

Huo Linger was like a gluttonous child standing over the Moon Trees. She wished for them to instantly grow into towering trees.

Clearly, the stronger evil corpses had greater life energy and more remnant primal chaos qi.

As these corpses were devoured, the primal chaos space was undergoing a transformation. The Heavenly Dao Tree and the Seven Treasure Colored Glass Tree seemed to glow, practically bursting with life.

After the Devil Pupil Ghost Python was killed, the Ghost Dao lifeforms stayed in the distance, not daring to get closer. As for the Vajra Blood Bat on Long Chen’s shoulder, it was shaking. Clearly, it had been badly frightened just now.

These lifeforms also had perfect counters. These troublemaker ghosts were not powerful, and if they encountered a lifeform that could counter them, they would be easily killed. Hence, they were all terrified and no longer dared to go out.

Long Chen didn’t make things hard on the little fellow. If he gave it the order, it would force its way forward even if it was afraid.

After experiencing the Devil Pupil Ghost Python, everyone was even more cautious. Long Chen and Mo Nian probed the area ahead, Xia Chen and Yue Xiaoqian held the middle position, while Guo Ran brought up the rear. They then advanced slowly.

They quickly encountered more evil corpses. Mo Nian tried changing their disguises many times. But no matter what, they always faced an attack from the evil corpses. After repeated failures, everyone decided to simply toss away the disguises, as these things affected their movements.

Suddenly, they heard some rumbling ahead. Dozens of terrifying evil corpses appeared at once, running out of the darkness. As soon as they appeared, devil qi crashed down upon Long Chen and the others, shaking their souls. Mo Nian was shocked to see dozens of evil corpses of the devil race appear at once.

“Devil Suppressing Seal!”

Yue Xiaoqian suddenly formed seals, and divine light illuminated the channel. Those devil race’s evil corpses instantly turned still.

Xia Chen was delighted, and with a wave of his hand, talismans flew out and sealed them all. With Yue Xiaoqian’s Devil Suppressing Seal, they subdued dozens of evil corpses at once without the slightest effort.

“This move is brilliant!”

Mo Nian freely let out his sincere praise. The original devil race was truly the bane of the devil race. It was no wonder the devil race would hunt them down as soon as they saw each other.

After dealing with these corpses, they continued onwards. As a result, they ended up drawing out over ten Blood race evil corpses. Mo Nian and Long Chen unleashed their full power, and adding on everyone’s cooperation, they barely managed to subdue the evil corpses.

As for Mo Nian, he was almost bitten by one of them. The further they went, the more terrifying the evil corpses grew. Now, they were on the level of the Divine Venerates, getting harder and harder to seal. Furthermore, they were in groups. Drawing them out one by one was not possible.

At this time, the Ghost Dao lifeform on Long Chen’s shoulder told Long Chen that these evil corpses had yet to appear the last time that it was here. They were newly born. The last time it was here, the stronger evil corpses were up ahead.

Long Chen told everyone what it said, causing them to gasp. There were even more terrifying evil corpses up ahead? Could they even continue down this path?

Barging through like what they were doing right now definitely wouldn’t work. They had to think of something. Just as they were in the midst of pondering how to deal with this problem, Mo Nian’s expression suddenly changed.

“Someone else has entered the tomb. They’re behind us.”
