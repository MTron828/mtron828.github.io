Chapter 4230: Mirror World

Countless people charged for the core of the martial stage, their actions seemingly driven by madness. Even the dark creatures in their way were ignored.

BOOM!

Suddenly, terrified screams filled the air as the giant karmic luck bead at the heart of the martial stage rumbled. The next moment, the entire martial stage exploded.

The martial stage was like a shattered mirror. Following that, something even more shocking occurred.

Unexpectedly, another world appeared beneath the martial stage. It was an inverted image of their world, and it was also filled with countless experts.

When the martial stage shattered, the two worlds instantly merged into one, and everything descended into chaos.

The astonishment was not confined to those inside the martial stage alone; even the experts outside were left dumbfounded as they realized that it wasn't solely the martial stage that had undergone this transformation—it was the entire Sage King Prefecture.

“What’s going on?!”

Countless seniors cried out in shock. Even they, with all their experience, were unable to comprehend what had just happened.

The Sage King Prefecture was like a mirror with a world above and a world below. Both of them were identical.

“No wonder there were so many empty sect territories! They weren’t destroyed but were just on the other side!” Startled cries rang out as people saw many familiar faces.

They suddenly realized why so many famous powers had not appeared, why their territories in the Sage King Prefecture were empty. They had previously been curious, as they knew that some of these powers had not been destroyed. So why had they not come to the Sage King Convention?

Now they were shocked to see them on the other side, which was below them. Likewise, the experts on the other side were also shocked to see them.

The martial stage's region had initially been a hemisphere, but now, with the stage gone, it became a complete sphere. Both worlds melded together as one. Following this fusion, everything descended into chaos. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

Long Chen and the others were actually standing above an army of the devil race on the other side. Hence, when the martial stage vanished, they were directly surrounded by the devil race.

“Kill!”

When the devil race’s army saw a small army of the human race, they attacked without hesitation.

“Get your backs to the barrier and climb! The Dragonblood Legion will be the vanguard! Disciples of the Starry River Sect and Battle God Palace, protect the wings! Everyone else, only make your moves when you see a chance. Do not throw the formation into chaos!” Long Chen immediately shouted and flew out.

On Long Chen’s side, there was only a small portion of the human race, while the opposing force consisted of the entire devil race’s army, outnumbering Long Chen and the others by dozens of times. If they were surrounded, that would be dangerous.

“Hahaha, inferior human race, resistance is futile! Ever since ancient times, your human race has always been our prey!” said a devil expert, their powerful devil qi erupting.

“World Extermination Flame Lotus!”

BOOM!

A heaven-shaking explosion reverberated through the area as a lotus unfurled, unleashing a terrifying wave of heat. Even the people outside the martial stage could sense that heat.

In front of countless horrified gazes, the lotus exploded within the core of the devil army, almost wiping all of them out of existence.

In a single powerful strike, tens of millions of devil experts were obliterated, leaving only a few hundred of them remaining in the air. Furthermore, every single one of them was still wrapped in flames and in a wretched state.

“Huo Linger, good job!” During this period, Huo Linger had truly grown increasingly powerful, resulting in an explosive increase in the might of the World Extermination Flame Lotus.

“Hehe, this is nothing. I have even greater power. Big Brother Long Chen, let me kill them all!” Huo Linger cried out excitedly upon receiving Long Chen’s praise.

“No rush. You’ll have your chance in a bit,” responded Long Chen.

After this attack, Long Chen didn’t bother moving again, not even to attack the surviving devil experts.

The ones that had survived this were true experts, Triple Supremes with immense power. However, they had made one mistake: underestimating their enemy.

They had thought that having more numbers meant that they were stronger, but they hadn’t expected Long Chen’s attack to come even faster than their assault. As a result, they didn’t even have a chance to accumulate energy before Long Chen unleashed a casual blow that wiped them out.

Although they had activated their defenses immediately, they still suffered immensely. Now, they had to circulate their full power just to fend off the flames from incinerating them. If Long Chen attacked at this time, he would likely cut off a few heads.

However, Long Chen didn’t do so. This one attack had completely stopped the devil army’s assault. Taking advantage of their shock, he returned to cover everyone as they fell back.

By the time the devil army reacted, Long Chen had managed to create some distance between them and his group. His companions had retreated to the top of the barrier.

Fortunately, the flood of dark creatures was still raging, obstructing the openings between the two factions. The devil race’s army would have to get through the dark creatures first in order to reach Long Chen.

While Long Chen and the others retreated, chaotic battles erupted in other regions as well. After all, multiple races were too close to each other now, so they were attacking and defending as they created boundaries.

On top of this, some true experts were rushing toward the core, tearing a bloody path through the dark creatures with sheer force.

However, when they reached the area right in front of that giant karmic luck bead, they found that there was still a terrifying barrier around it. It was emitting a terrifying divine pressure.

BOOM!

One expert tried to attack that barrier, only for the karmic luck bead to emit a ray of divine light that directly shattered that person’s weapon.

However, this person could be considered intelligent. After using a long-distance attack, he directly left his weapon and hid himself. That was the only reason he managed to evade this dire situation.

Someone else also tried using their soul to commune with the karmic luck bead. The outcome was a harrowing scream, accompanied by their forehead splitting open. In agony, they clutched their head and made a hasty escape.

Those who could reach this place were all experts amongst experts, with absolute confidence in themselves. But in front of this giant sphere, they couldn’t do much.

In truth, some experts were still lurking in the shadows. Even after all these sudden twists and turns, they continued to conceal their power.

Including Long Chen, they all smelled something off about this. Nevertheless, they held a steadfast belief that ultimately, the Sage King title would be determined by a contest of strength, rather than luck or positioning.

Only those who weren’t confident in themselves were trying to get the upper hand at this point. The karmic luck bead did appear, but just as Long Chen had expected, it could not be taken.

“Boss!”

Suddenly, Long Chen heard a cry in the distance and his body quivered. He then saw a group of familiar faces that overwhelmed him with emotion.
