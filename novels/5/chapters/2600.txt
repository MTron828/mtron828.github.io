Chapter 2589 Blood Fiend Devil Lord

“What?!”

Guo Ran and the others were stunned. The man within the blood sun had killed those five elders with a wave of his hand.

Those were five Heaven Merging experts. They were killed just like that? Just who was this person?

Guo Ran and the others’ hearts pounded wildly. Even though they were currently in the Martial Heaven Continent, they felt ice cold. This person was ruthless.

“A group of trash. You couldn’t even protect one of my guards. What is the point of keeping you?” The man within the blood sun finally spoke. His voice was deep and low. However, every word exploded like thunder in people’s ears. They were filled with a bloody feeling.

“Guards?”

Sovereign sprouts were his guards? Looking at the other seven Sovereign sprouts that surrounded him like stars setting off the bright moon, people were even further shocked.

Just who was he? He had eight Sovereign sprouts as guards?

“Who killed my guard?”

The man in the blood sun looked over the Martial Heaven Continent, sending shivers down the people’s souls. It was as if a devil was gazing at them, and their life and death were within his grasp. This was an existence so powerful that they couldn’t even imagine it. Many people involuntarily retreated.

“Me.”

Guo Ran was the only one to step forward. His armor covered him and his manifestation appeared. Even standing on the Martial Heaven Continent didn’t give him any sense of safety.

As soon as he spoke, his hair stood on end. He saw a pair of eyes looking at him from within the blood sun. Those eyes were like ghost flames.

As a result, Guo Ran cried and swung his saber. It appeared as if he had seen a ghost and was just randomly swinging his blade.

However, a hand suddenly appeared in front of him. The man in the blood sun had appeared in front of Guo Ran, the blood sun floating behind him. Guo Ran’s saber was caught between two of his fingers.

Fast. Indescribably fast. Gu Yang, Li Qi, and Song Mingyuan attacked as soon as they reacted, but they had only just moved when the blood sun suddenly expanded.

Gu Yang, Li Qi, and Song Mingyuan felt like a mountain had smashed into them, almost shattering their bones. They spat out blood as they flew back.

Everyone was appalled. Just who was this man? Even after charging into the Martial Heaven Continent, he was ignoring the suppression of the laws. Gu Yang and the others were so powerful that they could slay Heaven Merging experts, but they appeared incredibly weak in front of him.

“Human race ants, learn what respect is.” The man reached toward Guo Ran’s throat.

Guo Ran’s saber was caught between two of this man’s fingers. It felt like they had taken root, and he couldn’t move it in the slightest.

This was a terrifying expert, so terrifying that he surpassed their imagination. At this moment, Guo Ran finally understood why even Sovereign sprouts would be willing to be his guards.

“The cooldown period has ended!” Guo Ran’s armor suddenly exploded with light. His saber finally escaped from this man’s fingers and slashed onto his hand.

BOOM!

Metallic ringing rang out. His hand seemed made out of immortal metal. As a result, Guo Ran’s whole body shook, and his arms felt numb. Even with the full power of the Dragonblood warriors, he was unable to even break his opponent’s arm.

“So that’s what it was. The combined power of a group of ants truly is enough to kill one of my guards,” snorted the man.

“Fuck your mother, you’re the ant!” Guo Ran roared along with the roars of ten thousand dragons, shaking the heavens. The Dragonblood warriors’ power poured into Guo Ran.

BOOM!

A wild tempest exploded. As a result, Guo Ran and the blood sun man retreated at the same time.

“Outside power is external. Once cut off, you become a fangless viper.” The man sneered. His blood sun blazed with light.

The Blood Qi connecting Guo Ran and the Dragonblood warriors was instantly cut off. Right now, Guo Ran was no longer able to fight with their support.

Guo Ran began to panic. This man’s blood sun seemed to have isolated him, putting him in a completely different world from the others.

“Rest in peace. Someone who relies on schemes to win isn’t fit to live in this world.” A fist smashed toward Guo Ran. The image of a blood sun appeared on the fist.

In that instant, Guo Ran was frozen, and the space around him had turned solid. He didn’t know whether or not he would survive this attack. Even if his armor could survive, he might not. Hence, the feeling of death filled him.

“Guo Ran!” Gu Yang, Li Qi, and Song Mingyuan charged over.

“Scram!” The man snorted and the blood sun expanded once more. Space was torn apart. Gu Yang, Li Qi, and Song Mingyuan were sent tumbling back again.

This blood sun possessed a strange power. Gu Yang and the others had no way to counter it.

“You scram.” Just at this moment, an arrogant voice rang out, accompanied by a streak of Sword Qi. After that, Gu Yang and the others felt the pressure crashing down on them instantly vanish.

The man was startled. Even though his fist was about to strike Guo Ran, he hastily retreated.

All of a sudden, the void split apart and a cut appeared on the man’s arm. Golden blood flowed out.

“Fourth captain of Long Chen’s Dragonblood Legion, Yue Zifeng.”

Even though Yue Zifeng’s voice rang out in the air, his figure didn’t appear. Instead, brilliant sword-light continued to tear through the void.

In just a breaths’ time, hundreds of blows were exchanged. At this moment, people finally saw the man’s weapon was a golden halberd.

Before this, he had been fighting barehanded. It was Yue Zifeng who forced him to take out his divine item. Waves of sword-light continued to fill the sky, enveloping the blood sun. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

“It’s a good sword art. But you aren’t a match for me.”

The golden halberd suddenly swung through the air, unleashing a blood-colored river of stars. As a result, the sword-light filling the sky shattered, and Yue Zifeng’s figure finally appeared.

The golden halberd then slashed straight toward Yue Zifeng.

“Not good!” Guo Ran and the others’ hearts sank. Yue Zifeng specialized in offense. He could not receive this attack.

Unexpectedly, the earth then split apart, and black wooden stakes pierced through the air.

“Insignificant.” The man sneered and blasted the wooden stakes apart with a wave of his hand. At the same time, a towering willow tree appeared in the sky, unleashing countless branches that were piercing toward him like sharp swords.

BOOM!

Wooden stakes from below and willow branches from above smashed together, twisting and turning. That immense power caused heaven and earth to rumble.

BOOM!

The man flew out of the wooden stakes, while the golden halberd shot toward Liu Ruyan’s true body.

Liu Ruyan stood atop the willow, forming hand seals. Millions of branches then condensed into a pair of giant hands that closed around him.

BANG!

The golden halberd was firmly caught by the two hands.

“I’ll give this back to you.”

Liu Ruyan sent the golden halberd flying back toward the man with even greater speed.

BOOM!

The man received his weapon with his bare hands. As a result, the blood sun quivered and the void collapsed. However, he managed to receive it.

A surprised expression appeared on his face. “The Undying race? Why would you appear here?”

“That has nothing to do with you,” said Liu Ruyan icily.

The man suddenly laughed. Divine light flowed in his eyes, seeming to see through everything. “The proud Undying race was actually willing to have a human place a spiritual mark on them. Did you become a housepet of the human race? Hahaha, if the Undying race were to learn of this, they’d definitely die of anger.”

“You know the Undying race?” asked Liu Ruyan.

“I have nothing to say to you. Get out of my way, or don’t blame me, the Blood Fiend Devil Lord, for being merciless.” The man finally said his own name.

The experts watching finally understood why he was so terrifying. So he was the Blood Fiend Devil Lord.

“Since there’s nothing to say, I’ll beat it out of you. Everyone else, retreat.” Liu Ruyan frowned. Her giant willow explosively grew. Countless roots reached out like angry dragons, and the earth was constantly exploding. After that, a vast aura spread.

Looking at this scene, the distant experts retreated even further away. They stared in shock as a giant willow grew all the way until it reached the starry sky.

The black clouds covering the Martial Heaven Continent were blown apart by the Undying Willow’s body. It became possible to see the stars in the sky again. They were like fruit hanging between the willow branches.

“Heavens, the Dragonblood Legion is absolutely terrifying!” People’s jaws dropped. They had never seen something so big.

Liu Ruyan suddenly attacked. A black whip appeared in her hand, striking at the Blood Fiend Devil Lord.
