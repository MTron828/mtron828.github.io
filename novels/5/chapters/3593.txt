Chapter 3582

“In truth, at that time, when the Luo clan caused Luo Qingying’s death, their interior was already fractured. The group that trapped Luo Qingying were long since crushed to dust. Actually, those who killed them were also people of the Luo clan. They did this to look after themselves, killing the offenders to appease the anger of the rest of the Alldevil Star-Field. Their actions were correct. By diverting attention and scattering people’s hatred, they made themselves out to be the victims as well. Although the rest of the Alldevil Star-Field rejected them, they didn’t hunt the Luo clan down until they were exterminated. But who would have thought that they would suddenly rise and align themselves with the Alldevil race?” Xue Yifan sighed.

Originally, people thought that the Luo clan had become a third-rate power, and so no one bothered with them. However, unexpectedly, the Luo clan once more sided with the Alldevil race. They had established secret transportation formations that allowed them to extract ore from the territory of the devil beasts. This allowed them to create the best battle armors and weapons and raise a powerful batch of elites.

This was done secretly for hundreds of years. By the time people realized anything was up, it was too late. They were an incredibly powerful threat.

With the Luo clan on the inside, the Alldevil race could directly enter. Under the Luo clan’s directions, their attacks struck the right targets. Countless human territories were destroyed, and their strongholds were annihilated. Furthermore, by using the Alldevil race’s power, they actually sealed the gateways, cutting off the Alldevil Star-Field from the rest of the world, leaving them unable to even request aid.

That wasn’t all. The Luo clan was doing their best to discourage people and had succeeded in drawing some powers to their side. They even formed blood contracts with the Alldevil race.

The Alldevil race swore using their blood that as long as the traitors helped them unify the Alldevil Star-Field, they would not harm a single hair on their heads. They would even allow the traitors to freely mine the ores in this star-field.

As a result, some weak-boned people believed them and gave up fighting against them. They joined the Luo clan’s side, turning sides to point their blades at their fellow humans.

Previously, against just the fierce Alldevil race, people weren’t afraid. After all, they were devil beasts. Despite having powerful bodies, their intelligence was limited. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

However, now, with the Luo clan scheming for them, all kinds of tricks were being used. The human race was repeatedly forced to fall back and took countless casualties. They hated the Luo clan to death.

The Luo clan was originally skilled at scheming, so their mental warfare struck people right in the hearts, causing people to despair. As a result, the entire Alldevil Star-Field was covered in a layer of fear.

“Here in the Heavenly Dragon Divine Armor College, I see everyone is a powerful tiger with plenty of fighting spirit. It seems that things aren’t as grave as you make them out to be. I don’t know about fighting the external forces, but when it comes to fighting the internal forces, it seems that your people are very arrogant.”

That was true. Long Chen was unable to see the slightest worry in the people of the Heavenly Dragon Divine Armor College. They were still fighting amongst themselves, spending their energy on their own people.

Xue Yifan shook his head. “People are foolish because they don’t know their own power. Or perhaps they are afraid that others will not realize just how powerful they are, so they must suppress others to give meaning to their lives. People like that always end up as stepping stones for the experts to climb up. But the world is simply like this. Let me put it this way: without them, the world would not produce any true heroes.”

Long Chen was startled and then nodded. As expected, this dean was truly wise. These words were quite thought-provoking.

However, Guo Ran didn’t understand. He couldn’t help asking, “How are they useful?”

Xue Yifan smiled. “They are the stones applying pressure to you, the shackles binding your feet, and the reins binding your wings. Heroes either silently die under immense pressure or suddenly erupt. If you want to suddenly soar to the heavens in one go, you must free yourselves of the stones, shatter your shackles, and break your reins. Regretfully, you didn’t have that courage. I was always waiting for you to erupt, waiting for you to raise your butcher’s blade. They are all your whetstones. But you refuse to hone yourself against them. You only hid and silently honed your blade. Do you know? In order to become a true expert, you must cut your way through the thorns and thistles. You must possess the will to advance forward bravely. For many things, you absolutely cannot retreat, because once you retreat, your blade will crumble.”

Only then did Guo Ran understand. He prostrated himself in admiration toward the dean’s wisdom. But he still had no regrets. He chortled, “If you want a hero, then that is my boss. He definitely fits your description the best. Boss has fought for a lifetime. If he isn’t fighting, then he’s on the way to his next fight. As for me, well, there is also a place for me. The big whetstones will be left to my boss. I’ll use the small ones.”

Xue Yifan bitterly smiled. “I’ve really slapped myself in the face this time. I’ve grown old and misjudged.”

Originally, Xue Yifan was planning on properly raising Guo Ran. He truly had a very high opinion of him. Thus, when others bullied Guo Ran, he watched, not giving him any help, waiting for the day that Guo Ran would explode from the pressure.

He was always puzzled about why someone with such good talent as Guo Ran would be like this. No matter where he went, he would be a dominating expert. Experts all had their own dignity. So why was this fellow willing to be so cowardly?

But now that Long Chen had come, he finally understood. Guo Ran was like a vine. It didn’t matter how long and thick he grew. Ultimately, he still needed to rely on a large tree, and Long Chen was that tree.

This tree was truly big enough. It could block the wind and rain for Guo Ran. It was what resulted in his character, so all the dean’s efforts and hopes were for naught. Thinking back, he couldn’t help feeling regretful. All of that great talent was wasted on Guo Ran.

Seeing Guo Ran’s shameless appearance, Long Chen couldn’t help smiling. He understood Guo Ran far too well.

This fellow liked to slack off and be lazy. He wouldn’t move until you moved him. Other than forging and showing off, he wasn’t interested in anything.

Even when it came to showing off, it had to be in the simplest way that saved the most energy. Have him carry such a heavy burden? It shouldn’t even be mentioned. This fellow was unable to hold up under any pressure.

“Then what is the situation of the entire Alldevil Star-Field like?” asked Long Chen seriously.

“Up until now, the Alldevil Star-Field as a whole appears acceptable. We are just barely capable of fighting off the Alldevil race. After all, the various major powers have natural strongholds. With the ore veins beneath the land, it is difficult for the Alldevil race to progress past those strongholds. Only some smaller cities are in a very dangerous state, as they are besieged by the Alldevil race. Also, the Luo clan knows that we are unwilling to watch as they are killed. Although we can send them resources, we cannot resolve the actual problem. If this continues for a long time, the human race will definitely be at a disadvantage. The biggest headache is that the human race is still not in a rush, and their fighting spirits are not particularly strong. The worst thing is that the Luo clan is constantly spreading rumors, and under the pressure and enticement, people’s hearts aren’t united. That is the greatest worry,” said Xue Yifan.

Long Chen nodded. Those capable of surviving in the Alldevil Star-Field had to have their own trump cards. The Alldevil race would definitely have difficulty wiping out the human race here. However, as long as people’s hearts were in chaos, there was danger.

“This old man wishes to beg dean Long Chen for aid. Is dean Long Chen willing to listen?” Xue Yifan looked at Long Chen solemnly.

“Go ahead.”

“Dean Long Chen, can you help us resolve this crisis? Lead our human race against the Alldevil race. I am willing to give up the position of dean for you,” said Xue Yifan.

“What?!”

Guo Ran instantly shot up, not daring to believe his ears.
