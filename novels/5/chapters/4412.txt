Chapter 4401 Supreme Blood Ignition, Ten Thousand Swords Fly

Facing the attacks of dozens of Eternal experts, Long Chen was forced to unleash his real power. However, when he summoned the Seven Star Battle Armor, the immense pillar of light was smaller than before.

Its reduced size was not due to a lack of power. Instead, it was the result of his power growing more compressed. The three Eternal experts in front of him were directly blown away by his aura.

BOOM!

With a heaven-shaking explosion, dozens of attacks were sent flying by the pillar of light erupting from Long Chen. Some of those attacks directly shattered, while some went askew. Only five attacks reached Long Chen, but they were already out of energy upon piercing that light pillar. In the end, when they struck Long Chen, they failed to even breach his protective layer of divine light.

As the attacks of dozens of Eternal experts were easily blocked by Long Chen, the expressions of those Eternal experts changed drastically.

“I can’t be left alive? I think you’re the ones who have no purpose being alive,” Long Chen declared, looking at those stupefied experts. Icy killing intent burned in his eyes. Sensing that all of them wanted him to die, he let out a furious roar. “You can all die now!”

Long Chen’s Kunpeng wings spread on his back. Like a bolt of lightning, the Seven Peak Sword slashed down mercilessly.

An Eternal expert could hardly react before being cleaved in two by Long Chen. Long Chen’s speed was so overwhelming that they couldn’t dodge his attack.

Wielding the Seven Peak Sword in his right hand and the Seven Peak Spear in his left, Long Chen was quite ruthless. Some Eternal experts were able to block his first blow, but the second would instantly take their lives.

Long Chen was like a devil god, reaping the lives of Eternal experts, causing rains of Eternal blood to fall.

“Don’t split up! Join forces! We can’t let him pick us off one by one!” shouted an Eternal expert just as Long Chen’s spear fell upon him.

He managed to block Long Chen’s Seven Peak Spear with his Eternal divine weapon. As a result, the Seven Peak Spear shattered, while the Eternal expert hacked up blood from the impact.

BOOM!

The next moment, the Seven Peak Sword was like a viper’s fang piercing his chest.

Seeing an opening, an Eternal expert came charging over with a furious howl, wielding a giant battle-ax. They could all see that they had to be united if they wanted to kill Long Chen. Hence, this attack was to save the pierced Eternal expert.

Long Chen just snorted and swung the Seven Peak Sword with that Eternal expert still hanging on it.

“No!” That Eternal expert cried out, his eyes full of despair. He could only watch as that battle-ax slammed into his head.

BOOM!

The battle-ax mercilessly beheaded him. Ironically, the supposedly life-saving ax became the instrument of death.

“Oh, did you want him dead so badly?” sneered Long Chen.

That ax-wielding Eternal expert was stunned, his fury soaring because of Long Chen’s words. This plot was absolutely sinister.

“I’ll kill you!” His battle-ax slammed toward Long Chen once more. The wielder’s arms bulged as he concentrated all of his power into this one attack.

“Don’t be impulsive!” A startled cry rang out. After all, the ax-wielding Eternal expert was naturally gifted with immense power, standing out as the strongest among them. Whether or not they could defeat Long Chen depended on him.

Afraid that something would happen, the other Eternal experts hastily attacked as well. It wasn’t that they were all united; it was simply that they knew without him, their chances of defeating Long Chen would plummet.

In the distance, the spectators were short of breath. Humans and members of other races alike had never witnessed such a spectacle before. Dozens of Eternal experts were attacking a World King with panicked expressions, their eyes full of fear.

When the ax-wielding Eternal expert slammed his weapon down, Long Chen’s Seven Peak Sword suddenly vanished, replaced by a hand that was covered with stars. A seven-star diagram then appeared at the center of his palm.

As Long Chen clenched his hand into a fist, the stars dimmed, and a ripple exploded out of it. The Eternal expert’s battle-ax slammed into Long Chen’s fist at this moment. Onlookers were utterly stunned as they witnessed Long Chen forsake the Seven Peak Sword and Seven Peak Spear, instead using his fist to block the attack.

BOOM!

To their surprise, the giant Eternal divine ax exploded in front of them. With it destroyed, the fist continued to strike its wielder’s head, crushing it.

In an instant, the other Eternal experts charging toward Long Chen came to a stop, sucking in a cold gasp of air. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

They had been planning on attacking Long Chen with that expert. However, this scene made them instantly turn tail and run.

“They’re running?!” The spectators were even more dumbfounded by this scene. Instead of witnessing a group of Eternal experts attacking a little World King, they were now witnessing them fleeing from one.

However, no one could blame them. In just a brief clash, over ten of them had been slain. With less than forty of them left and their strongest member just crushed by a single punch from Long Chen, it wasn't just a physical defeat but also a blow to their confidence.

He’s no human, he’s a devil, a monster!

Every Eternal expert had the same thought flash through their mind and instantly fled in every direction, not even caring about face. They wanted to survive no matter what.

They knew that Long Chen’s speed was unmatched. Even so, he couldn’t possibly chase every single one of them down. The person that Long Chen chased would definitely die, but then the others would be able to survive. As for who the victim was, that would be a matter of luck, or rather, misfortune.

However, Long Chen’s next move exceeded all of their expectations. Instead of chasing, he was forming hand seals.

As seven-color divine radiance flowed around Long Chen, tens of thousands of Seven Peak Swords condensed in his divine ring behind him.

“Supreme Blood Ignition, Ten Thousand Swords Fly!”

Long Chen did one final set of hand seals, and those tens of thousands of Seven Peak Swords shot out, covering this entire space.
