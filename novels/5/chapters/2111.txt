Chapter 2101 God Extermination Cannon

Long Chen vanished just like that, leaving behind a swirl of dust where his foot had touched the ground.

The dust swirled, but Long Chen had vanished. By the time people reacted, he was already in front of Zhao Wuji, slashing Evilmoon down.

“How fast!” Everyone’s heart shook. Long Chen had just moved so fast that they hadn’t been able to track him at all.

BOOM!

Zhao Wuji raised his sickle blades to block, but the impact was so immense that his arms turned numb. If his blades weren’t connected to his armor, they would have been sent flying.

Long Chen slammed a foot down at Zhao Wuji’s face. Although Zhao Wuji was protected by his armor, his face was still deformed by this attack.

Long Chen’s lightning wings flapped, and he pushed with his foot, smashing Zhao Wuji through several mountains, leaving dust in their wake.

“That’s pretty good.” Beitang Rushuang clenched her fists. Seeing Zhao Wuji being beaten was truly satisfying.

The other experts were shocked by Long Chen’s power, and Ye Lingshan smiled at that a bit mockingly. These ancient geniuses might not have been looking down on her expressly, but she knew that they looked down on cultivators from this current declined era.

They felt a natural superiority, or perhaps it was simply due to how outstanding they had been during their time. They were so arrogant that they didn’t even care to know other people’s abilities. When it came to Long Chen, they had mostly only learned his name. Some of them had even directly come to this gathering after being woken from their slumber. They still thought that this era was theirs, that this was the same era where they had dominated everyone.

Before coming here, Qu Jianying had repeatedly told her to look after Long Chen and be nice to others. Her goal was to form good relationships with these experts. But she found that there was no way for her to join their circle. These experts might maintain polite courtesy, but they had a natural rejection toward her.

The only ones she could count as friends here were Beitang Rushuang and Nangong Zuiyue. The others all inherently looked down on her. How was she supposed to form good relationships with them?

Ye Lingshan was the successor of the Martial Heaven Alliance, and she had her own dignity. These people’s conduct had already irritated her, but there had been nothing she could do about it. Now she was especially satisfied by their shock.

Zhao Wuji let out a furious roar and finally managed to stabilize himself. He forced Long Chen back with a punch.

The devil ape in his manifestation entered a berserk state, its aura growing crazily. At the same time, Zhao Wuji’s armor began shining brighter as he ignited his essence blood.

“Long Chen-!” Zhao Wuji didn’t even have a chance to say any grand words after entering his berserk state. Evilmoon was already slashing toward him.

BOOM!

Zhao Wuji flipped through the air. Even with his manifestation, he wasn’t strong enough.

“This is your so-called foundation? If so, you’ve really disappointed me. If not, then hurry up and show me your so-called foundation. Otherwise, you won’t get a chance to if you wait any longer.” Long Chen shot after Zhao Wuji. With the power of his dragon blood and 108,000 stars coursing through his veins, he felt like he was overflowing with energy.

Evilmoon was just a blur as Long Chen repeatedly forced Zhao Wuji back. If it weren’t for his armor, he’d have long since been killed.

Ye Lingshan looked at Zhao Wuji disdainfully. He was an idiot.

Previously, he had relied on his armor’s mechanisms to put Long Chen at a disadvantage. However, now he wanted to use power to crush Long Chen, all while knowing that power was Long Chen’s strongest point.

Suddenly, Zhao Wuji’s arms exploded, or they seemed to. In reality, his silver scales had lifted up, and rays of light had shot out from beneath.

Evilmoon danced through the air, not allowing a single ray of light to pass. The lights were actually one-inch needles that now scattered through the air.

Just as Long Chen blocked those needles, Zhao Wuji rapidly retreated and tossed a fist-sized sphere at Long Chen.

Seeing that sphere, Long Chen chose to avoid it. However, it suddenly exploded before even reaching him.

When the sphere exploded, it actually shot out a giant silk net that came between Long Chen and Zhao Wuji.

Long Chen snorted and swung Evilmoon. Just as the net was contracting around him, Evilmoon cut a large hole in it which Long Chen flew through.

“That weapon of Long Chen’s is quite sharp. It’s actually able to slice through Heavenly Horn Dragon Silkworm’s silk,” said Beitang Rushuang. She instantly recognized that high grade silk. A single strand of it with the width of a human hair could hold up a mountain.

For Long Chen to be able to pierce straight through it didn’t just require technique and speed. Due to how it fluttered through the air, only an incredibly sharp weapon would be able to cut it.

“Not good!” Beitang Rushuang suddenly let out a startled cry.

Zhao Wuji had tossed out dozens of spheres at the same time. They all exploded, unleashing layers of nets that enveloped Long Chen.

Long Chen could tear through one of them, but against so many, there was no way he had time to cut them one by one.

“Face your death!” Seeing Long Chen enveloped by the nets, Zhao Wuji roared furiously, and a giant cylinder appeared on top of his shoulder.

That cylinder was three meters long and as wide as a barrel. There were countless flowery marks carved on it. When it appeared, all the experts felt a chill.

“The Mechanism Sect’s killer divine item, the God Extermination Cannon!”

The runes on the God Extermination Cannon lit up. Zhao Wuji’s scales also began to shine brightly as he sent Heavenly Dao energy surging into the God Extermination Cannon. The mouth of the cannon pointed at Long Chen who was entangled with the giant nets. It began to store a horrifying amount of power.

Clearly, Zhao Wuji no longer minded wasting so much of the Heavenly Horned Dragon Silkworm’s silk if it could trap and allow him to kill Long Chen. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

As long as the nets delayed Long Chen for a breath’s time, then the God Extermination Cannon would be fully charged. After that, even if Long Chen had ten lives, he wouldn’t be able to survive.

No one could instantly pierce through dozens of nets made of that powerful silk. In Zhao Wuji’s eyes and the eyes of the majority of experts present, Long Chen was already dead.

Zhao Wuji’s own battle power wasn’t very strong. His strongest aspect lay in the Mechanism Sect’s unending-layered mechanisms. At this point, even Nangong Zuiyue and Beitang Rushuang’s expressions changed.

Just as the layers of nets were about to fully trap Long Chen, a strange flame exploded out of Long Chen, one that strangely looked like a curtain of water. Those nets were instantly incinerated.

“Inverse Dao Water Spirit Flame?!”

Startled cries rang out once more. All the experts here recognized that flame.

Amongst the crowd, the Pill Fairy’s pupils shrank. Long Chen’s control over the Inverse Dao Water Spirit Flame was not the slightest bit inferior to her own.

Those tough nets were like spiderwebs entering lava. They silently vanished.

That sight stunned Zhao Wuji. He still hadn’t finished storing up energy. If the God Extermination Cannon had been fully charged, then Long Chen would definitely die.

However, he was now caught too early. Long Chen’s figure vanished, and he reappeared in front of Zhao Wuji, grabbing the God Extermination Cannon and kicking Zhao Wuji in the chest.

Zhao Wuji’s soul almost fled when Long Chen pointed the God Extermination Cannon at him. It had just finished storing up energy. It didn’t need any more energy from his armor and could be activated any time.

“No-!”

Seeing that black light converging at the mouth of the cannon, Zhao Wuji let out a furious roar. However, that black light still shot out.

Long Chen held on tightly to the God Extermination Cannon, but he was still sent flying back a hundred miles from the huge force. He almost lost consciousness from that impact.

A black pillar of light tore through the sky. The cannon had instantly grown in size upon shooting, unleashing a pillar of black light hundreds of meters thick. Everything, where that black light went by, was destroyed.

Wherever it passed, all that remained was a black channel. Within that channel, time was still. It was filled with the scent of death.

That black channel lasted for several seconds in the air before slowly faded.

However, even once it faded, the experts present couldn’t help quivering. Perhaps the God Extermination Cannon really could slay a god if it hit them. In any case, there was no way a physical body could block it.

“Cough...”

When the light dissipated, it revealed someone coughing on the ground. Seeing that figure, people were stunned.

“Zhao Wuji!”
