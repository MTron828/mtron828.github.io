Chapter 4389 World King Pill

The Dragonblood Legion then departed, leaving behind Bai Letian, the palace master, and hundreds of Eternal experts in the palace.

“Dean, I feel like Long Chen knows too much. This much pressure is not a good thing for him,” remarked an Eternal expert.

“Yes, they’re practically children. That is the time when they should be carefree. Yet, whether it is Long Chen or the Dragonblood warriors, they all mature too fast. They all have a level of maturity and responsibility unbefitting of their age,” sighed another Eternal expert.

The Dean shook his head. “There is no way around it. They grew up in the midst of hardship, so whether it was Long Chen or the Dragonblood warriors, they could only walk through the thorny path of cultivation themselves. Every step came with life and death hanging in the balance. In comparison, Shishi and Xiaole are like children who haven't faced such hardships. That’s the difference. If no one shelters the children with an umbrella, they must brave the rain themselves. If they can make it through, they survive. If not, they perish. That’s just the cruelty of cultivation.”

When it came to Long Chen’s experiences, Bai Letian understood more than anyone present. Behind Long Chen's power lay an inconceivable amount of pain and torment. People only saw his radiance, not the mountains of hardships behind him.

One of the experts said, “That is why I am worried about Dean Long Chen. What if he cannot achieve the result we want? We’re not lacking arrogant people, but their power often falls short of their arrogance. Dean Long Chen is undoubtedly powerful, but he’s too mature. It seems he has transcended the age of arrogance. I don't know if he-”

“Our human race is grappling with a crisis of confidence. People’s hearts are in disorder. If we fail to produce a hero, the human race will crumble. The various worlds are closely monitoring our High Firmament Academy, and even Lord Brahma is in hiding. The High Firmament Academy can remain silent no longer. Within danger, there is opportunity. Many factions are secretly accumulating power, knowing that the first target of those worlds will be the High Firmament Academy. As long as we stand firm, they don’t have to worry and can peacefully develop. However, we don’t have the luxury to do so. We must counterattack to take back the initiative. The reason so many of us gathered here today was to give Dean Long Chen confidence. We don’t want him worrying about the consequences right now as he has to run rampant. However, I really don’t understand the look in his eyes when he left. I don’t know if he will be able to fight freely,” said the vice lightning palace master.

“All of you are worrying for nothing.”

Suddenly, the palace master spoke, and everyone turned to him.

“You all don’t understand him. Long Chen actually doesn’t like to use his head. He prefers to rely on simple force. It's only when his power falls short that he has to employ his intellect, analyzing the situation to achieve the maximum gain at the minimal cost. Long Chen has always been fighting against adversity, so he had no choice but to be meticulous, or he’d have long since died. Now, with our support, he is more clear-minded than anyone about what he needs to do. You’re worrying that he won’t cause enough trouble? Hehe… I’m worried that he’ll cause so much trouble that we won’t be able to handle it.”

“What?”

Those Eternal experts looked at each other, and the entire palace fell silent.

…

Three days later, Long Chen was the first to come out of seclusion. Despite sustaining the most severe injuries, his wounds healed rapidly. The abundant life energy within the primal chaos space healed his injuries well.

In his opinion, the reason he needed three days to recover was because of the Saint’s power lingering in his wounds.

Had it not been for the red-haired man, the wounds inflicted by the Eternal experts wouldn't have taken this long to heal.

However, this realization also served as a warning for Long Chen. In the future, he couldn't afford to be careless when facing Saints. A single misstep, and the consequences could be fatal.

With Long Chen’s power restored, his realm also advanced to the first Heavenstage of the World King realm, a progress attributed to the consecutive intense battles that had triggered his instincts.

“It’s too bad that I’ve been too busy to make medicinal pills. With their help, I could have reached the third Heavenstage by now, maybe even the fourth Heavenstage,” grumbled Long Chen.

Long Chen had consumed an unimaginable number of medicinal pills in his lifetime. Over time, Long Chen had formed a gradual resistance to the effects of medicinal pills, and the best way to trigger this effect now was the stimulation of a life-and-death battle. Unfortunately, he had missed this chance.

Long Chen felt helpless about it himself. Refining pills didn’t require him to pay attention as he could just let Huo Linger and the Earth Cauldron do it. However, doing so for a prolonged time would affect her condition, and Long Chen couldn’t afford this during a big battle. As one of Long Chen’s strongest trump cards, Huo Linger had to remain in her peak condition at all times to guard against any unexpected dangers.

While the pills were important, the battle against the Great Desolate World and the humanless world was even more crucial. Thus, during that period, Huo Linger wasn’t refining anything.

So, the first thing Long Chen did after coming out of seclusion was to enter the primal chaos space and refine World King Pills with Huo Linger.

At this moment, the Earth Cauldron quivered, and its runes lit up. Long Chen sighed, “When I wanted your help during a fight, you pretended to be asleep. But when it comes to refining pills, you’re quite awake.”

The Earth Cauldron’s runes were selective in assisting Long Chen, offering their aid only when he was engaged in refining pills. It seemed that the act of refining pills was the only occasion when it willingly cooperated with Long Chen and engaged in communication.

“Heavenly World Grass.”

“Ten Thousand Tribulation Root.”

“Three Flower Fruit.”

“Fantasy Water Lily.”

“Ah, that’s right, the Fantasy Water Lily can be replaced with the Devil Eye Water Lily for even greater effect.”

As Long Chen gathered the medicinal ingredients, he suddenly recalled that one of the main ingredients could be replaced by a seventh-tier Devil Eye Water Lily. The seventh-tier Devil Eye Water Lily held an equivalent cultivation level to the Heaven Venerate realm.

Speaking of this, Long Chen was reminded of Lian Wuying. She had transformed into a seed after their confrontation on the Sage King martial stage, and Long Chen had tossed that seed into the primal chaos space.

He had forgotten about that matter. When Long Chen advanced to the World King realm, the primal chaos space instantly grew once more, causing the three thousand Fusang Trees and Moon Trees to move autonomously and claim their own territories.Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

However, they all maintained a set distance from each other as if forming some kind of formation.

As for the place where he had planted the seed, it was occupied by a Fusang Tree. The lily pool was now gone.

Long Chen started to search for them. In a shadowy corner of the primal chaos world, he found a black pool.

This pool had tens of thousands of devil lilies. They were enormous, but in front of the Fusang Trees, they appeared unremarkable. Without specifically looking for them, he wouldn’t have known where they had run off.

“Damn, so they have all reached the seventh tier. Good, good. I’ll refine some supreme World King Pills with them.”

Long Chen was delighted to find them and immediately gathered them for alchemy.
