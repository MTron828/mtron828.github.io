Chapter 3933 Devil Demonic Poison𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

“We’re safe, we’re finally safe! Every time I close my eyes, I still see those sinister faces. I think I really was frightened out of my wits in the last battle. Did I perhaps get old?”

The moment Guo Ran stepped through the Wine God Palace’s gate, he directly collapsed. Sensing the peaceful air around him, he felt like all the energy supporting his body had suddenly vanished.

Even while Xia Guhong was bringing them here, Guo Ran was on edge, afraid of encountering some demon midway through the journey. The last battle had really shaken his heart and soul.

It wasn’t just him. Xia Chen was the same as he felt like his entire body was going to collapse. His tense heart finally relaxed at this moment.

“You guys have been struck by the devil demonic poison. That’s why you feel that way. It has nothing to do with guts,” said Xia Guhong with a faint smile.

“Devil demonic poison? What’s that?” Long Chen had never heard of such a poison. Guo Ran and Xia Chen were also startled and got nervous again.

“It is a kind of spiritual poison and also a kind of corpse poison. When you fought Shi Yang, Shi Yang sacrificed countless devil experts to awaken that corpse along with the devil demon runes on it. Fortunately, he didn’t know how to properly use it. That is a divine ability possessed only by the emperors of the winged devil race. Once they unleash it with their full power, well, considering your current Spiritual Strengths, you would instantly be turned into madmen,” explained Xia Guhong.

Hearing this, Long Chen and the other two gasped. That immemorial devil corpse had been terrifying enough. Fortunately, even after sacrificing so many devil experts, Shi Yang hadn’t managed to draw out its full power.

“Don’t worry, with your willpower, even if you just ignore it, it will vanish within a few months. If you wish to resolve it faster, then consuming wine or eating pills can heal it in just a few days. It’s nothing to worry about,” said Xia Guhong with a smile.

“Good, good. I thought that my Dao-heart had grown unsteady! I thought I had been broken.” Guo Ran sighed with relief and laughed.

“In truth, all things have a bad side and a good side. If your willpower is strong enough, you can turn this poison into a mental trial for yourselves. Use your willpower to resist it, and it will be quite beneficial. It will stimulate the growth of your Spiritual Strength until the poison disappears,” said Xia Guhong.

Hearing that, Long Chen was instantly at ease. All Dragonblood warriors had top level willpower, so they weren’t afraid of this kind of corrosion. The only one that could be vulnerable to such a thing was right beside him.

“Hehe, I feel like my Spiritual Strength is enough. I don’t need such a trial. I think I should focus on forging new armor and weapons for the Dragonblood Legion! My time is very limited, don’t you think so, boss?” Guo Ran smiled at Long Chen.

Long Chen curled his lips. This fellow always had this lazy nature, always running or hiding from troublesome things. But he also had a valid excuse this time, so Long Chen couldn’t force him.

In the three thousand worlds, the Dragonblood Legion had shown their terrifying combat power, but their main weakness was also glaringly obvious. It was the lack of suitable weapons.

If they each had suitable weapons, then with the support of the dragon blood, the power that they could unleash in their formation would rise by more than ten times.

Let alone ordinary heavenly geniuses, even peak experts like Shi Yang, Yin Changsheng, Weng Tianyao, and the likes would be stopped by their formation if they had suitable weapons. They might not even have a chance to flee.

Furthermore, when the Dragonblood Legion reunited this time, they were forced into a small formation. Although their cooperation was still excellent, it was greatly different from the perfect formations that they had used on the Martial Heaven Continent.

If the problem with the formation and weapons was solved, Long Chen was confident that even without him, his brothers would have had enough power to wipe away all their enemies this time.

“Big brother Guhong, how many secret realms opened this time? It wasn’t just the three thousand worlds, right?” asked Long Chen suddenly.

In the three thousand worlds, Long Chen only had a chance to ask some simple questions. From Bai Xiaole, he learned about the situation in the High Firmament Academy. Other than Bai Shishi, Bai Xiaole, Qing Feng, and Qi Yu, the other disciples from the High Firmament Academy had not entered the three thousand worlds.

They had gone to another secret realm called the Heavenly Origin World. It was said that this time, they went to different secret realms because of the dean’s orders.

Long Chen had heard of the Heavenly Origin World from Long Aotian. Long Aotian had been glad that he hadn’t gone to the Heavenly Origin World and had instead chosen to come to the three thousand worlds. Of course, Long Chen was also glad that Long Aotian had chosen to go to the three thousand worlds, or Luo Zichuan’s efforts would have been for nothing.

“There are actually many that open this time. There is the Heavenly Origin World, the Five-color Heavenly Lake, the Peakless Island, the Jiuli immortal realm…” Xia Guhong listed off dozens of names before saying, “However, a person cannot set foot on two different paths. The Violet Flame Heaven Capital was the closest opening back then, and I can only guarantee your safety within this region. Thus, I helped you choose the three thousand worlds. You won’t blame me, right?”

“Of course not. I’m incredibly grateful. Junior brother has profited immensely in the three thousand worlds,” laughed Long Chen.

He naturally wouldn’t blame Xia Guhong. First, without counting the ancestral dragon reverse scale, just the bronze cauldron alone was already an absolutely priceless treasure, something that even caused that mysterious dragon expert to be moved. Furthermore, he had also obtained the Moon Trees and Fusang Trees, as well as countless powerful corpses. Every single one of those things would have made the trip worth it.

As for Xia Chen and Guo Ran, they had gained countless materials and runes for their forging and inscription arts. Overall, they had all profited.

As Xia Guhong explained things, the three of them learned that the changes in the world were not concentrated in just one place. All kinds of special lands of destiny had opened at once, and some powerful sects would decide where to send their disciples based on their unique aptitudes.

Long Chen smiled. This was an estimate based on the risk and possible gains. There was no profit without risk. As the greater the profits, the greater the risks.

It was unfortunate for those that had come to the three thousand worlds. If they had not set their sights on Long Chen’s dragon scale, they wouldn’t have died. But humans truly were willing to die for treasures. Greed made people crazy and lose their minds.

When they returned to the Wine God Palace, Guo Ran shamelessly found a senior from the Wine God Palace for a jug of poison-expelling wine to remove his spiritual poison.

As for Xia Chen, he chose to use this poison to increase his own Spiritual Strength. After all, a Talisman Master needed a strong Spiritual Strength as the foundation, so he naturally wouldn’t give up such a good tempering chance.

The three of them directly went into seclusion. Three days later, Long Chen had fully recovered. As his mind descended into the primal chaos space, he smiled.

“Hehe, let me appraise my gains this time.”
