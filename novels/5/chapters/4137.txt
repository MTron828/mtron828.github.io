Chapter 4126: Opportunity

Long Chen and the others left the Silver Moon World. But on the other side of the gate, they did not see anyone from the Heavenly Tiger race.

Perhaps the latter had lost too much face this time and didn’t wish to stick around any longer than they needed to, so they had directly flown off.

“Should we chase? I can tell their general direction. If we chase after them now, we might be able to catch up to them,” said Xia Chen.

“Don’t bother.” Long Chen shook his head. “They’re nothing more than Lord Brahma’s dogs, and they only came to test us. Even if we kill them, it’s meaningless. There’s no need to expose too much of our power.”

“In truth, I also want to test out that Supreme heavenly genius of the Heavenly Tiger race,” said Guo Ran.

“It seems that you’ve upgraded your battle armor again?” Looking at how eager Guo Ran was, Long Chen knew that Guo Ran must have improved himself lately.

“Hehe, it’s all thanks to the Soaring Dragon Company’s blessing. I found quite a few good things, and I also traded some things with the Huayun Trading Company. Right now, I really want to find someone to test my new battle armor,” said Guo Ran confidently.

During their plundering this time, Xia Chen had been in charge of choosing the locations, the planning, and the overall operation, so Guo Ran had taken the chance to upgrade the materials and runes of his battle armor.

It went without saying that the Soaring Dragon Company had a really thick foundation. With countless immortal metals from their treasuries, Guo Ran fully upgraded his Devil Dragon Battle Armor and embedded many new runes onto it.

Guo Ran was someone who couldn’t keep secrets. Thus, the Heavenly Tiger race had been his chance to test and show off his new battle armor.

Regretfully, the Heavenly Tiger race was too much of a coward, giving him no chance to do so. Seeing such cowards, Guo Ran felt rather helpless.

“Wait, I just noticed…!”

Surprised, Long Chen pointed at the swords on the Dragonblood warriors’ backs. Only now did he note that they were different from before.

Although their shape was the same, the marks on the scabbards and hilts were different. Also, their auras were more sinister, as though ancient bloodthirsty beasts had been sealed into the swords.

“Hehe, when I eat the meat, I naturally have to share the soup with my brothers. Haha, the Heavenly Tiger race really is filled with cowards! I was hoping that my brothers could show off a bit this time, but they gave us no chance. What a waste,” said Guo Ran.

Long Chen finally understood why Guo Ran and Xia Chen had been so eager to fight the Heavenly Tiger race. It turned out that they had made huge improvements during this time and wanted to show off to Long Chen.

“Hahaha, there’s no rush. The Sage King Convention is the real stage where we’ll show the world our power. The Dragonblood Legion could sweep through the Martial Heaven Continent, and it can also sweep through the nine heavens and ten lands,” Long Chen laughed heroically.

“Aiya, if I had known this earlier, I wouldn’t have pretended to be Mo Nian! I’d have directly reported the name of the Dragonblood Legion!” said Guo Ran regretfully.

“You really said that you were Mo Nian?” Long Chen was startled. He had thought that they were just joking.

“Of course. Every time, I chanted his verse before plundering them.”

Long Chen instantly felt cold sweat on the back of his neck. This little fellow really was sinister; he had actually tossed this crap to Mo Nian.

Mo Nian only plundered dead people, so wasn’t this ruining his reputation? Long Chen was speechless. Back then, they had agreed that Long Chen would be in charge of plundering the living, while Mo Nian would plunder the dead. When Mo Nian learned about this, he would definitely be enraged.

However, thinking about it, Mo Nian wasn’t so petty. Guo Ran could probably say a few fawning words, and it would be over.

“Let’s go. We’ll go to the Sage King Star-Field. Perhaps our other brothers have arrived there,” said Long Chen.

After that, Xia Chen summoned the flying boat, and they flew off. After Long Chen was on board, he realized that this was also a new flying boat.

It was faster than the old flying boat, and it broke through space exceptionally steadily. It was very comfortable.

The flying boat didn’t go straight to the Sage King Star-Field. Instead, they flew to the closest city.

It was a settlement of the demon race. However, with the Sage King Convention about to start, the world had entered a rare state of ceasefire. Because of it, many transportation formations connecting the various major worlds were open to all.

As long as they didn’t cause trouble, they could even take the transportation formations for free. After all, all races were restraining themselves, doing their best to avoid large conflicts.

This was the territory of the Golden Blood Python race. When Long Chen and his companions came off the flying boat, they directly entered the city and received unfriendly gazes from the experts of the Golden Blood Python race. However, they didn’t make things hard on Long Chen and the others.

Long Chen paid a world king crystal for each of his brothers as the entrance fee, and then they had free reign. After that, they bought quite a few things in the city.

Although these people didn’t conceal their hostility toward the human race, they didn’t refuse to trade with them.

“Boss, this is a good chance. The Sage King Convention is about to start, so we can buy some rare things from the various races. Many of those things are hard to buy during normal times,” said Guo Ran excitedly after buying many rare materials.

Xia Chen also bought quite a few materials for inscriptions. These were normally things that they couldn’t buy, and even the Huayun Trading Company was unable to acquire them.

Even though the Huayun Trading Company was spread throughout the nine heavens and ten lands, some races didn’t do business with them. Thus, Long Chen and his companions could only acquire some materials from the locals.

The most exciting thing was that these rare materials were dirt cheap here. They could even trade away things that weren’t worth much money for these rare items.

Long Chen was very moved. Here, he could buy dozens of rare medicinal ingredients that even the Huayun Trading Company couldn’t get for him.

Long Chen nodded. “It really is a good opportunity. Let’s stroll through a few major cities. We have money, so we’ll see what we can buy. When the Sage King Convention is over, we might not get such a chance again.”

Originally, they had been planning on flying straight through these places, but with this discovery, they were in no rush. They then made a transportation-formation itinerary to go through more varied cities.

They went to over ten cities in one go, but not every city was so inclusive. Some of them despised the human race to the point that, while they didn’t attack Long Chen and the others, they did keep them out of the city. The harsher ones did not even allow them to use their transportation formations, let alone do business with them.

Guo Ran and the others were so angry that they wanted to tear down their cities, but under the advice of several human elders, they ended up leaving without a fuss.

Fortunately, the majority of the cities were not so extreme, so Long Chen and the others could make huge gains. Long Chen alone had gathered tens of thousands of rare medicinal ingredients during this time. Their value was normally incalculable, but he practically got them for free.

The further they went, the friendlier the cities became. After all, they were slowly getting closer to the Sage King Star-Field.

However, when they neared the border of the Sage King Star-Field, Long Chen suddenly sensed something off. Somehow, quite a few people were keeping an eye on him, and a few true experts were gazing at him with sharp killing intent.

“Boss, not good!”

Long Chen was in the midst of buying medicinal ingredients in the city when Xia Chen suddenly ran over with a grave expression.
