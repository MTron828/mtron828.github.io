Chapter 4353: Barbarian Dragon Tears the Heavens

A wave of black dragon breath devoured the incoming experts, instantly roasting them to the point that a burnt smell wafted out of their charred forms.

The sudden turn of events startled everyone. These newcomers were from the humanless world and clearly on the same side as the Kunpeng. However, their speed was behind that of a Kunpeng, so they were one step slower.

When they saw the Kunpeng being torn apart, they had a bad feeling and wanted to run, but the palace master didn’t give them that chance.

The dragon breath originated from the essence blood of the palace master. It wasn't fire but something even more menacing than flames. Hence, despite being Eternal experts, the newcomers couldn’t resist that attack, and their screams of misery echoed through the air.

“Barbarian Dragon Tears the Heavens!”

The palace master let out a furious shout. Following that, his two dragon claws reappeared and tore the void apart with force. A giant spatial crack then spread toward that group of experts.

When the crack reached them, a berserk power used it as a vector to directly strike them, blasting them apart. In an instant, seven Eternal experts were vanquished, their Yuan Spirits crushed.

Eternal blood rained down, soaking into this world. The lingering scent of blood in the air sent shivers down the spines of everyone present.

Having swiftly dispatched the Eternal experts, the palace master lifted his head and let out a mighty roar. A dragon's cry pierced the clouds, reverberating through the sky.

This roar contained a regal qi, an aura that suppressed the ten thousand Daos, forcing heaven and earth to change color. It was a cry that forced all others to submit without being able to summon the slightest will to resist.

In the distance, the void quivered and some small ripples manifested. Some terrifying experts with the air of Eternity were hiding there.

Yet, with a single roar from the palace master, they scattered like frightened rabbits, disappearing and leaving only a few ripples in their wake.

The onlookers didn’t manage to see their appearance. However, considering that there were hundreds of small ripples, hundreds of Eternal experts must have come. Alas, they were all scared away by the palace master.

Hundreds of talismans now appeared in the air and started to devour the falling Eternal blood. Xia Chen was getting to work.

After all, those slain individuals were true Eternal experts. The palace master had killed them, and now their pure essence blood was raining down. Xia Chen naturally wouldn't let such a precious resource go to waste.

Most importantly, an Eternal corpse’s body was incredibly strong, capable of enduring for ten thousand years without showing the slightest sign of aging. However, upon death, its essence blood and soul would be reabsorbed by heaven and earth.

If the body was kept intact, then its essence blood and soul would not decay as quickly. They could easily last millions of years.

However, if a corpse were to explode, its essence blood and soul would be quickly devoured by the Heavenly Daos. Hence, Xia Chen swiftly gathered the essence blood as he knew that this was a fight against time. His goal was to refine the pure Eternal blood.

The palace master then slammed the Kunpeng’s corpse to the ground and spat on it.

“Peh, trash bird. You ruined my plans. Otherwise, they wouldn’t have had a chance to run.”

Hearing this, everyone was shocked to learn that the palace master had planned on killing all of those Eternal experts. A revelation then struck them. Previously, the palace master had conserved his power to bait those experts into attacking.

However, due to the longstanding enmity between the Kunpeng race and the dragon race, that Kunpeng just had to say something that triggered the palace master to lose control and directly kill him. As a result, the palace master’s power was exposed. After that, though the closest seven Eternal experts got a bad feeling and tried to run, they were unable to escape the palace master’s attack range and were swiftly dispatched in one blow.

However, that was the palace master’s limit, and he was unable to catch the third wave of experts. Seeing them flee, he could only let out a dragon roar to vent his rage.

The onlookers couldn’t help but shudder as they gazed at the palace master’s large figure. He was incredibly powerful, unreasonably so. The humanless world’s top experts were nothing in front of him.

During the Sage King Convention, the palace master had never experienced a truly satisfying fight, leaving him dissatisfied. Now, thanks to the Kunpeng's provocation, he lost another opportunity for a fulfilling battle, further fueling his rage.

The palace master's overwhelming power struck terror into those witnessing it. Fortunately, this terrifying monster was standing on the same side as the human race. If he were on the side of the demonic beast race, the human race might be doomed.

The idea of him as an enemy terrified the onlookers. However, with him standing beside them, they felt secure, as if they had a protector.

“In the senior generation, we have the palace master, and in the junior generation, we have Dean Long Chen. We have nothing to fear against those other lifeforms!” shouted an expert of the senior generation with deep emotion.

Just as he said, the palace master was able to suppress the opposing Eternal experts, while Long Chen was the leader of the new generation, showcasing unparalleled power with limitless potential for the future. At the very least, the human race would not be crushed in this generation.

Even if a war between the ten thousand races started, the human race would not be doomed. At the very least, they would have some ability to resist.

Ever since the Sage King Convention ended and the gate to the other world appeared, numerous pessimistic individuals believed the human race had no hope. Hence, many had started establishing connections with other races, hoping to survive the impending apocalypse.

This situation both angered and panicked people. They didn’t want to be enslaved or die, leading to days filled with worry and unease.

However, today, Long Chen’s tribulation and the palace master’s attack made them see hope once more.

“Long Chen!”

Even when everyone's attention was drawn by the palace master, two people never diverted their gazes from Long Chen.

Bai Shishi and Yu Qingxuan ran over to the collapsing Long Chen, catching him and discovering that he was unconscious.

The golden lotus in his hand was gone, and now there were things akin to whirlpools on his hands, feet, chest, and abdomen.

“It’s the power of the Six Daos.”

The expression of Bai Xiaole’s mother changed upon seeing those six whirlpools. “Long Chen cannot subdue the power of the Six Daos on his own. He needs help.”

She reached out to touch him, only to be stopped by the palace master. “Long Chen doesn’t want to let go of this power, so he has used his own body to restrain and absorb it. If you were to release it, his efforts would have been for nothing.”

“Long Chen… he’s being too reckless!” Bai Xiaole’s mother was alarmed. Was Long Chen really trying to devour the power of the Six Daos?

.

“If he wasn’t reckless, how could he summon the hand of the heavens? But don’t worry. This little fellow won’t die. Let’s go for now. Those cowardly fellows have probably been frightened and won’t dare to come back,” said the palace master. He looked back in the direction of the humanless world and simply curled his lips into a sneer. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

In the end, they carefully carried Long Chen away in front of countless gazes, leaving this ruined sacred tribulation land behind them.
