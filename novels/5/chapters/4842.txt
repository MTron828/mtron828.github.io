Chapter 4831 Arrogant Disciples

Hearing this, Long Chen turned around to see five youngsters dressed in violet robes similar to Lu Ziyu's, each emanating a potent aura. They were all nine star Doyens.

What stood out the most was the divine radiance enveloping them and the Heavenly Dao runes fluctuating around them, marking them as exceptionally powerful even among nine star Doyens.

Among them were three men and two women, all youthful and attractive. However, the immense arrogance reflected in their eyes tainted their otherwise striking appearance.

“Chengfeng, don’t be rude!” Lu Ziyu reprimanded sharply when she noticed Long Chen’s frown and Mo Nian’s frosty gaze.

These people misjudged Long Chen and his companions, much like what Lu Ziyu had done. Unfortunately, they didn’t know that Mo Nian possessed a Golden Devil Fall Tablet, which was enough to command their respect and admiration.

“Seventh sister, what’s going on? Did big sister invite these four to watch her fight? Isn’t that... wasteful?” asked Lu Chengfeng, one of the men. “Why did she give these important spots to outsiders? Many people inside our family didn’t even get to watch her fight.”

Every participant could invite ten people to watch their battle from premium seats, which were highly coveted and unavailable for purchase.

Since Lu Ziqiong had given out four of those precious spots to outsiders, Lu Chengfeng and the others were rather speechless. Moreover, among these four, one wasn't even a Doyen, another was recovering from a serious illness, and the remaining two were too weak to even withstand a single attack from them. Naturally, Lu Chengfeng and the others were dissatisfied with this arrangement.

Another disciple couldn’t help but say, “The family’s Elders will definitely scold big sister when they learn of it.”

Lu Qingfeng looked at Long Chen and the others, apathetically saying, “If you are wise, you’ll immediately—”

“Qingfeng!” Li Ziyu shouted furiously. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

However, that other disciple still sneered, “Just like a tree has bark, a person should have some fa—”

Pow!

All of a sudden, a powerful slap struck that disciple's face, catching him off guard. He could do nothing but endure the blow, his mouth bleeding.

“Seventh sister! You...” That disciple was shocked and enraged. The other disciples were also lost, not expecting Lu Ziyu to be so heavy-handed.

“They are big sister’s friends, so you have to respect them just like big sister does. This is her decision. Even if the Elders criticize her because of it, it is still big sister’s affairs. She doesn’t need your opinion. In any case, just stay quiet and wait for big sister’s fight to end before speaking again, understood?” ordered Lu Ziyu in a harsh tone.

She had looked down on Long Chen and his companions, just like her fellow disciples. However, from Long Chen’s gaze and Mo Nian’s tablet, she was aware that her senses were wrong.

She understood that her big sister had to have a reason for inviting them. As a result, she wanted to make things clear to her fellow disciples.

If Long Chen and the others were angered and left because of them, Lu Ziqiong would definitely blame Lu Ziyu and the others. Then all of them would be in trouble.

Long Chen had been on the verge of leaving just now, not caring about giving Lu Ziqiong face. After all, he couldn’t allow himself to suffer this kind of nonsense. However, Lu Ziyu’s unexpected slap vented some of his anger, so he chose to stay and watch the fight.

The Lu family’s young disciples were all baffled by Lu Ziyu, unable to understand why she would unleash her wrath on them.

Seeing that they were too scared to say anything further, Lu Ziyu turned back to Long Chen and Mo Nian to explain. “These are a few immature disciples of my Lu family. They’ve always been under the protection of the family’s elders and the Violet Palace Sect, so they’ve gotten arrogant despite their lack of ability. I’m sorry you had to see that.”

Lu Ziyu’s face suddenly turned frosty, and she shouted at Lu Chengfeng, “Chengfeng, come and apologize to this junior sister.”

Lu Chengfeng was filled with disbelief, looking from Yu Tong to Lu Ziyu. Clenching his teeth, he didn’t say a word. In his eyes, experts could not lower their heads to the weak.

“You!” Lu Ziyu raised her hand once more. Seeing that Lu Ziyu was about to attack, Lu Chengfeng didn’t dare to dodge, seemingly very afraid of her.

“That’s enough,” said Long Chen. In truth, he and Mo Nian knew that she simply raised her hand and didn’t really intend to strike him. This was just for them to see.

Lu Ziyu sighed with relief. After all, Lu Chengfeng was an excellent figure amongst the Lu family’s young heavenly geniuses. She couldn’t simply strike him in front of outsiders even if her sister was Lu Ziqiong.

Hence, when Long Chen gave her a chance to step down, she immediately took it. She said, “Shouldn’t you thank Long Chen? Don’t ever think that you are so amazing. They are in possession of a Golden Devil Fall Tablet, you know? What qualifications do you have to look down on them?”

Hearing that, those five disciples were all shocked. As expected, most of them instantly became respectful.

However, Lu Chengfeng stubbornly refused to apologize. Even if the other side possessed a Golden Devil Fall Tablet, he couldn’t bring himself to lower his head. All of a sudden, he said, “What’s so amazing about that? The family head has said that when I reach the late Divine Venerate realm, I will also have the power to get a Golden Devil Fall Tablet.”

While he refused to submit, his tone was no longer as contemptuous as before. Perhaps this was the final stubbornness of a genius.

“You...!” Lu Ziyu glared at him.

“That’s enough. This matter is settled.” Long Chen finally lost his patience. “Miss Lu Ziqiong invited us to watch her battle. We will remember this favor and repay it in the future. All of you have no obligation to treat us warmly, but I hope you won’t say anything so disgusting again. My temper isn’t very good, and I really don’t want things to reach the point of no return. That would be too regretful.”

Long Chen’s gaze swept over Lu Chengfeng and the others, causing their hair to instantly stand on end. It was as if a desolate beast from hell had set its sights on them. The intense feeling of death made them feel like they had been encased by an iceberg.

“Everyone, please sit. It’s going to start soon,” said Lu Ziyu hastily.

Only then did everyone sit at the front seats. There were millions of seats here, but right now, they were still empty.

When Long Chen and the others sat down, another group of ten people appeared on the opposite side. One of them suddenly stood and made a throat-cutting gesture toward Lu Ziyu and the others.

Lu Ziyu and the others seethed with anger, but before they could react, that person suddenly smiled sinisterly at Long Chen.

Seeing him provoke Long Chen, Mo Nian helplessly shrugged and sighed with sympathy.

“This fellow really wants to die in a flashy way.”
