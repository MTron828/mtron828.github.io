Chapter 4816 Joining Forces to Slay a Heaven Saint

“Boss, this is just to scare them! I cannot activate the barrier!” Just as Long Chen was about to charge out, Xia Chen urgently transmitted a piece of critical information to him.

“What?!”

“I just found the energy source. However, when I tried to draw out its power, I couldn’t activate it,” replied Xia Chen, sweating.

While both sides were staring at each other, he managed to find the energy source. However, the barrier wasn’t something he could activate. This light screen was nothing more than an energy field the barrier instinctively expulsed. Long Chen and those Heaven Saints had both misunderstood.

However, the Dragonblood warriors’ fighting spirits were already blazing, while those Heaven Saints did not know the truth about the screen of light and were already starting to run. Long Chen could only keep up the act.

Damn! Well, the atmosphere is already set. We have to attack.

“Grab that fellow with a broken arm! Today, no matter what, we’re going to kill a Heaven Saint!” Long Chen quickly responded.

The arrow had left the string; they could not stop now. If they were to stop, the other side would realize that something was wrong, and then they would be the ones in trouble.

“Heavenly Rainbow Heaven Earth Dance!”

Yu Qingxuan unleashed the technique she had been preparing. After that, rainbow flames rose in the sky, forming a pair of Yin Yang fish. As those two fish revolved, they formed flames that blocked the path of the Heaven Saint with the broken arm.

“Fuck off!” That Heaven Saint roared and raised his remaining hand. A giant hatchet then appeared in his hand, and he smashed it down.

BOOM!

The hatchet smashed into the Yin Yang shield. While the shield didn’t break, a large cut was left in it.

“Nice!” Seeing that, Long Chen almost ran over and kissed Yu Qingxuan. She was truly smart. That shield looked like a shield, but it was actually a formation.

The countless flame chains surrounding it appeared to be gathering energy from the surroundings, but in reality, they were doing the opposite. The power endured by the shield was dispersed through these flame chains, preventing the attack from breaking through. The shield's durability played a part, but equally crucial was Yu Qingxuan's mastery over her flame energy and her skill in dispersing the opponent's power. Even the Heaven Saint observing this was stunned by her abilities.

“His realm is suppressed! Kill them all!” shouted Long Chen quickly.

The other Heaven Saints were sure that their realms had been stripped away when they saw this scene. Otherwise, how could a Heaven Saint not be able to break the defense of a Divine Venerate?

At first, they had been hesitating over whether or not they should help the one-armed Heaven Saint, but this shout from Long Chen instantly made them flee for their lives.

“Ten Thousand Talismans Devour the Heavens!”

Xia Chen shouted, and ten thousand talismans gathered from every direction, surrounding the remaining Heaven Saints.

“Explode!”

BOOM!

These talismans were Xia Chen’s trump card, the Heaven Shaking Talisman. Normally, using just one of them would cause him pain due to their immense power and the difficulty of inscribing them.

However, he decided to employ them all at this moment. After all, the laws of this place were affecting the Heaven Shaking Talismans, causing their power to drop gradually. So, he had to use them, or they would soon be rendered useless.

Since that was the case, Xia Chen naturally wanted to use them in the flashiest way possible. As a result, ten thousand Heaven Shaking Talismans exploded at once, creating what could be considered the most spectacular moment of his life.

Blood erupted as the Heaven Saint was reduced to a bloody, charred pulp, resembling someone who had been skinned and roasted alive. The stench of charred flesh drifted through the air.

Xia Chen’s move was truly terrifying. The Heaven Saint's aura plummeted, and terror filled his eyes. Ignoring everything else, he turned and fled.

In his panicked state, the Heaven Saint completely lost his fighting spirit. He believed that his cultivation base had been suppressed and was unable to comprehend that Divine Venerates could possess such terrifying power.

“Boss!”

Just then, Bai Xiaole cried out. A pair of giant violet eyes lit up behind him, and nine tails shrouded the heavens. Bai Xiaole and the Violet Pupil Nine Tail Fox formed hand seals at the same time.

As the Heaven Saint attempted to flee, a translucent whirlpool emerged in his path. With a furious roar, he swung his hatchet at it.

However, in the blink of an eye, the Heaven Saint found himself face-to-face with Long Chen. Evilmoon's sharp blade pierced through his head, sealing his fate.

That Heaven Saint instantly went stiff, with an expression of disbelief locked on his face. Even in death, he couldn’t comprehend what had happened.

In truth, his death was truly unjust. If he had relied on his real power, the Dragonblood Legion would have been unable to stop him. Even with all his injuries, in a frontal clash, no one could have blocked him. After all, everyone had exhausted themselves, including Long Chen. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

The Heaven Saint was already terrified by the barrier of light, and when his initial attack failed to break Yu Qingxuan's shield, his fear deepened. The detonation of ten thousand talismans stripped away any of his remaining will to fight. Upon seeing Bai Xiaole’s technique, the Heaven Saint mistook it for a shield, but it turned out to be a transportation vortex. Without needing a reminder, Long Chen made his preparations.

“Why...”

The Heaven Saint’s eyes grew dim. As the flame of his soul was extinguished, his corpse withered. All his energy was absorbed by Evilmoon.

Evilmoon laughed, “That was satisfying! Heaven Saints really are great nourishment!”

Evilmoon had not only absorbed the Heaven Saint’s power but also his hatchet. A Heaven Saint divine weapon turned into trash just like that.

Everyone’s morale was high after killing a Heaven Saint. Not knowing that the screen of light was fake, Bai Xiaole shouted at the fleeing Heaven Saints. “If you have guts, come back and fight a few more rounds!”

Only Long Chen and Xia Chen shivered inside. If they really came back, they would be the ones doomed.

Fortunately, Heaven Saints truly did flee quickly, vanishing in an instant. Seeing this scene, Long Chen sighed with relief.

Just then, the void quivered, and a bloody head flew into the sky.
