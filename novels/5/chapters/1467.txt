Chapter 1462 Preparing For Another Battle

Translator: BornToBe

The technique that Long Chen used to inject item-spirits came from his Pill Sovereign memories, and it was normally used to impart spirituality to medicinal pills. Not only did it require great Spiritual Strength, but it also required the slightest bit of Pill Flame to help with the process.

Otherwise, this work could easily be left to a spiritual expert like Meng Qi. Regretfully, Meng Qi was not an alchemist, so Long Chen could only do it himself.

After five days, Long Chen’s head felt like it was splitting. Thus, when he fell asleep, it was a deep slumber. When he awoke, he realized he was sleeping on a soft bed, and the sunlight shining down on his face was very warm.

The sound of babbling water could be heard, along with some tinkling laughter. He slowly rose and put on his shoes. He realized he was wearing a fresh set of robes that emitted a very familiar scent. When he carefully examined it, he could distinguish three different people’s scents.

“Ah, they couldn’t have held me while sleeping the whole night, right? Fuck, I slept like a log while accompanied by three beauties? I didn’t even get a single touch... it’s... it’s... worse than a beast!”

Long Chen was full of regret. Getting up, he walked out of a tent and saw a small pool with a tiny waterfall slowly pouring into it.

The pool was surrounded by a dense forest. The trees had formed a wooden wall that others couldn’t see through. It was clear that such an orderly arrangement had to be Chu Yao’s handiwork.

“Could it be...”

Long Chen’s heart skipped a beat. He crept forward, completely suppressing his aura.

Stealthily creeping up a tree, he saw three beautiful women playing in the water. Their fair skin was dotted in droplets of water.

Most heart-stopping was that they weren’t wearing any clothes. Their perfect curves were completely revealed to Long Chen with only the crystalline drops of water to obscure his view. In all his years, Long Chen had never seen such an alluring sight.

Drip.

Suddenly, something dripped onto a green leaf. Long Chen’s expression immediately changed, and his heart dropped. That leaf belonged to one of the trees Chu Yao had created.

“Ah! Someone’s peeping!”

Chu Yao let out a sharp cry. Meng Qi and Tang Wan-er also let out startled cries and dived into the water.

BOOM!

The water exploded, and Long Chen was blinded. When his vision cleared, Meng Qi, Chu Yao, and Tang Wan-er were all right in front of him. Regretfully, they were already wearing clothes.

“It’s not peeping! We’re all one family, and as your husband, I have to get used to helping you bathe, change clothes, massage your backs... It’s nothing bad! I held a pure heart when I came to appreciate... yes, appreciate, not peep...”

In front of Meng Qi, Chu Yao, and Tang Wan-er’s death stares, Long Chen couldn’t possibly admit to peeping. First, he gave himself a noble reason for his actions.

“Wipe away your nosebleed before speaking,” said Tang Wan-er disdainfully.

“Ah?”

Only now did Long Chen realize that his nose felt odd. A hot liquid was pouring out, and he reached out to wipe it with his hand.

Now he was doomed. He had actually gotten a nosebleed without realizing it. In order to fully mask his presence just now, he had observed them like a mortal, and as a result, he ended up reacting like a mortal.

“A pure heart for appreciation. Yes, appreciation, not peeping?” Chu Yao’s lips curled into a smile when she repeated Long Chen’s sanctimonious words.

Long Chen had an urge to find a hole to bury himself in. This was too embarrassing. Even with his thick face, he felt a burning sensation.

“Are you planning on staying up in a tree your whole life? Come down.” In the end, it was Meng Qi who treated him the best. She gave him a way out of this embarrassing situation. Once Long Chen jumped off the tree, Meng Qi even handed him a handkerchief to wipe away his blood.

Long Chen was so moved that he wanted to cry. Meng Qi was truly the best.

“I really didn’t see too much. Your clothes... you put them on too quickly...” Long Chen looked over the three of them. Their clothes had been soaked in some droplets of water, which revealed their curves. However, those crucial areas were blocked off now.

“Scoundrel, don’t speak!”

Meng Qi, Chu Yao, and Tang Wan-er blushed. But at least Long Chen had returned to normal. They didn’t have to worry about that at least.

“Ah, have the Ancestral items been distributed? Everyone can increase their cultivation base while nourishing their Ancestral items with their souls. They shouldn’t interfere with each other.” Long Chen changed the subject.

“We handed them out yesterday. All of them are excited, especially Guo Ran. He kissed his armor over and over again. It was embarrassing to see,” said Tang Wan-er somewhat speechlessly.

Long Chen smiled. He knew Guo Ran viewed his personal armor like his own child. His excitement was only natural, but he would quickly feel the pain.

“Long Chen, we’re also going into seclusion. But what about you?” asked Meng Qi. They also had to increase their cultivation bases. Each level they advanced would increase their power, which would be what protected their lives.

The reason they had waited until now was because they had been too worried for Long Chen. They were worried about a problem occurring in his heart. But now, they felt like Long Chen had walked out from that shadow, so they were preparing to enter seclusion as well.

“I don’t need to go into seclusion. I still have many things to handle. My cultivation is different from yours, so don’t worry about me,” said Long Chen.

Only then did Meng Qi, Chu Yao, and Tang Wan-er leave. They returned to the Life God Tree. Since the Life God Tree provided them with the best possible cultivation environment, their cultivation bases would advance rapidly.

“Tch, are those garbage weapons and armor useful? If you worked with me and undid the Sovereign’s seal, I’d help you annihilate all your enemies. You’re just like a turtle hiding in its shell. How long are you planning on hiding here? Are you even a man?” Once the three of them left, Evilmoon’s voice rang out in Long Chen’s mind.

The garbage weapons and armor it was referring to were actually the Ancestral items that Guo Ran had forged.

“Aren’t you also trash? If you aren’t, how come you weren’t even able to kill a tree? When will you fix your habit of only knowing how to brag?” sneered Long Chen.

“Bullshit, the reason you couldn’t kill that willow is because you’re trash. With your little bit of spiritual yuan, what do you think you could accomplish? You want to be able to use my power with such a pitiful amount? Keep dreaming. And don’t think I’ll lend you the slightest bit of my own power,” sneered back Evilmoon.

“If you really were useful, your body should have enough power to break a single willow. But in reality, other than being stupidly heavy, you're not the slightest bit useful. Try not to natter so much in the future,” snorted Long Chen.

“Hmph, I won’t argue with a brat. In any case, if you refuse to help me undo the Sovereign’s seal, don’t even think about me lending you the slightest bit of energy. And don’t threaten me. I’d rather die than submit to a weakling,” said Evilmoon.

“What is a weakling?”

“People like you. People who hesitate and spend all day planning cautiously for no reason. If you have anger in your heart, if you have killing intent, then release it. Kill all the people you hate and want to kill,” said Evilmoon. When it spoke, Long Chen clearly sensed its killing intent spreading toward him.

After a moment of silence, Long Chen nodded. “Perhaps you’re right.”

He didn’t refute it, nor did he insult it. That caught Evilmoon off-guard. It didn’t know what to say.

“If they’re enemies, they should be killed with my full power. I shouldn’t give them any chance to harm me. I shouldn’t passively wait until they come to kill me. Perhaps that’s the right path,” sighed Long Chen.

“So even you know how to talk like a human. I’m amazed,” said Evilmoon.

“You’re a brute. Can you even understand human words?” demanded Long Chen coldly.

“Who are you calling a brute?!”

“Your dark evil dragon race is a branch and the descendants of the true dragon race. The true dragon is a grand and noble existence. How did they end up with such useless descendants?” sneered Long Chen.

“What do you think you’re doing?” In the primal chaos space, Dragonbone Evilmoon began to quiver violently, waves of killing intent exploding out of it.

“Your little bit of killing intent can only frighten children. In my Dragonblood Legion, everyone is a hot-blooded man, and you aren’t capable of frightening any one of them. Did you see anyone in the Dragonblood Legion afraid of dying? The reason I look down on you is that despite having the blood of the true dragon race, you are still relying on slaughtering the weak for your vanity and self-esteem. Don’t you feel that you’re garbage?”

“I dared to challenge a Sovereign! You dare to call me someone who slaughters the weak?!” roared Evilmoon.

“Tch, the only reason you dared to challenge a Sovereign was because your ego was inflated from killing so many weaklings. Dragonbone Evilmoon, let me ask you this: if you had another chance to challenge a Sovereign, would you do it?” demanded Long Chen.

“...”

“So, you don’t have the qualifications to look down on me. From the moment I stepped into the cultivation world, my enemies were always formidable heavenly geniuses. I advanced on my path by walking over their corpses. My path is different from yours. Although I’m from the human race, I’ve refined true dragon essence blood, so I understand the pride and essence of the true dragon race better than you. I don’t need to make transactions with you, nor do I need to submit to you. That’s because you aren’t worthy. Even if I were to die on the battlefield, I wouldn’t ask for your help. So in the future, put away your arrogance and scheming. To tell the truth, I really don’t know why Sovereign Yun Shang left you to me. If it weren’t for him, I’d have a hundred different ways of playing you to death. You should be thanking him for the fact that you’re able to keep living peacefully. If you think I’m just bragging, then you can come try me. Let’s see whether my methods are more vicious than the hardness of your bones.”

Long Chen smiled sinisterly as he looked at Dragonbone Evilmoon in the primal chaos space. Being stared at like this, Evilmoon involuntarily shivered. In the end, it didn’t reply. In that instant, a terrifying divine might appeared in the primal chaos space, making it so it didn’t dare to do anything.

Long Chen ignored it. After parting with Meng Qi, Chu Yao, and Tang Wan-er, he went to find the Spirit Emperor.

“Spirit Emperor, gather your people. We go to attack the Dark Forest and pull them up by their roots.”
