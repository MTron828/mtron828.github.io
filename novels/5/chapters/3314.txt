Chapter 3303 Flocking Toward One Place

The Heavenly Rainbow Flame was ranked ninth on the Heavenly Flame Rankings. It possessed a divine radiance containing all the colors of the rainbow and was capable of melting all things.

Legend had it that starting eighty million years ago, the Heavenly Rainbow Domain started giving birth to the Heavenly Rainbow Flame, causing the domain’s name to change to the Heavenly Rainbow Domain.

There were records that the Heavenly Rainbow Flame had appeared seven times in total throughout history. If it truly came out this time, then it would mean that the flame came out perfectly once every ten million years.

It was different from the other flames on the Heavenly Flame Rankings. All the top nine Heavenly Flames were born of heaven and earth. They were spiritual entities containing the karmic luck of thousands.

When they were born, they would find their own masters. If they couldn’t find someone that had a destiny with them, they would simply cultivate on their own.

The Heavenly Rainbow Domain had once produced a terrifying genius known as the Heavenly Rainbow Fairy. Legend had it that she was an existence resulting from a Heavenly Rainbow Flame cultivating on its own and maturing. She was born in the Heavenly Rainbow Domain, lived in the Heavenly Rainbow Domain, and spent a lifetime protecting the Heavenly Rainbow Domain.

When the immortal world faced a terrifying battle, the Heavenly Rainbow Fairy died to protect the Heavenly Rainbow Domain.

To express their gratitude for her sacrifice, the people built a statue of her. All people within the Heavenly Rainbow Domain, whether good or bad, had to prostrate themselves in worship toward this statue.Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

The place where the Heavenly Rainbow Fairy’s statue was located was a restricted zone. Anyone who showed the slightest disrespect to her in that zone would be hunted down by the entire Heavenly Rainbow Domain.

Just yesterday, the Heavenly Rainbow Fairy’s statue lit up. According to the ancient records, that was the premonition for the birth of a new Heavenly Rainbow Flame.

Some believed that every time a Heavenly Rainbow Flame appeared, it was the reincarnation of the Heavenly Rainbow Fairy. Thus, all of the Heavenly Rainbow Domain became exceptionally lively.

It was said that the Heavenly Rainbow Flame would choose a master not based on their power but someone with limitless potential who possessed a righteous heart. It would pick a kind youngster to accompany through life.

In the past, the Heavenly Rainbow Flame always chose a Four Peak disciple. All those who were chosen became overlords in the future, figures that shook their era.

All Four Peak geniuses had a chance of becoming the master of the Heavenly Rainbow Flame. Thus, there were countless Four Peak geniuses rushing over to the Heavenly Rainbow Domain when they heard the news.

Long Chen was also moved. This was something that would allow him to soar in an instant if he could obtain it.

By the time Long Chen and the others set off, there were already countless beautiful flying boats shooting past them in an all-out race toward the Heavenly Rainbow Domain. Some people were even carried by terrifying devil beasts. Some went so far as to piss in front of Long Chen and the others’ flying boats, infuriating Bai Xiaole. This was a clear provocation.

“Rat bastards, if my devil dragon steed hadn’t been killed, I’d make sure it ate yours. If I didn’t make you piss your pants, I wouldn’t be surnamed Bai,” cursed Bai Xiaole.

He had gained control over a devil dragon. He was originally very happy to have such a flashy mount. But then it was killed by the Devil Eye Water Lily, aggrieving him.

Now that these fellows were showing off their Immortal King devil beast mounts flashily, his teeth hurt from how hard he clenched them.

These mounts were all artificially raised, so they had long since lost their devil nature. Other than for scaring others, they didn’t really have much combat power. If the devil dragon was here, these beasts wouldn’t even dare to move. They would obediently let themselves be consumed.

One flying boat after another streaked through the air. Long Chen’s flying boat was like a slow ox in comparison.

Seeing Bai Xiaole looking at her, Bai Shishi said, “Don’t look at me. My flying boats were bought from the academy with my own money. Also, the golden war chariot cannot be used outside the Heavenly Swell Domain. It’s not like you don’t know the academy’s stinginess. Furthermore, isn’t a certain someone the dean of the High Firmament Academy? Why doesn’t he have his own special flying boat?”

Bai Shishi turned to Long Chen. He was speechless. Why did this problem have to be his to handle? The academy belonged to their Bai family. They refused to give anything to him for free, so how could they ask him?

“Low-key, low-key. A person must be low-key.” Long Chen could only spit out such an excuse. The main thing was that even if he wanted to be high-key, his financial power didn’t allow it.

The flying boats that those people were using were the best flying boats of their sects. Some were specifically made to give face to their sect masters, so there really was no comparison.

These disciples all had powerful experts accompanying them. To put it frankly, ignoring whether or not they would obtain the Heavenly Rainbow Flame, they had to uphold the face of the sect. By coming out, they were representing their sect. Without a certain level of power, then they at least had to act like they had some power.

“Boss, will people think we are easy to bully and try to pick a fight with us?” asked Xu Zixiong.

“I wish.” Long Chen shrugged. It would be best if someone tried to rob them. That was equivalent to sending them gifts. He naturally wouldn’t reject that.

“It’s wishful thinking. Our flying boat is so bad that they aren’t even interested in robbing us.” Qin Feng bitterly smiled.

Bai Shishi’s flying boat was the most ordinary flying boat sold within the academy. Its appearance was only average from the start, but after experiencing this journey, it was badly damaged. It had even been carried in the mouth of black dragons. Even without biting down, just the saliva of the black dragon was very corrosive. Hence, the flying boat was covered in rust and stains. 

If they came out in such a flying boat, which fool would want to rob them? They were probably afraid that whoever was inside was a poor ghost and would take a bite out of them. Thus, while there were some insulting movements toward them, no one tried to stop them. The so-called ‘barefoot people were unafraid of people wearing shoes’ principle was shown quite clearly here.

“Xiaole, don’t feel bad. Don’t you have dragon eggs? We’ve entrusted them to the Huayun Trading Company to send to the academy. The academy will definitely arrange for specialized people to incubate them. Once they hatch, a Beast Tamer will help you raise them. As long as you have enough money, they can grow very quickly,” comforted Long Chen. However, Bai Xiaole was still staring angrily as other people’s glorious flying boats and steeds passed them.

“But it’s such a huge scene here. Without something to show off, I still feel unhappy,” said Bai Xiaole.

Long Chen shook his head. This fellow really was the same kind of showoff as Guo Ran. What was different was that Bai Xiaole was often beaten by his father, to the point of feeling inferior. He needed to show off his own brilliance and enjoy other people’s gazes on him, using their shock and admiration to find his own sense of confidence.

If Bai Xiaole were to encounter Guo Ran, the two would definitely be like bees that had found nectar. They would instantly become good brothers.

After flying through multiple transportation formations separated by regions, they reached the Heavenly Rainbow Domain.

And as soon as they entered this domain, Long Chen clearly felt that the flame laws of this domain were much stronger than other domains. He suddenly had a thought. If he were to unleash the World Extermination Flame Lotus here, just what kind of terrifying effect would it have?

“Stop right there!”

Just as they entered the Heavenly Rainbow Domain, a group of rogues stopped them.

“We’ve encountered the toll collectors.” Long Chen smiled disdainfully.
