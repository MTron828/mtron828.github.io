Chapter 3404 Shameless Move

Experts from other star-fields had to take a test to evaluate their power. The Sacred Pill Hall had their own measuring tool to test a person’s talent, bloodline, potential, etc.

Based on this, the Sacred Pill Hall would decide how much these experts had to pay to enter the Divine Lord Immortal Realm. The stronger the person, the greater the price.

If those outsiders didn’t take the test, they wouldn’t be allowed to enter the Divine Lord Immortal Realm.

The tablet that Long Chen had received when he entered the city only gave him entry to the city, not the Divine Lord Immortal Realm. If he wanted to go in there, he needed to bring the tablet to the testing area.

The testing had started, so Lei Yuner immediately paid the bill and brought Long Chen to the testing area. Many foreign experts had come here. If they didn’t get in line fast, it would take a long time.

They were still early, so if they rushed there, they might get it done quickly. But when they arrived, they were dumbfounded.

The testing had just started, but there was already a giant line of people. Ying Bokong suddenly saw a familiar figure and furiously shouted, “You aren’t even an outsider! What are you doing lining up here?!”

This person belonged to a power opposing the Falling Star Gate. The two of them had even had some interactions, so Ying Bokong instantly recognized him.

That person glanced at Ying Bokong disdainfully. “Is that any of your business? I’m lined up for someone else. Speaking of which, I heard that you’ve become a battle pet for the human race. Hehe, congratulations. I’m sure your race is honored by your actions, haha!”

Ying Bokong wanted to tear this person apart. But he then sneered, “A frog at the bottom of a well. Do you know who my master is? Hopefully, you don’t kneel and beg me to accept you as well.”

“Beg you? Hahaha-!”

That person was just about to retort with a few lines when he spotted Long Chen, as well as Lei Yuner. When he saw Lei Yuner, his expression instantly changed and he swallowed his words.

“Who had you come here?” demanded Lei Yuner.

That person instantly knelt on the ground, his previous arrogance vanishing without a trace. He was like an entirely different person. “Princess, I… We were ordered by the eighth prince to line up! Don’t blame us!”

Long Chen sneered. This eighth prince of the Mammoth Divine Elephant race really wasn’t a good person. Knowing that Long Chen had to come here, he had actually made such a move just to irritate him. It was a bit shameless and truly hateful.

“Scram!” raged Lei Yuner.

That person immediately kowtowed. “Princess, we can’t offend you, but we also can’t offend the Mammoth Divine Elephant race. Please give this little one a chance to live.”

These people had been ordered by the eighth prince to line up here, just to irritate Long Chen. If they were to simply leave, it would be offending the Mammoth Divine Elephant race. Furthermore, the eighth prince definitely knew that Lei Yuner would use the status of the Lightning Falcon race to threaten them, so he must have used his own methods to scare these people so that they wouldn’t retreat. Now, they were caught between a rock and a hard place.

Lei Yuner turned ashen with rage. “You’re afraid of the Mammoth Divine Elephant race but not my Lightning Falcon race? Alright then! All of you have been remembered by me! Once we enter the Divine Lord Immortal Realm, if any one of you can leave alive, it will count as my defeat!”

Lei Yuner’s fury soared. This was no longer just a matter of Long Chen but a competition between the Mammoth Divine Elephant race and the Lightning Falcon race. If she conceded this matter, it would be like conceding to the Mammoth Divine Elephant race.

Most importantly, like this, it would be as if people were afraid of the Mammoth Divine Elephant race, but not afraid of the Lightning Falcon race.

It was a play done often in the human race as well. If one side was good and the other side was bad, people would rather offend the good side, because at least the good side wouldn’t kill them in retaliation. It was the bad people that terrified them.

These people were sticking to the side of the Mammoth Divine Elephant race not because they felt that this race was stronger than the Lightning Falcon race, but because they felt that the Lightning Falcon race was comparatively a bit kinder and wouldn’t cast their anger out on them.

Lei Yuner wasn’t that experienced, but she saw through this clearly, so she refused to concede. If the eighth prince was going to be that ruthless, then she would be even more ruthless.

All this time, Long Chen didn’t say a word. He had seen such a thing often. The eighth prince thought himself to be smart. However, the more he did this, the less chance of there being any union between him and Lei Yuner. He might even push away the entire Lightning Falcon race, turning them into enemies.

As lightning runes flashed in Lei Yuner’s eyes, those experts instantly became terrified. Lei Yuner was about to mark them so that she could settle things with them in the immortal realm.

“Princess, spare us! We’ll leave right this instant!”

Seeing the terrifying Lei Yuner, people finally left the line in droves.

They had lined up and persevered. The Mammoth Divine Elephant race’s eighth prince couldn’t possibly blame them for leaving now that Lei Yuner was infuriated.

However, even with these people leaving, there was still a long line. Those people were actual experts from outside this star-field. The eighth prince had ordered people to spread the word for those foreign experts to directly come line up. His subordinates even told them that if they didn’t start lining up now, it would be too late.

Those experts were unaware that they would be alerted when the power tests started. Thus, they ended up being tricked into lining up here without exploring the city at all.

They learned the truth after lining up, but seeing so many people in line, they chose to simply stay.

“That idiot! Even such a shameless idiot dares to want to have children with me? Is his head full of shit?!” Lei Yuner cursed furiously when she saw the long line. She had been schemed against by the eighth prince. It was as irritating as if she had just eaten a fly.

“Don’t be mad,” said Long Chen.

“If you have children with me, I won’t be mad,” said Lei Yuner directly.

Long Chen speechlessly rolled his eyes. If this was amongst the human race, a girl saying such a thing in front of everyone would definitely be cursed to death. The difference was truly immense.

“Master, princess, you should go rest. I’ll stay in line for you. When it’s almost your turn, I’ll tell you,” proposed Ying Bokong.Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

Long Chen shook his head. There was no need for that. The thing that he was a bit afraid of was being alone with Lei Yuner. This woman was focused entirely on having children with him, so he found it hard to deal with her.

At this moment, the stone gate in the testing area quivered and startled cries suddenly rang out. Long Chen looked over to see a rather ugly-looking man standing proudly before the gate.

“It’s green divine light!”
