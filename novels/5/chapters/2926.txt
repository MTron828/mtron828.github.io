Chapter 2915 I’ll Be a Butcher Today

“Chu Kuang has activated his bloodline divine ability.”

Luo Bing watched the battle unfold gravely. Chu Kuang’s Blood Qi was erupting, and everything within three hundred meters of him was inundated with his bloodline runes.

Last time, he had activated his bloodline power in the lava cave. But this time, its aura was ten times greater.

Luo Bing guessed that it was partially due to Chu Kuang holding back last time, while the other reason was due to the Five Element Spirit Gathering Armor, which was a special bloodline Spirit item. It was connected to his bloodline power, and the resonance between them caused such a phenomenon.

The current Chu Kuang was so powerful that even Divine Flame disciples felt suffocated. This aura was coming through the formation, but it was still so terrifying.

“Long Chen, didn’t you want to see my true power? Then I’ll show it to you today.” Chu Kuang’s voice was dripping with bloody killing intent. Clearly, he was completely enraged by Long Chen’s previous attacks. “Try and receive my saber!”

Chu Kuang roared, his hair flying back. At this moment, his saber and the Five Element Spirit Gathering Armor lit up with runes. A flood of light then poured into his saber, and a giant saber-image tore toward Long Chen.

BOOM!

Wherever the saber-image went, the ground was torn apart. The location that Long Chen had been was now a giant ditch where dust and rubble billowed in every direction.

The experts watching were dumbfounded by this attack. Luo Bing covered her mouth, filled with disbelief.

The Luo and Chu families were old enemies, so she was very familiar with the Chu family’s techniques. However, she had not expected Chu Kuang to be so powerful.

Originally, with her bloodline activated, she had thought that she could match Chu Kuang. At the very least, she should have the ability to fight him without being instantly crushed.

However, this attack was absolutely terrifying. Let alone her, even her big sister Luo Bing couldn’t receive such a blow.

“Where is Long Chen?!”

Within the billowing dust, no one could see Long Chen’s figure.

“Was he killed? He couldn’t even dodge?”

“Such a terrifying move probably contains a locking power. It’s not so easy to dodge…”

They were unable to spot Long Chen even after a while of searching, so quite a few people began to sigh.

On the other hand, Chu Huairen and the other magistrate smiled disdainfully. It was as if everything was within their expectations.

However, those smiles quickly vanished. When the dust settled, they saw a figure slowly appear.

“What?!”

When their line of sight cleared, they finally saw a black figure with a spear on his shoulder. His clothes and hair slowly fluttered in a light breeze.

Most shocking of all was the three-hundred-meter ring of light behind Long Chen. They could see the energy of heaven and earth converging into that ring.

It was a seven-colored divine ring, but the colors were vague and moving within the ring. Some colors would float up for a while and then fade back in. At this moment, the space around Long Chen was twisting and fluctuating.

“What kind of cultivation technique is that?!”

“It’s the Seven Supreme Yang Technique! It was the consummate technique of the Seven Supreme Sect back in the ancient era. It’s an extremely powerful cultivation technique, but its inheritance was severed countless years ago! Even our academy only has a fraction of the full technique, furthermore, the most important part of how to transfer and transform the metal, wood, water, fire, earth, wind, and lightning energies has been lost. No one can train in it. How can Long Chen possess such a technique?!”

Even Heaven Master Yun Yang was shocked. He was familiar with the God Institute’s cultivation techniques and skills. Since he had skimmed through all the texts in every area, he recognized this technique.

“Did Long Chen use his own intelligence and imagination to replace the missing portion?” wondered one of the God Institute’s Earth-ranked instructors.

He had seen this technique in a damaged scroll decades ago. He had felt it to be incredibly profound, but the important part was missing, so it couldn’t be cultivated. Moreover, he had actually spent a few years researching and testing it but had failed to fix the missing part.

Ignoring the time wasted, he had almost become bedeviled. At that last moment, he was so frightened that he directly gave up on this technique. Now seeing Long Chen summon the seven-color divine ring, he thought of his own efforts.

Heaven Master Yun Yang shook his head. “It’s impossible. That Seven Supreme Yang Technique is too profound, and it’s from the ancient era. The cultivation style is different from the current era. Only a grandmaster who cultivates an ancient cultivation technique could possibly repair such a technique. With Long Chen’s age, no matter how intelligent he is, it’s impossible. He might already possess the complete Seven Supreme Yang Technique before this. Although its complete form has been lost in the immortal world, maybe a complete copy still exists in the myriad worlds of the lower plane.”

Heaven Master Yun Yang tried to make an educated guess based on his experience, and it made others nod. It sounded plausible.

After all, it was unknown just how many brilliant sages had tried to repair the Seven Supreme Yang Technique in the academy, but they all failed. If Long Chen was capable of it, that would simply be a fantasy story. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

Just as everyone was guessing, the dust around Long Chen settled. The three-hundred-meter area around him was still untouched, so he was standing on a circular island in the middle of a giant ditch.

Chu Kuang’s attack had ravaged the land, and only the area beneath Long Chen’s feet remained unscathed. It was a shocking sight.

When the dust settled, the cold wind also slowly faded. As a result, Long Chen’s black robes and hair stopped fluttering, and the world returned to calm.

Chu Kuang looked at Long Chen with overflowing killing intent. Long Chen looked at Chu Kuang as well. He slowly smiled. “This is your so-called power? You’re still thinking of holding back now? I cannot imagine just how foolish you are. It seems that your usual opponents are all too weak, causing you to get into a habit of acting like a pig to eat the tiger. Fine, since you want to be a pig, I’ll be a butcher today.”

As Long Chen made his move, his divine ring shuddered. The world suddenly dimmed, as if all its energy was instantly sucked away. At this moment, the island around Long Chen crumbled, and he vanished, charging at Chu Kuang like a bolt of lightning.

“Wild Lightning Soul Battle Spear!”

A layer of lightning enveloped Long Chen’s spear as it pierced toward Chu Kuang.
