Chapter 2638 Restoring the Divine Tablet

Bao Buping and the others’ cultivation bases hadn’t changed. Instead, their auras were growing sharper and fiercer, as if a beast was awakening. Upon looking at them, even Long Chen’s heart shook.

“This… it can't be!” Long Chen suddenly thought of something and was filled with envy. This was a pleasant surprise.

“Hahaha, the Heavens’ Wrath rune! I no longer need to worry about not being able to control it! Fuck, who doesn’t submit to me now? I’ll directly slash them to death!” Bao Buping suddenly laughed crazily and jumped excitedly.

The Heaven Splitting Divine Tablet had returned, and its primordial runes had been restored. Because of it, all disciples of the Heaven Splitting Battle Sect automatically awakened the Heavens’ Wrath rune, which allowed them to enter the Heavens’ Wrath state much easier.

Furthermore, once they were in that state, this rune would help block the majority of the backlash from the Heavenly Daos. Even if they didn’t balance their energy perfectly, the hidden wounds would be prevented, so they could freely unleash their full potential.

Before this, without the protection of the Heaven Splitting Divine Tablet, they had to use their own power to block that backlash, so the majority of their power had to be focused on defending themselves against it. Now, they could be unrestrained.

After seeing this, Long Chen understood why it felt like their auras had suddenly grown. It was his senses telling him that their killing power had explosively grown.

“Amazing.”

Long Chen was also emotional. The Heaven Splitting Divine Tablet had returned, and every disciple of the sect had suddenly grown stronger. Although they might not be able to beat the Dragonblood warriors, they were definitely the strongest squad below the Dragonblood warriors. Even Feng Fei, Long Aotian, and the others’ guards would have to stand aside.

Regretfully, Long Chen didn’t cultivate the Battle God Sacred Canon, so the return of the Heaven Splitting Divine Tablet didn’t change anything for him. He could only envy them.

The disciples cheered, not even knowing how to express their current emotions. They were originally unqualified to even train in the ninth form of Split the Heavens, but the return of the divine tablet had changed that. Now, every person in the sect could train in it.

As the disciples cheered, the experts of the senior generation wept. Consecutive generations had died unwillingly, unable to see the return of the Heaven Splitting Divine Tablet. They had passed away filled with regret.

However, the divine tablet had returned in their generation, so those old fellows were filled with joy. Thinking of the hopes of their ancestors, they couldn’t hold back their tears.

“Long child, well done. Well done.”

The three ancestors were extremely moved. Even their voices were choked up. They had never thought that such a day would come in their lifetime. Their dream had become a reality thanks to Long Chen.

The old man wiped away his own tears. “Child, we must repair the soul of the Heaven Splitting Divine Tablet, and this requires all our faith energy to resonate with it. It will take at least ten days before it fully recovers. But since your cultivation technique is different, you can’t help here. On the other hand, the battlefield needs you, you should go back. When the divine tablet is fully recovered, the Heaven Splitting Divine Sect will be your firmest backer. We will create rivers of blood and once more show the glory of the world’s number one sect.”

The old man had brought Long Chen here so that everyone would know that Long Chen was the one who had brought back the Heaven Splitting Divine Tablet. This was something that he had to be part of. But now that it was over, he could leave because they would need to focus all their power on helping the divine tablet recover. Once it did, the Heaven Splitting Divine Sect would once more dominate this world.

Right now, the old man no longer looked so old. The return of the Heaven Splitting Divine Tablet made him appear much sharper.

After that, Long Chen nodded. He wasn’t able to help them with this. Looking at Bao Buping and the others messing around, Long Chen was afraid that he would die of envy. It just so happened that he was worried about Wilde, so he rushed back.

Once Long Chen said goodbye to the ancestors and set foot on the transportation formation, one of the three ancestors turned to the old man.

“Is he really that legendary existence?”

“Although I can’t say that I’m sure, it’s very likely.” The old man nodded. He didn’t have Li Tianxuan’s confidence in this, or he wouldn’t have risked death to save him today.

“But no such existence has ever reached the Heaven Merging realm in all of history…” The ancestor frowned.

“Long Chen is different from them. I trust that he will definitely pass the tribulation. Even a Sovereign calls him brother, so how could he be someone with such a short life?” said the old man.

“A Sovereign calls him brother? Is that really true?” The three ancestors were shocked by this information.

“Of course it’s true. Sovereign Mo Li met Long Chen in front of Devil Spirit Mountain, and everyone from the Martial Heaven Continent saw it. Furthermore, Sovereign Mo Li appeared in his last heavenly tribulation. He definitely isn’t an ordinary person. That’s why I can’t confirm his status. If he really is that legendary existence, why would the Sovereign grow so close to him?” said the old man.

The old man felt that it was very likely that Long Chen was a Heaven-Defier. However, Heaven-Defiers always died to the Heavenly Daos. To oppose the Heavenly Daos was to also oppose the Dao of the Sovereigns, yet Sovereign Mo Li called Long Chen brother, so that muddled things.

However, there was one point that was sure. That was that Sovereign Mo Li had a high opinion of Long Chen, so Long Chen definitely wasn’t ordinary. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

“He wears black robes. He definitely isn’t the sixth generation Sovereign. How curious. Well, how could juniors like us see through the Sovereigns’ thoughts? Let him be. Since he is a member of the Heaven Splitting Battle Sect- no, it should be the Heaven Splitting Divine Sect. Since he is one of our disciples, even if he hasn’t done so much for the sect, we still have to fully support him. Follow him through wind and fire. We can’t be bothered to think any further about it. Haha, I actually managed to come out at this time. I can also show off a bit,” laughed the ancestor.

“That’s enough. We should hurry and focus on the divine source. Offer worship to the divine tablet to allow it to fully recover!”

The old man quickly gave orders. After that, the disciples knelt all around the Heaven Splitting Divine Tablet. Divine light flew out of them, entering the tablet.

At this moment, the tablet’s runes lit up and enveloped the sect. The energy from both sides formed a cycle.

As endless divine light flowed from the divine tablet to the disciples and back, the entire sect quivered. It was as if an ancient beast was slowly awakening. Once it woke up, it would shake the world.

…

When Long Chen returned to Devil Spirit Mountain, the first thing he did was look for Wilde. However, Wilde was nowhere to be found.
