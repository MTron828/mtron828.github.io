Chapter 4580 Dragon Sovereign? Heir?

Awakening the ancestral scale marked the first crucial step toward success. It signaled the possibility of forming a resonance with it.

However, for the majority, trying to awaken the ancestral scale was incredibly difficult. Most races were unable to do even that, let alone form a resonance.

In order to just awaken the ancestral scale, Bai Yingxue and the others had prepared over ten grand sacrificial ceremonies.

However, as they approached the ancestral scale, it automatically awakened on its own accord, rendering their preparations unnecessary. Bai Yingxue couldn’t help but glance at Long Chen, sensing a vague connection between his presence and the unexpected awakening.

When she first saw Long Chen, Bai Yingxue had a strange intuition that his presence would bring them good fortune. However, she hadn’t expected this fortune to come so quickly.

For many, awakening their ancestral scale would deplete all their power, so by the time they wanted to form a resonance with the ancestral scale, they didn’t have the energy to maintain it, resulting in failure.

After all, whether it was awakening the ancestral scale or forming a resonance with it, it burned away one’s essence blood. It was how the ancestral scale could accurately judge the strength of the test taker.

If the test taker’s power ran out during the resonance, then trying to subdue the dragon scale would be a dream.

Now that the ancestral scale had awoken on its own, Bai Yingxue saved a significant amount of energy, which bolstered her confidence in subduing it.

As they got closer to the ancestral scale, its sacred light grew more intense, like raging waves trying to push them back.

This force wasn’t frantic, but it was forceful. As a result, some of the white dragon race’s experts quickly lost the ability to keep going. They felt like there was a boulder pressing against their chests, causing them to be unable to advance a single step.

“Princess, I can only accompany you until this point,” they admitted defeat shamefully. Here, within the domain of the ancestral scale, they keenly felt the constraints of their bloodline talent. They could progress no further. Beyond this point, not only would their bodies be unable to endure, but their souls would also be at risk of injury.

“You’ve done well. Your progress already surpasses any historical records. Remain here and receive the baptism.” Bai Yingxue nodded approvingly to them.

She truly did feel gratified as they stood many miles further than what their elders had predicted would be their limit. This result would be enough to completely change their lives.

What a good start for the white dragon race. More importantly, thousands of them could go even further with her.

The further they got to the ancestral scale, the more they would benefit. The white dragon race’s experts gritted their teeth and persevered, walking forward.

Long Chen and Bai Yingxue were at the front. Bai Yingxue was like a fish in water within this sacred light. This bit of resistance was nothing to her.

When Bai Yingxue looked at Long Chen, she was astonished to see that his footsteps were even lighter than hers. It was as if he didn’t feel the slightest resistance at all.

A few miles from the ancestral scale, only Long Chen and Bai Yingxue remained, and the others stood behind at different spots, having reached their limits in resisting the pressure.

Even Bai Yingxue started to find it challenging to move. The powerful force compelled her to circulate her dragon blood power to resist it.

However, Long Chen’s footsteps were as easy as they ever were. Bai Yingxue couldn’t help asking, “Brother Long—” Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

“Don’t speak.” Just then, an ancient and powerful voice rang out in Bai Yingxue’s mind, causing her to involuntarily quiver. The distraction almost blew her back.

“What is it?”

Long Chen turned to her, looking at her curiously upon seeing her expression.

“Uh... never mind?” answered Bai Yingxue.

Even though she tried her best to contain her shock, she couldn’t hold back the disbelief in her eyes. She was quivering, but no one knew whether it was from excitement or nervousness.

Long Chen was smart and could tell that she was hiding something from him, but he was tactful enough not to ask. He just continued onward with her.

When they arrived right beneath the white dragon scale, all the white dragon race’s experts tensed up. This was the critical juncture—the moment for Bai Yingxue to carry out the ceremony to form a resonance with the ancestral scale.

Bai Yingxue would need to ignite her essence blood to do this, forming a bridge that would allow her to commune with the will of the ancestral scale from another era.

What they hadn’t expected was that Long Chen, an outsider, would manage to walk right to the bottom of the ancestral scale.

Nevertheless, they harbored no concerns about it. They held unwavering confidence in their instincts and refused to believe that Long Chen would pose any threat to the white dragon race. On the contrary, they believed that Long Chen would offer assistance during a critical moment.

Suddenly, a strange scene occurred. Two rays of divine light fell from the ancestral scale, illuminating both Long Chen and Bai Yingxue.

At that instant, whether it was the white dragon race or the experts of the other races, they were all taken aback.

“What’s going on?” They all stared in disbelief.

As seasoned experts of the dragon race, they understood the necessity of igniting their essence blood to form a bridge to commune with the ancestral scale.

However, this time, it was the ancestral scale itself that formed the bridge to them, toppling their understanding of the world.

Within those pillars of light, the figures of Long Chen and Bai Yingxue faded, quickly vanishing from sight.

“The resonance is over. They’ve entered the ancestral scale for the trial!”

Cries of disbelief echoed, reverberating even among the experts of the white dragon race. They had imagined numerous obstacles on their journey to this point, but they had never anticipated it would be so effortless.

“The heavens are looking after the white dragon race! We are finally going to soar!” exclaimed one of the white dragon race’s experts, his voice quivering with emotion. His fellow white dragons also started to shout, and some even wept, kowtowing toward the ancestral scale.

Within the pillar of light, Long Chen couldn’t see what was happening in the outside world; he couldn’t even see Bai Yingxue. The scene before him was constantly changing as if he had been drawn into a spacetime channel where space was constantly twisting. When the world finally became still, he saw an endless lake around him, and the surface of the lake was as flat as the surface of a mirror.

Reflected on the surface of the lake was an immense figure that left Long Chen gaping in astonishment. It was an enormous white dragon, its size seemingly boundless, spanning the entire expanse of the sky, yet its complete form remained elusive.

This dragon was covered in glistening white scales with beautiful marks on them, akin to jade with images of mountains and rivers, birds and flowers, as well as the sun, moon, and stars on them.

As the giant dragon slowly turned, a giant dragon head emerged, fixing its gaze upon Long Chen. Long Chen returned its gaze, his astonishment evident.

Suddenly, the dragon spoke, its voice resounding, “Welcome, great heir to the Dragon Sovereign.”

“Dragon Sovereign? Heir? Long Chen was left dumbfounded at the mention of these titles.
