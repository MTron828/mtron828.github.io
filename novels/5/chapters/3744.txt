Chapter 3733 Mother Flame

Long Chen saw hundreds of thousands of experts wearing the robes of the Sacred Pill Hall. There was actually a transportation formation in front of him where experts continued to occasionally come out.Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Going further, he saw a huge barrier, and beyond the barrier, he saw a burning glacier.

“Big brother Long Chen, the Ice Soul Divine Flame is inside the glacier,” transmitted Huo Linger.

Long Chen nodded. “It seems that the three thousand worlds actually have the Sacred Pill Hall’s people. They are natives. As for the ones coming through the transportation formation, they are the Divine Lord disciples. Their auras are different from the ones that were originally here.”

Long Chen noticed that the ones coming through the transportation formations had auras like him. Although their auras were powerful, they were quite different from the auras of the natives. It was most likely the result of their living environments influencing their auras.

“It seems that the Sacred Pill Hall has set their sights on the Ice Soul.” Long Chen saw three Divine Venerates standing guard over this place, so he couldn’t help smiling bitterly.

If he was to say that his luck was bad, well, he had at least run into the Ice Soul Divine Flame. But if he was to say that his luck was good, well, there was a pile of powerful experts blocking his way. The benefits weren’t for him.

Three Divine Venerates and tens of thousands of World Kings, in addition to the hundreds of thousands of Immortal Kings. That lineup was absolutely terrifying.

Long Chen didn’t dare to make any rash moves, so he continued to watch in concealment. Fortunately, with Huo Linger present, his fluctuations were essentially merged with the auras of the surrounding flames. Even Divine Venerates couldn’t sense him.

More and more disciples were arriving. Amongst them were several Supreme heavenly geniuses, and they bowed to the three Divine Venerates. Those Divine Venerates then asked them a few questions before they quietly stood to the side.

Due to being too far, Long Chen didn’t dare to eavesdrop, nor did he dare to look at them too closely for fear of them sensing him. He didn’t even look at their mouths. So, he had no idea what they were seeing.

However, he saw that these new disciples were looking at the glacier excitedly.

With more and more disciples arriving, Long Chen stealthily slipped to a different location, avoiding the sight of those three Divine Venerates. He slowly got closer to those disciples.

As more time passed, the number of disciples went from a few hundreds to thousands. The crowd gradually became packed and had to spread out.

Long Chen was now close to them, so he came to a stop. He then had Huo Linger manifest the robes of the Sacred Pill Hall’s disciples.

Once there were a million disciples, Long Chen took advantage of the widening crowd to silently join them. Due to there being too many people, it was difficult to avoid any mess. No one noticed the addition of a single person.

Clearly, these people had come from the various nine heavens and didn’t all know each other. The addition of Long Chen’s face only caused people to glance at him before ignoring him. Just like that, Long Chen didn’t even bother changing his facial appearance.

After muddling into the crowd, Long Chen no longer needed to be so careful. He looked toward the three Divine Venerates.

At this moment, they were questioning another Supreme genius who had come from the transportation formation. They asked what heaven and what domain he was from. What Long Chen hadn’t expected was for this person to say that he was from the Violet Flame Heaven. However, Long Chen had never heard of the domain he was from.

The Divine Venerates nodded. “Go join the others. Three days later, we will activate the Ice Soul Divine Flame and assist you in tempering your core flame. This is a rare opportunity, so make sure to maintain your peak condition.”

That disciple hastily bowed and joined the other disciples. The transportation formation continued to activate, with more disciples coming out every moment. With every breath, hundreds of people would come.

However, these Divine Venerates didn’t say anything to those disciples. They only asked a few questions of the Supreme geniuses and not even all of them.

As more time passed, more people appeared. Three days later, there were over forty million disciples gathered. This number made Long Chen jump in shock.

The Sacred Pill Hall’s disciples were all flame cultivators. Seventy percent were martial flame cultivators, and the remaining thirty percent had exceptionally powerful Spiritual Strength. Their auras were too peaceful to be fighters, so they must be pill cultivators.

Furthermore, amongst these forty million disciples, there were hundreds of Supreme geniuses. Long Chen was truly shocked.

He had previously encountered the Sacred Pill Hall. However, he hadn’t felt them to be so powerful. He had even felt them to be a far cry from the Bloodkill Hall and the Nine Underworld Hall.

Lord Brahma had four halls beneath him, the Nine Underworld Hall, the Bloodkill Hall, the Sacred Pill Hall, and the Martial God Hall. Long Chen had never encountered the Martial God Hall, but he had frequently faced the Bloodkill Hall and the Nine Underworld Hall.

Long Chen had assumed that the four eyes should be relatively evenly matched, but when he saw this number of disciples, he found that it was a terrifying lineup.

It had to be known that whether it was Enpuda or Liao Bencang, they had only brought a few thousand disciples. Was the difference really so immense? Or did it mean that Enpuda and Liao Bencang were concealing their true power?

Long Chen felt a bit lost. He couldn’t quite understand Enpuda and Liao Bencang. Things probably weren’t as simple as he imagined.

Even three days later, more disciples continued to arrive. However, after a set amount of time, the transportation formation suddenly dimmed.

At this time, the Divine Venerates stood up. Everyone’s nerves tensed.

One of the Divine Venerates looked over all the disciples and announced, “You are the disciples of the Sacred Pill Hall, the pious followers of Lord Brahma. Today, you will receive Divine Venerate Brahma’s blessing. In front of you is the Ice Soul Divine Flame ranked eighth on the Heavenly Flame Ranking. This Ice Soul Divine Flame is not the Ice Soul seeds that you’ve seen in the outside world. It is the true mother flame. This is the one true Ice Soul Divine Flame. The others are all seeds. It has immense power, and despite being sealed for millions and millions of years, causing its power to be no more than one ten-thousandth of its peak, it still possesses enough power to destroy the very world. In a bit, we will activate the Heaven Seizing Grand Formation. We will suppress the Ice Soul Divine Flame’s power and allow you to absorb it. The Ice Soul Divine Flame possesses cold qi, a special variant amongst flames. If you can control a trace of the Ice Soul’s power, whether it is for refining pills or fighting others, you will find many benefits. As for how much you can absorb, it’s up to your own ability and luck. Other than that, let me give you some good news. The Ice Soul Divine Flame has already gone through similar absorptions hundreds of times. It has already reached its limit. After this time, it might completely vanish. That means that it is very likely for an Ice Soul master to appear amongst all of you. In other words, the Ice Soul energy that you absorb might very likely transform into a seed. As your cultivation base increases, it will strengthen, until it becomes the true Ice Soul Divine Flame.”

When the Divine Venerate said this, all the disciples were incredibly excited. If they could control the Ice Soul Divine Flame, wouldn’t they be unrivaled beneath the heavens?

“Activate the grand formation!”

Following the order of the Divine Venerate, Long Chen and the others were involuntarily pulled toward the glacier. Once they were pulled in, a majestic power erupted. Countless disciples screamed in pain and terror.

Millions of disciples directly exploded, transforming into fragments of ice. However, those ice fragments were actually burning. They turned into nothingness in just a bit. Seeing this, the Sacred Pill Hall’s disciples were all horrified.
