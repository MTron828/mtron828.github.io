Chapter 4057 A Sea of Skeletons

“Boss, did I mishear something?!”

Xia Chen couldn't believe his ears. The legends of a fiend eye were well-known, and even he had heard about them. According to the tales, anyone unfortunate enough to be sucked inside the fiend eye would never return.

Others who saw a fiend eye would instantly flee, but Long Chen wanted to get closer? Did he have something wrong with his head?

“Go. It’ll be fine,” said Long Chen.

On his previous journey from the Darklight Heaven to the Violet Flame Heaven, Long Chen had encountered a fiend eye. To his dismay, he and all the other passengers on the ship were just regarded as sacrificial pawns by the Soaring Dragon Company.

During that particular moment, Long Chen became acquainted with a brother and sister named Bai Fang and Bai Rui. Tragically, the two of them had endured a harrowing past, and even after that, they were still schemed against by the Soaring Dragon Company.

Because of this matter, Long Chen found himself grappling with a profound sense of guilt, which then fueled his intense hatred toward the Soaring Dragon Company.

Seeing the fiend eye again, he was reminded of the siblings’ sacrifice. But now, he had undergone a significant transformation and possessed the Earth Cauldron, which granted him power far beyond his previous self. With his newfound strength, he wanted to investigate the fiend eye further.

Feeling helpless, Xia Chen could only steer the battleship toward the giant whirlpool. Once they were closer, an irresistible force pulled them in. Within the heart of the whirlpool, space quaked with explosive rumbles, and fierce winds howled relentlessly.

It felt like hell on earth. The entire area was filled with a sinister aura that sent shivers down their spines, making their hair stand on end.

Yu Qingxuan stood by Long Chen’s side, her face a bit pale. Seeing her fright, Long Chen comforted her. “Don’t worry, I’m here. I just want to understand something.”

Suddenly, the deafening sound of the storm subsided, and the raging winds were gone. In this peaceful atmosphere, their battleship slowly fell.

Just like that, they had reached the heart of the fiend eye. Within this enormous whirlpool, their battleship was as tiny as a speck of sand.

Surrounded by the giant walls of the whirlpool, it felt as though they were sinking into the jaws of a malevolent creature.

Now, the battleship could no longer escape. All its runes had lost effect, so they could only watch as they slowly descended.

The most frightening thing about this place was the complete absence of sound. The eerie calmness made it feel like a realm of death, where silence prevailed and all life seemed to have vanished.

Long Chen stood at the very front of the ship, observing everything without a hint of fear. He suddenly asked, “Qingxuan, do you feel like the aura of this place is a bit familiar?”

Yu Qingxuan was startled at first, but after sensing it, she was astonished. “Now that you mention it, it really is a bit familiar. It’s like…”

“The aura of hell,” said Long Chen.

“Could it be…?”

Long Chen nodded. “Most likely, this fiend eye is connected to the Nether Emperor.”

“If it’s related to the Nether Emperor, why did you have to come here?!” Yu Qingxuan turned pale. Was this not throwing themselves into the enemy’s net?

Long Chen smiled slightly. “It is precisely because it is related to the Nether Emperor that we have to come and take a look.”

Yu Qingxuan didn’t know that the Nether Emperor had been slain by the Nine Star Master and was still in the middle of nirvanic rebirth. Of course, if that wasn’t the case, the Nether Emperor wouldn’t be searching for heavenly geniuses from various races to serve as seeds for his plans.

Time seemed to stand still in this place. They didn’t know how long it was before they saw what was on the bottom of the whirlpool

When they saw it, even Long Chen gasped. It was a giant sacrificial altar with a mountain of endless skeletons piled up around it. They could see no end to those skeletons.

Guo Ran and the others felt chills. These skeletons were all human skeletons, and the number was simply impossible to calculate.

At the heart of the altar was a strange tree, a giant towering tree. However, within this enormous space, it appeared small.

As they got closer, they saw that this tree’s roots were embedded into a skull. However, the skull was covered by so many skeletons piled up around it that they couldn’t see its exact shape. Thus, they didn’t know if it was a human skull or some other lifeform.

For some reason, when Long Chen saw this skull, he thought of the skull that he had seen in the Immemorial Path thanks to the Eastern Wasteland Bell. His heart then pounded wildly. Were they connected?

The number of skeletons littering this enormous space was incredulous. They were piled up thousands of miles high, further than the eye could see. Even the Dragonblood warriors were shaken by this sight.

“The majority of these skeletons are in the Immortal King and World King realms. Only a very small portion is in the Divine Venerate realm,” said Xia Chen after examining the skeletons. All of them were high level cultivators.

“Just how many people are here? Trillions? Trillions of trillions?” Guo Ran’s voice quivered.

This was not just a number but lives lost. Therefore, at the same time as they were shaken, they were also filled with rage.

The human race was actually viewed as prey to be slaughtered and sacrificed here? It was unacceptable.

Buzz.

Suddenly, space quivered and a horrifying aura engulfed them, causing them to startle in fear.

“A Heaven Venerate?!”

They took out their weapons, thinking that a Heaven Venerate had managed to chase after them in the heavenly river.

However, they quickly realized that they were wrong. This Heaven Venerate’s aura was chaotic and hadn’t locked onto them, so they weren’t his target. In fact, he was fleeing.Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

The next moment, the void quivered, and they quickly saw his figure. It was an elder in gray robes. With a sword in his hand, he swung it through the void, causing cracks to split open. He then used the cracks as stairs and ran up them.

It was evident that he had been pulled into the fiend eye and was desperately attempting to break free. Unluckily for him, the fiend eye's interior was governed by unique laws that nullified the power of Heavenly Daos, including Xia Chen's talismans. Unable to use his full power but still able to still cut through the void, it seemed that he was truly a terrifying Heaven Venerate.

However, no matter how he struggled, he was still descending rapidly. When he was near the bottom, he noticed Long Chen and the others.

Startled by the sudden turn of events, the Heaven Venerate didn't even get a chance to react before the strange tree sprang to life. Its branch shot forward, piercing him like a deadly spear.

The Heaven Venerate let out a horrifying scream as a faint wisp of smoke emanated from the wound. In an instant, his essence, qi, and spirit were completely drained.

Devoid of his body, the Heaven Venerate's clothes dropped to the ground, and his sword clattered onto the altar. Unable to comprehend how a Heaven Venerate could just vanish like that, Long Chen and the others stared at each other in appalled silence.
