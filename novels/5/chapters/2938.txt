Chapter 2927 Removing the Peng Bird

Mu Qingyun and the others were stunned, staring in shock at that pretty girl. However, they didn’t dare to believe their eyes. Rainbow cranes could take human form?

In the immortal world, the beasts had to become one with heaven and earth, obtaining the approval of the Daos in order to take human form. However, those beasts were existences far beyond their current imagination.

If they hadn’t personally witnessed it, they wouldn’t believe that this girl was actually a rainbow crane.

The reason Long Chen came out was because he sensed a spiritual fluctuation. It was as if this rainbow crane was greeting him.

Looking at this girl that was so delicate that she appeared like a porcelain doll, Long Chen couldn’t help but smile. He squatted down until he was the same height as her.

“Little sister, how do you know that I’m a good person? In truth, this big brother isn’t a good person. Did you misjudge?” asked Long Chen with a smile.

Long Chen was a good person? Ignoring whether or not others would believe such a statement, even he himself didn’t believe it. However, with such an adorable girl calling him a good person, even though he didn’t care how others viewed him, he had to admit that he was happy.

“The rainbow crane race can’t misjudge people. Big brother is a good person. How about you play with me? I just slept for three thousand years, and now I want to go out and play. But my dad and mom won’t let me leave this region.” The girl pulled on Long Chen’s hand pleadingly.

Long Chen was startled. “Three thousand years? How old are you?”

“Based on your human race’s historical measures, it’s been eighty thousand years since I was born. Your academy’s dean has changed three times. But I spent most of that time sleeping, so I didn’t get to interact with other people. Actually, other than you, other people give me an uncomfortable feeling. I can’t play with them. So how about you play with me?” The girl looked at Long Chen with her big eyes expectantly. No one could say no to such a face.

Eighty thousand years? Three generations of deans? And he was the big brother? Long Chen’s head was swimming. He should be calling her grandaunt.

However, looking at her expectant expression, he said, “No problem. When your big brother has time, I’ll bring you out to pay. But today, big brother has important things to do, so I can’t accompany you. I’ll give you a gift instead.”

Long Chen gave her a Yuan Spirit Pill he had refined. It was a pill to replenish Spiritual Strength and immortal spiritual energy. Moreover, there was a star revolving on top of it with mist around the whole pill. It was nice to look at.

The girl had never seen such a thing and happily received it. She then repeatedly thanked him.

“Big brother, I won’t disturb you any longer. I’ll come find you later!”

After that, the girl returned to the form of a rainbow crane. After another circle around Long Chen, she left with the other rainbow cranes, leaving beautiful rainbow arcs in their wake before vanishing.

Watching them leave, Mu Qingyun and the others felt like they were in a dream. They had not just seen the rainbow cranes but also one that transformed into human form.

Just at this moment, a flying boat appeared in midair, barging straight toward Mu Qingyun’s flying boat.

Seeing this, Mu Qingyun and the others cried out. But just a few feet from crashing into them, that flying boat came to a stop, leaving them covered in cold sweat. None of them would have survived such a collision.

“You’ve got guts to ignore orders.” Four people walked off of the flying boat. They were all Four Peak experts.

What shocked Mu Qingyun and the others was that these Four Peak experts were only wearing disciple robes. They weren’t Elders. Furthermore, they appeared very young.

“Who are you? Report your name!” shouted one of them angrily.

He was the one in charge of overseeing and protecting the rainbow cranes. And since Long Chen hadn’t listened to his orders and had gone out, it infuriated him.

Although the rainbow cranes had ultimately left unscathed, he still came to settle things with Long Chen.

“I’ll return those words to you. Don’t point at others with your finger,” said Long Chen with a frown. The attitude of this guy was irritating.

Afraid of conflict, Li Cai immediately stepped forward. “Let me introduce you! This is-”

“Shut up! Who do you think you are? You aren’t qualified to talk here.” Li Cai was immediately chided.

“Outer disciple robes? Did you come to check in?” One of them suddenly noticed Li Cai and the others’ robes. Before this, they had only been focused on Long Chen who was wearing his tattered black robes. But now, they seemed to realize something.

“A group of novices dared to act arrogantly? Are you aware that the death rate of inner academy disciples is thousands of times greater than outer academy disciples? You have no ability to be arrogant here. Otherwise, in the future, you’ll die without even realizing how you died,” sneered one of them.

Mu Qingyun and the others’ expressions changed. They had been looking forward to growing in the inner academy, but before they even checked in, they were already blocked by a group of tyrannical people. Hence, their good mood vanished, and it was replaced with fury.

“Are you mute? Speak!” shouted the leader. He then reached for Long Chen’s throat angrily.

Li Cai and the others cried out in shock. They immediately realized that things were about to go sour. Long Chen also hadn’t expected this person to dare to attack him here. At this close range, this person’s hand was already approaching his clothes.

If Long Chen immediately retreated, he was ninety percent sure that he could dodge completely. But if he was one step too slow, that person would be able to tear off his robes, and that might completely destroy them. After all, the stitching he was using to keep them together wasn’t very good.

Seeing Long Chen’s collar being grabbed by that person, Mu Qingyun and the others’ expressions changed. They had a premonition that something bad was about to happen.

“What’s your name?” demanded Long Chen coldly.

“Brat, you have guts. I am Zhang Peng. What about it? Do you want vengeance? You newbies don’t know how high the heavens are. I’ve seen plenty of you before,” sneered that person.

“Starting today, you can change your name to Zhang Peng[1]!” !” Long Chen suddenly kneed Zhang Peng below his abdomen, and an explosive sound rang out. Everyone heard the sound of flesh exploding.

Li Cai and the others shivered. Every man knew just how vicious this move of Long Chen’s was, and they couldn’t help feeling a chill.

As a result, Zhang Peng’s body bent, and his eyes almost popped out. The hand holding Long Chen was released. At this moment, Zhang Peng was like a dried-up shrimp lying on the ground, quivering in pain. He was in too much pain to even make a sound.

The other three people were shocked, but before they could react, dozens of weapons came out and pointed at them. The three of them immediately became too frightened to move.

“What… what are you all doing?!”

The three Four Peak experts were shocked and enraged. They had not expected these rookies to dare to resist. By the time they reacted, their lives were in their hands.

“Li Cai!”

“Yes!”

“Slap them all in the face. Let’s make a ruckus to announce our entrance to the inner academy,” said Long Chen, flattening the wrinkles on the front of his robes.

[1] His name is 张鹏 Zhang Peng. Long Chen changes it to 张朋 Zhang Peng. The first characters of both names are the same, but if you look at the second characters, you can see that 鹏 is 朋 with an additional radical to the right. The radical is bird, which can be slang for penis. In the second name, Long Chen has removed the bird radical.
