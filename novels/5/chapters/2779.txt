Chapter 2768 The Sovereigns’ Devotion

Yun Shang sent Long Chen away with a single palm. He then formed a hand seal, and a pillar of light soared into the sky, enveloping the entire Martial Heaven Continent.

After that, the light contracted, sweeping through the battlefield. All the Martial Heaven Continent’s experts that were fighting vanished.

Meng Qi, Chu Yao, and the others suddenly found themselves within the core of the Martial Heaven Continent. They were also protected now.

“What?”

Mo Nian was dumbfounded. What was this supposed to be? Were they not supposed to fight?

At this moment, Sovereign Yun Shang’s figure appeared below the image of the Eastern Wasteland Bell. He overlooked the entire battlefield.

Yun Shang, Mo Li, Qing Xu, Han Wei, and Zi Yang formed hand seals, and the five divine items unleashed divine light that protected everyone.

The five Sovereigns spoke in unison, their voices thundering throughout the world. “All devils and gods hear, using my name as Sovereign, I swear that as long as I live, I will protect this territory. I will slay devils for the Martial Heaven Continent. If I am dead, then my soul will not enter reincarnation. It will enter the earth and nourish all life. When demons attack, my blood soul will awaken and become the wall that repels evil.”

Heaven and earth resonated with their words, and the barrier that the Sovereigns had created protected everyone, moving countless people to tears.

The Sovereigns had fought for the Martial Heaven Continent and died for the Martial Heaven Continent. They were truly their protective gods.

The Sovereigns were unrivaled. No one could kill them. Hence, they had willingly died to pass their energy back to the continent, allowing more people to be blessed by karmic luck so they could find the chance to break this board.

Every generation of the Sovereigns had saved the continent. They had given up their chance to become gods, given up on reincarnation, instead fading forever from the world in order to protect it.

Mo Nian, Guo Ran, Gu Yang, and the others couldn’t hold back their tears either. They had spilled blood countless times in battle without crying, but today they cried. This world had a kind of realm that could not be passed, and it was called Sovereign, a hero who had paid everything for the continent.

“This world has never known peace. It was only people taking the burden for us. The only reason we can see light is because others used their bodies and souls to block the darkness,” said Meng Qi, sobbing.

The Sovereigns had died and their remnants were still protecting everyone. When that power ran out, the Sovereigns would truly vanish. In the future, as time passed, how many people would still remember them? How many would prefer to think of them as myths?

The High Priest, Ling Yunzi, Ma Ruyun, Daoist Heavenly Feather, and the others were also brought in.

“The Sovereigns are supreme.” The High Priest sighed in admiration. Although he was a follower of the Wine God, he still felt worship for the Sovereigns.

The armies of the Blood race, demonic beast race, and Undying race assaulted the Sovereigns’ barrier, but it didn’t even quiver.

As for the devil race’s army, they had almost been completely wiped out. All that remained were some people standing beside the altar and the Alldevil Heavenwalker who was on the altar, absorbing energy. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

Ling Yunzi said, “The Sovereigns have temporarily stopped the battle to avoid further losses that would give them more blood soul energy and allow them to become Sovereigns faster.”

“The Heaven Devastating Bracelet seems to have been temporarily suppressed as well,” said Ma Ruyun.

The world had returned to calm, and the earth was no longer rising like before. The crisis had been temporarily alleviated.

“The power of the Sovereigns will run out sooner or later. Master, what should we do?” asked Yue Zifeng.

Ling Yunzi smiled slightly. “What we should do is patiently wait. This is a battle to seize the heavens. Only someone who can defy the heavens can turn the tides.”

“A person who can defy the heavens? Is that boss?” asked Guo Ran and the others.

Ling Yunzi nodded. “Yes. The favorites of the heavens are the Empyreans. There are some oddities as well like Heaven-Seizers. But the ones that cause the heavens to be terrified are Heaven-Defiers. The laws of the world are in chaos, so there is no need to conceal Long Chen’s identity any longer.”

Hearing that Long Chen was a Heaven-Defier, countless jaws dropped. Li Tianxuan was completely calm as he had long since guessed this identity.

“No wonder he faced so many tribulations in his life. His heavenly tribulations were absolutely terrifying ones that only sought to kill him. The Heavenly Daos clearly wanted him dead!” People came to a sudden understanding.

“The legends mention that Heaven-Defiers usually have companions. No wonder everyone around Long Chen also cultivates so quickly. As a heaven-Defier, he forcibly raised a group of people without much talent into apex experts.”

The existence of Heaven-Defiers was unknown to most of the junior generation, but some of the seniors knew of them. There were many legends of them. Those legends said that Heaven-Defiers soared like shooting stars, but it was always the case that they died to heavenly tribulation just as their light began to bloom.

No Heaven-Defiers ever actually managed to grow up. They all died young, so most people didn’t care too much about their legends.

When Ling Yunzi revealed Long Chen’s identity, it shocked countless people. That was because there were no legends of a Heaven-Defier that had grown to this point.

“Haha, this little fellow really is a Heaven-Defier. That’s enough for me to brag for a lifetime.” The old man laughed proudly.

He was covered in fresh blood from the battle, but he didn’t care about it at all. He didn’t even wipe that blood away.

Although the Heaven Splitting Divine Sect had Bao Buping and Chang Hao, in terms of combat power, they were still inferior to the old man.

The old man had spent a lifetime studying the ninth form of Split the Heavens and the Battle God Sacred Canon. With Long Chen’s medicinal pills, he had managed to reach the mid Heaven Merging realm.

However, even though he was only at the mid Heaven Merging realm, his killing power surpassed Bao Buping and Chang Hao. In a real fight against the old man, the two of them would be slain in less than ten exchanges. To use the old man’s words, old ginger was hotter than young ginger.

Moreover, the old man had the Heaven Splitting Blade and the support of the Heaven Splitting Divine Tablet. With the assistance of these two divine items, he was almost unrivaled. If it weren’t for Bao Buping and Chang Hao pulling him back as if their lives depended on it, the old man might have challenged one of the Emperors.

“Speaking of Long Chen, where is he?” asked Qu Jianying. After searching amongst the crowd, she didn’t see Long Chen.

“Long Chen has been sent to the heart of the star-field. Prepare yourselves. This barrier won’t last too long. The Martial Heaven Continent needs everyone's power to defend it.” Sovereign Yun Shang’s voice rang out in everyone’s ears.
