Chapter 2688 Central Plains Cauldron

Only a tip of the Heaven Devastating Bracelet was revealed, but the light it unleashed had annihilated all the experts within this headquarters of the sea demon race.

It was the demon emperor of the sea demon race that had activated this attack. He had been forced to the point where he had no other option. Long Chen had the laws of the heavenly tribulation on him, allowing him to suppress all others who got close to him to the same cultivation base as him.

If that had continued, all those sea demons would have been killed sooner or later. Hence, as the emperor, he had directly activated the Heaven Devastating Bracelet’s attack to make sure that Long Chen at least accompanied them.

He was truly ruthless. Amongst those that were killed just now were his own progeny. Hence, his face was twisted. He had truly lost out this time. He shouldn’t have provoked Long Chen.

Or more accurately, he shouldn’t have used the Heaven Devastating Bracelet’s power to steal the karmic luck pearl. He had originally thought that the sea demon race’s profound power would be enough to shake the Martial Heaven Continent and allow the karmic luck pearl to fall easily into their pocket, allowing them to give rise to a Sovereign.

It was a great plan, but it had provoked the hornet’s nest. But rather than just some angry hornets, he had drawn out a terrifying hornet king like Long Chen. The sea demon race’s top experts were slaughtered by him, and the only thing that comforted the elder was that once Long Chen was killed by the Heaven Devastating Bracelet, they could turn things around.

Of all these experts, it was the dragon woman that had been infected by the most karmic luck from the pearl. Once Long Chen died, the karmic luck pearl would definitely choose her as master. She would be the sixth generation Sovereign.

BOOM!

Suddenly, the golden light exploded, unleashing black qi. As Long Chen’s divine ring shuddered, a black two-headed dragon appeared within it.

At this moment, a dragon roar rang out, forcing back the golden light and bringing Long Chen to the surface.

“A trash bracelet that hasn’t even awoken yet thinks it can trap me? Keep dreaming,” sneered Evilmoon. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

This was Evilmoon’s original appearance. It had appeared within Long Chen’s divine ring. Furthermore, his white scales had now become half-black. Light and dark twisted around each other. Long Chen was in a strange state.

“Long Chen, that fellow has activated the Heaven Devastating Bracelet, causing him to lose most of his longevity. Killing him is now no longer so meaningful. Go, kill that Long Aotian!” shouted Evilmoon.

Having been unleashed from its seal, Evilmoon was filled with power that it wanted to release. Originally, it had required an equal level of power from Long Chen just to draw out some of its power, but now it was different. It could unleash its full power and merge it with Long Chen.

Although Long Chen had the essence blood of an azure dragon within his veins, the blood of a true dragon, in the end, its grade was too low. On the other hand, Evilmoon was a dragon king. If Yun Shang had not destroyed its physical body, it might even advance to a dragon ancestor and open up an original cultivation path.

At this moment, the sea exploded and Long Aotian came flying out. However, Long Chen was following right behind with his dragon tail and immediately attacked.

As a result, Long Aotian’s arms shuddered and his dragon scales shattered. He became covered in blood.

The sight of him being injured to this extent aroused several cries. Someone as powerful as Long Aotian was actually fully suppressed by Long Chen.

“Aotian!” Long Aotian’s mother cried out. Long Chen was like a monster, and Long Aotian wasn’t a match for him.

At this moment, Long Aotian’s dragon spear flew out of his hand. He was no longer able to match Long Chen and Evilmoon’s combined power.

Long Aotian’s expression completely changed. Evilmoon’s power could only be described as terrifying. Long Chen was already powerful enough, but now he had a strange devouring power as well.

This devouring power was weakening Long Aotian’s offense and defense. With him weakening and Long Chen strengthening, he was naturally at a complete disadvantage.

Long Aotian rapidly formed one-handed seals to summon his dragon spear back. Without it, there was no way for him to withstand Evilmoon’s sharpness.

However, his hand seals had yet to be completed before Long Chen cut off his arm at the shoulder. Long Chen also kicked him in the ribs, breaking half of them.

Instinctively, Long Chen almost reached out to grab Long Aotian’s hair, only to grab nothing but blood. It was because the top of Long Aotian’s head no longer had hair, only bloody scabs.

Taking advantage of that brief lapse, Long Aotian kicked Long Chen’s chest. He had thought that this would force Long Chen to retreat, but he didn’t expect Long Chen to simply stand there and take his kick.

When his foot landed, his expression completely changed. It was as if his foot had landed on a giant star. At that moment, his foot broke and a bad premonition overwhelmed him. After that, a hand that was like an iron hook tightened around his ankle.

“How many fathers and mothers had their hearts broken because of you? How many people had their Spirit Bloods, Spirit Roots, and Spirit Bones taken because of you? Your retribution has come today.” Long Chen grabbed Long Aotian’s leg and suddenly stamped his foot on Long Aotian’s crotch while pulling with his hand.

In front of countless shocked gazes, Long Aotian’s leg was forcibly ripped off. Rainbow blood splashed.

Other than a portion of the divine families’ people, no one felt sympathy for Long Aotian. Most people only felt satisfaction.

“Long Chen, you dare to injure my son?! I will tear your entire family into pieces!” roared Long Aotian’s mother. Her face was twisted in fury. Long Aotian was her favorite, her pride and joy, as well as her life’s greatest hope.

Her roar drew countless people’s disdain. No wonder Long Aotian was such trash. It was because he had a mother who was the pinnacle of malicious trash.

Pretending not to hear anything, Long Chen once more shot after Long Aotian, slashing Evilmoon while the latter screamed in pain.

“Long Chen, since you’re so vicious, don’t blame me for killing you in place of the heavens!”

Long Qifeng couldn’t hold back any longer. Upon forming hand seals, an imposing sacred cauldron flew out.

“The Central Plains Cauldron!”

Upon spotting that bronze cauldron, everyone was shocked. The Central Plains Cauldron was actually with the divine families. Furthermore, Long Qifeng was controlling it. At this moment, this member of the five supreme divine items smashed toward Long Chen, and everyone’s expression changed. Was Long Qifeng planning on using the Central Plains Cauldron to eliminate Long Chen?
