Chapter 2160 Flames of Fury Soar

“A group of nocturnal ghosts also dares to be wild?” Using his right hand’s fingers as a sword and his left hand still in a seal, Yue Zifeng unleashed a sharp slash.

Whether it was weapons or flesh, wherever his sword-light went, it was severed. None of the assassins could stop him.

The Bloodkill Hall’s assassins were cut down one by one, shocking the experts present.

“No wonder he was able to use ordinary metal to fight against a divine weapon.” Using his fingers as a sword to slay such powerful enemies was something even more incomprehensible.

BOOM!

Suddenly, an explosion shook the sky as flames unfurled.

The ancient race expert coughed up a mouthful of blood, one of his arms gone. He was sent flying by a lightning spear.

Within the flames, Long Chen had a pair of giant lightning wings. He had switched Evilmoon with a lightning spear. The flames forced back Shi Lingfeng and the other expert, allowing Long Chen to escape their blockade.

“Long Chen’s so powerful. Even three supreme experts couldn’t stop him.”

Long Chen charged over to Yue Zifeng’s side and grabbed Yue Zifeng’s shoulder. The flames soared out, and the remaining assassins slipped away, vanishing. With Long Chen there, they didn’t have any chance of killing Yue Zifeng.

“Boss...” Yue Zifeng was growing paler and paler.

“Don’t talk. You’ve burned too much essence blood. Take a break and leave the rest to me.” Long Chen placed a hand on the back of Yue Zifeng’s head, causing him to faint.

Long Chen fed him a medicinal pill. Just now, Yue Zifeng had been igniting his essence blood and his soul for that finger sword. He had used up his mental energy, and replacing it with his essence blood, soul, and Yuan Spirit energy was a self-damaging technique. The price was immense, and Yue Zifeng needed to hurry and recover, or the consequences would be severe.

“Long Chen, you traitor of the Martial Heaven Continent. Today, the heroes of this world will punish you for colluding with the original devil race.” Another human expert came charging over at him.

Just as he flew over, an arrow shot toward him, causing his expression to change. He slammed his palm at the arrow.

BOOM!

The arrow exploded, but he was also knocked back. Blood dripped down his hand.

“Idiot, even if you have to slander someone, you should make a better excuse. I, Mo Nian, will send off anyone who wants to reincarnate!” Mo Nian appeared by Long Chen’s side, the Five Element Sun Hunting Bow in his hand.

“Rushuang, help me out.” Long Chen ignored those enemies and sent a message to Beitang Rushuang.

“Speak.” 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

“Help me look after my brother. I have something I need to do, so I’ll need to leave first,” said Long Chen.

“Alright.” Beitang Rushuang directly agreed. She went over to Long Chen and took Yue Zifeng.

Long Chen was very at ease with Yue Zifeng in her hands. Beitang Rushuang was very fiery, and no one dared to provoke her.

“Mo Nian, this place is a trap. Don’t waste time. Go to the Heaven Splitting Battle Sect, and I’ll go to the Xuantian Dao Sect. If you resolve the problems, we’ll regroup at the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow race,” said Long Chen to Mo Nian.

“You mean...?

“Have you noticed? Not one of the disciples from the Heaven Splitting Battle Sect or the Xuantian Dao Sect came. The Corrupt path’s Tian Xiezi and the Xuan Beasts’ Kun Pengzi have also not appeared. There are some clues as to their plan. We have to be quick,” said Long Chen.

Long Chen hadn’t sensed it at the beginning, merely assuming that the Xuantian Dao Sect and the Heaven Splitting Battle Sect’s disciples might be late, but when the Bloodkill Hall’s assassins had attacked, he had realized something was off. This was a trap.

“Alright.” Mo Nian nodded and shot away. But before he could get far, over ten experts blocked his way.

“Mo Nian, you graverobbing scum, leave your life here today!”

“Scram! I haven’t even robbed your family’s ancestral tomb!” Mo Nian didn’t even recognize the person talking, meaning these people were just making up excuses.

“Shut up. You’ve done so many evil things, and you’re colluding with that villain Long Chen. You deserve death,” sneered that expert. He directly attacked. Opening his hand, a rune covered the sky and slammed at Mo Nian.

“Good, I see you don’t want your ancestral tombs to be calm anymore. I’ll help you.” Mo Nian furiously raised his bow, his manifestation appearing behind him. There were two figures in his manifestation exuding divine power.

“Mo Nian, don’t waste time!” shouted Long Chen as a reminder. He was also flying away. It was unfortunate he didn’t have time to settle things with the people who had blocked him.

“Hmph, count yourselves lucky today. Just wait, your daddy Mo will be going for a stroll around your family tombs soon.” Mo Nian snorted and he suddenly shot away like an arrow himself, so fast that others couldn’t even see him.

“Long Chen, don’t you think it’s rude not to explain yourself before leaving?” demanded one expert.

“That’s right, if you don’t explain the matter of the original devil race today, don’t even think about leaving.”

“The dark era is about to descend. The Martial Heaven Continent cannot have any spies or traitors. Don’t even think about leaving with all of us here.”

One supreme genius after another stood up, demanding answers from Long Chen.

“Brother Long, there must be some misunderstandings here. Why not peacefully explain things to everyone to avoid harming any relationships?” Dongfang Yuyang also stood up, but he was acting like a mediator.

“Scram!” This hypocrite was once more going against him. Long Chen didn’t want to play any more games.

“Brother Long, why harm people like this? There are many questionable points about you. Are others not permitted to raise their doubts?” Dongfang Yuyang frowned.

“Brother Yuyang, this person is clearly feeling guilty so he can only curse others. There’s no need to waste any words. We can directly suppress him and do a soulsearch to know the truth.”

“That’s right, this is for the peace of the Martial Heaven Continent. There’s no need to have so many misgivings. This is an emergency measure just for this time.”

More and more experts were standing up against Long Chen, stunning the other experts. Just what was going on?

“Long Chen, don’t think that just because you hid it well, no one noticed you colluding with the original devil race. If you don’t give us an explanation-”

That expert was in the midst of shouting at Long Chen when a lightning spear shot toward him, sending him flying and making him cough up blood.

“How brazen Long Chen, you dare to attack? Be suppressed!” Another expert suddenly slammed a palm at him.

“Since you all like courting death, I’ll help you out!” Long Chen suddenly soared, his eyes filled with icy killing intent. The space behind him shattered, and thunderforce condensed into a giant lightning channel.

An endless torrent of lightning surged out of the channel, filling the world with lightning. Long Chen’s lightning wings grew many times larger, filling the sky.

The giant palm that expert had sent crashing toward him crumbled, unable to bear a single strike from Long Chen’s lightning wings.

“Die!” Long Chen’s furious roar was like thunder and also like the call of a death god. The lightning spear stabbed into that expert, and being still off-balance from having his palm destroyed, he was blown to bits. He only had time to take out a sword but didn’t have time to use it. Just like that, one of the supreme geniuses of the ancient era, an expert that had dominated their generation, vanished from the world.

“If you want to die, then come!” Long Chen was enraged. He blamed himself for being too careless, for underestimating the guts of his enemies.

Long Chen’s lightning spear directly pierced forward, while his giant lightning wings slashed down. He was like a lightning god walking this world.

Those supreme geniuses of the ancient era were appalled by Long Chen’s power. Over ten of them were sent flying by his attack.

That scene sent a chill down other people’s spines. Over ten supreme geniuses had been unable to stop him. Long Chen was truly heaven-defying.

Just at that moment, a diagram appeared in the sky, blocking Long Chen’s path. There were millions of stars flowing within that diagram. Every star was a ball of flames, and they flowed out like a celestial river, enveloping Long Chen.

“The Brahma Divine Diagram!”

Startled cries rang out. The Pill Fairy appeared in front of Long Chen, her white robes untouched by the mortal dust of this world.

“Long Chen, you blasphemed my Pill Valley’s gods. Today, we will settle all our enmities.” The Pill Fairy looked at Long Chen with icy mercilessness.
