Chapter 2436 Spatial Crack

Translator: BornToBe

The heavens were torn apart. It was unknown what these lifeforms had done, but the very world collapsed. A giant crack spread through the air.

A powerful suction force followed it, causing space to distort. Long Chen felt as if he was within a sea, with the water crazily pouring into the crack. His expression instantly changed.

“Watch out. If you are sucked into the spatial crack, you’ll be dead,” warned Evilmoon.

“Fuck, how am I this unlucky?!” cursed Long Chen. Just before entering this place, he had been praying not to encounter a spatial crack.

Long Chen flew away as fast as he could, but the suction force was so great that his speed was impacted. The other lifeforms weren’t as powerful as him and were rapidly sucked into the crack.

Even before those creatures reached the crack, their bodies were torn apart. It was like invisible teeth were rending them asunder. Those broken pieces then vanished into the crack.

Suddenly, one of those lifeforms came rushing over, stabbing its bone spear at Long Chen. It was quite insidious to try to drag Long Chen down right before its death.

Long Chen’s body flickered, dodging its attack. He was currently swimming against the tide. Any blockades could push him past the point of no return.

More and more lifeforms were sucked toward the giant spatial crack, and some of them just so happened to be flying by Long Chen. Those were the ones to unleash crazy attacks.

Fortunately, these strange lifeforms’ attacks were quite primitive, allowing Long Chen to easily dodge them like a fish swimming in water.

Suddenly, an explosive sound rang out ahead of him. The woman in front of him had been struck by an attack, resulting in her speed dropping. She was then struck more and more, with one attack in particular knocking her backward.

With the suction force growing stronger and stronger from the rear, she was greatly impacted. The others from her race had managed to flee to the edge of the suction force and weren’t affected.

As time passed, the suction force grew stronger and stronger. Their shouts toward her were useless. Even Long Chen’s speed was impacted. There were some experts around the same distance as him, but they were unable to escape the pull and were sucked into the spatial crack. Their screams were all cut off in a hair-raising manner.

The woman finally started to be pulled backward, causing the others from her race to cry out. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

When she was sucked back near Long Chen, he grabbed her arm. As a result, his speed, which had been extremely slow, was further impacted.

The woman looked at Long Chen gratefully, and she shouted something that he didn’t understand. He focused on flying forward.

However, because Long Chen was dragging another person behind him, every meter was difficult to progress. The spatial crack was still continuing to grow larger.

There was still a great distance before he could escape the spatial pull. The distant lifeforms wearing beast hides were shouting in a panic. Some of them began taking off their belts and tying them together, forming a long rope that looked quite sturdy.

“Fools.” Seeing their panicked actions, Long Chen cursed. They had tens of thousands of people. Why were they not splitting up into multiple groups to increase their efficiency? If only one person did all the work, how long would it take?

The powerful pull of the spatial crack caused the earth to be sucked inside. Giant boulders flew through the air, unable to resist the pull. Long Chen didn’t even have a place to grab a foothold like this.

He also didn’t dare to summon his lightning wings. If he did, the drag from them might just pull him back in an instant.

“Toss that useless thing aside and you’ll still have a chance of getting away!” shouted Evilmoon.

Long Chen didn’t reply. He now understood that this woman had charged through the battlefield to tell him to leave because she had realized the danger. It was because of him that she was caught this close to the spatial crack. How could he toss her aside now?

Long Chen suddenly tossed the woman forward. She cried out in shock, shooting through the air straight toward the rope that her fellow people had formed.

Those lifeforms were so slow that even with so many people, they hadn’t managed to reach the two of them. If they had been working efficiently, they would have long since managed to reach the two of them.

The woman just barely managed to reach the end of the rope and grab hold of it. Her people immediately pulled, bringing her to safety.

Upon reaching safety, she looked back to see that Long Chen was starting to be pulled backward toward the spatial crack ever so slowly.

She cried out, but there was nothing that she could do. She could only stand there in a panic.

“Fool!”

Evilmoon cursed Long Chen repeatedly, unable to believe him. To save some woman that he didn’t know and might even be an enemy, he had fallen into desperate straits.

“It’s not like that’s a surprise to you. I’ve been a fool for more than one day. Don’t tell me to do things that I can’t do, or it’ll wound our relationship,” said Long Chen.

Wanting Long Chen to abandon someone that was only in trouble because they had wanted to save him was impossible. Back in the day, below the nine springs of the Netherworld, he had saved Xie Qianqian in a similar situation. He was unable to make a different decision now either.

With the suction force growing stronger, he was being pulled back faster and faster. There was no time for those lifeforms to bind a long enough rope for him.

“Let’s see just what a spatial crack is.” Long Chen clenched his teeth and suddenly allowed himself to be pulled back. The startled cries of those lifeforms rang out in his ears.

“Divine ring, battle armor!”

Long Chen’s body became covered in white dragon scales. The power of his astral spaces roared through his body.

When he got close to the spatial cracks, he felt pressure like giant teeth tearing at him. The Heavenly Daos had collapsed here. It was like the jaws of a giant beast were devouring heaven and earth.

Rumbling filled his ears. To resist this invisible pressure, he allowed himself to be like a floating log being sucked into a whirlpool. His skeleton creaked at how immense the pressure was.

“Big brother Long Chen, I can help you block it. This kind of pressure is no problem for me,” said Ling-er.

“For now, I want to experience it personally,” said Long Chen.

“What is there to experience? This spatial crack was created by those lifeforms shattering the core of their ancestral land. They’ve broken the wall between worlds to bring forth the chaotic flow of space. You can think of it as an embankment by the side of a river that someone has now pierced. The chaotic flow of space is pouring in, destroying all life. It’s filled with death energy, and once it has saturated this space, you will be wiped out. Entering the main flow is death. If you want to live, the only way to get out would be to suddenly become a Sovereign. Obviously, that’s a pipe dream for you,” said Evilmoon coldly.

“Death energy?” Long Chen’s eyes suddenly lit up. “Ling-er, I’m going to teach you how to refine the Heart Corroding Bone Rotting Death Spirit Pill. Listen well.”

“We’re refining pills now?” exclaimed Ling-er in shock.

“Yes. But I’ll need to focus on resisting the energy here, so I won’t be able to show you. You’ll just have to listen,” said Long Chen gravely.

“But is there enough time?” asked Ling-er nervously. Evilmoon had just said that they were in a hole within the barrier separating life from the chaotic flow of space. If they were sucked in, then there would be no way to escape.

“Who knows? But we can’t just wait for death. I don’t have any time. I’ll transmit the technique and ingredients…”

Long Chen tossed the medicinal ingredients to Ling-er and then taught her the pill formula.

Right now, he had to focus on stabilizing his body, so he didn’t have time to teach her like before. Fortunately, she had managed to build an alchemy foundation during this time. This Heart Corroding Bone Rotting Death Spirit Pill shouldn’t be outside her abilities.

Long Chen could feel the pressure growing. His body was almost deforming. Within the darkness, he could only see the slightest glimmer of light from the crack. He was unable to hear the cries of those lifeforms.

This was a terrifying darkness. Even Long Chen was no exception; his chest was tight because of nervousness. However, he had no choice but to relax and carefully sense his surroundings.

Just at that moment, the first furnace of pills was finished. But there were only three trash pills and the rest were merely low grade. Long Chen’s heart grew a bit heavy.
