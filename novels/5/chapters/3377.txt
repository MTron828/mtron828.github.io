Chapter 3366 Preparing for Battle

In the Netherworld, there were two methods to expand one’s territory. One was expanding into wild areas that were abandoned by others. The laws in those areas were muddled, and taking over such an area and cleaning up those laws took a great deal of time. Moreover, restoring the laws required one’s core energy.

The other method was far more simple and more violent. That was to directly take the territory of another. By killing the master of a region, it would naturally become your region once you placed your mark on it. As long as you had power, this was the fastest method.

Ming Cangyue also wanted to use this method to strengthen herself, but she found that she was unable to make herself attack the ones surrounding her.

Back then, she felt that it was the interference of the good in her heart. Thus, she expelled that goodness, sending it to the Martial Heaven Continent so it would be dyed black by the evil of humanity. After that, she would take it back.

At that time, her heart would be clear, and she could do anything she wanted without having any misgivings or inner conflict.

But she failed. Her goodness had transformed into Leng Yueyan. The two of them influenced each other but remained separate.

Ming Cangyue’s original plan was to use any means necessary to get stronger, but Leng Yueyan refused. Her principle was that if someone didn’t offend her, she wouldn’t offend them. If someone did offend her, she would rip them out by the roots.

However, she refused to take the initiative in bullying someone. That was her pride that she refused to change.

Feeling helpless, Ming Cangyue agreed to search for wild areas with Leng Yueyan, and the two of them were surprisingly lucky. They actually found a world that automatically repaired its laws as soon as they took control over it, delighting them.

As a result of taking over this world, their cultivation bases rapidly soared. Their subordinates also grew stronger after they took over this territory. However, this also drew the attention of others.

Tuo Ming was one of them, and he was very crafty. He seemed to have a method to watch over things here and actually launched an attack just as Ming Cangyue was attacking the Immortal King realm. If Long Chen hadn’t come in time, he would have succeeded.

Since Tuo Ming was not fighting in his territory, even as a Heaven tier Immortal King, he was blocked by Leng Yueyan who had just advanced to the Immortal King realm.

“Tuo Ming failed this time. Will he spread this news far and wide to draw over other attackers?” asked Long Chen.

“Most likely no. If this news is leaked, we would be destroyed by others, and he wouldn’t gain anything. He has paid so much. He came out with almost all his subordinates and lost them. If he can’t gain anything, he won’t do such a thing,” said Leng Yueyan.

Long Chen nodded. That was reasonable, but he then frowned. “On his own, he definitely won’t dare to return. If he goes against the two of you, he might lose his life. But he is definitely unwilling to give up like this. If everyone was to learn of what was happening here, they would definitely come to attack you. Then he won’t gain anything. If I were him, I would definitely think of some way to quickly gather two or three helpers to devour this place, and then split the profits. Furthermore, they will come quickly. Too late, and this piece of meat will be devoured by others. In other words, we have to hurry and prepare,” said Long Chen gravely.

“There’s nothing for us to prepare. In at most three days, Tuo Ming will return. Even if he only brings another Heaven tier Nether King, Leng Yueyan and I won’t be able to endure. Their subordinates only have to break the Nethergod Tower, and this world will once more become a masterless area. If we don’t control this territory, we won’t be supported by a continuous stream of its energy, and we won’t be able to fight them. I’m simply waiting for Cangyue to stabilize her realm before leaving. We’ll go back to our old home and think of something else,” said Leng Yueyan. She bit her lip, a bit unwilling to leave.

However, there was no way around it. This was the wisest choice. If they did this, at least they would keep their lives and their foundation. However, they would end up back at the starting point. All their efforts during this time would be wasted.

Furthermore, having lost this territory, without the support of the laws that had allowed them to reach their current realm, there was no way that they could maintain their current realms. In at most a year, their realms would fall back down. But there was no way around it.

“Don’t be in a rush. There will definitely be a way.” Long Chen comforted Leng Yueyan as his head rapidly worked.

After working so hard for a territory just for it to be taken away, let alone Leng Yueyan and Ming Cangyue, even Long Chen himself was unable to accept it. He could only accept him taking from others and not others taking from him, and especially not taking from his women’s things.

“Yueyan, take a look at this.” Long Chen took out some sharp arrows with rusty arrowheads. When Leng Yueyan touched them, her expression changed.

“The aura of the Ghost Dao. How did you obtain this thing?”

“I took the rust off of a Ghost Ship and used it to make some arrowheads,” said Long Chen.

Long Chen hadn’t mentioned the Ghost Ship before because Bai Shishi was part of it. He wasn’t such a fool to talk about other women in front of Leng Yueyan. He wasn’t that tired of living yet.

“A Ghost Ship? Tell me, what did you see?” Leng Yueyan’s expression became grave.

Long Chen obediently explained what he had seen. But he didn’t mention Bai Shishi.

“Corpse spirits from ancient times? It’s no wonder that the number of lifeforms in the Netherworld has dropped slightly year after year… So it was done by the Ghost Dao…” Leng Yueyan muttered to herself. But she suddenly shut her mouth.

“Ignore the rest. Is this thing useful?” asked Long Chen.

“It is. This rust contains the power of time. Furthermore, it is the kind of time power that doesn’t exist in the Netherworld. Even an Earth tier Nether King would fall after being shot by one arrow. However, what is more shocking is this shaft. The wood contains a terrifying amount of wood life energy. This kind of wood possesses an immense killing power to the Netherworld’s lifeforms because the Netherworld’s aura contains death qi that is countered by this life energy. If shot by this kind of tough yet flexible wooden arrow, their Nether Qi would be thrown into chaos and they would temporarily lose their combat power,” said Leng Yueyan.

“So even just these arrow shafts are useful?” Long Chen was pleasantly surprised.

“Do you have a lot of them?” Leng Yueyan’s eyes brightened.Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

“I have as many as you want.”

Long Chen took out a piece of wood that was three meters thick and many miles long. Leng Yueyan received it emotionally. The life energy contained within this piece of wood was astonishing. It gave her hope.

Leng Yueyan quickly gave orders. Two Earth tier Immortal Kings carefully brought away the wood. “Turn this divine wood into arrows as quickly as possible. Remember, don’t even waste an inch.”

“There’s no need to worry about waste. We only seek a fast production rate. I have as much of this divine wood as you need. Make them as fast as possible.”

Long Chen waved his hand, taking out dozens of wooden pillars. Even Leng Yueyan, with all her calm indifference, covered her mouth in shock.
