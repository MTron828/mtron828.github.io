Chapter 4568 Nine Death Channel

Long Chen found that they were now in the depths of a thick jungle. The trees were so thick and tall that they blocked the sunlight, turning the world dark.

“There’s mosquitoes!”

Screams echoed through the air as Long Chen and the others found themselves surrounded by giant mosquitoes, each the size of a fist. These insects had an unsettling sheen to their mouthparts, sending shivers down the spines of those who saw them.

What was most astonishing, however, was the presence of the strange runes on them and their ancient aura. With a single glance, it was clear that they belonged to a primordial species.

“Run!” 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

Sensing impending danger, Long Chen led Feng You and the others in a mad dash forward. Without hesitation, they followed Long Chen’s lead, racing forward in a frantic dash.

However, these giant mosquitoes were as quick as lightning, swiftly closing the distance. Some among the group attempted to fend them off by slashing at the insects with their blades.

These blades cut through them, slicing them apart. However, when the blades made contact with their mouthparts, a metallic ringing echoed out.

“AH!”

One unfortunate expert was bitten on the neck and couldn’t hold back a painful scream. However, his cries abruptly ceased as he started to wither rapidly.

Once the mosquito had sucked up his blood, its translucent stomach displayed a sphere of blood within. As this blood circulated through the runes adorning its body, the insect’s aura surged in intensity.

“Long Chen, this is the Nine Death Channel. Once we’re through, we’ll be in the Fantasy Spirit World,” explained Feng You.

Although she knew of the Nine Death Channel and had heard tales of its horrors, witnessing it firsthand made her realize that the stories were quite tame in comparison.

More screams pierced the air in the chaos. Whether human or beast, anyone bitten by these mosquitoes would swiftly succumb, their bodies rapidly withering into lifeless husks.

Seeing this scene, the other experts rushed forward crazily. Unfortunately, there were just too many people here. With some people faster and others slower, things were extremely chaotic here.

Furthermore, the buzzing sound from the mosquitoes came from every direction, akin to ghouls chasing after their lives. Such terror shook their souls badly.

Within this dense jungle, there was only the tiniest bit of light up ahead, clearly marking the exit. All these experts were rushing toward it with all their power.

Just then, a white bone horse pulled a bronze chariot ahead of everyone, trampling countless experts to death in their way.

Those terrifying mosquitoes were helpless against that white bone horse. After all, it had no blood for them to suck.

With the white bone horse at the very front, countless experts followed the wave that it created to charge forward.

“Long Chen, should we follow them?” asked Feng You, her eyes gleaming as she observed the scene.

“I don’t think so,” Long Chen responded. “That fellow in the carriage is very sinister. He definitely isn’t going to let others benefit from him. We’ll go our own way. You lead, and I’ll watch our backs.”

After saying that, Long Chen summoned a sea of fire that enveloped everyone, but the mosquitoes still charged in, ignoring the sea of fire. Luckily, Feng You and the others could still handle them, slashing them apart as they approached.

Long Chen switched through several flames and ultimately summoned his Ice Soul Divine Flame. This chilling flame was finally able to stop these mosquitoes and make them switch targets.

Long Chen and the mixed beast race’s experts were not at the very front. Although Long Chen didn’t know what this Nine Death Channel was, his intuition told him that running at the very front wasn’t necessarily a good thing.

Hence, Long Chen kept a certain distance between them and the vanguard. This was the optimal distance. If something unexpected happened, they would have the time to react.

As Long Chen glanced back, he witnessed a constant stream of experts appearing in the jungle, only to be swiftly attacked by the mosquitoes before they even realized what was going on.

Those mosquitoes seemed endless, gathering even more with time. Yet, an increasing number of individuals were also entering the channel, and everyone pressed forward with all their might. In this moment, survival depended not only on strength but also on sheer luck.

Toward the end, there were no longer many peak experts, so it was difficult for them to form an effective defense against these mosquitoes. Perhaps by the final group of individuals, only ten percent of them would survive the deadly onslaught of the mosquitoes.

Screams and pleas for help continuously echoed out. However, the path of cultivation was simply that cruel. The mosquitoes were everywhere, so there was no way to kill them all. If you wanted to live, you had to hope for others to die for you so you could charge through.

BOOM!

Suddenly, the tranquility of the jungle was shattered as the space ahead erupted into chaos. Countless vines from the trees lashed out, shooting toward everyone with deadly precision.

At the same time, tree roots stretched out like tentacles, ensnaring their prey. The white bone horse at the very front was instantly enveloped by countless vines.

With a loud neigh, the white bone horse blasted through its bindings. Countless runes illuminated it, enveloping it in a protective layer of divine light. Any vines that came into contact with this radiant aura instantly disintegrated into dust.

With it taking the lead, the experts behind it continued to benefit from it. Due to following the bronze chariot, the pressure on them was much weaker than it should have been.

However, these vines were extremely powerful, and others didn’t have that protective divine light. Anyone bound by those vines would be drawn deep into the jungle.

Some people hacked at the vines with their blades, only to find that the vines were both tough and firm. It was extremely hard to cut them. If they failed with the first slash, they wouldn’t have a chance to try again.

When the mixed beast race entered the area of the vine attacks, countless vines pierced through the wall of flames. While they were set ablaze, they continued to attack, trying to ensnare them. These vines were actually capable of resisting the Ice Soul Divine Flame.

However, after passing through the flame, they became extremely brittle. A light touch would shatter them, so they weren’t a threat any longer.

At first, Feng You was extremely tense. Considering the mixed beast race’s overall power, she knew that they were just a second-rate group here.

Even with Feng You present, they weren’t qualified to enter the ranks of the first-rate factions. However, Long Chen had brought them to stand amongst the most powerful factions in their world.

Fortunately, they knew that they lacked power. Without Long Chen’s protection, even if they were the first faction to reach this place, the mosquitoes and vines would have wiped them out.

With Long Chen by their side, they felt secure and grateful for his protection, knowing he was their guardian on this perilous journey.

Feng You looked around and found that the other factions had changed formations or had experts guarding the perimeter to drive off the vines.

Suddenly, an ear-piercing scream shattered the air, and a group of strange monsters emerged. They were not particularly large, resembling monkeys with their long limbs.

However, they were hairless and had strange scales on them. Their featureless faces lacked eyes and only boasted a single large mouth filled with razor-sharp teeth. Sticky saliva dripped from their jaws, adding to their menacing appearance.

Bone spurs were all over their limbs, and they also had sword-like bone protrusions coming out of their spine. It seemed that they had been waiting here a long time. When everyone arrived, they came out of the jungle and pounced.

Suddenly, the white bone horse let out a neigh, and a shocking scene occurred—these monsters shuddered and actually made a path for it.

“Are they on the same side?”

Long Chen’s heart shook. These monsters actually let the bone horse through. However, after letting it through, they collapsed on the experts behind the carriage.

“Fuck, I knew that he wouldn’t be so nice! Now he’s the first one in!” Long Chen cursed.

“Feng You, hold the rear for me! Brothers of the mixed beast race, follow me!” Long Chen shouted and charged forward. His blood-colored saber blazed with light once more.
