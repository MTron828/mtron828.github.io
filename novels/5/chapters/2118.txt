Chapter 2108 Preparing to Deploy

“Good work, little fellow. You really did well.”

After a detailed questioning of what had happened during the gathering, the old man laughed, extremely pleased with Long Chen.

Boss Bao and the others were also very satisfied. So what if those monsters of the ancient era had returned? So what if they had dominated their generations? They could still be slapped in the face by Long Chen.

“Buping and Chang Hao, there’s still some time until your manifestations fully awaken. You should be able to make it in time for the qi flow eruption. At that time, we’ll share some of that action. Hmph, do those geniuses think that this is still their era?” snorted the old man.

“You’re awakening your manifestations so quickly?” Long Chen looked at Bao Buping and Chang Hao with shock.

Chang Hao and Bao Buping immediately became pleased. They were about to speak when they were smacked in the back of their heads by the old man. “Most of the Heaven Splitting Battle Sect’s karmic luck was given to the two of you, and you still haven’t awakened your manifestations. I’d be embarrassed, not pleased!”

Their pleased expressions vanished. Of course they wanted to awaken their manifestations quickly. But everyone did, and it wasn’t as easy as just wanting it.

Long Chen looked at the two of them and saw some Heavenly Dao runes had started to condense deep within their eyes. They probably weren’t far from awakening.

“I’ll give you two pills that will guarantee to awaken your manifestations within ten days,” said Long Chen, handing two cases to the two of them.

“Long Chen, don’t con us. What kind of medicinal pill is so amazing?” Bao Buping questioningly opened the case and jumped in shock.

After the Heavenly Dao energy burst out, flower runes appeared. That pill had jumped out of the case and struck Bao Buping, making him dizzy.

Long Chen reached out and caught the pill before it could flee. Only then did Bao Buping recover. “What kind of pill is this?!” UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

Bao Buping had yet to even hear of an eleventh tier medicinal pill, and he had never imagined that a pill could possess such power. A hundred flowers revolved around Long Chen’s hand, emitting a brilliant light.

In comparison, the old man had more experience. He guessed, “This is an eleventh tier medicinal pill? Where did you get it?”

Long Chen smiled. “If I said that I refined it myself, would you believe me?”

“I wouldn’t.” The old man shook his head. In this declined era, an eleventh tier medicinal pill was already a legend. How could Long Chen refine it himself?

“This is the Hundred Flower Dao Resonation Pill. Find an open place to consume it. The best option would be at the peak of a high mountain. Remember, take off your clothes and point your five hearts toward the sky...”

“What does that mean, point your five hearts toward the sky?” asked Bao Buping hastily.

“It’s your head, your palms, and the soles of your feet. The top of your head is where everything gathers. To put it frankly, you just have to strip naked and lie on your back, pointing your limbs at the sky,” said Long Chen.

The two of them frantically took the pills and ran to use them. Seeing Long Chen actually give away two incomparably precious top grade eleventh tier pills to them, Boss Bao and the others were grateful. This was a true family.

Boss Bao curiously asked, “Why do you have to be naked and take on such a strange posture to consume this pill? Does it help absorb its energy?”

“No, it has nothing to do with the medicinal energy.” Long Chen shook his head.

“Then why did you tell them that?” asked the fourth boss.

“I’ve got nothing better to do!” laughed Long Chen.

Everyone suddenly understood. So it was a con. Thinking of the two of them taking on such a strange posture naked on top of a mountain, they knew that such a sight could not be looked at directly. They laughed.

“Old man, you’re really amazing to break through to the third step so quickly. You’re the true genius.” Long Chen suddenly turned to the old man. He was truly powerful.

“Talented my ass. The only reason I was able to break through was because I’m old and finally managed to put aside many things. Seeing you youngsters growing up finally allows me to relax a bit. I didn’t expect this relaxation to result in me touching the next barrier. I just broke through casually,” said the old man.

“Perhaps working and then relaxing is the best way to cultivate. Slacking off every now and then isn’t bad either,” said Boss Bao.

“Don’t try to make excuses for yourself. You fellows are slacking off every day, not having any feeling of crisis,” scolded the old man.

Boss Bao was embarrassed. Rather than sucking up, he had sucked himself into a trap.

Long Chen smiled. He could understand the old man’s feelings. He was currently the only one holding up the Heaven Splitting Battle Sect. There was no one else beneath him capable of carrying that burden. This pressure was immense.

Although he said that life and death were up to fate, as the leader of this sect, he had to worry about the sect’s survival even if he was fearless when it came to his own life.

If he fell, it might not be long before the Heaven Splitting Battle Sect faded away. That was the situation he wanted to avoid the most.

So the one who was working the hardest within the Heaven Splitting Battle Sect was the old man. Even though he had grown old, he had never given up his efforts to climb to the peak of the Martial Dao.

In comparison, Boss Bao and the others had the old man looking after them and instead placed more pressure on the talented geniuses below them, Chang Hao and Bao Buping.

“Old man, I came here today because I have a certain plan I want to carry out. Originally, I would have needed to prepare many more things, but since you’ve already reached the third step of Netherpassage, I don’t think I need to plan out all those things. I can do it directly,” said Long Chen.

“Fine. Arrange things how you wish, but I don’t need to hear the plan. It’ll just give me a headache. Just give me a call when you want me to fight,” said the old man, not letting Long Chen explain his plan.

“Alright, then just wait for news from me. We’ll do something big,” Long Chen laughed mischievously.

Long Chen then left the Heaven Splitting Battle Sect, returning to the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrows. It just so happened that their leader, Que Yuzhu, was present. Meanwhile, the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow race’s disciples were currently exchanging pointers with the Dragonblood warriors on a martial stage.

Meng Qi had allowed them to learn their lost divine abilities within the Myriad Spirit Diagram. Hence, they had awakened all their terrifying divine abilities.

The talented youngsters of the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow race were now almost a match for the Dragonblood warriors in a one against one battle. When Long Chen arrived, there was an eleventh rank Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow fighting evenly against one of the Dragonblood warriors.

The Dragonblood warriors were all cheering for the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow. After being here for so long, they had found that although the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrows were ancient beasts, their characters were pure.

“Xiao Yu, work hard. Just a bit more and you can beat him!” Long Chen couldn’t help calling out.

Everyone looked over, surprised and happy to see that Long Chen had returned so quickly.

That Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow was Xiao Yu, and Long Chen had even given her some pointers before. She was extremely talented.

The person she was fighting was a squad leader in the Dragonblood Legion. Their battle was exceptionally intense.

Hearing Long Chen’s voice, Xiao Yu let out a cloud-piercing, earth-shattering cry. All her feathers raised, and she opened her mouth. A spiral ripple shot out.

BOOM!

The squad leader was instantly blown away. The funny thing was that he was spinning rapidly and unable to stabilize himself. He landed far outside the martial stage.

Xiao Yu flew over to Long Chen, transforming into a beautiful maiden midway, and hugged him. She excitedly cried, “Big brother Long Chen, I won!”

“Amazing, amazing! This fellow Zhang Kun has definitely been slacking while I wasn’t here.”

“Didn’t we agree not to use this move?”

The squad leader Zhang Kun was a dark-faced fellow. He grumbled helplessly.

This technique was one of the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow race’s ancient divine abilities. It was a terrifying killing technique and was usually accompanied by black swords of light. Despite having held back the killing aspect of this move, it was still capable of twisting space chaotically. It could be activated in just an instant and covered a wide area. Once caught inside, the spatial disorientation would make a person dizzy.

The two of them were just competing, not fighting to the death. There were many divine abilities that the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrows couldn’t use in such a competition.

The Dragonblood warriors also couldn’t bring out their true abilities. After all, their techniques were forged in battles to the death. Their specialty lay in killing, not fighting.

“Long Chen, why are you back so soon? Were you expelled midway?” Meng Qi, Chu Yao, and Tang Wan-er came flying over, delighted. It was Tang Wan-er joking at his expense.

“You once more guessed it right,” said Long Chen speechlessly.

“Really? You were actually expelled?” Tang Wan-er was also surprised.

“Let’s talk about it later. It just so happens that we have to discuss something with you, race leader Yuzhu.”

Long Chen gathered the Dragonblood warriors as well as the higher-ups of the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow race. He gave a simple explanation of what had happened during the gathering.

“The Nine Heavens Divine Phoenix race is very despicable. After losing their own inheritance, they blamed others. Seeing how strong we were, they colluded with the Kunpeng race to persecute us, making us fall from standing at the top of the Xuan Beasts to being hunted down for countless years. This enmity must be avenged,” said one of the elders of the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow race. There was clearly an irreconcilable enmity between the two races.

“The Nine Heavens Divine Phoenix race will have to be left off for now. There’s something much more pressing that we have to do.” Long Chen turned to Xia Chen. “If you used all our resources to create a trap, just how powerful would it be?”
