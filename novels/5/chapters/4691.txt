Chapter 4680 Camouflage

The explosion unleashed not only the power of the halberd but also the combined astral energy of Long Chen and the nine star heir. Its magnitude was truly apocalyptic. The experts who had sought to take advantage of the chaos and launch a sneak attack on Long Chen found themselves directly engulfed by the devastating shockwave.

The immense shockwave blew the land apart, reducing everything to nothing but dust and rubble. Even the experts outside of the tribulation were ruthlessly hurled into the air by its power.

In the aftermath, a heavy silence descended upon the world, and everyone felt like they could hear the mournful cry of the Heavenly Daos.

After that, the sound of violent impacts rang out, accompanied by the sound of something twisting and cracking. They then saw two starry seas crashing together.

“What?!”

When the dust settled, they saw Long Chen and the nine star heir fighting intensely. With every wave of their hands, starry rivers flowed out.

The Sovereign clan expert was gone after transmitting all of his tribulation energy to Long Chen.

BOOM!

The nine star heir’s punch struck Long Chen’s shoulder and shattered his dark red scales, which were unable to endure the nine star heir’s punch. Blood gushed from the wound upon impact.

BANG!

At the same time, Long Chen’s fist struck the nine star heir’s jaw, blasting it apart. However, no blood emerged from the wound; instead, lightning runes erupted forth.

All of a sudden, some lightning dragons devoured those lightning runes before dissipating as if they had never existed.

BOOM!

Long Chen and the nine star heir continued their bloody fight. Every time they clashed, heaven and earth would explode. With how ruthless they both were, blood quickly covered Long Chen’s whole body. After all, the nine star heir was incredibly explosive, and Long Chen couldn’t fully block his attacks.

However, Long Chen was thankful that the Sovereign clan expert had given him all his thunderforce, which had strengthened him immensely. Without the boost, Long Chen wouldn’t be able to stop this nine star heir.

The nine star heir duplicated by the heavenly tribulation wasn’t bound by the laws of the martial stage like before. His aura was absolutely terrifying. Fortunately, Long Chen had already fought with him before, so he was familiar with his moves.

He was confident that he could handle the nine star heir because he knew that the power of the tribulation wasn’t limitless.

The two of them relentlessly attacked each other with ferocious intensity, focusing solely on offense without bothering to defend. They exchanged injuries for injuries, with blood and runes swirling through the air in a chaotic dance.

This battle had forced the other experts within the tribulation back to the outer edge. This battlefield’s main character could only be Long Chen.

At this time, they no longer felt any jealousy over Long Chen, as they were completely shaken by the nine star heir’s terrifying power.

“How can a nine star heir appear in a heavenly tribulation?! Is he a nine star heir as well?!” asked Fallen Daynight’s disciple.

He and Yu Zihao had looked so terrified because of the karma between them and the nine star heirs. Their seniors had warned them that if a nine star heir appeared in their tribulation, it would be a tribulation of death.

The two of them had heard stories of their fellow disciples dying in tribulations. Without exception, all of those disciples had fallen to the hands of the nine star heirs.

That was why they had been so terrified, thinking that this nine star heir had come due to their karma. But unexpectedly, he had come for Long Chen.

After their fear faded, they grew suspicious of Long Chen’s identity. If Long Chen was also from the nine star line, this would be a huge matter.

“I heard that in the High Firmament Academy, Long Chen found a fragment of the Starry River of the Sky Art, and he repaired its broken path step by step. He had completely rebuilt the starry river line’s glory from the ground up. I’ve also heard that the Starry River of the Sky Art was developed from the nine star heir’s cultivation art, but I am not sure whether this karma could summon a nine star heir,” mentioned someone.

“He’s actually summoned a legendary existence, but it’s quite clear that his astral energy is not a match for the nine star heir’s. This is the difference between the original and the fake,” added someone else.

Although Long Chen was fighting well against the nine star heir, they could all see that there was a definite difference between their astral energies. Long Chen was the one at a disadvantage.

“So that’s the case.”

This explanation made Yu Zihao and Fallen Daynight’s disciple relax a bit. If Long Chen really was a nine star heir, this matter would be rather frightening. Fortunately, it was a false alarm. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

Amongst these experts, quite a few of them had done their research. After all, the High Firmament Academy was the world’s number one academy, while Long Chen was the most outstanding member of the High Firmament Academy. It was normal for some of his abilities to be known by outsiders.

With so many experts here, Long Chen intentionally strengthened his starry river manifestation to cover up the signs of the Nine Star Hegemon Body Art. There was a distinct difference between his divine ring and starry sea compared to the nine star heir’s simple seven stars.

Thankfully, strengthening his starry river manifestation didn’t affect his combat power. However, the main issue this time was that the nine star heir was too strong. Even going all-out, Long Chen was barely able to keep up with him.

Fortunately, after losing the halberd, the nine star heir didn’t take out another weapon. Otherwise, Long Chen wouldn’t have been able to keep up for so long.

Even so, the greatest difficulty for Long Chen was that he had to be on guard against sneak attacks from the idiot bastards.

Right now, he could only hold on against the nine star heir. He wasn’t afraid of small injuries because the life energy from the primal chaos space could instantly heal them.

However, once he had a heavy injury, Luo Changsheng and the others would definitely take that chance to attack him together. That was what he was worried about.

As expected, whether it was Luo Changsheng, Yin Jiushang, Netherdragon Tianzhao, Yu Zihao, or the other experts, they looked like they were just watching but had secretly prepared for that moment. When an opportunity presented itself, they would attack.

RUMBLE!

Suddenly, a giant mouth appeared in the sky, and it instantly devoured everyone undergoing the tribulation.

Guo Ran and the others were still fighting the various experts outside the tribulation when they saw that enormous mouth devour everyone in one gulp.

They cried out in shock. “It’s... it’s...!”
