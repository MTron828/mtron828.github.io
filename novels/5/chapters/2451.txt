Chapter 2441 Golden Scale Blue Eye Eagle

Translator: BornToBe

“I wonder if you dare to go see the Life Spirit God,” sneered La Wei. “The Life Spirit God will instantly see through your intentions. So, are you going?”

La Wei still didn’t trust Long Chen. Either he thought he was still an enemy, or he was jealous.

Qi Li glared at him, but La Wei ignored it. Everyone else also wanted to see how Long Chen would respond.

Long Chen took out a small compass, which had a small needle quivering slightly. Long Chen pressed a button on the edge, causing the needle to move in a new direction. After a few more pushes, Long Chen shook his head.

This was something that Guo Ran had made in order to sense the position of the Dragonblood warriors from a great distance.

Due to the dragon blood flowing within their veins, Guo Ran and Xia Chen were able to make this compass capable of sensing their positions.

The compass had pointed in multiple directions indicating that there were groups of Dragonblood warriors in every direction. But the color was still a faint orange, indicating that they were extremely far, about as far as the Eastern Wasteland was from the Western Desert.

On the Martial Heaven Continent, that distance wasn’t too immense. But in the Star Field Divine World, it was unknown just how many dangerous areas separated them.

“What are you hesitating for? Are you afraid? It seems that you are really scheming something against our Luo Spirit race-”

La Wei’s rambling came to a sudden stop. In the instant that Long Chen glanced at him, he felt like a wild beast was glaring at him. His whole body stiffened, and an overwhelming sensation of death made him unable to move.

“Shut your mouth. If it wasn’t for Qi Li, you would be a corpse right now. If I wanted to kill you, not even your leader would be able to protect you,” said Long Chen frostily. In that instant, his killing intent was unleashed. However, this person was Qi Li’s fiance, and there had been a slight misunderstanding between them, so Long Chen was willing to let some things go. But he had pushed Long Chen too far.

“La Wei, you brainless fool, keep your mouth shut. How was I so blind as to fall for you?” cursed Qi Li furiously.

“Long Chen, do you wish to see the Life Spirit God?” asked the race leader.

“Is it very far?”

“If you ride the Cloud Soaring Falcon, you should arrive after one day and night of travel.”

“Then yes, I would like to see them.” Long Chen nodded. One day and night was an acceptable amount of time. If he really could get a good map, it would be worth it.

Without a map, just blindly stumbling around might end with him running into something like the Thorned Devil race again or something even stronger. Other than just wasting time, it could be dangerous.

La Wei shut his mouth. Qi Li snorted and walked over to Long Chen. To the race leader, she said, “Father, let me guide Long Chen to the Life Spirit God.”

The race leader nodded. “You can accompany Long Chen. La Wei, you will be accompanying them as well. It is very far, so look after them.”

“But he-” started Qi Li. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“This is an order!” said the race leader coldly.

Qi Li sniffed and pulled Long Chen away to the rear mountains. Seeing her holding Long Chen’s hand, La Wei ground his teeth.

The race leader suddenly kicked him in the butt, sending him flying over there. “Fool, if you don’t follow, your wife is going to be taken.”

La Wei quickly caught up. At the rear mountains, Long Chen saw an ancient forest thrumming with vitality. It was an extremely peaceful life energy.

There was a giant falcon waiting for them inside. It flew over to Qi Li and cried out happily.

“The Cloud Soaring Falcon is one of our protective spirit beasts. We’ve very close to them. The Cloud Soaring Falcon is extremely fast, and even stronger beasts can’t catch up to us,” explained Qi Li, patting the falcon.

“Isn’t this forest your territory? Why would you encounter stronger beasts?” asked Long Chen.

“This forest is too big. It’s not occupied by just us. You’ll understand later,” said Qi Li.

The two of them jumped onto the falcon’s back. At that moment, La Wei caught up, and he also jumped on.

Qi Li didn’t even glance at him. She and Long Chen stood on the falcon’s head. It let out a cry and soared into the air.

La Wei sat by himself on the falcon’s back, glaring furiously at the two of them.

“How is it? Isn’t the Cloud Soaring Falcon fast?” asked La Wei, unable to hold back.

Long Chen curled his lips. This Cloud Soaring Falcon seemed to be on par with a mid twelfth tier Magical Beast. Its speed was truly not bad for that level, but it was a far cry from Cloud’s speed.

If the two of them were side by side, with a spread of her wings, the Cloud Soaring Eagle would only be able to see her tail for an instant before she vanished from sight.

Let alone Cloud, even compared to Long Chen, as long as he summoned his lightning wings, he could throw it into the distance. This level of speed was nothing extraordinary to him.

“Ignore him. He’s infuriating,” said Qi Li irritably.

Long Chen shook his head. “Actually, I’m quite envious of the two of you.”

“Envious of us? What is there to be envious of?” asked Qi Li curiously.

“I’m envious of how young and carefree you are. You can still have fights and arguments. I can’t. My wives and I don’t even have time to fight. We don’t even have time to talk,” said Long Chen somewhat bitterly.

In the past, Tang Wan-er had often liked to be petty and cause some trouble for him so that he would pay attention to her. But now, all of them were racing against time in order to survive. Nowadays, he felt that having Tang Wan-er tease him a bit was an enormous luxury.

“He is simply a fool, and an infuriating one at that,” said Qi Li, vexed.

“He’s foolish because he cares. I would be even more of a fool than him. His mind goes out the window only because he loves you. If he could stay calm over such a matter, it would mean he didn’t care about you. You should be grateful,” said Long Chen lightly.

“Really?” Qi Li glanced back at the gloomy La Wei.

“I’ve been around the block for a few years. I can tell that it is because he truly loves you. That’s why I let him insult me. Otherwise, I’d have slapped his face into a pig’s head,” said Long Chen.

Qi Li smiled, amused by his way of speaking. However, at that instant, the sky darkened. The Cloud Soaring Falcon let out a sharp cry and dove from the sky and into the forest.

“It’s a Golden Scale Blue Eye Eagle!” shouted La Wei, his voice trembling slightly. “I told you that this fellow would bring us misfortune after falling from that cursed ship. We actually encountered a fully matured Golden Scale Blue Eye Eagle. We’re dead.”

A giant golden eagle descended from the sky. Its feathers were covered in scale-like patterns, and its aura was comparable to a peak twelfth rank Magical Beast.

“We’re not a match for it. Its target is the Cloud Soaring Falcon, so we’ll split up and pounce on it while the Cloud Soaring Falcon draws its attention. Its weak points are its eyes, the bottom of its beak, its abdomen, and… Long Chen, what are you doing?!” Qi Li was in the midst of coming up with a battle plan when Long Chen shot into the sky straight at the eagle.

Suddenly, a square object was flung out by Long Chen. It rapidly grew larger until it was the same size as the eagle and struck it head-on.

The Golden Scale Blue Eye Eagle fell to the ground, smashing a giant hole in it. A wave of earth covered the giant trees.

Qi Li and La Wei were both dumbfounded. The Golden Scale Blue Eye Eagle was a terrifying beast whose speed was even greater than the Cloud Soaring Falcon. Such a terrifying monster was something only their race leader possessed the power to defeat. Their best option would have been to think of a way to somehow get away from it.

However, if they ran, then they would have to sacrifice the Cloud Soaring Falcon. Qi Li was unwilling to do that, so she wanted to take the risk of fighting for a bit. But even then, she was aware that their chances of victory were extremely remote. Their arrows were unable to pierce its defenses.

Now, they saw Long Chen crush it with one attack. La Wei’s jaw dropped. He was filled with disbelief.

The giant cyan brick vanished. The earth shook a few times as the giant eagle struggled out of the earth. It let out a heaven-shaking cry.

“It’s not dead!” Qi Li and La Wei’s expressions changed, and they hastily retreated.
