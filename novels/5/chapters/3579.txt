Chapter 3568

BOOM!

The void exploded. After that, a late stage World King was sent flying back by a saber, coughing up blood.

“Go back and tell your Soaring Dragon Company’s higher-ups to prepare some more inventory. Don’t waste my time as I’m very busy.”

Long Chen unleashed another attack, conveniently hacking apart the treasury that he had just snatched. On his way to the Alldevil Star-Field, he had been thinking of conveniently gathering some more money.

As a result, after plundering three strongholds of the Soaring Dragon Company along the way, the other side was already prepared for Long Chen. He had attacked several of their strongholds and ended up finding nothing. Their treasuries were completely devoid of anything, as the items had been scattered to other smaller locations.

Clearly, the method Long Chen used in the Chaotic Star Sea was no longer effective. There was no way to lock down the news. Because of that, the other side could make their preparations, and now they didn’t even leave a single egg in their baskets.

It wasn’t as if Long Chen had time to hunt down all those scattered treasures. Having come up empty-handed again, Long Chen cursed that late stage World King for not understanding that amiability made you rich and then patted his butt and left.

“Long Chen, just wait! Our Soaring Dragon Company will not let you off!” That late stage World King roared hysterically.

All the city’s people stared at that elder in dumbfounded silence, not knowing what had just taken place. It had happened too quickly for them to even get a look.

Long Chen directly stepped onto a transportation formation and left. This was a figure who dared to plunder the Soaring Dragon Company and beat late stage World Kings. Hence, the guards of the transportation formation didn’t even dare to ask for the fee. Once Long Chen told them where he wanted to go, they directly sent him there.

In just one day, long Chen went through over eighty transportation formations. It had to be known that even a World King would only go through ten a day and definitely not more than twenty.

That was because the spatial laws used in each transportation posed a certain burden on the body. Extreme long-range transportations in particular had an even heavier burden.

A single transportation would take some time to recover from. So, if someone was undergoing multiple transportations, their body wouldn’t have time to recover. As the pressure of the laws layered on top of each other, it would form a Grand Dao wound, which contained the power of the laws. It was very frightening and not easy to recover from. It might even leave behind a sequela.

Even with Long Chen’s physical body, undergoing all of these transportations was starting to get taxing. He had no choice but to rest. In an ancient city, he went to a restaurant to eat and drink.

After so many transportations, finally no one recognized him. When they looked at him, their gazes were different. Some people even viewed him as a fat sheep and seemed to be thinking about attacking him. However, that made Long Chen feel much more at ease.

This city wasn’t big, but it also had a Soaring Dragon Company present. It went without saying that the map from the Huayun Trading Company was very detailed. Long Chen even suspected that the Huayun Trading Company had long since known that he would want to plunder the Soaring Dragon Company, so they marked their positions on the map so clearly.

However, this branch of the Soaring Dragon Company wasn’t big. Long Chen couldn’t even be bothered to plunder it. Even if its treasury hadn’t been emptied, there wouldn’t be anything good inside. It was a waste of time.

Taking out his map and looking at his path, he found that he was already not far from the Alldevil Star-Field. Fortunately, the Violet Flame Heaven was more prosperous than the Darklight Heaven, so there weren’t so many uncivilized territories. Many places had transportation formations that he could go through. Even if there were places that transportation formations couldn’t go to, there were tools to ferry him across.

Although the price was not cheap, it was very convenient. Anyway, Long Chen no longer had any concept of money. Even Long Chen didn’t know how much money he had now.

The primal chaos space had a mountain of treasuries piled up inside it. Long Chen had only checked them briefly. Other than the medicinal ingredients that he urgently needed, he simply tossed the rest aside, not even bothering to take note of them.

All in all, he had dozens of World Domain divine items, but their quality was rather average, simply not on the level of the Phoenix Blood Heavenly Silk Net. With the Minghong Saber in his possession, Long Chen didn’t even look at them.

After the last battle, Long Chen had slain countless experts, so the Minghong Saber had undergone a huge transformation. Even when Long Chen wasn’t doing anything, it could still activate a portion of its runes.

It truly did seem to be a weapon made for Long Chen. It could use his violet qi and reach the point of man and saber being one. Both of them benefited from their seamless cooperation. Other than Evilmoon, this was the most pleasing weapon that Long Chen had ever obtained.

Long Chen, Huo Linger, and the Minghong Saber all benefited immensely from that battle. Huo Linger naturally benefited the most, but the Minghong Saber was still climbing even now. It hadn’t fully digested all the gains from the last battle. As for how much energy it had actually gained, no one knew.

After eating and sprucing up his appearance, Long Chen once more sat through transportation formations. After just three more, he appeared on the edge of the Alldevil Star-Field.

When Long Chen appeared, he saw that countless experts were gathered here, staring vigilantly at the spatial gateway. Long Chen’s arrival didn’t draw anyone’s attention.

When Long Chen got closer, he found that the gateway’s space was layered, forming a roiling channel. It was like a rapid river current. Within this current, it was actually possible to see spatial blades spinning around with the naked eye.

People occasionally entered and left. They entered carefully, but when they came out, they were covered in blood.

“We should just give up. It’s too dangerous. Last time, Luo Ziwen was probably only able to get through due to luck. Even other heavenly geniuses on the same level as him are unable to get through. The spatial channel is filled with too many dangers. The strongest spatial blades can even easily slay World Kings, so it’s impossible for little Divine Lords like us to get through!” A man sighed and shook his head. He was supporting the bloody expert who had just come out.

“But the people inside are in danger! We can’t just give up on them. We need to find a way to communicate with them. There must be a way for us to join forces. Maybe with people from the outside and inside joining forces, we can break through this spatial wall.”

“That’s right, the Alldevil race is guarding the channel and is working in collusion with the devil race. As snakes of the same pit, they might be brewing some sinister scheme to destroy our human race. At this critical time, we cannot give up. If the senior experts are unable to get through, then that leaves it up to us to think of a way.”

Almost everyone at this gateway was a youngster whose cultivation base was at the Divine Lord realm. They were staring worriedly at the channel.

“What are you smiling at?!”

Suddenly, someone in the crowd shouted at Long Chen furiously, seeing Long Chen’s smile as a mocking sneer.

Countless gazes then turned toward Long Chen in anger, as if they were going to teach Long Chen a lesson.

In front of those unfriendly smiles, Long Chen smiled. “I’m smiling because I’m gratified to see that the human race has you, hot-blooded youngsters. Now, I have hope that this world is more beautiful than I thought.”

This response left people dumbfounded. Long Chen seemed to have no malice, but the way he talked like an old man left them feeling displeased.

“Hey-!”

Suddenly, people cried out. They saw Long Chen step into the spatial channel just like that without summoning a manifestation or anything. He vanished from everyone’s sight.

After that, a heaven-shaking explosion erupted. As that spatial channel exploded, a pillar of divine light pierced through the world.
