The lady immediately turned pale with terror. “I didn’t-”

“That’s enough, you win. Your bewitching arts are too great. I admit defeat. Not just you, any female cultivators can pass for free. But just a reminder, don’t try to dress up as a woman to trick me, or I’ll make sure you’ll never be a man again,” warned Long Chen.

This woman actually hadn’t used any bewitching arts against him. She didn’t dare to. But Long Chen found that he couldn’t rob this innocent lady. As for her bewitching arts, it was just an excuse.

The female cultivators were delighted by this news and charged forward.

“Many thanks.”

Some of the women didn’t forget to thank Long Chen as they flew off.

“Thank you.” Only now did the woman from the Nine Tail Demon Fox race react.

“Alright, you can go. I still have more business to take care of!”

Long Chen didn’t say much to her. Although she was beautiful, he already had so many peerless beauties at home.

She looked closely at Long Chen for a moment before leaving. As for Long Chen, he became busy with work again.

“Here’s ten million. Take it!” An ancient race expert tossed a spatial ring to Long Chen.

“Hold it. For you, it’s thirty million.” Long Chen suddenly raised Evilmoon and blocked his path.

“Why?!”

“Because didn’t you say that you had a lot of money? Since you have so much, you have to pay a bit more. Your words before were quite irritating. My heart’s hurt, so I need some more money to heal it,” said Long Chen.

“You... fine, just wait!” That person clenched his teeth and tossed another spatial ring to Long Chen.

This ancient race expert was the one who had said that he had plenty of money but wasn’t giving any to Long Chen. Knowing he had offended Long Chen, he had covered up his face and hidden behind someone at the back, hoping that Long Chen would forget him, but Long Chen had still recognized him.

“Many thanks for your business, boss.”

That person’s malicious gaze made Long Chen smile. Now he understood why the Huayun Sect’s people could always greet others with a smile. They weren’t greeting people, they were greeting the money.

“Many thanks.” Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

“Thank you.”

“It’s my first time, so please forgive me for my inexperience.”

“If you’re dissatisfied with anything, please tell me. I’ll definitely improve things next time.”

Even as he accepted money, Long Chen’s mouth didn’t stop. His words only further enraged people.

“Wow, isn’t this the great hero Xiong Tianba? You’re too big. Your weight will damage the road. You should pay at least thirty times more than others, but since I’ve just opened my business, I’ll give you a discount. You’ll just have to pay fifty million. Please don’t try to bargain with me, I really don’t make enough money to lower my price,” said Long Chen upon seeing Xiong Tianba.

What surprised him was that Xiong Tianba very happily parted with his money. He didn’t say a word as he handed over a spatial ring.

From behind Xiong Tianba came Leng Wufeng. He tossed a spatial ring at Long Chen. “Long Chen, even if you’re getting money now, you won’t be able to spend it.”

Long Chen received it and saw the spirit crystals packed inside. He smiled. “There’s no need for you to worry about it. I was originally thinking of taking a bit more from you, but I know you’ll come find me in the future, so it doesn’t matter how much I take today.”

Long Chen’s meaning was that in any case, Leng Wufeng would come to him either way. Once Long Chen killed him, his money would be his, so it didn’t matter.

“You’re right, Long Chen. I definitely will come to find you. But not right now.” Leng Wufeng snorted and left.

Long Chen sneered. Leng Wufeng wanted to search through the secret realm first instead of wasting time here. The other thing was that in order to challenge Long Chen, Leng Wufeng needed to be in his peak condition. Having been scared away by just a clone, his mental state was not perfect right now. For a clash between two experts, the slightest thing could affect the conclusion. But in any case, there were still plenty of people waiting inside the channel to get through. He was near the front and would be reaching the depths of the secret realm earlier.

“Long Chen, don’t you think you’re going too far? For a bit of money, you’re offending everyone. Many of us are not your enemy, but you’re forcing us,” said Lu Zichuan.

The Yin Yang Sword Sect’s Lu Zichuan, he was a very powerful existence. However, he was normally very low key. Only a few people had ever seen him personally fight, but the rumors said that even Man Batian had been defeated by him.

Long Chen said, “I trust that the majority of you are my enemies. I don’t have the time to differentiate between you, so I’ll only take a bit of money from each of you. If you’re my enemy, taking this money will be right. If you’re not my enemy, I’ll repay this bit of money dozens of times in the future. The entire Martial Heaven Continent knows my character, so stop wasting time. I’m really lacking money right now.”

Long Chen extended a hand, indicating for the other party to shut up and hand over the money. Everyone was busy.

“Alright then. Since you’ve said that, there’s nothing for me to rebut.” Lu Zichuan tossed out a spatial ring.

Long Chen took it. “That’s correct. People with no enmity with me can view this as an investment. As long as I don’t die, this investment will come with a huge payoff, so there’s no need to be resentful. As for my enemies, they have even less reason to be resentful. The fact that I’m not killing them right now is entirely thanks to the few innocent people here. Ten million spirit crystals to survive? Don’t you think that it’s worth it? Or do you feel like your lives aren’t even worth ten million spirit crystals?”

Putting it like this, Long Chen managed to dispel quite a bit of resentment toward him.

“Other than that, I should tell you that your barrier breaking beads don’t have any god energy within them. So if you want to enter the core region, just enter. You’ll know I’m not conning you because once I finish my business here, I’ll also be entering the core region. If you’re afraid, I’ll be giving a demonstration at the time,” said Long Chen.

“That’s impossible!” The experts refused to believe this.

“Don’t believe his bullshit. He’s just trying to get you in trouble. If you enter the core region and don’t follow your promise in the future, you’ll be cursed by the gods. Your future would be ruined, so don’t fall for it!” shouted one of Pill Valley’s disciples from the Flame Divine Palace.

Long Chen merely said, “It’s not bullshit. You can simply use your own eyes. Alright, time is precious, so let’s increase our efficiency. Everyone, hurry up!”

These experts handed over spirit crystals to him one by one. However, a change had occurred inside them. When comparing Long Chen’s reputation with Pill Valley’s reputation, which had recently been ruined, they felt that Long Chen would disdain lying to them about this.

Pill Valley’s true face had been revealed many times now. In fact, just now, to test Long Chen, they had set up an innocent girl. Thinking of Pill Valley’s nature, they wondered just what was truth and what was lies.

Even before Long Chen had said this, many people had suspected the barrier breaking beads’ abilities. When they had received the barrier breaking beads, they had only managed to sense some spatial energy fluctuations coming from within, as well as a trace of some foreign energy. They couldn’t tell what that energy was, but they didn’t think it was god energy. Yet, they also couldn’t be sure about such a thing.

“Pill Valley’s disciples now have to pay double. Don’t cause a fuss. If you want to enter, then pay up! If not, then scram! Otherwise, die!” said Long Chen frostily, looking at that disciple from the Flame Divine Palace.

“Count yourself vicious!” That disciple almost exploded from rage. This secret realm belonged to Pill Valley, but to enter, he had to pay someone else? What kind of reasoning was this? But this unprecedented event in all of history was occurring to him.

He still paid up. Elder Tianqi had already said to avoid conflict with Long Chen if they could. In their eyes, Long Chen was a trapped bird. It was only a matter of time.

Long Chen spent six hours accepting money. The amount he gained made flowers bloom in his eyes. He had never seen so much money.

There were over a million experts, with female cultivators only taking up a tenth of them. He had too many spirit stones to count, as well as other treasures from people who hadn’t had enough spirit crystals to pay. There were medicinal pills, divine items, secret tomes, and all kinds of substitutes.

“This time, I really got rich. Robbing rich people really is the fastest way of getting rich,” thought Long Chen to himself.

After taking the final person’s money, Long Chen cleared his throat, and toward the channel, he said, “That old fellow from Pill Valley who thinks himself so smart, many thanks!”

After saying that, not caring whether or not anyone had heard, he patted his butt and left.
