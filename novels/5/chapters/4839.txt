Chapter 4828 Lu Ziqiong

Hu Yifei’s killing intent surged, but Long Chen’s powerful Spiritual Strength also put him on guard.

Hu Yifei knew that Long Chen was also a peak expert, and it was unlikely for someone of that caliber to have no background. He needed to figure out Long Chen’s identity first.

Before Long Chen could respond, Mo Nian already said, “We’re a funeral company. If you have any needs in this regard, come find us at any time.”

“What nonsense are you talking about?” demanded Hu Yifei.

Seeing that he didn’t understand, Mo Nian calmly explained, “Just from your appearance, I can tell that you’ve been living in peace for too long. However, there is a good saying. ‘Fortune is as unpredictable as the weather, so fortune or calamity may strike at any time.’ If one day, your sect declines and its people die, you can come find us. We have many services, like measuring fengshui, large graveyards, paper dolls, drawing coffins, dressing up filial sons, and crying actors... Well, in any case, whatever you can think of, we have. We even have things that you’d never think about. Our fees are reasonable, and we are top-rate professionals. Our word is worth its weight in primal chaos spirit stone, and we never take advantage—”

“Shut your mouth! Whose sect is declining?!” roared Hu Yifei, finally interrupting Mo Nian, who was actually cursing the Iron Blood Gate to fall.

With a professional demeanor, Mo Nian calmed him down. “Don’t get angry. Even if our business doesn’t work out, our friendship remains. Who can do everything by themselves? Furthermore, after I look at your face[1], I am quite sure that you’ll need us soon.”

“You are courting death!”

Hu Yifei furiously summoned a sword into his hand. In an instant, the temperature plummeted as his sinister killing intent rose.

“Hu Yifei, why has your Iron Blood Gate run over to the eastern gate? Do you think that the Violet Palace Sect does not exist?”

Just then, another group of people came; the guard who had been biased toward Mo Nian was among them. However, they were standing behind a woman.

This woman possessed a striking beauty, yet her countenance was cold and distant, as if a layer of frost coated it. Clad in violet robes with her hair elegantly styled in a high bun, she exuded an unbelievable aura.

Her voice echoed her icy demeanor as she gracefully advanced, drawing attention with every poised step.

“It seems that she should be the Violet Palace Sect’s heavenly genius. Hehe, now it’ll be interesting,” whispered Mo Nian.

“How so?” asked Long Chen.

“Devil Fall City has four noble families, with each guarding the east, south, west, and north sides. The Violet Palace Sect is in charge of the eastern city, while the Iron Blood Gate is in charge of the western city. I’ve long since heard that the two sides don’t have a good relationship. I think I get why the guard from before didn’t take my golden tablet. I think they’re using us for their own interests,” transmitted Mo Nian.

Hearing that, Long Chen also understood. It really did feel like the two of them were being used. The sudden arrival of Hu Yifei and the others suggested that the news of their presence may have been intentionally leaked by the Violet Palace Sect.

Long Chen and Mo Nian exchanged a look, not expecting people to have set their sights on them. Now, things would get interesting.

Hu Yifei responded, “Lu Ziqiong, your Violet Palace Sect was the first to break the rules and act biased toward others. You’ve completely taken advantage of your position. These two—”

Lu Ziqiong directly interrupted him, “Shut your mouth. My Violet Palace Sect’s affairs don’t require the judgment of others. If you don’t like it, you can file a complaint at the Devil Fall Department. They’ll decide who is right or wrong. If you keep barking like a wild dog in my Violet Palace Sect’s territory, it will make others think that we can’t control our own land.”

Long Chen and Mo Nian immediately clapped at her response. Mo Nian praised her, “Well said! His appearance really is like a wild dog. Your words are perfectly spot on.”

Long Chen added, “The barking also adds vivid imagery to it, letting people get a deeper sense of their image. Truly admirable.”

Long Chen and Mo Nian played off each other, causing the icy Lu Ziqiong to glance their way. The guards behind her bit their lips, holding back their laughter.

Yu Tong and Yu Fei had never encountered such a situation before. Long Chen and Mo Nian’s expressions were extremely exaggerated, so who could hold back their laughter? Yet, they also couldn’t laugh. They then covered their faces.

On the other hand, Hu Yifei didn’t feel like laughing, his face dark with rage as he clenched his fists. Moreover, his sword was shaking as if it was going through an epileptic fit.

“Is he going to bite someone?” asked Mo Nian worriedly.

“Scram!”

Hu Yifei’s roar was like rolling thunder.

“How smelly.”

Long Chen and Mo Nian both pinched their noses at almost the same time, fanning the air with their hands.

“His mouth smells worse than athlete’s foot,” said Long Chen.

When Hu Fei heard this, the ground beneath his feet shattered. He almost went berserk, but the little trace of rationality in him kept him from attacking.

“Lu Ziqiong, by protecting them, you are breaking the rules of Devil Fall City. I will definitely report this to the Devil Fall Department. However, let’s put aside today’s matter for now. I, Hu Yifei, formally challenge you to a battle. Do you dare to accept?” Hu Yifei took out a tablet.

When this tablet appeared, startled cries rang out as it was covered in golden marks—a Golden Devil Fall Tablet.

According to the rules of Devil Fall City, it was forbidden to fight within the city. If there were irreconcilable differences, they could initiate a martial challenge and resolve their grudges on the martial stage.

“As you wish.” Lu Ziqiong snorted and waved her hand, sending a streak of golden light flying.

“Another Golden Devil Fall Tablet!” Startled cries rang out. Plus Mo Nian’s, three of those legendary Golden Devil Fall Tablets had appeared today.

“They’re all such monsters?” Long Chen’s eyes almost popped out of their sockets. He could accept Mo Nian being able to kill a Heaven Saint devil creature, but for these two to be able to do the same, he felt extremely unwilling to accept it.

“It’s not that big of a deal,” whispered Mo Nian.

“What?”

“It’s true that they killed a Heaven Saint devil creature alone, but who said that it needed to be done in a frontal clash?” prompted Mo Nian.

“Are you saying...” Long Chen’s jaw dropped.

“Poison, formations, sneak attacks—any of those are possible options. You can also wait for a chance to attack. For example, waiting for them to give birth or... hehe,” explained Mo Nian.

“Damn.” Hearing this, Long Chen instantly felt much better. He had actually been thinking that he was a frog at the bottom of a well, but Mo Nian’s explanation cleared things up.

Just then, those two golden tablets met, and an emotionless voice rang out. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

“The battle will be in six hours on the thirty-seventh martial stage.”
