Chapter 1567 Killing Hu Xiaolin

Translator: BornToBe

Five stars revolved in Long Chen’s eyes. They were the same stars as the ones behind him. The stars were burning, causing his power and speed to reach an unbelievable level.

He appeared in front of Hu Xiaolin with such speed that no one could track him with their eyes. The reason Long Chen had chosen Hu Xiaolin as his target wasn’t because he hated him in particular. It was just that he was very large, making him the most obvious target.

Hu Xiaolin hastily blocked with his bone claw. However, he was now weakened from his previous attack. He couldn’t bear Long Chen’s power.

When Long Chen’s saber landed, the bone claw was fine, but Long Chen’s force was so great that he made the bone claw smash into Hu Xiaolin’s head, causing his head to explode.

A large figure flew out of Hu Xiaolin’s head. It was something around the size of a house, and there was a pair of black wings on it as it fled.

That was Hu Xiaolin’s crystal core. The Xuan Beasts were different from humans. Humans passed down their abilities through teaching and learning. On the other hand, the Xuan Beasts passed down their inheritances through their bloodlines and crystal cores.

As for the Yuan Spirits, the humans kept them in their mind-sea, but the Xuan Beasts had their Yuan Spirits in their crystal core. The Xuan Beasts might be number one in terms of physical power, but their souls were very weak. That was part of the Heavenly Daos. If you had the strongest point, you also had to have the weakest point.

As for the Xuan Beasts’ weakest point, it was their Yuan Spirits. Once Hu Xiaolin’s body was destroyed, his Yuan Spirit fled with his crystal core.

However, Long Chen gave him no chance. Evilmoon slashed down mercilessly, instantly shattering the crystal core. Hu Xiaolin’s Yuan Spirit was destroyed.

All the experts felt their hearts shake. A genius of the terrifying Xuan Beasts had just fallen. The Xuan Beasts were probably about to go crazy. Long Chen was truly brazen.

Once Hu Xiaolin died, the white bone claw transformed into a ray of light that vanished from the battlefield.

As for Long Chen, he was already moving on toward the Corrupt path’s Jin Mingwei. Evilmoon was raised high into the air.

Jin Mingwei had long since lost his initial arrogance. He was terrified. “Corrupt Master, save me!”

Due to losing so much essence blood, Jin Mingwei’s power had sharply fallen. He couldn’t receive a single blow from Long Chen.

At this moment, an elder with dark blotches covering his face rapidly formed hand seals with his withered hands. The blood gourd’s runes lit up. It grew and appeared in front of Jin Mingwei, blocking Long Chen.

This was clearly a Life Star expert from the Corrupt path, the real controller of the blood gourd.

BOOM!

Long Chen’s saber landed heavily on the gourd. This time, Evilmoon’s black runes also lit up. Two divine powers clashed.

The gourd was sent flying, while Long Chen was also forced back. If a Soul Transformation expert could unleash one-hundredth of the divine item’s power, then a Life Star expert could wield ten percent of its power.

As for this particular elder, his aura was extremely powerful. There was a trace of Death Qi swirling around him. He was already half a step into a higher realm, allowing him to unleash almost thirty percent of his divine item’s power.

Even with his five stars fully activated, Long Chen was forced back. However, the shockwaves from a clash of two powerful divine items blew apart Jin Mingwei’s physical body. Only his Yuan Spirit escaped.

“Long Chen, not even death can wipe away your crimes! Today, you must be executed to remove a scourge from the Eastern Xuan Region!”

The Flame Divine Palace’s master appeared, flying toward Long Chen. The golden furnace rapidly grew and smashed at Long Chen.

“You’re the parasite of the continent. I should be the one removing you.”

Long Chen slashed Evilmoon at the golden furnace. Long Chen was once more knocked back, but the palace master also shook, almost coughing up blood. However, he forcibly swallowed it back down to maintain his dignity.

“Long Chen, you goddamn bastard, hand over my son’s life!” shouted an expert from the ancient family alliance. Long Chen recognized him as the patriarch of the Sha family. Long Chen sneered and slashed his saber.

The Sha family’s patriarch’s divine item exploded. Without the slightest resistance, he exploded into blood mist.

Evilmoon was now unleashing its divine power, and quasi divine items were not able to stop it. Adding on Long Chen’s current power with the Five Star Battle Armor, his power surpassed everyone’s expectations. Even with a divine item, the Sha family patriarch was slain in one move.

The palace master and the Corrupt path’s elder were both shocked. Long Chen was much more terrifying than they had ever imagined. They had to kill him with their full power.

Even with two powerful divine items, they were unable to defeat him.

“Those with divine items, unleash long-range attacks!” shouted Yan Weishan while hiding in the crowd. He couldn’t help being enraged and jealous upon seeing Long Chen still able to remain undefeated against these two powerful experts.

Over ten experts attacked at the same time. Divine light shot toward Long Chen, enveloping him.

Long Chen crazily slashed Evilmoon out, forcing back the golden furnace and blood gourd. Each collision caused cracks to appear on his body, but they were instantly healed by the primal chaos bead.

Each collision was a clash of divine power. His own power wasn’t even needed. He just needed to make sure his body didn’t break down.

“Long Chen, this is no good. That furnace is too powerful, and my power is limited. Think of some way of conning the gourd. That gourd will be very useful to me,” said Evilmoon.

Long Chen had said that his Five Star Battle Armor could only be maintained for at most ten breaths’ time. Now, it had already been five breaths. In a bit, all his power would be exhausted by the Five Star Battle Armor.

“Fuck, these bastards don’t know when to stop! There are so many of them. What am I supposed to do?!” raged Long Chen. As he focused on blocking the attacks of the two powerful divine items, he also had to block the sneak attacks of the other experts. He was already at his limit. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

“Guo Ran, help me handle that damn old bearded bastard!” shouted Long Chen. He forced back the blood gourd and then charged into the crowd, ignoring the Flame Divine Palace’s master. These experts were constantly disturbing him like flies.

“Finally, some work! Brothers, execute the plan!” shouted Guo Ran. Standing at the front of the Dragonblood Legion, Gu Yang, Li Qi, and Song Mingyuan all pressed their hands on Guo Ran’s back. Following that, each of the Dragonblood warriors pressed their hands on the warrior in front of them.

The power of over twelve thousand warriors gathered. Their armor began to shine, and their energy flowed toward Guo Ran.

Guo Ran crossed his sabers. He pointed them at the palace master who was about to send the golden furnace at Long Chen.

“Dragonblood Cross Slash!”

All the Dragonblood Legion’s armor bloomed with light. A huge cross shot out of Guo Ran’s sabers, whistling through the air.

Back when Guo Ran had forged their sets of armor, he had imagined a peerless attack made by concentrating everyone’s power. After countless tests and going through it with Long Chen, he had finally succeeded. This was their first time unleashing it in front of others.

The palace master who was just about to chase after Long Chen suddenly felt a sensation of mortal danger fill him. He shivered.

When he saw that huge, deadly cross shooting toward him, he jumped in fright. That attack was so terrifying that he could feel his death coming.

He suddenly spat a mouthful of blood onto the golden furnace, and it grew to the size of a mountain.

BOOM!

The huge cross slammed into the golden furnace, and a huge explosion that caused the world to lose all sound occurred. The golden furnace was sent flying, while the palace master shook violently and coughed up blood, flying into the distance along with the golden furnace.

All the experts present were shocked. They had never imagined that the Dragonblood Legion would possess such a move.

Fortunately, the golden furnace that the palace master possessed was no ordinary divine item. Otherwise, it would have been difficult for him to escape his death.

The Dragonblood warriors took a deep breath. All their faces were a bit pale. That one attack had sucked away the majority of their energy.

This one attack contained the energy of over twelve thousand Dragonblood warriors. Although it didn’t contain any divine power, it had reached the strength of divine power. The only regretful thing was that the golden furnace was too powerful. The palace master only suffered a slight injury.

However, Long Chen was now running free amongst the crowd. Huge saber-mages were flying through the air.

“Split the Heavens 5!”

It was unknown how many Life Star experts were slain by just this one attack. Even six divine items were shattered.

Long Chen raised his saber again, preparing to unleash another attack, but just at that moment, a huge blood gourd stealthily approached him from behind. At some unknown point, its lid had popped open.

Its opening was like a gaping maw, and it formed a wild whirlpool. Long Chen turned back to look.

“Blood Devours the Heavens!”

The Corrupt expert sneered, and he slammed a rune, which he had drawn with blood in his hand, onto the gourd.

Long Chen didn’t resist. He was directly swallowed into the blood furnace.
