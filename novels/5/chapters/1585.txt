Chapter 1580 Wilde’s Transformation

Translator: BornToBe

The celebration was just a simple one. After all, celebrating now wasn’t very suitable because the Xuantian Dao Sect had no walls. Other than the main peak, the surroundings were desolate, and it wasn’t very comfortable.

Long Chen also only intended to do this as a formality. After all, many of the disciples that had joined had joined because of him. He drank a bowl of wine with every disciple, agreeing to have a proper celebration once the sect was rebuilt.

To be able to drink wine and even personally touch bowls to Long Chen made these disciples extremely moved. After drinking a bowl with every disciple, he had Guo Ran take his place. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

Guo Ran liked showing off and being the center of attention the most. Fortunately, this wine was ordinary wine, or Guo Ran would have collapsed from drinking all of it.

Long Chen returned to the Xuantian Tower and could see the other Elders busily working. The Tower Department Head was in the midst of designing the rebuilding plan of the Xuantian Dao Sect.

As for the old Xuan Master and Li Tianxuan, they were sitting in front of the Xuantian Tower, drinking some tea. Looking at the disciples celebrating down below, they were filled with emotion.

After recruiting a large batch of disciples, any sect would have trouble managing them. That was because each genius thought highly of themselves. That resulted in a competition between them once they joined the sect to see who was really the strongest. They all wanted that position.

Practically, all sects would let them fight amongst themselves. That made it easier for them to see the potential and specialties of their disciples. Some sects would even encourage this fighting.

However, in a fight against tigers, there would have to be injuries. If there were too many, things would grow out of control. If this many geniuses joined any other sect, they would definitely fight day and night.

However, they were all obedient upon joining the Xuantian Dao Sect. They were even humble and amicable. That wasn’t because their characters were simply like that, but because the Xuantian Dao Sect had a monster like Long Chen.

Any genius would lose their qualifications to be arrogant in front of Long Chen, so seeing Long Chen personally welcoming them, taking the initiative to drink with them without the slightest arrogance or airs, they would be idiots if they dared to be arrogant. If even such a figure wasn’t arrogant, then they couldn’t be.

So even though this many geniuses had joined at once, the Xuantian Dao Sect wasn’t thrown into chaos at all. Everything was being done peacefully.

“Come and sit. You must be tired. Have some tea.” Li Tianxuan indicated for Long Chen to sit, grabbing the teapot.

However, Long Chen was one step faster, taking the teapot and filling the old Xuan Master and Li Tianxuan’s cups first before pouring his own.

The tea was emerald green and a bit thick, but it had no fragrance. It was a top grade tea, with all its flavor concentrated within.

Long Chen drank a mouthful, but he didn’t know anything about tea, so he didn’t feel anything in particular.

“I feel like an unlucky star. Wherever I go, things get thrown into chaos. It was the same in the Eastern Wasteland’s branch sect.” Long Chen bitterly smiled.

Back then, the Eastern Wasteland’s branch sect had also been destroyed because of him. He had spent a huge sum to rebuild it.

Now that he had come to the Central Plains, it was just a few years before he caused even the main sect to be destroyed. This bad luck seemed to strike everyone around him.

“You can’t put it that way. Until the end, no one can tell whether something is good or bad. All you see is part of the process, not necessarily the result,” comforted Li Tianxuan.

He knew more about Long Chen’s situation than anyone else. However, there were some things that he definitely couldn’t tell Long Chen.

However, every time he thought of the final ending of all Heaven-Defiers, Li Tianxuan felt pain. There was nothing he could do about that. People cultivated to do as they pleased. They would rather be a firework exploding with light than a sad speck of dust.

“Xuan Master, has Wilde awoken?” asked Long Chen suddenly. He was very curious why he didn’t see Wilde anywhere.

“Ah, that’s right! Come with me!” Li Tianxuan led Long Chen and the old Xuan Master into the Xuantian Tower. Wilde was sleeping inside a pool.

This pool was originally composed of the Alldevil monster’s essence blood, but it had now been fully absorbed by Wilde. Wilde had grown even larger now. He had surpassed six meters in height and was even larger than Hu Xiaolin.

His entire body was now covered in silver lines. They looked like thousands of silver serpents swimming across his body. Those lines seemed to be alive.

What shocked Long Chen the most was that Wilde now had two horns on his head that were bent slightly like a bull’s. Rather than pointing outward, they pointed upward.

Wilde’s mouth was bulging slightly, and two fangs were protruding out of it. Wilde no longer looked simple and pure like before. He looked like a giant monster.

“What’s going on?” Long Chen was shocked, almost unable to believe that this was Wilde.

The old Xuan Master said, “The Barbarian race exists only in legend. They have many sub-races, but there aren’t any detailed records of what those are. No one can say for sure what’s going on with Wilde. However, Long Chen, you have to be careful. If you can’t control Wilde, he will...”

The old Xuan Master closed his mouth at that point. His meaning was clear. Perhaps once Wilde awoke, he would no longer be the old Wilde.

“That won’t happen. Wilde will always be Wilde. You’ll know once he’s awake.” Long Chen shook his head confidently.

Long Chen tried to touch Wilde, but just as his hand touched the silver lines, they seemed to grow angry and gather together, forcing his hand back.

“These lines seemed to have their own life. The curious thing is they refuse others to see what’s going on,” said Li Tianxuan. He had also tried to investigate what was happening with Wilde, but had been refused by the silver lines.

“It’s fine. Wilde’s slowly awakening. It shouldn’t be too long now.” Long Chen smiled slightly.

No matter what appearance Wilde took, he would always be his brother. This was something he was absolutely confident in.

The old Xuan Master and Li Tianxuan didn’t say anything. They walked out of the Xuantian Tower. Just at that moment, an Elder ran over.

“Reporting to the patriarch and the Xuan Master, someone’s sent a letter, saying it’s for Long Chen.”

“Oh? Who was it?” asked Long Chen.

“They already left. It was a young man. I couldn’t see through his cultivation base,” replied the Elder.

Long Chen was curious. Who would send him a letter without revealing their identity? He opened the letter, seeing a blueprint inside.

“What is this?” Long Chen was dumbfounded by the mess of lines he saw.

“It’s a formation diagram!” exclaimed Li Tianxuan.

Long Chen knew nothing about formations, but Li Tianxuan was more erudite. He immediately identified it as a formation diagram.

“Oh? Xia Chen? So it was him.” Seeing a name written on it, Long Chen came to an understanding.

It was no wonder this formation had come so suddenly. It seemed everything had been done by Xia Chen. Long Chen had heard of him.

After the battle of the Four Nations Ancient Remnant, there was an expert who had gone to get revenge against the Grand Han. He had killed most members of the imperial family and even used a terrifying formation to escape. At that time, Xia Chen’s name had shaken the Grand Han.

Xia Yuyang had said that Xia Chen came from a branch of the Xia family and had some of the imperial family’s bloodline.

Long Chen thought of what had happened with the sudden barrier that had appeared during the Dragon Slaughtering Convention. He recalled Peng Wansheng’s surprised shouting. Peng Wansheng had died in the chaos. It seemed he had been killed by Liu Ruyan, but when Long Chen asked her about it, she ignored him.

However, Peng Wansheng had revealed that the formation had been laid down by a formation expert Sha Guangyan had invited. Now that he thought about it, that formation expert was most likely Xia Chen.

Xia Chen truly was a genius. Last time, he had almost eliminated the Grand Han’s imperial family, leaving behind only two Life Star experts that had tried to kill him.

Perhaps it was because of that loss that the two remaining experts had summoned back the outer members of the imperial family and started to act so crazy.

Last time, Xia Chen had given them a heavy blow. This time, Xia Chen had used some unknown method to win Sha Guangyan’s trust and establish such a huge formation that sucked away all the Grand Han’s dragon vein energy. It was no wonder that the barrier had been able to block the attacks of divine items. It actually had such a high cost. That cost had been paid by the Grand Han.

Now, Xia Chen had sent someone with this formation diagram. He clearly wanted to help Long Chen.

“Xuan Master, how is this formation?” asked Long Chen.

Li Tianxuan and the old Xuan Master were silent for a long time as they examined the formation diagram. In the end, they both shook their heads.

Li Tianxuan sighed, “This formation seems to be an ancient formation capable of both great offense and defense. The most powerful aspect of it is that its core can actually be a divine item. If that divine item was used to control the formation, its power would be unimaginable. However... the cost of it is also terrifying. With our current wealth and manpower, even if we were to bankrupt ourselves, we would only be able to construct a hundredth of this formation.”

“That... that’s a ridiculous cost!” exclaimed Long Chen.

Just at this moment, an Elder came with another report. “Xuan Master, Pill Valley has sent an envoy that wishes to see you.”

“Nice, someone’s come to give us money. Xuan Master, leave this to me.” Long Chen’s eyes brightened, and he smiled mischievously.
