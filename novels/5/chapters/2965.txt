Chapter 2954 Asking for Humiliation

Luo Qingyang had come with some disciples of the Luo Alliance, and his expression was extremely dark. He had tried to advise Luo Bing against establishing her guild many times, but she still went through with it, infuriating him. He then tried to come to an agreement with her, but she refused to give him any chance.

“Bing-er, stop it. If our Luo Alliance splits up of its own accord, it will only give Chu Yang an opening. For an outsider, you are throwing our disciples’ lives in danger. Can you please grow up a bit?” asked Luo Qingyang. When he spotted Long Chen present, despite knowing that Long Chen would be here, he was still enraged. He intentionally acted like he didn’t see Long Chen.

Luo Bing had anticipated that Luo Qingyang would come and wouldn’t be celebrating, but she hadn’t expected him to immediately start off lashing out.

“Haha, so you actually know about the family’s safety? A petty little person like you? Do you not know what you did? Now you want to talk about maturity with me? Alliance head Luo, today is a day for celebrating the establishment of the Luo Gate. I don’t want to fight with you here. If you came to offer a gift, I’m endlessly grateful. If you came to argue, then sorry, I’d like to ask you to leave,” said Luo Bing coldly.

“You…” Luo Qingyang’s expression was extremely ugly. Actually, on his way here, he had decided to talk to Luo Bing calmly and measuredly. However, as soon as he saw Long Chen, he couldn’t suppress his anger.

One of the men beside Luo Qingyang suddenly said, “Junior apprentice-sister Bing-er, I know your character. I believe that you are aware of senior apprentice-brother Qingyang’s feelings toward you. But now is not the time to discuss romantic feelings. You can’t let such a thing throw the family’s disciples in danger. That would be too childish.”

This disciple was also one of the Luo family’s disciples, and he was older than Luo Bing. He had witnessed Luo Bing and Luo Qingyang’s falling out, so he and the other disciples of the Luo Alliance felt helpless.

“Senior apprentice-brother Qifeng, you’ve known me for many years. When have you seen me be willful? The reason I established the Luo Gate is entirely for the Luo family. If you understand, then you understand. If you don’t understand, I won’t bother explaining,” said Luo Bing.

That senior apprentice-brother Qifeng nodded. “I believe you. You’ve always done things steadily. Even the Elders in the family praise you for your leadership capabilities. I don’t doubt your motives. It’s just that if this continues, the Luo family’s power will be split in two. Won’t that just cause pain to our family?”

“I have no other choice. There is no resolving some matters,” said Luo Bing.

“Just because of him!? Is this pretty little boy worth betraying the Luo family?!” raged Luo Qingyang.

This one shout drew countless gazes. Luo Bing, Luo Ning, and the others’ expressions grew exceedingly ugly. Luo Qingyang was an idiot.

“Senior apprentice-brother Qingyang!”

Even Luo Qifeng couldn’t endure it as these words went too far. This was only making the situation worse. Luo Bing would only look down on him more. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Originally, he had discussed this with Luo Qingyang and agreed that if Luo Bing was set on establishing the Luo Gate, then they should settle for the next best thing. They would be allies, with the Luo Gate being one of the Luo Alliance’s subordinates.

Considering that the Luo Gate was newly founded, it had no foundation, so it was in urgent need of many resources. As one of the top ten guilds, the Luo Alliance could provide these resources and allow Luo Bing to grow. Even though they were two different guilds, they would still be one family, so it wasn’t such a problem.

However, Luo Qingyang couldn’t contain his rage and actually said such classless words, vexing Luo Qifeng.

Even Long Chen frowned. This fellow, did he have crap for brains? He actually said such foolish words. Long Chen had an urge to slap him to death.

“Bing-er, senior apprentice-brother Qingyang is rambling. Let me apologize.” Luo Qifeng cupped his fists to Luo Bing and Long Chen. “We didn’t come to ruin things. We just want…”

“No need to say anything. Using the Elder’s badge, I order you and everyone in the Luo Gate to return to the Luo Alliance!” Luo Qingyang suddenly took out a violet badge. There were many lines covering it, and bloodline fluctuations were even coming from it. It was clearly no ordinary object.

“Senior apprentice-brother Qingyang, what are you doing?!” Luo Qifeng was finally enraged.

Luo Qingyang was actually using the family’s Elder’s badge to directly suppress Luo Bing, forcing her to submit. At this moment, this situation had truly reached a breaking point. There was no recovering after this. Luo Qingyang had gone crazy.

However, Luo Bing suddenly sneered and extended her own hand, revealing another badge. When Luo Qingyang saw that badge, his expression completely changed. The Luo family’s disciples then cried out in shock.

“The family head’s badge!”

This was the highest level badge of the Luo family. They couldn’t believe that she had it.

“Impossible!” raged Luo Qingyang.

“The Luo family’s badges all have bloodline auras to differentiate them. There’s no faking it. Are you doubting the family head?” mocked Luo Ning. Before this, she had not disliked this senior apprentice-brother Luo Qingyang, but for him to act so crazily because of her big sister, she now detested him.

The Luo family’s important disciples all had their own badges, but those badges were pure white. Mostly, they were only used for transmitting important news.

The Luo family had special means to communicate with their bloodline. Even from millions of miles away, these badges were like beacons. As long as they were within the range of the Luo family’s bloodline altars, information could be passed from an enormous distance in just a few hours.

After Long Chen had helped her awaken her bloodline power back then, she immediately sent words to the family. The very next day, her badge was bestowed with the family head’s bloodline brilliance, so it could be seen just how important the family head viewed this matter.

At that time, she had yet to join the inner academy and wasn’t aware that Luo Qingyang would be like this. The information on the badge was simple: the family would quickly send someone over.

As for the bloodline aura of the badge, it had yet to fade after all this time. That signified that the family was allowing her to use all the family’s resources if it could increase her chance of obtaining more opportunities to awaken their disciples’ bloodlines. Most likely, they were afraid of Long Chen dying and missing out on this chance. This was a matter that could decide the Luo family’s rise or fall, so they didn’t dare to be careless.

With the family head’s support, Luo Bing naturally wasn’t afraid of Luo Qingyang. However, she hadn’t wanted to use it on Luo Qingyang, as that would open hostilities between them. There was no need for fellow members of the Luo family to go so far against each other.

However, she was disappointed. She hadn’t expected Luo Qingyang to ignore her wishes to such an extent. He had forced her to take it out.

Luo Qingyang was instantly dumbfounded. His head was blank as he looked at the family head’s badge.

Just at this moment, clapping sounds rang out. Chu Yang was walking over with a group of people.

“Dogs biting dogs. The Luo family’s fighting really is marvelous. Even the family head’s badge was taken out. As an old friend of the Luo family, my Chu Alliance can’t come empty-handed on such an auspicious day. I hope you won’t mind this little gift.”

After that, someone behind Chu Yang tossed out a certain object. Even Long Chen clenched his fists when he saw it. It was a coffin.
