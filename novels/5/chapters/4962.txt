Long Ziwei’s expression darkened, as if he had an immense enmity with Long Chen.

“As I am at the ninth Heavenstage and you are only at the third, I won’t bully you. I will suppress my cultivation base to the third Heavenstage to fight you. Let’s decide life and death on even grounds.”

“Why?” asked Long Chen.

“They said you are stronger than me, and I refuse to believe it,” answered Long Ziwei coldly.

“Who are they?” asked Long Chen.

“Naturally, it’s those annoying old fellows. When they came back, they claimed I wasn’t a match for you. I trained bitterly and managed to comprehend an ancient secret art: the Heavenly Dragon Attack. Yet, they still insisted I wasn’t a match for you.

“I risked my life, killing my way into the devil sea, where I slaughtered a Nine Wing Devil Dragon. I consumed its Neidan, awakening the Nine Heaven Battling Wings. Despite this, they still said I wasn’t a match for you.

“Now, having undergone the baptism of the Heavenly Fate Divine Pool and awakened my Heavenly Fate Ring, those old fogeys still deny my prowess. Tell me, where is the justice?!

“Now that you’re here today, I’ll show those blind fogeys that it’s you who isn’t a match for me!”

Long Ziwei’s voice gradually escalated into a furious roar, his emotions causing his voice to grow hoarse toward the end.

On the other hand, Long Chen was stunned. How could he have made a new enemy without doing anything? Was the Long clan intentionally trying to provoke their disciples using him?

The only one who had seen his true power was the Heaven Overseer. Could he be the “old fogey” Long Ziwei was referring to?

“Now you understand, right? Today, I’ll knock your teeth out to show that I, Long Ziwei, am the strongest!” roared Long Ziwei, his aura erupting.

“If you want to be the strongest, why not challenge the rank one on the Heaven Rankings?” asked Long Chen curiously.

Long Ziwei’s expression immediately turned to stone at the question, his raging fighting spirit and anger extinguished in an instant. An eerie silence permeated the atmosphere, broken only by the silent passage of a group of crows.

“I’m talking about us! Why bring others into it?! I’m definitely going to beat you today!” shouted Long Ziwei, breaking the silence.

Long Chen calmly said, “Alright, I admit defeat.”𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

Long Ziwei roared, “No way, I have to defeat you openly and grandly, and you must face me with your full power! Bring out your courage to fight until you die or I die!”

Long Chen helplessly shrugged and retorted, “But if that happens, you won’t be able to win.”

Long Ziwei almost coughed up blood at Long Chen’s response. With a roar, he shot forward, launching a fist at Long Chen. This fist covered all angles, forcing Long Chen to take it head-on.

Long Chen raised his hand to block. With an explosive sound, powerful gusts unfurled. While Long Chen didn’t budge an inch, Long Ziwei was knocked back a few steps. Every step left a large hole in the ground.

All the women who had come with Long Ziwei were startled. They knew that Long Ziwei didn’t want to instantly kill Long Chen, so he wasn’t going all out. Nevertheless, the power behind this fist was staggering. Blocking it would require them to exert their utmost power.

In contrast, Long Chen simply raised his hand, knocking Long Ziwei back. The ground beneath Long Chen’s feet remained unscathed, indicating that Long Ziwei’s power couldn’t even shake Long Chen. Not even a fraction of the force dissipated through the ground.

“Good! Then I can fight with peace in mind!” Long Ziwei shouted excitedly. Runes suddenly appeared around him, and a torrent of wild qi erupted in every direction.

“What a terrifying aura!” Fang Liude and the others cried out. These astral winds were like blades cutting their faces. They couldn’t even open their eyes. In contrast, Gui Jiu clenched his fists in excitement. The anticipated battle between two powerful experts was finally playing out before him.

“I’m coming!” Long Ziwei shouted and launched a fist at Long Chen again, his fighting spirit blazing.

Long Ziwei unleashed seven punches, and Long Chen blocked seven times, knocking Long Ziwei back each time. After the astral winds and dust settled, Long Chen and Long Ziwei’s figures reappeared in everyone’s sight.

Long Chen was still standing there, without his aura leaking out. On the other hand, Long Ziwei looked grave. He was already in his combat state, yet he hadn’t even grazed the surface of Long Chen’s true power.

“Now I’ll unleash my true power!” shouted Long Ziwei.

Shifting his left foot back, Long Ziwei imbued his fists with runes, surrounded by a five-colored divine radiance. Long Chen’s eyebrows furrowed in surprise at the sight of this phenomenon.

“Five-color bloodline?”

Long Ziwei confirmed, “That’s right, this is the Long clan’s five-color Supreme Blood! It embodies the laws of five distinct powers! Are you prepared to withstand it?”

Long Chen asked, “Shouldn’t it be seven-color Supreme Blood?”

Long Ziwei roared indignantly, “What nonsense are you talking about?! In the entire Long clan, other than Saint Emperor Zhantian and that monster Long Tianrui, who else possesses seven-color Supreme Blood… eh?”

All of a sudden, Long Ziwei paused and stared at Long Chen, asking, “How many colors is your Supreme Blood?”

Long Chen smiled slightly. “Guess?”

“Fuck off! I’ll force you to show it to me!” roared Long Ziwei. His fist flew toward Long Chen, with five-colored divine radiance blazing on it. It was like a heavenly god’s hammer smashing toward Long Chen. After repeated probing blows, Long Ziwei no longer held back.

BOOM!

Long Chen raised his palm again. With an explosive sound, Long Ziwei grunted and was knocked back again.

“I refuse to believe it!” Long Ziwei roared, his aura suddenly rising. No longer suppressing his cultivation base to the third Heavenstage, he unleashed another punch.

BOOM!

Again, Long Ziwei was knocked back. This time, his Blood Qi flipped inside of him, and he almost spat out blood.

Long Chen stood firm like an immovable mountain or a sea of stars. Most terrifying of all, from the start until now, he hadn’t entered his combat state.

“Are you looking down on me?!” Long Ziwei’s voice reverberated with frustration.

Long Ziwei formed some hand seals, summoning a giant dragon behind him. Extending his hand, he condensed the dragon into his palm, drawing upon the power of heaven and earth.

“Heavenly Dragon Attack!” Long Ziwei roared. He was truly angry now. After all, Long Chen’s attitude was like he was indulging a child.

Finally, Long Ziwei unleashed a divine ability, one not disseminated beyond the Long clan. It brimmed with formidable killing power.

Through a dragon projection, this divine ability extracted all the energy of heaven and earth and compressed it into the palm. It was a true killing blow.

Long Chen raised his hand once more. However, this time, a dragon mark appeared on his palm.

BOOM!

As their two palms met, a dragon cry rang throughout heaven and earth, and a figure was sent flying back like a shooting star.
