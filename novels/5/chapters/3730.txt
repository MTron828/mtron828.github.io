Chapter 3719 Xia Chen’s Shortcomings

“Xia Chen, when did you get so powerful?! That He Changtian wasn’t even a match for you. How could you hide this from me? You even made me worry about you!” Within the restaurant, Guo Ran cried out indignantly. From start to end, Xia Chen had been fighting in a graceful and suave manner before completely crushing He Changtian. It was overflowing with the style of an expert.

“No, you really do need to worry about me. Let’s go!” Xia Chen rose.

“Where are we going?” asked Guo Ran. The five of them had just sat down and ordered more food. They hadn’t even had a chance to eat yet, but the two of them were going now?

“Where do you think we’re going? We have to set up a stall! In that battle, I used up all the profit that we just made. If I don’t make some more, what am I going to use in the three thousand worlds?!” said Xia Chen bitterly.

That battle definitely was suave. But having used up so many talismans, it would be a lie to say that it didn’t hurt. Talisman Masters fought by burning money. Although Xia Chen had plenty of money by following Long Chen, giving him a thick foundation, in order to be safe, he always had to keep a large stock of them.

The most frightening thing for a Talisman Master was running out of talismans. Thus, every Talisman Master would make sure that they kept an ample stock of them.

Although the food had just arrived, Xia Chen was in no mood to eat. He had to make up for his losses this time. Hence, he only managed to say a few words with Xia Guhong and the others before being in a rush to make more money.

“Why don’t you set up the stall yourself? I’ve pretty much sold everything that I have to sell. I need the rest of the things for my own research. Also, it’s not like I can help you anyway…” Guo Ran didn’t really want to move.

“You have to help me sell them! I’ll inscribe more, while you help me swindle people- no, not swindle, just be a good seller. Don’t I need a good businessman to sell my wares?” said Xia Chen.

Guo Ran wanted to keep arguing, but he was dragged away by Xia Chen. Xia Chen didn’t give him a chance to be lazy.

With the two of them leaving, it was just Long Chen, Yu Qingxuan, and Xia Guhong at the table. Seeing Guo Ran’s unwilling expression as he was dragged away, Yu Qingxuan laughed.

At the same time, she felt moved. She could clearly feel the close bond between Long Chen’s group of three. That was something that she had never had in this lifetime. She had never thought that people could have such a level of trust in each other.

She had been in the Blazing Heaven Divine Sect ever since she was a child. Although her master was Dongfang Zichu, she didn’t spend a large amount of time with him. Normally, it was the servants in the Blazing Heaven Divine Sect that looked after her.

Everyone respected her, but she had no companions, no childhood friends. The only thing she liked was cultivation and alchemy.

Yu Qingxuan had previously not felt anything in particular about that kind of life. That was because that was simply her life. She had thought that this was what life should be.

But when she grew up and began to experience more, she found that other people had friends. They had companions that played and braved danger together with them. It was at that time that she felt a certain emotion called loneliness.

She tried to make friends, but her status and position made it so that she was far above others. Even if she tried lowering her attitude, the reverence that others had for her position created a wall between them and her.

Some people also only came to her in pursuit of medicinal pills. She was the Pill Fairy. Any pill that she gave away was a life-changing treasure to others. Hence, Yu Qingxuan tried to sincerely help others, but she still wasn’t able to feel any sincere friendship. No one viewed her as a friend.

Thus, when she encountered Long Chen, his firm gaze moved her. In this lifetime, she finally experienced the taste of wholeheartedly trusting someone.

Seeing them act without reservation between them, she felt moved. To be surrounded by a group of people that you could fully trust was a blessing that could not be described with words.

“Xia Chen truly is powerful. However, talisman cultivators are infamous for being money-burning existences. Long Chen, you have to be mentally prepared,” said Xia Guhong with a smile.

“It will be fine. After all, other than fighting and killing, I also have some occasional business,” said Long Chen.

“Is your business plundering the Soaring Dragon Company?” laughed Xia Guhong.

“It can’t count as plundering. At most, it can be considered robbing the rich to help the poor. In any case, they didn’t earn their money cleanly. As long as they refuse to admit to that matter, I can keep plundering them with no qualms,” said Long Chen very naturally, as if this was simply right.

Long Chen already explained what the Soaring Dragon Company had done to him. Yu Qingxuan despised the Soaring Dragon Company for using innocent people as sacrifices, so she felt no problem with Long Chen plundering the Soaring Dragon Company.

Xia Chen and Guo Ran had just left when a ruckus came from below. The Vermilion Bird Empire’s experts didn’t feel right going up to the restaurant with them, yet they also didn’t dare to go too far. Thus, they were just roving the area around the restaurant.

When Xia Chen and Guo Ran came out, they asked the two of them what they were doing. Hearing that they wanted to set up a stall for business, the Vermillion Bird Empire’s people immediately volunteered to help them.

Xia Chen quickly found a suitable spot. This was actually an occupied spot, but the person who had set up their stall here was selling items that were extremely specialized, and thus there weren’t many buyers.

Xia Chen then directly gave him three talismans to get this spot. Seeing the talismans, that person immediately gave up his stall, and Xia Chen started inscribing talismans right in front of everyone, while Guo Ran was in charge of selling. As for the Vermilion Bird Empire’s disciples, they were drumming up business, calling out the bystanders. A crowd quickly formed.Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

Xia Chen’s fame soared in this place. He had easily killed a Supreme expert, He Changtian. Hence, countless people had witnessed just how powerful his talismans were.

Seeing Xia Chen creating and selling talismans right there and now, countless people came to buy them. However, Xia Chen no longer had that many extra talismans to sell. After they were all gone, they could only wait for him to make more. A long line then formed. His business was doing excellent.

Xia Chen naturally wasn’t inscribing any talismans that were too high level. Creating those talismans took too long. He only made the simpler ones at the moment, but these simple ones were also very useful. For example, Spatial Transportation Talismans, Appearance Transforming Talismans, Body Concealing Talismans, Aura Suppressing Talismans, Body Substitute Talismans, etc. They weren’t very powerful but could save their lives.

For these talismans, Xia Chen had arranged many inscription fluids. With his brush, he made one with a wave of his hand. After that, a sheet of paper that had looked completely ordinary instantly gave off lively fluctuations. Even personally seeing it, people had difficulty believing.

While Xia Chen made and sold the talismans, the buyers that had materials for talismans, formations, or other talismans had priority. That was what Xia Chen was lacking. When it came to immortal king crystals, he wasn’t particularly interested.

Xia Chen had a thrumming business now with countless people coming to buy from him. Fortunately, he had the help of the Vermilion Bird Empire’s disciples, or if it was just Guo Ran alone, it would be completely chaotic.

“Qingxuan, why don’t we set up a stall too? You refine pills in front of everyone, and I’ll raise the price. We’ll split the profit fifty-fifty.” Seeing Yu Qingxuan smiling as she watched Xia Chen and the others’ busy figures, Long Chen sensed that she was very interested.

“No. If eunuch Wei learns of it, he’ll prattle for a long time. He’ll even report it to my imperial father and get me scolded.” Yu Qingxuan shook her head somewhat helplessly.

Suddenly, rumbling sounds rang out from the distance, and the originally clear and sunny sky became dark. Long Chen’s heart shook. Raising his head, he saw black devil qi covering up the sky.

“Now it’ll be interesting. Another opponent has come.”
