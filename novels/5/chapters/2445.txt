Chapter 2435 Two Races Fight?

Translator: BornToBe

Long Chen had reached the point where he no longer cared to settle things with words. Evilmoon unleashed a wave of black light.

With one blow of Split the Heavens, the lifeforms attacking him were all wiped out.

The distant lifeforms were dumbfounded, clearly not having expected him to be so powerful.

Suddenly, one particular lifeform with a face full of wrinkles appeared. Its spear shook the world as it pierced toward Long Chen.

Long Chen was startled. Not daring to tarry, his divine ring appeared along with five stars in his eyes. Evilmoon slashed down.

BOOM!

The old lifeform was sent flying, and this sight shocked the other lifeforms. This elder was most likely the strongest amongst them but was still unable to defeat Long Chen.

The elder was truly powerful. Long Chen felt his arms tingling. These lifeforms possessed a strange power that he had not encountered before.

A dozen black rays of light shot over at Long Chen just after he had sent the old lifeform flying. Evilmoon danced through the air, knocking aside those black lights. They were the same black bone spears that had struck him before.

Suddenly, the elder flew toward the spider’s head. A mark appeared on the spider’s head, and it swallowed the elder.

A ferocious aura suddenly exploded out of the spider. The earth crumbled as its eight legs bent. It pounced toward Long Chen.

The spider was like a war fortress shooting toward him. Its attack was both powerful and fast, reaching Long Chen in the blink of an eye.

Long Chen slashed Evilmoon, only for sparks to fly upon striking it. It was like metal, and he was knocked back.

The spider’s fangs then descended upon him as quick as lightning.

Long Chen was startled. “This is most likely an earth attribute beast.”

Some things were the same about this world. He was able to deduce its essence. But within this earth essence was some black energy that did not exist in the Martial Heaven Continent.

Long Chen’s foot stamped down on the air, and he flipped back, narrowly dodging the spider’s attack. Its fangs snapped shut on where he had been, creating a visible ripple in the air.

The spider opened its mouth, shooting out a ball of light. The ball quickly spread, forming a giant net.

Multicolored liquid dripped off that net, emitting a sweet scent. Long Chen hastily closed his pores. Even just smelling it could disturb his Yuan Spirit.

“This spider should be a contractual Magical Beast. That old fellow is controlling it,” deduced Long Chen based on the sharp attacks and quick reactions that most Magical Beasts didn’t possess.

A spider beast in particular had low intelligence and wouldn’t unleash attacks at this tempo.

At the start, it had clearly been a dumb beast, but now it had suddenly grown smart. That was clearly caused by the elder.

With a flick of his finger, flames shot out and incinerated the net. It was weak to fire.

Just at that moment, bone spurs shout out of the spider’s legs, filling the air and leaving him with nowhere to go. The sharp whistling sounds hurt his ears.

The elder was clearly enraged and wanted to crush Long Chen as fast as possible.

BOOM!

A pill furnace appeared in front of Long Chen. The bone spurs exploded upon contact with the Demon Moon Furnace. With how many of them there were, he couldn’t use Evilmoon to block them all. Being struck by any one of them would be troublesome.

“Die!” Long Chen put away Evilmoon and grabbed the Demon Moon Furnace. It was as big as a mountain, and he smashed it at the giant spider. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

BOOM!

The spider had just unleashed such a huge move when it was struck head on.

However, Long Chen was shocked to find that its body was extremely tough. With its legs stuck in the ground, it was absorbing the earth’s energy. He had thought that this blow would smash it half to death, but now he found that it wasn’t injured at all.

In that brief moment of contact, he sensed the earth’s energy being consumed by it. A golden mark lit up on its head.

“Ling-er, take it in!” Seeing it preparing another big move, Long Chen snorted. The Demon Moon Furnace’s lid suddenly popped open, and it devoured the giant spider.

The lid slammed shut. Rumbling rang out as it tried to refine the spider.

The spider struggled crazily inside the furnace, but it was unable to escape. As more and more flames enveloped it, it was quickly roasted. Having been separated from the support of the earth, it was unable to stop the Demon Moon Furnace.

As soon as Long Chen captured the spider, the other lifeforms went mad, howling at Long Chen crazily. They charged at him.

“You want it back? Here.” Long Chen sneered. The lid popped open once more, and flames gushed out along with a giant corpse.

Those lifeforms were instantly set ablaze and incinerated. Their cries echoed through the air.

Along with the spider’s corpse, another figure flew out. However, Long Chen had been waiting. He extended a single finger, stabbing it through the elder’s head. A flood of strange information entered his mind.

There were no memories for him to peer through. He only saw a few fragmentary scenes. Soulsearch techniques weren’t very effective on these lifeforms. Perhaps Meng Qi would have some method, but he didn't.

“So this sacrificial altar is used to summon these spiders, but they only just managed to summon one before I ruined it…”

Although the information was incomplete, he was able to piece together what had happened. No wonder they were so angry. They had perfectly prepared their altar to summon these spiders, but he had destroyed it.

Suddenly, rumbling rang out along with some fierce shouts. Long Chen saw a group of dark-skinned lifeforms rushing over wearing beast hides.

These lifeforms looked almost identical to the human race, but their auras were completely different. They held bows in their hands and immediately started shooting upon seeing the lifeforms that had attacked Long Chen.

Those arrows were exceptionally sharp and capable of twisting through the air. Each of them struck their target. Despite being the most primitive wood arrows, they easily cut down these lifeforms. They seemed poisoned and had a special effect on these lifeforms.

Every arrow seemed to pain them immensely. If struck by more than a few, their movements turned sluggish. Any more than that and they would only be able to wail while crying on the ground.

Tens of thousands of the human-like lifeforms had appeared, but the other side also had numbers. They had equal numbers, but the strange lifeforms also had to be wary of Long Chen behind them.

Caught in between them, the strange lifeforms collapsed. Some of them charged toward Long Chen, only for the Demon Moon Furnace to unleash a wave of fire that incinerated them.

“Did I interrupt a battle between races?” wondered Long Chen.

On one side, he was incinerating anyone who approached him, while the other side had rain of arrows falling. One of these archers came straight through the battlefield.

Long Chen deduced that this creature was a woman, but it was difficult to tell. All of them looked similar to him. Without looking closely, he wasn’t able to tell if they were male or female.

The woman maintained a safe distance upon arriving in front of Long Chen. She spouted some strange syllables at him.

“I don’t understand what you’re saying.” Long Chen shrugged.

The woman seemed to be in a panic. She pointed at the other lifeforms, said a few more strange things, and began gesturing. Long Chen was lost.

Realizing that he didn’t understand, she began rushing away. Seeing that he wasn’t following, she beckoned.

Long Chen had no idea what she wanted, but he didn’t sense any hostility from her. With the Demon Moon Furnace out as protection, he followed her warily.

They passed through the battlefield. The other lifeforms glared at him venomously and tried to attack him, as well as the woman.

The woman was nimble and easily dodged their attacks. She only blocked a small number of those attacks and easily weaved her way through.

Long Chen had the Demon Moon Furnace smashing around. Those lifeforms were smashed to pieces, but more continued to charge at him.

BOOM!

An explosive sound rang out, and the woman pointed in that direction. Another explosion echoed. The earth began to sink, and space twisted wildly. As the void was torn open, a giant spatial crack spread rapidly.

The woman let out a startled cry and hastily fled. Long Chen also jumped in shock.

“These lifeforms have decided on mutual destruction?!”
