Chapter 4328 Arguing For the Sake of Arguing

Long Chen followed Bai Xiaole to the newly constructed guest hall of the High Firmament Academy. Although it appeared large and majestic, it was a bit crude as many details were not yet complete.

At this moment, this hall was packed with hundreds of experts. Amongst them were over ten experts at the peak of the Immortal King realm, and the rest were half-step Eternals.

These experts stood in the hall, accompanied by the High Firmament Academy’s experts. However, the academy’s experts were all Heaven Venerates, and not one of the academy’s important figures like Bai Zhantang was present.

On the way, Bai Xiaole told Long Chen that these people had come with disciples, saying that they wanted to exchange a few pointers with Long Chen. However, in truth, they had come to challenge him.

As a result, the academy’s higher-ups essentially ignored them, only sending a few elders just for show. They said that everything here was up to Long Chen, and since Dean Long Chen was sleeping, they would have to wait until he was awake before doing anything.

These people had been waiting for three days. The hall lacked sufficient seating, so they were all growing increasingly frustrated due to the prolonged wait.

After all, these people were the prominent leaders of the various factions, and half-step Eternals were typically revered and treated with great respect. However, in this situation, they were being overlooked and not even provided with seats.

As a result, these people were constantly chiding the elders from the academy who were in charge of accompanying them. Regrettably, the elders were powerless and could only inform the guests to continue waiting for Long Chen, indicating that they were unaware of the intentions of the higher-ups. Having to accompany these terrifying existences made them all nervous.

“The dean has come!”

Upon seeing Long Chen walk into the hall, those elders looked like they had seen their saving star. The world instantly felt brighter as the hope of these old timers had come.

Long Chen and Bai Xiaole entered side by side, offering a nod to the academy's elders as a form of greeting. Long Chen then headed straight for the single seat at the very front of the hall. Meanwhile, Long Chen acted like he didn’t even see the guests.

Long Chen took a seat, while Bai Xiaole stood by his side. Both of them remained silent, simply gazing at the experts in front of them. As a result, the experts, already frustrated at having to wait, were further infuriated by Long Chen's display of arrogance.

What was he trying to say with this? They had waited three days for him, but now that he arrived, he didn’t even say anything? Was he not even going to apologize for making them wait?

“The great High Firmament Academy, supposedly the number one academy of the nine heavens, seems to lack the basic courtesy of treating its guests. How unexpected.” sneered one of the elderly experts finally.

“Guests? Do you count as guests?” responded Long Chen contemptuously.

“We have traveled from afar to pay you a visit! We came with sincerity, with the heart to revere the number one academy of the nine heavens! Does that not make us your guests? If we aren’t guests, then great Dean Long Chen, what are we?” demanded that elder coldly. His tone could be considered polite, but it was also aggressive.

“There are many kinds of guests. However, the most hateful kinds are unwanted guests who come with evil intentions. When it comes to treating guests, it's essential to approach each guest differently because each person deserves individualized treatment. When you first arrived at the academy, you didn’t fill out the guest lists. You didn’t come bearing gifts, nor did you show any respect for the academy. Instead, you looked down on everyone here. Do you truly consider yourselves guests? Despite your many years of existence, it appears you have learned nothing about manners. Have all your years been spent living like a dog? You know nothing about being guests, yet you have the audacity to criticize others for not knowing how to treat guests. I see that your power is quite average, but your face is amazingly thick,” scoffed Long Chen.

The academy’s elders almost clapped when Long Chen said this. During the past three days, they had endured a great deal of insults and mocking from these arrogant fellows. They had long since found them displeasing, but they could only endure.

Long Chen’s response perfectly left these arrogant experts speechless. It was like they had just been given a resounding slap in the face, but the elders of the academy cheered in their hearts.

“You…!” That elder was enraged, but didn’t know how to respond. After all, what Long Chen had said was a fact. They hadn't followed the customs of guests this time.

Long Chen was quite displeased after suffering by Bai Shishi’s hands, so how could he possibly give them any face? Instead, all his fury would be vented on them.

“Dean Long Chen, good afternoon. This old man-”

Just then, another elder stepped forward from the group of human elders. He had quite the sharp appearance. Although his power was average, he was considered quite intelligent. From his demeanor, it could be seen that he was one of the leaders.

“Hey, why would you say such a thing?” Long Chen directly interrupted him.

“Oh? Did I say something wrong? This old man wishes to learn.” That elder simply smiled slightly, not getting angry at all.

“Are you saying I’m only going to have a good afternoon? Do you want me to have a bad morning and a bad night? Are you cursing me?” demanded Long Chen.

“You…!” The other elders were left speechless. This was definitely twisting his words too far. Long Chen was clearly nitpicking.

In the end, this elder simply laughed. “Hahaha, my choice of words is lacking. Then let me start over. Dean Long Chen, I wish you well. I’m from the-”

“What do you mean, you wish me well? You mean I’m going to be well, but you’re not going to be? Or maybe they’re not going to be well? So, other than me, everyone else will not be well?” Long Chen interrupted him once more.

That elder’s expression finally twitched. No matter how good his temper was, he couldn’t endure this anymore. He was getting angry.

“Dean Long Chen, don’t you think you are arguing a bit for the sake of argument? declared the elder angrily.

“Are you stupid? What do you mean, a bit? I’m clearly arguing for the sake of argument. Am I not making it obvious enough?” asked Long Chen.

One of the academy’s elders finally couldn’t hold back his laughter anymore. However, he knew that he shouldn’t laugh, so he hastily covered his mouth, causing some stifled snorts to come out.T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

The other academy elders were also biting their lips, trying to suppress their laughter. However, their bodies were shaking because of it.

After living for so long, they could count as experienced people. However, they had never seen such a sight before. This group of arrogant experts were choked to the point of almost coughing up blood.

Now they finally understood why the higher-ups refused to reveal themselves and insisted on waiting for Long Chen to wake up and deal with them. It was clearly a case of using a wicked person to deal with wicked people. People like them could only be put in their place by Long Chen.

“Dean Long Chen, you-!”

“Shut the hell up!”

Long Chen let out a thunderous roar, akin to the roar of a dragon, which resonated throughout the entire hall. Even the half-step Eternals present felt their heads buzzing from the roar’s intensity.

This unexpected shift into hostility took them by surprise. Long Chen's once indifferent expression had turned dark, and a powerful aura radiated from his eyes, filled with unyielding determination and a chilling intent to kill.

“Speak! Who sent you here? What kind of benefits did they give you?”
