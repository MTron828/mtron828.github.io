Chapter 3666

“They’re actually innate lightning runes!” Xia Chen was shocked to see that heavenly pillar.

Those so-called innate runes were runes born of heaven and earth. There was no way for cultivators to replicate them.

The heavenly pillar soared far into the clouds and beyond. No one could see the end of it. They could only see the runes forming draconic patterns across the pillar and an unending stream of lightning slowly flowing down from it, emitting a violent power.

At the bottom of the pillar was an enormous lightning sea. The lightning on the edge of the sea was rather calm, but the further it went, the more violent it raged. As for the area beside the heavenly pillar, the lightning was roaring in the form of countless monsters.

However, the Nine Underworld Hall’s assassins didn’t hesitate. As soon as they reached the lightning sea, they directly jumped in. They were like killing machines that had no emotions. They simply did whatever they were told to.

When Guo Ran jumped in, the lightning stabbed into his body like needles, and he couldn’t help crying out.

Long Chen and Xia Chen had the urge to beat him. Others were entering without a sound, so this little shout of his was far too conspicuous.

Fortunately, the others completely ignored him. Everyone maintained a certain distance from the others and began swimming slowly toward the center of the lightning sea.

Although everyone was wearing a mask, Guo Ran could clearly sense Xia Chen and Long Chen’s murderous gazes. Hence, he hastily shut his mouth.

When Long Chen entered the lightning sea, he found that the energy in the outer region wasn’t very violent. Its energy entered the flesh and soul, tempering their essence, qi, and spirit.

This was the lightning of the nine heavens, something similar to heavenly tribulation lightning. However, this lightning didn’t have that destructive will. It was no wonder that the World King would say that this was a place that drove the Bloodkill Hall wild with envy. It truly was a priceless treasure.

Xia Chen’s body quivered slightly when he entered the lightning pool. His physical body wasn’t strong. In fact, it was weaker than Guo Ran’s. But he knew that this was a rare opportunity and also his best chance to increase his essence, qi, and spirit. Hence, he clenched his teeth and swam deeper into the lightning with everyone else.

“Aren’t assassins not supposed to have that powerful physical bodies? Why are they so strong?” Xia Chen was shocked to see these assassins continuing onward. He already felt like he was pushing his limit, but they were going even further.

“The Nine Underworld Hall’s assassins are different from the Bloodkill Hall’s assassins. They specialize in assassination arts and have high requirements for the strength and flexibility of the body. Thus, their physical bodies are actually stronger than average cultivators. Do your best to endure. Once you reach your limit, I’ll have Lei Linger protect you. This lightning doesn’t contain a destructive will, so you two can use this chance to temper your bodies and souls. It’s a huge opportunity for you both. Xia Chen, didn’t you say that your soul energy still has some impurities? You can use this lightning to make your soul energy flawless,” transmitted Long Chen.

Guo Ran and Xia Chen nodded. Guo Ran’s physical body was strong, but his Spiritual Strength wasn’t. Especially in terms of his will, he was even inferior to an ordinary cultivator.

As for Xia Chen, his will was stronger than Guo Ran’s, but his physical body was far weaker. Thus, the strength of the lightning pool’s tempering was about the same for them. The question was, which of them would be unable to endure first?

In order to not show any clues, they continued to creep toward the core at the same speed as the others.

As they got closer, their bodies were in even greater pain. At the same time, a terrifying rumbling sound started to come from the depths of their soul. Even strange sights began to enter their minds.

The two of them knew that what they were seeing was nothing more than illusions. As the lightning tempered their souls, it drew out some dredges of their memories.

The nightmares of their youth as well as the terrifying sights that they had seen after growing up appeared. There was sorrow, there was joy, there was terror. All kinds of sights appeared in their minds right now.

The two of them were forced to resist the disturbance of these sights while they continued keeping an eye on the surroundings. They also had to take the initiative to draw in the lightning. Due to this, even breathing was difficult for them and their speed dropped.

However, as the two of them reached their limit, the others were showing signs of not being able to endure as well. Their speeds began to drop, but they still did their best to get closer to the core.

The lightning pool was enormous. Even though all of them were doing their best to swim to the center, they were still in the outer region. In fact, there was still quite some distance from the middle zone, let alone the actual core.

Long Chen didn’t feel anything at all. This lightning was nothing more than an itch to him. On the other hand, Lei Linger had transformed into millions of lightning dragons that were stealthily swimming to the core region.

Long Chen spread his divine sense, keeping an eye on the surroundings. Xia Chen had checked and found that there was no grand formation spying on them. That was why Long Chen dared to let Lei Linger so brazenly absorb the lightning here.

“Boss, I can’t endure any longer.” In just two hours, Guo Ran admitted his defeat.

“Even Xia Chen hasn’t said that he’s done. Can you have some backbone? Furthermore, with so many people here, are you going to be the first to give up? Don’t you think that you’ll expose yourself?” replied Long Chen.

“Didn’t you say that you had a method?” cried Guo Ran.

“That method is for me to protect you once you reach your limit. After that, I’ll have Lei Linger help you absorb the lightning to temper your body. You haven’t reached your limit yet, so how can I help you?” Long Chen was rather speechless. This little fellow truly knew how to be lazy. He was entirely hoping for Long Chen’s aid.

Long Chen ignored Guo Ran. For this kind of tempering, a person usually had to endure at least three days. Once a person reached their limit, they would faint.

Once they lost consciousness, the lightning would continue tempering the body. That unconscious absorption was the most important part.

“Lei Linger, slow down. We have plenty of time. Don’t go too far, or we’ll be exposed,” transmitted Long Chen. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

It had only been six hours, but Lei Linger already drew the attention of the lightning beasts at the core. That made Long Chen warn her.

The main thing was that he still hadn’t figured out the true essence of this lightning pool. If Lei Linger started devouring the lightning beasts, resulting in some problem, it would spell trouble for him. He didn’t want to disturb the old fellows here.

It had to be known that his main target was the Star Peering Heavenly Mirror, also known as the Devil Peering Mirror. If something happened here, he would be unable to enter the Star Peering Heavenly Mirror Trial.

Long Chen’s luck was good this time. He had actually arrived just in time for this trial and could directly come into contact with the Star Peering Heavenly Mirror. However, if he was noticed now and the other side was on guard, it would be impossibly difficult to break the mirror.

The Star Peering Heavenly Mirror was related to the deaths of countless nine star heirs. So, Long Chen had no choice but to be careful and had Lei Linger slow down.

Long Chen had Lei Linger first assimilate the lightning runes in the pool. Once the lightning runes in the sea had her brand on them, it would become a part of her body. After that, they could study the lightning beasts.

A day later, everyone was unconscious. Long Chen also pretended to be unconscious and quietly floated on top of the lightning pool.

Suddenly, two figures appeared in the air above the lightning pool. When Long Chen saw one of those figures, he almost cried out.
