Chapter 4517 Heavenly Corrupt Sect Master

Before any of the Corrupt experts could move, a lightning sword pierced through their leader’s head.

“Soulsearch!”

Long Chen’s Spiritual Strength erupted, and right in front of all of these experts, he brazenly examined their leader’s memories.

“Courting death!”

The rest of the Heavenly Corrupt Sect’s disciples were shocked and enraged. However, before they could do anything, two pretty figures appeared before them, followed by a sea of lightning and fire.

BOOM!

The surroundings were obliterated in an instant, to the point where even the ground ceased to exist. Just like that, all the Corrupt experts were gone without a trace.

Huo Linger and Lei Linger, now wielding even greater strength than when they had sneak attacked Ying Tian, effortlessly destroyed these Doyens with a wave of their hands.

After all, it had been over a month since the black soil started devouring so many Saint-level devil beast corpses. With all the life energy, the Moon Trees and Fusang Trees were growing crazily, boosting Huo Linger’s power. The thunderforce of those bodies also stimulated Lei Linger’s growth to the point that even Long Chen had to look up to her.

All of a sudden, the body Long Chen was soulsearching through exploded. Following that, the void quivered. An enormous hand appeared out of space and slammed down toward Long Chen.

“To dare offend my Heavenly Corrupt Sect, you must be tired of living!”

At this moment, heaven and earth changed color. While going through that person’s memories, Long Chen had triggered a taboo seal, bringing forth the attack of a terrifying expert.

Long Chen’s figure swayed, and he vanished from his original location.

BOOM!

The very spot that Long Chen had been in was obliterated. The void quivered, revealing a gloomy-faced elder with a crown on his head. His expression was extremely unsightly as his attack had actually missed.

Suddenly, he raised his head and let out a roar, sending sound waves in every direction. Space collapsed around him as the epicenter.

However, his attack was too late. Long Chen had long since escaped, and the elder didn’t even manage to grasp Long Chen’s shadow.

At this time, dozens of other elders arrived as well. If Long Chen were present, he would definitely be surprised. All of those black-robed elders were actually Saints.

“Sect master, what happened?” asked one of them respectfully.

This crowned elder was precisely the sect master of the Heavenly Corrupt Sect. When Long Chen started going through one of his disciple’s memories, he immediately sensed it and rushed over.

All the disciples of the Heavenly Corrupt Sect had seals on their souls to thwart any attempts by enemies to conduct soulsearches and learn their sect’s secrets.

Furthermore, the expert Long Chen had soulsearched on held a special status within the Heavenly Corrupt Sect. As a result, the sect master had personally placed the seal on him, which allowed him to immediately sense Long Chen’s intrusion.

Unfortunately for him, Long Chen was just too fast. As the elder’s attack had come through space, it had been unable to lock Long Chen down.

“Tell everyone in the sect that if you encounter this person, you are to immediately ring the alarm and summon our full force to kill him!” shouted the sect master.

He waved his hand, and an image of the black-robed Long Chen appeared in midair.

...

Long Chen flew at top speed for over two hours. Seeing that the sect master wasn’t chasing him, he finally relaxed.

“Damn, that sect master is actually an existence above a Saint!”

Long Chen’s heart pounded. It was fortunate that he had run quickly. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

“Big Brother Long Chen, why didn’t we stay and fight? We might not necessarily lose against him,” protested Lei Linger.

Long Chen was speechless. In the end, she was a lightning spirit, and her senses weren’t as sharp. She didn’t even realize just how terrifying that sect master was.

Lei Linger and Huo Linger had grown explosively during this month, but it also fueled their arrogance.

In this case, Long Chen could only comfort them. If he said that the three of them combined couldn’t beat that elder, they would definitely get even more stubborn.

After sending these two sisters back to the primal chaos space, Long Chen started to study the memories he had gained. Although he hadn’t managed to gain the core secrets, he had gotten quite a bit of useful information.

Only now did Long Chen realize that the place he had landed in was called the Devil Beast Demon Forest. It was such a vast land that almost no one had ever managed to traverse it.

From the rumors, deep within the depths of the forest lurked terrifying existences. They were formidable enough to pose a threat even to figures like the sect master who surpassed the Saint realm.

Hence, despite the abundance of treasures inside the Devil Beast Demon Forest, only a handful of people dared to venture into it. The place Long Chen had rushed through could only be considered the outermost border of the forest.

Long Chen breathed a sigh of relief. If he had been transported straight to the depths of the forest, he would have never been able to leave in this lifetime. This time, luck was on his side.

Furthermore, the direction he picked was also right. Picking the opposite direction would have led him deeper into the forest, sealing his fate.

The place Long Chen emerged from was precisely the territory of the Heavenly Corrupt Sect. Through this soulsearch, he learned that the Heavenly Corrupt Sect was a terrifying force, the most daunting power he had ever encountered thus far.

They had millions of Doyens and a hundred elderly Saints, and their sect master was an existence above the Saint realm. The sheer vastness of their territory meant that, despite Long Chen’s speed, traversing it would require him to fly at top speed for several days.

What disturbed Long Chen even more was the realization that this incredibly powerful force was nothing special in this world. Many factions just as strong as the Heavenly Corrupt Sect existed within this realm.

The Heavenly Corrupt Sect was one of this place’s natives and referred to this realm as the world of the ninth heaven. From their perspective, this place represented the peak of the nine heavens, and people like Long Chen were mere invaders.

The natives of this world were extremely xenophobic. When they saw invaders, they would immediately attack to kill, showing no mercy. Even sharing the same race and branch meant nothing to them.

However, much of the information that Long Chen sought remained securely sealed away. For example, he didn’t gain anything about the Corrupt God’s inheritance.

Based on his calculations, those memories were entrenched so deeply within the seal that only someone of exceptional skill, like Meng Qi, would possess the ability to breach it.

While Long Chen was thinking, explosive sounds rang out through the sky, causing Long Chen to hastily hide himself. A group of figures flew by his side, led by two Saints guiding numerous disciples from the Heavenly Corrupt Sect. Each of them exuded a stronger aura than those Long Chen had slain.

Observing their intense killing intent and noting the direction they headed, Long Chen murmured, “Interesting. It seems that they want to lock down this area. If I were to leave, I might have to fight them.”

A sly grin crept across his face. “If you’re going to treat me so warmly, I guess I can stay behind for a few more days! It seems that your Heavenly Corrupt Sect has quite a few industries here!”
