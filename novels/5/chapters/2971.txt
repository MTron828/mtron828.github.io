Chapter 2960 Battle Strategy

What shocked Long Chen was that this person’s aura was similar to the head judge, Chu Huairen, and the others, but his Blood Qi was already withered. Despite looking to be in his thirties, he gave people the feeling of an old man on the verge of death.

“Senior’s words are heavy. We are nothing more than a group of novices. We cannot accept such a greeting from you,” said Long Chen.

His vision was sharp. Although this person looked like a gust of wind would blow him down, there was a look in his eyes. He had definitely once been a powerful expert. Long Chen could sense his powerful will. But he had been turned into this state.

The elder looked at Long Chen curiously and then laughed. “I didn’t expect a true warrior to appear amongst this generation of new disciples. It truly is a blessing to the academy.”

Mu Qingyun, Luo Bing, and the others stared in confusion. They were completely unable to see through this person’s cultivation base. Seeing Long Chen be so incredibly courteous to him was surprising.

That person continued, “You must not know about me. But I trust you know the head judge of your Discipline Institute, Wang Chong. We entered the academy to cultivate the same year. We also joined the Battle God Palace in the same year. We also left the Battle God Palace in almost the same year. In that year, I lost my cultivation base, and he lost his arm. With no other choice, we could only leave our sacred palace. He became the head judge of the Discipline Institute, while I stayed here, taking responsibility over receiving the future warriors who come here full of hope and confidence. Seeing you, I feel like I’m seeing my old self. It truly makes one sigh.”

Mu Qingyun and Luo Bing were shocked. They hadn’t expected this unremarkable man in front of them to be of the same seniority as their head judge. They were also shocked by Long Chen’s vision. They hadn’t seen anything, but he had instantly seen through this man’s realm.

“Senior, are you using your own bitter experience to tell us how frightening the devil battlefield is?” asked Long Chen.

That person smiled. “Yes. Every year, many disciples die on the devil battlefield. The majority of those are young and full of confidence in themselves. They lose their lives for nothing. I am here to give new disciples a lesson before entering the battlefield so that they know just how terrifying this battlefield is. However, seeing you leading this group, it seems that there’s no need for me to waste the time.”

He took out a tablet and handed it to Long Chen. “This is the map of the devil battlefield. Every terrain, the difficulty level, the kinds of devil creatures that appear there, their attributes, divine abilities, and other possible dangers are all written on there. This plate can also be used as a life-saving treasure. When you encounter danger, if you crush it, experts will come to save you. However, crushing it will reset your kill credit, so I suggest that you start off with the safest entrance to the battlefield.”

“Many thanks, senior.” Long Chen received the tablet and walked deeper into this dark world. Through a dark and dismal passageway, he saw countless war chariots, divine crossbows, as well as powerful flying beasts resting.

The auras of these beasts were extremely powerful. They seemed to have reached the fourth rank, existences that were above the Four Peak realm.

However, those powerful beasts were nothing more than mounts. They were very obedient. Just passing through this region gave Li Cai and the others chills. The aura of these beasts was truly terrifying. They could kill them with a single breath.

Most terrifying of all, they were staring at them, unblinkingly, making them nervous.

“Is this to give us experience?” asked Li Cai with a trembling voice. They were passing through a path between rows of these large, powerful beasts. To say that they weren’t afraid would be a lie.

“It is on purpose to scare us, making us guard against pride and impatience. They don’t want us to lose our lives here,” said Mu Qingyun, also a bit nervous.

Although these beasts could easily kill them with just a move, they were tame. But the feeling of having their lives under the control of others was particularly nerve-wracking.

As for Long Chen, standing at the very front, he didn’t even look at those beasts. That gave them greater confidence.

BOOM!

Suddenly, the earth trembled. One of the giant beasts moved, blocking their path and causing them to scream.

“Red Armored Earth Dragon.” Luo Bing was shocked and hastily stopped. She didn’t even dare to move. This was a terrifying fourth rank devil beast.

A devil beast was different. They possessed greater intelligence on average, and were not so easy to control. Even though they might seem to be under control, they might devour their master at any moment.

Seeing it block their way, Luo Bing and the others didn’t even dare to move. But Long Chen walked right over to it.

“Brother San!” cried out Mu Qingyun.

However, the giant earth dragon suddenly knelt down and prostrated itself towards Long Chen.

“What…?!”

Mu Qingyun and the others were stunned, unable to believe their eyes. Long Chen had already walked over to its head and patted it.

“Let’s go.”

Long Chen was deeply moved. This Red Armored Earth Dragon had an extremely weak trace of the dragon race’s bloodline. However, it was this tiny little trace that allowed it to sense the dragon blood fluctuations within Long Chen’s body, causing it to prostrate towards him. It was willing to be controlled.

Long Chen was growing more and more suspicious of the dragon blood in his body. There had to be some secret to it, or such a terrifying earth dragon wouldn’t act this way.

Long Chen had it stay still as everyone walked up its back. It was like climbing a mountain. Li Cai and the others had chills as they followed. Seeing its eyes that were the size of a whole house made them tremble.

However, to not be looked down upon by Long Chen, Luo Bing was the first to follow. Seeing it not move, the others also relaxed enough to follow.

Once everyone was up, the earth dragon stood up again. Li Cai and the others felt like they were taking a trip through the gates of hell. As for the Luo Gate’s disciples, their clothes were soaked in sweat. They were under the greatest pressure.

They walked through the path of beasts, arriving at a camp. They finally saw countless inner academy disciples busily coming and going.

Upon reaching this area, Long Chen showed his tablet, and they quickly received their own temporary tent.

The tent was large enough to fit both guilds’ people and still be spacious. There was a large sand table within the tent. It was a three-dimensional map. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

“Come, let’s discuss our strategy. Do you want to drink soup, eat some noodles, or directly eat meat?” asked Long Chen.
