Chapter 3883 Malevolent Spirit Devours Souls

The current Gu Yang was like a real draconic lifeform. As the image of the ten thousand dragons roared in his manifestation, his killing intent erupted. His spear then mercilessly stabbed toward the city lord, locking him down fully.

The city lord’s cultivation base was two major realms above Gu Yang’s. So, whether it was in terms of mental energy and Spiritual Strength, he far outclassed Gu Yang. According to reason, it should be impossible for Gu Yang to lock him down.

However, Gu Yang relied on his towering Blood Qi to suppress heaven and earth, using the most barbaric and unreasonable method to lock the city lord down.

“Ignorant brat! You dare?!” At this moment, the city lord was shocked and enraged. As the ruler of Silver Moon City, he had only solidified his position after slaying countless lifeforms. So, it was his first time being looked down upon by a junior. Without hesitation, he unleashed a surge of silver energy with his sword, clashing with Gu Yang head-on. This confrontation was very simple and direct.

BOOM!

As the silver light collided with the golden Blood Qi, the world underwent a transformation, awash in a captivating blend of gold and silver hues. The impact of their collision tore the void apart, and waves of energy surged through the Heavenly Daos, creating ripples that reverberated across the world.

“What a terrifying physical body!”

A lifeform from the Dragon Mammoth race cried out in shock. It too possessed an incredibly terrifying physical body, but its power could not compare to Gu Yang’s.

Gu Yang and the city lord clashed and once more retreated. In this exchange, neither of them had any advantage.

With a light swing of his sword, the city lord created a blooming sword flower. Like a venomous serpent, his blade lashed out at Gu Yang from every angle. This assault contained a myriad of variations, each strike infused with incredible malevolence.

However, Gu Yang didn’t even look at this technique, his rumbling spear simply swinging through the air. Borrowing the momentum from their last clash, he smashed it at the city lord’s head.

Seeing this scene, the city lord was taken aback. Gu Yang was clearly intent on dying along with him! A spear had a greater reach, so even though the city lord had attacked first, Gu Yang’s spear would definitely reach him before the sword landed.

Knowing that Gu Yang’s spear would erupt with formidable force once it struck him, the city lord didn’t dare to receive the terrifying attack with his body.

As a result, his sword spun through the world, turning from a thrust to a downward slash. With perfect precision, his sword tip struck the point on Gu Yang’s spear that was the hardest to control, two-thirds of the way forward.

BOOM!

Overwhelmed by the force, the city lord’s sword yielded under the strain, visibly bending, and his body quivered in response. With a grunt, he was blown away.

In the end, the city lord still underestimated Gu Yang’s attack. He had hoped to resolve Gu Yang’s attack with a special technique and then counterattack. However, due to switching from offense to defense so suddenly, he was at a disadvantage. After all, Gu Yang’s power was too condensed. Unable to properly disperse it, his power directly invaded the city lord’s body through his sword, almost making him cough up blood.

While the city lord was enraged, he also felt a burst of fear. Just now, he had thought about taking Gu Yang’s attack in order to eliminate him. However, if he had truly done that, he wouldn’t have just risked being injured. An attack with such highly concentrated power would have wiped his Yuan Spirit out along with his body.

“If you’re so afraid of death, you’ll definitely die today. Sigh, you don’t even believe in yourself. No one can save you,” sneered Gu Yang. He then stamped on the air, shooting toward the city lord with his spear in hand.

Hearing this, the city lord was incensed. Gu Yang’s words were like poison arrows piercing his heart. This evaluation was an insult.

“Ignorant fool, who do you think you are to dare teach a lesson to me?!” shouted the city lord. While quivering in rage, his sword danced and thousands of sword-images slashed toward Gu Yang.

Gu Yang repeatedly blasted apart his attacks. Engaged in an intense fight, the two combatants unleashed torrents of wild qi, causing heaven and earth to tremble, as if on the verge of collapse. However, the two of them were relatively evenly matched.

Golden Blood Qi and silver light repeatedly clashed, producing rumblings as if the laws of the Heavenly Daos could not contain their power.

This shocking battle left countless onlookers astounded, their jaws dropping in sheer disbelief.

“An Immortal King is fighting a Divine Venerate, and the latter is a Double Supreme at that!”

Amidst the battle between Gu Yang and the city lord, a sudden and thunderous explosion shook the air, seizing everyone’s attention. A blood mist then filled the air. Intrigued by the sudden turn of events, they turned toward the source of the commotion and saw a shocking scene.

They just barely managed to see an elder being blasted apart by Li Qi’s rod. That elder was the city lord’s left hand.Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

After his body was destroyed, his Yuan Spirit fled in terror. He had never dreamed that he would encounter such a terrifying youngster here. He had only managed to receive three blows before his physical body was unable to endure.

“City lord, save me!” Even as he begged for aid, he didn’t realize that his respected city lord was in an intense battle with Gu Yang and had no time to bother with him.

“Malevolent Spirit Devours Souls!” After destroying his physical body, Li Qi didn’t continue to attack, not even raising his rod. Instead, he formed hand seals, and that malevolent spirit figure behind him opened its mouth.

That figure was like an ominous devil. When it opened its mouth, it revealed countless sharp teeth.

Having lost his physical body, the assistant of the city lord suddenly felt a powerful suction drag him back. Even as he fled, space seemed to retreat and his Yuan Spirit was slowly pulled toward a sinister mouth.

He struggled with all his might, but he was only dragged closer and closer to that mouth, causing him to despair.

“No!”

Regretfully, all his struggles were useless. He was still sucked into that mouth.

BOOM!

When that mouth closed, everyone saw his Yuan Spirit collapse, devoured.

The malevolent spirit’s mouth then wriggled a bit as if it was chewing. Its crocodile-like eyes actually lit up as if it was enjoying the taste.

“Save me!”

Just then, the other assistant to the city lord screamed miserably. He wasn’t even done begging for help before he was devoured by the other malevolent spirit.

His physical body instantly exploded and blood mist came out of its mouth, his Yuan Spirit directly swallowed.

At this moment, the left and right hands of the city lord, two Double Supreme Divine Venerates, were slain just like that. Everyone was shocked. Were these people all monsters?

As for the army of hundreds of thousands of experts that the city lord had brought with him, they were dumbfounded. Their city lord was now blocked by someone, while his two assistants were already slain. Having reached the Dragonblood Legion and seeing their murderous gazes, they instantly began to sweat.

“Since you’ve come, don’t leave!”

Li Qi and Song Mingyuan formed hand seals, and the two big malevolent spirits behind them suddenly exploded, transforming into millions of smaller malevolent spirits that swarmed over the Silver Moon City’s army.
