Chapter 3907 You Should Die Instead

An illusory figure appeared behind the Nine Underworld Luocha, so indistinct that it wasn’t possible to tell if it was male or female. However, it exuded immense desolate qi, and its eyes glowed with divine light. That light seemed to pass through spacetime, seemingly looking through from the depths of hell, causing people’s souls to shake.

“Asura Storm Slash!”

As the Nine Underworld Luocha shouted, she pointed her sword at Yue Zifeng. An icy and sinister aura then radiated from her, transforming her into a being utterly detached from humanity.

When light slashed out of her sword, it pierced through spacetime, unleashing a slicing sound akin to the sound of the very laws of heaven and earth being sliced apart.

However, in front of this berserk attack, Yue Zifeng looked completely indifferent. Without any manifestation supporting him, no raging gusts or bloodline pressure could be seen around him. But when his sword shone with divine light, it was as though it had come alive, its sharp aura causing the heavens to quiver.

Rather than retreating or blocking, he thrust forward into her attack. When the sound of their swords clashing rang out, the surrounding space collapsed and exploded, forming a giant black hole around them.

“When power is compressed to the limit, it can actually cause such destruction!”

This black hole was like the gaping maw of a monster and drew everyone’s attention. Even Heavenly Dao runes were being absorbed by it, forming a terrifying vortex.

However, that terrifying black hole didn’t seem to affect Yue Zifeng or the Nine Underworld Luocha. They both were unleashing killing blows with their swords.

One was a peak assassin and the other was a peak sword cultivator. As top-tier sword users, their attacks struck like lightning, unleashing hundreds of moves in an instant. As a result, sword-images filled their battlefield, covering up their bodies.

“As soon as you make a single mistake, you’ll never recover.” The Nine Underworld Luocha’s voice rang out from the sea of swords.

“Since I set foot on my Dao, I’ve never made a mistake. It didn’t happen in the past, and it won’t happen now. As for you, once the power you’re drawing on is exhausted, you will fall to my sword,” responded Yue Zifeng coldly.

The black hole surrounding them expanded continuously as they unleashed a ferocious onslaught of attacks. After that, cracks resembling streaks of black lightning also spread through the air, but in truth, they were the spatial cracks generated by the force of their swords' strikes.

As Yue Zifeng fought the Nine Underworld Luocha, Weng Tianyao, the Underworld Eye Giant, Yin Changsheng, and the mysterious beast cultivator all charged at Long Chen.

Meng Qi, the Pill Fairy, Bai Shishi, and Bai Xiaole moved to stop them, handling one of them each.

“You want to buy time for Long Chen? Keep dreaming!” Yin Changsheng sneered at the Pill Fairy in front of him, completely ignoring the flame of nets she summoned.

Just as he was about to strike her net, his body became illusory and passed through her blockade like it was nothing.

The Pill Fairy’s expression changed. Yin Changsheng was also a flame cultivator, and he knew that the Pill Fairy’s Heavenly Rainbow Flame was difficult to deal with. As a result, he refused to fight her directly, instead using his faith domain to pass through her blockade.

“The Dragonblood Legion won’t let you be so arrogant! Dragonblood Cross Slash!” Guo Ran let out a furious roar, and all the Dragonblood warriors’ power concentrated in his blades once more.

“A mantis trying to stop a chariot, you don’t know your own power. Do you take me as the old Yin Changsheng? Sacred Flame God Slaying Spear!”

Yin Changsheng smiled in the face of the Dragonblood Legion’s combined power. He simply thrust his spear, and a giant flame spear shot out like the spear of a god.

BOOM!

Facing the impact head-on, Guo Ran felt like he had been struck by a god’s hammer, causing him to cough up blood. But he wasn’t the only one suffering. Every Dragonblood warrior also coughed up blood alongside him, having to bear the backlash together.

“His attack contains sacred qi! The concentration of his faith energy surpasses even that of Ji Wuming!” warned Xia Chen. He then sent his talismans shooting at Yin Changsheng.

Seeing the talismans, Yin Changsheng merely sneered and swung his spear, crushing those talismans. The space around those talismans then twisted and turned.

“You want to transport me away? With that little bit of power, you must be dreaming. If I want to kill Long Chen, no one can stop me,” sneered Yin Changsheng.

“Shut up! Long Chen’s life is mine!” The Nine Underworld Luocha let out a furious roar. However, she was blocked by Yue Zifeng and unable to charge over, enraging her.

Now, a golden bell was blocking Yin Changsheng’s path, so he smashed his spear at it.

To his surprise, the impact of the collision sent him falling back, causing him to stumble and grunt. At the same time, as his spear made contact with the bell, countless people on the battlefield cried out in horror.

As expected, after the golden bell was struck, countless people on the battlefield stiffened, and their Yuan Spirits came flying out of their bodies.

In a chilling spectacle, two giant malevolent spirits materialized and inhaled like whales, devouring all the Yuan Spirits.

This combination attack caused waves of lifeless bodies to fall from the sky, transforming the once densely packed battlefield into a desolate landscape. Tens of millions of experts had their Yuan Spirits stripped out of their bodies and then devoured by those malevolent spirits.

This attack surpassed even the viciousness of Weng Tianyao's previous strike, both in its sheer brutality and its expansive reach. It instilled unparalleled terror within the hearts of those who witnessed it.

“The World Domain divine item, the Soul Reaping Golden Bell? You are from the Heavenly Soul Hall?” Yin Changsheng’s expression changed as he recognized this divine item.

“Correct.” Meng Qi slowly descended from the heavens, blocking Yin Changsheng’s path.

“Hahaha, how unexpected! The Heavenly Soul Hall that never sticks their hands into the affairs of the mundane world has actually lowered themselves! Unfortunately, your status is unable to scare me off. Even if the Heavenly Soul Elder personally came, it would be useless. If I, Yin Changsheng, want to kill someone, no one can stop me!” declared Yin Changsheng.

“Long Chen is my beloved, and I will protect him. You cannot harm him unless you walk over my corpse,” said Meng Qi, her beautiful face full of determination.

These words drove countless people mad with jealousy. How good was Long Chen’s character? How could he make such a peerless goddess willing to sacrifice her life to protect him?

“Then you can just die!”

Yin Changsheng let out a furious roar. As his faith energy tumbled forward like raging waves, his spear stabbed toward Meng Qi.Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

Meng Qi drew a resolute breath as she summoned the golden bell before her. The next moment, she pressed her hands on the bell, and a blood-colored rune appeared on her forehead.

Seeing this, countless experts fled for their lives. If this attack landed, who knew just how many of them would survive?

“I think you should die instead! Considering how ugly you are, what’s the point of living?”

Just as Meng Qi was condensing her full power, a lazy voice rang out. A ray of light then struck Yin Changsheng’s spear.
