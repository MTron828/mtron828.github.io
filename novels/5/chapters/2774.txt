Chapter 2763 Major World Golden Coin

When the solemn High Priest drank the wine in the gourd, his entire aura changed. He was like a deranged drunkard.

However, after falling, the confident and suave impression of him shattered in an instant, vanishing without a trace. Everyone watching almost staggered themselves.

“The High Priest’s spiritual fluctuations have changed.” Long Chen looked over. He suddenly had a thought.

At this moment, the Blood race’s Emperor stabbed his spear at the High Priest’s back when he fell. However, without even turning back, the High Priest swung his sword, blocking the spear.

He suddenly turned. Like a wild gale, his sword unleashed waves of divine light, and he attacked nineteen times in a row.

As the sound of metal clashing rang out, the Blood race’s Emperor was forced back over and over. With every attack, mist that contained a dense Wine Qi exploded out of the High Priest’s body, and anyone who inhaled it felt dizzy. They felt like they had become drunk.

BOOM!

Finally, the Blood race’s Emperor was sent flying. The High Priest’s attacks had grown stronger and stronger until he was completely suppressing his opponent.

“So it’s a god’s inheritance. Hmph, it’s just a gourd of wine. Once it’s used up, your life is forfeit.” The Blood race’s Emperor finally saw through the clues. The power that the High Priest was currently unleashing was the power of a divine Dao. It was no wonder he was able to fight an Emperor with only the cultivation base of a Saint.

The High Priest’s eyes were hazy. He said, “This wine has over a hundred thousand years of history. It might not be enough against someone else, but against you? It’s enough.”

The High Priest suddenly shot forward. Despite clearly still being in a drunken state, his movements were much steadier now.

This wine could be considered a condensation of faith energy, as well as a present from the Wine God. This faith energy formed a bridge to the Wine God, and it was the only energy that wasn’t rejected by the wall of ascension.

Hence, it could be said that the High Priest’s wine gourd contained the Wine God’s personally made wine, which was passed down through faith energy. They only obtained a single drop every hundred years, so the High Priests of the Wine God Palace would usually use it to research the divine Dao. They never wasted it by drinking it.

Today, in order to fight this Emperor, the High Priest had drunk three small mouthfuls. However, he had underestimated its power and had almost lost consciousness.

Through the battle, some of its power leaked, and it finally reached a level that he could endure.

The power of this wine was the power of a divine Dao. While it was different from a Sovereign’s power, it was a power that could contend with it. However, an external power was just that. He would need to slowly get used to it.

As the power of the wine surged through the High Priest’s body, his sword danced, forcing back the Blood race’s Emperor.

With the Blood race’s Emperor blocked, the other Emperors no longer sat still. If they allowed Zi Yan to continue her attacks, all their people would be killed, and their plans would be ruined.

If they couldn’t activate the Heaven Devastating Bracelet, they would be unable to obtain the core of the star-field. Then this entire battle would be meaningless.

Because of it, the devil race’s Emperor and the Kunpeng Emperor both attacked. A devil claw and a giant wing swung toward Zi Yan.

Both of them were using their killing blows. In their eyes, the most threatening existence wasn’t Long Chen. It was Zi Yan!

But then, the void exploded and a giant palace appeared, blocking the Kunpeng Emperor.

Snow began to fly through the air. A chilling cold covered the entire battlefield.

“It’s the Divine Ice Palace!”

The name of the Divine Ice Palace was known to all. However, no one knew that the actual palace in and of itself was actually a combat divine item. It had an extremely mysterious origin, and legend had it that it was not from this world.

“What thing is this? Scram!”

The Kunpeng Emperor shouted, and its giant body smashed into the Divine Ice Palace. It was clearly extremely confident in its physical body.

However, a ray of divine light suddenly shot out of the Divine Ice Palace. When it struck the Kunpeng Emperor, his body rapidly shrank and was sucked inside the palace.

“Divine Ice Seal!”

Daoist Heavenly Feather’s figure appeared above the Divine Ice Palace. She then formed hand seals, and giant ice dragons appeared, wrapping around the Divine Ice Palace.

Rumbling rang out from the inside of the Divine Ice Palace. The Kunpeng Emperor was clearly fighting against the seal.

Meanwhile, Daoist Heavenly Feather sat in the air, continuing to form hand seals. She then murmured some kind of scripture, causing endless Ice Qi to gather. The entire battlefield became a world of ice.

“Despicable human race, if you have guts, let me out and we’ll have a real fight!” the Kunpeng Emperor bellowed from within the Divine Ice Palace. He was clearly unable to charge out, at least temporarily.

Daoist Heavenly Feather ignored him. The ice dragons were starting to fracture as the Kunpeng Emperor fought, and she had to constantly strengthen them.

Clearly, she was only capable of trapping the Kunpeng Emperor for a while. It was impossible for her to slay the latter.

At the same time, a golden light descended from the heavens, smashing into the devil race’s Emperor’s claw.

As a result, the devil race’s Emperor was knocked back. A glimmer of light appeared in his eyes.

In front of him, the void split open, and a giant coin came out.

However, this coin was not made of copper but immortal metal instead. Its light filled the world.

The golden light shone brightly, causing countless lifeforms to instantly become greedy. Their eyes became red in an instant, and they wanted to charge over and grab it. This gold coin drew out people’s most primitive desires.

“Grand World Golden Coin?”

The devil race’s Emperor’s expression changed. He suddenly shouted, “Is the Wealth God also planning on jumping into this pool of dirty water?”

“Sir’s words are lacking. This is no dirty water. To do business is to seek profit. All the Martial Heaven Continent’s lifeforms are what we depend on for our livelihood. The Wealth God has millions and millions of believers on the Martial Heaven Continent, and they have their families and dependents here. Since our clients and devoted followers are threatened, the Wealth God has instructed that we must stand up for them. So, we fight to protect ourselves.” Ma Ruyun appeared. Behind him was the Huayun Sect’s divine item, the Major World Golden Coin. This was also a divine item, part of a divine Dao.

When the High Priest had previously asked Ma Ruyun if they were bringing out their money, he had been referring to this divine item.

The appearance of the Major World Golden Coin signified that the Wealth God’s followers were also joining this battle. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

“Your devil race is incapable of fighting against this. I’d advise that you realize the problem and retreat while you can.”
