Chapter 2463 Corrupt God Underworld Spear

Translator: BornToBe

Long Chen was standing within Tian Xiezi’s domain, but the laws of this domain did not bind him. That was because he had also reached the fourth step of Netherpassage and controlled Samsara power.

With a simple slash of Evilmoon, a tear appeared within the domain. Meng Qi and the others understood his intention and retreated from the domain.

Ye Lingshan and the others also stopped their attacks, joining together with them.

Meng Qi looked at her skeletal beast and shook her head. She had used up less than half of its energy, so she would be able to summon it one more time. After evacuating, everyone focused on the two figures within the domain.

Long Chen lightly said, “Are you curious? When you saw me summon my lightning, that was no longer me but a lightning clone. That’s why all my attacks were focused on long range. This clone didn’t have the power to fight you in close range, and I didn’t want you to sense anything. Did it feel good to be fighting against so many powerful people at one time? Did it feel so good that you didn’t want it to end quickly? Did you want to enjoy that feeling of being unrivaled?”

Long Chen knew that Tian Xiezi was bewildered. His head had been muddled by his own power. Under the attacks of Meng Qi, Chu Yao, Yue Zifeng, Wilde, and the others, he had neglected to think about Long Chen.

As everyone else had been attacking, Long Chen had entered the life and death spring to absorb its energy. Other people would need to first enter a perfect meditative state, but Long Chen had no need to do so. This spring was a natural location where life and death energy flowed with the essence of Samsara. By absorbing it, Long Chen quickly came to be able to control Samsara power.

Other people would need several days to comprehend how to use Samsara power even in the best of times, but Long Chen’s mental realm had far surpassed his cultivation base, which always lagged behind. With this spring as a model that showed how Samsara power was circulated, he gained control over it in just a short time.

Although he had just set foot in this realm and had yet to fully comprehend it, it was enough.

As for his lightning clone, he had intentionally left it within the domain so that he could find the node of the domain. Without knowing where that spot was, entering from the outside was very difficult. After finding it though, entering and exiting became much easier.

Tian Xiezi’s gaze was frightening now. The feeling of unease had grown so intense that it could be considered as a kind of fear now.

He didn’t know if this fear was a shadow left behind by his previous defeats to Long Chen or whether it came from his sense of danger.

“It seems that you’re very confident. But that confidence stems from foolishness. You’ve just set foot into the Samsara realm and don’t even know how to call out the true name of your manifestation- oh wait, you aren’t even an Empyrean. If you had left with everyone else and joined forces to attack me, perhaps you would have had some chance to win. But you are too foolish. Staying within my manifestation’s domain signifies that you have died due to your overconfidence.” Tian Xiezi looked at Long Chen, his spear once more appearing in his hand.

“Do you know how most of my powerful opponents died? I’ll tell you. They died from talking too much. If you weren’t so conceited, if you didn’t put on a display of overwhelming multiple opponents, if you simply weren’t talking so much and instead went all-out killing me from the start, perhaps you wouldn’t be dying today. You are so conceited that it’s laughable. I’ll tell you this: even if I hadn’t entered the fourth step, you would still face a miserable defeat today. However, even if I could defeat you, I wouldn’t have been able to keep you here once you tried to run. Then you would have lived longer. Remember, you died to your talkative mouth,” said Long Chen.

“Bullsh*t!”Tian Xiezi’s manifestation shuddered. Divine light filled the entire domain, and pressure crashed down on Long Chen from every direction. That power was many times greater than what had been used to bind Meng Qi and the others.

In the face of that pressure, Long Chen calmly walked forward, seemingly unaffected. His divine ring appeared behind him.

However, this time, Long Chen’s divine ring was different from before. A starry sky had appeared within it. It was like staring into a vast cosmos. It was mysterious and beautiful.

If you looked closely, you would find that there were a total of 108,000 stars shining within the divine ring.

Those were the astral spaces within Long Chen’s body. They were now reflected within his divine ring.

Five-colored light radiated from the divine ring, dyeing the domain in its color.

“Your anger comes from your fear. Your shouting is to give yourself courage. Your viciousness conceals the fear of death in your heart. What nonsense is that crap about death being a return to the Corrupt God’s embrace? Not even you, the divine son, believes that crap. So you are afraid of dying. Your Corrupt path is simply a group of idiots lying to themselves. All your fearsomeness is to hide your own fear.” Long Chen’s divine ring continued to radiate light. The immense pressure crashing down on him slowly faded away.

Samsara power flowed within his meridians. He knew that he was now in control of an unimaginable power. However, he himself wasn’t fully clear on what this power was.

When he summoned his divine ring, his astral spaces seemed to come to life, automatically linking their power to form this mysterious starry sky. Their power was being fully unleashed.

In his current state, he was finally able to fully control the power of his 108,00 astral spaces. Although he didn’t have a manifestation, as the power of his astral spaces entered his body, he felt filled with power.

He didn’t even dare to unleash that full power at once. He unleashed it bit by bit, afraid that his own body wouldn’t be able to handle it.

It was no wonder Tian Xiezi dared to come here alone. This was the great divide separating the third and fourth steps of Netherpassage. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

“Nonsense!” Tian Xiezi roared furiously. Long Chen’s words had touched upon the deepest part of his heart. He was truly afraid, and that fear was only continuing to grow. He had an urge to turn and flee right now.

However, he was unwilling to flee just like this. Long Chen had just set foot into the fourth step and hadn’t gotten used to his Samsara power. This was perhaps his final chance to kill him.

Now, he regretted not immediately killing Long Chen. Perhaps then Long Chen would be dead. Even with everyone protecting Long Chen, they wouldn’t have been able to stop him.

Regretfully, there were not so many ifs in this world, nor was there a medicine for regret.

Every single one of Long Chen’s words was like a poison arrow shooting into the weakest part of his heart, trampling over his dignity and humiliating his faith. With a furious roar, his world energy erupted.

Space shuddered as cracks appeared in the air around Long Chen’s divine ring. However, even as Tian Xiezi attempted to use his domain to crush him, the divine ring was unaffected.

“Do you need some paper? It looks like you’re having trouble sh*tting yourself.” Long Chen looked at Tian Xiezi’s constipated expression sympathetically.

Tian Xiezi suddenly coughed up a mouthful of blood. His aura flew into chaos, and all the power that he had been concentrating dissipated.

“Boss really is boss. He can defeat enemies with just his mouth! Which other hero of this world can do that?” Guo Ran clenched his fists, looking at Long Chen worshipfully. Those words definitely contained killing power.

Meng Qi and the others exchanged a glance, shaking their heads. Even now, Long Chen didn’t care about his own status or keeping up the air of an expert.

“Long Chen, I’ll go all-out against you!” Even as Tian Xiezi hacked up blood, he could still roar crazily.

The statue behind him suddenly exploded, transforming into blood-colored runes that covered him. It was like he was encased in blood armor.

Divine energy raged through the air, and the aura of a god came from Tian Xiezi. Some of the weaker disciples had an urge to kneel.

“He’s igniting the part of him that makes him a divine son! Is he trying to die together with senior apprentice-brother Long Chen?!” A startled cry rang out as someone recognized what Tian Xiezi was doing.

The divine energy raging around Tian Xiezi took the form of blazing divine flames. He truly appeared to be a god at this moment.

“Corrupt King Hell Spear!”

Tian Xiezi’s manifestation twisted around his spear. The full power of his manifestation was sucked into his spear.

“Everyone, hide within the spring!” shouted Meng Qi suddenly. Everyone dove beneath the springwater.

“Die!” Tian Xiezi furiously unleashed his spear. This attack caused the world to shake.

Long Chen casually lifted Evilmoon off of his shoulder with a faint smile. “This grand aspiration of yours will probably never come to pass.”
