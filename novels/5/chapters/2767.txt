Chapter 2756 The Battle Starts, The World Shakes

A staff silently pierced toward Long Chen’s back, and Long Chen threw Ye Ming behind him in response.

The staff was incredibly sharp and instantly pierced Ye Ming’s body. However, just as it pierced his body, the hand Long Chen was using to hold Ye Ming’s hair felt a sharp pain.

He instinctively let go, only to find that his palm had turned as black as ink. More black spots were growing.

“Poison sorcery?”

Long Chen was startled. This was his first time coming into contact with such a poison. Even his dragon scales were being corroded.

This poison was composed of tiny larvae, hundreds of times thinner than a single strand of hair. They were crazily corroding his flesh and blood.

Flames then burst into existence on his palm, and a disgusting stench unfurled. As the black poison was quickly incinerated, his palm returned to normal.

The old monster of the Undying race, Gui Si, had interfered, pulling Ye Ming out. Ye Ming was also poisoned, but Gui Si quickly healed him, allowing him to recover.

Upon seeing Gui Si, Long Chen’s heart shook. Gui Si’s aura was extremely dark. Long Chen couldn’t see his realm, but by extrapolating, he had to conclude that Gui Si had also become a Sovereign back then. But he had been killed by Sovereign Zi Yang.

After recuperating from his death, there was no way that he could return to his peak. However, his power was still terrifying. He was probably the strongest existence beneath a Sovereign.

“Long Chen…!” Ye Ming’s face twisted. It had caved in from being struck.

Long Chen’s astral power was truly powerful. Not even a Sovereign’s power could immediately heal the wounds that it caused. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

Seeing Ye Ming’s face caved in, Mo Nian and the others found it both shocking and comedic. Ye Ming was probably the saddest Sovereign in all of history. His current state completely toppled their understanding of what a Sovereign was.

“You just manifested a Sovereign crown and have yet to make it solid. Your Sovereign power has yet to fully awaken. You’re at too much of a disadvantage,” said Gui Si.

Gui Si knew that this time, Ye Ming had been completely beaten. He didn’t know how many times Ye Ming had lost to Long Chen, but even though Ye Ming was a Sovereign, he was still violently beaten. To Ye Ming, it felt like Long Chen was a nightmare, a devil that he couldn’t beat.

Perhaps it should be considered a good thing that he had been beaten so many times by Long Chen. Someone else would have completely crumbled after failing to beat Long Chen even as a Sovereign. But with the experience of his past defeats, Ye Ming was still standing.

Suddenly, rumbling rang throughout every corner of the Martial Heaven Continent. Terrifying auras began to rise.

“Undying race, you really are hateful. Why aren’t you acting according to the plan? Are you trying to take everything for yourself?” A giant divine bird appeared, tearing apart the void. When its wings spread, heaven and earth shuddered as if the Martial Heaven Continent couldn’t contain its power.

“Kunpeng?!”

Startled cries rang out from Mo Nian and the others. This was clearly the legendary Kunpeng. It even had scales beneath its feathers.

The king of the Martial Heaven Continent’s Xuan Beasts was originally the Kunpeng race. However, compared to this Kunpeng, they weren’t even close to the same level.

That was because the Xuan Beasts’ king was the descendant of the Kunpeng race, the Peng race. But this Kunpeng before them was a true Kunpeng, one that had gone from a Kun to a Peng through a life of cultivation.

It was said that after a thousand years of cultivation, the serpent evolved into the python, the python evolved into the drake, and the drake evolved into the dragon.

In a similar fashion, the Kunpeng also evolved step by step, from a fish into a Kun, and a Kun into a Peng. It then soared into the heavens and beyond.

Its aura was truly terrifying, clearly the aura of an Emperor. So, this was an Emperor Kunpeng. It was currently extremely angry. Clearly, this invasion had thrown their plans awry.

“Who permitted you to move first? Who permitted you to activate the Heaven Devastating Bracelet ahead of time?!” roared the Kunpeng Emperor. Its voice was enough to shake the stars.

“Gui Si, you really are brazen. If any problems occur, can you bear the responsibility?”

Another voice rang out in the direction of the Yin Yang World. An Emperor had appeared there as well. When he appeared, his Blood Qi formed a giant blood sea around him.

“Gui Si, you despicable little person. You have broken the gods’ agreement.”

Devil Spirit Mountain exploded and a black-robed figure showed up. It was also an Emperor, the devil race’s Emperor.

The demonic beast race, the Blood race, and the devil race shouted at the Undying race, clearly infuriated.

Every single one of them had an Emperor, and their voices rang throughout every corner of the Martial Heaven Continent. Every single lifeform on the continent heard them.

Hence, cries of despair rang out. Children hid in their mother’s embrace, crying.

The secular world’s people didn’t even know what was happening. All they knew was that the demons from the other worlds had charged into the Martial Heaven Continent.

As for the cultivation world’s experts, seeing so many Emperors appear, while their side had none, it made their hearts sink. They could barely muster up an urge to resist.

“Hmph, don’t talk about some agreement. I refuse to believe that you would wait until others became Sovereigns if your side produced a Sovereign first. The Martial Heaven Continent is simply prey, and all the lives here are livestock raised to be slaughtered. The Martial Heaven Continent has reached its end. What could possibly happen to allow it to survive? You’re only angry because you won’t obtain the star-field core, right? Ha, since my Undying race produced a Sovereign first, the core will belong to us.”

Gui Si’s tone was unusually forceful, as if everything was under his control. He didn’t care about their threats.

“Undying warriors, slaughter them! This battle will be led by our Undying race! No one can compete with us!” ordered Gui Si suddenly.

The Undying race’s army immediately roared and charged over the Martial Heaven Continent like the tide.

The gate to the Corrupt God Cemetery had been fully opened, and an endless army charged through. From the other side, it was possible to see a giant city slowly flying over.

That giant city was Resentful Death City. It was actually flying over just like that.

BOOM!

The giant Resentful Death City smashed into a gate, which then instantly shattered. The wall between the worlds was broken and a giant hole appeared.

“Not good. Once the city comes through, Ye Ming will become a true Sovereign!” Long Chen’s expression suddenly changed. Now he knew why Ye Ming had been stalling.

He had been waiting all this time for Resentful Death City to come over, for the moment its aura fully merged with the Martial Heaven Continent’s. In that instant, Ye Ming’s Sovereign crown clearly brightened.

Long Chen guessed that if Resentful Death City charged over, Ye Ming would finish the last step to being a Sovereign. That was also the most crucial step.

He might be able to suppress Ye Ming now, but if the latter finished that last step, perhaps Long Chen would no longer be able to.

Long Chen then made his move, shooting straight toward Ye Ming.

“Little fellow, I won’t let you do as you please. Ye Ming will be a Sovereign, and you are powerless to stop him.” Gui Si waved his staff, and light shot from the eye sockets of the three heads. Layers of light then appeared in front of Long Chen.

“Boss, you go handle Ye Ming. Leave this old fellow to me.” Suddenly, a person flew out of the Dragonblood Legion, going straight for Gui Si.
