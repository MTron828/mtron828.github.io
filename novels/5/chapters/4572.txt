Chapter 4561 Raging Flames

This arrow was a test shot, and despite its silence, it was shockingly powerful. Other than Long Chen and Feng You, anyone else struck by it would suffer severe wounds or even death.

As Long Chen caught the arrow, a group of figures flashed into his mind. Glancing in the direction from which the arrow had come, he spotted them: winged experts armed with bows. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

His gaze instantly grew as sharp as a blade when he saw the leader of the group.

“Feng You, lead everyone forward. I’m going to fulfill a promise.”

After that, Long Chen’s Kunpeng wings appeared, and he shot out like a bolt of lightning.

With the gate to the Fantasy Spirit World now open, the entire battlefield was in chaos. Experts who had been concealing their power now fully revealed their strength as they tried to charge toward the gate.

Meanwhile, those at the forefront had long since prepared themselves for this. They had dug themselves in, taking advantage of the terrain to fend off the onslaught.

At the rear, some people pushed forward with all their might, while those at the front staunchly resisted, refusing to yield an inch. Countless experts then soared into the sky. From the earth and the sky, everything was in chaos.

Just like that, blood and corpses rained from the sky, soaking the ground in blood. The lives of experts seemed to be as worthless as blades of grass. The world seemed to have gone insane.

Long Chen took advantage of the chaos, using it as a cover to sneak up on the Feather race. He noted that their numbers had significantly increased since his initial encounter with them.

Perhaps they had joined with another one of their branches midway. In any case, their arrows were unstoppable. They were like a torrent, turning anyone blocking their way into pincushions.

Back then, Long Chen had experienced their power firsthand, and he had no desire to become a pincushion for their arrows. However, just as he got close, the leader of the Feather race wielding the white bone bow turned his attention toward Long Chen.

“Your sense of danger’s quite good! But so what?” Long Chen sneered disdainfully. Since they had noticed him, he would charge head-on.

“It’s you?” That expert’s pupils contracted slightly as he laid eyes on Long Chen.

He wasn’t afraid of Long Chen, but the timing of Long Chen’s arrival couldn’t have been worse. The Feather race’s experts were fighting another powerful race and had just gained the upper hand. However, Long Chen’s sudden arrival left them vulnerable. Now, two hostile factions were surrounding the Feather race’s experts.

“Leave this place to me! The rest of you, kill that fellow! End the battle quickly!” shouted the leader.

Eight of his powerful subordinates immediately abandoned their targets and flew toward Long Chen. The Feather race swiftly split its forces, allocating a significant portion to deal with Long Chen. From a million of them, half of them flew toward Long Chen. This meant that their leader didn’t look down on Long Chen at all.

Those eight experts were among his most powerful subordinates, their power only slightly weaker than his own. In his opinion, just four of them would be enough to defeat Long Chen, but he sent all eight to end the battle quickly and not affect their overall advancement.

For hundreds of thousands of the Feather race’s experts to suddenly turn back, the onlookers were startled, especially the ones fighting the Feather race. They didn’t know what was going on.

Seizing the opportunity presented by the distraction, the faction opposing the Feather race immediately launched a fierce counterattack. They forced the Feather race’s leader to go all-out, his bone bow constantly shooting out rays of divine light. Even without his eight generals, he was still capable of holding the frontline.

Just then, a powerful explosion grabbed his attention, and he saw a giant flame lotus blooming, devouring many of the Feather race’s experts.

This was a multicolored flame lotus of mixed energies that were extremely explosive.

Yes, it was the World Extermination Flame Lotus, but this time, it had undergone some transformations. At first, it was only the size of a palm, shooting into the Feather race’s army like a meteorite. Long Chen had yet to reach the Feather race’s shooting range when the flame lotus detonated amongst them.

Containing various types of chaotic flame energy, the lotus erupted into a devastating explosion the moment Huo Linger released her control. The flames within clashed and repelled one another, resulting in a massive explosion that engulfed the surrounding area. As a result, those unable to escape were obliterated without a trace.

“Run!”

The Feather race’s leader let out a furious roar, his expression changing. He then spread his own wings to shield all the Feather race’s experts around him. As for the half of his army that had charged after Long Chen, he was powerless to protect them.

BOOM!

A wave of fire crashed over them, resembling an exploding firework as millions of flames struck his barrier.

The Feather race’s experts outside of the barrier weren’t as lucky; they perished in the blast without even a chance to cry out. Meanwhile, the explosion ripped apart the wings of the eight generals, causing them to cough up blood in agony.

When the wave of fire reached the onlookers, their screams of pain filled the air as they fled into the distance.

The range of this attack was absolutely astonishing, surpassing even Long Chen’s understanding. However, he couldn’t help but smile. It seemed that Huo Linger was unhappy that Lei Linger could show off lately, so she unleashed her own power to show that she couldn’t be overlooked.

This World Extermination Flame Lotus had wiped out so many experts that numerous experts chose to cease their fights and observed the aftermath.

A pair of wings slowly opened on top of the charred ground, revealing an untouched land. After that, hundreds of thousands of the feather race’s experts looked out at the devastation in horror.

“Oh, hello, you guys!”

Long Chen was standing right above them, smiling and waving at them in a friendly manner.

Immediately, the surviving Feather race experts trembled uncontrollably. Long Chen was holding another flame lotus in his hand.

“Not good!”

Their leader’s expression changed, and he hastily folded his wings once more. However, that flame lotus had already fallen in front of him.

BOOM!

The flame lotus exploded, giving him no time to react.
