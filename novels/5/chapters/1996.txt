Ji Wuming’s eyes looked like a hungry wolf’s. It seemed that he wanted to bite Long Chen to death. That hatred was quite intimidating.

However, Long Chen was looking at him indifferently, seeming to not see his anger.

“Of course I don’t like you. Right now, I’m considering how I can make you feel the most pain so that you regret ever being born in this world.” Ji Wuming’s voice shuddered with rage. He even felt that killing Long Chen would be letting him off easy. He wanted to make sure that Long Chen lived a life worse than death.

Because of Long Chen, there would be no more Heavenly Fate Island in this world. Their inheritance, which had stretched on for countless years, had actually ended with Ji Wuming.

“I feel like we should amicably chat about things. Fighting and killing is meaningless,” said Long Chen.

“Hahaha! Now you’re afraid?! It’s too late!” Ji Wuming laughed sinisterly.

“Too late? Well, I was busy with my tribulation before this, and the one who should be afraid isn’t me. Look at your Unfettered Allseer. He’s already being beaten like a dog. The Dragonblood Legion came prepared this time. Every Dragonblood warrior is on the same level as a Netherpassage expert of the first step. As for the captains, they are on the level of Netherpassage experts of the second step and maybe even beyond that. Just look. They are beating up the Unfettered Allseer, which is the best proof. Weren’t you suppressing the Dragonblood Legion because you were afraid of us rising? Unfortunately, things didn’t go as you wished. We still rose, and that means that our enemies will no longer be having a good time,” sneered Long Chen.

He was saying this not just to Ji Wuming but to all the experts of the Martial Heaven Continent, including Yu Xiaoyun and the others. On the battlefield, the Dragonblood Legion had surrounded the Unfettered Allseer. Others were unable to charge past their barricade, while the captain-level fighters attacked the Unfettered Allseer. He tried to charge out several times but failed. He was trapped.

The Unfettered Allseer, a Netherpassage expert of the third step, was actually being beaten by a group of Life Star disciples to the point that he couldn’t counterattack.

“The Dragonblood Legion is absolutely terrifying. They actually have so many powerful experts, and they’re so young. Their potential is limitless.”

“It’s truly terrifying. Perhaps the reason Pill Valley constantly suppressed Long Chen is because they predicted that this day would come. Unfortunately, the Dragonblood Legion still managed to grow to this point.”

“Each of them is a monster. If any sect had one of them, it would give them hope of suddenly soaring. Most sects only managed to get one such monstrous genius. If there were two, they would fight until only one was left. Perhaps only a supreme monster like Long Chen can make those monsters follow him with such loyalty.”

Emotional sighs could be heard. The Dragonblood Legion’s name was about to shake the continent. Pill Valley had missed their chance to kill them.

At this time, the old man stopped fighting. Yu Xiaoyun refused to fight him directly, and he was too irritated by this combat style. After cursing him a few times, the old man flew back to stand by Qu Jianying and the others. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

Long Chen had said to make sure that Yu Xiaoyun and the others couldn’t interfere. The rest was up to him. Hence, the old man didn’t want to waste the effort. He smiled upon looking at Long Chen’s unrivaled manner. It was like he was seeing himself in his youth.

Qu Jianying, the old man, Yan Nantian, and the other Grand Elders were keeping a tight watch over Yu Xiaoyun and the others. As long as they made any moves, they would immediately attack.

Yu Xiaoyun and the others didn’t wish to act rashly. The four Grand Elders gave them a sense of immense pressure.

Other than Yan Nantian who was a bit younger, the other Grand Elders would definitely die if they went all-out. So if they were to strike, it would be an absolutely thunderous strike, a suicidal attack that aimed to take their lives.

While Yu Xiaoyun and the others didn’t move, there was one person who refused to stop. That was Wilde. He was still fighting intensely against the leader of the ancient races.

Long Juncang had shouted at him several times to stop as everyone else had also stopped, but Wilde ignored him. Long Juncang’s expression was dark with fury. However, Wilde’s attacks were too powerful and random. Long Juncang couldn’t predict what he would do, and there were no spiritual yuan fluctuations either.

Long Juncang sat at the top of the ancient races because he was a true expert with endless combat experience. He was proficient in the Xuan Beasts’ divine abilities and the human race’s magical arts. But he had never faced an opponent like Wilde.

An idiot who relied purely on brute power to randomly swing his club. He practically ignored Long Juncang’s attacks, looking like he wanted to be beaten.

There were several times where Long Juncang had had a chance to launch a heavy blow on Wilde, but he couldn’t. Wilde’s fighting style was one where he was happy to be struck as long as he could strike back. The winner would be the one whose body was tougher.

Even Long Juncang didn’t dare to receive one of Wilde’s berserk swings. He had thought about it several times but always switched to defense. In fact, once, due to that hesitation, his shoulder was struck and turned into a bloody pulp.

Long Juncang was in an awkward position now. He regretted coming out to help the Xuan Beasts as he was simply embarrassing himself.

He could only defend against these wild and shameless attacks, unless he was willing to be struck. But that would risk his life. How could the leader of the ancient races, a Netherpassage expert of the third step, really be willing to risk his life just to kill a fool?

Although he was infuriated, Long Juncang couldn’t do anything. Wilde would occasionally take a few bites of True Immortal Jiaoqi’s corpse before continuing to fight. It was like he would never run out of energy.

No one came to help him. They were blocked by Qu Jianying and the others. If they chose to fight as well, it would definitely be a bloody battle where countless people died. That wasn’t what they wanted.

They were all stuck watching. Yu Xiaoyun and the others could only hope for Ji Wuming to turn things around.

As for the Unfettered Allseer, they had no hope for him. They simply wished for him to last a bit longer so that the rest of the Dragonblood Legion couldn’t go assist Long Chen. The Dragonblood Cross Slash had been truly terrifying.

No one could view the members of the Dragonblood Legion as simple Life Star disciples any longer. They were too terrifying.

If it was a one against one, Yu Xiaoyun was sure that Long Chen would die to Ji Wuming’s sword. There was a qualitative difference between the two. The difference between Ji Wuming and the Unfettered Allseer didn’t stop just at one being a deputy.

Ji Wuming was looking at Long Chen. He didn’t even bother looking at the Unfettered Allseer. “Your final words are meaningless. The only thing I’m still pondering is how to make you suffer. Perhaps I’ll kill everyone you care about in front of you? I heard your father, mother, and little sister are in the Wine God Palace. Perhaps I should think of a way to lure them out and let them die in front of you as well.”

A cold smile crept over Long Chen’s face. He shook his head. “You don’t need to worry about such things. Do you really think you can beat me? Do you not know that it’s still unknown whether or not you’ll live to see the sun tomorrow?”

If it was in the past, Long Chen would be infuriated at such provocations. But this time, Long Chen found it somewhat laughable.

Ji Wuming was angered by this indifference. The anger and fear he had expected to see never appeared. He wanted to give Long Chen more pain, but he found that it wasn’t happening. His Fantasy Star Sword suddenly lit up.

“The ignorant have no fear. You will never know how great the power of an inherited divine item is. This power is enough to cause the world to shake. When you destroyed the Heaven Suppressing Magic Sect, it was because their sect leader didn’t have the ability to activate the karmic luck within their divine item. Today, I’ll let you see just how great the power of a divine item is when it is unleashing the karmic luck accumulated by its sect.”

Heaven and earth shook. A starry sky appeared behind Ji Wuming. The world shook as the Daos and laws of the world actually converged around Ji Wuming.

“Ji Wuming is actually unleashing all the karmic luck belonging to Heavenly Fate Island! Long Chen’s in danger!”

This power had nothing to do with his cultivation base. This was the energy that generations of experts of Heavenly Fate Island had accumulated. It wasn’t something that a human could block. It would require another core divine item to activate their karmic luck as well.

An ordinary sect definitely couldn’t do such a thing. After all, that karmic luck decided the rise or fall of a sect. But Ji Wuming no longer had such concerns.

“Long Chen, you are an ant. Go in peace. I’ll make sure that everyone you care about is sent after you!” Ji Wuming slashed his sword.

The Sword Qi sliced through the clouds, causing heaven and earth to shake. He eagerly awaited the look of despair on Long Chen’s face. He wanted to enjoy that sight.

Long Chen pressed his forehead and extracted a drop of blood. He placed that blood on Evilmoon.

“Evilmoon, I’ll undo your seal. If you don’t kill him, I’ll look down on you for a lifetime.”
