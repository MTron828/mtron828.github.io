Chapter 2434 Unknown Lifeforms

Translator: BornToBe

Chu Yao, Tang Wan-er, Ye Zhiqiu, and the others all led their groups through the portal one by one.

“Senior Pill Doyen, I wish to enter on my own. Is that possible?” asked Long Chen.

“Of course. It’s no trouble at all, and there’s no need to wait to store up spatial energy. However, entering on your own means less karmic luck. Something bad might be waiting for you on the other side,” warned the Pill Doyen.

“Yes, I’ve thought it through.” Long Chen nodded. He knew that even if he had other people supporting him with their karmic luck, something bad would still be waiting for him.

As if understanding his misgivings, the Pill Doyen said, “Then be careful. After the next batch, you can directly enter.”

With every batch of people, a brief pause was required for the spatial gate to store up energy. But one person entering didn’t require that much energy, so Long Chen could directly enter.

“Many thanks.” Long Chen cupped his fists and bowed slightly toward the Pill Doyen. He exchanged a glance with Mo Nian behind him.

He had discussed it with Mo Nian already. Mo Nian would stay behind until the last batch.

Once half the Martial Heaven Alliance’s warriors had entered, Long Chen stepped inside as well.

As soon as he did, he felt a violent suction pull him in. The pull was so strong that he felt like his physical body was about to be torn apart.

By entering on his own, the pressure was concentrated on him. Without others sharing the pressure, it was unknown just how many people would be able to survive this like him.

He felt like he had been sucked into the eye of a hurricane. Space was twisting around him, pulling him through a channel.

Suddenly, the force vanished. He found himself falling into an unknown world. The fluctuations of this world were extremely foreign. They were berserk and chaotic.

He was falling so fast that he couldn’t even stabilize. He smashed into the ground, leaving a giant hole.

“Eh? What’s this?” Long Chen realized that he had smashed into something specific. When he looked around, his hair stood on end.

There was a giant spider beneath him. He had landed on its head.

“A peak twelfth rank Magical Beast!”

Long Chen’s heart thumped. This beast’s aura was filled with decay and darkness. It was different from the Magical Beasts, demonic beasts, or even the Nether beasts that he knew. But the feeling it gave off was definitely terrifying.

“Kuliguala…”

Suddenly, strange shouts rang out. Long Chen’s divine sense swept out, only to find that there was a group of strange lifeforms around him. They looked similar to humans, but they had bone spurs growing out of their backs. They had no hair, their upper bodies had no flesh, and their skin was black. They were pointing bone spears at him.

At this moment, Long Chen realized that he had fallen onto a sacrificial altar on the spider’s head. These strange lifeforms were shouting at him, and based on their furious expressions, they weren’t friendly.

“What are you shouting for? I am a god who came to lead you to godhood! Shouldn’t you kneel and accept my guidance?” shouted Long Chen, putting on an untouchable air.

Suddenly, the ground beneath him shook. Long Chen was flung into the sky. The spider beneath him was enraged.

“Ligu!” Those lifeforms shot toward him furiously.

“Idiots, do you not want to become gods?!” shouted Long Chen.

Either these lifeforms didn’t understand him, or they didn’t believe him. In any case, their spears were an instant away from piercing his body.

Long Chen punched the closest bone spear, and the lifeform holding it had his arms explode. Long Chen wrested the bone spear away from it.

“Stop!” shouted Long Chen. But those lifeforms ignored him, their attacks continuing.

He hadn’t wanted to slaughter them, but he was unable to communicate with them. Their killing intent was also starting to enrage him.

Hence, he swept the bone spear in the air in front of him, sending a wave of power that blew away those lifeforms.

They were startled, seemingly not having expected him to be so powerful. In truth, they were very powerful. Even though he couldn’t sense their auras, their power was comparable to an average third step Netherpassage expert. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

Long Chen had no idea how they cultivated. He had no way to use the Martial Heaven Continent’s methods to deduce their cultivation bases.

“Luyiba!”

One lifeform covered in flickering golden marks suddenly rushed over.

Long Chen snorted and smashed the spear down. His spear exploded, but he managed to knock that lifeform away. Surprisingly, its spear was completely fine. Long Chen guessed that their bone spears were their special weapons. He couldn’t unleash its full power.

“Stop! I don’t want to fight you!” shouted Long Chen, gesturing to stop.

However, that lifeform didn’t care. Seeing that he didn’t have a weapon, it pounced once more.

At the same time, dozens of other similar lifeforms came rushing over, surrounding Long Chen.

“Fine. If we can’t talk reasonably, we can talk with our fists.”

Long Chen was finally enraged. His first instinct was that these lifeforms were capable of intelligent communication, but they refused to do so. He had endured it several times, and now he was done.

These golden-marked lifeforms could just barely be counted as having reached the level of a fourth step Netherpassage expert. Long Chen didn’t view them as opponents.

Long Chen directly reached out and grabbed the first spear to reach him. The wielder’s eyes changed color, and some strange syllables came from its mouth. Long Chen guessed that it was cursing him.

In any case, Long Chen first grabbed the spear and then slapped it in the wielder’s face.

That lifeform’s face collapsed, and it was sent flying.

Long Chen was startled. He realized that all their power was concentrated into their skeletons, or more accurately, their marrow. Now he knew why their weapons were these bone spears. They must be their life weapons.

Long Chen grabbed the bone spear and swung it at the other lifeforms. This time, he used the power of his astral spaces. As a result, the bone spear exploded midway.

Despite that, a wave of power erupted, sending the other lifeforms tumbling back.

He was about to continue speaking when his expression suddenly changed. He instinctively dodged to the side.

A black bone spear pierced through the space that he had just been. It grazed his ribs, leaving a long wound.

Even before his blood began to flow out, it began to congeal. The wound also turned black, with the surrounding skin becoming petrified.

“Poison.” Long Chen was startled and even further angered. He had been hoping to scare them off at first, but now he wanted their lives.

This bone spear had come silently, but Long Chen knew that it had come from the spider. He recognized its aura.

The other lifeforms cheered upon seeing Long Chen injured. Hundreds of them attacked at the same time.

“Fools. Since you all want to die so much, I’ll grant your wish.”

Evilmoon appeared in Long Chen’s hand, and he cut off the flesh that was being petrified. It was as hard as stone now.

This was a strange energy. If the spear had struck his vitals, it would have been troublesome.

“You deserve it.” Evilmoon actually added oil to the flames of Long Chen’s anger. It would rather have killed all these lifeforms on first contact. Everything would have been over.

“Split the Heavens 8!”

A saber-image swept through the air, going horizontally. Any lifeforms touched by it were blasted to smithereens. Blood mist filled the air.
