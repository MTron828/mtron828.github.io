Chapter 2574 World Divine Item

It was Daoist Heavenly Feather who had interfered. She had received and destroyed that divine item with her bare hands.

As a result, the elder of the Blood race coughed up a mouthful of blood. The destruction of this divine item caused him a significant injury.

“Shameless Blood race, you act so high and mighty while always doing these shameful things!” Long Chen roared. At this moment, lightning exploded out of him, and he charged toward the Blood race’s army.

“Courting death! Kill him!” Seeing Long Chen charging at their army of millions all by himself, all the Blood race’s experts were infuriated.

Long Chen was looking down on them. This was an unacceptable insult.

The Blood race man that Long Chen had injured had barely recovered, but he couldn’t hold his emotions back. With a furious roar, he slashed using a broadsword that appeared in his hands.

At the same time, dozens of other experts from the Blood race also attacked. Every one of those attacks was exceptionally sharp.

“All of you can come together. When have I ever been afraid of you?” Battle intent soared out of Long Chen.

“Ignorant arrogance!” The Blood race’s experts were incensed, never having met such a wildly arrogant person.

BOOM!

Long Chen’s saber swept through, blasting apart the dozens of attacks coming toward him. Sword Qi, spear-images, astral winds, they were all cut in two along with their attackers.

This attack from Long Chen contained his domineering will, along with a dark aura that made his enemies shiver.

After all, amongst those attackers was one on the level of a Sovereign sprout. Even so many of them were unable to receive his attack.

“Hahaha, we’ve finally reached the threshold of man and saber being one! Long Chen, remember this feeling. When our power merges, it grows far stronger!” Evilmoon laughed, feeling extremely pleased.

In all its fights alongside Long Chen, it had felt extremely stifled because Long Chen was too weak to draw out its power.

Now that Long Chen had changed the cultivation technique of the Nine Star Hegemon Body Art, their power was slowly matching up. This cooperation resulted in a subtle, marvelous change, and that uninhibited feeling made Evilmoon incomparably excited

The saber swept through the rank of the Blood race, slaughtering them. At this moment, chaos reigned. They wanted to charge over at him, but with so many of them against one person, they would be unable to unleash their full power. That would only create more chaos.

“Arrogant brat, die!”

A bone staff with a strange glow to it suddenly pierced toward Long Chen’s chest. A violent bloodline pressure changed the color of heaven and earth.

This was a Heaven Merging expert, and he had been forced to interfere because no one here could suppress Long Chen in the same realm.

Long Chen then blocked with Evilmoon. Just as he had expected, the Blood race’s Heaven Merging experts controlled a strange kind of power capable of erasing a portion of his and Evilmoon’s power. After the clash, the bone staff was not broken but was forced aside, revealing an old and ugly Blood race elder with yellow fangs. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

“Scram! Are you trying to make me nauseous?” Long Chen felt a wave of revulsion at being so close to that old face, and he casually swung his hand.

At this moment, the Blood race elder was about to follow up with another attack, but Long Chen’s slap had landed on his face. As a result, his yellow fangs soared through the air, while he shot back like a shooting star.

Startled cries rang out as he smashed through the army, killing quite a few of them who were unable to dodge in time.

Long Chen then raised his hand, condensing a blooming giant flame lotus. Sacred chanting filled the air.

“Come. Since it’s our first time meeting, it would be rude not to give you a gift. I’ll give you a red flower.” Long Chen smiled sinisterly.

As soon as the World Extermination Flame Lotus appeared, the Blood race’s army reacted. “Disrupt him!”

They could already sense the danger of the flame lotus, so they charged at Long Chen. A pair of lightning wings then appeared on Long Chen’s back, but just as he was about to move, his smile stiffened. The world instantly turned silent.

Suddenly, pain wracked his body. A blood-colored spear had struck like a viper, piercing through his body. After that, his body instantly withered, and he fell into absolute darkness.

“Not good!” Long Chen quivered. He woke from what felt like a nightmare, and a sense of absolute danger overwhelmed him.

Although the flame lotus had yet to reach anywhere near its peak size, Long Chen had no choice but to toss it in front of him.

BOOM!

Flames exploded, but those flames merely existed for a single ripple before being extinguished.

Following that, a sharp aura locked onto Long Chen that turned him ice-cold. He was locked down, and most shocking of all, he was unable to sense where this attack was coming from.

In that instant, it felt like he had been stripped naked and was standing on a frozen wasteland, with all his weak spots exposed to his enemies.

“Steady yourself and sense carefully,” reminded Evilmoon.

Long Chen clenched Evilmoon. He suddenly let out a cry, slashing Evilmoon in a certain direction.

As a result, his slash struck nothing. A hand then pushed him aside, and an explosion blew up the void.

An ice crystal exploded, filling the world with frost. The Blood race’s experts were forced to hastily retreat to avoid this terrifying Ice Qi.

Within the flying ice, Long Chen had been pushed outside of the realm of the Yin Yang World by Daoist Heavenly Feather.

“Senior, you…” Long Chen saw one of Daoist Heavenly Feather’s arms injured. The sleeve was gone, and blood was dripping down.

“It’s fine.” Daoist Heavenly Feather quickly recovered. Ice grew over her injured arm, and new white robes appeared. Her robes were actually condensed of ice energy.

However, although she said that she was fine, Long Chen clearly sensed that her aura was fluctuating. This injury was not a light one.

“As expected, the Blood race’s world divine item has already come. Without one of the five supreme divine items, no one can block this kind of attack,” said Daoist Heavenly Feather, seemingly having expected this.

“Despicable human race, if you have the guts, come out and fight!” The Blood race’s experts immediately started to get arrogant once they had forced Long Chen and Daoist Heavenly Feather to retreat.

The Blood race was truly sinister. They had activated this terrifying divine item behind their own backs, injuring Daoist Heavenly Feather. It seemed that they had won back a bit of face.

It was no wonder Daoist Heavenly Feather had pushed him aside. That attack had made Long Chen see a scene of his own death. It was capable of even injuring Daoist Heavenly Feather.

The arrogant shouting of the Blood race immediately made Long Chen react. He waved his hand, tossing out a dozen metal balls.

“You didn’t want my little flower, so I’ll give you a few beads. You can string them into a bracelet.”

Those metal balls were quite refined and covered in intricate carvings. If placed in a large hall, they would definitely have value as ornaments.

“Who would want your trash things?” sneered the Blood race’s experts. They didn’t believe that Long Chen would send them something good, so they launched their attacks.

Suddenly, those metal balls accelerated, dodging those attacks. Like a slippery fish, they wove through them.

These metal balls were specially made by Guo Ran for Long Chen. In order to match his status, every one of them was built with only the highest class materials.

Furthermore, spiritual runes had been carved onto them so that Long Chen could control their flight. They were specially made for Long Chen, as only Spiritual Strength on his level could control such heavy things.

Originally, Guo Ran had made them for Long Chen as a life-saving measure. It wasn’t necessarily to save himself but for the Dragonblood Legion. The Dragonblood Legion would encounter many great battles in the future, and if their enemies were too concentrated, launching one of these would instantly reduce the pressure.

However, in his fury, Long Chen had tossed out a dozen of these life-saving measures.

Some of the Blood race’s experts were shouting. Even if they were fools, they would be able to tell that this was nothing good. Some tried to catch the balls and toss them away. Some fled.

“Explode!”

Long Chen shouted, and those metal balls suddenly lit up with a light brighter than the sun.

As they exploded, countless leaf-sized blades shot out, rapidly spinning. Even divine items were instantly severed by their power.

At this moment, countless screams ripped through the air. Many of them were only injured, but the blades also had the venom of the poison dragons on them. So even if they didn’t instantly die, they were quickly poisoned to death.

With just a dozen metal balls, all the Blood race experts within ten thousand miles were wiped out. The Blood race’s army roared furiously.

“Want to fight? Come at me!” Long Chen pointed Evilmoon at the Blood race’s army.
