Chapter 4399 The Overture of Slaughter

Long Chen and Little Crane had gone to the side to talk, not impeding people from using the transportation formation.

However, it seemed that this stranger found them displeasing and wanted to stir trouble, casually sending a kick their way.

Enraged at being interrupted while conversing with Little Crane, Long Chen retaliated. Without even turning around, he caught that person’s leg and delivered a powerful kick to their crotch.

In an instant, blood spattered, and the person screamed in agony as their leg was forcibly torn off.

“Are you afraid?” asked Long Chen softly to Little Crane.

“I’m not afraid. I know that Big Brother Long Chen will protect me!” declared Little Crane.

“Do you feel that he is pitiable?” asked Long Chen.

“No. They are all bad people, having an evil and brutal air around them. They’ll only make the majority of people more evil.” Little Crane shook her head.

Long Chen instantly smiled and kissed Little Crane’s forehead. He softly said, “Your mom was right. There are kind people in this world who will never have their kind nature change no matter how other people hurt them. I’ve seen them, and I like them. That’s why I feel like I should protect kindness, so they don’t keep getting hurt. But if I want to protect them, then I can’t be kind. I would rather turn into a fiend myself as long as I can protect them.”

“Hehe, if Big Brother Long Chen is willing, then I can do that as well! I like Big Brother, no matter if Big Brother Long Chen is good or bad!” said Little Crane.

“You damn human, you are courting death!”

A furious roar echoed, and a sharp sword swung toward Long Chen. The person Long Chen had kicked away earlier had returned.

This time, Long Chen turned around, discarding the severed leg in his hand, and raised his own hand in response.

With a metallic ringing, the sword was firmly caught in Long Chen’s hand, and only then did Long Chen eye the expert in front of him.

“So it’s the Blood race. Enemies really do meet often.”

Long Chen saw that this person was a Triple Supreme of the Blood race. The latter was a powerful expert, but when his sword struck Long Chen’s hand, his entire arm went numb, and his upper body no longer listened to him. Despite his attempts to retract his sword, it seemed to have taken root in Long Chen's hand.

The commotion immediately attracted the attention of numerous experts, and a crowd swiftly gathered to witness the unfolding spectacle.

This was Silver Moon City, a city already steeped in chaos. Random skirmishes like this were a common occurrence, quickly attracting onlookers.

“Haha, so it’s a brat of the human race. Interesting. Hey, Blood race fellow, surely you can put this human in his place, can't you?” taunted a spectator from the crowd.

“Exactly. If you can’t even deal with a human, you should just kill yourself. Your Blood race shouldn’t bear such embarrassment.”

Most of the onlookers weren't humans, and witnessing a human daring to fight back, they eagerly added fuel to the fire.

“Human brat, don’t listen to them. I think you can do it, so work hard and kill him. If you succeed, I might consider making you my battle pet.” Someone gave encouragement to Long Chen, but it was extremely insulting. Long Chen’s expression grew colder.

Originally, he had been in a good mood, engaged in a conversation with Little Crane. But as always, people just had to spoil his moments of joy.

It was akin to Long Chen craving a meal, only for people to intentionally smear their snot all over his food to disgust him to death.

Feeling infuriated, the Blood expert let out a short cry and summoned his manifestation.

In truth, for him to summon his manifestation first already signified that he had lost. However, he could no longer bother with such a thing.

Just as everyone thought that Long Chen would be suppressed by this manifestation, the weapon in his hand suddenly snapped.

The broken end of the sword swung through the air, cutting apart the very heavens. That Blood race expert instantly stiffened.

Following that, a line of blood gradually appeared, going down his forehead, nose, mouth, throat, chest, and stomach. He slowly split apart along with his manifestation. At that instant, countless people were stunned. Long Chen not only cleaved the Blood race expert in two but also bisected his manifestation.

The two halves of his manifestation suddenly exploded, and his corpse fell limply to the ground, staining it with fresh blood.

The experts who had come to watch were all dumbfounded. A single blow from Long Chen left them in a state of shock.

“Who was it that wanted me as a battle pet?” Long Chen turned towards the crowd.

Hearing this, that expert instantly quivered with terror and directly fled.

The broken end of the sword suddenly transformed into a shooting star, piercing the back of his head. He didn’t even have the time to grunt before collapsing to the ground, lifeless. He couldn't be more dead.

“Did you say that the human race is inferior?”

A seven-color sword then materialized in Long Chen’s hand. With a slash, a flying rainbow was unleashed, turning the one speaking into blood mist.

“Were you the one speaking sarcastically?”

Long Chen slashed his sword again, and though his target managed to take out a shield, it proved futile. He exploded along with his shield.

That shield was nothing more than a World Domain divine item, so how could it possibly block Long Chen’s attack?

Well, speaking sarcastically didn't require any ability or qualifications. Anyone with a mouth could do it. These individuals were far from possessing the power of the Blood race expert, not even fit to carry Long Chen’s shoes.

Yet, it was people like them who enjoyed talking the most. It was their way of asserting their existence. This great ability of theirs also gave a deeper meaning to the expression, “trouble comes from the mouth.”

Long Chen pointed several times, and dozens of experts fell to the ground, bloody holes appearing in their heads.

The crowd was so scared that they fled in a panic. They didn’t want to keep watching, not knowing whether Long Chen would settle a debt with them next.

“Master is mighty!” Bally exclaimed from behind Long Chen, a face appearing on its surface. It was a flabby face brimming with worship at this moment.

Only now did Bally realize how formidable Long Chen was. Its survival was really a blessing from the heavens.

“Little human, you dare to run wild here? Let me see just how many heads you have to-”Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

As another lifeform roared with fury in the distance, Long Chen unleashed the Seven Peak Sword. People didn't even catch a glimpse of the speaker before they were turned into a blood mist.

The Seven Peak Sword reappeared in Long Chen’s hand. With it, he strolled calmly into Silver Moon City.

“Little human race? Inferior human race? Just who gave you the guts to call the human race like that?”

Long Chen’s black robes and long hair fluttered as he approached Silver Moon City. He resembled a death god, and his footsteps played the overture of slaughter.
