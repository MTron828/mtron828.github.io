Chapter 4747 Preparing to Move Out

“Everyone, prepare yourselves. We’re going to move out in half a day!” announced Bai Zhantang.

“What about the head academy? If we all leave, won’t this place become an empty space?” asked Bai Xiaole worriedly.

The grand formation had just been pierced, and restoring it was something that required time and effort. If their elites all left, the academy would be in a vulnerable position.

“Don’t worry. As long as a certain person is present, the High Firmament Academy’s safety is not in question,” replied Bai Zhantang with a smile.

The sweeping elder’s figure instantly appeared in Long Chen’s mind. However, he couldn’t imagine the sweeping elder interfering in anything.

“But I’ve never seen the sweeping elder fight!” retorted Bai Shishi.

“The sweeping elder naturally won’t fight. However, if the academy’s life and death is in question, he will definitely stop it. That’s enough about that. Get ready! Bring what you can. After all, no one knows when we’ll be back,” ordered Bai Zhantang.

Everyone’s hearts shook, and they quickly returned to their residences, bringing whatever they could bring. Now that they were about to leave the academy, they suddenly felt reluctant. After all, many people had lived so long, treating this place as their home.

When Bai Zhantang’s orders spread, the entire High Firmament Academy became a bustling mess. However, this time, the ones entering the Sovereign Emperor Heaven would only be Divine Venerates.

Bai Zhantang said that people who had not reached that realm would have great difficulty enduring the sudden pressure of that world’s laws, and they might just be throwing away their lives.

However, there was also no rush for disciples beneath the Divine Venerate realm. Once they advanced, the world gate would be fully stabilized. So, even without the academy helping them pass through, they would be able to enter the Sovereign Emperor Heaven freely.

The weaker disciples could only watch as their senior apprentice-brothers and sisters excitedly got to work, and they were all envious.

On the other hand, many experts of the senior generation didn’t wish to leave despite their cultivation bases being high enough. After all, they had lived long enough and had lost the drive of youth. They knew that even if they entered the Sovereign Emperor Heaven, they wouldn’t advance further.

Rather than risking their lives in the Sovereign Emperor Heaven, they were happy to simply grow old in the academy. To put it frankly, time had worn away at their sharpness. They no longer had the energy for more adventures.

The determined disciples wasted no time and quickly got to work. Despite being aware of the dangers awaiting them in the Sovereign Emperor Heaven, and the possibility of never returning, they harbored no regrets.

Like a horse unable to gallop on a narrow path, or a Great Peng spreading its wings in disdain of the low heavens, these young individuals displayed an astonishing enthusiasm and determination to confront the oncoming challenges. Those dangers were unable to stop them from advancing forward.

With only half a day at their disposal, many disciples took mere minutes to pack their belongings. They swiftly made their way to transportation formations, returning to their homes, saying their potential final goodbyes to their families and those they cared about.

No one could predict whether this farewell would truly be the last. To avoid having any lingering regrets, they embraced one last opportunity for a heartfelt reunion with their families.

“Once we’re in the Sovereign Emperor Heaven, the name of Guo Ran will rise above the masses! This time, I definitely won’t lose to Mo Nian!” Guo Ran’s excited shout came from the Dragonblood Legion’s mountain peak.

“You should calm down. You’ve just finished your sabers, chestplate, and back protector. The helmet still isn’t finished, and you don’t have embryonic forms of the other parts yet,” reminded Xia Chen. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

During this time, Guo Ran had been busy forging weapons for everyone, so he had only done those few pieces of armor.

“What’s there to be afraid of? Even without my battle armor, as long as I don’t encounter a monster like Wu Hun, not many people can break my Dragon Blood Battle Armor!” Guo Ran patted his chest confidently.

Long Chen sat in a small pavilion, packing with Bai Shishi and Yu Qingxuan in a relaxed fashion. Hearing Guo Ran’s shout, Long Chen shouted out the window, “Guo Ran, I’m curious, how did you make the hidden dragon cooperate with you?”

When Guo Ran withstood the attack of the Lifehunter race’s Sage King and unleashed his own Split the Heavens, Long Chen was really shocked. This fellow was always able to pull off inconceivable things.

“Hehe, that’s because I understand the hidden dragon all too well. It’s even lazier than I am. I’ve discussed things with it, and I won’t let myself be in real danger that much. So, it’s given me ninety percent of its dragon blood power. If I do encounter danger, it will wake up and that sealed ten percent will ignite the full power of my battle armor. It’s enough for me to escape. That’s why it’s snoring deep in my soul,” replied Guo Ran with a pleased laugh.

“It trusts you that much? You might understand it, but it also understands you. I don’t believe that you could trick it so easily,” commented Long Chen.

“It really is hard to trick. That’s why I’ll speak to it through my power, hahaha!” laughed Guo Ran.

Long Chen was speechless. When did this fellow learn how to keep others in suspense? It seemed that Guo Ran was hiding something that he didn’t want to tell others. With Long Chen’s understanding of him, this fellow had definitely gained quite a few trump cards.

Otherwise, the hidden dragon wouldn’t be willing to risk itself. It had definitely seen something from Guo Ran that made it feel safe enough. That was why it was willing to entrust its power to him.

Long Chen chatted a bit with Guo Ran and the others. When he returned home, he felt speechless. The entire room was bare. Seeing Long Chen’s speechless expression, Bai Shishi laughed, “Big Sister Qingxuan said that she’s worried you’ll feel out of place in the Sovereign Emperor Heaven, so we’re going to bring everything over. That way, you’ll feel that it’s exactly the same home over there.”

At first, she was laughing delightedly. However, when she mentioned home, she blushed slightly, a certain warmth appearing in her eyes.

The mention of home stirred Long Chen's emotions deeply. Countless images flashed through his mind, particularly of the warmth he had felt in a run-down noble estate in the Phoenix Cry Empire.

Long Chen instantly thought of Long Tianxiao, Mrs. Long, and Long Xiaoyu. Long Chen hadn’t dared to even think about them because he missed them too much. But now, after so many years had passed, he couldn't help but wonder about their well-being.

Guo Ran and the others were chatting excitedly when they suddenly let out startled cries. “Sweeping elder!”

Long Chen also jumped and hastily rushed out to greet him.
