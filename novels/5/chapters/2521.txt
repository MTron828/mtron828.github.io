Chapter 2511 Darkness Swallows the Heavens

BOOM!

Ye Ming was sent flying by Long Chen’s saber.

“Your barrier’s destroyed. Why don’t you show me your skills that let you become a god?”

Long Chen snorted and pressed onward, not giving Ye Ming any breathing room. Ye Ming rapidly retreated off of the altar.

“You think I’m afraid of you? Hahaha, what a joke!” Ye Ming suddenly laughed. “Whether it’s Yun Tian or you, you really overestimate yourselves. I underwent nirvanic rebirth just to gain the ability to perfectly control dark energy and make up for my shortcomings. Now that I’ve obtained the source energy of the Heaven Devouring Fiend King, my dark energy has been perfected. I’ve reached my goal. There is no longer anyone in this world that can stop me. The only reason I fled here was to bait all of you into a deathtrap.”

“What a joke. If you were that strong, you wouldn’t need to set up barriers to stop me. If it wasn’t for Zhao Ritian, Feng Fei, and Yu Qingxuan, you would already be dead to Yun Tian’s sword. Now you’re even boasting shamelessly. Does that have any meaning?” Long Chen sneered. His dragon scales lit up, and a dragon roar rang out as he slashed his saber again.

“Since you’re so foolish, I won’t bother explaining things to you. I’ll show you how strong a body of darkness is.”

Darkness exploded out of Ye Ming’s back, looking like a black hole in the void. The space behind him was an abyss of death.

His jagged sword unleashed an evil air, its edges like the teeth of a demonic fiend. At the same time, countless wailing screams came out of the sword.

“Heaven Devouring Domain? Hmph, it’s child’s play in front of me. You dare to take it out and embarrass yourself?” sneered Long Chen. These words weren’t from him but from Evilmoon.

“Big words from one so foolish.” Ye Ming snorted and slashed his sword. The black hole behind him unleashed a ripple, supporting him.

“You’re the foolish one.”

Long Chen’s saber slashed down, and more and more runes lit up on Evilmoon’s blade. A black qi also erupted out of it.

The two black divine weapons clashed together, unleashing an explosion of black qi that devoured all the light within this world.

Within this darkness was a black sphere that swelled up rapidly. At the center of it, the two divine weapons were touching. Both divine weapons were unleashing their core energy and trying to suppress each other.

The sphere exploded like a star. But despite that giant explosion, the giant tree was not shaken. Only the branches waved slightly.

“If you didn’t have dark energy, killing you would be as easy as turning a hand. But even if you have dark energy, so what? In the end, your dark energy isn’t your own, while my dark energy is limitless. How are you supposed to fight with me?” sneered Ye Ming. “This place is where the fiend king died. In order to extend his power, he transformed all his subordinates’ life energy into dark energy. I have already absorbed the seed of the fiend king’s soul essence and am the master of this place. All the energy here belongs to me. As for you? Once your weapon’s dark energy is exhausted, I will take your life.”

“The more arrogant you act, the more it shows how nervous you are. You try to antagonize me and disturb my thoughts in fear that I’ll see through your scheme. You really did waste a whole lifetime. Do you not know that in front of absolute power, all schemes are nonsense?” Long Chen attacked with Evilmoon once more.

This darkness made him lose his senses. He couldn’t see, hear, smell, or feel. His divine sense could not extend past his body. This was a terrifying death domain.

It could be said that within Ye Ming’s domain, a person would become blind and unable to sense his location.

It was only because of Evilmoon who was in possession of dark energy as well that he didn’t need to fear this kind of bewilderment.

Explosions continued to echo within the darkness. But from the outside, it merely appeared as if a giant black sphere was shuddering. It was impossible to see the inside.

In the distance, the golden giant that Zhao Ritian had manifested into was fighting Wilde. The two of them were clashing so intensely that the world shuddered. It was a true competition of power.

Mo Nian was exploding with divine energy as he fought Feng Fei in the sky. The two of them were still in a stalemate.

Feng Fei’s gaze was icy with killing intent, and the cries of a phoenix echoed from within her manifestation. Her sword flowed smoothly like water, constantly striking toward Mo Nian’s vitals without the slightest mercy.

Within the Brahma Divine Diagram, Yun Tian was fighting the Pill Fairy. With the Daynight Furnace, the Pill Fairy was like an ephemeral ghost, dodging Yun Tian’s sword attacks. She was only intent on trapping him here.

At this moment, the Dragonblood Legion finally managed to charge through the Black Armor Corps. It had taken an hour.

“Support Wilde! Cut down that Zhao Ritian and we’ll use the pieces of him to create a new set of armor for everyone!”

When they arrived, Guo Ran instantly set his sights on Zhao Ritian. He liked money, and Zhao Ritian’s giant metal form was made of immortal metal. Furthermore, the ground beneath him had transformed into golden mountains.

That was not just a manifestation but Zhao Ritian’s source energy. He was able to extract the metal energy from the ground.

It also just so happened that Zhao Ritian and Wilde’s battlefield was the closest. There was no need to make any detours. They charged right over.

“Scram, ants!” Zhao Ritian roared furiously. He smashed the Heaven Suppressing Dragon Coiling Rod into the ground.

Countless golden thorns shot out of the ground at the Dragonblood Legion. Zhao Ritian was already close to crazy at having failed to defeat Wilde after so long. He didn’t even place the Dragonblood Legion in his eyes and wanted to kill them all in one move.

This was one of his special techniques that was always effective in group combat. When a person was pierced by one of these thorns, their bodies would become paralyzed and they would be turned into metal before shattering.

“Brothers, grab them!” Guo Ran’s eyes lit up against his expectations. This was his first time seeing so much immortal metal being sent to his door. Dodging the first one, he slashed it with his blood-colored saber.

BOOM!

The giant metal thorn was cut in half and Guo Ran grabbed it. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

“Haha, what pure immortal metal! It’s also an alloy! No wonder he dares to call himself Ritian. If he has this much money, he can do anything!” laughed Guo Ran.

Suddenly, the fragment in Guo Ran’s hand tried to escape his hold. Guo Ran was startled and hastily tossed it into his astral space.

When it entered his astral space, its resistance vanished. This piece of immortal metal became his.

“We’ve struck gold! This is even better than mining! There’s no need for further refinements or purifications!” Guo Ran’s eyes turned red with greed.

The purity of the immortal metal within Zhao Ritian’s attack was extremely high. It could almost be directly forged into weapons.

Although Guo Ran had found quite a few divine ore deposits in the Star Field Divine World, those ores needed to be purified first. Even the ores with the highest purity would normally only have a three in ten thousand purity. As for lower grade ores, their purity was only one in a hundred thousand.

If the purity was any lower, then it was essentially useless. Refining it would not make up for the cost in manpower and resources required for the purified result.

Immortal metal required five purifications in order to just barely reach his standard for forging. Normally, he would require eight purifications to expel most of the impurities. But to push it to the limit would require eighteen purifications or more. But that took too long, so the weapons and armor of the Dragonblood Legion were made from immortal and divine ores that had undergone eight purifications.

However, the fragment of immortal metal that he had just obtained had a purity around eight refinements. It could entirely be used to directly forge weapons.

The reason immortal metal was so precious was because the actual metal only occupied a small portion of the ore. Another reason was due to the immense price of purifying them.

Seeing the countless metal thorns, Guo Ran only had immortal metal dancing in his eyes. Zhao Ritian was a living mountain of precious material.

The Dragonblood warriors began to shatter the metal thorns and gather them. Their swords were being used as picks while the metal thorns piercing toward them were the metal veins. In truth, those metal veins were quite tough. Quite a few of their picks ended up damaged.

However, Guo Ran told everyone not to worry about the damage. The immortal gold that they were obtaining was well worth it.

After all, Zhao Ritian’s immortal metal had hundreds of different kinds mixed in. Although the purity wasn’t the highest, it was definitely worth the money.

“Courting death!”

Zhao Ritian was enraged to see the Dragonblood Legion acting like bandits stealing his gold. They were so fast that he had no time to pull back his immortal gold. He gnashed his teeth.

When his immortal gold entered someone’s astral space, it would become separated from him. He wouldn’t be able to pull it back.

BOOM!

Suddenly, the earth pulled around the Dragonblood Legion like a carpet, suffocating them.

This golden carpet was suddenly sliced apart like a watermelon.

“Zifeng, cut it some more!” exclaimed Guo Ran delightedly. Yue Zifeng’s Sword Qi was truly unstoppable.

Yue Zifeng slashed his sword a few more times, cutting the golden carpet into dozens of pieces that fell from the sky.

“Brothers, grab the gold!” Guo Ran was the first to fly out and suck a giant piece into his astral space.

“Put those down!” Zhao Ritian’s eyes instantly turned red. That was his source immortal gold that he had taken great lengths to procure.

“Get down!” Zhao Ritian had just turned away when Wilde’s door bolt smashed into the back of his head.
