Chapter 2567 The Allure of the Ninth Form of Split the Heavens

“Beauties, I’ve prepared a room for you as well. I’ve already adjusted the dragon blood to your bodies. I guarantee that you will be very comfortable once you enter.” Long Chen opened another door with a dragon pool on the other side. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

“Why aren’t you leaving? Are you thinking of bathing with us?” asked Liu Ruyan lightly.

“Of course. What’s wrong with that?” Long Chen acted surprised.

Meng Qi, Chu Yao, Tang Wan-er, and the others blushed. On the other hand, little Cloud excitedly clapped her hands and began to take off her clothes, only to be stopped by Tang Wan-er.

“If you’re not afraid of me killing you, you can come and try it,” said Liu Ruyan. She actually began to take off her clothes.

“Hmph, don’t try to scare me. You aren’t even… damn.” Long Chen was originally going to say that Liu Ruyan wasn’t even human and was just a wood elemental lifeform. But as her clothes slid off, he saw the jade skin of her back. Even from the side, he could see some vague surging mountains.

“Alright, you have guts.”

Long Chen took a deep breath and walked away. He heard Liu Ruyan’s pleased laughter behind him, with Meng Qi and the others’ laughter coming afterward. It seemed that only Liu Ruyan could scare away Long Chen.

Long Chen cursed. Just what was going on with Liu Ruyan? Wasn’t she a willow tree? How was her flesh so real? He had previously never viewed her as a real woman, but when her clothes slid off her shoulder, he couldn’t help being affected.

Long Chen shook his head. How could a tree move him? He had to have some principles.

He had an urge to slap himself to wake himself up. Expelling those thoughts, he focused on what was important.

The curse on Xia Chen and Guo Ran was real, but it was nowhere near as serious as he had made it out to be. Now that they were back on the Martial Heaven Continent, the curse would be easily erased over time. He had just been scaring Guo Ran and trying to draw out his potential. In truth, it could be said that Guo Ran was the one with the greatest potential in the Dragonblood Legion.

That potential was the result of slacking so much that he had plenty of potential to be excavated. That was why Long Chen wasn’t going to let him slack off again. With Xia Chen to accompany him, Long Chen felt like Guo Ran would persevere.

After arranging the blood pools for everyone, Long Chen came to Qu Jianying’s residence. When he walked into the yard, he saw the old man pruning.

“Hehe, old man, you’re in the mood for gardening so early in the morning?” asked Long Chen.

The old man was quite interesting. He was capable of using his blade to unleash his temper, but he also could use a blade to do such refined work. As expected, the alliance head was amazing.

Seemingly surprised by Long Chen’s arrival, the old man quickly put away the pruner he was using to clean up a sapling. But it was too late. Intentionally acting calm, he said, “What do you know? Cultivating trees is like cultivating the heart. Sometimes stillness is also a kind of Dao. Behind stillness is calm, behind calm is quiet, behind quiet is peace, behind peace is comprehension…”

“I don’t know about stillness or calm, but I do know that you just clipped a three-hundred-year-old Heavenly Violet Star accidentally. Hehe, such a precious flower was destroyed by you…”

The old man looked and realized that just now, while pruning a sapling, he had somehow cut off half of a flower, making it look very ugly.

The old man was enraged. This wasn’t something he was used to, but Qu Jianying had forced him to do it in order to temper his self-discipline.

As a result, not only was he seen by Long Chen, but he had embarrassed himself in front of Long Chen as well.

“Here.” The old man pressed the pruner into Long Chen’s hand.

Long Chen was confused for a moment but then raged, “Old man, after living for so many years, you didn’t develop any integrity?! Do you seriously want me to bear the responsibility for your mistake?”

Long Chen couldn’t believe his eyes. When did the old man become so shameless? He hadn’t been like this before.

“The ninth form of Split the Heavens.” The old man clasped his hands behind him, putting on a solemn expression.

Hearing that, Long Chen’s anger vanished. He put on a fawning expression and then stepped forward, taking over the work of pruning the tree. “Hehe, senior really is the senior. This junior will follow your example. My skill in gardening is too low, causing me to accidentally clip the flower. It seems that I’ll need to learn more from you in the future. I hope to gain some more pointers from you.”

“You pair of shameless scoundrels, stop it!” Qu Jianying’s roar came from inside the house.

Since Long Chen was sucking up and the old man had a pleased expression, Long Chen hadn’t been paying attention to his hands, resulting in this three-foot-tall sapling being reduced to a bare trunk.

After that, a torrent of curses fell upon the two of them. The old man and Long Chen exchanged glares but didn’t say anything. After an hour, the torrent finally passed.

“Old man, are you really going to teach me the ninth form of Split the Heavens?” demanded Long Chen in front of Qu Jianying.

“Don’t be a fool. The ninth form of Split the Heavens cannot be randomly taught,” said Qu Jianying before the old man could even say anything.

“Why not? Am I not strong enough?” asked Long Chen. He had asked the old man many times but had always been refused.

Now, it seemed that the old man was finally ready to teach him, but Qu Jianying didn’t agree.

“The ninth form of Split the Heavens is the pinnacle. Its power is not something that you can imagine. Once used, a person will enter a wild battle state and go crazy. In that state, you won’t be able to control yourself. You will very likely destroy yourself with your own power,” said Qu Jianying.

“I feel like I can control my temper,” said Long Chen.

Qu Jianying cursed, “What control? You were so reckless that you crushed a Sovereign sprout in front of the divine families. Is that something done by someone with control over their temper? You can’t even remain cool-headed normally. In the state of the ninth form, you won’t even be able to differentiate between friend and foe.”

“But the old man…” Long Chen was unconvinced. He had previously seen the old man almost use the ninth form of Split the Heavens. It was nowhere as grave as Qu Jianying described it.

“That is because he would exhaust all his energy using it at once. Either he kills his opponent or he dies, so he won’t have the power for a second attack. Furthermore, even if he does slay his enemy, his own chances of surviving after using it are less than thirty percent. That’s why he doesn’t have to consider what happens next,” said Qu Jianying.

“I feel like I can first teach him the Heavens’ Wrath to see if he can control it. If he can, then I’ll transmit the ninth form,” said the old man.

Qu Jianying was silent for a moment before sighing, “It’s still very dangerous. This little fellow’s temper is something you’re well aware of. But if you’re so set, I’ll respect your opinion.”

“Hehe, many thanks, alliance head. I won’t disappoint you!” said Long Chen immediately, not letting her change her mind.

Long Chen had long since wanted to learn the ninth form of Split the Heavens. But since the old man refused to teach him, he couldn’t do anything. Now that the old man was finally willing to transmit this peerless technique to him, he was incredibly excited.

“Three days from now, come with me to the Heaven Splitting Battle Sect. Then we’ll see,” said the old man.

“Why not start right now?” asked Long Chen impatiently.

“You just experienced a large battle, so your spiritual fluctuations have yet to calm down. In this state, activating the Heavens’ Wrath is too dangerous.” The old man shook his head.

Fine. Although Long Chen was anxious to learn it, it seemed that he would have to wait. The old man patted his shoulder.

“Even at such an age, you can’t calm down a bit? You aren’t able to wait even three days?”

“Are you the one who should be saying these words?” Long Chen curled his lips. The old man was far older, but he had the same temper.

“Do you want to learn the ninth form of Split the Heavens or not?!” raged the old man.

Long Chen just looked at him and didn’t reply. Qu Jianying was between laughter and tears, and she pinched the old man. Long Chen was not wrong at all. For the old man to try to teach others to control their temper was something no one would accept.

Qu Jianying said, “Long Chen, I’m going to bring up a certain matter. Don’t get angry.”

Long Chen smiled. “What is there to get angry about? You wish to draw in those neutral and traitor powers.”

Although Long Chen had been in seclusion, the new wind that had blown across the Martial Heaven Alliance had not escaped him.

He had killed Dongfang Yuyang and Zhao Ritian, as well as fighting against three of the divine families’ Sovereign sprouts at once. He had even exchanged blows with a family head of the divine families.

This was something that affected the entire continent. Because of it, the neutral powers and powers that had left the Martial Heaven Alliance due to the influence of Pill Valley were now being drawn back in.

There was now the High Priest, Daoist Heavenly Feather, and the Music Master supporting the Martial Heaven Alliance. Only now did the public learn that the Martial Heaven Alliance was not as weak as they had thought. Even the Lord Venerate of the divine families had conceded.

With the support of three large forces, the Martial Heaven Alliance was now clearly the main pillar of the continent.

Perhaps even the previous pressure on the alliance had just been an act or maybe a trial.

After realizing these things, those neutral powers and those that had left the Martial Heaven Alliance expressed that they were willing to join.

When those powers had tried to join the Martial Heaven Alliance before, Long Chen had simply told them to scram. The Martial Heaven Alliance did not accept traitors.

However, this time it was different. It wasn’t just the powers that had betrayed them. Even factions that had been neutral the entire time were willing to join.

Just at this moment, the gates opened, and thousands of experts walked into the small yard.
