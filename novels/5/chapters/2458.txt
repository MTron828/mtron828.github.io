Chapter 2448 Magic Trick Transformation

Translator: BornToBe

At the same time as his voice rang out, the person speaking also arrived. A fist covered in dragon scales smashed down with a clap of thunder.

BOOM!

An explosion of power shook the void and caused the earth to tear itself apart. The armored sea demon felt a sharp pain in his fist. With his whole arm numb, he realized that his hand had been split. He fell back.

However, a hand grabbed his wrist. Long Chen snorted coldly and sent a lightning-like kick at his limb.

A cracking sound rang out along with a grunt. The armored sea demon had his arm severed at the shoulder. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

As soon as the arm left the body, it transformed into a giant crab claw. The crab claw was covered in dark gold runes and looked as if it had been cast from metal. Its aura was comparable to a divine item.

However, at this moment, this giant crab claw also had a giant hole in it that caused cracks to spread throughout it.

“No wonder it was so hard.” Long Chen shook out his tingling hand. It seemed that this fellow’s hardest aspect was right here.

“Long Chen!” The sea demons’ expressions all changed. None of them had expected Long Chen to suddenly appear.

“Boss!” The Dragonblood warriors and the Martial Heaven Alliance’s disciples cheered.

“Kill Long Chen with them! He can’t change the tides just by himself!” shouted the sea demon with a severed arm.

A new arm quickly grew out, but it was clearly much weaker.

“Long Chen, since you want to die so badly, don’t blame me.” The Six Horn Sea Serpent recovered from his shock and smiled. There was no turning back at this point.

“Kill!”

Just at this moment, the other group of Dragonblood warriors leading the Xuan Beasts entered the fray.

The Six Horn Sea Serpent man summoned his manifestation, and a sea appeared around him. He attacked with his bone trident. This attack seemed to possess some kind of law, and it froze the space around Long Chen.

The Six Horn Sea Serpent man had launched one of his sharpest killing blows right at the start, not wasting time on any probing blows. Beside him, the snake-eyed man and the armored man also attacked from two different angles.

“It’s not me who wants to die, but you.” Long Chen sneered. Evilmoon slashed toward the bone trident, but just as they were about to clash, Long Chen flipped his blade, receiving it with the back of his saber. He then let go of Evilmoon.

Sparks flew along with an ear-shaking explosion. Evilmoon was sent flying straight toward the snake-eyed man.

The snake-eyed man had been attacking at the same time with a sword, and upon seeing Evilmoon spinning toward him, he slashed his sword at it.

Upon seeing that, the Six Horn Sea Serpent’s expression changed. “Get out of the way!”

He suddenly found that Long Chen had managed to condense his power within his blade while also drawing in the power of his bone trident when he struck it. That explosive power could be considered a combination attack containing both his and Long Chen’s power.

However, his warning was too late. Evilmoon had already spun into the snake-eyed man’s sword.

The sword and the wielder exploded in an instant. He was killed without any suspense.

This attack contained both Long Chen’s power and the Six Horn Sea Serpent’s power. Even Long Chen himself wasn’t able to receive it just like that.

Long Chen could let go of Evilmoon because Evilmoon could control itself. At the same time, Long Chen faced his third opponent, the armored man.

As soon as the armored man saw Long Chen’s gaze turn toward him, he had a bad feeling. Seeing that his comrade was instantly killed, he decided to retreat instead of following through with his punch.

“You really are stupid,” sneered Long Chen.

“Watch out!” The Six Horn Sea Serpent gave another warning. At some point, a giant hole had appeared behind the armored man.

This sudden warning made the bad feeling inside of the armored man intensify. Without thinking he summoned his true form.

However, as he summoned his giant body, the hole grew larger as well, devouring him.

The hole then sealed itself. The Demon Moon Furnace had materialized outside.

The Demon Moon Furnace rumbled as the armored man fought to get out.

“Bastard, release my Heavenly Crab General!” roared the Six Horn Sea Serpent. The snake-eyed man and the armored man were his left and right hands, second only to him within the junior generation of the sea demons.

The two of them were the cornerstones of what he was going to use to crush the Martial Heaven Continent, and the two geniuses he had the highest hopes for. In the blink of an eye, his left hand was dead without a corpse, while his right hand was sealed within a furnace.

He felt like he was going crazy. The two of them were extremely powerful, but they had yet to be able to show any of their true power before Long Chen conned one to death and trapped the other.

BOOM!

The Six Horn Sea Serpent’s trident smashed into the Demon Moon Furnace, sending it flying. However, it wasn’t damaged. There wasn’t even the slightest mark left.

At that moment, Evilmoon flew back into Long Chen’s hand. The Six Horn Sea Serpent continued to attack the Demon Moon Furnace, each attack causing huge ripples to spread throughout the void. It could be seen how powerful his attacks were.

Watching him attack, Long Chen smiled oddly. The Six Horn Sea Serpent wanted to save his right arm, all the while not realizing that every one of his attacks was being transmitted directly into the armored man inside the furnace. Every time he attacked, the armored man would cough up a mouthful of blood.

He was howling, not knowing what was going on outside, but he couldn’t be heard anyway.

Long Chen ignored it as the Six Horn Sea Serpent attacked the Demon Moon Furnace. Instead, he summoned Lei Long.

Lei Long transformed into millions of lightning dragons that ran rampant across the battlefield, completely suppressing the sea demons.

Those who could enter the Star Field Divine World were geniuses amongst geniuses. After splitting its power so much, Lei Long was unable to directly kill them. However, just paralyzing them for a moment was enough.

Lei Long’s lightning was their natural bane. Their resistance toward thunderforce was far lower than that of the lifeforms of the continent. Both humans and Xuan Beasts had greater tolerance to thunderforce than the sea demons.

With their movements turning sluggish on the battlefield where a single blink could cause death, they began to be slaughtered.

The Martial Heaven Alliance’s disciples and the Xuan Beasts were only mildly affected by the lightning in the air. It was at an acceptable level. Hence, the sea demons were instantly hard-pressed, with any superiority they had due to their numbers advantage vanishing.

Long Chen just stood there, not attacking the Six Horn Sea Serpent or the other sea demons. He also didn’t allow Ling-er to kill the armored sea demon that she had trapped. He wanted to see just how long the Six Horn Sea Serpent would continue like this.

In just a short moment, the Six Horn Sea Serpent had attacked the Demon Moon Furnace over a hundred times. The tempo of his attacks and their power truly showed his power.

However, the Demon Moon Furnace was still completely unharmed. Now the Six Horn Sea Serpent was starting to run out of breath.

He finally gave up. He couldn’t break the furnace, so he turned back to Long Chen. He realized that Long Chen was trying to exhaust him so that he wouldn’t be able to escape.

“Long Chen, release my Heavenly Crab General, or the Martial Heaven Continent will face a bloody retribution from the sea demon race. I will use our full power to get revenge. Don’t doubt my determination,” said the Six Horn Sea Serpent furiously. His eyes had strands of blood in them, giving him a frightening appearance.

With a wave of his hand, the sea demons on the battlefield retreated, running behind him. They looked at Long Chen in terror.

The battle had lasted for less than an incense stick’s worth of time, but a third of the sea demons had been obliterated. Lei Long had caused countless casualties amongst them.

The Dragonblood Legion also stopped. They swung the blood off their blades and walked over to Long Chen, staring coldly at the sea demons.

Long Chen beckoned, and the Demon Moon Furnace flew back to his side. Looking directly at the Six Horn Sea Serpent, he said, “You want your crab general? How about I show you a magic trick instead?”

“What are you talking about?” demanded the Six Horn Sea Serpent.

“I can turn him red. Do you believe me?” Long Chen opened the lid. An enormous figure came out, one that caused the Six Horn Sea Serpent’s eyes to turn scarlet.
