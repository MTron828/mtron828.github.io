The Illusive Music Immortal Palace’s experts had come aggressively, but with a single move from Zi Yan, all their heads exploded and their corpses fell lifelessly. As a result, everyone’s jaws dropped.

Even the various Emperors were astonished. How had Zi Yan suddenly changed sides right before the battle?

At this moment, Zi Yan spread her hands, and the slain experts’ Yuan Spirits were all extracted, condensing into her fingertips.

“What is right? What is wrong? In the east, someone told me the real answer. However, at that time, I was ignorant and didn’t understand. Now I understand. To protect those that I love, even if my hands become covered in blood, even if I fall into a bottomless hell afterward, I will not regret it.”

Zi Yan’s hands shone brightly. Looking at that light, she muttered to herself, and her killing intent caused the world to change color.

“AHH!”

Sharp screams suddenly rang out from Zi Yan’s fingertips, including the Music Master’s. At this moment, their Yuan Spirits had been condensed on Zi Yan’s fingertips. They were terrified and unreconciled. But they all knew what was about to happen.

Ignoring their screams, Zi Yan looked into the distance, at Long Chen. She finally smiled faintly.

After that, her white robes exploded and strips of fabric flew through the air like butterflies. A violet dress then appeared beneath the white robes.

In that instant, Zi Yan appeared incredibly like Sovereign Han Wei. Her decisive killing intent shook the heavens.

“Long Chen, because of me, you repeatedly fell into death traps, but you still believed in me. I have no way to repay this favor in this lifetime. All I can do is use this life of mine to thank you.” A hint of warmth glimmered within the killing intent in Zi Yan’s eyes.

After that, Zi Yan’s fingers pressed against the Southern Sea Zither. She plucked a single string, and with that one note, every lifeform of the Martial Heaven Continent felt their heart contract.

It was as if that sound caused their blood to fill their heart, resulting in it growing until it was about to explode.

The sound of a zither then rang out. Suddenly, the invading experts felt as if a volcano had exploded in their chests. They were shocked to find that their hearts had burst inside of them.

“The heavens have a humane heart, the earth has a compassionate heart. When a human has a heart with love, their hearts are complicated. There is the infatuated heart, the greedy heart, the fanatical heart… Endless possibilities confuse right and wrong, mix good and evil…”

Zi Yan murmured. It was like a scripture but wasn’t, like a song but not exactly that. It directly pierced people’s hearts and reached people’s souls, forming a resonance. Her voice questioned them about their own hearts.

As a result, the Martial Heaven Continent’s experts’ hearts trembled. It was as if all their secrets were exposed at this instance.

Zi Yan’s hands continued to play, and screams rang out from the other worlds’ experts. Whether it was the demonic beast race, the Blood race, the devil race, or the Undying race, their experts’ hearts exploded out of their chests.

Although they had the ability to recover, without a heart, their combat power was gravely affected.

The most terrifying thing was that they had no idea what was happening. Zi Yan was injuring them through space, and they couldn’t dodge and defend. This kind of invisible attack was the most frightening.

“The blood of the guilty, black, murderous, vicious, and brutal. The soul of evil, containing greed, jealousy, hatred, and destruction. The Dao of the heavens’ music can be used to destroy evil, eradicate demons, incinerate the blood and soul, play the song of slaughter, become a devil slaughterer, sink forever into the depths of hell, die a hundred deaths with no regrets…”

Zi Yan’s voice rang out as if she was a goddess. Her voice was ice-cold, containing a frightening resolution.

As the zither strings quivered, the void rumbled. The invading experts whose hearts had exploded suddenly clenched their heads, roaring with pain.

Some of them could not endure, and their heads directly exploded.

For a moment, the experts on both sides could only stare in shock.

As Zi Yan continued to play, more and more invaders were killed, their heads exploding.

Hence, in just a few breaths’ time, tens of millions of invaders were wiped out by Zi Yan’s zither music. Their armies collapsed.

This kind of terrifying sound attack had never been seen or heard of before. This Devil Soul Refining Song destroyed hearts and exterminated souls. It was a bizarre power that couldn’t be blocked.

With every note, hundreds of thousands of experts died. Her music filled the world.

“She’s using zither music to invade people’s hearts, using their blood to reach their minds, using their minds to detonate their souls.” The Blood race’s Emperor’s expression changed. The Martial Heaven Continent had never used such a divine art against them before.

At this moment, the world was enveloped by a strange atmosphere. Blood Qi soared and souls wailed. It was like hell on earth.

“Not good. The Blood Qi and soul energy can no longer be absorbed. Kill her!” The devil race’s Emperor suddenly noticed something wrong.

The others also noticed this problem. The only reason that they weren’t fighting themselves was because they wanted the Blood Qi and soul energy of those dying on the battlefield. This energy was what powered their altars and the Heaven Devastating Bracelet.

Other than the Undying race, the others hadn’t finished their preparations. However, since the Undying race had launched the attack ahead of time, they couldn’t just watch as their goal was snatched away. Hence, they launched their own attacks, and the power that they had been accumulating for tens of thousands of years in the form of countless experts charged out. When they died, their lives were taken back as preparation for the killing blow.

However, they were shocked to find that when Zi Yan killed people, their energy simply dissipated, and their altars were unable to absorb it. Not even the Heaven Devastating Bracelet could absorb it.

As Zi Yan continued to play, blood rained down. And in less than ten breaths’ time, millions and millions were killed.

This kind of terrifying, wide-range attack was something that overturned people’s imaginations. Most frightening of all, while it had a terrifying killing power on the invaders, it didn’t affect the Martial Heaven Continent’s experts all that much.

By the time the various Emperors reacted, they had lost a fourth of their armies to Zi Yan’s life-reaping zither music. Her killing power was simply astonishing.

Because of this, the Emperors were no longer able to sit still. If they still didn’t stop Zi Yan, their plans would fail.
