Chapter 3894 Dong Mingyu vs. Ji Wuming

When Dong Mingyu appeared, her appearance remained identical to her presence on the Martial Heaven Continent. Clad in skintight black leather armor, she resembled a sleek leopardess exuding a distinct air of danger and allure.

She was like an elf of the night. Her very appearance caused the world to darken a bit, as if the curtain of night was on the verge of descending. All of a sudden, the world was filled with a shadowy feeling.

“You are Dong Mingyu? The Shadow Sect’s Dong Mingyu?”

Ji Wuming’s pupils shrank immediately. The name "Dong Mingyu'' had been mentioned to him by Enpuda on multiple occasions. Enpuda had repeatedly told him that she was the only person in the same realm capable of killing him.

Previously, Ji Wuming hadn’t cared particularly about her. But with the opening of the three thousand worlds, Enpuda had sternly warned him to be careful of her. Only then did Ji Wuming get a sense of how serious this was.

When that dagger appeared in front of his neck, he didn’t sense it coming at all. If he hadn’t merged his Supreme Blood and Supreme Bone, causing his control over space and time energy to rise to a new level, his head would have left his body.

Ji Wuming was a powerful assassin, the future master of the Bloodkill Hall. He was viewed as the best successor by Enpuda. In fact, his talent in the assassination field might even surpass his master’s. His control over space and time made his perception shockingly sharp.

A sharp perception was many times simply a matter of innate talent, making it difficult to enhance through external means. With that powerful perception, others couldn’t sneak attack him.Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

Moreover, an assassin with sharp perception would always have the initiative, able to advance and retreat up to their own will. They were essentially unbeatable.

However, today, that sharp perceptiveness failed him. Dong Mingyuan’s dagger had silently cut his neck without him realizing it.

Furthermore, the angle from which Dong Mingyu’s attack came was extremely bizarre. Luckily for him, he had directly used his spatial energy to teleport rather than instinctively retreating. If he had retreated, that dagger would have spun and cleanly cut off his head.

Thinking of that, he became covered in a cold sweat. That particular instance marked the closest he had ever come to the brink of death.

“Little Yu!”

Upon seeing Dong Mingyu standing before Long Chen like a protective god, Xia Chen and Guo Ran were delighted. She had actually managed to drive away Ji Wuming.

Dong Mingyu nodded toward them. Looking at Yue Zifeng, she said, “I’m sorry for being late. Leave this one to me!”

Yue Zifeng nodded. As a fellow assassin, Dong Mingyu was the ideal match for Ji Wuming.

If Yue Zifeng was in his peak condition, he wouldn’t fear Ji Wuming. But Ji Wuming was too contemptible, aiming at everyone, forcing Yue Zifeng to defend passively.

It had to be known that sword cultivators specialized in the offense. So, defending was naturally Yue Zifeng’s greatest weakness.

Upon uttering those words, Dong Mingyu turned toward Long Chen who was inside the golden eggshell. Ripples danced in her beautiful eyes, causing her icy countenance to melt and transform into a gentle and warm smile.

To her, Long Chen embodied hope, illuminating her world like a beacon of light. He represented a promising future, a radiant world that contrasted with her previous darkness.

“As long as I’m here, no one can hurt you,” whispered Dong Mingyu. She then turned back to Ji Wuming. “My oath starts with you. I’ll use your blood to bear witness to my oath.”

“Hmph, big words. It just so happens that I want to experience the Shadow Sect’s assassination arts. Today, in front of everyone, we’ll see just who the true king of assassins is,” replied Ji Wuming coldly.

“No, I’m not competing for the title of king of assassins with you. Our Shadow Sect only views you as prey. You are my first target, and after I kill you, I have an appointment with your master. So, are you ready?” Dong Mingyu’s smile vanished as soon as she turned from Long Chen, returning to her former iciness. All her emotion had vanished and what remained was an apathetic desire to kill.

“The ignorant are always unafraid. Today, I’ll see just how much ability you have.”

Ji Wuming vanished. There was no longer a trace of him.

“Even if you have a Supreme Blood and a Supreme Bone, even if you’ve merged the two together, and even if you have talent in the law of space and time, you don’t know the true Dao of Assassination or the fear in human hearts. Without it, you will never be a decent assassin. It seems that my master overestimated you.” Dong Mingyu shook her head in the face of this sudden vanishment.

Suddenly, her dagger made a light cut, making ripples in the void. Dong Mingyu’s body then entered those ripples like they were a spatial gate.

BOOM!

In the next instant, a powerful explosion erupted in the distance, and Ji Wuming’s figure was blown out of the void.

Dong Mingyu’s body was half outside the spatial gate, while the other half materialized in front of Ji Wuming. A vast expanse of thousands of miles separated the two halves. This astonishing spectacle left even the city lords dumbfounded, for they had never beheld such a mesmerizing display of movement art.

Ji Wuming's expression contorted with surprise as his spatial technique proved ineffective against Dong Mingyu. Bewildered, he couldn't fathom how she had done this. He even speculated that it might have been a stroke of sheer luck or a blind guess on her part.

However, he didn’t dare to try it again. If he guessed wrong, then displaying the same technique in front of Dong Mingyu would be courting death.

An assassin’s prowess extended beyond the mastery of assassination arts. They also needed to be able to assess the battlefield, swiftly deducing the best attacking style for any situation.

BOOM!

Suddenly, Ji Wuming’s left and right hands lit up. Runes then materialized on top of his palms, causing the world around him to ripple like water. Reality itself seemed to invert, as time and space intertwined and twisted in mesmerizing fashion.

At this moment, Ji Wuming unleashed the full power of his Supreme Bones at once. His figure swayed and fragmented, splitting into two, then further dividing into four, and finally expanding into eight distinct embodiments.

Eight Ji Wuming materialized simultaneously, their auras indistinguishable from one another. It was evident that this display surpassed mere image reflections or spiritual avatar techniques. These were genuine clones, each embodying his true essence and prowess, making it virtually impossible to discern the original among them.

“Prepare to witness my self-created Eight Slaughter Clone Technique! Each of the clones possesses ninety percent of my peak combat power! Other than my master, no one has ever lived to see it! With this technique, I’ve killed nine of the Shadow Sect’s experts, and you shall be the tenth!” said all eight Ji Wumings.

All eight of them suddenly vanished.

However, they had just vanished when a dagger pierced through the void. A horrifying sight unfolded as Ji Wuming’s head flew into the sky along with a spurt of blood.
