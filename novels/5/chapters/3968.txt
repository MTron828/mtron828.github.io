Chapter 3957 The Empresses’ Attitude

“How can I not reciprocate? Long Chen is so modest that he has given up his chance to appeal. Giving him a status plate in exchange for his gift is simply natural. Furthermore, this status plate will only let him skip some unnecessarily complex procedures. Even if I didn’t give it to him, if he wanted to get one, it would only be a matter of time before he got it. Rather than wasting time on complex procedures, why not be more direct and formally bring him into the loop? You should know just how valuable time is to cultivators. There’s no point wasting it,” said Yu Qingxuan’s mother.

Ah, this mother-in-law was truly great. Long Chen smiled inside. There was definitely nothing to fear now.

It seemed that Yu Qingxuan had long since told her mother about him, and this future mother-in-law approved of him. Everything would definitely go smoothly.

Even if the emperor didn’t like him, so what? Xia Guhong had already said that Yu Xiaoyun was an idiot. If it weren’t for his outstanding empresses, he wouldn’t have his current accomplishments. In the Vermilion Bird Empire, perhaps his word was law, but when it came to the family, these two empresses were definitely stronger than him.

“Cultivators that are arrogant and prideful have fickle characters. I feel like some procedures cannot be skipped. After all, these procedures are evidence for us to see whether Long Chen is hardworking. It is a trial for his character,” said an elder who gave off no aura or fluctuations. This elder was a scholar and also a member of the royal family. The imperial family’s disciples were skilled in martial arts and culture. Although they leaned more on martial learning, they had to treat scholarly learning as important as well. Thus, there were quite a few scholars within the imperial family.

“That is correct. Empress, if you give Long Chen this status plate, it would be giving him special treatment. It’s unfair. If this trial starts off unfair, then there is no point to it,” said another elder.

Clearly, they disliked Long Chen, especially his arrogant and unrestrained character.

As more and more people voiced their dissent, the once warm smiles of the two empresses slowly transformed into icy expressions. As for the emperor, seeing this situation, he chose to keep his mouth shut.

Long Chen saw that his two mother-in-laws were about to get angry, so he hastily said, “Junior is grateful for your kind intentions. However, these trials are simple to me. My heart will remain devoted to Qingxuan forever, and thus, how could I fear such tiny trials? I have confidence in myself and in Qingxuan, so I hope my two esteemed mother-in-laws will also place some trust in me. Trust me. I can handle it all.”

The countenance of Yu Qingxuan’s mother was darkening with so many people opposing her. She couldn't help but feel bad considering Long Chen, a junior, had graciously presented her with a gift. As a senior, it seemed only appropriate for her to reciprocate with a gift of her own. However, their opposition didn’t give her any face, leaving her naturally displeased.

However, Long Chen’s smiling confidence did make her expression improve a bit. “Good child. Treat it as auntie owing you. There will be plenty of time for auntie to pay you back.”

How could Long Chen not understand what she was saying? She was clearly telling him that there was no need to be afraid. She would open a backdoor for him.

Seeing the delight in his eyes, Yu Qingxuan’s mother smiled. Inside, she thought to himself, “This child is quite clever.”

“Since it’s decided, junior will bid farewell to auntie. I have to go prepare for the trials.” Long Chen once more bowed to Yu Qingxuan’s mother and the other empress before leaving.

Once Long Chen left, all the elders paid their respects to the emperor and empresses. The emperor personally sent off that ancient elder.

He only returned once he had sent that elder off. Now, there were only three people left in the palace.

Without everyone else around them, Yu Xiaoyun’s wives stared at him, and he stared at them as well. He coldly said, “Don’t look at me. I dislike that little fellow, and I will not accept him marrying my daughter. I don’t care what you say. I refuse to approve!”

“And your reason?”

The two of them spoke up at almost the exact same time.

“I am the ninety-fifth emperor, and Qingxuan is my daughter. If I don’t like him, if I disapprove, that is all. Why would I need to give any reason?” said Yu Xiaoyun angrily.

“That might not be up to you,” said Yu Qingxuan’s mother.

“What? Do I not get authority over my daughter’s marriage?” raged Yu Xiaoyun.

“Just look at yourself. You know that you’re the ninety-fifth emperor, yet you start roaring after just a few sentences. What’s the point of roaring? If roaring was useful, donkeys would have taken over the world by now. All roaring can do is scare a group of well-behaved children. Did your roars scare off Long Chen?” Yu Qingxuan’s mother shook her head disappointedly.

“You are Qingxuan’s father, but big sister Huixin is still Qingxuan’s mother. She came from her body, so big sister has to have at least a fifty percent voice in this decision. Furthermore, I can count as her mother as well. I should have at least a ten percent voice, right? The two of us added together is sixty percent-” said the other empress.

Before she could even finish, Yu Xiaoyun already waved his hand dismissively. “I knew that you were working together. Don’t even try it. What I say about my daughter is what counts.”

Yu Xiaoyun directly turned and left, not even giving them a chance to reason with him. After so many years, Yu Xiaoyun had understood one principle, and that was to not talk reason with his women because he could not win.

These two women of his were incredibly powerful. Knowing that he couldn’t outreason them, he directly left.nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

Now it was just the two of them in the palace. Yu Qingxuan’s mother shook her head.

“This fellow’s temper gets worse as his cultivation base grows. He’s getting even more pigheaded.”

“Big sister Huixin, don’t worry. Big brother Xiaoyun will realize the truth sooner or later. It’s just a matter of time. Let us be patient and give him a bit of time,” consoled the other empress.

“Thank you. Lanxin, I feel much better with you by my side.” Yu Qingxuan’s mother sighed.

Yu Qingxuan’s mother was named Jiang Huixin. As for the other empress, her name was Xu Lanxin. They were the two empresses of the current dynasty of the Vermilion Bird Empire.

“Qingxuan wanted me to give Long Chen this tablet and help him, so I can see that she truly loves that little fellow. Unfortunately, as her mother, I was unable to help her at all.” Jiang Huixin sighed with shame.

“Big sister Huixin, to tell the truth, although Long Chen is handsome and doesn’t appear ordinary, his tongue is glib, and his character is a bit too arrogant. I’m not sure whether he’s the right choice for her!” Xu Lanxin hesitated but still decided to speak her mind. In truth, she did not have a high opinion of Long Chen.

“As long as Qingxuan likes him, I will support her. No one knows this better than a mother: loving someone is like being struck with incurable poison. Was that not what happened to us? Just look at Yu Xiaoyun’s terrible temper. His looks are only average, but why did we end up falling for him?”

The two of them exchanged a look, suddenly recalling when Yu Xiaoyun had called Long Chen’s looks mediocre and Long Chen had directly struck back.

The two of them burst into laughter. Yu Xiaoyun’s furious, helpless expression back then almost made them cry with laughter.

“That’s right, we should see what gift that child gave us!”

After that, the two of them curiously opened the cases. When the cases opened, their expressions became one of immense shock.
