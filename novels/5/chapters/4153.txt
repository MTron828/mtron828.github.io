Chapter 4142: Getting Everything

“Tch, just because you lack any skill, you think everyone else is as weak as you?”

Long Chen sneered at that person’s suspicions.

“In any case, I’ve shown off my item. It’s up to you whether or not you want to believe it. If anyone is interested, please get in touch. Those poor ghosts with neither skill nor money, please stay away from me. Don’t blindly get in my way.”

“Who are you calling a poor ghost?!”

The Heaven Venerate who had doubted Long Chen angrily shouted. He could be considered a local hegemon, so Long Chen’s words were quite insulting.

“I can’t be bothered to waste words with the likes of you. You even said that an Eternal divine weapon can’t be taken by an innate Heaven Venerate? Truly a frog at the bottom of a well. The heaven you see is only as large as your own hand,” sneered Long Chen.

“You…!” That Heaven Venerate was about to retort when startled cries rang out. Long Chen was reaching out to grab the spear.

“No way! Is he-?!”

“Does he not want his life any longer?!”

“Was he provoked? He wants to show off?!”

“This child’s quite stubborn!”

When they saw Long Chen reach out to grab the spear, everyone jumped in shock, including Xu Jianxiong, Uncle Tree, and the others. That was an Eternal divine weapon, a very dangerous item. Furthermore, none of them could save him from outside the barrier.

“Hehe, don’t worry, boss is always assured of what he does!” said Guo Ran confidently.

Guo Ran and the others had returned to the Fullmoon race’s camp. It had been slow entering this domain, but it was very easy leaving it.

Now, only Xue Qingkuang’s group remained at the edge of the core, seeming to be waiting for something.

At this moment, Long Chen pressed his hands against the enormous spear, using his mind to sense its fluctuations. As expected, after being struck by the Heaven Earth Cauldron, he could sense the item-spirit’s fluctuations.

However, those fluctuations were extremely weak, as though the item-spirit was on the verge of death. Long Chen could sense immense resentment and sorrow from those fluctuations.

After that, a scene appeared in Long Chen’s mind: a long-haired man wielding a golden spear was covered in blood while fighting the devil race.

In the surroundings, heaven and earth had been reduced to a mass of primal chaos, and the air was filled with devil qi. There were countless devil corpses beneath his feet. Although his companions were all dead, he still continued to fight.

Suddenly, with a resounding roar, the land swayed as light blasted out of his body. All his essence, qi, and spirit then merged into his spear.

BOOM!

The spear lit up like a blazing sun, blowing apart the devil qi along with countless winged devils. But then, an enormous winged devil appeared before him.

This winged devil was the great overlord of these winged devils. Devil qi poured out of it, and its wings covered the sky.

However, when this terrifying existence saw the long-haired man, fear welled up within its eyes. Astonishingly, it promptly turned and fled.

At that very moment, both the long-haired man and the spear disappeared, only to reappear at the head of the winged devil. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

.

The spear crashed down like a heavenly strike, piercing the body of the winged devil and nailing it to the ground. The winged devil kept roaring and struggling, but it was powerless.

Its life energy rapidly faded away. In the end, it finally became still, but the long-haired man had also vanished. What was left was the heavenly spear, which had countless divine runes flowing around it that firmly sealed this world.

As time passed by, the Great Desolate Winged Devil became covered in dust, and the spear became rusty. Everything changed.

“So you’re a divine weapon from a senior of the human race.” Long Chen sighed. This senior actually died together with the Great Desolate Winged Devil in order to seal it here.

“If you keep wasting away like this, you really will die. I trust that your master didn’t want that for you. Your master died at the hands of the devil race, but you can still fight. You shouldn’t sacrifice your life for a worthless corpse. Reveal your light once more and slaughter more experts of the devil race! Complete the mission that your master was unable to complete.” Long Chen rubbed the spear solemnly.

Whether it was this spear or its master, they were both true heroes. The spear was affected by its master and was willing to silently die to keep the Great Desolate Winged Devil’s remaining will sealed.

The item-spirit had its own will and instinct to live. So, for the item-spirit to use its own life to accomplish its master’s final will, it could be seen just how deep their relationship was.

Hearing Long Chen’s voice, the spear brightened slightly. After that, Long Chen slowly smiled.

“Don’t worry, I can handle it! Dragon King Battle Armor!”

With a resounding dragon roar that pierced the nine heavens, golden dragon scales covered Long Chen’s body.

When he began to pull, the earth shook and the void was torn asunder, causing this very world to quake.

“He…!”

Countless people cried out in dumbfounded shock. Long Chen was really trying to pull out the spear.

Both Xue Qingkuang and the race leader of the Blood Devil race tensed. Once that spear was pulled out, the Great Desolate Winged Devil’s seal would be undone, and that would be their best chance to attack.

As long as they could obtain its corpse, they had a secret technique to awaken its will. Using their faith energy, they could reconstruct its soul, and then this Eternal devil would be reborn.

“Rise!”

Veins throbbed on Long Chen’s forehead as he pulled with all his power. This time, he didn’t hold anything back.

In front of countless shocked gazes, the earth tore apart as Long Chen forcibly ripped the Great Desolate Winged Devil out of the ground.

“Impossible! No matter how strong he is, there’s no way he can lift an Eternal expert’s corpse!”

“In theory, it’s impossible. He cannot break the laws of an Eternal expert’s corpse. Unless…”

“Unless he can control that spear! If that spear is willing to help him, it should be possible!”

When the realization dawned upon them, they were shocked. How could that be possible? The spear was willing to give Long Chen its power? Then didn’t that mean that it was willing to accept him as its next master?

Long Chen grasped the spear and hoisted the entire body of the Great Desolate Winged Devil. But as a result, the overwhelming pressure threatened to crush his body, and he could feel stars swirling in his head.

This corpse seemed to be heavier than a star. Most hateful of all, its body seemed to be bound by countless invisible chains pulling it away, so Long Chen had to tear apart those chains to lift it.

The void was constantly exploding, and countless fragments of spacetime flew about. It was a shocking scene.

“Just a bit more!”

Long Chen pulled with all his power, and with a heaven-shaking explosion, a giant black hole appeared behind him. In one swift motion, Long Chen then tossed the spear and corpse into the black hole.

As the black hole sealed shut, a gleaming three-meter golden spear materialized in Long Chen's hand.

“Hahahaha!”

Long Chen raised his head and laughed. The spear was in his hand, and the Great Desolate Winged Devil’s corpse was tossed onto the black soil.

Long Chen had somehow mustered the strength to lift the spear and even the Great Desolate Winged Devil’s corpse. Witnessing this astonishing feat, the entire world fell into a profound silence.

“Die!”

In that critical moment, all the Blood Devil experts standing alongside Xue Qingkuang unleashed their coordinated assault, their most formidable attacks converging on Long Chen.
