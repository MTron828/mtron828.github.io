Chapter 3523

“You have an enmity with the Soaring Dragon Company?” Yu Qingxuan put away the war chariot and looked at those people that were glaring at Long Chen in front of the city gates. From their robes, she could tell their status.

“No, no enmity. We’re of the same profession. Perhaps we end up with some clashes as we conduct our business,” said Long Chen, shaking his head like a rattle.

“You do business?” asked Yu Qingxuan with disbelief. Even now, she didn’t know what Long Chen did. Did he have a collaboration with the Soaring Dragon Company?

“Yes, I suppose. We’re all just doing business. Then con others, and I loot what they con. It should be said to be mutually beneficial,” said Long Chen.

“You dare to take the Soaring Dragon Company’s things?” Yu Qingxuan was shocked and covered her mouth, staring at him in disbelief.

“Didn’t I tell you? Alchemy is my side occupation, and my main occupation is looting!” said Long Chen solemnly.

Back then, she had thought that he was just spouting nonsense. Now that he repeated it, she didn’t quite know what to believe.

“Long Chen, you really did come here. Will you let yourself be captured, or do you need us to do it?” Four third Heavenstage World Kings stepped forward, surrounding Long Chen as soon as he appeared.

Those four third Heavenstage World Kings unleashed their powerful auras, instantly drawing countless people’s attention.

Long Chen lazily looked at them and indifferently said, “There’s no need to wonder if I’ll let myself be captured. If you want to, go ahead and make your move.”

“Long Chen, if you really have guts, then leave the Dragon Blaze Prefecture and have a fair fight with us!” shouted one of the World Kings. Clearly, they didn’t dare to fight in this place. They didn’t dare to offend the city lord.

“A fair fight?”

Long Chen wasn’t the only one who laughed. Countless people who came to see the disturbance also laughed when they heard that four third Heavenstage World Kings were demanding a fair fight with an early stage Divine Lord. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

Although the Soaring Dragon Company did possess a certain level of prestige, in this Dragon Blaze Prefecture, there were ten thousand races standing tall and multiple major powers. People weren’t afraid of the Soaring Dragon Company.

They might not be a friend of Long Chen’s. But hearing a World King challenge a Divine Lord to a fair fight, they wondered if that World King’s head was still alright.

Even Yu Qingxuan laughed. This person truly was amusing. He talked without using his head.

That World King also sensed that he had misspoken, but he couldn’t take his words back. His face burned.

“Long Chen, the Soaring Dragon Company is powerful. It’s not good to provoke them. Why don’t I use my status as a member of the Blazing Heaven Divine Sect to ask the Elders to mediate things for you? If you return what you took, wouldn’t it be good for everyone?” whispered Yu Qingxuan. This was for Long Chen’s own good. It had to be known that the Soaring Dragon Company was extremely wealthy. Offending them was not something to do for fun.

“Thank you, but there can be no mediation between us. You have to know, this world has no reasonless love and no causeless hate. Can you trust me?” Long Chen looked at Yu Qingxuan.

Yu Qingxuan smiled. “I, of course, trust you.”

“Then that’s good. Let me handle this matter. Don’t worry about me. Oh, your two Elders have come.” Long Chen just happened to see Yu Qingxuan’s guards appear.

The two of them immediately came over to Yu Qingxuan’s side. After that, they became like statues, just standing there with their eyes closed.

“Long Chen, as the Darklight Heaven’s High Firmament Academy’s youngest Heaven Master and the youngest branch academy’s Dean, you are actually willing to hide like a little tortoise in its shell. The face of the most ancient academy in the nine heavens and ten lands has been lost by you. If someone else was in your position, they would have long since killed themselves out of shame!” As the first elder of the Soaring Dragon Company had misspoken, his companion immediately helped him out.

As a result, his words shook countless people. They stared at Long Chen in disbelief. Even some experts of other races looked at Long Chen with stunned expressions.

Many people were fond of remembering the number one, the best. As for the High Firmament Academy, it was the nine heavens and ten lands’ number one academy. Although it had declined, its name was known to countless people.

This was simply common sense. If you went out into the world without knowing anything at all, then perhaps it would be fine if you were from other races. But if you were from the human race and still didn’t know anything, you would definitely be laughed at.

Within the ancient city, countless heads stuck out, looking toward the city gates. Amongst them were Feng Xiang, Zhao Mingxuan, Wu Yang, and the others. They were stunned to hear that Long Chen was a dean of the number one academy.

“How can that be?!”

Long Chen was so young. Whether it was in terms of cultivation base, experience, or ability, how could he hold the position of dean? Even if it was just the dean of a branch academy, that wasn’t possible, no?

Yu Qingxuan was even more shocked. At this time, she thought of how Long Chen had said that he had conned a dean into making him a Heaven Master. She had always thought that he had been joking. So it was the truth, and it was even in the world’s number one academy.

“News spreads quickly. You obtained my information so quickly? But so what? I’m not in the Darklight Heaven. Here, I’m no longer the dean of the High Firmament Academy. This provocation of yours is meaningless against me. Those so-called halos of light are unable to bind me. In the Violet Flame Heaven, I have no halos. I am by myself and have nothing else. So what are you going to do now?” said Long Chen disdainfully.

“Long Chen, you massacred innocent people, selling your soul for profit, not caring about morality. After killing people for their treasures, you actually tried to blame my Soaring Dragon Company. You are absolutely vile. A shameless person like you should simply be hunted down and executed by all the heroes of the land. My Soaring Dragon Company has raised the bounty on you to one billion immortal king crystals, a World Domain divine item, and making your killer the highest level V.I.P. of the Soaring Dragon Company. Whoever cuts off your head will gain fame and wealth in one move, in addition to removing a scourge from this world. Let me see just how long you can keep smiling!” sneered one of the World Kings.

Countless people gasped at that extravagant bounty. That would definitely draw countless experts against Long Chen. In their eyes, Long Chen was no longer a human; he was a moving pile of cash.

As for those with hostility toward him, for example, Zhao Mingxuan, Wu Yang, and the others, their eyes all brightened. They weren’t lacking money, but they were lacking an excuse to kill Long Chen. Now, they smiled.

It wasn’t just them. Countless experts turned their gazes to Long Chen, and some were already using their divine sense to investigate his fluctuations. It was extremely provoking.

“Using others to kill me? That’s fine. I, Long Chen, will accept all challengers. Furthermore, in order to let everyone be at ease, let me say that there are no misgivings. I hereby announce to everyone here that this beautiful fairy Qingxuan beside me is just an ordinary friend. Do not implicate her because of me,” announced Long Chen.

“Don’t pretend to be so loved. Someone about to die should think more about themselves!”
