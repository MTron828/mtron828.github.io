Chapter 2337 Deciding With Just a Word

Translator: BornToBe

Only now did he realize the ulterior motive of the Xuan Beasts. That Elder of the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow race was so infuriated that he completely forgot himself and attacked.

When the Xuan Beasts had come here to willingly submit to the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow race and put on such a respectful attitude, he had felt years of resentment fall off his shoulders. He had been so happy that he almost forgot about that pain.

The old Elders had endured the most and were especially emotional to see the day that the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow race would be crowned emperors. To be able to see their race rise to such a level brought them too many emotions to describe.

It was due to these emotions that they hadn’t thought too much about the Xuan Beasts’ surrender. The Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow race truly possessed the power to lead the Xuan Beasts, and they were their only option.

However, they hadn’t expected that this loyalty was just a facade to make the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow race their shield. They had been treated like fools.

The Xuan Beasts gave them a paltry crown to make them their sacrificial shield. The Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow race was taken for fools. Furthermore, they had even tried to instigate a conflict between them and Long Chen.

The Elder was stopped by the oldest Elder of the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow race, Elder Que Yifeng. Que Yifeng himself was ashamed, and he suddenly slammed his own hand toward his head to repent for his actions.

Startled cries rang out from the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow race’s experts, but when his hand was just three inches from his head, something caught his wrist.

“Long Chen, I…” Seeing that the one to stop him was Long Chen, Que Yifeng was even more ashamed. He had doubted Long Chen’s motives and almost caused the downfall of the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow race. The only thing he could do was offer his own life as an apology.

“Senior, killing yourself like this is really contemptuous.” Long Chen shook his head.

“This is the only way to atone for my foolishness,” said Que Yifeng.

“If every mistake required dying to atone, then there wouldn’t be any living creatures in this world. I’ve made mistakes, but aren’t I living quite shamelessly anyway? All that matters is that you don’t make the same mistake twice,” said Long Chen.

“Long Chen, I really-”

Long Chen waved his hand. “Seniority has nothing to do with it. We are all novices when it comes to mistakes that we haven’t made. If you die here, that would be the real sin. The Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow race still needs you. The entire Martial Heaven Continent needs you. This is a critical moment for all living beings of this world. As one of the top fighters of the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow race, how many enemies is your life worth? How many others can you protect with that life? If you die, who would shield the children who have yet to grow?”

The Elders of the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow race hung their heads, and Que Yifeng had an urge to find a hole to hide himself in. “My life is not my own. It belongs to every member of the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow race.”

Hearing those words from Que Yifeng, Que Yuzhu felt a weight lift off her shoulders. No one else could have stopped this stubborn old man from what he had decided, not even her. But Long Chen was able to make him lower his head and accept his mistakes with just a few words. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Although Que Yifeng was stubborn and stuck to old habits, he had fought for the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow race countless times and had accumulated a lot of hidden wounds within his body. He was one of the few remaining Grand Elders.

There was no other person from his generation. He was the only one who had survived those tumultuous times. The merit he had contributed to the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow race was such that even she, as race leader, had to be somewhat deferential to him.

It was due to this that Que Yifeng’s temper had grown stranger. He was also the only one within the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow race who dared to go against Que Yuzhu.

Seeing him calm down with just a few words from Long Chen relieved Que Yuzhu. Long Chen also smiled. The Xuan Beasts were, after all, not humans and were lacking in many aspects of human thinking.

Long Chen put down the Xuan Beast in his hand. Looking at him, Long Chen said, “As soon as I saw you, I knew your goal. If you were really sincere, you would have come to join as soon as the Kunpeng race was annihilated. After capturing a few of the Kunpeng race’s evildoers, you could have brought them over to express your greatest sincerity. However, you waited. You waited for days before suddenly coming here. You are taking advantage of the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow race’s inflated hearts from this victory to deceive them. To tell the truth, I’m not trying to look down on your intelligence, but when it comes to scheming, the Xuan Beasts will never achieve any great heights. There was definitely someone who proposed this to you.”

Amongst the Xuan Beasts, a few were panicking. Those people had clearly known about this before. But most of them were still lost, not realizing that such things had occurred behind the scenes.

“We were also foolish to so easily believe them,” sighed Que Yuzhu. She had also been delighted to see the Xuan Beasts come. After all, this was a grand occasion, one with great meaning to the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow race.

However, the difference was that she had known that they had to at least hear Long Chen’s opinion over such an important matter. Inside though, she had been the same as the other experts of the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow race. They all hoped to become emperors.

Now that Long Chen had arrived and explained it, they realized it was just a trap. This crown came with a terrible blood price.

“Race leader Yuzhu, we sincerely wish for the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow race to be our emperors. We are willing to listen to all of your orders. You don’t need to doubt our sincerity.”

“No matter how you put it, we are all Xuan Beasts. The current Xuan Beasts are in chaos and fractured. We need an emperor race to lead us.”

“Yes, the Xuan Beasts must be unified. Otherwise, when the dark era comes, we will be the first to be wiped out.”

More and more of the Xuan Beasts began to speak up. Based on their appearances, it seemed that they were very sincere.

“Long Chen, falling for the divine families’ lies was our mistake. However, believe us when we say we are willing to be fully loyal to the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow race. Every one of us will listen to our emperor’s orders. We’ll go wherever the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow race says. Our fates will be bound together.” The Xuan Beast that Long Chen had grabbed by the neck also spoke up brazenly.

“The Xuan Beasts were enemies with you because of the orders of the Kunpeng race. We had no choice but to carry out orders. Now that the dark era is coming, the Xuan Beasts need a leader. We also want to survive. Even if all of us have to die, at least our descendants have to survive to continue our bloodlines. Long Chen, I beg you to allow us to follow the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow race. Even if you put us at the front of the battlelines to be crushed, we won’t mind,” said one of the leaders of the Xuan Beasts. That elder was weeping, and he knelt toward Long Chen.

Many of the Xuan Beasts that had come were old members of their race. This kowtow was a kowtow for his descendants.

More and more of the Xuan Beasts began to fall to their knees. But before their knees could touch the ground, a force lifted them up.

Long Chen waved his hand, preventing their actions. “I don’t need anyone to give up their dignity for me. Since you’ve said this, then we can discuss this properly. I didn’t want the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow race to be used, and I didn’t want any of the Xuan Beasts to be secretly listening to the divine families and ruining things. Now that you’ve come together, I won’t participate in whatever the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow race decides on.”

After saying that, Long Chen prepared to leave, but Que Yuzhu held him back. She said, “Long Chen, the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow race’s current achievements are thanks to you. We also don’t have your intelligence. What we can do is trust you wholeheartedly. The Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow race will always follow your lead and fight together with you. Even if we become the emperors of the Xuan Beasts, we will always listen to your orders. So you can decide things today.”

“We are all willing to listen to your decision!” All the Elders of the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow race looked at Long Chen.

Everyone’s gazes concentrated on Long Chen. The atmosphere inside the palace grew incomparably tense. With just a word, Long Chen would decide the fate of the Xuan Beasts.
