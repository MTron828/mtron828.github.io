Chapter 4739 Spirit Weapon

The atmosphere was rather awkward inside of a certain room. Bai Zhantang, Bai Xiaole, Bai Shishi, and Long Chen were the only ones inside, but most of them had displeased expressions.0

Bai Zhantang was still angry, Bai Xiaole was being stubborn, and Bai Shishi had an icy appearance. Only Long Chen was acting like he didn’t notice a thing and pouring tea for everyone. He then pushed a cup to Bai Zhantang.3

In theory, Long Chen should have handed it to him as that would be the recommended etiquette. However, Bai Zhantang did not like him, nor did he accept him as a son-in-law, so Long Chen naturally wouldn’t act like a junior in front of him.0

In terms of position, Long Chen was a branch dean, higher than a vice palace master. Thus, this couldn’t count as being rude.0

“Vice Palace Master, how is the situation over there?” asked Long Chen.0

Bai Zhantang grew serious when this topic was broached. “It’s not going well. Our branch academy in the Sovereign Emperor Heaven is occupied by countless powerful devil creatures from beyond the heavens. The foundation has been badly corroded. For now, we are unable to reclaim the branch academy.”1

“It’s that tough? Even the palace master is unable to do anything?” asked Long Chen, feeling shocked.0

“The palace master wanted to launch a direct assault, but the dean said that the opportunity had not yet ripened. Rather than being brash, the best thing to do was watch and wait. We were only able to find a resting point to settle in and set up some simple defenses. It can be said that we are temporarily safe there. The dean was worried about the situation here, so he had me come to take a look. Once the gate to the ninth heaven opens, I will bring you over,” replied Bai Zhantang.2

“We’re doing well on our side. Even if you didn’t come, Boss would lead us in,” retorted Bai Xiaole scornfully, still nursing his wounded pride from the earlier confrontation with his father.0

“These are gifts from your mothers. Keep them safe.” With that, Bai Zhantang stood, dropped two cases, and departed, leaving only the three of them behind.0

“I wonder what my mom gave me?” Bai Xiaole was rather childish, so upon seeing a gift, he immediately got excited. He then opened the case in front of him.0

What reflected in his eyes was an egg-sized sphere. In terms of material, it looked like it was made of gold, but there was a silvery sheen to it, looking rather odd.0

“What is this?” Bai Xiaole was baffled.0

“This is…” The Violet Pupil Nine Tail Fox’s eyes widened. “Xiaole, put a drop of blood on it!”0

Bai Xiaole immediately followed Little Nine’s orders, putting a drop of blood which was quickly absorbed by the sphere.1

The silver sphere suddenly exploded, transforming into countless rice-sized silver scales suspended in front of Bai Xiaole.0

“This is a Spirit Weapon! A Spirit Weapon specifically made for a wielder of pupil arts!” exclaimed Little Nine excitedly. It could tell that this was a priceless treasure.1

“What is a Spirit Weapon?” asked Bai Xiaole blankly.0

When Little Nine waved its claws, the silver scales grew, surrounding Bai Xiaole and Little Nine in silver armor.0

“Oh, this thing’s fun!” exclaimed Bai Xiaole delightedly.0

“What do you know? This is a supreme treasure!” corrected Little Nine. “It is said that the forging method for Spirit Weapons has been lost for ages! Otherwise, Guo Ran would have forged us a decent weapon by now.”4

No one knew how Little Nine was doing it, but those scales then came off of them and stretched into tens of thousands of sharp swords.0

In this form, they gave off such a sharp aura that threatened even Long Chen. These swords didn’t seem any weaker than the divine weapons Guo Ran had forged.0

“Damn, this thing’s amazing!” cried out Bai Xiaole delightedly.0

Suddenly, those swords shrank, transforming into feathers that condensed into two silver wings on his back.2

“Wow!” Bai Xiaole shouted excitedly like a child with a new toy.0

“Stop shouting! Let’s find somewhere private to test it out!” Little Nine was also excited. The two of them vanished like a wisp of smoke, not even saying goodbye to Long Chen.1

Now it was just Long Chen and Bai Shishi in the room. Long Chen smiled at Bai Shishi and nodded for her to open her case, but Bai Shishi stubbornly shook her head. 0

“I don’t want what he gave me.”0

“Why not?” asked Long Chen.0

“I just don’t like him.” 4

Long Chen scratched his head, unable to comprehend why Bai Shishi disliked her own father so much.0

“Then I’ll open it!” probed Long Chen.0

“If you want to open it, open it. It’s your hand. I can’t stop you,” replied Bai Shishi, showing a rare submissiveness.2

With that glance, Long Chen instantly grasped the situation. Curiosity was inherent, especially among women. If cats had nine lives, women had the curiosity to kill them all. Bai Shishi indeed wanted to see what was inside the case but didn't want to show her interest.12

Long Chen opened the case and saw a pair of golden bracelets. They appeared incredibly ancient yet elegant as well, containing a certain nobility to them.0

When it emerged, the entire room was filled with golden divine light, and this world’s metal energy thrummed.0

“Hmph, just a pair of bracelets. There’s nothing to see here.” Bai Shishi looked inside and turned her head away.0

However, she quickly turned back as these bracelets were so attractive that any woman would find it hard to resist them. Furthermore, as a metal element cultivator, it was like they were made just for her. Her pride told her not to look at them, but she was unable to deny her instincts.2

As for Long Chen, looking at these bracelets, he couldn’t help sighing. A conflicting expression appeared in his eyes.0

“What is it? Why are you sighing?” asked Bai Shishi.0

“The vice palace master really does care for you,” answered Long Chen.0

“It’s just a pair of bracelets. What’s so special about them?” snorted Bai Shishi. “He’s the one who said that these gifts are from our mothers. It has nothing to do with him. Am I supposed to be grateful just because he was the one to bring them over?”0RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

Long Chen picked one of the bracelets up. Holding it in his hand, he shook his head. “This isn’t from your mothers. This is something your father almost lost his life for.”11

“What?” Bai Shishi’s expression finally changed.
