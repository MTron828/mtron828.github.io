Chapter 5012 Sovereign Blood Seal

With a grim expression, Long Chen strode away from the martial arena. What a ruthless woman. He didn’t want to see her again. However, before leaving, he arranged for Qin Feng to receive treatment at the Heaven Overseer’s residence.

Qin Feng was strong, and everyone knew this. Within the same generation, the only ones who could threaten his life were the likes of Zhao Qingtian. Other Heavenly Chosens could only match him in battle. Even though Qin Feng had ended up in a draw against Ye Lingkong, in a life-or-death struggle, Ye Lingkong would have had no chance. After all, Qin Feng wouldn’t rely solely on brute force; he would employ all his skills to ensure his victory.

Qin Feng had faced Ye Lingkong directly because he saw him as a whetstone—a means to trigger his instincts and stimulate the dragon soul within him.

During Long Chen’s absence, the Dragonblood warriors quickly discovered this method. When their life was in danger or they were severely wounded, their dragon souls would be stimulated, and it would strengthen their bodies and souls.

These dragon souls were ancient beings. Having lived for countless years, they possessed unimaginable power and numerous divine abilities. However, they were reluctant to share these gifts.

Through various tests, the Dragonblood warriors found two shortcuts to make the dragon souls share these divine abilities. One method involved gaining strength and earning the dragon soul’s recognition, which would grant them a divine ability as a reward.

The other shortcut was through injury. The most effective injuries were those that pushed them to the brink of death, compelling the dragon soul to intervene to prevent their demise.

That was how Qin Feng had significantly enhanced his strength during Long Chen’s absence. All the Dragonblood warriors trained in this manner. Hence, despite Qin Feng’s progress, he still couldn’t retain his position as a small squad leader because everyone else was also advancing.

Actually, Guo Ran sent Qin Feng over to show Long Chen the state of the Dragonblood warriors. While Qin Feng wasn’t necessarily the strongest, he was smart and wary. Moreover, he had accompanied Long Chen for a while back then, which made him the chosen envoy.

After settling matters for Qin Feng, Long Chen ignored everyone else and bid farewell to Feng Fei before retreating into seclusion.

In his immortal cave, he didn’t immediately activate his dragon blood. Instead, he first condensed the Cross Blood Rune on his left hand, then on his right. Due to his previous experience, everything progressed smoothly, and he completed the process swiftly. Only then did he attempt to use his dragon blood.

Long Chen’s dragon blood surged within him, yet it stubbornly refused to merge with the violet blood starry sea or replicate it. It displayed an extraordinary resistance to these efforts.

Despite three days of trying various methods, Long Chen found no solution. Frustrated, he turned to the Earth Cauldron for guidance.

The Earth Cauldron simply said that the dragon race was extremely prideful. Other than their own race’s divine abilities, they did not acknowledge any other things. Thus, if Long Chen wanted the dragon blood to replicate his starry sea, he would need to use his will to drag his dragon blood over to his side. That was a very laborious and time-consuming task, but there was no avoiding it.

With no other choice, Long Chen persisted in integrating his dragon blood with the violet blood starry sea. The challenge now was a test of patience.

The dragon blood was stubbornly proud, completely ignoring the violet starry sea at first. Long Chen was essentially forcing it to look at the starry sea.

When it was forced to look, it shut its eyes in refusal. Long Chen had to rely on the power of his soul and unwavering determination to persist. Gradually, he guided the dragon blood to understand this technique, repeatedly demonstrating the changes in the God Slaying Cross to it.

There was no other way. As forcing it was not an option, he had to use extraordinary means. The Earth Cauldron advised Long Chen to first pique its curiosity and then slowly coax it into learning this technique.

Just like this, Long Chen coaxed and pestered his dragon blood for three whole days. Eventually, the dragon blood reluctantly started to mimic the starry sea.

BOOM!

After successfully replicating the starry sea, Long Chen encountered a problem when attempting to condense the Cross Blood Rune. As soon as the rune started to form on his hand, it exploded, leaving his palm mangled.

After over ten times of failure, his hand was a mess, so he had no choice but to stop. Long Chen tried to ask the Earth Cauldron for more advice, but it didn’t respond. Perhaps it was at some critical juncture and couldn’t be disturbed.

With no other way, Long Chen could only try to figure things out himself. He realized that despite the cooperation of his dragon blood, it lacked enthusiasm. Something crucial seemed to be missing from his approach.

Long Chen continued trying to commune with his dragon blood, but he stopped trying to control it. He gave it more freedom. In response, the dragon blood within the starry sea trembled, and a vague dragon silhouette emerged.

Long Chen’s heart trembled. The dragon image seemed familiar, yet its details remained elusive, appearing only as a faint outline.

Suddenly, Long Chen’s palm grew warm. A dragon diagram appeared on it, with the cross manifesting in the diagram.

As the heat suddenly shot up in intensity, Long Chen’s entire reservoir of dragon blood surged forth. Caught up in the moment, Long Chen shouted, “Sovereign Blood Seal - God Slaying Cross!”

Long Chen unleashed his palm, aiming its power at the training rock. Suddenly, a ripple appeared on the surface of the rock, intercepting his strike. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

The ripple rapidly flickered, flashing seven times in the blink of an eye. The concentrated power Long Chen had unleashed vanished like a clay ox falling into the sea, leaving no trace.

The Earth Cauldron’s pleased voice rang out in his mind. “Well done. You’ve really activated the Dragon Sovereign’s seal.”

“The Dragon Sovereign’s seal? What is that?” Long Chen was startled.

“You will understand in the future. In truth, every magical art or divine ability that reaches the prerequisite power will automatically be given a name. Whether it is the Star Ocean or the Blood Ocean, they all represent a kind of power. But there is a kind of power that transcends all laws—the power of a Sovereign. At first, I thought that with your luck, your chances of activating it were less than one in a million, but you really succeeded. With this, your God Slaying Cross possesses a trace of Sovereign qi, and it will have a terrifying destructive effect against laws. If I let your palm strike the training rock, this entire mountain would instantly disintegrate, and the impact would kill all those resting referees. That’s why I had to block it.”

“It’s that powerful?” Long Chen stared in disbelief at his own hand, overjoyed.
