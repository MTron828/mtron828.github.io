Chapter 4827 Hu Yifei

“Blood race?”

Upon seeing those guards, Long Chen narrowed his eyes. He hadn’t expected to encounter the Blood race here. Furthermore, they were wearing the robes of the city guards.

“Iron Blood Gate... Blood race? Hmm, now it’ll be interesting.” Long Chen was curious, but there was killing intent behind his curiosity.

The Blood race had always been Long Chen’s enemy whether it was on the Martial Heaven Continent or the immortal world. His dislike and repulsion toward them were already carved into his bones and soul. As a result, as soon as he saw them, he wanted to kill them.

“Don’t worry about them, but you shouldn’t kill them either. If they want to play, we’ll accompany them. In any case, the two of us are skilled in culture and martial arts. What do we have to fear?” Mo Nian laughed sinisterly.

Long Chen didn’t say anything and just looked at them. This group of guards consisted of eight people, and their leader in particular gave off a powerful pressure.

They were also Mortal Saints. However, sensing their killing intent, the surrounding people hastily jumped back to make space for them.

Anyone who wasn’t a fool could tell that these eight guards had come to find trouble for Long Chen and Mo Nian. Hence, these civilians wanted to get as far as they could, as they didn’t want to be implicated.

Long Chen was about to place a drop of his blood onto his tablet when the administrator in charge took the incomplete tablet back. Looking at those guards, he said, “Everyone, is there a problem?”

“This person caused trouble just before. Who permitted him to enter the city?” shouted the leader of the guards.

“Senior Yan Feng has dealt with that matter. Shouldn't he be allowed entry into the city?” The administrator frowned, feeling slightly annoyed.

Despite holding a lower position compared to these guards, each of them had their own responsibilities, and they should not meddle in each other’s affairs. The administrator found it irksome that they had approached him with such aggression, as if reprimanding a subordinate.

“Yan Feng abused his position, and these two did not respect the rules. They clearly aren’t good people. They may even have ulterior motives for coming to Devil Fall City! Capture them. We will interrogate them later!” ordered the leader of the guards.

When he waved his hand, the other guards pointed their lances at Long Chen and Mo Nian. Seeing this, Yu Tong and Yu Fei looked grave. However, just as Yu Tong was about to speak, Long Chen raised his hand.

Long Chen looked at Mo Nian and shrugged. “How can I possibly spare these bastards now?”

“How brazen! You dare to be so arrogant with death at hand?!” shouted a guard.

Long Chen looked at those guards and then at Mo Nian, asking, “Are they trying to bait us to attack them?”

“That’s right. They are limited by the rules of this place. Since we haven’t attacked, they can’t either. But once we do, they’ll have a reason to attack us,” replied Mo Nian as he shrugged.

“So that’s the case. Then can we ignore these idiots? They don’t actually dare to attack us,” said Long Chen.

“In theory, yes.”

“You...!” The leader of the group quivered with rage but still didn’t attack. In truth, their furious act of rushing over here was to bait the two of them into attacking or fleeing. Then they would have an excuse to kill them.

However, Mo Nian had already come here and was familiar with the rules, so their plan instantly fell apart.

“Tch, what cowards. Why don’t you just try and touch me?” taunted Long Chen. He then turned back to Mo Nian and inquired, “If they do attack, can I counterattack?”

“Of course? Even if you kill them, you’ll only be brought to Devil Fall City’s judicial hall, and they will judge your innocence,” responded Mo Nian.

“Ok then. Hey, move your firewood. Stop getting in my way.” Long Chen directly pulled the lance in front of him aside and ignored the guards behind him.

Long Chen looked back at the administrator in charge of distributing the tablets. Long Chen didn’t know their relationship, but based on this person’s expression, he could guess.

“Well, what is it? Do you need their approval?”

The administrator handed the tablet back to Long Chen and replied, “Of course not. Just place a drop of your blood onto this, and this tablet will be yours. The payment options are flexible.”

Long Chen was about to receive the tablet when the void quivered, and a powerful force sucked that tablet away.

“These two are suspicious! They cannot be allowed in.” When a slimy voice rang out, a long-haired man suddenly appeared out of thin air, standing casually with his hands clasped behind his back. Although he appeared to be doing nothing, Long Chen's tablet was mysteriously flying toward him.

“Spiritual Strength?”

“That’s Hu Yifei, the Iron Blood Sect’s heavenly genius!” exclaimed someone who recognized him. This Hu Yifei was a major figure in Devil Fall City.

“Hmph, who do you think you are to touch my tablet?” Long Chen snorted. Without any visible movement, his Spiritual Strength surged forth, causing the air to tremble. The tablet hovering in midair suddenly halted as two translucent hands materialized, tugging it back toward Long Chen.

“Their souls have manifested! Heavens, how can their Spiritual Strength be so terrifying?!”

“Most importantly, they aren’t using soul arts. They’re doing it with the most basic Spiritual Strength.”

“Even with no hand seals or soul arts, they can condense their Spiritual Strength enough that it takes form. Just how strong are their souls?”

Soul cultivators weren’t particularly rare in this world but also not particularly common. As a result, most cultivators had some experience against soul cultivators.

However, the ability to compress Spiritual Strength to such a level without using hand seals indicated that Long Chen and Hu Yifei’s Spiritual Strength was so powerful that it exceeded the scope of their understanding.

Those two hands clashed in midair, creating a sudden wave of dizziness that afflicted everyone present. It felt as though needles were piercing into their heads—an ominous reminder of the intensity and danger of spiritual attacks.

BOOM!

With an explosive sound, Long Chen’s soul energy directly crushed his opponent’s spiritual hand.

“What?!”

Every expert present was shocked, including those eight guards. Hu Yifei was a famous expert in the Iron Blood Gate, his power completely unfathomable as he was skilled in spiritual attacks. Unexpectedly, in a clash of Spiritual Strength, he actually lost to Long Chen.

Long Chen’s spiritual hand grabbed his tablet and brought it back to him. He then looked at Hu Yifei indifferently.

“Spiritual Strength is my weak point.”

“You...!” Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Hu Yifei, already incensed by having his spiritual hand thwarted, was further provoked by Long Chen's words, his killing intent surging.

“Who are you? What are you here for?!” demanded Hu Yifei.
