The two of them had just split up when a shocking sword cleaved the void apart, slaying a figure and causing a rain of blood to fall. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

“What’s happening?!”

When Yue Zifeng attacked, countless experts were alarmed, especially those recruiters outside of the academy. They had never seen such sharp Sword Qi before.

Yue Zifeng instantly unleashed seven slashes of his sword. With every slash, a figure hidden in the void exploded.

Only now did people realize that some assassins had somehow slipped into the High Firmament Academy. This was clearly a sneak attack.

BOOM!

Just then, the void exploded, revealing a hand that ripped a headless corpse out of the void.

“It’s Dean Long Chen!” Startled cries rang out.

“Let me do it!” Evilmoon cried out excitedly on Long Chen’s back when the killing started.

“There’s no need to use a saber on chickens...”

“Why do you do this to me?! If you don’t let me fight, I’m going to die!” roared Eilmoon furiously. It was clearly dying from restraining itself. Seeing its reaction, Long Chen had no other option but to let it fight.

Brandishing Evilmoon, Long Chen unleashed a devastating slash that tore the fabric of the void, forcing out over ten figures at once.

Because they could react, they were instantly wiped out of existence.

“Hehe, this really is satisfying!” Evilmoon shouted excitedly like a starved devil beast that finally tasted flesh and blood.

“This is satisfying enough for you? They’re just small fries compared to the ones in front of the gate,” snorted Long Chen.

“You’re like someone full critiquing someone starving. How long has it been? Do you think one meal is enough to keep you from starving for a lifetime?” demanded Evilmoon.

Suddenly, the void quivered, and a slender sword, as wide as two fingers, thrust toward Long Chen's throat. Yet, there was no visible attacker—only the blade itself.

“Heavenly Province, I haven’t gone to find you, but you’ve come to me. Your guts aren’t small,” Long Chen sneered. He pushed Evilmoon forward, and despite attacking second, his attack was the first to land. Evilmoon’s size gave him an advantage in reach.

However, Long Chen’s attack landed on nothing as the slender sword was just a feint. Just as Long Chen unleashed his saber, the void behind him quivered, and dozens of sharp swords pierced toward him.

“Heavenly Province? Is he talking about the legendary Lifehunter race?!”

Startled cries rang out from the experts in the surroundings. After all, the presence of the Heavenly Province instilled fear in all even within the Sovereign Emperor Heaven.

“This aura... they’re assassins from the Sovereign Emperor Heaven!” exclaimed someone. These experts could recognize the similarity in their auras, which showed that these assassins also came from the Sovereign Emperor Heaven.

When the sword-light flashed as quick as lightning, Evilmoon became a blur in Long Chen’s hands. Despite its formidable size, the blade moved with graceful precision, effortlessly parrying each attack that came his way.

“Well done!” Even Evilmoon praised Long Chen this time. A saber was specialized in offense, not defense. Thus, for a hefty blade like Evilmoon, its defensive capabilities could be considered a significant weakness.

However, Long Chen’s combined movement art and saber mastery easily stopped this torrent of attacks, leaving Evilmoon deeply impressed.

“Back on the Martial Heaven Continent, I didn’t properly cherish you. Once you were gone, you often appeared in my dreams. Over the years, despite your absence, I always felt you'd return. So, I honed my movement technique to complement your prowess. Hehe, using a saber against small fries, I’d say I didn’t let myself down,” remarked Long Chen with a smile.

“Don’t be so sappy. It’s sickening,” retorted Evilmoon. Yet, despite its contemptuous tone, it was extremely moved inside.

Back on the Martial Heaven Continent, Long Chen’s cooperation with Evilmoon had never reached this level. It wasn’t until the latter stages of their journey that Long Chen started utilizing it in earnest. Truth be told, he had never undergone proper training with Evilmoon.

At that time, he had always assumed he would have ample opportunity to improve. However, the instant Evilmoon shattered, he was consumed by regret.

Throughout the years, Long Chen had secretly trained in a way to wield Evilmoon properly. Today, those efforts bore fruit as he effortlessly deflected attacks, stunning onlookers. Even novices to the cultivation world knew that sabers specialized in offense, so Long Chen’s defense startled countless people.

“What?”

At that moment, a figure materialized before Long Chen—a man with flowing white hair and eyes wide with astonishment. His sword was like a saw, its blade marred with numerous nicks.

“I blocked seventy-nine slashes of your sword. To not repay you would be rude. If you can block one blow from me, I’ll spare your life,” said Long Chen.

In a sudden motion, Long Chen thrust Evilmoon forward with a seemingly ordinary strike, devoid of any finesse. Yet, as he launched his attack, he appeared to blur, and the saber quivered in his grasp, seemingly sealing off all possible escape routes.

In an instant, Long Chen’s saber pierced through that Lifehunter expert’s chest. When Long Chen attacked, it was like this Lifehunter expert was sealed by some kind of power and was unable to react at all.

“What???”

All the surrounding experts were stunned as they could tell that this person was an extremely powerful existence. His previous barrage of attacks was something even a Sage King would find hard to block.

However, in a flash, a simple yet fatal blow landed on him. They were unable to comprehend this.

It seemed as if only that Lifehunter expert knew what had happened. However, blood now oozed out of his mouth as he was filled with disbelief, unable to even speak.

Just as Long Chen stabbed him, hundreds of figures appeared around Long Chen, and hundreds of swords swung toward him.

“So you are their leader. Tch, that’s all?”

Evilmoon blasted that man apart and swept out, unleashing millions of saber-images that filled the sky.

These Lifehunter experts had come to save their leader, but they were unaware that the moment Evilmoon stabbed him, his life had faded away. Rather than saving him, they simply cast themselves into the path to the underworld.

“That fellow was a nine star Heavenly Doyen...!”

Multicolored blood mist filled the sky as a great deal of Heavenly Doyen power circulated, startling people.

Long Chen was also baffled by this. “He was a nine star Heavenly Doyen? Tch, he died without unleashing a fraction of his real power. How sad.”

Just then, Yue Zifeng charged into the distance. With every stroke of his sword, a hidden figure was slain.

“Since you’ve come, there’s no need to leave. Otherwise, people would say that my high Firmament Academy doesn’t know how to treat their guests.”

Heaven and earth quivered when Long Chen said this. The next moment, an enormous lightning net covered the land.
