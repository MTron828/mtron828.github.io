Chapter 3913 Shi Yang’s Terrifying Trump Card

“Full defense!” Xia Chen’s expression changed. Shi Yang had actually managed to activate the innate divine ability of this immemorial devil corpse. In other words, they were essentially fighting a supreme existence that came from the immemorial era.

“Earth Wall!”

Li Qi and Song Mingyuan's malevolent spirits dissipated, replaced by manifestations imbued with the weight of the earth. As these manifestations materialized, the ground trembled and massive walls of earth formed before them.

However, even with their full-power defense, Shi Yang remained unstoppable as devilish energy surged from his wings, overwhelming their efforts and destroying the earthen walls.

“Dragonblood Cross Slash!”VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

“Golden Lotus Manifests!”

“Heavenly Rainbow Slash!”

Everyone went all-out against the current Shi Yang.

“Ants trying to stop a cart, you don’t even know just how weak you are!” Shi Yang laughed arrogantly.

Those attacks struck Shi Yang’s body, causing huge explosive sounds to occur. But black runes flowed on top of Shi Yang’s body, completely blocking those attacks. They didn’t harm him in the slightest.

“The blood soul power of three million devil experts was required to activate a portion of this immemorial devil corpse’s runes. Although it’s only the most superficial of the runes, this corpse is an unknown existence above Divine Venerates, not something that ants like you can resist. Thus, now I possess a completely impervious body!” Shi Yang directly received all their attacks and then shot toward Long Chen.

BOOM!

The Dragonblood warriors’ formation was forcibly torn open, and the Dragonblood warriors were blown back. There was no stopping the current Shi Yang who was in control of an immemorial devil corpse.

But all of a sudden, a sword slashed through the air at Shi Yang’s neck, forcing him to raise his wings to block it. His expression finally changed.

The sword slashed onto his wings, leaving a bloody wound but not cutting through them.

It was Yue Zifeng. He had abandoned his fight with the Nine Underworld Luocha to come help. However, the current Shi Yang had protective runes moving around him, so his sword was unable to cause a substantial injury.

“You dare to ignore me?!” The Nine Underworld Luocha’s furious roar rang out. But just as she shot over, she saw Long Chen in the coffin and changed directions to him.

However, in an instant, her expression completely changed. Her momentum came to a sudden stop, and she shot back. But it was too late. A dagger had cut across her throat, leaving a bloody wound.

The Nine Underworld Luocha felt some goosebumps. If she had been the slightest bit slower in retreating, her head would have left her body.

At this moment, Dong Mingyu’s figure appeared. She shot after the Nine Underworld Luocha, unleashing a barrage of attacks that repeatedly forced the latter back.

Dong Mingyu’s figure then vanished again, alarming the Nine Underworld Luocha. She had no idea where she disappeared to.

After that, an explosive sound rang out in the distance as two daggers clashed, forcing a wretched figure out of the void.

This wretched figure was precisely the Bloodkill Hall’s number one genius, Ji Wuming.

He was now covered in blood, with over ten bloody holes in his body, looking like a mess. He was then forced toward the Nine Underworld Luocha.

“The two of you can come at me together!”

Dong Mingyu was like a black leopard of the night, beautiful and dangerous. Even one against two, her gaze was still sharp and apathetic, not seeming to be pressured at all.

“Arrogant girl!” Just how prideful was the Nine Underworld Luocha? First, she was blocked by Yue Zifeng, and now it was a little girl. Furthermore, this girl wanted her to work together with Ji Wuming against her? It was an unforgivable insult, the greatest affront to her dignity.

“Don’t be impetuous! Her movement art is strange and specialized against us!” shouted Ji Wuming.

In his fight with Dong Mingyu, he came to understand just how terrifying the Shadow Sect’s inheritance was. It was a perfect counter against him. In front of Dong Mingyu, he was unable to properly release his power. If he hadn’t kept his calm and fought carefully the entire time, he’d have been killed already.

When fighting Dong Mingyu, the worst thing you could do was to get angry. A terrifying assassin like Dong Mingyu would instantly grasp that opportunity to kill you.

“Shut up! You’re the impetuous one! Your whole family is impetuous! I don’t need anyone’s pointers, especially not yours, loser!” cursed the Nine Underworld Luocha disdainfully.

“Idiot girl!”

His kind warning was countered with curses, making Ji Wuming furious. He then looked at Long Chen and the overall battlefield. After that, he decided to work together with the Nine Underworld Luocha to go against Dong Mingyu.

Dong Mingyu was swift like lightning yet also graceful like a flitting hummingbird. She attacked and retreated at will, and even one against two, she was not at a disadvantage at all.

While Dong Mingyu was fighting one against two, forcing the Nine Underworld Luocha and Ji Wuming back, the Dragonblood Legion was in peril.

Even with all of them joining forces, Shi Yang was too powerful. Having sacrificed the lives of his people to activate the runes on his devil corpse, he could now activate the devil corpse’s divine protective light. With it being active, Yue Zifeng’s Sword Qi was unable to cause any fatal injuries to his body.

As for other people’s attacks, they were unable to even leave a mark on his body. Just like that, Shi Yang could just take everyone’s attacks and get closer and closer to Long Chen.

Most vexing of all was that the other experts that had been intimidated away now sensed their chance and charged forward.

As a result, now the Dragonblood Legion didn’t just need to deal with Shi Yang, but also Weng Tianyao, the Underworld Eye Giant, and that strange beast cultivator. The three of them had been waiting for their chance. Once one of them got close to Long Chen, they would definitely launch a killing blow.

The greatest threat right now was Shi Yang. He had an unfathomable sinister smile on his face, which made the Dragonblood Legion feel like the real danger wasn’t just what they were seeing.

Suddenly, in the distance, the heavens exploded and a giant army appeared, all of them overflowing with devil qi.

Those were the devil race’s experts. Their gazes were empty, as if their souls were under control.

“Do you think this is all I have? This is just the start! Using my Corpse Devil Dao’s secret art, I have sacrificed the spectators. And now, my devil qi has infected the entire three thousand worlds. All the devil race’s experts in the Immortal King realm and above have been summoned by me! Once I sacrifice their lives, I will fully awaken this immemorial devil corpse! They just sat back the entire time on the sidelines, and that’s because they lack confidence. But I don’t. Once this immemorial corpse devil is awakened, the three thousand worlds will be mine. This entire world will submit to me!”

Shi Yang lifted his head and let out a peal of sinister laughter, his hands swiftly forming hand seals. The next moment, those millions and millions of devil experts that were rushing over suddenly detonated, filling the sky with endless essence blood.

“Corpse Devil Sacrifice!”

Shi Yang let out a roar and then charged into the sea of blood. As the runes on his body shone brightly, an ancient and ominous aura rose out of him, so powerful that it caused despair.

“Original Devil Seal Soul Purification!”

Suddenly, a ray of divine light descended from the heavens, akin to the sun illuminating the sea of blood.
