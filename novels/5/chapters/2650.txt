Chapter 2639 Devil Soul Gathering Spirit Pearl

“Where is Wilde?” asked Long Chen.

“The Western Desert Ax brought Wilde away, saying that they were going somewhere with plenty of meat that could keep Wilde full. They then vanished,” said Meng Qi.

Long Chen nodded.

The Western Desert Ax was one of the five supreme divine items. Since it had chosen Wilde, it wouldn’t harm him.

However, it had had its source energy extracted, so it had chosen Wilde due to his immense Blood Qi. For an existence like one of the five supreme divine items to thicken its face enough to absorb Wilde’s Blood Qi, it would definitely have to repay him with enough benefits.

It must know where to go to recover as fast as possible. But that method required Wilde.

“Has there been any movement in Devil Spirit Mountain?” asked Long Chen.

“Not at all. Other than some ants, the other experts have retreated,” answered Guo Ran.

It could be said that Long Chen had given the devil race a vicious blow this time. Not only had he killed many of their experts, but he had even released the Western Desert Ax.

If the Alldevil Heavenwalker learned of this, he would probably die of rage. He had originally wanted to avenge the humiliation of a chamberpot pillow, only for Long Chen to strike back and make the devil race pay such a price.

“Xia Chen, have things been arranged with the original devil race?” asked Long Chen.

Xia Chen nodded. “Everything is done. The Space Tearing Formation has also been set up. If they notice something wrong, they can crush their talismans to be brought away.”

Feeling aggrieved at the losses of the original devil race from last time, Long Chen had immediately ordered an emergency transportation formation to be built by Xia Chen to protect their lives.

For this, Xia Chen had spent an enormous amount of resources. Fortunately, the Dragonblood Legion was extremely wealthy now.

Long Chen nodded. This way, the original devil race’s disciples could retreat if the Alldevil Heavenwalker returned.

“Other than that, I also sent over the Devil Soul Gathering Spirit Pearl,” whispered Xia Chen.

This Devil Soul Gathering Spirit Pearl was recently condensed by Xia Chen. It was useless to humans but a priceless treasure to the original devil race. They could use its devil qi to rapidly advance their cultivation bases.

Xia Chen had stealthily set up the formation in order to condense this pearl when the channel to Devil Spirit Mountain was set up. Even the divine families were unaware of it.

In any case,any experts of the devil race that died on that battlefield would have their soul essence absorbed by the formation and locked into the Devil Soul Gathering Spirit Pearl.

If the original devil race’s warriors were present, they could also absorb it, but that would be slightly wasteful. The formation made sure to gather it all.

When Long Chen had killed those mid Heaven Merging experts, along with the old man’s attack that had killed innumerable others, the pearl had instantly filled up. After that, Xia Chen hastily switched it with an empty one, and then to be safe, he arranged for there to be multiple pearls to store the energy.

Right now, everyone in front of Devil Spirit Mountain was calm. Feng Fei stood guard on the left, while Ye Lingshan stood guard on the right.

After that battle, Feng Fei’s temper became much more reserved. She was no longer as impossibly arrogant with the Martial Heaven Continent’s people, so Ye Lingshan had a much easier time communicating with her.

Whether it was Long Chen’s achievements or that attack from the old man, they all showed Feng Fei that the Martial Heaven Continent still had power. She understood far too little about it, resulting in her feeling so superior.

After that day, she finally understood why the divine families had to work together with the Martial Heaven Continent. They truly possessed the qualifications to speak equally with the divine families.

That battle had shaken the entire Martial Heaven Continent. Furthermore, Long Chen had succeeded in his goal of raising their morale. He had entered Devil Spirit Mountain and taken back the Western Desert Ax. Moreover, he had slain their mid Heaven Merging experts. They felt even greater confidence in him and for the upcoming battle of darkness.

Although Long Chen wasn’t a Sovereign, all his accomplishments were not inferior to a Sovereign. Hence, the people’s feelings of despair were gradually expelled.

Even people that were unable to fight on the battlefield made their own contributions without asking for any reward. They helped the Martial Heaven Alliance construct many transportation formations.

Some sects even tore down their own transportation formations and used the materials to build grand formations for the entire continent.

When the battle started, the Martial Heaven Continent would be assaulted from multiple areas. There would not be just one battlefield. Hence, they had to keep up enough transportation formations to reinforce every area.

Although Heaven Merging experts could tear through the void, when the battle started, the Heavenly Daos would become unstable, and teleportation arts would also become shaky. At a critical moment, it would be best to use transportation formations. Because these things could save lives, they built as many as possible. After all, some might be broken in battle, so having backups was necessary.

Under immense pressure, people saw hope. They were united. Even the waves from the original devil race’s return were settled.

During the next few days, Long Chen had a rare moment of peace where he didn’t need to do anything. He spent time with Meng Qi, Chu Yao, and the others. These days passed peacefully.

Liu Ruyan summoned her true body, bringing them above the clouds. This was the only place where it was possible to see night and day.

They were so high up that the spiritual qi in the air became faint. Liu Ruyan didn’t have the mother tree’s ability, resulting in this place not being suitable for cultivation.

However, Long Chen and everyone else had reached the great circle of Netherpassage, and they didn’t need to cultivate. All they needed to do was wait for the day for them to advance for Heaven Merging.

There was a small cabin on the top of Liu Ruyan’s crown, and tinkling laughter occasionally rang out from it. Lying on the giant leaves, Long Chen looked at the starry sky. Hearing their laughter, he felt at peace.

If it wasn’t for the dark clouds below, he might even forget all his past vexations. However, he had too many secrets in his heart. Furthermore, he was incapable of sharing them with others and could only silently suffer.

However, no matter how great the pressure was on him, whenever he saw Meng Qi and the others’ expectant gazes or the Dragonblood warriors’ fiery hopes, he felt limitless drive.

He had everything that he needed. Perhaps this was human life. Sweetness was mixed with bitterness. Joy and sadness were two parts of the same whole. The path of every person’s life was impossible to guess.

Hearing their soft voices, Long Chen closed his eyes and fell asleep. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

“Long Chen! Hahaha, I’ve thought of it!”

Suddenly, Evilmoon’s laughter rang out in Long Chen’s mind, scaring him awake. He almost fell from the tree.
