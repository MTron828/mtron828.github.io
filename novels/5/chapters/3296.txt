Chapter 3285 Vile Dragon Valley

Everyone jumped in shock. Those vines were like pythons, with barbs that looked like teeth covering them.

Seeing this, the mercenary leader stabbed his spear into a distant tree, and a blood-like liquid flowed out of it.

In an instant, those sinister vines went limp. Unexpectedly, these vines were connected to that distant tree.

At this moment, Long Chen had also aimed his arrow at that tree. But his speed was a bit slower than the mercenary leader.

The mercenary leader then turned to Long Chen. “You really are a monster. You actually saw through its disguise.”

The reason the mercenary leader was able to find its true body was due to his experience dealing with them. But Long Chen had never seen such an existence before, yet he had instantly found the true body. His perception was frighteningly sharp.

Long Chen smiled slightly and they continued onwards. The further they went, the more wary they grew.

The mercenary leader said that many of the lifeforms here were unknown. They were very likely not from the immortal world.

Some of them possessed bizarre abilities. One mistake and even an Immortal King would die here.

These lifeforms weren’t valuable either, and so they never came here to risk the danger.

Long Chen investigated some of these lifeforms that attacked them. Their life energy was very ordinary. When he tossed them into the primal chaos space’s black soil, there was no special reaction. They had no cores or Neidans. There truly wasn’t anything valuable about them.

“Up ahead is the Vile Dragon Valley. The Vile Dragon Domain is named after it. We have to pass through the valley to reach the location you wish to go,” said the mercenary leader. He carefully took out some light green juice and distributed it to everyone.

They then rubbed this juice on their bodies. It made their auras merge with the aura of this place. As long as they didn’t reveal any killing intent, it would be much more difficult for others to sense them.

They all sealed their pores and put on camouflage before they continued onwards.

The jungle gradually grew sparse, and their field of view grew clear. Ahead of them was a giant gorge. At this moment, they came to a stop behind a boulder and looked into that abyss.

“Damn.”

Even someone like Long Chen felt a chill. This valley was like a heavenly chasm in their way, and they were unable to see the end.

Within the mountain valley, they saw two-winged dragons circling in the air. Further in the distance, they saw what appeared to be a mountain slowly moving.

However, when they looked more closely, they found that it was no mountain but a gigantic dragon. It was changing locations to nap.

Suddenly, the boulder in front of them shuddered. As a result, they jumped in shock and hastily looked down. A giant dragon was rubbing its back against the cliff wall, causing the ground beneath their feet to crack.

“All these dragons are probably on the level of Immortal Kings. Why can’t I sense their auras at all?” asked Xu Zixiong in shock.DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

“Legend is that there are countless vile dragons here. Their numbers might surpass the billions. Before they attack, you can’t sense them. But once they do attack, it causes chaos within all of Vile Dragon Valley. Thus, coming here is no different than courting death,” said the mercenary leader gravely. Looking at those giant figures, he was terrified.

“The terrain here is special. They are kneeling on the ground and absorbing some kind of energy from the earth to cultivate. If my guess is correct, they won’t leave this valley. Once they leave, their power will leak into the outside world in large quantities. It seems that they possess a special energy, and while they are not in a combat state, they can reduce their energy usage to the point where we can’t sense their auras,” said Long Chen as he eyed those giant dragons that seemed to be in hibernation.

Most of these dragons were earthen dragons. They were considered the lowest level of the dragon race, and they didn’t possess high intelligence.

However, they saw thousands of these dragons present. If they disturbed all of them, it would be difficult for any of them to survive.

“Let’s go.”

This time, Long Chen led the way, and a line of people fearfully walked into the valley. Since their bodies were very small and they could conceal their auras, they were more scared than actually in danger.

However, while everyone else’s nerves were stretched taut, Long Chen was strangely calm. Everyone else’s hair was standing on end.

Sometimes, a dragon would fly through the air, and they would hastily dodge. Once they were safe, they continued onwards.

Those flying dragons would only fly for a while. Some of their dragon might would be unleashed at that time, but then they would find a suitable place for them to rest. After that, their auras would fade, and they entered a hibernation state.

After observing this occur multiple times, everyone came to the same conclusion as Long Chen. They had to be absorbing some kind of strange energy from the ground to cultivate.

After stopping at one place for a long time, perhaps they had absorbed most of the energy and so they switched locations.

There were countless giant dragons here, but they seemed to be coexisting very peacefully. There was no fighting? It was strange.

“Boss-!”

Just as they were advancing, Bai Xiaole cried out, making everyone jump. Shouting in this place was no different than courting death.

Fortunately, his shout didn’t draw the attention of those dragons, so they calmed down. However, the mercenary leader and the others had the urge to kill Bai Xiaole. This brat was practically on the same level as a pig.

Bai Xiaole also knew that he had made a mistake, and he pointed in a certain direction. Looking over there, their hearts also shook.

There were four eggs as big as hills. They had stone patterns on the shells, and if it was just one egg, they really might have mistaken them for boulders.

Now that they looked at them closely, they sensed the fluctuations of life coming from within. It seemed that they would hatch soon.

It was no wonder Bai Xiaole would cry out. They didn’t know what kind of dragon these eggs were, but if it was one of these giant earthen dragons, then their young would be the easiest to tame. If a person could have an Immortal King dragon as a steed, just how amazing would that be?

The most alluring thing was that those four eggs were just sitting there. There were no guards. It seemed that the dragons here were very harmonious and didn’t fight each other.

Just as Long Chen and the others were preparing to sneak their way over to the eggs, an enormous figure flew over their heads. They hastily hid once more.

A dragon had actually chosen to rest near one of those four eggs. It was just a few miles away.

Seeing that, Bai Xiaole almost wanted to curse. In this enormous space, this dragon just had to choose that spot. There was nowhere for them to hide if they tried to sneak over. That area was too wide open.

“Give up. We can consider it later,” said Long Chen helplessly. He also wanted the eggs, but the current situation did not permit it.

The others were all too enticed by those eggs though. Dragon eggs were priceless treasures.

“Long Chen, I feel like we need to discuss the terms again,” said the mercenary leader after a moment’s hesitation.
