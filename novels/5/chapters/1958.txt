Chapter 1948: 1948

“Of course it’ll be profitable . My guess would be that you obtained the Scarlet Blood Spirit Fish in the Yin Yang World . I’ll tell you this: in the past few days, some people in possession of Scarlet Blood Spirit Fish have come to auction them off in our auction houses . As a result, one Scarlet Blood Spirit Fish that was one foot long was sold for three hundred thousand spirit crystals . After that auction, the rest of the continent went mad, with all the various powers trying to obtain the Scarlet Blood Spirit Fish . Some ancient families in particular went crazy . Much of the blessings of their ancestors have been lost, so they want to use the Scarlet Blood Spirit Fish to awaken that power . As for this fish that we’re eating, it has reached three feet in length . It can count as a fish king, and the price could surpass three million spirit crystals . Ugh... such a waste of money, I hope the Wealth God doesn’t punish me . Such extravagance is against one of the Huayun Sect’s eight commandments . ” Zheng Wenlong bitterly smiled .

“Hehe, that’s good . What extravagance? Accompanying a client to a meal is very normal . Eat some more . ” Long Chen was delighted to hear that the Scarlet Blood Spirit Fish was so valuable .

The reason for their popularity wasn’t just because of their miraculous abilities to awaken someone’s bloodline . Another aspect was their delicious taste . It was irresistible .

Although Zheng Wenlong complained about this being too luxurious, his chopsticks never stopped . A large fish was finished just like this .

Long Chen wiped his mouth with a napkin . He smiled . “Brother Wenlong, there’s a saying that it’s easier to bargain after treating someone to a meal...”

Zheng Wenlong hastily raised a hand . “Stop right there . That might be true for others, but it won’t work this time . Don’t try to dredge up any benefits from me . I’m so poor that my underpants are too loose for me to wear now . If you don’t believe me, I’ll show you . ”

“Damn, as expected, the bigger their business, the more stingy people become . Fine, then I’ll show you my products . ”

Long Chen waved his hand, and a giant Scarlet Blood Spirit Fish appeared on the table . It was three meters long and still flopping .

Seeing that giant Scarlet Blood Spirit Fish, Zheng Wenlong jumped in shock . He didn’t even know that Scarlet Blood Spirit Fish could grow to such a size . Just how effective would its essence blood be?

“This is a real fish king, while what we ate before was nothing . Brother Wenlong, can you tell me what price this fish king would sell for?” asked Long Chen .

Zheng Wenlong closely examined it . He even made a close inspection of its tail, fins, and stomach before saying, “This fish king should have surpassed three thousand years of age based on its scales and fins . Its essence blood must be much purer, most likely ten times greater than ordinary Scarlet Blood Spirit Fish . Such a thing is essentially priceless; it doesn’t exist on the market . If a genius were allowed to absorb its essence blood, the chances of them awakening their latent bloodline potential would be extremely high . So I can’t really give an estimate of its price, but based on the value of an ordinary Scarlet Blood Spirit Fish, this fish king should be worth around five to eight million spirit crystals . If it was auctioned, it would probably sell for several times more due to its rarity . ”

Zheng Wenlong’s estimate was very conservative . There was no way to estimate a price if it was auctioned, but five to eight million spirit crystals would be the base price at an auction .

“One would be five million, ten would be fifty million, a hundred would be five hundred million . So then a hundred thousand of them should be enough . ” Long Chen’s eyes lit up . Could this problem really be resolved just like this?

“You... you want to sell a hundred thousand of them?!” Zheng Wenlong almost jumped out of his skin . Long Chen actually had a hundred thousand Scarlet Blood Spirit Fish of this size?

“Yes, I need around five hundred billion spirit crystals, and I’m in a rush . ”

“Five hundred billion?!” Zheng Wenlong gasped . Just what was Long Chen planning on doing with this money? That was a number even he didn’t dare to imagine .

“What? Can the Huayun Sect not handle this business?” asked Long Chen . ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

“We definitely can . But I’ll have to ask the sect leader for instructions for such a huge transaction . Also, I should warn you that selling so many Scarlet Blood Spirit Fish will lower their individual value,” said Zheng Wenlong . From a business standpoint, he didn’t want Long Chen to sell so many at once .

“There’s no way around it . I’m in urgent need of money . Furthermore, the five hundred billion spirit crystals probably won’t be enough . I don’t know much about business, and I don’t have time to haggle over it . Since I trust you and the Huayun Sect, how about this? I’ll give you two hundred thousand Scarlet Blood Spirit Fish as collateral . I’m in urgent need of expensive materials, and I don’t want to wait an extra second . I also have some other spoils from the Yin Yang World, including some divine items that I don’t need . Other than that, I’m prepared to give you a few medicinal pills . I hope that the Huayun Sect can focus more on its alchemy department and fight over the medicinal pill marketplace with Pill Valley . ”

“This matter is too big . I have to speak with the sect master . It would be best if you spoke personally to him . Wait here for a moment . I’ll be right back . ”

Zheng Wenlong left . Although his status was extremely high in the Huayun Sect, and there was no one in the junior generation with such a high level, this matter wasn’t just about money . It also involved their fight against Pill Valley .

“You’re back so quick? What, did the higher-ups not consent?” In just a moment, Zheng Wenlong returned and his expression was a bit strange, startling Long Chen . If the higher-ups didn’t consent, he wouldn’t be able to get the money .

Zheng Wenlong shook his head . He sighed, “The higher-ups want me to handle it myself . ”

“That’s a good thing . It means your authority has risen once more . ” Long Chen smiled . For them to even let Zheng Wenlong handle such a major matter, it seemed that they were raising him to be the next sect master .

If Zheng Wenlong was the master of the Huayun Sect, wouldn’t he have as much money as he wanted in the future?

Zheng Wenlong bitterly smiled . “The greater my authority, the greater the responsibility . Going directly against Pill Valley isn’t something I’m confident in . ”

“Tch, what are you afraid of? I’ve been going against Pill Valley ever since the Pill Tower in the Eastern Wastelands, but aren’t I still living happily? Let me tell you, this is a kind of test the higher-ups have given you . They want you to accumulate experience . Plus, the Huayun Sect and Pill Valley are both enormous existences . You’re on the same level, so why worry? I didn’t have anyone backing me, but if I was backed by an enormous existence like the Huayun Sect, would you believe me if I said I could bankrupt Pill Valley within three years?”

How could Zheng Wenlong believe that? Or how could he not believe that? Even without any backing, Long Chen had managed to throw the continent into chaos . If he actually had a powerful backer? Perhaps the continent would be under his control now .

However, Zheng Wenlong was not Long Chen . He was a businessman and had to view this from a business standpoint, calculating the profits and expenses, the danger and risk . He could not get hot-headed .

“Fine, give me the list of things that you need . I’ll see how much I can gather . However, I definitely don’t have enough money to buy it all right now, so it’ll have to be bought in batches . But don’t worry, since the higher-ups have given me this authority, I can gather some resources from the headquarters without wasting any time . As for the Scarlet Blood Spirit Fish, give them to me . I definitely won’t be selling them all at once . We might be brothers, but business is business . To lower the risk, I can only count each Scarlet Blood Spirit Fish as three million spirit crystals . Once they’re all sold, we can recalculate the actual price they sold for . As for your divine items, they’re easy to handle . Other than Pill Valley, every other major power on the continent is secretly trying to keep up a good relationship with us . Selling the divine items to them won’t cause any trouble . As for the pill formulas, it’s still the same rules . Once they’ve been successfully sold, you’ll be given a share based on the profit . However, that will be much slower...”

“Alright, I don’t really need to know all the details . I just want to urgently gather these resources . Let me put it to you this way . I’m preparing to do something big, so these resources are necessary,” said Long Chen .

Right now, he was being hunted by the various major powers of the continent . That was because he didn’t have the power to challenge them .

However, that was only now . With the Scarlet Blood Spirit Fish having awakened the Dragonblood warriors’ bloodlines, as long as they reached the first Heavenstage of Life Star, they would be able to control world energy . Over twelve thousand Life Star Empyreans with divine items, just who would they be afraid of?

Long Chen was in a race against time because Pill Valley would not be waiting around either . He didn’t know what kind of scheme they were plotting, but he had to raise his power until he could contend against the major powers .

Long Chen then handed hundreds of divine items to Zheng Wenlong . Those were divine items with strange forms and usages that the Dragonblood Legion couldn’t use .

Long Chen wrote down hundreds of pill formulas, making Zheng Wenlong jump . Those pills were the most popular pills that Pill Valley sold . If the Huayun Sect could make them as well, perhaps they’d be able to take over half of the pill market .

Zheng Wenlong knew that Long Chen was getting ruthless . He wanted Pill Valley to suffer, so he was ruining their monopoly on their core pills .

Zheng Wenlong had always felt Long Chen to be mysterious . It seemed that there was no one else in this world who would do things like him .

After writing out the pill formulas, Long Chen was preparing to leave . However, Zheng Wenlong clenched his teeth, hesitating .

“Brother Long, there is a certain matter that I don’t know whether or not I should tell you about . ”
