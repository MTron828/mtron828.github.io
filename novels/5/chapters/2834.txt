Chapter 2823 Old Foes Meet Once More

This person was someone Long Chen recognized. He was the first person who felt that they needed to report their own name after Long Chen entered the immortal world. Pan Mingxiong.

When Long Chen had been asking a woman in line for some information, she had felt pity for him and not only answered him but was also willing to lend him the fee for the registration.

Pan Mingxiong had been irritated by this for some reason. It was unknown if he was jealous of Long Chen’s looks or simply looked down on people from the lower world. Due to his unclean mouth, Long Chen decided to slap him to clean it out.

Afterward, both of them were disqualified, and Long Chen found a different way to enter the academy. As for this fellow, he did the same thing.

Pan Mingxiong had said that he had a big brother in the academy that was on the divine rankings. However, those two law enforcement disciples didn’t care and still kicked him out.

Seeing him in disciple robes and drinking with a few others, Long Chen saw that he still had his previous arrogant appearance. His way of looking down his nose at people hadn’t changed in the slightest.

At this time, he was looking at a woman in a corner. She wore ordinary robes and didn’t have a powerful aura. She was quietly eating her bowl of food with her head down.

While everyone else was eating lavish meals, she was hiding in a corner eating something. That did appear a bit poor.

Long Chen looked at her and was startled to see a bump on her stomach. She was actually pregnant.

As soon as Pan Mingxiong spoke, she blushed. She wanted to leave, but she hadn’t finished eating, so she hesitated.

“With such aptitude, it would be best to just leave the academy instead of embarrassing yourself here. With your own talent lacking, are you hoping for your child to fight for you? Have you not heard that dragons birth dragons, phoenixes birth phoenixes? A mouse’s child can only dig holes. Are you unaware that your table manners are disgusting for others to witness? What are you waiting for? Hurry up and scram. You’re just as disgusting as those rats from the lower world,” sneered Pan Mingxiong.

The woman quivered with rage and couldn’t hold back her tears. However, she still stood and prepared to leave.

Just at this moment, an icy voice rang out. “I really am puzzled. How is it that an idiot who can only turn food into crap feels qualified to mock someone who can turn food into a new life?”

Mu Qingyun, Zhong Ling, Zhong Xiu, and the others were equally disgusted by Pan Mingxiong’s words. However, just like that, Long Chen made that anger transform into laughter. Mu Qingyun couldn’t help it. Long Chen’s humor always came without warning, making it impossible to guard against.

“Which bastard is talking?! Get out here!” roared Pan Mingxiong.

Long Chen walked in. When Pan Mingxiong saw him, his eyes widened. He then smiled in twisted delight.

“Good brat, I was actually thinking of how to find you! But you actually sent yourself to me.”

Seeing Long Chen still wearing his tattered black robes, he was reminded of their first meeting. The humiliation from back then instantly caused his anger to soar.

That slap had resulted in him being disqualified, and he had been forced to use a backdoor to enter the academy. It had cost quite a bit and required many connections.

That slap had not just cost him his dignity, but it had also cost him a large sum of wealth. Hence, his eyes reddened at this moment.

“Brother Pan, has this brat offended you? I’ll teach him a lesson for you.” Another disciple eating with him stood, rubbing his fists.

“No need. I’ll show you my true abilities today. I’ll make sure to tear out every single one of his tendons and rip off his skin…” Pan Mingxiong laughed and charged at Long Chen.

Mu Qingyun, Zhong Ling, Zhong Xiu, and the others who had come with them shook their heads, almost tearing away.

Pow!

As expected, Pan Mingxiong was slapped in the face. Half his face caved in, and the sound of bones breaking made their goosebumps rise.

Pan Mingxiong then spun like a spinning top. After that, Long Chen’s right foot was as quick as lightning, landing on his coccyx. As a result, Pan Mingxiong’s body instantly curled up like a shrimp, his eyes almost flying out of his head.

“AH!” Pan Mingxiong screamed and was kicked away like a cannonball, flying out of the window. His scream was echoing into the distance and slowly faded as he flew to an unknown location. Eventually, it faded altogether. It was unknown if that was due to flying too far or if he simply fainted midway.

The others who had been with him stared at the window, dumbfounded.

“Jackals from the same tribe. Scram!”

Long Chen’s foot struck three more times, resulting in three more screams as they all flew out of the window, their bones broken.

Just as he was about to strike the last one, that person hastily raised his hands. “Brother, I won’t trouble you. I’ll do it myself.”

That person took off his shoe and struck his own butt with it. Just like the others, he screamed and then jumped out of the window.

Long Chen was too confused to even react. Before he could react, that fellow had already run. Who would have thought that this fellow actually had some smarts? He had escaped this kick.

Zhong Ling and Zhong Xiu then quivered with laughter. On this one day, they had laughed more than the past few months together.

Meanwhile, the other guests eating were too scared to make a sound. The ones to come eat here were disciples, workers, and managers, but they had never seen such a vicious character. That was especially true when they spotted Mu Qingyun beside him. Her name was quite famous here.

Seeing her standing behind Long Chen like he was the leader, those people couldn’t help guessing what his status was.

“Big sister, eat here in peace. If your money came honorably, you can have a clear conscience eating here. This world never has anything like people who are higher or lower. Just be your best self and ignore those idiots,” said Long Chen to the pregnant woman.

She was originally pale with fright, but seeing him smile, the image of a fiend vanished, seemingly becoming a friendly neighborhood boy.

“Many thanks,” she said.

“Waiter, bring this big sister two snowflake beef, a wide-tail saury, and a white-cut snow chicken. I’ll pay later,” said Mu Qingyun to a waiter who was hiding.

“Senior apprentice-sister, I’ve already eaten my fill! I can’t eat that much…”

“That’s alright. If you can’t finish it, bring it with you. Even if you don’t want it, that child inside you might want some,” said Mu Qingyun with a smile.

That pregnant woman’s eyes reddened. She couldn’t help crying as she thanked Mu Qingyun.

After that, Long Chen and Mu Qingyun ascended another level, arriving at a private room. Mu Qingyun had Long Chen sit in the lead position, but Long Chen refused no matter what, so Mu Qingyun took that position.

Everyone had just sat down when a group of disciples wearing the robes of the law enforcers also walked in.

“May I ask where instructor Long Chen is?” asked one of those disciples politely with a smile.F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com
