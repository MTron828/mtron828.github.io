Chapter 4607 Ghost Camphor Tree Demon

BOOM!

Just as Long Chen detonated these two powers, the huge mouth spat him out. This lifeform’s reaction speed was extremely fast.

However, the mix of lightning and flames still blasted its mouth, causing a furious roar to shake the surroundings.

As the giant head withdrew into the blood lake, the Great Sun Sunflower also started to sink.

However, before it could submerge, Long Chen grabbed it and pulled, ripping the Great Sun Sunflower out by the roots.

As soon as Long Chen extracted the Great Sun Sunflower, the blood pool erupted violently, unleashing a frenzied aura. A colossal head materialized once more, unleashing a torrent of blood-colored energy directly toward Long Chen.

Swiftly evading the attack, Long Chen watched as the blood-colored beam tore through the ceiling. In response, he swiftly tossed the Great Sun Sunflower into the primal chaos space.

Amidst the chaos, Long Chen found himself confronted by a grotesque entity bearing the likeness of a fish-headed monstrosity, accompanied by a mass of writhing tentacles. Though resembling a tree demon, Long Chen was unable to tell what exactly it was.

The tree demon went crazy, its tentacles surrounding this area like a heaven-encompassing net.

“Now that I’ve obtained the Great Sun Sunflower, do you think I’m afraid of you?” Long Chen sneered. As his own Blood Qi erupted, a dragon cry rang out, accompanied by a surging wild aura that blew the underground space apart.

The aura directly shattered countless tentacles. Long Chen then shouted, and a giant dragon claw reached out of his manifestation.

BANG!

The dragon claw struck that tree demon in the head, directly crushing it.

The tree demon emitted an eerie wail as its head burst apart, yet its tentacles, akin to serpents, swiftly burrowed into the earth.

Long Chen was taken aback by the creature’s resilience; even without its head, it continued to slither away into the depths.

Just as Long Chen thought that he had dealt such a serious wound to the tree demon that it was fleeing, the ground erupted in a violent upheaval. A colossal head, dwarfing mountains, emerged from below, shocking Long Chen to his core. So, the mother tree had been lurking underground all along, and the thing Long Chen had injured earlier was likely its offspring.

A giant head broke out of the earth, and then an enormous golden vine whipped through the air at Long Chen.

BOOM!

Long Chen swung his fist toward the golden vine, followed by a powerful explosion that shook this space. The vine exploded, but Long Chen grunted and fell back, his blood flipping inside of him.

The mother tree seethed with anger, summoning countless golden vines from above and below, threatening to destroy this space.

“Isn’t this an existence on the level of a Sage King?!”

Long Chen’s expression changed. He hadn’t expected such a terrifying existence to be hidden underground. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Attack together!” Long Chen shouted. Lei Linger and Huo Linger then joined in the fray, attacking the endless golden vines.

Lightning crackled and flames roared as Long Chen, Lei Linger, and Huo Linger burst forth from the golden vines.

The damaged golden vines released golden droplets that scorched the earth upon contact, leaving smoldering craters in their wake. The tree demon’s blood proved to be exceedingly toxic.

At this moment, the earth exploded, revealing a horde of surging blood-colored tree demons. They resembled the one that had ambushed Long Chen earlier.

“Don’t get entangled! Charge out!”

As Long Chen saw this scene, his heart shook. He had thought that it was just a single mother and son, but unexpectedly, the mother tree had millions of children.

If they were bogged down by them, even with Long Chen’s big energy reserve, he would eventually run out of energy.

The three of them unleashed all their power, spamming their ultimate moves like they were cabbages. After an hour of blasting their way through the blockades, they finally escaped the encirclement.

After fleeing the desert and diving into a forest, they could finally take a breather.

Long Chen didn’t dare to go any deeper. The desert was that tree demon’s territory, so who knew what kind of terrifying existence was guarding this forest? Perhaps it would be even more terrifying than the tree demon.

Long Chen refrained from provoking whatever formidable entity lurked within the forest, taking the opportunity to swiftly replenish his energy. Similarly, Huo Linger and Lei Linger also required a moment to regain their strength.

The golden tree demon had been absolutely terrifying, its seemingly endless golden tentacles posing a real threat. Despite Long Chen’s effort to dismantle them all, new ones emerged without pause.

Fortunately, Lei Linger and Huo Linger’s powers could counter the tree demon, and their blades were able to slice through those tentacles.

Even so, the two had used up a great deal of energy. If the tree demon had managed to tie them up for another two hours, the three of them would have used up all their energy and dropped dead.

“Senior, what kind of monster was that? How was it so tough?” asked Long Chen.

“It was a Ghost Camphor Tree Demon, an undying lifeform with a tough life force and great craftiness. The mother trees usually hide deep underground and only send their son-spirits to fight for them. The son-spirits are like the ones that targeted you at the start. In truth, the son-spirits are puppets that the mother trees raised. When it spotted you and you acted weak, I thought that you already knew about its nature. I had assumed that you had a plan when you let it draw you into its den,” replied the Earth Cauldron.

Long Chen smiled bitterly. “How could I know what this Ghost Camphor Tree Demon was? I thought that if it was sneaking up on me so furtively, it shouldn’t be that strong in direct combat, so I wanted to trap it. However, its true body was absolutely terrifying. If I didn’t have help from these two, I would have faced a true disaster today. If it’s from the Undying race, I can understand why it’s so strong. I just wonder what relationship it has with the Undying Willow race.”

“Amongst the Undying race, there are high-tier lifeforms and low-tier lifeforms. The Ghost Camphor Tree Demons are low-tier lifeforms, and they have no relationship with the Undying Willow race,” answered the Earth Cauldron.

“How can a low-tier lifeform be so terrifying?!” exclaimed Long Chen.

“You've misunderstood,” the Earth Cauldron interjected. “The tiers are not indicative of power but rather intelligence. Take the Ghost Camphor Tree Demon, for instance. Despite its strength, you would still possess a means to kill it, correct?”

“Yes. I was just caught off-guard by it. If you gave me some time, I could come up with many ways to deal with it,” said Long Chen. Now, he understood what the Earth Cauldron was saying about high and low-tier lifeforms. “Then senior, what level was that tree demon?”

“To use your human race’s rankings, it would be considered to be in the Divine Venerate realm.”

“What?!” Long Chen’s jaw dropped.
