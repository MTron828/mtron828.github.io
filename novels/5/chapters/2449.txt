Chapter 2439 The Luo Spirit Race

Translator: BornToBe

This woman was the one who had led Long Chen away from the spatial crack at the start. Only later had he realized that she had recognized him as an enemy of the foreign race. Under the principle of the enemy of my enemy is my friend, she had informed him that he had to leave.

When the spatial crack had appeared, he had realized that the race that he had been fighting were mortal enemies with her race. They would rather destroy their own territory and bring forth a giant spatial tear rather than submit.

The woman had most likely noticed something, which was why she had tried to lead him away. But the enemy race hated him and launched suicidal attacks just to drag him down with them.

“You… awake… now?” The woman smiled and began to speak the language that Long Chen understood. However, it was still stiff and sounded a bit off.

“Thank you. Were you the one who saved me?” asked Long Chen. Most likely, this woman had studied his language but didn’t speak it fluently, so he began gesturing as he spoke.

The woman seemed to be making a great deal of effort to understand him. After a moment, she shook her head. “You… boat… fell…”

The woman followed Long Chen’s way of gesturing, indicating that when he had fallen off of the Ghost Ship, they had picked him up.

This method of communication was too laborious. Long Chen hesitated and then extended a finger, slowly reaching out to touch her forehead. The woman backed up a bit, but seeing that he was indicating not to move, she also hesitated but allowed him to touch her forehead.

Long Chen’s Spiritual Strength slowly entered her mind-sea. He found that her Spiritual Strength was extremely weak. Based on human realms, it hadn’t even reached the Xiantian realm.

Long Chen slowly placed his spiritual seal within her mind-sea. Her body shuddered and she winced.

This spiritual seal contained his language memories of the Martial Heaven Continent. This would allow her to communicate with him easier. However, perhaps it was because her own Spiritual Strength was so weak or the laws here were different, but this seal that should have settled easily was causing some pain.

Suddenly, a figure charged in and smashed a fist at Long Chen, shouting something that he couldn’t comprehend.

Long Chen raised his hand and blocked it. However, a sharp pain wracked his entire body, and he was punched off the bed. The thing that shocked him the most was that he wasn’t wearing any clothes. When the beast hide blanket slipped off, he hastily pulled it back on to cover up his privates.

The newcomer was a large man. Seeing that Long Chen wasn’t wearing any clothes, he was even further enraged. He took his bow off his back and had an arrow pointed at Long Chen in an instant. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

“Ka A Li!” The woman hastily blocked him, enraging him. He pointed at Long Chen, shouting something.

Looking at Long Chen, the woman seemed to realize something, but the man was still furious. He stamped his foot and left.

Long Chen looked around and found that he was in a simple tent. Based on the arrangement of the tent, it seemed that it was a woman’s residence. Then adding on that man’s furious reaction, it seemed that this was her private abode.

“Sorry, La Wei is too hot-headed,” said the woman. She was able to speak much easier, but her voice was still a bit rough.

“Is he your fiancé?” asked Long Chen curiously.

The woman nodded.

“His temper’s pretty good then. If it was me and I found my fiancée had a naked man in her bed, I’d have killed him.”

Long Chen slowly rose, only for a bout of dizziness to almost knock him down. He found that he was exceptionally weak. The woman tried to support him, but Long Chen declined. That was definitely not a good situation to be in.

“What is going on?” Long Chen asked Evilmoon.

“You were corroded by the power of time from the Ghost Ship. That Ghost Ship has drifted through the river of time, weaving through the cracks between worlds. When you grabbed the Ghost Ship’s chain, your mind was too befuddled to resist the power of time. Anyone else would have been turned to dust, as no one can resist the encroaching of time. It was your primal chaos space that blocked a portion of it, or you would have turned into an old man in just a breath’s time. Your body is still seriously injured though. Since you’ve woken up, it shouldn’t be long before you recover,” said Evilmoon.

Long Chen recalled when he had grabbed the chain. At that time, he had fallen into a dream with countless scenes. Perhaps those scenes had been reality.

Ghost Ships had always been mysterious existences. No one had ever understood them. No one knew where they came from or where they were going.

“What a pity I didn’t get to step onto one and see,” said Long Chen regretfully. At that time, he had run out of energy from trying to charge through the spatial barrier. If he had been in his peak, perhaps he would have been able to get onto it.

“Miss, can I ask you to leave for a second while I put on my clothes?” asked Long Chen.

The woman blushed slightly and retreated, leaving him alone. Long Chen investigated his body, finding that his skin had split open in countless places. It was as if he had been cut by thousands of blades. Those wounds had yet to heal, and moving caused more blood to flow out of them.

“The blades of time have left a strange energy in these wounds.” Long Chen found that the recovery of these wounds was going extremely slow.

He put on new clothes and tidied up his hair. He also began to use the life energy within the primal chaos space to heal.

When the life energy entered his body, it resonated with his own life energy, nourishing him.

The primal chaos space’s trees quickly withered. Even after withdrawing all their energy, he had only recovered halfway.

Long Chen couldn’t help shaking his head. The primal chaos space’s trees had to be switched out. They were no longer able to keep up with his needs.

He started moving, finding that he was now at least able to move without bleeding, although he wasn’t in a state to do battle. Long Chen walked out of the tent to find himself in a tribe.

“Let me introduce myself. I am Qi Li, the daughter of the Luo Spirit race’s leader. I’m very grateful to you for helping us defeat the Thorned Devil race. We will always remember your favor.” The woman suddenly knelt down on one knee toward Long Chen solemnly, her right hand over her chest in a strange etiquette.

“You're too courteous.” Long Chen hastily lifted her up. “To tell the truth, I wasn’t there to help you. They wanted to kill me, so I had to defend myself. If thanks are necessary, I should be thanking you for risking your life to get me out of there. May I ask where you picked me up?”

Qi Li informed him that they had all felt bad upon seeing him sucked into the spatial crack, thinking that he had died. They had been cleaning up the battlefield to see if there were any of their enemies that were still alive when a giant boat had flown out of the spatial crack. Then they had seen him fall off of it.

At that time, he had been covered in blood and unconscious, so they had brought him back.

Hearing that, Long Chen couldn’t help being embarrassed. It couldn’t be that she had been the one to clean up his wounds, right? But he couldn’t ask.

“Come, I’ll bring you to see my father.” Qi Li beckoned, and Long Chen nodded and followed.

Looking around, Long Chen saw that they were living in a very spacious plain. There were many tents set up of varying sizes and colors. They were all made of beast hide.

This seemed to be a very ancient tribe. He saw people wearing beast hides and carrying bows on their backs. Behind the tribe was a flourishing forest that extended beyond the horizon. Curiously, this tribe seemed to follow the forest.

Qi Li led the way, and quite a few people bowed toward her, along with some strange etiquette that Long Chen didn’t know. They looked at Long Chen curiously but also with some unease.

“Do you have no children here?” asked Long Chen. He didn’t see a single child in this giant tribe.

“Our young tribesmen are training in the forest. Only the grown-up members are qualified to walk out of the forest,” explained Qi Li. “This is one of our front-line strongholds. We’ve been mortal enemies with the Thorned Devil race for hundreds of thousands of years. They were launching a sneak attack on us that we managed to successfully stop. They took heavy losses, so they activated the sacrificial altar to summon devil kings for support. We wouldn’t be a match if they summoned hundreds or thousands of them, so we had prepared ourselves to retreat into the forest to use the beneficial terrain for a battle to the death, but you interrupted them. You managed to stop them, preventing the loss of many of our lives, so you really are our benefactor. My father will definitely thank you.”

Long Chen hadn’t expected such a coincidence. Qi Li seemed very grateful. The two of them continued walking, when suddenly, thousands of her people appeared in front of them, all of them pointing arrows at Long Chen with killing intent raging in their eyes. Amongst them, he saw Qi Li’s fiancé.

Long Chen shook his head. “It seems that your people aren’t very welcoming of me!”
