Chapter 4130 Refusing the Consequences

Hundreds of Heaven Venerates descended at the same time, and the one leading them was a terrifying innate Heaven Venerate. As they appeared, they completely locked down this city.

The pressure of an innate Heaven Venerate caused the world to change color. When he showed up, all the experts in the city felt like they were suffocating.

An innate Heaven Venerate leading hundreds of ordinary Heaven Venerates against a group of tiny Immortal Kings, this lineup was shocking enough to stun everyone in the city.

“The Soaring Dragon Company is arresting a wanted criminal! Unrelated people, please fall back to avoid any unwanted casualties!” shouted the innate Heaven Venerate.

This innate Heaven Venerate appeared to be in his fifties, with half of his hair gleaming white and the other half deep black. A swirling current of primal chaos qi enveloped his figure, and with every blink of his eyes, primal chaos runes flickered. His gaze was so profound that people didn’t dare to look directly into his eyes.

When he spoke, his voice contained an unquestionable power to it. Although he said please, he left no room for negotiation. He clearly didn’t place any of the experts in the city in his eyes.

His exact meaning could be more bluntly put as: If you don’t want to die, then scram!

As expected, all the spectators retreated. They could see that the Soaring Dragon Company was intent on crushing Long Chen, so if they got too close, they might get drawn into their battle.

Although they didn’t know Long Chen well, they knew that no one would dare to so openly plunder the Soaring Dragon Company without a backer. In their opinion, Long Chen most likely represented some kind of power that was targeting the Soaring Dragon Company. In a bit, that power would probably be revealed.

With everyone else leaving the city, the shopkeeper of the Soaring Dragon Company was revitalized and shouted, “You goddamn bastard, hahaha, your retribution has finally-!”

Before he even finished speaking, he was slapped away by Long Chen, smashing through several buildings like a shooting star. As he finally crashed on the ground below, blood sprayed out of his mouth, and tears even dripped out of his eyes from the pain.

In the blink of an eye, he went from laughing arrogantly to crying wretchedly. Quite a few people admired Long Chen’s methods. No matter what, his guts were very astonishing. Even with an innate Heaven Venerate present, he still dared to be so arrogant.

“Fuck, let me just warn you once. First, it’s very rude to point at people when talking to them. Second, if you want to talk, just talk. Don’t spray your saliva all over my clothes.” Long Chen pointed at the shopkeeper and scolded.

“Hmph, even with death at hand, you’re still in the mood to quibble. Brat, you really are foolish.” The innate Heaven Venerate sneered at Long Chen.

“With death at hand? Who’s going to kill me, you?” Long Chen looked at the innate Heaven Venerate and smiled derisively. “That would depend on just how much ability you actually have.”

Long Chen really didn’t place this Heaven Venerate in his eyes. After all, not all innate Heaven Venerates were frightening.

This innate Heaven Venerate of the Soaring Dragon Company might have a powerful aura, but the pressure he gave off was actually a level weaker than the dark domain lord of the Linglong World, let alone an existence like Xu Jianxiong.

That could only mean that this fellow’s actual power wasn’t that great, but he was quite arrogant. It was most likely a case of living too peacefully and only relying on his status and aura to suppress his opponents. Otherwise, against a real opponent, he’d have long since been killed.

“Hahaha!” The innate Heaven Venerate laughed as if he had just heard the world’s funniest joke. However, as his laughter contained the might of a Heaven Venerate, heaven and earth resounded with it, causing his voice to be like invisible needles stabbing into people’s souls. As a result, countless people covered their ears and circulated their Spiritual Strength to resist it, scrunching up their faces in fear and pain.

As for Long Chen and his companions, they were completely unaffected and simply glanced at him indifferently. This kind of spiritual attack was nothing to experts who had crawled out of a mountain of corpses and seas of blood.

The innate Heaven Venerate’s laughter continued for several breaths’ time. However, upon seeing their expressionless indifference, he finally stopped laughing.

“Why aren’t you laughing more? Keep your performance up!” Long Chen shrugged.

The Heaven Venerate’s countenance darkened a bit. He hadn’t expected Long Chen to be unaffected, so he was embarrassed.

At this time, under their supervision, all the experts inside the city had left, leaving behind only Long Chen and the others.

The Soaring Dragon Company’s other Heaven Venerates completely surrounded this area, slowly shrinking their enclosure.

However, even in this situation, Long Chen and the others seemed completely calm and fearless. Seeing their composure, quite a few people wondered just what kind of existence stood behind them for them to stay so indifferent at this moment.

Looking around, they didn’t see any other powerful existences. Although the city was filled with experts, there was not a single innate Heaven Venerate.

“Long Chen, it’s time for you to reap the consequences of your own actions. You inexperienced brats always think that a little bit of power makes you unrivaled in the world. I won’t waste words. Hand over the Heaven Earth Cauldron and be captured obediently. That is your only chance of survival,” said the innate Heaven Venerate.

When he said this, the spectators were all startled. Were the rumors true? Did Long Chen really have the Heaven Earth Cauldron?

“If it is just to go against your Soaring Dragon Company, I won’t be reaping any consequences. You really came at the right time though. You can be the proof that I’m not a scammer. Everyone, you all heard it! He said that I had the primal chaos divine item, the Heaven Earth Cauldron! You all believe me now, right?!” Long Chen looked toward the distant experts.

Those experts stared at him suspiciously. At this time, he was still quibbling about who believed him and who thought that he was a scammer? Did he not care about his life?

“Shut up! Hand over the Heaven Earth Cauldron or die! You choose!” shouted the innate Heaven Venerate. He was getting impatient.

Long Chen continued, “Did you hear that? He is enunciating it very clearly! I have the Heaven Earth Cauldron! So believe me when I say that I have it. If your family or sect wants it, come to me with an offer. As long as you can offer a high enough price, you will have an opportunity to obtain a legendary treasure! Don’t miss this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity!”

Seeing Long Chen acting like he didn’t hear him, the innate Heaven Venerate was so enraged that his face twitched. All of a sudden, he vanished from sight.

Long Chen was in the midst of gesturing and trying to drum up business when he suddenly swung his hand toward an empty space.

BOOM!

The void in that empty space exploded, cracking like a mirror. Following that, everyone saw a scene that left them dumbfounded, leaving their jaws agape.𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com
