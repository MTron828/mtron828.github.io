Chapter 2866 Long Chen’s Calculations

BOOM!

Lightning flashed beneath Long Chen’s feet once more as he dodged. Chu Kuang was unable to lock down Long Chen.

After that, Chu Kuang furiously unleashed seven blows, while lightning continued to flicker beneath Long Chen’s feet.

Although every one of Chu Kuang’s attacks was incredibly close to Long Chen, they were still missing by just a little bit, unable to injure him.

The way that Long Chen was dodging so closely made Luo Ning and Luo Bing’s hearts pound just by watching. They hadn’t expected Chu Kuang to be concealing himself so deeply. Before this, Luo Bing had thought that Chu Kuang was only slightly stronger than her, and there was an aspect of luck in her defeat.

Now she understood just how great the difference between them was. She also thought of how many times Ruxin had leaked Chu Kuang’s movements outside the academy to her, encouraging her to go kill him.

After thinking of that, sweat dripped down her back. Chu Kuang truly was sinister. He had intentionally made himself appear weak to bait her out of the academy and kill her.

If it weren’t for multiple accidents occurring, causing her to not go, perhaps she would have fallen for his trap. Chu Kuang wasn’t as brainless as his name made him seem. He actually schemed so deeply.

“Do we go help him?”

Seeing that Chu Kuang was so powerful that Long Chen couldn’t even counterattack, Luo Ning grew anxious. If Long Chen was struck by one of those attacks, they would be truly defeated.

“Chu Kuang has already activated his bloodline power. We can’t even get close to him as we’ll only cause trouble for Long Chen if we go. However, Chu Kuang cannot maintain such a furious tempest of attacks. Once his aura drops, we can attack together and possibly kill him,” said Luo Bing.

She was clearer on the Chu family’s foundation. Chu Kuang couldn’t maintain this bloodline power for long considering that he still wasn’t in the Divine Flame realm.

Although it looked like Long Chen was at a disadvantage, his movements were still stable. While it looked like he was only narrowly dodging every move, he did it skillfully and easily. It seemed that he was waiting for his opportunity. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

BOOM!

Just at this moment, the flame lion that Chu Kuang had blown back returned. Chu Kuang’s attacks seemed to have infuriated it. Aiming at Chu Kuang, it opened its mouth and unleashed a flame sword.

Chu Kuang was infuriated. Why did this lion not go bite Long Chen, or even Luo Bing or Luo Ning?

That was because of Chu Kuang’s powerful divine flame seed. It hadn’t been ignited yet, but it was even stronger than the divine flame seeds of all the disciples that the flame lion had just devoured combined.

Furthermore, Chu Kuang’s attacks had further provoked it. Considering its low intelligence, with this provocation, it would only crazily target him.

All of this was within Long Chen’s calculations. He didn’t know that this was the Scarlet Spirit Flame, but he had a feeling that as long as he did this, it would attack Chu Kuang. His intuition was always accurate.

BOOM!

Long Chen rapidly retreated, leaving Chu Kuang to deal with the flame lion’s attack by himself. As a result, when it struck, Chu Kuang hacked up blood, and his entire body was charred. He screamed.

“The fragrance of meat has appeared. Do I need to give you some cumin and pepper?” Long Chen smiled in the distance.

“Long Chen, just you wait!” Chu Kuang was enveloped by flames. That terrifying attack left him in sharp pain. He wasn’t even able to extinguish these flames right now.

If he focused on extinguishing them, that would give Long Chen a chance to attack. That might cost him his life. Hence, borrowing the force of the flame lion’s attack, he rushed into the distance.

“Take care!”

Long Chen didn’t chase him. Instead, he amicably waved to send him off. This was his way of telling Luo Ning and Luo Bing not to block him.

Chu Kuang was truly crafty. He fled while still possessing most of his combat power, and he refused to take the risk of falling into danger. Luo Bing and Luo Ning were unable to stop him in this state. If they tried, they might be the ones to die.

With Chu Kuang having fled, the Scarlet Spirit Flame had lost its target. It seemed that it could only cast its anger on Huo Long who was in Long Chen’s body.

“Bind!”

Long Chen smiled and extended a hand. The next moment, Huo Long flew out of Long Chen’s arm and wrapped around the Scarlet Spirit Flame.

“Get in!”

After Long Chen formed a hand seal, the Scarlet Spirit Flame and Huo Long vanished. With Huo Long’s help, the Scarlet Flame Spirit was drawn into the primal chaos space.

In the primal chaos space, it no longer possessed its precious berserk rage. Instead, it became docile, not even daring to move.

Long Chen smiled. As expected, the primal chaos bead was always the winner. Once something was sucked inside, he would be its master.

The Scarlet Spirit Flame didn’t move. Huo Long tightened its hold on it, and its runes slowly flowed into Huo Long’s body.

Long Chen clenched his fists. He hadn’t expected this endeavor to go so smoothly. He had obtained a Heavenly Flame. In other words, his alchemy was instantly upgraded, and he also had a new terrifying trump card.

“Long Chen, are you alright?!” Luo Bing and Luo Ning ran over urgently.

“I’m fine.” Long Chen shrugged and smiled. Of course, he was fine. Chu Kuang hadn’t even managed to graze his clothes.

“Thank you for saving us. We will definitely remember this favor,” said Luo Bing.

If Long Chen hadn’t come, the two of them would have definitely died. There was even the danger of being captured alive and humiliated. That would be a life worse than death.

“You’re too courteous. I’ve always found Chu Kuang to be dislikable. Since the enemy of my enemy is my friend, we can be friends in the future, the kind that won’t betray the other even in death.” Long Chen extended his hand.

Luo Ning and Luo Bing were members of his mother’s family. From their eyes, he felt like he could trust them.

Long Chen’s smile was very infectious, like a sunny youngster. It made them feel an urge to trust him automatically.

Luo Bing looked at Long Chen in surprise, not expecting Long Chen to trust them so easily. This was forming an alliance with them. When she thought of the intimate way he had held the two of them, she blushed slightly.

However, his gaze was clear with no impurities. They saw his open and candid nature.

Luo Bing expelled those distracting thoughts and grasped hands with Long Chen. His hand was strong and warm. Just as her heart trembled ever so slightly, Long Chen let go. This was merely a formality. When shaking hands with a woman, it was best to not hold on too long, or there would be suspicion of you taking advantage of the woman.

“There’s me as well!” Luo Ning also extended her hand, but contrary to Luo Bing, she shook his hand enthusiastically. “Good brother, if you need anything in the future, just ask.”

Long Chen laughed. How many women dared to call him good brother? It seemed that there hadn’t been more than a few even including the Martial Heaven Continent and the immortal world.

“Can you two wait a moment? There’s something I want below the lava. I’ll be right back.” Long Chen dived into the lava just like that as Luo Bing and Luo Ning cried out in shock.
