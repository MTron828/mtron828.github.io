Chapter 3895 Clash of Assassins

“What?!”

The eight Ji Wumings had just materialized before everyone’s eyes. However, before anyone could comprehend what was happening, one of his heads was already decapitated, leaving everyone stunned.

As one body and one head fell from the sky, space twisted and Dong Mingyu’s small figure slowly appeared.

At the same time, Ji Wuming’s lifeless body underwent a transformation. It swiftly became stiff, resembling a desiccated corpse. All signs of vitality had vanished, leaving behind a stark and lifeless figure

“The Eight Fate Soul Lasting Art is the most basic assassination art. But if you yourself are not strong enough, will ten thousand of you be worth anything? To waste so much energy on clones in pursuit of only staying alive, you have deviated from the path of assassination. Merely focusing on survival without inflicting harm upon your enemy won’t let you attain the Grand Dao,” said Dong Mingyu. Her dagger flowed and rippled like water, concealing its sharpness. Yet, an aura of sheer terror emanated from it, as if it possessed the capacity to sever a neck with a single swift stroke.

Ji Wuming had just summoned his clones and Dong Mingyu swiftly killed one, startling everyone. But to their astonishment, seven Ji Wuming materialized simultaneously from different directions, launching coordinated attacks on Dong Mingyu. It appeared to be a formation technique, rendering her defense futile. No matter how Dong Mingyu blocked, she would be struck by at least one of them. This technique seemed unbeatable.

However, seven of them simply passed through Dong Mingyu, stunning everyone. Her body was like water, their attacks unable to damage her.

“Not good!” Ji Wuming’s expression suddenly darkened. At this moment, a dagger silently appeared, cutting off one of his clones’ neck. Another clone was slain.

“Your foolishness is shocking. For me to say that it is the Eight Fate Soul Lasting Art proves that I understand it. The eight fates correspond to the eight gates: Body, Life, Pain, Limit, Vision, Death, Terror, and Opening. Since I have immediately killed your Life Gate clone, you won’t have any chance of winning. After that, you decided to foolishly abandon the Eight Fate Soul Chasing Art, switching to the Seven Star God Slaying Art. It is completely out of place. What do you mean, your own Eight Slaughter Clone Technique? You merely added something to the Eight Fate Soul Chasing Art. That counts as creating your own technique? You are just like your master, idiots who think themselves smart. In pursuit of the peak, you abandoned your foundation. In the end, you become foolish flowers that only admire themselves.” Dong Mingyu snorted and then vanished.

“Die!”

Enraged by the insult, Ji Wuming’s fury surged within him. With a roar, his six clones merged into one entity as he stabbed his dagger into the void.

BOOM!Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Dong Mingyu appeared once more. When the two daggers collided, a chilling wave of cold air rippled outward, causing anyone within its reach to experience a sharp pain within their souls. The frigid killing intent almost ripped their very souls out of their bodies.

At this moment, milky white mist flowed out of Ji Wuming’s manifestation, transforming into a pair of giant hands that were covered in spatial and temporal runes.

“Those two clones will not recover without at least three to five years of work, am I right? But I suppose it’s not a problem. You’ll die soon anyway, so there’s no need to consider such an issue.”

Dong Mingyu’s expression was still indifferent, akin to a death god who only cared about reaping lives. She seemed devoid of any emotions.

“Bullshit! I have countless trump cards up my sleeves, more than enough to kill a slut like you!” Ji Wuming roared furiously, his visage contorted with overwhelming rage.

Those clones were nourished with his blood and effort. While he had managed to recover the essence blood and soul essence of his slain clones, it would definitely take a few years of nourishment and effort before he could use them again.

Following Ji Wuming’s roar, his manifestation unleashed a blaze of divine radiance. As those two hands formed a hand seal, a surge of majestic energy came spurting out of his dagger, akin to a star exploding. The impact sent Dong Mingyu flying back.

“Die!”

Having lost his rationality and cool, Ji Wuming stepped into the void, hurtling toward Dong Mingyu like a luminous streak.

In an instant, he materialized behind Dong Mingyu like a phantom, driving his dagger with incomparable speed into her heart.

Blood spurted forth, but shockingly, it wasn’t Dong Mingyu’s. It was Ji Wuming’s blood that marked the tragic exchange.

The struck Dong Mingyu was nothing more than an illusion. In a startling turn of events, the true Dong Mingyu had materialized behind Ji Wuming like a specter, her dagger stabbing a deep cut into his shoulder.

Her expression was cold. After this attack, her dagger spun in her hand. She held it straight rather than backward, slicing it at Ji Wuming’s neck.

Ji Wuming had originally lost himself in his rage, but this one strike was like a bucket of cold water over his head, instantly clearing up his thoughts.

During the exchange, when he struck Dong Mingyu’s after-image, he immediately had a bad feeling and retreated, which allowed him to avoid being struck in the head. That was why her dagger struck his shoulder.

Dong Mingyu was just too fast, her techniques coming out in a never-ending stream. Even Ji Wuming’s spatial and temporal energy was unable to keep up with how quickly she switched techniques.

Dong Mingyu’s dagger then struck Ji Wuming’s neck a second time even as he retreated. This time, her dagger also failed to achieve its goal, only leaving a large cut that wasn’t fatal.

However, this sight still left people’s hearts pounding wildly. Both of them moved incredibly quickly, and such a rapid close-range fight could be decided in one move. The person who reacted the slightest bit slowly would be killed.

Whether it was the heavenly geniuses or the senior Divine Venerates, they had never seen such a clash of assassins before. Moreover, Dong Mingyu and Ji Wuming were peak-tier assassins. Their speed, moves, and movement arts were all terrifying.

“Hahaha!” Ji Wuming suddenly laughed. His fury and terror completely vanished, as if everything before this had not happened. He then rubbed the blood on his neck and muttered to himself, “As expected, there is always a heaven beyond the heavens. Thank you for teaching me this lesson today. My master was right, my greatest shortcoming was that I didn’t have a true opponent on my path of growth, resulting in me being too conceited. I needed a true grindstone to temper my sharpness, to grind away my fretfulness. Only then can I truly reach the next level. Now, my grindstone has finally appeared. After killing you, I will no longer be the old Ji Wuming.”

Ji Wuming was originally enraged after being repeatedly injured, but he instantly calmed down. This sight left countless people stunned, including old monsters that had lived for countless years. They asked themselves whether or not they could enter such a state so quickly, to control their own anger and fear swiftly. This youngster before them was truly terrifying.

“You are wrong. I am not your grindstone. You are simply my prey, or perhaps I should say that your head is a challenge letter to your master,” said Dong Mingyu indifferently.

“Oh? Is that so? Then you’ll be disappointed.”

Suddenly, the two hands in Ji Wuming’s manifestation repeatedly formed mystical hand seals. When they spread, a gate appeared between them.

Endless faith energy then poured out of it, causing the entire world to shake.
