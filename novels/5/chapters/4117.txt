Chapter 4106 Starry Radiance Moon Divine Pill

“Give this world to us?”

Hearing this, Long Chen and the others were shocked. Could Xu Changchuan really make such an offer?

“Brother Long, I won’t bother telling you any lies. In truth, these three worlds are the Silver Moon World’s barriers. Before, we only had the Silver Moon World, and the dark creatures directly attacked us there. Although we were strong enough to crush their attacks every time, we knew that it was very dangerous to stay that way. Thus, we paid a huge price to capture these three worlds. This way, the dark creatures need to pass through three gates before they can reach the Silver Moon World,” said Xu Changchuan.

“Then didn’t you just end up extending your defense line? Previously you only had to guard one world, but now you need to guard four,” pointed out Xia Chen.

“You are correct, but there was no other choice. If we were to receive the dark creatures directly, then if something unexpected occurs with the gate, the Fullmoon race would be in danger of being wiped out. By giving one world to brother Long, I’m actually borrowing your power to help block the dark creatures. However, don’t worry, the Fullmoon race will still provide help in guarding this world. We won’t let you fight alone,” said Xu Changchuan.

Now, Guo Ran and the others understood. It seemed that Xu Changchuan wasn’t a fool. By giving Long Chen a world, he was actually using Long Chen and the others as a shield.

Upon hearing this, Long Chen remained calm, as this was within his expectations. The Fullmoon race was guarding this life-forbidden area, an enormous region. Consequently, any collaboration with them would require a certain investment.

However, Long Chen shook his head in the end.

“What is it? Is it not good? But no matter what world you choose, it must be connected to ours. You have to pass through the Silver Moon World to extract the laws of the nine heavens, or you cannot activate a world,” said Xu Changchuan.

Long Chen waved his hand dismissively. “Don’t misunderstand. I don’t want this place because this place was won with the blood and lives of the seniors of the Fullmoon race. I, Long Chen, will not receive undeserved rewards. I don’t want such a world.”

“Are you saying that you…?” Xu Changchuan exclaimed in shock.

“My boss is saying that if we want our own world, we’ll make it ourselves,” said Guo Ran with a smile.

He knew Long Chen’s character. Long Chen didn’t like owing favors. As their relationship with the Fullmoon race was merely one of collaboration, Long Chen didn’t want to take advantage of them.

If it was just resources, then owing a bit for a while was nothing. They could always repay them later.

However, to take something that their ally had won through sacrificing lives? Long Chen would not accept such a thing no matter what. Otherwise, he would never feel at ease. Favors were truly complicated. Even when standing at the peak, when he was unafraid of anything, he was still afraid of these favors that he could not repay.

“That’s fine too. But if you want to claim your own world, it will be very difficult. Even if you did, it’s questionable whether or not you could guard it. Other than that, to activate one of these worlds, you will need the core of a star-field. Do you have one?” asked Xu Changchuan.

“The core of a star-field? No.” Long Chen was startled. A star-field’s core was extremely precious, as the only way to obtain one was to destroy a star-field. This kind of thing could not be bought with money.

“That’s alright. My Fullmoon race’s treasury still has one star-field core. If you need it, we can lend it to you.”

“Race leader!”

Startled cries rang out. At some point, the Fullmoon race’s leader had also come here.

Long Chen bowed slightly. “The core of a star-field is incredibly precious. If you lend it to me, I don’t know how I can repay you.”

“I heard from Changchuan that you can refine pills, right?” asked the race leader.

“That is correct.” Long Chen nodded.

“Have you heard of the Starry Radiance Moon Divine Pill?”VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

“Yes, I have. It is a pill containing the sacred nature of the stars and moon. However, I only know three formulas for it, and I don’t have a complete set of ingredients for any of them. The Starry Radiance Grass and the Moon Divine Sunflower in particular, these two main ingredients cannot be lacking. Without these two ingredients, I cannot refine it,” said Long Chen.

The eyes of the Fullmoon experts brightened when they heard that Long Chen could refine pills. Furthermore, when Long Chen said that he knew three pill formulas, the race leader’s heart shook.

“You really know three formulas?” he asked, unable to remain calm.

“I really only know three. These three types of Starry Radiance Moon Divine Pills have three uses: foundation building, spirit awakening, and blood igniting. That’s what I read in the High Firmament Academy’s ancient tomes. As these pills aren’t for the human race, I never bothered gathering the ingredients. If you can provide the ingredients, I’m willing to try it,” said Long Chen.

In truth, these pill formulas were from the Pill Sovereign’s memories. Long Chen didn’t want them to ask further, so he directly said that he saw this information in the academy.

“So it’s true. Long Chen, if you can refine these three types of pills, my Fullmoon race will be your fervent ally for a lifetime,” said the race leader.

Perhaps others might not understand why the race leader was so emotional, but that was because they didn’t know the secrets of the Fullmoon race.

As the race leader, he knew that the Starry Radiance Moon Divine Pill truly had three formulas, but two of those had been lost. Currently, the Fullmoon race only had the most basic foundation-building Starry Radiance Moon Divine Pills.

If Long Chen could refine the spirit-awakening and blood-igniting Starry Radiance Moon Divine Pills, then the entire Fullmoon race would soar like a shooting star.

Now, the race leader knew why the ancestral spirit totem would wake him from seclusion. It seemed that Long Chen was the hope of the Fullmoon race’s revival.

“I don’t dare to guarantee that I can succeed. But as long as you can provide the medicinal ingredients, I am willing to try it,” said Long Chen humbly.

“Alright. What medicinal ingredients do you need? Just ask,” said the race leader excitedly.

“For the foundation building Starry Radiance Moon Divine Pill, I’ll need the Starry Radiance Grass, Moon Divine Sunflower, Five Flavor Vine, Seven Star Root…”

Long Chen listed thousands of ingredients. However, the race leader was delighted when he heard it, as these were truly the ingredients for the Starry Radiance Moon Divine Pill. In other words, Long Chen wasn’t just bragging.

“... and it would be best if you could prepare some extras of those. The rest, I have myself,” said Long Chen.

“Alright. I’ll prepare them immediately!”

The race leader directly vanished and personally went to gather the medicinal ingredients. Seeing his reaction, Xu Changchuan and the rest of the Fullmoon race’s experts grew excited.

“Brother Long, you really are my Fullmoon race’s lucky star. You should know that Lord Brahma has made sure to lock down our supply of medicinal pills. Your arrival is perfect!” said Xu Changchuan emotionally.

Having lost their supply of medicinal pills, they had tried doing business with the Huayun Trading Company, but the latter’s medicinal pills were unable to satisfy their requirements. As a result, the Fullmoon race could only decline.

“Let’s go refine pills first before anything else,” said Long Chen, holding Yu Qingxuan’s hand. He knew that it was time for Yu Qingxuan to show off. He also had a certain thought.

“The enemy of my enemy is my friend. Perhaps we can have a deeper collaboration with the Fullmoon race. With the Fullmoon race at the center, it will be possible to gather more people opposing Lord Brahma. Hehe, even if I can’t beat you yet, I can still wipe my snot all over you.”
