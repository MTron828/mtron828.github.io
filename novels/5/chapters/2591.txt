Chapter 2580 Unleashed Fury

“Be serious. What kind of time is it for this nonsense? If you keep messing around, I won’t be giving a damn about your face,” said the old man darkly.

The Martial Heaven Continent was surrounded by enemies, and the Sovereign seals were breaking. Even the old man was under immense pressure.

The reason he had refused to pass on the ninth form of Split the Heavens all this time was because he had been waiting for the other half of the Heaven Splitting Divine Tablet to return. However, even after several years had passed, there wasn’t any news from it.

Considering the current situation, he had no choice but to use this incomplete space to teach everyone. If they were in possession of the full Heaven Splitting Divine Tablet, they wouldn’t need to go through all this effort. The Heaven Splitting Divine Tablet could directly display the perfect ninth form.

Furthermore, when the last generation’s sect master had taught the old man the ninth form of Split the Heavens, he had told the old man not to transmit the ninth form to multiple disciples unless he had no other choice. It was best to transmit it to only one person in every generation.

That was because the incomplete Heaven Splitting Divine Tablet meant that many parts of the ninth form were lost. Although generations of sect masters had filled in those holes, there were definitely some flaws compared to the perfect ninth form. That made cultivating it far too dangerous.

However, since the Heaven Splitting Divine Tablet had not returned, the old man couldn’t wait anymore. He could only teach them himself.

The second boss also tried using Heavens’ Wrath, but he wasn’t as steady as Boss Bao. The old man had him hold back five percent of his power, but he was also blown back and exhausted after unleashing his attack.

As for the Heaven Splitting Blade in the old man’s hand, it was closely related to the Heaven Splitting Divine Tablet, so the old man could control all the energy in this space. He was an undefeatable existence within this space, so he could face their attacks safely.

After the bosses finished, Long Chen realized that the Heavens’ Wrath was to make oneself furious in a kind of self-hypnotic way while still being aware.

If that was the case, Long Chen had a bit more confidence. As long as he wasn’t insulted by someone, he should be able to unleash his own anger.

Bao Buping was the last one to try, and he was sent tumbling back miserably. Chang Hao then helped him up. After that, everyone looked at Long Chen.

“Long Chen, it’s your turn. You are different from the others. I will suppress the Heavenly Dao energy using the Heaven Splitting Divine Tablet to its weakest state. You are unable to control your own rage, so just unleash it all. Perhaps the crux to controlling this state lies within this,” said the old man.

“But I’m worried about not controlling myself…” said Long Chen.

“Don’t worry, everything here is under my control.” The old man was prepared with the Heaven Splitting Blade.

“Alright… I’ll try it.” Long Chen nodded. He closed his eyes, and the world turned still around him.

“Don’t be afraid. Release it. Remember to maintain your mind as you unleash your rage. Use your will to control it,” said the old man.

Long Chen’s aura suddenly changed, becoming berserk. Astral winds unfurled around him, just like when Bao Buping and the others had tried the Heavens’ Wrath state.

“Not bad. Keep going, bit by bit,” encouraged the old man.

Astral winds raged like wind blades whirling around the void. As Long Chen’s fury soared, his aura grew colder.

“Excellent, you’ve reached the initial threshold. Now it’s the critical moment. Summon your manifestation and connect to the Heavenly Daos. Stay steady!” shouted the old man.

When Long Chen’s divine ring appeared, heaven and earth shuddered. A vast pressure crashed down on the world.

“Yes, just like this, slowly infect the Heavenly Daos.” Seeing Long Chen was still in control, the old man felt slightly better. It seemed that Long Chen’s control wasn’t as bad as he had thought. If this continued, he would succeed.

Suddenly, Long Chen’s eyes flew open. When the old man saw those eyes, his hair stood on end. It was like a furious devil had set its gaze on him.

“Control-”

Before the old man could finish speaking, Long Chen’s divine ring grew explosively. A wild qi wave blew Bao Buping and the others back, and the endless Daos were suppressed.

“Long Chen, control yourself!” roared the old man. But Long Chen couldn’t hear him.

Long Chen’s divine ring spun rapidly, tearing at the void. Boss Bao and the others jumped in shock.

“The Heaven Splitting Divine Tablet’s space is going to break!” The old man’s expression changed. As Long Chen’s aura grew, the Heaven Splitting Divine Tablet was no longer able to maintain control over this place. The aura of the Martial Heaven Continent began to flow inside through the cracks in space. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

The old man then switched out the Heaven Splitting Blade with his wooden cane. He struck Long Chen’s abdomen with the staff, wanting to break him out of the Heavens’ Wrath state.

However, the tip of his cane shattered, and the old man was blown back by a violent power.

“What is going on? Where is all this energy coming from?!” The old man was shocked. This space was not the Martial Heaven Continent. The Heavenly Dao energy here was suppressed, so where was this power coming from?

Suddenly, Long Chen roared. He had lost consciousness, and countless scenes were appearing in his mind. He saw scene after scene of when he was bullied in his childhood.

His fury grew explosively along with his divine ring. With Long Chen at the center, the void was constantly exploding, looking like it might shatter into a million pieces at any moment.

At this time, the old man’s words were still present in Long Chen’s mind, so he tried to maintain his mind. However, scenes flashed through his mind rapidly. Wilde being stabbed with needles all over his body, Lu Fang-er dying to protect Meng Qi, Ye Zhiqiu lying in his embrace with a final poignant smile, Little Snow taking the curse and dying for him…

Every time those scenes appeared, Long Chen’s fury would soar out of control. His essence, qi, and spirit were no longer under his command.

Flames and lightning burst out of Long Chen’s body, and his aura grew more and more berserk. Boss Bao and the others could barely breathe under this pressure.

“Old man, you have to interrupt him! He’s going crazy!” shouted Boss Bao.

Long Chen’s eyes were scarlet. Endless resentment was pouring out of his heart.

The old man stared closely at Long Chen. “What is this child hiding inside of his heart? How does he have so much resentment?”

Taking a deep breath, the old man stepped forward with the Heaven Splitting Blade. He couldn’t allow Long Chen to continue. Once Long Chen activated the Six Star Battle Armor, he would probably instantly ignite his entire being, burning up his very existence.

“Don’t do anything. He has a great deal of potential, so let him release it. Simply holding in all this resentment isn’t good for someone. This can be considered a kind of release.” Suddenly, Evilmoon’s dark voice rang out. It appeared on Long Chen’s back, blocking the old man.

The old man’s expression changed. “How am I supposed to know whether or not you’re trying to harm him?!” The old man did not fully trust Evilmoon.

“Tch, if it weren’t for Long Chen, I wouldn’t even bother speaking to you. Do you know that I’m someone who exchanged blows with the first generation Sovereign, Yun Shang? Why would I bother lying to people like you? In any case, Long Chen’s fury has started to unfurl. You can’t stop him. If you tried, he would instinctively activate the Six Star Battle Armor. At that time, this space will explode, and you will all be sent to the outside world. There, Long Chen will absorb the energy of the Heavenly Daos and grow even more terrifying. Unless someone on the level of Daoist Heavenly Feather appears, no one will be able to stop him,” said Evilmoon arrogantly and disdainfully. Clearly, to it, not everyone was worthy of being spoken to pleasantly.

“Old man, didn’t you say that everything was under your control?!” Boss Bao and the others’ expressions changed. If something happened to Long Chen, how would they explain themselves to the rest of the Martial Heaven Continent’s people?

Before the old man could reply, Evilmoon indifferently said, “Your prediction was correct. If he was just absorbing Heavenly Dao energy, Long Chen’s power would be under your control. However, Long Chen’s power is not what you think. Heavenly Dao energy? Haha, have you ever seen the Heavenly Daos care for him? Even if Long Chen does manage to learn the ninth form of Split the Heavens, it will definitely be different from yours. Don’t worry, with my presence, everything will be fine. I know him better than you.”

Flames and lightning continued to explode out of Long Chen. They formed chains, tearing at the void. Ear-piercing sounds and sparks exploded.

“Damn, what kind of power is this?!” Boss Bao felt like his entire body was creaking under this pressure. It felt like he would explode under it.

Comparatively, Bao Buping and Chang Hao were slightly better off. Perhaps it was because of their youth or because they were Empyreans. In any case, the seven bosses were barely able to endure, but they had nowhere to hide. The entire space was shuddering.

Long Chen’s fury continued to climb. It felt like his power would grow limitlessly. If this continued, the space really would explode.

The terrifying thing about the Heavens’ Wrath state was that it could unleash all of a person’s power in an instant. This was the technique that allowed the Heaven Splitting Battle Sect to become the world’s strongest sect in the past.

“He still hasn’t reached his limit?” demanded the old man. He couldn’t help being worried for Long Chen.

“No,” said Evilmoon indifferently.

After an incense stick’s worth of time, Bao Buping and the others were pressed to the ground and unable to move. Their heads were murky, and they almost fell unconscious.

Just at this moment, a terrifying pressure soared, making the old man’s expression change. Six stars appeared in Long Chen’s divine ring. He was summoning the Six Star Battle Armor.

However, all of a sudden, a pill furnace appeared and struck Long Chen in the back of his head. The world returned to calm, and Long Chen fell limply to the ground.
