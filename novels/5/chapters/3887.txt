Chapter 3876 Unrivaled Xia Chen

Thirty-six talismans detonated at once, summoning lightning runes that instantly blasted apart any nearby experts before they could even react.

If Long Chen saw this scene, he would definitely be shocked. These lightning talismans actually contained the terrifying might of heavenly punishment.

Furthermore, it was the power of heavenly punishment compressed to the pinnacle and then detonated. That destructive power was shocking. The only one he knew capable of such a thing was Lei Linger.

“Xia Chen!”

Guo Ran was delighted to see Xia Chen appear. At this moment, Xia Chen also had divine radiance behind his head, a Heavenly Dao Crown. He had also succeeded in condensing one.

After condensing a Heavenly Dao Crown, Xia Chen seemed to have merged with heaven and earth. His aura had completely changed, and he seemed to be the one in control of all laws. One wave of his hand could destroy heaven and earth.

Suddenly, the space behind Xia Chen quivered and an assassin appeared. This person was from the Bloodkill Hall, and he had slipped past just like Ji Wuming without alerting any of them. This person’s position in the Bloodkill Hall was definitely not low.

Just as Guo Ran was about to shout a warning, Xia Chen simply swung his hand back without even looking. There was a web-like design on his palm.

When that design lit up, a giant net hundreds of meters wide appeared, hanging in the air.

Seeing this scene, that assassin instantly had a bad feeling. He stamped on the air and shot back. His switch of direction was quick as lightning. To be able to come to a sudden stop like that showed that he was an expert. The only one capable of such a thing was an expert amongst experts.

Regretfully, even that was useless. The net already stuck to him, and he was like a fly caught in a spider’s web.

“Split.”

The design on Xia Chen’s palm suddenly separated along with the net in the air. However, it brought away that person’s limbs and head as well.Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

That expert assassin was torn to pieces. After his corpse was pulled apart, the pieces exploded, transforming into blood mist. He was killed in body and spirit.

“What?!” Guo Ran was dumbfounded. He knew Xia Chen the best and was familiar with his techniques. Xia Chen was now capable of condensing talismans barehanded!

Having escaped the bindings of paper and writing, Xia Chen had condensed this talisman using only his essence, qi, and spirit. This was the dream of any Talisman Master. Unexpectedly, Xia Chen had reached this level today. With his bare hands, he could control the power of heaven and earth.

“Merge with heaven and earth, condense talismans empty-handed. I’ve actually reached this realm. No wonder it is said that only after condensing a Heavenly Dao Crown are you truly a King amongst Immortals.” Xia Chen looked at his own hand excitedly.

Xia Chen’s arrival scared off the people who were throwing themselves at the dragon scale. This was their first time seeing such a terrifying Talisman Master. Xia Chen had destroyed heaven and earth with a wave of his hand, killing people without even touching them. With just two moves, he scared them off.

“Hahaha, congratulations Xia Chen! I was the first in the Dragonblood Legion, but you were second,” laughed Guo Ran.

Although Guo Ran was saying congratulations, he was also bragging. He was the first one in the Dragonblood Legion to condense a Heavenly Dao Crown, and the next fastest took three more days. He would be able to brag about that for a lifetime.

Xia Chen naturally knew that Guo Ran was showing off and simply smiled. Right now, he was fully immersed in the laws of heaven and earth, getting control over this marvelous feeling.

Just then, countless experts shot toward the dragon scale once more. Although Xia Chen’s arrival had scared them, some of them had already had a taste and were willing to give it another try.

Previously, they had taken turns to distract Guo Ran, and now tens of thousands of experts charged at once, wanting to use their collective force to crush the two of them. They knew that they had to join forces in order to get the benefits.

“Hmph, trying to use numbers against a Talisman Master? Truly foolish. Let me see how many of you can survive.”

Xia Chen sneered and formed hand seals. This time, forty-eight talismans flew out. When those talismans appeared, heaven and earth rumbled explosively. It was like forty-eight claps of thunder, so loud that people’s ears bled.

“Damn!” Guo Ran jumped in shock. He recognized those talismans to be Xia Chen’s most precious Heaven Shaking Talismans. “Hold some back! Don’t-!”

BOOM!

The forty-eight talismans caused explosive sounds in the world just by flying. The moment they arrived around the dragon scale, Xia Chen detonated them.

As a result, forty-eight Heaven Shaking Talismans exploded at the same time. That sound shook the entire three thousand worlds. Forty-eight ripples also appeared, devouring the surrounding space. Chaotic spatial currents then blew apart those experts, and even the dragon scale was swallowed by the spatial current.

Originally, Guo Ran was shouting for him to hold back and not end up affecting Long Chen. But Guo Ran’s words stopped in his throat midway. He couldn’t hear anything.

Seeing Long Chen and the dragon scale vanish within that chaotic space, his soul almost fled in terror. He actually thought that Xia Chen had just killed Long Chen.

However, when space settled, the dragon scale was still standing as solidly as a boulder. It wasn’t at all affected by the Heaven Shaking Talismans. Only then did Guo Ran sigh with relief, but he was already covered in a cold sweat.

“Who else wants to die? Just come.”

Xia Chen clasped his hands behind him. His Heavenly Dao Crown shone as he looked at those distant lifeforms, his voice backed with a murderous aura that made their hearts shake.

That attack terrified even Guo Ran, let alone these other experts. All the others who were thinking about touching the golden dragon scale instantly left, preparing to go somewhere else.

“Brother, that attack of yours almost made me piss myself!” praised Guo Ran.

“I benefited from boss. My spirit was strong enough before, but my essence and qi weren’t. As a result, I was unable to resist the backlash of the Heavenly Daos. I could only scatter my power in my talismans and avoided drawing in the power of heaven and earth, so I wasn’t injured by the backlash. Now, my essence, qi, and spirit are finally in equilibrium. I also have the Heavenly Dao Crown. Because of it, my talismans are now supported by ten times the Heavenly Dao energy. Furthermore, the backlash is easily endurable. Hehe, I’ve finally vented a bit.” Xia Chen laughed delightedly.

The current Xia Chen seemed to have completely transformed. He was a different person compared to before. He had finally stepped into the realm that he had longed to reach.

“Xia Chen, do you feel like something is off?”

Suddenly, Guo Ran’s expression became a bit grave. He looked into the distance vigilantly.
