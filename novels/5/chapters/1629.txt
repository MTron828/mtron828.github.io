Chapter 1624 Mind Block and Sand Blockage

Translator: BornToBe

“It’s Wang Hai!”

This person was also an Empyrean. He was a bit weaker than Wang Shan, as he had yet to begin awakening his manifestation.

Wang Hai was the paternal half-brother of Wang Shan and was five years younger than him. He had been drawn over by the immense disturbance. In fact, countless other people had been drawn over, including several Empyreans.

“Are those two brothers going to attack Long Chen together? That’ll be dangerous for him.”

“It’s unlikely. Just now, the Elder already said that anyone who causes trouble will be kicked out of the Jade Lake Pageant. Since they can’t fight with martial power, it’s changed into a battle of words. They want to discuss the Dao with Long Chen. Hehe, it’s like two masters playing chess. If Long Chen receives their challenge, we’ll all benefit immensely,” said someone hopefully.

Wang Shan was famous in the Southern Xuan Region, and they had long since learned of his power. However, when it came to Long Chen, all they had were stories from another region. They hadn’t confirmed anything for themselves about him. They wanted to see who was stronger. They wanted to see if Long Chen’s rumors were just bragging or if he had the power to back them up.

“If you want me to share my understanding of the Dao, that’s no problem. Even giving you pointers is no problem,” said Long Chen lightly as he looked at Wang Hai.

An uproar exploded. Long Chen actually said he would give pointers to Wang Hai, an Empyrean at the fourth Heavenstage of Soul Transformation. On the other hand, Long Chen’s aura showed that he had yet to reach the first Heavenstage. He had barely stabilized himself in his current realm.

“Give me pointers? Haha, that’s the first time I’ve heard someone say such a thing to me. Good, then please go ahead, tell me what areas do I need to improve?” laughed Wang Hai.

Although it sounded like a simple question, it was filled with thorns. If Long Chen said one point that was wrong or that Wang Hai could question, he would immediately use it to counterattack and make Long Chen out to be a fool.

“Then let me look.”

Long Chen slowly walked over to Wang Hai, looking up and down him. People held their breath as they waited in anticipation.

“Hmph.” Wang Hai just stood there, staring coldly at Long Chen. His gaze was disdainful. As long as Long Chen opened his mouth, he would immediately prove him wrong.

Both Wang Hai and Wang Shan were not only top experts but had also studied ancient scriptures. Both of them were known for their achievements in that regard, as well as their eloquence. That was why people had rushed over upon hearing that one of them was discussing the Dao.

Before, Long Chen had managed to act so arrogant, but Wang Shan hadn’t had a chance to counterattack. Now Wang Hai was using a different method to challenge him.

Since Long Chen had shamelessly said that he would give Wang Hai pointers, there was no way out for Long Chen now. Furthermore, Long Chen had said it so confidently that his opponent had already prepared countless ways to counterattack. He was just waiting for Long Chen to open his mouth.

Long Chen examined Wang Hai solemnly. At the very least, his appearance was a bit intimidating. No one dared to make a sound. They were all waiting for his evaluation.

As a supreme expert, Long Chen was naturally able to determine a person’s elemental attribute and fighting style based on their appearance, eyes, aura, and spiritual fluctuations.

However, Wang Hai was also an expert, and he had hidden any obvious clues. In fact, he had intentionally created some fake clues to mislead anyone trying to judge him.

After a long while, Long Chen sighed, “I didn’t expect you to have so many fatal flaws.”

Startled cries rang out from the crowd. Long Chen said that Wang Hai had flaws, and even fatal flaws at that?

“Hahaha, then please give me advice.” Wang Hai smiled. He was very pleased. He knew Long Chen was an outsider and couldn’t tell anything about him. He could already see the sight of Long Chen shamefully leaving with his head down.

Wang Hai and Wang Shan looked coldly at Long Chen, with everyone else looking at him in anticipation.

“Based on your expression, you are unconvinced. If I tell you, don’t get angry,” said Long Chen.

“What a joke. I, Wang Hai, am not such a petty person. As long as you can describe any weaknesses I have, and as long as they are correct, I won't mind pouring tea for you as an apology,” said Wang Hai coldly.

“Alright, then I’ll tell you. These are golden words of wisdom, so listen well. Don’t miss a single word. Your nose is crooked, your eyes are twisted, you’re short, your arms are so hairy it looks like you have dogs running across them. It’s fated that you’ll never be able to find a female partner. These are all your fatal weaknesses. Why are you trembling?” Long Chen spoke very solemnly, in the end looking at Wang Hai in confusion.

There were immediately quite a few women who couldn’t help but chuckle. Long Chen’s serious expression and Wang Hai’s fuming expression were lethal.

Those people who chuckled immediately felt uneasy and shut their mouths. However, it was too late.

Wang Hai was ashen with rage. Neither Wang Shan nor Wang Hai was very tall. That was related to their father. In truth, their father was a dwarf, and their generation had already greatly improved upon the previous generation’s height. However, they still didn’t reach average height.

Furthermore, their looks also weren’t that good. They had too much hair, which was also inherited from their father. There was nothing they could do about those things.

One reason that they liked to expound on the Dao was because they could be high and aloof at that time, looking down on everyone else, finally feeling superior.

“Long Chen, are you asking to die?!” Wang Hai and Wang Shan shouted together.

“I’ve heard such a thing so many times from the Eastern Wasteland to the Central Plains that I’m tired of it. What, it’s only natural when you humiliate others, but when others humiliate you, they’re looking to die? In my eyes, your conduct is simply foolish. You grew such a large head, but the only thing inside is rotten tofu. I’ve killed so many people like you, and I really can’t understand you folks. Is the feeling of trampling over others so great? Is trampling over other people’s dignity the only way for you to feel good about yourselves? I’ll just tell you that if you keep playing like this, sooner or later you’ll end up losing your lives over it.” After saying that, Long Chen turned to leave.

“Stop right there! Do you think you can leave right after insulting me?!” shouted Wang Hai.

Long Chen helplessly turned back. “Fine, I suppose that the fatal weaknesses I just told you aren’t things you can change. Then I’ll talk about things that you can fix. First, let’s discuss your Spiritual Strength. Your soul value should be between 147,000 to 147,500 points, correct?”

Wang Hai and Wang Shan’s expressions completely changed. Wang Hai was especially shocked. He had just tested his Spiritual Strength and gotten 147,000. Long Chen was actually right.

The only way to get such an accurate judgment was to do a spiritual test. Although there were stories of people with sharp spiritual senses who could give a general judgment for someone, there was no way that they could be so accurate.

Seeing those two brothers’ shock, everyone’s hearts pounded. Long Chen was actually right. How had he done that?

Wang Hai’s soul value was something only he and Wang Shan had known. The two of them had done the test privately before coming to the Skywood Divine Palace. There was definitely not a third person who should know it.

“Then let me ask you, when you tested your Spiritual Strength, did you feel a chilly pain on your Baihui acupuncture point at the top of your head? Does that spot always give away a needle-like pain when you circulate your Spiritual Strength with your full power?” probed Long Chen.

“How... how did you know that?!” Wang Hai’s shock intensified. This was a secret only he knew. Not even Wang Shan knew of this.

Long Chen laughed inside. He naturally knew. This was all told to him by Evilmoon who possessed the ability to rifle through a target’s memories. As long as that person’s Spiritual Strength wasn’t very powerful, it could silently dredge up that person’s secrets. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Long Chen also knew that neither of them was a good person, especially Wang Hai. His appearance had caused his heart to twist. He had assaulted hundreds of innocent women and even killed them in the most ruthless and humiliating way possible. That was why Long Chen didn’t hesitate to tear away at his scars. He didn’t feel any guilt at all.

“This is called a conduction block of the spiritual type. In my professional field, it’s called a mind block.” Long Chen continued, “Next, let’s talk about your physical body. You are an earth attribute expert, but your earth energy isn’t pure enough. There’s also sand energy mixed into it. Normally, having this kind of special mutation is a good thing, allowing your earth energy to become more flexible. However, because you rushed your cultivation, even using forbidden medicines to increase your cultivation speed, you spoiled things. Each time you use your earth energy, you feel like sand is flowing through your meridians, causing them to spasm and giving you sharp pain. In truth, this kind of symptom is known as meridian-invading sand energy bone-pain, called a sand blockage in short form. If I’m correct, I suppose you rarely fight with others now because you will always feel enough pain to die before even starting the fight.”

“What nonsense! There is no such thing! If you have the guts, then let’s fight three hundred rounds right now!” roared Wang Hai. His face was so twisted that it caused others to jump.

Long Chen smiled contemptuously. Perhaps this was retribution for all his evil deeds. Each time he put on a sanctimonious act and discussed the Dao, he was concealing this pain torturing him.

The truth was that Wang Hai’s talent was greatly inferior to Wang Shan’s. In order to not be thrown behind, he had secretly consumed forbidden medicines to forcibly increase his cultivation speed. Now, he had to deal with the consequences. Each time he used a magical art, the pain would wrack his body, and yet he still had to act indifferent and arrogant. The despair and pain he was filling weren’t something a normal person could imagine.

Everyone looked at Wang Hai’s terrifying appearance and seemed to understand something. They felt that Long Chen was even more unfathomable than before. He was even more terrifying than the legends.

“You don’t have to lie. I have a way to cure your mind block and sand blockage. Do you want to try it?” Long Chen smiled warmly.

“Really?” Wang Hai immediately stopped roaring. He looked at Long Chen with disbelief.

“Of course. I, Long Chen, often help others cure their illness. I have the cure right here. Come, stand here. Yes, now bend forward slightly and stick out your neck. Stick out your face a bit. Good, don’t move.”

Long Chen taught Wang Hai a very strange posture. Looking over him to confirm there were no mistakes, he swung his hand in an arc and slapped Wang Hai in the face.

In front of everyone’s shocked gazes, Wang Hai was sent flying like a shooting star.
