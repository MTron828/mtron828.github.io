Chapter 3235 Snatching the King Item

A King item was the divine weapon of a World King. Only World Kings that were also craftsmen were qualified to create one, and their power could truly destroy heaven and earth.

The Luo family and the Chu family had been fighting for so many years. However, the former had never once heard that the Chu family had a King item. How did such a terrifying pill furnace appear here?

Luo Changwu and Luo Changwen’s hearts sank. A treasure on this level could only be stopped by Luo Zichuan’s Violet Fern. But Luo Zichuan had brought Violet Fern away.

Even the scabbard of Violet Fern wasn’t able to unleash its full power without Luo Zichuan personally using it.

The thing that they felt most helpless about was that there was no retreat for them at this moment. They could only fight.

Now, they felt regret. They shouldn’t have only done this probing blow. They should have gathered the full force of the Luo family for this attack. But it was too late to regret anything now.

If they retreated now, what would they use to stop the Chu family’s Devil Kings? They couldn’t stop now.

The pill furnace was shining with divine light, and standing atop the pill furnace was an elder. That elder was the Chu family’s current family head, Chu Yingxiong.

The current Chu Yingxiong had summoned his manifestation. Within that light, a vague figure could be seen.

It was Fallen Daynight. Long Chen instantly recognized it. Adding on the pill furnace, it was clear that this fellow was a follower of Fallen Daynight’s.

Fallen Daynight and Lord Brahma truly were two birds of the same flock. Even their followers were shared. Long Chen shook his head, and his bloodied hand instantly recovered.

“Call over Luo Zichuan!” Chu Yingxiong’s gaze was as sharp as an eagle as he looked around.

“Crushing a little Chu family doesn’t require the family head to do anything. The few of us are more than enough to destroy your Chu family.” Long Chen had lost his saber, but his gaze was not at all subdued. He didn't panic.

Actually, the truth was that he was almost drooling as he stared at the pill furnace. He was like a hungry wolf eyeing meat. A King item pill furnace? Just how badass would it be to use that to refine pills?

“Hand over the pill furnace and I’ll leave you with an intact corpse.” Long Chen clasped his hands behind his back and shouted.

Hearing this, Luo Changwu and the others almost fainted. What was this child saying? Right now, they had to hurry up and decide whether they were to keep fighting or flee. Time was incredibly precious.

This battle was led by Long Chen, so they didn’t know what strategy he had. They simply stared at him. The rest of the Chu family’s experts also came to a pause.

Only Qin Feng continued to lead the rest of the Luo family’s experts against the Chu family’s experts. But here, everyone was simply clenching their weapons tightly, ready to keep fighting at any moment.

“What a huge joke. If Luo Zichuan doesn’t come up, you’ll all be annihilated. Let’s see if he shows himself or not,” sneered Chu Yingxiong.

He formed hand seals, and the divine statue behind him instantly grew clear. That figure within the light was clearly Fallen Daynight. When his figure appeared, the pill furnace rumbled and shot toward Long Chen.

Luo Changwu, Luo Changwen, and the others all knew how terrifying King items were. They prepared to join forces against Chu Yingxiong when Long Chen laughed.

“What kind of wolf are you trying to be? As your altars were destroyed and your Chu family’s people were slain, you simply cowered, praying to your god. You only dared to come out once the god’s radiance was bestowed upon you. Do you think that you’re unrivaled with Fallen Daynight’s protection? Who told you that this pill furnace was used like this?”

Long Chen formed hand seals behind his back, and a lotus mark appeared on his palms.

Long Chen then shoved his hands forward. As a result, two flame lotuses bloomed, and flame chains shot out, binding the pill furnace.

“A mantis trying to stop a chariot! You don’t know your own power.” Chu Yingxiong sneered disdainfully.

Just as the pill furnace was about to smash into Long Chen, the space behind Long Chen twisted, forming a giant black hole.

“Get in here!”

As Long Chen opened the primal chaos space, the flame chains dragged the pill furnace into it.

Just as the primal chaos space was opened, that mighty pill furnace went from a tiger to a rabbit. It cowered, and it didn’t even dare to resist.

The black hole then sucked in the pill furnace. Chu Yingxiong was shocked. When half the pill furnace entered the black hole, he sensed that he was losing connection to the pill furnace.

“Get back here!”

Chu Yingxiong instantly panicked. This pill furnace was the priceless treasure that Fallen Daynight had given the Chu family.

However, to truly obtain this reward, they had to do something worthy of it, and that would be killing Long Chen. Right now, Chu Yingxiong was only borrowing it.

If the pill furnace was lost and Long Chen wasn’t slain, then the Chu family would have committed a grave sin against their god. The Chu family might be mercilessly erased.

In order to obtain this treasure, the Chu family had meticulously arranged this trap, using the devil sea to entrap Long Chen and the Luo family. This should have been a surefire method, but unexpectedly, Long Chen had appeared here right at the critical moment.

Long Chen’s sudden appearance was out of nowhere. Afraid that Luo Zichuan was hiding, Chu Yingxiong hadn’t dared to directly charge out. Instead, he had prayed to Fallen Daynight, gathering the faith energy inside his divine statue for himself.

The Chu family’s experts were fighting so crazily because they knew that if they failed this time, the Chu family would be doomed. Hence, they had no choice but to throw their lives away.

Chu Yingxiong turned green with fear. If Long Chen took the pill furnace, then how would he fight Luo Zichuan?

Chu Yingxiong then roared, his divine energy raging. The might of an Immortal King was fully unleashed. As a result, countless cracks appeared in the air, as if the world would shatter.

Chu Yingxiong grabbed one ear of the pill furnace, pulling it back with all his might. But Long Chen was activating the power of the primal chaos space, sucking it in.

Since half the pill furnace had been sucked in, its powerful suction was even stronger now. Chu Yingxiong unleashed his full power and essentially entered a tug-of-war with the primal chaos space.

However, no matter how great his power or if he was supported by divine energy, even if he now had the power of an Immortal King, he was still unable to pull it out. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

“Damn thing, can you resist?!” Long Chen pulled as hard as he could. However, he felt the pill furnace slowly being pulled out. He was unable to beat Chu Yingxiong.

If only the pill furnace would fight. Then that would provoke the primal chaos space, and it would definitely put the furnace in its place.

However, it was like a frightened rabbit, not daring to resist or even run. Long Chen began to worry. If this continued, he wouldn’t be able to beat Chu Yingxiong.

“Good chance! Attack together!”

After Luo Changwen sent orders to the top experts, all of them bit down on a medicinal pill hidden in their mouths. As a result, their Blood Qi erupted, and violet qi soared into the heavens. Their Blood Qi power instantly multiplied several times, and they charged at Chu Yingxiong.
