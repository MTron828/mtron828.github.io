Chapter 4679 Detonation of a Saint Weapon

Seeing that the nine star heir wasn’t targeting them, other experts hastily got out of his way.

Now, Fallen Daynight’s disciple and Yu Zihao were left alone to face him, and the others just stared in shock at the two of them, not knowing how they had gotten such a terrifying existence to target them.

Seeing the fear in their eyes, everyone realized that this nine star heir wasn’t after other people. The two of them stumbled back, their foreheads shiny with sweat. Yu Zihao now looked very shaken, devoid of the arrogance he had taunted the Sovereign clan expert with.

“No, he’s not after them!”

At first, the nine star heir was heading straight toward the two of them. However, as the two of them stumbled back, everyone saw that his path deviated away from them, and they instantly realized the truth.

“He’s heading toward Long Chen!”

They finally understood that this person had always been after Long Chen from the start. This person was just like the Sovereign clan expert.

Luo Changsheng’s expression changed. At the same time as he was filled with shock, he was also raging with jealousy. He wondered about Long Chen’s true origins. Why did heavenly tribulation completely change because of him?

This kind of heavenly tribulation was unlike anything the likes of Luo Changsheng and the others had ever seen. They had never even heard of it.

Every single person here was a peak heavenly genius. Destined to be the central figures of this world, they were meant to shine brightly throughout their lives.

However, on this day, they were nothing more than bystanders. Long Chen’s light was so intense that it covered them completely. Like fireflies attempting to compete with the brilliance of the moon, they appeared utterly ordinary, a sensation that pricked at their egos.

“Wait, look at Long Chen!” Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

At this moment, someone’s gaze finally shifted from the nine star heir to Long Chen, and he saw the Sovereign clan expert standing behind Long Chen, with a hand against Long Chen’s back. Sensing the Sovereign clan expert’s falling aura, everyone knew what he was doing.

“Bastard, how can you just give your energy to Long Chen?!”

One of them roared with fury and immediately flew around the nine star heir, his sword slashing toward Long Chen.

While this person was enraged, he was extremely cautious. His Sword Qi went around the nine star heir, and after attacking, he immediately fell back.

BOOM!

The Sword Qi shattered upon impact with Long Chen’s palm. This kind of attack was unable to pose any threat to him.

However, the others quickly noticed that the nine star heir didn’t react at all when someone attacked Long Chen. This confirmed their suspicions that the nine star heir was not aligned with Long Chen.

As a result, a torrent of Sword Qi, saber-images, and other attacks rained down on Long Chen.

“Trash only knows how to launch sneak attacks. You don’t even have the courage to fight me directly, and you think you’re fit to be called geniuses? What exactly are you geniuses at? Mediocrity?” sneered Long Chen.

He then raised his hand, revealing a dragon rune that quickly formed into a blood-colored shield. This was one of the techniques he had learned from the Sovereign clan expert during their fight.

Although Long Chen had only comprehended the foundation of this technique, by relying on his powerful Blood Qi, as well as the fact that these people only dared to launch long-distance attacks, he could block all their attacks.

After all, Long Chen only needed to buy some time for the Sovereign clan expert’s energy to enter him. Time was the most precious thing to him at this moment. Each second he stalled would increase his power, as well as his chances of victory.

At this time, the nine star heir was getting close. With no one blocking him as he walked toward Long Chen, he suddenly stamped on the air, and a seven star diagram lit up behind him. He then swung his halberd at Long Chen.

The nine star heir attacked without saying a word, launching a sudden ferocious attack. The immense power behind this attack caused the halberd to bend.

Seeing this scene, Long Chen didn’t dare to hold back. Unlike the Sovereign clan expert, this nine-star heir was nothing more than a soulless creation of the Heavenly Daos, driven solely by the will to eradicate Long Chen at all costs.

The lightning blade materialized in Long Chen’s hands again, and without delay, he unleashed five slashes simultaneously.

BOOM!

Long Chen’s lightning blade exploded upon collision. If he were to fight the original master of this halberd, he would have easily blocked the halberd. However, in the nine star heir’s hands, the halberd had become significantly stronger, all thanks to the crazy amount of astral energy channeled into it.

While the nine star heir wasn’t a Saint, he could properly activate this Saint weapon’s power with his astral energy, and it was even stronger than the Sovereign clan expert’s spear.

Having shattered Long Chen’s lightning spear, the halberd continued to thrust at Long Chen’s head like a piece of broken bamboo. Long Chen seemed to have expected this and caught the other tip of the halberd with his hands.

Thankfully, the halberd had lost most of its power after crushing the lightning blade. Long Chen’s star-covered hands could firmly catch it.

Just then, Long Chen’s own astral energy poured into the halberd, and it blazed with light.

Originally, only four stars appeared on the halberd. However, now a fifth star emerged, followed swiftly by a sixth.

The halberd quivered in Long Chen and the nine star heir’s hands, its aura erupting like a volcano spewing lava. Its violent Saint pressure reverberated through the hearts of all present.

Under the influence of their power, the Saint weapon was shaking crazily. The experts around felt like they could hear the item-spirit’s howling in pain, as if it was trying to escape from them.

“This is the best time to attack!” Luo Changsheng shouted and was the first to charge out.

Following his lead, the others also launched their attacks. However, some of them were rather devious, and after launching an attack, they hastily fell back.

Just then, the seventh star appeared on the halberd, causing it to look like it contained seven blazing suns. It finally couldn’t endure any longer.

BOOM!

The Saint weapon exploded, releasing a wave of light that devoured heaven and earth.
