Chapter 1312 Once More Seeing the Slap

Translator: BornToBe

For Zhuo Tianxiang to be able to call out that elder’s name, the two were clearly familiar with each other. But that tone of his was not the one used when greeting an old friend.

“Hehe, what could I possibly be intending? As the shopkeeper of the Eastern Xuan Region, I work myself to death every day. I simply finally had some time to go out for a stroll and relax, when I suddenly noticed that this place was very lively, so I came to take a look!” Yue Qingshan laughed, still as magnanimous as ever, as if he would never get angry in his life.

Within the Huayun Sect, there were many different posts. But because they were so devout to their Wealth God, even their appellations were business titles. It wasn’t quite the same style as the rest of the cultivation world.

Pill Valley’s people would often curse the Huayun Sect for being nothing more than a group or loathsome peddlers, beggars who only cared about profit.

But the Huayun sect never cursed back at Pill Valley, nor would they do anything aggressive. That kind of self-restraint was admirable.

Despite both parties controlling the lifeblood of the cultivation world, the Huayun sect was always lowkey, and was never overbearing like Pill Valley.

But if people thought that the Huayun Sect was easy to bully because of that, they would have made a huge mistake. The Huayun Sect’s power was something no one knew. But considering that even Pill Valley was always helpless to do anything to them, there were still some clues.

“You don’t need to be so nervous. My Huayun Sect believes that amiability makes a person rich. But I heard that Pill Valley has been very unbridled with this matter. My Huayun Sect has always been lowkey, and so I was thinking of learning a few pointers from you.” Yue Qingshan smiled.

The Righteous experts’ hearts’ shook. Yue Qingshan’s words might seem courteous on the surface, but they contained a hidden sharpness.

What exactly did he mean by the Huayun Sect had always been lowkey, but now wanted to learn a few pointers from Pill Valley? Was that to say that they were about to start attacking Pill Valley? This was a warning to all of them.

“Hmph, my Pill Valley has the power and foundation to be arrogant. Not just anyone can learn this ability,” sneered Zhuo Tianxiang. He was clearly cursing the Huayun Sect for being a bunch of country bumpkins, that their foundation was a far cry from Pill Valley’s.

“You can’t put it like that. No matter what, you should always try things out at least once before giving up. Otherwise, you’ll start doubting your own abilities. So trying something out isn’t a bad thing,” laughed Yue Qingshan.

“By supporting the Xuantian Dao Sect, are you prepared to go against my Pill Valley, the ancient races, and the entire Righteous path?” demanded Zhuo Tianxiang.

“Oh, how worthy of PIll Valley. This arrogance was truly something worthy of me coming to learn. To be able to make me the enemy of the world with just a sentence, amazing, truly amazing!” Yue Qianshang raised his thumb at Zhuo Tianxiang. But everyone could tell he was mocking him.

“My Huayun Sect is a business, so we naturally wouldn’t dare to offend so many people. Otherwise, we might starve to death. All I came to do was to learn your techniques. You can act however you want to act, and we’ll just watch without saying anything!” laughed Yue Qingshan.

“So, youngster Long Chen, can you help find me a seat and some refreshments? I’m an old man, and your Xuantian Dao Sect’s staircase is too long. I’m so tired, I almost collapsed halfway.” Yue Qingshan turned to Long Chen. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

Long Chen was delighted. Yue Qingshan had already expressed his attitude clearly. He had come to help Long Chen suppress these people, and at least one of his main goals was to go against Pill Valley.

By sitting on his side, anyone who wasn’t blind or an idiot could tell the Huayun Sect’s attitude.

“Old friend Qingshan, I invited you multiple times to come but you refused to visit. It seems Long Chen’s face is even greater than mine as the Xuantian Dao Sect’s sect master.” Li Tianxuan bitterly smiled.

It had to be known that Yue Qingshan was in charge of the Huayun Sect within the Eastern Xuan Region. His word was law in this region. In truth, Li Tianxuan only knew of him and hadn’t had any past relationship with him.

In the past, the Xuantian Dao Sect’s business was also handled by others in the Huayun Sect. A declined sect like the Xuantian Dao Sect wasn’t qualified to disturb a figure on his level.

One reason for Li Tianxuan’s bitter smile was to raise Long Chen’s status, while the other was to express his helplessness.

“Xuan Master Li, please forgive this old man. My body is old. Thanks to the blessing of the Wealth God, my own wealth has been growing to the point that just going out for a stroll is too much of a waste! I can’t bear to lose that profit.” Yue Qingshan patted his own plump belly with a laugh.

At this time, Long Chen offered his own seat to Yue Qingshan, but Yue Qingshan refused. He sat down to the side, not wanting to overwhelm the voice of the host.

Long Chen’s position was the sect master’s position. Even Li Tianxuan and the others were standing behind him, so he was the leading role.

Yue Qingshan naturally saw that Li Tianxuan was supporting Long Chen. Clearly, Li Tianxuan had pushed Long Chen into the position of the future Xuan Master. Long Chen’s status and position would never be the same again.

He was no longer just a talented disciple. Li Tianxuan’s actions today were equivalent to telling the world that Long Chen was the successor of the Xuantian Dao Sect, and anyone who dared to touch him would have to face the entire Xuantian Dao Sect’s rage.

“Good job, Long Chen. Your brother supports you.” Zheng Wenlong, who was behind Yue Qingshan, winked at him.

Long Chen nodded, remembering this favor. Zheng Wenlong had truly helped him out this time. With the Huayun Sect supporting him, the pressure on him lessened a great deal.

The arrival of the Huayun Sect’s experts threw Pill Valley’s original scheme into chaos. Even the Martial Heaven Alliance’s people didn’t know what to do.

Yue Qingshan was simply sitting by Long Chen’s side. Those people doing their best to spout dogshit for Pill Valley all shut their mouths, not daring to speak.

“In truth, all of us have only come to the Xuantian Dao Sect for the sake of justice. Since we’ve all come, it’s time for us to discuss what happened. If there are any misunderstandings, we can resolve them right now. With so many distinguished figures of the martial path, we can definitely find a way to carry out justice for everyone.”

At this time, the Martial Heaven Alliance’s Deng Cang thickened his face and started the conversation. After all, the Xuantian Dao Sect was a member of the Martial Heaven Alliance, and they had to stand up for them. However, his words were no longer as harsh as before. At the very least, he didn’t start off by calling the Xuantian Dao Sect the villains.

But his words were still implying that the Xuantian Dao Sect was the one at fault, or he wouldn’t say that their goal was to find justice for all parties.

Long Chen smiled coldly. He could tell that this Deng Cang was no good. He was fundamentally not speaking up for the Xuantian Dao Sect. He was definitely working for someone else.

Although Long Chen didn’t know why Deng Cang would be acting like this, Long Chen was confident that if he allowed Deng Cang to continue taking the lead, the situation would turn more and more unfavorable for the Xuantian Dao Sect.

“That’s right, with old man Yue here, I trust that many people will need to give an explanation to my Xuantian Dao Sect,” agreed Long Chen. But his agreement was clearly different from Deng Cang’s intent. His meaning was the opposite.

“Bastard, your Xuantian Dao Sect killed so many people, and we’re the ones supposed to give you an explanation?! Li Tianxuan intentionally used a divine item to kill so many Life Star experts from Pill Valley and the ancient races. He was even more vicious than the Corrupt path! But you still have the face to demand an explanation? For you to be so shameless, are you not afraid of embarrassing your ancestors? For my Heaven Suppressing Magic Sect to be lumped in the same name as your Xuantian Dao Sect is our greatest humiliation,” cursed an elder at Long Chen and Li Tianxuan.

This elder was the sect leader of the Heaven Suppressing Magic Sect, Qi Yunao. In terms of seniority, he was even a level higher than Li Tianxuan.

“That’s right, the Xuantian Dao Sect definitely did it intentionally. This is the sign you want to cause chaos for the rest of the land. Today, the Xuantian Dao Sect must give the Righteous path an explanation.”

“Due to the seniors from the Huayun Sect coming, we won’t ask for too much. As long as the Xuantian Dao Sect is immediately disbanded and Long Chen is executed, this matter can be resolved.”

Immediately after Qi Yunao, other experts from the Righteous path began to roar with righteous indignation.

They were all once sects that had had relationships with the Xuantian Dao Sect. Although they were intimidated by the Huayun Sect, they were more worried about the Xuantian Dao Sect managing to escape this crisis unscathed. If the Xuantian Dao Sect really rose, it would be a nightmare for them.

That was why with Qi Yunao being the first, they also stood out to make the choice between the Huayun Sect and Pill Valley. Since they were already enemies of the Xuantian Dao Sect, they had to choose to stand by Pill Valley.

Long Chen stood and began slowly walking toward Qi Yunao. The roars gradually calmed down as everyone stared at him.

“Hmph, you want to argue with me? Today, no matter how you try to twist it, your lies won’t have the slightest use. A wrong is a wrong, and forcibly twisting logic is meaningless,” sneered Qi Yunao.

Pow!

But what shocked everyone was that Long Chen didn’t say anything. He had no intent of quibbling. He directly extended a hand and slapped Qi Yunao’s face.

“You shameless old thing, I came to slap you. Who would waste words with someone like you?”

Everyone was filled with disbelief. Long Chen’s slap had flowed naturally without the slightest flaws. According to reason, as soon as he attacked, an expert would instinctively react.

But it was only after Long Chen’s slap had struck Qi Yunao’s face that everyone reacted. It was like time had frozen until his slap landed. Just having witnessed it made them feel like there were boundless mysteries behind it.

“A natural Dao! To be able to refine a face-slap to such a level, he can be rated as unrivaled beneath the heavens!” Even Yue Qingshan was surprised and he shot up, staring with shock. This was his first time seeing Long Chen’s divine face-slapping art.

As for Qi Yunao, he was slapped into the distance. One of the Life Star experts had to catch him.

The Heaven Suppressing Magic Sect’s cultivators had weak bodies, and Qi Yunao was no exception. Long Chen’s slap had shattered half his face. Blood was pouring out.

Everyone was deathly silent. That slapping sound still hung in the air. Many of them were simply dumbfounded. Not all of them were able to tell just how profound that slap had been. They were unable to figure out why Qi Yunao hadn’t dodged.

“Die!”

Qi Yunao’s face twisted, and with a furious roar, a golden runic hand appeared and slammed toward Long Chen.
