A half-step Eternal expert had just appeared but was forcibly ripped apart by a pair of large hands, causing devil blood to spray out.

All this blood instantly transformed into runes, with not a single drop touching the ground.

BOOM!

The half-step Eternal expert was ripped apart, but his Yuan Spirit managed to escape. Feeling frustrated, he then let out a furious roar, but it was cut off midway when a black claw crushed his Yuan Spirit.

From within those spinning runes, a large man like an iron pagoda appeared.

“Palace master!” Long Chen cried out. The palace master had slain a half-step Eternal expert in an instant, his eyes full of excitement.

“It should be no problem for me to fight now, right?” The palace master looked at his own hands and muttered to himself. He then shouted, “Those who dare to touch my academy’s disciples will die!”

With a roar, a heavy dragon cry exploded like a tsunami washing over people, exuding a thick aura and raging Blood Qi.

What shocked Long Chen was that the palace master was actually a terrifying half-step Eternal expert.

“Long Chen, leave! The palace master isn’t that reliable. Once he goes crazy, he won’t look after others,” transmitted Bai Zhantang hurriedly. After all, he understood the palace master far too well. Thus, he was worried that Long Chen would misunderstand the palace master, thinking that the latter would be following and protecting them. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

With that reminder, Long Chen continued barging his way through his enemies with the devil saber.

“The Barbarian Dragon race has actually become the human race’s pet! What right do you have to be arrogant? I’ll deal with you myself!”

A giant Kunpeng then appeared, its vast wings stretching across the sky, and as it did, stars came into view beyond its majestic wings. This Kunpeng was a manifestation brought forth by the current leader of the Kunpeng race, and he was also on the cusp of achieving Eternal status, being a half-step away from it.

BOOM!

The next moment, the Kunpeng race’s leader unleashed a claw at the palace master, sending an enormous claw-image his way.

Seeing this, the palace master responded with a disdainful snort and unleashed his claw as well. The clash between these two colossal forces caused the very void to explode.

As the void contorted, the earth beneath them crumbled, and a terrifying vortex appeared in the air. It resembled a devil’s maw that would devour the world.

“The Sage King Prefecture is sinking!”

A terrified cry rang out, and as the land was constantly subsiding, countless rune fragments scattered into the air. The very laws of heaven and earth had descended into chaos.

Long Chen and the others had originally been flying through the air, but as the laws were thrown into chaos, they lost their ability to fly through space.

“Run!”

Other than half-step Eternals, no one could fly, so they had no choice but to run with their legs.

Even Long Chen was unable to fly with his Kunpeng wings, thus, he could only lead everyone in a wild rush. On the other hand, Mo Nian’s speed didn’t change. Those worn-out boots of his were very strange as they actually weren’t affected.

“Long Chen, how much energy do you have left?” Mo Nian came to Long Chen’s side and spoke to him spiritually.

“Less than thirty percent.” Long Chen didn’t know what Mo Nian was planning to do with this question, but he answered him honestly.

“Damn, that little? That’s no good. The most important thing for a man is endurance,” said Mo Nian.

Long Chen almost stumbled to the ground. Even at this time, this fellow was still in the mood to joke.

“Then what about you?” Long Chen couldn’t help asking.

“Ninety-five percent,” said Mo Nian proudly.

“Don’t brag. Are we even brothers?”

“Why would I lie to you? Don’t misunderstand. I wasn’t able to kill Yan Wuji, but he was also powerless to do anything to me. In terms of endurance, I could beat three of him. Do you not see that he has vanished? He has less than fifty percent of energy left, so he got afraid,” said Mo Nian with immense satisfaction.

“You’re that badass?”

“Hehe, I thought that you would at least have fifty percent of energy left. Why don’t you take a break and let me take the lead? You should conserve your energy,” said Mo Nian with a smile.

Long Chen nodded. That final clash with Long Aotian had been the final wish of the Minghong Saber, so Long Chen hadn’t held back. As a result, that one blow had used up forty percent of his energy stores.

In truth, in that final blow, Long Chen didn’t need to use that much energy. After all, the Minghong Saber was already falling apart by then, so most of his energy was wasted because it couldn’t be channeled properly. However, Long Chen didn’t regret it. He willingly bid farewell to his battle comrade with his greatest power, ensuring that there were no lingering regrets on either side.

To conserve his energy, Long Chen deactivated the Seven Star Battle Armor, leaving only the Dragon King Battle Armor active. This adjustment caused his aura to instantly plummet.

All of a sudden, Long Chen’s heart jolted, prompting him to scan the surrounding areas. His expression remained unchanged, but now a chilly light appeared deep in his eyes.

“Long Chen’s out of power! Kill him!”

When Long Chen put away the Seven Star Battle Armor, many of his enemies felt his aura plummet and announced it loudly. After all, other heavenly geniuses like Lian Wuying, Ye Wuchen, and Zhao Xingtian were still pursuing him.

However, while they were in hot pursuit, they refrained from attacking and were quietly recovering their energy, instead having others exhaust Long Chen and the others. Thus, seeing Long Chen put away the Seven Star Battle Armor, they felt like their chance had come.

“Torrential Tempest Cloud Piercing Arrow!”

Mo Nian stamped on the void, and his boots lit up. Unaffected by this chaotic space, he appeared in the air and drew his bow with precision.

The next moment, a hail of arrows shot out. They were as fine and dense as the hairs on a bull but tore through the air like lightning.

Lian Wuying and the others were shocked to find that every arrow possessed a terrifying death qi. It was so terrifying that Lian Wuying’s leaves rapidly rotted upon being struck by one of them.

The experts around them directly let out hair-raising screams. However, they didn’t manage to struggle for more than an instant before they turned into rotting corpses.

“Corpse poison?”

Long Chen was shocked. Mo Nian often spent time in ancient tombs and had to deal with this kind of corpse poison regularly. Long Chen had even helped him dispel that poison from himself with thunderforce.

Corpse poison was a constant problem for Mo Nian. In his ventures as a graverobber, he often encountered terrifying kinds of corpse poison. Once infected by this poison, removing it was very difficult.

However, Mo Nian had managed to turn this corpse poison into a divine ability, adding it to his arrows. He could now remove the poison from him and get a terrifying killer move in return.

BOOM!

Just as Mo Nian was showing off his divine abilities, a heaven-shaking explosion came from the distance. When Long Chen looked over, his eyes widened in shock.
