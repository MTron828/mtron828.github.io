Chapter 4625: Can‚Äôt Expose

Tch, you fool, your status as a nine star disciple cannot see the light of day, scolded the Earth Cauldron.

What? Long Chen cocked his head.

Youve just squeezed past the entry gate of the Nine Star Hegemon Body Art. Do you think that your current power is enough to beat Lord Brahma? asked the Earth Cauldron.

"Even if I can't defeat him now, what is there to fear?" declared Long Chen with determination. "I'm still young, with boundless potential. Just because I can't overcome him at this moment doesn't mean I won't be able to in the future."

After all, Lord Brahma had lived for countless years, while Long Chen was still in the process of growing and evolving. Moreover, following this battle, he felt his comprehension of astral energy deepen even further, instilling him with unwavering confidence.

Fool, the moment you are exposed, Lord Brahma will very likely kill you personally. He wont give you a chance to live up to that potential of yours, said the Earth Cauldron gravely.

Personally kill me? He wouldnt do that, right? Long Chen jumped in shock.

Just what kind of existence was Lord Brahma? Why would someone called a venerate amongst gods personally hunt him down?

Lord Brahma will not allow any nine star heirs to exist. While you might have destroyed the Nine Underworld Hall and the Star Peering Heavenly Mirror, remember that the Nine Underworld Hall is just one of his seven subordinate powers tasked with hunting down nine-star heirs. The Star Peering Heavenly Mirror also possesses seven faces, and you've only shattered one. Your thinking has been too simplistic.

Therefore, you must conceal your status as a nine-star heir. The Starry River of the Sky Art now serves as your best disguise. Without it, you likely would have been eradicated long ago. Your manifestation of the starry river is entirely unique among nine-star heirs, particularly your divine ring. It's this distinctiveness that prevents others from suspecting your true identity. So refrain from recklessly revealing your status, warned the Earth Cauldron sternly.

Alright, Ill listen to you, senior. Long Chen nodded, retracting his arrogant words just now.

You can be arrogant and domineering now, but remember, do not expose your status as a nine star heir, reprimanded the Earth Cauldron again.

Long Chen nodded. He understood, but he was actually enraged to think that nine star heirs would have to live in secret. However, there was nothing he could do about it. He might be able to beat Lord Brahmas disciples, but if Lord Brahma personally came, his survival chance would directly drop to zero. So, he could only endure for now.

Nevertheless, Long Chen had made an oath to himself. If Lord Brahma was going to make him live this way, then he would make Lord Brahmas disciples live in a similar way or face his wrath.

Didnt Lord Brahma still have three thousand more formal disciples? Killing a few would be a good way to vent some of Long Chens fury.

Long Chen, youre out of seclusion? asked Yu Qingxuan, rushing out upon hearing him.

I suppose I am. Long Chen smiled and held her hand. Looking at her smile, he found his anger vanishing.

Speaking of which, Qingxuan, how did you end up in the Fantasy Spirit World? Were you not in the Void Spirit World? Did you encounter the others? asked Long Chen.

Long Chen and Yu Qingxuan finally found a moment to talk with each other, so Long Chen directly seized the opportunity to ask his questions.

Yu Qingxuan explained that she had ventured into the Void Spirit World alongside everyone else. According to her, the entrance to the Void Spirit World was identical to that of the Fantasy Spirit World. Upon arrival, they encountered numerous ancient factions, each possessing immense power.

To vie for priority access to the Void Spirit World, these factions engaged in a frenzied battle at the entrance. The scene was chaotic, with rivers of blood flowing freely.

Seeing this scene, Guo Ran ordered the Dragonblood Legion, the disciples of the academy, Battle God Palace, and the Starry River Sect to stay still

Meanwhile, Xia Chen secretly set up a transportation formation. Due to arriving early and having plenty of time, Long Chen had set it up so that they would appear right in front of the gate.

When the gate opened, they all charged through the chaotic flow of space and appeared right at the entrance.

Their sudden appearance provoked the ire of countless experts, drawing the attention of powerful factions toward them. In response, Yue Zifeng unleashed a single stroke of his sword, transforming numerous experts into a rain of blood. The gate of the Void Spirit World was also affected, nearly crumbling under the force of Yue Zifengs attack.

This one attack made everyone stop. Seeing how terrifying Yue Zifeng was, no one else tried to get in their way. Yue Zifeng then led everyone into the passageway.

According to Yu Qingxuan, due to the disturbance of the chaotic flow of space, Xia Chens transportation formation had been slightly off, resulting in them being the third group to get in.

However, contrary to the Fantasy Spirit World, there was no old elder standing there after they had reached the entrance. They were simply transported away.

Yu Qingxuan had found herself transported to a heavenly screen, which descended just as she arrived. Without thinking about it, just before it fully fell, she walked through, completely unaware that this screen was actually the barrier between the Void Spirit World and the Fantasy Spirit World.

She then felt a powerful summons and traveled to the temple. Encountering numerous ferocious beasts surrounding it, she opted to sneak past rather than fight them.

After passing by countless terrifying existences on the way and almost noticed by some experts, she managed to safely arrive at the temple.

However, upon reaching the temple, she fell into a trap set by the medicine slaves of Lord Brahmas disciple. If Long Chen hadn't arrived then, she would have been in serious peril.

A powerful summons?

Long Chen was startled as he had only felt the summons of the Jewel Blood Jade Orchid. If the Earth Cauldron had not guided him to the temple, he wouldnt have reached it. Moreover, without the Jewel Blood Jade Orchid, he wouldnt have the key to open the temple. For this key to not fall into Yu Qingxuans hands but instead his own, he found it puzzling.

Did you not see the others?

This time, Long Chen was referring to Meng Qi, Chu Yao, Tang Wan-er, Dong Mingyu, and the others. When he asked, his eyes were full of anticipation.

However, Yu Qingxuan just shook her head. She knew what kind of answer Long Chen was looking for from her, but from the start, she had not found a trace of them.

As expected, Long Chen felt a wave of disappointment wash over him. After being separated from them for so long, he had dreamed of being reunited. However, reality proved to be harsh.

Im sorry Yu Qingxuan murmured, sensing his disappointment but unsure of how to comfort him.

Long Chen hastily scolded himself for making her feel guilty. How could he make her apologize for this? He remarked hastily, I have a feeling that theyre definitely here as well, but their path might have been different from ours.

You really think so? asked Yu Qingxuan.

Of course. Tell me, did you see Lord Brahmas disciple outside the gate back then? asked Long Chen.

Oh I dont think so.

The dragon domain is also connected to this world. As for Lord Brahmas disciple and medicine slaves, who knows where they came from? Theres definitely more than a few entrances, so well see them eventually! comforted Long Chen.

Long Chen added, Oh, I also need to ask for your help for something! Checkk new ùíèovel chùíÇpters at novùíÜlbin(.)com

Is there a need for such formality between us? Just tell me, said Yu Qingxuan with a smile.

Alright then, Fairy Qingxuan, please bestow upon me the Nirvana Scripture. If you did, this junior brother would be endlessly grateful, Long Chen said, bowing respectfully and eliciting a laugh from Yu Qingxuan.

Yu Qingxuan instructed Long Chen to concentrate, and with one hand, she formed a seal and pressed it onto Long Chen's forehead. Once again, the sound of the Nirvana Scripture echoed in his mind.
