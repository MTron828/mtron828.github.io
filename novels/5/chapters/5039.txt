Chapter 5028 Lingfeng Sword

Long Chen was still holding the golden scepter in his hand. Unfortunately, he was no longer the respected head umpire but a prisoner caught in a cage.

However, even in this cage, Long Chen wasn’t the slightest bit panicked. Ye Lingxiao and Zhao Qingtian slowly walked toward him, but his expression remained calm.

Ignoring them, he turned to the Long clan leader. Through the multiple barriers, he indifferently asked, “Are you sure you want to treat me like this?”

The Long clan leader didn’t quite dare to look at Long Chen, avoiding his gaze. For some reason, he kept feeling uneasy, as if something bad was about to happen to them.

Long Qianxue stood beside the Long clan leader, and her expression was extremely unsightly. Only now that she understood their clan leader’s intentions, and she was a bit incapable of accepting it. After all, Long Chen was also a disciple of the Long clan. To destroy him for the Earth Cauldron was too cruel.

However, despite knowing this was wrong, in front of the Long clan’s interests, she continued to stand by the Long clan. That was her duty; it had nothing to do with right or wrong.

“Long Chen, your sins are unforgivable, deserving a thousand deaths. The clan leader has been too lenient on you, indulging in your rebellious behavior. Not only have you broken the Long clan’s rules, but you have even reached the point that the four clan alliance can no longer tolerate your existence. After the four clan leaders met, they came to a unanimous decision to execute you, which shows just how vile you are. What right do you have to interrogate the clan leader?” sneered Long Qihua.

“Turning hostile so quickly? It seems like you’re prepared. Alright, since you want to play, let’s play!” Long Chen smiled frivolously and then started to stretch.

Long Chen knew this place had been locked down, and not even a fly could escape. Once this was over, they could easily seal memories or alter them as needed. Long Chen guessed that they had several contingencies arranged. However, perhaps they hadn’t expected him to fall for it so easily and directly enter the martial stage.

Ye Lingxiao and Zhao Qingtian snorted at Long Chen. Looking at each other, they said in unison, “How will we decide?”

“Draw sticks!”

Both of them were eager to personally kill Long Chen. Zhao Qingtian, in particular, harbored a deep-seated hatred toward Long Chen and adamantly refused to hand him over to Ye Lingxiao.

On the other hand, Ye Lingxiao shared the same determination. However, his motivation to eliminate Long Chen stemmed from envy, particularly over Long Tianrui.

Ignoring their animosity, Long Chen continued to stretch, cracking his bones audibly.

Qin Feng clenched his fists, his body trembling slightly. Long Ziwei and Gui Jiu looked on with concern, mistaking Qin Feng’s action for anxiety.

Qin Feng said, “You two are fortunate. Boss is getting serious, so a huge battle is about to start. Don’t even blink!”

At this moment, Ye Lingxiao and Zhao Qingtian finished drawing sticks. Unfortunately for Zhao Qingtian, his luck soured, and his expression instantly darkened.

“Ten moves! After ten moves, we’re switching!” grumbled Zhao Qingtian.

“No problem. But I feel like you won’t have that chance. He won’t last ten moves against me,” answered Ye Lingxiao as he smiled coldly.

After saying that, he started walking toward Long Chen. Long Chen had his back turned against them, casually stretching one knee up to his chest, then switching legs, seemingly oblivious to the approaching danger.

“Fool, face your death!” Ye Lingxiao sneered and suddenly vanished with a flash, reappearing right beside Long Chen.

An explosive sound reverberated. Before the onlookers could even register shock at Ye Lingxiao’s incredible speed, they witnessed him being sent flying like a shooting star.

“What?!” Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Countless onlookers jumped to their feet in astonishment. The sequence of events had gone too swiftly for them to comprehend.

BOOM!

Ye Lingxiao crashed into the barrier and bounced off, tumbling a few times on the ground before coming to a stop. As he stood up, a deep handprint was visible on his face.

Meanwhile, Long Chen remained nonchalant to the side, still stretching and warming up. It was like what had happened just now had nothing to do with him.

All the four clan leaders and the heaven vein experts were stunned. Long Chen’s movement had been so swift that they had only caught a vague glimpse of him swinging his hand. They didn’t even know how he had struck Ye Lingxiao.

An uproar erupted among the spectators. Most had only witnessed Ye Lingxiao vanish and then reappear on the barrier with a handprint on his face.

Due to the power difference, they hadn’t even seen Ye Lingxiao appear beside Long Chen. They were left bewildered. Looking around, they noticed others were equally perplexed. Some were puzzled by different aspects of the event, but their expressions mirrored the same astonishment.

Zhao Qingtian also jumped in surprise, but he quickly recovered and laughed at Ye Lingxiao.

“That’s one,” said Zhao Qingtian.

Ye Lingxiao was struck dumb by the slap and the burning pain on his face. It took him a long time to snap out of it. When he heard Zhao Qingtian counting, his killing intent erupted.

“You damn bastard, hand over your life!” shouted Ye Lingxiao.

The sound of a sword being unsheathed reverberated through the martial stage, sending shockwaves through the air. Divine light, akin to lightning, sliced through the air.

“The Lingfeng Sword!” Jiang Wuwang cried out in shock. It was the Ye clan’s invaluable treasure. Judging from the runes surrounding it, it seemed that they had lifted its seal.

All the four divine clans had legacy divine weapons. However, they wouldn’t let their disciples use them lightly. After all, these weapons contained the ancestral bloodline power and could be hazardous if mishandled.

Thus, even if they were to let a disciple use one of those legacy divine weapons, they would always place a seal on it just to be safe.

However, Ye Lingxiao’s Ye Lingfeng Sword had its seal undone, unleashing power that far exceeded all expectations.

As Ye Lingxiao launched his second attack, Long Chen completed his warm-up. He then turned around and swung the golden scepter toward the Lingfeng Sword.

BOOM!

Golden light exploded as the scepter instantly turned to dust, obliterated by a single blow from Ye Lingxiao’s sword.

Just as everyone thought that Long Chen would be injured or even die from this attack, they heard another clear and crisp sound. A figure was sent flying yet again.
