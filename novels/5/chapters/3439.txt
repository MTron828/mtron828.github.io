Chapter 3428 The Care of the Heavenly Daos

Multicolored lightning filled the world with color. But it was the color of death.

Countless experts who thought themselves powerful had died to the lightning swords, not being able to resist them.

The weak began to ask for aid from the strong, because these lightning swords were unable to pose a fatal threat to those experts. After that, these weaker people could absorb the broken lightning runes for themselves under the experts’ protection, allowing their realms to rapidly grow.

At the same time, countless weaker experts fled toward the outer edge. The lightning at the edge was not as wild as in the core, allowing even these weaker experts to absorb it.

However, what surprised countless people was that Lei Yuner had also fled to the outer edge. Furthermore, the Lightning Falcon race’s experts and their followers also came with her.Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

“Hehe, when danger comes, the birds fly from the nest. Wasn’t it said that the Lightning Falcon race was very prideful, very loyal?” Wu Ying sneered as she saw them leave.

Lei Yuner was enraged and had an urge to directly charge back and kill this woman who vexed her so much, but she managed to endure.

After her bloodline summons, the Lightning Falcon race’s hundreds of thousands of experts had fled to the outer edges, while everyone else was doing the opposite. The lightning at the core was stronger and more beneficial for them.

As a result, the core region was packed with millions and millions of demonic beasts, and they were surrounding Long Chen.

Lei Yuner hadn’t just brought the Lightning Falcon race away but also their subordinates and those with good relationships with them.

Some powerful experts amongst their midst were still hesitating though. They didn’t want to leave; they wanted to stay at the core.

“What time is it for you to be so blind?! Don’t get drawn into their battle!” shouted Lei Yuner at them.

The contempt on Wu Ying and the others’ faces grew when they heard that. They knew that Lei Yuner was afraid and didn’t want to participate in their battle.

Only then did those experts of the flying beast race leave the core. It was only after her shout that they realized that the experts at the core were led by the Mammoth Divine Elephant race. There was also the scaled beast race. Those people would definitely target them if a battle were to erupt.

After thinking through that, the flying beast race’s experts all retreated to Lei Yuner’s side.

“Princess, won’t master be in danger?” Ying Bokong came to Lei Yuner’s side, feeling worried.

“It was your master who told me to do this. Hurry up and gather your race’s people. Otherwise, if they die, don’t blame me for not informing you,” said Lei Yuner.

Ying Bokong shook his head. “They mocked and insulted me. If I go over, I would be asking for humiliation. Life and death are up to fate. They can’t blame others.”

When Long Chen was in trouble with his fee, Ying Bokong had asked the other members of his race and his past brothers to lend him money. However, he only received insults. Not only did they not lend him money, but they actually harmed him. Because of this, his heart was already cold toward them.

“Fine. It won’t be long. Keep getting further away. Your master said that the further we get, the better,” said Lei Yuner.

Lei Yuner continued to lead the flying beast race’s experts away. They watched from a distance as if they really were intent on not getting drawn into this chaotic battle.

“Hahaha!” Outside of the Divine Lord Immortal Realm, the Mammoth Divine Elephant race’s leader laughed. “I thought lifeforms with thunderforce were all direct and loyal. It seems that this isn’t the case, right?”

These words were clearly directed at the Lightning Falcon race. The Lightning Falcon race had a flawless reputation not only amongst the flying beast race but also the entire Integral Heaven Star-Field. The main reason for that was their loyalty. They always kept their word.

Lei Yuner was allied with Long Chen, but she simply left now. Hence, countless people sneered at the Lightning Falcon race’s leader. It wasn’t just those within the Divine Lord Immortal Realm that were targeting them. It was the same here.

“Hmph, are you blind? That fellow Long Chen wants to devour the karmic luck of the Heavenly Daos all by himself. He is shameless and contemptible. Yuner saw through who he is and doesn’t want our people to be drawn into it. How is that wrong? Do you think that my Lightning Falcon race is so easy to bully? Fuck, why don’t we just start a war right now and see if my Lightning Falcon race has a single person afraid of dying?!” raged the leader of the Lightning Falcon race. He had been pushed to the edge of his restraint.

However, the others didn’t dare to push him too far. They all knew that once this old fellow erupted, he really would start a slaughter without caring about the consequences.

It was always those who didn’t care about their lives that were the most dangerous. If these experts were to fight the Lightning Falcon race here, the Lightning Falcon race would definitely drag a few others down with them. So, even if they had numbers advantage, they didn’t dare to press them too hard.

“Everyone, calm your anger. Just watch. Due to absorbing too much of the karmic luck of the star-field’s core, Long Chen has caused a change in the heavenly tribulation. We are witnessing history here,” said the hall master. Only then did the others shut their mouths and continue watching.

The millions and millions of demonic beasts within the core were essentially the young elites of the Integral Heaven Star-Field. They were the future of the Integral Heaven Star-Field.

Now, these future emperors had completely sealed this space, and the only one caught inside was Long Chen. However, his gaze was indifferent, as if he didn’t even see these experts surrounding him.

His aura was like a sea, like a mountain, yet also like the starry sky of the cosmos. It was boundless. At this moment, he was sensing the changes in himself. He felt the energy of heaven and earth pouring into his body, strengthening his body, nourishing his soul, and cultivating his 108,000 stars.

This was his first time feeling the Heavenly Daos treating him so warmly. He knew that the core of the star-field was helping him.

His 108,000 stars were constantly breaking and being reborn stronger. As they got stronger, so did his physical body. However, that couldn’t be seen with the naked eye. Only he could sense his power crazily rising.

There was no pain. In fact, he didn’t feel anything off at all. This feeling of peace could make a person forget all their worries. Long Chen seemed to be able to see the internal world of the core of the star-field. He could sense her feelings.

Just then, the tribulation clouds in the sky rumbled, waking Long Chen up. Long Chen then looked up to see countless lightning lifeforms descending from the heavens, howling toward him.

“The tribulation has finally started.” Long Chen smiled. This time, he had ample confidence.
