Chapter 3661

The Nine Underworld Island was located in the southwestern area of the Violet Flame Heaven. It bordered the devil sea. Furthermore, there was a devil eye located within this devil sea that caused countless cultivators to quiver with fear.

Legend had it that there was a terrifying devil beneath the devil eye, one that made even Divine Venerates detour around it.

Long Chen had once been offered as a sacrifice by the Soaring Dragon Company to a devil eye. He had almost died. Unexpectedly, the thing to save him was the mark of the Ghost Sovereign on him.

Thus, even Long Chen felt apprehensive about the devil eye. The Nine Underworld Island wasn’t far from it, and yet they were still safe and sound.

Due to being so close to the devil eye and shrouded by mist, the Nine Underworld Island was a mysterious place. No one dared to approach it. It was the Nine Underworld Hall’s second-largest stronghold, and countless elite assassins were raised there. Those people were like cheetahs of the night. With them standing guard over every movement within that area, anyone who dared to get close never left.

After so long, the sea of mist around the Nine Underworld Island became a forbidden area that no one dared to set foot in. That only caused the Nine Underworld Island to become even more mysterious.

Also, the Nine Underworld Island was actually composed of over three thousand and six hundred islands. They all possessed different magnetic fields that repulsed and attracted each other, resulting in space being very chaotic there. It was difficult for outsiders to get accustomed to that space.

Adding on the mist and the special formations set up by the Nine Underworld Hall, this area was very bewildering. Outsiders would basically be crippled if they entered, their senses thrown into disarray. They would then simply be slaughtered.

This information was given by the Huayun Trading Company. But even the Huayun Trading Company only had this much information and had no details on the inside. That was enough to show just how mysterious the Nine Underworld Island was.

“Boss, why is the path so weird? Making all these turns is using up quite a bit of time.” Xia Chen couldn’t help speaking up as he controlled the flying boat through the path that Long Chen had drawn on the map.

“It’s just to bewilder our opponents. They already know where we are. Even if they can’t find our tracks, they can tell the direction we’re going based on our plundering activities. Our target is the Nine Underworld Island, but we can’t go there directly. We’ll loop around. In the other direction, there’s the ruins of one of the branches of the High Firmament Academy. I’m throwing them off, making them think that we’re going to the ruins to activate the foundation stone. They’ll then set up a trap for us there. That should increase our odds of success in sneaking into the Nine Underworld Island,” said Long Chen.

“You really think our odds aren’t good, boss? Xia Chen now possesses enough wealth to rival a nation, and I have a Supreme Bone, while you, boss, are an undefeatable battle god. With us three brothers joining forces and considering that we’re launching a quick sneak attack, is there really any chance of failure?” asked Guo Ran.

After the past few days of looting, Xia Chen had gathered many materials. Furthermore, they had bought any materials that he was missing while passing by the Huayun Trading Company. He currently possessed even more materials than the Spirit Rune Pavilion had possessed.

After all, the Heavenly Talisman Star-Field’s cultivators bought their materials from various major trading companies. Hence, looting the Soaring Dragon Company turned Xia Chen into a moneybags overnight.

After becoming a moneybags, Xia Chen added a few more runes to Guo Ran’s body; they would let him merge with the Supreme Bone’s power faster.

The two of them also researched how they should proceed with Guo Ran’s Devil Dragon Battle Armor. By inscribing new runes onto it, its defensive and offensive powers would increase greatly. Xia Chen was also testing how he could merge the power of the battle armor with the Supreme Bone. Once he succeeded, Guo Ran would truly be unrivaled.

That was why the current Guo Ran felt immense confidence. Although he wouldn’t dare to say that he could beat Long Chen right now, he did feel that at the very least, the distance between them was getting shorter. If all three of them were to join forces, well, to use his words, they could swagger wherever they wanted in this world.

Long Chen couldn’t be bothered to dampen his inflated ego. Whatever he said wouldn’t enter Guo Ran’s head anyway. Only when he encountered a truly terrifying existence would he understand just how shallow he was.

Long Chen sternly said, “Our mission this time is of utmost importance. We must succeed. If we fail, we’ll never get a second chance, so we cannot fail. Be wary of getting careless. Xia Chen, you have to prepare some extra life-saving measures. I have a premonition that this time, our success will depend on you.”

“Boss, don’t worry. Leave it to me,” promised Xia Chen.

Long Chen nodded. At least, Xia Chen was more reliable. When it came to an unreliable fellow like Guo Ran, Long Chen couldn’t even be bothered to explain things to him more than once.

However, Long Chen could understand where he was coming from. Guo Ran had a Supreme Bone, and Xia Che had powered up his battle armor. Now, he was already capable of using Long Chen’s third form of Split the Heavens with those new runes.

Other than the first form of Split the Heavens being researched by him, the second and third forms were gained without the slightest effort. The runes that Long Chen had worked so hard to come up with were simply taken by him. Long Chen even started to have a feeling like he existed just to work for this little fellow.

Although Guo Ran’s Split the Heavens didn’t have the will of Split the Heavens and it was lacking in mental power as well, he did have a Supreme Bone. With its power merged into Split the Heavens, it was truly shocking.

Xia Chen had also set up some more runes on Guo Ran’s saber to make sure that it could endure the force of his Supreme Bone. When it came to pure destructive power, Guo Ran was not inferior to Long Chen. Thus, it was normal for Guo Ran’s confidence to be so overinflated. If that didn’t happen, he wouldn’t be Guo Ran.

As for Xia Chen, he was different from Guo Ran. He was someone who had worked hard as a solo cultivator without any backing. Even from a young age, he was already steady and reliable. After what happened in the Spirit Rune Pavilion, his heart only grew steadier.

Although Xia Chen wasn’t showing off all of his trump cards like Guo Ran, just from his calm expression, Long Chen knew that his power was definitely not inferior to Guo Ran’s. It was simply that he didn’t like showing off.

Guo Ran had tried to make Xia Chen talk about his trump cards several times, but Xia Chen tactfully refused. Guo Ran called him petty, but Xia Chen only smiled and didn’t explain himself.

Long Chen couldn’t help sighing about it. As expected, mountains and rivers changed, but people didn’t. Even after suffering for over a year in the Heavenly Dragon Divine Armor College, Guo Ran’s sloppy nature hadn’t changed.

The flying boat continued to weave across the land. Xia Chen and Guo Ran continued plundering their targets, and Long Chen focused on refining and consuming pills.

As he continued to consume pills, a vast amount of medicinal energy was finally absorbed by the Violet Tower Star. It was already the size of a bean.

Suddenly, the Violet Tower Star quivered and its light illuminated the entire star sea. Long Chen smiled with gratification. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only
