Chapter 4810 High Firmament Divine Sword vs. Brahma Divine Diagram

The head of a Heaven Saint flew off his body within the High Firmament Academy’s temporary stronghold, resulting in its immediate death.

Even for a Heaven Saint, a strike from the High Firmament Divine Sword to a vital area was fatal. In the aftermath of this decisive blow, Bai Letian stared at those shocked Heaven Saints.

“It’s a trap! Retreat!” shouted one of them.

“Since you’ve come, you should stick around. Otherwise, others will say the High Firmament Academy doesn’t know how to treat their guests,” sneered Bai Letian.

After that, the High Firmament Divine Sword quivered, and a golden light radiated out of it, forming a birdcage barrier around them.

These Heaven Saints chose to run the moment they saw the High Firmament Divine Sword. However, when this barrier appeared, they were caught like birds in a cage.

“You goddamn bastard, you dare to injure my wife! I’ll tear you to pieces today!” Bai Zhantang roared. All of a sudden, his ghost qi exploded, and he shot toward one of those Heaven Saints.

“Zhantang!” His wives cried out in shock, not expecting him to charge head-on like a bull. After all, he had agreed he would just stand guard on the perimeter as he was still injured. However, he went crazy as soon as he spotted the one who injured his wife. Worried about him, the two of them immediately chased after him.

The four Protector Elders also joined in the fray. Taking advantage of the chaos and panic, they immediately started killing. Bai Letian in particular was unstoppable, using the High Firmament Divine Sword to slice through bodies and weapons.

In the hands of the dean, the High Firmament Divine Sword could summon such power that even the weapons of Heaven Saints were unable to block it.

BOOM!

Just then, the sword barrier conjured by Bai Letian exploded, and a divine diagram appeared above everyone’s head.

This divine diagram depicted mountains, plains, rivers, seas, birds in flight, beasts on land, and even the celestial bodies—the sun, moon, and stars. It really resembled an entire world. The ten thousand Daos rumbled as if an entire cosmos was pressing down on them. Instantly, the High Firmament Divine Sword’s domain was shattered.

“The Brahma Divine Diagram,” Bai Letian muttered, his expression darkening. Despite having suspected that the Brahma Divine Diagram was monitoring the High Firmament Divine Sword, Bai Letian still looked grim when he saw it.

Within the Brahma Divine Diagram, everything seemed real, as if it was a projection of the nine heavens and ten lands. The birds, beasts, and celestial bodies moved as if they represented the ten thousand Daos and laws of the world.

Suddenly, the Brahma Divine Diagram quivered, and a phoenix actually emerged from its depth, exuding ancient and desolate qi. No one knew which species it was, but its wings covered the sky as it dove at Bai Letian.

The heavens and earth quaked under the phoenix's overwhelming presence, which far surpassed that of an ordinary Heaven Saint. Most alarmingly, a peculiar energy enveloped every expert, binding them in its grip.

They heard a terrible phoenix cry as its golden claws reached for Bai Letian. In response, Bai Letian formed a sword seal. The High Firmament Divine Sword then trembled, and a layer of light spread out, enveloping Bai Zhantang and the others, as well as the academy’s disciples.

BOOM!

The divine phoenix collided with the barrier of the High Firmament Divine Sword, resulting in a cataclysmic explosion that tore through the fabric of sky and earth.

After unleashing a single devastating strike, the Brahma Divine Diagram vanished, and the trapped Heaven Saints instantly fled.

As the dust settled, the laws of heaven and earth remained in disarray. The void continued to distort, with dangerous whirlpools hanging in the air like gaping maws. Even Heaven Saints would be doomed if engulfed by these vortexes.

The clash between two peerless divine weapons wreaked havoc on the region's laws, rendering recovery impossible for thousands of years. The lingering whirlpools persisted as grim reminders of the devastation, transforming the area into a land of death.

“Damn Brahma Pill Valley,” cursed Bai Zhantang through gritted teeth. Despite having a bloody hole in his chest, he held the severed head of a Heaven Saint. As he watched their enemies vanish without a trace, his anger intensified.

“Idiot. If you pull a stunt like that again, I’ll end up dying too. I’m not helping you next time,” scolded a voice emanating from the swirling black mist behind Bai Zhantang.

The mist dissipated after the voice’s warning, along with the Ghost Dao aura on him. Bai Zhantang felt the world spinning around him before collapsing.

Bai Shishi’s mother caught him helplessly. Looking at Bai Letian, she apologized, “I’m sorry, Dean...”

“It’s fine. I wasn’t hoping for him to be of much help anyway. This fellow really doesn’t listen to anyone other than the palace master,” muttered Bai Letian, shaking his head helplessly. He knew his son too well.

The reason his expression was ugly right now wasn’t solely due to Bai Zhantang. It was the fact that the Brahma Pill Valley had deployed the Brahma Divine Diagram, effectively declaring war on the High Firmament Academy.

Although the Brahma Pill Valley had done certain things to target the academy and both sides were well aware of these things, for the Brahma Pill Valley to act so openly this time had a completely different meaning—this was a declaration of war, as well as the opening move. It showed that the Brahma Pill Valley would go all out against the academy from now on.

With this declaration of war, many preparations that Bai Letian had arranged before entering the Sovereign Emperor Heaven had become worthless. This was a heavy blow to him.

“Dean Long Chen, it looks like we will be depending on you.”

Bai Letian looked into the distance and let out a long sigh.

...

On Long Chen’s side, the devil lord came charging over with a furious roar, causing the figures of Bai Letian and the others behind him to be blasted apart.

“What?”

Bai Shishi and the others were startled, not knowing what was going on. Bai Letian and the others had seemed so real, even emitting genuine auras. Were they mere clones? They had no idea what Long Chen was thinking about. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

As Bai Letian's figure exploded, a scabbard appeared—it was the scabbard of the High Firmament Divine Sword. Long Chen swiftly grabbed it and stowed it away. Then, seeing the devil lord approaching, he charged forward with Evilmoon in hand.
