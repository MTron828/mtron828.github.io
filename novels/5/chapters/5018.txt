Chapter 5007 Crafty

Qin Feng’s reaction shocked countless people. They had not expected him to agree to it.

Meanwhile, Feng Fei wasn’t the slightest bit surprised as everything was within her expectations. She walked over to the seats of the Jiang clan’s disciples, where countless disciples immediately made space for her.

Clearly, Feng Fei’s status amongst the Jiang clan’s disciples was extremely high. It seemed that other than Jiang Wuwang, she held the highest rank. What set her apart was not just her status but also her remarkable charisma, which endeared her to both men and women alike. In the competitive world of the Jiang clan, she had almost no enemies.

“Hahaha, did you see? He accepted! He must be a half-step Heavenly Chosen as well. The Dragonblood Legion really is despicable!” shouted a Ye clan disciple.

“Shut your dog mouth!”

Before anyone else retorted, Feng Fei was the first to speak up in defense of Qin Feng.

“A frog at the bottom of the well cannot speak of the ocean. Can a summer fly speak of ice? Do you even know what the Dragonblood Legion is? Every single warrior in the Dragonblood Legion is a true warrior who has experienced countless untold dangers and difficulties as Long Chen led them from the mortal world into the immortal world. They’ve climbed mountains of corpses and crossed seas of blood. They fought against injustice and oppression to achieve their current height.

“Dragonblood warrior is not just a name, it is a symbol. It is a blend of arrogance and humility, a clash between dark and light, and a mix of slaughter and redemption. You greenhouse flowers aren’t qualified to judge them. If you have the guts, then come forward and fight. If you don’t, then shut your trap. Only cowards and fools yap like dogs.”

Everyone present was stunned by Feng Fei’s sharp rebuke. Why was Feng Fei being so protective of Qin Feng?

Even Qin Feng and Long Chen were stunned. It seemed that Feng Fei understood them better than they had thought. Her final line about them being a mix of slaughter and redemption was particularly deep. It was remarkably simple and concise, yet it touched Long Chen.

“What are you staring at me for? Are you moved to tears?” Feng Fei’s icy face broke into a smile as she saw Long Chen staring at her in astonishment.

“I say, you really are beautiful today!” praised Long Chen.

Feng Fei laughed. “Your flattery sounds a bit fake. After knowing you for so many years, it’s your first time praising me. Fine, even if I had to work for it, I’ll still take it.”

“Activate the martial stage!” shouted Zhao Qingyu from the Zhao clan’s camp. He was getting impatient.

Feng Fei and Long Chen’s flirtatious banter irritated Zhao Qingyu, and he didn’t want to hear Feng Fei bragging about the Dragonblood Legion. All he wanted to do was crush Qin Feng.

When the martial stage’s light rose, Qin Feng and Zhao Qingyu were brought inside. Seeing them on the martial stage, everyone tensed up.

Zhao Qingyu was a true expert, with power second only to a true Heavenly Chosen. People estimated that he would be able to get into the top three amongst the half-step Heavenly Chosen. Thinking of this, the mercenaries grew worried.

At this moment, Long Ziwei brought Gui Jiu to the Jiang clan’s camp. The Jiang clan’s disciples frowned when they saw these two guys as they didn’t welcome outsiders.

“Everyone, I would like to meet Fairy Feng Fei. We know each other,” said Long Ziwei hastily when he was blocked by the Jiang clan’s disciples. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

Feng Fei also saw Long Ziwei at this moment. Knowing that Long Ziwei was Long Chen’s little brother, she waved her hand, indicating for her people to let him through.

Long Ziwei and Gui Jiu then walked over to Feng Fei. Gui Jiu was nervous. After all, Feng Fei was a true Heavenly Chosen, a strong existence even amongst Heavenly Chosens. He couldn’t help but be nervous.

Even Long Ziwei was cautious. He had mustered his courage and relied on Long Chen’s reputation to get this close to Feng Fei.

“Sit. The seat’s free. We can watch together,” said Feng Fei. She was very magnanimous, directly waving for Long Ziwei to sit beside her. Delighted, Long Ziwei hastily thanked her.

“Fairy Feng Fei, I wanted to ask you a question. Who do you think will win this fight?” asked Long Ziwei cautiously.

With an odd expression, Feng Fei turned to look at him. “Why would you ask such a thing?”

“I... I just want to settle my heart... otherwise, I don’t think I’ll be able to concentrate on watching,” replied Long Ziwei.

Long Ziwei had heard about Zhao Qingyu a long time ago. The latter was incredibly powerful and brutal, rarely leaving his opponents alive. Even amongst the four divine clans, he was well known. Hence, Long Ziwei was worried that Qin Feng wouldn’t be a match for him.

If Feng Fei said that Qin Feng would be fine, Long Ziwei would relax and focus on observing every move of the fight. Without that assurance, he feared he wouldn't be able to concentrate.

Staring at him oddly, Feng Fei suddenly remarked, “Oh, it seems you don’t really know Long Chen.”

“Yes, you’re right, I’ve only been following Boss for a few days.” Long Ziwei nodded hurriedly, like a bobbing chicken.

Feng Fei leaned in, whispering, “Let me tell you, that fellow is extremely sinister and crafty. No matter how familiar you are with him, you’ll only see the tip of the iceberg. His brothers are just like him, led astray but equally inscrutable. You will never be able to figure out their true depth. From the mortal world to the immortal world, I can’t count how many people have been deceived by their outer appearances. In the end, most of them perished without ever understanding how. Just watch in peace. Zhao Qingyu is only an appetizer.”

Hearing Feng Fei’s candid words and experiencing her kind gesture, Long Ziwei was deeply touched. He realized true experts cared little for status and simply acted as they saw fit. Her insight almost moved him to tears.

“Hey, talking behind someone’s back isn’t polite. I take back what I said earlier. You look absolutely terrible today,” Long Chen quipped from a distance, glancing at Feng Fei with a mischievous grin.

Feng Fei burst into laughter again, joined by the female disciples around her. Being with Long Chen seemed to lighten the mood, even in the midst of a tense life-and-death battle. It was as if they believed he could hold up the heavens if they were to fall.

Despite the gravity of the impending fight, neither Long Chen nor Qin Feng appeared tense. Qin Feng gazed calmly at Zhao Qingyu.

“I bet he’s definitely a half-step Heavenly Chosen! Otherwise, he wouldn’t be able to kill Ye Qing so easily!” shouted someone amongst the Ye clan. They refused to believe Qin Feng was only a nine star Heavenly Doyen.

Like usual, this kind of provocation enraged Long Ziwei. He was about to retort when Feng Fei stopped him. “Debating with someone like them only lowers your own stature. Let power speak for itself.”

Just then, the barrier separating them opened, heralding the start of a bloody battle. Countless people held their breaths as they stared in rapt attention.
