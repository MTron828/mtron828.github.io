Chapter 4690 Undying, Indestructible

Seeing Wu Hun’s furious and ugly face, Xia Chen sneered, “Huh, you think a fugly like you can kill us? Just try it!”

Tens of thousands of formation discs lightened up like stars and enveloped the Dragonblood Legion. This was Xia Chen’s strongest defensive formation.

“A frog at the bottom of a well!” Wu Hun sneered. Three distinct-colored lines materialized atop his fist, each representing a unique form of energy. They then intertwined seamlessly before his fist landed.

BOOM!

A giant hole was blasted into Xia Chen’s barrier.

“What?!” Xia Chen was filled with disbelief. His strongest barrier was broken with one attack? How could that happen?

“You thought a single barrier would be able to stop me? How foolish are you? The Three-Headed race’s bloodline revolves around being one with the heavens, earth, and man. No law within this world can stop my bloodline skill!” sneered Wu Hun. Just like that, he walked through the hole in the barrier.

With perfect timing, Gu Yang attacked as quickly as lightning after channeling all of his power.

As Gu Yang’s spear thrust toward Wu Hun’s head, the anticipation of a gruesome outcome filled the air. Yet, to everyone’s astonishment, the expected torrent of blood never appeared.

Gu Yang’s spear solidly landed on Wu Hun’s head, but the sharp tip failed to even pierce through his skin. Gu Yang wasn’t alone in his shock; even Luo Changsheng, Netherdragon Tianzhao, and the others stood dumbfounded by the scene unfolding before them.

They knew just how powerful Gu Yang’s attack was. The spear in his hand was a Saint weapon, but it was unable to even break the defense on Wu Hun’s skin.

Wu Hun then grabbed the tip of the spear, causing a change in Gu Yang’s expression. A potent force surged within the spear, akin to a dormant volcano on the brink of eruption. Most terrifying of all, Gu Yang found himself unable to release his grip on the weapon.

The Dragonblood warriors cried out, sensing imminent danger. Just as Wu Hun’s power was about to erupt, Yue Zifeng’s sword streaked toward Wu Hun’s throat.

“You can’t save him,” Wu Hun sneered as three-colored light flowed on top of his left hand. Just like that, he raised his hand and poured his power through the spear into Gu Yang. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

Two sounds echoed across the battlefield. Gu Yang spat out blood and flew back. Meanwhile, Yue Zifeng's sword penetrated the three-colored divine light, driving into Wu Hun's hand without stopping. The sword pressed onward, piercing through until the hilt was buried deep, its tip hovering a mere inch from Wu Hun's neck.

Unfortunately, Wu Hun was just too large, and his arm was long enough to intercept the sword before it reached its target. Nevertheless, the razor-sharp light emanating from the sword managed to graze the skin of his neck, drawing forth a trickle of three-colored blood.

Wu Hun stood stunned, having not expected Yue Zifeng to be able to breach his protective divine light. This unforeseen turn of events had weakened his killing blow, leaving the resilient Gu Yang with a light injury.

“DIE!” Wu Hun roared furiously as he entered a berserk state, his Blood Qi erupting. Three-colored divine light flowed around his body, strong enough to crush stars.

“Violet Lightning Cloud Piercer!”

Wu Hun’s hand grabbed Yue Zifeng’s sword tightly. Despite being unable to pull it back, Yue Zifeng refused to let go as the sword was an extension of himself. This was a fundamental requirement for a sword cultivator. Even if he had to die, he wouldn’t abandon his sword as it was an inseparable part of his being. With unwavering determination, he channeled all his remaining power into the blade.

A shield with a three-flower diagram then appeared in front of Yue Zifeng, with Bai Xiaole and the Violet Pupil Nine Tail Fox behind it.

BOOM!

Wu Hun’s kick blasted the three-flower shield apart, causing Bai Xiaole to grunt and fly back.

At the same time, a bolt of violet Sword Qi shot out of the tip of Yue Zifeng’s sword, piercing through Wu Hun’s nose and emerging from the back of his head.

Wu Hun recoiled in agony, unleashing a ferocious roar as his entire being surged with Blood Qi. Yue Zifeng was sent flying by that aura.

“Big Brother Zifeng, are you alright?” Bai Xiaole caught Yue Zifeng. With the Violet Pupil Nine Tail Fox’s help, the two of them safely returned to the Dragonblood Legion’s ranks.

Yue Zifeng was as pale as a piece of paper as he had exhausted all of his energy. However, even after receiving such a fatal attack, Wu Hun was still alive.

“You inferior ants, do you think you can kill me?! The Three-Headed Heaven Devouring Beast race is an undying, indestructible existence!” Wu Hun roared, his voice full of fury and ice-cold killing intent.

Indeed, the Three-Headed Heaven Devouring Beast race was one of this world’s most ancient races, said to be undying and indestructible.

However, due to them being sealed all the way back in the primal chaos era, not many people had heard legends about them, including the elite heavenly geniuses in the surroundings.

Seeing Wu Hun survive the fatal attack, Luo Changsheng and the others were dumbfounded. Was there really an undying and indestructible existence in this world?

Even though Wu Hun survived, he seemed to be wracked in pain from Yue Zifeng’s attack. While recovering, he was temporarily unable to attack the Dragonblood Legion.

“Attack now!”

Luo Changsheng and the others quickly recovered from their stupor. Although Wu Hun had temporarily lost his combat ability, they couldn’t wait for him to recover as Long Chen had shown signs of breaking free from his heavenly tribulation.

“Summon the Dragonblood Barrier!” Guo Ran roared. Having finally recovered, he hastily formed hand seals, and his Blood Qi rose out of him like mist.

All the Dragonblood warriors ignited their dragon blood, linking their Blood Qi together to form a giant barrier that was covered in dense scales.

This was their greatest defensive skill, and they employed it now against many nine star Heavenly Doyens. Should the barrier break, the Dragonblood Legion would definitely suffer terrible casualties. With everything at stake, they poured forth all their energies and hopes into this barrier.

Just then, Luo Changsheng and the others’ attacks rained down like a furious tempest.
