Chapter 3761: Holy Land

A group of women in short jackets and skirts walked over. They were slender, with their long legs fully exposed, looking somewhat inappropriate.

Long Chen smiled when he saw them. This was the Spirit race that he was familiar with, the Elven Spirit race. He had encountered them in the mortal world and had fought alongside them. Hence, he naturally felt close to them.

Their leader was a woman looking to be around thirty years old. However, she also seemed to be like a young maiden, full of vitality. She was actually a Divine Venerate.

“I am Long Chen. Greetings, senior.” Long Chen bowed to her.

“You are too courteous. I wouldn’t dare to accept being called senior. I am Jin Yi. You can just call me by my name.” The Divine Venerate returned Long Chen’s bow courteously.

“You mentioned the Devil Eye World just now? What is that?” asked Long Chen.

“It will take a while to explain it, I can’t leave my important guests waiting out here. Why don’t you come to my Spirit race’s holy land for a chat?” Jin Yi gestured invitingly.

Long Chen didn’t really want to go to this so-called holy land. He only wanted to use their land to rush to the Heavenly River Blood Sea.

Fortunately, this place was one end of their territory, and the Heavenly River Blood Sea was closer to the other side. A trip to their holy land shouldn’t take too much time. Furthermore, she had invited him. Not going would be rude.

Moreover, Long Chen still had the ultra transportation formation discs that Xia Chen had given him. He would be able to use them within the Spirit race’s territory. There should be enough time. Even if he wasted a few days, it should be enough to get there in time.

Long Chen and Jiang Lei walked deeper into the forest with Jin Yi. As for the two girls, they narrated how brave Long Chen and Jiang Lei had been to these Elven Spirit women and how they had killed the baddies. The two of them were described as reincarnations of celestial beings.

Jin Yi told Long Chen that the devil experts had only been passing by here. That was the only reason they had suddenly launched an attack.

Within the three thousand worlds, the devil race occupied several territories. In particular, the Devil Eye World only appeared in certain locations occasionally, usually deep within their forbidden lands.

But this time, the Devil Eye World was descending not far from the Spirit race’s territory, and those devil experts were unable to directly use a transportation formation. They had to travel on foot to get there.

It just so happened that some of them were crossing through this region. Thus, they set their sights on the Spirit race and launched a sneak attack, conveniently grabbing a few benefits before leaving.

Also, the Spirit race was in the midst of carrying out a grand ceremony, and their people were gathered in their core territory. When the outer region was suddenly attacked, Jin Yi immediately rushed over to reinforce them, but she was too late. Everything was already over when she arrived.

Now that the Devil Eye World was about to open, the devil race wouldn’t attack them temporarily. Jin Yi felt confident in bringing everyone back.

“Can I ask what the Devil Eye World is?” asked Long Chen.

“The Devil Eye World can be considered an underground spring. As the three thousand worlds was one of the main battlefields of the immemorial battle, countless terrifying existences are buried within it. Although those existences have died, their power has not fully dissipated. Instead, it merged into heaven and earth. Every time there is a change in the world, these energies are released. Whether it is to the natives or the experts from outside this world, these are huge opportunities. But then, competing for these opportunities is a natural tribulation. The strong survive, while the dead become their stepping stones to higher heights. Some terrifying experts always appear at these moments. At the same time, countless lifeforms die. Fortunately, all the major races within the three thousand worlds are at equilibrium and restrained by each other. Although there are countless battles, there are no entire annihilations of a race. It’s just unknown how long this equilibrium can last,” sighed Jin Yi worriedly.

“Equilibrium? The human race doesn’t even have a single territory forbidden to other races. How is that equal? The human race within the three thousand worlds has practically been turned into dogs. But I suppose it is a miracle that they haven’t been wiped out after so many years,” said Long Chen irritably as soon as he thought of his own race bullying their own people.

“The human race’s decline is due to living too long in the cracks of other races. It is like living on the edge of an abyss, as if treading on thin ice. Because of it, their guts shrink more and more. They’ve already lost their fighting spirit,” said Jin Yi.

“No. They haven’t lost their fighting spirit. Whenever they see humans coming from outside this world, they have plenty of fighting spirit.” Long Chen curled his lips.

Jin Yi smiled. “My Spirit race won’t criticize the human race. But your comment has hit the nail on the head. The human race chose to put their safety above all else. As they don’t dare to resist the oppression of the major powers, they can only endure. As long as the other side doesn’t declare war on the human race, they won’t provoke anyone. After a long time, the major powers found that the human race was not enough of a threat to them. Most importantly, the human race could help them with some things.”

“What things?”

Jin Yi hesitated to answer after hearing Long Chen’s question. Long Chen asked, “It couldn’t be that they are being spies, helping other races to keep an eye on the human race?”Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

“Perhaps not just surveillance. The human race in the three thousand worlds is actually the greatest danger to the humans coming from outside this world. It’s unknown how many heroes of the human race were silently killed by their own race,” sighed Jin Yi.

Upon hearing this, Long Chen’s heart pounded with fury. Xia Guhong had told him to be careful of the human race. He had been prepared, but hearing this, it seemed that the human race was even worse than he had thought.

“No wonder those two girls thought that I was a bad person! It seems that your race has endured quite a bit at the hands of the human race!” Long Chen sighed.

Jin Yi smiled. “The human race has good and bad points. We won’t judge any race as good or bad, so don’t feel bad or feel responsible. I’m only telling you these things so that you know of the danger. Don’t get harmed by your own race.”

“Many thanks for the reminder.”

Long Chen had experienced countless battles and had seen all kinds of people. It wasn’t easy to trick him. But he was still enraged just at the thought.

Those that could make him lower his guard were essentially kind people. Yet, a group of evil humans actually used the human race’s kindness and trust to strip away other people’s lives. Long Chen was so angry that he wanted to kill them all.

As they were speaking, they arrived at an ancient altar. Jin Yi then clasped her hands in devout prayer.

After that, the altar quivered and space shook. Long Chen felt a gentle spatial energy wrap around him. When that happened, the surrounding space grew illusory. They entered a spacetime channel.

In all his years, it was his first time experiencing such a transportation formation. Furthermore, the transportation energy was completely different from others.

When the transportation ended, Long Chen and Jiang Lei saw countless figures devoutly praying while kneeling on the ground.

Looking in the direction they were praying, Long Chen’s body suddenly shook intensely. He couldn’t believe his eyes.

“It’s her!”
