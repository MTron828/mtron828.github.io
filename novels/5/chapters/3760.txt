Chapter 3749 Fulfill Your Wish

Long Chen’s gaze turned to the source of the voice, and he saw a Supreme heavenly genius staring at him coldly. Long Chen didn’t recognize him, but based on the thrumming devil qi coming from his body, it was clear he had a reason for being so hostile.Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

This devil expert had dozens of other members of his race around him. Three of them were also Supreme experts. But the rest were merely ordinary members of the devil race.

At this moment, countless experts around the transportation formation were looking over at Long Chen due to the devil expert’s roar.

This transportation formation was located outside of an ancient city. This city was called the Seven Star City. As for its origins, Long Chen didn’t know. It was simply marked as such on the map.

This city was a central power. Although it was the territory of the human race, the other races were also welcomed here. As long as they didn’t cause trouble in the city and followed the rules here, Seven Star City would welcome them.

This was a rather large city within the three thousand worlds. There were tens of thousands of transportation formations inside leading to many places. In fact, these transportation formations were able to cover almost one percent of the area in the three thousand worlds.

Although one percent sounded small, it had to be known that the three thousand worlds were enormous. One percent of its land was something that an ordinary Divine Lord flying at full speed would require a century to cross.

Furthermore, the three thousand worlds were filled with many races, taboo areas, and danger zones that couldn’t be crossed. Being able to cover one percent of it was already amazing.

Thus, Seven Star City was filled with countless heavenly geniuses. There were the native experts, as well as the geniuses of the nine heavens. The liveliness was rather chaotic.

To the experts of the nine heavens, this opening of the three thousand worlds was an extremely rare chance to temper them. But it was the same thing for the natives.

That was because when the three thousand worlds opened to the nine heavens, a heaven-toppling transformation would occur within the three thousand worlds. The laws of the world would grow complete, and breaking through to the Immortal King realm at this time would mean that condensing a Heavenly Dao Crown was no longer a dream.

Furthermore, when the gate to the nine heavens was opened, some forbidden areas, danger zones, and treasure lands would burst out like volcanoes within the three thousand worlds. All kinds of treasures would appear. The experts of the nine heavens had waited years for this chance, but so had the experts of the three thousand worlds.

Seven Star City was only a somewhat large city within the three thousand worlds. It wasn’t close to the biggest cities. Despite that, many experts were gathered here. Perhaps they were in the midst of travel, or they were resting, buying supplies, or gathering with others. Just the number of Divine Lords alone in this city was uncountable. Supreme experts were not even particularly novel here. With just a random look, you could find a few.

Quite a bit of attention was drawn by the devil expert’s challenge toward Long Chen. However, people’s expressions were still calm and apathetic. It seemed that they had long since gotten used to such a thing.

“How laughable. When have you ever seen me run? If the three of you want to play, I’ll accompany you,” said Long Chen indifferently.

Even in front of three Supreme experts, Long Chen didn’t take them seriously. Last time, Huo Linger had slain that demonic beast Supreme expert with barely any effort at all. Long Chen very much wished to know just how powerful she was now.

“It is forbidden to fight in front of Seven Star City. If you want to compete, go to the life-and-death stages to the city’s west.” Long Chen had just replied when a guard beside the transportation formation warned them coldly.

Only then did Long Chen take note of ten armored guards surrounding the transportation formation.

Even some of the guards here were half-step Divine Venerates. Long Chen saw four elders and was amazed inside. But thinking about it, if it was just World Kings standing guard over this place, these arrogant heavenly geniuses wouldn’t give a damn about them.

“Long Chen, do you dare to fight on the martial stage?!” the devil expert shouted at him. He clearly had immense confidence in himself.

He intentionally spread his voice far and wide, drawing countless gazes. Even some experts that had already walked into the city turned back to look.

There were countless experts here. The various races and powers stared at Long Chen. Every single one of them had the attitude of watching a good show.

“Just you? No. My time is very precious.”

Long Chen eyed him. Although he did want to pluck a few more Supreme Heavenly Dao Fruits, after seeing so many Supreme experts here, he was in no rush. The meat would land in his pot sooner or later.

“Are you afraid? This is your human race’s city. Are you going to lose the face of the entire human race here?” sneered the devil expert. Long Chen ignored him and walked toward the city gates, brushing past him.

Long Chen continued into the city. Countless experts shook their heads, feeling like Long Chen was gutless. They were sad about not being able to see a good show.

“How useless. Did your parents give birth to a tortoise?” Suddenly, a human expert sneered just as Long Chen reached the gate.

This person was also a Supreme expert with a shocking aura. He obviously looked down on Long Chen for not daring to face this challenge.

However, as soon as he said this, black qi swirled in Long Chen’s eyes. The entire world seemed to fall into an iceberg.

That person’s expression completely changed. He was the first to sense anything. A golden shield appeared in his hand.

“Stop!”

“It is forbidden to attack within Seven Star City!”

Those four half-step Divine Venerates shouted furiously.

BOOM!

Regretfully, Long Chen didn’t listen to them. The Minghong Saber came out of its sheath like a bolt of lightning. That golden shield was just raised when Long Chen’s saber fell. The golden shield’s runes had yet to fully light up, and its defenses weren’t even activated. As a result, Long Chen’s saber shattered it.

Half of the human expert’s body exploded. Just as his broken body quivered along with his soul, Long Chen passed by him, cutting his throat.

His head flew through the air. A Supreme expert didn’t even have a chance to unleash his power before being slain.

“Brat, how brazen! Capture him!”

Those four half-step Divine Venerates were enraged. To kill someone in front of the city gate was clearly a challenge to the dignity of Seven Star City. He didn’t place them in their eyes. Thus, the four of them attacked at the same time.

“Scram!”

Long Chen swept out the Minghong Saber. When his divine ring and starry sea appeared, a layer of star light appeared on the Minghong Saber. 

BOOM!

A huge explosion erupted. The four half-step Divine Venerates grunted at the same time and were blown back.

Now, countless people were shocked. The devil experts that had previously challenged Long Chen were the most shocked. They had not expected him to be so terrifying.

Their expressions completely changed when Long Chen looked at them now. Explosive killing intent was barely contained in Long Chen’s eyes, completely locking onto them.

Suddenly, Long Chen’s figure vanished. Goosebumps then exploded over their bodies. A terrifying sense of death enveloped them.

“Since you wish to die so badly, I will fulfill your wish.” When Long Chen reappeared, he was right above their heads. The Minghong Saber slashed down like a river of stars.
