Chapter 4408 Netherdragon Tianye

“Hmph, a little human also dares to talk so arrogantly. After crushing you, I’ll slaughter the rest of your pathetic race. I wonder which family managed to raise such an idiotic thing!” the dragon expert shouted. Following that, he stamped on the ground and unleashed a punch at the void.

He was hundreds of miles away from Long Chen, yet the moment he attacked, he seemed to teleport right in front of Long Chen.

His fist resembled black iron covered in scales. As it was launched, a kind of space-tearing sound shook people’s eardrums. This punch, fully based on physical strength, seemed even more terrifying than any magical arts and divine abilities they had ever seen. Even the Heavenly Daos were about to collapse in front of it.

“Then let me see what kind of breed you are to dare act arrogant in front of Boss Long San.” Long Chen snorted and unleashed a fist covered in golden scales.

BOOM!

The golden fist and the black fist collided, unleashing an explosion that shook the land. The next moment, Long Chen and the dragon expert both swayed and took a step back.

A ripple then unfurled, pushing aside the ten thousand Daos. The two of them simply stood at the heart of the ripple, appearing incredibly wild and domineering.

“What power!”

Seeing Long Chen fight evenly against the dragon expert, Ye Ling was shocked and then reinvigorated.

As expected, due to her realm being suppressed and her weak condition, her senses were off and unable to accurately judge Long Chen’s power. In this case though, she had underestimated him.

“You were holding back before?!” The dragon expert glared at Long Chen furiously. Long Chen was now much stronger than before.

“Not quite. I just didn’t want to wake up my little sister. Since you possess the aura of the Netherworld, you must be a dark nether dragon. No wonder you’re such an eyesore. Having abandoned the noble bloodline of the dragon race to control the laws of the Netherworld, all of you can even be considered traitors of the dragon race,” said Long Chen coldly.

Just now, in that solid exchange, Long Chen had sensed a familiar aura. That was the aura of the Netherworld.

Even someone as powerful as the palace master would have been unable to distinguish this aura, but Long Chen was different. Having become one with Ming Cangyue and Leng Yueyan, he was extremely sensitive to the aura of the Netherworld.

“You don’t know anything! Who do you think you are to judge the nether dragon race?!”

The dragon expert roared, and a burst of black qi erupted behind him, infecting this space. As his dragon cry echoed through the heavens and earth, a formidable nether dragon shrouded in primal chaos qi emerged from the darkness.

As the dark nether dragon unfurled its mighty draconic power, lightning raged throughout this world, and razor-sharp gusts cut through the land. This world seemed to have transformed into hell on earth.

Within this black world, the dragon expert was the almighty master. It was like a single thought from him could slay everyone in this space.

Long Chen looked at this manifestation in shock. This fellow’s power had likely exceeded the limit of a Triple Supreme. It seemed to have reached another level, one that he had never come into contact with.

“Ignorant human, you will pay the price for your foolishness! The might of the dark nether dragon race isn’t something you can imagine!”

As his voice reverberated throughout the world, even the laws of the Heavenly Daos were obeying his command.

“You’ve exceeded a Triple Supreme?” asked Long Chen.

“Triple Supreme? Hahaha, what a naive appellation. Triple Supremes are trash in front of me! Remember my name, Netherdragon Tianye! That’s the name that will shake this world. As for you, your life will be taken by me, the owner of this name!” exclaimed the dragon expert as he finally revealed his name.

To Long Chen’s surprise, this dragon expert’s name actually included a surname. Normally, the dragon race’s experts would only have a given name, and even if they did have a surname, it would simply be Dragon.

The names of the dragon race differed significantly from those of the human race. Some were incredibly lengthy, requiring half a day to pronounce, while others comprised just a single word. However, regardless of their length, none of them included a surname other than Dragon, as it signified a betrayal.

In the case of Netherdragon Tianye, he not only incorporated Nether into his surname but also positioned it before the word Dragon. This act served as clear evidence that the nether dragon race had fully severed ties and betrayed the dragon race.

“Nine Dragon Transformation!”

Suddenly, Netherdragon Tianye vanished. Seeing this, Long Chen was startled and instinctively unleashed a claw behind him.

BOOM!

Out of nowhere, a black dragon claw materialized and struck Long Chen’s palm. Long Chen then grunted, feeling sharp pain from his palm.

Following that, the space in front of Long Chen twisted. Reacting swiftly, he delivered a powerful kick and perfectly struck a dragon claw with the tip of his foot. However, the sheer force of the dragon claw propelled Long Chen backward, sending him flying through the air.

The void once more twisted, and Long Chen dodged, narrowly avoiding having his neck caught. However, three small cuts now marred his neck.

“What speed.” Long Chen narrowed his eyes. Netherdragon Tianye moved with such astonishing speed that Long Chen struggled to detect his figure and the trajectory of his attacks. Thankfully, Long Chen’s instinct had been tempered through countless life-and-death battles, so he could evade them all with it.

The void twisted, and Netherdragon Tianye’s figure slowly reappeared. He looked at Long Chen with a hint of surprise.

“I didn’t expect your reaction speed to be fast enough to keep up. I’m getting interested in you. Killing you might be more fun than I initially thought.”

Netherdragon Tianye licked the blood off of his fingernails. When he tasted it, his eyes lit up. “Your dragon blood is actually so pure! It seems that it has quite the background. Little fellow, who does your dragon blood come from? Tell me and I’ll leave your corpse intact.”

“Friend of the human race, let us work together to deal with him. This person is said to be a Heavenly Doyen, and only by working together do we have a chance to beat him.” Ye Ling’s voice rang out in Long Chen’s mind. She was leading the Earth Spirit race’s experts in combat against the Eternal experts.

Although her realm was suppressed, she was still incredibly powerful. With the rest of the Earth Spirit race, numbering almost a hundred Eternal experts, they were fighting evenly against the other side.

While Ye Ling was fighting, the majority of her focus was on Long Chen. After all, the battle on his side would determine the overall result.

“Hahaha, even if the two of you were to join forces, it would be meaningless. Do you think that I’m afraid?” Netherdragon Tianye laughed, and he suddenly turned blurry. Although he said that he was unafraid of them joining forces, he clearly intended on stopping them before they could do so.

“Dragon King Battle Armor!”

A brilliant dragon cry echoed, and Long Chen was covered in gleaming golden dragon scales. A holy dragon's might then surged forth as Long Chen’s dragon blood blazed with full intensity.

“Senior is looking too highly on him. Let me see just how much skill a so-called Heavenly Doyen has.”

Long Chen’s dragon claw suddenly stabbed into the void, where two dragon claws clashed, unleashing a huge shockwave.

“Get out here!”

Following Long Chen’s shout, Netherdragon Tianye was pulled out of the void. With a flawless arc, Long Chen's left hand landed a firm strike on Netherdragon Tianye’s face.

“Who let you be arrogant?!”
