Chapter 4467 Saint Sneak Attack

“They knew that we would come back, so they sealed off the Esoteric Spirit World in advance. This barrier uses the Esoteric Spirit World’s power. We have to break it from the inside. Otherwise, even the combined might of four Saints would prove ineffective against it if attempted from the outside,” said Ye Ling.

All the expressions of the Earth Spirit race’s experts changed. Breaking this barrier from the outside would be like facing the laws of the entire Esoteric Spirit World.

“Xia Chen, what do you think?” asked Long Chen.

Xia Chen was already examining the formation closely. After a while, he smiled. “The structure of this barrier is simple and crude. It’s a minor matter for me to dismantle it.”

After saying that, Xia Chen started to take out formation discs. With Guo Ran’s help, thousands of formation discs were quickly set up around the barrier in a set pattern. Despite looking random, there was a vague meaning behind their positions that felt just out of reach.

After two hours, the runes on the formation discs started to light up and pulse according to their own rhythm.

It was like there was a tide scrubbing against the barrier, and the barrier started to flow with it as well. At first, their rhythms were off, but after a while, they gradually merged into one.

As the barrier rumbled and shuddered, it started to twist.

“The human race’s formation arts really are amazing. To use external objects and forces to control a power millions of times greater than yourself, in this aspect, the human race is unmatched.” The palace master let out a deep sigh. Although he didn’t know formation arts, he could tell that Xia Chen had used these formation discs to imitate the laws of the Darklight Heaven and dismantle the barrier.

Xia Chen’s power wasn’t strong. However, with his formations, he was able to shake a barrier that even Saints could do nothing to. Witnessing this, the palace master had no choice but to sigh in amazement at the human race’s ingenuity.

The Earth Spirit race’s experts felt a renewed sense of vigor. They had seen Xia Chen in action before—his commanding wave of hands filled the air with talismans, effectively beating back budding Doyens. Now, as he demonstrated the ability to dismantle such a terrifying barrier, their admiration for the Dragonblood Legion deepened.

Suddenly, Xia Chen waved his hand, and all the formation discs were drawn back toward him, leaving everyone baffled. The barrier still wasn’t broken, no?

There was still the tide pattern on top of the barrier. It was quivering, but it showed no signs of breaking.

“Boss, what do you think?” asked Xia Chen.

“Leave the formation intact and just create an opening for us. We’ll catch them like turtles in a jar,” said Long Chen.

“Alright!” Xia Chen took out a dozen new formation discs and embedded them in the fluctuating barrier.

Originally, Xia Chen had been planning on directly shattering the barrier. That would be simpler. However, if they did that and wanted to slaughter all their enemies, they would have to spend a great deal of effort guarding the exit.

Now, since Long Chen wanted to preserve the barrier to prevent that from happening, Xia Chen needed to use more meticulous formation arts to make a hole in the barrier without breaking it. He also needed to change his method of dealing with the barrier.

To put it frankly, this barrier had been put up by the people inside. It resembled a chained door, and Xia Chen’s goal extended beyond merely opening it. He wanted to change their chain so that their key could no longer open it.

Two hours later, a vortex appeared on the barrier—the entrance to the Esoteric Spirit World. However, it was a one-way entrance. Once you were in, there was no getting out.

“I’ll go first.”

Without hesitation, the palace master entered the vortex and vanished.Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

After the palace master entered, Long Chen didn’t move, causing Ye Ling to feel baffled. “Are we not going as well?”

“We’re going to wait a minute. The people inside knew that Xia Chen was opening the gate, so they likely laid a trap for us within. The palace master will disrupt their plans, providing us with a secure deployment zone. However, it'll take some time,” explained Long Chen.

Just then, the barrier started to flicker and shudder intensely, and a terrifying pressure came from the other side of the barrier.

“As expected, there were Saints lying in wait!” Ye Ling’s expression changed as she recognized those auras. Two of them belonged to her mortal enemies, but surprisingly, aside from those two, two other Saint auras were unfamiliar to her.

In other words, when the palace master entered, he directly faced an attack from four Saints all at once. Ye Ling’s heart clenched.

“No need to worry. The palace master’s power surpasses all our imaginations,” assured Long Chen. Long Chen had absolute confidence in the palace master.

Although the palace master was only an Eternal expert, Long Chen trusted his power unconditionally. Certain individuals transcended the limitations of their realm, and the palace master was one such person. Long Chen, too, belonged to this exceptional category.

The barrier shuddered intensely before quickly becoming still again. Long Chen shouted, “Now!”

Summoning his divine ring and donning the Dragon King Battle Armor, Long Chen held a flame lotus in his hand and propelled himself through the vortex. Without sparing a glance, he thrust the flame lotus forward.

“Explode!”

Long Chen instantly detonated the flame lotus, unleashing a wave of raging fire.

Within that wave of fire, Long Chen saw countless figures and weapons succumbing to its wrath, accompanied by the furious roars of countless lifeforms.

Just as Long Chen predicted, while the palace master had charged in, countless experts lingered near the entrance to ambush them. However, Long Chen struck first. Regardless of whether there were indeed individuals guarding the entrance, he opted for an offensive approach.

As a result, his sudden attack caught these experts off guard. Still in the midst of launching their assault on Long Chen, they were abruptly interrupted and sent flying by the force of the flame lotus.

Many miles away, Long Chen sensed terrifying auras that shook his heart. These were not Saint auras; instead, they emanated from seven awakened Doyens who bore the brunt of his fire wave, along with over ten thousand budding Doyens.

“Die!”

A furious roar rang out, and sharp qi pierced through the heavens, heading straight for Long Chen.

BOOM!

Long Chen also roared and unleashed a punch covered in flowing stars, blowing the sharp qi apart. To his surprise, this attack was actually a wooden thorn.

“A wood element cultivator?”

Just as Long Chen shattered that wood-element Doyen’s attack, vines silently snaked around his legs. With Long Chen’s attention on the wooden thorn, the vines succeeded in wrapping around him.

“Not good!”

Long Chen was startled, and before he could react, the vines constricted around him. Long Chen instinctively tried to break them, only to find that they were incomparably tough. Now rendered powerless and immobile, he couldn’t unleash any of his strength.

At this moment, a warhammer smashed through the air at him. Another terrifying Doyen appeared, and their cooperation was seamless.

Just as that warhammer was about to land, a ray of Sword Qi severed the vines wrapped around Long Chen’s feet, delighting him. Yue Zifeng had come. Regaining his freedom, Long Chen took out a bronze cauldron and smashed the warhammer with it.
