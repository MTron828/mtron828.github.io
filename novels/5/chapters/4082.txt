Chapter 4071 Uncle Tree Makes a Move

At almost the same time, dozens of swords simply came out and returned to their sheaths, drawing the blood of experts in a quick slash.

At this moment, the Dragonblood warriors looked very calm, their faces not showing even the slightest ripple as though they had just done something completely insignificant when they killed over twenty Double Supremes in a beat.

“Courting death!”

Ye Wenxuan roared. He hadn’t viewed Long Chen and the others as a threat at the start. After all, none of them had the aura of the Heavenly Daos of the Nirvana Overflow Heaven on them, so they were clearly outsiders.

Thus, even if they had come on a Ghost Ship, he didn’t view them as anyone amazing, thinking that twenty Double Supremes would be enough to frighten them into submission.

Those twenty-some Double Supremes had also thought the same. However, the Dragonblood warriors weren’t playing with them, so they directly took the lives of these fools.

Feeling furious, Ye Wenxuan took action himself, his sharp claws reaching for Long Chen’s throat. When his manifestation burst into existence, a powerful pressure caused the Heavenly Daos to rumble.

It went without saying that Ye Wenxuan was very powerful. Furthermore, because he was an expert who had grown up in the Nirvana Overflow Heaven, the Heavenly Daos in this area supported his every move.

This was different from any foreigners. Due to the different laws between heavens, if the foreigners wanted to establish themselves in the Nirvana Overflow Heaven, they would need to first obtain the recognition of the laws of the Nirvana Overflow Heaven.

However, for them to gain this recognition would require at least half a year’s time. Only then would they be able to borrow the power of the Heavenly Daos.

Thus, any new foreigners would have very great difficulty integrating themselves into this world, and they would often be bullied by others.

Without the support of the Heavenly Daos, their magical arts and normal attacks would be flimsy. Essentially, a newcomer would lose half of their cultivation base’s power, so they would usually have to be obedient to any other experts that they encountered here.

BOOM!

Long Chen didn’t even need to move. At this moment, a metallic hand had caught Ye Wenxuan’s claw.

Ye Wenxuan then saw the armor-clad Guo Ran and felt sharp pain striking his wrist. It felt like it would be torn off.

“Release me!” Ye Wenxuan kicked Guo Ran’s abdomen. Although this was a normal attack, most people would avoid getting struck in their Dantian and naturally let go of their grasp. Even if they didn’t let go, the distraction would allow the enemies to easily pull away.

However, Ye Wenxuan had miscalculated. Guo Ran was covered in armor and had no dead angles, so there was no such thing as a vital spot. Without it, there was no need for him to dodge.

Also, when Ye Wenxuan’s kick landed, needles sprouted out of Guo Ran’s armor. It was like he was a porcupine.

Following that, Long Chen and the others couldn’t bear to watch it. Ye Wenxuan’s calf was directly pierced through, leaving countless holes.

“AH!” Ye Wenxuan screamed like a pig being slaughtered. These needles were an automatic defense that contained some kind of poison.

If it was just poison, it would be one thing, but it actually had the rust scraped off of the Ghost Ship. This rust had been modified by Xia Chen through a formation to turn into sharp needles, and anyone pierced by them would be doomed.

As a result, Ye Wenxuan’s bloody leg rapidly rotted. Most terrifying of all, it was rapidly spreading.

“Release Wenxuan, or you’ll all die!!!”

Just then, the void exploded. The Heaven Venerate finally revealed himself.

He was a middle-aged man in white robes with golden threads throughout it, looking to be about forty years old. He was glaring at Long Chen furiously.

“Or we’ll all die? Haha, then I want to see how we’ll die,” sneered Long Chen.

Long Chen knew that Ye Wenxuan’s provocations were a test. But this kind of test was insulting and humiliating to him.

First of all, ignoring that Long Chen had helped them, even if they had no relationship at all, such a test was clearly a slap in their faces. Long Chen was in the habit of slapping others in the face, but he refused to receive one himself.

Long Chen knew that Ye Wenxuan most likely possessed some kind of special status. Thus, he was just planning on giving the latter a lesson and leaving it at that.

Based on normal practice, when this Heaven Venerate appeared, he should first apologize and say that this child was lacking manners. And in order to give him face, everyone would take a step back.

Long Chen also wouldn’t make things hard on him if that was the case. This whole thing could be brushed aside as a little scuffle before becoming friends. Well, although they might not become friends, at the very least, things wouldn’t go too far.

However, this old fellow was so arrogant, saying that he would make sure that they all died. Who did they think they were? Long Chen was not so patient.

“Ignorant junior! Since you don’t recognize kindness, you can die now!”Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

The Heaven Venerate pointed his finger and shot a ray of divine light toward Guo Ran, reaching his head almost the instant it appeared.

Fortunately, Long Chen had long since been prepared and slashed the ray of light with his saber. With an explosive boom, Long Chen grunted and flew back, his Blood Qi flipping inside of him. He almost coughed up blood.

He was instantly enraged. This old fellow had really launched a killing blow.

“Uncle Tree, kill him!”

Feeling enraged, Long Chen gave up on holding back. As fellow humans, this old man just had to be so tyrannical. Even other races wouldn’t treat him so badly, no?

The Heaven Venerate was startled to see Long Chen block his attack. He had not been holding back at all, but a little Immortal King had actually blocked it.

At this moment, killing intent exploded from within him. He definitely couldn’t allow such a figure to live.

However, just as he was about to launch another killing blow at Long Chen, a silent wooden spear pierced through the ground behind him.

Having not imagined that there would be another hidden expert here, he didn’t even have time to dodge. His body was directly pierced through.

In that instant, he was terrified to sense the energy in his body rapidly flowing away.

Thus, he hastily formed hand seals and spat out a mouthful of blood, which then condensed into a strange totem in the sky.

“Sacred Light Blood Evasion!”

The Heaven Venerate’s body shook as he forcibly tore himself off the wooden spear, entering the blood totem.

When he tore off the wooden spear, it was possible to see his flesh and innards be ripped out. Apparently, this spear had rapidly rooted inside his body. All that could be said was that he was truly a vicious character, as he was capable of making the instantaneous decision to sacrifice a portion of his body to flee.

“Just you wait, our Ye clan won’t let you off!”

In an instant, the Heaven Venerate vanished once he entered the blood totem, but his furious roar echoed throughout the land.

BOOM!

The blood totem suddenly exploded, covering Long Chen and the others in its light. At the same time, Uncle Tree’s expression changed.

“Not good. He placed a tracking seal on us.”
