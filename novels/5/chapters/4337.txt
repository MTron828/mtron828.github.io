Chapter 4326 Pathway of the Nine Heavens

As the formation disc exploded, numerous runic swords shot out, and three half-step Eternals directly turned to ash.

Meanwhile, the other half-step Eternals who were a bit slower and hadn't reached the core of the formation disc were pierced by those runic swords, but they survived the attack. Despite that, they were horrified and hastily fled. The other experts were equally terrified, having never witnessed such a technique before.

“Boss isn’t interested in wasting time on you, but if you really want to die so badly, I don’t mind fulfilling your dreams. I’m leaving now. If anyone wants to die, come try and stop me,” sneered Xia Chen. Just like that, he carried Long Chen away with Guo Ran.

They weren’t particularly fast, leaving plenty of time for people to attack them. However, Xia Chen’s single attack had slaughtered three half-step Eternals in the blink of an eye, scaring anyone from attempting to stop them.

In truth, Xia Chen was just bluffing when he said that he wanted to kill all of them. While he did want them dead, he was unwilling to use up all his formation discs.

After all, the formation discs he had brought back from the humanless world were limited in number, so each one he expended was a valuable resource lost. Until he had the ability to create them himself, he was hesitant to use them indiscriminately.

These formation discs couldn’t be underestimated just because they were small. In truth, they contained their own pocket dimension, packed with hundreds of primal chaos spirit stones, which granted them their formidable killing power.

Although Xia Chen had plenty of primal chaos spirit stones, these were all exceptionally precious to him. In Xia Chen’s eyes, these half-step Eternals weren’t worth the money it would take to kill them.

In front of the appalled gazes of countless experts, Xia Chen and Guo Ran carried Long Chen away. In the end, not one of them dared to even make a sound.

The three of them had just left when furious roars came from the other side of the gate. Their pursuers had finally arrived by the gate, but they were one step too late. Long Chen had returned to the Nirvana Overflow Heaven, and they could only vent their frustration through the gate.

However, after venting for a while, they found that something was wrong. The surrounding laws of space were broken, and they also found a few destroyed bodies. For a moment, they were left in a state of shock and confusion.

…

“Long Chen, the great nine star heir, can you hear my call?” That elderly voice once more resounded from within the endless darkness.

“Why is it that you can only communicate with me in my weakest moments?” muttered Long Chen.

“It’s because I can only sense you when you are at your weakest. This is the only time your heart is free of other thoughts, and you can hear me,” responded the elderly voice.

“Your voice is now very clear. Is that because my realm is higher or because we’re now closer?” asked Long Chen.

“It is because we are closer. I can already sense that you have entered the pathway of the nine heavens. We are now one step closer.” The elderly voice sounded a bit excited.

“The pathway of the nine heavens? Is the humanless world the pathway of the nine heavens?” Long Chen was startled.

“I don’t know about the humanless world, but I can confirm that you just entered the pathway of the nine heavens. You are now in the eighth heaven, the Nirvana Overflow Heaven, and you just came out of the channel. In truth, had you gone through that channel, you would have reached the ninth heaven,” said the elder.

Upon hearing this, Long Chen’s heart trembled. The term "nine heavens" referred to nine worlds, each with barriers separating them, and they were collectively referred to as the nine heavens.

The nine heavens could also be differentiated by power. From the Darklight Heaven to the Violet Flame Heaven, and then to the Nirvana Overflow Heaven, Long Chen had been constantly going to higher worlds.

Previously, Long Chen had thought that the Nirvana Overflow Heaven was the highest of the nine heavens. Unexpectedly, it was only the eighth, so the ninth heaven had to be the greatest world.

According to this elder, the humanless world didn’t even count as a real world; it was just a channel connecting the Nirvana Overflow Heaven to the ninth heaven. However, Long Chen hadn’t seen any exit to the ninth heaven within the humanless world. Had he simply missed it?

“Great nine star heir, I can sense the change in the world. Countless nine star heirs are now rising like shooting stars. The time of our revenge is coming,” said the elder excitedly.

“Revenge? What revenge?” asked Long Chen.

“The blood debt of the nine star line. This is the chance for the human race to soar once more. Long Chen, great nine star heir, have you not yet sensed the mission you carry on your shoulders?” asked the elder.Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Mission?”

Long Chen pondered for a moment. “I really haven’t sensed anything. I feel like fate is constantly toying with me, and its guillotine always slams down right behind me, forcing me to run forward with all my power.”

“What? Every nine star heir will condense their life star when they awaken the Five Star Battle Armor. And obtain…” The elder was bewildered, suddenly hesitating to tell Long Chen.

“Life star? What is that? What will they obtain…?” asked Long Chen.

The elder didn’t reply and muttered to himself, “How can this be? This shouldn’t be!”

“Senior, can you answer me?” asked Long Chen sternly. He wanted to know just what secret lay within his cultivation art.

“In truth, every nine star heir will come to awaken their mission after reaching a certain realm. You all have different missions, so I also don’t know how to answer you,” said the elder finally.

“Then what about you? Can you tell me who you are?” asked Long Chen.

“I am the awakener, the one who awakens slumbering nine star heirs,” said the elder.

“Then tell me, do you know the complete Nine Star Hegemon Body Art?” asked Long Chen.

“The Nine Star Hegemon Body Art is innate to all nine star heirs. As your power rises, you awaken the cultivation art step by step. Is that not the same for you?” asked the elder, more bewildered than ever.

Upon hearing this, Long Chen’s heart shook. He suddenly had a very odd feeling and didn’t directly reply.

“Senior, can you tell me the mission of nine star heirs?”

“I’m sorry, but I am only the awakener of nine star heirs, so I don’t have the right to direct you. You will need to realize it yourself,” said the elder apologetically. “I can only warn you that immense danger is about to befall. The nine heavens and ten lands will soon be destroyed, and you are all the final hope of this world. There is not much time left. If you don’t quicken the pace, it really will be too late.”

If it was before, Long Chen would feel uneasy and anxious after hearing the elder’s words. But for some reason, this time, he felt much more at peace.

Long Chen didn’t reply. This endless darkness caused his thoughts to become clear, and he felt calmer than ever.

“Please answer this one question. Who is the Pill Sovereign?” asked Long Chen suddenly.

“You…! How do you know of the Pill Sovereign?!” The elder seemed so shocked by this question that even his voice quivered.

“Please answer me.”

Buzz.

Suddenly, the darkness vanished and Long Chen woke up. The moment he opened his eyes, Yu Qingxuan and Bai Shishi’s startled cries rang out in his ears.
