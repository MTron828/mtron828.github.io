Chapter 3777: Playing Big

One mountain-sized figure after another was dragged out of the blood sea by the chains of the heavenly tribulation. People were so terrified that their souls almost fled their bodies.

“Could it be…?!”

It wasn’t just the blood sea. The lightning chains pierced through the void, directly tearing through the land outside the sea and dragging corpses out.

Even the demonic beasts outside the tribulation were horrified and didn’t even dare to move. They just allowed those lightning chains to drag the corpses out of the ground.

When the heavenly tribulations bound the skeletons, thunderforce poured through their bones. After that, as lightning runes appeared on top of the bones, their innate runes were also activated.

All of a sudden, one of them raised its head and roared. Its roar shook the sky. It then spread its bone wings, and flames actually burst out of it, igniting the dome of the heavens. It was actually revived by the thunderforce.

“It’s the immemorial divine phoenix race!”

A Supreme expert cried out in shock. Although that beast was already reduced to a skeleton, based on its aura, it was still possible to recognize its identity.

The divine phoenix opened its mouth. Lightning and flames mixed and burst out of it, striking the experts undergoing tribulation

However, just as those flames flew out, they transformed into runes and floated toward Huo Linger. Huo Linger was chanting the Nirvana Scripture, and the world’s flame energy was gathering toward her.

Despite that, the lightning from the divine phoenix’s attack still sent several Supreme experts flying. The weaker demonic beasts under their protection were instantly obliterated.

One ancient demonic beast after another revived, their roars shaking the heavens. They began to attack everyone undergoing tribulation.

“How can this be?!”

Seeing all those skeletons attacking, even Supreme experts were terrified. Those were their ancestors, but they actually had to face them like this.

“Spit the Heavens 1!”

Long Chen pierced through the head of one of those ancient beasts, directly destroying the crystal core in its head.

BOOM!

Just as Long Chen had expected, the crystal core was the true source of their power. Once the core was destroyed, the skeleton exploded, disintegrating into powder. Lightning runes within it exploded.

“What pure thunderforce!”𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Lei Linger was delighted. Once one of these ancient beasts was killed, the thunderforce driving their movements was released. She then felt her power crazily soaring just from absorbing this energy.

“You keep silently absorbing the energy. Keep a distance from Kun Tu, the Underworld Eye Giant, and that beast cultivator. Don’t be noticed by them,” implored Long Chen cautiously.

If Lei Linger didn’t get close to them, they would have great difficulty noticing her. She had transformed into millions and millions of tiny lightning dragons hidden within the void, and those lightning dragons secretly absorbed the runes that were exposed. Reaping without sowing was far more efficient compared to destroying the runes herself.

Suddenly, Long Chen’s heart shook. He instinctively dodged to the side, and a lightning sword passed through the space he had just been in.

The lightning sword pierced a hole through the void. Unfortunately, two Supreme demonic beasts were unable to dodge in time and were devoured by that hole. They cried out, trying to escape the black hole. But the void sealed shut, and their figures vanished. Everyone was horrified by this.

Just then, the beast that unleashed that lightning sword charged at Long Chen.

This giant beast was surrounded by lightning spikes. It was like a hedgehog with two heads. However, due to the lack of flesh and blood, it was difficult to tell what exactly this lifeform was. Even so, the attack it had just released was truly terrifying.

“Not good!” Seeing it rushing toward him with its body rapidly inflating, Long Chen’s expression suddenly changed. As lightning wings appeared on his back, he swung his saber and retreated.

BOOM!

Long Chen’s saber struck the hedgehog, causing it to explode. But its spikes shot out in every direction like heaven-piercing spears.

“Incoming!”

Tens of thousands of spikes flew through the air. In the chaos, there was nowhere to dodge. There were other immemorial demonic beasts around as well.

The lightning spikes raged. It was unknown how many experts were struck by them and turned to dust. Even Supreme experts were unable to resist.

It wasn’t just Supreme experts that were killed by that attack. Even the immemorial demonic beasts struck by those spikes were also blasted away. Several of them had their heads pierced and thus died.

After they were destroyed, their own innate runes would scatter. Sometimes people could even see undamaged, complete runes in their core.

Those complete runes drove the demonic beasts crazy with desire. They went crazy, fighting over those runes. They were even willing to gamble their lives away.

It had to be known that those runes were these Beast Venerates’ innate divine abilities. If the experts here could grasp them, they would have limitless potential. And even if they couldn’t absorb it, by carving it into their souls, perhaps they could use it to peer into the secrets of the immemorial divine arts.

Even if they couldn’t benefit, they could sell that rune for immense wealth. Perhaps they could even exchange it for a divine rune that they could use.

Thus, these runes were priceless treasures that drove them crazy. Because of it, they completely forgot about the threat of death.

“These ancestors are under the control of the heavenly tribulation! They are no longer family. Everyone, kill them and take their runes!” shouted one person taking the lead.

However, people only heard the voice and not the speaker. In the chaos, people thought that it was done by a demonic beast. But it was actually shouted by the hidden Weng Tianhao.

Weng Tianhao was very sinister. He had a heavenly lightning body. And just like Lei Linger, he was hidden within the lightning and void, silently profiting. He occasionally shouted a few words to encourage the demonic beasts.

Also, he intentionally changed his voice. Even his spiritual fluctuations imitated the demonic beast race, so he had the confidence to hide from everyone.

Unfortunately, he had no idea that he had long since been noticed by Jiang Lei. Furthermore, even if Jiang Lei hadn’t noticed him, there was no way that Lei Linger wouldn’t notice him.

Following this reminder, these demonic beasts went even crazier. These inheritance runes were even more important than their lives. If they could obtain one, then even if their race was incompatible with it, they could always exchange it with others.

“Kill!”

Those demonic beasts went crazy. Their manifestations erupted, and their Blood Qis ignited. They no longer held back at all. They went all-out against these terrifying immemorial demonic beasts.

Wielding the Minghong Saber, Long Chen activated his divine ring and his Six Star Battle Armor. He was also in danger right now. Hundreds of immemorial demonic beasts were attacking him. Moreover, Long Chen found that these immemorial demonic beasts were treating him differently. When they attacked others, their attacks weren’t as ferocious. It was only against him that they seemed to go crazy, even willing to self-detonate just to bring him down.

That gave him a bad feeling. It seemed that he had played a bit too overboard this time. He might not be able to take it back. Worst of all, Long Chen sensed that Kun Tu’s aura was crazily rising. This heavenly tribulation was immensely beneficial to him.

“This is no good. You will die in that Kunpeng brat’s hands like this. I’ll teach you the Swallow the Heavens, Devour the Earth divine ability. You have to pass this tribulation.” Suddenly, the dragon expert’s voice rang out in Long Chen’s head.
