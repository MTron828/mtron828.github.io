Chapter 4670 Dishonest Trick

BOOM!

When the blood-colored dragon claw and the golden bone claw collided, the latter’s runes suddenly blazed like a brilliant sun. Its explosive divine power erupted.

Following that, a ripple spread in every direction, causing the void to collapse. With the Grand Dao runes obliterated and spacetime fragments swirling about, the scene resembled an apocalypse.

Luo Changsheng’s golden bone claw bounced back to him, and his expression changed ever so slightly. This probing blow allowed him to sense Long Chen’s true power.

Suddenly, the golden bone claw shrank, wrapping around his left wrist to form a refined golden bracelet, while a blood-colored saber materialized in his right hand.

This saber possessed an uncanny appearance. With a length of nine feet, its shaft and blade each occupied half of its total length. The blade featured a blood-colored notch with a beast-like teeth pattern that exuded a sharp air.

The back of the blade bore nine holes, each with a silver ring on it. Upon collision with the blade, these silver rings emitted a grating sound akin to metal scraping against metal. Instead of a pleasant melody, it was an unsettling noise capable of driving people crazy.

At the sight of this saber, Yue Zifeng unconsciously clenched his sword hilt as his sword will rose. Back then, he had lost to this weapon.

“This saber’s name is Bloodcry, and it does not stop until it sees blood. That brother of yours indeed lost to this saber, but he was able to endure eighteen slashes of my saber. I wonder if his boss can endure for longer?” stated Luo Changsheng as he pointed his saber at Long Chen.

“An insignificant trick is all that saber is,” sneered Long Chen after eyeing the blade.

“We’ll see how long you can maintain that tough facade,” Luo Changsheng snorted, his saber trembling as the silver rings clattered. Like a bolt of lightning, his saber sliced through the air, ignoring the distance between him and Long Chen.

Yue Zifeng was about to shout when this saber fell, but Xia Chen stopped him and said, “Leave it to boss. Your warning will only please that sinister fellow. He might even take that chance to provoke boss again.”

Yue Zifeng nodded at that. Indeed, Luo Changsheng was not only powerful but also skilled in provoking them. When Yue Zifeng had previously lost to Luo Changsheng, it was due to the latter’s manipulation of his mental state. Luo Changsheng had dictated the pace of the battle from the start, resulting in Yue Zifeng’s defeat.

The greatest defense against Luo Changsheng was a tough heart, but everyone in the Dragonblood Legion knew that Long Chen’s emotions could go out of control in combat. Hence, Yue Zifeng worried that Long Chen would fall for Luo Changsheng’s trap.

As the nine silver rings clacked against the back of the saber, the sound they emitted was like the hissing of devils, the roaring of gods, or the crying of ghosts. It was a sound that seemed to penetrate the soul, instilling a sense of dread. Even from outside of the tribulation, countless people were unable to endure it. They just covered their ears and screamed.

However, covering their ears did nothing to block out the sound. It seemed to bypass the physical senses and directly invade the soul. Those without strong enough wills would witness the most terrifying scenes in their hearts when they heard it.

Even the experts outside were so badly affected, so they couldn’t imagine the kind of effect it was having on Long Chen, who was enduring the main force of the attack.

“Nothing more than a dishonest trick,” Long Chen sneered. At this moment, he had fully recovered, and blood-colored scales covered his hand.

BOOM!

An ear-splitting sound erupted as Long Chen caught the saber firmly in his hand. Immediately, the quivers of the saber and the clacking of the rings stopped, causing the world to fall into silence.

“I already said that such things are worthless. Indeed, you can infuriate Zifeng and I. I admit that my mental realm is not as steady as Yue Zifeng’s, but there is one thing different about us...” Long Chen’s voice echoed throughout the air. With the cacophonous sound of the rings gone, his voice was like a powerful drum piercing people’s ears.

“When he is angry, he thinks about how to defeat you. But I’m different. When I’m angry, I think of what method to use to kill you.”

Long Chen’s voice was ice-cold, devoid of any hot rage. However, those familiar with Long Chen knew the calmer he was, the more intense his rage brewed.

“As usual, you only say big words. Take care to not choke on them. A person who can kill me, Luo Changsheng, has yet to be born!” remarked Luo Changsheng as he swung his left hand. With his saber caught in Long Chen’s grasp, he used his golden bone claw instead.

The scheming Luo Changsheng was getting increasingly angry at Long Chen’s high and mighty attitude. The golden bone claw went straight for Long Chen’s heart. As they were very close now, his attack reached Long Chen almost instantaneously.

Upon collision, sparks flew and an ear-piercing sound erupted, causing countless people to clutch their heads in agony and scream in pain.

Long Chen had used Luo Changsheng’s saber to block his golden bone claw. The moment these two divine weapons clashed, the soundwave they unleashed was like an invisible sword stabbing into everyone’s souls.

Long Chen also hadn’t expected these two divine weapons to have such an effect, and he instantly had a bad feeling. With his senses severely impaired, he could neither see nor hear well.

Seizing this opportunity, Luo Changsheng unleashed a relentless barrage of attacks with his saber and claw.

Fortunately, even after losing his senses, Long Chen didn’t panic. His fists moved with precision, causing qi waves to erupt with each clash. Despite being pushed back several steps, Long Chen continued to exchange blows with Luo Changsheng.

In the blink of an eye, Long Chen and Luo Changsheng had exchanged hundreds of blows. But in the end, Long Chen forced him back.

When Luo Changsheng flew back, his eyes blazed with light, fixed on Long Chen like a devil beast eyeing its prey.

“Not bad! Even after losing your senses, you could rely on your instincts to block my attacks! You are qualified to be my opponent!” exclaimed Luo Changsheng, his battle intent rising. As a prideful existence accustomed to being undefeated within the same realm, he found it challenging to encounter other peak experts. Thus far, the only opponent who could challenge him was Yue Zifeng.

However, even he could easily beat Yue Zifeng after he shattered the latter’s mental realm. Compared to using sheer power to crush his opponents, he preferred to use mental attacks. He liked the feeling of having his enemies dancing in his palm. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

So, the moment he saw Long Chen, he could tell that Long Chen’s mental realm was far from matching Yue Zifeng’s steadiness, which was why he had never viewed Long Chen as a real opponent.

But now, he found that this fatal weakness wasn’t actually as fatal as he had thought.

When someone’s senses were severely impaired, fear and panic would usually overwhelm them completely. Just now, Luo Changsheng’s attacks should have been lethal, enough to kill a seasoned expert a hundred times over. Yet Long Chen had flawlessly blocked them all, leaving Luo Changsheng stunned. Long Chen’s battle instincts were indeed incredible.

“On the other hand, you aren’t qualified to be my opponent. In my eyes, you are nothing more than the worst trash,” retorted Long Chen.

Just then, the tribulation cloud in the sky tore apart, unveiling the body of the giant dragon amidst the sea of lightning. As it emerged, a berserk pressure crashed down on the world.
