Chapter 2195 No One Can Stop Him

Dongfang Yuyang had summoned the Dongfang family’s treasure, the Astral Ancient Castle. The giant castle immediately lit up, and the formation at the heart of the castle unleashed a wave of light.

This castle was a battle fort that had only been used during the most intense battles of history. That was because the cost of using it was too great.

Although Dongfang Yuyang had used it before, he had only utilized some of its simple functions. But now, he was activating its true defense, which came at a huge cost.

BOOM!

Long Chen’s saber struck the ancient castle, causing ripples to spread in every direction. Even the people in the distance felt suffocated in the face of that pressure.

The ground cracked in every direction. However, Long Chen’s attack was unable to damage the ancient castle.

“Boss, this ancient castle has countless formations supporting it and an endless source of energy. You can’t break it,” messaged Xia Chen.

This battle fort was used for large-scale battles. Hence, there was a huge amount of energy stored inside it. Without exhausting all that energy, it would not break.

“Then I’ll hit it until it breaks.”

Long Chen slashed his saber once more. Just from Dongfang Yuyang and the other experts of the Dongfang family’s pained expressions, he could tell that the cost of using this ancient castle was extremely high.

BOOM!

Once more, his attack was unable to cause any damage.

He had barely unleashed his attack when Kun Pengzi’s sharp attack came from the side.

“Scram!” Long Chen slashed Evilmoon to the side, sending Kun Pengzi flying. Kun Pengzi was appalled by Long Chen’s destructive power. Just that one swing caused him to almost cough up blood.

“How could this happen?! I’ve awakened an inherited heavens’ soul manifestation! How am I still unable to defeat him?!” Kun Pengzi was gloomy-faced.

When he had attacked the Cloud Chasing Heaven Swallowing Sparrow race, Long Chen hadn’t been a match for him. If Mo Nian hadn’t been there, he would have had absolute confidence in killing Long Chen. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

However, now? He was unable to even receive a single blow from Long Chen. This made no sense.

“Corrupt God Gaze!”

Tian Xiezi formed hand seals in the sky, and the Corrupt God image within his manifestation unleashed a ray of light from its eyes.

Long Chen’s heart shook. Lightning wings spread on his back, and he dodged.

That ray of light pierced through the ground, and the earth rapidly turned black. The stone walls from Shi Lingfeng that had been destroyed now began to rot.

“What a terrifying curse energy.” Long Chen was stunned. This was a curse containing divine energy. Touching it meant death.

“Get out of my way! Long Chen’s life is mine.”

Suddenly, a furious roar rang out. A man with six horns on his head charged over, his bone trident slamming toward Long Chen.

This expert of the Six Horn Sea Serpent race had finally woken, and a divine ring had appeared behind his back. However, this divine ring was a reflection of the Martial Heaven Sea-Ring. A huge amount of power surged into him.

“Sea-Ring Buries All Life!”

When he shouted the name of his manifestation, the world shuddered. The Martial Heaven Sea-Ring surged with angry waves.

All the disciples were shocked by this power. It was no wonder their seniors had told them not to become enemies with the sea demon race.

With the manifestation of the Martial Heaven Sea-Ring, this Six Horn Sea Serpent’s young king seemed to be able to control the entire sea by himself. This was a power that sparked despair.

BOOM!

The six-horned man crashed into Long Chen. Their two divine rings shuddered, with heaven and earth resonating. Their immense power caused the stars in the sky to shudder.

Fragments of spacetime flew out as the laws of the world were shattered. The people outside were no longer able to see what was happening inside.

“Their power is already capable of affecting spacetime. That’s... just terrifying,” sighed one of the seniors.

“That Six Horn Sea Serpent should be a young king of his race. All the Martial Heaven Sea-Ring’s karmic luck is probably supporting him. It’s no wonder none of the seniors of the sea demon race came. They have absolute confidence in him. And most terrifying of all, he will only continue to grow stronger.”

“But Long Chen’s not weaker than him. He’s actually able to fight against him. In comparison, the others seem inferior.”

After sensing the immense power possessed by Long Chen and the horned man, it was clear that Dongfang Yuyang, Tian Xiezi, Kun Pengzi, and Shi Lingfeng had been pushed aside.

The center of the battlefield began to sink while the surrounding land was rising. The terrain was completely transformed by their power. This was a world-destroying battle.

Suddenly, an intense explosion unleashed two counterimposing blazes of light that split the world in two. Long Chen and the horned man appeared on opposite ends.

Long Chen rested Evilmoon on his shoulder and slowly floated into the air. His divine ring shook, and stars circulated in his eyes.

The horned man was truly very powerful. His power was practically endless. But Long Chen’s battle intent only grew against a powerful opponent.

The horned man also looked to be full of battle intent. He was a king amongst the sea demon race, a leader of the entire Martial Heaven Sea-Ring. He had never encountered someone who was a match for him.

However, today, he had been slapped in the face twice as soon as he stepped onto the continent, filling him with rage.

“Die!”

Suddenly, the six horns on his head lit up at the same time. His Blood Qi ignited, and specks of starry light appeared within the sea-ring behind him.

Following that, a strange image appeared within the sea-ring, and bloodline power began to extend throughout the world. After taking a step, his trident pierced forward with a frightening sound.

“You want to rely on external power? Then I won’t stand on courtesy either.” Long Chen could see that the image within the sea-ring was a totem art. It was a secret art of the Six Horn Sea Serpent race to absorb external energy.

Evilmoon’s dragon images lit up, and Long Chen’s originally white scales became infected by its black aura, turning them into alternating black and white.

At the same time, Long Chen’s own Blood Qi rumbled as Evilmoon loaned him its evil dragon energy. After awakening, Evilmoon had completely transformed.

A resounding dragon cry rang out as Long Chen and Evilmoon once more joined forces. They began to clash against the bone trident, unleashing huge ripples with every exchange. Blinding light stabbed people’s eyes.

“Bastard, how can this be?!” The horned man raged, feeling like he was going crazy. With the power of the azure dragon and the evil dragon mixed together, Long Chen’s bloodline power was suppressing him once more.

After activating his Spirit Blood, linking to his manifestation, and having the support of the Martial Heaven Sea-Ring, the horned man had managed to resist the suppression of the Azure Dragon Battle Armor.

However, now with the power of two dragons shooting out of Long Chen’s body, the horned man was getting suppressed again, which made him angry enough to cough up blood.

Evilmoon continued to press down on him. He was feeling weaker. Although he roared furiously, that didn’t change anything. He was constantly forced back.

“Damn you!” The horned man was so furious that veins almost popped on his forehead. As the dragon might suppressed him, his power began to drop. “If you have any ability, put away your dragon pressure and let’s have a real fight!”

“If you have the ability, put away your manifestation and let’s have a real fight!” replied Long Chen.

The horned man almost coughed up blood. Without his manifestation, how was he supposed to fight against Long Chen’s terrifying world energy?

Just at this moment, a lightning halberd shot over. Kun Pengzi was attacking Long Chen from behind.

Long Chen swung his saber, but this time, his arm shook. When he looked more closely, he realized that there were two different Blood Qis coming from Kun Pengzi’s body.

With the power of these two Blood Qis, Kun Pengzi’s manifestation was bestowing him even greater power.

“Two differently colored Blood Qis! Kun Pengzi has condensed a chain of his Spirit Blood to reach through his inherited manifestation and utilize the Peng Emperor’s power!” cried one expert.

“Die!”

Tian Xiezi also attacked. The soul summoning banner appeared, unleashing rays of evil light that slashed at Long Chen like blades. The sound of ghosts wailing stabbed into people’s minds.

Long Chen didn’t dare to face those directly. His lightning wings spread, blocking the light from the soul summoning banner.

Dongfang Yuyang and Shi Lingfeng also attacked. Dongfang Yuyang shouted, “Friend from the Six Horn Sea Serpent race, Long Chen has a natural advantage over you. You can find something else to do if you want.”

The horned man was fuming. With the dragon suppression, he was unable to properly release his full power. Hearing Dongfang Yuyang’s suggestion, he suddenly eyed the Dragonblood Legion.

“That’s good too. I’ll kill his companions and make him depressed.” The horned man abandoned his fight with Long Chen, going straight toward the Dragonblood Legion.
