Chapter 3496

The other two third Heavenstage World Kings were sent flying by that giant spatial blade. The spatial blade’s power was absolutely terrifying. Not only did it destroy their divine weapons, but their bodies also became covered in cracks. They almost lost their physical bodies.

Seeing Long Chen charging over, they turned green. Space was still chaotic, so they couldn’t even use transportation talismans. With no other way out, they both coughed up a mouthful of blood. Blood Qi then wrapped around them, and they transformed into two blood-colored streaks of light that shot off in opposite directions.

These third Heavenstage World Kings actually used the blood evasion art once more. The main thing was that they had no other choice. The spatial blade had gravely wounded them, and they couldn’t fight Long Chen in this state. That would purely be sending themselves to their deaths.

After that, lightning wings appeared on Long Chen’s back, and he shot toward the closer World King. Others only saw a streak of blood-colored light and a streak of lightning chasing. In just a breath’s time, the lightning caught up.

BOOM!

That third Heavenstage World King was ultimately unable to escape Long Chen’s grasp. He was killed in body and spirit.

Long Chen then turned to the direction the other World King had escaped in. He was long gone, so Long Chen slowly sheathed the Minghong Saber. He couldn’t be bothered to chase.

Even if he did catch up, it would be useless. Once that World King left this region, the spatial fluctuations would stabilize, and he could escape with a transportation talisman.

At this time, the black hole that was the remains of the transportation formation slowly closed. It was like a gaping maw that was finally closing. It was this mouth that had almost wiped out the army from the Soaring Dragon Company that had come.

Dozens of World Kings, with three third Heavenstage World Kings. In the end, only one barely managed to escape. The others all died.

Those who witnessed this shocking turn of events finally understood what true terror was, what it meant to be unbound by any law or heaven. This was Boss Long San.

Those people who had had some wicked thoughts for Long Chen found themselves covered in cold sweat. It felt like they had almost lost their lives.

“Who is the city lord?” Long Chen returned to the city.

“The city lord is this old man. May I know what instructions Boss Long San has for me?” A World King stepped forward.

“Here is a trunk of immortal king crystals. It can count as your compensation. It should be enough to repair your transportation formation, right?” Long Chen tossed out a trunk. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

The elder opened it and found ten million immortal king crystals. He was delighted but hastily said, “Just three million is enough…”

“The rest is to treat all the friends within the city to food and drink. This money was stolen anyway, so it doesn’t hurt me to spend it. For disturbing everyone, a bit of food and drink is the least I can do. Everyone, I hope we will meet again in this ever-changing world.” Long Chen cupped his fists toward everyone and transformed into a bolt of lightning, vanishing from sight.

The city lord had originally been worried. The transportation formation was broken, and this money would probably have to come out of the city’s savings. He definitely didn’t dare to ask Long Chen for money.

However, he hadn’t expected Long Chen to toss out ten million immortal king crystals. He was extremely generous, making the city lord form a good opinion of him.

The remaining seven million immortal king crystals were spent just as Long Chen instructed. All the restaurants provided the city’s experts with free food and drink.

It took over ten days to use up all the seven million immortal king crystals. At the same time as they drank and ate, they also praised Long Chen for robbing the rich to feed the poor.

After all, after eating with his money, they wouldn’t feel good to say anything bad about Long Chen. As a result, this robber Long Chen ended up with a good reputation that rapidly spread.

Countless youngsters that had seen Long Chen bragged about how they had seen the legendary Boss Long San, and how Boss Long San had even treated them to a meal. Well, it wasn’t just a meal but food for over a week.

Youngsters were all restless. Once their worship for an expert reached a certain extent, they would start to imitate them.

As a result, overnight, people wearing black robes with sabers on their backs filled the streets. This fad became extremely popular.

“Old fellow, what are you doing? Your beard’s already white. Boss Long San is so handsome and young. Is he a decrepit old man like you?” An elder also joined in the fun, only to be cursed at by others.

“You’re imitating Boss Long San when he’s young, but I’m imitating when he’s old. So what? Don’t like it?” retorted the elder righteously.

Countless experts in black robes and with sabers on their backs pointed out each other’s flaws in their imitation. Quite a few brawls broke out, and blood began to flow endlessly.

As for the Soaring Dragon Company, they were enraged. Such an imitation was essentially a silent slap in their face.

Someone who had stolen the Soaring Dragon Company’s treasury and killed so many of their experts had actually become the idol worshiped by countless youngsters, becoming a target for them to pursue. This was saying that Long Chen’s actions were correct. The Soaring Dragon Company went from the victims to simply people who deserved to be punished.

The Soaring Dragon Company applied pressure on the major powers, but people were allowed to wear whatever they wanted. They couldn’t forcibly restrict the way they dressed.

Under the Soaring Dragon Company’s pressure, the various large sects had no choice but to warn their disciples not to go too far.

However, based on the so-called principle of barefoot people weren’t afraid of those with shoes, there were always rogue cultivators without sects, and they usually had no misgivings. They were still wearing whatever they wanted.

With those rogue cultivators having no misgivings, some sect disciples also decided that they didn’t care about their misgivings. These youngsters could easily end up having their blood rush to their heads. The rather conceited men in particular liked to dress this way because it was this kind of attire that particularly drew the attention of female cultivators.

Although those female cultivators also knew that the people dressing like this were all fakes, they couldn’t help giving them a second glance. What if it really was Boss Long San?

It was this second glance that caused countless male disciples to preen like peacocks. They used Long Chen’s attire to draw the attention of female cultivators.

This attire grew increasingly popular and spread along with the name of Boss Long San.

The Soaring Dragon Company was searching crazily for Long Chen. As for Long Chen, he was still living happily, swaggering through the various large cities and purchasing medicinal ingredients.

The Soaring Dragon Company’s experts had surrounded him several times but had never been able to stop him. When there were too many, he would simply flee. With his speed, others were simply unable to catch him.

If the other side wasn’t much stronger than him, then he would conveniently kill a few. In any case, the one to suffer was always the Soaring Dragon Company. They were helpless to stop Long Chen.

Long Chen was trying to buy the medicinal ingredients for the Violet Tower Pill. But this star-field’s merchants were practically all related to the Soaring Dragon Company. They didn’t sell him anything.

Those merchants hadn’t provoked him, so Long Chen was unable to rob them. Feeling helpless, Long Chen rushed through the Soaring Dragon Company’s strongholds, snatching up their treasuries. They refused to sell to him? Then he would take what he wanted himself.

The entire star-field became chaotic, and the Soaring Dragon Company almost went insane. Long Chen would rip out dozens of their treasuries in just a few days. Their formations were unable to stop him.

On this day, it was said that the Soaring Dragon Company had sent out four terrifying experts, all mid stage World Kings, just to deal with Long Chen.

However, they had just arrived when Long Chen left this star-field. His goal was another place, the Chaotic Star Sea.
