The Heaven Overseer left. When Long Zaiye had tried to leave earlier, the clan leader had scolded him severely. However, the clan leader’s expression didn’t even twitch when the Heaven Overseer, who only had an Earth Saint cultivation base, walked out.

After looking at everyone, the clan leader asked, “The Heaven Overseer has left, but the assembly must continue. Everyone, do you have constructive opinions about Long Chen’s arrival?”

“He should scram or be killed!” said Long Zaiye.

No one paid him any attention. Ignoring him, the clan leader continued to look at everyone else. They were silent for a while before one of them said, “Everyone knows that Long Chen is conceited and uncontrollable. He is also the High Firmament Academy’s branch dean.

“To be honest, I don’t think he’s worth drawing into the Long clan. We already have plenty of heavenly geniuses, including three Heavenly Chosens and seventeen half-step Heavenly Chosens, besides Long Ziwei. Raising them alone is taxing on our resources. Why add another person to feed?

“Moreover, even if we go all out supporting Long Chen now, there's no guarantee he will feel indebted to the Long clan. Will he accept our kindness and abandon the High Firmament Academy to join us?”

Quite a few elders nodded, finding this argument reasonable. They had researched Long Chen’s journey in the Darklight Heaven, Violet Flame Heaven, and other places, and knew he was very loyal to the High Firmament Academy.

Another elder said, “I feel the same way. The High Firmament Academy is one of Brahma Pill Valley’s targets and has been under their constant suppression. If we take in Long Chen, we’ll have to contend with pressure from Brahma Pill Valley. Our relationship with Brahma Pill Valley is decent. We purchase a large number of medicinal pills from them every year to supplement what our own Alchemy Hall lacks. If we offend Brahma Pill Valley and they cut us off from their medicinal pills because we take in Long Chen, that loss would be difficult to accept.”

Other than the Heaven Overseer, everyone else present disliked Long Chen. There was no way around it, as Long Zhantian had caused them to lose face when he charged into the Long clan. Some found it harder to accept than others.

As the discussion continued, other elders started to express their opinions. They pointed out that Long Chen had not sent a message to announce his arrival, indicating he had no intention of joining them. He showed no etiquette, clearly looking down on them.

Some speculated that he might have a hidden agenda. They needed to be cautious and gather more information about him. Perhaps he had come seeking asylum due to offending someone powerful.

Various voices rang out in opposition to letting Long Chen join. Not one person welcomed him. Well, the only one to express that opinion had already left.

The clan leader listened to all their opinions before turning to Long Qihua and the other Heavenly Saints. “What are your thoughts on this matter?”

Long Qihua shook his head. “I have no opinion.”

The second Heavenly Saint, Long Yaoting, also shook his head. “I also have no opinion.”

Declaring they had no opinion meant they were giving up any right to vote for or against Long Chen’s inclusion in the clan. His fate would be decided without their input.

When the clan leader turned to Long Qianxue, she responded indifferently. “I also have no opinion. But I suggest you consult the patriarch for his input.”

“How can we disturb the patriarch over such a minor thing? How laughable. Who does Long Chen think he is?” sneered Long Zaiye.

Long Qianxue turned to Long Zaiye, her expression suddenly turning frosty as she retorted, “Why are you acting like a wild dog? Are you just going to bite anyone? Everyone knew you were in a bad mood, so they ignored you. But if you provoke me, I’ll cut off your remaining arm.”

Long Qianxue was renowned for her cold and indifferent demeanor, seldom engaging in conflicts. However, when she did, she would transform into an icy killing god.

Long Zaiye instantly went mute. Throughout the years, he had never been able to rival her. He had never dared to challenge her for her position.

“I’m not trying to offend you. I just don’t like that brat Long Chen,” mumbled Long Zaiye. Everyone could tell that he was afraid.𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

“That’s enough. Since everyone has given their thoughts, I have come to my decision. You can all leave!” declared the clan leader. After he stood up, everyone was dismissed.

…

Within Mercenary City, Long Chen sat in a rundown plaza, reclining on a broken wall. He stared blankly at the air when Gui Jiu’s excited voice rang out. “Boss, we’ve gathered thirty-seven kinds of medicinal ingredients today.”

Previously, Gui Jiu had addressed Long Chen as “master,” but Long Chen didn’t like that title. So, Gui Jiu sought Long Ziwei’s permission to call Long Chen “boss.”

In the past few days, Gui Jiu had been extremely hardworking. He promptly and meticulously carried out every task assigned by Long Chen.

When Long Chen accepted Gui Jiu’s address as “boss,” Gui Jiu was incredibly excited. Becoming Long Chen’s little brother was no disgrace. In fact, one could argue that by being Long Chen’s little brother, he was on the same level as Long Ziwei.

Today, Gui Jiu had finished tallying up the completed mercenary missions. He immediately ran over to tell Long Chen the good news and deliver the medicinal ingredients.

“However, boss, some of them are a bit damaged. The mercenaries said that they didn’t need the reward…”

When Gui Jiu said this, Long Chen immediately looked at him with furrowed brows. Gui Jiu hastily added, “I followed your instructions precisely and ensured they received the full reward. I didn’t allow them to decline.”

Long Chen’s expression softened, and he took the medicinal ingredients, planting them into the primal chaos space. The damaged part might make these ingredients less appealing to others, but Long Chen didn’t mind such minor defects.

The missions Long Chen had established in Mercenary City offered rewards over ten times the normal rate, driving the mercenaries into a frenzy to complete them.

Given the unique geography of the Heavenly Desolation Domain, it harbored many medicinal ingredients that were nearly nonexistent elsewhere.

Of course, the Long clan had medicinal fields. Hence, they could raise medicinal ingredients themselves, and any of these ingredients weren’t priced that high in this region. Artificially grown medicinal ingredients typically had slightly lower efficacy compared to naturally grown ones, but the disparity wasn’t significant and could be compensated for with quantity. As a result, these medicinal ingredients held relatively little value to the mercenaries.

The Long clan strictly prohibited outside experts from directly purchasing medicinal ingredients from mercenaries. Violators faced severe punishment, as such actions would impact the revenue of the Long clan’s medicinal fields.

As a result, countless mercenaries went crazy for Long Chen’s missions. Several groups would fight over one mission, and whoever got it first would get the reward. If the groups turned the mission in at the same time, as long as the mission had yet to be annulled, they would still receive the full reward. This was like giving them free money.

In just three days, Long Chen had gotten most of the medicinal ingredients on his list. Even he was pleasantly surprised by the swift progress, as the allure of the Nirvana Charge Pill grew stronger by the day.

In terms of wealth, Long Chen wasn’t lacking. Although he didn’t dare compare himself to Mo Nian, who spent his days excavating ancestral tombs, primal chaos spirit stones were no longer as valuable to Long Chen.

At this moment, Long Chen was staring blankly at the air because the Earth Cauldron had told him he needed to take a trip to the Long clan. According to the Earth Cauldron, there was something in the Long clan that he required. Despite feeling a sense of disgust, he was unsure of what to do. His pride did not permit him to lower his head.

“Boss…”

Suddenly, a voice broke the silence. Long Chen and Gui Jiu turned abruptly, startled. They saw a bloodied Long Ziwei approaching them.
