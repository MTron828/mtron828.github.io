Chapter 3677 Traumatized

“Bastards, you goddamn bastards! You dare to plunder my Soaring Dragon Company?! Just wait!”

An expert from the Soaring Dragon Company let out a hysterical cry. They had just been plundered by Long Chen a couple of months ago.

It had been over two months, so they had thought that it was over and they could rebuild, starting over. But then, Xia Chen and Guo Ran once more plundered them.

Seeing the treasures that they had prepared with a great deal of effort be taken away just like this, their hearts were dripping blood. They cursed furiously.

“Fools, we’re only plundering you because we like you! Just be happy that we’re choosing to loot you!” Guo Ran actually returned a disdainful look after snatching their treasury.

“Be happy?!”

That expert almost passed out from anger. He pointed at Xia Chen and Guo Ran, howling, “If you have guts, report your names!”

“Nope. I’d rather piss you off!” Guo Ran was just about to say his little verse when Xia Chen dragged him away.

After all, they wanted to keep harvesting this plump harvest. If they knew that Long Chen had returned to the Chaotic Star Sea, the other strongholds of the Soaring Dragon Company would immediately move their treasuries.

If they didn’t say who they were, perhaps the Soaring Dragon Company would get to harvest some more treasures for them. But if their status was exposed, this harvest would be gone.

“Just wait, our Soaring Dragon Company isn’t so easy to bully!” shouted that expert.

Regretfully, a little third Heavenstage World King was unable to retaliate in front of Guo Ran and XIa Chen. He could only watch as the two of them laughed and took their treasury.

They continued on their way, looting what they could. But on the eighth stronghold, they ended up with nothing. Then they continued to end up empty.

Clearly, the Soaring Dragon Company wasn’t so foolish as to just let them continue plundering. They moved away their treasuries, not giving Long Chen and the others a chance to plunder them.

Not only did Guo Ran and Xia Chen end up with nothing, but there were also experts lying in wait for them. However, those experts were nothing more than mid stage World Kings, and they were powerless to do anything to them.

As a result, Xia Chen and Guo Ran also entered the Soaring Dragon Company’s wanted list. This was the new big news to strike the Chaotic Star Sea after Long Chen.

People found it shocking but also funny. Before this, Long Chen had practically swept through the entire Chaotic Star Sea plundering the Soaring Dragon Company.

That wave had just passed and they hadn’t even caught Long Chen. But just as things calmed down and Long Chen left, the Soaring Dragon Company’s new stuff was stolen by these two bandits. Just what kind of calamity had the Soaring Dragon Company provoked?

“They’re now too scared of being looted. Stop wasting the effort. Let’s go to the Huayun Trading Company.” Long Chen knew that the Soaring Dragon Company would be too scared, and he wouldn’t get any ill-gotten gains during this time.

Through multiple transportations, they directly arrived at the Yu Prefecture. The Yu Prefecture could be said to be the safest prefecture within the Chaotic Star Sea, as well as the most prosperous prefecture.

That was because the Yu Prefecture was overseen by the Huayun Trading Company, so it was the safest place in the Chaotic Star Sea. Long Chen went directly to the headquarters of the Huayun Trading Company.

“Haha, president Qi Fang, it’s been a long time. Your grace and beauty only continue to grow!” Long Chen greeted Qi Fang with a laugh. He felt particularly close with the Huayun Trading Company’s people. He could have no misgivings while talking to them.

“Mister Long Chen is praising me. An old woman like me? You’re making flowers bloom in my heart. Last time, mister Long Chen left without a word, so I've been worried about you. How have you been?” asked Qi Fang with a smile.

“I suppose I’ve been alright. Thanks to your blessing, I’ve managed to make a bit of wealth. I’m preparing to sell this loot- I mean, this wealth here,” said Long Chen.

Although Qi Fang also knew that the things in Long Chen’s hands were not obtained through proper channels, in the end, the Huayun Trading Company was a business with its own reputation. He couldn’t directly say that he was disposing of stolen goods.

Long Chen then introduced Guo Ran and Xia Chen to Qi Fang. He also had them give a list of what they urgently needed at this time.

After that, they handed over all the treasures that they had plundered during this time, only leaving what they needed for their research. They had a clearance sale of everything else.

Qi Fang had previously helped Long Chen do the same thing and had experience in this regard. Hence, she didn’t say anything about it. She simply smiled and had people take an inventory of the loot. She also gave orders for her people to help gather the things on their lists.

Gathering all of those treasures would probably take some time. So, Long Chen bade her farewell and brought the two of them to the Wine God Palace.

When they arrived at the Wine God Palace and saw the sign board on top of the gate, Guo Ran and Xia Chen both sighed. It was a sigh of recollection.

“I wonder how everyone is!” Guo Ran looked at the Wine God Palace and thought of the Martial Heaven Continent. When he thought of his family, his eyes reddened. Xia Chen was the same.

“Don’t worry, they’re definitely doing better than us. Once us brothers reach the peak, we can reunite with everyone. At that time, this world will have no more battles, no more grief.” Long Chen patted their shoulders.

The two of them nodded. They had heard that Long Chen had seen the Martial Heaven Continent’s people alive. They were in a new world, a world better than the Martial Heaven Continent.

Upon entering the Wine God Palace, Long Chen felt like he had returned to his own home. He smiled and waved at the Wine God Palace’s disciples, introducing them to his brothers.

When these disciples greeted them enthusiastically, Guo Ran and Xia Chen both felt warm.

The Wine God Palace’s enthusiasm toward them was sincere, and these disciples’ gazes were pure. They wouldn’t look down on them due to cultivation base, status, or background.

It was as if their eyes could see through a person’s inner heart. They were people with magnanimous hearts. Sometimes, a single gaze could convey everything.

This place was far away from the immortal world’s fighting. It was a pure land where people could put down their defenses. They could be free and at ease. That feeling was incredibly rare, so Xia Chen and Guo Ran instantly fell in love with this place, wishing to stay a lifetime here.

Quite a few disciples immediately came to drag them away to appraise wine. They knew that Long Chen didn’t know how to make wine, yet he was an expert at tasting wine. But Long Chen tactfully declined all of them with his thanks.

“Brother Long Chen, you’ve finally arrived. If you still didn’t come, I’d have been forced to go find you. Something major is coming. It’s a huge opportunity, and if you miss it, you’ll regret it for a lifetime.”

Before Long Chen arrived at Xia Guhong’s abode, Xia Guhong’s voice already rang out. He had long since been waiting for them at his door.RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only
