Chapter 1681 Let Me Send You On Your Way

Translator: BornToBe

“Everyone, don’t be afraid! He’s just trying to scare-”

A rank nine Celestial was in the midst of shouting when a black light pierced his head, instantly killing him.

“Idiot, in all my years of following boss, I’ve never seen him trying to scare people,” sneered Guo Ran. He was the one who had killed the rank nine Celestial.

However, he was so fast that no one even saw him move before that person was dead.

Following Long Chen’s shout, the Xuantian Dao Sect’s disciples charged out, excluding the Dragonblood Legion. They were like a flood slaughtering those experts. These were the elites of the Xuantian Dao Sect, and their opponents weren’t even a match for them.

Five Empyreans flew out from the Xuantian Dao Sect, fighting the Empyreans of the other side. In a one against one, they fought evenly.

The other Empyreans of the Xuantian Dao Sect didn’t fight. They were standing beside Long Chen. They didn’t want to attack the other experts, and they didn’t want to gang up on the opposing Empyreans. Even if they won, it would be meaningless.

“Haha, Long Chen, you’ve done it this time! You and your Xuantian Dao Sect have nowhere to run now! Just wait to be destroyed!” laughed the rank nine Celestial with the talisman in his hand.

After laughing, he immediately crushed his talisman. His body rapidly faded and intense spatial fluctuations appeared, showing that it was clearly a teleportation talisman.

“Bastard, you tricked us!” shouted quite a few experts in fury.

However, just as the rank nine Celestial was about to vanish, space twisted again, and his body, which had almost vanished, reappeared.

“What?! What’s going on?!” That rank nine Celestial’s smile vanished, replaced with horror.

“I said that this teleportation talisman of yours wouldn’t be able to protect your life. Now, do you believe me?” Long Chen looked at the shocked Celestial indifferently. “Your plan was to dupe a bunch of idiots into provoking me so that I kill them, and then that Pill Valley, the ancient races, the ancient family alliance, and the Xuan Beasts would have a justifiable reason to kill me and destroy the Xuantian Dao Sect. I really suspect whether you people even have a brain. Do you think others are as stupid as you?”

The rank nine Celestail’s head flew into the air. He had no idea how his talisman had failed. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

“I really hate these kinds of bastards.”

Tang Wan-er’s hands came out of a seal. Just now, she had used a magical art to seal the space around the rank nine Celestial and prevent him from fleeing with his talisman.

She had obtained the wind inheritance of the Jade Lake Sacred Land. Her wind energy could now be silent and almost motionless, creeping up on someone without them even noticing. That rank nine Celestial hadn’t even noticed that he was already within the domain of Tang Wan-er’s magical art.

The rank nine Celestial’s head exploded in midair, showering those below him with blood. Tang Wan-er’s silent, invisible energy gave others goosebumps.

“Long Chen, we were tricked! We don’t want to be enemies with you! Please, let us go!”

Seeing the situation immediately turn on them, people began to beg for mercy.

Up in the sky, ten Empyreans were fighting an intense battle. Neither side was able to get an advantage over the other. However, there were still so many Empyreans on the side of the Xuantian Dao Sect that hadn’t done anything yet, as well as Long Chen’s Dragonblood Legion. They were all just indifferently watching them, as if they were in complete control over the situation.

The ones attacking were just the disciples of the Xuantian Dao Sect, but even they were too strong for this mob of people. How could a mob of random disciples from various regions be able to block the attack of the elites of the Xuantian Dao Sect?

In just a few breaths’ time, tens of thousands of experts were slain. In front of the Xuantian Dao Sect’s elites, they didn’t have the slightest ability to resist.

In the distance, over three thousand people were watching. They were both rejoiceful as well as filled with lingering fear. Their guts had been comparatively smaller and they had fled before Long Chen’s incense stick was up.

Originally, there had been over ten thousand of them to flee, but a portion came back due to the conning of others.

The choice to flee while they could, had saved these people’s lives. Seeing the Xuantian Dao Sect’s experts cut down their opponents so easily gave them chills.

Their numbers constantly dwindled. They despaired. Long Chen was only watching them indifferently, completely unmoved by their pleading.

“Long Chen, you slaughterer, a bloodthirsty fiend like you isn’t even human! We’re innocent! Just wait, even in death, we’ll become ghouls that haunt you for eternity!” cursed one disciple upon seeing that they couldn’t escape.

Long Chen glanced at that person lightly. “You’re innocent? Do you even believe your own lie? You insulted me, the Xuantian Dao Sect, and every single one of our disciples. What, did you not realize that you were fed lies? Does that make you free from the responsibility of your own actions? Fine, then after we kill you, I’ll also apologize to you by saying sorry, I had no idea you were innocent at the time.”

“But you know we’re innocent right now! Why do you have to kill-?!” Another disciple roared, but before he could finish speaking, his head was severed from the rest of his body.

“Right now, I really don’t know if you are innocent or not. If I let you off this time, who knows whether you’ll be duped again and used against me? In my eyes, you are a weapon aiming to harm my Xuantian Dao Sect, so there’s no such thing as innocent or not.” Long Chen shook his head.

“No! I don’t want to die!”

“Don’t kill me!”

“I surrender!”

Death cries rang out one by one, but none of these cries could stop the fury of the Xuantian Dao Sect’s disciples.

“Fuck, you cursed us so happily while blocking our gate. You even included our fathers, mothers, wives. You can all die, cowards!”

After having to endure these people’s cursing for so long, they had long since been filled with fury. A supreme sect like the Xuantian Dao Sect had actually had a bunch of trash come to their gates and curse them. They definitely wouldn’t have mercy.

In fact, some of them even began to pick up the pace for fear that Long Chen would accept their surrender. Just a dozen breaths’ later, all the experts were slain. They had really killed them all.

“Refreshing, so refreshing!” The Xuantian Dao Sect’s disciples all had excited expressions. Their bellies full of fire had finally been released.

BOOM!

Suddenly, a divine item shook the sky. A woman holding a sword forced her opponent back.

“Long Chen, I really admire you. You really are just as bloody and domineering as the stories. Regretfully, you’ve signed your death warrant. So sorry, but since my mission is complete, I won’t accompany you any longer.”

The woman took out a jade plate and crushed it. A large spatial channel appeared in the sky, and she stepped into it.

This spatial channel was gigantic and formed with its own spatial barrier. It was much more difficult for external power to damage it. In fact, the fluctuations coming from it showed that it was connected to her divine item. There were also other divine fluctuations.

Clearly, this was a channel formed through two divine items, the one she was holding and one on the other side. As long as she entered, she would appear where the other divine item was. Perhaps that place was her sect.

“If you left just like this, it would make the Xuantian Dao Sect appear rude. Let me send you on your way.”

Yue Zifeng suddenly stepped forward. His sword came out of its sheath, and without even seeing his sword, people felt like the world had suddenly been cut in two.

The spatial channel exploded. A flash of light fell, and that woman only had time to let out a startled cry before she was killed. Not even her Yuan Spirit managed to flee.

This sword came without any warning. It hadn’t had any fluctuations and had struck like lightning. Both friends and foes were stunned by this one attack.

Yue Zifeng’s sword slowly returned to his sheath. It was like a quiet dragon cry, and it sounded like two cries on top of each other.

“The sound of his sword coming out and going in came at practically the same time. Has his sword already broken the restrictions of time? Otherwise, how could such a thing happen?!” All the Empyreans present were completely shocked. This attack had been absolutely bizarre. If Yue Zifeng wanted to kill any of them, just how would they resist?

Such a terrifying speed and killing power didn’t allow others to react. They could only wait for their own death just like that woman. It was an attack that created despair.

Meng Qi, Chu Yao, Tang Wan-er, and Liu Ruyan exchanged a look. Just as Long Chen had said, Yue Zifeng had abandoned defensive power to obtain the highest offensive might.

Such a sharp sword was practically impossible to block. This was using offense instead of defense.

That woman was slain, and her divine sword transformed into a ray of light that instantly fled.

The remaining four Empyreans’ expressions changed. They also forced back their own opponents, preparing to summon their own methods of escape.

Suddenly, a golden spear appeared in the sky, emitting blazing light. It pierced toward one of the Empyreans.
