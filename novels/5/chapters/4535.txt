Chapter 4524 Mixed Beast Race

“KILL!”

The experts of the Heavenly Corrupt Sect unleashed thunderous roars, their eyes ablaze with scarlet intensity as a sinister aura erupted from within them. It felt like they were possessed by some strange power. Their fear was no more, replaced by a berserk and unbridled desire to kill.

“This should be a utilization of faith energy. That red-haired man really isn’t ordinary,” murmured Long Chen.

Even the sect master was polite and careful when speaking to him, so his status had to be extraordinary.

Although Long Chen didn’t hear what they were talking about, based on their expressions, it was most likely about how this red-haired man would be leading the Heavenly Corrupt Sect’s army against this opposing force. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

The sect master seemed more conservative. With a troublemaker like Long Chen in their territory, he didn’t think it was a good idea to make a bold move at this time.

However, the red-haired man had acted first, summoning the army of the Heavenly Corrupt Sect without hesitation. The sect master wanted to change his mind, but the red-haired man’s stubbornness left the sect master with no means to dissuade him.

The red-haired man’s aura was truly astonishing, giving Long Chen a sense of immense pressure. It was as if a formidable beast lay dormant within the red-haired man.

Their army was endless, but only the sect master and the red-haired man possessed the ability to instill a genuine sense of mortal peril in Long Chen.

Seeing this huge army, Long Chen had the urge to mix in with them. However, all of them had a layer of faith energy around them. So, if he were to sneak his way into the midst, he’d be instantly exposed.

The wasteland in front of them quickly changed, becoming red with a discernible scent of blood permeating the air.

It seemed that they had been fighting each other for a long time, turning this area into their repeated battleground where resentment had accumulated.

Long Chen followed from the rear, suppressing his aura. He only came to watch, and it would be over for him if he was exposed.

In truth, Long Chen felt very conflicted at the moment. The Heavenly Corrupt Sect was fighting one of their mortal enemies, presenting an exceptionally rare chance for Long Chen to conduct some robbery.

Yet, Long Chen harbored skepticism that it would be as straightforward as it seemed. What he could think of, the Heavenly Corrupt Sect could likely anticipate as well. They had probably hidden their treasures, and he wouldn’t necessarily be able to find them in time.

Even if he found them, there would be layers of mechanisms protecting them. Without Xia Chen and Guo Ran by his side, he didn’t have a chance to plunder them.

Killing some little fish and picking up some leftovers? He wasn’t interested in that. In the end, he chose to grit his teeth and follow behind them.

Distant roars echoed, their origins sounding neither human nor beast. These eerie voices were extremely strange and possessed boundless killing intent.

As the Heavenly Corrupt Sect’s army advanced, dust flew into the air from their opposing side, covering the sky. One figure after another appeared within that dust.

When Long Chen saw those figures, he jumped in shock. These beings were hybrids—half-beast lifeforms. Some featured beast heads atop human bodies, while others displayed human heads atop beast bodies. There were those split between their upper and lower halves, and even others with human features on one side and beastly attributes on the other.

Among the beings, some were in human forms but bore strange beast marks on their foreheads. Additionally, there were others with beastly bodies that featured a human form on their foreheads, resembling the merged appearance of Bai Xiaole and Little Nine.

“Damn Corrupt seeds, you’ve repeatedly provoked us. Do you think that the mixed beast race is easy to bully? Today, there shall be no more running! We will fight to the death!”

A mighty roar came from the other side. Their leader, a Berserk Vajra Ape wielding a bone club, stood an imposing three hundred meters tall. Its entire golden body radiated strength, and on its forehead, a white-haired elder with a furious expression could be seen, though the voice emanated from the ape’s mouth.

“Another Sage King! This Berserk Vajra Ape seemed to be a pureblood immemorial demonic beast!”

Long Chen’s heart quivered. This elder wasn’t simple at all; even the demonic beast he had merged with was a terrifying Sage King.

“Those who don’t believe in the Corrupt God are fated to be executed. You’ll be able to sleep soundly soon. Let us fight to the death!”

As the sect master shouted, an enormous statue appeared behind him. Long Chen’s heart shook once again. It bore a striking resemblance to the statue worshiped by the Corrupt Path in the Martial Heaven Continent.

“Good! Then we will settle things once and for all today!” roared the mixed beast race’s elder. The Berserk Vajra Ape beneath his feet then raised its head and roared as well, beating its chest with its fists.

Its drumming was like a heavenly drum that unleashed thunder and shook the world. With every beat, its aura grew.

The sect master seemed familiar with its technique. Without further delay, he swiftly formed hand seals, causing the head of the Corrupt God’s statue to illuminate.

Buzz.

In an instant, the sect master and the Berserk Vajra Ape vanished from this battlefield. Although the two strongest combatants had left, the Heavenly Corrupt Sect or the mixed beast race seemed indifferent to this development and continued to charge forward crazily.

Long Chen knew that they were old opponents. This was a battle of soldiers against soldiers, generals against generals. Hence, the two Sage Kings had switched locations to not affect the others.

After all, once the battle was over, the winner still had to continue surviving. If two Sage Kings were to fight on this battlefield, all that would remain in the end would be the two Sage Kings.

Even if a clear victor emerged between them, he would have lost everything, and both sides would be losers in the end. Thus, in many battles, the most powerful experts chose to fight away from the main forces.

“Kill!”

The two armies finally clashed, resonating with furious roars that shook the heavens. A chaotic battle ensued, marked by ruthless and deadly exchanges on both sides.

Flesh and blood flew through the air, driving everyone into a frenzy. After all, the scent of blood triggered their most primitive and primal desires.

BOOM!

A giant scythe swept through the air, resembling a crescent moon that ruthlessly bisected all the mixed beast experts caught within its path. It left an arc etched into the ground.

The red-haired man finally made his move. This seemingly simple move annihilated hundreds of the mixed beast race’s Doyens, and these were no ordinary Doyens—they were elite members among their ranks.

“That scythe is really strange!”

Long Chen had been keeping a constant eye on this man, scrutinizing every single one of his movements. The moment the scythe swung through the air, a blood-colored light appeared on its edge.

The light was not from the red-haired man’s power but from the scythe itself. Amongst all the experts vanquished by the red-haired man, one Doyen proved to be as strong as the Lifehunter expert Long Chen had previously slain.

However, to Long Chen’s surprise, when this scythe struck, that powerful Doyen quivered and went stiff. He found himself unable to dodge that attack and could only watch as it severed him in two.

This attack was truly bizarre, so bizarre that it sent shivers down Long Chen’s back. Other than the red-haired man and the Doyens he had just slain, no one else knew what had just happened.

Just then, the red-haired man raised his scythe once more. The void exploded, and a black spear thrust toward his head.

“The mixed beast race’s young king has also appeared!” murmured Long Chen.
