Chapter 3205 Deep Sea Crocodile Bull

“Prepare for battle!”

Luo Changwu shouted. The experts in the midst of cleaning up the battlefield and taking over immediately retreated from the front lines, all their weapons appearing in their hands.

“Long Chen, I didn’t expect the sea demons to attack twice this time, so I can’t accompany you. I have to direct the battle,” said Luo Changwu.

“Of course, senior is busy. I also want to experience just how powerful the sea demons of the devil sea are,” said Long Chen. He wanted these corpses, but now wasn’t the time for such a thing.

“I’ll take my leave. Xue-er, make sure to treat our important guests properly,” ordered Luo Changwu, flying off to a distant tower.

That was the commander tower, the core of the battlefield. Not only could he see the entire battlefield from there, but there were even formations that allowed him to see deep into the sea. That way, he could gain information ahead of time.

The sound of the alarm also came from there. This alarm prevented the sea demons from catching them off-guard. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

“Every time I see this kind of scene, I feel my blood heating up,” said Qin Feng emotionally. Millions of experts were getting into position.

“You really are real heroes. You’re not nervous in the face of such a large battle at all,” praised Luo Xue. Whether it was Long Chen or Qin Feng, they all possessed a fanaticism toward battle. It seemed that they never feared any battle.

“I’m not a hero. I’m just following boss. If I’m not in battle, I’m on the way to battle. I’m already used to it. Every time I see something like this, I want to charge to the front,” said Qin Feng with a bitter smile.

Just then, the calm water began to ripple. In the distance, giant waves began to soar. It was like a giant wall of water was crashing toward them.

When they saw that, countless expressions changed and Luo Xue was also shocked. “For the waves to be so big, this attack is probably over ten times larger than the last attack.”

After fighting the sea demons for so long, they managed to grasp a general pattern. The size of the waves generally corresponded to the scale of the attack the sea demons were launching.

“Damnable Chu family, what did they do to make the sea demons suddenly start attacking us?!” At this time, Luo Qing also came over. She spoke hatefully.

Although the Luo family bordered the devil sea and often had to deal with sea demons coming onto the shore, the scale was never so big.

However, just over half a month ago the Luo family’s disciples discovered the tracks of the Chu family in the surroundings. They then immediately got a bad feeling.

As expected, the very next day, a huge number of sea demons started attacking the Ying Prefecture. All the sects of the Ying Prefecture, under the guidance of the three major forces, joined hands to resist the sea demons.

There had been over a hundred million people injured in this half month, and over ten thousand deaths. Furthermore, the Sheng Prefecture’s Chu family also began to assemble, seemingly wanting to take advantage of the sea demons’ attack.

As a result, the Luo family’s forces were diverted to two sides, one side blocking the sea demons, and the other side to guard against the Chu family. With their power diverted, they were much weaker.

Fortunately, the Luo family had a great deal of prestige within the Ying Prefecture. The various large powers didn’t participate in the personal enmity between the Luo family and the Chu family, but they sent out their elite experts to handle the sea demons.

The Luo family also sent over a large number of experts to lead the troops of the large powers. They guarded a long defensive line. If the sea demons broke through this defense, they would kill countless innocent commoners.

Suddenly, the seawater in the distance exploded and giant sea demons larger than mountains came out. The front half of them looked like a bull, but they had a long crocodile tail behind them. Their horns flickered with silver light. They were all fourth rank sea demons.

Fourth rank sea demons were roughly equivalent to the human race’s Divine Lord realm. But that was only in terms of cultivation base. They possessed immense power and tough defenses. In a one against one, if they were fighting in the sea, humans definitely wouldn’t be a match for them.

However, on land, these water element lifeforms definitely faced a certain restriction. Adding on that sea demons were ultimately demonic beasts with low intelligence, the human race had quite an advantage.

Despite that, to see millions of Divine Lord-level sea demons appear out of the water at once was a frightening sight. Just the sight alone gave them immense pressure.

“Deep Sea Crocodile bulls. This is bad.” Luo Xue’s expression changed.

This kind of sea demon possessed powerful scales and immense power. If the Divine Lords focused on fighting, then the countless sea demons behind them would fall upon them, and if they weren’t careful, they could be eaten.

If they used the large-scale equipment that they had, although their attacks were sharp, using them was very expensive. The price for such a thing was not easy to accept.

It wasn’t just the crossbow bolts that were expensive. Even the crossbows themselves could only shoot ten large scale bolts before they needed their runes to be reinscribed. It was a laborious and expensive task.

Just then, hundreds of crossbows lit up. Their bolts shone with cold light. Clearly, in the face of these sea demons, human lives were more important. They could only endure the pain of paying such a price. After all, every Divine Lord was important to the defenses of the Ying Prefecture. They were the foundation and couldn’t be lost.

“Boss, let’s charge in as well.”

Qin Feng was eager to join in. Every Dragonblood warrior had the same warlike blood flowing in their veins.

However, Long Chen shook his head. “In a battle of this scale, the rhythm must be controlled. If the rhythm is broken, countless lives will be lost. In such a large battle, an individual’s power is miniscule. They have to listen to orders to prevent more losses. Unless you can block all the sea demons on your own, it would be best not to ruin the tempo here.”

With Qin Feng’s power, he didn’t fear these sea demons. The Dragonblood warriors were experienced, and even on his own, he had the power to protect himself even if he was surrounded by these sea demons.

However, if Qin Feng did go forward, then the crossbows wouldn’t be able to be unleashed. The hesitation caused by his sudden action would affect the entire strategy.

It didn’t matter that Qin Feng was powerful. In the end, he was still young, and youngsters all liked to show off, especially in front of millions of experts. But now wasn’t the time.

Hundreds of crossbows shot out giant bolts that tore through those Deep Sea Crocodile Bulls. Long Chen was surprised to see them explode once the bolts pierced their bodies, unleashing a rain of blood.

After the explosion, their fragments shot out and also damaged the nearby targets. A single giant bolt possessed immense power.

The Deep Sea Crocodile Bulls collapsed rapidly, but very quickly, the hundreds of crossbows grew dim. They had to be repaired before they could shoot more ammunition.

Just then, Luo Xue’s status plate lit up. At the same time, countless experts charged toward the rest of the sea demons.

“Senior apprentice-brother Long Chen, the commander has ordered Divine Lords and Four Peak Primals to attack. Do you want to come along?” asked Luo Xue.
