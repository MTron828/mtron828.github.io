Chapter 4045 I Will Save My Woman

Those figures were clad in odd clothes, a mix of men and women. Strangely, their clothes seemed to be in a state of constant decay, disintegrating as they moved, yet somehow reforming again.

With the musical instruments in their hands, they played undeniably melodious tunes, but the tunes somehow carried an overwhelming sensation that made people feel as if their very souls might burst.

What weirded out the people around the most was the appearance of these figures. They resembled dried-out corpses, and their faces had an eerie mix of humans and some other lifeforms. However, despite their lifeless appearance, their auras sent shivers down the spines of even the Earth Venerates present.

Slowly, more and more these peculiar lifeforms emerged from the gate, as if they were the musical escorts for a grand event unfolding before them.

Amidst the unfolding spectacle, a black palanquin appeared, looking as big as a mountain. This gigantic thing required the strength of eight giants to carry it.

When these eight giants materialized, the world quivered. With every step they took, mountains swayed and the stars flickered.

This enormous escort stretched ten thousand miles long and set its course straight for the Vermilion Bird Empire. As they approached, endless death energy filled this world, causing all vegetation within the capital to wither.

The infection of this hellish aura turned the place into a corner of hell itself.

“We welcome the Emperor’s woman’s return!”

Suddenly, the eight giants shouted in unison, their voices shaking Yu Qingxuan’s body. And then, as if in response to their shout, flower petals materialized behind her. These petals were unusually long and slender, resembling the tentacles of some monstrous entity. Strangely, the stamens were even longer, giving them the appearance of petals, while the petals seemed to take on the appearance of stamens.

A sinister aura enveloped Yu Qingxuan, and she began to float toward the gigantic black palanquin.

“No!”

Yu Xiaoyun roared and reached out to grab Yu Qingxuan. But he was shocked to see his hand simply pass right through her, unable to touch her.

Yu Qingxuan seemed to have turned into an apparition as they could no longer touch her. Furthermore, when Yu Xiaoyun’s body passed through her body, an invisible force knocked him aside.

When Yu Xiaoyun stabilized himself, people were horrified to see a few white strands appear in his black hair. He seemed to have aged.

Undeterred by this, Yu Xiaoyun began to form hand seals. He was clearly intent on dragging Yu Qingxuan back. Thus, Yu Qingxuan could only cry out for him to stop.

“Imperial father, don’t!”

She knew that the power of the Nether Emperor was not something that any of them could resist. If her father were to forcibly attempt, his longevity would be stripped away.

However, Yu Xiaoyun refused to stop. Blood then leaked out of the space between his eyebrows, as he ignited his essence blood. At that moment, the immemorial Vermilion Bird in his manifestation reappeared.

Yu Xiaoyun roared, “My daughter cannot be taken by anyone, not even the Nether Emperor!”

Seeing this, everyone was filled with horror. Jiang Huixin and Xu Lanxin desperately tried to intervene, but Yu Xiaoyun was resolute. Ignoring any restraint, he unleashed all his power in a last-ditch effort. No one could dissuade him from recklessly throwing his life away.

“Imperial father, please, I beg you…!” Upon seeing his father’s desperation, Yu Qingxuan’s heart shattered. Yu Xiaoyun would definitely die if this continued.

Just as the imperial family’s experts despaired, a black figure appeared and reached Yu Qingxuan before Yu Xiaoyun.

When that happened, the void quivered and some black flames formed a screen around Yu Qingxuan, knocking Yu Xiaoyun aside.

“She is my woman! I will save her myself!”

This black figure was Long Chen. He stood in front of Yu Qingxuan, looking at her tear-stained face.

“You little bastard, if my son-in-law dies, will Qingxuan stay alive?! Scram! I will unleash the full Vermilion Bird Divine Radiance! Who cares about some Nether Emperor? I will save my daughter no matter what!” roared Yu Xiaoyun.

Yu Xiaoyun knew that if he ignited all the remaining power of the Vermilion Bird, he should have a shot at saving his daughter.

Even so, the price of such a reckless act weighed down heavily on him. He knew that it would cost him his life and potentially jeopardize the future of the Vermilion Bird Empire.

However, in this battle, he could see that his children had grown up, each being an outstanding figure, so he was no longer worried about them.

With this newfound confidence, he made up his mind. No matter what, he would save Yu Qingxuan. After all, amongst all his sons and daughters, he owed her the most, and this was the only way he could repay her.

“Sorry, although you’re my father-in-law, my woman must be protected by myself.”

Long Chen then cupped Yu Qingxuan’s face and softly said, “Qingxuan, don’t worry. As long as I am here, no one can take you from my side.”

Just like that, Long Chen spread his arms.

“Don’t!” Yu Xiaoyun roared, while Yu Qingxuan screamed in terror. The experts from the Vermillion Bird Empire couldn’t bear to witness what was about to happen and shut their eyes.

Dong Mingyu charged over, wanting to share life and death with Long Chen. However, Ye Wusheng pressed a hand on her, and she instantly couldn’t move.

Ye Wusheng simply watched everything occurring without the slightest ripple in her eyes. It was as if nothing in this world could cause her to feel the slightest concern.

In front of everyone’s despairing gazes, Long Chen grabbed Yu Qingxuan. People were shocked to see his body also grow illusory.

“Long Chen, how could you do this? Big sister Meng Qi and the others still need you! I don’t want you to die with me!” Yu Qingxuan’s heart shattered. She knew that Long Chen would die with her.Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Everyone was weeping. They could not accept that these two would die just like this. This was too cruel.

Long Chen and Yu Qingxuan were enveloped by black energy, slowly floating toward the palanquin. Suddenly, Zhu Yifeng roared, his sword transforming into a streak of light that shot toward one of the giants carrying the palanquin.

However, that giant didn’t even look at it. The sword simply pierced through its body and flew out.

Their bodies seemed to not exist. However, the sword turned to dust once it flew out of the giant’s body. A divine weapon of the Vermilion Bird Empire was lost just like that.

“How can this be?! Can we only watch as they die?!” howled Zhu Yifeng painfully.

In the distance, Guo Ran, Xia Chen, and the Dragonblood warriors didn’t say anything but were clenching their fists tightly. They were also anxious.

It had to be known that their enemy this time was the Emperor of the Netherworld, an existence whose name terrified the nine heavens and ten lands. That was a supreme existence. Even with their confidence in Long Chen, their hearts clenched.

“Long Chen, I don’t want you to die with me! Don’t die…” Yu Qingxuan held Long Chen and wept.

On the other hand, Long Chen was calm and just held her. Suddenly, someone cried out. “The flower!”

Only now did people realize that the strange flower that had bloomed behind Yu Qingxuan was swaying. Some kind of force seemed to be affecting it.

Suddenly, Long Chen reached out and grabbed one of the slender petals.

Crack.

What shocked everyone was that Long Chen actually managed to tear off the petal.

“What?!”

Even more shocking though was that Long Chen then stabbed the petal into his own chest.

Blood sprayed, and the petal entered his body.

“Long Chen! Don’t!”

Yu Qingxuan screamed. She instantly realized what Long Chen was doing.
