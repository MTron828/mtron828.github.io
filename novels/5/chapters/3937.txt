Chapter 3926 First Generation Jiuli Immortal Characters

“Boss, where are you going?!” exclaimed Guo Ran and the others.

At this moment, a small figure emerged from the shadows. It was Dong Mingyu who was holding a bloody head, which belonged to none other than Ji Wuming. Dong Mingyu had managed to slay him.

However, in order to slay him, Dong Mingyu had paid quite the price. She had several bloody holes on her body that still had powerful faith energy thrumming in them.

Most likely, when Ji Wuming realized that he couldn’t escape, he launched a desperate counterattack in an attempt to drag Dong Mingyu down with him, dealing some serious wounds to her.

“Big brother Long Chen, wait for me!”

A bolt of lightning flew over. It was Lei Linger who had just finished extracting Weng Tianyao’s source runes. She then merged back into Long Chen’s body.

“There’s no time to explain. I have something extremely important to deal with, but the Heavenly Daos are calling us back. There’s still a bit of time, so absorb some more primal chaos qi while you can! If you miss this chance, it won’t come back again! Ah, Guo Ran, help me split this up with our brothers,” shouted Long Chen.

Long Chen then flung a spatial ring at Guo Ran. Within it, he saw thousands of Heavenly Dao Fruits with many random leaves stuck to them. In Long Chen’s rush, he had directly grabbed everything growing at the top of the Heavenly Dao Tree. The fruits at the top had two colors.

In other words, those were Double Supreme Heavenly Dao Fruits possessing the power of Supreme Bones and Supreme Blood. Consuming one would give a normal person a high chance of becoming a Double Supreme.

Many of the people that Long Chen had slain were Double Supremes. But most of them hadn’t reached the point of fully merging both. Once they were slain though, their energy was absorbed by the Heavenly Dao Tree which produced Double Supreme Heavenly Dao Fruits.

The Dragonblood warriors all had Supreme Blood now. Furthermore, their Supreme Blood was merged with their dragon blood.

After consuming this fruit, they could form a Supreme Bone, and every Dragonblood warrior would then become a Double Supreme.

Before Guo Ran could react, Long Chen had already flown off with Long Aotian. The Dragonblood warriors then looked around and saw that Kun Tu had also vanished.

“Heaven and earth are healing, so there’s an enormous amount of primal chaos qi flowing out. Absorb it quickly! Once the world heals, we’ll be forced out of the three thousand worlds and back to our own worlds!” shouted Mo Nian.

He was the first to fly away and summon his manifestation in the distance. He began to crazily inhale primal chaos qi.

Long Chen’s battle had thrown the laws of heaven and earth into chaos, so primal chaos qi was gushing out to heal the damage. During the battle, the chaos made it impossible for them to absorb it, but now that the laws of the Heavenly Daos had settled, the primal chaos qi was gentle enough to absorb. Thus, everyone stopped focusing on their recovery and instead began to absorb primal chaos qi.

…

BOOM!

Long Chen charged through the spatial gate and saw Luo Zichuan sitting and healing his wounds. Before Long Chen could say anything, Luo Zichuan already stared at Long Aotian in shock. “He…!”

Luo Zichuan instantly saw the pure violet blood in Long Aotian’s body, unable to believe his eyes.

Long Chen had already sealed Long Aotian’s senses, so he tossed him to the ground.

“My Spirit Blood, Spirit Root, and Spirit Bone were stolen by this fellow. Family head, do you think that using his blood to open the gate will work?” asked Long Chen.

“Most definitely!”

Luo Zichuan checked Long Aotian’s body and was overjoyed. He then nodded confidently.

“Good, once you finish extracting his blood, don’t take his life. I still have a use for him,” said Long Chen.

Of course, Long Chen still had a use for him. Right now, Long Aotian had only awakened Long Chen’s Supreme Blood but not his Supreme Bone or Spirit Root. If Long Chen took back his things now, at most he would reclaim his Supreme Blood. But his Supreme Bone and Spirit Root would be ruined.

It would be better for Long Aotian and the Long family to nourish them, and once the opportunity matured, Long Chen would reclaim all three at once.

Luo Zichuan looked from Long Aotian to Long Chen. After that, an understanding expression appeared in his eyes, and he smiled.

“I understand. I’m just one step away from opening the gate. His violet blood is so pure, so using just a portion is enough. I won’t take his life. Don’t worry,” said Luo Zichuan.

“But you don’t need to let him off too easily either. His violet blood has its own life force, so you can take as much as you can. The leftovers can be given to the Luo family’s disciples,” said Long Chen with his own smile.

Upon hearing this, Luo Zichuan’s smile widened. He didn’t say anything more and just dragged the unconscious Long Aotian into the spatial barrier.

After leaving Long Aotian with Luo Zichuan, Long Chen finally fully relaxed. Nothing else here needed his attention.

He then left this world as the summoning power was growing stronger and stronger.

Long Chen hastened toward the Dragonblood Legion. After gathering in the three thousand worlds, he had many words he wanted to share with everyone.

Just as he was flying, he noticed something odd in the distance, so he rushed over to check and saw a distorted space. A scholar was surrounded by countless characters and was pulling at some giant stone stele inside that distorted space.

“Li Chenggang!”

Long Chen was dumbfounded as he recognized this person. It was the heavenly genius from one of the four immemorial sects, the Calligraphy Sect’s Li Chenggang.𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

“Brother Long, help me lift up this stele!” Li Chenggang was delighted to see Long Chen and called out to him.

Long Chen hastily flew over. He found that it was an enormous stele thousands of miles wide, and Li Chenggang was using some magical art that formed a chain around the stele to drag it out.

When Long Chen grabbed the chain, he was shocked to find that it was heavier than an entire star. Even with his strength, the stele was only pulled out a little bit more.

“What is this?!” exclaimed Long Chen.

“I don’t know either. However, this stone stele is from the primal chaos era! The stone itself is ordinary, but a portion of the characters carved on it are first generation Jiuli immortal characters! That is what prevents the stone stele from decaying, and what causes an ordinary rock to be as heavy as a star. These Jiuli immortal characters are too holy to copy, record, or brand into the soul. If we want to obtain the characters, we have to drag out the entire stele. But…” Li Chenggang was anxious.

Even with Long Chen’s strength, they couldn’t completely drag out the stele. Right now, the summoning pull was growing increasingly strong. It wouldn’t be long before they would be expelled from the three thousand worlds. However, Li Chenggang viewed the first generation immortal characters as just as important as his own life, and he refused to let go.

“Are they all first generation Jiuli immortal characters?” asked Long Chen.

“No, there are only a few fragmentary ones. But even those are priceless treasures!” said Li Chenggang.

Suddenly, the space around Long Chen and Li Chenggang quivered, and a whirlpool appeared around them. Seeing this, both of them panicked. They were about to be sent away.

Moreover, Long Chen was in a rush. He still wanted to return to everyone and say some things before they departed. Once they were all gone, who knew when they would see each other again?

“Brother Li, there’s no other way. How about I help you break the stele apart?” asked Long Chen.

“Can you break it? That would be amazing!” Li Chenggang perked up when he heard that.

Long Chen then took out a bronze cauldron and smashed it at the stele.
