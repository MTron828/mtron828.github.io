Chapter 3817 Gathering Treasures

“You’re giving it to me?” Long Chen was startled.

“Yes. After knowing you for so long, I don’t recall ever giving you any decent gift. The Fullmoon Divine Rhinoceros Horn can only be used by someone with powerful Spiritual Strength. It’s a requirement in order to control and nourish it. With it, you’ll have a transcendent trump card,” said Yue Xiaoqian.

The Fullmoon DIvine Rhinoceros Horn had the ability to break space, so the controller could essentially use it as a transportation formation. Furthermore, it was instantaneous, without spatial limitations. It was truly a life-saving trump card.

Long Chen smiled. “You foolish girl, first of all, I have enough power to protect myself, and second, my cultivation technique makes it so that I cannot rely on such things to save my life. Third, you need it more than me. But the most important point is that your life is more important than mine.”

This sappiness made it so Mo Nian couldn’t help but interject, “Hey, hey, we’re still here. Ignoring myself, there are two other bachelors here. Take care not to influence them, you animals in love.”

Guo Ran and Xia Chen rolled their eyes. This fellow’s mouth was so sinister that it even dragged the two of them into it.

Since Long Chen didn’t want it, Yue Xiaoqian was embarrassed and handed it to Mo Nian. “Then how about you take it? Your mouth is so toxic, and you’re chased by countless people all day. You need it more.”

“Are you looking down on me? My fleeing abilities are top-notch. Do you think I need this?” said Mo Nian.

“Your best asset isn’t your fleeing abilities but your wretched mouth. Did you not realize that was what she was saying?” Long Chen couldn’t help laughing.

“Damn, you two are teaming up against me, eh? Fine, just wait until my Zongying returns,” said Mo Nian fearlessly.

“And then what? When our sisters reunite, you’ll still be outnumbered,” teased Yue Xiaoqian.

“Ah, well…”

“It might be better for you to find a few junior sisters to accompany big sister Zongying!” giggled Yue Xiaoqian. But this giggle contained a hint of craftiness.

Mo Nian shivered at the thought. Liu Zongying was not one to accept such a thing. Such a thing would immediately cause a fatal blow.

“Alright, count yourselves vicious. I admit defeat in this round.”

Mo Nian might dare to compete in other areas but not in this one.

Yue Xiaoqian ended up trying to give the Fullmoon Divine Rhinoceros Horn to Xia Chen. He was a talisman cultivator with immense soul energy, making him also capable of controlling it.

However, Xia Chen also refused to accept it, saying that he had enough power to protect himself. This was the treasure that Yue Xiaoqian had obtained through her own abilities. How could he possibly accept it?

“I feel like it suits me,” said Guo Ran shamelessly. But then he helplessly said, “It’s such a shame. With my pitiful Spiritual Strength, I just can’t use it properly!”

Everyone laughed at that. Guo Ran’s Spiritual Strength was far too weak. Even after Long Chen had increased it many times, its growth was still limited.

Since everyone else refused to accept it, Yue Xiaoqian could only keep it for herself. When she placed a drop of her essence blood containing her Spiritual Strength on the Fullmoon Divine Rhinoceros Horn, it instantly emitted blazing light. It easily accepted her as master.

Its master had been dead for too long, so it had already produced its own consciousness. As Yue Xiaoqian was willing to feed it her own Spiritual Strength, it was like a drowning person grasping a lifeline. It seemed to feel even more urgent than Yue Xiaoqian.

All alone here, without any energy supplementation, it would eventually wither away. Thus, it immediately accepted Yue Xiaoqian with the nourishment of that one drop of blood.𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

The horn shrank until it was only just over an inch long. It ended up placing itself on top of her left hand’s forefinger like a refined finger cover, looking like nothing more than a piece of jewelry. However, it possessed a terrifying space-breaking ability. Yue Xiaoqian was pleasantly surprised.

With this, her ability to protect her own life had instantly risen by several levels. There was no way that she could be surrounded by people like last time.

A while of searching later, Guo Ran pulled out a giant broken sword from a pile of sand. It was over thirty meters long, and it seemed to be the weapon of some giant.

“It’s too bad. Its divinity has mostly vanished and it’s basically trash. But there are still some runes on it that have some research value.” Guo Ran sighed and put away the sword.

“That’s right, Guo Ran, your luck is excellent! Everyone, let’s split up but stay within a certain distance from each other. We’ll rely on our own luck to search for things.” Long Chen suddenly thought of how the dragon expert had said that due to how weak Guo Ran was, the heavens would look after him.

If everyone split up, perhaps this fellow would be able to find even better treasures rather than some broken sword.

“This is the heavenly tomb. Don’t treat it lightly and don’t get too far from each other. We have to be able to help each other at any moment,” reminded Mo Nian.

Everyone nodded.

As for Guo Ran, he was no longer afraid of the elder he was carrying. Everyone split up. Guo Ran and Xia Chen went left, while Yue Xiaoqian and Mo Nian went right. As for Long Chen, he was holding the hairpin, so he was deciding their general direction.

The five of them walked forward in a line. They were a few hundred miles from each other and could clearly sense each other’s auras.

“Damn, boss, I found a jar and it’s intact!”

“Boss, I found another good saber!”

“Hahahaha, it’s a spatial ring! I can open it! I’m rich, I’m rich!”

Guo Ran repeatedly cried out in delight. This fellow’s luck was truly amazing. In less than an incense stick’s worth of time, he had found several items.

“Stop shouting about every little thing, just in case you end up drawing out some monster. Learn how to rejoice inside,” ordered Long Chen. This fellow liked showing off too much.

In truth, Long Chen’s luck actually wasn’t bad. He obtained several weapons. Although most of them were badly damaged, there were still some intact runes. They would be useful to Xia Chen and Guo Ran.

Other than weapons, Long Chen also pulled out a crystal from a devil beast’s body. Although it had already shattered, there was still a trace of energy within it. Its value was also astonishing.

They continued onwards, and every single one of them made gains. Long Chen found that his luck in the three thousand worlds was clearly better compared to before. Perhaps the Butterfly Spirit race’s blessing really was effective.

Long Chen had ended up running into the Ice Soul as soon as he entered the three thousand worlds. He almost couldn’t believe that he had such luck.

Now, he repeatedly found good stuff, so he was delighted by this feeling. It seemed that there weren’t many times in his life that his luck was ever this good.

“Senior, I’m sorry.”

The skeleton of a human expert appeared in front of Long Chen. It had one knee on the ground, and its sword was stabbed into it. Although it had been dead for countless years, it refused to collapse.

When Long Chen took its sword, the skeleton instantly turned into dust.

This was also a World Domain divine item. The sword and sheath were completely intact and undamaged. After inspecting them, Long Chen solemnly put them away.

They continued onwards. Long Chen repeatedly found several good things. But suddenly, his expression changed.

“Guo Ran!”

What horrified Long Chen, Mo Nian, and the others was that there was no response from Guo Ran. When they looked for him, they found that he had bizarrely vanished. All their hearts rose up their throats.
