Chapter 3259 Come to Pay Respect

As Qin Feng pulled his saber from that elder’s neck, the surrounding Divine Lords relaxed their hostile stances. They then put down their weapons that were originally pointed at Long Chen and the others.

Long Chen smiled slightly. Although he didn’t care about these experts, it would be difficult to communicate if they were to try and stop his group.

Fortunately, Qin Feng had already shocked them. Sometimes giving a strong display of force was the only way to make communication easier.

As expected, although this elder was enraged, he could tell that these youngsters were not to be provoked. His expression was ugly, but his tone had improved. “May I know what you wish to know about my Jiang Prefecture?”

“Jiang Prefecture? This isn’t the Yuhua Prefecture?” asked Qin Feng. He then looked at Bai Xiaole.

Bai Xiaole was also surprised. “I didn’t get the direction wrong. Was it because of the Ghost Ship-?”

“Cough!” Long Chen suddenly interrupted Bai Xiaole.

However, the words of the Ghost Ship had come out of Bai Xiaole’s mouth. As a result, all the experts here were shocked and retreated, as if they were seeing a demon of pestilence.

Even that elder’s expression changed. The Ghost Ship was an object of misfortune. Some people said that it was the curse of the devil, and those who saw one would be infected by their misfortune. Moreover, those that interacted with the unlucky people would also run into bad luck.

“Don’t listen to his nonsense. How could there be such a thing as a Ghost Ship in this world? Senior, we wish to go to the Yuhua Prefecture. May I ask which direction it is?” said Long Chen.

“Are you that dual champion of the Heavenly Swell Domain’s Nine Prefecture Convention, Long Chen?!” Suddenly, another elder cried out.

“I wouldn’t dare to be called that. But yes.” Long Chen cupped his fists.

“You really encountered a Ghost Ship?” asked that elder.

“There was no such thing. I just told them some scary stories while crossing the devil sea. I told them about the legend of the Ghost Ships, so this fellow probably pissed himself when he heard it and got the direction mixed up.” Long Chen shrugged.

The matter of the Ghost Ship was too bizarre. It would be best not to randomly talk about it. While Long Chen wasn’t afraid for himself, he was worried about Bai Xiaole and the others provoking something bad.

Hearing that, these experts relaxed slightly. Their guard also dropped when they learned that Long Chen was the champion of the Nine Prefecture Convention.

They told Long Chen that they had gotten lost. They were very far from the Yuhua Prefecture. However, once they learned who he was, they treated his group with warm hospitality, providing him with a mode of transportation and a path that brought them closer to the Yuhua Prefecture.

Once they were out of the transportation formation, they went off in their flying boat once more. On the way, he told them to keep quiet about the Ghost Ship. Such a thing was very controversial, and it would be best to be careful about mentioning it to others.

Their flying boat quickly approached the Yuhua Prefecture. At this moment, Qi Yu tensed slightly. The Yuhua Palace was the sect that had raised him ever since he was in the immortal world. He hated Jiang Baihe, but he didn’t hate the Yuhua Palace. Now that he was returning to the Yuhua Prefecture, he felt a bit lost.

“Boss, up ahead is the territory of the Yuhua Palace,” said Qi Yu quietly as he started to see familiar scenery.

“Good. Let’s go down.”

Long Chen had Bai Shishi put away the flying boat, and they started flying over to the Yuhua Palace. As expected, it wasn’t long before some experts appeared their way.

“Qi Yu, you traitor, you have the face to return?! The palace master has ordered you to be executed on sight for massacring your fellow disciples!”

Dozens of patrolling disciples immediately congregated on them, their leader being a mid Four Peak expert.Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

When Qi Yu saw that expert, his eyes reddened. This was one of his attackers. Two of the wounds on his body had been left by this person.

“Lu Ziya, you were the one who killed those disciples. How dare you accuse me?” roared Qi Yu. He then slashed his sword at him.

Lu Ziya had joined the sect over a year before Qi Yu, so he was Qi Yu’s senior apprentice-brother. Also, as Qi Yu had just advanced to the first Heavenstage of the Four Peak realm, he was a bit weaker than Lu Ziya.

BOOM!

However, when their weapons collided, Lu Ziya grunted. Just like that, he was sent flying, his weapon almost leaving his hold.

Lu Ziya was shocked. It had only been a few days, so how did Qi Yu suddenly become so powerful? Of course, Lu Ziya didn’t know that Qi Yu had gone through the tempering of the Honing Heavenly Staircase. Because of it, Qi Yu had transformed from the last time Lu Ziya saw him. His sharp edge had been honed.

The other disciples with Lu Ziya took out their weapons, but they suddenly found that they couldn’t move. They were shocked to find that space had frozen.

“The adults are talking. Children, don’t interfere.” When Bai Xiaole’s hand seals changed, those disciples coughed up blood and collapsed on the ground, their auras plummeting.

“Nice. Your spatial energy is well-controlled. You can count as a first-rate expert now,” said Long Chen. Now that Bai Xiaole had gotten serious with training, he was definitely not inferior to any heavenly genius.

He had good talent, and now that he was working hard, he had actually undergone shocking growth in a short time. Even Long Chen had a newfound respect for him.

Bai Xiaole was delighted to receive Long Chen’s praise. Seeing that, Bai Shishi covered her mouth and smiled. Ever since becoming Long Chen’s subordinate, Bai Xiaole had truly undergone a shocking transformation.

Even with all his efforts, Bai Zhantang was unable to raise his son properly. But Long Chen had easily done it. It really was a case of needing the right tools for the right job.

With seven slashes of his sword, Qi Yu managed to break through Lu Ziya’s defenses and stab his sword into his chest. Qi Yu’s face twisted with hatred and anger. “You bastard, did you ever think that such a day would come for you?”

With his sword piercing his chest, Lu Ziya was terrified. “Junior apprentice-brother Qi, don’t kill me! I didn’t want to be your enemy! I had to listen to senior apprentice-brother Baihe’s orders! I beg you, don’t kill me. It was senior apprentice-brother Baihe who forced me to do this!”

Lu Ziya had thought that victory was well within his grasp. But in the blink of an eye, he was the one begging for mercy. The stark fall made him particularly contemptible.

“Qi Yu, leave him alive. He’ll be useful in a bit,” said Long Chen.

Qi Yu extracted his sword but punched Lu Ziya’s face, knocking him unconscious.

Just then, the sound of an alarm rang out and countless experts rushed over. As soon as they noticed Qi Yu, a hidden alarm was also spread to certain people.

Jiang Baihe had long since set up a heaven-encompassing net. As long as Qi Yu dared to return, he wouldn’t even have a chance to enter the gates of the palace before being slain.

Seeing this, Long Chen sneered and suddenly announced, “The seventh branch’s dean of the High Firmament Academy, Long Chen, has come to pay respect!”

Long Chen’s powerful voice was like the roar of a god. It echoed throughout this space.

“Come to pay respect!”

“Come to pay respect!”

“Come to pay respect!”

“...”

His voice was echoing, seemingly throughout the entire world. It contained a domineeringness that shook people’s hearts.

Following that, an ancient voice rang out in the distance. “My important guests, you’ve come a long way. The Yuhua Palace is graced by your presence. Please, come in and have a rest in my home.”

“Let’s go.”

Long Chen waved his hand, bringing everyone along. However, Qin Feng and the others were stunned. When did their boss become the dean?
