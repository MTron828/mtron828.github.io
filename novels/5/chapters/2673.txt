Chapter 2662 So Arrogant?

The Nine-Headed Lion, the Alldevil Heavenwalker, the dragon woman, the Blood Fiend Devil Lord, and the others only realized that they had fallen for Long Chen’s trap at this moment. It seemed that everything had been calculated by Long Chen.

With the five Sovereign present, it would be said that there was nowhere to run. There was no path to the heavens, no gate to the earth.

Even Ye Liangchen and the others’ expressions changed. Jiang Wuchen suddenly thought of how Feng Fei had retreated and sent him a spiritual message to quickly flee.

However, he hadn’t understood or had a chance to ask what she meant before the five Sovereigns descended.

“Not bad, you know how to take advantage of opportunities. You know that our power comes from the heavenly tribulation. Once the power of this heavenly tribulation runs out, it will count as a pass. Little brother, you’re getting smarter.” Sovereign Han Wei laughed, seemingly very pleased.

“Big sister praises me. It’s not me being smart but simply some fools forcibly charging in. They refused to leave no matter what I did,” said Long Chen humbly.

“Long Chen, we came here to help you handle them!” shouted Long Aotian coldly. Long Chen had essentially included the divine families when he called them fools.

However, at the same time, Long Aotian was unable to conceal his jealousy. The five Sovereigns had appeared in Long Chen’s heavenly tribulation. What did that signify? It signified that Long Chen was the successor that they had chosen.

Long Chen was essentially set as the sixth generation Sovereign, and this fact completely severed Long Aotian’s ambitions. How could he not be jealous? How could he not be furious?

After Long Chen became Sovereign, no one else would be able to become Sovereign. This world would be under his control. No matter how great the heavenly genius was, they would be nothing to him.

Below the Sovereigns were the Emperors. There had been three Emperors throughout history, the Peng Emperor, the Blood Emperor, and the Corrupt Emperor. There was also the shameless self-proclaimed Stone Emperor.

They were said to be the strongest experts below the Sovereigns, but when compared to the Sovereigns, they still lost their splendor. In this world, no one could compete with a Sovereign, because once they became a Sovereign, they represented the entire world.

“Oh, that’s right. I forgot that we’re on the same side,” said Long Chen emotionlessly. Everyone could clearly see the jealousy in Long Aotian’s eyes.

Although Long Aotian was the one who had the greatest forbearance amongst the five Sovereign sprouts of the divine families, his acting skills were only average. He couldn’t even compare to Dongfang Yuyang in that regard, and Long Chen easily saw through his act. From the start, Long Chen had never viewed the divine families as true allies, nor would he entrust his back to them.

“Hehe, little sister, come over.” Sovereign Han Wei suddenly beckoned to the distant Zi Yan with a warm smile.

“Zi Yan greets the Sovereign.”

Zi Yan flew over. Her heart was filled with various emotions. At this moment, her mouth moved a few times, but she didn’t voice the question she had.

Sovereign Han Wei said, “Don’t you want to ask me why I look like the ninth divine emissary?”

Zi Yan nodded. She was truly shaken by the appearance of Sovereign Han Wei. She knew her as the ninth divine emissary.

Any historical information about the five Sovereigns was extremely muddled. Even the name of the fourth generation Sovereign had never been heard before, so no one had expected the fourth generation Sovereign to be a woman.

“Hehe, there’s not much time, so I can’t say too much to you. But just seeing you makes me content. This era’s heir to the Southern Sea Zither is excellent, so I’m at ease. If you wish to know more about me, you can ask Long Chen in the future, providing that he doesn’t die.” Sovereign Han Wei gently brushed Zi Yan’s cheek, looking at her like she was her real little sister. “In the end, let me just say that I’m truly very happy to see you.”

Suddenly, Zi Yan was sent out of the core of the heavenly tribulation. She returned to her original location from before she interfered.

“That’s about all the time we have. Let’s start. Long Chen, are you ready?” asked Sovereign Zi Yang.

“Wait a moment,” said Long Chen hastily. “When we start fighting, we won’t be able to have mercy on each other. I want to first introduce you to my family.”

The Dragonblood warriors were already stepping forward. They came to the edge of the heavenly tribulation, and everyone from the Dragonblood Legion had emotional expressions.

Those were the five Sovereigns. Every single one of them had led an entire era, and they were people who stood at the peak even in legend and myth. Since Long Chen was actually their brother, just how glorious was this?

“This big brother is Sovereign Yun Shang. He is the first generation. This is Sovereign Qing Xu. You can call him second brother. This is third brother Sovereign Mo Li, this is fourth sister Sovereign Han Wei, and this is fifth brother Sovereign Zi Yang,” introduced Long Chen.

“Big brother, second brother, third brother, fourth sister, fifth brother!”

The Dragonblood warriors cried out enthusiastically. Their eyes were red with emotion. Right now, they clenched their fists, wanting to charge forward. Even if they died right now, they would have no regrets.

Sovereign Yun Shang nodded toward them. “This is the strongest legion within the Martial Heaven Continent’s history. Brothers, sisters, I entrust the Martial Heaven Continent to you.”

“We will fight to the death!” shouted Guo Ran. This was his first time being moved to such an extent by anyone other than Long Chen. His hot blood was ignited.

The Dragonblood warriors also shouted their own oaths. This was an oath to the Sovereigns to protect the Martial Heaven Continent with their lives.

“Hmph, who cares about the Sovereigns? Are they so amazing? The Martial Heaven Continent’s destiny has come to an end. There is no way for you to fight back.”

Just at this moment, a cold snort ignited everyone’s fury.

“Alldevil Heavenwalker!”

Roars of fury rang out. In the face of those furious gazes, the Alldevil Heavenwalker sneered, “Just a few dead people are worth making such a fuss over? Today I’ll show you that the Sovereigns are nothing amazing. Within the same realm, I’m not afraid of anyone. I’ll show you how I butcher Sovereigns.”

“That’s right. Sovereigns? There’s nothing so great about them. I’ll defeat your Sovereigns today to show you despair,” said the Nine-Headed Lion. His fury began to glow brightly.

The dragon woman, the Blood Fiend Devil Lord, and Ye Ming added in their own sneers, their auras soaring.

BOOM!

The void shuddered and chains shot out, sealing this space. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

“Time is up. Let me see just how strong the experts from the other worlds are in this era.” Sovereign Han Wei smiled and stepped forward on her own.

“I’ll show you right now!” The Nine-Headed Lion roared and charged. His aura explosively grew.

“Are the children of this generation all so arrogant?”

Sovereign Han Wei frowned slightly. After she plucked the air with a finger, a slender string of light appeared and struck the Nine-Headed Lion.

As a result, blood splashed. The Nine-Headed Lion’s body was severed at the waist.
