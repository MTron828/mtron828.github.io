Chapter 4826 Iron Blood Gate

When these Mortal Saint guards saw the golden tablet in Mo NIan’s hand, they were all shocked, and the way they looked at Mo Nian was completely different.

The leader of these guards accepted Mo Nian’s tablet and examined it closely. Seeing that it was authentic, he couldn’t believe it.

“You’ve killed a Heaven Saint devil creature before?” asked Yu Tong, covering her mouth as she was filled with disbelief.

Long Chen didn’t know what this tablet represented, but Yu Tong did. It was a symbol of status within Devil Fall City.

Only someone who had personally killed a Heaven Saint devil creature and handed their head to Devil Fall City could obtain a Devil Fall Tablet. Devil Fall City would then determine whether or not that person had really killed the devil creature based on the curse of resentment passed by the devil creature.

If someone else was even present during the slaying of the devil creature, even if they didn’t help, the challenger wouldn’t be able to pass the test. Only those who had single-handedly defeated a Heaven Saint devil creature would pass the test and earn one of these tablets.

Furthermore, the Golden Devil Fall Tablet was exclusively bestowed upon Divine Venerates who had slain Heaven Saint devil creatures. If a Heaven Saint were to accomplish this feat, they would not receive one of these tablets.

The Golden Devil Fall Tablet granted a single free usage of all publicly owned facilities, which included the very best cultivation rooms, training areas, martial stages, puppets, etc. It offered access to over a hundred different complimentary services.

The owner of the Golden Devil Fall Tablet would have almost free access in the city and would be treated as a V.I.P. no matter where they went. They even got special treatment when it came to buying treasures.

Yu Tong quickly informed Long Chen of the significance of the tablet. Upon learning what it meant, Long Chen was also shocked. Mo Nian had managed to slay a Heaven Saint devil creature single-handedly? That was absolutely terrifying.

Although Long Chen had also slain a Heaven Saint devil creature before, that one had already been severely wounded by Bai Zhantang and had yet to heal. Furthermore, the Dragonblood Legion had joined forces to kill it. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

Had Long Chen faced the injured devil lord alone, he wouldn't have been overly confident in his ability to kill it. After all, killing such a powerful being alone was completely different than defeating it.

Those whom Mo Nian had slapped were also shocked by this tablet. They hadn’t expected to have kicked an iron plate this time.

Their leader had come here to recruit some fresh blood, so he naturally knew what the Golden Devil Fall Tablet represented. As a result, they were all shocked, enraged, and vexed. How were they so unlucky to end up encountering such a terrifying existence?

“So you thought you could break the rules of Devil Fall City just because you have a golden tablet? Hmph, let’s see what happens after you lose it! Once we’re in the city, I’ll make sure you learn the fate of those who offend my Iron Blood Gate!” shouted the leader of these savages.

Mo Nian snickered, “Ah, so it’s one of the four noble families, the Iron Blood Gate. No wonder you’re so arrogant. But it’s fine, I like putting arrogant people in their place. As for my fate, hehe, it seems I’m still doing very well, don’t you think? Let me tell you the truth. That is the corpse devil curse. Unless a Heaven Saint sacrifices a hundred years of their cultivation base to help you break it, your flesh will not heal. You can just live the rest of your lives with your mouths rotting away, all the way until you become Heaven Saints. It’s not that I’m looking down on you, but with your talent, hehe, I don’t think there’s any chance of you achieving it in this lifetime.”

“You...!” The group leader of the Iron Blood Gate was outraged. If it really was as Mo Nian said, then they would have rotting mouths for the rest of their lives. After all, they were only five star Doyens and not core disciples. However, even if they were core disciples, a Heaven Saint wouldn’t sacrifice a hundred years of their cultivation base to help them remove the curse. Let alone that, a Heaven Saint might not be willing to do that for their own grandchild.

Long Chen was amazed by Mo Nian. He really had his own methods. With Long Chen’s character, he’d have directly killed these disgusting people, but Mo Nian was even more vicious, making sure that they would never have a mouth again. It was the most suitable punishment for their disgusting mouths, even better than killing them.

“City guards, he maliciously attacked and injured people in front of the city gates! Take his Golden Devil Fall Tablet!” shouted the group leader of the Iron Blood Gate. He could only vent his anger in this way.

The leader of these guards looked at Mo Nian and then Long Chen, before turning back to that person and coldly saying, “You were the ones who provoked them first with your disgusting words. Why else would they attack you?”

“Guards! You...”

“Silence! Both sides were at fault. I’ll record this incident, and I’ll settle things with both of you when I have time.”

After saying that, the guard returned the tablet to Mo Nian, and in a voice that only a few of them could hear, he said, “Brother, we are all part of the human race. I can only help you this much. It’ll be up to you in the future.”

Mo Nian was startled, having not expected this guard to be so biased toward him. After all, Mo Nian didn’t actually have any relationship with these guards.

“You’re abusing your position!” roared the group leader of the Iron Blood Gate.

“Shut your mouth. Even your teeth are turning black already. If you don’t focus on resisting that curse, you might just lose your lives,” sneered the guard.

After saying that, he announced, “Everyone, listen well! Since you’ve come to Devil Fall City, you must respect our rules. Anyone who dares to cause trouble will be sternly punished.”

After announcing that, he vanished along with the rest of the guards, leaving the stunned audience. A group of people were covering their mouths, brimming with righteous indignation.

The surrounding experts were all confused, not knowing what had happened. However, anyone who wasn’t blind could see that those guards were biased toward Long Chen and Mo Nian.

Everyone’s gaze concentrated on Mo Nian as they started to guess his background, their gazes almost worshipful. From this, Long Chen deduced that the Golden Devil Fall Tablet was clearly more special than he had thought.

Mo Nian was basking in those gazes, but the painful screams of those people with rotting mouths were disturbing him. He taunted, “Hey, can you keep it down? What happened to that arrogance of yours? Keep shouting, and maybe I’ll dig out a crap hole and bury you all inside.”

“What are you talking about? If you dig a hole, it’s just a hole. How does it become a crap hole?” asked Long Chen.

“Once the hole is dug, we’ll each relieve ourselves, and it’ll be a crap hole, no?” replied Mo Nian, looking speechless.

“Alright, you win.” Long Chen was also speechless.

“You... just you wait!” Those people clenched their teeth furiously but also didn’t dare to keep provoking Long Chen and Mo Nian.

“Just ignore them. They’re not worth getting angry about. You know, I didn’t realize someone as wretched as you would be so amazing!” praised Yu Tong, only recovering from her shock now.

“I feel like that praise would become perfect if you got rid of the ‘wretched’ part!” Mo Nian rubbed his nose solemnly.

Yu Tong and Yu Fei laughed. After that, the line quickly moved forward, and it was their turn to register. Long Chen then reported his name and carved his unique rune onto his newly received tablet; all he needed to do next was drip a drop of blood onto it to complete it.

“Hold it!”

At this moment, another group of people came rushing over furiously, and Long Chen turned around to see another group of guards.

Upon seeing the guard, the people who had previously provoked Long Chen and Mo Nian were overjoyed.

“Now we’ll see how you die!”
