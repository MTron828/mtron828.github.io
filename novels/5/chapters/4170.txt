Chapter 4159 Dressing as a Pig to Eat the Tiger?

This demonic beast expert was extremely arrogant. After killing a human expert, the demonic beast race’s side cheered fanatically.

Undoubtedly, that demonic beast expert was truly powerful. He had effortlessly dispatched seven heavenly geniuses from the human race without suffering a scratch. In response to this remarkable display, the demonic beasts in his ranks erupted in cheers, while some made menacing throat-cutting gestures toward the human faction.

Seeing this, the human experts seethed with anger, their teeth clenched in frustration. This person was too arrogant.

“Everyone, don’t fall for it! He’s no Double Supreme but a true Supreme who has merged all three Supremes! He’s only pretending to be a Double Supreme to fight us! How sinister!” shouted a human expert.

“Hahaha, how laughable. Not being able to beat me, you actually declare that I must be cheating? The human race really is shameless,” sneered the demonic beast expert.

That human expert was about to reply when there was an uproar from the crowd. They then saw a group of humans coming out of the demonic beast race’s area.

These people were Long Chen and his companions. Both the humans and demonic beasts were startled to see them come from there.

“You’re the one being shameless. You only expose two kinds of power and think that is enough to pass as a Double Supreme?” said one of the Dragonblood warriors who was walking over.

Long Chen and the others’ arrival caused the scene to change. Almost everyone turned toward them.

“What a joke. You say that I’m a Triple Supreme? Where is your proof? If you don’t have it, don’t randomly accuse others. Just shut up and fight,” sneered the demonic beast expert.

“As you wish.”

In an instant, that Dragonblood warrior arrived in front of that expert, looking at him coldly like a leopard eyeing his prey. Just that gaze alone gave that demonic beast expert the chills.

“Who are they? Why did they come out of the demonic beast race’s domain? Did the demonic beast race actually let them through?”

Countless people eyed Long Chen and the others, guessing their identities.

“I recognize him! He’s Long Chen, the one that the Soaring Dragon Company wants to capture! Haha, I’ve struck gold this time!” A startled cry rang out suddenly.

“Idiot, what are you happy for? The Soaring Dragon Company’s reward is just bait. Would you have a life to take it?” sneered someone else. This person also recognized Long Chen.

“Your information is outdated. You’re thinking about the reward? It’s rumored that Long Chen has the primal chaos divine item, the Heaven Earth Cauldron, with him. The Soaring Dragon Company’s reward is nothing compared to that. If you really have guts, capture him and the Heaven Earth Cauldron will be yours,” said another person disdainfully.

“Fool, how could anyone trust that kind of information? One of the ten primal chaos divine items? Just an Eternal divine weapon would be enough to drive people crazy,” retorted another expert.

“You’re the fool! Your whole family is a bunch of fools! Long Chen himself admitted to having the Heaven Earth Cauldron! If you don’t believe me, ask him!” cursed the person who was questioned.

Although some people recognized Long Chen, many of them had not even heard of his name. However, the fact that Long Chen and the others could come from the demonic beast race’s domain was enough to shock them.

Seeing one of his people step forward to challenge that demonic beast expert, they all watched expectantly.

“Report your name. I don’t kill nameless weaklings,” sneered the demonic beast expert.

“I am Yu Yong, a Dragonblood warrior under Long Chen's command, part of the fourth captain Yue Zifeng's regiment, and a member of the ninth squad led by squad leader Li Changqing,” declared Yu Yong firmly.

Hearing his answer, Long Chen almost coughed up blood. This little fellow was quite interesting, rattling off a whole list of names. That was rather inappropriate.

As expected, that demonic beast expert seemed mad. He thought that Yu Yong was joking around. Who reported their name like that?

Normally, someone would say what sect or power they came from. That was enough. With this long string of names and titles, not even the human experts understood, let alone a demonic beast like him. In fact, he couldn’t even remember what Yu Yong’s name was after all that.

“Idiot human, you can just die!” The demonic beast expert roared and spread his arms. His fingers were like hooks reaching toward Yu Yong.

His claws danced, constantly transforming as they slashed through the air. As a result, the sound of space tearing stabbed people’s ears.

“Watch out!”

Several human experts cried out. This was the very technique that had slain the demonic beast expert’s previous opponent, rendering that unfortunate human without any ability to resist. They hadn’t expected him to start off with such a sharp attack.

As a dragon cry rang out, Yu Yong summoned the Dragon Blood Battle Armor and began to unleash a torrent of fists at the demonic beast expert’s claws.

A metallic rumble echoed as his fists collided with the claws, igniting showers of sparks and unleashing powerful waves of qi that battered the onlookers' ears.

“Is he really human…?”

Seeing Yu Yong fighting barehanded against the demonic beast race, the onlookers were startled. It had to be known that his opponent was a demonic beast. His sharp claws were his weapon, but Yu Yong was fighting barehanded and didn’t seem to be at any disadvantage.

The two of them then began to increase the tempo, and their attacks grew sharper. As they fought, two-colored divine radiance appeared behind that expert. That was truly the manifestation of a Double Supreme.

Yu Yong was the same. Two-colored divine radiance flowed behind him, and a dragon-shaped image could be seen within it. The two of them continued to fight evenly.

“What power. Are you telling me he is just one random member of them? Who are they?”

Yu Yong’s power shocked everyone. They had personally seen Yu Yong come from the final line of Long Chen’s group. In their view, he was nothing more than someone else’s lowly subordinates. However, his power was stunning.

As a result, when they looked at Long Chen again, they felt that this group of people was even more mysterious and powerful than they had imagined. If all of them possessed a similar level of power, that would truly be terrifying.

BOOM!

The two of them exchanged hundreds of blows in an instant. All of a sudden, Yu Yong shouted sharply, and with a flurry of punches, he blew apart his opponent’s claws, creating an opening for him to stamp a foot ruthlessly on his opponent’s chest.

A cracking sound rang out, and that demonic beast expert was blown back, his blood spraying out of his mouth. In close-range combat, he was actually unable to beat Yu Yong. The latter had grasped an opportunity to deal him a serious wound.

Yu Yong immediately followed up, chasing after him while he was rapidly retreating.

Just then, the demonic beast expert’s manifestation changed. An additional color appeared behind him, and his aura grew explosively.

“Die!”

He could no longer bother with concealing his power. After that, the demonic beast expert roared.

“Despicable!”

“Shameless!”T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

“Watch out-!”

The moment his power was exposed, it revealed the manifestation of a Triple Supreme. Hence, countless human experts shouted furiously.

“This is the end.”

As if he had anticipated this moment all along, Yu Yong slowly reached back behind him. The moment his hand gripped the hilt of his sword, the blade came flying out.

Like a bolt of lightning streaking through the air, the next moment, heaven and earth seemed to be cut in two, and blood splashed. Along with the world and void, the demonic beast expert’s body was also cut in twain.

Yu Yong sheathed his sword. Looking at his opponent who was split in two, he said, “You wanted to dress as a pig to eat the tiger? Now, you really are a pig.”
