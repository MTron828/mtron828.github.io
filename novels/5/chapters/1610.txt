Chapter 1605 Sucked Into the Whirlpool

Translator: BornToBe

“Not good! Put away the flying boat!” shouted Long Chen. The flying boat was too large. If they put it away, perhaps they might have some hope of escaping

Xie Qianqian was panicking, and she hastily slammed a button on the flying boat’s control panel.

The flying boat instantly transformed into a ray of light that entered Xie Qianqian’s head. The image of a flying boat appeared on her forehead.

Once the flying boat vanished, they instantly felt a terrifying suction force. They began to fly into the twister in the sky.

“Grab hold of me!” shouted Long Chen. Evilmoon appeared in his hand. As it was heavier than a mountain, the two of them immediately dropped to the ground.

Long Chen stabbed Evilmoon into the hard rock all the way to the hilt. He just barely managed to stabilize himself.

Xie Qianqian held on tightly to Long Chen’s waist, but her body was already being pulled into the air. That suction force was too terrifying.

“Hold on tightly! I can bring you out!” called out Long Chen.

At this moment, it was like he was on the edge of a rapid waterfall. The pulling force behind him was too great. Just standing there was very difficult.

Relying on Evilmoon’s weight, he forcibly took a step forward. However, the ground was too flat and smooth. There was nowhere for him to get leverage.

“Hold on!”

Long Chen took a deep breath. He suddenly pulled Evilmoon out and stabbed it back into the ground as quick as lightning.

This fierce movement only gained him half a foot of distance. However, that didn’t discourage him. In fact, this was a good sign. As long as he could move away, the further he got from the whirlpool, the weaker its pull would be.

“Long Chen... I can’t hold on any longer.” Xie Qianqian was holding onto Long Chen as best as she could; however, her arm strength was limited.

“Ah!”

Xie Qianqian let out a frightened cry as she lost power in her arms and was sucked away by the whirlpool.

Long Chen suddenly extracted Evilmoon and followed the suction force as well. Then, he grabbed Xie Qianqian’s arm before stabbing Evilmoon into the ground again.

Xie Qianqian was saved, but now they were hundreds of meters closer to the twister. The pull was even stronger.

Furthermore, he was now holding onto Xie Qianqian with one hand. He couldn’t use the same method he had before.

The thing that made his heart grow cold was that he actually couldn’t think of anything. He could only keep this position. However, if this continued, he would run out of energy sooner or later. Then they would be sucked into the twister and torn apart.

“Long Chen, throw her away and you’ll have a chance to get out. She’s just a burden,” said Evilmoon.

Long Chen ignored Evilmoon and looked all around. His brain was working rapidly to find some way to get out.

He also knew that as long as he let go, then without the burden of an extra person, he would have a high chance of being able to get away.

However, while he was no gentleman, he definitely wasn’t someone who would abandon his companion in the face of danger.

“Fool, do you want to die with her?” raged Evilmoon.

Long Chen continued to ignore it. He kicked the ground, trying to make a foothold for himself, but the ground was both tough and slippery. His kicks only caused his foot to hurt.

“Long Chen, let me go. Perhaps you’ll be able to escape on your own,” said Xie Qianqian softly as she watched Long Chen struggle.

She knew that neither of them would be able to escape like this. She knew this, and she knew Long Chen knew it as well.

“I’m grateful you didn’t abandon me, but it’s your only choice,” said Xie Qianqian helplessly.

Long Chen shook his head. “There’s always a way. Don’t panic.”

“It’s useless. If you wait any longer, you’ll use up too much energy and won’t be able to even save yourself. Thank you. I’m happy to have met you before dying.”

Light suddenly shone from Xie Qianqian’s arm. Long Chen was startled as Xie Qianqian actually slid from his hold.

That energy was strange. It was not physical or spiritual energy, but it made it so he couldn’t grab hold of her arm.

“Are you joking? I’ve never abandoned a companion. Let’s have a look at what’s inside the whirlpool!”

Long Chen suddenly pulled Evilmoon out of the ground. The two of them began flying toward the whirlpool.

“Are you crazy?!”

Two voices rang out at the same time. One was Xie Qianqian’s, while the other was Evilmoon’s that rang out in his mind. Xie Qianqian’s voice was full of shock, while Evilmoon’s voice was full of rage.

Long Chen held onto Xie Qianqian’s waist and didn’t reply. With Evilmoon in his right hand, he stared closely at the nine-colored twister.

Long Chen’s thoughts were definitely not calm at this time. He didn’t even know what he was thinking. It wasn’t as if he had a relationship with Xie Qianqian. Why did he have to be so stupid as to throw himself into danger?

It had just been a kind of instinct. He didn’t know if it was because of his own sense of duty or because of the arrogance of the Pill Sovereign, but he couldn’t abandon anyone. Even Long Chen didn’t know why he would occasionally do such foolish things.

Xie Qianqian silently cried as she was held by Long Chen. Ever since her parents had died, no one had ever treated her well, but Long Chen was actually sacrificing his life to accompany her.

“Don’t be so emotional yet. There’s still a long way to go before we die. Hold onto my back and hold on tight. I’m going to fight,” said Long Chen.

Xie Qianqian tightly held onto Long Chen. Her arms were around his neck, and even her legs were wrapped around his waist. As extra precaution, Long Chen pulled out some rope and bound her to him. That way, he didn’t need to worry about her falling off.

They were getting closer and closer to the twister. Its pull was so powerful that Xie Qianqian felt like she was being crushed.

The majority of the pressure was being endured by Long Chen, but she was already in such a state. She clenched her teeth and forced herself to be silent, afraid that the slightest disturbance would affect him.

Long Chen’s divine ring appeared. The red, orange, yellow, green, and azure streams of water shook for an instant, but they quickly returned to normal.

Having summoned the divine ring, Long Chen felt the pressure weaken. However, that pressure quickly grew back as they approached the twister. Long Chen’s thirty-thousand-meter divine ring seemed to be squeezed by some kind of force and was constantly shrinking.

This was a scenario he had never encountered before. He understood too little about the divine ring. However, as it was compressed, its power grew greater, shocking him. Was this another possible state of the divine ring?

BOOM!

Long Chen was finally sucked into the twister, the core of the whirlpool. He felt like the whole world was squeezing him.

Xie Qianqian immediately coughed up blood. She was unable to bear the pressure.

“FengFu Star!”

“Alioth Star!”

“Life Fate Star!”

“Enlightenment Palace Star!”

Long Chen activated four stars at once, forcing back the pressure. This was the core of the nine-colored whirlpool. Here, he saw that the water of the nine lakes was actually not water. It was composed of countless runes.

There were nine types of energy clashing here, forming a pressure that could crush mountains instantly.

Xie Qianqian coughed up blood once more. She was at her limit.

Although Long Chen was forcing back the pressure and activating the first four stars had won her some breathing room, she eventually fainted.

“Her physical body is too weak.” Long Chen couldn’t help shaking his head. He had to focus on resisting the whirlpool.

Now that he was sucked within it, he found that he was sinking. It seemed that there was an exit at the bottom. However, the pressure only grew as he sank deeper.

Long Chen couldn’t resist the pull. He could only slowly sink.

As the pressure grew, the divine ring continued to shrink. He paid close attention to its changes because he found that it was growing stronger. Even the power of the four stars had changed in an indescribable way.

“Perhaps I should consider how to compress the divine ring in the future to unleash more power,” thought Long Chen.

When the divine ring was just three hundred meters wide, Xie Qianqian’s labored breathing rang out from behind him. The pressure was unendurable. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

“Divine Gate Star!”

Long Chen’s fifth star activated, and the divine ring was restored to its thirty-thousand-meter size.

The fifth star was his limit. However, the pressure was still growing greater.

He could see the bottom of the whirlpool. It was a mass of darkness, like the gaping maw of a monster waiting for its prey.

The divine ring once more compressed from the immense pressure. As for Xie Qianqian, crackling sounds rang out from her bones.

“Evilmoon, stop acting dead and help!” shouted Long Chen.

“Fuck off! Just wait for death. No one will help you,” was Evilmoon’s cold reply.
