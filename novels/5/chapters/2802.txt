Chapter 2791 Nether Corpse Insect Poison

This middle-aged man looked normal but gave off an extremely sinister feeling. His gaze in particular seemed to be searching for people’s weaknesses at all times.

It seemed that he didn’t even care about Long Chen killing the Alldevil Heavenwalker and the Nine-Headed Lion. He simply walked out of the palace.

“I’ve been with the Nine Underworld Hunters for three thousand years, and you are the fourth nine star heir I’ve encountered. It seems that I’m about to profit again.” The middle-aged man laughed, looking at Long Chen like he was his prey.

As for Long Aotian, Jiang Wuchen, and Ye Liangchen, they were just as happy. In their eyes, Long Chen was definitely dead today.

“Long Chen, although I’m not personally killing you, it’s fine. I’ll take care of those brothers and lovers of yours, hahaha!” Long Aotian finally felt the pleasure of revenge for Long Chen killing his mother.

“I also won’t kill you personally. I’ll make sure you stay alive in this world.” Long Chen snorted and suddenly appeared right in front of Long Aotian.

Long Aotian was startled, not expecting Long Chen to directly come toward him with the Nine Underworld Hunters present. Long Chen was incredibly fast and instantly froze the space around Long Aotian. The latter couldn’t even move.

However, just at that moment, a chain flew out at Long Chen. The head of the chain looked to be a viper’s head.

BANG! Long Chen raised his arm, knocking aside the chain. Its path deviated toward Ye Liangchen and Jiang Wuchen.

“No!” The two of them cried out in horror, but they had no time to flee. The chain struck them, instantly blasting them into blood mist.

Beside Jiang Wuchen, Feng Fei was splattered with blood, and she was pale with horror.

The chain contained the power of a divine Dao, and a terrifying kind at that. A mortal would be instantly killed on contact, and the chain only barely flew by her face.

It all happened so fast that it ended before it even began. The previously mighty Long Aotian had his throat in Long Chen’s hand. He was like a chicken.

The Nine Underworld Hunter who had attacked was surprised. He had been careless, not expecting Long Chen to be so powerful. His chain trembled as he prepared to attack again, but the middle-aged man waved his hand, stopping his movements.

The middle-aged man looked at Long Chen indifferently. It seemed that he didn’t care about Long Aotian’s life or death.

“Please… save me…” Long Aotian squeezed out some words. Even all these experts couldn’t protect him.

What no one had expected was that Long Aotian’s pants became wet. He was so scared that he had pissed himself.

“Coward.” The countless experts of the Martial Heaven Continent looked at him scornfully. This was a Sovereign? A peerless heavenly genius? He broke down as soon as he faced death.

Long Chen had faced death countless times without bending or lowering his head. In comparison, Long Aotian was an embarrassment.

The middle-aged man shook his head. “You were the one who interjected while I was speaking. Do you think this is your place to talk? It can only be said that you were courting your own death. Although you sent the information of the nine star heir to me, and I did promise the Long family to give you some benefits, you’ve irritated me. I don’t really care about you. If you like interjecting yourself, you can continue begging.”

This middle-aged man’s status was clearly extremely high. Just interrupting him was a grave sin for Long Aotian. That was why he didn’t stop Long Chen.

“No…” Long Aotian cried out in despair. Was there any chance he could survive when he was caught in Long Chen’s hands?”

“I beg you… The Long family… will repay you…!” begged Long Aotian.

“Just based on you? The Long family has disciples through various worlds and countless heavenly geniuses. As for your branch, with your talent, you wouldn’t even reach the middle tier. Perhaps if I saved a dog of the Long family, they might feel some gratitude. But do you think the Long family will repay me for saving an ant? Are you joking with me?” the middle-aged man shook his head.

“I… cough…” Long Aotian tried to speak once more, only for Long Chen to crush his throat. Rainbow blood spurted out.

“You don’t need to beg him because I won’t kill you. You took my Spirit Root, Spirit Blood, and Spirit Bone. You’ve caused me endless pain. Do you think that I’ll just kill you like this? No. I’ll let you live. I’ll make you live a life worse than death. A coward like you definitely doesn’t have the courage to kill yourself.” Long Chen took out a black pill. He then stuffed it into Long Aotian’s mouth. “I prepared this pill for you a long time ago. Now I can finally use it.”

Long Aotian stubbornly clenched his teeth, only for Long Chen to break his teeth with a finger and stuff the pill through.

Long Chen tossed Long Aotian aside after feeding him the pill. He really did just let him off.

Feeling delighted, Long Aotian fled into the immortal palace. However, he had barely reached the gates when he suddenly screamed.

Sharp points began to sprout out of his body like bamboo. They wriggled like maggots coming out of a rotting corpse.

“Underworld Corpse Insect Poison!” The middle-aged man was finally a bit astonished. He recognized this poison.

However, he was actually wrong. This was a special existence that Long Chen had refined through his own essence blood and the black soil. The death qi of the black soil had been mistaken by the middle-aged man to be the Netherworld’s qi.

However, he was right about it being insect poison. When the pill entered the stomach, it transformed into millions of maggots that devoured Long Aotian’s blood and soul.

Most terrifying of all, they could not be killed. If they were, Long Aotian would also die.

These maggots were connected to his Yuan Spirit, so Long Aotian was already clear that these maggots were materialized from his own blood and soul.

“AHH!”

Long Aotian screamed in terror. Maggots continued to wriggle out of his body, every single one causing him incomparable pain. This was a torture that could not be described with words. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

At this moment, one of the Nine Underworld Hunters slammed a palm on Long Aotian’s forehead, causing him to collapse. His screams were cut off, but he continued to twitch. Some of the divine families’ experts then hastily brought him away.

After that, a chair appeared in the air. The middle-aged man sat down on it. “Someone go test his power. Don’t kill him too fast or it would be wasteful.”

“Yes.”

The previous Nine Underworld Hunter who had attacked Long Chen stepped forward. His chain pierced toward Long Chen like a viper.
