Chapter 3767: The World’s Laws

“The Heavenly River Blood Sea has yet to start boiling. By undergoing tribulation now, aren’t they wasting their chance to change their fates?” Jiang Lei couldn’t help sighing as he watched them undergo tribulation.

“The demonic beast race’s command system is very simple. It’s different from the human race. It’s simple, direct, and violent. But it’s very effective. The beast race’s true experts can decide the fates of the weak. They aren’t limited by morality. The weak exist to serve the strong, so the strong order them to do whatever they need. Just like the wolves in a barren wasteland, the wolf king has the highest authority. No other wolves dare to disobey. Who lives and who dies is up to the wolf king,” said Long Chen quietly.

“Animals are animals. They’re cold-blooded and merciless,” said Jiang Lei coldly. He was especially full of hatred for the demonic beast race.

“Although the beast race’s rules are cruel, they are a reflection of natural law. This is different from the human race. The beast race’s connections are dependent on bloodlines, ranking, and social order. But the human race has laws, morality, and feelings to consider. This constraint leads to severe polarization. Kind people are as kind as saints, but evil people are worse than devils. On the other hand, the beast race has to follow their hierarchy, and anyone who disobeys is executed. As a result, the demonic beast race greatly respects these rules, quite different from our situation. The human race’s laws usually end up being lax, with people constantly testing the bottom lines of morality and rules. It’s unknown just how many people die because of this, but people don’t get tired of it. This is human nature. You can’t expect the human race to be self-disciplined or hope for them to follow any rules forever. That is because for the human race, the rules are made to be broken,” said Long Chen as he eyed those demonic beasts.

“Boss, I just want to say, I’m not questioning you. But I don’t quite understand. I feel like you are looking down on the human race’s rules. Is being self-disciplined and following the rules not good?” asked Jiang Lei after pondering what Long Chen had just said.

“Good or bad depends on who sets the rules. What are their goals? Are the rules made for selfish or selfless purposes? Does the person who made the rules also abide by them? Or are the rules only there to restrict other people?”

“Well…”

“Let me tell you, up until now, I have yet to encounter someone making the rules. Not the peerless five Sovereigns who shook the world, not the ruler of the nation, big brother Xia Guhong. Not the Wine God Palace, and not the Spirit race. They are all dissatisfied with the world, but I don’t know why they never think about changing this world’s laws. Perhaps deep inside, they approve of these laws. Or perhaps they don’t approve but can’t find better laws to replace them with. Or perhaps…” Long Chen suddenly shut his mouth.

Long Chen wanted to say that perhaps they didn’t have the power to change this world. But they were all people that he revered, so he didn’t want to say such a thing.

“Then who created the laws of this world?” asked Jiang Lei.

“How could I know?”

Long Chen sighed. Perhaps no one knew. The sea of bitterness was endless, and everyone was within it, struggling to cross. No one could see the world in its entirety.

Rumbling cut off their conversation, as thousands of demonic beasts were undergoing tribulation together. Lightning raged.

These demonic beasts were immersed within the lightning. The lightning was constantly strengthening their bodies.

“Boss, we can charge in and kill them. Maybe I can get some benefits too,” said Jiang Lei as he eyed that lightning a bit greedily.

Long Chen said that he had the ability to absorb the power of heavenly tribulation. However, he still didn’t know how. He wanted to test it first.

“Are you a fool? They are on the edge of the core and the outer region. On the other side are Divine Venerates. If we attack them, we’ll be throwing ourselves into a trap. Just conceal your auras and don’t be noticed. Lei Linger is already there. Let her get some benefits first,” said Long Chen.

The two of them hid in the void. They had fully recovered and could control their auras easily. Adding on Xia Chen’s formation discs, as long as they were careful, it was very difficult for others to notice them.

Blood-colored mist flowed through the world. Their vision was limited, and their divine sense was suppressed. Long Chen could see the beasts undergoing tribulation, and he sensed a threat beyond them. But he couldn’t see their actual figures.

When the heavenly tribulation raged, lightning rained down like arrows, which stabbed into the blood sea, causing huge waves.Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

The blood sea was like a boiling pot when struck by lightning. Blood-colored aura flowed out and was absorbed by those experts.

“I understand. They are undergoing tribulation to stimulate the blood sea, making it boil earlier,” said Long Chen suddenly.

“Why would they do that?” asked Jiang Lei.

“Perhaps too many people have snuck into the Heavenly River Blood Sea, so they have doubt about being able to block outsiders. By having a portion of people first undergo tribulation, they’ll have Immortal Kings in the core preventing outsiders from coming in. At the same time, the Heavenly River Blood Sea will boil earlier. Most likely, the demonic beasts have mostly all arrived, and they don’t wish to wait any longer. If they keep waiting, more outsiders will come. That’s not beneficial to them,” said Long Chen.

“Is that so? Then is this group only one portion of the demonic beasts undergoing tribulation in advance?” asked Jiang Lei.

Long Chen nodded. “Most likely. Those who can break through their defenses to enter the core have to be outstanding figures. These people undergoing tribulation aren’t Supreme experts. But after they become Immortal Kings, they will be qualified to fight Supreme experts. With a realm advantage and numbers, they’ll crush all oppositions.”

These demonic beasts might not be Supreme experts, but all of them had astonishing Blood Qi. Once they became Immortal Kings, their combat power would grow explosively. If they also condensed Heavenly Dao Crowns, they might have power rivaling Supreme Divine Lords.

A group of strong Immortal Kings was something that even Supreme geniuses would have to avoid. The demonic beast race had sacrificed the opportunities of a portion of their disciples to prevent outsiders from benefiting. It was truly ruthless.

At the same time, the blood sea’s temperature was starting to rise. Bubbles were rising from the depths, and the Blood Qi fluctuations in the air grew increasingly strong. All kinds of phenomena were occurring, gradually validating Long Chen’s speculation.

Suddenly, ancient beasts came flying out of the tribulation clouds, attacking the demonic beasts. Upon seeing this, Long Chen slowly smiled.

A demonic beast was directly crushed to bits by the claw of a lightning beast, and his companions screamed in shock.
