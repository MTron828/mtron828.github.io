Chapter 2783 Hu Feng Against Alldevil Heavenwalker

BOOM!

Little Snow’s claw fell toward the Alldevil Heavenwalker, and the earth split apart all the way to the end of the continent. Despite using his full power to defend, the Alldevil Heavenwalker still hacked up blood and was sent flying. However, the direction he flew in was where Long Chen was. At the same time, the Martial Heaven Continent’s experts were impacted by that divine power, and some of the weaker people were killed.

“Not good. Little Snow has just awoken and cannot perfectly control its own power yet.” Meng Qi turned pale. That claw of Little Snow’s had torn open a hole in the Martial Heaven Continent’s defenses.

“Hahaha!” Even as the Alldevil Heavenwalker hacked up blood, he laughed. Borrowing the opening created by Little Snow’s claw, he charged toward the barrier and unleashed a single palm.

BOOM!

The barrier rumbled. Inside of it, blood leaked out of Yun Tian’s mouth and dripped onto his white robes.

“Boss Yun Tian!” Mo Nian roared furiously. He charged toward the Alldevil Heavenwalker.

“Little ant, you can scram!” The Alldevil Heavenwalker sneered and unleashed another palm. Devil qi erupted, forming a ray of light that blocked Mo Nian.

“Little Snow, don’t!” shouted Meng Qi.

Little Snow was about to unleash another claw. But in its newly born state, it didn’t know how to control its own power.

After this attack, the Alldevil Heavenwalker wouldn’t necessarily be killed, but the barrier might be instantly destroyed.

Hence, Little Snow’s claw paused, hanging in midair.

“Come you little brute!” provoked the Alldevil Heavenwalker, having noticed the problem with Little Snow’s power as well. He then unleashed a second palm on the barrier.

BOOM!

Countless ripples appeared within the barrier, and more blood spurted out of Yun Tian’s mouth. His bright eyes dimmed. Cracks were now appearing throughout his body just like the barrier.

“Alldevil Heavenwalker, if you have guts, come at your daddy Mo!” roared Mo Nian, his voice hoarse. But he was completely blocked by the Alldevil Heavenwalker’s divine Dao power.

“Little Snow, go block the Nine-Headed Lion! He’s coming back!” shouted Meng Qi. The Nine-Headed Lion was charging over. If he also got in, it would only make things worse.

Little Snow roared and charged toward the Nine-Headed Lion. The latter was sent flying before he could enter the core, and one of his legs was ripped off.

The Alldevil Heavenwalker ignored the Nine-Headed Lion’s predicament. He was smiling sinisterly at Yun Tian.

“Yun Tian, I’ll send you to your father. Do you have any last words?”

“The Martial Heaven Continent birthed me. I can do nothing to repay the favor, but if I could use my blood and soul to protect this world, I would die a hundred deaths with no regrets,” said Yun Tian, his voice resounding through the air.

“Sovereign Yun Tian!”

The commoners protected within the core cried out. Although Yun Tian wasn’t a formal Sovereign, in their hearts, he was a supreme Sovereign.

The five Sovereigns had given everything for the Martial Heaven Continent, and Yun Tian had received the baton from Sovereign Yun Shang, using his own life to carry out the Sovereigns’ will.

The Sovereigns didn’t even leave any of their own legacies for others to worship. Nonsensical monsters and ignorant ideas had millions of brainless followers worshiping them, but while the Sovereigns protected the people, the latter questioned their legends, instead believing in fake gods that they couldn’t see or sense.

When this tribulation descended, those fake gods that claimed to be omnipotent and capable of protecting their followers didn’t appear. The only ones to protect them were the Sovereigns.

“Great god of the stars, I beg you to protect your humble servant. Let this tribulation pass…” Despite that, there were still people praying.

That person was directly slapped out of his prayer by someone else who cursed him, “What exactly are you praying for?! You idiots, you have no idea who is really protecting you.”

The prayer furiously said, “You’re the idiot! It is precisely due to your ignorance that the gods sent down this tribulation to punish you! As long as you calmly prayed, letting the gods know you were sincere, this tribulation would immediately end. The god is omniscient, omnipotent. Everyone in this world has sins. We must-”

Someone furiously punched him in the middle of his speech, destroying his head. Chaos started amongst the commoners.

By saying that everyone had sins, he provoked countless people. Sovereigns were also people. Did the Sovereigns also have sins?

The cultivators within the core region hastily suppressed things to avoid large-scale casualties.

Xia Youluo sighed, “The most frightening aspect of foolish people is that they don’t see their own foolishness. Wisdom is like a jade bottle the creator tossed to the ground and shattered. Some people picked up a bit more, some people picked up a bit less, and some people didn’t even get a single piece.”

Xia Youluo looked at Long Chen in the barrier. Then she looked at the ones fighting with their lives on the line for him, Meng Qi, Chu Yao, Tang Wan-er, Ye Zhiqiu, Dong Mingyu, and the others.

“They are all willing to risk their lives for him. If it was me, would I also be willing?” wondered Xia Youluo. She suddenly bitterly laughed. “I would naturally be willing. But he can’t treat me like them.”

Xia Yunfeng looked at this little sister of his and alternated between tears and laughter. He couldn’t help feeling hurt for her. But matters of love sometimes had no solutions.

Sometimes a single look could tie people together for a lifetime. Sometimes no matter what happened, there was no destiny between two people. Forcing it was not possible. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

On the battlefield, the fighting was growing more and more intense. Mo Nian finally broke through and charged at the Alldevil Heavenwalker. In his fury, he unleashed suicidal moves just to force him off of the barrier.

The Alldevil Heavenwalker didn’t wish to be injured in this state. With him being the vessel of the god incarnation, any injuries could easily leave behind hidden wounds that could harm his foundation.

Feeling furious, the Alldevil Heavenwalker focused on Mo Nian. At the first opening, he smashed away the Central Plains Cauldron and reached for Mo Nian’s throat.

Mo Nian sighed inside and closed his eyes. There was nothing to say. He simply wasn’t as strong as his enemy.

BANG!

Just as Mo Nian had accepted his death, a ray of light appeared in front of Mo Nian, blocking the Alldevil Heavenwalker’s attack.

“Who is it?!” The Alldevil Heavenwalker was startled. His attacking arm was numb.

“The Gambling Heavenly Dao’s Hu Feng, here for pointers.”

Hu Feng’s figure appeared in front of Mo Nian. The die that always floated behind him was gone.
