Chapter 4387 Ghost Bat Race

From the projection, they saw an ancient city bustling with activity. It was a prosperous and lively place.

However, what caused flames of fury to explode out of Long Chen and the others was the horrifying sight of countless humans being treated like livestock—neck collared, bodies chained. Some were forced to pull carriages, while others were led through the streets like dogs. Cages lined the streets, containing young men and women who were being shamefully sold in public.

The humans were enslaved, turned into beasts of burden. At this moment, killing intent glinted in Long Chen’s eyes. Such degradation was the ultimate form of humiliation against the human race.

“Where is this?” demanded Long Chen darkly.

“This is the Yuyang World, one of the worlds that opened to the Darklight Heaven this time,” explained one of the Eternal experts.

“To dare to humiliate the human race like this, they really go too far. Once we recover, we’ll go see them,” said Guo Ran, unable to watch this scene.

“Humiliate the human race? No, they asked for this humiliation, so they can’t blame others,” replied that Eternal expert.

“What?”

The Eternal expert continued, “They asked for this as no one forced them to enter the Yuyang World. They went in willingly.”

“How can that be?” exclaimed Bai Shishi with disbelief.

“It truly is the case. The Yuyang World’s primal chaos qi is extremely dense, and the Heavenly Daos there are also very suitable for the human race’s cultivation. With their unique laws, cultivating in the Yuyang World not only accelerates your cultivation speed but also enhances your understanding of the Heavenly Daos. Thus, countless human experts flocked toward it. However, the Yuyang World has its own natives. The majority of them have powerful bloodlines and are not willing to give up their territories. While they don't harbor animosity toward the human race, neither do they harbor much favor. Perhaps there is a slight contempt. So, to enter the Yuyang World to cultivate, many humans willingly become slaves, selling both their bodies and souls. So what can you do about such a thing? Save them?”

“How can this be?”

Guo Ran and the others clenched their teeth, not knowing where to vent their anger. At first, they had thought that these people were forcibly enslaved. However, they actually did it willingly?!

“There’s more.”

The vice lightning palace master shifted the image. Now, numerous humans were prostrating themselves toward a strange totem. Following that, they sent a drop of their own blood toward the totem.

In an instant, their bodies lit up, and their auras climbed crazily. Every single one of them broke through one realm after another, their excited cries echoing in the air.

“As expected, all you need to do is worship god, and you can raise your realm!” said one of those people.

Guo Ran and the others were shocked by what they saw. Was there such a cultivation method? It was impossible.

However, these scenes were recorded with photographic jades; they couldn’t be faked. Those people had truly had sudden breakthroughs.

Even Long Chen was dumbfounded by what he saw. If that was true, what was the point of bitterly cultivating? Everyone could just go worship a god.

However, Long Chen could understand their excitement at making such a breakthrough. Anyone would be excited by such a miracle.

Following that, the scene changed. Those people and the totem were gone, replaced by a desolate wasteland littered with dried-up corpses.

Looking at their robes, Long Chen knew that the corpses were the disciples who had just been shouting excitedly upon their breakthroughs. This scene further stunned people. Just what was going on?RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

“As expected. After forcibly raising their realm, they exhausted their potential. Then, all their power is reabsorbed by the totem, including their cultivation base and lives.” Long Chen’s gaze instantly turned cold.

“The scammers are extremely crafty. What you saw before was the images they spread publicly in order to draw people over. They’re inviting people to try it free of charge, saying that using the power of their god can help people advance. In truth, after one try, they can’t stop. Their souls are already controlled by an invisible power that roots itself deeper and deeper in them until it consumes their entire existence. Countless people have fallen for it. We gathered the gruesome scene afterward and publicly released it, but some people still believe in that god instead of us,” said the vice lightning palace master helplessly.

“Hmm, sacrifice a drop of essence blood and people advance… And then withered corpses and a totem? Wait a moment, senior, can you replay the first scene? I want to look at the totem.” Long Chen suddenly thought of something.

The vice lightning palace master replayed the first scene for him. Guo Ran and the others all stared at the totem closely, but they didn’t notice anything in particular.

The totem was extremely complex, and they couldn’t find any familiar pattern. They could vaguely see a mark of the sun and moon on it, but that was it.

Seeing Long Chen staring at it so intently, the senior experts also looked at it curiously. However, it was too indistinct for them to see anything.

“We’ve looked at it many times. This totem pole’s sketches are to trick others, drawing them into a trap. We are investigating, and we still can’t find its origins…”

“It’s the primal chaos era’s Ghost Bat. That sun and moon are its eyes,” said Long Chen suddenly, his voice extremely firm.

Hearing that, quite a few Eternal experts were stunned. “Dean Long Chen, are you sure? The Ghost Bat race went through several hunts to extinction in the primal chaos era! They should no longer exist.”

Guo Ran and the others were unaware of this existence, but those Eternal experts had been around for a long time and knew many secrets. However, even they were stunned to hear of the Ghost Bat now.

“Pretty sure,” said Long Chen.

Pretty sure? That was essentially set in stone if it was said by Long Chen. If he didn’t feel confident, he wouldn’t say such a thing with such a tone.

“If it really is the revival of the Ghost Bat race, the world is going to be thrown into chaos. A tribulation is about to come.” Even the vice lightning palace master’s expression changed.

Guo Ran and the others were still befuddled. Having never heard of the Ghost Bat race, they didn’t know why everyone was treating them so seriously.

“Is the Ghost Bat race really so amazing?” asked Bai Xiaole.

Bai Letian solemnly said, “Describing them as amazing isn't accurate; terrifying is the appropriate term. If what Dean Long Chen states is true, the resurgence of the Ghost Bat race poses a genuine threat to all humans. While we can't be certain, we must brace ourselves for the worst-case scenario. Dispatch people to monitor them immediately. We need to eliminate them swiftly before they have a chance to grow.”

The atmosphere grew heavy after the matter of the Ghost Bat race was brought up. Everyone was silent for a moment before the vice lightning palace master continued, “The matter of the Ghost Bat race can be set aside for now. We will handle it. Dean Long Chen, we have an even more crucial mission for you.”
