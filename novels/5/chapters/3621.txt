Chapter 3610

Everyone was dumbfounded. Whether it was the Heavenly Dragon Divine Armor College’s experts or the others that had come, they were horrified by this scene. They didn’t even dare to breathe.

It had to be known that the patriarch of the Celestial Essence Sect was a supreme existence that countless people looked up to. Moreover, the Celestial Essence Sect was the Alldevil Star-Field’s number one sect. However, Long Chen actually dared to cut off their patriarch's head. Just how brazen was he?

“Boss, you misspoke. The so-called six domestic animals refer to the horse, bull, sheep, pig, chicken, and dog. A tortoise isn’t part of it. At most, it can only count for one chicken. As for the rest…” Guo Ran suddenly corrected Long Chen.

“You mean that he’s not even worth a pig or a dog?” asked Long Chen.

“Hehe, that’s pretty much it!” Guo Ran nodded.

The two of them played off of each other perfectly, clearly insulting the patriarch. But the patriarch’s life was in Long Chen’s hands, so the atmosphere was far too tense for anyone to dare to laugh. They simply stared at Long Chen in horror.

“Long Chen, what are you doing?! Hurry up and release-!”

Guo Ran was standing right beside this speaking elder and directly slapped him in the face, interrupting him. “Is my boss’s name something that you can just shout? Don’t forget your manners! This is dean Long Chen!”

The elder staggered back. Even a half-step Divine Venerate when caught off-guard, with his weak physical body, still tumbled to the ground from this slap.

By the time he crawled back up furiously and put on his battle armor, Guo Ran was already hiding behind Long Chen. He arrogantly said, “Old fellow, if you want to die, then come. Let’s see if my boss will cut off your head or not.”

“You…!”

That elder was enraged, but he didn’t dare to charge forward because Long Chen was absolutely terrifying. Even now, they had no idea how he had cut off the Celestial Essence Sect patriarch’s head.

“What you? Shut your ass! If my boss wants to kill someone, not even the heavens can protect them. Who do you think you are? Just stand right there!” said Guo Ran disdainfully as he stood behind Long Chen.

In any case, with Long Chen present, Guo Ran had no fears. Having slapped a half-step Divine Venerate expert, he was in an excellent mood. It was like he had reached the peak of his life.

Xie Liuer, Leng Hui, Xie Qianqian, Tu Hu, and the others’ eyes almost popped out of their heads. Was this the same Guo Ran that they knew? He even dared to beat up a sect master, an existence that even their dean had to be respectful toward.

However, thinking of how Long Chen had cut off the head of the Celestial Essence Sect’s patriarch, this little action of Guo Ran’s truly didn’t seem to be much.

These people looked at each other. They had now borne witness to what it meant to be unbridled, what it meant to be incomparably domineering.

The head of the Celestial Essence Sect’s patriarch was in Long Chen’s hand. As long as Long Chen unleashed the slightest spurt of divine energy, then even if the patriarch had a hundred lives, he would be losing them here.

His life was in Long Chen’s hands, so he didn’t dare to make any rash moves. However, to have him beg for mercy? It was impossible. His expression was extremely ugly.

“Xue Yifan, this is the disciple that your Heavenly Dragon Divine Armor College raised?!” shouted one elder.

“No, you misunderstand. Dean Long Chen is not a disciple of the Heavenly Dragon Divine Armor College. He comes from the number one academy of the nine heavens and ten lands, the High Firmament Academy. He is the dean of the High Firmament Academy’s seventh branch. My Heavenly Dragon Divine Armor College is also a branch of the High Firmament Academy, so in terms of seniority and relationship, we are on the same level, and I cannot possibly order around dean Long Chen.” Xue Yifan shook his head, seemingly once more becoming a kindly elder. He no longer appeared to be a domineering master in control of everything.

When Xue Yifan reported Long Chen’s status, those old fellows were startled. The High Firmament Academy was the oldest academy in the immortal world. Everyone knew of it. They were unable to imagine how such a youngster could become the dean of a branch of this ancient academy.

“Long Chen, what do you want? Are you really going to kill me?” demanded the Celestial Essence Sect’s patriarch coldly.

Although his tone was very icy, everyone could hear the fear in it. Normally, he would say, ‘do you really dare to kill me, not are you really going to kill me.’ He didn’t dare to further antagonize Long Chen.

“I don’t want to kill you. It was you who felt yourself to be such a badass that you wanted to put me in my place, so I had to give you a lesson. I know that you came to show off and establish your prestige, but you won’t be establishing anything today. I have been entrusted by dean Xue Yifan to handle this matter, so I will naturally handle it properly. I will lead the Heavenly Dragon Divine Armor College’s disciples to unprecedented glory. As for the rest of you, if you want to follow me, then you can follow. If you don’t want to, then I won’t force you. But don’t try to drag me down. I will not stand on courtesy. Although I am young, I have spent a lifetime fighting enemies from all directions. From the mortal world to the immortal world, I’ve stepped over mountains of corpses and crossed seas of blood. I’ve killed more lifeforms than you’ve ever seen. So, I am not some kind saint. Anyone who dares to block my path will be eliminated without hesitation. If you want to try it, I will accompany you at any moment.” Long Chen looked over at everyone.

Long Chen calmly said such domineering words, shaking people’s hearts. Xie Liuer, Leng Hui, and the others were even more shocked.

Long Chen’s innate arrogance and domineeringness shook everyone. There was not a single person who dared to question his words.

Long Chen then let go of the patriarch’s head after saying this, and it flew back to his body. As a half-step Divine Venerate expert, reattaching his head was effortless.

The patriarch’s body was restored, but the mark that remained at the neck of his battle armor was a horrifying sight.

The cut was extremely thin and perfect. People were unable to imagine just what kind of weapon could possibly be so sharp. It practically surpassed their imagination.

The Celestial Essence Sect’s patriarch regained his freedom, but his expression grew extremely dark. Flames almost exploded out of his eyes when he looked at Long Chen.

“Since I dared to release you, I dare to kill you as well. If you don’t submit, I welcome you to test me. As long as you don’t cherish your old life, I will accompany you,” said Long Chen indifferently.

Everyone looked at the patriarch. They saw his expression change several times, but ultimately, he didn’t dare to attack.

“Alright, count yourself vicious. I refuse to believe that your Heavenly Dragon Divine Armor College can do anything in this war without our help. Do you think that with just your college’s power, you can fight the Luo clan’s traitorous army and the entire Alldevil race? Keep dreaming!” sneered the Celestial Essence Sect’s patriarch.

“That’s right. Without our aid, you want your Heavenly Dragon Divine Armor College to fight the human race’s enemies alone? What a wild fantasy!” sneered another half-step Divine Venerate elder.

“Hmph, when the heavens are wild, there is a storm. When humans are wild, calamity descends. Youngsters are ultimately still youngsters! Let’s just see how long you can keep acting so wild! We’re leaving.” The Celestial Essence Sect’s patriarch snorted coldly and waved his hand. He turned to leave.

“Starry river warriors, capture this old fellow.” Long Chen snorted and directly gave his response.

Following his order, three hundred starry river warriors immediately responded by charging directly at the Celestial Essence Sect’s patriarch.
